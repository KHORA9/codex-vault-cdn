THOMAS MACLAUCHLAN, LL.D., F.S.A.S.,\r\n  One of the Editors of the “Dean of Lismore’s Book,” Author of\r\n  “The Early Scottish Church,” &c.;\r\n\r\n  AND AN ESSAY ON HIGHLAND SCENERY,\r\n  BY THE LATE PROFESSOR JOHN WILSON.\r\n\r\n  EDITED BY JOHN S. KELTIE, F.S.A.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years, the patriotic labours of the various\r\nScottish book-clubs,--The Abbotsford, The Bannatyne, The Iona, The\r\nMaitland, The Spalding Clubs--the works of the various eminent\r\nScottish antiquaries and historians, not to mention many valuable\r\npapers and pamphlets, have not only subjected everything connected\r\nwith the history of the Highlands to an unsparing and searching\r\ncriticism, but have also brought to light many new facts, and opened\r\nup formerly unthought-of tracks of inquiry. Such a flood of light\r\nhas thus been thrown on all matters connected with the Highlands,\r\nthat the publishers feel BROWNE’S _History of the Highlands and\r\nClans_,--the work on which this publication is to a certain extent\r\nbased,--has fallen behind the age, and that, to keep pace with the\r\nadvanced state of historical research, a NEW WORK IS DEMANDED.\r\nTherefore, in preparing the work now presented to the public, it\r\nhas been found necessary to make such extensive alterations and\r\nadditions, that the publishers feel justified in calling it a NEW\r\nWORK.\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into three sections:--\r\n\r\n  I. THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THE HIGHLANDS, including RELIGION,\r\n  LITERATURE, and ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\n  II. THE HISTORY OF THE HIGHLAND CLANS.\r\n\r\n  III. THE HISTORY OF THE HIGHLAND REGIMENTS.\r\n\r\nPART I.--THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THE HIGHLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this part has been THOROUGHLY REVISED, RE-MODELLED,\r\nand to a great extent RE-WRITTEN. All the introductory chapters\r\nrelating to the PRIMITIVE HISTORY of the Highlands, are NEW, and in\r\nthem are treated the much controverted questions as to the PICTS\r\nand SCOTS, their RACE and LANGUAGE--the EARLY RACES OF KINGS, all\r\npoints connected with the early SOCIAL and POLITICAL CONDITION of the\r\nHighlanders, their ORIGINAL RELIGION and the SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY.\r\nThe most RECENT INVESTIGATIONS bearing on the ANTIQUITIES of\r\nthe Highlands, the ANCIENT MANNERS and CUSTOMS of their people,\r\ntheir PECULIAR DRESS, their SOCIAL and POLITICAL RELATIONS, their\r\nSUPERSTITIONS, and other interesting antiquarian matters, have been\r\ntaken advantage of.\r\n\r\nAs to the rest of this portion of the work, while whatever had no\r\nconnection with Highland history has been expunged, much new matter\r\nhas been added in order to make the general narrative COMPLETE and\r\nAUTHENTIC. When, at a later period of their history, the Highlanders\r\nbecome a potent element in the settlement of many great disputes,\r\nit has been sought to make the reader understand clearly the part\r\nthey thus took in the stirring and momentous transactions of the\r\ntimes. As examples of these we need only mention here the CIVIL WARS\r\nin which MONTROSE so often led on the Highland army to victory: the\r\nRevolution disputes, culminating in KILLIECRANKIE: the unfortunate\r\ninsurrections of ’15 and ’45, which, but for the romantic enthusiasm\r\nof the Highlanders, would never have been even commenced.\r\n\r\nIn writing these chapters ample use has been made of the various\r\nclub-publications above referred to, the latest of which, THE BOOK OF\r\nDEER, issued by the Spalding Club, edited by Dr. Stuart, has proved\r\nof great service in throwing light on the EARLY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL\r\nCONDITION of the Highlands, as well as on the STATE and CONSTITUTION\r\nof the EARLY SCOTTISH CHURCH. Among modern Scottish historians and\r\nantiquarians whose labours have been taken advantage of in this\r\npart of the work, we may mention the names of George Chalmers, W.\r\nF. Skene, Joseph Robertson, Daniel Wilson, Mr. Gregory, John Hill\r\nBurton, E. W. Robertson, James Logan, Cosmo Innes, George Grub, Dr.\r\nMaclauchlan, and Colonel Forbes-Leslie: this last gentleman has been\r\nkind enough to place at our disposal some of the cuts which adorn his\r\nvaluable work, _The Early Races of Scotland_. Besides these, books\r\nand documents, ancient and modern, too numerous to detail here, have\r\nbeen consulted.\r\n\r\nTo the GAELIC LANGUAGE and LITERATURE, which, in the old work,\r\npossibly from lack of material, were treated in rather a summary\r\nmanner, a prominent place has been given. Since the publication of\r\n_The Dean of Lismore’s Book_, and other works on this interesting\r\nsubject, there can be no complaint of lack of material; and so\r\nmuch importance do the publishers attach to the literature of the\r\nHighlands, that they have entered into an arrangement with the Rev.\r\nThomas Maclauchlan, LL.D., F.S.A.S.--one of the editors of _The\r\nDean of Lismore’s Book_, and one of the most eminent living Gaelic\r\nscholars--to write an entirely new account of this subject, into\r\nwhich will be introduced copious examples of genuine old GAELIC\r\nPOETRY.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work will be given the late PROFESSOR WILSON’S\r\ncelebrated ESSAY ON HIGHLAND SCENERY, of which the copyright belongs\r\nto the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--THE HISTORY OF THE HIGHLAND CLANS.\r\n\r\nIn any history of the Highlands, an account of the CLANS ought to\r\noccupy a place of the first importance, and in the present work,\r\nthe GREATER PART OF THE SECOND VOLUME is devoted to this part of\r\nthe subject. Every point of interest connected with this peculiar\r\nsocial system has been noticed:--the ORIGIN OF THE CLAN-SYSTEM, the\r\nrelation of the chief to the general body of the clan, the various\r\nCLAN-DIGNITIES and OFFICES and the duties which belonged to each,\r\nthe PECULIAR CUSTOMS to which the system gave rise, the difference\r\nbetween CLANSHIP and the FEUDAL SYSTEM, and the influence it had\r\non the progress of the Highlands and on the rest of Scotland. In\r\nshort, no pains have been spared to enable the reader to form a clear\r\nidea of all the ‘outs and ins’ of this primitive system of social\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAfter this introductory matter, a DETAILED ACCOUNT is given of EACH\r\nSEPARATE CLAN which has any claim to be considered Highland. THE\r\nORIGIN OF EACH CLAN, as far as possible, has been traced back to its\r\nFOUNDER, and its claim to be considered purely Gaelic discussed; its\r\nhistory is traced through all its branches and offshoots down to the\r\npresent day; the part it took in the various clan strifes, in the\r\ndisputes between the Highlands and Lowlands, and in the general wars\r\nof Scotland, is set forth. Every link in the genealogical chain has\r\nbeen carefully traced, and those chiefs and other members of a clan\r\nwho took a more prominent part in the affairs of the time, have their\r\nlives given in considerable detail. Appended to the account of each\r\nclan are its ARMORIAL BEARINGS, a description of its CLAN-TARTAN,\r\nthe name of its BADGE, its peculiar war-cry or SLOGAN, its estimated\r\nSTRENGTH, and its PRINCIPAL SEAT. In addition to the authorities\r\nabove referred to, the works of Smibert, Logan, Stewart, and others,\r\nas well as the separate histories of those clans that are fortunate\r\nenough to have such, this division of the work is greatly indebted\r\nto the original researches of the late Mr. Anderson, author of the\r\n_Scottish Nation_, whose examination of many ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS and\r\nFAMILY RECORDS brought to light many facts connected with the history\r\nof the Highland clans, never before made public.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.--HISTORY OF THE HIGHLAND REGIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe HISTORY OF THESE REGIMENTS is to a great extent the HISTORY\r\nOF BRITAIN’S BATTLES for more than a century past; and the great\r\nmilitary glory which our country has acquired, has been owing, in no\r\nsmall degree, to their UNSURPASSED BRAVERY, PERFECT DISCIPLINE, and\r\nHIGH MORALE. In the part of the work devoted to this subject, it has\r\nbeen sought faithfully to record not only the noble services rendered\r\nto its country in past times by each regiment in every engagement\r\nin which it took part, but also the brave deeds performed by many\r\nindividual Highland soldiers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the later history of the Highland regiments, it\r\nhas been sought to render this complete and perfectly reliable by\r\napplying, for direct information, to the COLONEL OF EACH EXISTING\r\nREGIMENT; and in every case the publishers have met with the greatest\r\ncourtesy and willingness to lend all assistance. In addition to\r\nthis, of course, every accessible published work on the subject\r\nhas been consulted, including the host of books called forth by the\r\nCrimean War and the Indian Mutiny.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the above statements it will be seen that in no other single\r\npublication is it possible to obtain SUCH VARIED and VALUABLE\r\nINFORMATION on ALL POINTS OF INTEREST connected with the Scottish\r\nHighlands--their HISTORY, their ANTIQUITIES, their CLANS, their\r\nLITERATURE, their MILITARY ANNALS. No pains have been spared to make\r\nthe work ACCURATE, EXHAUSTIVE, INTERESTING, and CONSISTENT with the\r\nMOST RECENT INVESTIGATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nBesides clan-tartans, the work will be richly embellished with\r\nautographs, seals, armorial bearings, objects of antiquarian\r\ninterest, and many views and portraits on wood and steel, all taken\r\nfrom original or other authentic sources, and executed in the first\r\nstyle of art.\r\n\r\nThe publishers have spared no pains to obtain original and genuine\r\nportraits, and to have them faithfully and beautifully reproduced;\r\nand they owe their sincere thanks to those noblemen and gentlemen\r\nconnected with the Highlands who have allowed them access to their\r\nvaluable family collections, in order to obtain copies of such\r\noriginal portraits as were required for the work. Many of these\r\nportraits have never before been engraved. The publishers would\r\nespecially mention here the valuable miniature portrait of Prince\r\nCharles Edward Stuart in Highland costume, which has been in\r\npossession of the Lochiel family for generations, and which has been\r\nkindly placed at their disposal by the present representative of the\r\nfamily, Donald Cameron, Esq., M.P. for Inverness-shire. It has the\r\nmerit of being a faithful likeness, and will be engraved by Holl of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nMany of the views, illustrative both of the events narrated in the\r\nhistory and of the rich and romantic Highland scenery, are from\r\nphotographs and drawings taken specially for the work. Others,\r\nconsisting chiefly of views of towns and fortresses taken at or\r\nnear the time of the events they are intended to illustrate, are\r\ncopied from the rare and valuable work of John Slezer, entitled\r\n_Theatrum Scotiæ_, published at the end of the 17th century. The\r\nfacts that Slezer was a military engineer, and that he was appointed\r\nby government to survey the chief towns and strongholds of Scotland,\r\nare sufficient guarantees of the faithfulness of these views.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n  This work will be published in Twenty-five parts, price Two\r\n  Shillings each, size super-imperial 8vo. It will also be issued\r\n  in Eight Divisions, rich cloth, price 7s. 6d. each. It will form,\r\n  when completed, Two handsome Volumes, with Thirty specimens of\r\n  authentic Clan-Tartans, beautifully executed in colour, and\r\n  Twenty other page plates, including Map of Clan Territories,\r\n  besides about Two Hundred illustrative wood engravings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.

I.\r\n\r\n  A. FULLARTON & CO.\r\n  EDINBURGH AND LONDON\r\n  1875\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo apology is deemed necessary for bringing this History of the\r\nScottish Highlands before the public. A work under a similar title\r\nwas brought out by the present publishers upwards of thirty years\r\nago, under the care of Dr. James Browne, and met with a sale so\r\nextensive and sustained as to prove that it supplied a real want.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Browne’s History, which it is only the\r\nsimple truth to say had no rival, research has brought to light\r\nso much that is new connected both with the general history of\r\nthe Highlands and the history of the various clans, and so many\r\nnew laurels have been added to those already won by the Highland\r\nregiments during the past century, and the early part of the present,\r\nthat the publishers believed the time had come for the preparation\r\nand issue of a new work.\r\n\r\nIn preparing it, the editor has done all in his power to make it\r\ncomplete and accurate. The object of Dr. Browne’s work was to\r\npresent in one book all that is interesting and valuable concerning\r\nthe Highlands and Highlanders, a great deal of information on this\r\nsubject having lain scattered in various quarters inaccessible to\r\nthe general public. In the preparation of the present work this\r\nobject has been kept steadily in view; and it may be said of it,\r\nwith even more force than of Browne’s, that it is a _collectanea_ of\r\ninformation concerning the Scottish Highlands of an extent and kind\r\nto be met with in no other single publication.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of Dr. Browne’s work has been adhered to. In the\r\nFirst Part, that dealing with the General History of the Highlands,\r\nwhich, from the nature of the case, is more a chronicle of clan\r\nbattles than a homogeneous history, it has been found possible, as\r\nmight have been expected, to retain much of Browne’s text. This,\r\nhowever, has been subjected to a careful revision and comparison with\r\nthe original authorities, as well as with the many new ones that\r\nhave been brought to light during the past thirty years. Moreover,\r\nmany portions throughout this section have been rewritten, and\r\nconsiderable additions made. One of the largest and most important\r\nof these is the continuation of the General History from 1745 down\r\nto the present day. The editor felt that, so far as the social\r\nhistory of the Highlands is concerned, the period embraced in the\r\npast hundred years was of even more importance than any previous\r\ntime; he has therefore attempted to do what, so far as he knows, has\r\nnot been done before, to present a sketch of the progress of the\r\nHighlands during that period. For this purpose he has had to consult\r\na multitude of sources, and weigh many conflicting statements, his\r\naim being simply to discover and tell the truth. Such matters have\r\nbeen gone into as Depopulation, Emigration, Agriculture, Large and\r\nSmall Farms, Sheep and Deer, Fishing, Manufactures, Education, &c. It\r\nis hoped, therefore, that the First Part of the work will be found to\r\ncontain a complete account of the Highlands, historical, antiquarian,\r\nand social.\r\n\r\nAn original and important feature of this part of the work is a\r\nhistory of the Gaelic Language and Literature, by the well known\r\nCeltic scholar, the Rev. T. Maclauchlan, LL.D., F.S.A. Scot.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part, relating to the History of the Highland Clans,\r\nit will be found that, in the case of every clan, modifications and\r\nadditions have been made. In some instances the histories have been\r\nentirely rewritten, and several border clans have been included that\r\nwere not noticed in Browne’s work. The history of each clan, has,\r\nas far as possible, been traced from its founder through all the\r\nbranches and offshoots down to the present day; the part it took in\r\nthe various clan strifes, in the disputes between the Highlands and\r\nLowlands, and in the general wars of Scotland, being set forth. In\r\nthe case of most of the clans, gentlemen who have made a special\r\nstudy of particular clan histories have kindly revised the proofs.\r\n\r\nThe Third Part, the History of the Highland Regiments, occupies a\r\nprominent place in the present work. Of these regiments one-half have\r\nhad their complete history published now for the first time, and in\r\nthe case of the others so many changes and additions have been made,\r\nthat this part of the work may be considered as entirely new. The\r\nhistory of each of the nine regiments which now rank as Highland\r\nhas been gone into from its embodiment, and the trustworthiness of\r\nthis unique body of military history may be inferred from the fact,\r\nthat, in the case of every regiment, it is founded upon the original\r\nRegimental Record, supplemented in many instances by the diaries\r\nand recollections of officers; and in two cases, at least, as will\r\nbe seen, by materials collected by officers who have made a special\r\nstudy of their regimental histories. The general reader will find\r\nthis part of the work of very great interest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Illustrations, the publishers feel justified in\r\nalluding to them with considerable pride. No attempt has been made\r\nto make the present work a mere picture-book; it will be invariably\r\nfound that the numerous plates, woodcuts, and clan-tartans either\r\nadd interest to the text, or throw light upon it. Every effort has\r\nbeen made to secure authentic portraits and original views, and to\r\nhave every illustration executed in a thoroughly artistic style; and\r\nit is hoped that, in these respects, the exertions of the editor\r\nand publishers have been crowned with success. The specimens of\r\nclan-tartans represent in every case those recognised by the heads of\r\nthe various clans. The illustrations, therefore, will be found both\r\nhistorically and artistically valuable.\r\n\r\nThroughout this work the editor has endeavoured to acknowledge the\r\nauthorities which he has in any way made use of. Were he to mention\r\nthe names of the numerous individuals to whom he has been indebted\r\nfor assistance during its preparation, it would add very considerably\r\nto the length of this preface; in his own name and that of the\r\npublishers, he expresses sincere gratitude to all who have in any\r\nway lent a helping hand. Special thanks, however, are due to the\r\nDuke of Athole for assistance in various ways, and particularly for\r\npermission to engrave the portrait of Lord George Murray; to Lady\r\nElizabeth Pringle for the portrait of the first Earl of Breadalbane,\r\nand to Mrs. Campbell of Monzie for that of the “Gentle Lochiel,”--all\r\npublished in this work for the first time. As mentioned in the text,\r\nthe beautiful miniature of “Prince Charlie” is copied from the\r\noriginal in possession of Donald Cameron, Esq. of Lochiel, who has\r\nalso lent assistance in other ways. The originals of other valuable\r\nillustrations, as will be seen, have been kindly placed at the\r\npublishers’ service by the Duke of Sutherland, the Duke of Richmond,\r\nthe Earl of Strathmore, the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, The\r\nMackintosh, The Chisholm, Duncan Forbes, Esq. of Culloden, David\r\nLaing, Esq., LL.D., James Drummond, Esq., R.S.A., and many others.\r\n\r\nThe editor has in the proper place in the text referred to the\r\nassistance given him in connection with the important history of\r\n“Clan Chattan” by Alexander Mackintosh Shaw, Esq., whose own history\r\nof the clan is nearly completed; the narrative in the present work\r\nowes its value almost entirely to his kindness. For assistance in the\r\nhistory of this clan the editor was also indebted to the late Rev. W.\r\nG. Shaw of Forfar.\r\n\r\nTo the Colonels-commanding of all the Highland regiments special\r\nthanks are due for hearty co-operation in procuring material for the\r\nThird Part of the work. Many other officers have, with the greatest\r\nreadiness, either volunteered assistance or given it when asked. In\r\nthis connection special mention must be made of Lieutenant-Colonels\r\nWheatley, Clephane, and Sprot, Captain Colin Mackenzie, and Captain\r\nThackeray.\r\n\r\nThe large and increasing demand for this work during its publication,\r\nand the extremely favourable notices of the press, afford good\r\ngrounds for believing that it will be found to fulfil the purpose for\r\nwhich it has been compiled. May it ever meet with a kindly welcome\r\nfrom all who are in any way interested in the romantic Highlands of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n  JOHN S.

This is acknowledged by all who, having\r\nstudied their character, and become familiar with the feelings it\r\ninspires, have compared the effects produced on their minds by our\r\nown mountainous regions, with what they have experienced among the\r\nscenery of the Alps. There, indeed, all objects are on so vast a\r\nscale, that we are for a while astonished as we gaze on the gigantic;\r\nand all other emotions are sunk in an overwhelming sense of awe that\r\nprostrates the imagination. But on recovering from its subjection to\r\nthe prodigious, that faculty everywhere recognises in those mighty\r\nmountains of dark forests, glittering glaciers, and regions of\r\neternal snow--infinite all--the power and dominion of the sublime.\r\nTrue that all these are but materials for the mind to work on, and\r\nthat to its creative energy Nature owes much of that grandeur which\r\nseems to be inherent in her own forms; yet surely she in herself is\r\ngreat, and there is a regality belonging of divine right to such a\r\nmonarch as Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nThose are the very regions of sublimity, and if brought into\r\nimmediate comparison with them in their immense magnitude, the most\r\nmagnificent scenery of our own country would no doubt seem to lose\r\nits character of greatness. But such is not the process of the\r\nimagination in her intercourse with Nature. To her, sufficient for\r\nthe day is the good thereof; and on each new glorious sight being\r\nshown to her eyes, she employs her God-given power to magnify or\r\nirradiate what she beholds, without diminishing or obscuring what\r\nshe remembers. Thus, to her all things in nature hold their own due\r\nplace, and retain for ever their own due impressions, aggrandized and\r\nbeautified by mutual reaction in those visionary worlds, which by a\r\nthought she can create, and which, as they arise, are all shadowy\r\nrepresentations of realities--new compositions in which the image of\r\nthe earth we tread is reflected fairer or greater than any realities,\r\nbut not therefore less, but more true to the spirit of nature. It\r\nis thus that poets and painters at once obey and control their own\r\ninspirations. They visit all the regions of the earth, but to love,\r\nadmire, and adore; and the greatest of them all, native to our soil,\r\nfrom their travel or sojourn in foreign lands, have always brought\r\nhome a clearer insight into the character of the scenery of their\r\nown, a profounder affection for it all, and a higher power of imaging\r\nits attributes in colours or in words. In our poetry, more than in\r\nany other, Nature sees herself reflected in a magic mirror; and\r\nthough many a various show passes processionally along its lustre,\r\ndisplaying the scenery of “lands and seas, whatever clime the sun’s\r\nbright circle warms,” among them all there are none more delightful\r\nor elevating to behold than those which genius, inspired by love, has\r\nframed of the imagery, which, in all her pomp and prodigality, Heaven\r\nhas been pleased to shower, through all seasons, on our own beautiful\r\nisland. It is not for us to say whether our native painters, or the\r\n“old masters,” have shown the greatest genius in landscape; but if\r\nthe palm must be yielded to them whose works have been consecrated\r\nby a reverence, as often, perhaps, superstitious as religious, we do\r\nnot fear to say, that their superiority is not to be attributed in\r\nany degree to the scenery on which they exercised the art its beauty\r\nhad inspired. Whatever may be the associations connected with the\r\nsubjects of their landscapes--and we know not why they should be\r\nhigher or holier than those belonging to innumerable places in our\r\nown land--assuredly in themselves they are not more interesting or\r\nimpressive; nay, though none who have shared with us the spirit of\r\nthe few imperfect sentences we have now written, will for a moment\r\nsuppose us capable of instituting an invidious comparison between our\r\nown scenery and that of any other country, why should we hesitate to\r\nassert that our own storm-loving Northern Isle is equally rich in all\r\nkinds of beauty as the Sunny South, and richer far in all kinds of\r\ngrandeur, whether we regard the forms or colouring of nature--earth,\r\nsea, or air--\r\n\r\n      “Or all the dread magnificence of heaven.”\r\n\r\nWhat other region in all the world like that of the Lakes in the\r\nnorth of England! And yet how the true lover of nature, while he\r\ncarries along with him its delightful character in his heart, and\r\ncan so revive any spot of especial beauty in his imagination, as\r\nthat it shall seem in an instant to be again before his very eyes,\r\ncan deliver himself up, after the lapse of a day, to the genius of\r\nsome savage scene in the Highlands of Scotland, rent and riven by\r\nthe fury of some wild sea-loch! Not that the regions do not resemble\r\none another, but surely the prevailing spirit of the one--not so of\r\nthe other--is a spirit of joy and of peace. Her mountains, invested,\r\nthough they often be, in gloom--and we have been more than once\r\nbenighted during day, as a thunder-cloud thickened the shadows that\r\nfor ever sleep in the deepest dungeons of Helvellyn--are yet--so it\r\nseems to us--such mountains as in nature ought to belong to “merry\r\nEngland.” They boldly meet the storms, and seen in storms you might\r\nthink they loved the trouble; but pitch your tent among them, and\r\nyou will feel that theirs is a grandeur that is congenial with the\r\nsunshine, and that their spirit fully rejoices in the brightness of\r\nlight. In clear weather, verdant from base to summit, how majestic\r\ntheir repose! And as mists slowly withdraw themselves in thickening\r\nfolds up along their sides, the revelation made is still of more\r\nand more of the beautiful--arable fields below, then coppice woods\r\nstudded with standard trees--enclosed pastures above and among the\r\nwoods--broad breasts of close-nibbled herbage here and there adorned\r\nby rich dyed rocks, that do not break the expanse--till the whole\r\nveil has disappeared; and, lo! the long lofty range, with its wavy\r\nline, rising and sinking so softly in the blue serenity, perhaps,\r\nof an almost cloudless sky. Yet though we have thus characterised\r\nthe mountains by what we have always felt to be the pervading spirit\r\nof the region, chasms and ravines, and cliffs and precipices, are\r\nthere; in some places you see such assemblages as inspire the fear\r\nthat quakes at the heart, when suddenly struck in the solitude with\r\na sense of the sublime; and though we have called the mountains\r\ngreen--and during Spring and Summer, in spite of frost or drought,\r\nthey are green as emerald--yet in Autumn they are many-coloured, and\r\nare girdled with a glow of variegated light, that at sunset sometimes\r\nseems like fire kindled in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe larger Vales are all serene and cheerful; and among the sylvan\r\nknolls with which their wide levels, highly cultivated, are\r\ninterspersed, cottages, single or in groups, are frequent, of an\r\narchitecture always admirably suited to the scenery, because in a\r\nstyle suggested not by taste or fancy, which so often disfigure\r\nnature to produce the picturesque, but resorted to for sake of the\r\nuses and conveniences of in-door life, to weather-fend it in storms,\r\nand in calm to give it the enjoyment of sunshine. Many of these\r\ndwellings are not what are properly called cottages, but statesmen’s\r\nhouses, of ample front, with their many roofs, over-shadowed by a\r\nstately grove, and inhabited by the same race for many generations.\r\nAll alike have their suitable gardens, and the porches of the poorest\r\nare often clustered with roses; for everywhere among these hills,\r\neven in minds the most rude and uncultivated, there is a natural love\r\nof flowers. The villages, though somewhat too much modernised in\r\nthose days of improvement--and indeed not a few of them with hardly\r\nany remains now of their original architecture--nothing old about\r\nthem but the church tower, perhaps the parsonage--are nevertheless\r\ngenerally of a pleasing character, and accordant, if not with the\r\ngreat features of nature, which are unchanged and unchangeable, with\r\nthe increased cultivation of the country, and the many villas and\r\nornamented cottages that have risen and are rising by every lake and\r\nriver side. Rivers indeed, properly so called, there are none among\r\nthese mountains; but every vale, great and small, has at all times\r\nits pure and undefiled stream or rivulet; every hill has its hundreds\r\nof evanescent rills, almost every one its own perennial torrent\r\nflowing from spring, marsh, or tarn; and the whole region is often\r\nalive with waterfalls, of many of which, in its exquisite loveliness,\r\nthe scenery is fit for fairy festivals--and of many, in its horrid\r\ngloom, for gatherings of gnomes revisiting “the glimpses of the\r\nmoon” from their subterraneous prisons. One lake there is, which\r\nhas been called “wooded Winandermere, the river lake;” and there is\r\nanother--Ulswater--which you might imagine to be a river too, and to\r\nhave come flowing from afar; the one excelling in isles, and bays,\r\nand promontories, serene and gentle all, and perfectly beautiful; the\r\nother, matchless in its majesty of cliff and mountain, and in its old\r\nforests, among whose hoary gloom is for ever breaking out the green\r\nlight of young generations, and perpetual renovation triumphing over\r\nperpetual decay. Of the other lakes--not river-like--the character\r\nmay be imagined even from that we have faintly described of the\r\nmountains; almost every vale has its lake, or a series of lakes; and\r\nthough some of them have at times a stern aspect, and have scenes\r\nto show almost of desolation, descending sheer to the water’s edge,\r\nor overhanging the depth that looks profounder in the gloom, yet\r\neven these, to eyes and hearts familiar with their spirit, wear a\r\nsweet smile which seldom passes away. Witness Wastwater, with its\r\nhuge single mountains, and hugest of all the mountains of England,\r\nScawfell, with its terrific precipices--which, in the accidents of\r\nstorm, gloom, or mist, has seemed, to the lonely passer-by, savage\r\nin the extreme--a howling or dreary wilderness--but in its enduring\r\ncharacter, is surrounded with all quiet pastoral imagery, the deep\r\nglen in which it is embedded being, in good truth, the abode of\r\nSabbath peace. That hugest mountain is indeed the centre from which\r\nall the vales irregularly diverge; the whole circumjacent region may\r\nbe traversed in a week; and though no other district of equal extent\r\ncontains such variety of the sublime and beautiful, yet the beautiful\r\nis so prevalent that we feel its presence, even in places where it is\r\noverpowered; and on leaving “The Lakes,” our imagination is haunted\r\nand possessed with images, not of dread, but of delight.\r\n\r\nWe have sometimes been asked, whether the north of England or the\r\nHighlands of Scotland should be visited first; but, simple as the\r\nquestion seems, it is really one which it is impossible to answer,\r\nthough we suspect it would equally puzzle Scotchman or Englishman\r\nto give a sufficient reason for his wishing to see any part of any\r\nother country, before he had seen what was best worth seeing in his\r\nown. His own country ought to be, and generally is, dearest to every\r\nman. There, if nothing forbid, he should not only begin his study of\r\nnature, but continue his education in her school, wherever it may\r\nhappen to be situated, till he has taken his first degree. We believe\r\nthat the love of nature is strong in the hearts of the inhabitants of\r\nour island. And how wide and profound may that knowledge of nature\r\nbe, which the loving heart has acquired, without having studied her\r\nanywhere but within the Four Seas! The impulses that make us desire\r\nto widen the circle of our observation, are all impulses of delight\r\nand love; and it would be strange indeed, did they not move us, first\r\nof all, towards whatever is most beautiful belonging to our own land.\r\nWere it otherwise, it would seem as if the heart were faithless to\r\nthe home affections, out of which, in their strength, spring all\r\nothers that are good; and it is essential, we do not doubt, to the\r\nfull growth of the love of country, that we should all have our\r\nearliest imaginative delights associated with our native soil. Such\r\nassociations will for ever keep it loveliest to our eyes; nor is\r\nit possible that we can ever as perfectly understand the character\r\nof any other; but we can afterwards transfer and transfuse our\r\nfeelings in imagination kindled by our own will; and the beauty, born\r\nbefore our eyes, among the banks and braes of our childhood, and\r\nthen believed to be but there, and nothing like it anywhere else in\r\nall the world, becomes a golden light, “whose home is everywhere,”\r\nwhich if we do not darken it, will shine unshadowed in the dreariest\r\nplaces, till “the desert blossom like the rose.”\r\n\r\nFor our own parts, before we beheld one of “the beautiful fields of\r\nEngland,” we had walked all Scotland thorough, and had seen many a\r\nsecret place, which now, in the confusion of our crowded memory,\r\nseem often to shift their uncertain ground; but still, wherever\r\nthey glimmeringly re-appear, invested with the same heavenly light\r\nin which long ago they took possession of our soul. And now that\r\nwe are almost as familiar with the fair sister-land, and love her\r\nalmost as well as Scotland’s self, not all the charms in which she is\r\narrayed--and they are at once graceful and glorious--have ever for a\r\nday withdrawn our deeper dreams from the regions where,\r\n\r\n      “In life’s morning march when our spirit was young,”\r\n\r\nunaccompanied but by our own shadow in the wilderness, we first heard\r\nthe belling of the red deer and the eagle’s cry.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was some difficulty, if not a little danger,\r\nin getting in among some of the noblest regions of our Alps. They\r\ncould not be traversed without strong personal exertion; and a\r\nsolitary pedestrian excursion through the Grampians was seldom\r\nachieved without a few incidents that might almost have been called\r\nadventures. It is very different now; yet the _Genius Loci_, though\r\ntamed, is not subdued; and they who would become acquainted with the\r\nheart of the Highlands, will have need of some endurance still, and\r\nmust care nothing about the condition of earth or sky. Formerly, it\r\nwas not possible to survey more than a district or division in a\r\nsingle season, except to those unenviable persons who had no other\r\npursuit but that of amusement, and waged a weary war with time. The\r\nindustrious dwellers in cities, who sought these solitudes for a\r\nwhile to relieve their hearts from worldly anxieties, and gratify\r\nthat love of nature which is inextinguishable in every bosom that\r\nin youth has beat with its noble inspirations, were contented with a\r\nweek or two of such intercommunion with the spirit of the mountains,\r\nand thus continued to extend their acquaintance with the glorious\r\nwildernesses, visit after visit, for years. Now the whole Highlands,\r\nwestern and northern, may be commanded in a month. Not that any one\r\nwho knows what they are will imagine that they can be exhausted in a\r\nlifetime. The man does not live who knows all worth knowing there;\r\nand were they who made the trigonometrical survey to be questioned\r\non their experiences, they would be found ignorant of thousands of\r\nsights, any one of which would be worth a journey for its own sake.\r\nBut now steam has bridged the Great Glen, and connected the two seas.\r\nSalt water lochs the most remote and inaccessible, it has brought\r\nwithin reach of a summer day’s voyage. In a week a joyous company\r\ncan gather all the mainland shores, leaving not one magnificent bay\r\nuncircled; and, having rounded St Kilda and\r\n\r\n                  “the Hebride Isles,\r\n      Placed far amid the melancholy main,”\r\n\r\nand heard the pealing anthem of waves in the cave-cathedral of\r\nStaffa, may bless the bells of St Mungo’s tolling on the first\r\nSabbath. Thousands and tens of thousands, who but for those smoking\r\nsea-horses, had never been beyond view of the city spires, have seen\r\nsights which, though passing by almost like dreams, are not like\r\ndreams forgotten, but revive of themselves in memory and imagination;\r\nand, when the heart is weary with the work of the hand, quicken its\r\npulses with a sudden pleasure that is felt like a renovation of youth.\r\n\r\nAll through the interior, too, how many hundreds of miles of roads\r\nnow intersect regions not long ago deemed impracticable!--firm on the\r\nfen, in safety flung across the chasm--and winding smoothly amidst\r\nshatterings of rocks, round the huge mountain bases, and down the\r\nglens once felt as if interminable, now travelled almost with the\r\nspeed of the raven’s wing!\r\n\r\nIn the Highlands now, there is no _terra incognita_. But there are\r\nmany places yet well worth seeing, which it is not easy for all men\r\nto find, and to which every man must be his own guide. It is somewhat\r\nof a selfish feeling, indeed, but the pride is not a mean one, with\r\nwhich the solitary pedestrian sits down to contemplate some strange,\r\nor wild, or savage scene, or some view of surpassing sweetness and\r\nserenity, so far removed from the track of men, that he can well\r\nbelieve for a time that his eyes have been the first to behold it,\r\nand that for them alone it has now become a visible revelation.\r\nThe memory of such places is sometimes kept as a secret which we\r\nwould not communicate but to a congenial friend. They are hallowed\r\nby those mysterious “thoughts that, like phantoms, trackless come\r\nand go;” no words can tell another how to find his way thither; and\r\nwere we ourselves to seek to return, we should have to trust to some\r\nconsciousness mysterious as the instinct of a bird that carries it\r\nthrough the blind night to the place of its desire.\r\n\r\nIt is well to have in our mind the conception of a route; but without\r\nbeing utterly departed from--nay, without ceasing to control us\r\nwithin certain bounds--it admits of almost any degrees of deviation.\r\nWe have known persons apparently travelling for pleasure who were\r\nafraid to turn a few miles to the right or the left, for fear of\r\nsubjecting themselves to the reproach of their own conscience for\r\ninfirmity of purpose. They had “chalked out a route,” and acted as\r\nif they had sworn a solemn oath to follow it. This is to be a slave\r\namong the boundless dominions of nature, where all are free. As the\r\nwind bloweth wherever it listeth, so move the moods of men’s minds,\r\nwhen there is nought to shackle them, and when the burden of their\r\ncares has been dropt, that for a while they may walk on air, and feel\r\nthat they too have wings.\r\n\r\n      “A voice calls on me from the mountain depths,\r\n      And it must be obeyed.”\r\n\r\nThe voice was our own--and yet though but a whisper from the heart,\r\nit seemed to come from the front of yon distant precipice--sweet and\r\nwild as an echo.\r\n\r\nOn rising at dawn in the shieling, why think, much less determine,\r\nwhere at night we are to lay down our head? Let this be our thought:\r\n\r\n      “Among the hills a hundred homes have I:\r\n        My table in the wilderness is spread:\r\n      In these lone spots one honest smile can buy\r\n        Plain fare, warm welcome, and a rushy bed.”\r\n\r\nIf we obey any powers external to our own minds, let them be the\r\npowers of Nature--the rains, the winds, the atmosphere, sun, moon and\r\nstars. We must keep a look out--\r\n\r\n      “To see the deep, fermenting tempest brewed,\r\n      In the grim evening sky;”\r\n\r\nthat next day we may cross the red rivers by bridges, not by fords;\r\nand if they roll along unbridged, that we may set our face to the\r\nmountain, and wind our way round his shoulder by sheep-tracks, unwet\r\nwith the heather, till we behold some great strath, which we had not\r\nvisited but for that storm, with its dark blue river streaked with\r\ngolden light,--for its source is in a loch among the Eastern Range;\r\nand there, during the silent hours, heather, bracken, and greensward\r\nrejoiced in the trembling dews.\r\n\r\nThere is no such climate for all kinds of beauty and grandeur as\r\nthe climate of the Highlands. Here and there you meet with an old\r\nshepherd or herdsman, who has beguiled himself into a belief, in\r\nspite of many a night’s unforeseen imprisonment in the mists, that he\r\ncan presage its changes from fair to foul, and can tell the hour when\r\nthe long-threatening thunder will begin to mutter. The weather-wise\r\nhave often perished in their plaids. Yet among a thousand uncertain\r\nsymptoms, there are a few certain, which the ranger will do well\r\nto study, and he will often exult on the mountain to feel that\r\n“knowledge is power.” Many a glorious hour has been won from the\r\ntempest by him before whose instructed eye--beyond the gloom that\r\nwide around blackened all the purple heather--“far off its coming\r\nshone.” Leagues of continuous magnificence have gradually unveiled\r\nthemselves on either side to him, as he has slowly paced, midway\r\nbetween, along the banks of the River of Waterfalls; having been\r\nassured by the light struggling through the mist, that it would not\r\nbe long till there was a break-up of all that ghastly dreariment,\r\nand that the sun would call on him to come forth from his cave of\r\nshelter, and behold in all its pride the Glen affronting the Sea.\r\n\r\nSome Tourists--as they call themselves--are provided with map and\r\ncompass; and we hope they find them of avail in extremities, though\r\nwe fear few such understand their use. No map can tell--except very\r\nvaguely--how the aspect of the localities, looked at on its lines, is\r\nlikely to be affected by sunrise, meridian, or sunset. Yet, true it\r\nis, that every region has its own happy hours, which the fortunate\r\noften find unawares, and know them at once to be so the moment they\r\nlift up their eyes. At such times, while “our hearts rejoice in\r\nNature’s joy,” we feel the presence of a spirit that brings out the\r\nessential character of the place, be it of beauty or of grandeur.\r\nHarmonious as music is then the composition of colours and of forms.\r\nIt becomes a perfect picture in memory, more and more idealised by\r\nimagination, every moment the veil is withdrawn before it; its aërial\r\nlineaments never fade; yet they too, though their being be but in the\r\nsoul, are mellowed by the touch of time--and every glimpse of such a\r\nvision, the longer we live, and the more we suffer, seems suffused\r\nwith a mournful light, as if seen through tears.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no good purpose, supposing we had the power, to\r\nanalyse the composition of that scenery, which in the aggregate so\r\nmoves even the most sluggish faculties, as to make “the dullest wight\r\na poet.” It rises before the mind in imagination, as it does before\r\nthe eyes in nature; and we can no more speak of it than look at it,\r\nbut as a whole. We can indeed fix our mental or our visual gaze on\r\nscene after scene to the exclusion of all beside, and picture it\r\neven in words that shall be more than shadows. But how shall any\r\nsuccession of such pictures, however clear and complete, give an idea\r\nof that picture which comprehends them all, and infinite as are its\r\nmanifestations, nevertheless is imbued with one spirit?\r\n\r\nTry to forget that in the Highlands there are any Lochs. Then the\r\nsole power is that of the Mountains. We speak of a sea of mountains;\r\nbut that image has never more than momentary possession of us,\r\nbecause, but for a moment, in nature it has no truth. Tumultuary\r\nmovements envelope them; but they themselves are for ever steadfast\r\nand for ever still. Their power is that of an enduring calm no\r\nstorms can disturb--and is often felt to be more majestical, the more\r\nfurious are the storms. As the tempest-driven clouds are franticly\r\nhurrying to and fro, how serene the summits in the sky! Or if they be\r\nhidden, how peaceful the glimpses of some great mountain’s breast!\r\nThey disregard the hurricane that goes crashing through their old\r\nwoods; the cloud-thunder disturbs not them any more than that of\r\ntheir own cataracts, and the lightnings play for their pastime.\r\nAll minds under any excitation more or less personify mountains.\r\nWhen much moved, that natural process affects all our feelings, as\r\nthe language of passion awakened by such objects vividly declares;\r\nand then we do assuredly conceive of mountains as indued with\r\nlife--however dim and vague the conception may be--and feel their\r\ncharacter in their very names. Utterly strip our ideas of them of all\r\nthat is attached to them as impersonations, and their power is gone.\r\nBut while we are creatures of imagination as well as of reason, will\r\nthose monarchs remain invested with the purple and seated on thrones.\r\n\r\nIn such imaginative moods as these must every one be, far more\r\nfrequently than he is conscious of, and in far higher degrees,\r\nwho, with a cultivated mind and a heart open to the influences of\r\nnature, finds himself, it matters not whether for the first or the\r\nhundredth time, in the Highlands. We fancy the Neophyte wandering,\r\nall by himself, on the “longest day;” rejoicing to think that the\r\nlight will not fail him, when at last the sun must go down, for\r\nthat a starry gloaming will continue its gentle reign till morn. He\r\nthinks but of what he sees, and that is--the mountains. All memories\r\nof any other world but that which encloses him with its still\r\nsublimities, are not excluded merely, but obliterated: his whole\r\nbeing is there! And now he stands on table-land, and with his eyes\r\nsweeps the horizon, bewildered for a while, for it seems chaos all.\r\nBut soon the mighty masses begin arranging themselves into order;\r\nthe confusion insensibly subsides as he comprehends more and more of\r\ntheir magnificent combinations; he discovers centres round which are\r\nassociated altitudes towering afar off; and finally, he feels, and\r\nblesses himself on his felicity, that his good genius has placed him\r\non the very centre of those wondrous assemblages altogether, from\r\nwhich alone he could command an empire of realities, more glorious\r\nfar than was ever empire of dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is a cloudy, but not a stormy day; the clouds occupy but portions\r\nof the sky,--and are they all in slow motion together, or are they\r\nall at rest? Huge shadows stalking along the earth, tell that there\r\nare changes going on in heaven; but to the upward gaze, all seems\r\nhanging there in the same repose; and with the same soft illumination\r\nthe sun to continue shining, a concentration rather than an orb of\r\nlight. All above is beautiful, and the clouds themselves are like\r\ncelestial mountains; but the eye forsakes them, though it sees them\r\nstill, and more quietly now it moves along the pageantry below that\r\nendures for ever--till chained on a sudden by that range of cliffs.\r\n’Tis along them that the giant shadows are stalking--but now they\r\nhave passed by--and the long line of precipice seems to come forward\r\nin the light. To look down from the brink might be terrible--to look\r\nup from the base would be sublime--but fronting the eye thus, horrid\r\nthough it be, the sight is most beautiful;--for weather-stains, and\r\nmosses, and lichens, and flowering-plants--conspicuous most the\r\nbroom and the heather--and shrubs that, among their leaves of light,\r\nhave no need of flowers--and hollies, and birks, and hazels, and\r\nmany a slender tree besides with pensile tresses, besprinkle all the\r\ncliffs, that in no gloom could ever lose their lustre; but now the\r\nday though not bright is fair, and brings out the whole beauty of the\r\nprecipice--call it the hanging garden of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Highlands have been said to be a gloomy region, and worse gloom\r\nthan theirs might well be borne, if not unfrequently illumined\r\nwith such sights as these; but that is not the character of the\r\nmountains, though the purple light in which, for usual, they are so\r\nrichly steeped, is often for a season tamed, or for a short while\r\nextinguished, while a strange night-like day lets fall over them all\r\na something like a shroud. Such days we have seen--but now in fancy\r\nwe are with the pilgrim, and see preparation making for a sunset. It\r\nis drawing towards evening, and the clouds that have all this time\r\nbeen moving, though we knew it not, have assuredly settled now, and\r\ntaken up their rest. The sun has gone down, and all that unspeakable\r\nglory has left the sky. Evening has come and gone without our knowing\r\nthat she had been here; but there is no gloom on any place in the\r\nwhole of this vast wilderness, and the mountains, as they wax dimmer\r\nand dimmer, look as if they were surrendering themselves to a repose\r\nlike sleep. Day had no voice here audible to human ear--but night\r\nis murmuring--and gentle though the murmur be, it filleth the great\r\nvoid, and we imagine that ever and anon it awakens echoes. And now it\r\nis darker than we thought, for lo! one soft-burning star! And we see\r\nthat there are many stars; but not theirs the light that begins again\r\nto reveal object after object as gradually as they had disappeared;\r\nthe moon is about to rise--is rising--has arisen--has taken her\r\nplace high in heaven; and as the glorious world again expands around\r\nus, faintly tinged, clearly illumined, softly shadowed, and deeply\r\nbegloomed, we say within our hearts,\r\n\r\n      “How beautiful is night!”\r\n\r\nThere are many such table-lands as the one we have now been\r\nimagining, and it requires but a slight acquaintance with the country\r\nto conjecture rightly where they lie. Independently of the panoramas\r\nthey display, they are in themselves always impressive; perhaps a\r\nbare level that shows but bleached bent, and scatterings of stones,\r\nwith here and there an unaccountable rock; or hundreds of fairy\r\ngreensward knolls, fringed with tiny forests of fern that have almost\r\ndisplaced the heather; or a wild withered moor or moss intersected\r\nwith pits dug not by men’s hands; and, strange to see! a huge log\r\nlying half exposed, and as if blackened by fire. High as such places\r\nare, on one of them a young gorcock was stricken down by a hawk close\r\nto our feet. Indeed, hawks seem to haunt such places, and we have\r\nrarely crossed one of them, without either seeing the creature’s\r\nstealthy flight, or hearing, whether he be alarmed or preying, his\r\never-angry cry.\r\n\r\nFrom a few such stations, you get an insight into the configuration\r\nof the whole Western Highlands. By the dip of the mountains, you\r\ndiscover at a glance all the openings in the panorama around you into\r\nother regions. Follow your fancies fearlessly wherever they may lead;\r\nand if the blue aërial haze that hangs over a pass winding eastward,\r\ntempt you from your line of march due north, forthwith descend in\r\nthat direction, and haply an omen will confirm you--an eagle rising\r\non the left, and sailing away before you into that very spot of sky.\r\n\r\nNo man, however well read, should travel by book. In books you find\r\ndescriptions, and often good ones, of the most celebrated scenes,\r\nbut seldom a word about the vast tracts between; and it would seem\r\nas if many Tourists had used their eyes only in those places where\r\nthey had been told by common fame there was something greatly to\r\nadmire. Travel in the faith, that go where you will, the cravings\r\nof your heart will be satisfied, and you will find it so, if you be\r\na true lover of nature. You hope to be inspired by her spirit, that\r\nyou may read aright her works. But such inspiration comes not from\r\none object or another, however great or fair, but from the whole\r\n“mighty world of eye and ear,” and it must be supported continuously,\r\nor it perishes. You may see a thousand sights never before seen by\r\nhuman eye, at every step you take, wherever be your path; for no\r\nsteps but yours have ever walked along that same level; and moreover,\r\nnever on the same spot twice rested the same lights or shadows. Then\r\nthere may be something in the air, and more in your own heart, that\r\ninvests every ordinary object with extraordinary beauty; old images\r\naffect you with a new delight; a grandeur grows upon your eyes in the\r\nundulations of the simplest hills; and you feel there is sublimity\r\nin the common skies. It is thus that all the stores of imagery are\r\ninsensibly gathered, with which the minds of men are filled, who\r\nfrom youth have communed with Nature. And it is thus that all those\r\nfeelings have flowed into their hearts by which that imagery is\r\nsanctified; and these are the poets.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that we all become familiar with the Mountains. Far\r\nmore than we were aware of have we trusted to the strong spirit of\r\ndelight within us, to prompt and to guide. And in such a country as\r\nthe Highlands, thus led, we cannot err. Therefore, if your desire be\r\nfor the summits, set your face thitherwards, and wind a way of your\r\nown, still ascending and ascending, along some vast brow, that seems\r\nalmost a whole day’s journey, and where it is lost from your sight,\r\nnot to end, but to go sweeping round, with undiminished grandeur,\r\ninto another region. You are not yet half-way up the mountain, but\r\nyou care not for the summit now; for you find yourself among a number\r\nof green knolls--all of them sprinkled, and some of them crowned,\r\nwith trees--as large almost as our lowland hills--surrounded close\r\nto the brink with the purple heather--and without impairing the\r\nmajesty of the immense expanse, embuing it with pastoral and sylvan\r\nbeauty;--and there, lying in a small forest glade of the lady-fern,\r\nambitious no longer of a throne on Benlomond or Bennevis, you dream\r\naway the still hours till sunset, yet then have no reason to weep\r\nthat you have lost a day.\r\n\r\nBut the best way to view the mountains is to trace the Glens. To find\r\nout the glens you must often scale the shoulders of mountains; and in\r\nsuch journeys of discovery, you have for ever going on before your\r\neyes glorious transfigurations. Sometimes for a whole day one mighty\r\nmass lowers before you unchanged; look at it after the interval of\r\nhours, and still the giant is one and the same. It rules the region,\r\nsubjecting all other altitudes to its sway, though many of them\r\nrange away to a great distance; and at sunset retains its supremacy,\r\nblazing almost like a volcano with fiery clouds. Your line of journey\r\nlies, perhaps, some two thousand feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand seldom dips down to one thousand; and these are the heights from\r\nwhich all above and all below you look most magnificent, for both\r\nregions have their full power over you--the unscaleable cliffs, the\r\nunfathomable abysses--and you know not which is the more sublime. The\r\nsublimity indeed is one. It is then that you may do well to ascend to\r\nthe very mountain top. For it may happen to be one of those heavenly\r\ndays indeed, when the whole Highlands seem to be reposing in the\r\ncloudless sky.\r\n\r\nBut we were about to speak of the Glens. And some of them are best\r\nentered by such descents as these--perhaps at their very head--where\r\nall at once you are in another world, how still, how gloomy, how\r\nprofound! An hour ago and the eye of the eagle had not wider command\r\nof earth, sea, and sky than yours--almost blinded now by the\r\nsuperincumbent precipices that imprison you, and seem to shut you out\r\nfrom life.\r\n\r\n      “Such the grim desolation, where Ben-Hun\r\n      And Craig-na-Torr, by earthquake shatterings\r\n      Disjoined with horrid chasms prerupt, enclose\r\n      What superstition calls the Glen of Ghosts.”\r\n\r\nOr you may enter some great glen from the foot, where it widens into\r\nvale, or strath--and there are many such--and some into which you can\r\nsail up an arm of the sea. For a while it partakes of the cultivated\r\nbeauty of the lowlands, and glen and vale seem almost one and the\r\nsame; but gradually it undergoes a strange wild change of character,\r\nand in a few miles that similitude is lost. There is little or\r\nno arable ground here; but the pasture is rich on the unenclosed\r\nplain--and here and there are enclosures near the few houses or huts\r\nstanding, some of them in the middle of the glen, quite exposed, on\r\neminences above reach of the floods--some more happily placed on the\r\nedge of the coppices, that sprinkle the steep sides of the hills,\r\nyet barely mountains. But mountains they soon become; and leaving\r\nbehind you those few barren habitations, you see before you a wide\r\nblack moor. Beautiful hitherto had been the river, for a river you\r\nhad inclined to think it, long after it had narrowed into a stream,\r\nwith many a waterfall, and in one chasm a cataract. But the torrent\r\nnow has a wild mountain-cry, and though there is still beauty on its\r\nbanks, they are bare of all trees, now swelling into multitudes of\r\nlow green knolls among the heather, now composed but of heather and\r\nrocks. Through the very middle of the black moor it flows, yet are\r\nits waters clear, for all is not moss, and it seems to wind its way\r\nwhere there is nothing to pollute its purity, or tame its lustre.\r\n’Tis a solitary scene, but still sweet; the mountains are of great\r\nmagnitude, but they are not precipitous; vast herds of cattle are\r\nbrowsing there, on heights from which fire has cleared the heather,\r\nand wide ranges of greensward upon the lofty gloom seem to lie in\r\nperpetual light.\r\n\r\nThe moor is crossed, and you prepare to scale the mountain in front,\r\nfor you imagine the torrent by your side flows from a tarn in yonder\r\ncove, and forms that series of waterfalls. You have been all along\r\nwell pleased with the glen, and here at the head, though there is a\r\nwant of cliffs of the highest class, you feel nevertheless that it\r\nhas a character of grandeur. Looking westward, you are astounded to\r\nsee them ranging away on either side of another reach of the glen,\r\nterrific in their height, but in their formation beautiful, for\r\nlike the walls of some vast temple they stand, roofed with sky. Yet\r\nare they but as a portal or gateway of the glen. For entering in\r\nwith awe, that deepens as you advance almost into dread, you behold\r\nbeyond mountains that carry their cliffs up into the clouds, seamed\r\nwith chasms, and hollowed out into coves, where night dwells visibly\r\nby the side of day; and still the glen seems winding on beneath a\r\npurple light, that almost looks like gloom; such vast forms and such\r\nprodigious colours, and such utter stillness, become oppressive\r\nto your very life, and you wish that some human being were by, to\r\nrelieve by his mere presence the insupportable weight of such a\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nBut we should never have done were we to attempt to sketch, however\r\nslightly, the character of all the different kinds of glens. Some\r\nare sublime in their prodigious depth and vast extent, and would\r\nbe felt to be so, even were the mountains that enclose them of no\r\ngreat majesty; but these are all of the highest order, and sometimes\r\nare seen from below to the very cairns on their summits. Now we\r\nwalk along a reach, between astonishing ranges of cliffs, among\r\nlarge heaps of rocks--not a tree--scarcely a shrub--no herbage--the\r\nvery heather blasted--all lifelessness and desolation. The glen\r\ngradually grows less and less horrid, and though its sides are\r\nseamed with clefts and chasms, in the gloom there are places for\r\nthe sunshine, and there is felt to be even beauty in the repose.\r\nDescends suddenly on either side a steep slope of hanging wood, and\r\nwe find ourselves among verdant mounds, and knolls, and waterfalls.\r\nWe come then into what seems of old to have been a forest. Here and\r\nthere a stately pine survives, but the rest are all skeletons; and\r\nnow the glen widens, and widens, yet ceases not to be profound,\r\nfor several high mountains enclose a plain on which armies might\r\nencamp, and castellated clouds hang round the heights of the glorious\r\namphitheatre, while the sky-roof is clear, and, as if in its centre,\r\nthe refulgent sun. ’Tis the plain called “The Meeting of the Glens.”\r\nFrom the east and the west, the north and the south, they come like\r\nrivers into the sea.\r\n\r\nOther glens there are as long, but not so profound, nor so grandly\r\ncomposed; yet they too conduct us nobly in among the mountains, and\r\nup their sides, and on even to their very summits. Such are the\r\nglens of Athole, in the neighbourhood of Ben-y-gloe. From them the\r\nheather is not wholly banished, and the fire has left a green light\r\nwithout quenching the purple colour native to the hills. We think\r\nthat we almost remember the time when those glens were in many places\r\nsprinkled with huts, and all animated with human life. Now they are\r\nsolitary; and you may walk from sunrise till sunset without seeing\r\na single soul. For a hundred thousand acres have there been changed\r\ninto a forest, for sake of the pastime, indeed, which was dear of old\r\nto chieftains and kings. Vast herds of red deer are there, for they\r\nherd in thousands; yet may you wander for days over the boundless\r\nwaste, nor once be startled by one stag bounding by. Yet may a herd,\r\na thousand strong, be drawn up, as in battle array, on the cliffs\r\nabove your head. For they will long stand motionless, at gaze, when\r\ndanger is in the wind; and then their antlers to unpractised eyes\r\nseem but boughs grotesque, or are invisible; and when all at once,\r\nwith one accord, at signal from the stag, whom they obey, they wheel\r\noff towards the corries, you think it but thunder, and look up to the\r\nclouds. Fortunate if you see such a sight once in your life. Once\r\nonly have we seen it; and it was, of a sudden, all by ourselves,\r\n\r\n      “Ere yet the hunter’s startling horn was heard\r\n      Upon the golden hills.”\r\n\r\nAlmost within rifle-shot, the herd occupied a position, high up\r\nindeed, but below several ridges of rocks, running parallel for a\r\nlong distance, with slopes between of sward and heather. Standing\r\nstill, they seemed to extend about a quarter of a mile; and, as with\r\na loud clattering of hoofs and antlers they took more open order,\r\nthe line at least doubled its length, and the whole mountain side\r\nseemed alive. They might not be going at full speed, but the pace was\r\nequal to that of any charge of cavalry; and once and again the flight\r\npassed before us, till it overcame the ridges, and then deploying\r\nround the shoulder of the mountain, disappeared, without dust or\r\nnoise, into the blue light of another glen.\r\n\r\nWe question if there be in the Highlands any one glen comparable with\r\nBorrowdale in Cumberland. But there are several that approach it,\r\nin that combination of beauty and grandeur, which perhaps no other\r\nscene equals in all the world. The “Gorge” of that Dale exhibits the\r\nfinest imaginable assemblage of rocks and rocky hills, all wildly\r\nwooded; beyond them, yet before we have entered into the Dale, the\r\nPass widens, with noble cliffs on one side, and on the other a sylvan\r\nstream, not without its abysses; and we see before us some lovely\r\nhills, on which--\r\n\r\n      “The smiling power of cultivation lies,”\r\n\r\nyet leaves, with lines defined by the steeps that defy the\r\nploughshare, copses and groves; and thus we are brought into\r\nthe Dale itself, and soon have a vision of the whole--green\r\nand golden fields--for though most are in pasture, almost all\r\nseem arable--sprinkled with fine single trees, and lying in\r\nflats and levels, or swelling into mounds and knolls, and all\r\ndiversified with every kind of woods; single cottages, with their\r\nout-buildings, standing everywhere they should stand, and coloured\r\nlike the rocks from which in some lights they are hardly to be\r\ndistinguished--strong-roofed and undilapidated, though many of them\r\nvery old; villages, apart from one another a mile--and there are\r\nthree--yet on their sites, distant and different in much though\r\nthey be, all associated together by the same spirit of beauty that\r\npervades all the Dale. Half way up, and in some places more, the\r\nenclosing hills and even mountains are sylvan indeed, and though\r\nthere be a few inoffensive aliens, they are all adorned with their\r\nnative trees. The mountains are not so high as in our Highlands,\r\nbut they are very majestic; and the passes over into Langdale, and\r\nWastdalehead, and Buttermere, are magnificent, and show precipices in\r\nwhich the Golden Eagle himself might rejoice.\r\n\r\nNo--there is no glen in all the Highlands comparable with Borrowdale.\r\nYet we know of some that are felt to be kindred places, and their\r\nbeauty, though less, almost as much affects us, because though\r\ncontending, as it were, with the darker spirit of the mountain, it\r\nis not overcome, but prevails; and their beauty will increase with\r\nyears. For while the rocks continue to frown aloft for ever, and the\r\ncliffs to range along the corries, unbroken by trees, which there\r\nthe tempests will not suffer to rise, the woods and groves below,\r\npreserved from the axe, for sake of their needful shelter, shall\r\nbecome statelier till the birch equal the pine; reclaimed from the\r\nwaste, shall many a fresh field recline among the heather, tempering\r\nthe gloom; and houses arise where now there are but huts, and every\r\nhouse have its garden:--such changes are now going on, and we have\r\nbeen glad to observe their progress, even though sometimes they had\r\nremoved, or were removing, objects dear from old associations, and\r\nwhich, had it been possible, but it was not, we should have loved to\r\nsee preserved.\r\n\r\nAnd one word on those sweet pastoral seclusions into which one\r\noften drops unexpectedly, it may be at the close of day, and finds\r\na night’s lodging in the lonely hut. Yet they lie, sometimes,\r\nembosomed, in their own green hills, among the most rugged mountains,\r\nand even among the wildest moors. They have no features by which you\r\ncan describe them: it is their serenity that charms you, and their\r\ncheerful peace; perhaps it is wrong to call them glens, and they are\r\nbut dells. Yet one thinks of a dell as deep, however small it may be;\r\nbut these are not deep, for the hills slope down gently upon them,\r\nand leave room perhaps between for a little shallow loch. Often they\r\nhave not any visible water at all, only a few springs and rivulets,\r\nand you wonder to see them so very green; there is no herbage like\r\ntheirs; and to such spots of old, and sometimes yet, the kine are\r\nled in summer, and there the lonely family live in their shieling\r\ntill the harvest moon.\r\n\r\nWe have all along used the same word, and called the places we have\r\nspoken of--glens. A fine observer--the editor of _Gilpin’s Forest\r\nScenery_--has said: “The gradation from extreme width downwards\r\nshould be thus arranged--strath, vale, dale, valley, glen, dell,\r\nravine, chasm. In the strath, vale, and dale, we may expect to\r\nfind the large, majestic, gently flowing river, or even the deeper\r\nor smaller lake. In the glen, if the river be large, it flows\r\nmore rapidly, and with greater variety. In the dell, the stream\r\nis smaller. In the ravine, we find the mountain torrent and the\r\nwaterfall. In the chasm, we find the roaring cataract, or the rill,\r\nbursting from its haunted fountain. The chasm discharges its small\r\ntribute into the ravine, while the ravine is tributary to the dell,\r\nand thence to the glen; and the glen to the dale.”\r\n\r\nThese distinctions are admirably expressed, and perfectly true to\r\nnature; yet we doubt if it would be possible to preserve them in\r\ndescribing a country, and assuredly they are very often indeed\r\nconfused by common use in the naming of places. We have said nothing\r\nabout straths--nor shall we try to describe one--but suggest to your\r\nown imagination as specimens, Strath-Spey, Strath-Tay, Strath-Earn.\r\nThe dominion claimed by each of those rivers, within the mountain\r\nranges that environ their courses, is a strath; and three noble\r\nstraths they are, from source to sea.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are brought to speak of the Highland rivers, streams,\r\nand torrents; but we shall let them rush or flow, murmur or\r\nthunder, in your own ears, for you cannot fail to imagine what\r\nthe waters must be in a land of such glens, and such mountains.\r\nThe chief rivers possess all the attributes essential to\r\ngreatness--width--depth--clearness--rapidity--in one word, power.\r\nAnd some of them have long courses--rising in the central heights,\r\nand winding round many a huge projection, against which in flood we\r\nhave seen them dashing like the sea. Highland droughts are not of\r\nlong duration; the supplies are seldom withheld at once by all the\r\ntributaries; and one wild night among the mountains converts a calm\r\ninto a commotion--the many-murmuring voice into one roar. In flood\r\nthey are terrible to look at; and every whirlpool seems a place of\r\ntorment. Winds can make a mighty noise in swinging woods, but there\r\nis something to our ears more appalling in that of the fall of\r\nwaters. Let them be united--and add thunder from the clouds--and we\r\nhave heard in the Highlands all three in one--and the auditor need\r\nnot care that he has never stood by Niagara. But when “though not\r\no’er-flowing full,” a Highland river is in perfection; far better do\r\nwe love to see and hear him rejoicing than raging; his attributes\r\nappear more his own in calm and majestic manifestations, and as he\r\nglides or rolls on, without any disturbance, we behold in him an\r\nimage at once of power and peace.\r\n\r\nOf rivers--comparatively speaking, of the second and third order--the\r\nHighlands are full--and on some of them the sylvan scenery is beyond\r\ncompare. No need there to go hunting the waterfalls. Hundreds of\r\nthem--some tiny indeed, but others tall--are for ever dinning in the\r\nwoods; yet, at a distance from the cataract, how sweet and quiet is\r\nthe sound! It hinders you not from listening to the cushat’s voice;\r\nclear amidst the mellow murmur comes the bleating from the mountain;\r\nand all other sound ceases, as you hearken in the sky to the hark\r\nof the eagle--rare indeed anywhere, but sometimes to be heard as\r\nyou thread the “glimmer or the gloom” of the umbrage overhanging\r\nthe Garry or the Tummel--for he used to build in the cliffs of\r\nBen-Brackie, and if he has shifted his eyrie, a few minutes’ waftage\r\nwill bear him to Cairn-Gower.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the glens, we but alluded to the rivers or streams,\r\nand some of them, indeed, even the great ones, have but rivulets;\r\nwhile in the greatest, the waters often flow on without a single\r\ntree, shadowed but by rocks and clouds. Wade them, and you find they\r\nare larger than they seem to be; for looked at along the bottom of\r\nthose profound hollows, they are but mere slips of sinuous light\r\nin the sunshine, and in the gloom you see them not at all. We do\r\nnot remember any very impressive glen, without a stream, that would\r\nnot suffer some diminution of its power by our fancying it to have\r\none; we may not be aware, at the time, that the conformation of the\r\nglen prevents its having any waterflow, if but we feel its character\r\naright, that want is among the causes of our feeling; just as there\r\nare some scenes of which the beauty would not be so touching were\r\nthere a single tree.\r\n\r\nThousands and tens of thousands there are of nameless perennial\r\ntorrents, and “in number without number numberless” those that seldom\r\nlive a week--perhaps not a day. Up among the loftiest regions you\r\nhear nothing, even when they are all aflow; yet, there is music in\r\nthe sight, and the thought of the “general dance and minstrelsy”\r\nenlivens the air, where no insect hums. As on your descent you come\r\nwithin hearing of the “liquid lapses,” your heart leaps within you,\r\nso merrily do they sing; the first torrent-rill you meet with you\r\ntake for your guide, and it leads you perhaps into some fairy dell,\r\nwhere it wantons awhile in waterfalls, and then, gliding along a\r\nlittle dale of its own with “banks of green bracken,” finishes its\r\nshort course in a stream--one of many that meet and mingle before\r\nthe current takes the name of river, which in a mile or less becomes\r\na small woodland lake. There are many such of rememberable beauty;\r\nliving lakes indeed, for they are but pausings of expanded rivers,\r\nwhich again soon pursue their way, and the water-lilies have ever a\r\ngentle motion there as if touched by a tide.\r\n\r\nIt used, not very long ago, to be pretty generally believed by our\r\nsouthern brethren, that there were few trees in the Lowlands of\r\nScotland, and none at all in the Highlands. They had an obscure\r\nnotion that trees either could not or would not grow in such a soil\r\nand climate--cold and bleak enough at times and places, heaven\r\nknows--yet not altogether unproductive of diverse stately plants.\r\nThey know better now; nor were we ever angry with their ignorance,\r\nwhich was nothing more than what was to be expected in persons living\r\nperpetually at home so far remote. They rejoice now to visit, and\r\nsojourn, and travel here among us, foreigners and a foreign land\r\nno more; and we rejoice to see and receive them not as strangers,\r\nbut friends, and are proud to know they are well pleased to behold\r\nour habitation. They do us and our country justice now, and we\r\nhave sometimes thought even more than justice; for they are lost in\r\nadmiration of our cities--above all, of Edinburgh--and speak with\r\nsuch raptures of our scenery, that they would appear to prefer it\r\neven to their own. They are charmed with our bare green hills, with\r\nour shaggy brown mountains they are astonished, our lochs are their\r\ndelight, our woods their wonder, and they hold up their hands and\r\nclap them at our cliffs. This is generous, for we are not blind to\r\nthe fact of England being the most beautiful land on all the earth.\r\nWhat are our woods to hers! To hers, what are our single trees!\r\nWe have no such glorious standards to show as her indomitable and\r\neverlasting oaks. She is all over sylvan--Scotland but here and\r\nthere; look on England from any point in any place, and you see she\r\nis rich, from almost any point in any place in Scotland, and you\r\nfeel that comparatively she is poor. Yet our Lowlands have long\r\nbeen beautifying themselves into a resemblance of hers; as for our\r\nHighlands, though many changes have been going on there too, and most\r\nwe believe for good, they are in their great features, and in their\r\nspirit unalterable by art, stamped and inspired by enduring Nature.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken, slightly, of the sylvan scenery of the Highlands. In\r\nPerthshire, especially, it is of rare and extraordinary beauty, and\r\nwe are always glad to hear of Englishmen travelling up the Tay and\r\nthe Earn. We desire that eyes familiar with all that is umbrageous\r\nshould receive their first impressions of our Scottish trees at\r\nDuneira and Dunkeld. Nor will those impressions be weakened as they\r\nproceed towards Blair Athole. In that famous Pass they will feel\r\nthe power possessed by the sweet wild monotony of the universal\r\nbirch woods--broken but by grey crags in every shape--grotesque,\r\nfantastical, majestic, magnificent, and sublime--on the many-ridged\r\nmountains, that are loth to lose the green light of their beloved\r\nforests, retain it as long as they can, and on the masses of living\r\nlustre seem to look down with pride from their skies.\r\n\r\nAn English forest, meaning thereby any one wide continuous scene of\r\nall kinds of old English trees, with glades of pasture, and it may\r\nbe of heath between, with dells dipping down into the gloom, and\r\nhillocks undulating in the light--ravines and chasms too, rills,\r\nand rivulets, and a haunted stream, and not without some melancholy\r\nold ruins, and here and there a cheerful cottage that feels not the\r\ntouch of time--such a forest there is not, and hardly can be imagined\r\nto be in Scotland. But in the Highlands, there once were, and are\r\nstill, other forests of quite a different character, and of equal\r\ngrandeur. In his _Forest Scenery_, Gilpin shows that he understood\r\nit well; all the knowledge, which as a stranger, almost of necessity\r\nhe wanted, Lauder has supplied in his annotations; and the book\r\nshould now be in the hands of every one who cares about the woods.\r\n“The English forest,” says Gilpin, “is commonly composed of woodland\r\nviews, interspersed with extensive heaths and lawns. Its trees are\r\noak and beech, whose lively green corresponds better than the gloomy\r\npine with the nature of the scene, which seldom assumes the dignity\r\nof a mountain one, but generally exhibits a cheerful landscape. It\r\naspires, indeed, to grandeur; but its grandeur does not depend,\r\nlike that of the Scottish forest, on the sublimity of the objects,\r\nbut on the vastness of the whole--the extent of its woods and the\r\nwildness of its plains. In its inhabitants also the English forest\r\ndiffers from the Scottish; instead of the stag and the roebuck, it\r\nis frequented by cattle and fallow-deer, and exchanges the scream of\r\nthe eagle and the falcon for the crowing of pheasants and the melody\r\nof the nightingale. The Scottish forest, no doubt, is the sublimer\r\nscene, and speaks to the imagination in a loftier language than\r\nthe English forest can reach. The latter, indeed, often rouses the\r\nimagination, but seldom in so great a degree, being generally content\r\nwith captivating the eye. The scenery, too, of the Scottish forest\r\nis better calculated to last through ages than that of the English.\r\nThe woods of both are almost destroyed. But while the English forest\r\nhath lost all its beauty with its oaks, and becomes only a desolate\r\nwaste, the rocks and the mountains, the lakes and the torrents, of\r\nthe Scottish forest make it still an interesting scene.”\r\n\r\nThe tree of the Highlands is the pine. There are Scotch firs,\r\nindeed, well worth looking at, in the Lowlands, and in England; but\r\nto learn their true character you must see them in the glen, among\r\nrocks, by the river side, and on the mountain. “We, for our parts,”\r\nsays Lauder, very finely, “confess that when we have seen it towering\r\nin full majesty in the midst of some appropriate Highland scene,\r\nand sending its limbs abroad with all unrestrained freedom of a\r\nhardy mountaineer, as if it claimed dominion over the savage region\r\nround it, we have looked upon it as a very sublime object. People\r\nwho have not seen it in native climate and soil, and who judge of\r\nit from the wretched abortions which are swaddled and suffocated in\r\nEnglish plantations, among dark, heavy, and eternally wet clays, may\r\nwell be called a wretched tree; but when its foot is among its own\r\nHighland heather, and when it stands freely in its native knoll of\r\ndry gravel, or thinly-covered rock, over which its roots wander afar\r\nin the wildest reticulation, whilst its tall, furrowed, and often\r\ngracefully-sweeping red and grey trunk, of enormous circumference,\r\nrears aloft its high umbrageous canopy, then would the greatest\r\nsceptic on this point be compelled to prostrate his mind before it\r\nwith a veneration which perhaps was never before excited in him by\r\nany other tree.” The colour of the pine has been objected to as\r\nmurky, and murky it often is, or seems to be; and so then is the\r\ncolour of the heather, and of the river, and of the loch, and of the\r\nsky itself thunder-laden, and murkiest of all are the clouds. But a\r\nstream of sunshine is let loose, and the gloom is confounded with\r\nglory; over all that night-like reign the jocund day goes dancing,\r\nand the forest revels in green or in golden light. Thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of trees are there; and as you gaze upon the whole\r\nmighty array, you fear lest it might break the spell, to fix your\r\ngaze on any one single tree. But there are trees there that will\r\nforce you to look on themselves alone, and they grow before your\r\neyes into the kings of the forest. Straight stand their stems in\r\nthe sunshine, and you feel that as straight have they stood in the\r\nstorm. As yet you look not up, for your heart is awed, and you see\r\nbut the stately columns reddening away into the gloom. But all the\r\nwhile you feel the power of the umbrage aloft, and when thitherwards\r\nyou lift your eyes, what a roof to such a cathedral! A cone drops at\r\nyour feet--nor other sound nor other stir--but afar off you think you\r\nhear a cataract. Inaudible your footsteps on the soft yellow floor,\r\ncomposed of the autumnal sheddings of countless years. Then it is\r\ntrue that you can indeed hear the beating of your own heart; you\r\nfear, but know not what you fear; and being the only living creature\r\nthere, you are impressed with a thought of death. But soon to that\r\nsevere silence you are more than reconciled; the solitude, without\r\nceasing to be sublime, is felt to be solemn and not awful, and ere\r\nlong, utter as it is, serene. Seen from afar, the forest was one\r\nblack mass; but as you advance, it opens up into spacious glades,\r\nbeautiful as gardens, with appropriate trees of gentler tribes, and\r\nground-flowering in the sun. But there is no murmur of bee--no song\r\nof bird. In the air a thin whisper of insects--intermittent--and\r\nwafted quite away by a breath. For we are now in the very centre of\r\nthe forest, and even the cushat haunts not here. Hither the red deer\r\nmay come--but not now--for at this season they love the hill. To such\r\nplaces the stricken stag might steal to lie down and die.\r\n\r\nAnd thus for hours may you be lost in the forest, nor all the\r\nwhile have wasted one thought on the outer world, till with no\r\nother warning but an uncertain glimmer and a strange noise, you\r\nall at once issue forth into the open day, and are standing on the\r\nbrink of a precipice above a flood. It comes tumbling down with a\r\nsuccession of falls, in a mile-long course, right opposite your\r\nstance--rocks, cliffs, and trees, all the way up on either side,\r\nmajestically retiring back to afford ample channel, and showing an\r\nunobstructed vista, closed up by the purple mountain, that seems to\r\nsend forth the river from a cavern in its breast. ’Tis the Glen of\r\nPines. Nor ash nor oak is suffered to intrude on their dominion.\r\nSince the earthquake first shattered it out, this great chasm, with\r\nall its chasms, has been held by one race of trees. No other seed\r\ncould there spring to life; for from the rocks has all soil, ages\r\nago, been washed and swept by the tempests. But there they stand\r\nwith glossy boles, spreading arms, and glittering crest; and those\r\ntwo by themselves on the summit, known all over Badenoch as “the\r\nGiants”--“their statures reach the sky.”\r\n\r\nWe have been indulging in a dream of old. Before our day the\r\nimmemorial gloom of Glenmore had perished, and it ceased to be a\r\nforest. But there bordered on it another region of night or twilight,\r\nand in its vast depths we first felt the sublimity of lonesome\r\nfear. Rothiemurchus! The very word blackens before our eyes with\r\nnecromantic characters--again we plunge into its gulphs desirous of\r\nwhat we dread--again “in pleasure high and turbulent,” we climb the\r\ncliffs of Cairngorm.\r\n\r\nWould you wish to know what is now the look of Glenmore? One now\r\ndead and gone--a man of wayward temper, but of genius--shall tell\r\nyou--and think not the picture exaggerated--for you would not, if you\r\nwere _there_. “It is the wreck of the ancient forest which arrests\r\nall the attention, and which renders Glenmore a melancholy--more\r\nthan a melancholy--a terrific spectacle. Trees of enormous height,\r\nwhich have escaped alike the axe and the tempest, are still standing,\r\nstripped by the winds even of the bark, and like gigantic skeletons,\r\nthrowing far and wide their white and bleached bones to the storms\r\nand rains of heaven; while others, broken by the violence of the\r\ngales, lift up their split and fractured trunks in a thousand shapes\r\nof resistance and of destruction, or still display some knotted and\r\ntortuous branches, stretched out, in sturdy and fantastic forms of\r\ndefiance, to the whirlwind and the winter. Noble trunks also, which\r\nhad long resisted, but resisted in vain, strew the ground; some\r\nlying on the declivity where they have fallen, others still adhering\r\nto the precipice where they were rooted, many upturned, with their\r\ntwisted and entangled roots high in air; while not a few astonish us\r\nby the space which they cover, and by dimensions which we could not\r\notherwise have estimated. It is one wide image of death, as if the\r\nangel of destruction had passed over the valley. The sight, even of\r\na felled tree, is painful: still more is that of the fallen forest,\r\nwith all its green branches on the ground, withering, silent, and at\r\nrest, where once they glittered in the dew and the sun, and trembled\r\nin the breeze. Yet this is but an image of vegetable death. It is\r\nfamiliar, and the impression passes away. It is the naked skeleton\r\nbleaching in the winds, the gigantic bones of the forest still erect,\r\nthe speaking records of former life and of strength still unsubdued,\r\nvigorous even in death, which renders Glenmore one enormous charnel\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nWhat happened of old to the aboriginal forests of Scotland, that\r\nlong before these later destructions they had almost all perished,\r\nleaving to bear witness what they were, such survivors? They were\r\nchiefly destroyed by fire. What power could extinguish chance-kindled\r\nconflagrations when sailing before the wind? And no doubt fire\r\nwas set to clear the country at once of Scotch firs, wolves, wild\r\nboars, and outlaws. Tradition yet tells of such burnings; and, if we\r\nmistake not, the pines found in the Scottish mosses, the logs and the\r\nstocks, all show that they were destroyed by Vulcan, though Neptune\r\nburied them in the quagmires. Storms no doubt often levelled them by\r\nthousands; but had millions so fallen they had never been missed, and\r\none element only--which has been often fearfully commissioned--could\r\nachieve the work. In our own day the axe has indeed done wonders--and\r\nsixteen square miles of the forest of Rothiemurchus “went to the\r\nground.” John of Ghent, Gilpin tells us, to avenge an inroad, set\r\ntwenty-four thousand axes at work in the Caledonian Forest.\r\n\r\nYet Scotland has perhaps sufficient forest at this day. For more has\r\nbeen planted than cut down; Glenmore will soon be populous as ever\r\nwith self-sown pines, and Rothiemurchus may revive; the shades are\r\nyet deeper of Loch Arkaig, Glengarry, Glenmoriston, Strathglass,\r\nGlen Strathfarrar, and Loch-Shiel; deeper still on the Findhorn--and\r\ndeepest of all on the Dee rejoicing in the magnificent pine woods of\r\nInvercauld and Braemar.\r\n\r\nWe feel that we have spoken feebly of our Highland forests. Some\r\nperhaps, who have never been off the high roads, may accuse us of\r\nexaggeration too; but they contain wondrous beauties of which we have\r\nsaid not a word; and no imagination can conceive what they may be in\r\nanother hundred years. But, apparently far apart from the forests,\r\nthough still belonging to them--for they hold in fancy by the tenure\r\nof the olden time--how many woods, and groves, and sprinklings of\r\nfair trees, rise up during a day’s journey, in almost every region of\r\nthe North! And among them all, it may be, scarcely a pine. For the\r\noak, and the ash, and the elm, are also all native trees; nowhere\r\nelse does the rowan flush with more dazzling lustre; in spring, the\r\nalder with its vivid green stands well beside the birk--the yew was\r\nnot neglected of yore, though the bow of the Celt was weak to that of\r\nthe Saxon; and the holly, in winter emulating the brightness of the\r\npine, flourished, and still flourishes on many a mountain side. There\r\nis sufficient sylvan scenery for beauty in a land of mountains. More\r\nmay be needed for shelter--but let the young plants and seedlings\r\nhave time to grow--and as for the old trees, may they live for ever.\r\nToo many millions of larches are perhaps growing now behind the Tay\r\nand the Tilt; yet why should the hills of Perthshire be thought to be\r\ndisfigured by what ennobles the Alps and the Apennines?\r\n\r\nHitherto we have hardly said a word about Lochs, and have been doing\r\nour best to forget them, while imagining scenes that were chiefly\r\ncharacterised by other great features of Highland Landscape. A\r\ncountry thus constituted, and with such an aspect, even if we could\r\nsuppose it without lochs, would still be a glorious region; but its\r\nlochs are indeed its greatest glory; by them its glens, its mountains\r\nand its woods are all illumined, and its rivers made to sing aloud\r\nfor joy. In the pure element, overflowing so many spacious vales\r\nand glens profound, the great and stern objects of nature look even\r\nmore sublime or more beautiful, in their reflected shadows, which\r\nappear in that stillness to belong rather to heaven than earth. Or\r\nthe evanescence of all that imagery at a breath may touch us with the\r\nthought that all it represents, steadfast as seems its endurance,\r\nwill as utterly pass away. Such visions, when gazed on in that\r\nwondrous depth and purity they are sometimes seen to assume, on a\r\nstill summer day, always inspire some such faint feeling as this; and\r\nwe sigh to think how transitory must be all things, when the setting\r\nsun is seen to sink beneath the mountain, and all its golden pomp at\r\nthe same instant to evanish from the lake.\r\n\r\nThe first that takes possession of the imagination, dreaming of the\r\nHighlands as the region of lochs, is the Queen of them all, Loch\r\nLomond. Wordsworth has said, that “in Scotland, the proportion of\r\ndiffused water is often too great, as at the Lake of Geneva, for\r\ninstance, and in most of the Scottish lakes. No doubt it sounds\r\nmagnificent, and flatters the imagination, to hear at a distance of\r\nmasses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width; and\r\nsuch ample room may be delightful to the fresh-water sailor, scudding\r\nwith a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery. But who ever\r\ntravelled along the banks of Loch Lomond, variegated as the lower\r\npart is by islands, without feeling that a speedier termination\r\nof the long vista of blank water would be acceptable, and without\r\nwishing for an interposition of green meadows, trees, and cottages,\r\nand a sparkling stream to run by his side. In fact, a notion of\r\ngrandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste\r\ninto a general mistake upon this subject. It is much more desirable\r\nfor the purposes of pleasure, that lakes should be numerous and small\r\nor middle-sized than large, not only for communication by walks and\r\nrides, but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances. To\r\nillustrate this by one instance: how pleasing is it to have a ready\r\nand frequent opportunity of watching, at the outlet of a lake, the\r\nstream, pushing its way among the rocks, in lively contrast with\r\nthe stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare\r\nits noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the\r\nbreezes that may be starting up, or wandering here and there over the\r\nfaintly-rippled surface of the broad water! I may add, as a general\r\nremark, that in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly\r\nseen at the same time; and therefore contribute little to mutual\r\nillustration and ornament; and if the opposite shores are out of\r\nsight of each other, like those of the American and Asiatic lakes,\r\nthen unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object;\r\nhe has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and\r\naccompanying sense of power.”\r\n\r\nWe shall not be suspected of an inclination to dissent, on light\r\ngrounds, from any sentiments of Wordsworth. But finely felt and\r\nexpressed as all this is, we do not hesitate to say that it is\r\nnot applicable to Loch Lomond. Far be it from us to criticise\r\nthis passage sentence by sentence; for we have quoted it not in a\r\ncaptious, but in a reverent spirit, as we have ever done with the\r\nworks of this illustrious man. He has studied nature more widely and\r\nprofoundly than we have; but it is out of our power to look on Loch\r\nLomond without a feeling of perfection. The “diffusion of water”\r\nis indeed great; but in what a world it floats! At first sight of\r\nit, how our soul expands! The sudden revelation of such majestic\r\nbeauty, wide as it is and extending afar, inspires us with a power\r\nof comprehending it all. Sea-like, indeed, it is--a Mediterranean\r\nSea--enclosed with lofty hills and as lofty mountains--and these,\r\nindeed, are the Fortunate Isles! We shall not dwell on the feeling\r\nwhich all must have experienced on the first sight of such a\r\nvision--the feeling of a lovely and a mighty calm; it is manifest\r\nthat the spacious “diffusion of water” more than conspires with the\r\nother components of such a scene to produce the feeling; that to it\r\nbelongs the spell that makes our spirit serene, still, and bright as\r\nits own. Nor when such feeling ceases so entirely to possess, and so\r\ndeeply to affect us, does the softened and subdued charm of the scene\r\nbefore us depend less on the expanse of the “diffusion of water.” The\r\nislands, that before had lain we knew not how--or we had only felt\r\nthat they were all most lovely--begin to show themselves in the order\r\nof their relation to one another and to the shores. The eye rests on\r\nthe largest, and with them the lesser combine; or we look at one or\r\ntwo of the least, away by themselves, or remote from all a tufted\r\nrock; and many as they are, they break not the breadth of the liquid\r\nplain, for it is ample as the sky. They show its amplitude; as masses\r\nand sprinklings of clouds, and single clouds, show the amplitude of\r\nthe cerulean vault. And then the long promontories--stretching out\r\nfrom opposite mainlands, and enclosing bays that in themselves are\r\nlakes--they too magnify the empire of water; for long as they are,\r\nthey seem so only as our eye attends them with their cliffs and woods\r\nfrom the retiring shores, and far distant are their shadows from\r\nthe central light. Then what shores! On one side, where the lake\r\nis widest, low-lying they seem and therefore lovelier--undulating\r\nwith fields and groves, where many a pleasant dwelling is embowered,\r\ninto lines of hills that gradually soften away into another land. On\r\nthe other side, sloping back, or overhanging, mounts beautiful in\r\ntheir barrenness, for they are green as emerald; others, scarcely\r\nmore beautiful, studded with fair trees--some altogether woods. They\r\nsoon form into mountains--and the mountains become more and more\r\nmajestical, yet beauty never deserts them, and her spirit continues\r\nto tame that of the frowning cliffs. Far off as they are, Benlomond\r\nand Benvoirlich are seen to be giants; magnificent is their retinue,\r\nbut the two are supreme, each in his own dominion; and clear as the\r\nday is here, they are diademed with clouds.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be that the “proportion of diffused water is here too\r\ngreat;” and is it then true that no one “ever travelled along the\r\nbanks of Loch Lomond, variegated as the lower part is by islands,\r\nwithout feeling that a speedier termination to the long vista\r\nof blank water would be acceptable, and without wishing for an\r\ninterposition of green meadows, trees and cottages, and a sparkling\r\nstream to run by his side?” We have travelled along them in all\r\nweathers, and never felt such a wish. For there they all are--all\r\nbut the “sparkling stream to run by our side,” and we see not how\r\nthat well could be in nature. “Streams that sparkle as they run,”\r\ncross our path on their own; and brighter never issued from the\r\nwoods. Along the margin of the water, as far as Luss--ay, and much\r\nfarther--the variations of the foreground are incessant; “had it no\r\nother beauties,” it has been truly said, “but those of its shores,\r\nit would still be an object of prime attraction; whether from the\r\nbright green meadows sprinkled with luxuriant ash-trees, that\r\nsometimes skirt its margin, or its white pebbled shores on which its\r\ngentle billows murmur, like a miniature ocean, or its bold rocky\r\npromontories rising from the dark water rich in wild-flowers and\r\nferns, and tangled with wild roses and honey-suckles, or its retired\r\nbays where the waves dash, reflecting, like a mirror, the trees\r\nwhich hang over them, an inverted landscape.” The islands are for\r\never arranging themselves into new forms, every one more and more\r\nbeautiful; at least so they seem to be, perpetually occurring, yet\r\nalways unexpected, and there is a pleasure even in such a series\r\nof slight surprises that enhances the delight of admiration. And\r\nalongside, or behind us, all the while, are the sylvan mountains,\r\n“laden with beauty;” and ever and anon open glens widen down upon us\r\nfrom chasms; or forest glades lead our hearts away into the inner\r\ngloom--perhaps our feet; and there, in a field that looks not as if\r\nit had been cleared by his own hands, but left clear by nature, a\r\nwoodsman’s hut.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between Luss and Tarbet the water narrows, but it is still\r\nwide; the new road, we believe, winds round the point of Firkin, the\r\nold road boldly scaled the height, as all old roads loved to do;\r\nascend it, and bid the many-isled vision, in all its greatest glory,\r\nfarewell. Thence upwards prevails the spirit of the mountains. The\r\nlake is felt to belong to them--to be subjected to their will--and\r\nthat is capricious; for sometimes they suddenly blacken it when\r\nat its brightest, and sometimes when its gloom is like that of\r\nthe grave, as if at their bidding, all is light. We cannot help\r\nattributing the “skiey influences” which occasion such wonderful\r\neffects on the water, to prodigious mountains; for we cannot look on\r\nthem without feeling that they reign over the solitude they compose;\r\nthe lights and shadows flung by the sun and the clouds imagination\r\nassuredly regards as put forth by the vast objects which they colour;\r\nand we are inclined to think some such belief is essential in the\r\nprofound awe, often amounting to dread, with which we are inspired\r\nby the presences of mere material forms. But be this as it may, the\r\nupper portion of Loch Lomond is felt by all to be most sublime. Near\r\nthe head, all the manifold impressions of the beautiful which for\r\nhours our mind had been receiving, begin to fade; if some gloomy\r\nchange has taken place in the air, there is a total obliteration, and\r\nthe mighty scene before us is felt to possess not the hour merely,\r\nbut the day. Yet should sunshine come, and abide a while, beauty will\r\nglimpse upon us even here, for green pastures will smile vividly,\r\nhigh up among the rocks; the sylvan spirit is serene the moment it\r\nis touched with light, and here there is not only many a fair tree\r\nby the water-side, but yon old oak wood will look joyful on the\r\nmountain, and the gloom become glimmer in the profound abyss.\r\n\r\nWordsworth says, that “it must be more desirable, for the purposes of\r\npleasure, that lakes should be numerous, and small or middle-sized,\r\nthan large, not only for communication by walks and rides, but for\r\nvariety, and for recurrence of similar appearances.” The Highlands\r\nhave them of all sizes--and that surely is best. But here is one\r\nwhich, it has been truly said, is not only “incomparable in its\r\nbeauty as in its dimensions, exceeding all others in variety as it\r\ndoes in extent and splendour, but unites in itself every style of\r\nscenery which is found in the other lakes of the Highlands.” He\r\nwho has studied, and understood, and felt all Loch Lomond, will be\r\nprepared at once to enjoy any other fine lake he looks on; nor will\r\nhe admire nor love it the less, though its chief character should\r\nconsist in what forms but one part of that of the Wonder in which all\r\nkinds of beauty and sublimity are combined.\r\n\r\nWe feel that it would be idle, and worse than idle, to describe any\r\nnumber of the Highland lochs, for so many of the finest have been\r\nseen by so many eyes, that few persons probably will ever read these\r\npages to whom such descriptions would be, at the best, more than\r\nshadowings of scenery that their own imaginations can more vividly\r\nrecreate.\r\n\r\nWe may be allowed, however, to say, that there cannot be a greater\r\nmistake than to think, as many we believe do who have only heard of\r\nthe Highland lochs, that, with the exception of those famous for\r\ntheir beauty as well as their grandeur, beauty is not only not the\r\nquality by which they are distinguished, but that it is rarely found\r\nin them at all. There are few, possessing any very marked character,\r\nin which beauty is not either an ingredient or an accompaniment; and\r\nthere are many “beautiful exceedingly” which, lying out of the way\r\neven of somewhat adventurous travellers, or very remote, are known,\r\nif even by that, only by name. It does not, indeed, require much,\r\nin some situations, to give a very touching beauty to water. A few\r\ntrees, a few knolls, a few tufted rocks, will do it, where all around\r\nand above is stern or sterile; and how strong may be the gentle\r\ncharm, if the torrent that feeds the little loch chance to flow into\r\nit from a lucid pool formed by a waterfall, and to flow out of it\r\nin a rivulet that enlivens the dark heather with a vale of verdure\r\nover which a stag might bound--and more especially if there be two or\r\nthree huts in which it is perceived there is human life! We believe\r\nwe slightly touched before on such scenes; but any little repetition\r\nwill be excused for the sake of a very picturesque passage, which\r\nwe have much pleasure in quoting from the very valuable _Guide to\r\nthe Highlands and Islands of Scotland_, by the brothers Anderson. We\r\nwell remember walking into the scene here so well painted, many long\r\nyears ago, and have indeed, somewhere or other, described it. The\r\nFall of Foyers is the most magnificent cataract, out of all sight\r\nand hearing, in Britain. The din is quite loud enough in ordinary\r\nweather--and it is only in ordinary weather that you can approach\r\nthe place, from which you have a full view of all its grandeur.\r\nWhen the Fall is in flood--to say nothing of being drenched to the\r\nskin--you are so blinded by the sharp spray smoke, and so deafened\r\nby the dashing and clashing, and tumbling and rumbling thunder, that\r\nyour condition is far from enviable, as you cling, “lonely lover of\r\nnature,” to a shelf by no means eminent for safety, above the horrid\r\ngulf. Nor in former times was there any likelihood of your being\r\ncomforted by the accommodations of the General’s Hut. In ordinary\r\nHighland weather--meaning thereby weather neither very wet nor very\r\ndry--it is worth walking a thousand miles for one hour to behold\r\nthe Fall of Foyers. The spacious cavity is enclosed by “complicated\r\ncliffs and perpendicular precipices” of immense height; and though\r\nfor a while it wears to the eye a savage aspect, yet beauty fears\r\nnot to dwell even there, and the horror is softened by what appears\r\nto be masses of tall shrubs, or single shrubs almost like trees. And\r\nthey are trees, which on the level plain would look even stately; but\r\nas they ascend ledge above ledge the walls of that awful chasm, it\r\ntakes the eye time to see them as they really are, while on our first\r\ndiscernment of their character, serenely standing among the tumult,\r\nthey are felt on such sites to be sublime.\r\n\r\n“Between the Falls and the Strath of Stratherrik,” says the book\r\nwe were about to quote, “a space of three or four miles, the river\r\nFoyers flows through a series of low rocky hills clothed with birch.\r\nThey present various quiet glades and open spaces, where little\r\npatches of cultivated ground are encircled by wooded hillocks, whose\r\nsurface is pleasingly diversified by nodding trees, bare rocks,\r\nempurpled heath, and bracken bearing herbage.” It was the excessive\r\nloveliness of some of the scenery there that suggested to us the\r\nthought of going to look what kind of a stream the Foyers was above\r\nthe Fall. We went, and in the quiet of a summer evening, found it\r\n\r\n      “Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.”\r\n\r\nBut here is the promised description of it:--“Before pursuing our\r\nway westward, we would wish to direct the traveller’s attention to\r\na sequestered spot of peculiar beauty on the river Foyers. This\r\nis a secluded vale, called Killean, which, besides its natural\r\nattractions, and these are many, is distinguished as one of the few\r\nplaces where the old practice of resorting to the ‘shieling’ for\r\nsummer grazing of cattle is still observed. It is encompassed on\r\nall sides by steep mountains; but at the north end there is a small\r\nlake, about a mile and a half in length, and from one-third to half\r\na mile in breadth. The remainder of the bottom of the glen is a\r\nperfectly level tract, of the same width with the lake, and about\r\ntwo miles and a half in length, covered with the richest herbage,\r\nand traversed by a small meandering river flowing through it into\r\nthe lake. The surface of this flat is bedecked with the little huts\r\nor bothies, which afford temporary accommodation to the herdsmen and\r\nothers in charge of the cattle. This portion of the glen is bordered\r\non the west by continuous hills rising abruptly in a uniformly\r\nsteep acclivity, and passing above into a perpendicular range of\r\nprecipices, the whole covered with a scanty verdure sprouted with\r\nheath. At the bend of the lake near its middle, where it inclines\r\nfrom a northernly course towards the west, a magnificent rounded\r\nprecipice, which, like the continuous ranges, may be about 1200 feet\r\nin height, rises immediately out of the water; and a few narrow\r\nand inclined verdant stripes alone preserve it from exhibiting a\r\nperfectly mural character. To this noble rock succeeds, along the\r\nrest of the lake, a beautiful, lofty, and nearly vertical hill-side,\r\nclothed with birch, intermingled with hanging mossy banks, shaded\r\nover with the deeper tinted bracken. The eastern side of the plain,\r\nand the adjoining portion of the lake, are lined by mountains\r\ncorresponding in height with those opposed to them; but their lower\r\nextremities are, to a considerable extent, strewed with broken\r\nfragments of rock, to which succeeds an uninterrupted zone of birch\r\nand alder, which is again overtopped in its turn by naked cliffs. An\r\nelevated terrace occupies the remainder of this side of the lake;\r\nabove the wooded face of which is seen a sloping expanse of mingled\r\nheath and herbage. About half a mile from the south end, Mr. Fraser\r\nof Lovat, the proprietor, has erected a shooting lodge; viewed from\r\nwhich, or from either end, or from the top of the platform on the\r\nnorth-east side of the lake, fancy could scarcely picture a more\r\nattractive and fairy landscape than is unfolded by this sequestered\r\nvale, to which Dr. Johnson’s description of the ‘Happy Valley’ not\r\ninaptly applies. The milch cows, to the number of several hundreds,\r\nare generally kept here from the beginning of June to the middle of\r\nAugust, when they are replaced by the yeld cattle. The river sweeps\r\nto the northward from Loch Killean through richly birch-clad hills,\r\nwhich rise in swelling slopes from its banks. A large tarn which\r\nimmediately joins it from the east is crossed at its mouth by a\r\nrustic bridge, from which a single footpath conducts across the brow\r\nof the hill to Whitebridge, a small public-house or inn, four miles\r\ndistant.”\r\n\r\nThere is a loch of a very different character from Killean, almost\r\nas little known (a view of it is given at page 708), equal to\r\nanything in the Highlands, only two miles distant from Loch Lochy, in\r\nthe great glen--Loch Arkaig. We first visited it many years since,\r\nhaving been induced to do so by a passage in John Stoddard’s _Remarks\r\non the Local Scenery and Manners of Scotland_; and it was then a\r\nvery noble oak and pine forest loch. The axe went to work and kept\r\nsteadily at it; and a great change was wrought; but it is still a\r\ngrand scene, with a larger infusion of beauty than it possessed of\r\nold. The scenery of the valley separating it from Loch Lochy is very\r\nsimilar to that of the Trossachs; through it there are two approaches\r\nto the loch, and the _Mile-Dubh_, or the dark mile, according to\r\nour feeling, is more impressive than any part of the approach to\r\nLoch Katrine. The woods and rocks are very solemn, and yet very\r\nsweet; for though many old pines, and oaks and ashes are there,\r\nand the wall of rocks is immense, young trees prevail now on many\r\nplaces, as well along the heights as among the knolls and hillocks\r\nbelow, where alders and hawthorns are thick; almost everywhere the\r\nyoung are intermingled with the old, and look cheerful under their\r\nprotection, without danger of being chilled by their shade. The loch,\r\nmore or less sylvan from end to end, shows on its nearer shores some\r\nmagnificent remains of the ancient forest, and makes a noble sweep\r\nlike some great river. There may be more, but we remember but one\r\nisland--not large, but wooded as it should be--the burying-place of\r\nthe family of Lochiel. What rest! It is a long journey from Loch\r\nLochy to Kinloch Arkaig--and by the silent waters we walked or sat\r\nall a summer’s day. There was nothing like a road that we observed,\r\nbut the shores are easily travelled, and there it is you may be\r\nalmost sure of seeing some red deer. They are no better worth looking\r\nat from a window than Fallow--no offence to Fallow, who are fine\r\ncreatures; indeed, we had rather not see them so at all; but on the\r\nshores or steeps of Loch Arkaig, with hardly a human habitation\r\nwithin many, many miles, and these few rather known than seen to\r\nbe there, the huts of Highlanders contented to cultivate here and\r\nthere some spot that seems cultivatable, but probably is found not\r\nto be so after some laborious years--there they are at home; and\r\nyou, if young, looking on them feel at home too, and go bounding,\r\nlike one of themselves, over what, did you choose, were an evitable\r\nsteep. Roe, too, frequent the copses, but to be seen they must be\r\nstarted; grouse spring up before you oftener than you might expect\r\nin a deer forest; but, to be sure, it is a rough and shaggy one,\r\nthough lovelier lines of verdure never lay in the sunshine than we\r\nthink we see now lying for miles along the margin of that loch. The\r\nnumerous mountains towards the head of the loch are very lofty, and\r\nglens diverge in grand style into opposite and distant regions. Glen\r\nDessary, with its beautiful pastures, opens on the Loch, and leads\r\nto Loch Nevish on the coast of Knoidart--Glen Pæan to Oban-a-Cave on\r\nLoch Morer, Glen Canagorie into Glenfinnan and Loch Shiel; and Glen\r\nKingie to Glengarry and Loch Quoich. There is a choice! We chose Glen\r\nKingie, and after a long climb found a torrent that took us down to\r\nGlengarry before sunset. It is a loch little known, and in grandeur\r\nnot equal to Loch Arkaig; but at the close of such a day’s journey,\r\nthe mind, elevated by the long contemplation of the great objects of\r\nnature, cannot fail to feel aright, whatever it may be, the spirit of\r\nthe scene, that seems to usher in the grateful hour of rest. It is\r\nsurpassing fair--and having lain all night long on its gentle banks,\r\nsleeping or waking we know not, we have never remembered it since but\r\nas the Land of Dreams.\r\n\r\nWhich is the dreariest, most desolate and dismal of the Highland\r\nlochs? We should say Loch Ericht. It lies in a prodigious wilderness\r\nwith which perhaps no man alive is conversant, and in which you may\r\ntravel for days without seeing even any symptoms of human life. We\r\nspeak of the regions comprehended between the Forest of Athole,\r\nand Bennevis, the Moor of Rannoch, and Glen Spean. There are many\r\nLochs--and Loch Ericht is their grisly Queen. Herdsmen, shepherds,\r\nhunters, fowlers, anglers, traverse its borders, but few have been\r\nfar in the interior, and we never knew anybody who had crossed it\r\nfrom south to north, from east to west. We have ourselves seen\r\nmore of it, perhaps than any other Lowlander; and had traversed\r\nmany of its vast glens and moors before we found our way to the\r\nsouthern solitude of Loch Ericht. We came into the western gloom of\r\nBen Alder from Loch Ouchan, and up and down for hours dismal but\r\nnot dangerous precipices that opened out into what might almost\r\nbe called passes--but we have frequently to go back for they were\r\nblind--contrived to clamber to the edge of one of the mountains\r\nthat rose from the water a few miles down the Loch. All was vast,\r\nshapeless, savage, black, and wrathfully grim; for it was one of\r\nthose days that keep frowning and lowering, yet will not thunder;\r\nsuch as one conceives of on the eve of an earthquake. At first the\r\nsight was dreadful, but there was no reason for dread; imagination\r\nremains not longer than she chooses the slave of her own eyes, and\r\nwe soon began to enjoy the gloom, and to feel how congenial it was\r\nin nature with the character of all those lifeless cliffs. Silence\r\nand darkness suit well together in solitude at noonday; and settled\r\non huge objects make them sublime. And they were huge; all ranged\r\ntogether, and stretching away to a great distance, with the pitchy\r\nwater, still as if frozen, covering their feet.\r\n\r\nLoch Ericht is many miles long--nearly twenty; but there is a loch\r\namong the Grampians not more than two miles round--if so much, which\r\nis sublimer far--Loch Aven. You come upon the sight of it at once,\r\na short way down from the summit of Cairngorm, and then it is some\r\ntwo thousand feet below you, itself being as many above the level\r\nof the sea. But to come upon it so as to feel best its transcendent\r\ngrandeur, you should approach it up Glenaven--and from as far down\r\nas Inch-Rouran, which is about half-way between Loch Aven and\r\nTomantoul. Between Inch-Rouran and Tomantoul the glen is wild, but\r\nit is inhabited; above that house there is but one other--and for\r\nabout a dozen miles--we have heard it called far more--there is\r\nutter solitude. But never was there a solitude at once so wild--so\r\nsolemn--so serene--so sweet! The glen is narrow; but on one side\r\nthere are openings into several wider glens, that show you mighty\r\ncoves as you pass on; on the other side the mountains are without a\r\nbreak, and the only variation with them is from smooth to shaggy,\r\nfrom dark to bright; but their prevailing character is that of\r\npastoral or of forest peace. The mountains that show the coves belong\r\nto the bases of Ben-Aven and Ben-y-buird. The heads of those giants\r\nare not seen--but it sublimes the long glen to know that it belongs\r\nto their dominion, and that it is leading us on to an elevation that\r\nerelong will be on a level with the roots of their topmost cliffs.\r\nThe Aven is so clear--on account of the nature of its channel--that\r\nyou see the fishes hanging in every pool; and ’tis not possible to\r\nimagine how beautiful in such transparencies are the reflections of\r\nits green ferny banks. For miles they are composed of knolls, seldom\r\ninterspersed with rocks, and there cease to be any trees. But ever\r\nand anon, we walk for a while on a level floor, and the voice of the\r\nstream is mute. Hitherto sheep have been noticed on the hill, but\r\nnot many, and red and black cattle grazing on the lower pastures;\r\nbut they disappear, and we find ourselves all at once in a desert.\r\nSo it is felt to be, coming so suddenly with its black heather on\r\nthat greenest grass; but ’tis such a desert as the red-deer love.\r\nWe are now high up on the breast of the mountain, which appears to\r\nbe Cairngorm; but such heights are deceptive, and it is not till\r\nwe again see the bed of the Aven that we are assured we are still\r\nin the glen. Prodigious precipices, belonging to several different\r\nmountains, for between mass and mass there is blue sky, suddenly\r\narise, forming themselves more and more regularly into circular\r\norder, as we near; and now we have sight of the whole magnificence;\r\nyet vast as it is, we know not yet how vast; it grows as we gaze,\r\ntill in a while we feel that sublimer it may not be; and then so\r\nquiet in all its terrific grandeur we feel too that it is beautiful,\r\nand think of the Maker.\r\n\r\nThis is Loch Aven. How different the whole regions round from\r\nthat enclosing Loch Ericht! There, vast wildernesses of more than\r\nmelancholy moors--huge hollows hating their own gloom that keep them\r\nherbless--disconsolate glens left far away by themselves, without any\r\nsign of life--cliffs that frown back the sunshine--and mountains, as\r\nif they were all dead, insensible to the heavens. Is this all mere\r\nimagination--or the truth? We deceive ourselves in what we call a\r\ndesert. For we have so associated our own being with the appearances\r\nof outward things, that we attribute to them, with an uninquiring\r\nfaith, the very feelings and the very thoughts, of which we have\r\nchosen to make them emblems. But here the sources of the Dee seem\r\nto lie in a region as happy as it is high; for the bases of the\r\nmountains are all such as the soul has chosen to make sublime--the\r\ncolouring of the mountains all such as the soul has chosen to make\r\nbeautiful; and the whole region, thus imbued with a power to inspire\r\nelevation and delight, is felt to be indeed one of the very noblest\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nWe have now nearly reached the limits assigned to our _Remarks on\r\nthe Character of the Scenery of the Highlands_; and we feel that\r\nthe sketches we have drawn of its component qualities--occasionally\r\nfilled up with some details--must be very imperfect indeed, without\r\ncomprehending some parts of the coast, and some of the sea-arms that\r\nstretch into the interior. But even had our limits allowed, we do\r\nnot think we could have ventured on such an attempt; for though we\r\nhave sailed along most of the western shores, and through some of its\r\nsounds, and into many of its bays, and up not a few of its reaches,\r\nyet they contain such an endless variety of all the fairest and\r\ngreatest objects of nature, that we feel it would be far beyond our\r\npowers to give anything like an adequate idea of the beauty and the\r\ngrandeur that for ever kept unfolding themselves around our summer\r\nvoyagings in calm or storm. Who can say that he knows a thousandth\r\npart of the wonders of “the marine” between the Mull of Cantire and\r\nCape Wrath? He may have gathered many an extensive shore--threaded\r\nmany a mazy multitude of isles--sailed up many a spacious bay--and\r\ncast anchor at the head of many a haven land-locked so as no more to\r\nseem to belong to the sea--yet other voyagers shall speak to him of\r\ninnumerable sights which he has never witnessed; and they who are\r\nmost conversant with those coasts, best know how much they have left\r\nand must leave for ever unexplored.\r\n\r\nLook now only at the Linnhe Loch--how it gladdens Argyle! Without\r\nit and the sound of Mull how sad would be the shadows of Morven!\r\nEclipsed the splendours of Lorn! Ascend one of the heights of Appin,\r\nand as the waves roll in light, you will feel how the mountains are\r\nbeautified by the sea. There is a majestic rolling onwards there\r\nthat belongs to no land-loch--only to the world of waves. There is\r\nno nobler image of ordered power than the tide, whether in flow or\r\nin ebb; and on all now it is felt to be beneficent, coming and going\r\ndaily, to enrich and adorn. Or in fancy will you embark, and let the\r\n“Amethyst” bound away “at her own sweet will,” accordant with yours,\r\ntill she reach the distant and long-desired loch.\r\n\r\n      “Loch-Sunart! who, when tides and tempests roar,\r\n      Comes in among these mountains from the main,\r\n      ’Twixt wooded Ardnamurchan’s rocky cape\r\n      And Ardmore’s shingly beach of hissing spray;\r\n      And, while his thunders bid the sound of Mull\r\n      Be dumb, sweeps onwards past a hundred bays\r\n      Hill-sheltered from the wrath that foams along\r\n      The mad mid-channel,--All as quiet they\r\n      As little separate worlds of summer dreams,--\r\n      And by storm-loving birds attended up\r\n      The mountain-hollow, white in their career\r\n      As are the breaking billows, spurns the Isles\r\n      Of craggy Carnich, and Green Oronsay\r\n      Drench’d in that sea-born shower o’er tree-tops driven\r\n      And ivied stones of what was once a tower\r\n      Now hardly known from rocks--and gathering might\r\n      In the long reach between Dungallan caves\r\n      And point of Arderinis ever fair\r\n      With her Elysian groves, bursts through that strait\r\n      Into another ampler inland sea;\r\n      Till lo! subdued by some sweet influence,--\r\n      And potent is she though so meek the Eve,--\r\n      Down sinketh wearied the old Ocean\r\n      Insensibly into a solemn calm,--\r\n      And all along that ancient burial-ground,\r\n      (Its kirk is gone,) that seemeth now to lend\r\n      Its own eternal quiet to the waves,\r\n      Restless no more, into a perfect peace\r\n      Lulling and lull’d at last, while drop the airs\r\n      Away as they were dead, the first risen star\r\n      Beholds that lovely Archipelago,\r\n      All shadow’d there as in a spiritual world,\r\n      Where time’s mutations shall come never more!”\r\n\r\nThese lines describe but one of innumerable lochs that owe their\r\ngreatest charm to the sea. It is indeed one of those on which\r\nnature has lavished all her infinite varieties of loveliness; but\r\nLoch Leven is scarcely less fair, and perhaps grander; and there is\r\nmatchless magnificence about Loch Etive. All round about Ballachulish\r\nand Invercoe the scenery of Loch Leven is the sweetest ever seen\r\novershadowed by such mountains; the deeper their gloom, the brighter\r\nits lustre; in all weathers it wears a cheerful smile; and often\r\nwhile up among the rocks the tall trees are tossing in the storm, the\r\nheart of the woods beneath is calm, and the vivid fields they shelter\r\nlook as if they still enjoyed the sun. Nor closes the beauty there,\r\nbut even animates the entrance into that dreadful glen--Glencoe. All\r\nthe way up its river, Loch Leven would be fair, were it only for her\r\nhanging woods. But though the glen narrows, it still continues broad,\r\nand there are green plains between her waters and the mountains, on\r\nwhich stately trees stand single, and there is ample room for groves.\r\nThe returning tide tells us, should we forget it, that this is no\r\ninland loch, for it hurries away back to the sea, not turbulent, but\r\nfast as a river in flood. The river Leven is one of the finest in the\r\nHighlands, and there is no other such series of waterfalls, all seen\r\nat once, one above the other, along an immense vista; and all the\r\nway up to the farthest there are noble assemblages of rocks--nowhere\r\nany want of wood--and in places, trees that seem to have belonged to\r\nsome old forest. Beyond, the opening in the sky seems to lead into\r\nanother region, and it does so; for we have gone that way, past some\r\nsmall lochs, across a wide wilderness, with mountains on all sides,\r\nand descended on Loch Treag,\r\n\r\n      “A loch whom there are none to praise\r\n      And very few to love,”\r\n\r\nbut overflowing in our memory with all pleasantest images of pastoral\r\ncontentment and peace.\r\n\r\nLoch Etive, between the ferries of Connel and Bunawe, has been seen\r\nby almost all who have visited the Highlands but very imperfectly;\r\nto know what it is you must row or sail up it, for the banks on\r\nboth sides are often richly wooded, assume many fine forms, and are\r\nfrequently well embayed, while the expanse of water is sufficiently\r\nwide to allow you from its centre to command a view of many of the\r\ndistant heights. But above Bunawe it is not like the same loch. For\r\na couple of miles it is not wide, and it is so darkened by enormous\r\nshadows that it looks even less like a strait than a gulf--huge\r\noverhanging rocks on both sides ascending high, and yet felt to\r\nbelong but to the bases of mountains that sloping far back have\r\ntheir summits among clouds of their own in another region of the sky.\r\nYet are they not all horrid; for nowhere else is there such lofty\r\nheather--it seems a wild sort of brushwood; tall trees flourish,\r\nsingle or in groves, chiefly birches, with now and then an oak--and\r\nthey are in their youth or their prime--and even the prodigious\r\ntrunks, some of which have been dead for centuries, are not all dead,\r\nbut shoot from their knotted rhind symptoms of life inextinguishable\r\nby time and tempest. Out of this gulf we emerge into the Upper\r\nLoch, and its amplitude sustains the majesty of the mountains, all\r\nof the highest order, and seen from their feet to their crests.\r\nCruachan wears the crown, and reigns over them all--king at once of\r\nLoch Etive and of Loch Awe. But Buachaille Etive, though afar off,\r\nis still a giant, and in some lights comes forwards, bringing with\r\nhim the Black Mount and its dependents, so that they all seem to\r\nbelong to this most magnificent of all Highland lochs. “I know not,”\r\nsays Macculloch, “that Loch Etive could bear an ornament without an\r\ninfringement on that aspect of solitary vastness which it presents\r\nthroughout. Nor is there one. The rocks and bays on the shore, which\r\nmight elsewhere attract attention, are here swallowed up in the\r\nenormous dimensions of the surrounding mountains, and the wide and\r\nample expanse of the lake. A solitary house, here fearfully solitary,\r\nsituated far up in Glen Etive, is only visible when at the upper\r\nextremity; and if there be a tree, as there are in a few places on\r\nthe shore, it is unseen; extinguished as if it were a humble mountain\r\nflower, by the universal magnitude around.” This is finely felt and\r\nexpressed; but even on the shores of Loch Etive there is much of the\r\nbeautiful; Ardmatty smiles with its meadows, and woods, and bay,\r\nand sylvan stream; other sunny nooks repose among the grey granite\r\nmasses; the colouring of the banks and braes is often bright; several\r\nhouses or huts become visible no long way up the glen; and though\r\nthat long hollow--half a day’s journey--till you reach the wild\r\nroad between Inveruran and King’s House--lies in gloom, yet the\r\nhillsides are cheerful, and you delight in the greensward, wide and\r\nrock-broken, should you ascend the passes that lead into Glencreran\r\nor Glencoe. But to feel the full power of Glen Etive you must walk\r\nup it till it ceases to be a glen. When in the middle of the moor,\r\nyou see far off a solitary dwelling indeed--perhaps the loneliest\r\nhouse in all the Highlands--and the solitude is made profounder, as\r\nyou pass by, by the voice of a cataract, hidden in an awful chasm,\r\nbridged by two or three stems of trees, along which the red-deer\r\nmight fear to venture--but we have seen them and the deer-hounds\r\nglide over it, followed by other fearless feet, when far and wide the\r\nForest of Dalness was echoing to the hunter’s horn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now brought our Remarks on the _Scenery of the Highlands_ to\r\na close, and would fain have said a few words on the character and\r\nlife of the people; but are precluded from even touching on that most\r\ninteresting subject. It is impossible that the minds of travellers\r\nthrough those wonderful regions can be so occupied with the\r\ncontemplation of mere inanimate nature, as not to give many a thought\r\nto their inhabitants, now and in the olden time. Indeed, without\r\nsuch thoughts, they would often seem to be but blank and barren\r\nwildernesses in which the heart would languish, and imagination\r\nitself recoil; but they cannot long be so looked at, for houseless as\r\nare many extensive tracts, and at times felt to be too dreary even\r\nfor moods that for a while enjoyed the absence of all that might tell\r\nof human life, yet symptoms and traces of human life are noticeable\r\nto the instructed eye almost every where, and in them often lies\r\nthe spell that charms us, even while we think that we are wholly\r\ndelivered up to the influence of “dead insensate things.” None will\r\nvisit the Highlands without having some knowledge of their history;\r\nand the changes that have long been taking place in the condition\r\nof the people will be affectingly recognised wherever they go, in\r\nspite even of what might have appeared the insuperable barriers of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL HISTORY OF THE HIGHLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nB.C. 55--A.D. 446.\r\n\r\n  Highlands defined--Ancient Scotland--Roman Transactions--Agricola\r\n  --Caledonians--Contest at Loch Ore--Galgacus--Mons Grampius--Battle\r\n  --Agricola superseded--Lollius Urbicus--Antonine’s Wall--Ulpius\r\n   Marcellus--Severus--Constantius Chlorus--Picts--Scots--Attacots\r\n  --Attack Roman Provinces--Romans abandon Britain--Influence of\r\n  Romans--Roman Remains--Roads--Camps--Ardoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is generally acknowledged that the physical character of\r\na country influences in a great degree the moral and physical\r\ncharacter of its inhabitants, and thus to a certain extent determines\r\ntheir history, it may not be deemed out of place to define here\r\nthe application of the term _Highlands_, so far as Scotland is\r\nconcerned, and briefly to describe the general physical aspect of\r\nthat part of our native land. If it hold good at all that there\r\nsubsists a relation between a people and the country which they have\r\ninhabited for centuries, the following history will show that this is\r\npeculiarly the case with the Scottish Highlanders.\r\n\r\nMost of those who have thought of the matter at all, have doubtless\r\nformed to themselves a general notion of the northern half of\r\nScotland as a\r\n\r\n      “Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,\r\n      Land of the mountain and the flood,”\r\n\r\nand of its inhabitants as a brawny, rugged, indomitable, impulsive\r\nrace, steadfast in their friendship and loyalty, and relentless but\r\ngenerous in their enmity. Although the popular and poetic notion of\r\nthe country is on the whole correct, and although the above epithets\r\nmay express the main features of the character of the people, still\r\nit requires a close acquaintance with this interesting race, both\r\nhistorically and by personal intercourse, to form an adequate notion\r\nof their character in all its aspects.\r\n\r\nTo speak roughly, nearly the whole of the country north of a line\r\nconnecting the heads of the estuaries of the Clyde, Forth, and Tay,\r\nmay be included under the designation of the Highlands, and, in fact,\r\npopularly is so. Indeed, at the time at which the northern half of\r\nScotland--the ancient and proper Caledonia--emerges from its pristine\r\ngloom, and for the first time glimmers in the light of history, the\r\nline indicated by the forts of Agricola, and afterwards by the wall\r\nof Antonine, marked the southern boundary of the region which was\r\nthen, and for centuries afterwards, regarded by the Romans, and also,\r\nprobably, by the southern Britons, as occupying the same position\r\nin relation to the rest of the country as the Highlands proper did\r\nat a subsequent period. In course of time the events which fall to\r\nbe recorded in the following pages gradually altered this easily\r\nperceived boundary, so that for centuries before the present day, a\r\nmuch more intricate but still distinct line has marked the limits\r\nof what is now strictly and correctly regarded as the Highlands of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe definition of this territory which best suits the purposes of\r\nhistory, and in all respects most nearly accords with those of\r\npolitical and social geography, is one which makes it commensurate\r\nwith the country or locations of the ancient Highland clans. This\r\ndefinition assigns to the Highlands all the continental territory\r\nnorth of the Moray frith, and all the territory, both insular and\r\ncontinental, westward of an easily traceable line from that frith\r\nto the frith of Clyde. The line commences at the mouth of the river\r\nNairn: thence, with the exception of a slight north-eastward or\r\noutward curve, the central point of which is on the river Spey, it\r\nruns due south-east till it strikes the river Dee at Tullach, nearly\r\non the third degree of longitude west of Greenwich; it then runs\r\ngenerally south till it falls upon Westwater, or the southern large\r\nhead-water of the North Esk; thence, over a long stretch, it runs\r\nalmost due south-west, and with scarcely a deviation, till it falls\r\nupon the Clyde at Ardmore in the parish of Cardross; and now onward\r\nto the Atlantic ocean, it moves along the frith of Clyde, keeping\r\nnear to the continent, and excluding none of the Clyde islands except\r\nthe comparatively unimportant Cumbraes. All the Scottish territory\r\nwest and north-west of this line is properly the Highlands. Yet\r\nboth for the convenience of topographical description, and because,\r\naltogether down to the middle of the 13th century, and partially down\r\nto the middle of the 16th, the Highlands and the Western Islands were\r\npolitically and historically distinct regions, the latter are usually\r\nviewed apart under the name of the Hebrides. The mainland Highlands,\r\nor the Highlands after the Hebrides are deducted, extend in extreme\r\nlength from Duncansby Head, or John o’ Groat’s on the north, to the\r\nMull of Kintyre on the south, about 250 miles; but over a distance of\r\n90 miles at the northern end, they have an average breadth of only\r\nabout 45 miles,--over a distance of 50 or 55 miles at the southern\r\nend, they consist mainly of the Clyde islands, and the very narrow\r\npeninsula of Kintyre,--and even at their broadest part, from the\r\neastern base of the Grampians to Ardnamurchan Point on the west,\r\nthey do not extend to more than 120 miles. The district comprehends\r\nthe whole of the counties of Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Cromarty,\r\nInverness, and Argyle, large parts of Nairn, Perth, Dumbarton, and\r\nBute, and considerable portions of Elgin, Banff, Aberdeen, Forfar,\r\nand Stirling. Considerable parts of this district, however, such as\r\nCaithness-shire, the island of Bute, and some large tracts of moor or\r\nvalley or flanking plain, do not exhibit the physical features which\r\nare strictly Highland.\r\n\r\nA district so extensive can be but faintly pictured in a general and\r\nrapid description. Mountains, chiefly covered with heath or ling,\r\nbut occasionally, on the one hand, displaying sides and summits\r\nof naked rock, and on the other, exhibiting a dress of verdure,\r\neverywhere rise, at short intervals, in chains, ridges, groups,\r\nand even solitary heights. Their forms are of every variety, from\r\nthe precipitous and pinnacled acclivity, to the broad-based and\r\nround-backed ascent; but, in general, are sharp in outline, and wild\r\nor savagely grand in feature. Both elongated ridges, and chains or\r\nseries of short parallel ridges, have a prevailing direction from\r\nnorth-east to south-west, and send up summits from 1,000 to upwards\r\nof 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Glens, valleys, and\r\nexpanses of lowland stretch in all directions among the mountains,\r\nand abound in voluminous streams, and large elongated lakes of\r\npicturesque appearance,--nearly all the inland lakes extending in\r\nstripes either north-eastward and south-westward, or eastward and\r\nwestward. Along the whole west coast, at remarkably brief intervals,\r\narms of the sea, long, narrow, and sometimes exceedingly rugged in\r\noutline, run north-eastward or south-eastward into the interior, and\r\nassist the inland fresh water lakes in cleaving it into sections.\r\nThe rivers of the region are chiefly impetuous torrents, careering\r\nfor a while along mountain-gorges, and afterwards either expanding\r\nthemselves into beautiful lakes and flowing athwart delightful\r\nmeadows, or ploughing long narrow valleys, green and ornate with\r\ngrasses, trefoils, daisies, ranunculi, and a profuse variety of\r\nother herbage and flowers. Native woods, principally of pine and\r\nbirch, and occasionally clumps and expanses of plantation, climb the\r\nacclivities of the gentler heights, or crowd down upon the valley,\r\nand embosom the inland lakes. On the east side, along the coast to\r\nthe Moray frith, and towards the frontier in the counties of Nairn,\r\nElgin, and Perth, gentle slopes and broad belts of lowland, fertile\r\nin soil and favourable in position, are carpeted with agricultural\r\nluxuriance, and thickly dotted with human dwellings, and successfully\r\nvie with the south of Scotland in towns and population, and in the\r\npursuit and display of wealth. But almost everywhere else, except in\r\nthe fairyland of Loch Fyne, and the southern shore of Loch Etive, the\r\nHighlands are sequestered,--sinless of a town,--a semi-wilderness,\r\nwhere a square mile is a more convenient unit of measurement than an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nA district characterized by such features as we have named\r\nnecessarily exhibits, within very circumscribed limits, varieties\r\nof scenery of the most opposite descriptions; enabling the admirer\r\nof nature to pass abruptly from dwelling on the loveliness of an\r\nextensive marine or champaign landscape into the deep solitude of an\r\nancient forest, or the dark craggy fastnesses of an alpine ravine;\r\nor from lingering amid the quiet grassy meadows of a pastoral strath\r\nor valley, watered by its softly-flowing stream, to the open heathy\r\nmountain-side, whence ‘alps o’er alps arise,’ whose summits are often\r\nshrouded with mists and almost perennial snows, and their overhanging\r\nprecipices furrowed by foaming cataracts. Lakes and long arms of\r\nthe sea, either fringed with woods or surrounded with rocky barren\r\nshores, now studded with islands, and anon extending their silvery\r\narms into distant receding mountains, are met in every district;\r\nwhile the extreme steepness, ruggedness, and sterility of many of the\r\nmountain-chains impart to them as imposing and magnificent characters\r\nas are to be seen in the much higher and more inaccessible elevations\r\nof Switzerland. No wonder, then, that this ‘land of mountain and of\r\nflood’ should have given birth to the song of the bard, and afforded\r\nmaterial for the theme of the sage, in all ages; and that its\r\ninhabitants should be tinctured with deep romantic feelings, at once\r\ntender, melancholy, and wild; and that the recollection of their own\r\npicturesque native dwellings should haunt them to their latest hours.\r\nNeither, amid such profusion and diversity of all that is beautiful\r\nand sublime in nature, can the unqualified admiration of strangers,\r\nfrom every part of Europe, of the scenery of the Highlands fail of\r\nbeing easily accounted for; nor can any hesitate in recommending them\r\nto visit the more remote or unknown solitudes.[1]\r\n\r\nSuch are the main features of the Highlands of Scotland at the\r\npresent day, and, to a considerable extent, the description might\r\nhave applied to the country at the time of the Roman invasion.\r\nStill, in the graphic words of Stuart,[2] “To form an idea of the\r\ngeneral aspect of Scotland, as it was some eighteen hundred years\r\nago, we must, in imagination, restore to its now varied surface the\r\nalmost unbroken gloom of the primeval forest; her waving mantle of\r\nsombre hue, within which the _genius loci_ may be supposed to have\r\nbrooded over the seclusion and the poverty of ‘ancient Caledon.’ In\r\na bird’s-eye view, if such a thought may be indulged, the greatest\r\npart of the country presented, in all probability, the appearance of\r\none continuous wood; a mass of cheerless verdure resting on hill and\r\ndale--the sameness of its dark extent broken only where some lake\r\nor green-clad morass met the view, or where the higher mountains\r\nlifted their summits above the line of vegetation. In some districts,\r\nconsiderable tracks of open moorland might, doubtless, be seen clad\r\nin the indigenous heather of the North; while, in others, occasional\r\nspots of pasture-land would here and there appear;--but, on the\r\nwhole, these must have formed a striking contrast to the wide expanse\r\nof the prevailing forest.”\r\n\r\nAs the present work is concerned only with the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nit would of course be out of place to give any minute account of the\r\ntransactions of the Romans in the other parts of the island. Suffice\r\nit to say that from the time, B.C. 55, when Julius Cæsar first\r\nlanded on the coast of South Britain, until A.D. 78, when, under\r\nthe Emperor Vespasian, Cnæus Julius Agricola assumed the command in\r\nGreat Britain, the greater part of midland and south England had been\r\nbrought under the sway of the Romans. This able commander set himself\r\nwith vigour and earnestness to confirm the conquests which had been\r\nalready made, to reduce the rest of the country to subjection, to\r\nconciliate the Britons by mild measures, and to attach them to the\r\nRoman power by introducing among them Roman manners, literature,\r\nluxuries, and dress.\r\n\r\nAgricola was appointed to the command in Britain in the year 78 A.D.,\r\nbut appears not to have entered Scotland till his third campaign\r\nin the year 80. He employed himself in the years 80, 81, and 82, in\r\nsubduing the country south of the friths of Forth and Clyde,--the\r\n_Bodotria_ and _Glotta_ of Tacitus,--erecting, in 81, a series of\r\nforts between these two estuaries. Having accomplished this, Agricola\r\nmade preparations for his next campaign, which he was to open beyond\r\nthe friths in the summer of 83, he in the meantime having heard that\r\nthe Caledonians--as Tacitus calls the people north of the Forth--had\r\nformed a confederacy to resist the invader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Sculptured Stone in the Church of Meigle.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. From a Sculptured Stone found at St. Andrews.]\r\n\r\nThese Caledonians appear to have been divided into a number of tribes\r\nor clans, having little or no political connection, and almost\r\nconstantly at war among themselves. It was only when a foreign foe\r\nthreatened their much-prized freedom that a sense of danger forced\r\nthem to unite for a time under the command of a military leader.\r\nSome writers, on the authority of Ptolemy of Alexandria, but chiefly\r\non that of the pseudo-Richard of Cirencester,[3] give a list of\r\nthe various tribes which, during the Roman period, inhabited North\r\nBritain, and define the locality which each occupied with as much\r\nexactness as they might do a modern English county. “There was one\r\nthing,” says Tacitus, “which gave us an advantage over these powerful\r\nnations, that they never consulted together for the advantage of the\r\nwhole. It was rare that even two or three of them united against the\r\ncommon enemy.” Their whole means of subsistence consisted in the milk\r\nand flesh of their flocks and the produce of the chase. They lived in\r\na state almost approaching to nudity; but whether from necessity or\r\nfrom choice cannot be satisfactorily determined. Dio represents the\r\nCaledonians as being naked, but Herodian speaks of them as wearing a\r\npartial covering. They appear, at all events, if the stone dug up at\r\nBlackness in the year 1868 (see p. 11), be taken as an authority, to\r\nhave gone naked into battle. Their towns, which were few, consisted\r\nof huts covered with turf or skins, and for better security they were\r\nerected in the centre of some wood or morass. “What the Britons call\r\na town,” says Cæsar, “is a tract of woody country surrounded by a\r\nvallum and ditch, for the security of themselves and cattle against\r\nthe incursions of an enemy; for, when they have enclosed a very\r\nlarge circuit with felled trees, they build within it houses for\r\nthemselves, and hovels for their cattle.”[4] Notwithstanding, perhaps\r\nowing to the scantiness of their covering, which left their bodies\r\nexposed to the rigour of a cold and variable climate, the Caledonians\r\nwere a remarkably hardy race, capable of enduring fatigue, cold, and\r\nhunger to an extent which their descendants of the present day could\r\nnot encounter without risk of life. They were decidedly a warlike\r\npeople, and are said, like the heroes of more ancient times, to have\r\nbeen addicted to robbery. The weapons of their warfare consisted of\r\nsmall spears, long broadswords, and hand daggers; and they defended\r\ntheir bodies in combat by a small target or shield,--all much of\r\nthe same form and construction as those afterwards used by their\r\nposterity in more modern times. It would appear from the stone above\r\nreferred to that the shields of the Caledonians were oblong, with a\r\nboss in the centre, and their swords short and pointed,--not long\r\nand blunt, as represented by Tacitus. The use of cavalry appears not\r\nto have been so well understood among the Caledonians as among the\r\nmore southern tribes; but in battle they often made use of cars, or\r\nchariots, which were drawn by small, swift, and spirited horses; and\r\nit is conjectured that, like those used by the southern Britons,\r\nthey had iron scythes projecting from the axle. It is impossible to\r\nsay what form of government obtained among these warlike tribes.\r\nWhen history is silent, historians should either maintain a cautious\r\nreserve or be sparing in their conjectures; but analogy may supply\r\nmaterials for well-grounded speculations, and it may therefore be\r\nasserted, without any great stretch of imagination, that, like most\r\nof the other uncivilized tribes we read of in history, the Northern\r\nBritons or Caledonians were under the government of a leader or chief\r\nto whom they yielded a certain degree of obedience. Dio, indeed,\r\ninsinuates that the governments of these tribes were democratic; but\r\nhe should have been aware that it is only when bodies of men assume,\r\nin an advanced state of civilization, a compact and united form that\r\ndemocracy can prevail; and the state of barbarism in which he says\r\nthe inhabitants of North Britain existed at the period in question\r\nseems to exclude such a supposition. We have no certain information\r\nfrom any contemporary, and conjecture is therefore groundless. Later\r\nfable-loving historians and chroniclers, indeed, give lists of Kings\r\nof Scotland--or, rather, of Pictland--extending back for centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era, but these by general consent are now\r\nbanished to the realm of myths. It is probable, as we have already\r\nsaid, that the Caledonians were divided into a number of independent\r\ntribes, and that each tribe was presided over by a chief, but how\r\nhe obtained his supremacy it is impossible to say. We have one\r\ninstance, at least, of a number of tribes uniting under one leader,\r\nviz., at the battle of _Mons Grampius_, when the Caledonians were\r\ncommanded by a chief or leader called by Tacitus, Galgacus, “inter\r\nplures duces virtute et genere præstans.”[5] “The earliest bond of\r\nunion may probably be traced to the time when they united under one\r\ncommon leader to resist or assail the Roman legionaries; and out\r\nof the _Dux_ or _Toshach_ elected for the occasion, like Galgacus,\r\nand exercising a paramount though temporary authority, arose the\r\n_Ardrigh_ or supreme king, after some popular or ambitious chieftain\r\nhad prolonged his power by successful wars, or procured his election\r\nto this prominent station for life.”[6]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the relation of the members of the different\r\ntribes, and the relation of the tribes to each other, it is certain,\r\nfrom the general tone of the works of Tacitus and other Roman\r\nhistorians in which those early inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands\r\nare mentioned, that they offered a far more formidable resistance\r\nto the Roman arms than had hitherto been done by any other of the\r\nBritish tribes.\r\n\r\nIn personal stature, the natives of Caledonia, like those of other\r\nparts of Britain, appear to have excelled their Roman invaders, and\r\nfrom Tacitus we learn that those with whom his father-in-law came\r\ninto contact were distinguished by ruddy locks and lusty limbs. It\r\nis also certain that for the sake of ornament, or for the purpose of\r\nmaking their appearance more terrible in war, they resorted to the\r\nbarbarous practice of tattooing their bodies. Indeed it may be taken\r\nas a proof of their never having to any great extent come under the\r\npower and influence of Rome and Roman customs, that they retained\r\nthis practice for long after the other Britons had abandoned it, and\r\non this account, in all probability, afterwards acquired the name of\r\n_Picts_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: British War-Chariot.]\r\n\r\nThe people whom Agricola encountered in Scotland cannot have been\r\notherwise than tolerable proficients in the common branches of art;\r\nhow else can we suppose them to have been supplied with all that\r\n_matériel_ of war with which they are said to have appeared before\r\nhim? Indolent and uninformed as were the bulk of the people, they\r\nmust have had among them artificers both in wood and in iron, not\r\nunskilled in their respective trades--able to construct the body of\r\na car--to provide for it axles of great strength--above all, able to\r\nconstruct the wheels and arm them with those sharp-edged instruments\r\nthat were destined to cut down whatever opposed their course.[7]\r\n\r\nAgricola, in the summer of 83, after having obtained information\r\nas to the nature of the country and the aspect of its inhabitants\r\nfrom exploring parties and prisoners, transported his army across\r\nthe Frith of Forth to the shores of Fife by means of his fleet,\r\nand marched along the coast eastwards, keeping the fleet in sight.\r\nIt cannot with certainty be ascertained at what part of the Forth\r\nthis transportation of the forces took place, although some bold\r\nantiquarians assert that it must have been not far from Queensferry.\r\nThe fleet, Tacitus tells us,[8] now acting, for the first time,\r\nin concert with the land-forces, proceeded in sight of the army,\r\nforming a magnificent spectacle, and adding terror to the war. It\r\nfrequently happened that in the same camp were seen the infantry and\r\ncavalry intermixed with the marines, all indulging their joy, full of\r\ntheir adventures, and magnifying the history of their exploits; the\r\nsoldier describing, in the usual style of military ostentation, the\r\nforests which he had passed, the mountains which he climbed, and the\r\nbarbarians whom he put to the rout; while the sailor had his storms\r\nand tempests, the wonders of the deep, and the spirit with which he\r\nconquered winds and waves.\r\n\r\nThe offensive operations of the sixth campaign were commenced by the\r\nCaledonian Britons, who, from the higher country, made a furious\r\nattack upon the trans-Forthan fortifications, which so alarmed some\r\nof Agricola’s officers, who were afraid of being cut off from a\r\nretreat, that they advised their general to recross the Forth without\r\ndelay; but Agricola resisted this advice, and made preparations for\r\nthe attack which he expected would soon be made upon his army. As\r\nAgricola had received information that the enemy intended to fall\r\nupon him from various quarters, he divided his army into three bodies\r\nand continued his march. Some antiquarians have attempted to trace\r\nthe route taken by each division, founding their elaborate theories\r\non the very slender remains of what they suppose to have been Roman\r\nfortifications and encampments. As it would serve no good purpose\r\nto encumber our pages with these antiquarian conjectures, detailed\r\naccounts of which will be found in Chalmers, Stuart, Roy, and\r\nothers, we shall only say that, with considerable plausibility, it\r\nis supposed that the Ninth Legion encamped on the north side of Loch\r\nOre, about two miles south of Loch Leven in Kinross-shire. Another\r\nlegion, it is said, encamped near Dunearn Hill, about a mile distant\r\nfrom Burntisland, near which hill are still to be seen remains of\r\na strength called _Agricola’s camp_. At all events the divisions\r\ndo not seem to have been very far apart, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing episode.\r\n\r\nThe enemy having watched the proceedings of the Roman army made\r\nthe necessary preparations for attack, and during the night made\r\na furious assault on the Ninth Legion at Loch Ore. They had acted\r\nwith such caution that they were actually at the very camp before\r\nAgricola was aware of their movements; but with great presence of\r\nmind he despatched a body of his lightest troops to turn their flank\r\nand attack the assailants in the rear. After an obstinate engagement,\r\nmaintained with varied success in the very gates of the camp, the\r\nBritons were at length repulsed by the superior skill of the Roman\r\nveterans. This battle was so far decisive, that Agricola did not\r\nfind much difficulty afterwards in subduing the surrounding country,\r\nand, having finished his campaign, he passed the winter of 83 in\r\nFife; being supplied with provisions from his fleet in the Forth,\r\nand keeping up a constant correspondence with his garrisons on the\r\nsouthern side.\r\n\r\nBy this victory, according to Tacitus, so complete and glorious, the\r\nRoman army was inspired with confidence to such a degree, that they\r\nnow pronounced themselves invincible, and desired to penetrate to the\r\nextremity of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonians now began to perceive the danger of their situation\r\nfrom the proximity of such a powerful enemy, and a sense of this\r\ndanger impelled them to lay aside the feuds and jealousies which had\r\ndivided and distracted their tribes, to consult together for their\r\nmutual safety and protection, and to combine their scattered strength\r\ninto a united and energetic mass. The proud spirit of independence\r\nwhich had hitherto kept the Caledonian tribes apart, now made them\r\ncoalesce in support of their liberties, which were threatened with\r\nutter annihilation. In this eventful crisis, they looked around them\r\nfor a leader or chief under whom they might fight the battle of\r\nfreedom, and save their country from the dangers which threatened\r\nit. A chief, named Galgacus by Tacitus, was pitched upon to act as\r\ngeneralissimo of the Caledonian army; and, from the praises bestowed\r\nupon him by that historian, this warrior appears to have well\r\nmerited the distinction thus bestowed. Preparatory to the struggle\r\nthey were about to engage in, they sent their wives and children\r\ninto places of safety, and, in solemn assemblies in which public\r\nsacrifices were offered up, ratified the confederacy into which they\r\nhad entered against their common enemy.\r\n\r\nHaving strengthened his army with some British auxiliaries from the\r\nsouth, Agricola marched through Fife in the summer of 84, making for\r\na spot called by Tacitus _Mons Grampius_; sending at the same time\r\nhis fleet round the eastern coast, to support him in his operations,\r\nand to distract the attention of the Caledonians. Various conjectures\r\nhave been broached as to the exact line of Agricola’s march and the\r\nexact position of the Mons Grampius. The most plausible of these\r\nis that of General Roy,[9] who supposes that the march of Agricola\r\nwas regulated by the course of the Devon; that he turned to the\r\nright from Glendevon through the opening of the Ochil hills, along\r\nthe course of the rivulet which runs along Gleneagles; leaving the\r\nbraes of Ogilvie on his left, and passing between Blackford and\r\nAuchterarder towards the Grampian hills, which he saw at a distance\r\nbefore him as he debouched from the Ochils. By an easy march he\r\nreached the moor of Ardoch, from which he descried the Caledonian\r\narmy, to the number of 30,000 men, encamped on the declivity of the\r\nhill which begins to rise from the north-western border of the moor\r\nof Ardoch. Agricola took his station at the great camp which adjoins\r\nthe fort of Ardoch on the northward. If the Roman camp at Ardoch does\r\nmark the spot where the disastrous engagement about to be noticed\r\ntook place between these brave and determined Caledonians and the\r\ninvincible Roman legions, it is highly probable that Agricola drew\r\nout his army on the neighbouring moor, having a large ditch or trench\r\nof considerable length in front, the Caledonian host under Galgacus\r\nbeing already disposed in battle array on the heights beyond. The\r\nRoman army is supposed to have numbered about 20,000 or 30,000, the\r\nauxiliary infantry, in number about 8,000,[10] occupying the centre,\r\nthe wings consisting of 3,000 horse. The legions were stationed in\r\nthe rear, at the head of the entrenchments, as a body of reserve to\r\nsupport the ranks, if necessary, but otherwise to remain inactive,\r\nthat a victory, obtained without the effusion of Roman blood, might\r\nbe of higher value. Previous to the commencement of this interesting\r\nlight, according to “the fashion of historical literature at that\r\ntime,” a speech is put into the mouth of each general by the\r\nhistorian Tacitus. “How much more valuable would it have been to us\r\nhad Tacitus deigned to tell us something about the tongue in which\r\nthe leader of the barbarians spoke, or even his name, and the name of\r\nthe place where he fought, as the natives uttered it! Yet, for the\r\ngreat interests of its day, the speech of Galgacus was far removed\r\nfrom a mere feat of idle pedantry. It was a noble rebuke on the\r\nempire and the Roman people, who, false to the high destiny assigned\r\nto them by Virgil, of protecting the oppressed and striking down\r\nthe oppressors, had become the common scourge of all mankind. The\r\nprofligate ambition, the perfidy, the absorbing pride, the egotism,\r\nand the cruelty of the dominant people--how could all be so aptly\r\nset forth as in the words of a barbarian chief, ruling over the free\r\npeople who were to be the next victims.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the battle we give mainly in the words of the\r\nRoman commander’s son-in-law, Tacitus, who no doubt had the story\r\nfrom Agricola’s own mouth.[12] The battle began, and at first was\r\nmaintained at a distance. The Britons wanted neither skill nor\r\nresolution. With their long swords, and targets of small dimension,\r\nthey had the address to elude the missive weapons of the Romans, and\r\nat the same time to discharge a thick volley of their own. To bring\r\nthe conflict to a speedy decision, Agricola ordered three Batavian\r\nand two Tungrian cohorts to charge the enemy sword in hand. To\r\nthis mode of attack those troops had been long accustomed, but to\r\nthe Britons it was every way disadvantageous. Their small targets\r\nafforded no protection, and their unwieldy swords, not sharpened to\r\na point, could do but little execution in a close engagement. The\r\nBatavians rushed to the attack with impetuous fury; they redoubled\r\ntheir blows, and with the bosses of their shields bruised the enemy\r\nin the face, and, having overpowered all resistance on the plain,\r\nbegan to force their way up the ascent of the hill in regular order\r\nof battle. Incited by their example, the other cohorts advanced with\r\na spirit of emulation, and cut their way with terrible slaughter.\r\nEager in pursuit of victory, they pressed forward with determined\r\nfury, leaving behind them numbers wounded, but not slain, and others\r\nnot so much as hurt.\r\n\r\nThe Roman cavalry, in the mean time, was forced to give ground. The\r\nCaledonians, in their armed chariots, rushed at full speed into the\r\nthick of the battle, where the infantry were engaged. Their first\r\nimpression struck a general terror, but their career was soon checked\r\nby the inequalities of the ground, and the close embodied ranks of\r\nthe Romans. Nothing could less resemble an engagement of the cavalry.\r\nPent up in narrow places, the barbarians crowded upon each other,\r\nand were driven or dragged along by their own horses. A scene of\r\nconfusion followed. Chariots without a guide, and horses without a\r\nrider, broke from the ranks in wild disorder, and flying every way,\r\nas fear and consternation urged, they overwhelmed their own files,\r\nand trampled down all who came in their way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Britons, who had hitherto kept their post on the\r\nhills, looking down with contempt on the scanty numbers of the Roman\r\narmy, began to quit their station. Descending slowly, they hoped,\r\nby wheeling round the field of battle, to attack the victors in the\r\nrear. To counteract their design, Agricola ordered four squadrons\r\nof horse, which he had kept as a body of reserve, to advance to the\r\ncharge. The Britons poured down with impetuosity, and retired with\r\nequal precipitation. At the same time, the cavalry, by the directions\r\nof the general, wheeled round from the wings, and fell with great\r\nslaughter on the rear of the enemy, who now perceived that their own\r\nstratagem was turned against themselves.\r\n\r\nThe field presented a dreadful spectacle of carnage and destruction.\r\nThe Britons fled; the Romans pursued; they wounded, gashed, and\r\nmangled the runaways; they seized their prisoners, and, to be ready\r\nfor others, butchered them on the spot. Despair and horror appeared\r\nin various shapes; in one part of the field the Caledonians, sword\r\nin hand, fled in crowds from a handful of Romans; in other places,\r\nwithout a weapon left, they faced every danger, and rushed on certain\r\ndeath. Swords and bucklers, mangled limbs and dead bodies, covered\r\nthe plain. The field was red with blood. The vanquished Britons had\r\ntheir moments of returning courage, and gave proofs of virtue and of\r\nbrave despair. They fled to the woods, and, rallying their scattered\r\nnumbers, surrounded such of the Romans as pursued with too much\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\nNight coming on, the Romans, weary of slaughter, desisted from the\r\npursuit. Ten thousand of the Caledonians fell in this engagement:\r\non the part of the Romans, the number of slain did not exceed three\r\nhundred and forty.\r\n\r\nThe Roman army, elate with success, and enriched with plunder, passed\r\nthe night in exultation. The Britons, on the other hand, wandered\r\nabout, uncertain which way to turn, helpless and disconsolate. The\r\nmingled cries of men and women filled the air with lamentations. Some\r\nassisted to carry off the wounded; others called for the assistance\r\nof such as escaped unhurt; numbers abandoned their habitations, or,\r\nin their frenzy, set them on fire. They fled to obscure retreats,\r\nand, in the moment of choice, deserted them; they held consultations,\r\nand, having inflamed their hopes, changed their minds in despair;\r\nthey beheld the pledges of tender affection, and burst into tears;\r\nthey viewed them again, and grew fierce with resentment. It is a fact\r\nwell authenticated, that some laid violent hands upon their wives and\r\nchildren, determined with savage compassion to end their misery.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining hostages from the Horestians, who in all probability\r\ninhabited what is now the county of Fife, Agricola garrisoned the\r\nstations on the isthmus and elsewhere, recrossed the Forth, and\r\ntook up his winter-quarters in the north of England, about the Tyne\r\nand Solway. In the meantime he gave orders to the fleet, then lying\r\nprobably in the Frith of Forth or Tay, to proceed on a voyage\r\nof discovery to the northward. The enterprise appears to have\r\nbeen successfully accomplished by the Roman navy, which proceeded\r\ncoastwise as far as the Orkneys, whence it sailed by the Western\r\nIslands and the British Channel _ad Portum Trutulensem_, Richborough\r\nin Kent, returning to the point from which it started. This is the\r\nfirst voyage on record that determined Britain to be an island.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Domitian now resolved to supersede Agricola in his\r\ncommand in North Britain; and he was accordingly recalled in the\r\nyear 85, under the pretence of promoting him to the government of\r\nSyria, but in reality out of envy on account of the glory which\r\nhe had obtained by the success of his arms. He died on the 23d of\r\nAugust, 93, some say, from poison, while others attribute his death\r\nto the effects of chagrin at the unfeeling treatment of Domitian. His\r\ncountrymen lamented his death, and Tacitus, his son-in-law, preserved\r\nthe memory of his actions and his worth in the history of his life.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of Domitian’s reign, and that of Hadrian his\r\nsuccessor, North Britain appears to have enjoyed tranquillity; an\r\ninference which may be fairly drawn from the silence of the Roman\r\nhistorians. Yet as Hadrian in the year 121 built a wall between the\r\nSolway and the Tyne, some writers have supposed that the Romans had\r\nbeen driven by the Caledonians out of North Britain, in the reign of\r\nthat Emperor. But if such was the case, how did Lollius Urbicus, the\r\nRoman general, about nineteen years after Hadrian’s wall was erected,\r\npenetrate without opposition to Agricola’s forts between the Clyde\r\nand the Forth? May we not rather suppose that the wall of Hadrian was\r\nbuilt for the purpose of preventing incursions into the south by the\r\ntribes which inhabited the country between that wall and the Friths?\r\nBut, be this as it may, little is known of the history of North\r\nBritain from the time of Agricola’s recall till the year 138, when\r\nAntoninus Pius assumed the imperial purple. That good and sagacious\r\nemperor was distinguished by the care which he took in selecting the\r\nfittest officers for the government of the Roman provinces; and his\r\nchoice, for that of Britain, fell on Lollius Urbicus.\r\n\r\nThe positive information concerning the transactions of this general\r\nin North Britain is as meagre as could possibly be, the only clearly\r\nascertained fact in connection with his command being that he built\r\na wall between the Forth and Clyde, very nearly on a line with\r\nthe forts established by Agricola. “The meagreness of all ancient\r\nrecord,” says Burton,[13] “of the achievements of Lollius Urbicus is\r\nworthy of emphatic mention and recollection, because his name has\r\ngot into the ordinary abridged histories which speak of it, and of\r\n‘his campaign in the north’ as well-known events, of which people\r\nnaturally expect fuller information elsewhere. The usual sources for\r\nreference regarding him will however be found utterly dumb.” The\r\nstory commonly given is that he proceeded north as far as the Moray\r\nFrith, throwing the extensive country between Forth and Clyde and the\r\nMoray Frith into the form of a regular Roman province, which, on the\r\nworthless authority of the pseudo-Richard, was named Vespasiana. All\r\nthis may have been the case, and the remains[14] of Roman stations\r\nfound throughout the wide tract just mentioned give some plausibility\r\nto the conjecture; but there is only the most slender grounds for\r\nconnecting them with any northern expedition of Lollius Urbicus. At\r\nall events we may very safely conclude, from the general tone of\r\nthe records which remain of his and of subsequent expeditions, as\r\nwell as from the fact that they found it necessary to divide the\r\nLowlands from the Highlands by a fortified wall, that the Romans\r\nconsidered the Caledonians of their time very troublesome, and found\r\nit exceedingly difficult if not impossible to bring them under their\r\notherwise universal yoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map and Profile of Antonine’s Wall.]\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to give here some account of the wall of\r\nAntonine. The wall or rampart extended from Carriden on the Forth,\r\ntwo miles west from Blackness, and about the same distance east from\r\nBo’ness, to West Kilpatrick on the Clyde. The date, which may be\r\ndepended on, assigned to the building of the wall is between 138 and\r\n140 A.D. Taking the length of this wall from Kilpatrick on the Clyde\r\nto Caeridden or Carriden on the Forth, its extent would be 39,726\r\nRoman paces, which exactly agrees with the modern measurement of\r\n36 English miles and 620 yards. This rampart, which was of earth,\r\nand rested on a stone foundation, was upwards of twenty feet high\r\nand four and twenty feet thick. Along the whole extent of the wall\r\nthere was a vast ditch or _prætentura_ on the outward or north\r\nside, which was generally twenty feet deep and forty feet wide, and\r\nwhich, there is reason to believe, might be filled with water when\r\noccasion required.[15] This ditch and rampart were strengthened at\r\nboth ends, and throughout its whole extent, by about twenty forts,\r\nthree being at each extremity, and the remainder placed between at\r\nthe distance of about two English miles from one another; and it is\r\nhighly probable that these stations were designedly placed on the\r\nprevious fortifications of Agricola. The following, going from east\r\nto west, are the names and sites of some of the stations which have\r\nbeen identified:--Rough Castle, Castlecary, Westerwood, Bunhill,\r\nAuchindinny, Kirkintilloch, Bemulie, East Kilpatrick, Castlehill,\r\nDuntocher, West Kilpatrick. It will be seen that to a certain extent\r\nthey are on the line of the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, and\r\nthroughout nearly its whole length that of the Forth and Clyde canal.\r\nIts necessary appendage, a military road, ran behind the rampart from\r\nend to end, for the use of the troops and for keeping up the usual\r\ncommunication between the stations or forts. From inscriptions on\r\nsome of the foundation stones, which have been dug up, it appears\r\nthat the Second legion, with detachments from the sixth and twentieth\r\nlegions and some auxiliaries, executed these vast military works,\r\nequally creditable to their skill and perseverance. Dunglas near the\r\nwestern extremity, and Blackness near the eastern extremity of the\r\nrampart, afforded the Romans commodious harbours for their shipping,\r\nas also did Cramond, about five miles west from Edinburgh. This wall\r\nis called in the popular language of the country Grime’s or Graham’s\r\nDyke.[16] In 1868 a large oblong slab, in first-rate preservation,\r\nwas dug up at Bo’ness, in the parish of Kinneil (Bede’s _Peanfahel_,\r\n“the head of the wall”), containing an inscription as distinct as it\r\nwas on the day when it came from a Roman chisel. We give here a cut\r\nof this remarkable stone, which is now in the Scottish Antiquarian\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone from Antonine’s Wall. (Copied and engraved\r\nspecially for the present work.)]\r\n\r\nWe have no distinct mention of the Caledonians again until the reign\r\nof Commodus, when, about the year 183, these troublesome barbarians\r\nappear to have broken through the northern wall, slain the general in\r\ncommand of the Roman forces, and pillaged the lowland country beyond.\r\nThey were, however, driven back by Ulpius Marcellus, who succeeded\r\nby prudent management in maintaining peace for a number of years. In\r\nthe beginning of the reign of Severus, however, the Caledonians again\r\nbroke out, but were kept in check by Virius Lupus, who appears to\r\nhave bribed rather than beaten the barbarians into conformity.\r\n\r\nThe irrepressible Highlanders again broke out about the year 207,\r\nand this time the Emperor Severus himself, notwithstanding his bad\r\nhealth and old age, came from Rome to Britain, determined apparently\r\nto “stamp out” the rebellion. On hearing of his arrival the tribes\r\nsent deputies to him to negotiate for peace, but the emperor, who was\r\nof a warlike disposition, and fond of military glory, declined to\r\nentertain any proposals.\r\n\r\nAfter making the necessary preparations, Severus began his march to\r\nthe north in the year 208. He traversed the whole of North Britain,\r\nfrom the wall of Antoninus to the very extremity of the island,\r\nwith an immense army. The Caledonians avoided coming to a general\r\nengagement with him, but kept up an incessant and harassing warfare\r\non all sides. He, however, brought them to sue for peace; but the\r\nhonours of this campaign were dearly earned, for fifty thousand of\r\nthe Romans fell a prey to the attacks of the Caledonians, to fatigue,\r\nand to the severity of the climate. The Caledonians soon disregarded\r\nthe treaty which they had entered into with Severus, which conduct\r\nso irritated him that he gave orders to renew the war, and to spare\r\nneither age nor sex; but his son, Caracalla, to whom the execution of\r\nthese orders was intrusted, was more intent in plotting against his\r\nfather and brother than in executing the revengeful mandate of the\r\ndying emperor, whose demise took place at York on the 4th February,\r\n211, in the sixty-sixth year of his age, and in the third year of his\r\nadministration in Britain.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with this invasion that we first hear of the\r\nMeats or Mæatæ, who are mentioned by Dion Cassius, or rather his\r\nepitomiser Xiphiline, and who are supposed by some to have inhabited\r\nthe country between the two walls, while others think it more likely\r\nthat they were a part of the Caledonians, and inhabited the district\r\nbetween the Grampians and the wall of Antonine. We shall not,\r\nhowever, enter into this question here, but endeavour, as briefly as\r\npossible, to record all that is known of the remaining transactions\r\nof the Romans in the north of Scotland, reserving other matters for\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was not consistent with the policy by which Caracalla was\r\nactuated, to continue a war with the Caledonians; for the scene of\r\nhis ambition lay in Rome, to which he made hasty preparations to\r\ndepart on the death of his father. He therefore entered into a treaty\r\nwith the Caledonians by which he gave up the territories surrendered\r\nby them to his father, and abandoned the forts erected by him in\r\ntheir fastnesses. The whole country north of the wall of Antonine\r\nappears in fact to have been given up to the undisputed possession\r\nof the Caledonians, and we hear of no more incursions by them till\r\nthe reign of the emperor Constantius Chlorus, who came to Britain in\r\nthe year 306, to repel the Caledonians and other Picts.[17] Their\r\nincursions were repelled by the Roman legions under Constantius, and\r\nthey remained quiet till about the year 345, when they again entered\r\nthe territories of the provincial Britons; but they were compelled,\r\nit is said, again to retreat by Constans, son of Constantine the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nAlthough these successive inroads had been always repelled by\r\nthe superior power and discipline of the Romans, the Caledonians\r\nof the fourth century no longer regarded them in the formidable\r\nlight in which they had been viewed by their ancestors, and their\r\ngenius for war improving every time they came in hostile contact\r\nwith their enemies, they meditated the design of expelling the\r\nintruders altogether from the soil of North Britain. The wars which\r\nthe Romans had to sustain against the Persians in the East, and\r\nagainst the Germans on the frontiers of Gaul, favoured the plan of\r\nthe Caledonians; and having formed a treaty with the _Scots_, whose\r\nname is mentioned for the first time in history in this connection\r\nby Ammianus Marcellinus, they, in conjunction with their new allies,\r\nabout the year 360 invaded the Roman territories and committed many\r\ndepredations. Julian, who commanded the Roman army on the Rhine,\r\ndespatched Lupicinus, an able military commander, to defend the\r\nprovince against the Scots and Picts, but he was recalled before he\r\nhad done much to repel them.\r\n\r\nThe Picts--who on this occasion are mentioned by Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus[18] as being divided into two nations, the _Dicaledones_\r\nand _Vecturiones_--and Scots, being joined by the Attacots, “a\r\nwarlike race of men,” and the Saxons, numbers of whom appear at this\r\nearly period to have settled in Britain, made another attack on the\r\nRoman provinces in the year 364, on the accession of Valentinian.\r\nThese appear to have made their way as far south as London, and it\r\nrequired all the valour and skill of Theodosius the Elder, father of\r\nthe emperor of that name, who was sent to Britain in the year 367,\r\nto repel this aggression, and to repair the great ravages committed\r\nby the barbarians. The next outbreak occurred about the year 398,\r\nwhen the Picts and Scots again broke loose and ravaged the provinces,\r\nbeing repelled by a legion sent over by the great Stilicho, in answer\r\nto the petition of the helpless provincials for assistance.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the fifth century the enervated Romanized Britons\r\nagain appear to have been subjected to the tender mercies of their\r\nwicked northern neighbours; and in reply to their cry for help,\r\nHonorius, in 416, sent over to their relief a single legion, which\r\ndrove back the intruders. The Romans, as is well known, engrossed by\r\noverwhelming troubles nearer home, finally abandoned Britain about\r\nthe year 446, advising the inhabitants, who were suffering from the\r\nravages of the Picts and Scots, to protect themselves by retiring\r\nbehind and keeping in repair the wall of Severus.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the transactions of the Romans in Britain\r\nso far as these were connected with the Highlands of Scotland. That\r\nenergetic and insatiable people doubtless left their mark on the\r\ncountry and its inhabitants south of the Forth and Clyde, as the\r\nmany Roman remains which exist there at the present day testify. The\r\nBritish provincials, indeed, appear in the end to have been utterly\r\nenervated, and, in the worst sense, Romanized, so that they became\r\nan easy prey to their Saxon helpers. It is quite evident, however,\r\nthat the inhabitants of Caledonia proper, the district beyond the\r\nwall of Antonine, were to a very slight extent, if at all, influenced\r\nby the Roman invasion. Whether it was from the nature of the people,\r\nor from the nature of the country which they inhabited, or from both\r\ncombined, they appear to have been equally impervious to Roman force\r\nand Roman culture. The best services that their enemies rendered to\r\nthe Caledonians or Picts were that they forced them to unite against\r\nthe common foe thus contributing towards the foundation of a future\r\nkingdom; and that they gave them a training in arms such as the\r\nCaledonians could never have obtained, had they not been brought into\r\ncollision with the best-trained soldiers of the world in their time.\r\n\r\nWe have in what precedes mainly followed only one thread in the very\r\nintricate web formed by the early history of the Highlands, which,\r\nto a certain extent at this period, is the history of Scotland; but,\r\nas will have been seen, there are various other threads which join\r\nin from time to time, and which, after giving a short account of the\r\ntraces of the Roman invasion still existing in the Highlands, we\r\nshall endeavour to catch up and follow out as far as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary in a history of the Highlands of Scotland, as\r\nwe have defined that term, that much space should be given to an\r\naccount of Roman remains; for, as we have already said, these Italian\r\ninvaders appear never to have obtained anything like a firm footing\r\nin that rugged district, or made any definite or characteristic\r\nimpression on its inhabitants. “The vestiges whence it is inferred\r\nthat the Empire for a time had so far established itself in Scotland\r\nas to bring the natives over to the habits of peaceful citizens,\r\nbelong almost exclusively to the country south of Antonine’s wall,\r\nbetween the Forth and Clyde. Coins and weapons have been found\r\nfarther north, but scarcely any vestige of regular settlement. None\r\nof the pieces of Roman sculpture found in Scotland belong to the\r\ndistricts north of the wall. It is almost more significant still,\r\nthat of the very considerable number of Scottish Roman inscriptions\r\nin the various collections, only one was found north of the wall,\r\nand that in the strongly-fortified station of Ardoch, where it\r\ncommemorated that it was dedicated to the memory of a certain\r\nAmmonius Damionis.[19] On the other hand, it is in that unsubdued\r\ndistrict that the memorials of Roman conquest chiefly abound.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe whole of Britain was intersected by Roman ways, and as,\r\nwherever a Roman army went, it was preceded by pioneers who cleared\r\nand made a durable road to facilitate its march, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the north of Scotland was to a considerable extent\r\nintersected by highways during the invasion of Agricola, Lollius\r\nUrbicus, and Severus. One road at least can be traced as far north\r\nas Aberdeenshire, and is popularly known in some districts as the\r\n_Lang Causeway_. This road appears to have issued from the wall of\r\nAntonine, passed through Camelon, the Roman port on the Carron, and\r\npushing straight forward, according to the Roman custom, across the\r\nCarron, it pursued its course in a general north-east direction\r\nthrough Stirling, Perth, by Ardoch, through Forfar and Kincardine, to\r\nabout Stonehaven.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that there are traces of Roman roads even farther\r\nnorth. Between the rivers Don and Urie in Aberdeenshire, on the\r\neastern side of Bennachee, there exists an ancient road known in\r\nthe country by the name of the _Maiden Causeway_, a name by which\r\nsome of the Roman roads in the north of England are distinguished.\r\nThis proceeds from Bennachee whereon there is said to have been\r\na hill-fort, more than the distance of a mile into the woods of\r\nPitodrie, when it disappears: it is paved with stones, and is about\r\nfourteen feet wide. Still farther north, from Forres to the ford\r\nof Cromdale on the Spey, there has been long known a road of very\r\nancient construction, pointing to Cromdale, where the Romans may have\r\nforded the Spey. Various traces of very ancient roads are still to be\r\nseen by Corgarf and through Braemar: the tradition of the people in\r\nStrathdee and Braemar, supports the idea that there are remains of\r\nRoman roads which traverse the country between the Don and the Dee.\r\nCertain it is, that there are obvious traces of ancient roads which\r\ncross the wild districts between Strathdon and Strathdee, though it\r\nis impossible to ascertain when or by whom these ancient roads were\r\nconstructed, in such directions, throughout such a country.\r\n\r\nAlong these roads there were without doubt many camps and stations,\r\nas it is well known that the Romans never halted even for a single\r\nnight, without entrenching themselves behind secure fortifications.\r\nThere are many remains of what are supposed to have been Roman camps\r\nstill pointed out in various places north of the line occupied\r\nby Antonine’s wall. These are well known even to the peasantry,\r\nand are generally treated with respect. The line of these camps\r\nreaches as far as the counties of Aberdeen and Inverness, the most\r\nimportant of them, however, being found in Strathallan, Strathearn,\r\nand Strathmore. Besides the most important of these camps, that at\r\nArdoch, traces of many others have been found. There was one on the\r\nriver Earn, about six miles east of Ardoch, which would command\r\nthe middle part of Strathearn lying between the Ochil hills on the\r\nsouth and the river Almond on the north. Another important station\r\nis supposed to have been established near Callander, where, on a\r\ntongue of land formed by the junction of the rivers Strathgartney and\r\nStrathyre, the two sources of the Teith, are seen the embankments\r\nreferred to by Scott[21] as\r\n\r\n                  “The mouldering lines\r\n      Where Rome, the empress of the world,\r\n      Of yore her eagle wings unfurled.”[22]\r\n\r\nAnother camp is placed at Dalgenross, near the confluence of the\r\nRuchel and the Earn, which, with Bochastle, would command the\r\nwestern district of Strathearn. Another important station was the\r\nEast Findoch, at the south side of the Almond; it guarded the only\r\npracticable passage through the mountains northward, to an extent of\r\nthirty miles from east to west. The Roman camp here was placed on a\r\nhigh ground, defended by water on two sides, and by a morass with\r\na steep bank on the other two sides. It was about one hundred and\r\neighty paces long, and eighty broad, and was surrounded by a strong\r\nearthen wall nearly twelve feet thick, part of which still remains.\r\nThe trenches are still entire, and in some places six feet deep.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of Strathearn, and between it and the Forth,\r\nare the remains of Roman posts; and at Ardargie a Roman camp was\r\nestablished with the design, it is supposed, of guarding the passage\r\nthrough the Ochil hills, by the valley of May water. Another camp at\r\nGleneagles secured the passage of the same hills through Glendevon.\r\nWith the design of guarding the narrow, but useful passage from the\r\nmiddle Highlands, westward through Glenlyon to Argyle, the Romans\r\nfixed a post at Fortingal, about sixteen miles north-west from the\r\nstation at East-Findoch.\r\n\r\nA different line of posts became necessary to secure Angus and the\r\nMearns. At Coupar Angus, on the east side of the Isla, about seven\r\nmiles east from Inchtuthel, stood a Roman camp, of a square form, of\r\ntwenty acres within the ramparts. This camp commanded the passage\r\ndown Strathmore, between the Siedlaw hills on the south-east, and\r\nthe Isla on the north-west. On Campmoor, little more than a mile\r\nsouth from Coupar Angus, appear the remains of another Roman fort.\r\nThe great camp of Battledyke stood about eighteen miles north-east\r\nfrom Coupar Angus, being obviously placed there to guard the passage\r\nfrom the Highlands through Glen Esk and Glen Prosen. About eleven and\r\na-half miles north-east of the camp at Battledykes was another Roman\r\ncamp, the remains of which may still be traced near the mansion-house\r\nof Keithock. This camp is known by the name of Wardikes. The country\r\nbelow the Siedlaw hills, on the north side of the estuary of Tay, was\r\nguarded by a Roman camp near Invergowrie, which had a communication\r\non the north-east with the camp at Harefaulds. This camp, which was\r\nabout two hundred yards square, and fortified with a high rampart and\r\na spacious ditch, stood about two miles west from Dundee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Camp at Ardoch as it appeared in 1755.\r\n\r\n(Stuart’s _Caledonia Romana_.)]\r\n\r\nTraces of a number of others have been found, but we need not go\r\nfarther into detail. This account of the Roman transactions in\r\nScotland would, however, be incomplete without a more particular\r\nnotice of the well-known camp at Ardoch. Ardoch village, in\r\nPerthshire, lies on the east side of Knaigwater, ten miles north\r\nfrom Stirling, and is about two miles from the Greenloaning station\r\nof the Caledonian railway, the site of the camp being a little\r\ndistance to the north-west of the village. As this station guarded\r\nthe principal inlet into the interior of Caledonia, the Romans were\r\nparticularly anxious to fortify so advantageous a position. “The\r\nsituation of it,” says the writer of the Old Statistical Account of\r\nMuthill, “gave it many advantages; being on the north-west side of\r\na deep moss that runs a long way eastward. On the west side, it is\r\npartly defended by the steep bank of the water of Knaik; which bank\r\nrises perpendicularly between forty and fifty feet. The north and\r\neast sides were most exposed; and there we find very particular care\r\nwas taken to secure them. The ground on the east is pretty regular,\r\nand descends by a gentle slope from the lines of fortification,\r\nwhich, on that side, consists of five rows of ditches, perfectly\r\nentire, and running parallel to one another. These altogether are\r\nabout fifty-five yards in breadth. On the north side, there is an\r\nequal number of lines and ditches, but twenty yards broader than the\r\nformer. On the west, besides the steep precipices above mentioned,\r\nit was defended by at least two ditches. One is still visible; the\r\nothers have probably been filled up, in making the great military\r\nroad from Stirling to the north. The side of the camp, lying to the\r\nsouthward, exhibits to the antiquary a less pleasing prospect. Here\r\nthe peasant’s rugged hand has laid in ruins a great part of the\r\nlines; so that it may be with propriety said, in the words of a Latin\r\npoet, ‘Jam seges est, ubi Troja fuit.’ The area of the camp is an\r\noblong of 140 yards, by 125 within the lines. The general’s quarter\r\nrises above the level of the camp, but is not in the centre. It is\r\na regular square, each side being exactly twenty yards. At present\r\nit exhibits evident marks of having been enclosed with a stone wall,\r\nand contains the foundation of a house, ten yards by seven.” There\r\nare two other encampments adjoining, having a communication with one\r\nanother, and containing about 130 acres of ground. A subterranean\r\npassage is said to have extended from the prætorium under the bed of\r\nthe Knaik. Not far north of this station, on the way to Crieff, may\r\nbe traced three temporary Roman camps of different sizes. Portions of\r\nthe ramparts of these camps still exist. A mile west of Ardoch, an\r\nimmense cairn lately existed, 182 feet long, 45 broad at the base,\r\nand 30 feet in sloping height. A human skeleton, 7 feet long, in a\r\nstone coffin, was found in it.[23]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] We are indebted for great part of this description to Fullarton’s\r\n_Gazetteer of Scotland_.\r\n\r\n[2] _Caledonia Romana_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[3] The _De Situ Britanniæ_ “professed to be a manuscript of the\r\nfourteenth century, written by a monk named Richard of Cirencester,\r\nmade up by him from certain fragments left by a Roman General.

In doing so we are brought face to face with certain much\r\nagitated questions which have for centuries engaged the attention\r\nof antiquaries, and in the discussion of which many bulky tomes\r\nhave been written and incredible acrimony displayed. To enter with\r\nanything like minuteness into this discussion would occupy more space\r\nthan can be devoted to the entire history, and, moreover, would be\r\nout of place in a popular work like the present, and distasteful to\r\nmost of its readers. The following are some of the much-discussed\r\nquestions referred to:--Who were the original inhabitants of\r\nCaledonia? To what race did they belong--were they Gothic or Celtic?\r\nand if Celtic, were they Cymric or Gaelic? When did they enter\r\nScotland, and whence did they come--from the opposite continent, or\r\nfrom the south of Britain? Was the whole of Scotland, in the time of\r\nAgricola, occupied by one people, or by a mixed race, or by various\r\nraces? Were the Picts and Caledonians the same people? What is the\r\nmeaning and origin of Pict, and was Caledonia a native appellation?\r\nWhat were the localities of the Northern and Southern Picts? Who were\r\nthe Scots? What was the nature of the union of the Scots and Picts\r\nunder Kenneth Macalpin?\r\n\r\nThe notices of the early inhabitants of the Highlands in the\r\ncontemporary Roman historians are so few, the information given\r\nso meagre and indefinite, and the ecclesiastical historians of a\r\nlater time are so full of miracle, myth, and hearsay, and so little\r\nto be depended on, that it appears to us almost impossible, with\r\nthe materials at present within the historian’s reach, to arrive\r\nat anything like a satisfactory answer to the above questions. The\r\nimpression left after reading much that has been written on various\r\nsides, is one of dissatisfaction and bewilderment,--dissatisfaction\r\nwith the far-fetched and irrelevant arguments frequently adduced,\r\nand the unreliable authorities quoted, and bewilderment amid the\r\ndust-cloud of words with which any one who enters this debatable land\r\nis sure to be enveloped. “It is scarcely necessary to observe, that\r\nthere are few points of ethnology on which historians and antiquaries\r\nhave been more at variance with each other, than respecting the\r\nreal race of those inhabitants of a portion of Caledonia popularly\r\nknown by the designation of Picts. The difficulty arising from this\r\ndiscrepancy of opinion is increased by the scanty and unsatisfactory\r\nnature of the materials now available to those who wish to form an\r\nindependent judgment. No connected specimen of the Pictish language\r\nhas been preserved; nor has any ancient author who knew them from\r\npersonal observation, stated in direct terms that they approximated\r\nto one adjoining tribe more than another. They are indeed associated\r\nwith the Scots or Irish as joint plunderers of the colonial Britons;\r\nand the expression of Gildas that they differed in some degree from\r\nthe Scots in their customs, might seem to imply that they _did_ bear\r\nan analogy to that nation in certain respects. Of course, where\r\nthere is such a lack of direct evidence, there is more scope for\r\nconjecture; and the Picts are pronounced by different investigators\r\nof their history to have been Germans, Scandinavians, Welsh, Gael,\r\nor something distinct from all the four. The advocates of the German\r\nhypothesis rest chiefly on Tacitus’s description of their physical\r\nconformation. Dr. Jamieson, assuming that the present Lowland Scotch\r\ndialect was derived from them, sets them down as Scandinavians;\r\nBishop Lloyd and Camden conceive them to have been of Celtic race,\r\nprobably related to the Britons; Chalmers, the author of ‘Caledonia,’\r\nregards them as nothing more than a tribe of Cambrians or Welsh;\r\nwhile Skene, one of the latest authors on the subject, thinks he has\r\nproved that they were the ancestors of the present race of Scottish\r\nHighlanders.”[24]\r\n\r\nThe earliest known name applied to Britain is found in a treatise\r\non the World ascribed to Aristotle, in which the larger island is\r\ncalled _Albinn_, and Ireland referred to as _Ierne_; and it is\r\nworthy of notice that at the present day the former is the name\r\napplied to Scotland by the Highlanders, who call themselves the\r\n_Gael Albinnich_. The first author, however, who gives us any\r\ninformation about the early inhabitants of the north part of Scotland\r\nis Tacitus, who, in his _Life of Agricola_, devotes a few lines, in\r\na parenthetical way, to characterising each of the great divisions\r\nof the people who, in the time of that general, inhabited Britain.\r\nTacitus tells us that in his time the inhabitants of Britain differed\r\nin the habit and make of their bodies, and from the ruddy locks and\r\nlarge limbs of the Caledonians he inferred that they were of German\r\norigin.[25] This glimpse is clear enough, but tantalizing in its\r\nmeagreness and generality. What does Tacitus mean by _German_--does\r\nhe use it in the same sense as we do at the present day? Does he mean\r\nby Caledonia the whole of the country north of the Forth and Clyde,\r\nor does it apply only to that district--Fife, Forfar, the east of\r\nPerth, &c.--with the inhabitants of which his father-in-law came in\r\ncontact? We find Ptolemy the geographer, who flourished about the\r\nmiddle of the 2d century A.D., mentioning the Caledonians as one of\r\nthe many tribes which in his time inhabited the north of Scotland.\r\nThe term Caledonians is supposed by some authorities to have been\r\nderived from a native word signifying “men of the woods,” or the\r\ninhabitants of the woody country; this, however, is mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe next writer who gives any definite information as to the\r\ninhabitants of Caledonia is Dion Cassius, who flourished in the\r\nearly part of the 3d century, and who wrote a history of Rome\r\nwhich has come down to us in a very imperfect state. Of the latter\r\npart, containing an account of Britain, we possess only an epitome\r\nmade by Xiphilinus, an ecclesiastic of the 11th century, and which\r\nof course is very meagre in its details. The following are the\r\nparticulars given by this writer concerning the early inhabitants of\r\nnorth Britain. “Of the Britons the two most ample nations are the\r\nCaledonians and the Mæatæ; for the names of the rest refer for the\r\nmost part to these. The Mæatæ inhabit very near the wall[26] which\r\ndivides the island into two parts; the Caledonians are after these.\r\nEach of them inhabit mountains, very rugged and wanting water, and\r\nalso desert fields, full of marshes: they have neither castles nor\r\ncities, nor dwell in any: they live on milk and by hunting, and\r\nmaintain themselves by the fruits of the trees: for fishes, of which\r\nthere is a very great and numberless quantity, they never taste: they\r\ndwell naked in tents and without shoes: they use wives in common, and\r\nwhatever is born to them they bring up. In the popular state they\r\nare governed, as for the most part: they rob on the highway most\r\nwillingly: they war in chariots: horses they have, small and fleet;\r\ntheir infantry, also, are as well most swift at running, as most\r\nbrave in pitched battle. Their arms are a shield and a short spear,\r\nin the upper part whereof is an apple of brass, that, while it is\r\nshaken, it may terrify the enemies with the sound: they have likewise\r\ndaggers. They are able to bear hunger, cold, and all afflictions; for\r\nthey merge themselves in marshes, and there remain many days, having\r\nonly their head out of water: and in woods are nourished by the bark\r\nand roots of trees. But a certain kind of food they prepare for all\r\noccasions, of which if they take as much as ‘the size’ of a single\r\nbean, they are in nowise ever wont to hunger or thirst.”[27]\r\n\r\nFrom this we learn that in the 3d century there were two divisions\r\nof the inhabitants of the Highlands, known to the Romans as the\r\nCaledonians and Mæats or Mæatæ, the latter very probably inhabiting\r\nthe southern part of that territory, next to the wall of Antonine,\r\nand the former the district to the north of this. As to whether these\r\nwere Latinized forms of native names, or names imposed by the Romans\r\nthemselves, we have no means of judging. The best writers on this\r\nsubject think that the Caledonians and Mæats were two divisions of\r\nthe same people, both living to the north of the Forth and Clyde,\r\nalthough Innes,[28] and one or two minor writers, are of opinion that\r\nthe Mæats were provincial Britons who inhabited the country between\r\nthe wall of Hadrian and that of Antonine, known as the province of\r\nValentia. However, with Skene,[29] Mr. Joseph Robertson, and other\r\nable authorities, we are inclined to think that the evidence is in\r\nfavour of their being the inhabitants of the southern portion of\r\nCaledonia proper.\r\n\r\nHerodian,[30] who wrote about A.D. 240, tells us that the Caledonians\r\nwere in the habit of marking or painting their bodies with figures of\r\nanimals, and that they wore no clothes in order that these figures\r\nmight be preserved and exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe next reference made by a Roman writer to the inhabitants of\r\nCaledonia we find in a panegyric pronounced in his presence on the\r\nEmperor Constantius Chlorus, by Eumenius, a professor of rhetoric at\r\nAugustodunum (_Autun_) in Gaul, in the year 296 or 297, who speaks\r\nof the Britons, in the time of Cæsar, having been attacked by the\r\nhalf-naked _Picts_ and Irish. To what people the orator meant to\r\napply the term _Picts_, around which there has clustered so much\r\nacrimonious disputation, we learn from another oration pronounced\r\nby him on the same emperor, before his son Constantine, in the year\r\n309, in which, recording the actions of Constantius, he speaks of the\r\nwoods and marshes of _the Caledonians and other Picts_.\r\n\r\nAfter this no further mention is made of the Caledonians by any Roman\r\nwriter, but towards the end of the 4th century Ammianus Marcellinus,\r\nin his account of the Roman transactions in Britain, speaks of the\r\nPicts in conjunction with the Saxons, Scots, and Attacots harassing\r\nthe provincial Britons about the year 364. Further on he informs us\r\nthat at this time the Picts were divided into two tribes or nations,\r\nthe Dicaledones and Vecturiones, remarking, at the same time, that\r\n“the Attacots were a warlike race of men, and the Scots a people much\r\ngiven to wandering, and in the habit of ravaging or laying waste the\r\ndistricts into which they came.”[31]\r\n\r\nClaudian the poet, writing, about 397, in praise of Honorius,\r\nmentions, among other actions of Theodosius, the grandfather of that\r\nemperor, his having subdued the Picts, who were fitly so named,[32]\r\nand makes various other references to this people and the Scots,\r\nwhich show that these two in combination were troubling the Roman\r\nprovincials not a little.[33]\r\n\r\nSuch are most of the scanty details given by the only contemporary\r\nhistorians who take any notice of the inhabitants of North Britain;\r\nand the unprejudiced reader will see that the foundation thus\r\nafforded upon which to construct any elaborate theory is so narrow\r\nthat every such theory must resemble a pyramid standing on its apex,\r\nliable at the slightest touch to topple over and be shattered to\r\npieces. It appears to us that all the conclusions which it is safe to\r\ndraw from the few facts stated by the contemporary Roman historians\r\nare, that at the commencement of the Christian era Caledonia proper,\r\nor the Highlands, was inhabited by a people or peoples apparently\r\nconsiderable in number, and who in all probability had been settled\r\nthere for a considerable time, part of whom at least were known to\r\nthe Romans by the name of Caledonians. That these Caledonians, those\r\nof them at any rate with whom Agricola came in contact in the first\r\ncentury, were red or fair haired and large limbed, from which Tacitus\r\ninferred that they were of German extraction. In the beginning of the\r\nthird century there were at least two divisions of the inhabitants\r\nof Caledonia,--the Caledonians and Mæats,--the former inhabiting\r\nthe country to the north of the Grampians, and the latter, in all\r\nprobability, that to the south and south-east of these mountains.\r\nThey appear to have been in many respects in a condition little\r\nremoved from that of savages, although they must have made wonderful\r\nattainments in the manufacture of implements of war.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the third century we found the Highlanders\r\nspoken of under a new name, _Picti_, which the Roman historians\r\nat least, undoubtedly understood to be the Latin word meaning\r\n‘painted,’[34] and which all the best modern writers believe to\r\nhave been imposed by the Romans themselves, from the fact that the\r\nindomitable Caledonians had retained the custom of self-painting\r\nafter all the Romanized Britons had given it up. There is the\r\nstrongest probability that the Caledonians spoken of as Picts by\r\nEumenius were the same as the Caledonians of Tacitus, or that the\r\nCaledonians and Picts were the same people under different names.\r\nThe immediate cause for this change of name we have no means of\r\nascertaining. It is in every way improbable that the Picts were a\r\nnew people, who had come in upon the Caledonians, and supplanted\r\nthem some time after Agricola’s invasion. The Romans were constantly\r\ncoming into contact with the Caledonians from the time of Agricola\r\ntill they abandoned Britain entirely, and had such a supplantation\r\ntaken place, it certainly could not have been done quietly, and\r\nwithout the cognizance of the Romans. But we find no mention in any\r\ncontemporary historian of any such commotion, and we know that the\r\ninhabitants of the Highlands never ceased to harass the British\r\nprovincials, showing that they were not much taken up with any\r\ninternal disturbance. Indeed, writers who adopt the most diverse\r\nopinions on other points in connection with the Pictish question are\r\nall agreed as to this, that the Caledonians and Picts were the same\r\npeople.[35]\r\n\r\nWe learn further from our authorities, that towards the end of the\r\nfourth century the inhabitants of Caledonia were known to the Romans\r\nunder the names of Dicaledones and Vecturiones, it being conjectured\r\nthat these correspond to the Caledonians and Mæats of Dio, and the\r\nNorthern and Southern Picts of a later period. The connection of the\r\nlatter part of the word Di-caledones with _Caledonii_ is evident,\r\nalthough the significance of the first syllable is doubtful,--some\r\nauthorities conjecturing that it is the Gaelic word _du_, meaning\r\n“genuine.” It appears at all events to be established that during\r\nthe early history of the Highlands, whatever other divisions may\r\nhave existed among the inhabitants, those dwelling to the north\r\nand those dwelling to the south of the Grampians were two separate\r\nconfederacies, and were known by distinct names.\r\n\r\nAnother not unimportant fact to be learned from the Roman historians\r\nin relation to the Picts or Caledonians is, that about the middle\r\nof the 4th century they were assisted by the Attacots, Saxons, and\r\nScots. As to who the Attacots were it is now impossible to conjecture\r\nwith anything like certainty, there being no sufficient reason for\r\nbelieving that they were allied to the Irish Scots. It is well enough\r\nknown who the Saxons were, but how they came at this early period to\r\nbe acting in concert with the Picts it is difficult to say. It is\r\npossible that numbers of them may have effected a settlement, even\r\nat this early period, in North Britain, although it is more likely\r\nthat they were roving adventurers, who had left their homes, from\r\nchoice or on compulsion, to try their fortune in Britain. They were\r\nprobably the first droppings of the abundant shower that overwhelmed\r\nSouth Britain a century later. The Romans at this period had an\r\nofficer with the title of “Comes litoris Saxonici per Britanniam;”\r\nand Claudian, in his praises of Stilicho, introduces Britain, saying--\r\n\r\n      “Illius effectum curis, ne bella timerem\r\n      Scotica, ne Pictum tremerem, ne littore toto\r\n      Prospicerem dubiis venturum Saxona ventis.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that this[36] is the first mention made\r\nof the Scots in connection with what is now Scotland; but whether\r\nthere were settlements of them at this time among the Picts, or\r\nwhether they had come over from Ireland for the purpose of assisting\r\nthe latter to harass the Romans, it is difficult to say. Probably, as\r\nwas the case with the Saxons, these were the harbingers of the great\r\nmigration that reached its culmination about a century and a half\r\nlater. They appear, from what Ammianus says, to have been at this\r\ntime a set of destructive vagabonds. We shall have more to say about\r\nthem further on.\r\n\r\nFrom the general tone of these contemporary Roman historians we\r\nlearn that, whether Celtic or Gothic, these Picts or Caledonians\r\nwere a hardy, indomitable, determined race, with a strong love of\r\nliberty and of the country in which they dwelt, and a resolution\r\nnever to be subject to the greedy Roman. Comparatively few and\r\nbarbarous as they were, they caused the Romans far more trouble\r\nthan all the rest of Britain together; to conquer the latter and\r\nRomanize it appears to have been comparatively smooth work, but the\r\nItalians acknowledged the Highlanders invincible by building walls\r\nand other fortifications, and maintaining extra garrisons to protect\r\nthe provincials from their fierce and wasting inroads. Whether\r\nthe present Highlanders are the descendants of these or not, they\r\ncertainly possess many of their qualities.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that the Roman historians give us almost no\r\nclue to what we now deem of most interest and importance, the place\r\nof the early inhabitants among the families of men, the time and\r\nmanner of their arrival, the language they spoke, and their internal\r\nhistory generally. Of course the records of contemporaries stand in\r\nthe first place of importance as evidences, and although we have\r\nother sources, historical, linguistic, and antiquarian, which shed a\r\nlittle light upon the subject, these, for various reasons, must be\r\nused with great caution. The only statement approaching to anything\r\nlike a hint as to the origin of the Caledonians is that of Tacitus,\r\nreferring to their ruddy locks and large limbs as an evidence of\r\ntheir German origin. There is no reason to doubt that those with whom\r\nAgricola came in contact were of this make and complexion, which, at\r\nthe present day, are generally held to be indicative of a Teutonic\r\norigin; whereas the true Celt is popularly believed to be of a small\r\nmake and dark complexion.[37] It may have been, that in Agricola’s\r\ntime the part of the country into which he penetrated was occupied\r\nby considerable numbers of Teutons, who had effected a settlement\r\neither by force, or by favour of the prior inhabitants. The statement\r\nof Tacitus, however, those who uphold the Celtic theory endeavour to\r\nexplain away.\r\n\r\nWe may safely say then, that with regard to all the most important\r\npoints that have excited the curiosity of modern enquirers, the\r\nonly contemporary historians to whom we can appeal, leave us almost\r\nentirely in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe writers, next in order of importance to whom an appeal is\r\nmade as witnesses in this perplexing case, are the ecclesiastical\r\nchroniclers, the chief of whom are Gildas, Adamnan, Bede, Nennius.\r\n“Much of the error into which former writers have been led, has\r\narisen from an improper use of these authors; they should be\r\nconsulted exclusively as contemporary historians--whatever they\r\nassert as existing or occurring in their own time, or shortly before\r\nit, we may receive as true; but when we consider the perverted\r\nlearning of that period, and the little information which they appear\r\nto have possessed of the traditions of the people around them, we\r\nought to reject their fables or fanciful origins as altogether\r\nundeserving of credit.”[38] Though this dictum may perhaps be\r\ntoo sweeping, still any one who examines the authors referred to\r\nfor himself, must admit that it is in the main just. It is well\r\nknown that these writers exercise little or no discrimination in\r\nthe composition of their narratives, that tradition, miracle, and\r\nobserved fact are placed side by side, as all equally worthy of\r\nbelief. Even Bede, the most reliable and cautious of these early\r\nchroniclers, lived as long after some of the events of which he\r\nprofesses to give an account, as we of the present day do after the\r\ntime of the Crusades; almost his sole authority being tradition or\r\nhearsay. Moreover, the knowledge which these writers had of the\r\ndistinction between the various races of mankind was so very hazy,\r\nthe terms they use are to us so comparatively unintelligible, and the\r\ninformation they do contain on the points in dispute so brief, vague,\r\nand parenthetical, that their value as authorities is reduced almost\r\nto a minimum.\r\n\r\nWhoever was the author of the work _De Excidio Britanniæ_, one of\r\nthe latest and most acute writers[39] on ethnology has shown that he\r\nis almost totally unworthy of credit, the sources of his information\r\nbeing exceedingly suspicious, and his statements proved to be false\r\nby comparison with trustworthy contemporary Roman historians.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the so-called Gildas--for\r\nby Mr. Wright[40] he has been reduced to a _nominis umbra_--lived\r\nand wrote about the middle of the 6th century A.D., so that, had\r\nhe used ordinary diligence and discrimination, he might have been\r\nof considerable assistance in enabling us to solve the perplexing\r\nmystery of the Pictish question. But indeed we have no right to\r\nlook for much history in the work of Gildas, as it professes to be\r\nmerely a complaint “on the general destruction of every thing that is\r\ngood, and the general growth of evil throughout the land;” it is his\r\npurpose, he says, “to relate the deeds of an indolent and slothful\r\nrace, rather than the exploits of those who have been valiant in the\r\nfield.”[41] So far as the origin and early history of the Picts is\r\nconcerned, Gildas is of almost no value whatever, the only time he\r\nmentions the Picts being incidentally to notice an invasion they had\r\nmade into the Roman provinces.[42] If we can trust him, the Picts\r\nand their allies, the Scots, must have been very fierce enemies to\r\ndeal with. They went about, he tells us, almost entirely destitute\r\nof clothes, having their faces covered with bushy hair, and were in\r\nthe habit of dragging the poor enervated Britons from the top of\r\ntheir protecting wall with hooked weapons, slaughtering them without\r\nmercy. Some writers infer from this narrative that, during the Roman\r\noccupation, no permanent settlement of Scots had been effected in\r\npresent Scotland, but that the Scots who assisted the Picts came\r\nover from their native Scotland (Ireland) for that purpose; he tells\r\nus that the Scots came from the north-west, and the Picts from the\r\nnorth.[43] “North-west” here, however, would apply quite as well to\r\nArgyle as to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe writer next in chronological order from whom we derive any\r\ninformation of consequence concerning the Picts is Adamnan, a member\r\nof the early Irish Church, who was born in the county of Donegal\r\nabout the year 625, elected abbot of Iona in 679, and who died in\r\nthe year 704. Adamnan wrote a life of his great predecessor St.\r\nColumba, in which is contained much information concerning that\r\ngreat missionary’s labours among the Northern Picts; and although\r\nhe narrates many stories which are palpably incredible, still the\r\nbook contains much which may with confidence be accepted as fact. In\r\nconnection with the questions under consideration, we learn that,\r\nin the time of Columba and Adamnan, there were--as formerly, in the\r\ntime of the Roman writers--two divisions of the Picts, known in\r\nthe 7th century and afterwards as the Northern and Southern Picts.\r\nAdamnan informs us that Columba’s mission was to the Northern Picts\r\nalone,--the southern division having been converted by St. Ninian in\r\nthe 5th century. There has been much disputation as to the precise\r\ndistrict inhabited by each of these two divisions of the Picts,--some\r\nmaintaining that the southern division occupied the country to the\r\nsouth of the Forth and Clyde, while the Northern Picts occupied the\r\nwhole district to the north of these estuaries. The best authorities,\r\nhowever, are of opinion that both divisions dwelt to the north of\r\nAntonine’s wall, and were divided from each other by the Grampians.\r\n\r\nWhat more immediately concerns our present purpose is a passage in\r\nAdamnan’s work in which he speaks of Columba preaching to the Picts\r\nthrough an interpreter. Now Columba was an Irish Scot, whose native\r\ntongue was Gaelic, and it is from this argued that the Picts to\r\nwhom he preached must have spoken a different language, or at least\r\ndialect, and belonged to a different race or tribe from the saint\r\nhimself. Mr. Skene,[44] who ably advocates the Gaelic origin of the\r\nPicts, perceiving this difficulty, endeavours to explain away the\r\nforce of the passage by making it mean that Columba “interpreted or\r\nexplained the word of God, that is, the Bible, which, being written\r\nin Latin, would doubtless require to be interpreted to them.” The\r\npassage as quoted by Skene is, “Verbo Dei per interpretorem recepto.”\r\nGarnett, however, one of the most competent and candid writers on\r\nthis question in its philological aspect, and who maintains, with the\r\ngreatest clearness and ability, the Cymric origin of the Picts, looks\r\nat the passage in a different light. The entire passage, he says,[45]\r\nas it stands in Colganus, is as follows:--“Alio in tempore quo\r\nsanctus Columba in Pictorum provincia per aliquot demorabatur dies,\r\nquidam cum tota plebeius familia, verbum _vitæ_ per interpretorem,\r\n_Sancto prædicante viro_, audiens credidit, credensque baptizatus\r\nest.”[46] “Here it will be observed,” continues Garnett, “Adamnan\r\ndoes not say, ‘verbum Dei,’ which might have been construed to mean\r\nthe Scripture, but ‘verbum _vitæ, Sancto prædicante viro_,’ which can\r\nhardly mean anything but ‘the word of life, as it was preached by\r\nthe Saint.’” Certainly, we think, the unprejudiced reader must admit\r\nthat, so far as this point is concerned, Mr. Garnett has the best of\r\nit. Although at that time the Gaelic and Cymric dialects may have had\r\nmuch more in common than they have at the present day, nevertheless\r\nit appears to be beyond a doubt that the difference between the two\r\nwas so great that a Gael would be unintelligible to a speaker of\r\nCymric.[47]\r\n\r\nThe next and most important authority of this class on this _quæstio\r\nvexata_ is the Venerable Bede, who, considering the age in which he\r\nlived, exercised so much caution and discrimination, that he deserves\r\nto be listened to with respect. Bede was born about 673. He was\r\neducated in the Monastery of Wearmouth, whence he removed to Jarrow,\r\nwhere he was ordained deacon in his nineteenth year, and priest in\r\nhis thirtieth, and where he spent the rest of his days, dying in\r\n735. He wrote many works, but the most important is the _Historia\r\nEcclesiastica Gentis Anglorum_, the materials for which he obtained\r\nchiefly from native chronicles and biographies, records and public\r\ndocuments, and oral and written communications from contemporaries.\r\n\r\nWe shall transcribe most of the passage in which Bede speaks of the\r\nancient inhabitants of Britain; so that our readers may be able to\r\njudge for themselves of the nature and value of the testimony borne\r\nby this venerable author. It must, however, be kept in mind that Bede\r\ndoes not pretend to give any but the ecclesiastical history of the\r\nEnglish nation, everything else being subsidiary to this.\r\n\r\n“This island at present, following the number of the books in which\r\nthe Divine law was written, contains five nations, the English,\r\nBritons, Scots, Picts, and Latins, each in its own peculiar dialect\r\ncultivating the sublime study of Divine truth. The Latin tongue is,\r\nby the study of the Scriptures, become common to all the rest. At\r\nfirst this island had no other inhabitants but the Britons, from\r\nwhom it derived its name, and who coming over into Britain, as is\r\nreported, from Armorica, possessed themselves of the southern parts\r\nthereof. When they, beginning at the south, had made themselves\r\nmaster of the greatest part of the island, it happened, that the\r\nnation of the Picts coming into the ocean from Scythia, as is\r\nreported, in a few tall ships, were driven by the winds beyond the\r\nshores of Britain and arrived off Ireland, on the northern coasts,\r\nwhere, finding the nation of the Scots, they requested to be allowed\r\nto settle among them, but could not succeed in obtaining their\r\nrequest. The Scots answered, that the island could not contain them\r\nboth; but ‘we can give you good advice,’ said they, ‘what to do; we\r\nknow there is another island, not far from ours, to the eastward,\r\nwhich we often see at a distance, when the days are clear. If you\r\nwill repair thither, you may be able to obtain settlements; or if\r\nthey should oppose you, you may make use of us as auxiliaries.’\r\nThe Picts accordingly sailing over into Britain, began to inhabit\r\nthe northern parts thereof, for the Britons were possessed of the\r\nsouthern. Now the Picts having no wives, and asking them of the\r\nScots, they would not consent to grant them upon any other terms,\r\nthan that when any difficulty should arise, they should rather choose\r\nthemselves a king from the female royal race than from the male;\r\nwhich custom, as is well known, has been observed among the Picts\r\nto this day. In process of time, Britain, besides the Britons and\r\nthe Picts, received a third nation, the Scots, who, departing out of\r\nIreland under their leader Reuda, either by fair means, or by force\r\nof arms, secured to themselves those settlements among the Picts\r\nwhich they still possess. From the name of their commander, they are\r\nto this day called Dalreudins; for in their language _Dal_ signifies\r\na part.... It is properly the country of the Scots, who, migrating\r\nfrom thence, as has been said, added a third nation in Britain to the\r\nBritons and the Picts. There is a very large gulf of the sea, which\r\nformerly divided the nation of the Picts from the Britons; which gulf\r\nruns from the west very far into the land, where, to this day, stands\r\nthe strong city of the Britons, called Alcluith. The Scots arriving\r\non the north side of this bay, settled themselves there.”[48]\r\n\r\nHere then Bede informs us that in his time the common report was\r\nthat the Picts came into Scotland from Scythia, which, like the\r\nGermania of Tacitus, may be taken to mean the northern countries of\r\nEurope generally. This is substantially the same statement as that of\r\nthe author of the _Historia Britonum_, commonly called Nennius, who\r\nlived in the 9th century, and who informs us that the Picts coming to\r\nScotland about 300 B.C., occupied the Orkney Islands, whence issuing,\r\nthey laid waste many regions, and seized those on the left-hand\r\nside, _i.e._ the north of Britain, where they still remained in the\r\nwriter’s time, keeping possession of a third part of Britain.[49]\r\n\r\nSupposing that Bede’s report was quite in accordance with truth,\r\nstill it gives us but small help in coming to a conclusion as to the\r\nplace of these Picts among the families of men. It is certain that by\r\nfar the greater part of Europe had at one time a Celtic population\r\nwho preceded, but ultimately gave way to another wave of emigrants\r\nfrom the east. Now, if we knew the date at which this so-called\r\nmigration of the Picts took place it might be of considerable\r\nassistance to us; but as we cannot now find out whether these\r\nemigrants proceeded from a Celtic or a Teutonic stock, the statement\r\nof Bede, even if reliable, helps us not at all towards a solution\r\nof the question as to the race of the Picts. Innes[50] remarks very\r\njustly on this point--“Now, supposing that there were any good ground\r\nfor the opinion of these two writers, which they themselves give only\r\nas a conjecture or hearsay, and that we had any certainty of the\r\nCaledonians, or Picts, having had their origin from the more northern\r\nparts of the European continent, it were an useless, as well as an\r\nendless discussion, to examine in particular from which of all the\r\nnorthern nations of the continent the first colony came to Caledonia;\r\nbecause that these nations of the north were almost in perpetual\r\nmotion, and changing habitations, as Strabo remarks; and he assigns\r\nfor it two reasons: the one, because of the barrenness of the soil,\r\nthey tilled not the ground, and built habitations only for a day; the\r\nother, because being often overpowered by their neighbours, they were\r\nforced to remove. Another reason why it is impossible to know from\r\nwhich of those nations the northern parts of Britain, (supposing\r\nthey came from thence) were at first peopled, is because we have\r\nbut very lame accounts of these northern nations from the Greek or\r\nRoman writers, (from whom alone we can look for any thing certain\r\nin those early times) especially of those of Scandia, to the north\r\nof the Baltic sea, as the same Strabo observes. Besides, it appears\r\nthat Caledonia was peopled long before the inhabitants of these\r\nnorthern parts of the continent were mentioned, or even known by the\r\nmost ancient writers we have; and perhaps before the first nations\r\nmentioned by them were settled in those parts.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another statement made by Bede in the passage\r\nquoted, upon which, as it refers to his own time, much more reliance\r\ncan be placed; it is, that in his time Britain contained five\r\nnations, each having its own peculiar dialect, viz., the English,\r\nBritons, Scots, Picts, and Latins. We know that the English spoke\r\nin the main Saxon; the Britons, _i.e._, the inhabitants of Wales,\r\nCumbria, &c., Welsh; the Scots, Gaelic; the Latins, we suppose, being\r\nthe Romanized Britons and ecclesiastics. What language then did the\r\nPicts speak? As we know that Bede never travelled, he must have got\r\nhis information from an informant or by hearsay, which circumstance\r\nrather detracts from its value. But supposing we take the passage\r\nliterally as it stands, we learn that in Bede’s time there were five\r\ndistinct peoples or nations, whose names he gives, sharing among them\r\nthe island. He does not say there were five distinct tongues, which\r\nwould have been quite a different statement; he speaks of them not\r\nso much in respect of their language as in respect of their being\r\nthe separate items which composed the inhabitants of Britain. In his\r\ntime they were all quite distinct, in a measure independent of and\r\nat enmity with each other. He does not classify them in respect of\r\nthe race to which they belonged, but with reference to the particular\r\ndistricts which they inhabited, and perhaps with regard to the time\r\nand means of their conversion to Christianity, each having been\r\nconverted at a different time and by a different saint. The substance\r\nthen of what he says appears to be, that there were in his time\r\nfive distinct tribes or congregations of people in Britain, each\r\nconverted to Christianity, and each having the gospel preached in\r\nits own tongue. Supposing that the Picts and Scots, or Picts and\r\nBritons, or Picts and English did speak exactly the same tongue,\r\nit is not at all likely that Bede, in the present case, would have\r\nclassed them together as both being one nation. Moreover, suppose we\r\nallow that Bede did mean that each of these nations spoke a language\r\nquite distinct from all the others, then his statement cuts equally\r\nat the Gothic and Celtic theory. The conclusion we are forced to is,\r\nthat from this passage nothing can be gained to help us out of our\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThere is a statement at the end of the passage quoted to which we\r\nwould draw the reader’s attention, as being Bede’s way, and no doubt\r\nthe universal way in his time, of accounting for a peculiar law which\r\nappears to have regulated the succession to the Pictish throne, and\r\nwhich ultimately, according to some, was the means of placing on that\r\nthrone a Scottish monarch; thus accounting to some extent for the\r\nsudden disappearance and apparent destruction of the Pictish people\r\nand language.\r\n\r\nWe shall here refer to one other passage in the same historian, which\r\nhas perhaps given rise to greater and more acrimonious contention\r\nthan any other point in connection with this wordy discussion. The\r\nonly word that has come down to us, which, with the exception of\r\nthe names of the Pictish kings, we can be sure is a remnant of the\r\nPictish language, is the name said by Bede to have been given to the\r\neastern termination of the wall of Antonine. Bede,[51] in speaking\r\nof the turf wall built by the Britons of Valentia in the beginning\r\nof the 5th century, says, “it begins at about two miles distance\r\nfrom the monastery of Abercorn on the west, at a place called in the\r\nPictish language _Peanfahel_, but in the English tongue Penneltum.”\r\nThis statement of Bede’s is straightforward and clear enough, and\r\nhas never been disputed by any writer on any one of the three sides\r\nof the question. Nevertheless it has been used by the advocates\r\nrespectively of the Gothic, Gaelic, and Cymric origin of the Picts,\r\nas an undoubted proof of the correctness of each of these theories.\r\nPinkerton, whose dishonesty and acrimoniousness are well known, and\r\nmust detract considerably from the force of his arguments, claims\r\nit as being entirely Gothic or Teutonic. “The Pictish word,” he\r\nsays,[52] “is broad Gothic; _Paena_ ‘to extend,’ Ihre; and _Vahel_,\r\na broad sound of _veal_, the Gothic for ‘wall,’ or of the Latin\r\n_vallum_, contracted _val_; hence it means ‘the extent or end of\r\nthe wall.’” This statement of Pinkerton’s may be dismissed as too\r\nfar-fetched and awkward to merit much consideration, and we may\r\nsafely regard the word as capable of satisfactory explanation only\r\nin Celtic. Innes, who upholds the British, _i.e._ the Cymric, origin\r\nof the Picts, says,[53] “we nowhere find a clearer proof of the\r\nPictish language being the same as the British [Welsh], than in Bede,\r\nwhere he tells us that _Penuahel_ in Pictish signifies the head of\r\nthe wall, which is just the signification that the same two words\r\n_Pen_ and _Uahel_ have in the British.” In this opinion Chalmers\r\nand other advocates of the Cymric theory coincide. Mr. Garnett, who\r\nessentially agrees with Innes and Chalmers as to the Cymric origin\r\nof the Picts, lays little stress upon this word as furnishing an\r\nargument in support of his theory. “Almost the only Pictish word\r\ngiven us by an ancient writer is the well-known _Pen val_ (or as it\r\nappears in the oldest MSS. of Bede (_Peann fahel_)), the name given\r\nby the Picts to the _Wall’s End_, or eastern termination of the\r\nVallum of Antoninus. It is scarcely necessary to say the first part\r\nof the word is decidedly Cymric; _pen_, head, being contrary to all\r\nGaelic analogy. The latter half might be plausibly claimed as the\r\nGaelic _fal_; _gwall_ being the more common termination in Welsh for\r\na wall or rampart. _Fal_, however, does occur in Welsh in the sense\r\nof _inclosure_, a signification not very remote.”[54]\r\n\r\nThe two most recent and able supporters[55] of the Gaelic theory\r\nare of much the same mind as Garnett, and appear to regard this\r\ntantalizing word as affording no support to either side. Burton[56]\r\ncannot admit that anything has been made out of this leading to a\r\nhistorical conclusion.\r\n\r\nWe may safely conclude, then, that this so called Pictish word, or,\r\nindeed, any information which we find in Bede, affords us no key to\r\nthe perplexing question of the origin and race of the Picts.\r\n\r\nWe learn, however, one fact from Bede[57] which is so far\r\nsatisfactory, viz., that in his time there were two divisions of\r\nthe Picts, known as the Northern and Southern Picts, which were\r\nseparated from each other by steep and rugged mountains. On reading\r\nthe passage in Bede, one very naturally supposes that the steep and\r\nrugged mountains must be the Grampians, to which the expression\r\napplies more aptly than to any other mountain-chain in Scotland. Even\r\nthis, however, has been made matter of dispute, it being contended by\r\nsome that the locality of the Southern Picts was in the south-west\r\nand south of Scotland, where some writers set up a powerful Pictish\r\nkingdom. Mr. Grub,[58] however, has clearly shown that the locality\r\nof the Southern Picts was to the north of the Forth and Clyde, and to\r\nthe south of the Grampians. “The mistake formerly so common in regard\r\nto the country of the Southern Picts converted by St. Ninian, was in\r\npart owing to the situation of Candida Casa. It was supposed that\r\nhis see must have been in the country of those whom he converted.”\r\nHe clearly proves that it was not so in reality, and that there was\r\nnothing so unusual in the situation as to justify the conclusion\r\nwhich was drawn from it. “It was, no doubt, the case that the\r\nteachers by whom the chief Celtic and Teutonic nations were converted\r\ngenerally fixed their seat among those whom they instructed in the\r\nfaith. But there was no necessity for this, especially when the\r\nresidence of the teacher was in the neighbourhood of his converts.\r\nSt. Columba was primate of all the churches of the Northern Picts,\r\nbut he did not permanently reside among that nation. St. Ninian had\r\nready access to his Pictish converts, and could govern them as\r\neasily from his White Church on the Solway, as Columba could instruct\r\nand rule the Northern Picts from his monastery in Iona.”[59]\r\n\r\nOther authorities appealed to by the upholders of each of the Celtic\r\ntheories are the Welsh traditions, the Irish Annals, the Chronicles\r\nof the Picts and Scots, and various legendary documents of more or\r\nless value and authenticity. As these are of no greater authority\r\nthan the writers with whom we have been dealing, and as the partisans\r\nof each theory claim the various passages as either confirming, or,\r\nat any rate, not contradicting their views, we shall not further\r\ntrouble the reader with specimens of the manner in which they are\r\ndealt with. There is one passage, however, in the Welsh Triads,\r\nwhich the advocates of the Gaelic hypothesis claim as strongly\r\nconfirmatory of their theory. After referring to the coming in of\r\nthe Cymry, the Britons, etc., the Triads[60] go on to say, “Three\r\ntribes came, under protection, into the Island of Britain, and by the\r\nconsent and permission of the nation of the Cymry, without weapon,\r\nwithout assault. The first was the tribe of the Caledonians in the\r\nnorth. The second was the Gwyddelian Race, which are now in Alban\r\n(Scotland). The third were the men of Galedin, who came into the\r\nIsle of Wight. Three usurping tribes came into the Island of Britain\r\nand never departed out of it. The first were the _Coranied_, who\r\ncame from the land of Pwyl. The second were the Gwyddelian Ffichti,\r\nwho came into Alban over the sea of _Llychlyn_ (Denmark). The\r\nthird were the Saxons.” “The Triads,” says Skene[61] in connection\r\nwith this, “appear distinctly to have been written previous to the\r\nScottish conquest in the ninth century, and they mention among the\r\nthree usurping tribes of Britain the ‘_Gwyddyl Ffichti_,’ and add\r\nimmediately afterwards, ‘and these Gwyddyl Ffichti are in Alban,\r\nalong the shore of the sea of _Llychlyn_.’ In another place, among\r\nthe treacherous tribes of Britain, the same Triads mention the\r\n‘Gwyddyl coch o’r Werddon a ddaethant in Alban,’ that is ‘the Red\r\nGwyddyl from Ireland, who came into Alban,’ plainly alluding to the\r\nDalriads, who were an Irish colony, and who have been acknowledged\r\nby all to have been a Gaelic race. It will be observed from these\r\npassages that the Welsh Triads, certainly the oldest and most\r\nunexceptionable authority on the subject, apply the same term of\r\nGwyddyl to the Picts and to the Dalriads, and consequently they must\r\nhave been of the same race, and the Picts a Gaelic people. Farther,\r\nthe Welsh word ‘Gwyddyl,’ by which they distinguish that race, has\r\nbeen declared by all the best authorities to be exactly synonymous\r\nwith the word Gael, the name by which the Highlanders have at all\r\ntimes been distinguished, and the Welsh words ‘Gwyddyl Ffichti’\r\ncannot be interpreted to mean any thing else than ‘The Gaelic Picts,’\r\n_or_ ‘Pictish Gael.’”\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of the information given by the Irish\r\nwriters as to the origin, race, and early history of the Picts.\r\nThe greater part of it is, of course, mere tradition, accumulating\r\nas it grew older, and heightened by the imagination of the writers\r\nthemselves.[62] The Picts were called by the Irish writers\r\n_Cruithnidh_, which O’Brien considers to be the same as Britneigh,\r\nor Britons; but according to others the name was derived from\r\n_Cruthen_, who founded the kingdom of the Picts in North Britain,\r\nin the first century; others derive the name from _Cruit_, a harp,\r\nhence Cruitneach, the Irish for Pict, also signifies a harper, as\r\nthey are said to have been celebrated harpers. The ancient Britons\r\nare mentioned by Cæsar, and other Roman writers, to have painted\r\ntheir bodies of a blue colour, with the juice of a plant called\r\nwoad, hence the painted Britons were called by the Romans _Picti_.\r\nThe Picts or Cruthneans, according to the Psalter of Cashel, and\r\nother ancient annals, came from Thrace, in the reign of the Milesian\r\nmonarch Heremon, nearly a thousand years before the Christian era,\r\nand landed at Inver Slainge, now the Bay of Wexford, under two chief\r\ncommanders named Gud and Cathluan, but not being permitted to settle\r\nin Ireland, they sailed to Albain, or that part of North Britain, now\r\nScotland, their chiefs having been kindly supplied with wives of\r\nIrish birth. The Cruthneans became possessed of North Britain, and\r\nfounded there the kingdom of the Picts. A colony of the Cruthneans,\r\nor Picts, from North Britain, settled in Ulster in early times, and\r\nare often mentioned from the first to the ninth century; they resided\r\nchiefly in Dalaradia and Tir Eogain, or parts of Down, Antrim, and\r\nDerry, and became mixed by intermarriages with the old Irish of the\r\nIrian race, and were ruled over by their own princes and chiefs; and\r\nsome of those Picts, also settled in Connaught, in the county of\r\nRoscommon. According to the Irish writers, the Picts, in their first\r\nprogress to Ireland from Thrace, settled a colony in Gaul, and the\r\ntribes called Pictones and Pictavi, in that country, were descended\r\nfrom them, and they gave name to Pictavia, or the city of Poictiers,\r\nand the province of Poitou; and from these Picts were descended\r\nthe Vendeans of France. _The Caledonians_, or first inhabitants of\r\nScotland, are considered to have been the same as the Picts, and\r\nmixed with Cimbrians or Britons, and some of the Milesian Scots from\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the various theories, apparently aware of how little\r\ncan be made of the meagre and suspicious information afforded by\r\nthese early histories and chronicles, have latterly made language\r\nthe principal battle-ground on which to fight out this endless and\r\nprofitless strife. Most of them take for granted that if the language\r\nspoken by any people can be found out, a sure indication is afforded\r\nof the race to which that people belonged; and that the topography\r\nof a country must necessarily have been imposed by the earliest\r\ninhabitants of whom we have record; and that, if so, the limits of\r\ntheir territory must have been co-extensive with the limits of such\r\ntopography. This, however, is going too far. All the length to which\r\nwe are permitted in fairness to go, when we find in any district\r\nor country an abundance of names of natural objects, as rivers and\r\nmountains, which can with certainty be traced to any particular\r\nlanguage, is, that at one time or other, a race of people speaking\r\nthis language must have passed over and dwelt for some time in that\r\nparticular district or country. We find Celtic names of rivers and\r\nmountains scattered all over Europe, in the midst of peoples who are\r\nadmitted on all hands to have little or none of the Celtic element\r\nin them.[63] So that an unprejudiced judge must admit that the fact\r\nof Cymric and Gaelic words being found in certain districts of the\r\nnorth of Scotland argues only that at one time people speaking these\r\ndialects must have dwelt in these districts. It affords no proof by\r\nitself that the people whom we first meet with in these districts are\r\nthe people who spoke these dialects, and who imposed these names; nor\r\nindeed, if we could be sure that the people whom we first meet with\r\nas inhabitants also spoke the dialect to which such names belong,\r\ndoes it prove that they were the imposers of these names, that the\r\ndialect was their native and original tongue, and that they had not\r\nacquired it either as conquerors or conquered. Nor can it be adduced\r\nas a proof of sameness of race, that the present inhabitants of any\r\nparticular district speak the same language as those who inhabited\r\nthat district 1800 years ago or less. “He who trusts to language, and\r\nespecially to written language, alone, as an index to race, must be\r\nprepared to maintain that the Gallic nation emigrated from the seven\r\nhills of Rome, and that the Franks came with them; that the Romans\r\nextirpated the Celts and Iberians of Spain, and that the Goths and\r\nMoors spoke nearly the same language as the Romans; that the Negroes\r\nof the United States and Jamaica were exported from England when in\r\ntheir infancy. So would Philology, if left to herself, interpret\r\nphenomena, of which we know, from other sources of information, that\r\nthe causes are totally different.”[64] “The clearest proof that a\r\nmountain or river has a Celtic name, only shows that at some time\r\nor other Celts had been there; it does not tell us when they were\r\nthere. Names, as the experience of the world amply shows, live after\r\nthe people who bestowed them have long disappeared, and that through\r\nsuccessive races of occupants.”[65]\r\n\r\nThe materials which have been wrought up into a linguistic argument\r\nby the upholders of each of the three Pictish theories, Gothic,\r\nGaelic, and Cymric, are chiefly a list of Pictish kings which, we\r\nbelieve, may be depended on as authentic, and the topography of the\r\ncountry to the east and south-east of the Grampians, together with\r\nthe single so-called Pictish word _Peanfahel_, which we have already\r\nconsidered. The theorists differ as much in their interpretation\r\nof the significance of what remains of the Pictish language, as we\r\nhave seen they do in their interpretation of any references to the\r\nsubject in dispute in ancient chronicles. The names of the kings, and\r\nthe names of places have been traced by the disputants to Gothic,\r\nGaelic and Cymric roots. As an amusing specimen of the ingenuity\r\ndisplayed in this hunt after roots, we give below a small table from\r\nBurton, comparing the different etymologies of names of kings given\r\nby Pinkerton, Chalmers, and Jamieson.[66]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, generally admitted at the present day, that so far\r\nas language is concerned, the Gothic theory has not the remotest\r\nchance; that names of places and of kings are most satisfactorily\r\nand straightforwardly explained by Cymric roots. As the Gothic or\r\nTeutonic theory cannot stand the test of modern criticism, we shall\r\ncontent ourselves with giving specimens of the manner in which the\r\nlinguistic, or, more strictly, topographical argument is used by the\r\nadvocates of the Cymric and Gaelic hypotheses respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Cymric argument is clearly, ably, and succinctly stated by Mr.\r\nGarnett in his essay on “The Relation of the Pict and Gael;” he,\r\nhowever, it must be remembered, looked at the whole question mainly\r\nin its philological aspect. In stating the argument we shall use\r\nchiefly his own words.[67] “That the Picts were actually Celts,\r\nand not of Teutonic race, is proved to a demonstration by the names\r\nof their kings; of whom a list, undoubtedly genuine from the fifth\r\ncentury downwards, was published by Innes, from a manuscript in the\r\nColbertine library. Some of those appellations are, as far as we\r\nknow at present, confined to the Pictish sovereigns; but others are\r\nwell-known Welsh and Gaelic names. They differ, however, slightly in\r\ntheir forms, from their Cymric equivalents; and more decidedly so\r\nfrom the Gaelic ones; and, as far as they go, lead to the supposition\r\nthat those who bore them spoke a language bearing a remote analogy to\r\nthe Irish with its cognates, but a pretty close one to the Welsh.\r\n\r\n“In the list furnished by Innes the names _Maelcon_, _Elpin_, _Taran_\r\n(i.e. thunder), _Uven_ (Owen), _Bargoit_, are those of personages\r\nwell known in British history or tradition. _Wrgust_, which appears\r\nas Fergus in the Irish annals, is the Welsh _Gwrgust_. _Talorg_,\r\n_Talorgan_, evidently contain the British word _Tal_, forehead, a\r\ncommon element in proper names; ex. gr. _Talhaiarn_, Iron Forehead;\r\n_Taliesin_, splendid forehead, &c. _Taleurgain_ would signify in\r\nWelsh golden or splendid front. Three kings are represented as\r\nsons of _Wid_, in the Irish annals of _Foit_ or _Foith_. In Welsh\r\northography it would be _Gwydd_, wild; a common name in Brittany\r\nat the present day, under the form of _Gwez_. The names _Drust_,\r\n_Drostan_, _Wrad_, _Necton_ (in Bede _Naitan_), closely resemble\r\nthe Welsh _Trwst_, _Trwstan_, _Gwriad_, _Nwython_. It will be\r\nsufficient to compare the entire list with the Irish or Highland\r\ngenealogies, to be convinced that there must have been a material\r\ndistinction between the two branches. Most of the Pictish names\r\nare totally unknown in Irish or Highland history, and the few that\r\nare equivalent, such as Angus and Fergus, generally differ in form.\r\nThe Irish annalists have rather obscured the matter, by transforming\r\nthose names according to their national system of orthography; but it\r\nis remarkable that a list in the ‘Book of Ballymote,’ partly given by\r\nLynch in his ‘Cambrensis Eversus,’ agrees closely with Innes, even\r\npreserving the initial _w_ or _u_ where the Gaelic would require _f_.\r\nThe philological inferences to be deduced from this document may be\r\nthus briefly summed up:--1. The names of the Pictish kings are not\r\nGaelic, the majority of them being totally unknown both in the Irish\r\nand Highland dialects, while the few which have Gaelic equivalents\r\ndecidedly differ from them in form. Cineod (Kenneth) and Domhnall or\r\nDonnel, appear to be the only exceptions. 2. Some of them cannot be\r\nidentified as Welsh; but the greater number are either identical with\r\nor resemble known Cymric names; or approach more nearly to Welsh in\r\nstructure and orthography than to any other known language. 3. There\r\nappears nevertheless to have been a distinction, amounting, at all\r\nevents, to a difference in dialect. The Pictish names beginning with\r\n_w_ would in Welsh have _gw_, as _Gwrgust_ for _Wrgust_, and so of\r\nthe rest. There may have been other differences sufficient to justify\r\nBede’s statement that the Pictish language was distinct from the\r\nBritish, which it might very well be without any impeachment of its\r\nclaim to be reckoned as closely cognate.”\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the use made of the Pictish word\r\n_Peannfahel_, preserved by Bede, and to the phrase in Adamnan\r\nconcerning Columba’s preaching by means of an interpreter. It is\r\ncontended by the upholders of the Cymric theory that the ancient\r\ntopographical appellations of the Pictish territory can in general\r\nonly be explained by the Cymric dialects, one strong point being\r\nthe number of local names beginning with the Welsh prefix _aber_,\r\nwhich, according to Chalmers, was in several instances subsequently\r\nchanged by the Gael into _inver_. Skene,[68] who felt the force of\r\nthis argument, tried to get rid of it by contending that _aber_\r\nis essentially a Gaelic word, being compounded of _ath_, ford, and\r\n_bior_, water. Garnett thinks this explanation utterly gratuitous,\r\nand observes that the term may be much more satisfactorily accounted\r\nfor by a different process. “There are,” he observes,[69] “three\r\nwords in Welsh denoting a meeting of waters--_aber_, _cynver_, and\r\n_ynver_,--respectively compounded of the particles _a_, denoting\r\njuxtaposition, _cyn_ (Lat. _con_), and _yn_, with the root _ber_,\r\nflowing, preserved in the Breton verb _beri_, to flow, and all\r\nvirtually equivalent to our word _confluence_. _Inver_ is the only\r\nterm known in any Gaelic dialect, either as an appellative or in\r\nproper names; and not a single local appellation with the prefix\r\naber occurs either in Ireland or the Hebrides, or on the west coast\r\nof Scotland. Indeed, the fact that _inver_ was substituted for it\r\nafter the Gaelic occupation of the Pictish territories, is decisive\r\nevidence on the point; for, if _aber_ was a term familiar to the\r\nGael, why should they change it?”\r\n\r\n“In Scotland,” says Isaac Taylor,[70] who upholds the Cymric\r\nhypothesis, “the _invers_ and _abers_ are distributed in a curious\r\nand instructive manner. If we draw a line across the map from a point\r\na little south of Inverary, to one a little north of Aberdeen, we\r\nshall find that (with very few exceptions) the _invers_ lie to the\r\nnorth west of the line, and the _abers_ to the south-east of it. This\r\nline nearly coincides with the present southern limit of the Gaelic\r\ntongue, and probably also with the ancient division between the Picts\r\nand Scots. Hence we may conclude that the Picts, a people belonging\r\nto the Cymric branch of the Celtic stock, and whose language has now\r\nceased to be anywhere vernacular, occupied the central and eastern\r\ndistricts of Scotland, as far as the Grampians; while the Gadhelic\r\nScots have retained their language, and have given their name to the\r\nwhole country. The local names prove, moreover, that in Scotland the\r\nCymry did not encroach on the Gael, but the Gael on the Cymry. The\r\nintrusive names are _invers_, which invaded the land of the _abers_.\r\nThus on the shore of the Frith of Forth we find a few _invers_ among\r\nthe _abers_. The Welsh word _uchel_, high, may also be adduced to\r\nprove the Cymric affinities of the Picts. This word does not exist\r\nin either the Erse or the Gaelic languages, and yet it appears in\r\nthe name of the OCHIL HILLS, in Perthshire. Again, the Erse _bally_,\r\na town, occurs in 2,000 names in Ireland; and, on the other hand,\r\nis entirely absent in Wales and Brittany. In Scotland this most\r\ncharacteristic test-word is found frequently in the _inver_ district,\r\nwhile it never appears among the _abers_. The evidence of these names\r\nmakes it impossible to deny that the Celts of the Scottish Lowlands\r\nmust have belonged to the Cymric branch of the Celtic stock.”\r\n\r\nWe infer from what Mr. Taylor says, that he is of opinion that at one\r\ntime the language of the whole of the north of Scotland was Cymric,\r\nbut that the district in which the Scots obtained a settlement\r\nafterwards underwent a change of topography. But it is admitted\r\non all hands that the Scottish Dalriada comprehended no more than\r\nthe modern Argyllshire, extending no farther north than Loch Leven\r\nand Loch Linnhe; and that the Irish Scots had little influence on\r\nthe people or their language to the north-west of the Grampians.\r\nIndeed, Skene[71] maintains that this district, in which he places\r\nthe Northern Picts, was never subjected to the Scots, and that it\r\nwas only the Southern Picts who latterly came under their sway. Yet\r\nwe find that the _abers_ here are few and far between, or, indeed,\r\nany indications of Cymric possession such as we find in the southern\r\ndistrict. Is it possible that the Northern and Southern Picts were\r\nrepresentatives of the two great divisions of the Celts,--the former\r\nclaiming a Gaelic origin, and the latter a Cymric? Perhaps after\r\nall the Welsh Triads may in course of time be of some help in the\r\nsolution of this dark problem, as, according to them, there was more\r\nthan one Celtic settlement in Scotland before the migration of the\r\nScots. The passages above quoted are, to all appearance, much more\r\nfavourable to the Gaelic than to the Cymric hypothesis, and have\r\nbeen made much of by Skene and other supporters of that side of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe Cymric origin of the Picts, besides Garnett and Taylor, is\r\nsupported by such names as Innes, Chalmers, Ritson, Whittaker, Grub,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nPinkerton, it is well known, is the great and unscrupulous upholder\r\nof the Gothic origin of the Picts; while the Gaelic theory has for\r\nits supporters such writers, of undoubted ability and acuteness, as\r\nSkene, E. W. Robertson, Forbes-Leslie, &c. Burton[72] is of opinion\r\nthat the Highlanders of the present day are the true representatives\r\nof the Dalriadic Scots of the West.\r\n\r\nWe shall, as we have done in the case of the other side, allow the\r\nupholders of the Gaelic hypothesis to state for themselves the\r\nGaelic topographical argument. We shall use the words of Colonel\r\nForbes-Leslie, who, in his invaluable work on the “Early Races of\r\nScotland,”[73] says, “The Celtic words Inver and Aber have nearly\r\nthe same meaning; and the relative position in which they occur in\r\nnames of places has been employed as if it were a sufficient argument\r\nfor defining the presence or preponderance of the British or Gaelic\r\nCelts in certain districts. In this way Aber, prefixed to names of\r\nplaces, has been urged as adequate proof that the Picts of Caledonia\r\nwere Celts of the British branch. The value of these and some other\r\nwords requires examination. Inver is to be found in names of places\r\nin Wales. It may possibly be a British word. It certainly is a Gaelic\r\none. Aber, although undoubtedly British, is also Gaelic--compounded\r\nof the two words Ath and Bior--and signifying the same as Inver,\r\nviz., the confluence of two streams, or the entrance to a river. If\r\nthe word Aber had been unknown to the Gaelic scholars of modern days,\r\nits former existence in that language might have been presumed from\r\nthe ancient names of places in the districts of Caledonia, where it\r\noccurs most frequently, being generally Gaelic and not British.\r\n\r\n“Beyond the limits of Caledonia on the south of the Forth and\r\nClyde, but within the boundary of modern Scotland, the word Inver,\r\ngenerally pronounced Inner, is of common occurrence, and bears\r\nwitness to a Gaelic nomenclature. Thus, Inner or Inverkip, in the\r\ncounty of Renfrew; Innerwell, in the county of Wigton; Innerwick,\r\nin the county of Haddington; Innerleithen, in the county of Peebles;\r\nInverleith and Inveresk, in the county of Edinburgh, derive their\r\nnames from their situation in regard to the rivers Kip, Leithen, Esk,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n“From the Moray Frith to the Forth, in the eastern counties of\r\nCaledonia, the prefix Inver or Aber is used indiscriminately in\r\ncontiguous places. At the confluence of lesser streams with the river\r\nDee, in Aberdeenshire, we find Inverey, Abergeldie, Invercauld,\r\nInvercanny, Aberdeen. Yet in those counties--viz., Aberdeen,\r\nKincardine, Forfar, Perth, and Fife, in which were situated the\r\ncapitals, and which were the richest provinces of the southern\r\nPicts--the number of names of places beginning with Inver is three\r\ntimes as numerous as those commencing with Aber; there being, in a\r\nlist taken from land-registers, which do not go farther back than\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, seventy-eight with Inver to\r\ntwenty-four with Aber. It may, however, be admitted that, although\r\nAber is Gaelic, its use is far more general by Celts of the British\r\ntribes; and that the predominance of Inver in the districts north of\r\nthe Spey, and the intermixture of places the names of which commence\r\nwith Inver or Aber, not unfrequently used in records of nearly the\r\nsame date for the same place in the country lying between the Moray\r\nand the Solway Friths, is, to a certain extent, evidence of a British\r\nelement of population extending into Caledonia. The Britons, in\r\nearlier times, may have been pressing on to the north by gradual\r\nintrusion, and were probably afterwards increased by bodies of exiles\r\nescaping from the severity of Roman bondage and the punishment of\r\nunsuccessful revolt.\r\n\r\n“That names of places containing the words Bal, from Bail, a place\r\nor residence, and Ard, a height or rising ground, are so common in\r\nIreland, and comparatively rare, so it is alleged, in Caledonia,\r\nhas also been used as an argument to prove that the language of the\r\nPicts and other Caledonians of the southern and eastern districts\r\nwas British, not Gaelic. But the foundation of the argument has been\r\nassumed, and is easily disproved. It is true that of large towns and\r\nplaces that appear in gazeteers, names commencing with Bal and Ard\r\nare not numerous. But in fact such names are extremely common. In the\r\nlowlands of Aberdeenshire--that is, in the portion of one county, and\r\nin the part of Caledonia farthest removed from the settlements of\r\nthe intrusive Gaels, viz., the Scots from Ireland--registers of land\r\nshow upwards of fifty places the names of which commence with Bal,\r\nand forty which commence with Ard. In the Pictish territory, from the\r\nMoray Frith to the Forth, I soon collected upwards of four hundred\r\nnames of places beginning with Bal, and upwards of one hundred with\r\nArd; and the number might easily be doubled.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. W. Robertson, one of the latest and ablest upholders of this\r\ntheory, thinks[74] there is scarcely sufficient evidence to justify\r\nany very decided conclusion as to the pre-existence of a Cymric\r\npopulation; and that, whilst it would be unquestionably erroneous\r\nto ascribe a Cymric origin to the Picts, the existence of a Celtic\r\nelement akin to the Cymri, amongst the population of Alban before the\r\narrival of the _Gwyddel Ffichti_, must remain to a certain extent an\r\nopen question.\r\n\r\nOf all _a priori_ theories that have hitherto been advanced as to how\r\nScotland was likely to have been at first peopled, that of Father\r\nInnes, the first writer who investigated the subject thoroughly and\r\ncritically, appears to us to be the most plausible and natural,\r\nalthough even it is beset with many difficulties. It appears to him\r\nmore natural and probable that the Caledonian Britons, or Picts, were\r\nof the same origin as the Britons of the south; that as these came in\r\noriginally from the nearest coast of Gaul, as they multiplied in the\r\nisland, they advanced to the north and settled there, carrying with\r\nthem the customs and language of the South Britons.[75]\r\n\r\nWe have thus endeavoured to lay before the reader, as fully as\r\nspace permits, and as clearly and unprejudicedly as possible, the\r\nmaterials at present existing by means of which to form an opinion on\r\nthe Pictish question, and the arguments _pro_ and _con_, mainly in\r\ntheir own words, urged by the partisans of the different theories.\r\nIt appears to us that the data within reach are far too scanty to\r\njustify any one in coming to a settled conclusion, and that we must\r\nwait for more light before we can be justified in finally making up\r\nour minds on this perplexing subject.[76]\r\n\r\nAt the present day we find that nearly the whole of the territory\r\nsaid to have been originally occupied by the Picts, is inhabited,\r\nand has been for centuries, by a population which in appearance is\r\nfar more Teutonic than Celtic, and which undoubtedly speaks a broad\r\nTeutonic dialect.[77] And even in the district where the Gaelic\r\nlanguage has been triumphant for ages, it is acknowledged even by\r\nthe most devoted partisans of the Gaelic theory, that among the\r\npopulation there is a very considerable intermixture of the Teutonic\r\nelement. Burton thinks, from a general view of the whole question,\r\nthat the proportion of the Teutonic race that came into the use of\r\nthe Gaelic, was much greater than the proportion of the Gaelic that\r\ncame into the use of the Teutonic or Saxon, and that this may account\r\nfor the contrasts of physical appearance to be seen in the Highlands.\r\n\r\nWe certainly have not exhausted the statement of the question, have\r\nnot stated fully and completely all the points in dispute; nor do\r\nwe pretend to have given with fulness all the arguments _pro_ and\r\n_con_ on the various sides. We have, however, given as much as\r\nwill enable any ordinary reader to form for himself a fair idea\r\nof the present state of the Pictish question, and indicated the\r\nsources whence more information may be derived, should any one\r\nwish to pursue the subject farther. In the words of the latest and\r\ngreatest Scottish historian “this brief survey of the great Pictish\r\ncontroversy leaves nothing but a melancholy record of wasted labour\r\nand defeated ambition. It has been more fruitless than a polemical or\r\na political dispute, for these leave behind them, either for good or\r\nevil, their marks upon the conduct and character of the populations\r\namong whom they have raged; while here a vast outlay of learning,\r\ningenuity, enthusiasm, and, it must be added, temper, have left no\r\nvisible monument but a pile of forbidding volumes, in which should\r\nany one who has not studied the matter fundamentally expect to find\r\ninstructive information, he will assuredly be led into a tangled\r\nmaze of unintelligible pedantry, from which he will come forth with\r\nno impression but a nightmare feeling of hopeless struggle with\r\ndifficulties.”[78]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Garnett’s _Philological Essays_, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[25] Agricola xi.\r\n\r\n[26] The wall of Antonine.\r\n\r\n[27] Dio L. 76, c. 12, as quoted in Ritson’s _Annals_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[28] Critical Essay, ch. ii.\r\n\r\n[29] _Highlanders._\r\n\r\n[30] Book iii.\r\n\r\n[31] “Scotti per diversa vagantes, multa populabantur.” Am.

Since much\r\nof the first part of this book was written, Mr. Skene has advanced\r\nthe theory, founded partly on four new Pictish words he has managed\r\nto discover, that the language of the Picts was neither pure Gaelic\r\nnor Cymric, ‘but a sort of low Gaelic dialect partaking largely of\r\nWelsh forms.’ This theory is not new, but was distinctly put forth\r\nby Dr. Maclauchlan some years ago in his able and learned work, _The\r\nEarly Scottish Church_, p. 29: if true, it would certainly satisfy a\r\ngreat many of the demands which any hypothesis on the subject must do.\r\n\r\n[48] Bede’s _Eccles.

Speaking of the distribution of the\r\ntopographical nomenclature in the Highlands, Dr. Maclauchlan says it\r\nindicates one of two things; “either that the one race overpowered\r\nthe other in the east, and superinduced a new nomenclature over the\r\nold throughout the country,--that we have in fact two successive\r\nstrata of Celtic names, the Gaelic underlying the British, which\r\nis by no means impossible; or, what is more likely, that the\r\nPictish people were a people lying midway between the Gael and the\r\nCymri--more Gaelic than the Cymri, and more Cymric than the Gael.\r\nThis is precisely the character of the old Pictish topography; it is\r\na mixture of Gaelic and Cymric; and if the language of the people\r\nwas like their topography, it too was a language neither Gaelic\r\nnor Cymric, but occupying a middle space between them, indicating\r\nthe identity of the races at some distant period, although they\r\nafterwards became rivals for the possession of the land.” This we\r\nthink on the whole the most satisfactory theory yet propounded.\r\n\r\n[77] We would infer from the recently published _Book of Deer_, that\r\ndown at least to the time of David II., the inhabitants were still a\r\nGaelic speaking population; all the entries in that book as to land\r\nare in that language.\r\n\r\n[78] Burton, vol. i. p. 200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA.D. 446-843.\r\n\r\n  Early History--Scottish Settlement--Origin of\r\n  Scots--Dalriada--Conversion of Picts--Druidism--St.\r\n  Columba--Iona--Spread of Christianity--Brude\r\n  and his Successors--Dun-Nechtan--Pictish\r\n  Wars--Ungus--Contests--Norsemen--Union of Picts and\r\n  Scots--Scoto-Irish or Dalriads--Lorn, Fergus, Angus and their\r\n  Successors--Aidan--Contest at Degsastan--Donal Breac--Wars\r\n  with Irish and Picts--Conal II. and Successors--Ferchar\r\n  Fada--Selvach and Duncha Beg--Eocha III. unites\r\n  Dalriada--Muredach--Contests with Picts--Aodh-fin--Eocha IV. or\r\n  Achaius--Alpin--Kenneth--Union of Picts and Scots--Dalriadic\r\n  Government--Tanist--Brehon--Laws--Fosterage--Lists of Kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the materials for the internal history of\r\nthe Highlands during the Roman occupation are of the scantiest,\r\nnearly all that can be recorded being the struggles of the northern\r\ntribes with the Roman invaders, and the incursions of the former and\r\ntheir allies into the territories of the Romanized Britons. Doubtless\r\nmany events as worthy of record as these, an account of which has\r\nbeen preserved, were during this period being transacted in the\r\nnorthern part of Scotland, and we have seen that many additions,\r\nfrom various quarters, must have been made to the population.\r\nHowever, there are no records extant which enable us to form any\r\ndistinct notion of the nature of these events, and history cannot be\r\nmanufactured.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Romans, the provincial Britons of the\r\nsouth of Scotland were completely at the mercy of the Picts as well\r\nas the Saxons, who had been invited over by the South Britons to\r\nassist them against the northern barbarians. These Saxons, we know,\r\nvery soon entered into alliance with those whom they came to repel,\r\nand between them the Britons south of the friths were eventually\r\ndriven into the West, where for centuries they appear to have\r\nmaintained an independent kingdom under the name of Strathclyde,\r\nuntil ultimately they were incorporated with the Scots.[79]\r\n\r\nAlthough both the external and internal history of the Highlands\r\nduring this period is much better known than in the case of the\r\nRoman period, still the materials are exceedingly scanty. Scottish\r\nhistorians, from Fordun and Boece downwards, made it their business\r\nto fill up from their own imaginations what is wanting, so that,\r\nuntil the simple-minded but acute Innes put it in its true light, the\r\nearly history of Scotland was a mass of fable.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the two most momentous events of this period are the firm\r\nsettlement in Argyle of a colony of Scots from Ireland and some of\r\nthe neighbouring isles in 503,[80] and the conversion of the Northern\r\nPicts to Christianity by Columba about 563.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Roman abandonment of Britain the Picts were under\r\nthe sway of a king or chieftain named Drust, son of Erp, concerning\r\nwhom the only record remaining is, that he lived a hundred years and\r\nfought a hundred battles. In fact, little is known with certainty\r\nof the Pictish history for upwards of one hundred years after the\r\ndeparture of the Romans, although some ancient chronicles afford us\r\nlists of Pictish kings or princes, a chronological table of whom,\r\nfrom Drust downwards, will be found at the end of this chapter. The\r\nPictish chronicle contains the names of thirty-six others who are\r\nsaid to have reigned before Drust, but these are generally regarded\r\nas almost entirely spurious.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther with the Pictish history, it may be proper\r\nto give a brief account of the settlement of the Irish Scots or\r\nDalriads, as they are frequently called, in the Pictish territory.\r\n\r\nThe time of the settlement of the Scots in present Scotland was for\r\nlong a subject of disputation, the early Scottish historians, from\r\na false and unscrupulous patriotism, having pushed it back for many\r\ncenturies before its actual occurrence. This dispute is now, however,\r\nfairly set at rest, there being no foundation for believing that the\r\nScots found their way from Ireland to Scotland earlier than a century\r\nor two before the birth of Christ. As we have already seen, we find\r\nthe first mention of the Scots in Ammianus Marcellinus about the year\r\n360 A.D.; and their name occurs in the same connection frequently\r\nafterwards, during the Roman occupation of Scotland. Burton[81] is of\r\nopinion that the migration did not take place at any particular time\r\nor under any particular leader, but that it was gradual, that the\r\nScots “oozed” out of Ireland upon the western coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the history of Ireland to trace the origin and fix the\r\nrace of the Scots, to settle the time of their coming into Ireland,\r\nand discover whence they came. Some suppose that they migrated\r\noriginally from Britain to Ireland, while Innes and others bring them\r\neither from Scandinavia or Spain, and connect them with the Scyths,\r\nasserting that Scot is a mere corruption of Scyth, and dating the\r\nsettlement at about the commencement of the Christian era. The Irish\r\ntraditions connect them with a certain Scota, daughter of Pharaoh,\r\nand date their coming to Ireland upwards of 1,000 years B.C. E. W.\r\nRobertson[82] and others consider them to have been Irish Picts or\r\nCruithne.\r\n\r\nWherever the Scots came from and to whatever race they belong,\r\nwhether Teutonic or Celtic, they certainly appear not to have\r\nbeen the first settlers in Ireland, and at the time at which they\r\nfirst appear in authentic history occupied a district in Ireland\r\ncorresponding to Connaught, Leinster, and part of Munster. They were\r\nalso one of the most powerful of the Irish tribes, seeing that for\r\nmany centuries Ireland was, after them, called Scotia or Scotland.\r\nIt is usually said that a particular corner in the north-east of\r\nIreland, about 30 miles in extent, corresponding to the modern\r\ncounty of Antrim, was the kingdom of the particular band of Scots\r\nwho migrated to Scotland; and that it received its name, Dal-Riada\r\n(‘the portion of Riada’), from Carbre-Riada, a leader of the Scots\r\nwho conquered this particular part, previously inhabited by Cruithne\r\nor Irish Picts. Robertson,[83] however, considers all this fable\r\nand the kingdom of Dalriada as mythical, Tighernach and the early\r\nIrish annalists never applying the name to any other locality than\r\nBritish Dalriada. At all events, this particular district was spoken\r\nof by the later chroniclers under the name of Dalriada, there being\r\nthus a Dalriada both in Scotland and Ireland.[84] At the time of the\r\nmigration of the Scots from Ireland to Scotland, they were to all\r\nintents and purposes a Celtic race, speaking Trish Gaelic, and had\r\nalready been converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Scottish migration usually given is, that in the\r\nyear 503 A.D.,[85] a new colony of Dalriads or Dalriadic Scots, under\r\nthe leadership of Fergus son of Erc, a descendant of Carbre-Riada,\r\nalong with his brothers Lorn and Angus, left Ireland and settled\r\non the western coast of Argyle and the adjacent islands. “The\r\nterritories which constituted the petty kingdoms of Dalriada can be\r\npretty well defined. They were bounded on the south by the Frith of\r\nClyde, and they were separated on the east from the Pictish kingdom\r\nby the ridge of the great mountain chain called Drumalban. They\r\nconsisted of four tribes,--the genus or Cinel Lorn, descended from\r\nLorn, the elder of the three brothers; the Cinel Gabran and Cinel\r\nComgall, descended from two sons of Domangart, son of Fergus, the\r\nsecond of the brothers; and the Cinel Angus, descended from the third\r\nbrother, Angus. The Cinel Comgall inhabited the district formerly\r\ncalled Comgall, now corrupted into Cowall. The Cinel Gabran inhabited\r\nwhat was called the Airgiallas, or the district of Argyle proper, and\r\nKintyre. The Cinel Angus inhabited the islands of Islay and Jura, and\r\nthe Cinel Lorn, the district of Lorn. Beyond this, on the north, the\r\ndistricts between Lorn and the promontory of Ardnamurchan, _i.e._,\r\nthe island of Mull, the district of Morven, Ardgower, and probably\r\npart of Lochaber, seem to have formed a sort of debatable ground,\r\nthe population of which was Pictish, while the Scots had settlements\r\namong them. In the centre of the possessions of the Cinel Gabran, at\r\nthe head of the well-sheltered loch of Crinan, lies the great Moss\r\nof Crinan, with the river Add flowing through it. In the centre of\r\nthe moss, and on the side of the river, rises an isolated rocky hill\r\ncalled Dunadd, the top of which is strongly fortified. This was the\r\ncapital of Dalriada, and many a stone obelisk in the moss around it\r\nbears silent testimony to the contests of which it was the centre.\r\nThe picturesque position of Dunolly Castle, on a rock at the entrance\r\nof the equally sheltered bay of Oban, afforded another fortified\r\nsummit, which was the chief stronghold of the tribe of Lorn. Of\r\nDunstaffnage, as a royal seat, history knows nothing.”[86]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Lorn and Fergus at first reigned jointly, the\r\nlatter becoming sole monarch on the decease of the former. The\r\nsuccession appears not to have been confined to any particular line,\r\nand a disputed succession not unfrequently involved the Scots in\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of history so obscure or so perplexing as that of\r\nthe Scoto-Irish kings, and their tribes, from their first settlement,\r\nin the year 503, to their accession to the Pictish throne in 843.\r\nUnfortunately no contemporaneous written records appear ever to have\r\nexisted of that dark period of our annals, and the efforts which the\r\nScotch and Irish antiquaries have made to extricate the truth from\r\nthe mass of contradictions in which it lies buried, have rather been\r\ndisplays of national prejudice than calm researches by reasonable\r\ninquirers. The annals, however, of Tigernach, and of Ulster, along\r\nwith the brief chronicles and historical documents first brought to\r\nlight by the industrious Innes, in his Critical Essay, have thrown\r\nsome glimpses of light on a subject which had long remained in almost\r\ntotal darkness.[87]\r\n\r\nThe next authentic event of importance that falls to be recorded in\r\nconnection with the history of the Highlands, is the conversion of\r\nthe Northern Picts to Christianity, about the year 563. The Southern\r\nPicts, i.e. those living to the south and east of the Grampians,\r\nwere converted by St. Ninian (360-432) about the beginning of the\r\n5th century; but the Northern Picts, until the date above-mentioned,\r\ncontinued Pagans. That there were no Christians among them till that\r\ntime appears very improbable, considering their close neighbourhood\r\nand constant intercourse with the Southern Picts and the Scots of\r\nDalriada; but there can be no doubt that the court and the great bulk\r\nof the people adhered to their ancient superstitions.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Picts before their conversion is supposed by the\r\nmajority of writers on this subject to have been that which prevailed\r\nin the rest of Britain and in Celtic Gaul, Druidism. The incredulous\r\nBurton, however, if we may judge from his History of Scotland,[88]\r\nas well as from an article of his in the Edinburgh Review, seems to\r\nbelieve that the whole system of Druidism has been elaborated by the\r\nimaginations of modern historians. That the Picts previous to their\r\nconversion had a religion, and a religion with what may be called\r\npriests and religious services, cannot be doubted, if we may trust\r\nTacitus and Adamnan, the biographer of Columba; the former of whom\r\ntells us that, previous to the battle of the Grampians, the union\r\nof the various tribes was ratified by solemn rites and sacrifices,\r\nand the latter, that Columba’s efforts at conversion were strenuously\r\nopposed by the diabolical arts and incantations of the Magi. It\r\nappears from Adamnan that fountains were particularly objects of\r\nveneration; the superstitious awe with which many fountains and\r\nwells are regarded at the present day, being doubtless a remnant of\r\nthe ancient Pictish religion. Trees, rivers, and lakes, as well as\r\nthe heavenly bodies, appear also to have been objects of religious\r\nregard, and not a few of the customs which exist in Scotland at the\r\npresent day have been inherited from our Pictish ancestors. Such\r\nare many of the rites performed on Hallowe’en, Beltane, Midsummer,\r\n&c., and many every-day superstitions still prevalent in the country\r\ndistricts of Scotland.\r\n\r\n“Druidism is said to have acknowledged a Supreme Being, whose\r\nname was synonymous with the Eastern Baal, and if so, was visibly\r\nrepresented by the sun; and such remnants of the ancient worship as\r\nare still traceable in the language of the people, would indicate\r\nits having been a species of sun-worship. To this day the four\r\nleading points of the compass bear, in the terms which designate them\r\namong the Gael, marks of this. The east is _ear_, like the Latin\r\n_oriens_, from the Gaelic _eiridh_, ‘to rise;’ the west is _iar_,\r\n‘after,’ used also as a preposition; the south is _deas_, and the\r\nnorth _tuath_; and it is in the use of these terms that the reverence\r\nfor the solar luminary chiefly appears. _Deas_, ‘the south,’ is in\r\nall circumstances _right_; it is the _right_ hand, which is easily\r\nintelligible, from the relation of that hand to the south when the\r\nface looks eastward; and it is expressive of whatever is otherwise\r\n_right_. _Deas_ also means complete, trim, ready; whatever is\r\n_deas_, or southerly, is just as it should be. _Tuath_, ‘north,’\r\nis the very opposite. _Tuathaisd_ is a ‘stupid fellow;’ _Tuathail_\r\nis ‘wrong’ in every sense: south and north, then, as expressed in\r\nthe words _deiseal_ and _tuathail_, are, in the Gaelic language,\r\nthe representatives of right and wrong. Thus everything that is to\r\nmove prosperously among many of the Celts, must move sunwise: a boat\r\ngoing to sea must turn sunwise; a man or woman immediately after\r\nmarriage, must make a turn sunwise. There are relics of fire-worship\r\ntoo; certain days are named from fire-lighting; _Beallteine_, or\r\n‘the first day of summer,’ and _saimhtheine_, ‘the first day of\r\nwinter,’--the former supposed to mean the fire of Baal or Bel,\r\nthe latter closing the saimhré, or summer period of the year, and\r\nbringing in the geamhré, or winter period, are sufficient evidence of\r\nthis. There are places in Scotland where within the memory of living\r\nmen the _teine eigin_, or ‘forced fire,’ was lighted once every year\r\nby the rubbing of two pieces of wood together, while every fire\r\nin the neighbourhood was extinguished in order that they might be\r\nlighted anew from this sacred source.”[89]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stonehenge.--Copied by permission from Col.\r\nForbes-Leslie’s _Early Races of Scotland_.]\r\n\r\nMany of the antiquities which are scattered over the north of\r\nScotland, such as stone circles, monoliths, sculptured stones,\r\nrocking stones, &c., are very generally supposed to have been\r\nconnected with religion. From the resemblance of the circles\r\nespecially, to those which exist in South Britain and in France, it\r\nhas been supposed that one religion prevailed over these countries.\r\nAs Druidism is so commonly believed to have prevailed among the\r\nPicts as well as among the other inhabitants of Britain, we shall\r\nhere give a very brief account of that system, chiefly as we find it\r\ngiven in Cæsar.[90] The following is the account given by Cæsar of\r\nthe character and functions of the Druids:--“They attend to divine\r\nworship, perform public and private sacrifices, and expound matters\r\nof religion. A great number of youths are gathered round them for\r\nthe sake of education, and they enjoy the highest honour in that\r\nnation; for nearly all public and private quarrels come under their\r\njurisdiction; and when any crime has been committed, when a murder\r\nhas been perpetrated, when a controversy arises about a legacy,\r\nor about landmarks, they are the judges too. They fix rewards and\r\npunishments; and should any one, whether a private individual or a\r\npublic man, disobey their decrees, then they exclude him from the\r\nsacrifices. All these Druids have one chief, who enjoys the highest\r\nauthority amongst them. When he dies, he is succeeded by the member\r\nof the order who is most prominent amongst the others, if there\r\nbe any such single individual; if, however, there are several men\r\nequally distinguished, the successor is elected by the Druids.\r\nSometimes they even go to war about this supremacy.\r\n\r\n“The Druids take no part in warfare; nor do they pay taxes like\r\nthe rest of the people; they are exempt from military service, and\r\nfrom all public burdens. Attracted by such rewards, many come to\r\nbe instructed by their own choice, while others are sent by their\r\nparents. They are reported to learn in the school a great number\r\nof verses, so that some remain there twenty years. They think it\r\nan unhallowed thing to commit their lore to writing, though in the\r\nother public and private affairs of life they frequently make use\r\nof the Greek alphabet.... Beyond all things, they are desirous to\r\ninspire a belief that men’s souls do not perish, but transmigrate\r\nafter death from one individual to another; and besides, they hold\r\ndiscourses about the stars, about the size of the world and of\r\nvarious countries, about the nature of things, and about the power\r\nand might of the immortal gods.”\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of druidical veneration the oak is said to have\r\nbeen particularly distinguished; for the Druids imagined that there\r\nwas a supernatural virtue in the wood, in the leaves, in the fruit,\r\nand above all in the _mistletoe_. Hence the oak woods were the\r\nfirst places of their devotion; and the offices of their religion\r\nwere there performed without any covering but the broad canopy of\r\nheaven. The part appropriated for worship was inclosed in a circle,\r\nwithin which was placed a pillar of stone set up under an oak, and\r\nsacrifices were offered thereon. The pillars which mark the sites of\r\nthese places of worship are still to be seen; and so great is the\r\nsuperstitious veneration paid by the country people to these sacred\r\nstones, as they are considered, that few persons have ventured to\r\nremove them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Circle of Callernish in Lewis.--Copied by permission\r\nfrom Col. Forbes-Leslie’s _Early Races of Scotland_.]\r\n\r\nBesides the immunities before-mentioned enjoyed by the Druids,\r\nthey also possessed both civil and criminal jurisdiction, they\r\ndecided all controversies among states as well as among private\r\npersons; and whoever refused to submit to their awards was exposed\r\nto the most severe penalties. The sentence of excommunication was\r\npronounced against him; he was debarred all intercourse with his\r\nfellow-citizens; his company was universally shunned as profane and\r\ndangerous; he was refused the protection of law; and death itself\r\nbecame an acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he\r\nwas exposed.\r\n\r\nSt. Columba was born in the county of Donegal, in Ireland, in the\r\nyear 521, and was connected both on his father’s and mother’s side\r\nwith the Irish royal family. He was carefully educated for the\r\npriesthood, and, after having finished his ecclesiastical studies,\r\nfounded monasteries in various parts of Ireland. The year of his\r\ndeparture from Ireland is, on good authority, ascertained to have\r\nbeen 563, and it is generally said that he fled to save his life,\r\nwhich was in jeopardy on account of a feud in which his relations\r\nwere involved. Mr. Grub[91] believes that “the love of God and of\r\nhis brethren was to him a sufficient motive for entering on the\r\ngreat work to which he was called. His immediate objects were the\r\ninstruction of the subjects of Conal, king of the British Scots, and\r\nthe conversion of their neighbours the heathen Picts of the North.”\r\nIn the year 563, when Columba was 42 years of age, he arrived among\r\nhis kindred on the shores of Argyle, and immediately set himself\r\nto fix on a suitable site for a monastery which he meant to erect,\r\nfrom which were to issue forth the apostolic missionaries destined\r\nto assist him in the work of conversion, and in which also the youth\r\nset apart for the office of the holy ministry were to be educated.\r\nSt. Columba espied a solitary isle lying apart from the rest of the\r\nHebridean group, near the south-west angle of Mull, then known by\r\nthe simple name I, whose etymology is doubtful, afterwards changed\r\nby Bede into Hy, latinized by the monks into Iova or Iona, and again\r\nhonoured with the name of I-columb-cil, the island of St. Columba of\r\nthe church. This island, Conal, who was then king of the Christian\r\nScots of Argyle, presented to Columba, in order that he might erect\r\nthereon a monastery for the residence of himself and his disciples.\r\nNo better station could have been selected than this islet during\r\nsuch barbarous times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins on Iona.]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his plan, St. Columba settled with twelve disciples\r\nin Hy. “They now,” says Bede, “neither sought, nor loved, anything\r\nof this world,”--true traits in the missionary character. For two\r\nyears did they labour with their own hands erecting huts and building\r\na church of logs and reeds. “The monastery of Iona, like those\r\npreviously founded by Columba in Ireland, was not a retreat for\r\nsolitaries whose chief object was to work out their own salvation;\r\nit was a great school of Christian education, and was specially\r\ndesigned to prepare and send forth a body of clergy trained to\r\nthe task of preaching the Gospel among the heathen.”[92] Having\r\nestablished his missionary institution, and having occupied himself\r\nfor some time in the instruction of his countrymen the Scots of\r\nArgyle, the pious Columba set out on his apostolic tour among the\r\nPicts, probably in the year 565. At this time Bridei or Brude, whose\r\nreign extended from 536 to 586, the son of Mailcon, a powerful and\r\ninfluential prince, reigned over the Northern Picts, and appears also\r\nto have had dominion over those of the south. Judging well that if\r\nhe could succeed in converting Brude, who, when Columba visited him\r\nwas staying at one of his residences on the banks of the Ness, the\r\narduous task he had undertaken of bringing over the whole nation to\r\nthe worship of the true God would be more easily accomplished, he\r\nfirst began with the king, and by great patience and perseverance\r\nsucceeded in converting him.\r\n\r\nThe first Gaelic entry in the _Book of Deer_ lets us see the great\r\nmissionary on one of his tours, and describes the founding of an\r\nimportant mission-station which became the centre of instruction\r\nfor all the surrounding country. The following is the translation\r\ngiven of the Gaelic original:--“Columcille, and Drostán son of\r\nCosgrach, his pupil, came from Hí, as God had shown to them, unto\r\nAbbordoboir, and Bede the Pict was mormaer of Buchan before them,\r\nand it was he that gave them that town in freedom for ever from\r\nmormaer and toisech. They came after that to the other town, and\r\nit was pleasing to Columcille because it was full of God’s grace,\r\nand he asked of the mormaer, to wit Bede, that he should give it to\r\nhim; and he did not give it, and a son of his took an illness after\r\n[or in consequence of] refusing the clerics, and he was nearly dead\r\n[_lit._ he was dead but if it were a little]. After this the mormaer\r\nwent to entreat the clerics that they should make prayer for the son,\r\nthat health should come to him; and he gave in offering to them from\r\nCloch in tiprat to Cloch pette meic Garnait. They made the prayer,\r\nand health came to him. After that Columcille gave to Drostán that\r\ntown, and blessed it, and left as (his) word, ‘Whosoever should come\r\nagainst it, let him not be many-yeared [or] victorious.’ Drostán’s\r\ntears came on parting from Columcille. Said Columcille, ‘Let DÉAR be\r\nits name henceforward.’”\r\n\r\nThe _Abbordoboir_ here spoken of is Aberdour on the north coast of\r\nAberdeenshire, and _Dear_ probably occupied the site of what is now\r\nOld Deer, about twelve miles inland from Aberdour. There is every\r\nreason for believing in the substantial truth of the narrative. The\r\ntwo saints, probably from the banks of the Ness, came to Aberdour\r\nand “tarried there for a time and founded a monastery on the land\r\nwhich had been granted them. In later times the parish church of\r\nAberdour was dedicated to St. Drostan.” One would almost be inclined\r\nto suppose, from the manner in which the missionaries were apparently\r\nreceived, that Christianity had been heard of there before; possibly\r\nBede the Pictish mormaer had been converted at the court of King\r\nBrude, and had invited Columba to pay him a visit in Buchan and plant\r\nthe gospel among the inhabitants. Possibly St. Ninian, the apostle\r\nof the southern Picts, may, during his mission among them, have\r\npenetrated as far north as Buchan. On the side of the choir of the\r\nold parish church of Turriff, a few miles west of Deer, was found\r\npainted the figure of St. Ninian, which was probably as old as the\r\n16th century. At all events, Columba and his companion appear to have\r\nbeen made most welcome in Buchan, and were afforded every facility\r\nfor prosecuting their sacred work. The above record doubtless gives\r\nus a fair notion of Columba’s mode of procedure in prosecuting his\r\nself-imposed task of converting the inhabitants of Alba. As was the\r\ncase in Buchan, he appears to have gone from district to district\r\nalong with his missionary companions, seen the work of conversion\r\nfairly begun, planted a monastery in a suitable place, and left one\r\nor more of his disciples as resident missionaries to pursue the work\r\nof conversion and keep Christianity alive in the district.[93]\r\n\r\nColumba soon had the happiness of seeing the blessings of\r\nChristianity diffusing themselves among a people who had hitherto sat\r\nin the darkness of paganism. Attended by his disciples he traversed\r\nthe whole of the Pictish territories, spreading everywhere the light\r\nof faith by instructing the people in the truths of the Gospel. To\r\nkeep up a succession of the teachers of religion, he established,\r\nas we have seen, monasteries in every district, and from these\r\nissued, for many ages, men of apostolic earnestness, who watered\r\nand tended the good seed planted by Columba, and carried it to the\r\nremotest parts of the north of Scotland and its islands, so that, in\r\na generation or two after Columba, Christianity became the universal\r\nreligion. These monasteries or cells were long subject to the Abbey\r\nof Iona, and the system of church government which proceeded from\r\nthat centre was in many respects peculiar, and has given rise to much\r\ncontroversy between presbyterians and episcopalians.\r\n\r\nSt. Columba died on the 9th of June, 597, after a glorious and\r\nwell-spent life, thirty-four years of which he had devoted to the\r\ninstruction of the nation he had converted. His influence was very\r\ngreat with the neighbouring princes, and they often applied to\r\nhim for advice, and submitted to him their differences, which he\r\nfrequently settled by his authority. His memory was long held in\r\nreverence by the Scots and Caledonians.\r\n\r\nConal, the fifth king of the Scots in Argyle, the kinsman of\r\nSt. Columba, and under whose auspices he entered on the work of\r\nconversion, and to whom it is said he was indebted for Hy, died in\r\n571. His successor Aidan went over to Iona in 574, and was there\r\nordained and inaugurated by the Abbot according to the ceremonial of\r\nthe _liber vitreus_, the cover of which is supposed to have been\r\nencrusted with crystal.\r\n\r\nTo return to the history of the Picts, we have already observed that\r\nlittle is known of Pictish history for more than a hundred years\r\nafter the Roman abdication; and even up to the union of the Picts\r\nand Scots, the materials for the history of both are about as scarce\r\nas they could possibly be, consisting mostly of meagre chronicles\r\ncontaining the names of kings, the dates of their accession and\r\ndeath, and occasionally the names of battles and of the contending\r\nnations. Scotland during this period appears to have been the scene\r\nof unceasing war between the Scots, Picts, Britons of Strathclyde,\r\nEnglish, and Danes, the two first being continually at strife not\r\nonly with each other but among themselves. We shall endeavour to\r\ngive, as clearly and as faithfully as possible, the main reliable\r\nfacts in the history of the Scots and Picts until the union of these\r\ntwo nations.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Brude was distinguished by many warlike exploits, but\r\nabove all, as we have seen, by his conversion and that of his people\r\nto Christianity, which indeed formed his greatest glory. His chief\r\ncontests were with the Scoto-Irish or Dalriads, whom he defeated in\r\n557, and slew Gauran their king. Brude died in 586, and for several\r\nages his successors carried on a petty system of warfare, partly\r\nforeign and partly domestic. Passing over a domestic conflict, at\r\nLindores in 621, under Kenneth, son of Luthrin, we must notice\r\nthe important battle of Dun-Nechtan, fought in 685, between the\r\nPicts under Brude, the son of Bili,[94] and the Saxons, under the\r\nNorthumbrian Egfrid. The Saxon king, it is said, greedy of conquest,\r\nattacked the Picts without provocation, and against the advice of his\r\ncourt. Crossing the Forth from Lothian, he entered Strathearn and\r\npenetrated through the defiles of the Pictish kingdom, leaving fire\r\nand desolation in his train. His career was stopt at Dun-Nechtan, the\r\nhill of Nechtan, a hill in the parish of Dunnichen, about the centre\r\nof Forfarshire; and by a neighbouring lake, long known by the name of\r\nNechtan’s mere, a short distance east from the town of Forfar, did\r\nEgfrid and his Saxons fall before Brude and his exasperated Picts.\r\nThis was a sad blow to the Northumbrian power; yet the Northumbrians,\r\nin 699, under Berht, an able leader, again ventured to try their\r\nstrength with the Picts, when they were once more defeated by Brude,\r\nthe son of Dereli, who had recently mounted the Pictish throne.\r\n\r\nThe wars between the Picts and Northumbrians were succeeded by\r\nvarious contests for power among the Pictish princes, which gave\r\nrise to a civil war. Ungus, honoured by the Irish Annalists with the\r\ntitle of great, and Elpin, at the head of their respective partisans,\r\ntried their strength at Monacrib, supposed by some to be Moncrieff in\r\nStrathearn, in the year 727, when the latter was defeated; and the\r\nconflict was renewed at Duncrei (Crieff), when victory declared a\r\nsecond time against Elpin, who was obliged to flee from the hostility\r\nof Ungus. Nechtan next tried his strength with Ungus, in 728, at a\r\nplace called Monacurna by the Annalists--possibly Moncur in the Carse\r\nof Gowrie--but he was defeated, and many of his followers perished.\r\nTalorgan, the son of Congus, was defeated by Brude, the son of Ungus,\r\nin 730, and in the same year the Picts appear to have entered into a\r\ntreaty of peace with the English nation.\r\n\r\nThe victorious Ungus commenced hostilities against the Dalriads, or\r\nScoto-Irish, in the year 736, and appears to have got the better\r\nof the latter. The Scots were again worsted in another battle\r\nin 740 by Ungus, who in the same year repulsed an attack of the\r\nNorthumbrians under Eadbert. In the year 750 he defeated the Britons\r\nof the Cumbrian kingdom in the battle of Cato or Cath-O, in which\r\nhis brother Talorgan was killed. Ungus, who appears to have been\r\na powerful and able monarch, but whom Bede[95] characterizes as\r\nhaving conducted himself “with bloody wickedness, a tyrant and an\r\nexecutioner,” died about 760. A doubtful victory was gained by\r\nCiniod, or Kenneth, the Pictish king, over Aodh-fin, the Scottish\r\nking, in 767. Constantine, having overcome Conall, the son of Tarla,\r\nin 789, succeeded him in the throne.[96]\r\n\r\nUp to this period the Norsemen from Scandinavia, or the _Vikingr_,\r\n_i.e._ men of the voes or bays, as they were termed, had confined\r\ntheir ravages to the Baltic; but, in the year 787 they for the first\r\ntime appeared on the east coast of England. Some years afterwards\r\nthey found their way to the Caledonian shores, and in 795 made their\r\nfirst attack on Iona, which frequently afterwards, along with the\r\nrest of the Hebrides, suffered grievously from their ravages. In 839\r\nthe _Vikingr_ entered the Pictish territories. A murderous conflict\r\nensued between them and the Picts under Uen their king, in which both\r\nhe and his only brother Bran, as well as many of the Pictish chiefs,\r\nfell. This event, no doubt, hastened the downfall of the Pictish\r\nmonarchy; and as the Picts were unable to resist the arms of Kenneth,\r\nthe Scottish king, he carried into execution, in the year 843, a\r\nproject he had long entertained, of uniting the Scots and Picts,\r\nand placing both crowns on his head. That anything like a total\r\nextermination of the Picts took place is now generally discredited,\r\nalthough doubtless there was great slaughter both of princes and\r\npeople. Skene[97] asserts indeed that it was only the Southern Picts\r\nwho became subject to Kenneth, the Northern Picts remaining for long\r\nafterwards independent of, but sometimes in alliance with, the Scots.\r\nThis is substantially the opinion of Mr. E. W. Robertson,[98] who\r\nsays, “the modern shires of Perth, Fife, Stirling, and Dumbarton,\r\nwith the greater part of the county of Argyle, may be said to have\r\nformed the actual Scottish kingdom to which Kenneth succeeded.” The\r\nPicts were recognised as a distinct people even in the tenth century,\r\nbut before the twelfth they lost their characteristic nominal\r\ndistinction by being amalgamated with the Scots, their conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe Scoto-Irish after their arrival in Argyle did not long continue\r\nunder the separate authority of the three brothers, Lorn, Fergus,\r\nand Angus. They were said to have been very far advanced in life\r\nbefore leaving Ireland, and the Irish chroniclers assert that St.\r\nPatrick gave them his benediction before his death, in the year 493.\r\nThe statement as to their advanced age derives some support from\r\ntheir speedy demise after they had laid the foundations of their\r\nsettlements, and of a new dynasty of kings destined to rule over the\r\nkingdom of Scotland. Angus was the first who died, leaving a son,\r\nMuredach, who succeeded him in the small government of Ila. After\r\nthe death of Lorn the eldest brother, Fergus, the last survivor,\r\nbecame sole monarch of the Scoto-Irish; but he did not long enjoy the\r\nsovereignty, for he died in 506.\r\n\r\nFergus was succeeded by his son Domangart, or Dongardus, who died\r\nin 511, after a short but troubled reign of about five years. His\r\ntwo sons Comgal and Gabhran or Gauran, successively enjoyed his\r\nauthority. Comgal had a peaceful reign of four and twenty years,\r\nduring which he extended his settlements. He left a son named Conal,\r\nbut Gauran his brother, notwithstanding, ascended the throne in the\r\nyear 535 without opposition. Gauran reigned two and twenty years,\r\nand, as we have already observed, was slain in a battle with the\r\nPicts under Bridei their king.\r\n\r\nConal, the son of Comgal, then succeeded in 557, and closed a reign\r\nof fourteen years in 571. It was during his reign that Columba’s\r\nmission to the Picts took place. A civil war ensued between Aodhan or\r\nAidan, the son of Gauran, and Duncha or Duncan, the son of Conal, for\r\nthe vacant crown, the claim to which was decided on the bloody field\r\nof Loro or Loco in Kintyre in 575, where Duncha was slain. Aidan,\r\nthe son of Gauran, had been formally inaugurated by St. Columba in\r\nIona, in 574. In the time of Aidan there were frequent wars between\r\nthe Dalriads and the English Saxons. Many battles were fought in\r\nwhich the Scots were generally defeated, the principal being that\r\nof Degsastan or Dalston near Carlisle, in 603, in which nearly the\r\nwhole of the Scottish army was defeated. The wars with the Saxons\r\nweakened the power of the Dalriads very considerably, and it was not\r\ntill after a long period of time that they again ventured to meet the\r\nSaxons in the field.\r\n\r\nDuring a short season of repose, Aidan, attended by St. Columba, went\r\nto the celebrated council of Drum-keat in Ulster, in the year 590. In\r\nthis council he claimed the principality of Dalriada, the land of his\r\nfathers, and obtained an exemption from doing homage to the kings of\r\nIreland, which his ancestors, it would appear, had been accustomed to\r\npay. Aidan died in 605 or 608, at the advanced age of eighty, and was\r\nburied In the church of Kil-keran, the ruins of which are still to be\r\nseen in the midst of Campbelton.\r\n\r\nAidan was succeeded in the throne by his son Eocha-bui, or the\r\n“yellow,” who reigned sixteen years. He carried on war with the\r\nCruithne of Ulster. After him came his brother Kenneth-Cear, or the\r\n“left-handed,” who was followed by Ferchar, son of Eogan, of the race\r\nof Lorn.\r\n\r\nDonal, surnamed _breac_ or freckled, the son of Eocha’-bui, of the\r\nrace of Gauran, succeeded Ferchar about 637. He was a warlike prince\r\nand had distinguished himself in the wars against the Cruithne of\r\nIreland. Congal-Claon, the son of Scanlan, the king of the Cruithne\r\nin Ulster, having slain Suibne-Mean, a powerful king of Ireland,\r\nwas attacked by Domnal II., supreme king of Ireland, who succeeded\r\nSuibne, and was defeated in the battle of Duncetheren, in 629.\r\nCongal sought refuge in Cantyre, and having persuaded Donal-breac,\r\nthe kinsman of Domnal, to join him in a war against the latter, they\r\ninvaded Ireland with a heterogeneous mass of Scoto-Irish, Picts,\r\nBritons, and Saxons, commanded by Donal and his brothers. Cealach,\r\nthe son of Maelcomh, the nephew of the reigning king, and as tanist\r\nor heir-apparent, the leader of his army, attacked Donal-breac in\r\nthe plain of Magh Rath or Moyra in Down, in 637, and completely\r\ndefeated him after an obstinate and bloody engagement. Congal, the\r\nmurderer of his sovereign, met his merited fate, and Donal-breac was\r\nobliged to secure his own and his army’s safety by a speedy return to\r\nCantyre. St. Columba had always endeavoured to preserve an amicable\r\nunderstanding between the Cruithne of Ulster and the Scoto-Irish, and\r\nhis injunctions were, that they should live in constant peace; but\r\nDonal disregarded the wise advice of the saint, and paid dearly for\r\nso doing. He was not more successful in an enterprise against the\r\nPicts, having been defeated by them in the battle of Glinne Mairison,\r\nGlenmairison, or Glenmoreson, probably in West Lothian,[99] during\r\nthe year 638. He ended his days at Straith-cairmaic or Strathcarron,\r\npossibly in the neighbourhood of Falkirk, by the sword of Hoan or\r\nOwen, one of the reguli of Strathcluyd, in the year 642. His son\r\nCathasuidh fell by the same hand in 649.\r\n\r\nConal II., the grandson of Conal I., who was also of the Fergusian\r\nrace of Congal, next ruled over the tribes of Cantyre and Argyle; but\r\nDungal, of the race of Lorn, having obtained the government of the\r\ntribe of Lorn, questioned the right of Conal. He did not, however,\r\ncarry his pretensions far, for Conal died, in undisturbed possession\r\nof his dominions, in 652, after a reign of ten years. To Donal-duin,\r\nor the brown, son of Conal, who reigned thirteen years, succeeded\r\nMaolduin, his brother, in 665. The family feuds which had long\r\nexisted between the Fergusian races of Comgal and Tauran, existed\r\nin their bitterest state during the reign of Maolduin. Domangart,\r\nthe son of Donal-breac, was murdered in 672, and Conal, the son of\r\nMaolduin, was assassinated in 675.\r\n\r\nFerchar-fada, or the _tall_, apparently of the race of Lorn, and\r\neither the son or grandson of Ferchar, who died in 637, seized the\r\nreins of government upon the death of Maolduin. On the death of\r\nFerchar, in 702, the sceptre passed again to the Fergusian race in\r\nthe person of Eocha’-rineval, remarkable for his Roman nose, the son\r\nof Domangart. The reign of this prince was short and unfortunate.\r\nHis sceptre was seized by Ainbhcealach, the son of Ferchar-fada,\r\nwho succeeded Eocha’ in 705. He was of an excellent disposition,\r\nbut after reigning one year, was dethroned by his brother, Selvach,\r\nand obliged, in 706, to take refuge in Ireland. Selvach attacked\r\nthe Britons of Strathcluyd, and gained two successive victories\r\nover them, the one at Longecoleth in 710, and the other at the\r\nrock of Mionuirc in 716. At the end of twelve years, Ainbhcealach\r\nreturned from Ireland, to regain a sceptre which his brother had\r\nby his cruelties shown himself unworthy to wield, but he perished\r\nin the battle of Finglein, perhaps Glen Fyne at the head of Loch\r\nFyne, in 719. Selvach met a more formidable rival in Duncha-beg, who\r\nwas descended from Fergus, by the line of Congal; he assumed the\r\ngovernment of Cantyre and Argail, and confined Selvach to his family\r\nsettlement of Lorn. These two princes appear to have been fairly\r\nmatched in disposition and valour, and both exerted themselves for\r\nthe destruction of one another, thus bringing many miseries upon\r\ntheir tribes. In an attempt which they made to invade the territories\r\nof each other in 719 by means of currachs, a naval combat ensued off\r\nAirdeanesbi, (probably Ardaness on the coast of Argyle,) in which\r\nSelvach was overcome by Duncha; but Selvach was not subdued. The\r\ndeath of Duncha in 721 put an end to his designs; but Eocha’ III.,\r\nthe son of Eocha’-rineval, the successor of Duncha, being as bent on\r\nthe overthrow of Selvach as his predecessor, continued the war. The\r\nrival chiefs met at Irroisfoichne in 727, where a battle was fought,\r\nwhich produced nothing but irritation and distress. This lamentable\r\nstate of things was put an end to by the death of Selvach in 729.\r\nThis event enabled Eocha to assume the government of Lorn, and thus\r\nthe Dalriadan kingdom which had been alternately ruled by chiefs of\r\nthe houses of Fergus and Lorn became again united under Eocha. He\r\ndied in 733, after a reign of thirteen years, during nine of which he\r\nruled over Cantyre and Argyle, and four over all the Dalriadic tribes.\r\n\r\nEocha was succeeded in the kingdom by Muredach, the son of\r\nAinbhceallach, of the race of Lorn. His reign was short and\r\nunfortunate. In revenge for an act of perfidy committed by Dungal,\r\nthe son of Selvach, who had carried off Forai or Torai, the daughter\r\nof Brude, and the niece of Ungus, the great Pictish king, the latter,\r\nin the year 736, led his army from Strathearn, through the passes\r\nof the mountains into Lorn, which he wasted with fire and sword.\r\nHe seized Dunad, in Mid-Lorn, and burned Creic, another fortress\r\nin the Ross of Mull, taking Dungal and Feradach, the two sons of\r\nSelvach, prisoners. Muredach went in pursuit of his enemy, and having\r\novertaken him at Knock Cairpre, at Calatros, on the shores of the\r\nLinne,[100] a battle ensued, in which the Scots were repulsed with\r\ngreat slaughter. Talorgan, the brother of Ungus, commanded the Picts\r\non this occasion, and pursued the flying Scots. In this pursuit\r\nMuredach is supposed to have perished, after a reign of three years.\r\n\r\nEogban or Ewan, the son of Muredach, took up the fallen succession in\r\n736, and died in 739, in which year the Dalriadic sceptre was assumed\r\nby Aodh-fin, the son of Eocha’ III., and grandson of Eocha’-rineval,\r\ndescended from the Fergusian race of Gauran. In 740 he measured his\r\nstrength with the celebrated Ungus; but victory declared for neither,\r\nand during the remainder of Ungus’ reign, he did not attempt to renew\r\nhostilities. After the death of Ungus, in 761, Aodh-fin declared war\r\nagainst the Picts, whose territories he entered from Upper Lorn,\r\npenetrating through the passes of Glenorchy and Breadalbane. In 767\r\nhe reached Forteviot, the Pictish capital in Strathearn, where he\r\nfought a doubtful battle with Ciniod the Pictish king. Aodh-fin died\r\nin 769, after a splendid reign of thirty years.[101]\r\n\r\nFergus II., son of Aodh-fin, succeeded to the sceptre on the demise\r\nof his father, and died after an unimportant reign of three years.\r\nSelvach II., the son of Eogan, assumed the government in 772.\r\nHis reign, which lasted twenty-four years, presents nothing very\r\nremarkable in history.\r\n\r\nA new sovereign of a different lineage, now mounted the throne of the\r\nScots in 796, in the person of Eocha or Auchy, the son of Aodh-fin\r\nof the Gauran race. Eocha’ IV. is known also by the latinized\r\nappellation of Achaius. The story of the alliance between Achaius and\r\nCharlemagne has been shown to be a fable; although it is by no means\r\nimprobable that he entered into an important treaty with the Picts,\r\nby marrying Urgusia, the daughter of Urguis, an alliance which, it is\r\nsaid, enabled his grandson Kenneth afterwards to claim and acquire\r\nthe Pictish sceptre, in right of Urgusia his grandmother. Eocha died\r\nin 826, after a happy and prosperous reign of thirty years. He was\r\nsucceeded by Dungal, the son of Selvach II., of the race of Lorn,\r\nbeing the last of that powerful family who swayed the Dalriadic\r\nsceptre. After a feeble but stormy reign of seven years, he died in\r\n833.\r\n\r\nAlpin, the last of the Scoto-Irish kings, and the son of Eocha IV.\r\nand of Urgusia, now mounted the throne. He was killed in 836, near\r\nthe site of Laicht castle, on the ridge which separates Kyle from\r\nGalloway. The fiction that Alpin fell in a battle with the Picts,\r\nwhen asserting his right to the Pictish throne, has long been\r\nexploded.\r\n\r\nIn 836 Kenneth, the son of Alpin, succeeded his father. He was a\r\nprince of a warlike disposition, and of great vigour of mind and\r\nbody. He avenged the death of his father by frequent inroads among\r\nthe people dwelling to the south of the Clyde; but the great glory\r\nof his reign consists in his achievements against the Picts, which\r\nsecured for him and his posterity the Pictish sceptre. The Pictish\r\npower had, previous to the period of Kenneth’s accession, been\r\ngreatly enfeebled by the inroads of the Danish Vikingr; but it was\r\nnot till after the death of Uven, the Pictish king, in 839, after\r\na distracted reign of three years, that Kenneth made any serious\r\nattempt to seize the Pictish diadem. On the accession of Wred,\r\nKenneth, in accordance with the principle of succession said by\r\nBede to have prevailed among the Picts, claimed the Pictish throne\r\nin right of Urgusia, his grandmother; Wred died in 842, and after\r\nan arduous struggle, Kenneth wrested the sceptre from Bred, his\r\nsuccessor, in 843, after he had reigned over the Scots seven years.\r\n\r\nBurton[102] thinks there can be no doubt that the two countries were\r\nprepared for a fusion whenever a proper opportunity offered, but that\r\nthis was on account of a matrimonial alliance between the two royal\r\nhouses cannot with certainty be ascertained.[103] As we have said\r\nalready, it is extremely improbable that Kenneth gained his supremacy\r\nby extermination. The Picts certainly appear to have suffered severe\r\ndefeat, but the likelihood is that after Kenneth succeeded to the\r\nthrone, a gradual fusion of the two people took place, so that in\r\ncourse of time they became essentially one, speaking one language,\r\nobeying the same laws, and following the same manners and customs.\r\nIf we knew for certain to what race the Picts belonged, and what\r\nlanguage they spoke, it might help us not a little to understand\r\nthe nature and extent of the amalgamation; but as we know so little\r\nabout these, and as the chroniclers, in speaking of this event, are\r\nso enigmatical and meagre, we are left almost entirely to conjecture.\r\nWe are certain, at any rate, that from some cause or other, the\r\nkings of the Dalriadic Scots, about the middle of the 9th century,\r\nobtained supremacy over at least the Southern Picts, who from that\r\ntime forward ceased to be a separate nation.[104]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Scoto-Irish kings affords few materials either\r\namusing or instructive; but it was impossible, from the connexion\r\nbetween that history and the events that will follow in detail,\r\nto pass it over in silence. The Scoto-Irish tribes appear to have\r\nadopted much the same form of government as existed in Ireland at the\r\ntime of their departure from that kingdom; the sovereignty of which,\r\nthough nominally under one head, was in reality a _pentarchy_, which\r\nallowed four provincial kings to dispute the monarchy of the fifth.\r\nThis system was the prolific source of anarchy, assassinations, and\r\ncivil wars. The Dalriads were constantly kept in a state of intestine\r\ncommotion and mutual hostility by the pretensions of their rival\r\nchiefs, or princes of the three races, who contended with the common\r\nsovereign for pre-eminence or exemption. The _dlighe-tanaiste_, or\r\nlaw of tanistry, which appears to have been generally followed as in\r\nIreland, as well in the succession of kings as in that of chieftains,\r\nrather increased than mitigated these disorders; for the claim to\r\nrule not being regulated by any fixed law of hereditary succession,\r\nbut depending upon the capricious will of the tribe, rivals were not\r\nfound wanting to dispute the rights so conferred. There was always,\r\nboth in Ireland and in Argyle, an heir presumptive to the Crown\r\nchosen, under the name of _tanist_, who commanded the army during the\r\nlife of the reigning sovereign, and who succeeded to him after his\r\ndemise. Budgets, and committees of supply, and taxes, were wholly\r\nunknown in those times among the Scots, and the monarch was obliged\r\nto support his dignity by voluntary contributions of clothes, cattle,\r\nfurniture, and other necessaries.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that tradition supplied the place of\r\nwritten records for many ages after the extinction of the Druidical\r\nsuperstition. Hence among the Scots, traditionary usages and local\r\ncustoms long supplied the place of positive or written laws. It\r\nis a mistake to suppose, as some writers have done, that the law\r\nconsisted in the mere will of the Brehon or judge. The office of\r\nBreitheamhuin or Brehon was hereditary, and it is quite natural to\r\ninfer, that under such a system of jurisprudence, the _dictum_ of\r\nthe judge might not always comport with what was understood to be\r\nthe _common law_ or practice; but from thence, to argue that the\r\nwill of the judge was to be regarded as the law itself, is absurd,\r\nand contrary to every idea of justice. As the principle of the rude\r\njurisprudence of the Celtic tribes had for its object the reparation,\r\nrather than the prevention of crimes, almost every crime, even of the\r\nblackest kind, was commuted by a mulct or payment. Tacitus observes\r\nin allusion to this practice, that it was “a temper wholesome to the\r\ncommonwealth, that homicide and lighter transgressions were settled\r\nby the payment of horses or cattle, part to the king or community,\r\npart to him or his friends who had been wronged.” The law of Scotland\r\nlong recognised this system of compensation. The fine was termed,\r\nunder the Brehon law, _eric_, which not only signifies a reparation,\r\nbut also a fine, a ransom, a forfeit. Among the Albanian Scots it\r\nwas called _cro_, a term preserved in the _Regiam Majestatem_, which\r\nhas a whole chapter showing “the _cro_ of ilk man, how mikil it\r\nis.”[105] This law of reparation, according to O’Connor, was first\r\npromulgated in Ireland, in the year 164.[106] According to the\r\n_Regiam Majestatem_, the _cro_ of a villain was sixteen cows; of an\r\nearl’s son or thane, one hundred; of an earl, one hundred and forty;\r\nand that of the king of Scots, one thousand cows, or three thousand\r\n_oras_, that is to say, three oras for every cow.\r\n\r\nBesides a share of the fines imposed, the Brehon or judge obtained a\r\npiece of arable land for his support. When he administered justice,\r\nhe used to sit sometimes on the top of a hillock or heap of stones,\r\nsometimes on turf, and sometimes even on the middle of a bridge,\r\nsurrounded by the suitors, who, of course, pleaded their own cause.\r\nWe have already seen that, under the system of the Druids, the\r\noffices of religion, the instruction of youth, and the administration\r\nof the laws, were conducted in the open air; and hence the prevalence\r\nof the practice alluded to. But this practice was not peculiar to\r\nthe Druids; for all nations, in the early stages of society, have\r\nfollowed a similar custom. The Tings of the Scandinavians, which\r\nconsisted of circular enclosures of stone, without any covering, and\r\nwithin which both the judicial and legislative powers were exercised,\r\nafford a striking instance of this. According to Pliny,[107] even\r\nthe Roman Senate first met in the open air, and the sittings of the\r\nCourt of the Areopagus, at Athens, were so held. The present custom\r\nof holding courts of justice in halls is not of very remote antiquity\r\nin Scotland, and among the Scoto-Irish, the baron bailie long\r\ncontinued to dispense justice to the baron’s vassals from a moothill\r\nor eminence, which was generally on the bank of a river, and near to\r\na religious edifice.\r\n\r\nOf the various customs and peculiarities which distinguished the\r\nancient Irish, as well as the Scoto-Irish, none has given rise to\r\ngreater speculation than that of _fosterage_; which consisted in the\r\nmutual exchange, by different families, of their children for the\r\npurpose of being nursed and bred. Even the son of the chief was so\r\nentrusted during pupilarity with an inferior member of the clan. An\r\nadequate reward was either given or accepted in every case, and the\r\nlower orders, to whom the trust was committed, regarded it as an\r\nhonour rather than a service. “Five hundred kyne and better,” says\r\nCampion, “were sometimes given by the Irish to procure the nursing of\r\na great man’s child.” A firm and indissoluble attachment always took\r\nplace among foster-brothers, and it continues in consequence to be a\r\nsaying among Highlanders, that “affectionate to a man is a friend,\r\nbut a foster-brother is as the life-blood of his heart.” Camden\r\nobserves, that no love in the world is comparable by many degrees\r\nto that of foster-brethren in Ireland.[108] The close connexion\r\nwhich the practice of fosterage created between families, while it\r\nfrequently prevented civil feuds, often led to them. But the strong\r\nattachment thus created was not confined to foster-brothers, it also\r\nextended to their parents. Spenser relates of the foster-mother to\r\nMurrough O’Brien, that, at his execution, she sucked the blood from\r\nhis head, and bathed her face and breast with it, saying that it was\r\ntoo precious to fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, at this stage of our labours, to enter upon the\r\nsubject of clanship; we mean to reserve our observations thereon till\r\nwe come to the history of the clans, when we shall also notice some\r\npeculiarities or traits of the Highlanders not hitherto mentioned.\r\nWe shall conclude this chapter by giving lists of the Pictish and\r\nScoto-Irish Kings, which are generally regarded as authentic. A great\r\nmany other names are given by the ancient chroniclers previous to\r\nthe points at which the following lists commence, but as these are\r\nconsidered as totally untrustworthy, we shall omit them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF THE PICTISH KINGS, CHIEFLY ACCORDING TO THE\r\nPICTISH CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\n  +-------+---------------------------------+---------+--------+-------+\r\n  |

In an able paper, however, read recently by Dr. Archibald\r\nSmith before the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, he shows that\r\nArgyleshire was invaded but not subdued by Ungus, king of the Picts,\r\nin 736 and 741. Dr. Smith supported his conclusion by reference to\r\npassages in the annals of Tigernach, of Ulster, and the Albanic Duan,\r\nwhich seemed to him to give an intelligible and continuous account\r\nof regal succession in Dalriada, but afforded no countenance to the\r\ntheory of Pinkerton of the entire conquest of the Scots in Britain\r\nby Ungus, nor to the conclusion Dr. Skene has come to, viz., the\r\ncomplete supremacy of the Picts in the Scottish Dalriada, and the\r\nextinction of Dalriada as a Scottish nation from the year 741 to the\r\nera of a new Scottish kingdom founded by Kenneth Macalpin in the\r\nyear 843. On the contrary, he was convinced that Aodh-fionn was the\r\nrestorer of its full liberty to the crushed section of Lorn, and that\r\nhe was, at the close of his career, the independent ruler of Dalriada\r\nas a Scottish nation.\r\n\r\n[102] Scotland, vol. i. p. 329.\r\n\r\n[103] See Skene’s preface to _Chronicle of Picts and Scots_, p.\r\nxcviii. et seq., for some curious and ingenious speculation on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[104] We shall take the liberty of quoting here an extract from an\r\nable and ingenious paper read by Dr. Skene before the Soc. of Ant.,\r\nin June 1861, and quoted in Dr. Gordon’s _Scotichronicon_, p. 83. It\r\nwill help, we think, to throw a little light on this dark subject,\r\nand assist the reader somewhat to understand the nature and extent\r\nof the so-called Scottish conquest. “The next legend which bears\r\nupon the history of St. Andrews is that of St. Adrian, at 4th March.\r\nThe best edition of this legend is in the Aberdeen Breviary, and it\r\nis as follows:--Adrian was a native of Hungary, and after preaching\r\nthere for some time, was seized with a desire to preach to other\r\npeople; and having gathered together a company, he set out ‘ad\r\norientales Scotiæ partes que tunc a Pictis occupabantur,’ _i.e._,\r\n‘to the eastern parts of Scotland, which were then occupied by the\r\nPicts,’--and landed there with 6,606 confessors, clergy, and people,\r\namong whom were Glodianus, Gayus, Minanus, Scobrandus, and others,\r\nchief priests. These men, with their bishop, Adrian, ‘deleto regno\r\nPictorum,’ _i.e._, ‘the Pictish kingdom being destroyed,’--did many\r\nsigns, but afterwards desired to have a residence on the Isle of\r\nMay. The Danes, who then devastated the whole of Britain, came to\r\nthe Island, and there slew them. Their martyrdom is said to have\r\ntaken place in the year 875. It will be observed that they are here\r\nsaid to have settled in the east part of Scotland, opposite the Isle\r\nof May, that is in Fife, while the Picts still occupied it; that\r\nthe Pictish kingdom is then said to have been destroyed; and that\r\ntheir martyrdom took place in 875, thirty years after the Scottish\r\nconquest under Kenneth M’Alpin. Their arrival was therefore almost\r\ncoincident with the Scottish conquest; and the large number said to\r\nhave come, not the modest twenty-one who arrived with Regulus, but\r\n6,606 confessors, clergy, and people, shows that the traditionary\r\nhistory was really one of an invasion, and leads to the suspicion\r\nat once that it was in reality a part of the Scottish occupation\r\nof the Pictish kingdom. This suspicion is much strengthened by two\r\ncorroborative circumstances: 1st, the year 875, when they are said to\r\nhave been slain by the Danes, falls in the reign of Constantine, the\r\nson of Kenneth Macalpin, in his fourteenth year, and in this year the\r\nPictish chronicle records a battle between the Danes and the Scots,\r\nand adds, that after it, ‘occasi sunt Scotti in Coachcochlum,’ which\r\nseems to refer to this very slaughter. 2d. Hector Boëce preserves\r\na different tradition regarding their origin. He says--‘Non desunt\r\nqui scribant sanctissimos Christi martyros Hungaros fuisse. _Alii\r\nex Scotis Anglisque gregarie collectos_’--_i.e._, ‘Some write that\r\nthe most holy martyrs of Christ were Hungarians. Others (say) that\r\nthey were collected from the Scots and English.’ There was therefore\r\na tradition that the clergy slain were not Hungarians, but a body\r\ncomposed of Scotti and Angli. But Hadrian was a bishop; he landed\r\nin the east of Fife, within the parochia of S. Regulus, and he is\r\nplaced at the head of some of the lists of bishops of St. Andrews\r\nas first bishop. It was therefore the Church of St. Andrews that\r\nthen consisted of clergy collected from among the Scotti and the\r\nAngli. The Angli probably represented the Church of Acca, and the\r\nScotti those brought in by Adrian. The real signification of this\r\noccupation of St. Andrews by Scottish clergy will be apparent when\r\nwe recollect that the Columban clergy, who had formerly possessed\r\nthe chief ecclesiastical seats among the Picts, had been expelled in\r\n717, and Anglic clergy introduced--the cause of quarrel being the\r\ndifference of their usages. Now, the Pictish chronicle states as the\r\nmain cause of the overthrow of the Pictish kingdom, a century and\r\na half later, this very cause. It says--‘Deus enim eos pro merito\r\nsuæ malitiæ alienos ac otiosos hæreditate dignatus est facere, quia\r\nilli non solum Deum, missam, ac præceptum spreverunt sed et in jure\r\næqualitatis _aliis_ aequi _pariter_ noluerunt.’ _I.e._, ‘For God, on\r\naccount of their wickedness, deemed them worthy to be made hereditary\r\nstrangers and idlers; because they contemned not only God, the mass,\r\nand the precept (of the Church), but besides refused to be regarded\r\nas on the same equality with others.’ They were overthrown, not only\r\nbecause they despised ‘Deum missam et præceptum,’ but because they\r\nwould not tolerate the other party. And this great grievance was\r\nremoved, when St. Andrews appears at the head of the Scottish Church\r\nin a solemn Concordat with the king Constantine, when, as the Pictish\r\nChronicle tells us, ‘Constantinus Rex et Cellachus Episcopus leges\r\ndisciplinasque fidei atque jura ecclesiarum evangeliorum que _pariter\r\ncum Scottis_ devoverunt custodiri.’ _I.e._, ‘King Constantine and\r\nBishop Kellach vowed to preserve the laws and discipline of the faith\r\nand the rights of the churches and gospels, equally with the Scots.’\r\nObserve the parallel language of the two passages. In the one, the\r\n‘Picti in jure æqualitatis aliis,’ that is, the Scottish clergy,\r\n‘aequi pariter noluerunt,’ and in the other the King and the Bishop\r\nof St. Andrews ‘vowed to preserve the laws and discipline of the\r\nfaith,’ ‘_pariter cum Scottis_,’ the thing the Picts would not do.\r\nIt seems plain, therefore, that the ecclesiastical element entered\r\nlargely into the Scottish conquest; and a main cause and feature of\r\nit was a determination on the part of the Scottish clergy to recover\r\nthe benefices they had been deprived of. The exact coincidence of\r\nthis great clerical invasion of the parochia of St. Andrews by\r\necclesiastics, said by one tradition to have been Scots, and the\r\nsubsequent position of St. Andrews as the head of the Scottish\r\nChurch, points strongly to this as the true historic basis of the\r\nlegend of S. Adrian.”\r\n\r\n[105] Lib. ix. c. xxiv.\r\n\r\n[106] O’Connor’s Dissert.\r\n\r\n[107] Lib. viii. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[108] Holland’s Camden, Ireland, p. 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 843-1107.\r\n\r\n  The Norse Invasions--Kenneth--Constantine--Aodh--Grig\r\n  and Eocha--Donald IV.--Constantine III.--Danes--Battle\r\n  of Brunanburg--Malcolm I.--Indulph--Duff--Culen--Kenneth\r\n  III.--Battle of Luncarty--Malcolm II.--Danes--Duncan--Thorfinn,\r\n  Jarl of Orkney--Macbeth--Battle with Siward--Lulach--Malcolm\r\n  III. (Ceanmore)--Queen Margaret--Effect of Norwegian\r\n  Conquest--Donal-bane--Edgar--Norsemen--Influx of\r\n  Anglo-Saxons--Isolation of Highlands--Table of Kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor about two centuries after the union of the two kingdoms, the\r\nprincipal facts to be recorded are the extension of the Scottish\r\ndominion southwards beyond the Forth and Clyde, towards the present\r\nborder, and northwards beyond Inverness, and the fierce contests that\r\ntook place with the “hardy Norsemen” of Scandinavia and Denmark, who\r\nduring this period continued not only to pour down upon the coasts\r\nand islands of Scotland, but to sway the destinies of the whole of\r\nEurope. During this time the history of the Highlands is still to\r\na great extent the history of Scotland, and it was not till about\r\nthe 12th century that the Highlanders became, strictly speaking, a\r\npeculiar people, confined to the territory whose boundaries were\r\nindicated in the first chapter, having for their neighbours on the\r\neast and south a population of undoubtedly Teutonic origin. The Norse\r\ninvasions not only kept Scotland in continual commotion at the time,\r\nbut must have exercised an important influence on its whole history,\r\nand contributed a new and vigorous element to its population. These\r\nVikingr, about the end of the 9th century, became so powerful as to\r\nbe able to establish a separate and independent kingdom in Orkney and\r\nthe Western Islands, which proved formidable not only to the king of\r\nScotland, but also to the powerful king of Norway. “It is difficult\r\nto give them distinctness without risk of error, and it is even\r\nhard to decide how far the mark left by these visitors is, on the\r\none hand, the brand of the devastating conqueror; or, on the other\r\nhand, the planting among the people then inhabiting Scotland of a\r\nhigh-conditioned race--a race uniting freedom and honesty in spirit\r\nwith a strong and healthy physical organization. It was in the north\r\nthat the inroad preserved its most distinctive character, probably\r\nfrom its weight, as most completely overwhelming the original\r\npopulation, whatever they might be; and though, in the histories,\r\nthe king of Scots appears to rule the northern end of Britain, the\r\nterritory beyond Inverness and Fort-William had aggregated in some\r\nway round a local magnate, who afterwards appears as a Maormor.\r\nHe was not a viceroy of the king of Norway: and if he was in any\r\nway at the order of the King of Scotland, he was not an obedient\r\nsubordinate.”[109]\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Macbeda or Macbeth, the principle of hereditary\r\nsuccession to the throne, from father to son, appears not to have\r\nbeen recognised; the only principle, except force, which seems to\r\nhave been acted upon being that of collateral succession, brother\r\nsucceeding to brother, and nephew to uncle. After the time of\r\nMacbeth, however, the hereditary principle appears to have come into\r\nfull force, to have been recognised as that by which alone succession\r\nto the throne was to be regulated.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of the Scottish and Pictish power under one supreme\r\nchief, enabled these nations not only to repel foreign aggression,\r\nbut afterwards to enlarge their territories beyond the Forth, which\r\nhad hitherto formed, for many ages, the Pictish boundary on the south.\r\n\r\nAlthough the power of the tribes to the north of the Forth was\r\ngreatly augmented by the union which had taken place, yet all the\r\ngenius and warlike energy of Kenneth were necessary to protect him\r\nand his people from insult. Ragnor Lodbrog (_i.e._, Ragnor of the\r\nShaggy Bones,) with his fierce Danes infested the country round\r\nthe Tay on the one side, and the Strathclyde Britons on the other,\r\nwasted the adjoining territories, and burnt Dunblane. Yet Kenneth\r\novercame these embarrassments, and made frequent incursions into the\r\nSaxon territories in Lothian, and caused his foes to tremble. After\r\na brilliant and successful reign, Kenneth died at Forteviot, the\r\nPictish capital, 7 miles S.W. of Perth, on the 6th of February, 859,\r\nafter a reign of twenty-three years. Kenneth, it is said, removed the\r\nfamous stone which now sustains the coronation chair at Westminster\r\nAbbey, from the ancient seat of the Scottish monarchy in Argyle, to\r\nScone. Kenneth (but according to some Constantine, the Pictish king,\r\nin 820), built a church at Dunkeld, to which, in 850, he removed the\r\nrelics of St. Columba from Iona, which at this time was frequently\r\nsubjected to the ravages of the Norsemen. He is celebrated also\r\nas a legislator, but no authentic traces of his laws now appear,\r\nthe Macalpine laws attributed to the son of Alpin being clearly\r\napocryphal.\r\n\r\nThe sceptre was assumed by Donald III., son of Alpin. He died in the\r\nyear 863, after a short reign of four years. It is said he restored\r\nthe laws of Aodh-fin, the son of Eocha III. They were probably\r\nsimilar to the ancient Brehon laws of Ireland.\r\n\r\nConstantine, the son of Kenneth, succeeded his uncle Donald, and\r\nsoon found himself involved in a dreadful conflict with the Danish\r\npirates. Having, after a contest which lasted half a century,\r\nestablished themselves in Ireland, and obtained secure possession of\r\nDublin, the Vikingr directed their views towards the western coasts\r\nof Scotland, which they laid waste. These ravages were afterwards\r\nextended to the whole of the eastern coast, and particularly to the\r\nshores of the Frith of Forth; but although the invaders were often\r\nrepulsed, they never ceased to renew their attacks. In the year 881,\r\nConstantine, in repelling an attack of the pirates, was slain at\r\na place called Merdo-fatha, or Werdo, probably the present Perth,\r\naccording to Maclauchlan.\r\n\r\nAodh or Hugh, _the fair-haired_, succeeded his brother Constantine.\r\nHis reign was unfortunate, short, and troublesome. Grig, who was\r\nMaormor, or chief, of the country between the Dee and the Spey,\r\nhaving become a competitor for the crown, Aodh endeavoured to put him\r\ndown, but did not succeed; and having been wounded in a battle fought\r\nat Strathallan, (or possibly Strathdon,) he was carried to Inverurie,\r\nwhere he died, after lingering two months, having held the sceptre\r\nonly one year.\r\n\r\nGrig now assumed the crown, and, either to secure his possession,\r\nor from some other motive, he associated with him in the government\r\nEocha, son of Ku, the British king of Strathclyde, and the grandson,\r\nby a daughter, of Kenneth Macalpin. After a reign of eleven years,\r\nboth Eocha and Grig were forced to abdicate, and gave way to Donald\r\nIV., who succeeded them in 893.\r\n\r\nDuring his reign the kingdom was infested by the piratical\r\nincursions of the Danes. Although they were defeated by Donald in\r\na bloody action at Collin, said to be on the Tay, near Scone, they\r\nreturned under Ivar O’Ivar, from Ireland, in the year 904, but were\r\ngallantly repulsed, and their leader killed in a threatened attack\r\non Forteviot, by Donald, who unfortunately also perished, after a\r\nreign of eleven years. In his reign the kings of present Scotland are\r\nno longer called _reges Pictorum_ by the Irish Annalists, but _Ri\r\nAlban_, or kings of Alban; and in the Pictish Chronicle _Pictavia_\r\ngives place to _Albania_.\r\n\r\nConstantine III., the son of Aodh, a prince of a warlike and\r\nenterprising character, next followed. He had to sustain, during\r\nan unusually long reign, the repeated attacks of the Danes. In one\r\ninvasion they plundered Dunkeld, and in 908, they attempted to obtain\r\nthe grand object of their designs, the possession of Forteviot in\r\nStrathearn, the Pictish capital; but in this design they were again\r\ndefeated, and forced to abandon the country. The Danes remained quiet\r\nfor a few years, but in 918 their fleet entered the Clyde, from\r\nIreland, under the command of Reginald, where they were attacked by\r\nthe Scots in conjunction with the Northern Saxons, whom the ties\r\nof common safety had now united for mutual defence. Reginald is\r\nsaid to have drawn up his Danes in four divisions; the first headed\r\nby Godfrey O’Ivar; the second by Earls; the third by Chieftains;\r\nand the fourth by Reginald himself, as a reserve. The Scots, with\r\nConstantine at their head, made a furious attack on the first three\r\ndivisions, which they forced to retire. Reginald’s reserve not being\r\navailable to turn the scale of victory against the Scots, the Danes\r\nretreated during the night, and embarked on board their fleet.\r\n\r\nAfter this defeat of the Danes, Constantine enjoyed many years’\r\nrepose. A long grudge had existed between him and Æthelstane, son\r\nof Edward, the elder, which at last came to an open rupture. Having\r\nformed an alliance with several princes, and particularly with\r\nAnlof, king of Dublin as well as of Northumberland, and son-in-law\r\nof Constantine, the latter collected a large fleet in the year 937,\r\nwith which he entered the Humber. The hope of plunder had attracted\r\nmany of the Vikingr to Constantine’s standard, and the sceptre of\r\nÆthelstane seemed now to tremble in his hand. But that monarch was\r\nfully prepared for the dangers with which he was threatened, and\r\nresolved to meet his enemies in battle. After a long, bloody, and\r\nobstinate contest at Brunanburg, near the southern shore of the\r\nHumber, victory declared for Æthelstane. Prodigies of valour were\r\ndisplayed on both sides, especially by Turketel, the Chancellor of\r\nEngland; by Anlof, and by the son of Constantine, who lost his life.\r\nThe confederates, after sustaining a heavy loss, sought for safety\r\nin their ships. This, and after misfortunes, possibly disgusted\r\nConstantine with the vanities of this world, for, in the fortieth\r\nyear of his reign, he put into practice a resolution which he had\r\nformed of resigning his crown and embracing a monastic life. He\r\nbecame Abbot of the Monastery of St. Andrews in 943, and thus ended\r\na long and chequered, but vigorous, and, on the whole, successful\r\nreign in a cloister, like Charles V. Towards the end of this reign\r\nthe term Scotland was applied to this kingdom by the Saxons, a term\r\nwhich before had been given by them to Ireland. Constantine died in\r\n952.\r\n\r\nMalcolm I., the son of Donald IV., obtained the abdicated throne. He\r\nwas a prince of great abilities and prudence, and Edmund of England\r\ncourted his alliance by ceding Cumbria, then consisting of Cumberland\r\nand part of Westmoreland, to him, in the year 945, on condition\r\nthat he would defend that northern county, and become the ally of\r\nEdmund. Edred, the brother and successor of Edmund, accordingly\r\napplied for, and obtained the aid of Malcolm against Anlaf, king of\r\nNorthumberland, whose country, according to the barbarous practice\r\nof the times, he wasted, and carried off the people with their\r\ncattle. Malcolm, after putting down an insurrection of the Moray-men\r\nunder Cellach, their Maormor, or chief, whom he slew, was sometime\r\nthereafter slain, as is supposed, at Ulurn or Auldearn in Moray, by\r\none of these men, in revenge for the death of his chief.\r\n\r\nIndulph, the son of Constantine III., succeeded the murdered monarch\r\nin the year 953. He sustained many severe conflicts with the Danes,\r\nand ultimately lost his life in 961, after a reign of eight years, in\r\na successful action with these pirates, on the moor which lies to the\r\nwestward of Cullen.\r\n\r\nDuff, the son of Malcolm I., now mounted the throne; but Culen,\r\nthe son of Indulf, laid claim to the sceptre which his father had\r\nwielded. The parties met at Drum Crup (probably Crieff), and, after a\r\ndoubtful struggle, in which Doncha, the Abbot of Dunkeld, and Dubdou,\r\nthe Maormor of Athole, the partisans of Culen, lost their lives,\r\nvictory declared for Duff. But this triumph was of short duration,\r\nfor Duff was afterwards obliged to retreat from Forteviot into the\r\nnorth, and was assassinated at Forres in the year 965, after a brief\r\nand unhappy reign of four years and a half.\r\n\r\nCulen, the son of Indulf, succeeded, as a matter of course, to the\r\ncrown of Duff, which he stained by his vices. He and his brother\r\nEocha were slain in Lothian, in an action with the Britons of\r\nStrathclyde in 970, after an inglorious reign of four years and a\r\nhalf. During his reign Edinburgh was captured from the English, this\r\nbeing the first known step in the progress of the gradual extension\r\nof the Scottish kingdom between the Forth and the Tweed.[110]\r\n\r\nKenneth III., son of Malcolm I., and brother of Duff, succeeded Culen\r\nthe same year. He waged a successful war against the Britons of\r\nStrathclyde, and annexed their territories to his kingdom. During\r\nhis reign the Danes meditated an attack upon Forteviot, or Dunkeld,\r\nfor the purposes of plunder, and, with this view, they sailed up\r\nthe Tay with a numerous fleet. Kenneth does not appear to have been\r\nfully prepared, being probably not aware of the intentions of the\r\nenemy; but collecting as many of his chiefs and their followers as\r\nthe spur of the occasion would allow, he met the Danes at Luncarty,\r\nin the vicinity of Perth. Malcolm, the Tanist, prince of Cumberland,\r\nit is said, commanded the right wing of the Scottish army; Duncan,\r\nthe Maormor of Athole, had the charge of the left: and Kenneth, the\r\nking, commanded the centre. The Danes with their battle-axes made\r\ndreadful havoc, and compelled the Scottish army to give way; but the\r\nlatter was rallied by the famous Hay, the traditional ancestor of\r\nthe Kinnoul family, and finally repulsed the Danes, who, as usual,\r\nfled to their ships. Burton thinks the battle of Luncarty “a recent\r\ninvention.”\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Danes enabled Kenneth to turn his attention to the\r\ndomestic concerns of his kingdom. He appears to have directed his\r\nthoughts to bring about a complete change in the mode of succession\r\nto the crown, in order to perpetuate in and confine the crown to\r\nhis own descendants. This alteration could not be well accomplished\r\nas long as Malcolm, the son of Duff, the Tanist of the kingdom, and\r\nprince of Cumberland, stood in the way; and, accordingly, it has\r\nbeen said that Kenneth was the cause of the untimely death of prince\r\nMalcolm, who is stated to have been poisoned. It is said that Kenneth\r\ngot an act passed, that in future the son, or nearest male heir,\r\nof the king, should always succeed to the throne; and that in case\r\nthat son or heir were not of age at the time of the king’s demise,\r\nthat a person of rank should be chosen Regent of the kingdom, until\r\nthe minor attained his fourteenth year, when he should assume the\r\nreins of government; but whether such a law was really passed on the\r\nmoot-hill of Scone or not, of which we have no evidence, certain it\r\nis that two other princes succeeded to the crown before Malcolm the\r\nson of Kenneth. Kenneth, after a reign of twenty-four years, was, it\r\nis said, in 994 assassinated at Fettercairn by Finella,[111] the\r\nwife of the Maormor of the Mearns, and the daughter of Cunechat, the\r\nMaormor of Angus, in revenge for having put her only son to death.\r\nIt has been thought that till this time the Maormorship of Angus\r\nwas in some measure independent of the Scottish crown, never having\r\nthoroughly yielded to its supremacy, that the death of the young\r\nchief took place in course of an effort on the part of Kenneth for\r\nits reduction, and that Kenneth himself was on a visit to the quarter\r\nat the time of his death, for exacting the usual royal privileges\r\nof _cain_ and _cuairt_, or a certain tax and certain provision for\r\nthe king and his followers when on a journey, due by the chiefs or\r\nlandholders of the kingdom.[112]\r\n\r\nConstantine IV., son of Culen, succeeded; but his right was disputed\r\nby Kenneth, the Grim, _i.e._ strong, son of Duff. The dispute was\r\ndecided at Rathveramon, _i.e._ the castle at the mouth of the Almond,\r\nnear Perth, where Constantine lost his life in the year 995.\r\n\r\nKenneth IV., the son of Duff, now obtained the sceptre which he had\r\ncoveted; but he was disturbed in the possession thereof by Malcolm,\r\nthe son of Kenneth III., heir presumptive to the crown. Malcolm took\r\nthe field in 1003, and decided his claim to the crown in a bloody\r\nbattle at Monivaird, in Strathearn, in which Kenneth, after a noble\r\nresistance, received a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nMalcolm II. now ascended the vacant throne, but was not destined to\r\nenjoy repose. At the very beginning of his reign he was defeated\r\nat Durham by the army of the Earl of Northumberland, under his son\r\nUchtred, who ordered a selection of good-looking Scotch heads to be\r\nstuck on the walls of Durham.\r\n\r\nThe Danes, who had now obtained a firm footing in England, directed\r\ntheir attention in an especial manner to Scotland, which they were in\r\nhopes of subduing. Sigurd, the Earl of Orkney, carried on a harassing\r\nand predatory warfare on the shores of the Moray Frith, which he\r\ncontinued even after a matrimonial alliance he formed with Malcolm,\r\nby marrying his daughter; but this was no singular trait in the\r\ncharacter of a Vikingr, who plundered friends and foes with equal\r\npleasure. The scene of Sigurd’s operations was chosen by his brother\r\nnorthmen for making a descent, which they effected near Speymouth.\r\nThey carried fire and sword through Moray, and laid siege to the\r\nfortress of Nairn, one of the strongest in the north. The Danes were\r\nforced to raise the siege for a time, by Malcolm, who encamped his\r\narmy in a plain near Kilflos or Kinloss. In this position he was\r\nattacked by the invaders, and, after a severe action, was forced to\r\nretreat, after being seriously wounded.\r\n\r\nMalcolm, in 1010, marched north with his army, and encamped at\r\nMortlach. The Danes advanced to meet the Scots, and a dreadful and\r\nfierce conflict ensued, the result of which was long dubious. At\r\nlength the northmen gave way and victory declared for Malcolm. Had\r\nthe Danes succeeded they would in all probability have obtained as\r\npermanent a footing in North Britain as they did in England; but the\r\nScottish kings were determined, at all hazards, never to suffer them\r\nto pollute the soil of Scotland by allowing them even the smallest\r\nsettlement in their dominions. In gratitude to God for his victory,\r\nMalcolm endowed a religious house at Mortlach, with its church\r\nerected near the scene of action. Maclauchlan, however, maintains\r\nthat this church was planted by Malcolm Ceanmore.\r\n\r\nMany other conflicts are narrated with minute detail by the later\r\nchroniclers as having taken place between Malcolm and the Danes, but\r\nit is very doubtful how far these are worthy of credit. That Malcolm\r\nhad enough to do to prevent the Danes from overrunning Scotland and\r\nsubduing the inhabitants can readily be believed; but as we have few\r\nauthentic particulars concerning the conflicts which took place, it\r\nwould serve no purpose to give the imaginary details invented by\r\ncomparatively recent historians.\r\n\r\nSome time after this Malcolm was engaged in a war with the\r\nNorthumbrians, and, having led his army, in 1018, to Carham, near\r\nWerk, on the southern bank of the Tweed, where he was met by Uchtred,\r\nthe Earl of Northumberland, a desperate battle took place, which\r\nwas contested with great valour on both sides.[113] The success\r\nwas doubtful on either side, though Uchtred claimed a victory; but\r\nhe did not long enjoy the fruits of it, as he was soon thereafter\r\nassassinated when on his road to pay obeisance to the great Canute.\r\nEndulf, the brother and successor of Uchtred, justly dreading the\r\npower of the Scots, was induced to cede Lothian to Malcolm for ever,\r\nwho, on this occasion, gave oblations to the churches and gifts to\r\nthe clergy, and they in return transmitted his name to posterity.\r\nHe was designed, par excellence, by the Latin chroniclers, _rex\r\nvictoriosissimus_; by St. Berchan, the _Forranach_ or destroyer.\r\n\r\nThe last struggle with which Malcolm was threatened, was with\r\nthe celebrated Canute, who, for some cause or other not properly\r\nexplained, entered Scotland in the year 1031; but these powerful\r\nparties appear not to have come to action. Canute’s expedition\r\nappears, from what followed, to have been fitted out to compel\r\nMalcolm to do homage for Cumberland, for it is certain that Malcolm\r\nengaged to fulfil the conditions on which his predecessors had held\r\nthat country, and that Canute thereafter returned to England.\r\n\r\nBut the reign of Malcolm was not only distinguished by foreign wars,\r\nbut by civil contests between rival chiefs. Finlegh, the Maormor of\r\nRoss, and the father of Macbeth, was assassinated in 1020, and about\r\ntwelve years thereafter, Maolbride, the Maormor of Moray, grandfather\r\nof Lulach, was, in revenge for Finlegh’s murder, burnt within his\r\ncastle, with fifty of his men.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a splendid reign of thirty years, Malcolm slept\r\nwith his fathers, and his body was transferred to Iona, and interred\r\nwith due solemnity among the remains of his predecessors. By some\r\nauthorities he is said to have been assassinated at Glammis.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was undoubtedly a prince of great acquirements. He made many\r\nchanges and some improvements in the internal policy of his kingdom,\r\nand in him religion always found a guardian and protector. But\r\nalthough Malcolm is justly entitled to this praise, he by no means\r\ncame up to the standard of perfection assigned him by fiction. In his\r\nreign Scotland appears to have reached its present boundary on the\r\nsouth, the Tweed, and Strathclyde was incorporated with the rest of\r\nthe kingdom. Malcolm was the first who was called _Rex Scotiæ_, and\r\nmight justly claim to be so designated, seeing that he was the first\r\nto hold sway over nearly the whole of present Scotland,--the only\r\nportions where his authority appears to have been seriously disputed\r\nbeing those in which the Danes had established themselves.\r\n\r\nDuncan, son of Bethoc or Beatrice, daughter of Malcolm II.,\r\nsucceeded his grandfather in the year 1033. “In the extreme north,\r\ndominions more extensive than any Jarl of the Orkneys had hitherto\r\nacquired, were united under the rule of Thorfinn, Sigurd’s son,\r\nwhose character and appearance have been thus described:--‘He was\r\nstout and strong, but very ugly, severe and cruel, but a very clever\r\nman.’ The extensive districts then dependant upon the Moray Maormors\r\nwere in the possession of the celebrated Macbeth.”[114] Duncan, in\r\n1033, desiring to extend his dominions southwards, attacked Durham,\r\nbut was forced to retire with considerable loss. His principal\r\nstruggles, however, were with his powerful kinsman, Thorfinn, whose\r\nsuccess was so great that he extended his conquests as far as the\r\nTay. “His men spread over the whole conquered country,” says the\r\n_Orkneyinga Saga_,[115] “and burnt every hamlet and farm, so that\r\nnot a cot remained. Every man that they found they slew; but the old\r\nmen and women fled to the deserts and woods, and filled the country\r\nwith lamentation. Some were driven before the Norwegians and made\r\nslaves. After this Earl Thorfinn returned to his ships, subjugating\r\nthe country everywhere in his progress.” Duncan’s last battle, in\r\nwhich he was defeated, was in the neighbourhood of Burghead, near the\r\nMoray Frith; and shortly after this, on the 14th August, 1040, he was\r\nassassinated in Bothgowanan,--which, in Gaelic, is said to mean “the\r\nsmith’s hut,”--by his kinsman the Maormor Macbeda or Macbeth. Duncan\r\nhad reigned only five years when he was assassinated by Macbeth,\r\nleaving two infant sons, Malcolm and Donal, by a sister of Siward,\r\nthe Earl of Northumberland. The former fled to Cumberland, and the\r\nlatter took refuge in the Hebrides, on the death of their father.\r\n\r\nMacbeth, “snorting with the indigested fumes of the blood of\r\nhis sovereign,” immediately seized the gory sceptre. As several\r\nfictions have been propagated concerning the history and genealogy\r\nof Macbeth, we may mention that, according to the most authentic\r\nauthorities, he was by birth Thane of Ross, and by his marriage with\r\nthe Lady Gruoch,--who had a claim to the throne, as granddaughter of\r\nKenneth,--became also Thane of Moray, during the minority of Lulach,\r\nthe infant son of that lady, by her former marriage with Gilcomgain,\r\nthe Maormor or Thane of Moray. Lady Gruoch was the daughter of\r\nBoedhe, son of Kenneth IV.; and thus Macbeth united in his own person\r\nmany powerful interests which enabled him to take quiet possession\r\nof the throne of the murdered sovereign. He, of course, found no\r\ndifficulty in getting himself inaugurated at Scone, under the\r\nprotection of the clans of Moray and Ross, and the aid of those who\r\nfavoured the pretensions of the descendants of Kenneth IV.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts were made on the part of the partisans of Malcolm,\r\nson of Duncan, to dispossess Macbeth of the throne. The most\r\nformidable was that of Siward, the powerful Earl of Northumberland,\r\nand the relation of Malcolm, who, at the instigation or command of\r\nEdward the Confessor, led a numerous army into Scotland in the year\r\n1054. They marched as far north as Dunsinnan, where they were met by\r\nMacbeth, who commanded his troops in person. A furious battle ensued,\r\nbut Macbeth fled from the field after many displays of courage. The\r\nScots lost 3,000 men, and the Saxons 1,500, including Osbert, the son\r\nof Siward. Macbeth retired to his fastnesses in the north, and Siward\r\nreturned to Northumberland; but Malcolm continued the war till the\r\ndeath of Macbeth, who was slain by Macduff, Thane of Fife, in revenge\r\nfor the cruelties he had inflicted on his family, at Lumphanan,\r\nin Aberdeenshire, in the year 1056, although, according to Skene\r\n(_Chronicles_), it was in August, 1057.\r\n\r\nMacbeth was unquestionably a man of great vigour, and well fitted\r\nto govern in the age in which he lived; and had it not been for the\r\nindelible character bestowed upon him by Shakespere (who probably\r\nfollowed the chronicle of Holinshed), his character might have stood\r\nwell with posterity. “The deeds which raised Macbeth and his wife\r\nto power were not in appearance much worse than others of their day\r\ndone for similar ends. However he may have gained his power, he\r\nexercised it with good repute, according to the reports nearest to\r\nhis time.”[116] Macbeth, “in a manner sacred to splendid infamy,” is\r\nthe first king of Scotland whose name appears in the ecclesiastical\r\nrecords as a benefactor of the church, and, it would appear, the\r\nfirst who offered his services to the Bishop of Rome. According to\r\nthe records of St. Andrews, he made a gift of certain lands to the\r\nmonastery of Lochleven, and certainly sent money to the poor of Rome,\r\nif, indeed, he did not himself make a pilgrimage to the holy city.\r\n\r\nAfter the reign of Macbeth, the former irregular and confusing mode\r\nof succession ceased, and the hereditary principle was adopted and\r\nacted upon.\r\n\r\nLulach, the great-grandson of Kenneth IV., being supported by the\r\npowerful influence of his own family, and that of the deceased\r\nmonarch, ascended the throne at the age of twenty-five or twenty-six;\r\nbut his reign lasted only a few months, he having fallen in battle at\r\nEssie, in Strathbogie, in defending his crown against Malcolm. The\r\nbody of Lulach was interred along with that of Macbeth, in Iona, the\r\ncommon sepulchre, for many centuries, of the Scottish kings.\r\n\r\nMalcolm III., better known in history by the name of Malcolm\r\nCeanmore, or _great head_, vindicated his claim to the vacant throne,\r\nand was crowned at Scone, 25th April, 1057. His first care was to\r\nrecompense those who had assisted him in obtaining the sovereignty,\r\nand it is said that he created new titles of honour, by substituting\r\nearls for thanes; but this has been disputed, and there are really\r\nno data from which a certain conclusion can be drawn.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1059 Malcolm paid a visit to Edward the Confessor,\r\nduring whose reign he lived on amicable terms with the English; but\r\nafter the death of that monarch he made a hostile incursion into\r\nNorthumberland, and wasted the country. He even violated the peace of\r\nSt. Cuthbert in Holy Island.\r\n\r\nWilliam, Duke of Normandy, having overcome Harold in the battle of\r\nHastings, on the 14th October, 1066, Edgar Ætheling saw no hopes\r\nof obtaining the crown, and left England along with his mother and\r\nsisters, and sought refuge in Scotland. Malcolm, on hearing of the\r\ndistress of the illustrious strangers, left his royal palace at\r\nDunfermline to meet them, and invited them to Dunfermline, where they\r\nwere hospitably entertained. Margaret, one of Edgar’s sisters, was a\r\nprincess of great virtues and accomplishments; and she at once won\r\nthe heart of Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe offer of his hand was accepted, and their nuptials were\r\ncelebrated with great solemnity and splendour. This queen was a\r\nblessing to the king and to the nation, and appears to have well\r\nmerited the appellation of _Saint_. There are few females in history\r\nwho can be compared with Queen Margaret.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary, and apart from the object of the present\r\nwork, to enter into any details of the wars between Malcolm and\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, and William Rufus. Suffice it to say that\r\nboth Malcolm and his eldest son Edward were slain in a battle on\r\nthe Alne, on the 13th November, 1093, after a reign of thirty-six\r\nyears. Queen Margaret, who was on her death-bed when this catastrophe\r\noccurred, died shortly after she received the intelligence with great\r\ncomposure and resignation to the will of God. Malcolm had six sons,\r\nviz., Edward, who was killed along with his father, Edmund, Edgar,\r\nEthelred, Alexander, and David, and two daughters, Maud, who was\r\nmarried to Henry I. of England, and Mary, who married Eustache, Count\r\nof Boulogne. Of the sons, Edgar, Alexander, and David, successively\r\ncame to the crown.\r\n\r\nThorfinn, Earl of Orkney, died in 1064, and his extensive possessions\r\nin Scotland did not revert to his descendants, but to the native\r\nchiefs, who had had the original right to possess them. These\r\nchiefs appear to have been independent of the Scottish sovereign,\r\nand to have caused him no small amount of trouble. A considerable\r\npart of Malcolm’s reign was spent in endeavouring to bring them\r\ninto subjection, and before his death he had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the whole of Scotland, with perhaps the exception of Orkney,\r\nacknowledging him as sole monarch. The Norwegian conquest appears\r\nto have effected a most important change in the character of the\r\npopulation and language of the eastern lowlands of the north of\r\nScotland. The original population must in some way have given\r\nway to a Norwegian one, and, whatever may have been the original\r\nlanguage, we find after this one of a decidedly Teutonic character\r\nprevailing in this district, probably introduced along with the Norse\r\npopulation. “In the more mountainous and Highland districts, however,\r\nwe are warranted in concluding that the effect must have been very\r\ndifferent, and that the possession of the country by the Norwegians\r\nfor thirty years could have exercised as little permanent influence\r\non the population itself, as we are assured by the Saga it did upon\r\nthe race of their chiefs.\r\n\r\n“Previously to this conquest the northern Gaelic race possessed the\r\nwhole of the north of Scotland, from the western to the eastern sea,\r\nand the general change produced by the conquest must have been, that\r\nthe Gael were for the first time confined within those limits which\r\nthey have never since exceeded, and that the eastern districts became\r\ninhabited by that Gothic race, who have also ever since possessed\r\nthem.”[117]\r\n\r\nOn the demise of Malcolm, Donal-bane his brother assumed the\r\ngovernment; but Duncan, the son of Malcolm, who had lived many\r\nyears in England, and held a high military rank under William\r\nRufus, invaded Scotland with a large army of English and Normans,\r\nand forced Donal to retire for safety to the Hebrides. Duncan, whom\r\nsome writers suppose to have been a bastard, and others a legitimate\r\nson of Malcolm by a former wife, enjoyed the crown only six months,\r\nhaving been assassinated by Maolpeder, the Maormor of the Mearns,\r\nat Menteith, at the instigation, it is believed, of Donal. Duncan\r\nleft, by his wife Ethreda, daughter of Gospatrick, a son, William,\r\nsometimes surnamed Fitz-Duncan.\r\n\r\nDonal-bane again seized the sceptre, but he survived Duncan only two\r\nyears. Edgar Ætheling having assembled an army in England, entered\r\nScotland, and made Donal prisoner in an action which took place in\r\nSeptember 1097. He was imprisoned by orders of Edgar, and died at\r\nRoscobie in Forfarshire, after having been deprived of his eyesight,\r\naccording to the usual practice of the age. The series of the pure\r\nScoto-Irish kings may be said to have ended with Donal-bane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seal of Edgar.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edgar, who appears to have been of a gentle and peaceful\r\ndisposition, is almost devoid of incident, the principal events\r\nbeing the marriage of his sister Matilda to the English Henry, and\r\nthe wasting and conquest of the Western Islands by Magnus Olaveson\r\nand his Norwegians. This last event had but little effect on\r\nScotland proper, as these Islands at that time can hardly be said\r\nto have belonged to it. These Norsemen appear to have settled among\r\nand mixed with the native inhabitants, and thus to have formed a\r\npopulation, spoken of by the Irish Annalists under the name of\r\nGallgael, “a horde of pirates, plundering on their own account,\r\nand under their own leaders, when they were not following the\r\nbanner of any of the greater sea-kings, whose fleets were powerful\r\nenough to sweep the western seas, and exact tribute from the lesser\r\nisland chieftains.”[118] Edgar died in 1107, and was succeeded by\r\nhis brother Alexander, whom he enjoined to bestow upon his younger\r\nbrother David the district of Cumbria.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at an era in our history, when the line of\r\ndemarcation between the inhabitants of the Lowlands and Highlands\r\nof Scotland begins to appear, and when, by the influx of a Gothic\r\nrace into the former, the language of that part of North Britain is\r\ncompletely revolutionized, when a new dynasty or race of sovereigns\r\nascends the throne, and when a great change takes places in the laws\r\nand constitution of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Anglo-Saxon colonization of the Lowlands of Scotland\r\ndoes not come exactly within the design of the present work; yet,\r\nas forming an important feature in the history of the Lowlands of\r\nScotland, as contradistinguished from the Highlands, a slight notice\r\nof it may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Roman abdication of North Britain in the year\r\n446, which was soon succeeded by the final departure of the Romans\r\nfrom the British shores, the Saxons, a people of Gothic origin,\r\nestablished themselves upon the Tweed, and afterwards extended\r\ntheir settlements to the Frith of Forth, and to the banks of the\r\nSolway and the Clyde. About the beginning of the sixth century the\r\nDalriads, as we have seen, landed in Kintyre and Argyle from the\r\nopposite coast of Ireland; and colonized these districts, whence, in\r\nthe course of little more than two centuries, they overspread the\r\nHighlands and western islands, which their descendants have ever\r\nsince continued to possess. Towards the end of the eighth century,\r\na fresh colony of Scots from Ireland settled in Galloway among the\r\nBritons and Saxons, and having overspread the whole of that country,\r\nwere afterwards joined by detachments of the Scots of Kintyre and\r\nArgyle, in connection with whom they peopled that peninsula. Besides\r\nthese three races, who made permanent settlements in Scotland, the\r\nScandinavians colonized the Orkney and Shetland islands, and also\r\nestablished themselves on the coasts of Caithness and Sutherland, and\r\nin the eastern part of the country north of the Frith of Tay.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these early settlements of the Gothic race,\r\nthe era of the Saxon colonization of the Lowlands of Scotland is,\r\nwith more propriety, placed in the reign of Malcolm Ceanmore, who,\r\nby his marriage with a Saxon princess, and the protection he gave\r\nto the Anglo-Saxon fugitives who sought an asylum in his dominions\r\nfrom the persecutions of William the Conqueror and his Normans,\r\nlaid the foundations of those great changes which took place in the\r\nreigns of his successors. Malcolm, in his warlike incursions into\r\nNorthumberland and Durham, carried off immense numbers of young men\r\nand women, who were to be seen in the reign of David I. in almost\r\nevery village and house in Scotland. The Gaelic population were\r\nquite averse to the settlement of these strangers among them, and\r\nit is said that the extravagant mode of living introduced by the\r\nSaxon followers of Queen Margaret, was one of the reasons which led\r\nto their expulsion from Scotland, in the reign of Donal-bane, who\r\nrendered himself popular with his people by this unfriendly act.\r\n\r\nThis expulsion was, however, soon rendered nugatory, for on the\r\naccession of Edgar, the first sovereign of the Scoto-Saxon dynasty,\r\nmany distinguished Saxon families with their followers settled in\r\nScotland, to the heads of which families the king made grants of\r\nland of considerable extent. Few of these foreigners appear to have\r\ncome into Scotland during the reign of Alexander I., the brother and\r\nsuccessor of Edgar; but vast numbers of Anglo-Saxons, Anglo-Normans,\r\nand Flemings, established themselves in Scotland in the reign of\r\nDavid I. That prince had received his education at the court of Henry\r\nI., and had married Maud or Matilda, the only child of Waltheof,\r\nEarl of Northumberland and Huntingdon, by Judith, niece to William\r\nthe Conqueror on the mother’s side. This lady had many vassals, and\r\nwhen David came to the throne, in the year 1124, he was followed by\r\na thousand Anglo-Normans, to whom he distributed lands, on which\r\nthey and their followers settled. Many of the illustrious families in\r\nScotland originated from this source.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Ceanmore had, before his accession to the throne, resided for\r\nsome time in England as a fugitive, under the protection of Edward\r\nthe Confessor, where he acquired a knowledge of the Saxon language;\r\nwhich language, after his marriage with the princess Margaret, became\r\nthat of the Scottish court. This circumstance made that language\r\nfashionable among the Scottish nobility, in consequence of which and\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon colonization under David I., the Gaelic language\r\nwas altogether superseded in the Lowlands of Scotland in little\r\nmore than two centuries after the death of Malcolm. A topographical\r\nline of demarcation was then fixed as the boundary between the two\r\nlanguages, which has ever since been kept up, and presents one of the\r\nmost singular phenomena ever observed in the history of philology.\r\n\r\nThe change of the seat of government by Kenneth, on ascending the\r\nPictish throne, to Abernethy, also followed by the removal of the\r\nmarble chair, the emblem of sovereignty, from Dunstaffnage to Scone,\r\nappears to have occasioned no detriment to the Gaelic population of\r\nthe Highlands; but when Malcolm Ceanmore transferred his court, about\r\nthe year 1066, to Dunfermline,--which also became, in place of Iona,\r\nthe sepulchre of the Scottish kings,--the rays of royal bounty, which\r\nhad hitherto diffused their protecting and benign influence over the\r\ninhabitants of the Highlands, were withdrawn, and left them a prey\r\nto anarchy and poverty. “The people,” says General David Stewart,\r\n“now beyond the reach of the laws, became turbulent and fierce,\r\nrevenging in person those wrongs for which the administrators of\r\nthe laws were too distant and too feeble to afford redress. Thence\r\narose the institution of chiefs, who naturally became the judges and\r\narbiters in the quarrels of their clansmen and followers, and who\r\nwere surrounded by men devoted to the defence of their rights, their\r\nproperty, and their power; and accordingly the chiefs established\r\nwithin their own territories a jurisdiction almost wholly independent\r\nof their liege lord.”\r\n\r\nThe connection which Malcolm and his successors maintained with\r\nEngland, estranged still farther the Highlanders from the dominion of\r\nthe sovereign and the laws; and their history, after the population\r\nof the Lowlands had merged into and adopted the language of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, presents, with the exception of the wars between rival\r\nclans which will be noticed afterwards, nothing remarkable till their\r\nfirst appearance on the military theatre of our national history in\r\nthe campaigns of Montrose, Dundee, and others.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Alexander I., then, Scotland was divided between\r\nthe Celt and the Saxon, or more strictly speaking, Teuton, pretty\r\nmuch as it is at the present day, the Gaelic population having\r\nbecome gradually confined very nearly to the limits indicated in the\r\nfirst chapter. They never appear, at least until quite recently, to\r\nhave taken kindly to Teutonic customs and the Teutonic tongue, and\r\nresented much the defection of their king in court, in submitting\r\nto Saxon innovations. Previous to this the history of the Highlands\r\nhas been, to a very great extent, the history of Scotland, and even\r\nfor a considerable time after this, _Scotia_ was applied strictly\r\nto the country north of the Forth and Clyde, the district south of\r\nthat being known by various other names. During and after Edgar’s\r\ntime, the whole of the country north of the Tweed became more and\r\nmore a counterpart of England, with its thanes, its earls, and its\r\nsheriffs; and even the Highland maormors assumed the title of earl,\r\nin deference to the new customs. The Highlanders, however, it is well\r\nknown, for centuries warred against these Saxon innovations, becoming\r\nmore and more a peculiar people, being, up till the end of the last\r\ncentury, a perpetual thorn in the flesh of their Saxon rulers and\r\ntheir Saxon fellow-subjects. They have a history of their own, which\r\nwe deem worthy of narration.[119]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF THE SCOTTISH KINGS, FROM 843 TO 1097, ADJUSTED\r\nFROM THE BEST AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                                        |Date of |Duration|       |\r\n  |          NAMES OF THE KINGS.           |Access- |   of   | Death.|\r\n  |                                        | -ion.  | Reign. |       |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                                        |   A.D. | Years. |  A.D. |\r\n  | KENNETH MACALPINE over the Scots and   |        |        |       |\r\n  |   Picts,                               |   843  |  16    |  859  |\r\n  | DONAL MACALPIN,                        |   859  |   4    |  863  |\r\n  | CONSTANTINE II., son of Kenneth,       |   863  |  18    |  881  |\r\n  | AODH, or HUGH, the son of Kenneth,     |   881  |   1    |  882  |\r\n  | EOCHA, or ACHY, or Grig, jointly,      |   882  |  11    |  893  |\r\n  | DONAL IV., the son of Constantine,     |   893  |  11    |  904  |\r\n  | CONSTANTINE III., the son of Aodh,     |   904  |  40    |  944[120]\r\n  | MALCOLM I., son of Donal IV.,          |   944  |   9    |  953  |\r\n  | INDULF, the son of Constantine III.,   |   953  |   8    |  961  |\r\n  | DUF, the son of Malcolm I.,            |   961  |   4½   |  965  |\r\n  | CULEN, the son of Indulf,              |   965  |   4½   |  970  |\r\n  | KENNETH III., son of Malcolm I.,       |   970  |  24    |  994  |\r\n  | CONSTANTINE IV., son of Culen,         |   994  |   1½   |  995  |\r\n  | KENNETH IV., son of Duf,               |   995  |   8    | 1003  |\r\n  | MALCOLM II., son of Kenneth III.,      |  1003  |  30    | 1033  |\r\n  | DUNCAN, grandson of Malcolm II.,       |  1033  |   6    | 1039  |\r\n  | MACBETH, son of Finlegh,               |  1039  |  17    | 1056  |\r\n  | LULACH, son of Gruoch and Gilcomgain,  |  1056  |    ½   | 1057  |\r\n  | MALCOLM III., Ceanmore, son of Duncan, |  1057  |  36⅔   | 1093  |\r\n  | DONALD BANE, son of Duncan,            |  1093  |    ½   | 1094  |\r\n  | DUNCAN II., son of Malcolm III.,       |  1094  |    ½   | 1094  |\r\n  | DONALD BANE again,                     |  1094  |   3    | 1097  |\r\n  | EDGAR, son of Malcolm III.,            |  1097  |   9    | 1106  |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACINTYRE.

The king,\r\nhowever, showed himself more than a match for his enemies, as he\r\nnot only defeated their immediate purpose, but, pursuing them with\r\nhis army across the Moray Frith, chastised them so effectually as\r\nto keep them quiet for the remainder of his reign, which ended by\r\nhis death, in April, 1124. In 1130, six years after the accession of\r\nKing David I. to the Scottish throne, while he was in England, the\r\nMoraymen again rose against the semi-Saxon king, but were defeated at\r\nStrickathrow, in Forfarshire, by Edward the Constable, son of Siward\r\nBeorn, Angus the Earl of Moray being left among the dead, Malcolm\r\nhis brother escaping to carry on the conflict. In 1134 David himself\r\ntook the field against these Highlanders, and, with the assistance of\r\nthe barons of Northumberland, headed by Walter L’Espec, completely\r\nsubdued the Moraymen, confiscated the whole district, and bestowed\r\nit upon knights in whose fidelity he could place confidence, some of\r\nthese being Normans.\r\n\r\nThis was manifestly, according to Dr. Maclauchlan, the period of\r\nthe dispersion of the ancient Moravienses. Never till then was the\r\npower of the Moray chiefs thoroughly broken, and only then were the\r\ninhabitants proscribed, and many of them expelled. The Murrays,\r\nafterwards so powerful, found their way to the south, carrying with\r\nthem the name of their ancient country, and some of the present\r\ntribes of Sutherland, as well as of Inverness-shire, who, there is\r\nreason to believe, belonged to the Scoto-Pictish inhabitants of\r\nMoray, removed their dwellings to those portions of the country which\r\nthey have occupied ever since. The race of Mac Heth may appear among\r\nthe Mac Heths or Mac Aoidhs, _the Mackays_ of Sutherland, nor is this\r\nrendered less probable by the Morganaich or _sons of Morgan_, the\r\nancient name of the Mackays, appearing in the Book of Deer as owning\r\npossessions and power in Buchan in the 10th or 11th century.[121]\r\n\r\nThe next enterprise of any note was undertaken by Somerled, thane\r\nof Argyle and the Isles, against the authority of Malcolm IV.,\r\nwho, after various conflicts, was repulsed, though not subdued, by\r\nGilchrist, Earl of Angus. A peace, concluded with this powerful\r\nchieftain in 1153, was considered of such importance as to form an\r\nepoch in the dating of Scottish charters. A still more formidable\r\ninsurrection broke out among the Moraymen, under Gildominick, on\r\naccount of an attempt, on the part of the Government, to intrude the\r\nAnglo-Norman jurisdiction, introduced into the Lowlands, upon their\r\nCeltic customs, and the settling of Anglo-Belgic colonists among\r\nthem. These insurgents laid waste the neighbouring counties; and\r\nso regardless were they of the royal authority, that they actually\r\nhanged the heralds who were sent to summon them to lay down their\r\narms. Malcolm despatched the gallant Earl Gilchrist with an army\r\nto subdue them, but he was defeated, and forced to re-cross the\r\nGrampians.\r\n\r\nThis defeat aroused Malcolm, who was naturally of an indolent\r\ndisposition. About the year 1160 he marched north with a powerful\r\narmy, and found the enemy on the moor of Urquhart, near the Spey,\r\nready to give him battle. After passing the Spey, the noblemen in\r\nthe king’s army reconnoitred the enemy; but they found them so\r\nwell prepared for action, and so flushed with their late success,\r\nthat they considered the issue of a battle rather doubtful. On this\r\naccount, the commanders advised the king to enter into a negotiation\r\nwith the rebels, and to promise, that in the event of a submission\r\ntheir lives would be spared. The offer was accepted, and the king\r\nkept his word. According to Fordun,[122] the king, by the advice\r\nof his nobles, ordained that every family in Moray which had been\r\nengaged in the rebellion should, within a limited time, remove out of\r\nMoray to other parts of the kingdom, where lands would be assigned to\r\nthem, and that their places should be supplied with people from other\r\nparts of the kingdom. For the performance of this order, they gave\r\nhostages, it is said,[123] and at the time appointed transplanted\r\nthemselves, some into the northern, but the greater number into the\r\nsouthern counties. Chalmers considers this removal of the Moray men\r\nas “an egregious improbability,” because “the dispossessing of a\r\nwhole people is so difficult an operation, that the recital of it\r\ncannot be believed without strong evidence;”[124] it is very probable\r\nthat only the ringleaders and their families were transported. The\r\nolder historians say that the Moraymen were almost totally cut off in\r\nan obstinate battle, and strangers brought into their place.[125]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Somerled, the ambitious and powerful lord of the\r\nIsles, made another and a last attempt upon the king’s authority,\r\nHaving collected a large force, chiefly in Ireland, he landed, in\r\n1164, near Renfrew; but he was defeated by the brave inhabitants\r\nand the king’s troops in a decisive battle, in which he and his son\r\nGillecolum were slain.\r\n\r\nThe reign of William the Lion, who succeeded his brother in 1165, was\r\nmarked by many disturbances in the Highlands. The Gaelic population\r\ncould not endure the new settlers whom the Saxon colonization had\r\nintroduced among them, and every opportunity was taken to vex and\r\nannoy them. An open insurrection broke out in Ross-shire, headed by\r\nDonald Bane, known also as MacWilliam, which obliged William, in the\r\nyear 1181, to march into the north, where he built the two castles\r\nof Eddirton and Dunscath to keep the people in check. He restored\r\nquiet for a few years; but, in 1187, Donald Bane again renewed his\r\npretensions to the crown, and raised the standard of revolt in\r\nthe north. He took possession of Ross, and wasted Moray. William\r\nlost no time in leading an army against him. While the king lay at\r\nInverness with his army, a party of 3,000 faithful men, under the\r\ncommand of Roland, the brave lord of Galloway, and future Constable\r\nof Scotland, fell in with Donald Bane and his army upon the Mamgarvy\r\nmoor, on the borders of Moray. A conflict ensued in which Donald\r\nand five hundred of his followers were killed. Roland carried the\r\nhead of Donald to William, “as a savage sign of returning quiet.”\r\nAfter this comparative quietness prevailed in the north till the\r\nyear 1196, when Harold, the powerful Earl of Orkney and Caithness,\r\ndisturbed its peace. William dispersed the insurgents at once;\r\nbut they again appeared the following year near Inverness, under\r\nthe command of Torphin, the son of Harold. The rebels were again\r\noverpowered. The king seized Harold, and obliged him to deliver up\r\nhis son, Torphin, as an hostage. Harold was allowed to retain the\r\nnorthern part of Caithness, but the king gave the southern part of\r\nit, called Sutherland, to Hugh Freskin, the progenitor of the Earls\r\nof Sutherland. Harold died in 1206; but as he had often rebelled, his\r\nson suffered a cruel and lingering death in the castle of Roxburgh,\r\nwhere he had been confined.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1211 a new insurrection broke out in Ross, headed\r\nby Guthred or Godfrey, the son of Donald Bane or MacWilliam, as he\r\nwas called. Great depredations were committed by the insurgents, who\r\nwere chiefly freebooters from Ireland, the Hebrides, and Lochaber.\r\nFor a long time they baffled the king’s troops; and although the\r\nking built two forts to keep them in check, and took many prisoners,\r\nthey maintained for a considerable period a desultory and predatory\r\nwarfare. Guthred even forced one of the garrisons to capitulate, and\r\nburnt the castle; but being betrayed by his followers into the hands\r\nof William Comyn, Earl of Buchan, the Justiciary of Scotland, he was\r\nexecuted in the year 1212.\r\n\r\nShortly after the accession of Alexander II. in 1214, the peace\r\nof the north was attempted to be disturbed by Donald MacWilliam,\r\nwho made an inroad from Ireland into Moray; but he was repulsed by\r\nthe tribes of that country, led by M’Intagart, the Earl of Ross.\r\nIn 1222, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles which presented\r\nthemselves from the nature of the country, Alexander carried an\r\narmy into Argyle, for the purpose of enforcing the homage of the\r\nwestern chiefs. His presence so alarmed the men of Argyle, that they\r\nimmediately made their submission. Several of the chiefs fled for\r\nsafety, and to punish them, the king distributed their lands among\r\nhis officers and their followers. After this invasion Argyle was\r\nbrought under the direct jurisdiction of the Scottish king, although\r\nthe descendants of the race of Somerled, Lord of the Isles, still\r\ncontinued to be the chief magnates.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year a tumult took place in Caithness, on account of\r\nthe severity with which the tithes were exacted by Adam, the bishop,\r\nwho, with his adviser, Serlo, was murdered by the bonders. The king,\r\nwho was at the time at Jedburgh, hearing of this murder, immediately\r\nhastened to the north with a military force, and inflicted the\r\npunishment of death upon the principal actors in this tragedy, who\r\namounted, it is said, to four hundred persons; and that their race\r\nmight become extinct, their children were emasculated, a practice\r\nvery common in these barbarous times. The Earl of Caithness, who\r\nwas supposed to have been privy to the murder, was deprived of half\r\nof his estate, which was afterwards restored to him on payment of\r\na heavy fine. The Earl is said to have been murdered by his own\r\nservants in the year 1231, and in order to prevent discovery, they\r\nlaid his body into his bed and set fire to the house.\r\n\r\nIn 1228 the country of Moray became the theatre of a new\r\ninsurrection, headed by a Ross-shire freebooter, named Gillespoc\r\nM’Scolane. He committed great devastations by burning some wooden\r\ncastles in Moray, and spoiling the crown lands. He even attacked and\r\nset fire to Inverness. A large army of horse and foot, under the\r\ncommand of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, Justiciary of Scotland, was,\r\nin 1229, sent against this daring rebel, who was captured, with his\r\ntwo sons, and their heads sent to the king.\r\n\r\nThe lords of Argyle usually paid homage to the king of Norway for\r\nsome of the Hebrides which belonged to that monarch, but Ewen,\r\non succeeding his father Duncan of Argyle in 1248, refused his\r\nhomage to the Scottish king, who wished to possess the whole of\r\nthe Western Isles. Though Ewen was perfectly loyal, and indeed was\r\none of the most honourable men of his time, Alexander marched an\r\narmy against him to enforce obedience, but his Majesty died on his\r\njourney in Kerrera, a small island near the coast of Argyle opposite\r\nOban, on July 8, 1249, in the fifty-first year of his age, and the\r\nthirty-fifth of his reign.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of the times, his son, Alexander III., then a\r\nboy only in his eighth year, was seated on the royal chair, or sacred\r\nstone of Scone, which was placed before the cross that stood within\r\nthe burying-ground. Immediately before his inauguration, the bishop\r\nof St. Andrews girded him with the sword of state, and explained\r\nto him, first in Latin and afterwards in Norman French, the nature\r\nof the compact he and his subjects were about to enter into. The\r\ncrown, after the king had been seated, was placed on his head, and\r\nthe sceptre put into his hand. He was then covered with the royal\r\nmantle, and received the homage of the nobles on their knees, who,\r\nin token of submission, threw their robes beneath his feet. On this\r\noccasion, agreeably to ancient practice, a Gaelic sennachy, or bard,\r\nclothed in a red mantle, and venerable for his great age and hoary\r\nlocks, approached the king, and in a bended and reverential attitude,\r\nrecited, from memory, in his native language, the genealogy of all\r\nthe Scottish kings, deducing the descent of the youthful monarch from\r\nGathetus, the fabulous founder of the nation.[126] The reign of this\r\nprince was distinguished by the entire subjugation of the western\r\nislands to the power of the Scottish crown. The Scandinavian settlers\r\nwere allowed to leave the islands, if inclined, and such of them as\r\nremained were bound to observe the Scottish laws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alexander III.--From Pinkerton’s Scottish Gallery.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the accession of Alexander III., an insurrection broke\r\nout against the Earl of Ross, of some of the people of that province.\r\nThe Earl apprehended their leader or captain, whom he imprisoned at\r\nDingwall. In revenge, the Highlanders seized upon the Earl’s second\r\nson at Balnagown, took him prisoner, and detained him as a hostage\r\ntill their captain should be released. The Monroes and the Dingwalls\r\nimmediately took up arms, and having pursued the insurgents, overtook\r\nthem at a place called Bealligh-ne-Broig, between Ferrandonald\r\nand Loch Broom, where a bloody conflict ensued. “The Clan Iver,\r\nClan-Talvich, and Clan-Laiwe,” says Sir Robert Gordon, “wer almost\r\nuterlie extinguished and slain.” The Monroes and Dingwalls lost a\r\ngreat many men. Dingwall of Kildun, and seven score of the surname\r\nof Dingwall, were killed. No less than eleven Monroes of the house\r\nof Foulis, who were to succeed one after another, fell, so that the\r\nsuccession of Foulis opened to an infant then lying in his cradle.\r\nThe Earl’s son was rescued, and to requite the service performed, he\r\nmade various grants of lands to the Monroes and Dingwalls.[127]\r\n\r\nIn 1263, Haco, the aged king of Norway, sailed with a large and\r\npowerful fleet, determined to enforce acknowledgment of his claims\r\nas superior of the Western Islands on their chiefs, as well as upon\r\nthe king of Scotland. Sailing southwards among the islands, one chief\r\nafter another acknowledged his supremacy, and helped to swell his\r\nforce, the only honourable exception being the stanch Ewen of Argyle.\r\nMeantime Haco brought his fleet to anchor in the Frith of Clyde,\r\nbetween Arran and the Ayrshire coast, his men committing ravages on\r\nthe neighbouring country, as, indeed, they appear to have done during\r\nthe whole of his progress. Negotiations entered into between Haco and\r\nAlexander III. came to nothing, and as winter was approaching, and\r\nhis fleet had suffered much from several severe storms which caught\r\nit, the former was fain to make his way homewards. A number of his\r\nmen, however, contrived to effect a landing near Largs, where they\r\nwere met by a miscellaneous Scottish host, consisting of cavalry\r\nand country people, and finally completely routed. The date of this\r\nskirmish, which is known as the battle of Largs, is October 2d, 1263.\r\nHaco died in the end of the same year in Orkney, and in 1266 Magnus\r\nIV., his successor, ceded the whole of the Scottish Islands held by\r\nNorway, except Orkney and Shetland, the Scottish king paying a small\r\nannual rent. Those of the islesmen who had proved unfaithful to the\r\nScottish king were most severely and cruelly punished.\r\n\r\nNo event of any importance appears to have occurred in the\r\nHighlands till the time of King Robert Bruce, who was attacked,\r\nafter his defeat at Methven, by Macdougall of Lorn, and defeated\r\nin Strathfillan. But Bruce was determined that Macdougall should\r\nnot long enjoy his petty triumph. Having been joined by his able\r\npartisan, Sir James Douglas, he entered the territory of Lorn. On\r\narriving at the narrow pass of Ben Cruachan, beween Loch Awe and Loch\r\nEtive, Bruce was informed that Macdougall had laid an ambuscade for\r\nhim. Bruce divided his army into two parts. One of these divisions,\r\nconsisting entirely of archers who were lightly armed, was placed\r\nunder the command of Douglas, who was directed to make a circuit\r\nround the mountain, and to attack the Highlanders in the rear.\r\nAs soon as Douglas had gained possession of the ground above the\r\nHighlanders, Bruce entered the pass, and, as soon as he had advanced\r\ninto its narrow gorge, he was attacked by the men of Lorn, who, from\r\nthe surrounding heights, hurled down stones upon him accompanied\r\nwith loud shouts. They then commenced a closer attack, but, being\r\ninstantly assailed in the rear by Douglas’s division, and assaulted\r\nby the king with great fury in front, they were thrown into complete\r\ndisorder, and defeated with great slaughter. Macdougall, who was,\r\nduring the action, on board a small vessel in Loch Etive, waiting the\r\nresult, took refuge in his castle of Dunstaffnage. After ravaging\r\nthe territory of Lorn, and giving it up to indiscriminate plunder,\r\nBruce laid siege to the castle, which, after a slight resistance, was\r\nsurrendered by the lord of Lorn, who swore homage to the king; but\r\nJohn, the son of the chief, refused to submit, and took refuge in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nDuring the civil wars among the competitors for the Scottish\r\ncrown, and those under Wallace and Bruce for the independence of\r\nScotland, the Highlanders scarcely ever appear as participators in\r\nthose stirring scenes which developed the resources, and called\r\nforth the chivalry of Scotland; but we are not to infer from the\r\nsilence of history that they were less alive than their southern\r\ncountrymen to the honour and glory of their country, or that they\r\ndid not contribute to secure its independence. General Stewart\r\nsays that eighteen Highland chiefs[128] fought under Robert Bruce\r\nat Bannockburn; and as these chiefs would be accompanied by their\r\nvassals, it is fair to suppose that Highland prowess lent its\r\npowerful aid to obtain that memorable victory which secured Scotland\r\nfrom the dominion of a foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nAfter Robert Bruce had asserted the independence of his country by\r\nthe decisive battle of Bannockburn, the whole kingdom, with the\r\nexception of some of the western islands, under John of Argyle, the\r\nally of England, submitted to his authority. He, therefore, undertook\r\nan expedition against those isles, in which he was accompanied by\r\nWalter, the hereditary high-steward of Scotland, his son-in-law,\r\nwho, by his marriage with Marjory, King Robert’s daughter, laid the\r\nfoundation of the Stewart dynasty. To avoid the necessity of doubling\r\nthe Mull of Kintyre, which was a dangerous attempt for the small\r\nvessels then in use, Robert sailed up Loch-Fyne to Tarbert with his\r\nfleet, which he dragged across the narrow isthmus between the lochs\r\nof East and West Tarbert, by means of a slide of smooth planks of\r\ntrees laid parallel to each other. It had long been a superstitious\r\nbelief amongst the inhabitants of the Western Islands, that they\r\nshould never be subdued till their invaders sailed across this neck\r\nof land, and it is said that Robert was thereby partly induced to\r\nfollow the course he did to impress upon the minds of the islanders\r\na conviction that the time of their subjugation had arrived. The\r\nislanders were quickly subdued, and John of Lorn, who, for his\r\nservices to Edward of England, had been invested with the title of\r\nAdmiral of the Western fleet of England, was captured and imprisoned\r\nfirst in Dumbarton castle, and afterwards in the castle of Loch\r\nLeven, where he died.\r\n\r\nThe feeble and effeminate reign of David II. was disturbed by another\r\nrevolt by the Lord of the Isles, who was backed in his attempt\r\nto throw off his dependence by a great number of the Highland\r\nchiefs. David, with “an unwonted energy of character, commanded the\r\nattendance of the steward, with the prelates and barons of the realm,\r\nand surrounded by this formidable body of vassals and retainers,\r\nproceeded against the rebels in person. The expedition was completely\r\nsuccessful. The rebel prince, John of the Isles, with a numerous\r\ntrain of those wild Highland chieftains who followed his banner, and\r\nhad supported him in his attempt to throw off his dependence, met\r\nthe king at Inverness, and submitted to his authority. He engaged\r\nin the most solemn manner, for himself and his vassals, that they\r\nshould yield themselves faithful and obedient subjects to David,\r\ntheir liege lord; and not only give due and prompt obedience to the\r\nministers and officers of the king in suit and service, as well as\r\nin the payment of taxes and public burdens, but that they would\r\ncoerce and put down all others, of whatever rank or degree, who\r\ndared to raise themselves in opposition to the royal authority, and\r\nwould compel them either to submit, or would pursue and banish them\r\nfrom their territories: for the fulfilment of which obligation the\r\nLord of the Isles not only gave his own oath, under the penalty of\r\nforfeiting his whole principality if it was broken, but offered the\r\nhigh-steward, his father-in-law, as his security, and delivered\r\nhis lawful son, Donald, his grandson, Angus, and his natural son,\r\nalso named Donald, as hostages for the strict performance of the\r\narticles of the treaty.”[129] The deed by which John of the Isles\r\nbound himself to the performance of these stipulations is dated 15th\r\nNovember, 1369.[130]\r\n\r\nTo enable him the better to succeed in reducing the inhabitants of\r\nthe Highlands and islands to the obedience of the laws, it is stated\r\nby an old historian,[131] that David used artifice by dividing the\r\nchiefs, and promising high rewards to those who should slay or\r\ncapture their brother chiefs. The writer says that this diabolical\r\nplan, by implanting the seeds of disunion and war amongst the\r\nchiefs, succeeded; and that they gradually destroyed one another,\r\na statement, to say the least of it, highly improbable. Certain it\r\nis, however, that it was in this reign that the practice of paying\r\n_manrent_ began, when the powerful wished for followers, and the weak\r\nwanted protection, a circumstance which shows that the government\r\nwas too weak to afford protection to the oppressed, or to quell the\r\ndisputes of rival clans.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1333,[132] John Monroe, the tutor of Foulis, in\r\ntravelling homeward, on his journey from Edinburgh to Ross, stopped\r\non a meadow in Stratherdale that he and his servants might get some\r\nrepose. While they were asleep, the owner of the meadow cut off the\r\ntails of their horses. Being resolved to wipe off this insult, he\r\nimmediately, on his return home to Ross, summoned his whole kinsmen\r\nand followers, and, after informing them how he had been used, craved\r\ntheir aid to revenge the injury. The clan, of course, complied;\r\nand, having selected 350 of the best and ablest men among them, he\r\nreturned to Stratherdale, which he wasted and spoiled; killed some of\r\nthe inhabitants, and carried off their cattle. In passing by the isle\r\nof Moy, on his return home, Macintosh, the chief of the clan Chattan,\r\nbeing urged by some person who bore Monroe a grudge, sent a message\r\nto him demanding a share of the spoil. This was customary among the\r\nHighlanders when a party drove cattle which had been so taken through\r\na gentleman’s land, and the part so exacted was called a _Staoig\r\nRathaid_, or _Staoig Creich_, that is, a Road Collop. Monroe, not\r\nbeing disposed to quarrel, offered Macintosh a reasonable share,\r\nbut this he was advised not to accept, and demanded the half of the\r\nbooty. Monroe refused to comply with such an unreasonable demand,\r\nand proceeded on his journey. Macintosh, determined to enforce\r\ncompliance, immediately collected his clansmen, and went in pursuit\r\nof Monroe, whom he overtook at Clach-na-Haire, near Inverness. As\r\nsoon as Monroe saw Macintosh approaching, he sent home five of his\r\nmen to Ferrindonald with the cattle, and prepared for action. But\r\nMacintosh paid dearly for his rapacity and rashness, for he and the\r\ngreater part of his men were killed in the conflict. Several of the\r\nMonroes also were slain, and John Monroe himself was left for dead in\r\nthe field of battle, and might have died if the predecessor of Lord\r\nLovat had not carried him to his house in the neighbourhood, where he\r\nwas cured of his wounds. One of his hands was so mutilated, that he\r\nlost the use of it the remainder of his life, on which account he was\r\nafterwards called John Bac-laimh, or Ciotach.[133]\r\n\r\nBesides the feuds of the clans in the reign of David II., the\r\nHighlands appear to have been disturbed by a formidable insurrection\r\nagainst the government, for, in a parliament which was held at Scone,\r\nin the year 1366, a resolution was entered into to seize the rebels\r\nin Argyle, Athole, Badenoch, Lochaber, and Ross, and all others who\r\nhad risen up against the royal authority, and to compel them to\r\nsubmit to the laws. The chief leaders in this commotion (of which\r\nthe bare mention in the parliamentary record is the only account\r\nwhich has reached us,) were the Earl of Ross, Hugh de Ross, John of\r\nthe Isles, John of Lorn, and John de Haye, who were all summoned to\r\nattend the parliament and give in their submission, but they all\r\nrefused to do so in the most decided manner; and as the government\r\nwas too weak to compel them, they were suffered to remain independent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1386, a feud having taken place between the clan Chattan\r\nand the Camerons, a battle took place in which a great number of\r\nthe clan Chattan were killed, and the Camerons were nearly cut off\r\nto a man. The occasion of the quarrel was as follows. The lands of\r\nMacintosh[134] in Lochaber, were possessed by the Camerons, who were\r\nso tardy in the payment of their rents that Macintosh was frequently\r\nobliged to levy them by force by carrying off his tenants’ cattle.\r\nThe Camerons were so irritated at having their cattle poinded and\r\ntaken away, that they resolved to make reprisals, preparatory to\r\nwhich they marched into Badenoch to the number of about 400 men,\r\nunder the command of Charles Macgilony. As soon as Macintosh became\r\nacquainted with this movement he called his clan and friends, the\r\nMacphersons and Davidsons, together. His force was superior to\r\nthat of the Camerons, but a dispute arose among the chiefs which\r\nalmost proved fatal to them. To Macintosh, as captain of the clan\r\nChattan, the command of the centre of the army was assigned with\r\nthe consent of all parties; but a difference took place between\r\nCluny and Invernahavon, each claiming the command of the right wing.\r\nCluny demanded it as the chief of the ancient clan Chattan, of which\r\nthe Davidsons of Invernahavon were only a branch; but Invernahavon\r\ncontended that to him, as the oldest branch, the command of the right\r\nwing belonged, according to the custom of the clans. The Camerons\r\ncame up during this quarrel about precedency, on which Macintosh,\r\nas umpire, decided against the claim of Cluny. This was a most\r\nimprudent award, as the Macphersons exceeded both the Macintoshes\r\nand Davidsons in numbers, and they were, besides, in the country\r\nof the Macphersons. These last were so offended at the decision of\r\nMacintosh that they withdrew from the field, and became, for a time,\r\nspectators of the action. The battle soon commenced, and was fought\r\nwith great obstinacy. Many of the Macintoshes, and almost all the\r\nDavidsons, were cut off by the superior number of the Camerons. The\r\nMacphersons seeing their friends and neighbours almost overpowered,\r\ncould no longer restrain themselves, and friendship got the better\r\nof their wounded pride. They, therefore, at this perilous crisis,\r\nrushed in upon the Camerons, who, from exhaustion and the loss they\r\nhad sustained, were easily defeated. The few that escaped, with their\r\nleader, were pursued from Invernahavon, the place of battle, three\r\nmiles above Ruthven, to Badenoch. Charles Macgilony was killed on a\r\nhill in Glenbenchir, which was long called Torr-Thearlaich, _i.e._,\r\nCharles’-hill.[136]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Shaw this quarrel about precedency was the origin\r\nof the celebrated judicial conflict, which took place on the North\r\nInch of Perth, before Robert III., his queen, Annabella Drummond, and\r\nthe Scottish nobility, and some foreigners of distinction, in the\r\nyear 1396, and of which a variety of accounts have been given by our\r\nancient historians. The parties to this combat were the Macphersons,\r\nproperly the clan Chattan, and the Davidsons of Invernahavon, called\r\nin the Gaelic _Clann-Dhaibhidh_. The Davidsons were not, as some\r\nwriters have supposed, a separate clan, but a branch of the clan\r\nChattan. These rival tribes had for a long period kept up a deadly\r\nenmity with one another, which was difficult to be restrained; but\r\nafter the award by Macintosh against the Macphersons, that enmity\r\nbroke out into open strife, and for ten years the Macphersons and the\r\nDavidsons carried on a war of extermination, and kept the country in\r\nan uproar.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to these disorders, it is said that Robert III. sent\r\nDunbar, Earl of Moray, and Lindsay of Glenesk, afterwards Earl of\r\nCrawford, two of the leading men of the kingdom, to endeavour to\r\neffect an amicable arrangement between the contending parties; but\r\nhaving failed in their attempt, they proposed that the differences\r\nshould be decided in open combat before the king. Tytler[137] is of\r\nopinion that, the notions of the Norman knights having by this time\r\nbecome familiar to the fierce mountaineers, they adopted the singular\r\nidea of deciding their quarrel by a combat of 30 against 30. Burton,\r\nhowever, with his usual sagacity, remarks that, “for a whole race to\r\nsubmit to the ordeal of battle would imply the very highest devotion\r\nto those rules of chivalry which were an extravagant fashion in all\r\nthe countries under the Norman influence, but were utterly unknown to\r\nthe Highlanders, who submitted when they must submit, and retaliated\r\nwhen they could. That such an adjustment could be effected among\r\nthem is about as incredible as a story about a parliamentary debate\r\nin Persia, or a jury trial in Timbuctoo.”[138] The beautiful and\r\nperfectly level meadow on the banks of the Tay at Perth, known as the\r\nNorth Inch, was fixed on, and the Monday before Michaelmas was the\r\nday appointed for the combat. According to Sir Robert Gordon, who is\r\nfollowed by Sir Robert Douglas and Mr. Mackintosh, it was agreed that\r\nno weapon but the broad sword was to be employed, but Wyntoun, who\r\nlived about the time, adds bows, battle-axes, and daggers.\r\n\r\n      “All thai entrit in Barreris,\r\n      With Bow and Axe, Knyf and Swerd,\r\n      To deal amang them thair last Werd.”\r\n\r\nThe numbers on each side have been variously reported. By mistaking\r\nthe word _triceni_, used by Boece and Buchanan, for _treceni_, some\r\nwriters have multiplied them to 300. Bower, the continuator of Fordun\r\nand Wyntoun, however, mentions expressly 60 in all, or 30 on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day the combatants made their appearance on the\r\nNorth Inch of Perth, to decide, in presence of the king, his queen,\r\nand a large concourse of the nobility, their respective claims to\r\nsuperiority. Barriers had been erected on the ground to prevent the\r\nspectators from encroaching, and the king and his party took their\r\nstations upon a platform from which they could easily view the\r\ncombat. At length the warriors, armed with sword and target, bows and\r\narrows, short knives and battle-axes, advanced within the barriers,\r\nand eyed one another with looks of deadly revenge. When about to\r\nengage, a circumstance occurred which postponed the battle, and had\r\nwell-nigh prevented it altogether. According to some accounts, one\r\nof the Macphersons fell sick; but Bower says, that when the troops\r\nhad been marshalled, one of the Macphersons, panic-struck, slipped\r\nthrough the crowd, plunged into the Tay and swam across, and, though\r\npursued by thousands, effected his escape. Sir Robert Gordon merely\r\nobserves, that, “at their entrie into the feild, the clan Chattan\r\nlacked one of their number, who wes privilie stolne away, not willing\r\nto be pertaker of so deir a bargane.” A man being now wanting on\r\none side, a pause ensued, and a proposal was made that one of the\r\nDavidsons should retire, that the number on both sides might be\r\nequal, but they refused. As the combat could not proceed from this\r\ninequality of numbers, the king was about to break up the assembly,\r\nwhen a diminutive and crooked, but fierce man, named Henry Wynd, a\r\nburgher of Perth, better known to readers of Scott as Hal o’ the\r\nWynd, and an armourer by trade, sprung within the barriers, and,\r\nas related by Bower, thus addressed the assembly: “Here am I. Will\r\nany one fee me to engage with these hirelings in this stage play?\r\nFor half a mark will I try the game, provided, if I escape alive,\r\nI have my board of one of you so long as I live. Greater love, as\r\nit is said, hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for\r\nhis friends. What, then, shall be my reward, who stake my life for\r\nthe foes of the commonwealth and realm?” This demand of _Gow Crom_,\r\n“Crooked Smith,” as Henry was familiarly styled, adds Bower, was\r\ngranted by the king and nobles. A murderous conflict now began. The\r\narmourer, bending his bow, and sending the first arrow among the\r\nopposite party, killed one of them. After showers of arrows had been\r\ndischarged on both sides, the combatants, with fury in their looks,\r\nand revenge in their hearts, rushed upon one another, and a terrific\r\nscene ensued, which appalled the heart of many a valorous knight who\r\nwitnessed the bloody tragedy. The violent thrusts of the daggers,\r\nand the tremendous gashes inflicted by the two-handed swords and\r\nbattle-axes, hastened the work of butchery and death. “Heads were\r\ncloven asunder, limbs were lopped from the trunk. The meadow was soon\r\nflooded with blood, and covered with dead and wounded men.”[139]\r\n\r\nAfter the crooked armourer had killed his man, as already related\r\nfrom Bower, it is said that he either sat down or drew aside, which\r\nbeing observed by the leader of Cluny’s band, he asked his reason\r\nfor thus stopping; on which Wynd said, “Because I have fulfilled my\r\nbargain, and earned my wages.”--“The man,” exclaimed the other, “who\r\nkeeps no reckoning of his good deeds, without reckoning shall be\r\nrepaid,” an observation which tempted the armourer to earn, in the\r\nmultiplied deaths of his opponents, a sum exceeding by as many times\r\nthe original stipulation. This speech of the leader has been formed\r\ninto the Gaelic adage,\r\n\r\n      “_Am fear nach cunntadh rium_\r\n      _Cha chunntainn ris_,”\r\n\r\nwhich Macintosh thus renders,\r\n\r\n      “The man that reckons not with me\r\n      I will not reckon with him.”\r\n\r\nVictory at last declared for the Macphersons, but not until 29 of\r\nthe Davidsons had fallen prostrate in the arms of death. Nineteen\r\nof Cluny’s men also bit the dust, and the remaining 11, with the\r\nexception of Henry Wynd, who by his excellence as a swordsman had\r\nmainly contributed to gain the day, were all grievously wounded. The\r\nsurvivor of the clan Davidson escaped unhurt. Mackintosh following\r\nBuchanan, relates that this man, after all his companions had fallen,\r\nthrew himself into the Tay, and making the opposite bank, escaped;\r\nbut this is most likely a new version of Bower’s account of the\r\naffrighted champion before the commencement of the action.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the clan Kay or Davidsons is called by Bower\r\n_Schea-beg_, and by Wyntoun, _Scha-Ferquharis son_, Boece calls\r\nhim _Strat-berge_. Who _Christi-Mac-Iain_, or _Christi-Jonson_ was\r\ngenealogically, we are not informed; but one thing is pretty clear,\r\nthat he, not _Schea-beg_, or _Shaw Oig_,--for these are obviously one\r\nand the same,--commanded the clan Chattan, or “_Clann-a-Chait_.”[140]\r\nBoth the principals seem to have been absent, or spectators merely\r\nof the battle; and as few of the leading men of the clan, it is\r\nbelieved, were parties in the combat, the savage policy of the\r\ngovernment, which, it is said, had taken this method to rid itself\r\nof the chief men of the clan, by making them destroy one another,\r\nwas completely defeated. This affair seems to have produced a good\r\neffect, as the Highlanders remained quiet for a considerable time\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effigy of “the Wolf of Badenoch” in Dunkeld Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nThe disorders in the Highlands occasioned by the feuds of the clans\r\nwere, about the period in question, greatly augmented by Alexander\r\nof Badenoch, fourth son of Robert II., whom he had constituted\r\nLieutenant or governor from the limits of Moray to the Pentland\r\nFrith. This person, from the ferocity of his disposition, obtained\r\nthe appropriate appellation of “the Wolf of Badenoch.” Avaricious\r\nas well as cruel, the Wolf seized upon the lands of Alexander Barr,\r\nbishop of Moray, and as he persisted in keeping violent possession of\r\nthem, he was excommunicated. The sentence of excommunication not only\r\nproved unavailing, but tended to exasperate the Lord of Badenoch to\r\nsuch a degree of fury that, in the month of May, 1390, he descended\r\nfrom his heights and burnt the town of Forres, with the choir of the\r\nchurch and the manse of the archdeacon. And in June following, he\r\nburnt the town of Elgin, the church of Saint Giles, the hospital of\r\nMaison-Dieu, and the cathedral, with eighteen houses of the canons\r\nand chaplains in the college of Elgin. He also plundered these\r\nchurches of their sacred utensils and vestments, which he carried\r\noff. For this horrible sacrilege the Lord of Badenoch was prosecuted,\r\nand obliged to make due reparation. Upon making his submission he was\r\nabsolved by Walter Trail, bishop of St. Andrews, in the church of\r\nthe Black Friars, in Perth. He was first received at the door, and\r\nafterwards before the high altar, in presence of the king (Robert\r\nIII. his brother,) and many of the nobility, on condition that he\r\nshould make full satisfaction to the bishop of Moray, and obtain\r\nabsolution from the pope.[141]\r\n\r\nThe Lord of Badenoch had a natural son, named Alexander Stewart,\r\nafterwards Earl of Mar, who inherited the vices of his father.\r\nBent upon spoliation and bloodshed, and resolved to imitate his\r\nfather’s barbarous exploits, he collected, in 1392, a vast number\r\nof caterans, armed only with the sword and target, and with these\r\nhe descended from the range of hills which divides the county of\r\nAberdeen and Forfar, devastated the country, and murdered the\r\ninhabitants indiscriminately. A force was instantly collected by Sir\r\nWalter Ogilvy, sheriff of Angus, Sir Patrick Gray, and Sir David\r\nLindsay of Glenesk, to oppose him, and although inferior in numbers,\r\nthey attacked Stewart and his party of freebooters at Gasklune,\r\nnear the water of Ila. A desperate conflict took place, which was\r\nof short duration. The caterans fought with determined bravery, and\r\nsoon overpowered their assailants. The sheriff, his brother, Wat of\r\nLichtoune, Young of Ouchterlony, the lairds of Cairncross, Forfar,\r\nand Guthry, and 60 of their followers, were slain. Sir Patrick\r\nGray and Sir David Lindsay were severely wounded, and escaped with\r\ndifficulty. Winton has preserved an anecdote illustrative of the\r\nfierceness of the Highlanders. Lindsay had run one of them, a strong\r\nand brawny man, through the body with a spear, and brought him to the\r\nearth; but although in the agonies of death, he writhed himself up,\r\nand with the spear sticking in his body, struck Lindsay a desperate\r\nblow with his sword, which cut him through the stirrup and boot into\r\nthe bone, on which he instantly fell and expired.[142]\r\n\r\nNicolas, Earl of Sutherland, had a feud with Y-Mackay of Far, in\r\nStrathnaver, chief of the Clan-wig-worgm, and his son Donald Mackay,\r\nin which many lives were lost, and great depredations committed\r\non both sides. In order to put an end to this difference, the\r\nEarl proposed a meeting of the parties at Dingwall, to be held in\r\npresence of the Lord of the Isles, his father-in-law, and some of the\r\nneighbouring gentry, the friends of the two families. The meeting\r\nhaving been agreed to, the parties met at the appointed time, in the\r\nyear 1395, and took up their residence in the castle of Dingwall in\r\napartments allotted for them. A discussion then took place between\r\nthe Earl and Mackay, regarding the points in controversy, in which\r\nhigh and reproachful words were exchanged, which so incensed the\r\nEarl, that he killed Mackay and his son with his own hands. Having\r\nwith some difficulty effected his escape from the followers and\r\nservants of the Mackays, he immediately returned home and prepared\r\nfor defence, but the Mackays were too weak to take revenge. The\r\nmatter was in some degree reconciled between Robert, the successor of\r\nNicolas, and Angus Mackay, the eldest son of Donald.[143]\r\n\r\nSome years after this event a serious conflict took place between\r\nthe inhabitants of Sutherland and Strathnaver, and Malcolm Macleod\r\nof the Lewis, which arose out of the following circumstances. Angus\r\nMackay above mentioned, had married a sister of Malcolm Macleod,\r\nby whom he had two sons, Angus Dow, and Roriegald. On the death of\r\nAngus, Houcheon Dow Mackay, a younger brother, became tutor to his\r\nnephews, and entered upon the management of their lands. Malcolm\r\nMacleod, understanding that his sister, the widow of Angus, was ill\r\ntreated by Houcheon Dow, went on a visit to her, accompanied by a\r\nnumber of the choicest men of his country, with the determination of\r\nvindicating her cause either by entreaty or by force. He appears not\r\nto have succeeded in his object, for he returned homeward greatly\r\ndiscontented, and in revenge laid waste Strathnaver and a great part\r\nof the Breachat in Sutherland, and carried off booty along with him.\r\nAs soon as Houcheon Dow and his brother Neill Mackay learnt this\r\nintelligence, they acquainted Robert, Earl of Sutherland, between\r\nwhom and Angus Mackay a reconciliation had been effected, who\r\nimmediately despatched Alexander Ne-Shrem-Gorme (Alexander Murray\r\nof Cubin,) with a number of stout and resolute men, to assist the\r\nMackays. They followed Macleod with great haste, and overtook him at\r\nTittim-Turwigh, upon the marches between Ross and Sutherland. The\r\npursuing party at first attempted to recover the goods and cattle\r\nwhich had been carried off, but this being opposed by Macleod and his\r\nmen, a desperate conflict ensued, in which great valour was displayed\r\non both sides. It “was long, furious, cruel, and doubtful,” says Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, and was “rather desperate than resolute.” At last the\r\nLewismen, with their commander, Malcolm Macleod, nick-named Gilealm\r\nBeg M’Bowen, were slain, and the goods and cattle were recovered.\r\nOne man alone of Macleod’s party, who was sorely wounded, escaped to\r\nbring home the sorrowful news to the Lewis, which he had scarcely\r\ndelivered when he expired.[144]\r\n\r\nThese feuds were followed by a formidable insurrection, or more\r\ncorrectly, invasion, in 1411, by Donald, Lord of the Isles, of such\r\na serious nature as to threaten a dismemberment of the kingdom\r\nof Scotland. The male succession to the earldom of Ross having\r\nbecome extinct, the honours of the peerage devolved upon a female,\r\nEuphemia Ross, wife of Sir Walter Lesley. Of this marriage there\r\nwere two children, Alexander, afterwards Earl of Ross, and Margaret,\r\nafterwards married to the Lord of the Isles. Earl Alexander married\r\na daughter of the Duke of Albany. Euphemia, Countess of Ross, was\r\nthe only issue of this marriage, but becoming a nun she resigned the\r\nearldom of Ross in favour of her uncle John Stewart, Earl of Buchan.\r\nThe Lord of the Isles conceiving that the countess, by renouncing\r\nthe world, had forfeited her title and estate, and, moreover, that\r\nshe had no right to dispose thereof, claimed both in right of\r\nMargaret his wife. The Duke of Albany, governor of Scotland, at whose\r\ninstigation the countess had made the renunciation, of course refused\r\nto sustain the claim of the prince of the islands. The Lord of the\r\nIsles having formed an alliance with England, whence he was to be\r\nsupplied with a fleet far superior to the Scottish, at the head of an\r\narmy of 10,000 men, fully equipped and armed after the fashion of\r\nthe islands with bows and arrows, pole-axes, knives, and swords, in\r\n1411 burst like a torrent upon the earldom, and carried everything\r\nbefore him. He, however, received a temporary check at Dingwall,\r\nwhere he was attacked with great impetuosity by Angus Dubh Mackay of\r\nFarr, or Black Angus, as he was called; but Angus was taken prisoner,\r\nand his brother Roderic Gald and many of his men were killed.\r\n\r\nFlushed with the progress he had made, Donald now resolved to\r\ncarry into execution a threat he had often made to burn the town\r\nof Aberdeen. For this purpose he ordered his army to assemble at\r\nInverness, and summoned all the men capable of bearing arms in the\r\nBoyne and the Enzie, to join his standard on his way south. This\r\norder being complied with, the Lord of the Isles marched through\r\nMoray without opposition. He committed great excesses in Strathbogie\r\nand in the district of Garioch, which belonged to the Earl of Mar.\r\nThe inhabitants of Aberdeen were in dreadful alarm at the near\r\napproach of this marauder and his fierce hordes; but their fears were\r\nallayed by the speedy appearance of a well-equipped army, commanded\r\nby the Earl of Mar, who bore a high military character, assisted by\r\nmany brave knights and gentlemen in Angus and the Mearns. Among these\r\nwere Sir Alexander Ogilvy, sheriff of Angus, Sir James Scrymgeour,\r\nconstable of Dundee and hereditary standard-bearer of Scotland,\r\nSir William de Abernethy of Salton, nephew to the Duke of Albany,\r\nSir Robert Maule of Panmure, Sir Alexander Irving of Drum, and Sir\r\nRobert Melville. The Earl was also joined by Sir Robert Davidson, the\r\nProvost of Aberdeen, and a party of the burgesses.\r\n\r\nAdvancing from Aberdeen, Mar marched by Inverury, and descried the\r\nHighlanders stationed at the village of Harlaw, on the water of Ury,\r\nnear its junction with the Don. Mar soon saw that he had to contend\r\nwith tremendous odds; but although his forces were, it is said, only\r\na tenth of those opposed to him, he resolved, from the confidence\r\nhe had in his steel-clad knights, to risk a battle. Having placed a\r\nsmall but select body of knights and men-at-arms in front, under the\r\ncommand of the constable of Dundee and the sheriff of Angus, the\r\nEarl drew up the main strength of his army in the rear, including\r\nthe Murrays, the Straitons, the Maules, the Irvings, the Lesleys,\r\nthe Lovels, the Stirlings, headed by their respective chiefs. The\r\nEarl then placed himself at the head of this body. At the head of\r\nthe Islesmen and Highlanders was the Lord of the Isles, subordinate\r\nto whom were Macintosh and Maclean and other Highland chiefs, all\r\nbearing the most deadly hatred to their Saxon foes, and panting for\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nOn a signal being given, the Highlanders and Islesmen, setting up\r\nthose terrific shouts and yells which they were accustomed to raise\r\non entering into battle, rushed forward upon their opponents; but\r\nthey were received with great firmness and bravery by the knights,\r\nwho, with their spears levelled, and battle-axes raised, cut down\r\nmany of their impetuous but badly armed adversaries. After the\r\nLowlanders had recovered themselves from the shock which the furious\r\nonset of the Highlanders had produced, Sir James Scrymgeour, at the\r\nhead of the knights and bannerets who fought under him, cut his way\r\nthrough the thick columns of the Islesmen, carrying death everywhere\r\naround him; but the slaughter of hundreds by this brave party did\r\nnot intimidate the Highlanders, who kept pouring in by thousands to\r\nsupply the place of those who had fallen. Surrounded on all sides,\r\nno alternative remained for Sir James and his valorous companions\r\nbut victory or death, and the latter was their lot. The constable of\r\nDundee was amongst the first who suffered, and his fall so encouraged\r\nthe Highlanders, that seizing and stabbing the horses, they thus\r\nunhorsed their riders, whom they despatched with their daggers. In\r\nthe meantime the Earl of Mar, who had penetrated with his main army\r\ninto the very heart of the enemy, kept up the unequal contest with\r\ngreat bravery, and, although he lost during the action almost the\r\nwhole of his army, he continued the fatal struggle with a handful\r\nof men till nightfall. The disastrous result of this battle was one\r\nof the greatest misfortunes which had ever happened to the numerous\r\nrespectable families in Angus and the Mearns. Many of these families\r\nlost not only their head, but every male in the house. Lesley of\r\nBalquhain is said to have fallen with six of his sons. Besides Sir\r\nJames Scrymgeour, Sir Alexander Ogilvy the sheriff of Angus, with\r\nhis eldest son George Ogilvy, Sir Thomas Murray, Sir Robert Maule\r\nof Panmure, Sir Alexander Irving of Drum, Sir William Abernethy\r\nof Salton, Sir Alexander Straiton of Lauriston, James Lovel, and\r\nAlexander Stirling, and Sir Robert Davidson, Provost of Aberdeen,\r\nwith 500 men-at-arms, including the principal gentry of Buchan, and\r\nthe greater part of the burgesses of Aberdeen who followed their\r\nProvost, were among the slain. The Highlanders left 900 men dead on\r\nthe field of battle, including the chiefs Maclean and Mackintosh.\r\nThis memorable battle was fought on the eve of the feast of St. James\r\nthe Apostle, July 25th, 1411. It was the final contest for supremacy\r\nbetween the Celt and the Teuton, and appears to have made at the time\r\nan inconceivably deep impression on the national mind. For more than\r\na hundred years, it is said, the battle of Harlaw continued to be\r\nfought over again by schoolboys in their play. “It fixed itself in\r\nthe music and the poetry of Scotland; a march, called the ‘Battle of\r\nHarlaw,’ continued to be a popular air down to the time of Drummond\r\nof Hawthornden, and a spirited ballad, on the same event, is still\r\nrepeated in our age, describing the meeting of the armies, and the\r\ndeaths of the chiefs, in no ignoble strain.”[145]\r\n\r\nMar and the few brave companions in arms who survived the battle,\r\npassed the night on the field; when morning dawned, they found that\r\nthe Lord of the Isles had retreated during the night, by Inverury\r\nand the hill of Benochy. To pursue him was impossible, and he was\r\ntherefore allowed to retire without molestation, and to recruit his\r\nexhausted strength.[146]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the disaster at Harlaw reached the ears of\r\nthe Duke of Albany, then regent of Scotland, he set about collecting\r\nan army, with which he marched in person to the north in autumn,\r\nwith a determination to bring the Lord of the Isles to obedience.\r\nHaving taken possession of the castle of Dingwall, he appointed a\r\ngovernor, and from thence proceeded to recover the whole of Ross.\r\nDonald retreated before him, and took up his winter-quarters in the\r\nislands. Hostilities were renewed next summer, but the contest was\r\nnot long or doubtful--notwithstanding some little advantages obtained\r\nby the King of the Isles--for he was compelled to give up his claim\r\nto the earldom of Ross, to become a vassal to the Scottish crown, and\r\nto deliver hostages to secure his future good behaviour. A treaty to\r\nthis effect was entered into at Pilgilbe or Polgillip, the modern\r\nLoch-Gilp, in Argyle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] Maclauchlan’s _Early Scottish Church_, pp. 346-7.\r\n\r\n[122] Book viii. ch. 6.\r\n\r\n[123] Shaw’s _Hist. of Moray_, new ed., pp. 259-60.\r\n\r\n[124] _Caledonia_, vol. i. p. 627.\r\n\r\n[125] “Whilst the lowlands and the coast of Moray, which had already\r\nbeen partitioned out among the followers of David, would have\r\npresented comparatively few obstacles to such a project, it is hardly\r\npossible to conceive how it could ever have been successfully put\r\ninto execution amidst the wild and inaccessible mountains of the\r\ninterior. It appears, therefore, most reasonable to conclude, that\r\nMalcolm only carried out the policy pursued by his grandfather ever\r\nsince the first forfeiture of the earldom; and that any changes\r\nthat may have been brought about in the population of this part of\r\nScotland--and which scarcely extended below the class of the lesser\r\n_Duchasach_, or small proprietors--are not to be attributed to one\r\nsweeping and compulsatory measure, but to the grants of David and\r\nhis successors; which must have had the effect of either reducing\r\nthe earlier proprietary to a dependant position, or of driving into\r\nthe remoter Highlands all who were inclined to contest the authority\r\nof the sovereign, or to dispute the validity of the royal ordinances\r\nwhich reduced them to the condition of subordinates.”--Robertson’s\r\n_Early Kings_, vol. i. p. 361.\r\n\r\n[126] Almost the same ceremonial of inauguration was observed at\r\nthe coronation of Macdonald, king of the Isles. Martin says, that\r\n“there was a big stone of seven feet square, in which there was a\r\ndeep impression made to receive the feet of Mack-Donald, for he was\r\ncrowned king of the Isles standing in this stone; and swore that he\r\nwould continue his vassals in the possession of their lands, and do\r\nexact justice to all his subjects; and then his father’s sword was\r\nput into his hands.

During\r\nthese contests for the Scottish crown, which succeeded the death of\r\nKing Alexander III., and favoured the pretensions of the King of\r\nthe Isles, the latter styling himself “King,” had, in 1291, sent\r\nhis nephew Angus Macintosh of Macintosh to Dougall Dall (Blind)\r\nMacGillichattan, chief of the clan Chattan, or Macphersons, to\r\nacquaint him that “_the king_” was to pay him a visit. Macpherson,\r\nor MacGillichattan, as he was named, in honour of the founder of the\r\nfamily Gillichattan[135] Mor, having an only child, a daughter, who,\r\nhe dreaded, might attract an inconvenient degree of royal notice,\r\noffered her in marriage to Macintosh along with his lands, and the\r\nstation of the chief of the clan Chattan.

Rapine, robbery, and an utter contempt\r\nof the laws prevailed to an alarming extent, which required all the\r\nenergy of a wise and prudent prince, like James, to repress. When\r\nthese excesses were first reported to James, by one of his nobles, on\r\nentering the kingdom, he thus expressed himself:--“Let God but grant\r\nme life, and there shall not be a spot in my dominions where the\r\nkey shall not keep the castle, and the furze-bush the cow, though I\r\nmyself should lead the life of a dog to accomplish it.”[147] “At this\r\nperiod, the condition of the Highlands, so far as is discoverable\r\nfrom the few authentic documents which have reached our times,\r\nappears to have been in the highest degree rude and uncivilized.\r\nThere existed a singular combination of Celtic and of feudal manners.\r\nPowerful chiefs, of Norman name and Norman blood, had penetrated\r\ninto the remotest districts, and ruled over multitudes of vassals\r\nand serfs, whose strange and uncouth appellatives proclaim their\r\ndifference of race in the most convincing manner.[148] The tenure of\r\nlands by charter and seisin, the feudal services due by the vassal to\r\nhis lord, the bands of friendship or of manrent which indissolubly\r\nunited certain chiefs and nobles to each other, the baronial courts,\r\nand the complicated official pomp of feudal life, were all to be\r\nfound in full strength and operation in the northern counties; but\r\nthe dependence of the barons, who had taken up their residence\r\nin these wild districts, upon the king, and their allegiance and\r\nsubordination to the laws, were less intimate and influential than in\r\nthe Lowland divisions of the country; and as they experienced less\r\nprotection, we have already seen, that in great public emergencies,\r\nwhen the captivity of the sovereign, or the payment of his ransom,\r\ncalled for the imposition of a tax upon property throughout the\r\nkingdom, these great northern chiefs thought themselves at liberty to\r\nresist the collection within their mountainous principalities.\r\n\r\n“Besides such Scoto-Norman barons, however, there were to be found in\r\nthe Highlands and Isles, those fierce aboriginal chiefs, who hated\r\nthe Saxon and the Norman race, and offered a mortal opposition to the\r\nsettlement of all intruders within a country which they considered\r\ntheir own. They exercised the same authority over the various clans\r\nor septs of which they were the chosen heads or leaders, which\r\nthe baron possessed over his vassals and military followers; and\r\nthe dreadful disputes and collisions which perpetually occurred\r\nbetween these distinct ranks of potentates, were accompanied by\r\nspoliations, ravages, imprisonments, and murders, which had at last\r\nbecome so frequent and so far extended, that the whole country\r\nbeyond the Grampian range was likely to be cut off, by these abuses,\r\nfrom all regular communication with the more pacific parts of the\r\nkingdom.”[149]\r\n\r\nHaving, by a firm and salutary, but perhaps severe, course of policy,\r\nrestored the empire of the laws in the Lowlands, and obtained the\r\nenactment of new statutes for the future welfare and prosperity\r\nof the kingdom, James next turned his attention to his Highland\r\ndominions, which, as we have seen, were in a deplorable state of\r\ninsubordination, that made both property and life insecure. The\r\nking determined to visit in person the disturbed districts, and\r\nby punishing the refractory chiefs, put an end to those tumults\r\nand enormities which had, during his minority, triumphed over the\r\nlaws. James, in the year 1427, arrived at Inverness, attended by\r\nhis parliament, and immediately summoned the principal chiefs there\r\nto appear before him. From whatever motives--whether from hopes of\r\neffecting a reconciliation by a ready compliance with the mandate\r\nof the king, or from a dread, in case of refusal, of the fate of\r\nthe powerful barons of the south who had fallen victims to James’s\r\nseverity--the order of the king was obeyed, and the chiefs repaired\r\nto Inverness. No sooner, however, had they entered the hall where the\r\nparliament was sitting, than they were by order of the king arrested,\r\nironed, and imprisoned in different apartments, and debarred all\r\ncommunication with each other, or with their followers. It has been\r\nsupposed that these chiefs may have been entrapped by some fair\r\npromises on the part of James, and the joy which, according to\r\nFordun, he manifested at seeing these turbulent and haughty spirits\r\ncaught in the toils which he had prepared for them, favours this\r\nconjecture. The number of chiefs seized on this occasion is stated\r\nto have amounted to about forty; but the names of the principal ones\r\nonly have been preserved. These were Alaster or Alexander Macdonald,\r\nLord of the Isles; Angus Dubh Mackay, with his four sons, who could\r\nbring into the field 4,000 fighting men; Kenneth More and his\r\nson-in-law, Angus of Moray, and Macmathan, who could muster 2,000\r\nmen; Alexander Macreiny of Garmoran and John Macarthur, each of whom\r\ncould bring into the field 1,000 followers. Besides these were John\r\nRoss, James Campbell, and William Lesley. The Countess of Ross, the\r\nmother of Alexander, the Lord of the Isles, and heiress of Sir Walter\r\nLesley, was also apprehended and imprisoned at the same time.[150]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James I.]\r\n\r\nThe king now determined to inflict summary vengeance upon his\r\ncaptives. Those who were most conspicuous for their crimes were\r\nimmediately executed; among whom were James Campbell, who was\r\ntried, convicted, and hanged for the murder of John of the Isles;\r\nand Alexander Macreiny and John Macarthur, who were beheaded.\r\nAlexander of the Isles and Angus Dubh, after a short confinement,\r\nwere both pardoned; but the latter was obliged to deliver up, as a\r\nhostage for his good behaviour, his son Neill, who was confined on\r\nthe Bass rock, and, from that circumstance, was afterwards named\r\nNeill-Wasse-Mackay.[151] Besides these, many others who were kept in\r\nprison in different parts of the kingdom, were afterwards condemned\r\nand executed.\r\n\r\nThe royal clemency, which had been extended so graciously to the\r\nLord of the Isles, met with an ungrateful return; for shortly after\r\nthe king had returned to his lowland dominions, Alexander collected\r\na force of ten thousand men in Ross and the Isles, and with this\r\nformidable body laid waste the country; plundered and devastated the\r\ncrown lands, against which his vengeance was chiefly directed, and\r\nrazed the royal burgh of Inverness to the ground. On hearing of these\r\ndistressing events, James, with a rapidity rarely equalled, collected\r\na force, the extent of which has not been ascertained, and marched\r\nwith great speed into Lochaber, where he found the enemy, who,\r\nfrom the celerity of his movements, was taken almost by surprise.\r\nAlexander prepared for battle; but, before its commencement, he had\r\nthe misfortune to witness the desertion of the clan Chattan, and\r\nthe clan Cameron, who, to a man, went over to the royal standard.\r\nThe king, thereupon, attacked Alexander’s army, which he completely\r\nrouted, and the latter sought safety in flight.\r\n\r\nReduced to the utmost distress, and seeing the impossibility of\r\nevading the active vigilance of his pursuers, who hunted him from\r\nplace to place, this haughty lord, who considered himself on a par\r\nwith kings, resolved to throw himself entirely on the mercy of the\r\nking, by an act of the most abject submission. Having arrived in\r\nEdinburgh, to which he had travelled in the most private manner,\r\nthe humbled chief suddenly presented himself before the king, on\r\nEaster-Sunday, in the church of Holyrood, when he and his queen,\r\nsurrounded by the nobles of the court, were employed in their\r\ndevotions before the high altar. The extraordinary appearance of\r\nthe fallen prince denoted the inward workings of his troubled\r\nmind. Without bonnet, arms, or ornament of any kind, his legs and\r\narms quite bare, his body covered with only a plaid, and holding\r\na naked sword in his hand by the point, he fell down on his knees\r\nbefore the king, imploring mercy and forgiveness, and, in token of\r\nhis unreserved submission, offered the hilt of his sword to his\r\nmajesty. At the solicitation of the queen and nobles, James spared\r\nhis life, but committed him immediately to Tantallan castle, under\r\nthe charge of William Earl of Angus, his nephew. This took place in\r\nthe year 1429. The Countess of Ross was kept in close confinement\r\nin the ancient monastery of Inchcolm, on the small island of that\r\nname, in the Frith of Forth.[152] The king, however, relented, and\r\nreleased the Lord of the Isles and his mother, after about a year’s\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nAbout this period happened another of those bloody frays, which\r\ndestroyed the internal peace of the Highlands, and brought ruin and\r\ndesolation upon many families. Thomas Macneill, son of Neill Mackay,\r\nwho was engaged in the battle of Tuttum Turwigh, possessed the lands\r\nof Creigh, Spaniziedaill, and Palrossie, in Sutherland. Having\r\nconceived some displeasure at Mowat, the laird of Freshwick, the\r\nlatter, with his party, in order to avoid his vengeance, took refuge\r\nin the chapel of St. Duffus, near the town of Tain, as a sanctuary.\r\nThither they were followed by Thomas, who not only slew Mowat and his\r\npeople, but also burnt the chapel to the ground. This outrage upon\r\nreligion and humanity exasperated the king, who immediately ordered\r\na proclamation to be issued, denouncing Thomas Macneill as a rebel,\r\nand promising his lands and possessions as a reward to any one that\r\nwould kill or apprehend him. Angus Murray, son of Alexander Murray\r\nof Cubin, immediately set about the apprehension of Thomas Macneill.\r\nTo accomplish his purpose, he held a secret conference with Morgan\r\nand Neill Macneill, the brothers of Thomas, at which he offered,\r\nprovided they would assist him in apprehending their brother, his\r\ntwo daughters in marriage, and promised to aid them in getting\r\npeaceable possession of such lands in Strathnaver as they claimed.\r\nThis, he showed them, might be easily accomplished, with little or no\r\nresistance, as Neill Mackay, son of Angus Dubh, from whom the chief\r\nopposition might have been expected, was then a prisoner in the Bass,\r\nand Angus Dubh, the father, was unable, from age and infirmity, to\r\ndefend his pretensions. Angus Murray also promised to request the\r\nassistance of the Earl of Sutherland. As these two brothers pretended\r\na right to the possessions of Angus Dubh in Strathnaver, they were\r\neasily allured by these promises; they immediately apprehended their\r\nbrother Thomas at Spaniziedaill in Sutherland, and delivered him\r\nup to Murray, by whom he was presented to the king. Macneill was\r\nimmediately executed at Inverness, and Angus Murray obtained, in\r\nterms of the royal proclamation, a grant of the lands of Palrossie\r\nand Spaniziedaill from the king. The lands of Creigh fell into the\r\nhands of the Lord of the Isles, as superior, by the death and felony\r\nof Macneill.[153]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACNEILL. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his promise, Murray gave his daughters in marriage\r\nrespectively to Neill and Morgan Macneill, and with the consent and\r\napprobation of Robert Earl of Sutherland, he invaded Strathnaver\r\nwith a party of Sutherland men, to take possession of the lands of\r\nAngus Dubh Mackay. Angus immediately collected his men, and gave the\r\ncommand of them to John Aberigh, his natural son, as he was unable to\r\nlead them in person. Both parties met about two miles from Toung, at\r\na place called Drum-ne-Coub; but, before they came to blows, Angus\r\nDubh Mackay sent a message to Neill and Morgan, his cousins-german,\r\noffering to surrender them all his lands and possessions in\r\nStrathnaver, if they would allow him to retain Keantayle. This fair\r\noffer was, however, rejected, and an appeal was therefore immediately\r\nmade to arms. A desperate conflict then took place, in which many\r\nwere killed on both sides; among whom were Angus Murray and his two\r\nsons-in-law, Neill and Morgan Macneill. John Aberigh, though he\r\ngained the victory, was severely wounded, and lost one of his arms.\r\nAfter the battle Angus Dubh Mackay was carried, at his own request,\r\nto the field, to search for the bodies of his slain cousins, but he\r\nwas killed by an arrow from a Sutherland man who lay concealed in a\r\nbush hard by.\r\n\r\nJames I. made many salutary regulations for putting an end to the\r\ndisorders consequent upon the lawless state of the Highlands, and the\r\noppressed looked up to him for protection. The following remarkable\r\ncase will give some idea of the extraordinary barbarity in which\r\nthe spoliators indulged:--A notorious thief, named Donald Ross, who\r\nhad made himself rich with plunder, carried off two cows from a\r\npoor woman. This woman having expressed a determination not to wear\r\nshoes again till she had made a complaint to the king in person, the\r\nrobber exclaimed, “It is false: I’ll have you shod before you reach\r\nthe court;” and thereupon, with a brutality scarcely paralleled, the\r\ncruel monster took two horse shoes, and fixed them on her feet with\r\nnails driven into the flesh. The victim of this savage act, as soon\r\nas she was able to travel, went to the king and related to him the\r\nwhole circumstances of her case, which so exasperated him, that he\r\nimmediately sent a warrant to the sheriff of the county, where Ross\r\nresided, for his immediate apprehension; which being effected, he and\r\na number of his associates were sent under an escort to Perth, where\r\nthe court was then held. Ross was tried and condemned, he and his\r\nfriends being treated in the same manner as he had treated the poor\r\nwoman; and before his execution a linen shirt, on which was painted a\r\nrepresentation of his crime, was thrown over him, in which dress he\r\nwas paraded through the streets of the town, afterwards dragged at a\r\nhorse’s tail, and hanged on a gallows.[154]\r\n\r\nThe commotions in Strathnaver, and other parts of the Highlands,\r\ninduced the king to make another expedition into that part of his\r\ndominions; previous to which he summoned a Parliament at Perth,\r\nwhich was held on the 15th of October, 1431, in which a land-tax,\r\nor “zelde,” was laid upon the whole lands of the kingdom, to defray\r\nthe expenses of the undertaking. No contemporary record of this\r\nexpedition exists; but it is said that the king proceeded to\r\nDunstaffnage castle, to punish those chiefs who had joined in Donald\r\nBalloch’s insurrection; that, on his arrival there, numbers of these\r\ncame to him and made their submission, throwing the whole odium\r\nof the rebellion upon the leader, whose authority, they alleged,\r\nthey were afraid to resist; and that, by their means, three hundred\r\nthieves were apprehended and put to death.\r\n\r\nFor several years after this expedition the Highlands appear to\r\nhave been tranquil; but, on the liberation of Neill Mackay from\r\nhis confinement on the Bass, in the year 1437, fresh disturbances\r\nbegan. This restless chief had scarcely been released, when he\r\nentered Caithness, and spoiled the country. He was met at a place\r\ncalled Sandsett; but the people who came to oppose his progress were\r\ndefeated, and many of them were slain. This conflict was called Ruaig\r\nHanset; that is, the flight, or chase at Sandsett.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a quarrel took place between the Keiths and some\r\nothers of the inhabitants of Caithness. As the Keiths could not\r\ndepend upon their own forces, they sought the aid of Angus Mackay,\r\nson of Neill last mentioned, who had recently died. Angus agreed\r\nto join the Keiths; and accordingly, accompanied by his brother,\r\nJohn Roy, and a chieftain named Iain-Mor-Mac-Iain-Riabhaich, with\r\na company of men, he went into Caithness, and, joining the Keiths,\r\ninvaded that part of Caithness hostile to the Keiths. The people\r\nof Caithness lost not a moment in assembling together, and met the\r\nStrathnaver men and the Keiths at a place called Blare-Tannie.\r\nHere a sanguinary contest took place; but victory declared for the\r\nKeiths, whose success, it is said, was chiefly owing to the prowess\r\nof Iain-Mor-Mac-Iain-Riabhaich, whose name was, in consequence, long\r\nfamous in that and the adjoining country.[155]\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of James, Earl of Douglas, who had renounced his\r\nallegiance to James II., at Arkinholme, in 1454, he retired into\r\nArgyleshire, where he was received by the Earl of Ross, with whom,\r\nand the Lord of the Isles, he entered into an alliance. The ocean\r\nprince, having a powerful fleet of 500 galleys at his command,\r\nimmediately assembled his vassals, to the amount of 5,000 fighting\r\nmen, and, having embarked them in his navy, gave the command of the\r\nwhole to Donald Balloch, Lord of Isla, his near kinsman, a chief\r\nwho, besides his possessions in Scotland, had great power in the\r\nnorth of Ireland. This potent chief, whose hereditary antipathy to\r\nthe Scottish throne was as keen as that of his relation, entered\r\ncheerfully into the views of Douglas. With the force under his\r\ncommand he desolated the western coast of Scotland from Innerkip to\r\nBute, the Cumbrays and the Island of Arran; yet formidable as he was\r\nboth in men and ships, the loss was not so considerable as might\r\nhave been expected, from the prudent precautions taken by the king\r\nto repel the invaders. The summary of the damage sustained is thus\r\nrelated in a contemporary chronicle:--“There was slain of good men\r\nfifteen; of women, two or three; of children, three or four. The\r\nplunder included five or six hundred horse, ten thousand oxen and\r\nkine, and more than a thousand sheep and goats. At the same time,\r\nthey burnt down several mansions in Innerkip around the church;\r\nharried all Arran; stormed and levelled with the ground the castle\r\nof Brodick; and wasted, with fire and sword, the islands of the\r\nCumbrays. They also levied tribute upon Bute; carrying away a hundred\r\nbolls of malt, a hundred marts, and a hundred marks of silver.”[156]\r\n\r\nWhile Donald Balloch was engaged in this expedition, the Lord of\r\nthe Isles, with his kinsmen and followers to the number of five or\r\nsix hundred, made an incursion into Sutherland, and encamped before\r\nthe castle of Skibo. What his object was has not been ascertained;\r\nbut, as a measure of precaution, the Earl of Sutherland sent Neill\r\nMurray, son of Angus Murray, who was slain at Drum-na-Coub, to watch\r\nhis motions. The Lord of the Isles immediately began to commit\r\ndepredations, whereupon he was attacked by Murray, and compelled\r\nto retreat into Ross with the loss of one of his captains, named\r\nDonald Dubh-na-Soirn, and fifty of his men. Exasperated at this\r\ndefeat, Macdonald sent another party of his islanders, along with a\r\ncompany of men from Ross, to Strathfleet in Sutherland to lay waste\r\nthe country, and thus wipe off the disgrace of his late defeat. On\r\nhearing of this fresh invasion, the Earl of Sutherland despatched\r\nhis brother Robert with a sufficient force to attack the Clandonald.\r\nThey met on the sands of Strathfleet, and, after a fierce and bloody\r\nstruggle, the islanders and their allies were overthrown with great\r\nslaughter. Many perished in the course of their flight. This was the\r\nlast hostile irruption of the Clandonald into Sutherland, as all the\r\ndisputes between the Lord of the Isles and the Sutherland family were\r\nafterwards accommodated by a matrimonial alliance.\r\n\r\nThe vigorous administration of James II., which checked and\r\ncontrolled the haughty and turbulent spirit of his nobles, was also\r\nfelt in the Highlands, where his power, if not always acknowledged,\r\nwas nevertheless dreaded; but upon the death of that wise prince in\r\n1460, and the accession of his infant son to the crown, the princes\r\nof the north again abandoned themselves to their lawless courses. The\r\nfirst who showed the example was Allan of Lorn of the Wood, as he was\r\ncalled, a nephew of Donald Balloch by his sister. Coveting the estate\r\nof his elder brother, Ker of Lorn, Allan imprisoned him in a dungeon\r\nin the island of Kerrera, with the view of starving him to death that\r\nhe might the more easily acquire the unjust possession he desired;\r\nbut Ker was liberated, and his property restored to him by the Earl\r\nof Argyle, to whom he was nearly related, and who suddenly attacked\r\nAllan with a fleet of galleys, defeated him, burnt his fleet, and\r\nslew the greater part of his men. This act, so justifiable in itself,\r\nroused the revengeful passions of the island chiefs, who issued from\r\ntheir ocean retreats and committed the most dreadful excesses.[157]\r\n\r\nAfter the decisive battle of Touton, Henry VI. and his Queen retired\r\nto Scotland to watch the first favourable opportunity of seizing the\r\nsceptre from the house of York. Edward IV., anticipating the danger\r\nthat might arise to his crown by an alliance between his rival, the\r\nexiled monarch, and the king of Scotland, determined to counteract\r\nthe effects of such a connection by a stroke of policy. Aware of\r\nthe disaffected disposition of some of the Scottish nobles, and\r\nnorthern and island chiefs, he immediately entered into a negotiation\r\nwith John, Earl of Ross, and Donald Balloch, to detach them from\r\ntheir allegiance. On the 19th of October, 1461, the Earl of Ross,\r\nDonald Balloch, and his son John de Isle, held a council of their\r\nvassals and dependants at Astornish, at which it was agreed to send\r\nambassadors to England to treat with Edward. On the arrival of these\r\nambassadors a negotiation was entered into between them and the Earl\r\nof Douglas, and John Douglas of Balveny, his brother, both of whom\r\nhad been obliged to leave Scotland for their treasons in the previous\r\nreign. These two brothers, who were animated by a spirit of hatred\r\nand revenge against the family of their late sovereign James II.,\r\nwarmly entered into the views of Edward, whose subjects they had\r\nbecome; and they concluded a treaty with the northern ambassadors\r\nwhich assumed as its basis nothing less than the entire conquest\r\nof Scotland. Among other conditions, it was stipulated that, upon\r\npayment of a specified sum of money to himself, his son, and ally,\r\nthe Lord of the Isles should become for ever the vassal of England,\r\nand should assist Edward and his successors in the wars in Ireland\r\nand elsewhere. And, in the event of the entire subjugation of\r\nScotland by the Earls of Ross and Douglas, the whole of the kingdom\r\non the north of the Frith of Forth was to be divided equally between\r\nthese Earls and Donald Balloch, and the estates which formerly\r\nbelonged to Douglas between the Frith of Forth and the borders were\r\nto be restored to him. This singular treaty is dated London, 18th\r\nFebruary, 1462.[158]\r\n\r\nPending this negotiation, the Earl of Angus, at that time one of the\r\nmost powerful of the Scottish nobles, having, by the promise of an\r\nEnglish dukedom from the exiled Henry, engaged to assist in restoring\r\nhim to his crown and dominions, the Earl of Ross, before the plan had\r\nbeen organized, in order to counteract the attempt, broke out into\r\nopen rebellion, which was characterized by all those circumstances\r\nof barbarous cruelty which distinguished the inroads of the princes\r\nof the islands. He first seized the castle of Inverness at the head\r\nof a small party, being admitted unawares by the governor, who did\r\nnot suspect his hostile intentions. He then collected a considerable\r\narmy, and proclaimed himself king of the Hebrides. With his army he\r\nentered the country of Athole, denounced the authority of the king,\r\nand commanded all taxes to be paid to him; and, after committing\r\nthe most dreadful excesses, he stormed the castle of Blair, dragged\r\nthe Earl and Countess of Athole from the chapel of St. Bridget, and\r\ncarried them off to Isla as prisoners. It is related that the Earl of\r\nRoss thrice attempted to set fire to the holy pile, but in vain. He\r\nlost many of his war-galleys, in a storm of thunder and lightning,\r\nin which the rich booty he had taken was consigned to the deep.\r\nPreparations were immediately made by the regents of the kingdom for\r\npunishing this rebellious chief; but these became unnecessary, for,\r\ntouched with remorse, he collected the remains of his plunder, and\r\nstripped to his shirt and drawers, and barefooted, he, along with his\r\nprincipal followers, in the same forlorn and dejected condition, went\r\nto the chapel of St. Bridget which they had lately desecrated, and\r\nthere performed a penance before the altar. The Earl and Countess of\r\nAthole were thereupon voluntarily released from confinement, and the\r\nEarl of Ross was afterwards assassinated in the castle of Inverness,\r\nby an Irish harper who bore him a grudge.[159]\r\n\r\nAlthough at this period an account of Orkney and Shetland does not\r\nproperly belong to a history of the Highlands, as these islands\r\nhad for long been the property of the king of Norway, and had a\r\npopulation almost purely Teutonic, with a language, manners, and\r\ncustoms widely differing from those of the Highlanders proper; still\r\nit will not be out of place to mention here, that these islands were\r\nfinally made over to Scotland in 1469, as security for the dowry of\r\nMargaret of Norway, the wife of James III.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the Lord of the Isles--who was generally more like\r\nan independent sovereign than a subject of the Scottish king--not\r\nbeing disposed to tender the allegiance which his father had\r\nviolated, the king, in the month of May, 1476, assembled a large\r\narmy on the north of the Forth, and a fleet on the west coast, for\r\nthe purpose of making a simultaneous attack upon him by sea and\r\nland. Seeing no hopes of making effectual resistance against such a\r\npowerful force as that sent against him, he tendered his submission\r\nto the king on certain conditions, and resigned the earldom of Ross,\r\nand the lands of Kintyre and Knapdale, into his majesty’s hands. By\r\nthis act he was restored to the king’s favour, who forgave him all\r\nhis offences, and “infeft him of new” in the lordship of the Isles\r\nand the other lands which he did not renounce. The Earl of Athole,\r\nwho commanded the royal army, was rewarded for this service by a\r\ngrant of the lands and forest of Cluny.[160]\r\n\r\nAfter the Lord of the Isles had thus resigned the earldom of Ross\r\ninto the king’s hands, that province was perpetually molested by\r\nincursions from the islanders, who now considered it a fit theatre\r\nfor the exercise of their predatory exploits. Gillespie, cousin of\r\nthe Lord of the Isles, at the head of a large body of the islanders,\r\ninvaded the higher part of Ross and committed great devastation. The\r\ninhabitants, or as many as the shortness of the time would permit,\r\namongst whom the Clankenzie were chiefly distinguished, speedily\r\nassembled, and met the islanders on the banks of the Connan, where\r\na sharp conflict took place. The Clankenzie fought with great\r\nvalour, and pressed the enemy so hard that Gillespie Macdonald was\r\noverthrown, and the greater part of his men were slain or drowned in\r\nthe river, about two miles from Braile, thence called Blar-na-Pairc.\r\nThe predecessor of the Laird of Brodie, who happened to be with the\r\nchief of the Mackenzies at the time, fought with great courage.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the district of Sutherland had remained\r\ntranquil, but on the 11th of July, 1487, it again became the scene\r\nof a bloody encounter between the Mackays and the Rosses. To revenge\r\nthe death of a relation, or to wipe away the stigma of a defeat,\r\nwere considered sacred and paramount duties by the Highlanders;\r\nand if, from the weakness of the clan, the minority of the chief,\r\nor any other cause, the day of deadly reckoning was delayed, the\r\nfeeling which prompted revenge was never dormant, and the earliest\r\nopportunity was embraced of vindicating the honour of the clan. Angus\r\nMackay, son of the famous Neill of the Bass, having been killed at\r\nTarbert by a Ross, his son, John Riabhaich Mackay, applied to John\r\nEarl of Sutherland, on whom he depended, to assist him in revenging\r\nhis father’s death. The Earl promised his aid, and accordingly sent\r\nhis uncle, Robert Sutherland, with a company of chosen men, to assist\r\nJohn Mackay. With this force, and such men as John Mackay and his\r\nrelation Uilleam-Dubh-Mac-Iain-Abaraich, son of John Aberigh who\r\nfought at Drum-na-Coub, could collect, they invaded Strath-oy-kell,\r\ncarrying fire and sword in their course, and laying waste many lands\r\nbelonging to the Rosses. As soon as the Laird of Balnagown, the chief\r\nof the Rosses, heard of this attack, he collected all his forces,\r\nand attacked Robert Sutherland and John Riabhaich Mackay, at a place\r\ncalled Aldv-charrish. A long and obstinate battle took place; but the\r\ndeath of Balnagown and seventeen of the principal landed gentlemen of\r\nRoss decided the combat, for the people of Ross, being deprived of\r\ntheir leader, were thrown into confusion, and utterly put to flight,\r\nwith great slaughter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSS. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this victory was a large quantity of booty, which the\r\nvictors divided the same day; but the avarice of the men of Assynt,\r\ninduced them to instigate John Mackay to resolve to commit one of the\r\nmost perfidious and diabolical acts ever perpetrated by men who had\r\nfought on the same side. The design of the Assynt men was, to cut\r\noff Robert Sutherland and his whole party, and possess themselves of\r\ntheir share of the spoil, before the Earl of Sutherland could learn\r\nthe result of the battle, that he might be led to suppose that his\r\nuncle and his men had all fallen in the action with the Rosses. When\r\nthis plan was divulged to Uilleam-Dubh-Mac-Iain-Abaraich, he was\r\nhorrified at it, and immediately sent notice to Robert Sutherland of\r\nit, that he might be upon his guard. Robert assembled his men upon\r\nreceipt of this extraordinary intelligence, told them of the base\r\nintentions of John Mackay, and put them in order, to be prepared for\r\nthe threatened attack; but on John Riabhaich Mackay perceiving that\r\nRobert and his party were prepared to meet him, he slunk off, and\r\nwent home to Strathnaver.[161]\r\n\r\nThe lawless state of society in the Highlands, which followed as\r\na consequence from the removal of the seat of government to the\r\nLowlands, though it often engaged the attention of the Scottish\r\nsovereigns, never had proper remedies applied to mend it. At one time\r\nthe aid of force was called in, and when that was found ineffectual,\r\nthe vicious principle of dividing the chiefs, that they might the\r\nmore effectually weaken and destroy one another, was adopted. Both\r\nplans, as might be supposed, proved abortive. If the government had,\r\nby conciliatory measures, and by a profusion of favours, suitable\r\nto the spirit of the times, secured the attachment of the heads of\r\nthe clans, the supremacy of the laws might have been vindicated, and\r\nthe sovereign might have calculated upon the support of powerful\r\nand trustworthy auxiliaries in his domestic struggles against the\r\nencroachments of the nobles. Such ideas appear never to have once\r\nentered the minds of the kings, but it was reserved for James IV.,\r\nwho succeeded to the throne in 1488, to make the experiment. “To\r\nattach to his interest the principal chiefs of these provinces, to\r\noverawe and subdue the petty princes who affected independence, to\r\ncarry into their territories, hitherto too exclusively governed by\r\ntheir own capricious or tyrannical institutions, the same system of a\r\nsevere, but regular and rapid, administration of civil and criminal\r\njustice, which had been established in his Lowland dominions, was\r\nthe laudable object of the king; and for this purpose he succeeded,\r\nwith that energy and activity which remarkably distinguished him,\r\nin opening up an intercourse with many of the leading men in the\r\nnorthern counties. With the captain of the Clanchattan, Duncan\r\nMackintosh; with Ewan, the son of Alan, captain of the Clancameron;\r\nwith Campbell of Glenurqhay; the Macgilleouns of Duart and Lochbuy;\r\nMackane of Ardnamurchan; the lairds of Mackenzie and Grant; and\r\nthe Earl of Huntley, a baron of the most extensive power in those\r\nnorthern districts--he appears to have been in habits of constant\r\nand regular communication--rewarding them by presents, in the shape\r\neither of money or of grants of land, and securing their services\r\nin reducing to obedience such of their fellow chieftains as proved\r\ncontumacious, or actually rose in rebellion.”[162]\r\n\r\nBut James carried his views further. Rightly judging how much the\r\npersonal presence of the sovereign would be valued by his distant\r\nsubjects, and the good effects which would result therefrom, he\r\nresolved to visit different parts of his northern dominions.\r\nAccordingly, in the year 1490, accompanied by his court, he rode\r\ntwice from Perth across the chain of mountains which extends across\r\nthe country from the border of the Mearns to the head of Loch\r\nRannoch, which chain is known by the name of the “Mount.” Again, in\r\n1493, he twice visited the Highlands, and went as far as Dunstaffnage\r\nand Mengarry, in Ardnamurchan. In the following year he visited the\r\nisles no less than three times. His first voyage to the islands,\r\nwhich took place in April and May, was conducted with great state.\r\nHe was attended by a vast suite, many of whom fitted out vessels at\r\ntheir own expense. The grandeur which surrounded the king impressed\r\nthe islanders with a high idea of his wealth and power; and his\r\ncondescension and familiarity with all classes of his subjects,\r\nacquired for him a popularity which added strength to his throne.\r\nDuring these marine excursions the youthful monarch indulged his\r\npassion for sailing and hunting, and thereby relieved the tediousness\r\nof business by the recreation of agreeable and innocent pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe only opposition which James met with during these excursions was\r\nfrom the restless Lord of the Isles, who had the temerity to put the\r\nking at defiance, notwithstanding the repeated and signal marks of\r\nthe royal favour he had experienced. But James was not to be trifled\r\nwith, for he summoned the island prince to stand his trial for\r\n“treason in Kintyre;” and in a parliament held in Edinburgh shortly\r\nafter the king’s return from the north, “Sir John of the Isles,” as\r\nhe is named in the treasurer’s accounts, was stripped of his power,\r\nand his possessions were forfeited to the crown.\r\n\r\nOne of those personal petty feuds which were so prevalent in the\r\nHighlands, occurred about this time. Alexander Sutherland of Dilred,\r\nbeing unable or unwilling to repay a sum of money he had borrowed\r\nfrom Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, the latter took legal measures to\r\nsecure his debt by appraising part of Dilred’s lands. This proceeding\r\nvexed the laird of Dilred exceedingly, and he took an umbrage at the\r\nDunbars, who had recently settled in Sutherland, “grudgeing, as it\r\nwere,” says Sir R. Gordon, “that a stranger should brawe (brave) him\r\nat his owne doors.” Happening to meet Alexander Dunbar, brother of\r\nSir James, who had lately married Lady Margaret Baillie, Countess\r\nDowager of Sutherland, high words passed between them, a combat\r\nensued, and, after a long contest, Alexander Dunbar was killed. Sir\r\nJames Dunbar thereupon went to Edinburgh, and laid the matter before\r\nKing James IV., who was so exasperated at the conduct of Alexander\r\nSutherland, that he immediately proclaimed him a rebel, sent\r\nmessengers everywhere in search of him, and promised his lands to any\r\nperson that would apprehend him. After some search he was apprehended\r\nwith ten of his followers by his uncle, Y-Roy-Mackay, brother of John\r\nReawigh Mackay already mentioned, who sent him to the king. Dilred\r\nwas tried, condemned, and executed, and his lands declared forfeited.\r\nFor this service, Y-Roy-Mackay obtained from the king a grant of\r\nthe lands of Armdall, Far, Golspietour, Kinnald, Kilcolmkill, and\r\nDilred, which formerly belonged to Alexander Sutherland, as was\r\nnoted in Mackay’s infeftment, dated in 1449.[163] “Avarice,” says\r\nSir R. Gordon, “is a strange vyce, which respects neither blood nor\r\nfreindship. This is the first infeftment that any of the familie of\r\nMacky had from the king, so far as I can perceave by the records\r\nof this kingdom; and they wer untill this tyme possessors onlie of\r\nther lands in Strathnaver, not careing much for any charters or\r\ninfeftments, as most pairts of the Highlanders have alwise done.”\r\n\r\nThe grant of the king as to the lands over which Sir James Dunbar’s\r\nsecurity extended, was called in question by Sir James, who obtained\r\na decree before the lords of council and session, in February, 1512,\r\nsetting aside the right of Y-Roy-Mackay, and ordaining the Earl of\r\nSutherland, as superior of the lands, to receive Sir James Dunbar as\r\nhis vassal.\r\n\r\nA lamentable instance of the ferocity of these times is afforded in\r\nthe case of one of the Earls of Sutherland, who upon some provocation\r\nslew two of his nephews. This earl, who was named John, had a natural\r\nbrother, Thomas Moir, who had two sons, Robert Sutherland and the\r\nKeith, so called on account of his being brought up by a person of\r\nthat name. The young men had often annoyed the Earl, and on one\r\noccasion they entered his castle of Dunrobin to brave him to his\r\nface, an act which so provoked the Earl, that he instantly killed\r\nRobert in the house. The Keith, after receiving several wounds,\r\nmade his escape, but he was overtaken and slain at the Clayside,\r\nnear Dunrobin, which from that circumstance was afterwards called\r\nAilein-Cheith, or the bush of the Keith.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 a troop of Highlanders helped to swell the Scotch army on\r\nthe ever-memorable and disastrous field of Flodden, but from their\r\npeculiar mode of fighting, so different from that of the Lowlanders,\r\nappear to have been more a hindrance than a help.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 511.\r\n\r\n[148] MS.

The better to secure the goodwill and assistance of the Earl\r\nof Caithness, Earl Adam made a grant of some lands upon the east side\r\nof the water of Ully; but the Earl of Caithness, although he kept\r\npossession of the lands, joined the foes of his ally and friend. The\r\nEarl of Sutherland, however, would have found a more trustworthy\r\nsupporter in the person of Y-Roy-Mackay, who had come under a\r\nwritten obligation to serve him the same year; but Mackay died,\r\nand a contest immediately ensued in Strathnaver, between John and\r\nDonald Mackay his bastard sons, and Neill-Naverigh Mackay, brother\r\nof Y-Roy, to obtain possession of his lands. John took possession\r\nof all the lands belonging to his father in Strathnaver; but his\r\nuncle Neill laid claim to them, and applied to the Earl of Caithness\r\nfor assistance to recover them. The Earl, after many entreaties,\r\nput a force under the command of Neill and his two sons, with which\r\nthey entered Strathnaver, and obtaining an accession of strength\r\nin that country, they dispossessed John Mackay, who immediately\r\nwent to the clan Chattan and clan Kenzie, to crave their aid and\r\nsupport, leaving his brother Donald Mackay to defend himself in\r\nStrathnaver as he best could. Donald not having a sufficient force\r\nto meet his uncle and cousins in open combat, had recourse to a\r\nstratagem which succeeded entirely to his mind. With his little band\r\nhe, under cloud of night, surprised his opponents at Delreavigh in\r\nStrathnaver, and slew both his cousins and the greater part of their\r\nmen, and thus utterly destroyed the issue of Neill. John Mackay,\r\non hearing of this, immediately joined his brother, and drove out\r\nof Strathnaver all persons who had favoured the pretensions of his\r\nuncle Neill-Naverigh. This unfortunate old man, after being abandoned\r\nby the Earl of Caithness, threw himself upon the generosity of\r\nhis nephews, requesting that they would merely allow him a small\r\nmaintenance to keep him from poverty during the remainder of his\r\nlife; but these unnatural relatives, regardless of mercy and the ties\r\nof blood, ordered Neill to be beheaded in their presence by the hands\r\nof Claff-na-Gep, his own foster brother.[164]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1517, advantage was taken by John Mackay of the absence\r\nof the Earl of Sutherland, who had gone to Edinburgh to transact\r\nsome business connected with his estates, to invade the province of\r\nSutherland, and to burn and spoil every thing which came in his way.\r\nHe was assisted in this lawless enterprise by two races of people\r\ndwelling in Sutherland, called the Siol-Phaill, and the Siol-Thomais,\r\nand by Neil-Mac-Iain-Mac-Angus of Assynt, and his brother John\r\nMor-Mac-Iain, with some of their countrymen. As soon as the Countess\r\nof Sutherland, who had remained at home, heard of this invasion, she\r\nprevailed upon Alexander Sutherland, her bastard brother, to oppose\r\nMackay. Assisted chiefly by John Murray of Aberscors, and Uilleam\r\nMac-Sheumais-Mhic-Chruner, chief of the clan Gun in Sutherland,\r\nAlexander convened hastily the inhabitants of the country and went in\r\nsearch of the enemy. He met John Mackay and his brother Donald, at a\r\nplace called Torran-Dubh or Cnocan-Dubh, near Rogart in Strathfleet.\r\nMackay’s force was prodigious, for he had assembled not only the\r\nwhole strength of Strathnaver, Durines, Edderachillis, and Assynt,\r\nwith the Siol-Phaill and Siol-Thomais; but also all the disorderly\r\nand idle men of the whole diocese of Caithness, with all such as\r\nhe could entice to join him from the west and north-west isles,\r\nto accompany him in his expedition, buoyed up with the hopes of\r\nplunder. But the people of Sutherland were nowise dismayed at the\r\nappearance of this formidable host, and made preparations for an\r\nattack. A desperate struggle commenced, and after a long contest,\r\nMackay’s vanguard was driven back upon the position occupied by\r\nhimself. Mackay having rallied the retreating party, selected a\r\nnumber of the best and ablest men he could find, and having placed\r\nthe remainder of his army under the command of his brother Donald,\r\nto act as a reserve in case of necessity, he made a furious attack\r\nupon the Sutherland men, who received the enemy with great coolness\r\nand intrepidity. The chiefs on both sides encouraged their men to\r\nfight for the honour of their clans, and in consequence the fight was\r\nsevere and bloody; but in the end the Sutherland men, after great\r\nslaughter, and after prodigies of valour had been displayed by both\r\nparties, obtained the victory. Mackay’s party was almost entirely cut\r\noff, and Mackay himself escaped with difficulty. The victors next\r\nturned their attention to the reserve under the command of Donald\r\nMackay; but Donald dreading the fate of his brother, fled along with\r\nhis party, which immediately dispersed. They were, however, closely\r\npursued by John Murray and Uilleam Mac-Sheumais, till the darkness of\r\nthe night prevented the pursuit. In this battle, two hundred of the\r\nStrathnaver men, thirty-two of the Siol-Phaill, and fifteen of the\r\nSiol-Thomais, besides many of the Assynt men, and their commander,\r\nNiall-Mac-Iain-Mac-Aonghais, a valiant chieftain, were slain. John\r\nMor-Mac-Iain, the brother of this chief, escaped with his life after\r\nreceiving many wounds. Of the Sutherland men, thirty-eight only were\r\nslain. Sir Robert Gordon says that this “was the greatest conflict\r\nthat hitherto hes been fought in between the inhabitants of these\r\ncuntreyes, or within the diocy of Catteynes, to our knowlege.”[165]\r\n\r\nShortly after the battle of Torran-Dubh, Uilleam Mac-Sheumais, called\r\nCattigh, chief of the clan Gun, killed George Keith of Aikregell with\r\nhis son and twelve of their followers, at Drummoy, in Sutherland,\r\nas they were travelling from Inverugie to Caithness. This act was\r\ncommitted by Mac-Sheumais to revenge the slaughter of his grandfather\r\n(the Cruner,) who had been slain by the Keiths, under the following\r\ncircumstances. A long feud had existed between the Keiths and the\r\nclan Gun, to reconcile which, a meeting was appointed at the chapel\r\nof St. Tayr in Caithness, near Girnigoe, of twelve horsemen on each\r\nside. The Cruner, then chief of the clan Gun, with some of his sons\r\nand his principal kinsmen, to the number of twelve in all, came to\r\nthe chapel at the appointed time. As soon as they arrived, they\r\nentered the chapel and prostrated themselves in prayer before the\r\naltar. While employed in this devotional act, the laird of Inverugie\r\nand Aikregell arrived with twelve horses, and two men on each horse.\r\nAfter dismounting, the whole of this party rushed into the chapel\r\narmed, and attacked the Cruner and his party unawares. The Clan Gun,\r\nhowever, defended themselves with great intrepidity, and although the\r\nwhole twelve were slain, many of the Keiths were also killed. For\r\nnearly two centuries the blood of the slain was to be seen on the\r\nwalls of the chapel, which it had stained. James Gun, one of the sons\r\nof the Cruner, being absent, immediately on hearing of his father’s\r\ndeath, retired with his family into Sutherland, where he settled, and\r\nwhere his son William Mac-Sheumais, or Mac-James otherwise William\r\nCattigh, was born.\r\n\r\nAs John Mackay imputed his defeat at Torran-Dubh mainly to John\r\nMurray of Aberscors, he resolved to take the first convenient\r\nopportunity of revenging himself, and wiping off the disgrace of\r\nhis discomfiture. He, therefore, not being in a condition himself\r\nto undertake an expedition, employed two brothers, William and\r\nDonald, his kinsmen, chieftains of the Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, with\r\na company of men, to attack Murray. The latter having mustered his\r\nforces, the parties met at a place called Loch-Salchie, not far from\r\nthe Torran-Dubh, where a sharp skirmish took place, in which Murray\r\nproved victorious. The two Strathnaver chieftains and the greater\r\npart of their men were slain, and the remainder were put to flight.\r\nThe principal person who fell on Murray’s side was his brother\r\nJohn-Roy, whose loss he deeply deplored.\r\n\r\nExasperated at this second disaster, John Mackay sent John Croy and\r\nDonald, two of his nephews, sons of Angus Mackay, who was killed at\r\nMorinsh in Ross, at the head of a number of chosen men, to plunder\r\nand burn the town of Pitfour, in Strathfleet, which belonged to John\r\nMurray; but they were equally unsuccessful, for John Croy Mackay\r\nand some of his men were slain by the Murrays, and Donald was taken\r\nprisoner. In consequence of these repeated reverses, John Mackay\r\nsubmitted himself to the Earl of Sutherland on his return from\r\nEdinburgh, and granted him his bond of service, in the year 1518.\r\nBut, notwithstanding this submission, Mackay afterwards tampered with\r\nAlexander Sutherland, the bastard, and having gained his favour by\r\ngiving his sister to Sutherland in marriage, he prevailed upon him\r\nto rise against the Earl of Sutherland. All these commotions in the\r\nnorth happened during the minority of King James V., when, as Sir R.\r\nGordon says, “everie man thought to escape unpunished, and cheiflie\r\nthese who were remotest from the seat of justice.”[166]\r\n\r\nThis Alexander Sutherland was son of John, the third of that name,\r\nEarl of Sutherland, and as he pretended that the Earl and his mother\r\nhad entered into a contract of marriage, he laid claim, on the death\r\nof the Earl, to the title and estates, as a legitimate descendant\r\nof Earl John, his father. By the entreaties of Adam Gordon, Lord of\r\nAboyne, who had married Lady Elizabeth, the sister and sole heiress\r\nof Earl John, Alexander Sutherland judicially renounced his claim\r\nin presence of the sheriff of Inverness, on the 25th of July, 1509.\r\nHe now repented of what he had done, and, being instigated by the\r\nEarl of Caithness and John Mackay, mortal foes to the house of\r\nSutherland, he renewed his pretensions. Earl Adam, perceiving that\r\nhe might incur some danger in making an appeal to arms, particularly\r\nas the clans and tribes of the country, with many of whom Alexander\r\nhad become very popular, were broken into factions and much divided\r\non the question betwixt the two, endeavoured to win him over by\r\noffering him many favourable conditions, again to renounce his\r\nclaims, but in vain. He maintained the legitimacy of his descent, and\r\nalleged that the renunciation he had granted at Inverness had been\r\nobtained from him contrary to his inclination, and against the advice\r\nof his best friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Dunrobin Castle.]\r\n\r\nHaving collected a considerable force, he, in absence of the earl,\r\nwho was in Strathbogie, attacked Dunrobin castle, the chief strength\r\nof the earl, which he took. In this siege he was chiefly supported\r\nby Alexander Terrell of the Doill, who, in consequence of taking\r\narms against the earl, his superior, lost all his lands, and was\r\nafterwards apprehended and executed. As soon as the earl heard of\r\nthe insurrection, he despatched Alexander Lesley of Kinninuvy, with\r\na body of men, into Sutherland to assist John Murray of Aberscors,\r\nwho was already at the head of a force to support the earl. They\r\nimmediately besieged Dunrobin, which surrendered. Alexander had\r\nretired to Strathnaver, but he again returned into Sutherland with a\r\nfresh body of men, and laid waste the country. After putting to death\r\nseveral of his own kinsmen who had joined the earl, he descended\r\nfarther into the country, towards the parishes of Loth and Clyne.\r\nMeeting with little or no opposition, the bastard grew careless,\r\nand being observed wandering along the Sutherland coast, flushed\r\nwith success and regardless of danger, the earl formed the design\r\nof cutting him entirely off. With this view, he directed Alexander\r\nLesley of Kinninuvy, John Murray, and John Scorrigh-Mac-Finlay, one\r\nof the Siol-Thomais, to hover on Sutherland’s outskirts, and to keep\r\nskirmishing with him till he, the earl, should collect a sufficient\r\nforce with which to attack him. Having collected a considerable body\r\nof resolute men, the earl attacked the bastard at a place called\r\nAld-Quhillin, by East Clentredaill, near the sea side. A warm contest\r\nensued, in which Alexander Sutherland was taken prisoner, and the\r\nmost of his men were slain, including John Bane, one of his principal\r\nsupporters, who fell by the hands of John Scorrigh-Mac-Finlay. After\r\nthe battle Sutherland was immediately beheaded by Alexander Lesley on\r\nthe spot, and his head sent to Dunrobin on a spear, which was placed\r\nupon the top of the great tower, “which shews us” (as Sir Robert\r\nGordon, following the superstition of his times, curiously observes),\r\n“that whatsoever by fate is allotted, though sometymes forshewed, can\r\nnever be avoyded. For the witches had told Alexander the bastard that\r\nhis head should be the highest that ever wes of the Southerlands;\r\nwhich he did foolishlye interpret that some day he should be Earl\r\nof Southerland, and in honor above all his predicessors. Thus the\r\ndivell and his ministers, the witches, deceaving still such as trust\r\nin them, will either find or frame predictions for everie action or\r\nevent, which doeth ever fall out contrarie to ther expectations; a\r\nkynd of people to all men unfaithfull, to hopers deceatful, and in\r\nall cuntries allwise forbidden, allwise reteaned and manteaned.”[167]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Sutherland being now far advanced in life, retired for\r\nthe most part to Strathbogy and Aboyne, to spend the remainder\r\nof his days amongst his friends, and intrusted the charge of the\r\ncountry to Alexander Gordon, his eldest son, a young man of great\r\nintrepidity and talent. The restless chief John Mackay, still\r\nsmarting under his misfortunes, and thirsting for revenge, thought\r\nthe present a favourable opportunity for retrieving his losses.\r\nWith a considerable force, therefore, he invaded Sutherland, and\r\nentered the parish of Creigh, which he intended to ravage, but\r\nthe Master of Sutherland hastened thither, attacked Mackay, and\r\nforced him to retreat into Strathnaver with some loss. Mackay then\r\nassembled a large body of his countrymen and invaded the Breachat.\r\nHe was again defeated by Alexander Gordon at the Grinds after a keen\r\nskirmish. Hitherto Mackay had been allowed to hold the lands of\r\nGrinds, and some other possessions in the west part of Sutherland,\r\nbut the Master of Sutherland now dispossessed him of all these as\r\na punishment for his recent conduct. Still dreading a renewal of\r\nMackay’s visits, the Master of Sutherland resolved to retaliate, by\r\ninvading Strathnaver in return, and thereby showing Mackay what he\r\nmight in future expect if he persevered in continuing his visits to\r\nSutherland. Accordingly, he collected a body of stout and resolute\r\nmen, and entered Strathnaver, which he pillaged and burnt, and,\r\nhaving collected a large quantity of booty, returned into Sutherland.\r\nIn entering Strathnaver, the Master of Sutherland had taken the road\r\nto Strathully, passing through Mackay’s bounds in the hope of falling\r\nin with and apprehending him, but Mackay was absent on a _creach_\r\nexcursion into Sutherland. In returning, however, through the Diric\r\nMoor and the Breachat, Alexander Gordon received intelligence that\r\nMackay with a company of men was in the town of Lairg, with a\r\nquantity of cattle he had collected in Sutherland, on his way home to\r\nStrathnaver. He lost no time in attacking Mackay, and such was the\r\ncelerity of his motions, that his attack was as sudden as unexpected.\r\nMackay made the best resistance he could, but was put to the rout,\r\nand many of his men were killed. He himself made his escape with\r\ngreat difficulty, and saved his life by swimming to the island of\r\nEilean-Minric, near Lairg, where he lay concealed during the rest of\r\nthe day. All the cattle which Mackay had carried away were rescued\r\nand carried back into Sutherland. The following day Mackay left the\r\nisland, returned home to his country, and again submitted himself to\r\nthe Master and his father, the Earl, to whom he a second time gave\r\nhis bond of service and manrent in the year 1522.[168]\r\n\r\nAs the Earl of Caithness had always taken a side against the\r\nSutherland family in these different quarrels, the Earl of Sutherland\r\nbrought an action before the Lords of Council and Session against the\r\nEarl of Caithness, to recover back from him the lands of Strathully,\r\non the ground, that the Earl of Caithness had not fulfilled the\r\ncondition on which the lands were granted to him, viz., to assist the\r\nEarl of Sutherland against his enemies. There were other minor points\r\nof dispute between the earls, to get all which determined they both\r\nrepaired to Edinburgh. Instead, however, of abiding the issue of a\r\ntrial at law before the judges, both parties, by the advice of mutual\r\nfriends, referred the decision of all the points in dispute on either\r\nside to Gavin Dunbar,[169] bishop of Aberdeen, who pronounced his\r\naward at Edinburgh, on the 11th March, 1524, his judgment appearing\r\nto have satisfied both parties, as the earls lived in peace with one\r\nanother ever after.\r\n\r\nThe year 1526 was signalized by a great dissension among the clan\r\nChattan. The chief and head of that clan was Lauchlan Macintosh\r\nof Dunnachtan, “a verrie honest and wyse gentleman,” says Bishop\r\nLesley, “an barroun of gude rent, quha keipit hes hole ken, friendes\r\nand tennentis in honest and guid rewll;”[170] and according to Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, “a man of great possessions, and of such excellencies\r\nof witt and judgement, that with great commendation he did conteyn\r\nall his followers within the limits of ther dueties.”[171] The\r\nstrictness with which this worthy chief curbed the lawless and\r\nturbulent dispositions of his clan raised up many enemies, who, as\r\nBishop Lesley says, were “impacient of vertuous living.” At the\r\nhead of this restless party was James Malcolmeson, a near kinsman\r\nof the chief, who, instigated by his worthless companions, and\r\nthe temptation of ruling the clan, murdered the good chief. Afraid\r\nto face the well-disposed part of the clan, to whom the chief was\r\nbeloved, Malcolmeson, along with his followers, took refuge in the\r\nisland in the loch of Rothiemurchus; but the enraged clan followed\r\nthem to their hiding places and despatched them.\r\n\r\nAs the son of the deceased chief was of tender age, and unable to\r\ngovern the clan, with common consent they made choice of Hector\r\nMacintosh, a bastard brother of the late chief, to act as captain\r\ntill his nephew should arrive at manhood. In the meantime the Earl\r\nof Moray, who was uncle to young Macintosh, the former chief having\r\nbeen married to the earl’s sister, took away his nephew and placed\r\nhim under the care of his friends for the benefit of his education,\r\nand to bring him up virtuously. Hector Macintosh was greatly incensed\r\nat the removal of the child, and used every effort to get possession\r\nof him; but meeting with a refusal he became outrageous, and laid\r\nso many plans for accomplishing his object, that his intentions\r\nbecame suspected, as it was thought he could not wish so ardently\r\nfor the custody of the child without some bad design. Baffled in\r\nevery attempt, Hector, assisted by his brother William, collected\r\na body of followers, and invaded the Earl of Moray’s lands. They\r\noverthrew the fort of Dykes, and besieged the castle of Tarnoway, the\r\ncountry surrounding which they plundered, burnt the houses of the\r\ninhabitants, and slew a number of men, women, and children. Raising\r\nthe siege of Tarnoway, Hector and his men then entered the country of\r\nthe Ogilvies and laid siege to the castle of Pettens, which belonged\r\nto the Laird of Durnens, one of the families of the Ogilvies, and\r\nwhich, after some resistance, surrendered. No less than twenty-four\r\ngentlemen of the name of Ogilvie were massacred on this occasion.\r\nAfter this event the Macintoshes and the party of banditti they had\r\ncollected, roamed over the whole of the adjoining country, carrying\r\nterror and dismay into every bosom, and plundering, burning, and\r\ndestroying everything within their reach. To repress disorders which\r\ncalled so loudly for redress, King James V., by the advice of his\r\ncouncil, granted a commission to the Earl of Moray to take measures\r\naccordingly. Having a considerable force put under his command, the\r\nearl went in pursuit of Macintosh and his party, and having surprised\r\nthem, he took upwards of 300 of them[172] and hanged them, along\r\nwith William Macintosh, the brother of Hector. A singular instance\r\nof the fidelity of the Highlanders to their chiefs is afforded in\r\nthe present case, where, out of such a vast number as suffered, not\r\none would reveal the secret of Hector Macintosh’s retreat, although\r\npromised their lives for the discovery. “Ther faith wes so true to\r\nther captane, that they culd not be persuaded, either by fair meanes,\r\nor by any terror of death, to break the same or to betray their\r\nmaster.”[173]\r\n\r\nSeeing no hopes of escaping the royal vengeance but by a ready\r\nsubmission, Hector Macintosh, by advice of Alexander Dunbar, Dean\r\nof Moray, tendered his obedience to the king, which was accepted,\r\nand he was received into the royal favour. He did not, however,\r\nlong survive, for he was assassinated in St. Andrews by one James\r\nSpence, who was in consequence beheaded. After the death of Hector,\r\nthe clan Chattan remained tranquil during the remaining years of the\r\nminority of the young chief, who, according to Bishop Lesley, “wes\r\nsua well brocht up by the meenes of the Erle of Murray and the Laird\r\nof Phindlater in vertue, honestie, and civile policye, that after\r\nhe had received the governement of his cuntrey, he was a mirrour of\r\nvertue to all the hieland captanis in Scotland.”[174] But the young\r\nchieftain’s “honestie and civile policye” not suiting the ideas of\r\nthose who had concurred in the murder of his father, a conspiracy was\r\nformed against him by some of his nearest kinsmen to deprive him of\r\nhis life, which unfortunately took effect.\r\n\r\nThe Highlands now enjoyed repose for some years. John Mackay died in\r\n1529, and was succeeded by his brother Donald, who remained quiet\r\nduring the life of Adam Earl of Sutherland, to whom his brother had\r\ntwice granted his bond of service. But, upon the death of that\r\nnobleman, he began to molest the inhabitants of Sutherland. In 1542\r\nhe attacked the village of Knockartol, which he burnt; and at the\r\nsame time he plundered Strathbroray. To oppose his farther progress,\r\nSir Hugh Kennedy collected as many of the inhabitants of Sutherland\r\nas the shortness of the time would permit, and, being accompanied by\r\nGilbert Gordon of Gartay, John Murray of Aberscors, his son Hutcheon\r\nMurray, and Mac-Mhic-Sheumais of Killiernan, he attacked Mackay\r\nquite unawares near Alt-Na-Beth. Notwithstanding this unexpected\r\nattack, Mackay’s men met their assailants with great firmness, but\r\nthe Strathnaver men were ultimately obliged to retreat with the loss\r\nof their booty and a great number of slain, amongst whom was John\r\nMackean-Mac-Angus, chief of Sliochd-Mhic-Iain-Mhic-Hutcheon, in\r\nEdderachillis. Though closely pressed by Gilbert Gordon and Hutcheon\r\nMurray, Donald Mackay made good his retreat into Strathnaver.\r\n\r\nBy no means disheartened at his defeat, and anxious to blot out the\r\nstain which it had thrown upon him, he soon returned into Sutherland\r\nwith a fresh force, and encamped near Skibo. Hutcheon Murray\r\ncollected some Sutherland men, and with them he attacked Mackay, and\r\nkept him in check till an additional force which he expected should\r\narrive. As soon as Mackay saw this new body of men approaching, with\r\nwhich he was quite unable to contend, he retreated suddenly into\r\nhis own country, leaving several of his men dead on the field. This\r\naffair was called the skirmish of Loch-Buy. This mode of annoyance,\r\nwhich continued for some time, was put an end to by the apprehension\r\nof Donald Mackay, who, being brought before the Earls of Huntly and\r\nSutherland, was, by their command, committed a close prisoner to the\r\ncastle of Foulis, where he remained a considerable time in captivity.\r\nAt last, by means of Donald Mac-Iain-Mhoir, a Strathnaver man, he\r\neffected his escape, and, returning home, reconciled himself with the\r\nEarl of Sutherland, to whom he gave his bond of service and manrent,\r\non the 8th of April, 1549.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of James V. some respect was paid in the Highlands\r\nto the laws; but the divisions which fell out amongst the nobility,\r\nthe unquiet state of the nation during the minority of the infant\r\nqueen, and the wars with England, relaxed the springs of government,\r\nand the consequence was that the usual scenes of turbulence and\r\noppression soon displayed themselves in the Highlands, accompanied\r\nwith all those circumstances of ferocity which rendered them so\r\nrevolting to humanity. The Clanranald was particularly active in\r\nthese lawless proceedings. This clan bore great enmity to Hugh,\r\nLord Lovat; and because Ranald, son of Donald Glass of Moidart,\r\nwas sister’s son of Lovat, they conceived a prejudice against him,\r\ndispossessed him of his lands, and put John Macranald, his cousin,\r\nin possession of the estate. Lovat took up the cause of his nephew,\r\nand restored him to the possession of his property; but the restless\r\nclan dispossessed Ranald again, and laid waste part of Lovat’s lands\r\nin Glenelg. These disorders did not escape the notice of the Earl of\r\nArran, the governor of the kingdom, who, by advice of his council,\r\ngranted a special commission to the Earl of Huntly, making him\r\nlieutenant-general of all the Highlands, and of Orkney and Zetland.\r\nHe also appointed the Earl of Argyle lieutenant of Argyle and the\r\nIsles. The Earl of Huntly lost no time in raising a large army in\r\nthe north, with which he marched, in May, 1544, attended by the\r\nMacintoshes, Grants, and Frasers, against the clan Cameron and the\r\nclan Ranald, and the people of Moydart and Knoydart, whose principal\r\ncaptains were Ewen Allenson, Ronald M’Coneilglas, and John Moydart.\r\nThese had wasted and plundered the whole country of Urquhart and\r\nGlenmorriston, belonging to the Laird of Grant, and the country of\r\nAbertarf, Strathglass, and others, the property of Lord Lovat. They\r\nhad also taken absolute possession of these different territories\r\nas their own properties, which they intended to possess and enjoy\r\nin all time coming. But, by the mediation of the Earl of Argyle,\r\nthey immediately dislodged themselves upon the Earl of Huntly’s\r\nappearance, and retired to their own territories in the west.\r\n\r\nIn returning to his own country, Lovat was accompanied by the\r\nGrants and Macintoshes as far as Gloy, afterwards called the\r\nNine-Mile-Water, and they even offered to escort him home in case of\r\ndanger; but, having no apprehensions, he declined, and they returned\r\nhome by Badenoch. This was a fatal error on the part of Lovat, for,\r\nas soon as he arrived at Letterfinlay, he was informed that the\r\nClanranald were at hand, in full march, to intercept him. To secure\r\nan important pass, he despatched Iain-Cleireach, one of his principal\r\nofficers, with 50 men; but, from some cause or other, Iain-Cleireach\r\ndid not accomplish his object; and, as soon as Lovat came to the\r\nnorth end of Loch Lochy, he perceived the Clanranald descending the\r\nhill from the west, to the number of about 500, divided into seven\r\ncompanies. Lovat was thus placed in a position in which he could\r\nneither refuse nor avoid battle. The day (3d July) being extremely\r\nhot, Lovat’s men, who amounted to about 300, stript to the shirts,\r\nfrom which circumstance the battle was called _Blar-Nan-Leine_,\r\n_i.e._, the Field of Shirts. A sort of skirmish at first took place,\r\nfirst with bows and arrows, which lasted a considerable time, until\r\nboth sides had expended their shafts. The combatants then drew\r\ntheir swords, and rushed in true Highland fashion on each other,\r\nwith fierce and deadly intent. The slaughter was tremendous, and\r\nfew escaped on either side. Lord Lovat, with 300 of the surname of\r\nFraser, and other followers, were left dead on the field. Lovat’s\r\neldest son, a youth of great accomplishments, who had received his\r\neducation in France, whence he had lately arrived, was mortally\r\nwounded, and taken prisoner. He died within three days. Great as was\r\nthe loss on the side of the Frasers, that on the opposite side was\r\ncomparatively still greater. According to a tradition handed down,\r\nonly four of the Frasers and ten of the Clanranald remained alive.\r\nThe darkness of the night alone put an end to the combat. This was\r\nan unfortunate blow to the clan Fraser, which, tradition says, would\r\nhave been almost entirely annihilated but for the happy circumstance\r\nthat the wives of eighty of the Frasers who were slain were pregnant\r\nat the time, and were each of them afterwards delivered of a male\r\nchild.[175]\r\n\r\nAs soon as intelligence of this disaster was brought to the Earl of\r\nHuntly, he again returned with an army, entered Lochaber, which he\r\nlaid waste, and apprehended many of the leading men of the hostile\r\ntribes, whom he put to death.\r\n\r\nThe great power conferred on the Earl of Huntly, as\r\nlieutenant-general in the north of Scotland, and the promptitude\r\nand severity with which he put down the insurrections of some of\r\nthe chiefs alluded to, raised up many enemies against him. As he in\r\ncompany with the Earl of Sutherland was about to proceed to France\r\nfor the purpose of conveying the queen regent to that country, in\r\nthe year 1550, a conspiracy was formed against him, at the head of\r\nwhich was Macintosh, chief of the clan Chattan. This conspiracy\r\nbeing discovered to the earl, he ordered Macintosh to be immediately\r\napprehended and brought to Strathbogie, where he was beheaded in the\r\nmonth of August of that year. His lands were also forfeited at the\r\nsame time. This summary proceeding excited the sympathy and roused\r\nthe indignation of the friends of the deceased chief, particularly\r\nof the Earl of Cassilis. A commotion was about to ensue, but matters\r\nwere adjusted for a time, by the prudence of the queen regent, who\r\nrecalled the act of forfeiture and restored Macintosh’s heir to all\r\nhis father’s lands. But the clan Chattan were determined to avail\r\nthemselves of the first favourable opportunity of being revenged\r\nupon the earl, which they, therefore, anxiously looked for. As\r\nLauchlan Macintosh, a near kinsman of the chief, was suspected of\r\nhaving betrayed his chief to the earl, the clan entered his castle of\r\nPettie by stealth, slew him, and banished all his dependants from the\r\ncountry of the clan.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the province of Sutherland again became the scene\r\nof some commotions. The earl having occasion to leave home, intrusted\r\nthe government of the country to Alexander Gordon, his brother, who\r\nruled it with great justice and severity; but the people, disliking\r\nthe restraints put upon them by Alexander, created a tumult, and\r\nplaced John Sutherland, son of Alexander Sutherland, the bastard,\r\nat their head. Seizing the favourable opportunity, as it appeared\r\nto them, when Alexander Gordon was attending divine service in\r\nthe church at Golspikirktoun, they proceeded to attack him, but\r\nreceiving notice of their intentions, he collected the little company\r\nhe had about him, and went out of church resolutely to meet them.\r\nAlarmed at seeing him and his party approach, the people immediately\r\ndispersed and returned every man to his own house. But William\r\nMurray, son of Caen Murray, one of the family of Pulrossie, indignant\r\nat the affront offered to Alexander Gordon, shortly afterwards killed\r\nJohn Sutherland upon the Nether Green of Dunrobin, in revenge for\r\nwhich murder William Murray was himself thereafter slain by the Laird\r\nof Clyne.\r\n\r\nThe Mackays also took advantage of the Earl of Sutherland’s absence,\r\nto plunder and lay waste the country. Y-Mackay, son of Donald,\r\nassembled the Strathnaver men and entered Sutherland, but Alexander\r\nGordon forced him back into Strathnaver, and not content with acting\r\non the defensive, he entered Mackay’s country, which he wasted, and\r\ncarried off a large booty in goods and cattle, in the year 1551.\r\nMackay, in his turn, retaliated, and this system of mutual aggression\r\nand spoliation continued for several years.[176]\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the Earl of Huntly in France, John of Moydart,\r\nchief of the Clanranald, returned from the isles and recommenced his\r\nusual course of rapine. The queen regent, on her return from France,\r\nbeing invested with full authority, sent the Earl of Huntly on an\r\nexpedition to the north, for the purpose of apprehending Clanranald\r\nand putting an end to his outrages. The earl having mustered a\r\nconsiderable force, chiefly Highlanders of the clan Chattan, passed\r\ninto Moydart and Knoydart, but his operations were paralyzed by\r\ndisputes in his camp. The chief and his men having abandoned their\r\nown country, the earl proposed to pursue them in their retreats\r\namong the fastnesses of the Highlands; but his principal officers,\r\nwho were chiefly from the Lowlands, unaccustomed to such a mode of\r\nwarfare in such a country, demurred; and as the earl was afraid to\r\nentrust himself with the clan Chattan, who owed him a deep grudge\r\non account of the execution of their last chief, he abandoned the\r\nenterprise and returned to the low country. Sir Robert Gordon says\r\nthat the failure of the expedition was owing to a tumult raised in\r\nthe earl’s camp by the clan Chattan, who returned home; but we are\r\nrather disposed to consider Bishop Lesley’s account, which we have\r\nfollowed, as the more correct.[177]\r\n\r\nThe failure of this expedition gave great offence to the queen,\r\nwho, instigated it is supposed by Huntly’s enemies, attributed it\r\nto negligence on his part. The consequence was, that the earl was\r\ncommitted a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh in the month of\r\nOctober, where he remained till the month of March following. He\r\nwas compelled to renounce the earldom of Moray and the lordship of\r\nAbernethy, with his tacks and possessions in Orkney and Zetland, and\r\nthe tacks of the lands of the earldom of Mar and of the lordship of\r\nStrathdie, of which he was bailie and steward, and he was moreover\r\ncondemned to a banishment of five years in France. But as he was\r\nabout to leave the kingdom, the queen, taking a more favourable view\r\nof his conduct, recalled the sentence of banishment, and restored him\r\nto the office of chancellor, of which he had been deprived; and to\r\nmake this act of leniency somewhat palatable to the earl’s enemies,\r\nthe queen exacted a heavy pecuniary fine from the earl.\r\n\r\nThe great disorders which prevailed in the Highlands at this time,\r\ninduced the queen-regent to undertake a journey thither in order to\r\npunish these breaches of the law, and to repress existing tumults.\r\nShe accordingly arrived at Inverness in the month of July, 1555,\r\nwhere she was met by John, Earl of Sutherland, and George, Earl of\r\nCaithness. Although the latter nobleman was requested to bring his\r\ncountrymen along with him to the court, he neglected or declined\r\nto do so, and he was therefore committed to prison at Inverness,\r\nAberdeen, and Edinburgh, successively, and he was not restored to\r\nliberty till he paid a considerable sum of money. Y-Mackay of Far was\r\nalso summoned to appear before the queen at Inverness, to answer for\r\nhis spoliations committed in the country of Sutherland during the\r\nabsence of Earl John in France; but he refused to appear. Whereupon\r\nthe queen granted a commission to the Earl of Sutherland, to bring\r\nMackay to justice. The earl accordingly entered Strathnaver with\r\na great force, sacking and spoiling every thing in his way, and\r\npossessing himself of all the principal positions to prevent Mackay’s\r\nescape. Mackay, however, avoided the earl, and as he declined to\r\nfight, the earl laid siege to the castle of Borwe, the principal\r\nstrength in Strathnaver, scarcely two miles distant from Far, which\r\nhe took after a short siege, and hanged Ruaridh-Mac-Iain-Mhoir, the\r\ncommander. This fort the earl completely demolished.\r\n\r\nWhile the Earl of Sutherland was engaged in the siege, Mackay\r\nentered Sutherland secretly, and burnt the church of Loth. He\r\nthereafter went to the village of Knockartol, where he met\r\nMackenzie and his countrymen in Strathbroray. A slight skirmish\r\ntook place between them; but Mackay and his men fled after he had\r\nlost Angus-Mackeanvoir, one of his commanders, and several of\r\nhis followers. Mackenzie was thereupon appointed by the earl to\r\nprotect Sutherland from the incursions of Mackay during his stay in\r\nStrathnaver. Having been defeated again by Mackenzie, and seeing no\r\nchance of escape, Mackay surrendered himself, and was carried south,\r\nand committed a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh, in which he\r\nremained a considerable time. During the queen’s stay in the north\r\nmany notorious delinquents were brought to trial, condemned and\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nDuring Mackay’s detention in Edinburgh, John Mor-Mackay, who took\r\ncharge of his kinsman’s estate, seizing the opportunity of the Earl\r\nof Sutherland’s absence in the south of Scotland, entered Sutherland\r\nat the head of a determined body of Strathnaver men, and spoiled\r\nand wasted the east corner of that province, and burnt the chapel\r\nof St. Ninian. Mac-Mhic-Sheumais, chief of the Clan-Gun, the Laird\r\nof Clyne, the Terrell of the Doill, and James Mac-William, having\r\ncollected a body of Sutherland men, pursued the Strathnaver men, whom\r\nthey overtook at the foot of the hill called Ben-Moir, in Berridell.\r\nHere they laid an ambush for them, and having, by favour of a fog,\r\npassed their sentinels, they unexpectedly surprised Mackay’s men,\r\nand attacked them with great fury. The Strathnaver men made an\r\nobstinate resistance, but were at length overpowered. Many of them\r\nwere killed, and others drowned in the water of Garwary. Mackay\r\nhimself escaped with great difficulty. This was one of the severest\r\ndefeats the Strathnaver men ever experienced, except at the battle of\r\nKnoken-dow-Reywird.\r\n\r\nOn the release of Mackay from his confinement in the castle of\r\nEdinburgh, he was employed in the wars upon the borders, against\r\nthe English, in which he acquitted himself courageously; and on\r\nhis return to Strathnaver he submitted himself to the Earl of\r\nSutherland, with whom he lived in peace during the remainder of\r\nthe earl’s life. But Mackay incurred the just displeasure of the\r\ntribe of Slaight-ean-Voir by the committal of two crimes of the\r\ndeepest dye. Having imbibed a violent affection for the wife of\r\nTormaid-Mac-Iain-Mhoir, the chieftain of that tribe, he, in order to\r\naccomplish his object, slew the chief, after which he violated his\r\nwife, by whom he had a son called Donald Balloch Mackay. The insulted\r\nclan flew to arms; but they were defeated at Durines, by the murderer\r\nand adulterer, after a sharp skirmish. Three of the principal men of\r\nthe tribe who had given themselves up, trusting to Mackay’s clemency,\r\nwere beheaded.[178]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the reign of the unfortunate Queen Mary, during\r\nthe period of the Reformation in Scotland, the house of Huntly had\r\nacquired such an influence in the north and north-east of Scotland,\r\nthe old Maormorate of Moray, as to be looked upon with suspicion by\r\nthe government of the day. Moreover the Lords of the Congregation\r\nregarded the earl with no friendly feeling as the great leader of the\r\nRoman Catholic party in the country, and it was therefore resolved\r\nthat Mary should make a royal progress northwards, apparently for\r\nthe purpose of seeing what was the real state of matters, and, if\r\npossible, try to overawe the earl, and remind him that he was only\r\na subject. The queen, who, although Huntly was the Catholic leader,\r\nappears to have entered into the expedition heartily; and her\r\nbastard brother, the Earl of Murray, proceeded, in 1562, northwards,\r\nbacked by a small army, and on finding the earl fractious, laid\r\nsiege to the castle of Inverness, which was taken, and the governor\r\nhanged. The queen’s army and the followers of Huntly met at the hill\r\nof Corrichie, about sixteen miles west of Aberdeen, when the latter\r\nwere defeated, the earl himself being found among the slain. It was\r\non this occasion that Mary is said to have wished herself a man to be\r\nable to ride forth “in jack and knap-skull.” This expedition was the\r\nmeans of effectually breaking the influence of this powerful northern\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nGeorge, Earl of Caithness, who had long borne a mortal hatred to\r\nJohn, Earl of Sutherland, now projected a scheme for cutting him\r\noff, as well as his countess, who was big with child, and their\r\nonly son, Alexander Gordon; the earl and countess were accordingly\r\nboth poisoned at Helmsdale, while at supper, by Isobel Sinclair,\r\nwife of Gilbert Gordon of Gartay, and sister of William Sinclair\r\nof Dumbaith, instigated, it is said, by the earl; but their son,\r\nAlexander, made a very narrow escape, not having returned in time\r\nfrom a hunting excursion to join his father and mother at supper.\r\nOn Alexander’s return the earl had become fully aware of the danger\r\nof his situation, and he was thus prevented by his father from\r\nparticipating in any part of the supper which remained, and after\r\ntaking an affectionate and parting farewell, and recommending him\r\nto the protection of God and of his dearest friends, he sent him to\r\nDunrobin the same night without his supper. The earl and his lady\r\nwere carried next morning to Dunrobin, where they died within five\r\ndays thereafter, in the month of July, 1567, and were buried in the\r\ncathedral church at Dornoch. Pretending to cover himself from the\r\nimputation of being concerned in this murder, the Earl of Caithness\r\npunished some of the earl’s most faithful servants under the colour\r\nof avenging his death; but the deceased earl’s friends being\r\ndetermined to obtain justice, apprehended Isobel Sinclair, and sent\r\nher to Edinburgh to stand her trial, where, after being tried and\r\ncondemned, she died on the day appointed for her execution. During\r\nall the time of her illness she vented the most dreadful imprecations\r\nupon her cousin, the earl, who had induced her to commit the horrid\r\nact. Had this woman succeeded in cutting off the earl’s son, her own\r\neldest son, John Gordon, but for the extraordinary circumstances of\r\nhis death, to be noticed, would have succeeded to the earldom, as\r\nhe was the next male heir. This youth happening to be in the house\r\nwhen his mother had prepared the poison, became extremely thirsty,\r\nand called for a drink. One of his mother’s servants, not aware of\r\nthe preparation, presented to the youth a portion of the liquid into\r\nwhich the poison had been infused, which he drank. This occasioned\r\nhis death within two days, a circumstance which, together with the\r\nappearances of the body after death, gave a clue to the discovery of\r\nhis mother’s guilt.[179]\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the calamity which had befallen the house of\r\nSutherland, and the minority of the young earl, now only fifteen\r\nyears of age, Y-Mackay of Far, who had formed an alliance with\r\nthe Earl of Caithness, in 1567 invaded the country of Sutherland,\r\nwasted the barony of Skibo, entered the town of Dornoch, and, upon\r\nthe pretence of a quarrel with the Murrays, by whom it was chiefly\r\ninhabited, set fire to it, in which outrage he was assisted by the\r\nLaird of Duffus. These measures were only preliminary to a design\r\nwhich the Earl of Caithness had formed to get the Earl of Sutherland\r\ninto his hands, but he had the cunning to conceal his intentions in\r\nthe meantime, and to instigate Mackay to act as he wished, without\r\nappearing to be in any way concerned.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his design upon Alexander, the young Earl of\r\nSutherland, the Earl of Caithness prevailed upon Robert Stuart,\r\nbishop of Caithness, to write a letter to the governor of the castle\r\nof Skibo, in which the Earl of Sutherland resided, to deliver up the\r\ncastle to him; a request with which the governor complied. Having\r\ntaken possession of the castle, the earl carried off the young man\r\ninto Caithness, and although only fifteen years of age, he got him\r\nmarried to Lady Barbara Sinclair, his daughter, then aged thirty-two\r\nyears. Y-Mackay was the paramour of this lady, and for continuing the\r\nconnexion with him she was afterwards divorced by her husband.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness having succeeded in his wishes in obtaining\r\npossession of the Earl of Sutherland, entered the earl’s country, and\r\ntook possession of Dunrobin castle, in which he fixed his residence.\r\nHe also brought the Earl of Sutherland along with him, but he treated\r\nhim meanly, and he burnt all the papers belonging to the house of\r\nSutherland he could lay his hands on. Cruel and avaricious, he, under\r\nthe pretence of vindicating the law, for imaginary crimes expelled\r\nmany of the ancient families in Sutherland from the country, put\r\nmany of the inhabitants to death, disabled those he banished, in\r\ntheir persons, by new and unheard-of modes of torture, and stripped\r\nthem of all their wealth. To be suspected of favouring the house of\r\nSutherland, and to be wealthy, were deemed capital crimes by this\r\noppressor.\r\n\r\nAs the Earl of Sutherland did not live on friendly terms with his\r\nwife on account of her licentious connexion with Mackay, and as\r\nthere appeared no chance of any issue, the Earl of Caithness formed\r\nthe base design of cutting off the Earl of Sutherland, and marrying\r\nWilliam Sinclair, his second son, to Lady Margaret Gordon, the\r\neldest sister of the Earl of Sutherland, whom he had also gotten\r\ninto his hands, with the view of making William earl of Sutherland.\r\nThe better to conceal his intentions the Earl of Caithness made a\r\njourney south to Edinburgh, and gave the necessary instructions to\r\nthose in his confidence to despatch the Earl of Sutherland; but some\r\nof his trusty friends having received private intelligence of the\r\ndesigns of the Earl of Caithness from some persons who were privy\r\nthereto, they instantly set about measures for defeating them by\r\ngetting possession of the Earl of Sutherland’s person. Accordingly,\r\nunder cloud of night, they came quietly to the burn of Golspie, in\r\nthe vicinity of Dunrobin, where, concealing themselves to prevent\r\ndiscovery, they sent Alexander Gordon of Sidderay to the castle,\r\ndisguised as a pedlar, for the purpose of warning the Earl of\r\nSutherland of the danger of his situation, and devising means of\r\nescape. Being made acquainted with the design upon his life, and the\r\nplans of his friends for rescuing him, the earl, early the following\r\nmorning, proposed to the residents in the castle, under whose charge\r\nhe was, to accompany him on a small excursion in the neighbourhood.\r\nThis proposal seemed so reasonable in itself, that, although he was\r\nperpetually watched by the Earl of Caithness’ servants, and his\r\nliberty greatly restrained, they at once agreed; and, going out, the\r\nearl being aware of the ambush laid by his friends, led his keepers\r\ndirectly into the snare before they were aware of danger. The earl’s\r\nfriends thereupon rushed from their hiding-place, and seizing him,\r\nconveyed him safely out of the country of Sutherland to Strathbogie.\r\nThis took place in 1569. As soon as the Earl of Caithness’s retainers\r\nheard of the escape of Earl Alexander, they collected a party of men\r\nfavourable to their interests, and went in hot pursuit of him as far\r\nas Port-ne-Coulter; but they found that the earl and his friends had\r\njust crossed the ferry.[180]\r\n\r\nShortly after this affair a quarrel ensued between the Monroes and\r\nthe clan Kenzie, two very powerful Ross-shire clans. Lesley, the\r\ncelebrated bishop of Ross, had made over to his cousin, the Laird\r\nof Balquhain, the right and title of the castle of the Canonry of\r\nRoss, together with the castle lands. Notwithstanding this grant,\r\nthe Regent Murray had given the custody of this castle to Andrew\r\nMonroe of Milntown; and to make Lesley bear with the loss, the Regent\r\npromised him some of the lands of the Barony of Fintry in Buchan,\r\nbut on condition that he should cede to Monroe the castle and castle\r\nlands of the Canonry; but the untimely and unexpected death of the\r\nRegent interrupted this arrangement, and Andrew Monroe did not,\r\nof course, obtain the title to the castle and castle lands as he\r\nexpected. Yet Monroe had the address to obtain permission from the\r\nEarl of Lennox during his regency, and afterwards from the Earl of\r\nMar, his successor in that office, to get possession of the castle.\r\nThe clan Kenzie grudging to see Monroe in possession, and being\r\ndesirous to get hold of the castle themselves, purchased Lesley’s\r\nright, and, by virtue thereof, demanded delivery of the castle.\r\nMonroe refused to accede to this demand, on which the clan laid siege\r\nto the castle; but Monroe defended it for three years at the expense\r\nof many lives on both sides. It was then delivered up to the clan\r\nKenzie under the act of pacification.[181]\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made by the Earl of Sutherland, during his minority,\r\nto recover his possessions from the Earl of Caithness. In the\r\nmeantime the latter, disappointed and enraged at the escape of his\r\ndestined prey, vexed and annoyed still farther the partisans of the\r\nSutherland family. In particular, he directed his vengeance against\r\nthe Murrays, and made William Sutherland of Evelick, brother to the\r\nLaird of Duffus, apprehend John Croy-Murray, under the pretence of\r\nbringing him to justice. This proceeding roused the indignation of\r\nHugh Murray of Aberscors, who assembled his friends, and made several\r\nincursions upon the lands of Evelick, Pronsies, and Riercher. They\r\nalso laid waste several villages belonging to the Laird of Duffus,\r\nfrom which they carried off some booty, and apprehending a gentleman\r\nof the Sutherlands, they detained him as an hostage for the safety\r\nof John Croy-Murray. Upon this the Laird of Duffus collected all\r\nhis kinsmen and friends, together with the Siol-Phaill at Skibo,\r\nand proceeded to the town of Dornoch, with the intention of burning\r\nit. But the inhabitants, aided by the Murrays, went out to meet the\r\nenemy, whom they courageously attacked and overthrew, and pursued to\r\nthe gates of Skibo. Besides killing several of Duffus’ men they made\r\nsome prisoners, whom they exchanged for John Croy-Murray. This affair\r\nwas called the skirmish of Torran-Roy.\r\n\r\nThe Laird of Duffus, who was father-in-law to the Earl of Caithness,\r\nand supported him in all his plans, immediately sent notice of\r\nthis disaster to the earl, who without delay sent his eldest son,\r\nJohn, Master of Caithness, with a large party of countrymen and\r\nfriends, including Y-Mackay and his countrymen, to attack the\r\nMurrays in Dornoch. They besieged the town and castle, which were\r\nboth manfully defended by the Murrays and their friends; but the\r\nMaster of Caithness, favoured by the darkness of the night, set fire\r\nto the cathedral, the steeple of which, however, was preserved.\r\nAfter the town had been reduced, the Master of Caithness attacked\r\nthe castle and the steeple of the church, into which a body of\r\nmen had thrown themselves, both of which held out for the space of\r\na week, and would probably have resisted much longer, but for the\r\ninterference of mutual friends of the parties, by whose mediation\r\nthe Murrays surrendered the castle and the steeple of the church;\r\nand, as hostages for the due performance of other conditions, they\r\ndelivered up Thomas Murray, son of Houcheon Murray of Aberscors,\r\nHoucheon Murray, son of Alexander Mac-Sir-Angus, and John Murray,\r\nson of Thomas Murray, the brother of John Murray of Aberscors. But\r\nthe Earl of Caithness refused to ratify the treaty which his son had\r\nentered into with the Murrays, and afterwards basely beheaded the\r\nthree hostages. These occurrences took place in the year 1570.[182]\r\n\r\nThe Murrays and the other friends of the Sutherland family, no\r\nlonger able to protect themselves from the vengeance of the Earl\r\nof Caithness, dispersed themselves into different countries, there\r\nto wait for more favourable times, when they might return to their\r\nnative soil without danger. The Murrays went to Strathbogie,\r\nwhere Earl Alexander then resided. Hugh Gordon of Drummoy retired\r\nto Orkney, where he married a lady named Ursla Tulloch; but he\r\nfrequently visited his friends in Sutherland, in spite of many\r\nsnares laid for him by the Earl of Caithness, while secretly going\r\nand returning through Caithness. Hugh Gordon’s brothers took refuge\r\nwith the Murrays at Strathbogie. John Gray of Skibo and his son\r\nGilbert retired to St. Andrews, where their friend Robert, bishop of\r\nCaithness, then resided, and Mac-Mhic-Sheumais of Strathully went to\r\nGlengarry.\r\n\r\nAs the alliance of such a powerful and war-like chief as Mackay would\r\nhave been of great importance to the Sutherland interest, an attempt\r\nwas made to detach him from the Earl of Caithness. The plan appears\r\nto have originated with Hugh Murray of Aberscors, who made repeated\r\nvisits to Strathbogie, to consult with the Earl of Sutherland and his\r\nfriends on this subject, and afterwards went into Strathnaver and\r\nheld a conference with Mackay, whom he prevailed upon to accompany\r\nhim to Strathbogie. Mackay then entered into an engagement with the\r\nEarl of Huntly and the Earl of Sutherland, to assist the latter\r\nagainst the Earl of Caithness, in consideration of which, and on\r\npayment of £300 Scots, he obtained from the Earl of Huntly the\r\nheritable right and title of the lands of Strathnaver; but Mackay,\r\ninfluenced by Barbara Sinclair, the wife of the Earl of Sutherland,\r\nwith whom he now publicly cohabited, broke his engagement, and\r\ncontinued to oppress the earl’s followers and dependents.\r\n\r\nFrom some circumstances which have not transpired, the Earl of\r\nCaithness became suspicious of his son John, the Master of Caithness,\r\nas having, in connection with Mackay, a design upon his life. To put\r\nan end to the earl’s suspicion, Mackay advised John to go to Girnigo\r\n(Castle Sinclair), and to submit himself to his father’s pleasure,\r\na request with which the Master complied; but, after arriving at\r\nGirnigo, he was, while conversing with his father, arrested by a\r\nparty of armed men, who, upon a secret signal being given by the\r\nearl, had rushed in at the chamber door. He was instantly fettered\r\nand thrust into prison within the castle, where, after a miserable\r\ncaptivity of seven years, he died, a prey to famine and vermin.\r\n\r\nMackay, who had accompanied the Master to Girnigo, and who in all\r\nprobability would have shared the same fate, escaped and returned\r\nhome to Strathnaver, where he died, within four months thereafter, of\r\ngrief and remorse for the many bad actions of his life. During the\r\nminority of his son Houcheon, John Mor-Mackay, the cousin, and John\r\nBeg-Mackay, the bastard son of Y-Mackay, took charge of the estate;\r\nbut John Mor-Mackay was speedily removed from his charge by the Earl\r\nof Caithness, who, considering him as a favourer of the Earl of\r\nSutherland, caused him to be apprehended and carried into Caithness,\r\nwhere he was detained in prison till his death. During this time\r\nJohn Robson, the chief of the clan Gun in Caithness and Strathnaver,\r\nbecame a dependent on the Earl of Sutherland, and acted as his factor\r\nin collecting the rents and duties of the bishop’s lands within\r\nCaithness which belonged to the earl. This connexion was exceedingly\r\ndisagreeable to the Earl of Caithness, who in consequence took a\r\ngrudge at John Robson, and, to gratify his spleen, he instigated\r\nHoucheon Mackay to lay waste the lands of the clan Gun, in the\r\nBrea-Moir, in Caithness, without the knowledge of John Beg-Mackay,\r\nhis brother. As the clan Gun had always been friendly to the family\r\nof Mackay, John Beg-Mackay was greatly exasperated at the conduct\r\nof the earl in enticing the young chief to commit such an outrage;\r\nbut he had it not in his power to make any reparation to the injured\r\nclan. John Robson, the chief, however, assisted by Alexander Earl of\r\nSutherland, invaded Strathnaver and made ample retaliation. Meeting\r\nthe Strathnaver men at a place called Creach-Drumi-Doun, he attacked\r\nand defeated them, killing several of them, and chiefly those who had\r\naccompanied Houcheon Mackay in his expedition to the Brea-Moir. He\r\nthen carried off a large quantity of booty, which he divided among\r\nthe clan Gun of Strathully, who had suffered by Houcheon Mackay’s\r\ninvasion.[183]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, having resolved to avenge himself on\r\nJohn Beg-Mackay for the displeasure shown by him at the conduct\r\nof Houcheon Mackay, and also on the clan Gun, prevailed upon\r\nNeill-Mac-Iain-Mac-William, chief of the Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, and\r\nJames Mac-Rory, chief of the Sliochd-Iain-Mhoir, to attack them.\r\nAccordingly, in the month of September, 1579, these two chiefs, with\r\ntheir followers, entered Balnekill in Durines during the night-time,\r\nand slew John Beg-Mackay and William Mac-Iain-Mac-Rob, the brother of\r\nJohn Robson, and some of their people. The friends of the deceased\r\nwere not in a condition to retaliate, but they kept up the spirit of\r\nrevenge so customary in those times, and only waited a favourable\r\nopportunity to gratify it. This did not occur till several years\r\nthereafter. In the year 1587, James Mac-Rory, “a fyne gentleman and\r\na good commander,” according to Sir Robert Gordon, was assassinated\r\nby Donald Balloch-Mackay, the brother of John Beg-Mackay; and two\r\nyears thereafter John Mackay, the son of John Beg, attacked Neill\r\nMac-Iain-Mac-William, whom he wounded severely, and cut off some of\r\nhis followers. “This Neill,” says Sir R. Gordon, “heir mentioned,\r\nwes a good captain, bold, craftie, of a verie good witt, and quick\r\nresolution.”\r\n\r\nAfter the death of John Beg-Mackay, and William Mac-Iain-Mac-Rob, a\r\nmost deadly and inveterate feud followed, between the clan Gun and\r\nthe Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, but no recital of the details has been\r\nhanded down to us. “The long, the many, the horrible encounters,”\r\nobserves Sir R. Gordon “which happened between these two trybes, with\r\nthe bloodshed, and infinit spoills committed in every pairt of the\r\ndiocy of Catteynes by them and their associats, are of so disordered\r\nand troublesome memorie, that, what with their asperous names,\r\ntogether with the confusion of place, tymes, and persons, would yet\r\nbe (no doubt) a warr to the reader to overlook them; and therefor,\r\nto favor myne oune paines, and his who should get little profite or\r\ndelight thereby, I doe pass them over.”[184]\r\n\r\nThe clan Chattan, about this time, must have been harassing the\r\nsurrounding districts to a terrible extent, and causing the\r\ngovernment considerable trouble, as in 1583 we find a mandate\r\naddressed by King James “to our shirreffs of Kincardin, Abirdene,\r\nBanf, Elgen, Fores, Narne, and Invernyss; and to our derrest\r\nbruthir, James, Erle of Murray, our lieutenant generale in the\r\nnorth partis of our realme, and to our louittis consingis [ ... ]\r\nErle of Suthirland; John Erle of Cathnes,” &c., &c., commanding\r\nthem that inasmuch as John M’Kinlay, Thomas Mackinlay, Donald\r\nGlass, &c., “throcht assistance and fortifying of all the kin of\r\nClanquhattane duelland within Baienach, Petty, Brauchly, Strathnarne,\r\nand other parts thereabout, committs daily fire-raising, slaughter,\r\nmurder, heirschippis, and wasting of the cuntre,” to the harm of\r\nthe true lieges, these sheriffs and others shall fall upon the\r\n“said Clanquhattane, and invade them to their utter destruction by\r\nslaughter, burning, drowning, and other ways; and leave na creature\r\nliving of that clan, except priests, women, and bairns.” The “women\r\nand bairns” they were ordered to take to “some parts of the sea\r\nnearest land, quhair ships salbe forsene on our expenses, to sail\r\nwith them furth of our realme, and land with them in Jesland,\r\nZesland, or Norway; because it were inhumanity to put hands in the\r\nblood of women and bairns.” Had this mandate for “stamping out” this\r\ntroublesome clan been carried out it would certainly have been an\r\neffectual cure for many of the disturbances in the Highlands; but we\r\ncannot find any record as to what practical result followed the issue\r\nof this cruel decree.[185]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1585 a quarrel took place between Neill Houcheonson,\r\nand Donald Neilson, the Laird of Assynt, who had married Houcheon\r\nMackay’s sister. The cause of Donald Neilson was espoused by Houcheon\r\nMackay, and the clan Gun, who came with an army out of Caithness and\r\nStrathnaver, to besiege Neill Houcheonson in the isle of Assynt.\r\nNeill, who was commander of Assynt, and a follower of the Earl of\r\nSutherland, sent immediate notice to the earl of Mackay’s movements,\r\non receiving which the earl, assembling a body of men, despatched\r\nthem to Assynt to raise the siege; but Mackay did not wait for their\r\ncoming, and retreated into Strathnaver. As the Earl of Caithness\r\nhad sent some of his people to assist Mackay, who was the Earl\r\nof Sutherland’s vassal, the latter resolved to punish both, and\r\naccordingly made preparations for entering Strathnaver and Caithness\r\nwith an army. But some mutual friends of the parties interfered to\r\nprevent the effusion of blood, by prevailing on the two earls to meet\r\nat Elgin, in the presence of the Earl of Huntly and other friends,\r\nand get their differences adjusted. A meeting was accordingly held,\r\nat which the earls were reconciled. The whole blame of the troubles\r\nand commotions which had recently disturbed the peace of Sutherland\r\nand Caithness, was thrown upon the clan Gun, who were alleged to\r\nhave been the chief instigators, and as their restless disposition\r\nmight give rise to new disorders, it was agreed, at said meeting, to\r\ncut them off, and particularly that part of the tribe which dwelt\r\nin Caithness, which was chiefly dreaded, for which purpose the Earl\r\nof Caithness bound himself to deliver up to the Earl of Sutherland,\r\ncertain individuals of the clan living in Caithness. To enable him\r\nto implement his engagement a resolution was entered into to send\r\ntwo companies of men against those of the clan Gun who dwelt in\r\nCaithness and Strathnaver, and to surround them in such a way as to\r\nprevent escape. The Earl of Caithness, notwithstanding, sent private\r\nnotice to the clan of the preparations making against them by Angus\r\nSutherland of Mellary, in Berriedale; but the clan were distrustful\r\nof the earl, as they had already received secret intelligence that he\r\nhad assembled his people together for the purpose of attacking them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Earl of Sutherland could get his men collected he\r\nproceeded to march to the territories of the clan Gun; but meeting\r\nby chance, on his way, with a party of Strathnaver men, under the\r\ncommand of William Mackay, brother of Houcheon Mackay, carrying off\r\nthe cattle of James Mac-Rory, a vassal of his own, from Coireceann\r\nLoch in the Diri-Meanigh, he rescued and brought back his vassal’s\r\ncattle. After this the earl’s party pursued William Mackay and the\r\nStrathnaver men during the whole day, and killed one of the principal\r\nmen of the clan Gun in Strathnaver, called Angus-Roy, with several\r\nothers of Mackay’s company. This affair was called Latha-Tom-Fraoich,\r\nthat is, the day of the heather bush. At the end of the pursuit, and\r\ntowards evening, the pursued party found themselves on the borders of\r\nCaithness, where they found the clan Gun assembled in consequence of\r\nthe rising of the Caithness people who had taken away their cattle.\r\n\r\nThis accidental meeting of the Strathnaver men and the clan Gun\r\nwas the means, probably, of saving both from destruction. They\r\nimmediately entered into an alliance to stand by one another, and\r\nto live or die together. Next morning they found themselves placed\r\nbetween two powerful bodies of their enemies. On the one side was the\r\nEarl of Sutherland’s party at no great distance, reposing themselves\r\nfrom the fatigues of the preceding day, and on the other were seen\r\nadvancing the Caithness men, conducted by Henry Sinclair, brother to\r\nthe laird of Dun, and cousin to the Earl of Caithness. A council of\r\nwar was immediately held to consult how to act in this emergency,\r\nwhen it was resolved to attack the Caithness men first, as they were\r\nfar inferior in numbers, which was done by the clan Gun and their\r\nallies, who had the advantage of the hill, with great resolution.\r\nThe former foolishly expended their arrows while at a distance from\r\ntheir opponents; but the clan Gun having husbanded their shot till\r\nthey came in close contact with the enemy, did great execution. The\r\nCaithness men were completely over-thrown, after leaving 140 of\r\ntheir party, with their captain, Henry Sinclair, dead on the field\r\nof battle. Had not the darkness of the night favoured their flight,\r\nthey would have all been destroyed. Henry Sinclair was Mackay’s\r\nuncle, and not being aware that he had been in the engagement till he\r\nrecognised his body among the slain, Mackay felt extremely grieved\r\nat the unexpected death of his relative. This skirmish took place\r\nat Aldgown, in the year 1586. The Sutherland men having lost sight\r\nof Mackay and his party among the hills, immediately before the\r\nconflict, returned into their own country with the booty they had\r\nrecovered, and were not aware of the defeat of the Caithness men till\r\nsome time after that event.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness afterwards confessed that he had no intention\r\nof attacking the clan Gun at the time in question; but that his\r\npolicy was to have allowed them to be closely pressed and pursued by\r\nthe Sutherland men, and then to have relieved them from the imminent\r\ndanger they would thereby be placed in, so that they might consider\r\nthat it was to him they owed their safety, and thus lay them under\r\nfresh obligations to him. But the deceitful part he acted proved very\r\ndisastrous to his people, and the result so exasperated him against\r\nthe clan Gun, that he hanged John Mac-Iain-Mac-Rob, chieftain of the\r\nclan Gun, in Caithness, whom he had kept captive for some time.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these proceedings was another meeting between\r\nthe Earls of Sutherland and Caithness at the hill of Bingrime in\r\nSutherland, which was brought about by the mediation of Sir Patrick\r\nGordon of Auchindun, who was sent into the north by his nephew, the\r\nEarl of Huntly, for that purpose. Here again a new confederacy was\r\nformed against the clan Gun in Caithness, who were now maintained\r\nand harboured by Mackay. The Earl of Sutherland, on account of the\r\nrecent defeat of the Caithness men, undertook to attack the clan\r\nfirst. He accordingly directed two bodies to march with all haste\r\nagainst the clan, one of which was commanded by James Mac-Rory and\r\nNeill Mac-Iain-Mac-William, chief of the Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, who\r\nwere now under the protection of the Earl of Sutherland; and the\r\nother by William Sutherland Johnson, George Gordon in Marle, and\r\nWilliam Murray in Kinnald, brother of Hugh Murray of Aberscors.\r\nHoucheon Mackay, seeing no hopes of maintaining the clan Gun any\r\nlonger without danger to himself, discharged them from his country,\r\nwhereupon they made preparations for seeking an asylum in the\r\nwestern isles. But, on their journey thither, they were met near\r\nLoch Broom, at a place called Leckmelme, by James Mac-Rory and Neill\r\nMac-Iain-Mac-William, where, after a sharp skirmish, they were\r\noverthrown, and the greater part of them killed. Their commander,\r\nGeorge Mac-Iain-Mac-Rob, brother of John Mac-Iain-Mac-Rob, who was\r\nhanged by the Earl of Caithness, was severely wounded, and was taken\r\nprisoner after an unsuccessful attempt to escape by swimming across a\r\nloch close by. After being carried to Dunrobin castle, and presented\r\nto the Earl of Sutherland, George Gun was sent by him to the Earl of\r\nCaithness, who, though extremely grieved at the misfortune which had\r\nhappened to the clan Gun, dissembled his vexation, and received the\r\nprisoner as if he approved of the Earl of Sutherland’s proceedings\r\nagainst him and his unfortunate people. After a short confinement,\r\nGeorge Gun was released from his captivity by the Earl of Caithness,\r\nat the entreaty of the Earl of Sutherland, not from any favour to\r\nthe prisoner himself, or to the earl, whom the Earl of Caithness\r\nhated mortally, but with the design of making Gun an instrument of\r\nannoyance to some of the Earl of Sutherland’s neighbours. But the\r\nEarl of Caithness was disappointed in his object, for George Gun,\r\nafter his enlargement from prison, always remained faithful to the\r\nEarl of Sutherland.[186]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a violent feud arose in the western isles between\r\nAngus Macdonald of Kintyre, and Sir Lauchlan Maclean of Duart, in\r\nMull, whose sister Angus had married, which ended in the almost total\r\ndestruction of the clan Donald and clan Lean. The circumstances which\r\nled to this unfortunate dissension were these:--\r\n\r\nDonald Gorm Macdonald of Slate, when going on a visit from Slate to\r\nhis cousin, Angus Macdonald of Kintyre, was forced by contrary winds\r\nto land with his party in the island of Jura, which belonged partly\r\nto Sir Lauchlan Maclean, and partly to Angus Macdonald. The part of\r\nthe island where Macdonald of Slate landed belonged to Sir Lauchlan\r\nMaclean. No sooner had Macdonald and his company landed, than, by an\r\nunlucky coincidence, Macdonald Tearreagh and Houcheon Macgillespic,\r\ntwo of the clan Donald who had lately quarrelled with Donald Gorm,\r\narrived at the same time with a party of men; and, understanding that\r\nDonald Gorm was in the island, they secretly took away, by night,\r\na number of cattle belonging to the clan Lean, and immediately put\r\nto sea. Their object in doing so was to make the clan Lean believe\r\nthat Donald Gorm and his party had carried off the cattle, in the\r\nhope that the Macleans would attack Donald Gorm, and they were\r\nnot disappointed. As soon as the _lifting_ of the cattle had been\r\ndiscovered, Sir Lauchlan Maclean assembled his whole forces, and,\r\nunder the impression that Donald Gorm and his party had committed\r\nthe spoliation, he attacked them suddenly and unawares, during the\r\nnight, at a place in the island called Inverchuockwrick, and slew\r\nabout sixty of the clan Donald. Donald Gorm, having previously gone\r\non board his vessel to pass the night, fortunately escaped.\r\n\r\nWhen Angus Macdonald heard of this “untoward event,” he visited\r\nDonald Gorm in Skye for the purpose of consulting with him on the\r\nmeans of obtaining reparation for the loss of his men. On his return\r\nhomeward to Kintyre, he landed in the Isle of Mull, and, contrary\r\nto the advice of Coll Mac-James and Reginald Mac-James, his two\r\nbrothers, and of Reginald Mac-Coll, his cousin, who wished him to\r\nsend a messenger to announce the result of his meeting with Donald\r\nGorm, went to the castle of Duart, the principal residence of Sir\r\nLauchlan Maclean in Mull. His two brothers refused to accompany him,\r\nand they acted rightly; for, the day after Angus arrived at Duart,\r\nhe and all his party were perfidiously arrested by Sir Lauchlan\r\nMaclean. Reginald Mac-Coll, the cousin of Angus, alone escaped.\r\nThe Rhinns of Islay at this time belonged to the clan Donald, but\r\nthey had given the possession of them to the clan Lean for personal\r\nservices. Sir Lauchlan, thinking the present a favourable opportunity\r\nfor acquiring an absolute right to this property, offered to release\r\nAngus Macdonald, provided he would renounce his right and title to\r\nthe Rhinns; and, in case of refusal, he threatened to make him end\r\nhis days in captivity. Angus, being thus in some degree compelled,\r\nagreed to the proposed terms, but, before obtaining his liberty, he\r\nwas forced to give James Macdonald, his eldest son, and Reginald\r\nMac-James, his brother, as hostages, until the deed of conveyance\r\nshould be delivered to Sir Lauchlan.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, the intention of Angus Macdonald to implement\r\nthis engagement, if he could accomplish the liberation of his son\r\nand brother. His cousin had suffered a grievous injury at the hands\r\nof Sir Lauchlan Maclean without any just cause of offence, and he\r\nhimself had, when on a friendly mission, been detained most unjustly\r\nas a prisoner, and compelled to promise to surrender into Sir\r\nLauchlan’s hands, by a regular deed, a part of his property. Under\r\nthese circumstances, his resolution to break the unfair engagement he\r\nhad come under is not to be wondered at. To accomplish his object he\r\nhad recourse to a stratagem in which he succeeded, as will be shown\r\nin the sequel.\r\n\r\nAfter Maclean had obtained delivery of the two hostages, he made a\r\nvoyage to Islay to get the engagement completed. He left behind, in\r\nthe castle of Duart, Reginald Mac-James, one of the hostages, whom he\r\nput in fetters, and took the other to accompany him on his voyage.\r\nHaving arrived in the isle of Islay, he encamped at Eilean-Gorm, a\r\nruinous castle upon the Rhinns of Islay which castle had been lately\r\nin the possession of the clan Lean. Angus Macdonald was residing at\r\nthe time at the house of Mulindry or Mullindhrea, a comfortable and\r\nwell-furnished residence belonging to him on the island, and to\r\nwhich he invited Sir Lauchlan, under the pretence of affording him\r\nbetter accommodation, and providing him with better provisions than\r\nhe could obtain in his camp; but Sir Lauchlan, having his suspicions,\r\ndeclined to accept the invitation. “There wes,” says Sir Robert\r\nGordon, “so little trust on either syd, that they did not now meit\r\nin friendship or amitie, bot vpon ther owne guard, or rather by\r\nmessingers, one from another. And true it is (sayeth John Colwin, in\r\nhis manuscript) that the islanders are, of nature, verie suspicious;\r\nfull of invention against ther nighbours, by whatsoever way they may\r\nget them destroyed. Besyds this, they are bent and eager in taking\r\nrevenge, that neither have they regaird to persone, tyme, aige, nor\r\ncause; and ar generallie so addicted that way (as lykwise are the\r\nmost pairt of all Highlanders), that therein they surpasse all other\r\npeople whatsoever.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle Duart.]\r\n\r\nSir Lauchlan, however, was thrown off his guard by fair promises,\r\nand agreed to pay Macdonald a visit, and accordingly proceeded\r\nto Mulindry, accompanied by James Macdonald, his own nephew, and\r\nthe son of Angus, and 86 of his kinsmen and servants. Maclean and\r\nhis party, on their arrival, were received by Macdonald with much\r\napparent kindness, and were sumptuously entertained dining the whole\r\nday. In the meantime, Macdonald sent notice to all his friends and\r\nwell-wishers in the island, to come to his house at nine o’clock\r\nat night, his design being to seize Maclean and his party. At the\r\nusual hour for going to repose, Maclean and his people were lodged\r\nin a long-house, which stood by itself, at some distance from the\r\nother houses. During the whole day Maclean had always kept James\r\nMacdonald, the hostage, within his reach, as a sort of protection\r\nto him in case of an attack, and at going to bed he took him along\r\nwith him. About an hour after Maclean and his people had retired,\r\nAngus assembled his men to the number of 300 or 400, and made them\r\nsurround the house in which Maclean and his company lay. Then, going\r\nhimself to the door, he called upon Maclean, and told him that he\r\nhad come to give him his reposing drink, which he had forgotten to\r\noffer him before going to bed. Maclean answered that he did not\r\nwish to drink at that time; but Macdonald insisted that he should\r\nrise and receive the drink, it being, he said, his will that he\r\nshould do so. The peremptory tone of Macdonald made Maclean at once\r\napprehensive of the danger of his situation, and immediately getting\r\nup and placing the boy between his shoulders, prepared to preserve\r\nhis life as long as he could with the boy, or to sell it as dearly\r\nas possible. As soon as the door was forced open, James Macdonald,\r\nseeing his father with a naked sword in his hand and a number of his\r\nmen armed in the same manner, cried aloud for mercy to Maclean, his\r\nuncle, which being granted, Sir Lauchlan was immediately removed to\r\na secret chamber, where he remained till next morning. After Maclean\r\nhad surrendered, Angus Macdonald announced to those within the house,\r\nthat if they would come without their lives would be spared; but he\r\nexcepted Macdonald Terreagh and another individual whom he named.\r\nThe whole, with the exception of these two, having complied, the\r\nhouse was immediately set on fire, and consumed along with Macdonald\r\nTerreagh and his companion. The former was one of the clan Donald of\r\nthe Western Islands, and not only had assisted the clan Lean against\r\nhis own tribe, but was also the originator, as we have seen, of all\r\nthese disturbances; and the latter was a near kinsman to Maclean, one\r\nof the oldest of the clan, and celebrated for his wisdom and prowess.\r\nThis affair took place in the month of July, 1586.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACLEAN. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence of the seizure of Sir Lauchlan Maclean reached\r\nthe Isle of Mull, Allan Maclean, who was the nearest kinsman to\r\nMaclean, whose children were then very young, bethought himself of an\r\nexpedient to obtain the possessions of Sir Lauchlan. In conjunction\r\nwith his friends, Allan caused a false report to be spread in the\r\nisland of Islay, that the friends of Maclean had killed Reginald\r\nMac-James, the remaining hostage at Duart in Mull, by means of which\r\nhe hoped that Angus Macdonald would be moved to kill Sir Lauchlan,\r\nand thereby enable him (Allan) to supply his place. But although this\r\ndevice did not succeed, it proved very disastrous to Sir Lauchlan’s\r\nfriends and followers, who were beheaded in pairs by Coll Mac-James,\r\nthe brother of Angus Macdonald.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Sir Lauchlan seeing no hopes of his release, applied\r\nto the Earl of Argyle to assist them in a contemplated attempt\r\nto rescue him out of the hands of Angus Macdonald; but the earl,\r\nperceiving the utter hopelessness of such an attempt with such forces\r\nas he and they could command, advised them to complain to King\r\nJames VI. against Angus Macdonald, for the seizure and detention of\r\ntheir chief. The king immediately directed that Macdonald should be\r\nsummoned by a herald-at-arms to deliver up Sir Lauchlan into the\r\nhands of the Earl of Argyle; but the herald was interrupted in the\r\nperformance of his duty, not being able to procure shipping for\r\nIslay, and was obliged to return home. The Earl of Argyle had then\r\nrecourse to negotiation with Macdonald, and, after considerable\r\ntrouble, he prevailed on him to release Sir Lauchlan on certain\r\nstrict conditions, but not until Reginald Mac-James, the brother of\r\nAngus, had been delivered up, and the earl, for performance of the\r\nconditions agreed upon, had given his own son, and the son of Macleod\r\nof Harris, as hostages. But Maclean, quite regardless of the safety\r\nof the hostages, and in open violation of the engagements he had\r\ncome under, on hearing that Angus Macdonald had gone on a visit to\r\nthe clan Donald of the glens in Ireland, invaded Isla, which he laid\r\nwaste, and pursued those who had assisted in his capture.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Ireland, Angus Macdonald made great preparations\r\nfor inflicting a just chastisement upon Maclean. Collecting a large\r\nbody of men, and much shipping, he invaded Mull and Tiree, carrying\r\nhavoc and destruction along with him, and destroying every human\r\nbeing and every domestic animal, of whatever kind. While Macdonald\r\nwas committing these ravages in Mull and Tiree, Maclean, instead of\r\nopposing him, invaded Kintyre, where he took ample retaliation by\r\nwasting and burning a great part of that country. In this manner did\r\nthese hostile clans continue, for a considerable period, mutually to\r\nvex and destroy one another, till they were almost exterminated, root\r\nand branch.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen his own power and to weaken that of his\r\nantagonist, Sir Lauchlan Maclean attempted to detach John Mac-Iain,\r\nof Ardnamurchan, from Angus Macdonald and his party. Mac-Iain had\r\nformerly been an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of Maclean’s\r\nmother, and Sir Hector now gave him an invitation to visit him\r\nin Mull, promising, at the same time, to give him his mother in\r\nmarriage. Mac-Iain accepted the invitation, and on his arrival\r\nin Mull, Maclean prevailed on his mother to marry Mac-Iain, and\r\nthe nuptials were accordingly celebrated at Torloisk in Mull. No\r\npersuasion, however, could induce Mac-Iain to join against his own\r\ntribe, towards which, notwithstanding his matrimonial alliance, he\r\nentertained the strongest affection. Chagrined at the unexpected\r\nrefusal of Mac-Iain, Sir Lauchlan resolved to punish his refractory\r\nguest by one of those gross infringements of the laws of hospitality\r\nwhich so often marked the hostility of rival clans. During the dead\r\nhour of the night he caused the door of Mac-Iain’s bedchamber to\r\nbe forced open, dragged him from his bed, and from the arms of his\r\nwife, and put him in close confinement, after killing eighteen of his\r\nfollowers. After suffering a year’s captivity, he was released and\r\nexchanged for Maclean’s son, and the other hostages in Macdonald’s\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions between these two tribes having attracted the\r\nattention of government, the rival chiefs were induced, partly by\r\ncommand of the king, and partly by persuasions and fair promises,\r\nto come to Edinburgh in the year 1592, for the purpose of having\r\ntheir differences reconciled. On their arrival they were committed\r\nprisoners to the castle of Edinburgh, but were soon released and\r\nallowed to return home on payment of a small pecuniary fine, “and a\r\nshamfull remission,” says Sir Robert Gordon, “granted to either of\r\nthem.”[187]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1587, the flames of discord, which had lain dormant for\r\na short time, burst forth between the rival houses of Sutherland and\r\nCaithness. In the year 1583, Alexander, Earl of Sutherland, obtained\r\nfrom the Earl of Huntly a grant of the superiority of Strathnaver,\r\nand of the heritable sheriffship of Sutherland and Strathnaver, which\r\nlast was granted in lieu of the lordship of Aboyne. This grant was\r\nconfirmed by his Majesty in a charter under the great seal, by which\r\nSutherland and Strathnaver were disjoined and dismembered from the\r\nsheriffdom of Inverness. As the strength and influence of the Earl\r\nof Sutherland were greatly increased by the power and authority\r\nwith which the superiority of Strathnaver invested him, the Earl of\r\nCaithness used the most urgent entreaties with the Earl of Huntly,\r\nwho was his brother-in-law, to recall the gift of the superiority\r\nwhich he had granted to the Earl of Sutherland, and confer the\r\nsame on him. The Earl of Huntly gave no decided answer to this\r\napplication, although he seemed rather to listen with a favourable\r\near to his brother-in-law’s request. The Earl of Sutherland having\r\nbeen made aware of his rival’s pretensions, and of the reception\r\nwhich he had met with from the Earl of Huntly, immediately notified\r\nto Huntly that he would never restore the superiority either to him\r\nor to the Earl of Caithness, as the bargain he had made with him had\r\nbeen long finally concluded. The Earl of Huntly was much offended at\r\nthis notice, but he and the Earl of Sutherland were soon reconciled\r\nthrough the mediation of Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindun.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his views of obtaining the superiority in question,\r\nthe Earl of Caithness seized the first opportunity, which\r\npresented itself, of quarrelling with the Earl of Sutherland,\r\nand he now thought that a suitable occasion had occurred. George\r\nGordon, a bastard son of Gilbert Gordon of Gartay, having offered\r\nmany indignities to the Earl of Caithness, the Earl, instead of\r\ncomplaining to the Earl of Sutherland, in whose service this George\r\nGordon was, craved satisfaction and redress from the Earl of\r\nHuntly. Huntly very properly desired the Earl of Caithness to lay\r\nhis complaint before the Earl of Sutherland; but this he declined\r\nto do, disdaining to seek redress from Earl Alexander. Encouraged,\r\nprobably, by the refusal of the Earl of Huntly to interfere, and the\r\nstubbornness of the Earl of Caithness to ask redress from his master,\r\nGeorge Gordon, who resided in the town of Marle in Strathully, on the\r\nborders of Caithness, not satisfied with the indignities which he had\r\nformerly shown to the Earl of Caithness, cut off the tails of the\r\nearl’s horses as they were passing the river of Helmsdale under the\r\ncare of his servants, on their journey from Caithness to Edinburgh,\r\nand in derision desired the earl’s servants to show him what he had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThis George Gordon, it would appear, led a very irregular and wicked\r\ncourse of life, and shortly after the occurrence we have just\r\nrelated, a circumstance happened which induced the Earl of Caithness\r\nto take redress at his own hands. George Gordon had incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the Earl of Sutherland by an unlawful connexion with\r\nhis wife’s sister, and as he had no hopes of regaining the earl’s\r\nfavour but by renouncing this impure intercourse, he sent Patrick\r\nGordon, his brother, to the Earl of Caithness to endeavour to\r\neffect a reconciliation with him, as he could no longer rely upon\r\nthe protection of his master, the Earl of Sutherland. The Earl\r\nof Caithness, who felt an inward satisfaction at hearing of the\r\ndispleasure of the Earl of Sutherland with George Gordon, dissembled\r\nhis feelings, and pretended to listen with great favour to the\r\nrequest of Patrick Gordon, in order to throw George Gordon off his\r\nguard, while he was in reality meditating his destruction. The _ruse_\r\nsucceeded so effectually, that although Gordon received timeous\r\nnotice, from some friends, of the intentions of the earl to attack\r\nhim, he reposed in false security upon the promises held out to\r\nhim, and made no provision for his personal safety. But he was soon\r\nundeceived by the appearance of the earl and a body of men, who,\r\nin February, 1587, entering Marle under the silence of the night,\r\nsurrounded his house and required him to surrender, which he refused\r\nto do. Having cut his way through his enemies and thrown himself into\r\nthe river of Helmsdale, which he attempted to swim across, he was\r\nslain by a shower of arrows.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Sutherland, though he disliked the conduct of George\r\nGordon, was highly incensed at his death, and made great preparations\r\nto punish the Earl of Caithness for his attack upon Gordon. The Earl\r\nof Caithness in his turn assembled his whole forces, and, being\r\njoined by Mackay and the Strathnaver men, together with John, the\r\nMaster of Orkney, and the Earl of Carrick, brother of Patrick, Earl\r\nof Orkney, and some of his countrymen, marched to Helmsdale to meet\r\nthe Earl of Sutherland. As soon as the latter heard of the advance\r\nof the Earl of Caithness, he also proceeded towards Helmsdale,\r\naccompanied by Mackintosh, Roderick Mackenzie of Redcastle, Hector\r\nMonroe of Contaligh, and Neill Houcheonson, with the men of Assynt.\r\nOn his arrival at the river of Helmsdale, the Earl of Sutherland\r\nfound the enemy encamped on the opposite side. Neither party seemed\r\ninclined to come to a general engagement, but contented themselves\r\nwith daily skirmishes, annoying each other with guns and arrows\r\nfrom the opposite banks of the river. The Sutherland men, who were\r\nvery expert archers, annoyed the Caithness men so much, as to force\r\nthem to break up their camp on the river side and to remove among\r\nthe rocks above the village of Easter Helmsdale. Mackay and his\r\ncountrymen were encamped on the river of Marle, and in order to\r\ndetach him from the Earl of Caithness, Macintosh crossed that river\r\nand had a private conference with him. After reminding him of the\r\nfriendship which had so long subsisted between his ancestors and the\r\nSutherland family, Macintosh endeavoured to impress upon his mind the\r\ndanger he incurred by taking up arms against his own superior the\r\nEarl of Sutherland, and entreated him, for his own sake, to join the\r\nearl; but Mackay remained inflexible.\r\n\r\nBy the mediation of mutual friends, the two earls agreed to a\r\ntemporary truce on the 9th of March, 1587, and thus the effusion of\r\nhuman blood was stopped for a short time. As Mackay was the vassal\r\nof the Earl of Sutherland, the latter refused to comprehend him\r\nin the truce, and insisted upon an unconditional submission, but\r\nMackay obstinately refused to do so, and returned home to his own\r\ncountry, highly chagrined that the Earl of Caithness, for whom he\r\nhad put his life and estate in jeopardy, should have acceded to\r\nthe Earl of Sutherland’s request to exclude him from the benefit\r\nof the truce. Before the two earls separated they came to a mutual\r\nunderstanding to reduce Mackay to obedience; and that he might not\r\nsuspect their design, they agreed to meet at Edinburgh for the\r\npurpose of concerting the necessary measures together. Accordingly,\r\nthey held a meeting at the appointed place in the year 1588, and\r\ncame to the resolution to attack Mackay; and to prevent Mackay from\r\nreceiving any intelligence of their design, both parties swore to\r\nkeep the same secret; but the Earl of Caithness, regardless of his\r\noath, immediately sent notice to Mackay of the intended attack,\r\nfor the purpose of enabling him to meet it. Instead, however, of\r\nfollowing the Earl of Caithness’s advice, Mackay, justly dreading\r\nhis hollow friendship, made haste, by the advice of Macintosh and\r\nthe Laird of Foulis, to reconcile himself to the Earl of Sutherland,\r\nhis superior, by an immediate submission. For this purpose he and\r\nthe earl first met at Inverness, and after conferring together they\r\nmade another appointment to meet at Elgin, where a perfect and final\r\nreconciliation took place in the month of November, 1588.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[164] Sir Robert Gordon, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[165] Sir R.

The people\r\nof Caithness, alarmed at the great force of the earl, fled in all\r\ndirections on his approach, and he never halted till he reached the\r\nstrong fort of Girnigo, where he pitched his camp for twelve days. He\r\nthen penetrated as far as Duncansby, killing several of the country\r\npeople on his route, and collecting an immense quantity of cattle\r\nand goods, so large, indeed, as to exceed all that had been seen\r\ntogether in that country for many years. This invasion had such an\r\neffect upon the people of Caithness, that every race, clan, tribe,\r\nand family there, vied with one another in offering pledges to the\r\nEarl of Sutherland to keep the peace in all time coming. The town of\r\nWick was also pillaged and burnt, but the church was preserved. In\r\nthe church was found the heart of the Earl of Caithness’s father in a\r\ncase of lead, which was opened by John Mac-Gille-Calum of Rasay, and\r\nthe ashes of the heart were thrown by him to the winds.\r\n\r\nDuring the time when these depredations were being committed,\r\nthe Earl of Caithness shut himself up in the castle of Girnigo;\r\nbut on learning the disasters which had befallen his country, he\r\ndesired a cessation of hostilities and a conference with the Earl\r\nof Sutherland. As the castle of Girnigo was strongly fortified, and\r\nas the Earl of Caithness had made preparations for enduring a long\r\nsiege, the Earl of Sutherland complied with his request. Both earls\r\nultimately agreed to refer all their differences and disputes to the\r\narbitration of friends, and the Earl of Huntly was chosen by mutual\r\nconsent to act as umpire or oversman, in the event of a difference\r\nof opinion. A second truce was in this way entered into until the\r\ndecision of the arbiters, when all differences were to cease.[188]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this engagement, however, the Earl of Caithness soon\r\ngave fresh provocation, for before the truce had expired he sent\r\na party of his men to Diri-Chatt in Sutherland, under the command\r\nof Kenneth Buy, and his brother Farquhar Buy, chieftains of the\r\nSiol-Mhic-Imheair in Caithness, and chief advisers of the Earl of\r\nCaithness in his bad actions, and his instruments in oppressing the\r\npoor people of Caithness. The Earl of Sutherland lost no time in\r\nrevenging himself for the depredations committed. At Whitsunday, in\r\nthe year 1589, he sent 300 men into Caithness, with Alexander Gordon\r\nof Kilcalmekill at their head. They penetrated as far as Girnigo,\r\nlaying the country waste everywhere around them, and striking terror\r\ninto the hearts of the inhabitants, many of whom, including some of\r\nthe Siol-Mhic-Imheair, they killed. After spending their fury the\r\nparty returned to Sutherland with a large booty, and without the loss\r\nof a single man.\r\n\r\nTo retaliate upon the Earl of Sutherland for this inroad, James\r\nSinclair of Markle, brother of the Earl of Caithness, collected an\r\narmy of 3,000 men, with which he marched into Strathully, in the\r\nmonth of June, 1589. As the Earl of Sutherland had been apprehensive\r\nof an attack, he had placed a range of sentinels along the borders of\r\nSutherland, to give notice of the approach of the enemy. Of these,\r\nfour were stationed in the village of Liribell, which the Caithness\r\nmen entered in the middle of the day unknown to the sentinels, who,\r\ninstead of keeping an outlook, were at the time carelessly enjoying\r\nthemselves within the watch-house. On perceiving the Caithness\r\nmen about entering the house, they shut themselves up within it;\r\nbut the house being set on fire, three of them perished, and the\r\nfourth, rushing through the flames, escaped with great difficulty,\r\nand announced to his countrymen the arrival of the enemy. From\r\nStrathully, Sinclair passed forward with his army to a place called\r\nCrissalligh, on the height of Strathbroray, and began to drive away\r\nsome cattle towards Caithness. As the Earl of Sutherland had not\r\nyet had sufficient time to collect a sufficient force to oppose\r\nSinclair, he sent in the meantime Houcheon Mackay, who happened to be\r\nat Dunrobin with 500 or 600 men, to keep Sinclair in check until a\r\ngreater force should be assembled. With this body, which was hastily\r\ndrawn together on the spur of the occasion, Mackay advanced with\r\namazing celerity, and such was the rapidity of his movements, that\r\nhe most unexpectedly came up with Sinclair not far from Crissalligh,\r\nwhen his army was ranging about without order or military discipline.\r\nOn coming up, Mackay found John Gordon of Kilcalmekill at the head\r\nof a small party skirmishing with the Caithness men, a circumstance\r\nwhich made him instantly resolve, though so far inferior in numbers,\r\nto attack Sinclair. Crossing therefore the water, which was between\r\nhim and the enemy, Mackay and his men rushed upon the army of\r\nSinclair, which they defeated after a long and warm contest. The\r\nCaithness men retreated with the loss of their booty and part of\r\ntheir baggage, and were closely pursued by a body of men commanded\r\nby John Murray, nick-named _the merchant_, to a distance of 16\r\nmiles.[189]\r\n\r\nThis defeat, however, did not satisfy the Earl of Sutherland, who,\r\nhaving now assembled an army, entered Caithness with the intention\r\nof laying it waste. The earl advanced as far as Corrichoigh, and\r\nthe Earl of Caithness convened his forces at Spittle, where he lay\r\nwaiting the arrival of his enemy. The Earl of Huntly, having been\r\nmade acquainted with the warlike preparations of the two hostile\r\nearls, sent, without delay, his uncle, Sir Patrick Gordon of\r\nAuchindun, to mediate between them, and he luckily arrived at the\r\nEarl of Sutherland’s head-quarters, at the very instant his army\r\nwas on its march to meet the Earl of Caithness. By the friendly\r\ninterference of Sir Patrick, the parties were prevailed upon to\r\ndesist from their hostile intentions, and to agree to hold an\r\namicable meeting at Elgin, in presence of the Earl of Huntly, to\r\nwhom they also agreed to refer all their differences. A meeting\r\naccordingly took place in the month of November, 1589, at which all\r\ndisputes were settled, and in order that the reconciliation might\r\nbe lasting, and that no recourse might again be had to arms, the\r\ntwo earls subscribed a deed, by which they appointed Huntly and his\r\nsuccessors hereditary judges, and arbitrators of all disputes or\r\ndifferences, that might thenceforth arise between these two houses.\r\n\r\nThis reconciliation, however, as it did not obliterate the rancour\r\nwhich existed between the people of these different districts,\r\nwas but of short duration. The frequent depredations committed by\r\nthe vassals and retainers of the earls upon the property of one\r\nanother, led to an exchange of letters and messages between them\r\nabout the means to be used for repressing these disorders. During\r\nthis correspondence the Earl of Sutherland became unwell, and, being\r\nconfined to his bed, the Earl of Caithness, in October, 1590, wrote\r\nhim a kind letter, which he had scarcely despatched when he most\r\nunaccountably entered Sutherland with a hostile force; but he only\r\nremained one night in that country, in consequence of receiving\r\nintelligence of a meditated attack upon his camp by John Gordon of\r\nKilcalmekill, and Neill Mac-Iain-MacWilliam. A considerable number of\r\nthe Sutherland men having collected together, they resolved to pursue\r\nthe Caithness men, who had carried off a large quantity of cattle;\r\nbut, on coming nearly up with them, an unfortunate difference arose\r\nbetween the Murrays and the Gordons, each contending for the command\r\nof the vanguard. The Murrays rested their claim upon their former\r\ngood services to the house of Sutherland; but the Gordons refusing\r\nto admit it, all the Murrays, with the exception of William Murray,\r\nbrother of the Laird of Palrossie, and John Murray, _the merchant_,\r\nwithdrew, and took a station on a hill hard by to witness the combat.\r\nThis unexpected event seemed to paralyze the Gordons at first; but\r\nseeing the Caithness men driving the cattle away before them, and\r\nthinking that if they did not attack them they would be accused of\r\ncowardice, Patrick Gordon of Gartay, John Gordon of Embo, and John\r\nGordon of Kilcalmekill, after some consultation, resolved to attack\r\nthe retiring foe without loss of time, and without waiting for the\r\ncoming up of the Strathnaver men, who were hourly expected. This\r\nwas a bold and desperate attempt, as the Gordons were only as one\r\nto twelve in point of numbers, but they could not brook the idea of\r\nbeing branded as cowards. With such numerical inferiority, and with\r\nthe sun and wind in their faces to boot, the Sutherland men advanced\r\nupon and resolutely attacked the Caithness men near Clyne. In the van\r\nof the Caithness army were placed about 1,500 archers, a considerable\r\nnumber of whom were from the Western Isles, under the command of\r\nDonald Balloch Mackay of Scourie, who poured a thick shower of arrows\r\nupon the men of Sutherland as they advanced, the latter, in return,\r\ngiving their opponents a similar reception. The combat raged with\r\ngreat fury for a considerable time between these two parties: thrice\r\nwere the Caithness archers driven back upon their rear, which was in\r\nconsequence thrown into great disorder, and thrice did they return\r\nto the conflict, cheered on and encouraged by their leader; but,\r\nthough superior in numbers, they could not withstand the firmness and\r\nintrepidity of the Sutherland men, who forced them to retire from the\r\nfield of battle on the approach of night, and to abandon the cattle\r\nwhich had been carried off. The loss in killed and wounded was about\r\nequal on both sides; but, with the exception of Nicolas Sutherland,\r\nbrother of the Laird of Forse, and Angus Mac-Angus-Termat, both\r\nbelonging to the Caithness party, and John Murray, _the merchant_, on\r\nthe Sutherland side, there were no principal persons killed.\r\n\r\nVain as the efforts of the common friends of the rival earls had\r\nhitherto been to reconcile them effectually, the Earl of Huntly and\r\nothers once more attempted an arrangement, and having prevailed upon\r\nthe parties to meet at Strathbogie, a final agreement was entered\r\ninto in the month of March, 1591, by which they agreed to bury all\r\nbygone differences in oblivion, and to live on terms of amity in all\r\ntime thereafter.\r\n\r\nThis fresh reconciliation of the two earls was the means of restoring\r\nquiet in their districts for a considerable time, which was partially\r\ninterrupted in the year 1594, by a quarrel between the clan Gun\r\nand some of the other petty tribes. Donald Mac-William-Mac-Henric,\r\nAlister Mac-Iain-Mac-Rorie, and others of the clan Gun entered\r\nCaithness and attacked Farquhar Buy, one of the captains of the\r\ntribe of Siol-Mhic-Imheair, and William Sutherland, _alias_ William\r\nAbaraich, the chief favourite of the Earl of Caithness, and the\r\nprincipal plotter against the life of George Gordon, whose death\r\nhas been already noticed. After a warm skirmish, Farquhar Buy, and\r\nWilliam Abaraich, and some of their followers, were slain. To revenge\r\nthis outrage, the Earl of Caithness sent the same year his brother,\r\nJames Sinclair of Murkle, with a party of men, against the clan Gun\r\nin Strathie, in Strathnaver, who killed seven of that tribe. George\r\nMac-Iain-Mac-Rob, the chief, and Donald Mac-William-Mac-Henric\r\nnarrowly escaped with their lives.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of continuity, we have deferred noticing those\r\ntransactions in the north in which George Gordon, Earl of Huntly, was\r\nmore immediately concerned, and which led to several bloody conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe earl, who was a favourite at court, and personally liked by James\r\nVI., finding himself in danger from the prevailing faction, retired\r\nto his possessions in the north, for the purpose of improving his\r\nestates and enjoying domestic quiet. One of his first measures was to\r\nerect a castle at Ruthven, in Badenoch, in the neighbourhood of his\r\nhunting forests. This gave great offence to Macintosh, the chief of\r\nthe clan Chattan, and his people, as they considered that the object\r\nof its erection was to overawe the clan. Being the earl’s vassals\r\nand tenants, they were bound to certain services, among which the\r\nfurnishing of materials for the building formed a chief part; but,\r\ninstead of assisting the earl’s people, they at first indirectly\r\nand in an underhand manner endeavoured to prevent the workmen from\r\ngoing on with their operations, and afterwards positively refused\r\nto furnish the necessaries required for the building. This act of\r\ndisobedience was the cause of much trouble, which was increased by\r\na quarrel in the year 1590, between the Gordons and the Grants,\r\nthe occasion of which was as follows. John Grant, the tutor of\r\nBallendalloch, having withheld the rents due to the widow, and\r\nendeavoured otherwise to injure her, James Gordon, her nephew,\r\neldest son of Alexander Gordon of Lismore, along with some of his\r\nfriends, went to Ballendalloch to obtain justice for her. On their\r\narrival, differences were accommodated so far that the tutor paid up\r\nall arrears due to the lady, except a trifle, which he insisted, on\r\nsome ground or other, on retaining. This led to some altercation, in\r\nwhich the servants of both parties took a share, and latterly came\r\nto blows; but they were separated, and James Gordon returned home.\r\nJudging from what had taken place, that his aunt’s interests would in\r\nfuture be better attended to if under the protection of a husband,\r\nhe persuaded the brother of Sir Thomas Gordon of Cluny to marry her,\r\nwhich he did. This act so incensed the tutor of Ballendalloch, that\r\nhe at once showed his displeasure by killing, at the instigation\r\nof the laird of Grant, one of John Gordon’s servants. For this the\r\ntutor, and such of the Grants as should harbour or assist him, were\r\ndeclared outlaws and rebels, and a commission was granted to the\r\nEarl of Huntly to apprehend and bring them to justice, in virtue of\r\nwhich, he besieged the house of Ballendalloch, and took it by force,\r\non the 2d November, 1590; but the tutor effected his escape. Sir John\r\nCampbell of Cadell, a despicable tool of the Chancellor Maitland,\r\nwho had plotted the destruction of the earl and the laird of Grant,\r\nnow joined in the conspiracy against him, and stirred up the clan\r\nChattan, and Macintosh their chief, to aid the Grants. They also\r\npersuaded the Earls of Athol and Murray to assist them against the\r\nEarl of Huntly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Huntly ascertained that the Grants and clan Chattan, who\r\nwere his own vassals, had put themselves under the command of these\r\nearls, he assembled his followers, and, entering Badenoch, summoned\r\nhis vassals to appear before him, and deliver up the tutor and his\r\nabettors, but none of them came. He then proclaimed and denounced\r\nthem rebels, and obtained a royal commission to invade and apprehend\r\nthem. To consult on the best means of defending themselves, the Earls\r\nof Murray and Athole, the Dunbars, the clan Chattan, the Grants,\r\nand the laird of Cadell, and others of their party met at Forres.\r\nIn the midst of their deliberations Huntly, who had received early\r\nintelligence of the meeting, and had, in consequence, assembled his\r\nforces, unexpectedly made his appearance in the neighbourhood of\r\nForres. This sudden advance of Huntly struck terror into the minds of\r\nthe persons assembled, and the meeting instantly broke up in great\r\nconfusion. The whole party, with the exception of the Earl of Murray,\r\nleft the town in great haste, and fled to Tarnoway; the Earl of\r\nHuntly, not aware that Murray had remained behind, marching directly\r\nto Tarnoway in pursuit of the fugitives. On arriving within sight of\r\nthe castle into which the flying party had thrown themselves, the\r\nearl sent John Gordon, brother of Sir Thomas Gordon of Cluny, with a\r\nsmall body of men to reconnoitre; but approaching too near without\r\ndue caution, he was shot by one of the Earl of Murray’s servants. As\r\nHuntly found the castle well fortified, and as the rebels evacuated\r\nit and fled to the mountains, leaving a sufficient force to protect\r\nit, he disbanded his men on November 24, 1590, and returned home,\r\nwhence he proceeded to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival the Earl of Bothwell, who had a design\r\nupon the life of Chancellor Maitland, made an attack upon the palace\r\nof Holyrood-house under cloud of night, with the view of seizing\r\nMaitland; but, having failed in his object, he was forced to flee to\r\nthe north to avoid the vengeance of the king. The Earl of Huntly, who\r\nhad been lately reconciled to Maitland, and the Duke of Lennox, were\r\nsent in pursuit of Bothwell, but he escaped. Understanding afterwards\r\nthat he was harboured by the Earl of Murray at Donnibristle, the\r\nchancellor, having procured a commission against him from the king\r\nin favour of Huntly, again sent him, accompanied by forty gentlemen,\r\nto attack the Earl of Murray. When the party had arrived near\r\nDonnibristle, the Earl of Huntly sent Captain John Gordon, of\r\nBuckie, brother of Gordon of Gight, with a summons to the Earl of\r\nMurray, requiring him to surrender himself prisoner; but instead of\r\ncomplying, one of the earl’s servants levelled a piece at the bearer\r\nof the despatch, and wounded him mortally. Huntly, therefore, after\r\ngiving orders to take the Earl of Murray alive if possible, forcibly\r\nentered the house; but Sir Thomas Gordon, recollecting the fate of\r\nhis brother at Tarnoway, and Gordon of Gight, who saw his brother\r\nlying mortally wounded before his eyes, entirely disregarded the\r\ninjunction; and following the earl, who had fled among the rocks on\r\nthe adjoining sea-shore, slew him. It was this Earl of Murray who was\r\nknown as the “bonny” earl, and, according to some historians, had\r\nimpressed the heart of Anne of Denmark, and excited the jealousy of\r\nher royal spouse. This at least was the popular notion of his time:--\r\n\r\n      “He was a braw gallant,\r\n      And he played at the gluve;\r\n      And the bonny Earl of Murray,\r\n      Oh! he was the queen’s love.”\r\n\r\nAccording to one account the house was set on fire, and Murray was\r\ndiscovered, when endeavouring to escape, by a spark which fell on\r\nhis helmet, and slain by Gordon of Buckie, saying to the latter, who\r\nhad wounded him in the face, “You have spilt a better face than your\r\nawin.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Huntly immediately despatched John Gordon of Buckie to\r\nEdinburgh, to lay a statement of the affair before the king and\r\nthe chancellor. The death of the Earl of Murray would have passed\r\nquietly over, as an event of ordinary occurrence in those troublesome\r\ntimes; but, as he was one of the heads of the Protestant party, the\r\nPresbyterian ministers gave the matter a religious turn by denouncing\r\nthe Catholic Earl of Huntly as a murderer, who wished to advance the\r\ninterests of his church by imbruing his hands in the blood of his\r\nProtestant countrymen. The effect of the ministers’ denunciations\r\nwas a tumult among the people in Edinburgh and other parts of the\r\nkingdom, which obliged the king to cancel the commission he had\r\ngranted to the Earl of Huntly. The spirit of discontent became so\r\nviolent that Captain John Gordon, who had been left at Inverkeithing\r\nfor the recovery of his wounds, but who had been afterwards taken\r\nprisoner by the Earl of Murray’s friends and carried to Edinburgh,\r\nwas tried before a jury, and, contrary to law and justice, condemned\r\nand executed for having assisted the Earl of Huntly acting under a\r\nroyal commission. The recklessness and severity of this act were\r\nstill more atrocious, as Captain Gordon’s wounds were incurable, and\r\nhe was fast hastening to his grave. John Gordon of Buckie, who was\r\nmaster of the king’s household, was obliged to flee from Edinburgh,\r\nand made a narrow escape with his life.\r\n\r\nAs for the Earl of Huntly, he was summoned, at the instance of the\r\nLord of St. Colme, brother of the deceased Earl of Murray, to stand\r\ntrial. He accordingly appeared at Edinburgh, and offered to abide the\r\nresult of a trial by his peers, and in the meantime was committed a\r\nprisoner to the castle of Blackness on the 12th of March, 1591, till\r\nthe peers should assemble to try him. On giving sufficient surety,\r\nhowever, that he would appear and stand trial on receiving six days’\r\nnotice to that effect, he was released by the king on the 20th day of\r\nthe same month.\r\n\r\nThe clan Chattan, who had never submitted without reluctance to\r\nthe Earl of Huntly, considered the present aspect of affairs as\r\npeculiarly favourable to the design they entertained of shaking off\r\nthe yoke altogether, and being countenanced and assisted by the\r\nGrants, and other friends of the Earl of Murray, made no secret\r\nof their intentions. At first the earl sent Allan Macdonald-Dubh,\r\nthe chief of the clan Cameron, with his tribe, to attack the clan\r\nChattan in Badenoch, and to keep them in due order and subjection.\r\nThe Camerons, though warmly opposed, succeeded in defeating the clan\r\nChattan, who lost 50 of their men after a sharp skirmish. The earl\r\nnext despatched Macronald, with some of the Lochaber men, against\r\nthe Grants in Strathspey, whom he attacked, killed 18 of them, and\r\nlaid waste the lands of Ballendalloch. After the clan Chattan had\r\nrecovered from their defeat, they invaded Strathdee and Glenmuck\r\nin November 1592. To punish this aggression, the Earl of Huntly\r\ncollected his forces and entered Pettie, then in possession of the\r\nclan Chattan as a fief from the Earls of Murray, and laid waste all\r\nthe lands of the clan Chattan there, killed many of them, and carried\r\noff a large quantity of cattle, which he divided among his army.\r\nBut in returning from Pettie after disbanding his army, he received\r\nthe unwelcome intelligence that William Macintosh, son of Lauchlan\r\nMacintosh, the chief, with 800 of the clan Chattan, had invaded the\r\nlands of Auchindun and Cabberogh. The earl, after desiring the small\r\nparty which remained with him to follow him as speedily as possible,\r\nimmediately set off at full speed, accompanied by Sir Patrick Gordon\r\nof Auchindun and 36 horsemen, in quest of Macintosh and his party.\r\nOvertaking them before they had left the bounds of Cabberogh, upon\r\nthe top of a hill called Stapliegate, he attacked them with his small\r\nparty, and, after a warm skirmish, defeated them, killing about 60 of\r\ntheir men, and wounding William Macintosh and others.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Huntly, after thus subduing his enemies in the north,\r\nnow found himself placed under ban by the government on account of\r\nan alleged conspiracy between him and the Earls of Angus and Errol\r\nand the crown of Spain, to overturn the State and the Church. The\r\nking and his councillors seemed to be satisfied of the innocence of\r\nthe earls; but the ministers, who considered the reformed religion\r\nin Scotland in danger while these Catholic peers were protected and\r\nfavoured, importuned his majesty to punish them. The king, yielding\r\nto necessity and to the intrigues of Queen Elizabeth, forfeited their\r\ntitles, intending to restore them when a proper opportunity occurred;\r\nand, to silence the clamours of the ministers, convoked a parliament,\r\nwhich was held in the end of May, 1594. As few of the peers attended,\r\nthe ministers, having the commissioners of the burghs on their side,\r\ncarried everything their own way, and the consequence was, that the\r\nthree earls were attainted without trial, and their arms were torn in\r\npresence of the parliament, according to the custom in such cases.\r\n\r\nHaving so far succeeded, the ministers, instigated by the Queen of\r\nEngland, now entreated the king to send the Earl of Argyle, a youth\r\nof nineteen years of age, in the pay of Queen Elizabeth, with an army\r\nagainst the Catholic earls. The king, still yielding to necessity,\r\ncomplied, and Argyle, having collected a force of about 12,000 men,\r\nentered Badenoch and laid siege to the castle of Ruthven, on the\r\n27th of September, 1594. He was accompanied in this expedition by\r\nthe Earl of Athole, Sir Lauchlan Maclean with some of his islanders,\r\nthe chief of the Macintoshes, the Laird of Grant, the clan Gregor,\r\nMacneil of Barra, with all their friends and dependents, together\r\nwith the whole of the Campbells, and a variety of others animated by\r\na thirst for plunder or malice towards the Gordons. The castle of\r\nRuthven was so well defended by the clan Pherson, who were the Earl\r\nof Huntly’s vassals, that Argyle was obliged to give up the siege. He\r\nthen marched through Strathspey, and encamped at Drummin, upon the\r\nriver Avon, on the 2d of October, whence he issued orders to Lord\r\nForbes, the Frasers, the Dunbars, the clan Kenzie, the Irvings, the\r\nOgilvies, the Leslies, and other tribes and clans in the north, to\r\njoin his standard with all convenient speed.\r\n\r\nThe earls, against whom this expedition was directed, were by no\r\nmeans dismayed. They knew that although the king was constrained by\r\npopular clamour to levy war upon them, he was in secret friendly to\r\nthem; and they were, moreover, aware that the army of Argyle, who\r\nwas a youth of no military experience, was a raw and undisciplined\r\nmilitia, and composed, in a great measure, of Catholics, who could\r\nnot be expected to feel very warmly for the Protestant interest, to\r\nsupport which the expedition was professedly undertaken. The seeds of\r\ndisaffection, besides, had been already sown in Argyle’s camp by the\r\ncorruption of the Grants and Campbell of Lochnell.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of Argyle’s approach, the Earl of Errol immediately\r\ncollected a select body of about 100 horsemen, being gentlemen, on\r\nwhose courage and fidelity he could rely, and with these he joined\r\nthe Earl of Huntly at Strathbogie. The forces of Huntly, after\r\nthis junction, amounted, it is said, to nearly 1,500 men, almost\r\naltogether horsemen, and with this body he advanced to Carnborrow,\r\nwhere the two earls and their chief followers made a solemn vow\r\nto conquer or die. Marching from thence, Huntly’s army arrived at\r\nAuchindun on the same day that Argyle’s army reached Drummin. At\r\nAuchindun, Huntly received intelligence that Argyle was on the eve\r\nof descending from the mountains to the lowlands, which induced him,\r\non the following day, to send Captain Thomas Carr and a party of\r\nhorsemen to reconnoitre the enemy, while he himself advanced with\r\nhis main army. The reconnoitring party soon fell in, accidentally,\r\nwith Argyle’s scouts, whom they chased, and some of whom they killed.\r\nThis occurrence, which was looked upon as a prognostic of victory, so\r\nencouraged Huntly and his men, that he resolved to attack the army\r\nof Argyle before he should be joined by Lord Forbes, and the forces\r\nwhich were waiting for his appearance in the lowlands. Argyle had now\r\npassed Glenlivet, and had reached the banks of a small brook named\r\nAltchonlachan.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Earl of Argyle had no idea that the Earls of\r\nHuntly and Errol would attack him with such an inferior force; and\r\nhe was, therefore, astonished at seeing them approach so near him\r\nas they did. Apprehensive that his numerical superiority in foot\r\nwould be counterbalanced by Huntly’s cavalry, he held a council of\r\nwar, which advised Argyle to wait till the king, who had promised to\r\nappear with a force, should arrive, or, at all events, till he should\r\nbe joined by the Frasers and Mackenzies from the north, and the\r\nIrvings, Forbeses, and Leslies from the lowlands with their horse.\r\nThis opinion, which was considered judicious by the most experienced\r\nof Argyle’s army, was however disregarded by him, and he determined\r\nto wait the attack of the enemy; and to encourage his men he pointed\r\nout to them the small number of those they had to combat with, and\r\nthe spoils they might expect after victory. He disposed his army on\r\nthe declivity of a hill, betwixt Glenlivet and Glenrinnes, in two\r\nparallel divisions. The right wing, consisting of the Macleans and\r\nMacintoshes, was commanded by Sir Lauchlan Maclean and Macintosh--the\r\nleft, composed of the Grants, Macneills, and Macgregors, by Grant\r\nof Gartinbeg; and the centre, consisting of the Campbells, &c., was\r\ncommanded by Campbell of Auchinbreck. This vanguard consisted of\r\n4,000 men, one-half of whom carried muskets. The rear of the army,\r\nconsisting of about 6,000 men, was commanded by Argyle himself. The\r\nEarl of Huntly’s vanguard was composed of 300 gentlemen, led by the\r\nEarl of Errol, Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindun, the laird of Gight,\r\nthe laird of Bonnitoun, and Captain, afterwards Sir Thomas Carr.\r\nThe earl himself followed with the remainder of his forces, having\r\nthe laird of Cluny upon his right hand and the laird of Abergeldy\r\nupon his left. Three pieces of field ordnance under the direction\r\nof Captain Andrew Gray, afterwards colonel of the English and Scots\r\nwho served in Bohemia, were placed in front of the vanguard. Before\r\nadvancing, the Earl of Huntly harangued his little army to encourage\r\nthem to fight manfully; he told them that they had no alternative\r\nbefore them but victory or death--that they were now to combat, not\r\nfor their own lives only, but also for the very existence of their\r\nfamilies, which would be utterly extinguished if they fell a prey to\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\nThe position which Argyle occupied on the declivity of the hill gave\r\nhim a decided advantage over his assailants, who, from the nature of\r\ntheir force, were greatly hampered by the mossy nature of the ground\r\nat the foot of the hill, interspersed by pits from which turf had\r\nbeen dug. But, notwithstanding these obstacles, Huntly advanced up\r\nthe hill with a slow and steady pace. It had been arranged between\r\nhim and Campbell of Lochnell, who had promised to go over to Huntly\r\nas soon as the battle had commenced, that, before charging Argyle\r\nwith his cavalry, Huntly should fire his artillery at the yellow\r\nstandard. Campbell bore a mortal enmity at Argyle, as he had murdered\r\nhis brother, Campbell of Calder, in 1592; and as he was Argyle’s\r\nnearest heir, he probably had directed the firing at the yellow\r\nstandard in the hope of cutting off the earl. Unfortunately for\r\nhimself, however, Campbell was shot dead at the first fire of the\r\ncannon, and upon his fall all his men fled from the field. Macneill\r\nof Barra was also slain at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, who had never before seen field pieces, were thrown\r\ninto disorder by the cannonade, which being perceived by Huntly,\r\nhe charged the enemy, and rushing in among them with his horsemen,\r\nincreased the confusion. The Earl of Errol was directed to attack\r\nthe right wing of Argyle’s army, commanded by Maclean, but as it\r\noccupied a very steep part of the hill, and as Errol was greatly\r\nannoyed by thick volleys of shot from above, he was compelled to make\r\na detour, leaving the enemy on his left. But Gordon of Auchindun,\r\ndisdaining such a prudent course, galloped up the hill with a party\r\nof his own followers, and charged Maclean with great impetuosity;\r\nbut Auchindun’s rashness cost him his life. The fall of Auchindun\r\nso exasperated his followers that they set no bounds to their fury;\r\nbut Maclean received their repeated assaults with firmness, and\r\nmanœuvred his troops so well as to succeed in cutting off the Earl of\r\nErrol, and placing him between his own body and that of Argyle, by\r\nwhose joint forces he was completely surrounded. At this important\r\ncrisis, when no hopes of retreat remained, and when Errol and his\r\nmen were in danger of being cut to pieces, the Earl of Huntly, very\r\nfortunately, came up to his assistance and relieved him from his\r\nembarrassment. The battle was now renewed and continued for two\r\nhours, during which both parties fought with great bravery, “the\r\none,” says Sir Robert Gordon, “for glorie, the other for necessitie.”\r\nIn the heat of the action the Earl of Huntly had a horse shot under\r\nhim, and was in imminent danger of his life; but another horse was\r\nimmediately procured for him. After a hard contest the main body of\r\nArgyle’s army began to give way, and retreated towards the rivulet\r\nof Altchonlachan; but Maclean still kept the field, and continued\r\nto support the falling fortune of the day. At length, finding the\r\ncontest hopeless, and after losing many of his men, he retired in\r\ngood order with the small company that still remained about him.\r\nHuntly pursued the retiring foe beyond the water of Altchonlachan,\r\nwhen he was prevented from following them farther by the steepness of\r\nthe hills, so unfavourable to the operations of cavalry. The success\r\nof Huntly was mainly owing to the treachery of Lochnell, and of John\r\nGrant of Gartinbeg, one of Huntly’s vassals, who, in terms of a\r\nconcerted plan, retreated with his men as soon as the action began,\r\nby which act the centre and the left wing of Argyle’s army were\r\ncompletely broken. On the side of Argyle 500 men were killed besides\r\nMacneill of Barra, and Lochnell and Auchinbreck, the two cousins of\r\nArgyle. The Earl of Huntly’s loss was comparatively trifling. About\r\n14 gentlemen were slain, including Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindun,\r\nand the Laird of Gight; and the Earl of Errol and a considerable\r\nnumber of persons were wounded. At the conclusion of the battle\r\nthe conquerors returned thanks to God on the field for the victory\r\nthey had achieved. This battle is called by some writers the battle\r\nof Glenlivet, and by others the battle of Altchonlachan. Among the\r\ntrophies found on the field was the ensign belonging to the Earl\r\nof Argyle, which was carried with other spoils to Strathbogie, and\r\nplaced upon the top of the great tower. So certain had Argyle been of\r\nsuccess in his enterprise, that he had made out a paper apportioning\r\nthe lands of the Gordons, the Hays, and all who were suspected to\r\nfavour them, among the chief officers of his army. This document was\r\nfound among the baggage which he left behind him on the field of\r\nbattle.[190]\r\n\r\nAlthough Argyle certainly calculated upon being joined by the king,\r\nit seems doubtful if James ever entertained such an intention,\r\nfor he stopped at Dundee, from which he did not stir till he\r\nheard of the result of the battle of Glenlivet. Instigated by the\r\nministers and other enemies of the Earl of Huntly, who became now\r\nmore exasperated than ever at the unexpected failure of Argyle’s\r\nexpedition, the king proceeded north to Strathbogie, and in his\r\nroute he permitted, most unwillingly, the house of Craig in Angus,\r\nbelonging to Sir John Ogilvie, son of Lord Ogilvie, that of Bagaes in\r\nAngus, the property of Sir Walter Lindsay, the house of Culsalmond\r\nin Garioch, appertaining to the Laird of Newton-Gordon, the house of\r\nSlaines in Buchan, belonging to the Earl of Errol, and the castle\r\nof Strathbogie, to be razed to the ground, under the pretext that\r\npriests and Jesuits had been harboured in them. In the meantime the\r\nEarl of Huntly and his friends retired into Sutherland, where they\r\nremained six weeks with Earl Alexander; and on the king’s departure\r\nto Strathbogie, Huntly returned, leaving his eldest son George,\r\nLord Gordon, in Sutherland with his aunt, till the return of more\r\npeaceable times.\r\n\r\nThe king left the Duke of Lennox to act as his lieutenant in the\r\nnorth, with whom the two earls held a meeting at Aberdeen, and as\r\ntheir temporary absence from the kingdom might allay the spirit of\r\nviolence and discontent, which was particularly annoying to his\r\nmajesty, they agreed to leave the kingdom during the king’s pleasure.\r\nAfter spending sixteen months in travelling through Germany and\r\nFlanders, Huntly was recalled, and on his return he, as well as the\r\nEarls of Angus and Errol, were restored to their former honours and\r\nestates by the parliament, held at Edinburgh in November 1597, and in\r\ntestimony of his regard for Huntly, the king, two years thereafter,\r\ncreated him a marquis. This signal mark of the royal favour had such\r\nan influence upon the clan Chattan, the clan Kenzie, the Grants,\r\nForbeses, Leslies, and other hostile clans and tribes, that they at\r\nonce submitted themselves to the marquis.\r\n\r\nThe warlike operations in the north seem, for a time, to have drawn\r\noff the attention of the clans from their own feuds; but in the year\r\n1597 a tumult occurred at Loggiewreid in Ross, which had almost put\r\nthat province and the adjoining country into a flame. The quarrel\r\nbegan between John Mac-Gille-Calum, brother of Gille-Calum, Laird\r\nof Rasay, and Alexander Bane, brother of Duncan Bane of Tulloch, in\r\nRoss. The Monroes took the side of the Banes, and the Mackenzies\r\naided John Mac-Gille-Calum. In this tumult John Mac-Gille-Calum and\r\nJohn Mac-Murthow-Mac-William, a gentleman of the clan Kenzie, and\r\nthree persons of that surname, were killed on the one side, and on\r\nthe other were slain John Monroe of Culcraigie, his brother Houcheon\r\nMonroe, and John Monroe Robertson. This occurrence renewed the\r\nancient animosity between the clan Kenzie and the Monroes, and both\r\nparties began to assemble their friends for the purpose of attacking\r\none another; but their differences were in some measure happily\r\nreconciled by the mediation of common friends.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the ambition and avarice of Sir Lauchlan\r\nMaclean, of whom notice has been already taken, brought him to an\r\nuntimely end, having been slain in Islay by Sir James Macdonald, his\r\nnephew, eldest son of Angus Macdonald of Kintyre. Sir Lauchlan had\r\nlong had an eye upon the possessions of the clan Ronald in Islay; but\r\nhaving failed in extorting a conveyance thereof from Angus Macdonald\r\nin the way before alluded to, he endeavoured, by his credit at court\r\nand by bribery or other means, to obtain a grant of these lands from\r\nthe crown in 1595. At this period Angus Macdonald had become infirm\r\nfrom age, and his son, Sir James Macdonald, was too young to make any\r\neffectual resistance to the newly acquired claims of his covetous\r\nuncle. After obtaining the gift, Sir Lauchlan collected his people\r\nand friends, and invaded Islay, for the purpose of taking possession\r\nof the lands which belonged to the clan Donald. Sir James Macdonald,\r\non hearing of his uncle’s landing, collected his friends, and landed\r\nin Islay to dispossess Sir Lauchlan of the property. To prevent the\r\neffusion of blood, some common friends of the parties interposed,\r\nand endeavoured to bring about an adjustment of their differences.\r\nThey prevailed upon Sir James to agree to resign the half of the\r\nisland to his uncle during the life of the latter, provided he would\r\nacknowledge that he held the same for personal service to the clan\r\nDonald in the same manner as Maclean’s progenitors had always held\r\nthe Rhinns of Islay; and he moreover offered to submit the question\r\nto any impartial friends Maclean might choose, under this reasonable\r\ncondition, that in case they should not agree, his Majesty should\r\ndecide. But Maclean, contrary to the advice of his best friends,\r\nwould listen to no proposals short of an absolute surrender of the\r\nwhole of the island. Sir James therefore resolved to vindicate his\r\nright by an appeal to arms, though his force was far inferior to\r\nthat of Sir Lauchlan. A desperate struggle took place, in which\r\ngreat valour was displayed on both sides. Sir Lauchlan was killed\r\nfighting at the head of his men, who were at length compelled to\r\nretreat to their boats and vessels. Besides their chief, the Macleans\r\nleft 80 of their principal men and 200 common soldiers dead on the\r\nfield of battle. Lauchlan Barroch-Maclean, son of Sir Lauchlan, was\r\ndangerously wounded, but escaped. Sir James Macdonald was also so\r\nseverely wounded that he never fully recovered from his wounds. About\r\n30 of the clan Donald were killed and about 60 wounded. Sir Lauchlan,\r\naccording to Sir Robert Gordon, had consulted a witch before he\r\nundertook this journey into Islay, who advised him, in the first\r\nplace, not to land upon the island on a Thursday; secondly, that he\r\nshould not drink of the water of a well near Groynard; and lastly,\r\nshe told him that one Maclean should be slain at Groynard. “The\r\nfirst he transgressed unwillingly,” says Sir Robert, “being driven\r\ninto the island of Ila by a tempest upon a Thursday; the second he\r\ntransgressed negligentlie, haveing drank of that water befor he wes\r\nawair; and so he wes killed ther at Groinard, as wes foretold him,\r\nbot doubtfullie. Thus endeth all these that doe trust in such kynd of\r\nresponces, or doe hunt after them!”[191]\r\n\r\nOn hearing of Maclean’s death and the defeat of his men, the king\r\nbecame so highly incensed against the clan Donald that, finding\r\nhe had a right to dispose of their possessions both in Kintyre\r\nand Islay, he made a grant of them to the Earl of Argyle and the\r\nCampbells. This gave rise to a number of bloody conflicts between the\r\nCampbells and the clan Donald in the years 1614, -15, and -16, which\r\nended in the ruin of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rival houses of Sutherland and Caithness had now lived on\r\nfriendly terms for some years. After spending about eighteen months\r\nat court, and attending a convention of the estates at Edinburgh in\r\nJuly, 1598, John, sixth Earl of Sutherland, went to the Continent,\r\nwhere he remained till the month of September, 1600. The Earl of\r\nCaithness, deeming the absence of the Earl of Sutherland a fit\r\nopportunity for carrying into effect some designs against him,\r\ncaused William Mackay to obtain leave from his brother Houcheon\r\nMackay to hunt in the policy of Durines belonging to the Earl of\r\nSutherland. The Earl of Caithness thereupon assembled all his\r\nvassals and dependents, and, under the pretence of hunting, made\r\ndemonstrations for entering Sutherland or Strathnaver. As soon as\r\nMackay was informed of his intentions, he sent a message to the\r\nEarl of Caithness, intimating to him that he would not permit him\r\nto enter either of these countries, or to cross the marches. The\r\nEarl of Caithness returned a haughty answer; but he did not carry\r\nhis threat of invasion into execution on account of the arrival of\r\nthe Earl of Sutherland from the Continent. As the Earl of Caithness\r\nstill continued to threaten an invasion, the Earl of Sutherland\r\ncollected his forces, in the month of July 1601, to oppose him.\r\nMackay, with his countrymen, soon joined the Earl of Sutherland at\r\nLagan-Gaincamhd in Dirichat, where he was soon also joined by the\r\nMonroes under Robert Monroe of Contaligh, and the laird of Assynt\r\nwith his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhile the Earl of Sutherland’s force was thus assembling, the Earl\r\nof Caithness advanced towards Sutherland with his army. The two\r\narmies encamped at the distance of about three miles asunder, near\r\nthe hill of Bengrime. In expectation of a battle on the morning\r\nafter their encampment, the Sutherland men took up a position in a\r\nplain which lay between the two armies, called Leathad Reidh, than\r\nwhich a more convenient station could not have been selected. But\r\nthe commodiousness of the plain was not the only reason for making\r\nthe selection. There had been long a prophetic tradition in these\r\ncountries that a battle was to be fought on this ground between\r\nthe inhabitants of Sutherland, assisted by the Strathnaver men,\r\nand the men of Caithness; that although the Sutherland men were to\r\nbe victorious their loss would be great, and that the loss of the\r\nStrathnaver men should even be greater, but that the Caithness men\r\nshould be so completely overthrown that they should not be able, for\r\na considerable length of time, to recover the blow which they were\r\nto receive. This superstitious idea made such an impression upon the\r\nminds of the men of Sutherland that it was with great difficulty they\r\ncould be restrained from immediately attacking their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, daunted by this circumstance, and being\r\ndiffident of the fidelity of some of his people, whom he had used\r\nwith great cruelty, sent messengers to the Earl of Sutherland\r\nexpressing his regret at what had happened, stating that he was\r\nprovoked to his present measures by the insolence of Mackay, who\r\nhad repeatedly dared him to the attack, and that, if the Earl of\r\nSutherland would pass over the affair, he would permit him and his\r\narmy to advance twice as far into Caithness as he had marched into\r\nSutherland. The Earl of Sutherland, on receipt of this offer, called\r\na council of his friends to deliberate upon it. Mackay and some\r\nothers advised the earl to decline the proposal, and attack the Earl\r\nof Caithness; while others of the earl’s advisers thought it neither\r\nfit nor reasonable to risk so many lives when such ample satisfaction\r\nwas offered. A sort of middle course was, therefore, adopted by\r\ngiving the Earl of Caithness an opportunity to escape if he inclined.\r\nThe messengers were accordingly sent back with this answer, that if\r\nthe Earl of Caithness and his army would remain where they lay till\r\nsunrise next morning they might be assured of an attack.\r\n\r\nWhen this answer was delivered in the Earl of Caithness’ camp, his\r\nmen got so alarmed that the earl, with great difficulty, prevented\r\nthem from running away immediately. He remained on the field all\r\nnight watching them in person, encouraging them to remain, and making\r\ngreat promises to them if they stood firm. But his entreaties were\r\nquite unavailing, for as soon as the morning dawned, on perceiving\r\nthe approach of the Earl of Sutherland’s army, they fled from the\r\nfield in the utmost confusion, jostling and overthrowing one another\r\nin their flight, and leaving their whole baggage behind them. The\r\nEarl of Sutherland resolved to pursue the flying enemy; but, before\r\nproceeding on the pursuit, his army collected a quantity of stones\r\nwhich they accumulated into a heap to commemorate the flight of the\r\nCaithness men, which heap was called Carn-Teiche, that is, the Flight\r\nCairn.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to encounter the Earl of Sutherland under the adverse\r\ncircumstances which had occurred, the Earl of Caithness, after\r\nentering his own territories, sent a message to his pursuer to the\r\neffect that having complied with his request in withdrawing his\r\narmy, he hoped hostile proceedings would cease, and that if the Earl\r\nof Sutherland should advance with his army into Caithness, Earl\r\nGeorge would not hinder him; but he suggested to him the propriety of\r\nappointing some gentlemen on both sides to see the respective armies\r\ndissolved. The Earl of Sutherland acceded to this proposal, and sent\r\nGeorge Gray of Cuttle, eldest son of Gilbert Gray of Sordell, with a\r\ncompany of resolute men into Caithness to see the army of the Earl of\r\nCaithness broken up. The Earl of Caithness, in his turn, despatched\r\nAlexander Bane, chief of the Caithness Banes, who witnessed the\r\ndismissal of the Earl of Sutherland’s army.[192]\r\n\r\nAbout the period in question, great commotions took place in the\r\nnorth-west isles, in consequence of a quarrel between Donald Gorm\r\nMacdonald of Slate, and Sir Roderick Macleod of Harris, arising\r\nout of the following circumstances. Donald Gorm Macdonald, who had\r\nmarried the sister of Sir Roderick, instigated by jealousy, had\r\nconceived displeasure at her and put her away. Having complained\r\nto her brother of the treatment thus received, Sir Roderick sent a\r\nmessage to Macdonald requiring him to take back his wife. Instead of\r\ncomplying with this request, Macdonald brought an action of divorce\r\nagainst her, and having obtained decree therein, married the sister\r\nof Kenneth Mackenzie, lord of Kintail. Sir Roderick, who considered\r\nhimself disgraced and his family dishonoured by such proceedings,\r\nassembled all his countrymen and his tribe, the Siol-Thormaid,\r\nwithout delay, and invaded with fire and sword the lands of Macdonald\r\nin the isle of Skye, to which he laid claim as his own. Macdonald\r\nretaliated by landing in Harris with his forces, which he laid waste,\r\nand after killing some of the inhabitants retired with a large booty\r\nin cattle. To make amends for this loss, Sir Roderick invaded Uist,\r\nwhich belonged to Macdonald, and despatched his cousin, Donald Glas\r\nMacleod, with 40 men, into the interior, to lay the island waste, and\r\nto carry off a quantity of goods and cattle, which the inhabitants\r\nhad placed within the precincts of the church of Killtrynard as a\r\nsanctuary. This exploit turned out to be very serious, as Donald\r\nMacleod and his party were most unexpectedly attacked in the act of\r\ncarrying off their prey, by John Mac-Iain-Mhic-Sheumais, a kinsman of\r\nMacdonald, at the head of a body of 12 men who had remained in the\r\nisland, by whom Donald Macleod and the greater part of his men were\r\ncut to pieces, and the booty rescued. Sir Roderick, thinking that the\r\nforce which had attacked his cousin was much greater than it was,\r\nretired from the island, intending to return on a future day with a\r\ngreater force to revenge his loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACLEOD AND MACKENZIE, 71^{ST} AND 78^{TH}. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nThis odious system of warfare continued till the hostile parties had\r\nalmost exterminated one another; and to such extremities were they\r\nreduced by the ruin and desolation which followed, that they were\r\ncompelled to eat horses, dogs, cats, and other animals, to preserve\r\na miserable existence. To put an end, if possible, at once to this\r\ndestructive contest, Macdonald collected all his remaining forces,\r\nwith the determination of striking a decisive blow at his opponent;\r\nand accordingly, in the year 1601, he entered Sir Roderick’s\r\nterritories with the design of bringing him to battle. Sir Roderick\r\nwas then in Argyle, soliciting aid and advice from the Earl of Argyle\r\nagainst the clan Donald; but on hearing of the approach of Macdonald,\r\nAlexander Macleod, brother of Sir Roderick, resolved to try the\r\nresult of a battle. Assembling, therefore, all the inhabitants of his\r\nbrother’s lands, together with the whole tribe of the Siol-Thormaid,\r\nand some of the Siol-Thorquill, he encamped close by the hill of\r\nBenquhillin, in Skye, resolved to give battle to the clan Donald\r\nnext morning. Accordingly, on the arrival of morning, an obstinate\r\nand deadly fight took place, which lasted the whole day, each side\r\ncontending with the utmost valour for victory; but at length the clan\r\nDonald overthrew their opponents. Alexander Macleod was wounded and\r\ntaken prisoner, along with Neill-Mac-Alastair-Ruaidh, and 30 others\r\nof the choicest men of the Siol-Thormaid. Iain-Mac-Thormaid and\r\nThormaid-Mac-Thormaid, two near kinsmen of Sir Roderick, and several\r\nothers, were slain.\r\n\r\nAfter this affair, a reconciliation took place between Macdonald and\r\nSir Roderick, at the solicitation of old Angus Macdonald of Kintyre,\r\nthe laird of Coll, and other friends, when Macdonald delivered up to\r\nSir Roderick the prisoners he had taken at Benquhillin; but although\r\nthese parties never again showed any open hostility, they brought\r\nseveral actions at law against each other, the one claiming from the\r\nother certain parts of his possessions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[188] Sir R.

To put an end to\r\nthese dissensions, Alexander Macgregor left Rannoch, accompanied by\r\nabout 200 of his kinsmen and friends, entered Lennox, and took up\r\nhis quarters on the confines of Luss’s territory, where he expected,\r\nby the mediation of his friends, to bring matters to an amicable\r\nadjustment. As the laird of Luss was suspicious of Macgregor’s\r\nreal intentions, he assembled all his vassals, with the Buchanans\r\nand others, to the number of 300 horse and 500 foot, designing,\r\nif the result of the meeting should not turn out according to his\r\nexpectations and wishes, to cut off Macgregor and his party. But\r\nMacgregor, anticipating Colquhon’s intention, was upon his guard,\r\nand, by his precautions, defeated the design upon him. A conference\r\nwas held for the purpose of terminating all differences, but the\r\nmeeting broke up without any adjustment: Macgregor then proceeded\r\nhomewards. The laird of Luss, in pursuance of his plan, immediately\r\nfollowed Macgregor with great haste through Glenfreon, in the\r\nexpectation of coming upon him unawares, and defeating him; but\r\nMacgregor, who was on the alert, observed, in due time, the approach\r\nof his pursuers, and made his preparations accordingly. He divided\r\nhis company into two parts, the largest of which he kept under his\r\nown command, and placed the other part under the command of John\r\nMacgregor, his brother, whom he despatched by a circuitous route,\r\nfor the purpose of attacking Luss’s party in the rear, when they\r\nshould least expect to be assailed. This stratagem succeeded, and the\r\nresult was, that after a keen contest, Luss’s party was completely\r\noverthrown, with the loss of 200 men, besides several gentlemen and\r\nburgesses of the town of Dumbarton. It is remarkable that of the\r\nMacgregors, John, the brother of Alexander, and another person, were\r\nthe only killed, though some of the party were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe laird of Luss and his friends sent early notice of their disaster\r\nto the king, and by misrepresenting the whole affair to him, and\r\nexhibiting to his majesty eleven score bloody shirts, belonging\r\nto those of their party who were slain, the king grew exceedingly\r\nincensed at the clan Gregor, who had no person about the king to\r\nplead their cause, proclaimed them rebels, and interdicted all the\r\nlieges from harbouring or having any communication with them. The\r\nEarl of Argyle, with the Campbells, was afterwards sent against the\r\nproscribed clan, and hunted them through the country. About 60 of\r\nthe clan made a brave stand at Bentoik against a party of 200 chosen\r\nmen belonging to the clan Cameron, clan Nab, and clan Ronald, under\r\nthe command of Robert Campbell, son of the laird of Glenorchy, when\r\nDuncan Aberigh, one of the chieftains of the clan Gregor, and his\r\nson Duncan, and seven gentlemen of Campbell’s party were killed.\r\nBut although they made a brave resistance, and killed many of their\r\npursuers, the Macgregors, after many skirmishes and great losses,\r\nwere at last overcome. Commissions were thereafter sent through the\r\nkingdom, for fining those who had harboured any of the clan, and for\r\npunishing all persons who had kept up any communication with them,\r\nand the fines so levied were given by the king to the Earl of Argyle,\r\nas a recompense for his services against the unfortunate Macgregors.\r\n\r\nAlexander Macgregor, the chief, after suffering many vicissitudes\r\nof fortune, at last surrendered himself to the Earl of Argyle, on\r\ncondition that he should grant him a safe conduct into England to\r\nKing James, that he might lay before his majesty a true state of the\r\nwhole affair from the commencement, and crave the royal mercy; and\r\nas a security for his return to Scotland, he delivered up to Argyle\r\nthirty of his choicest men as hostages. But no sooner had Macgregor\r\narrived at Berwick on his way to London, than he was basely arrested,\r\nbrought back by the earl to Edinburgh, and, by his influence,\r\nexecuted along with the thirty hostages. Argyle hoped, by these\r\nmeans, ultimately to annihilate the whole clan; but in this cruel\r\ndesign he was quite disappointed, for the clan speedily increased,\r\nand became almost as powerful as before.[193]\r\n\r\nWhile the Highland borders were thus disturbed by the warfare\r\nbetween the Macgregors and the Colquhouns, a commotion happened in\r\nthe interior of the Highlands, in consequence of a quarrel between\r\nthe clan Kenzie and the laird of Glengarry, who, according to Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, was “unexpert and unskilfull in the lawes of the\r\nrealme.” From his want of knowledge of the law, the clan Kenzie are\r\nsaid by the same writer to have “easalie intrapped him within the\r\ncompas thereof,” certainly by no means a difficult matter in those\r\nlawless times; they then procured a warrant for citing him to appear\r\nbefore the justiciary court at Edinburgh, which they took good\r\ncare should not be served upon him personally. Either not knowing\r\nof these legal proceedings, or neglecting the summons, Glengarry\r\ndid not appear at Edinburgh on the day appointed, but went about\r\nrevenging the slaughter of two of his kinsmen, whom the clan Kenzie\r\nhad killed after the summons for Glengarry’s appearance had been\r\nissued. The consequence was that Glengarry and some of his followers\r\nwere outlawed. Through the interest of the Earl of Dunfermline, lord\r\nchancellor of Scotland, Kenneth Mackenzie, afterwards created Lord\r\nKintail, obtained a commission against Glengarry and his people,\r\nwhich occasioned great trouble and much slaughter. Being assisted by\r\nmany followers from the neighbouring country, Mackenzie, by virtue of\r\nhis commission, invaded Glengarry’s territories, which he mercilessly\r\nwasted and destroyed with fire and sword. On his return, Mackenzie\r\nbesieged the castle of Strome, which ultimately surrendered to him.\r\nTo assist Mackenzie in this expedition, the Earl of Sutherland, in\r\ntoken of the ancient friendship which had subsisted between his\r\nfamily and the Mackenzies, sent 240 well equipped and able men,\r\nunder the command of John Gordon of Embo. Mackenzie again returned\r\ninto Glengarry, where he had a skirmish with a party commanded by\r\nGlengarry’s eldest son, in which the latter and 60 of his followers\r\nwere slain. The Mackenzies also suffered some loss on this occasion.\r\nAt last, after much trouble and bloodshed on both sides, an agreement\r\nwas entered into, by which Glengarry renounced in favour of Kenneth\r\nMackenzie, the castle of Strome and the adjacent lands.[194]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1605, the peace of the northern Highlands was\r\nsomewhat disturbed by one of those atrocious occurrences so\r\ncommon at that time. The chief of the Mackays had a servant named\r\nAlastair-Mac-Uilleam-Mhoir. This man having some business to\r\ntransact in Caithness, went there without the least apprehension\r\nof danger, as the Earls of Sutherland and Caithness had settled\r\nall their differences. No sooner, however, did the latter hear\r\nof Mac-Uilleam-Mhoir’s arrival in Caithness, than he sent Henry\r\nSinclair, his bastard brother, with a party of men to kill him.\r\nMac-Uilleam-Mhoir, being a bold and resolute man, was not openly\r\nattacked by Sinclair; but on entering the house where the former\r\nhad taken up his residence, Sinclair and his party pretended that\r\nthey had come on a friendly visit to him to enjoy themselves in his\r\ncompany. Not suspecting their hostile intentions, Alister invited\r\nthem to sit down and drink with him; but scarcely had they taken\r\ntheir seats when they seized Mac-Uilleam-Mhoir, and carried him off\r\nprisoner to the Earl of Caithness, who caused him to be beheaded in\r\nhis own presence, the following day. The fidelity of this unfortunate\r\nman to Mackay, his master, during the disputes between the Earls\r\nof Sutherland and Caithness, was the cause for which he suffered.\r\nMackay, resolved upon getting the earl punished, entered a legal\r\nprosecution against him at Edinburgh, but by the mediation of the\r\nMarquis of Huntly the suit was quashed.[195]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1605, a murder was committed in Strathnaver, by\r\nRobert Gray of Hopsdale or Ospisdell, the victim being Angus\r\nMac-Kenneth-Mac-Alister, one of the Siol-Mhurchaidh-Rhiabhaich. The\r\ncircumstances leading to this will illustrate the utterly lawless\r\nand insecure state of the Highlands at this time. John Gray of Skibo\r\nheld the lands of Ardinsh under John, the fifth of that name, Earl\r\nof Sutherland, as superior, which lands the grandfather of Angus\r\nMac-Kenneth had in possession from John Mackay, son of Y-Roy-Mackay,\r\nwho, before the time of this Earl John, possessed some lands in\r\nBreachat. When John Gray obtained the grant of Ardinsh from John\r\nthe fifth, he allowed Kenneth Mac-Alister, the father of Angus\r\nMac-Kenneth, to retain possession thereof, which he continued to\r\ndo till about the year 1573. About this period a variance arose\r\nbetween John Gray and Hugh Murray of Aberscors, in consequence of\r\nsome law-suits which they carried on against one another; but they\r\nwere reconciled by Alexander, Earl of Sutherland, who became bound\r\nto pay a sum of money to John Gray, for Hugh Murray, who was in the\r\nmeantime to get possession of the lands of Ardinsh in security. As\r\nJohn Gray still retained the property and kept Kenneth Mac-Alister in\r\nthe possession thereof at the old rent, the Murrays took umbrage at\r\nhim, and prevailed upon the Earl of Sutherland to grant a conveyance\r\nof the wadset or mortgage over Ardinsh in favour of Angus Murray,\r\nformerly bailie of Dornoch. In the meantime, Kenneth Mac-Alister\r\ndied, leaving his son, Angus Mac-Kenneth, in possession. Angus Murray\r\nhaving acquired the mortgage, now endeavoured to raise the rent\r\nof Ardinsh, but Angus Mac-Kenneth refusing to pay more than his\r\nfather had paid, was dispossessed, and the lands were let to William\r\nMac-Iain-Mac-Kenneth, cousin of Angus Mac-Kenneth. This proceeding so\r\nexasperated Angus that he murdered his cousin William Mac-Kenneth,\r\nhis wife, and two sons, under cloud of night, and so determined was\r\nhe that no other person should possess the lands but himself, that\r\nhe killed no less than nine other persons, who had successively\r\nendeavoured to occupy them. No others being disposed to occupy\r\nArdinsh at the risk of their lives, and Angus Murray getting wearied\r\nof his possession, resigned his right to Gilbert Gray of Skibo, on\r\nthe death of John Gray, his father. Gilbert thereafter conveyed the\r\nproperty to Robert Gray of Ospisdell, his second son; but Robert,\r\nbeing disinclined to allow Angus Mac-Kenneth, who had again obtained\r\npossession, to continue tenant, he dispossessed him, and let the\r\nland to one Finlay Logan, but this new tenant was murdered by\r\nMac-Kenneth in the year 1604. Mac-Kenneth then fled into Strathnaver\r\nwith a party composed of persons of desperate and reckless passions\r\nlike himself, with the intention of annoying Robert Gray by their\r\nincursions. Gray having ascertained that they were in the parish of\r\nCreigh, he immediately attacked them and killed Murdo Mac-Kenneth,\r\nthe brother of Angus, who made a narrow escape, and again retired\r\ninto Strathnaver. Angus again returned into Sutherland in May 1605,\r\nand, in the absence of Robert Gray, burnt his stable, with some\r\nof his cattle, at Ospisdell. Gray then obtained a warrant against\r\nMac-Kenneth, and having procured the assistance of a body of men from\r\nJohn Earl of Sutherland, entered Strathnaver and attacked Mac-Kenneth\r\nat the Cruffs of Hoip, and slew him.[196]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, disliking the unquiet state in which he had\r\nfor some time been forced to remain, made another attempt, in the\r\nmonth of July, 1607, to hunt in Bengrime, without asking permission\r\nfrom the Earl of Sutherland; but he was prevented from accomplishing\r\nhis purpose by the sudden appearance in Strathully of the latter,\r\nattended by his friend Mackay, and a considerable body of their\r\ncountrymen. Almost the whole of the inhabitants of Dornoch turned\r\nout on this occasion, and went to Strathully. During their absence\r\na quarrel ensued in the town between one John Macphaill and three\r\nbrothers of the name of Pope, in which one of the latter was killed;\r\nthe circumstances leading to and attending which quarrel were\r\nthese:--In the year 1585, William Pope, a native of Ross, settled\r\nin Sutherland, and being a man of good education, was appointed\r\nschoolmaster in Dornoch, and afterwards became its resident minister.\r\nHe also received another clerical appointment in Caithness, by means\r\nof which, and of his other living, he became, in course of time,\r\nwealthy. This good success induced two younger brothers, Charles\r\nand Thomas, to leave their native country and settle in Sutherland.\r\nThomas was soon made chancellor of Caithness and minister of\r\nRogart. Charles became a notary public and a messenger-at-arms; and\r\nhaving, by his good conduct and agreeable conversation, ingratiated\r\nhimself with the Earl of Sutherland, was appointed to the office of\r\nsheriff-clerk of Sutherland. The brothers soon acquired considerable\r\nwealth, which they laid out in the purchase of houses in the town\r\nof Dornoch, where they chiefly resided. Many of the inhabitants\r\nof the town envied their acquisitions, and took every occasion to\r\ninsult them as intruders, who had a design, as they supposed, to\r\ndrive the ancient inhabitants of the place from their possessions.\r\nOn the occasion in question William and Thomas Pope, along with\r\nother ministers, had held a meeting at Dornoch on church affairs,\r\non dissolving which they went to breakfast at an inn. While at\r\nbreakfast, John Macphaill entered the house, and demanded some\r\nliquor from the mistress of the inn, but she refused to give him\r\nany, as she knew him to be a troublesome and quarrelsome person.\r\nMacphaill, irritated at the refusal, spoke harshly to the woman, and\r\nthe ministers having made some excuse for her, Macphaill vented his\r\nabuse upon them. Being threatened by Thomas Pope, for his insolence,\r\nhe pushed an arrow with a barbed head, which he held in his hand,\r\ninto one of Pope’s arms. The parties then separated, but the two\r\nPopes being observed walking in the churchyard in the evening, with\r\ntheir swords girt about them, by Macphaill, who looked upon their so\r\narming themselves as a threat, he immediately made the circumstance\r\nknown to Houcheon Macphaill, his nephew, and one William Murray, all\r\nof whom entered the churchyard and assailed the two brothers with\r\nthe most vituperative abuse. Charles Pope, learning the danger his\r\nbrothers were in, immediately hastened to the spot, where he found\r\nthe two parties engaged. Charles attacked Murray, whom he wounded in\r\nthe face, whereupon Murray instantly killed him. William and Thomas\r\nwere grievously wounded by Macphaill and his nephew, and left for\r\ndead, but they ultimately recovered. Macphaill and his nephew fled\r\nto Holland, where they ended their days. After this occurrence, the\r\nsurviving brothers left Sutherland and went back into their own\r\ncountry. It is only by recording such comparatively unimportant\r\nincidents as this, apparently somewhat beneath the dignity of\r\nhistory, that a knowledge of the real state of the Highlands at this\r\ntime can be conveyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dornoch, showing the Cathedral and the remaining tower\r\nof the old Castle.]\r\n\r\nBy the mediation of the Marquis of Huntly, the Earls of Caithness\r\nand Sutherland again met at Elgin with their mutual friends, and\r\nonce more adjusted their differences. On this occasion the Earl\r\nof Sutherland was accompanied by large parties of the Gordons,\r\nthe Frasers, the Dunbars, the clan Kenzie, the Monroes, the\r\nclan Chattan, and other friends, which so displeased the Earl of\r\nCaithness, who was grieved to see his rival so honourably attended,\r\nthat he could never afterwards be induced to meet again with the Earl\r\nof Sutherland or any of his family.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1608 a quarrel occurred in Sutherland between Iver\r\nMac-Donald-Mac-Alister, one of the Siol-Thomais, and Alexander Murray\r\nin Auchindough. Iver and his eldest son, John, meeting one day with\r\nAlexander Murray and his son, Thomas, an altercation took place on\r\nsome questions in dispute. From words they proceeded to blows, and\r\nthe result was that John, the son of Iver, and Alexander Murray were\r\nkilled. Iver then fled into Strathnaver, whither he was followed\r\nby Thomas Murray, accompanied by a party of 24 men, to revenge\r\nthe death of his father. Iver, however, avoided them, and having\r\nassembled some friends, he attacked Murray unawares, at the hill of\r\nBinchlibrig, and compelled him to flee, after taking five of his\r\nmen prisoners, whom he released after a captivity of five days. As\r\nthe chief of the Mackays protected Iver, George Murray of Pulrossie\r\ntook up the quarrel, and annoyed Iver and his party; but the matter\r\nwas compromised by Mackay, who paid a sum of money to Pulrossie and\r\nThomas Murray, as a reparation for divers losses they had sustained\r\nat Iver’s hands during his outlawry. This compromise was the more\r\nreadily entered into by Pulrossie, as the Earl of Sutherland was\r\nrather favourable to Iver, and was by no means displeased at him for\r\nthe injuries he did to Pulrossie, who had not acted dutifully towards\r\nhim. Besides having lost his own son in the quarrel, who was killed\r\nby Thomas Murray, Iver was unjustly dealt with in being made the sole\r\nobject of persecution.[197]\r\n\r\nA civil dissension occurred about this time in Moray among the\r\nDunbars, which nearly proved fatal to that family. To understand the\r\norigin of this dispute it is necessary to state the circumstances\r\nwhich led to it, and to go back to the period when Patrick\r\nDunbar, sheriff of Moray, and tutor and uncle of Alexander Dunbar\r\nof Westfield, was killed, along with the Earl of Murray, at\r\nDonnibristle. Alexander did not enjoy his inheritance long, having\r\ndied at Dunkeld, shortly after the death of his uncle, under\r\ncircumstances which led to a suspicion that he had been poisoned.\r\nAs he died without leaving any issue, he was succeeded by Alexander\r\nDunbar, son of the above-mentioned Patrick, by a sister of Robert\r\nDunbar of Burgy. This Alexander was a young man of great promise,\r\nand was directed in all his proceedings by his uncle Robert Dunbar\r\nof Burgy. Patrick Dunbar of Blery and Kilbuyack and his family,\r\nimagining that Robert Dunbar, to whom they bore a grudge, was giving\r\nadvice to his nephew to their prejudice, conceived a deadly enmity\r\nat both, and seized every occasion to annoy the sheriff of Moray and\r\nhis uncle. An accidental meeting having taken place between Robert\r\nDunbar, brother of Alexander, and William Dunbar, son of Blery, high\r\nwords were exchanged, and a scuffle ensued, in which William Dunbar\r\nreceived considerable injury in his person. Patrick Dunbar and his\r\nsons were so incensed at this occurrence that they took up arms and\r\nattacked their chief, Alexander Dunbar, sheriff of Moray, in the town\r\nof Forres, where he was shot dead by Robert Dunbar, son of Blery.\r\nJohn Dunbar, sheriff of Moray, who succeeded his brother Alexander,\r\nand his brother, Robert Dunbar of Burgy, endeavoured to bring the\r\nmurderers of his brother to justice; but they failed in consequence\r\nof Alexander Dunbar being, at the time of his death, a rebel to\r\nthe king, having been denounced at the horn for a civil cause. By\r\nnegotiation, however, this deadly feud was stayed, and a sort of\r\nreconciliation effected by the friendly mediation of the Earl of\r\nDunfermline, then Lord Chancellor of Scotland.[198]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1610 the Earl of Caithness and Houcheon Mackay, chief\r\nof the Mackays, had a difference in consequence of the protection\r\ngiven by the latter to a gentleman named John Sutherland, the son\r\nof Mackay’s sister. Sutherland lived in Berridale, under the Earl\r\nof Caithness, but he was so molested by the earl that he lost all\r\npatience, and went about avenging the injuries he had sustained.\r\nThe earl, therefore, cited him to appear at Edinburgh to answer\r\nto certain charges made against him; but not obeying the summons,\r\nhe was denounced and proclaimed a rebel to the king. Reduced, in\r\nconsequence, to great extremities, and seeing no remedy by which he\r\ncould retrieve himself, he became an outlaw, wasted and destroyed the\r\nearl’s country, and carried off herds of cattle, which he transported\r\ninto Strathnaver, the country of his kinsman. The earl thereupon sent\r\na party of the Siol-Mhic-Imheair to attack him, and, after a long\r\nsearch, they found him encamped near the water of Shin in Sutherland.\r\nHe, however, was aware of their approach before they perceived him,\r\nand, taking advantage of this circumstance, attacked them in the act\r\nof crossing the water. They were in consequence defeated, leaving\r\nseveral of their party dead on the field.\r\n\r\nThis disaster exasperated the earl, who resolved to prosecute Mackay\r\nand his son, Donald Mackay, for giving succour and protection within\r\ntheir country to John Sutherland, an outlaw. Accordingly, he served\r\nboth of them with a notice to appear before the Privy Council to\r\nanswer to the charges he had preferred against them. Mackay at\r\nonce obeyed the summons, and went to Edinburgh, where he met Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, who had come from England for the express purpose\r\nof assisting Mackay on the present occasion. The earl, who had\r\ngrown tired of the troubles which John Sutherland had occasioned\r\nin his country, was induced, by the entreaties of friends, to\r\nsettle matters on the following conditions:--That he should forgive\r\nJohn Sutherland all past injuries, and restore him to his former\r\npossessions; that John Sutherland and his brother Donald should be\r\ndelivered, the one after the other, into the hands of the earl, to be\r\nkept prisoners for a certain time; and that Donald Mac-Thomais-Mhoir,\r\none of the Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, and a follower of John Sutherland\r\nin his depredations, should be also delivered up to the earl to be\r\ndealt with as to him should seem meet; all of which stipulations were\r\ncomplied with. The earl hanged Donald Mac-Thomais as soon as he was\r\ndelivered up. John Sutherland was kept a prisoner at Girnigo about\r\ntwelve months, during which time Donald Mackay made several visits to\r\nEarl George for the purpose of getting him released, in which he at\r\nlast succeeded, besides procuring a discharge to Donald Sutherland,\r\nwho, in his turn, should have surrendered himself as prisoner on\r\nthe release of his brother John, but upon the condition that he\r\nand his father, Houcheon Mackay, should pass the next following\r\nChristmas with the earl at Girnigo. Mackay and his brother William,\r\naccordingly, spent their Christmas at Girnigo, but Donald Mackay\r\nwas prevented by business from attending. The design of the Earl of\r\nCaithness in thus favouring Mackay, was to separate him from the\r\ninterests of the Earl of Sutherland, but he was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nSome years before the events we have just related, a commotion took\r\nplace in Lewis, occasioned by the pretensions of Torquill Connaldagh\r\nof the Cogigh to the possessions of Roderick Macleod of Lewis, his\r\nreputed father. Roderick had first married Barbara Stuart, daughter\r\nof Lord Methven, by whom he had a son named Torquill-Ire, who, on\r\narriving at manhood, gave proofs of a warlike disposition. Upon the\r\ndeath of Barbara Stuart, Macleod married a daughter of Mackenzie,\r\nlord of Kintail, whom he afterwards divorced for adultery with\r\nthe Breve of Lewis, a sort of judge among the islanders, to whose\r\nauthority they submitted themselves. Macleod next married a daughter\r\nof Maclean, by whom he had two sons, Torquill Dubh and Tormaid.\r\n\r\nIn sailing from Lewis to Skye, Torquill-Ire, eldest son of Macleod,\r\nand 200 men, perished in a great tempest. Torquill Connaldagh,\r\nabove mentioned, was the fruit of the adulterous connexion between\r\nMacleod’s second wife and the Breve, at least Macleod would never\r\nacknowledge him as his son. This Torquill being now of age, and\r\nhaving married a sister of Glengarry, took up arms against Macleod,\r\nhis reputed father, to vindicate his supposed rights as Macleod’s\r\nson, being assisted by Tormaid, Ougigh, and Murthow, three of the\r\nbastard sons of Macleod. The old man was apprehended and detained\r\nfour years in captivity, when he was released on condition that he\r\nshould acknowledge Torquill Connaldagh as his lawful son. Tormaid\r\nOugigh having been slain by Donald Macleod, his brother, another\r\nnatural son of old Macleod, Torquill Connaldagh, assisted by\r\nMurthow Macleod, his reputed bastard brother, took Donald prisoner\r\nand carried him to Cogigh, but he escaped and fled to his father\r\nin Lewis, who was highly offended at Torquill for seizing his son\r\nDonald. Macleod then caused Donald to apprehend Murthow, and having\r\ndelivered him to his father, he was imprisoned in the castle of\r\nStornoway. As soon as Torquill heard of this occurrence, he went to\r\nStornoway and attacked the fort, which he took, after a short siege,\r\nand released Murthow. He then apprehended Roderick Macleod, killed\r\na number of his men, and carried off all the charters and other\r\ntitle-deeds of Lewis, which he gave in custody to the Mackenzies.\r\nTorquill had a son named John Macleod, who was in the service of the\r\nMarquis of Huntly; he now sent for him, and on his arrival committed\r\nto him the charge of the castle of Stornoway in which old Macleod was\r\nimprisoned. John Macleod being now master of Lewis, and acknowledged\r\nsuperior thereof, proceeded to expel Rorie-Og and Donald, two of\r\nRoderick Macleod’s bastard sons, from the island; but Rorie-Og\r\nattacked him in Stornoway, and after killing him, released Roderick\r\nMacleod, his father, who possessed the island in peace during the\r\nremainder of his life. Torquill Connaldagh, by the assistance of the\r\nclan Kenzie, got Donald Macleod into his possession, and executed him\r\nat Dingwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stornoway Castle.--From a photograph taken specially\r\nfor this work.]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Roderick Macleod, his son Torquill Dubh\r\nsucceeded him in Lewis. Taking a grudge at Rorie-Og, his brother, he\r\napprehended him, and sent him to Maclean to be detained in prison;\r\nbut he escaped out of Maclean’s hands, and afterwards perished in\r\na snow-storm. As Torquill Dubh excluded Torquill Connaldagh from\r\nthe succession of Lewis, as a bastard, the clan Kenzie formed a\r\ndesign to purchase and conquer Lewis, which they calculated on\r\naccomplishing on account of the simplicity of Torquill Connaldagh,\r\nwho had now no friend to advise with, and from the dissensions which\r\nunfortunately existed among the race of the Siol-Torquill. This\r\nscheme, moreover, received the aid of a matrimonial alliance between\r\nTorquill Connaldagh and the clan, by a marriage between his eldest\r\ndaughter and Roderick Mackenzie, the lord of Kintail’s brother.\r\nThe clan did not avow their design openly, but they advanced their\r\nenterprise under the pretence of assisting Torquill Connaldagh,\r\nwho was a descendant of the Kintail family, and they ultimately\r\nsucceeded in destroying the family of Macleod of Lewis, together\r\nwith his tribe, the Siol-Torquill, and by the ruin of that family\r\nand some neighbouring clans, this ambitious clan made themselves\r\ncomplete masters of Lewis and other places. As Torquill Dubh was the\r\nchief obstacle in their way, they formed a conspiracy against his\r\nlife, which, by the assistance of the Breve, they were enabled to\r\ncarry out successfully. The Breve, by stratagem, managed to obtain\r\npossession of Torquill Dubh and some of his friends, and deliver them\r\nto the lord of Kintail, who ordered them to be beheaded, which they\r\naccordingly were in July, 1597.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen belonging to Fife, hearing of these disturbances\r\nin Lewis, obtained from the king, in 1598, a gift of the island,\r\ntheir professed object being to civilize the inhabitants, their\r\nreal design, however, being, by means of a colony, to supplant the\r\ninhabitants, and drive them from the island. A body of soldiers and\r\nartificers of all sorts were sent, with every thing necessary for a\r\nplantation, into Lewis, where, on their arrival, they began to erect\r\nhouses in a convenient situation, and soon completed a small but\r\nneat town, in which they took up their quarters. The new settlers\r\nwere, however, much annoyed in their operations by Neill and Murthow\r\nMacleod, the only sons of Roderick Macleod who remained in the\r\nisland. The speculation proved ruinous to many of the adventurers,\r\nwho, in consequence of the disasters they met with, lost their\r\nestates, and were in the end obliged to quit the island.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Neill Macleod quarrelled with his brother Murthow,\r\nfor harbouring and maintaining the Breve and such of his tribe as\r\nwere still alive, who had been the chief instruments in the murder\r\nof Torquill Dubh. Neill thereupon apprehended his brother, and some\r\nof the clan Mhic-Ghille-Mhoir, all of whom he killed, reserving his\r\nbrother only alive. When the Fife speculators were informed that\r\nNeill had taken Murthow, his brother, prisoner, they sent him a\r\nmessage offering to give him a share of the island, and to assist him\r\nin revenging the death of Torquill Dubh, provided he would deliver\r\nMurthow into their hands. Neill agreed to this proposal, and having\r\ngone thereafter to Edinburgh, he received a pardon from the king for\r\nall his past offences.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings frustrated for a time the designs of the Mackenzies\r\nupon the island, and the lord of Kintail almost despaired of\r\nobtaining possession by any means. As the new settlers now stood in\r\nhis way, he resolved to desist from persecuting the Siol-Torquill,\r\nand to cross the former in their undertakings, by all the means\r\nin his power. He had for some time kept Tormaid Macleod, the\r\nlawful brother of Torquill Dubh, a prisoner; but he now released\r\nhim, thinking that upon his appearance in the Lewis all the\r\nislanders would rise in his favour; and he was not deceived in\r\nhis expectations, for, as Sir Robert Gordon observes, “all these\r\nislanders, (and lykwayes the Hielanders,) are, by nature, most bent\r\nand prone to adventure themselves, their lyffs, and all they have,\r\nfor their masters and lords, yea beyond all other people.”[199] In\r\nthe meantime Murthow Macleod was carried to St. Andrews, and there\r\nexecuted. Having at his execution revealed the designs of the lord\r\nof Kintail, the latter was committed, by order of the king, to the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh, from which, however, he contrived to escape\r\nwithout trial, by means, as is supposed, of the then Lord-Chancellor\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn receiving pardon Neill Macleod returned into Lewis with the\r\nFife adventurers; but he had not been long in the island when he\r\nquarrelled with them on account of an injury he had received from Sir\r\nJames Spence of Wormistoun. He therefore abandoned them, and watched\r\na favourable opportunity for attacking them. They then attempted to\r\napprehend him by a stratagem, but only succeeded in bringing disaster\r\nupon themselves. Upon hearing of this, the lord of Kintail thought\r\nthe time was now suitable for him to stir, and accordingly he sent\r\nTormaid Macleod into Lewis, as he had intended, promising him all the\r\nassistance in his power if he would attack the Fife settlers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tormaid arrived in the island, his brother Neill and\r\nall the natives assembled and acknowledged him as their lord and\r\nmaster. He immediately attacked the camp of the adventurers, which\r\nhe forced, burnt the fort, killed the greater part of their men,\r\ntook the commanders prisoners, whom he released, after a captivity\r\nof eight months, on their solemn promise not to return again to the\r\nisland, and on their giving a pledge that they should obtain a pardon\r\nfrom the king for Tormaid and his followers for all past offences.\r\nAfter Tormaid had thus obtained possession of the island, John\r\nMac-Donald-Mac-Houcheon apprehended Torquill Connaldagh, and carried\r\nhim into Lewis to his brother, Tormaid Macleod. Tormaid inflicted no\r\npunishment upon Connaldagh, but merely required from him delivery of\r\nthe title-deeds of Lewis, and the other papers which he had carried\r\noff when he apprehended his father Roderick Macleod. Connaldagh\r\ninformed him that he had it not in his power to give them up, as\r\nhe had delivered them to the clan Kenzie, in whose possession they\r\nstill were. Knowing this to be the fact, Tormaid released Torquill\r\nConnaldagh, and allowed him to leave the island, contrary to the\r\nadvice of all his followers and friends, who were for inflicting the\r\npunishment of death upon Torquill, as he had been the occasion of all\r\nthe miseries and troubles which had befallen them.\r\n\r\nThe Breve of Lewis soon met with a just punishment for the crime he\r\nhad committed in betraying and murdering his master, Torquill Dubh\r\nMacleod. The Breve and some of his relations had taken refuge in the\r\ncountry of Assynt. John Mac-Donald-Mac-Houcheon, accompanied by four\r\npersons, having accidentally entered the house where the Breve and\r\nsix of his kindred lodged, found themselves unexpectedly in the same\r\nroom with them. Being of opposite factions, a fight immediately\r\nensued, in the course of which the Breve and his party fled out of\r\nthe house, but were pursued by John and his men, and the Breve and\r\nfive of his friends killed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Fife settlers had engaged not to return again into\r\nLewis, they nevertheless made preparations for invading it, having\r\nobtained the king’s commission against Tormaid Macleod and his\r\ntribe, the Siol-Torquill. They were aided in this expedition by\r\nforces from all the neighbouring counties, and particularly by the\r\nEarl of Sutherland, who sent a party of men under the command of\r\nWilliam Mac-Mhic-Sheumais, chief of the clan Gun in Sutherland, to\r\nassist in subduing Tormaid Macleod. As soon as they had effected a\r\nlanding in the island with all their forces, they sent a message to\r\nMacleod, acquainting him that if he would surrender himself to them,\r\nin name of the king, they would transport him safely to London,\r\nwhere his majesty then was; and that, upon his arrival there, they\r\nwould not only obtain his pardon, but also allow him to deal with\r\nthe king in behalf of his friends, and for the means of supporting\r\nhimself. Macleod, afraid to risk his fortune against the numerous\r\nforces brought against him, agreed to the terms proposed, contrary\r\nto the advice of his brother Neill, who refused to yield. Tormaid\r\nwas thereupon sent to London, where he took care to give the king\r\nfull information concerning all the circumstances of his case; he\r\nshowed his majesty that Lewis was his just inheritance, and that\r\nhis majesty had been deceived by the Fife adventurers in making him\r\nbelieve that the island was at his disposal, which act of deception\r\nhad occasioned much trouble and a great loss of blood. He concluded\r\nby imploring his majesty to do him justice by restoring him to his\r\nrights. Understanding that Macleod’s representations were favourably\r\nreceived by his majesty, the adventurers used all their influence at\r\ncourt to thwart him; and as some of them were the king’s own domestic\r\nservants, they at last succeeded so far as to get him to be sent home\r\nto Scotland a prisoner in 1605. He remained a captive at Edinburgh\r\ntill the month of March, 1615, when the king granted him permission\r\nto pass into Holland, to Maurice, Prince of Orange, where he ended\r\nhis days. The settlers soon grew wearied of their new possession,\r\nand as all of them had declined in their circumstances in this\r\nluckless speculation, and as they were continually annoyed by Neill\r\nMacleod, they finally abandoned the island, and returned to Fife to\r\nbewail their loss.\r\n\r\nLord Kintail, now no longer disguising his intentions, obtained,\r\nthrough means of the Lord Chancellor, a gift of Lewis, under the\r\ngreat seal, for his own use, in virtue of the old right which\r\nTorquill Connaldagh had long before resigned in his favour. Some of\r\nthe adventurers having complained to the king of this proceeding,\r\nhis majesty became highly displeased at Kintail, and made him resign\r\nhis right into his majesty’s hands by means of Lord Balmerino, then\r\nSecretary of Scotland, and Lord President of the session; which right\r\nhis majesty now (1608) vested in the persons of Lord Balmerino, Sir\r\nGeorge Hay, afterwards Chancellor of Scotland, and Sir James Spence\r\nof Wormistoun. Balmerino, on being convicted of high treason in\r\n1609, lost his share, but Hay and Spence undertook the colonization\r\nof Lewis, and accordingly made great preparations for accomplishing\r\ntheir purpose. Being assisted by most of the neighbouring countries,\r\nthey invaded Lewis for the double object of planting a colony, and of\r\nsubduing and apprehending Neill Macleod, who now alone defended the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Lord Kintail played a double part, for while he sent\r\nRoderick Mackenzie, his brother, with a party of men openly to assist\r\nthe new colonists who acted under the king’s commission,--promising\r\nthem at the same time his friendship, and sending them a vessel\r\nfrom Ross with a supply of provisions,--he privately sent notice\r\nto Neill Macleod to intercept the vessel on her way; so that the\r\nsettlers, being disappointed in the provisions to which they trusted,\r\nmight abandon the island for want. The case turned out exactly as\r\nLord Kintail anticipated, as Sir George Hay and Sir James Spence\r\nabandoned the island, leaving a party of men behind to keep the fort,\r\nand disbanded their forces, returning into Fife, intending to have\r\nsent a fresh supply of men, with provisions, into the island. But\r\nNeill Macleod having, with the assistance of his nephew, Malcolm\r\nMacleod, son of Roderick Og, burnt the fort, and apprehended the\r\nmen who were left behind in the island, whom he sent safely home,\r\nthe Fife gentlemen abandoned every idea of again taking possession\r\nof the island, and sold their right to Lord Kintail. He likewise\r\nobtained from the king a grant of the share of the island forfeited\r\nby Balmerino, and thus at length acquired what he had so long and\r\nanxiously desired.[200]\r\n\r\nLord Kintail lost no time in taking possession of the island,--and\r\nall the inhabitants, shortly after his landing, with the exception\r\nof Neill Macleod and a few others, submitted to him. Neill, along\r\nwith his nephews, Malcolm, William, and Roderick, the three sons of\r\nRoderick Og, the four sons of Torquill Blair, and thirty others,\r\nretired to an impregnable rock in the sea called Berrissay, on the\r\nwest of Lewis, into which Neill had been accustomed, for some years,\r\nto send provisions and other necessary articles to serve him in case\r\nof necessity. Neill lived on this rock for three years, Lord Kintail\r\nin the meantime dying in 1611. As Macleod could not be attacked\r\nin his impregnable position, and as his proximity was a source of\r\nannoyance, the clan Kenzie fell on the following expedient to get\r\nquit of him. They gathered together the wives and children of those\r\nthat were in Berrissay, and also all persons in the island related\r\nto them by consanguinity or affinity, and having placed them on a\r\nrock in the sea, so near Berrissay that they could be heard and seen\r\nby Neill and his party, the clan Kenzie vowed that they would suffer\r\nthe sea to overwhelm them, on the return of the flood-tide, if Neill\r\ndid not instantly surrender the fort. This appalling spectacle had\r\nsuch an effect upon Macleod and his companions, that they immediately\r\nyielded up the rock and left Lewis.\r\n\r\nNeill Macleod then retired into Harris, where he remained concealed\r\nfor a time; but not being able to avoid discovery any longer, he\r\ngave himself up to Sir Roderick Macleod of Harris, and entreated\r\nhim to carry him into England to the king, a request with which Sir\r\nRoderick promised to comply. In proceeding on his journey, however,\r\nalong with Macleod, he was charged at Glasgow, under pain of treason,\r\nto deliver up Neill to the privy council. Sir Roderick obeyed the\r\ncharge, and Neill, with his eldest son Donald, were presented to\r\nthe privy council at Edinburgh, where Neill was executed in April\r\n1613. His son Donald was banished from the kingdom of Scotland, and\r\nimmediately went to England, where he remained three years with Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, tutor of Sutherland, and from England he afterwards\r\nwent to Holland, where he died.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Neill Macleod, Roderick and William, the sons\r\nof Roderick Og, were apprehended by Roderick Mackenzie, tutor of\r\nKintail, and executed. Malcolm Macleod, his third son, who was kept\r\na prisoner by Roderick Mackenzie, escaped, and having associated\r\nhimself with the clan Donald in Islay and Kintyre during their\r\nquarrel with the Campbells in 1615-16, he annoyed the clan Kenzie\r\nwith frequent incursions. Malcolm, thereafter, went to Flanders and\r\nSpain, where he remained with Sir James Macdonald. Before going to\r\nSpain, he returned from Flanders into Lewis in 1616, where he killed\r\ntwo gentlemen of the clan Kenzie. He returned from Spain in 1620,\r\nand the last that is heard of him is in 1626, when commissions of\r\nfire and sword were granted to Lord Kintail against “Malcolm Macquari\r\nMacleod.”[201]\r\n\r\nFrom the occurrences in Lewis, we now direct the attention of our\r\nreaders to some proceedings in the isle of Rasay, which ended in\r\nbloodshed. The quarrel lay between Gille-Chalum, laird of the island,\r\nand Murdo Mackenzie of Gairloch, and the occasion was as follows. The\r\nlands of Gairloch originally belonged to the clan Mhic-Ghille-Chalum,\r\nthe predecessors of the laird of Rasay; and when the Mackenzies began\r\nto prosper and to rise, one of them obtained the third part of these\r\nlands in mortgage or wadset from the clan Mhic-Ghille-Chalum. In\r\nprocess of time the clan Kenzie, by some means or other, unknown to\r\nthe proprietor of Gairloch, obtained a right to the whole of these\r\nlands, but they did not claim possession of the whole till the death\r\nof Torquill Dubh Macleod of Lewis, whom the laird of Rasay and his\r\ntribe followed as their superior. But upon the death of Torquill\r\nDubh, the laird of Gairloch took possession of the whole of the\r\nlands of Gairloch in virtue of his pretended right, and chased the\r\nclan Mhic-Ghille-Chalum from the lands with fire and sword. The\r\nclan retaliated in their turn by invading the laird of Gairloch,\r\nplundering his lands and committing slaughters. In a skirmish which\r\ntook place in the year 1610, in which lives were lost on both sides,\r\nthe laird of Gairloch apprehended John Mac-Alain-Mac-Rory, one of the\r\nprincipal men of the clan; but being desirous to get hold also of\r\nJohn Holmoch-Mac-Rory, another of the chiefs, he sent his son Murdo\r\nthe following year along with Alexander Bane, the son and heir of\r\nBane of Tulloch in Ross, and some others, to search for and pursue\r\nJohn Holmoch; and as he understood that John Holmoch was in Skye, he\r\nhired a ship to carry his son and party thither; but instead of going\r\nto Skye, they unfortunately, from some unknown cause, landed in Rasay.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival in Rasay in August 1611, Gille-Chalum, laird of\r\nRasay, with some of his followers, went on board, and unexpectedly\r\nfound Murdo Mackenzie in the vessel. After consulting with his men,\r\nhe resolved to take Mackenzie prisoner, in security for his cousin,\r\nJohn Mac-Alain-Mac-Rory, whom the laird of Gairloch detained in\r\ncaptivity. The party then attempted to seize Mackenzie, but he and\r\nhis party resisting, a keen conflict took place on board, which\r\ncontinued a considerable time. At last, Murdo Mackenzie, Alexander\r\nBane, and the whole of their party, with the exception of three,\r\nwere slain. These three fought manfully, killing the laird of Rasay\r\nand the whole men who accompanied him on board, and wounding several\r\npersons that remained in the two boats. Finding themselves seriously\r\nwounded, they took advantage of a favourable wind, and sailed away\r\nfrom the island, but expired on the voyage homewards. From this time\r\nthe Mackenzies appear to have uninterruptedly held possession of\r\nGairloch.[202]\r\n\r\nAbout the time this occurrence took place, the peace of the north\r\nwas almost again disturbed in consequence of the conduct of William\r\nMac-Angus-Roy, one of the clan Gun, who, though born in Strathnaver,\r\nhad become a servant to the Earl of Caithness. This man had done\r\nmany injuries to the people of Caithness by command of the earl;\r\nand the mere displeasure of Earl George at any of his people, was\r\nconsidered by William Mac-Angus as sufficient authority for him\r\nto steal and take away their goods and cattle. William got so\r\naccustomed to this kind of service, that he began also to steal the\r\ncattle and horses of the earl, his master, and, after collecting a\r\nlarge booty in this way, he took his leave. The earl was extremely\r\nenraged at his _quondam_ servant for so acting; but, as William\r\nMac-Angus was in possession of a warrant in writing under the earl’s\r\nown hand, authorizing him to act as he had done towards the people\r\nof Caithness, the earl was afraid to adopt any proceedings against\r\nhim, or against those who protected and harboured him, before the\r\nPrivy Council, lest he might produce the warrant which he held from\r\nthe earl. The confidence which the earl had reposed in him served,\r\nhowever, still more to excite the earl’s indignation.\r\n\r\nAs William Mac-Angus continued his depredations in other quarters, he\r\nwas apprehended in the town of Tain, on a charge of cattle-stealing;\r\nbut he was released by the Monroes, who gave security to the\r\nmagistrates of the town for his appearance when required, upon due\r\nnotice being given that he was wanted for trial. On attempting to\r\nescape he was re-delivered to the provost and bailies of Tain,\r\nby whom he was given up to the Earl of Caithness, who put him in\r\nfetters, and imprisoned him within Castle Sinclair (1612). He soon\r\nagain contrived to escape, and fled into Strathnaver, the Earl of\r\nCaithness sending his son, William, Lord Berridale, in pursuit of\r\nhim. Missing the fugitive, he, in revenge, apprehended a servant\r\nof Mackay, called Angus Henriach, without any authority from his\r\nmajesty, and carried him to Castle Sinclair, where he was put into\r\nfetters and closely imprisoned on the pretence that he had assisted\r\nWilliam Mac-Angus in effecting his escape. When this occurrence\r\ntook place, Donald Mackay, son of Houcheon Mackay, the chief,\r\nwas at Dunrobin castle, and he, on hearing of the apprehension\r\nand imprisonment of his father’s servant, could scarcely be made\r\nto believe the fact on account of the friendship which had been\r\ncontracted between his father and the earl the preceding Christmas.\r\nBut being made sensible thereof, and of the cruel usage which the\r\nservant had received, he prevailed on his father to summon the\r\nearl and his son to answer to the charge of having apprehended and\r\nimprisoned Angus Henriach, a free subject of the king, without a\r\ncommission. The earl was also charged to present his prisoner before\r\nthe privy council at Edinburgh in the month of June next following,\r\nwhich he accordingly did; and Angus being tried before the lords and\r\ndeclared innocent, was delivered over to Sir Robert Gordon, who then\r\nacted for Mackay.[203]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castles Sinclair and Girnigo.--From a photograph taken\r\nspecially for this work.]\r\n\r\nDuring the same year (1612) another event occurred in the north,\r\nwhich created considerable uproar and discord in the northern\r\nHighlands. A person of the name of Arthur Smith, who resided in\r\nBanff, had counterfeited the coin of the realm, in consequence of\r\nwhich he, and a man who had assisted him, fled from Banff into\r\nSutherland, where being apprehended in the year 1599, they were sent\r\nby the Countess of Sutherland to the king, who ordered them to be\r\nimprisoned in Edinburgh for trial. They were both accordingly tried\r\nand condemned, and having confessed to crimes even of a deeper dye,\r\nSmith’s accomplice was burnt at the place of execution. Smith himself\r\nwas reserved for farther trial. By devising a lock of rare and\r\ncurious workmanship, which took the fancy of the king, he ultimately\r\nobtained his release and entered into the service of the Earl of\r\nCaithness. His workshop was under the rock of Castle Sinclair, in a\r\nquiet retired place called the Gote, and to which there was a secret\r\npassage from the earl’s bedchamber. No person was admitted to Smith’s\r\nworkshop but the earl; and the circumstance of his being often heard\r\nworking during the night, raised suspicions that some secret work was\r\ngoing on which could not bear the light of day. The mystery was at\r\nlast disclosed by an inundation of counterfeit coin in Caithness,\r\nOrkney, Sutherland, and Ross, which was first detected by Sir Robert\r\nGordon, brother to the Earl of Sutherland, when in Scotland, in the\r\nyear 1611, and he, on his return to England, made the king acquainted\r\ntherewith. A commission was granted to Sir Robert to apprehend\r\nSmith, and bring him to Edinburgh, but he was so much occupied with\r\nother concerns that he intrusted the commission to Donald Mackay,\r\nhis nephew, and to John Gordon, younger of Embo, whose name was\r\njointly inserted in the commission along with that of Sir Robert.\r\nAccordingly, Mackay and Gordon, accompanied by Adam Gordon Georgeson\r\nJohn, Gordon in Broray, and some other Sutherland men, went, in May,\r\n1612, to Strathnaver, and assembling some of the inhabitants, they\r\nmarched into Caithness next morning, and entered the town of Thurso,\r\nwhere Smith then resided.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining about three hours in the town, the party went to\r\nSmith’s house and apprehended him. On searching his house they found\r\na quantity of spurious gold and silver coin. Donald Mackay caused\r\nSmith to be put on horseback, and then rode off with him out of the\r\ntown. To prevent any tumult among the inhabitants, Gordon remained\r\nbehind with some of his men to show them, if necessary, his Majesty’s\r\ncommission for apprehending Smith. Scarcely, however, had Mackay\r\nleft the town, when the town-bell was rung and all the inhabitants\r\nassembled. There were present in Thurso at the time, John Sinclair\r\nof Stirkage, son of the Earl of Caithness’s brother, James Sinclair,\r\nbrother of the laird of Dun, James Sinclair of Dyrren, and other\r\nfriends, on a visit to Lady Berridale. When information was brought\r\nthem of the apprehension of Smith, Sinclair of Stirkage, transported\r\nwith rage, swore that he would not allow any man, no matter whose\r\ncommission he held, to carry away his uncle’s servant in his uncle’s\r\nabsence. A furious onset was made upon Gordon, but his men withstood\r\nit bravely, and after a warm contest, the inhabitants were defeated\r\nwith some loss, and obliged to retire to the centre of the town.\r\nDonald Mackay hearing of the tumult, returned to the town to aid\r\nGordon, but the affair was over before he arrived, Sinclair of\r\nStirkage having been killed. To prevent the possibility of the escape\r\nor rescue of Smith, he was killed by the Strathnaver men as soon as\r\nthey heard of the tumult in the town.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness resolved to prosecute Donald Mackay, John\r\nGordon, younger of Embo, with their followers, for the slaughter of\r\nSinclair of Stirkage, and the mutilation of James Sinclair, brother\r\nof the laird of Dun, and summoned them, accordingly, to appear at\r\nEdinburgh. On the other hand, Sir Robert Gordon and Donald Mackay\r\nprosecuted the Earl of Caithness and his son, Lord Berridale,\r\nwith several other of their countrymen, for resisting the king’s\r\ncommission, attacking the commissioners, and apprehending Angus\r\nHenriach, without a commission, which was declared treason by the\r\nlaws. The Earl of Caithness endeavoured to make the Privy Council\r\nbelieve that the affair at Thurso arose out of a premeditated design\r\nagainst him, and that Sir Robert Gordon’s intention in obtaining\r\na commission against Arthur Smith was, under the cloak of its\r\nauthority, to find means to slay him and his brethren; and that, in\r\npursuance of his plan, Sir Robert had, a little before the skirmish\r\nin Thurso, caused the earl to be denounced and proclaimed as a rebel\r\nto the king, and had lain in wait to kill him; Sir Robert, however,\r\nshowed the utter groundlessness of these charges to the Lords of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for appearance, the parties met at Edinburgh,\r\nattended by their respective friends. The Earl of Caithness and his\r\nson, Lord Berridale, were accompanied by the Lord Gray, the laird of\r\nRoslin, the laird of Cowdenknowes, a son of the sister of the Earl\r\nof Caithness, and the lairds of Murkle and Greenland, brothers of\r\nthe earl, along with a large retinue of subordinate attendants. Sir\r\nRobert Gordon and Donald Mackay were attended by the Earl of Winton\r\nand his brother, the Earl of Eglinton, with all their followers, the\r\nEarl of Linlithgow, with the Livingstones, Lord Elphinston, with\r\nhis friends, Lord Forbes, with his friends, the Drummonds, Sir John\r\nStuart, captain of Dumbarton, and bastard son of the Duke of Lennox;\r\nLord Balfour, the laird of Lairg Mackay in Galloway; the laird of\r\nFoulis, with the Monroes, the laird of Duffus, some of the Gordons,\r\nas Sir Alexander Gordon, brother of the Earl of Sutherland, Cluny,\r\nLesmoir, Buckie, Knokespock, with other gentlemen of respectability.\r\nThe absence of the Earl of Sutherland and Houcheon Mackay mortified\r\nthe Earl of Caithness, who could not conceal his displeasure at being\r\nso much overmatched in the respectability and number of attendants by\r\nseconds and children, as he was pleased to call his adversaries.\r\n\r\nAccording to the usual practice on such occasions, the parties were\r\naccompanied by their respective friends, from their lodgings, to the\r\nhouse where the council was sitting; but few were admitted within.\r\nThe council spent three days in hearing the parties and deliberating\r\nupon the matters brought before them, but they came to no conclusion,\r\nand adjourned their proceedings till the king’s pleasure should be\r\nknown. In the meantime the parties, at the entreaty of the Lords of\r\nthe Council, entered into recognizances to keep the peace, in time\r\ncoming, towards each other, which extended not only to their kinsmen,\r\nbut also to their friends and dependants.\r\n\r\nThe king, after fully considering the state of affairs between the\r\nrival parties, and judging that if the law were allowed to take its\r\ncourse the peace of the northern countries might be disturbed by\r\nthe earls and their numerous followers, proposed to the Lords of\r\nthe Privy Council to endeavour to prevail upon them to submit their\r\ndifferences to the arbitration of mutual friends. Accordingly, after\r\na good deal of entreaty and reasoning, the parties were persuaded\r\nto agree to the proposed measure. A deed of submission was then\r\nsubscribed by the Earl of Caithness and William, Lord Berridale,\r\non the one part, and by Sir Robert Gordon and Donald Mackay on the\r\nother part, taking burden on them for the Earl of Sutherland and\r\nMackay. The arbiters appointed by Sir Robert Gordon were the Earl\r\nof Kinghorn, the Master of Elphinston, the Earl of Haddington,\r\nafterwards Lord Privy Seal of Scotland, and Sir Alexander Drummond\r\nof Meidhop. The Archbishop of Glasgow, Sir John Preston, Lord\r\nPresident of the Council, Lord Blantyre, and Sir William Oliphant,\r\nLord Advocate, were named by the Earl of Caithness. The Earl of\r\nDunfermline, Lord-Chancellor of Scotland, was chosen oversman and\r\numpire by both parties. As the arbiters had then no time to hear the\r\nparties, or to enter upon the consideration of the matters submitted\r\nto them, they appointed them to return to Edinburgh in the month of\r\nMay, 1613.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, the Earl of Caithness and his brother, Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair of Greenland, came to Edinburgh, Sir Robert Gordon\r\narriving at the same time from England. The arbiters, however, who\r\nwere all members of the Privy Council, being much occupied with\r\nstate affairs, did not go into the matter, but made the parties\r\nsubscribe a new deed of submission, under which they gave authority\r\nto the Marquis of Huntly, by whose friendly offices the differences\r\nbetween the two houses had formerly been so often adjusted, to act\r\nin the matter by endeavouring to bring about a fresh reconciliation.\r\nAs the marquis was the cousin-german of the Earl of Sutherland, and\r\nbrother-in-law of the Earl of Caithness, who had married his sister,\r\nthe council thought him the most likely person to be intrusted with\r\nsuch an important negotiation. The marquis, however, finding the\r\nparties obstinate, and determined not to yield a single point of\r\ntheir respective claims and pretensions, declined to act farther in\r\nthe matter, and remitted the whole affair back to the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1613 the peace of Lochaber was disturbed by\r\ndissensions among the clan Cameron. The Earl of Argyle, reviving an\r\nold claim acquired in the reign of James V., by Colin, the third\r\nearl, endeavoured to obtain possession of the lands of Lochiel,\r\nmainly to weaken the influence of his rival the Marquis of Huntly,\r\nto whose party the clan Cameron were attached. Legal proceedings\r\nwere instituted by the earl against Allan Cameron of Lochiel, who,\r\nhastening to Edinburgh, was there advised by Argyle to submit the\r\nmatter to arbiters. The decision was in favour of the earl, from whom\r\nLochiel consented to hold his lands as a vassal. This, of course,\r\nhighly incensed the Marquis of Huntly, who resolved to endeavour to\r\neffect the ruin of his _quondam_ vassal by fomenting dissensions\r\namong the clan Cameron, inducing the Camerons of Erracht, Kinlochiel,\r\nand Glennevis to become his immediate vassals in those lands which\r\nLochiel had hitherto held from the family of Huntly. Lochiel, failing\r\nto induce his kinsmen to renew their allegiance to him, again went\r\nto Edinburgh to consult his lawyers as to the course which he ought\r\nto pursue. While there, he heard of a conspiracy by the opposite\r\nfaction against his life, which induced him to hasten home, sending\r\nword privately to his friends--the Camerons of Callart, Strone,\r\nLetterfinlay, and others--to meet him on the day appointed for the\r\nassembling of his opponents, near the spot where the latter were to\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the appointed rendezvous, Lochiel placed in ambush all\r\nhis followers but six, with whom he advanced towards his enemies,\r\ninforming them that he wished to have a conference with them.\r\nThe hostile faction, thinking this a favourable opportunity for\r\naccomplishing their design, pursued the chief, who, when he had led\r\nthem fairly into the midst of his ambushed followers, gave the signal\r\nfor their slaughter. Twenty of their principal men were killed,\r\nand eight taken prisoners, Lochiel allowing the rest to escape.\r\nLochiel and his followers were by the Privy Council outlawed, and a\r\ncommission of fire and sword granted to the Marquis of Huntly and\r\nthe Gordons, for their pursuit and apprehension. The division of the\r\nclan Cameron which supported Lochiel continued for several years in a\r\nstate of outlawry, but, through the influence of the Earl of Argyle,\r\nappears not to have suffered extremely.[204]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[193] Sir R.

The\r\nearl thought that he would succeed, by such a threat, in moving the\r\ncouncil to decide in his favour, for he was well aware that he was\r\nunable to carry it into execution. To give some appearance of an\r\nintention to enforce it, he, in the month of October, 1613, while the\r\nEarl of Sutherland, his brothers and nephews, were absent from the\r\ncountry, made a demonstration of invading Sutherland or Strathnaver,\r\nby collecting his forces at a particular point, and bringing thither\r\nsome pieces of ordnance from Castle Sinclair. The Earl of Sutherland,\r\nhaving arrived in Sutherland while the Earl of Caithness was thus\r\nemployed, immediately assembled some of his countrymen, and,\r\nalong with his brother Sir Alexander, went to the marches between\r\nSutherland and Caithness, near the height of Strathully, where they\r\nwaited the approach of the Earl of Caithness. Here they were joined\r\nby Mackay, who had given notice of the Earl of Caithness’s movements\r\nto the lairds of Foulis, Balnagown, and Assynt, the sheriff of\r\nCromarty, and the tutor of Kintail, all of whom prepared themselves\r\nto assist the Earl of Sutherland. The Earl of Caithness, however, by\r\nadvice of his brother, Sir John Sinclair, returned home and disbanded\r\nhis force.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the Earl of Caithness from attempting any farther\r\ninterference with the Privy Council, either in the way of intrigue\r\nor intimidation, Sir Robert Gordon obtained a remission and pardon\r\nfrom the king, in the month of December, 1613, to his nephew, Donald\r\nMackay, John Gordon, younger of Embo, John Gordon in Broray, Adam\r\nGordon Georgeson, and their accomplices, for the slaughter of John\r\nSinclair of Stirkage at Thurso. However, Sir Gideon Murray, Deputy\r\nTreasurer for Scotland, contrived to prevent the pardon passing\r\nthrough the seals till the beginning of the year 1616.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, being thus baffled in his designs against the\r\nEarl of Sutherland and his friends, fell upon a device which never\r\nfailed to succeed in times of religious intolerance and persecution.\r\nUnfortunately for mankind and for the interests of Christianity,\r\nthe principles of religious toleration, involving the inalienable\r\nright of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his\r\nconscience, have been till of late but little understood, and at the\r\nperiod in question, and for upwards of one hundred and sixty years\r\nthereafter, the statute book of Scotland was disgraced by penal\r\nenactments against the Catholics, almost unparalleled for their\r\nsanguinary atrocity. By an act of the first parliament of James\r\nVI., any Catholic who assisted at the offices of his religion was,\r\n“for the first fault,” that is, for following the dictates of his\r\nconscience, to suffer confiscation of all his goods, movable and\r\nimmovable, personal and real; for the second, banishment; and death\r\nfor the third fault! But the law was not confined to overt acts\r\nonly--the mere suspicion of being a Catholic placed the suspected\r\nperson out of the pale and protection of the law; for if, on being\r\nwarned by the bishops and ministers, he did not recant and give\r\nconfession of his faith according to the approved form, he was\r\nexcommunicated, and declared infamous and incapable to sit or stand\r\nin judgment, pursue or bear office.[205]\r\n\r\nUnder this last-mentioned law the Earl of Caithness now sought\r\nto gratify his vengeance against the Earl of Sutherland. Having\r\nrepresented to the Archbishop of St. Andrews and the clergy of\r\nScotland that the Earl of Sutherland was at heart a Catholic,\r\nhe prevailed upon the bishops--with little difficulty, it is\r\nsupposed--to acquaint the king thereof. His majesty thereupon issued\r\na warrant against the Earl of Sutherland, who was in consequence\r\napprehended and imprisoned at St. Andrews. The earl applied to the\r\nbishops for a month’s delay, till the 15th February, 1614, promising\r\nthat before that time he would either give the church satisfaction\r\nor surrender himself; but his application was refused by the high\r\ncommission of Scotland. Sir Alexander Gordon, the brother of the\r\nearl, being then in Edinburgh, immediately gave notice to his\r\nbrother, Sir Robert Gordon, who was at the time in London, of the\r\nproceedings against their brother, the earl. Sir Robert having\r\napplied to his majesty for the release of the earl for a time, that\r\nhe might make up his mind on the subject of religion, and look after\r\nhis affairs in the north, his majesty granted a warrant for his\r\nliberation till the month of August following. On the expiration of\r\nthe time, he returned to his confinement at St. Andrews, from which\r\nhe was removed, on his own application, to the abbey of Holyrood\r\nhouse, where he remained till the month of March, 1615, when he\r\nobtained leave to go home, “having,” says Sir Robert Gordon, “in some\r\nmeasure satisfied the church concerning his religion.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, thus again defeated in his views, tried,\r\nas a _dernier ressort_, to disjoin the families of Sutherland and\r\nMackay. Sometimes he attempted to prevail upon the Marquis of Huntly\r\nto persuade the Earl of Sutherland and his brothers to come to an\r\narrangement altogether independent of Mackay; and at other times he\r\nendeavoured to persuade Mackay, by holding out certain inducements\r\nto him, to compromise their differences without including the Earl\r\nof Sutherland in the arrangement; but he completely failed in these\r\nattempts.[206]\r\n\r\nIn 1614-15 a formidable rebellion broke out in the South Hebrides,\r\narising from the efforts made by the clan Donald of Islay to retain\r\nthat island in their possession. The castle of Dunyveg in Islay,\r\nwhich, for three years previous to 1614, had been in possession of\r\nthe Bishop of the Isles, having been taken by Angus Oig, younger\r\nbrother of Sir James Macdonald of Islay, from Ranald Oig, who had\r\nsurprised it, the former refused to restore it to the bishop. The\r\nPrivy Council took the matter in hand, and, having accepted from\r\nJohn Campbell of Calder an offer of a feu-duty or perpetual rent for\r\nIslay, they prevailed on him to accept a commission against Angus\r\nOig and his followers. The clan Donald, who viewed with suspicion\r\nthe growing power of the Campbells, looked upon this project with\r\nmuch dislike, and treated certain hostages left by the bishop with\r\ngreat severity. Even the bishop remonstrated against making “the\r\nname of Campbell greater in the Isles than they are already,”\r\nthinking it neither good nor profitable to his majesty, “to root\r\nout one pestiferous clan, and plant in another little better.” The\r\nremonstrance of the bishop and an offer made to put matters right\r\nby Sir James Macdonald, who was then imprisoned in Edinburgh castle,\r\nwere alike unheeded, and Campbell of Calder received his commission\r\nof Lieutenandry against Angus Oig Macdonald, Coll Mac-Gillespic, and\r\nthe other rebels of Islay. A free pardon was offered to all who were\r\nnot concerned in the taking of the castle, and a remission to Angus\r\nOig, provided he gave up the castle, the hostages, and two associates\r\nof his own rank.\r\n\r\nWhile Campbell was collecting his forces, and certain auxiliary\r\ntroops from Ireland were preparing to embark, the chancellor of\r\nScotland, the Earl of Dunfermline, by means of a Ross-shire man,\r\nnamed George Graham of Eryne, prevailed on Angus Oig to release the\r\nbishop’s hostages, and deliver up to Graham the castle, in behalf of\r\nthe chancellor. Graham re-delivered the castle to Angus, to be held\r\nby him as the regular constable, until he should receive further\r\norder from the chancellor, and at the same time assured Angus of the\r\nchancellor’s countenance and protection, enjoining him to resist\r\nall efforts on the part of Campbell or his friends to eject him.\r\nThese injunctions Graham’s dupes too readily followed. “There can\r\nbe no doubt whatever that the chancellor was the author of this\r\nnotable plan to procure the liberation of the hostages, and at the\r\nsame time to deprive the clan Donald of the benefit of the pardon\r\npromised to them on this account. There are grounds for a suspicion\r\nthat the chancellor himself desired to obtain Islay; although it is\r\nprobable that he wished to avoid the odium attendant on the more\r\nviolent measures required to render such an acquisition available.\r\nHe, therefore, contrived so as to leave the punishment of the clan\r\nDonald to the Campbells, who were already sufficiently obnoxious to\r\nthe western clans, whilst he himself had the credit of procuring the\r\nliberation of the hostages.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dunyveg Castle, Islay.--From a drawing taken expressly\r\nfor this work.]\r\n\r\nCampbell of Calder and Sir Oliver Lambert, commander of the Irish\r\nforces, did not effect a junction till the 5th of January, 1615, and\r\non the 6th, Campbell landed on Islay with 200 men, his force being\r\naugmented next day by 140 more. Several of the rebels, alarmed,\r\ndeserted Angus, and were pardoned on condition of helping the\r\nbesiegers. Ronald Mac-James, uncle of Angus Oig, surrendered a fort\r\non the island of Lochgorme which he commanded, on the 21st, and\r\nalong with his son received a conditional assurance of his majesty’s\r\nfavour. Operations were commenced against Dunyveg on February 1st,\r\nand shortly after Angus had an interview with the lieutenant, during\r\nwhich the latter showed that Angus had been deceived by Graham,\r\nupon which he promised to surrender. On returning to the castle,\r\nhowever, he refused to implement his promise, being instigated to\r\nhold out apparently by Coll Mac-Gillespic. After being again battered\r\nfor some time, Angus and some of his followers at last surrendered\r\nunconditionally, Coll Mac-Gillespic contriving to make his escape.\r\nCampbell took possession of the castle on the 3d February, dispersed\r\nthe forces of the rebels, and put to death a number of those who had\r\ndeserted the siege; Angus himself was reserved for examination by the\r\nPrivy Council. In the course of the examination it came out clearly\r\nthat the Earl of Argyle was the original promoter of the seizure of\r\nthe castle, his purpose apparently being to ruin the clan Donald by\r\nurging them to rebellion; but this charge, as well as that against\r\nthe Earl of Dunfermline, appears to have been smothered.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the year 1615, Coll Mac-Gillespic and others\r\nof the clan Donald who had escaped, infested the western coasts, and\r\ncommitted many acts of piracy, being joined about the month of May by\r\nSir James Macdonald, who had escaped from Edinburgh castle, where he\r\nhad been lying for a long time under sentence of death. Sir James and\r\nhis followers, now numbering several hundreds, after laying in a good\r\nsupply of provisions, sailed towards Islay. The Privy Council were\r\nnot slow in taking steps to repress the rebellion, although various\r\ncircumstances occurred to thwart their intentions. Calder engaged to\r\nkeep the castle of Dunyveg against the rebels, and instructions were\r\ngiven to the various western gentlemen friendly to the government to\r\ndefend the western coasts and islands. Large rewards were offered for\r\nthe principal rebels. All the forces were enjoined to be at their\r\nappointed stations by the 6th of July, furnished with forty days’\r\nprovisions, and with a sufficient number of boats, to enable them to\r\nact by sea, if necessary.\r\n\r\nSir James Macdonald, about the end of June, landing on Islay, managed\r\nby stratagem to obtain possession of Dunyveg Castle, himself and\r\nhis followers appearing to have conducted themselves with great\r\nmoderation. Dividing his force, which numbered about 400, into two\r\nbodies, with one of which he himself intended to proceed to Jura,\r\nthe other, under Coll Mac-Gillespic, was destined for Kintyre, for\r\nthe purpose of encouraging the ancient followers of his family to\r\nassist him. In the beginning of July, Angus Oig and a number of his\r\nfollowers were tried and condemned, and executed immediately after.\r\n\r\nVarious disheartening reports were now circulated as to the\r\ndisaffection of Donald Gorme of Sleat, captain of the clan Ranald,\r\nRuari Macleod of Harris, and others; and that Hector Maclean of\r\nDowart, if not actually engaged in the rebellion, had announced, that\r\nif he was desired to proceed against the clan Donald, he would not be\r\nvery earnest in the service. The militia of Ayr, Renfrew, Dumbarton,\r\nBute, and Inverness were called out, and a commission was granted to\r\nthe Marquis of Hamilton to keep the clan Donald out of Arran.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council had some time before this urged the king to send\r\ndown the Earl of Argyle from England--to which he had fled from\r\nhis numerous creditors--to act as lieutenant in suppressing the\r\ninsurrection. After many delays, Argyle, to whom full powers had been\r\ngiven to act as lieutenant, at length mustered his forces at Duntroon\r\non Loch Crinan early in September. He issued a proclamation of pardon\r\nto all rebels who were willing to submit, and by means of spies\r\nexamined Macdonald’s camp, which had been pitched on the west coast\r\nof Kintyre, the number of the rebels being ascertained to be about\r\n1,000 men. Argyle set himself so promptly and vigorously to crush the\r\nrebels, that Sir James Macdonald, who had been followed to Islay by\r\nthe former, finding it impossible either to resist the Lieutenant’s\r\nforces, or to escape with his galleys to the north isles, desired\r\nfrom the earl a truce of four days, promising at the end of that\r\ntime to surrender. Argyle would not accede to this request except on\r\ncondition of Sir James giving up the two forts which he held; this\r\nSir James urged Coll Mac-Gillespic to do, but he refused, although\r\nhe sent secretly to Argyle a message that he was willing to comply\r\nwith the earl’s request. Argyle immediately sent a force against Sir\r\nJames to surprise him, who, being warned of this by the natives,\r\nmanaged to make his escape to an island called Inchdaholl, on the\r\ncoast of Ireland, and never again returned to the Hebrides. Next\r\nday, Mac-Gillespic surrendered the two forts and his prisoners, upon\r\nassurance of his own life and the lives of a few of his followers,\r\nat the same time treacherously apprehending and delivering to Argyle,\r\nMacfie of Colonsay, one of the principal rebel leaders, and eighteen\r\nothers. This conduct soon had many imitators, including Macfie\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered the forts in Islay to Campbell of Calder, and\r\nhaving executed a number of the leading rebels, Argyle proceeded\r\nto Kintyre, and crushed out all remaining seeds of insurrection\r\nthere. Many of the principal rebels, notwithstanding a diligent\r\nsearch, effected their escape, many of them to Ireland, Sir James\r\nMacdonald being sent to Spain by some Jesuits in Galway. The escape\r\nof so many of the principal rebels seems to have given the Council\r\ngreat dissatisfaction. Argyle carried on operations till the middle\r\nof December 1615, refusing to dismiss the hired soldiers in the\r\nbeginning of November, as he was ordered by the Council to do. He was\r\ncompelled to disburse the pay, amounting to upwards of £7,000, for\r\nthe extra month and a half out of his own pocket.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” to use the words of our authority for the above details,[207]\r\n“terminated the last struggle of the once powerful clan Donald of\r\nIslay and Kintyre, to retain, from the grasp of the Campbells, these\r\nancient possessions of their tribe.”\r\n\r\nEver since the death of John Sinclair at Thurso, the Earl of\r\nCaithness used every means in his power to induce such of his\r\ncountrymen as were daring enough, to show their prowess and\r\ndexterity, by making incursions into Sutherland or Strathnaver,\r\nfor the purpose of annoying the vassals and dependants of the\r\nEarl of Sutherland and his ally, Mackay. Amongst others he often\r\ncommunicated on this subject with William Kennethson, whose father,\r\nKenneth Buidhe, had always been the principal instrument in the\r\nhands of Earl George in oppressing the people of his own country.\r\nFor the furtherance of his plans he at last prevailed upon William,\r\nwho already stood rebel to the king in a criminal cause, to go into\r\nvoluntary banishment into Strathnaver, and put himself under the\r\nprotection of Mackay, to whom he was to pretend that he had left\r\nCaithness to avoid any solicitations from the Earl of Caithness to\r\ninjure the inhabitants of Strathnaver. To cover their designs they\r\ncaused a report to be spread that William Mac-Kenneth was to leave\r\nCaithness because he would not obey the orders of the earl to execute\r\nsome designs against Sir Robert Gordon, the tutor of Sutherland, and\r\nMackay, and when this false rumour had been sufficiently spread,\r\nMac-Kenneth, and his brother John, and their dependants, fled into\r\nStrathnaver and solicited the favour and protection of Mackay.\r\nThe latter received them kindly; but as William and his party had\r\nbeen long addicted to robbery and theft, he strongly advised them\r\nto abstain from such practices in all time coming; and that they\r\nmight not afterwards plead necessity as an excuse for continuing\r\ntheir depredations, he allotted them some lands to dwell on. After\r\nstaying a month or two in Strathnaver, during which time they stole\r\nsome cattle and horses out of Caithness, William received a private\r\nvisit by night from Kenneth Buidhe, his father, who had been sent by\r\nthe Earl of Caithness for the purpose of executing a contemplated\r\ndepredation in Sutherland. Mackay was then in Sutherland on a visit\r\nto his uncle, Sir Robert Gordon, which being known to William\r\nMac-Kenneth, he resolved to enter Sutherland with his party, and\r\ncarry off into Caithness all the booty they could collect. Being\r\nobserved in the glen of Loth by some of the clan Gun, collecting\r\ncattle and horses, they were immediately apprehended, with the\r\nexception of Iain-Garbh-Mac-Chonald-Mac-Mhurchidh-Mhoir, who, being\r\na very resolute man, refused to surrender, and was in consequence\r\nkilled. The prisoners were delivered to Sir Robert Gordon at Dornoch,\r\nwho committed William and his brother John to the castle of Dornoch\r\nfor trial. In the meantime two of the principal men of Mac-Kenneth’s\r\nparty were tried, convicted, and executed, and the remainder were\r\nallowed to return home on giving surety to keep the peace. This\r\noccurrence took place in the month of January 1616.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness now finished his restless career of iniquity\r\nby the perpetration of a crime which, though trivial in its\r\nconsequences, was of so highly a penal nature in itself as to bring\r\nhis own life into jeopardy. As the circumstances which led to the\r\nburning of the corn of William Innes, a servant of Lord Forbes at\r\nSanset in Caithness, and the discovery of the Earl of Caithness as\r\ninstigator, are somewhat curious, it is thought that a recital of\r\nthem may not be here out of place.\r\n\r\nAmong other persons who had suffered at the hands of the earl was\r\nhis own kinsman, William Sinclair of Dumbaith. After annoying him\r\nin a variety of ways, the earl instigated his bastard brother,\r\nHenry Sinclair, and Kenneth Buidhe, to destroy and lay waste part\r\nof Dumbaith’s lands, who, unable to resist, and being in dread of\r\npersonal risk, locked himself up in his house at Dunray, which they\r\nbesieged. William Sinclair immediately applied to John, Earl of\r\nSutherland, for assistance, who sent his friend Mackay with a party\r\nto rescue Sinclair from his perilous situation. Mackay succeeded, and\r\ncarried Sinclair along with him into Sutherland, where he remained\r\nfor a time, but he afterwards went to reside in Moray, where he died.\r\nAlthough thus cruelly persecuted and forced to become an exile from\r\nhis country by the Earl of Caithness, no entreaties could induce\r\nhim to apply for redress, choosing rather to suffer himself than to\r\nsee his relative punished. William Sinclair was succeeded by his\r\ngrandson, George Sinclair, who married a sister of Lord Forbes. By\r\nthe persuasion of his wife, who was a mere tool in the hands of the\r\nEarl of Caithness, George Sinclair was induced to execute a deed of\r\nentail, by which, failing of heirs male of his own body, he left the\r\nwhole of his lands to the earl. When the earl had obtained this deed\r\nhe began to devise means to make away with Sinclair, and actually\r\npersuaded Sinclair’s wife to assist him in this nefarious design.\r\nHaving obtained notice of this conspiracy against his life, Sinclair\r\nleft Caithness and took up his residence with his brother-in-law,\r\nLord Forbes, who received him with great kindness and hospitality,\r\nand reprobated very strongly the wicked conduct of his sister.\r\nSinclair now recalled the entail in favour of the Earl of Caithness,\r\nand made a new deed by which he conveyed his whole estate to Lord\r\nForbes. George Sinclair died soon after the execution of the deed,\r\nand having left no issue, Lord Forbes took possession of his lands of\r\nDunray and Dumbaith.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his plans to acquire Sinclair’s property, the Earl\r\nof Caithness seized every opportunity of annoying Lord Forbes in\r\nhis possessions, by oppressing his tenants and servants, in every\r\npossible way, under the pretence of discharging his duty as sheriff,\r\nto which office he had been appointed by the Earl of Huntly, on\r\noccasion of his marriage with Huntly’s sister. Complaints were made\r\nfrom time to time against the earl, on account of these proceedings,\r\nto the Privy Council of Scotland, which, in some measure, afforded\r\nredress; but to protect his tenants more effectually, Lord Forbes\r\ntook up a temporary residence in Caithness, relying upon the aid of\r\nthe house of Sutherland in case of need.\r\n\r\nAs the Earl of Caithness was aware that any direct attack on Lord\r\nForbes would be properly resented, and as any enterprise undertaken\r\nby his own people would be laid to his charge, however cautious\r\nhe might be in dealing with them, he fixed on the clan Gun as the\r\nfittest instruments for effecting his designs against Lord Forbes.\r\nBesides being the most resolute men in Caithness, always ready to\r\nundertake any desperate action, they depended more upon the Earl of\r\nSutherland and Mackay, from whom they held some lands, than upon\r\nthe Earl of Caithness; a circumstance which the latter supposed,\r\nshould the contemplated outrages of the clan Gun ever become matter\r\nof inquiry, might throw the suspicion upon the two former as the\r\nsilent instigators. Accordingly, the earl opened a negotiation with\r\nJohn Gun, chief of the clan Gun in Caithness, and with his brother,\r\nAlexander Gun, whose father he had hanged in the year 1586. In\r\nconsequence of an invitation, the two brothers, along with Alexander\r\nGun, their cousin-german, repaired to Castle Sinclair, where they\r\nmet the earl. The earl did not at first divulge his plans to all the\r\nparty; but taking Alexander Gun, the cousin, aside, he pointed out\r\nto him the injury he alleged he had sustained, in consequence of\r\nLord Forbes having obtained a footing in Caithness,--that he could\r\nno longer submit to the indignity shown him by a stranger,--that he\r\nhad made choice of him (Gun) to undertake a piece of service for\r\nhim, on performing which, he would reward him most amply; and to\r\nsecure compliance, the earl desired him to remember the many favours\r\nhe had already received from him, and how well he had treated him,\r\npromising, at the same time, to show him even greater kindness in\r\ntime coming. Alexander thereupon promised to serve the earl, though\r\nat the hazard of his life; but upon being interrogated by the earl\r\nwhether he would undertake to burn the corn of Sanset, belonging\r\nto William Innes, a servant of Lord Forbes, Gun, who had never\r\nimagined that he was to be employed in such an ignoble affair,\r\nexpressed the greatest astonishment at the proposal, and refused,\r\nin the most peremptory and indignant manner, to undertake its\r\nexecution; yet, to satisfy the earl, he told him that he would, at\r\nhis command, undertake to assassinate William Innes,--an action which\r\nhe considered less criminal and dishonourable, and more becoming a\r\ngentleman, than burning a quantity of corn! Finding him obdurate, the\r\nearl enjoined him to secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe earl next applied to the two brothers, John and Alexander,\r\nwith whom he did not find it so difficult to treat. They at first\r\nhesitated with some firmness in undertaking the business on which the\r\nearl was so intent; and they pleaded an excuse, by saying, that as\r\njustice was then more strictly executed in Scotland than formerly,\r\nthey could not expect to escape, as they had no place of safety to\r\nretreat to after the crime was committed; as a proof of which they\r\ninstanced the cases of the clan Donald and the clan Gregor, two races\r\nof people much more powerful than the clan Gun, who had been brought\r\nto the brink of ruin, and almost annihilated, under the authority\r\nof the laws. The earl replied, that as soon as they should perform\r\nthe service for him he would send them to the western isles, to\r\nsome of his acquaintances and friends, with whom they might remain\r\ntill Lord Forbes and he were reconciled, when he would obtain their\r\npardon; that in the meantime he would profess, in public, to be their\r\nenemy, but that he would be their friend secretly, and permit them to\r\nfrequent Caithness without danger. Alexander Gun, overcome at last by\r\nthe entreaties of the earl, reluctantly consented to his request, and\r\ngoing into Sanset, in the dead of night, with two accomplices, set\r\nfire to all the corn stacks which were in the barn-yard, belonging to\r\nWilliam Innes, and which were in consequence consumed. This affair\r\noccurred in the month of November, 1615. The Earl of Caithness\r\nimmediately spread a report through the whole country that Mackay’s\r\ntenants had committed this outrage, but the deception was of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nIt may be here noticed that John, sixth Earl of Sutherland, died in\r\nSeptember, 1615, and was succeeded by his eldest son, John, a boy six\r\nyears old, to whom Sir Robert Gordon, his uncle, was appointed tutor.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Gordon, having arrived in the north of Scotland, from\r\nEngland, in the month of December following, resolved to probe the\r\nmatter to the bottom, not merely on account of his nephew, Mackay,\r\nwhose men were suspected, but to satisfy Lord Forbes, who was now on\r\nfriendly terms with the house of Sutherland; but the discovery of the\r\nperpetrators soon became an easy task, in consequence of a quarrel\r\namong the clan Gun themselves, the members of which upbraided one\r\nanother as the authors of the fire-raising. Alexander Gun, the cousin\r\nof Alexander Gun, the real criminal, thereupon fled from Caithness,\r\nand sent some of his friends to Sir Robert Gordon and Donald Mackay\r\nwith these proposals:--that if they would receive him into favour,\r\nand secure him from danger, he would confess the whole circumstances,\r\nand reveal the authors of the conflagration, and that he would\r\ndeclare the whole before the Privy Council if required. On receiving\r\nthis proposal, Sir Robert Gordon appointed Alexander Gun to meet him\r\nprivately at Helmsdale, in the house of Sir Alexander Gordon, brother\r\nof Sir Robert. A meeting was accordingly held at the place appointed,\r\nat which Sir Robert and his friends agreed to do everything in their\r\npower to preserve Gun’s life; and Mackay promised, moreover, to give\r\nhim a possession in Strathie, where his father had formerly lived.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Caithness heard of Alexander Gun’s flight into\r\nSutherland he became greatly alarmed lest Alexander should reveal\r\nthe affair of Sanset; and anticipating such a result, the earl gave\r\nout everywhere that Sir Robert Gordon, Mackay, and Sir Alexander\r\nGordon, had hired some of the clan Gun to accuse him of having\r\nburnt William Innes’s corn. But this artifice was of no avail, for\r\nas soon as Lord Forbes received notice from Sir Robert Gordon of the\r\ncircumstances related by Alexander Gun, he immediately cited John\r\nGun and his brother Alexander, and their accomplices, to appear for\r\ntrial at Edinburgh, on the 2d April, 1616, to answer to the charge\r\nof burning the corn at Sanset; and he also summoned the Earl of\r\nCaithness, as sheriff of that county, to deliver them up for trial.\r\nJohn Gun, thinking that the best course he could pursue under present\r\ncircumstances was to follow the example of his cousin, Alexander,\r\nsent a message to Sir Alexander Gordon, desiring an interview with\r\nhim, which being granted, they met at Navidale. John Gun then offered\r\nto reveal everything he knew concerning the fire, on condition that\r\nhis life should be spared; but Sir Alexander observed that he could\r\ncome under no engagement, as he was uncertain how the king and the\r\ncouncil might view such a proceeding; but he promised, that as John\r\nhad not been an actor in the business, but a witness only to the\r\narrangement between his brother and the Earl of Caithness, he would\r\ndo what he could to save him, if he went to Edinburgh in compliance\r\nwith the summons.\r\n\r\nIn this state of matters, the Earl of Caithness wrote to the Marquis\r\nof Huntly, accusing Sir Robert Gordon and Mackay of a design to\r\nbring him within the reach of the law of treason, and to injure\r\nthe honour of his house by slandering him with the burning of the\r\ncorn at Sanset. The other party told the marquis that they could\r\nnot refuse to assist Lord Forbes in finding out the persons who had\r\nburned the corn at Sanset, but that they had never imagined that\r\nthe earl would have acted so base a part as to become an accomplice\r\nin such a criminal act; and farther, that as Mackay’s men were\r\nchallenged with the deed, they certainly were entitled at least to\r\nclear Mackay’s people from the charge by endeavouring to find out\r\nthe malefactors,--in all which they considered they had done the\r\nearl no wrong. The Marquis of Huntly did not fail to write the Earl\r\nof Caithness the answer he had received from Sir Robert Gordon and\r\nMackay, which grieved him exceedingly, as he was too well aware of\r\nthe consequences which would follow if the prosecution of the Guns\r\nwas persevered in.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed for the trial of the Guns, Sir Robert Gordon,\r\nMackay, and Lord Forbes, with all his friends, went to Edinburgh, and\r\nupon their arrival they entreated the council to prevent a remission\r\nin favour of the Earl of Caithness from passing the signet until the\r\naffair in hand was tried; a request with which the council complied.\r\nThe Earl of Caithness did not appear; but he sent his son, Lord\r\nBerridale, to Edinburgh, along with John Gun and all those persons\r\nwho had been summoned by Lord Forbes, with the exception of Alexander\r\nGun and his two accomplices. He alleged as his reason for not sending\r\nthem that they were not his men, being Mackay’s own tenants, and\r\ndwelling in Dilred, the property of Mackay, which was held by him\r\noff the Earl of Sutherland, who, he alleged, was bound to present\r\nthe three persons alluded to. But the lords of the council would\r\nnot admit of this excuse, and again required Lord Berridale and his\r\nfather to present the three culprits before the court on the 10th\r\nJune following, because, although they had possessions in Dilred,\r\nthey had also lands from the Earl of Caithness on which they usually\r\nresided. Besides, the deed was committed in Caithness, of which the\r\nearl was sheriff, on which account also he was bound to apprehend\r\nthem. Lord Berridale, whose character was quite the reverse of that\r\nof his father, apprehensive of the consequences of a trial, now\r\noffered satisfaction in his father’s name to Lord Forbes if he would\r\nstop the prosecution; but his lordship refused to do anything without\r\nthe previous advice and consent of Sir Robert Gordon and Mackay,\r\nwho, upon being consulted, caused articles of agreement to be drawn\r\nup, which were presented to Lord Berridale by neutral persons for\r\nhis acceptance. He, however, considering the conditions sought to be\r\nimposed upon his father too hard, rejected them.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the refusal of Lord Berridale to accede to the\r\nterms proposed, John Gun was apprehended by one of the magistrates\r\nof Edinburgh, on the application of Lord Forbes, and committed a\r\nprisoner to the jail of that city. Gun thereupon requested to see Sir\r\nRobert Gordon and Mackay, whom he entreated to use their influence\r\nto procure him his liberty, promising to declare everything he knew\r\nof the business for which he was prosecuted before the lords of the\r\ncouncil. Sir Robert Gordon and Mackay then deliberated with Lord\r\nForbes and Lord Elphinston on the subject, and they all four promised\r\nfaithfully to Gun to do everything in their power to save him, and\r\nthat they would thenceforth maintain and defend him and his cousin,\r\nAlexander Gun, against the Earl of Caithness or any person, as long\r\nas they had reason and equity on their side; besides which, Mackay\r\npromised him a liferent lease of the lands in Strathie to compensate\r\nfor his possessions in Caithness, of which he would, of course,\r\nbe deprived by the earl for revealing the latter’s connexion with\r\nthe fire-raising at Sanset. John Gun was accordingly examined the\r\nfollowing day by the lords of the council, when he confessed that the\r\nEarl of Caithness made his brother, Alexander Gun, burn the corn of\r\nSanset, and that the affair had been proposed and discussed in his\r\npresence. Alexander Gun, the cousin, was examined also at the same\r\ntime, and stated the same circumstances precisely as John Gun had\r\ndone. After examination, John and Alexander were again committed to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAs neither the Earl of Caithness nor his son, Lord Berridale,\r\ncomplied with the commands of the council to deliver up Alexander Gun\r\nand his accomplices in the month of June, they were both outlawed\r\nand denounced rebels; and were summoned and charged by Lord Forbes\r\nto appear personally at Edinburgh in the month of July immediately\r\nfollowing, to answer to the charge of causing the corn of Sanset\r\nto be burnt. This fixed determination on the part of Lord Forbes\r\nto bring the earl and his son to trial had the effect of altering\r\ntheir tone, and they now earnestly entreated him and Mackay to agree\r\nto a reconciliation on any terms; but they declined to enter into\r\nany arrangement until they had consulted Sir Robert Gordon. After\r\nobtaining Sir Robert’s consent, and a written statement of the\r\nconditions which he required from the Earl of Caithness in behalf of\r\nhis nephew, the Earl of Sutherland, the parties entered into a final\r\nagreement in the month of July, 1616. The principal heads of the\r\ncontract, which was afterwards recorded in the books of council and\r\nsession, were as follows:--That all civil actions between the parties\r\nshould be settled by the mediation of common friends,--that the Earl\r\nof Caithness and his son should pay to Lord Forbes and Mackay the\r\nsum of 20,000 merks Scots money,--that all quarrels and criminal\r\nactions should be mutually forgiven, and particularly, that the\r\nEarl of Caithness and all his friends should forgive and remit the\r\nslaughter at Thurso--that the Earl of Caithness and his son should\r\nrenounce for themselves and their heirs all jurisdiction, criminal or\r\ncivil, within Sutherland or Strathnaver, and any other jurisdiction\r\nwhich they should thereafter happen to acquire over any lands lying\r\nwithin the diocese of Caithness then pertaining, or which should\r\nafterwards belong, to the Earl of Sutherland, or his heirs,--that the\r\nEarl of Caithness should deliver Alexander Gun and his accomplices to\r\nLord Forbes,--that the earl, his son, and their heirs, should never\r\nthenceforth contend with the Earl of Sutherland for precedency in\r\nparliament or priority of place,--that the Earl of Caithness and his\r\nson, their friends and tenants, should keep the peace in time coming,\r\nunder the penalty of great sums of money, and should never molest nor\r\ntrouble the tenants of the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Forbes,--that\r\nthe Earl of Caithness, his son, or their friends, should not receive\r\nnor harbour any fugitives from Sutherland or Strathnaver,--and that\r\nthere should be good friendship and amity kept amongst them in all\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this agreement, the two sons of Kenneth Buy,\r\nWilliam and John before-mentioned, were delivered to Lord Berridale,\r\nwho gave security for their keeping the peace; and John Gun and\r\nAlexander his cousin were released, and delivered to Lord Forbes\r\nand Mackay, who gave surety to the lords of the council to present\r\nthem for trial whenever required; and as the Earl of Caithness had\r\ndeprived them of their possessions in Caithness on account of the\r\ndiscovery they had made, Mackay, who had lately been knighted by the\r\nking, gave them lands in Strathnaver as he had promised. Matters\r\nbeing thus settled, Lord Berridale presented himself before the court\r\nat Edinburgh to abide his trial; but no person of course appearing\r\nagainst him, the trial was postponed. The Earl of Caithness, however,\r\nfailing to appear, the diet against him was continued till the 28th\r\nof August following.\r\n\r\nAlthough the king was well pleased, on account of the peace which\r\nsuch an adjustment would produce in his northern dominions, with\r\nthe agreement which had been entered into, and the proceedings\r\nwhich followed thereon, all of which were made known to him by the\r\nPrivy Council; yet, as the passing over such a flagrant act as\r\nwilful fire-raising, without punishment, might prove pernicious, he\r\nwrote a letter to the Privy Council of Scotland, commanding them to\r\nprosecute, with all severity, those who were guilty of, or accessory\r\nto, the crime. Lord Berridale was thereupon apprehended on suspicion,\r\nand committed a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh; and his father,\r\nperceiving the determination of the king to prosecute the authors of\r\nthe fire, again declined to appear for trial on the appointed day,\r\non which account he was again outlawed, and declared a rebel as the\r\nguilty author.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity Lord Berridale had recourse to Sir Robert Gordon,\r\nthen resident at court, for his aid. He wrote him a letter,\r\nentreating him that, as all controversies were now settled, he\r\nwould, in place of an enemy become a faithful friend,--that for his\r\nown part, he, Lord Berridale, had been always innocent of the jars\r\nand dissensions which had happened between the two families,--that\r\nhe was also innocent of the crime of which he was charged,--and\r\nthat he wished his majesty to be informed by Sir Robert of these\r\ncircumstances, hoping that he would order him to be released from\r\nconfinement. Sir Robert answered, that he had long desired a\r\nperfect agreement between the houses of Sutherland and Caithness,\r\nwhich he would endeavour to maintain during his administration in\r\nSutherland,--that he would intercede with the king in behalf of his\r\nlordship to the utmost of his power,--that all disputes being now\r\nat an end, he would be his faithful friend,--that he had a very\r\ndifferent opinion of his disposition from that he entertained of his\r\nfather, the earl; and he concluded by entreating him to be careful to\r\npreserve the friendship which had been now commenced between them.\r\n\r\nAs the king understood that Lord Berridale was supposed to be\r\ninnocent of the crime with which he and his father stood charged,\r\nand as he could not, without a verdict against Berridale, proceed\r\nagainst the family of Caithness by forfeiture, in consequence of his\r\nlordship having been infeft many years before in his father’s estate,\r\nhis majesty, on the earnest entreaty of the then bishop of Ross, Sir\r\nRobert Gordon, and Sir James Spence of Wormistoun, was pleased to\r\nremit and forgive the crime on the following conditions:--1st. That\r\nthe Earl of Caithness and his son should give satisfaction to their\r\ncreditors, who were constantly annoying his majesty with clamours\r\nagainst the earl, and craving justice at his hands. 2d. That the\r\nEarl of Caithness, with consent of Lord Berridale, should freely\r\nrenounce and resign perpetually, into the hands of his majesty, the\r\nheritable sheriffship and justiciary of Caithness. 3d. That the Earl\r\nof Caithness should deliver the three criminals who had burnt the\r\ncorn, that public justice might be satisfied upon them, as a terror\r\nand example to others. 4th. That the Earl of Caithness, with consent\r\nof Lord Berridale, should give and resign _in perpetuum_ to the\r\nbishop of Caithness, the house of Strabister, with as many of the\r\nfeu lands of that bishopric as should amount to the yearly value of\r\ntwo thousand merks Scots money, for the purpose of augmenting the\r\nincome of the bishop, which was at that time small in consequence\r\nof the greater part of his lands being in the hands of the earl.\r\nCommissioners were sent down from London to Caithness in October\r\n1616, to see that these conditions were complied with. The second and\r\nlast conditions were immediately implemented; and as the earl and\r\nhis son promised to give satisfaction to their creditors, and to do\r\neverything in their power to apprehend the burners of the corn, the\r\nlatter was released from the castle of Edinburgh, and directions were\r\ngiven for drawing up a remission and pardon to the Earl of Caithness.\r\nLord Berridale, however, had scarcely been released from the castle,\r\nwhen he was again imprisoned within the jail of Edinburgh, at the\r\ninstance of Sir James Home of Cowdenknowes, his cousin german, who\r\nhad become surety for him and his father to their creditors for\r\nlarge sums of money. The earl himself narrowly escaped the fate of\r\nhis son and retired to Caithness, but his creditors had sufficient\r\ninterest to prevent his remission from passing till they should be\r\nsatisfied. With consent of the creditors the council of Scotland\r\ngave him a personal protection, from time to time, to enable him to\r\ncome to Edinburgh for the purpose of settling with them, but he made\r\nno arrangement, and returned privately into Caithness before the\r\nexpiration of the _supersedere_ which had been granted him, leaving\r\nhis son to suffer all the miseries of a prison. After enduring a\r\ncaptivity of five years, Lord Berridale was released from prison\r\nby the good offices of the Earl of Enzie, and put, for behoof of\r\nhimself, and his own and his father’s creditors, in possession of\r\nthe family estates from which his father was driven by Sir Robert\r\nGordon acting under a royal warrant, a just punishment for the many\r\nenormities of a long and misspent life.[208]\r\n\r\nDesperate as the fortunes of the Earl of Caithness were even previous\r\nto the disposal of his estates, he most unexpectedly found an ally\r\nin Sir Donald Mackay, who had taken offence at Sir Robert Gordon,\r\nand who, being a man of quick resolution and of an inconstant\r\ndisposition, determined to forsake the house of Sutherland, and to\r\ningratiate himself with the Earl of Caithness. He alleged various\r\ncauses of discontent as a reason for his conduct, one of the chief\r\nbeing connected with pecuniary considerations; for having, as he\r\nalleged, burdened his estates with debts incurred for some years\r\npast in following the house of Sutherland, he thought that, in time\r\ncoming, he might, by procuring the favour of the Earl of Caithness,\r\nturn the same to his own advantage and that of his countrymen.\r\nMoreover, as he had been induced to his own prejudice to grant\r\ncertain life-rent tacks of the lands of Strathie and Dilred to John\r\nand Alexander Gun, and others of the clan Gun for revealing the\r\naffair of Sanset, he thought that by joining the Earl of Caithness,\r\nthese might be destroyed, by which means he would get back his lands\r\nwhich he meant to convey to his brother, John Mackay, as a portion;\r\nand he, moreover, expected that the earl would give him and his\r\ncountrymen some possessions in Caithness. But the chief ground of\r\ndiscontent on the part of Sir Donald Mackay was an action brought\r\nagainst him and Lord Forbes before the court of session, to recover\r\na contract entered into between the last Earl of Sutherland and\r\nMackay, in the year 1613, relative to their marches and other matters\r\nof controversy, which being considered by Mackay as prejudicial to\r\nhim, he had endeavoured to get destroyed through the agency of some\r\npersons about Lord Forbes, into whose keeping the deed had been\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\nAfter brooding over these subjects of discontent for some years,\r\nMackay, in the year 1618, suddenly resolved to break with the house\r\nof Sutherland, and to form an alliance with the Earl of Caithness,\r\nwho had long borne a mortal enmity at that family. Accordingly,\r\nMackay sent John Sutherland, his cousin-german, into Caithness to\r\nrequest a private conference with the earl in any part of Caithness\r\nhe might appoint. This offer was too tempting to be rejected by the\r\nearl, who expected, by a reconciliation with Sir Donald Mackay, to\r\nturn the same to his own personal gratification and advantage. In the\r\nfirst place, he hoped to revenge himself upon the clan Gun, who were\r\nhis principal enemies, and upon Sir Donald himself, by detaching him\r\nfrom his superior, the Earl of Sutherland, and from the friendship\r\nof his uncles, who had always supported him in all his difficulties.\r\nIn the second place, he expected that, by alienating Mackay from the\r\nduty and affection he owed the house of Sutherland, that he would\r\nweaken his power and influence. And lastly, he trusted that Mackay\r\nwould not only be prevailed upon to discharge his own part, but would\r\nalso persuade Lord Forbes to discharge his share of the sum of 20,000\r\nmerks Scots, which he and his son, Lord Berridale, had become bound\r\nto pay them, on account of the burning at Sanset.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness having at once agreed to Mackay’s proposal, a\r\nmeeting was held by appointment in the neighbourhood of Dunray, in\r\nthe parish of Reay, in Caithness. The parties met in the night-time,\r\naccompanied each by three men only. After much discussion, and\r\nvarious conferences, which were continued for two or three days,\r\nthey resolved to destroy the clan Gun, and particularly John Gun,\r\nand Alexander his cousin. To please the earl, Mackay undertook to\r\ndespatch these last, as they were obnoxious to him, on account of\r\nthe part they had taken against him, in revealing the burning at\r\nSanset. They persuaded themselves that the house of Sutherland would\r\ndefend the clan, as they were bound to do by their promise, and that\r\nthat house would be thus drawn into some snare. To confirm their\r\nfriendship, the earl and Mackay arranged that John Mackay, the only\r\nbrother of Sir Donald, should marry a niece of the earl, a daughter\r\nof James Sinclair of Murkle, who was a mortal enemy of all the clan\r\nGun. Having thus planned the line of conduct they were to follow,\r\nthey parted, after swearing to continue in perpetual friendship.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the private way in which the meeting was held,\r\naccounts of it immediately spread through the kingdom; and every\r\nperson wondered at the motives which could induce Sir Donald Mackay\r\nto take such a step so unadvisedly, without the knowledge of his\r\nuncles, Sir Robert and Sir Alexander Gordon, or of Lord Forbes. The\r\nclan Gun receiving secret intelligence of the design upon them, from\r\ndifferent friendly quarters, retired into Sutherland. The clan were\r\nastonished at Mackay’s conduct, as he had promised, at Edinburgh, in\r\npresence of Lords Forbes and Elphingston and Sir Robert Gordon, in\r\nthe year 1616, to be a perpetual friend to them, and chiefly to John\r\nGun and to his cousin Alexander.\r\n\r\nAfter Mackay returned from Caithness, he sent his cousin-german,\r\nAngus Mackay of Bighouse, to Sutherland, to acquaint his uncles,\r\nwho had received notice of the meeting, that his object in meeting\r\nthe Earl of Caithness was for his own personal benefit, and that\r\nnothing had been done to their prejudice. Angus Mackay met Sir Robert\r\nGordon at Dunrobin, to whom he delivered his kinsman’s message,\r\nwhich, he said, he hoped Sir Robert would take in good part, adding\r\nthat Sir Donald would show, in presence of both his uncles, that\r\nthe clan Gun had failed in duty and fidelity to him and the house\r\nof Sutherland, since they had revealed the burning; and therefore,\r\nthat if his uncles would not forsake John Gun, and some others\r\nof the clan, he would adhere to them no longer. Sir Robert Gordon\r\nreturned a verbal answer by Angus Mackay, that when Sir Donald came\r\nin person to Dunrobin to clear himself, as in duty he was bound to\r\ndo, he would then accept of his excuse, and not till then. And he\r\nat the same time wrote a letter to Sir Donald, to the effect that\r\nfor his own (Sir Robert’s) part, he did not much regard Mackay’s\r\nsecret journey to Caithness, and his reconciliation with Earl George,\r\nwithout his knowledge or the advice of Lord Forbes; and that, however\r\nunfavourable the world might construe it, he would endeavour to\r\ncolour it in the best way he could, for Mackay’s own credit. He\r\ndesired Mackay to consider that a man’s reputation was exceedingly\r\ntender, and that if it were once blemished, though wrongfully, there\r\nwould still some blot remain, because the greater part of the world\r\nwould always incline to speak the worst; that whatever had been\r\narranged in that journey, between him and the Earl of Caithness,\r\nbeneficial to Mackay and not prejudicial to the house of Sutherland,\r\nhe should be always ready to assist him therein, although concluded\r\nwithout his consent. As to the clan Gun, he could not with honesty or\r\ncredit abandon them, and particularly John and his cousin Alexander,\r\nuntil tried and found guilty, as he had promised faithfully to be\r\ntheir friend, for revealing the affair of Sanset; that he had made\r\nthem this promise at the earnest desire and entreaty of Sir Donald\r\nhimself; that the house of Sutherland did always esteem their truth\r\nand constancy to be their greatest jewel; and seeing that he and his\r\nbrother, Sir Alexander, were almost the only branches of it then of\r\nage or man’s estate, they would endeavour to prove true and constant\r\nwheresoever they did possess friendship; and that neither the house\r\nof Sutherland, nor any greater house whereof they had the honour to\r\nbe descended, should have the least occasion to be ashamed of them\r\nin that respect; that if Sir Donald had quarrelled or challenged the\r\nclan Gun, before going into Caithness and his arrangement with Earl\r\nGeorge, the clan might have been suspected; but he saw no reason to\r\nforsake them until they were found guilty of some great offence.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Gordon, therefore, acting as tutor for his nephew, took\r\nthe clan Gun under his immediate protection, with the exception of\r\nAlexander Gun, the burner of the corn, and his accomplices. John Gun\r\nthereupon demanded a trial before his friends, that they might hear\r\nwhat Sir Donald had to lay to his charge. John and his kinsmen were\r\nacquitted, and declared innocent of any offence, either against the\r\nhouse of Sutherland or Mackay, since the fact of the burning.\r\n\r\nSir Donald Mackay, dissatisfied with this result, went to Edinburgh\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining a commission against the clan Gun from\r\nthe council, for old crimes committed by them before his majesty\r\nhad left Scotland for England; but he was successfully opposed in\r\nthis by Sir Robert Gordon, who wrote a letter to the Lord-Chancellor\r\nand to the Earl of Melrose, afterwards Earl of Haddington and\r\nLord Privy Seal, showing that the object of Sir Donald, in asking\r\nsuch a commission, was to break the king’s peace, and to breed\r\nfresh troubles in Caithness. Disappointed in this attempt, Sir\r\nDonald returned home to Strathnaver, and, in the month of April,\r\n1618, he went to Braill, in Caithness, where he met the earl, with\r\nwhom he continued three nights. On this occasion they agreed to\r\ndespatch Alexander Gun, the burner of the corn, lest Lord Forbes\r\nshould request the earl to deliver him up; and they hoped that, in\r\nconsequence of such an occurrence, the tribe might be ensnared.\r\nBefore parting, the earl delivered to Mackay some old writs of\r\ncertain lands in Strathnaver and other places within the diocese of\r\nCaithness, which belonged to Sir Donald’s predecessors; by means\r\nof which the earl thought he would put Sir Donald by the ears with\r\nhis uncles, expecting him to bring an action against the Earl of\r\nSutherland, for the warrandice of Strathnaver, and thus free himself\r\nfrom the superiority of the Earl of Sutherland.\r\n\r\nShortly after this meeting was held, Sir Donald entered Sutherland\r\nprivately, for the purpose of capturing John Gun; but, after\r\nlurking two nights in Golspie, watching Gun, without effect, he was\r\ndiscovered by Adam Gordon of Kilcalmkill, a trusty dependant of the\r\nhouse of Sutherland, and thereupon returned to his country. In the\r\nmeantime the Earl of Caithness, who sought every opportunity to\r\nquarrel with the house of Sutherland, endeavoured to pick a quarrel\r\nwith Sir Alexander Gordon about some sheilings which he alleged the\r\nlatter’s servants had erected beyond the marches between Torrish, in\r\nStrathully, and the lands of Berridale. The dispute, however, came to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Robert Gordon heard of these occurrences in the north, he\r\nreturned home from Edinburgh, where he had been for some time; and,\r\non his return, he visited the Marquis of Huntly at Strathbogie, who\r\nadvised him to be on his guard, as he had received notice from the\r\nEarl of Caithness that Sir Donald meant to create some disturbances\r\nin Sutherland. The object the earl had in view, in acquainting the\r\nmarquis with Mackay’s intentions, was to screen himself from any\r\nimputation of being concerned in Mackay’s plans, although he favoured\r\nthem in secret. As soon as Sir Robert Gordon was informed of Mackay’s\r\nintentions he hastened to Sutherland; but before his arrival there,\r\nSir Donald had entered Strathully with a body of men, in quest of\r\nAlexander Gun, the burner, against whom he had obtained letters\r\nof caption. He expected that if he could find Gun in Strathully,\r\nwhere the clan of that name chiefly dwelt, they, and particularly\r\nJohn Gun, would protect Alexander, and that in consequence he would\r\nensnare John Gun and his tribe, and bring them within the reach\r\nof the law, for having resisted the king’s authority; but Mackay\r\nwas disappointed in his expectations, for Alexander Gun escaped,\r\nand none of the clan Gun made the least movement, not knowing how\r\nSir Robert Gordon was affected towards Alexander Gun. In entering\r\nStrathully, without acquainting his uncles of his intention, Sir\r\nDonald had acted improperly, and contrary to his duty, as the vassal\r\nof the house of Sutherland: but, not satisfied with this trespass,\r\nhe went to Badinloch, and there apprehended William M’Corkill, one\r\nof the clan Gun, and carried him along with him towards Strathnaver,\r\non the ground that he had favoured the escape of Alexander Gun;\r\nbut M’Corkill escaped while his keepers were asleep, and went to\r\nDunrobin, where he met Sir Alexander Gordon, to whom he related the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nHearing that Sir Robert Gordon was upon his journey to Sutherland,\r\nMackay left Badinloch in haste, and went privately to the parish of\r\nCulmaly, taking up his residence in Golspietour with John Gordon,\r\nyounger of Embo, till he should learn in what manner Sir Robert would\r\nact towards him. Mackay, perceiving that his presence in Golspietour\r\nwas likely to lead to a tumult among the people, sent his men home to\r\nStrathnaver, and went himself the following day, taking only one man\r\nalong with him, to Dunrobin castle, where he met Sir Robert Gordon,\r\nwho received him kindly according to his usual manner; and after\r\nSir Robert had opened his mind very freely to him on the bad course\r\nhe was pursuing, he began to talk to him about a reconciliation\r\nwith John Gun; but Sir Donald would not hear of any accommodation,\r\nand after staying a few days at Dunrobin, returned home to his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSir Donald Mackay, perceiving the danger in which he had placed\r\nhimself, and seeing that he could put no reliance on the hollow and\r\ninconstant friendship of the Earl of Caithness, became desirous of\r\na reconciliation with his uncles, and with this view he offered to\r\nrefer all matters in dispute to the arbitrament of friends, and to\r\nmake such satisfaction for his offences as they might enjoin. As Sir\r\nRobert Gordon still had a kindly feeling towards Mackay, and as the\r\nstate in which the affairs of the house of Sutherland stood during\r\nthe minority of his nephew, the earl, could not conveniently admit of\r\nfollowing out hostile measures against Mackay, Sir Robert embraced\r\nhis offer. The parties, therefore, met at Tain, and matters being\r\ndiscussed in presence of Sir Alexander Gordon of Navidale, George\r\nMonroe of Milntoun, and John Monroe of Leamlair, they adjudged that\r\nSir Donald should send Angus Mackay of Bighouse, and three gentlemen\r\nof the Slaight-ean-Aberigh, to Dunrobin, there to remain prisoners\r\nduring Sir Robert’s pleasure, as a punishment for apprehending\r\nWilliam M’Corkill at Badinloch. After settling some other matters\r\nof little moment, the parties agreed to hold another meeting for\r\nadjusting all remaining questions, at Elgin, in the month of June of\r\nthe following year, 1619. Sir Donald wished to include Gordon of Embo\r\nand others of his friends in Sutherland in this arrangement; but as\r\nthey were vassals of the house of Sutherland, Sir Robert would not\r\nallow Mackay to treat for them.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1618, a disturbance took place in\r\nconsequence of a quarrel between George, Lord Gordon, Earl of\r\nEnzie, and Sir Lauchlan Macintosh, chief of the clan Chattan, which\r\narose out of the following circumstances:--When the earl went into\r\nLochaber, in the year 1613, in pursuit of the clan Cameron, he\r\nrequested Macintosh to accompany him, both on account of his being\r\nthe vassal of the Marquis of Huntly, the earl’s father, and also\r\non account of the ancient enmity which had always existed between\r\nthe clan Chattan and clan Cameron, in consequence of the latter\r\nkeeping forcible possession of certain lands belonging to the former\r\nin Lochaber. To induce Macintosh to join him, the earl promised to\r\ndispossess the clan Cameron of the lands belonging to Macintosh,\r\nand to restore him to the possession of them; but, by advice of the\r\nlaird of Grant, his father-in-law, who was an enemy of the house of\r\nHuntly, he declined to accompany the earl in his expedition. The earl\r\nwas greatly displeased at Macintosh’s refusal, which afterwards led\r\nto some disputes between them. A few years after the date of this\r\nexpedition--in which the earl subdued the clan Cameron, and took\r\ntheir chief prisoner, whom he imprisoned at Inverness in the year\r\n1614--Macintosh obtained a commission against Macronald, younger of\r\nMoidart, and his brother, Donald Glass, for laying waste his lands in\r\nLochaber; and, having collected all his friends, he entered Lochaber\r\nfor the purpose of apprehending them, but, being unsuccessful in\r\nhis attempt, he returned home. As Macintosh conceived that he had\r\na right to the services of all his clan, some of whom were tenants\r\nand dependants of the Marquis of Huntly, he ordered these to follow\r\nhim, and compelled such of them as were refractory to accompany him\r\ninto Lochaber. This proceeding gave offence to the Earl of Enzie,\r\nwho summoned Macintosh before the lords of the Privy Council for\r\nhaving, as he asserted, exceeded his commission. He, moreover, got\r\nMacintosh’s commission recalled, and obtained a new commission in his\r\nown favour from the lords of the council, under which he invaded\r\nLochaber, and expelled Macronald and his brother Donald from that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs Macintosh held certain lands from the earl and his father for\r\nservices to be done, which the earl alleged had not been performed by\r\nMacintosh agreeably to the tenor of his titles, the earl brought an\r\naction against Macintosh in the year 1618 for evicting these lands,\r\non the ground of his not having implemented the conditions on which\r\nhe held them. And, as the earl had a right to the tithes of Culloden,\r\nwhich belonged to Macintosh, he served him, at the same time, with\r\nan inhibition, prohibiting him to dispose of these tithes. As the\r\ntime for tithing drew near, Macintosh, by advice of the clan Kenzie\r\nand the Grants, circulated a report that he intended to oppose the\r\nearl in any attempt he might make to take possession of the tithes\r\nof Culloden in kind, because such a practice had never before been\r\nin use, and that he would try the issue of an action of spuilzie, if\r\nbrought against him. Although the earl was much incensed at such a\r\nthreat on the part of his own vassal, yet, being a privy counsellor,\r\nand desirous of showing a good example in keeping the peace, he\r\nabstained from enforcing his right; but, having formerly obtained a\r\ndecree against Macintosh for the value of the tithes of the preceding\r\nyears, he sent two messengers-at-arms to poind and distrain the corns\r\nupon the ground under that warrant. The messengers were, however,\r\nresisted by Macintosh’s servants, and forced to desist from the\r\nexecution of their duty. The earl, in consequence, pursued Macintosh\r\nand his servants before the Privy Council, and got them denounced\r\nand proclaimed rebels to the king. He, thereupon, collected a number\r\nof his particular friends with the design of carrying his decree\r\ninto execution, by distraining the crop at Culloden and carrying it\r\nto Inverness. Macintosh prepared himself to resist, by fortifying\r\nthe house of Culloden and laying in a large quantity of ammunition;\r\nand having collected all the corn within shot of the castle and\r\ncommitted the charge of it to his two uncles, Duncan and Lauchlan,\r\nhe waited for the approach of the earl. As the earl was fully aware\r\nof Macintosh’s preparations, and that the clan Chattan, the Grants,\r\nand the clan Kenzie, had promised to assist Macintosh in opposing\r\nthe execution of his warrant, he wrote to Sir Robert Gordon, tutor\r\nof Sutherland, to meet him at Culloden on the 5th of November, 1618,\r\nbeing the day fixed by him for enforcing his decree. On receipt of\r\nthis letter, Sir Robert Gordon left Sutherland for Bog-a-Gight, where\r\nthe Marquis of Huntly and his son then were, and on his way paid a\r\nvisit to Macintosh with the view of bringing about a compromise; but\r\nMacintosh, who was a young man of a headstrong disposition, refused\r\nto listen to any proposals, and rode post-haste to Edinburgh, from\r\nwhich he went privately into England.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Earl of Enzie having collected his friends,\r\nto the number of 1,100 horsemen well appointed and armed, and 600\r\nHighlanders on foot, came to Inverness with this force on the day\r\nappointed, and, after consulting his principal officers, marched\r\nforwards towards Culloden. When he arrived within view of the castle,\r\nthe earl sent Sir Robert Gordon to Duncan Macintosh, who, with his\r\nbrother, commanded the house, to inform him that, in consequence of\r\nhis nephew’s extraordinary boasting, he had come thither to put his\r\nmajesty’s laws in execution, and to carry off the corn which of right\r\nbelonged to him. To this message Duncan replied, that he did not\r\nmean to prevent the earl from taking away what belonged to him, but\r\nthat, in case of attack, he would defend the castle which had been\r\ncommitted to his charge. Sir Robert, on his return, begged the earl\r\nto send Lord Lovat, who had some influence with Duncan Macintosh, to\r\nendeavour to prevail on him to surrender the castle. At the desire\r\nof the earl, Lord Lovat accordingly went to the house of Culloden,\r\naccompanied by Sir Robert Gordon and George Monroe of Milntoun, and,\r\nafter some entreaty, Macintosh agreed to surrender at discretion;\r\na party thereupon took possession of the house, and sent the keys\r\nto the earl. He was, however, so well pleased with the conduct of\r\nMacintosh, that he sent back the keys to him, and as neither the clan\r\nChattan, the Grants, nor the clan Kenzie, appeared to oppose him,\r\nhe disbanded his party and returned home to Bog-a-Gight. He did not\r\neven carry off the corn, but gave it to Macintosh’s grandmother, who\r\nenjoyed the life-rent of the lands of Culloden as her jointure.\r\n\r\nAs the Earl of Enzie had other claims against Sir Lauchlan Macintosh,\r\nhe cited him before the lords of council and session, but failing\r\nto appear, he was again denounced rebel, and outlawed for his\r\ndisobedience. Sir Lauchlan, who was then in England at court,\r\ninformed the king of the earl’s proceedings, which he described\r\nas harsh and illegal, and, to counteract the effect which such a\r\nstatement might have upon the mind of his majesty, the earl posted\r\nto London and laid before him a true statement of matters. The\r\nconsequence was, that Sir Lauchlan was sent home to Scotland and\r\ncommitted to the castle of Edinburgh, until he should give the earl\r\nfull satisfaction. This step appears to have brought him to reason,\r\nand induced him to apply, through the mediation of some friends,\r\nfor a reconciliation with the earl, which took place accordingly,\r\nat Edinburgh, in the year 1619. Sir Lauchlan, however, became bound\r\nto pay a large sum of money to the earl, part of which the latter\r\nafterwards remitted. The laird of Grant, by whose advice Macintosh\r\nhad acted in opposing the earl, also submitted to the latter; but\r\nthe reconciliation was more nominal than real, for the earl was\r\nafterwards obliged to protect the chief of the clan Cameron against\r\nthem, and this circumstance gave rise to many dissensions between\r\nthem and the earl, which ended only with the lives of Macintosh and\r\nthe laird of Grant, who both died in the year 1622, when the ward\r\nof part of Macintosh’s lands fell to the earl, as his superior,\r\nduring the minority of his son. The Earl of Seaforth and his clan,\r\nwho had also favoured the designs of Macintosh, were in like manner\r\nreconciled, at the same time, to the Earl of Enzie, at Aberdeen,\r\nthrough the mediation of the Earl of Dunfermline, the Chancellor of\r\nScotland, whose daughter the Earl of Seaforth had married.[209]\r\n\r\nIn no part of the Highlands did the spirit of faction operate so\r\npowerfully, or reign with greater virulence, than in Sutherland\r\nand Caithness and the adjacent country. The jealousies and strifes\r\nwhich existed for such a length of time between the two great\r\nrival families of Sutherland and Caithness, and the warfare which\r\nthese occasioned, sowed the seeds of a deep-rooted hostility, which\r\nextended its baneful influence among all their followers, dependants,\r\nand friends, and retarded their advancement. The most trivial\r\noffences were often magnified into the greatest crimes, and bodies\r\nof men, animated by the deadliest hatred, were instantly congregated\r\nto avenge imaginary wrongs. It would be almost an endless task to\r\nrelate the many disputes and differences which occurred during the\r\nseventeenth century in these distracted districts; but as a short\r\naccount of the principal events is necessary in a work of this\r\nnature, we again proceed agreeably to our plan.\r\n\r\nThe resignation which the Earl of Caithness was compelled to make of\r\npart of the feu lands of the bishopric of Caithness, into the hands\r\nof the bishop, as before related, was a measure which preyed upon\r\nhis mind, naturally restless and vindictive, and in consequence he\r\ncontinually annoyed the bishop’s servants and tenants. His hatred was\r\nmore especially directed against Robert Monroe of Aldie, commissary\r\nof Caithness, who always acted as chamberlain to the bishop, and\r\nfactor in the diocese, whom he took every opportunity to molest.\r\nThe earl had a domestic servant, James Sinclair of Dyren, who had\r\npossessed part of the lands which he had been compelled to resign,\r\nand which were now tenanted by Thomas Lindsay, brother-uterine\r\nof Robert Monroe, the commissary. This James Sinclair, at the\r\ninstigation of the earl, quarrelled with Thomas Lindsay, who was\r\npassing at the time near the earl’s house in Thurso, and, after\r\nchanging some hard words, Sinclair inflicted a deadly wound upon\r\nhim, of which he shortly thereafter died. Sinclair immediately fled\r\nto Edinburgh, and thence to London, to meet Sir Andrew Sinclair, who\r\nwas transacting some business for the king of Denmark there, that he\r\nmight intercede with the king for a pardon; but his majesty refused\r\nto grant it, and Sinclair, for better security, went to Denmark along\r\nwith Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nAs Robert Monroe did not consider his person safe in Caithness under\r\nsuch circumstances, he retired into Sutherland for a time. He then\r\npursued James Sinclair and his master, the Earl of Caithness, for\r\nthe slaughter of his brother, Thomas Lindsay; but, not appearing for\r\ntrial on the day appointed, they were both outlawed, and denounced\r\nrebels. Hearing that Sinclair was in London, Monroe hastened thither,\r\nand in his own name and that of the bishop of Caithness, laid a\r\ncomplaint before his majesty against the earl and his servant.\r\nHis majesty thereupon wrote to the Lords of the Privy Council of\r\nScotland, desiring them to adopt the most speedy and rigorous\r\nmeasures to suppress the oppressions of the earl, that his subjects\r\nin the north who were well affected might live in safety and peace;\r\nand to enable them the more effectually to punish the earl, his\r\nmajesty ordered them to keep back the remission that had been granted\r\nfor the affair at Sanset, which had not yet been delivered to him.\r\nHis majesty also directed the Privy Council, with all secrecy and\r\nspeed, to give a commission to Sir Robert Gordon to apprehend the\r\nearl, or force him to leave the kingdom, and to take possession of\r\nall his castles for his majesty’s behoof; that he should also compel\r\nthe landed proprietors of Caithness to find surety, not only for\r\nkeeping the king’s peace in time coming, but also for their personal\r\nappearance at Edinburgh twice every year, as the West Islanders were\r\nbound to do, to answer to such complaints as might be made against\r\nthem. The letter containing these instructions is dated from Windsor,\r\n25th May, 1621.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council, on receipt of this letter, communicated the\r\nsame to Sir Robert Gordon, who was then in Edinburgh; but he\r\nexcused himself from accepting the commission offered him, lest\r\nhis acceptance might be construed as proceeding from spleen and\r\nmalice against the Earl of Caithness. This answer, however, did not\r\nsatisfy the Privy Council, which insisted that he should accept the\r\ncommission; he eventually did so, but on condition that the council\r\nshould furnish him with shipping and the munitions of war, and all\r\nother necessaries to force the earl to yield, in case he should\r\nfortify either Castle Sinclair or Ackergill, and withstand a siege.\r\n\r\nWhile the Privy Council were deliberating on this matter, Sir\r\nRobert Gordon took occasion to speak to Lord Berridale, who was\r\nstill a prisoner for debt in the jail of Edinburgh, respecting the\r\ncontemplated measures against the earl, his father. As Sir Robert was\r\nstill very unwilling to enter upon such an enterprise, he advised\r\nhis lordship to undertake the business, by engaging in which he\r\nmight not only get himself relieved of the claims against him, save\r\nhis country from the dangers which threatened it, but also keep\r\npossession of his castles; and that as his father had treated him\r\nin the most unnatural manner, by suffering him to remain so long in\r\nprison without taking any steps to obtain his liberation, he would be\r\njustified, in the eyes of the world, in accepting the offer now made.\r\nBeing encouraged by Lord Gordon, Earl of Enzie, to whom Sir Robert\r\nGordon’s proposal had been communicated, to embrace the offer, Lord\r\nBerridale offered to undertake the service without any charge to his\r\nmajesty, and that he would, before being liberated, give security to\r\nhis creditors, either to return to prison after he had executed the\r\ncommission, or satisfy them for their claims against him. The Privy\r\nCouncil embraced at once Lord Berridale’s proposal, but, although the\r\nEarl of Enzie offered himself as surety for his lordship’s return to\r\nprison after the service was over, the creditors refused to consent\r\nto his liberation, and thus the matter dropped. Sir Robert Gordon was\r\nagain urged by the council to accept the commission, and to make the\r\nmatter more palatable to him, they granted the commission to him and\r\nthe Earl of Enzie jointly, both of whom accepted it. As the council,\r\nhowever, had no command from the king to supply the commissioners\r\nwith shipping and warlike stores, they delayed proceedings till they\r\nshould receive instructions from his majesty touching that point.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Caithness was informed of the proceedings\r\ncontemplated against him, and that Sir Robert Gordon had been\r\nemployed by a commission from his majesty to act in the matter,\r\nhe wrote to the Lords of the Privy Council, asserting that he was\r\ninnocent of the death of Thomas Lindsay; that his reason for not\r\nappearing at Edinburgh to abide his trial for that crime, was not\r\nthat he had been in any shape privy to the slaughter, but for fear\r\nof his creditors, who, he was afraid, would apprehend and imprison\r\nhim; and promising, that if his majesty would grant him a protection\r\nand safe-conduct, he would find security to abide trial for the\r\nslaughter of Thomas Lindsay. On receipt of this letter, the lords of\r\nthe council promised him a protection, and in the month of August,\r\nhis brother, James Sinclair of Murkle, and Sir John Sinclair of\r\nGreenland, became sureties for his appearance at Edinburgh, at the\r\ntime prescribed for his appearance to stand trial. Thus the execution\r\nof the commission was in the meantime delayed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the refusal of Lord Berridale’s creditors to consent\r\nto his liberation, Lord Gordon afterwards did all in his power to\r\naccomplish it, and ultimately succeeded in obtaining this consent,\r\nby giving his own personal security either to satisfy the creditors,\r\nor deliver up Lord Berridale into their hands. His lordship was\r\naccordingly released from prison, and returned to Caithness in\r\nthe year 1621, after a confinement of five years. As his final\r\nenlargement from jail depended upon his obtaining the means of paying\r\nhis creditors, and as his father, the earl, staid at home consuming\r\nthe rents of his estates, in rioting and licentiousness, without\r\npaying any part either of the principal or interest of his debts,\r\nand without feeling the least uneasiness at his son’s confinement,\r\nLord Berridale, immediately on his return, assisted by his friends,\r\nattempted to apprehend his father, so as to get the family estates\r\ninto his own possession; but without success.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the earl’s creditors, wearied out with the delay\r\nwhich had taken place in liquidating their debts, grew exceedingly\r\nclamorous, and some of them took a journey to Caithness in the\r\nmonth of April, 1622, to endeavour to effect a settlement with the\r\nearl personally. All, however, that they obtained were fair words,\r\nand a promise from the earl that he would speedily follow them to\r\nEdinburgh, and satisfy them of all demands; but he failed to perform\r\nhis promise. About this time, a sort of reconciliation appears to\r\nhave taken place between the earl and his son, Lord Berridale; but\r\nit was of short duration. On this new disagreement breaking out,\r\nthe earl lost the favour and friendship not only of his brothers,\r\nJames and Sir John, but also that of his best friends in Caithness.\r\nLord Berridale, thereupon, left Caithness and took up his residence\r\nwith Lord Gordon, who wrote to his friends at Court to obtain a new\r\ncommission against the earl. As the king was daily troubled with\r\ncomplaints against the earl by his creditors, he readily consented\r\nto such a request, and he accordingly wrote a letter to the Lords\r\nof the Privy Council of Scotland, in the month of December 1622,\r\ndesiring them to issue a commission to Lord Gordon to proceed against\r\nthe earl. The execution of the commission was, however, postponed\r\nin consequence of a message to Lord Gordon to attend the Court and\r\nproceed to France on some affairs of state, where he accordingly went\r\nin the year 1623. On the departure of his lordship, the earl made\r\nan application to the Lords of the Council for a new protection,\r\npromising to appear at Edinburgh on the 10th of August of this year,\r\nand to satisfy his creditors. This turned out to be a mere pretence\r\nto obtain delay, for although the council granted the protection,\r\nas required, upon the most urgent solicitations, the earl failed to\r\nappear on the day appointed. This breach of his engagement incensed\r\nhis majesty and the council the more against him, and made them\r\nmore determined than ever to reduce him to obedience. He was again\r\ndenounced and proclaimed rebel, and a new commission was granted to\r\nSir Robert Gordon to proceed against him and his abettors with fire\r\nand sword. In this commission there were conjoined with Sir Robert,\r\nhis brother, Sir Alexander Gordon, Sir Donald Mackay, his nephew,\r\nand James Sinclair of Murkle, but on this condition, that Sir Robert\r\nshould act as chief commissioner, and that nothing should be done by\r\nthe other commissioners in the service they were employed in, without\r\nhis advice and consent.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness seeing now no longer any chance of evading\r\nthe authority of the laws, prepared to meet the gathering storm by\r\nfortifying his castles and strongholds. Proclamations were issued\r\ninterdicting all persons from having any communication with the earl,\r\nand letters of concurrence were given to Sir Robert in name of his\r\nmajesty, charging and commanding the inhabitants of Ross, Sutherland,\r\nStrathnaver, Caithness, and Orkney, to assist him in the execution of\r\nhis majesty’s commission; a ship well furnished with munitions of\r\nwar, was sent to the coast of Caithness to prevent the earl’s escape\r\nby sea, and to furnish Sir Robert with ordnance for battering the\r\nearl’s castles in case he should withstand a siege.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Gordon having arrived in Sutherland in the month of\r\nAugust, 1623, was immediately joined by Lord Berridale for the\r\npurpose of consulting on the plan of operations to be adopted; but,\r\nbefore fixing on any particular plan, it was concerted that Lord\r\nBerridale should first proceed to Caithness to learn what resolution\r\nhis father had come to, and to ascertain how the inhabitants of\r\nthat country stood affected towards the earl. He was also to notify\r\nto Sir Robert the arrival of the ship of war on the coast. A day\r\nwas, at the same time, fixed for the inhabitants of the adjoining\r\ndistricts to meet Sir Robert Gordon in Strathully, upon the borders\r\nbetween Sutherland and Caithness. Lord Berridale was not long in\r\nCaithness when he sent notice to Sir Robert acquainting him that his\r\nfather, the earl, had resolved to stand out to the last extremity,\r\nand that he had fortified the strong castle of Ackergill, which he\r\nhad supplied with men, ammunition, and provisions, and upon holding\r\nout which he placed his last and only hope. He advised Sir Robert to\r\nbring with him into Caithness as many men as he could muster, as many\r\nof the inhabitants stood still well affected to the earl.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Caithness, in the meantime, justly apprehensive of the\r\nconsequences which might ensue if unsuccessful in his opposition,\r\ndespatched a messenger to Sir Robert Gordon, proposing that some\r\ngentlemen should be authorized to negotiate between them, for the\r\npurpose of bringing matters to an amicable accommodation. Sir Robert,\r\nwho perceived the drift of this message, which was solely to obtain\r\ndelay, returned for answer that he was exceedingly sorry that the\r\nearl bad refused the benefit of his last protection for clearing away\r\nthe imputations laid to his charge; and that he clearly perceived\r\nthat the earl’s object in proposing a negotiation was solely to waste\r\ntime, and to weary out the commissioners and army by delays, which\r\nhe, for his own part, would not submit to, because the harvest was\r\nnearly at hand, and the king’s ship could not be detained upon the\r\ncoast idle. Unless, therefore, the earl at once submitted himself\r\nunconditionally to the king’s mercy, Sir Robert threatened to proceed\r\nagainst him and his supporters immediately. The earl had been\r\nhitherto so successful in his different schemes to avoid the ends\r\nof justice that such an answer was by no means expected, and the\r\nfirmness displayed in it served greatly to shake his courage.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the intelligence from Lord Berridale, Sir Robert\r\nGordon made preparations for entering Caithness without delay; and,\r\nas a precautionary measure, he took pledges from such of the tribes\r\nand families in Caithness as he suspected were favourable to the\r\nearl. Before all his forces had time to assemble, Sir Robert received\r\nnotice that the war ship had arrived upon the Caithness coast, and\r\nthat the earl was meditating an escape beyond the seas. Unwilling to\r\nwithdraw men from the adjoining provinces during the harvest season,\r\nand considering the Sutherland forces quite sufficient for his\r\npurpose, he sent couriers into Ross, Strathnaver, Assynt, and Orkney,\r\ndesiring the people who had been engaged to accompany the expedition\r\nto remain at home till farther notice; and, having assembled all\r\nthe inhabitants of Sutherland, he picked out the most active and\r\nresolute men among them, whom he caused to be well supplied with\r\nwar-like weapons, and other necessaries, for the expedition. Having\r\nthus equipped his army, Sir Robert, accompanied by his brother,\r\nSir Alexander Gordon, and the principal gentlemen of Sutherland,\r\nmarched, on the 3d of September, 1623, from Dunrobin to Killiernan\r\nin Strathully, the place of rendezvous previously appointed. Here\r\nSir Robert divided his forces into companies, over each of which\r\nhe placed a commander. The following morning he passed the river\r\nHelmsdale, and arranged his army in the following order:--Half-a-mile\r\nin advance of the main body he placed a company of the clan Gun,\r\nwhose duty it was to search the fields as they advanced for the\r\npurpose of discovering any ambuscades which might be laid in their\r\nway, and to clear away any obstruction to the regular advance of the\r\nmain body. The right wing of the army was led by John Murray of\r\nAberscors, Hugh Gordon of Ballellon, and Adam Gordon of Kilcalmkill.\r\nThe left wing was commanded by John Gordon, younger of Embo, Robert\r\nGray of Ospisdale, and Alexander Sutherland of Kilphidder. And Sir\r\nRobert Gordon himself, his brother Sir Alexander, the laird of\r\nPulrossie, and William Mac-Mhic-Sheumais of Killiernan, led the\r\ncentre. The two wings were always kept a short distance in advance of\r\nthe centre, from which they were to receive support when required. In\r\nthis manner the army advanced towards Berridale, and they observed\r\nthe same order of marching during all the time they remained in\r\nCaithness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lord Berridale heard of Sir Robert Gordon’s advance, he\r\nand James Sinclair of Murkle, one of the commissioners, and some\r\nother gentlemen, went forward in haste to meet him. The parties\r\naccordingly met among the mountains above Cayen, about three miles\r\nfrom Berridale. Sir Robert continued his march till he arrived at\r\nBrea-Na-Henglish in Berridale, where at night he encamped. Here they\r\nwere informed that the ship of war, after casting anchor before\r\nCastle Sinclair, had gone from thence to Scrabster road, and that\r\nthe Earl of Caithness had abandoned the country, and sailed by night\r\ninto one of the Orkney Islands, with the intention of going thence\r\ninto Norway or Denmark. From Brea-Na-Henglish the army advanced to\r\nLathron, where they encamped. Here James Sinclair of Murkle, sheriff\r\nof Caithness, Sir William Sinclair of May, the laird of Ratter, the\r\nlaird of Forse, and several other gentlemen of Caithness, waited\r\nupon Sir Robert Gordon and tendered their submission and obedience\r\nto his majesty, offering, at the same time, every assistance they\r\ncould afford in forwarding the objects of the expedition. Sir Robert\r\nreceived them kindly, and promised to acquaint his majesty with their\r\nsubmission; but he distrusted some of them, and he gave orders that\r\nnone of the Caithness people should be allowed to enter his camp\r\nafter sunset. At Lathron, Sir Robert was joined by about 300 of the\r\nCaithness men, consisting of the Cadels and others who had favoured\r\nLord Berridale. These men were commanded by James Sinclair, fiar of\r\nMurkle, and were kept always a mile or two in advance of the army\r\ntill they reached Castle Sinclair.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Sir Robert arrive before Castle Sinclair, which was\r\na very strong place, and the principal residence of the Earl of\r\nCaithness, than it surrendered, the keys being delivered up to him\r\nas representing his majesty. The army encamped before the castle two\r\nnights, during which time the officers took up their quarters within\r\nthe castle, which was guarded by Sutherland men.\r\n\r\nFrom Castle Sinclair Sir Robert marched to the castle of Ackergill,\r\nanother strong place, which also surrendered on the first summons,\r\nand the keys of which were delivered in like manner to him. The\r\narmy next marched in battle array to the castle of Kease, the last\r\nresidence of the earl, which was also given up without resistance.\r\nThe Countess of Caithness had previously removed to another residence\r\nnot far distant, where she was visited by Sir Robert Gordon, who\r\nwas her cousin-german. The countess entreated him, with great\r\nearnestness, to get her husband again restored to favour, seeing he\r\nhad made no resistance to him. Sir Robert promised to do what he\r\ncould if the earl would follow his advice; but he did not expect that\r\nmatters could be accommodated so speedily as she expected, from the\r\npeculiar situation in which the earl then stood.\r\n\r\nFrom Kease Sir Robert Gordon returned with his army to Castle\r\nSinclair, where, according to the directions he had received from the\r\nPrivy Council, he delivered the keys of all these castles and forts\r\nto Lord Berridale, to be kept by him for his majesty’s use, for which\r\nhe should be answerable to the lords of the council until the farther\r\npleasure of his majesty should be known.\r\n\r\nThe army then returned to Wick in the same marching order which\r\nhad been observed since its first entry into Caithness, at which\r\nplace the commissioners consulted together, and framed a set of\r\ninstructions to Lord Berridale for governing Caithness peaceably\r\nin time coming, conformably to the laws of the kingdom, and for\r\npreventing the Earl of Caithness from again disturbing the country,\r\nshould he venture to return after the departure of the army. At Wick\r\nSir Robert Gordon was joined by Sir Donald Mackay, who had collected\r\ntogether the choicest men of Strathnaver; but, as the object of the\r\nexpedition had been accomplished, Sir Donald, after receiving Sir\r\nRobert’s thanks, returned to Strathnaver. Sir Robert having brought\r\nthis expedition to a successful termination, led back his men into\r\nSutherland, and, after a stay of three months, went to England,\r\ncarrying with him a letter from the Privy Council of Scotland to\r\nthe king, giving an account of the expedition, and of its happy\r\nresults.[210]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205] Act James VI., Parl. 3, Cap. 45.\r\n\r\n[206] Sir R.

Charles I., 1625-1649.\r\n\r\n  Insurrection of the clan Chattan against the Earl of Murray\r\n  --Dispute between the laird of Duffus and Gordon, younger of\r\n  Embo--Sir Donald Mackay’s machinations--Feud among the Grants\r\n  --Dispute between the lairds of Frendraught and Rothiemay--Quarrel\r\n  between Frendraught and the laird of Pitcaple--Calamitous and\r\n  fatal fire at Frendraught House--Inquiry as to the cause of the\r\n  fire--Escape of James Grant--Apprehension of Grant of Ballindalloch\r\n  --And of Thomas Grant--Dispute between the Earl of Sutherland and\r\n  Lord Lorn--Depredations committed upon Frendraught--Marquis of\r\n  Huntly accused therewith--The Marquis and Letterfourie committed\r\n  --Liberated--Death and character of the Marquis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troubles in Sutherland and Caithness had been scarcely allayed,\r\nwhen a formidable insurrection broke out on the part of the clan\r\nChattan against the Earl of Murray, which occasioned considerable\r\nuproar and confusion in the Highlands. The clan Chattan had for a\r\nvery long period been the faithful friends and followers of the Earls\r\nof Murray, who, on that account, had allotted them many valuable\r\nlands in recompense for their services in Pettie and Strathearn.\r\nThe clan had, in particular, been very active in revenging upon the\r\nMarquis of Huntly the death of James, Earl of Murray, who was killed\r\nat Donnibristle; but his son and successor being reconciled to the\r\nfamily of Huntly, and needing no longer, as he thought, the aid of\r\nthe clan, dispossessed them of the lands which his predecessors\r\nhad bestowed upon them. This harsh proceeding occasioned great\r\nirritation, and, upon the death of Sir Lauchlan their chief, who\r\ndied a short time before Whitsunday, 1624, they resolved either to\r\nrecover the possessions of which they had been deprived, or to lay\r\nthem waste. While Sir Lauchlan lived, the clan were awed by his\r\nauthority and prevented from such an attempt, but no such impediment\r\nnow standing in their way, and as their chief, who was a mere child,\r\ncould run no risk by the enterprise, they considered the present a\r\nfavourable opportunity for carrying their plan into execution.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a gathering of the clan, to the number of about 200\r\ngentlemen and 300 servants, took place about Whitsunday, 1624. This\r\nparty was commanded by three uncles of the late chief.[211] “They\r\nkeeped the feilds,” says Spalding, “in their Highland weid upon foot\r\nwith swords, bowes, arrowes, targets, hagbuttis, pistollis, and other\r\nHighland armour; and first began to rob and spoulzie the earle’s\r\ntennents, who laboured their possessions, of their haill goods, geir,\r\ninsight, plenishing, horse, nolt, sheep, corns, and cattell, and left\r\nthem nothing that they could gett within their bounds; syne fell in\r\nsorning throw out Murray, Strathawick, Urquhart, Ross, Sutherland,\r\nBrae of Marr, and diverse other parts, takeing their meat and food\r\nper force wher they could not gett it willingly, frae freinds\r\nalseweill as frae their faes; yet still keeped themselves from\r\nshedeing of innocent blood. Thus they lived as outlawes, oppressing\r\nthe countrie, (besydes the casting of the earle’s lands waist), and\r\nopenly avowed they had tane this course to gett thir own possessions\r\nagain, or then hold the country walking.”\r\n\r\nWhen this rising took place, the Earl of Murray obtained from\r\nMonteith and Balquhidder about 300 armed men, and placing himself\r\nat their head he marched through Moray to Inverness. The earl\r\ntook up his residence in the castle with the Earl of Enzie, his\r\nbrother-in-law, eldest son of the Marquis of Huntly, and after the\r\nparty had passed one night at Inverness, he despatched them in quest\r\nof the clan Chattan, but whether from fear of meeting them, or\r\nbecause they could not find them, certain it is that the Monteith and\r\nBalquhidder men returned without effecting anything, after putting\r\nthe earl to great expense. The earl, therefore, sent them back to\r\ntheir respective countries, and went himself to Elgin, where he\r\nraised another body of men to suppress the clan Chattan, who were\r\nequally unsuccessful in finding the latter out.\r\n\r\nThese ineffectual attempts against the clan served to make them more\r\nbold and daring in their outrages; and as the earl now saw that no\r\nforce which he could himself bring into the field was sufficient to\r\noverawe these marauders, King James, at his earnest solicitation,\r\ngranted him a commission, appointing him his lieutenant in the\r\nHighlands, and giving him authority to proceed capitally against\r\nthe offenders. On his return the earl proclaimed the commission he\r\nhad obtained from his majesty, and issued letters of intercommuning\r\nagainst the clan Chattan, prohibiting all persons from harbouring,\r\nsupplying, or entertaining them, in any manner of way, under certain\r\nsevere pains and penalties. Although the Marquis of Huntly was the\r\nearl’s father-in-law, he felt somewhat indignant at the appointment,\r\nas he conceived that he or his son had the best title to be appointed\r\nto the lieutenancy of the north; but he concealed his displeasure.\r\n\r\nAfter the Earl of Murray had issued the notices, prohibiting all\r\npersons from communicating with, or assisting the clan Chattan, their\r\nkindred and friends, who had privately promised them aid, before\r\nthey broke out, began to grow cold, and declined to assist them, as\r\nthey were apprehensive of losing their estates, many of them being\r\nwealthy. The earl perceiving this, opened a communication with some\r\nof the principal persons of the clan, to induce them to submit to his\r\nauthority, who, seeing no hopes of making any longer an effectual\r\nresistance, readily acquiesced, and, by the intercession of friends,\r\nmade their peace with the earl, on condition that they should inform\r\nhim of the names of such persons as had given them protection, after\r\nthe publication of his letters of interdiction. Having thus quelled\r\nthis formidable insurrection without bloodshed, the earl, by virtue\r\nof his commission, held justice courts at Elgin, where “some slight\r\nlouns, followers of the clan Chattan,” were tried and executed, but\r\nall the principals concerned were pardoned.\r\n\r\nAs the account which Spalding gives of the appearance of the accused,\r\nand of the base conduct of the principal men of the clan Chattan,\r\nin informing against their friends and benefactors, is both curious\r\nand graphic, it is here inserted: “Then presently was brought in\r\nbefor the barr; and in the honest men’s faces, the clan Chattan who\r\nhad gotten supply, verified what they had gotten, and the honest\r\nmen confounded and dasht, knew not what to answer, was forced to\r\ncome in the earle’s will, whilk was not for their weill: others\r\ncompeared and willingly confessed, trusting to gett more favour at\r\nthe earle’s hands, but they came little speid: and lastly, some stood\r\nout and denyed all, who was reserved to the triall of an assyse. The\r\nprincipall malefactors stood up in judgment, and declared what they\r\nhad gotten, whether meat, money, cloathing, gun, ball, powder, lead,\r\nsword, dirk, and the like commodities, and alse instructed the assyse\r\nin ilk particular, what they had gotten frae the persons pannalled;\r\nan uncouth form of probation, wher the principall malefactor proves\r\nagainst the receiptor for his own pardon, and honest men, perhaps\r\nneither of the clan Chattan’s kyne nor blood, punished for their good\r\nwill, ignorant of the laws, and rather receipting them more for their\r\nevil nor their good. Nevertheless thir innocent men, under collour of\r\njustice, part and part as they came in, were soundly fyned in great\r\nsoumes as their estates might bear, and some above their estate was\r\nfyned, and every one warded within the tolbuith of Elgine, while the\r\nleast myte was payed of such as was persued in anno 1624.”[212]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the unequal administration of the laws at this time may\r\nbe formed, when it is considered that the enormous fines imposed in\r\nthe present instance, went into the pockets of the chief judge, the\r\nEarl of Murray himself, as similar mulcts had previously gone into\r\nthose of the Earl of Argyle, in his crusade against the unfortunate\r\nclan Gregor! This legal robbery, however, does not appear to have\r\nenriched the houses of Argyle and Murray, for Sir Robert Gordon\r\nobserves, that “these fynes did not much advantage either of these\r\ntwo earles.” The Earl of Murray, no doubt, thinking such a mode\r\nof raising money an easy and profitable speculation, afterwards\r\nobtained an enlargement of his commission from Charles I., not only\r\nagainst the clan Chattan, but also against all other offenders\r\nwithin several adjacent shires; but the commission was afterwards\r\nannulled by his majesty, not so much on account of the abuses and\r\ninjustice which might have been perpetrated under it, but because,\r\nas Sir Robert Gordon observes, “it grieved divers of his majesty’s\r\nbest affected subjects, and chieflie the Marquis of Huntlie, unto\r\nwhose predicessors onlie the office of livetennendrie in the north of\r\nScotland had bein granted by former kings, for these many ages.”\r\n\r\nThere seems reason, however, for supposing that the recall of the\r\ncommission was hastened by complaints to the king, on the part of\r\nthe oppressed; for the earl had no sooner obtained its renewal,\r\nthan he held a court against the burgh of Inverness, John Grant\r\nof Glenmoriston, and others who had refused to acknowledge their\r\nconnexion with the clan Chattan, or to pay him the heavy fines\r\nwhich he had imposed upon them. The town of Inverness endeavoured\r\nto get quit of the earl’s extortions, on the ground that the\r\ninhabitants were innocent of the crimes laid to their charge; but\r\nthe earl frustrated their application to the Privy Council. The\r\nprovost, Duncan Forbes,[213] was then sent to the king, and Grant of\r\nGlenmoriston took a journey to London, at the same time, on his own\r\naccount; but their endeavours proved ineffectual, and they had no\r\nalternative but to submit to the earl’s exactions.[214]\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between the laird of Duffus and John Gordon, younger of\r\nEmbo, which had lain dormant for some time, burst forth again, in the\r\nyear 1625, and proved nearly fatal to both parties. Gordon had long\r\nwatched an opportunity to revenge the wrong which he conceived had\r\nbeen done him by the laird of Duffus and his brother, James, but he\r\ncould never fall in with either of them, as they remained in Moray,\r\nand, when they appeared in Sutherland, they were always accompanied\r\nby some friends, so that Gordon was prevented from attacking them.\r\nFrequent disappointments in this way only whetted his appetite for\r\nrevenge; and meeting, when on horseback, one day, between Sidderay\r\nand Skibo, with John Sutherland of Clyne, third brother of the laird\r\nof Duffus, who was also on horseback, he determined to make the laird\r\nof Clyne suffer for the delinquencies of his elder brother. Raising,\r\ntherefore, a cudgel which he held in his hand, he inflicted several\r\nblows upon John Sutherland, who, as soon as he recovered himself\r\nfrom the surprise and confusion into which such an unexpected attack\r\nhad thrown him, drew his sword. Gordon, in his turn, unsheathed\r\nhis, and a warm combat ensued, between the parties and two friends\r\nwho accompanied them. After they had fought a while, Gordon wounded\r\nSutherland in the head and in one of his hands, and otherwise injured\r\nhim, but he spared his life, although completely in his power.\r\n\r\nDuffus immediately cited John Gordon to appear before the Privy\r\nCouncil, to answer for this breach of the peace, and, at the same\r\ntime, summoned before the council some of the Earl of Sutherland’s\r\nfriends and dependants, for an alleged conspiracy against himself\r\nand his friends. Duffus, with his two brothers and Gordon, came to\r\nEdinburgh on the day appointed, and, the parties being heard, Gordon\r\nwas declared guilty of a riot, and was thereupon committed to prison.\r\nThis result gave great satisfaction to Duffus and his brothers, who\r\nnow calculated on nothing less than the utter ruin of Gordon; as they\r\nhad, by means of Sir Donald Mackay, obtained a Strathnaver man, named\r\nWilliam Mack-Allen (one of the Siol-Thomais), who had been a servant\r\nof Gordon’s, to become a witness against him, and to prove every\r\nthing that Duffus was pleased to allege against Gordon.\r\n\r\nIn this state of matters, Sir Robert Gordon returned from London to\r\nEdinburgh, where he found Duffus in high spirits, exulting at his\r\nsuccess, and young Embo in prison. Sir Robert applied to Duffus,\r\nhoping to bring about a reconciliation by the intervention of\r\nfriends, but Duffus refused to hear of any arrangement; and the more\r\nreasonable the conditions were, which Sir Robert proposed, the more\r\nunreasonable and obstinate did he become; his object being to get\r\nthe lords to award him great sums of money at the expense of Gordon,\r\nin satisfaction for the wrong done his brother. Sir Robert, however,\r\nfinally succeeded, by the assistance of the Earl of Enzie, who was\r\nthen at Edinburgh, in getting the prosecution against the Earl of\r\nSutherland’s friends quashed, in obtaining the liberation of John\r\nGordon, and in getting his fine mitigated to one hundred pounds\r\nScots, payable to the king only; reserving, however, civil action\r\nto John Sutherland of Clyne against Gordon, before the Lords of\r\nSession.[215]\r\n\r\nSir Donald Mackay, always restless, and desirous of gratifying his\r\nenmity at the house of Sutherland, endeavoured to embroil it with the\r\nlaird of Duffus in the following way. Having formed a resolution to\r\nleave the kingdom, Sir Donald applied for, and obtained, a license\r\nfrom the king to raise a regiment in the north, to assist Count\r\nMansfield in his campaign in Germany. He, accordingly, collected, in\r\na few months, about 3,000 men from different parts of Scotland, the\r\ngreater part of whom he embarked at Cromarty in the month of October\r\n1626; but, on account of bad health, he was obliged to delay his own\r\ndeparture till the following year, when he joined the king of Sweden\r\nwith his regiment, in consequence of a peace having been concluded\r\nbetween the King of Denmark and the Emperor of Germany.[216] Among\r\nothers whom Mackay had engaged to accompany him to Germany, was a\r\nperson named Angus Roy Gun, against whom, a short time previous to\r\nhis enlistment, Mackay and his brother, John Mackay of Dirlet, had\r\nobtained a commission from the lords of the Privy Council for the\r\npurpose of apprehending him and bringing him before the council for\r\nsome supposed crimes. Mackay could have easily apprehended Angus Roy\r\nGun on different occasions, but having become one of his regiment, he\r\nallowed the commission, as far as he was concerned, to remain a dead\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nSometime after his enlistment, Angus Roy Gun made a journey into\r\nSutherland, a circumstance which afforded Mackay an opportunity of\r\nputting into execution the scheme he had formed, and which showed\r\nthat he was no mean adept in the arts of cunning and dissimulation.\r\nHis plan was this:--He wrote, in the first place, private letters to\r\nthe laird of Duffus, and to his brother, John Sutherland of Clyne,\r\nto apprehend Angus Roy Gun under the commission he had obtained; and\r\nat the same time, sent the commission itself to the laird of Duffus\r\nas his authority for so doing. He next wrote a letter to Alexander\r\nGordon, the Earl of Sutherland’s uncle, who, in the absence of his\r\nbrother, Sir Robert, governed Sutherland, entreating him, as Angus\r\nRoy Gun was then in Sutherland, to send him to him to Cromarty, as\r\nhe was his hired soldier. Ignorant of Mackay’s design, and desirous\r\nof serving him, Sir Alexander sent two of his men to bring Gun to\r\nSir Alexander; but on their return they were met by John Sutherland\r\nof Clyne and a party of sixteen men, who seized Gun; and to prevent\r\na rescue, the laird of Duffus sent his brother, James Sutherland,\r\nAlexander Murray, heir-apparent of Aberscors, and William Neill-son,\r\nchief of the Sliochd-Iain-Abaraich, with 300 men to protect his\r\nbrother John. At the same time, as he anticipated an attack from\r\nSir Alexander Gordon, he sent messengers to his supporters in Ross,\r\nStrathnaver, Caithness, and other places for assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Alexander Gordon heard of the assembling of such a body\r\nof the Earl of Sutherland’s vassals without his knowledge, he made\r\ninquiry to ascertain the cause; and being informed of Gun’s capture,\r\nhe collected 18 men who were near at hand, and hastened with them\r\nfrom Dunrobin towards Clyne. On arriving at the bridge of Broray,\r\nhe found James Sutherland, with his brother John, and their whole\r\nparty drawn up in battle array at the east end of the bridge. He,\r\nthereupon, sent a person to the Sutherlands to know the cause of\r\nsuch an assemblage, and the reason why they had taken Gun from his\r\nservants. As the Sutherlands refused to exhibit their authority, Sir\r\nAlexander made demonstrations for passing the bridge, but he was\r\nmet by a shower of shot and arrows which wounded two of his men.\r\nAfter exchanging shots for some time, Sir Alexander was joined by a\r\nconsiderable body of his countrymen, by whose aid, notwithstanding\r\nthe resistance he met with, he was enabled to cross the bridge. The\r\nSutherlands were forced to retreat, and as they saw no chance of\r\nopposing, with success, the power of the house of Sutherland, they,\r\nafter some hours’ consultation, delivered up Angus Roy Gun to Sir\r\nAlexander Sutherland, who sent him immediately to Mackay, then at\r\nCromarty.\r\n\r\nAs such an example of insubordination among the Earl of Sutherland’s\r\nvassals might, if overlooked, lead others to follow a similar course,\r\nSir Alexander caused the laird of Duffus and his brother of Clyne,\r\nwith their accomplices, to be cited to appear at Edinburgh on the\r\n16th of November following, to answer before the Privy Council for\r\ntheir misdemeanours. The laird of Duffus, however, died in the month\r\nof October, but the laird of Clyne appeared at Edinburgh at the time\r\nappointed, and produced before the Privy Council the letter he had\r\nreceived from Mackay, as his authority for acting as he had done. Sir\r\nAlexander Gordon also produced the letter sent to him by Sir Donald,\r\nwho was thereby convicted of having been the intentional originator\r\nof the difference; but as the lords of council thought that the laird\r\nof Clyne had exceeded the bounds of his commission, he was imprisoned\r\nin the jail of Edinburgh, wherein he was ordered to remain until he\r\nshould give satisfaction to the other party, and present some of\r\nhis men who had failed to appear though summoned. By the mediation,\r\nhowever, of James Sutherland, tutor of Duffus, a reconciliation was\r\neffected between Sir Robert and Sir Alexander Gordon, and the laird\r\nof Clyne, who was, in consequence, soon thereafter liberated from\r\nprison.[217]\r\n\r\nThe year 1628 was marked by the breaking out of an old and deadly\r\nfeud among the Grants, which had been transmitted from father to son\r\nfor several generations, in consequence of the murder of John Grant\r\nof Ballindalloch, about the middle of the sixteenth century, by John\r\nRoy Grant of Carron, the natural son of John Grant of Glenmoriston,\r\nat the instigation of the laird of Grant, the chief of the tribe,\r\nwho had conceived a grudge against his kinsman. Some years before\r\nthe period first mentioned, James Grant, one of the Carron family,\r\nhappening to be at a fair in the town of Elgin, observed one of the\r\nGrants of the Ballindalloch family eagerly pursuing his (James’s)\r\nbrother, Thomas Grant, whom he knocked down in the street and wounded\r\nopenly before his eyes. The assailant was in his turn attacked by\r\nJames Grant, who killed him upon the spot and immediately decamped.\r\nBallindalloch then cited James Grant to stand trial for the slaughter\r\nof his kinsman, but, as he did not appear on the day appointed, he\r\nwas outlawed. The laird of Grant made many attempts to reconcile the\r\nparties, but in vain, as Ballindalloch was obstinate and would listen\r\nto no proposals. Nothing less than the blood of James Grant would\r\nsatisfy Ballindalloch.\r\n\r\nThis resolution on the part of Ballindalloch almost drove James\r\nGrant to despair, and seeing his life every moment in jeopardy, and\r\ndeprived of any hope of effecting a compromise, he put himself at\r\nthe head of a party of brigands, whom he collected from all parts\r\nof the Highlands. These freebooters made no distinction between\r\nfriends and foes, but attacked all persons of whatever description,\r\nand wasted and despoiled their property. James Grant of Dalnebo,\r\none of the family of Ballindalloch, fell a victim to their fury,\r\nand many of the kinsmen of that family suffered greatly from the\r\ndepredations committed by Grant and his associates. The Earl of\r\nMurray, under the renewed and extended commission which he had\r\nobtained from King Charles, made various attempts to put an end to\r\nthese lawless proceedings, but to no purpose; the failure of these\r\nattempts serving only to harden James Grant and his party, who\r\ncontinued their depredations. As John Grant of Carron, nephew of\r\nJames Grant, was supposed to maintain and assist his uncle secretly,\r\na suspicion for which there seems to have been no foundation, John\r\nGrant of Ballindalloch sought for an opportunity of revenging himself\r\nupon Carron, who was a promising young man. Carron having one day\r\nleft his house, along with one Alexander Grant and seven or eight\r\nother persons, to cut down some timber in the woods of Abernethy,\r\nBallindalloch thought the occasion favourable for putting his design\r\ninto execution. Having collected and armed sixteen of his friends,\r\nhe went to the forest where Carron was, and under the pretence of\r\nsearching for James Grant and some of his associates, against whom he\r\nhad a commission, attacked Carron, who fought manfully in defence of\r\nhis life, but being overpowered, was killed by Ballindalloch. Before\r\nCarron fell, however, he and Alexander Grant had slain several of\r\nBallindalloch’s friends, among whom were Thomas Grant of Davey, and\r\nLauchlan Macintosh of Rockinoyr. Alexander Grant afterwards annoyed\r\nBallindalloch, killing several of his men, and assisted James Grant\r\nto lay waste Ballindalloch’s lands. “Give me leave heir,” says Sir\r\nR. Gordon, “to remark the providence and secrait judgement of the\r\nAlmightie God, who now hath mett Carron with the same measure that\r\nhis forefather, John Roy Grant of Carron, did serve the ancestor\r\nof Ballendallogh; for upon the same day of the moneth that John\r\nRoy Grant did kill the great-grandfather of Ballendallogh (being\r\nthe eleventh day of September), the verie same day of this month\r\nwes Carron slain by this John Grant of Ballendallogh many yeirs\r\nthereafter. And, besides, as that John Roy Grant of Carron was\r\nleft-handed, so is this John Grant of Ballendallogh left-handed\r\nalso; and moreover, it is to be observed that Ballendallogh, at the\r\nkilling of this Carron, had upon him the same coat-of-armour, or\r\nmaillie-coat, which John Roy Grant had upon him at the slaughter\r\nof the great-grandfather of this Ballendallogh, which maillie-coat\r\nBallendallogh had, a little before this tyme, taken from James\r\nGrant, in a skirmish, that passed betwixt them. Thus wee doe sie that\r\nthe judgements of God are inscrutable, and that, in his own tyme, he\r\npunisheth blood by blood.”[218]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Murray, when he heard of this occurrence, instead of\r\ntaking measures against Ballindalloch for his outrage against the\r\nlaws, which he was fully entitled to do by virtue of the commission\r\nhe held, took part with Ballindalloch against the friends of Carron.\r\nHe not only represented Ballindalloch’s case favourably at court, but\r\nalso obtained an indemnity for him for some years, that he might not\r\nbe molested. The countenance thus given by his majesty’s lieutenant\r\nto the murderer of their kinsmen, exasperated James and Alexander\r\nGrant in the highest degree against Ballindalloch and his supporters,\r\nwhom they continually annoyed with their incursions, laying waste\r\ntheir lands and possessions, and cutting off their people. To such an\r\nextent was this system of lawless warfare carried, that Ballindalloch\r\nwas forced to flee from the north of Scotland, and live for the most\r\npart in Edinburgh, to avoid the dangers with which he was surrounded.\r\nBut James Grant’s desperate career was checked by a party of the clan\r\nChattan, who unexpectedly attacked him at Auchnachyle, in Strathdoun,\r\nunder cloud of night, in the latter end of December, 1630, when he\r\nwas taken prisoner after receiving eleven wounds, and after four\r\nof his party were killed. He was sent by his captors to Edinburgh\r\nfor trial before the lords of the council, and was imprisoned in\r\nthe castle of Edinburgh, from which he escaped in the manner to be\r\nafterwards noticed.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that James Grant was desolating the district of the\r\nHighlands, to which his operations were confined, another part of the\r\ncountry was convulsed by a dispute, ending tragically, which occurred\r\nbetween James Crichton of Frendret, or Frendraught, and William\r\nGordon of Rothiemay, whose lands lay adjacent to each other. Part of\r\nGordon’s lands which marched with those of Crichton were purchased\r\nby the latter; but a dispute having occurred about the right to\r\nthe salmon fishings belonging to these lands, an irreconcilable\r\ndifference arose between them, which no mediation of friends could\r\nreconcile, although the matter in dispute was of little moment. The\r\nparties having had recourse to the law to settle their respective\r\nclaims, Crichton prevailed, and succeeded in getting Gordon denounced\r\nrebel. He had previously treated Rothiemay very harshly, who, stung\r\nby the severity of his opponent, and by the victory he had obtained\r\nover him, would listen to no proposals of peace, nor follow the\r\nadvice of his best friends. Determined to set the law at defiance,\r\nhe collected a number of loose and disorderly characters, and\r\nannoyed Frendraught, who, in consequence, applied for and obtained\r\na commission from the Privy Council for apprehending Rothiemay and\r\nhis associates. In the execution of this task he was assisted by\r\nSir George Ogilvy of Banff, George Gordon, brother-german of Sir\r\nJames Gordon of Lesmoir, and the uncle of Frendraught, James Leslie,\r\nsecond son of Leslie of Pitcaple, John Meldrum of Reidhill, and\r\nothers. Accompanied by these gentlemen, Crichton left his house of\r\nFrendraught on the 1st of January, 1630, for the house of Rothiemay,\r\nwith a resolution either to apprehend Gordon, his antagonist, or\r\nto set him at defiance by affronting him. He was incited the more\r\nto follow this course, as young Rothiemay, at the head of a party,\r\nhad come a short time before to the very doors of Frendraught, and\r\nhad braved him to his face. When Rothiemay heard of the advance\r\nof Frendraught, he left his house, accompanied by his eldest son,\r\nJohn Gordon, and about eight men on horseback armed with guns and\r\nlances, and a party of men on foot with muskets, and crossing the\r\nriver Deveron, went forward to meet Frendraught and his party. A\r\nsharp conflict immediately took place, in which Rothiemay’s horse\r\nwas killed under him; but he fought manfully for some time on foot,\r\nuntil the whole of his party, with the exception of his son, were\r\nforced to retire. The son, notwithstanding, continued to support his\r\nfather against fearful odds, but was at last obliged to save himself\r\nby flight, leaving his father lying on the field covered with wounds,\r\nand supposed to be dead. He, however, was found still alive after the\r\nconflict was over, and being carried home to his house, died within\r\nthree days thereafter. George Gordon, brother of Gordon of Lesmoir,\r\nreceived a shot in the thigh, and died in consequence ten days after\r\nthe skirmish. These were the only deaths which occurred, although\r\nseveral of the combatants on both sides were wounded. John Meldrum,\r\nwho fought on Frendraught’s side, was the only person severely\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly was highly displeased at Frendraught for\r\nhaving, in such a trifling matter, proceeded to extremities against\r\nhis kinsman, a chief baron of his surname, whose life had been thus\r\nsacrificed in a petty quarrel. The displeasure of the marquis was\r\nstill farther heightened, when he was informed that Frendraught\r\nhad joined the Earl of Murray, and had claimed his protection and\r\nassistance; but the marquis was obliged to repress his indignation.\r\nJohn Gordon of Rothiemay, eldest son of the deceased laird, resolved\r\nto avenge the death of his father, and having collected a party of\r\nmen, he associated himself with James Grant and other freebooters,\r\nfor the purpose of laying waste Frendraught’s lands, and oppressing\r\nhim in every possible way. Frendraught, who was in the south of\r\nScotland when this combination against him was formed, no sooner\r\nheard of it than he posted to England, and, having laid a statement\r\nof the case before the king, his majesty remitted the matter to the\r\nPrivy Council of Scotland, desiring them to use their best endeavours\r\nfor settling the peace of the northern parts of the kingdom. A\r\ncommission was thereupon granted by the lords of the council to\r\nFrendraught and others, for the purpose of apprehending John Gordon\r\nand his associates; but, as the commissioners were not able to\r\nexecute the task imposed upon them, the lords of the council sent\r\nSir Robert Gordon, tutor of Sutherland, who had just returned from\r\nEngland, and Sir William Seaton of Killesmuir, to the north, with\r\na new commission against the rebels. As it seemed to be entirely\r\nout of the power of the Earl of Murray to quell the disturbances in\r\nthe north, the two commissioners received particular instructions\r\nto attempt, with the aid of the Marquis of Huntly, to get matters\r\nsettled amicably, and the opposing parties reconciled. The lords\r\nof the council, at the same time, wrote a letter to the Marquis of\r\nHuntly to the same effect. Sir Robert Gordon and Sir William Seaton\r\naccordingly left Edinburgh, on their way north, in the beginning\r\nof May, 1630. The latter stopped at Aberdeen for the purpose of\r\nconsulting with some gentlemen of that county, as to the best mode of\r\nproceeding against the rebels; and the former went to Strathbogie to\r\nadvise with the Marquis of Huntly.\r\n\r\nOn Sir Robert’s arrival at Strathbogie, he found that the marquis had\r\ngone to Aberdeen to attend the funeral of the laird of Drum. By a\r\nsingular coincidence, James Grant and Alexander Grant descended the\r\nvery day of Sir Robert’s arrival from the mountains, at the head of a\r\nparty of 200 Highlanders, well armed, with a resolution to burn and\r\nlay waste Frendraught’s lands. As soon as Sir Robert became aware of\r\nthis circumstance, he went in great haste to Rothiemay house, where\r\nhe found John Gordon and his associates in arms, ready to set out to\r\njoin the Grants. By persuasion and entreaties Sir Robert, assisted\r\nby his nephew the Earl of Sutherland, and his brother, Sir Alexander\r\nGordon, who were then at Frendraught on a visit to the lady of that\r\nplace, who was a sister of the earl, prevailed not only upon John\r\nGordon and his friends to desist, but also upon James Grant and his\r\ncompanions-in-arms, to disperse.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Marquis of Huntly to Strathbogie, Rothiemay\r\nand Frendraught were both induced to meet them in presence of the\r\nmarquis, Sir Robert Gordon, and Sir William Seaton, who, after much\r\nentreaty, prevailed upon them to reconcile their differences, and\r\nsubmit all matters in dispute to their arbitrament. A decree-arbitral\r\nwas accordingly pronounced, by which the arbiters adjudged that the\r\nlaird of Rothiemay and the children of George Gordon should mutually\r\nremit their father’s slaughter, and, in satisfaction thereof, they\r\ndecerned that the laird of Frendraught should pay a certain sum of\r\nmoney to the laird of Rothiemay, for relief of the debts which he had\r\ncontracted during the disturbances between the two families,[219]\r\nand that he should pay some money to the children of George Gordon.\r\nFrendraught fulfilled these conditions most willingly, and the\r\nparties shook hands together in the orchard of Strathbogie, in token\r\nof a hearty and sincere reconciliation.[220]\r\n\r\nThe laird of Frendraught had scarcely been reconciled to Rothiemay,\r\nwhen he got into another dispute with the laird of Pitcaple, the\r\noccasion of which was as follows:--John Meldrum of Reidhill had\r\nassisted Frendraught in his quarrel with old Rothiemay, and had\r\nreceived a wound in the skirmish in which the latter lost his life,\r\nfor which injury Frendraught had allowed him some compensation; but,\r\nconceiving that his services had not been fairly requited, he began\r\nto abuse Frendraught, and threatened to compel him to give him a\r\ngreater recompense than he had yet received. As Frendraught refused\r\nto comply with his demands, Meldrum entered the park of Frendraught\r\nprivately in the night-time, and carried away two horses belonging\r\nto his pretended debtor. Frendraught thereupon prosecuted Meldrum\r\nfor theft, but he declined to appear in court, and was consequently\r\ndeclared rebel. Frendraught then obtained a commission from the Privy\r\nCouncil to apprehend Meldrum, who took refuge with John Leslie of\r\nPitcaple, whose sister he had married. Under the commission which\r\nhe had procured, Frendraught went in quest of Meldrum, on the 27th\r\nof September, 1630. He proceeded to Pitcaple’s lands, on which he\r\nknew Meldrum then lived, where he met James Leslie, second son of\r\nthe laird of Pitcaple, who had been with him at the skirmish of\r\nRothiemay. Leslie then began to expostulate with him in behalf of\r\nMeldrum, his brother-in-law, who, on account of the aid he had given\r\nhim in his dispute with Rothiemay, took Leslie’s remonstrances\r\nin good part; but Robert Crichton of Conland,[221] a kinsman of\r\nFrendraught, grew so warm at Leslie’s freedom that from high words\r\nthey proceeded to blows. Conland, then, drawing a pistol from his\r\nbelt, wounded Leslie in the arm, who was thereupon carried home,\r\napparently in a dying state.\r\n\r\nThis affair was the signal for a confederacy among the Leslies,\r\nthe greater part of whom took up arms against Frendraught, who,\r\na few days after the occurrence, viz., on the 5th of October,\r\nfirst went to the Marquis of Huntly, and afterwards to the Earl of\r\nMurray, to express the regret he felt at what had taken place, and\r\nto beg their kindly interference to bring matters to an amicable\r\naccommodation. The Earl of Murray, for some reason or other, declined\r\nto interfere; but the marquis undertook to mediate between the\r\nparties. Accordingly, he sent for the laird of Pitcaple to come to\r\nthe Bog of Gight to confer with him; but, before setting out, he\r\nmounted and equipped about 30 horsemen, in consequence of information\r\nhe had received that Frendraught was at the Bog. At the meeting with\r\nthe marquis, Pitcaple complained heavily of the injury his son had\r\nsustained, and avowed, rather rashly, that he would revenge himself\r\nbefore he returned home, and that, at all events, he would listen\r\nto no proposals for a reconciliation till it should be ascertained\r\nwhether his son would survive the wound he had received. The marquis\r\ninsisted that Frendraught had done him no wrong, and endeavoured to\r\ndissuade him from putting his threat into execution; but Pitcaple\r\nwas so displeased at the marquis for thus expressing himself, that\r\nhe suddenly mounted his horse and set off, leaving Frendraught\r\nbehind him. The marquis, afraid of the consequences, detained\r\nFrendraught two days with him in the Bog of Gight, and, hearing that\r\nthe Leslies had assembled, and lay in wait for Frendraught watching\r\nhis return home, the marquis sent his son, John, Viscount of Aboyne,\r\nand the laird of Rothiemay along with him, to protect and defend\r\nhim if necessary. They arrived at Frendraught without interruption,\r\nand being solicited to remain all night, they yielded, and, after\r\npartaking of a hearty supper, went to bed in the apartments provided\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frendraught House, with the ruins of the old Castle in\r\nfront.--From a photograph taken for this work.]\r\n\r\nThe sleeping apartment of the viscount was in the old tower of\r\nFrendraught, leading off from the hall. Immediately below this\r\napartment was a vault, in the bottom of which was a round hole of\r\nconsiderable depth. Robert Gordon, a servant of the viscount, and\r\nhis page, English Will, as he was called, also slept in the same\r\nchamber. The laird of Rothiemay, with some servants, were put into\r\nan upper chamber immediately above that in which the viscount slept;\r\nand in another apartment, directly over the latter, were laid George\r\nChalmer of Noth, Captain Rollock, one of Frendraught’s party, and\r\nGeorge Gordon, another of the viscount’s servants. About midnight\r\nthe whole of the tower almost instantaneously took fire, and so\r\nsuddenly and furiously did the flames consume the edifice, that the\r\nviscount, the laird of Rothiemay, English Will, Colonel Ivat, one of\r\nAboyne’s friends, and two other persons, perished in the flames.\r\nRobert Gordon, called Sutherland Gordon, from having been born in\r\nthat county, who lay in the viscount’s chamber, escaped from the\r\nflames, as did George Chalmer and Captain Rollock, who were in the\r\nthird floor; and it is said that Lord Aboyne might have saved himself\r\nalso, had he not, instead of going out of doors, which he refused to\r\ndo, run suddenly up stairs to Rothiemay’s chamber for the purpose\r\nof awakening him. While so engaged, the stair-case and ceiling of\r\nRothiemay’s apartment hastily took fire, and, being prevented from\r\ndescending by the flames, which filled the stair-case, they ran\r\nfrom window to window of the apartment piteously and unavailingly\r\nexclaiming for help.\r\n\r\nThe news of this calamitous event spread speedily throughout the\r\nkingdom, and the fate of the unfortunate sufferers was deeply\r\ndeplored. Many conjectures were formed as to the cause of the\r\nconflagration. Some persons laid the blame on Frendraught without\r\nthe least reason; for, besides the improbability of the thing,\r\nFrendraught himself was a considerable loser, having lost not only a\r\nlarge quantity of silver plate and coin, but also the title deeds of\r\nhis property and other necessary papers, which were all consumed. The\r\ngreater number, however, suspected the Leslies and their adherents,\r\nwho were then so enraged at Frendraught that they threatened to burn\r\nthe house of Frendraught, and had even entered into a negotiation\r\nto that effect with James Grant the rebel, who was Pitcaple’s\r\ncousin-german, for his assistance.[222]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly, who suspected Frendraught to be the author of\r\nthe fire, afterwards went to Edinburgh and laid a statement of the\r\ncase before the Privy Council, who, thereupon, issued a commission\r\nto the bishops of Aberdeen and Moray, Lord Ogilvie, Lord Carnegie,\r\nand Colonel Bruce, to investigate the circumstances which led to\r\nthe catastrophe. The commissioners accordingly went to Frendraught\r\non April 13th, 1631, where they were met by Lords Gordon, Ogilvie,\r\nand Deskford, and several barons and gentlemen, along with whom\r\nthey examined the burnt tower and vaults below, with the adjoining\r\npremises, to ascertain, if possible, how the fire had originated.\r\nAfter a minute inspection, they came to the deliberate opinion, which\r\nthey communicated in writing to the council, that the fire could not\r\nhave been accidental, and that it must have been occasioned either by\r\nsome means from without, or raised intentionally within the vaults or\r\nchambers of the tower.[223]\r\n\r\nThe matter, however, was not allowed to rest here, but underwent\r\nthorough investigation by the Privy Council in Edinburgh, the result\r\nbeing that John Meldrum, above mentioned, was brought to trial and\r\ncondemned to death by the Justiciary Court, in August, 1633, as\r\nhaving been the perpetrator of the fiendish deed. We give below an\r\nextract from the “dittay” or indictment against Meldrum, showing\r\nthe manner in which it was thought he accomplished his devilish\r\ntask.[224] The catastrophe roused such intense and wide-spread\r\nexcitement among all classes of people at the time, that the grief\r\nand horror which was felt found an outlet in verse.[225]\r\n\r\nDuring James Grant’s confinement within the castle of Edinburgh,\r\nthe north was comparatively quiet. On the night of the 15th\r\nOctober, 1632, he, however, effected his escape from the castle by\r\ndescending on the west side by means of ropes furnished to him by\r\nhis wife or son, and fled to Ireland. Proclamations were immediately\r\nposted throughout the whole kingdom, offering large sums for his\r\napprehension, either dead or alive, but to no purpose. His wife\r\nwas taken into custody by order of the Marquis of Huntly, but after\r\nundergoing an examination, in which she admitted nothing which could\r\nin the least degree criminate her, she was set at liberty.[226]\r\n\r\nJames Grant did not remain long in Ireland, but returned again to the\r\nnorth, where he concealed himself for some time, only occasionally\r\nskulking here and there in such a private manner, that his enemies\r\nwere not aware of his presence. By degrees he grew bolder, and at\r\nlast appeared openly in Strathdoun and on Speyside. His wife, who\r\nwas far advanced in pregnancy, had taken a small house in Carron,\r\nbelonging to the heirs of her husband’s nephew, in which she meant\r\nto reside till her accouchement, and in which she was occasionally\r\nvisited by her husband. Ballindalloch hearing of this, hired a\r\nperson named Patrick Macgregor, an outlaw, to apprehend James Grant.\r\nThis employment was considered by Macgregor and his party a piece\r\nof acceptable service, as they expected, in the event of Grant’s\r\napprehension, to obtain pardon for their offences from the lords of\r\nthe council. Macgregor, therefore, at the head of a party of men,\r\nlay in wait for James Grant near Carron, and, on observing him enter\r\nhis wife’s house at night, along with his bastard son and another\r\nman, they immediately surrounded the house and attempted to force an\r\nentry. Grant perceiving his danger, acted with great coolness and\r\ndetermination. Having fastened the door as firmly as he could, he and\r\nhis two companions went to two windows, from which they discharged a\r\nvolley of arrows upon their assailants, who all shrunk back, and none\r\nwould venture near the door except Macgregor himself, who came boldly\r\nforward and endeavoured to force it; but he paid dearly for his\r\nrashness, for Grant, immediately laying hold of a musket, shot him\r\nthrough both his thighs, when he instantly fell to the ground, and\r\nsoon after expired. In the confusion which this occurrence occasioned\r\namong Macgregor’s party, Grant and his two associates escaped.\r\n\r\nShortly after this event, on the night of Sunday, December 7th, 1634,\r\nJames Grant apprehended his cousin, John Grant of Ballindalloch, by\r\nstratagem. After remaining a few days at Culquholy, Ballindalloch was\r\nblindfolded and taken to Thomas Grant’s house at Dandeis, about three\r\nmiles from Elgin, on the high road between that town and the Spey.\r\nJames Grant ordered him to be watched strictly, whether sleeping\r\nor waking, by two strong men on each side of him. Ballindalloch\r\ncomplained of foul play, but James Grant excused himself for acting\r\nas he had done for two reasons; 1st, Because Ballindalloch had failed\r\nto perform a promise he had made to obtain a remission for him before\r\nthe preceding Lammas; and, 2dly, That he had entered into a treaty\r\nwith the clan Gregor to deprive him of his life.\r\n\r\nBallindalloch was kept in durance vile for twenty days in a kiln near\r\nThomas Grant’s house, suffering the greatest privations, without\r\nfire, light, or bed-clothes, in the dead of winter, and without\r\nknowing where he was. He was closely watched night and day by Leonard\r\nLeslie, son-in-law of Robert Grant, brother of James Grant, and\r\na strong athletic man, named M’Grimmon, who would not allow him\r\nto leave the kiln for a moment even to perform the necessities of\r\nnature. On Christmas, James Grant and his party having gone on some\r\nexcursion, leaving Leslie and M’Grimmon behind them, Ballindalloch,\r\nworn out by fatigue, and almost perishing from cold and hunger,\r\naddressed Leslie in a low tone of voice, lamenting his miserable\r\nsituation, and imploring him to aid him in effecting his escape,\r\nand promising, in the event of success, to reward him handsomely.\r\nLeslie, tempted by the offer, acceded to Ballindalloch’s request, and\r\nmade him acquainted with the place of his confinement. It was then\r\narranged that Ballindalloch, under the pretence of stretching his\r\narms, should disengage the arm which Leslie held, and that, having\r\nso disentangled that arm, he should, by another attempt, get his\r\nother arm out of M’Grimmon’s grasp. The morning of Sunday, the 28th\r\nof December, was fixed upon for putting the stratagem into execution.\r\nThe plan succeeded, and as soon as Ballindalloch found his arms at\r\nliberty, he suddenly sprung to his feet and made for the door of\r\nthe kiln. Leslie immediately followed him, pretending to catch him,\r\nand as M’Grimmon was hard upon his heels, Leslie purposely stumbled\r\nin his way and brought M’Grimmon down to the ground. This stratagem\r\nenabled Ballindalloch to get a-head of his pursuers, and although\r\nM’Grimmon sounded the alarm, and the pursuit was continued by Robert\r\nGrant and a party of James Grant’s followers, Ballindalloch succeeded\r\nin reaching the village of Urquhart in safety, accompanied by Leonard\r\nLeslie.\r\n\r\nSometime after his escape, Ballindalloch applied for and obtained\r\na warrant for the apprehension of Thomas Grant, and others, for\r\nharbouring James Grant. Thomas Grant, and some of his accomplices,\r\nwere accordingly seized and sent to Edinburgh, where they were tried\r\nand convicted. Grant was hanged, and others were banished from\r\nScotland for life.\r\n\r\nAfter Ballindalloch’s escape, James Grant kept remarkably quiet,\r\nas many persons lay in wait for him; but hearing that Thomas\r\nGrant, brother of Patrick Grant of Colquhoche, and a friend of\r\nBallindalloch, had received a sum of money from the Earl of Moray,\r\nas an encouragement to seek out and slay James Grant, the latter\r\nresolved to murder Thomas Grant, and thus relieve himself of one\r\nenemy at least. He therefore went to Thomas’s house, but not finding\r\nhim at home, he killed sixteen of his cattle; and afterwards learning\r\nthat Thomas Grant was sleeping at the house of a friend hard by, he\r\nentered that house and found Thomas Grant and a bastard brother of\r\nhis, both in bed. Having forced them out of bed, he took them outside\r\nof the house and put them immediately to death. A few days after\r\nthe commission of this crime, Grant and four of his associates went\r\nto the lands of Strathbogie, and entered the house of the common\r\nexecutioner, craving some food, without being aware of the profession\r\nof the host whose hospitality they solicited. The executioner,\r\ndisliking the appearance of Grant and his companions, went to James\r\nGordon, the bailie of Strathbogie, and informed him that there were\r\nsome suspicious looking persons in his house. Judging that these\r\ncould be none other but Grant and his comrades, Gordon immediately\r\ncollected some well-armed horsemen and foot, and surrounded the\r\nhouse in which Grant was; but he successfully resisted all their\r\nattempts to enter the house, and killed two servants of the Marquis\r\nof Huntly. After keeping them at bay for a considerable time, Grant\r\nand his brother, Robert, effected their escape from the house, but\r\na bastard son of James Grant, John Forbes, an intimate associate,\r\nand another person, were taken prisoners, and carried to Edinburgh,\r\nwhere they were executed, along with a notorious thief, named\r\nGille-Roy-Mac-Gregor. This occurrence took place in the year 1636.\r\nThe laird of Grant had, during the previous year, been ordered by the\r\ncouncil to apprehend James Grant, or to make him leave the kingdom;\r\nand they had obliged him to find caution and surety, in terms of\r\nthe general bond[227] appointed by law to be taken from all the\r\nheads of clans, and from all governors of provinces in the kingdom,\r\nbut chiefly in the west and north of Scotland; but the laird could\r\nneither perform the one nor the other.[228]\r\n\r\nBy the judicious management of the affairs of the house of Sutherland\r\nby Sir Robert Gordon, his nephew, the earl, on reaching his majority\r\nin 1630 and entering upon the management of his own affairs, found\r\nthe hostility of the enemy of his family either neutralised or\r\nrendered no longer dangerous; but, in the year 1633 he found himself\r\ninvolved in a quarrel with Lord Lorn, eldest son of the Earl of\r\nArgyle, who had managed the affairs of his family during his father’s\r\nbanishment from Scotland. This dispute arose out of the following\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a quarrel between Lord Berridale, who now acted as\r\nsole administrator of his father’s estates, and William Mac-Iver,\r\nchieftain of the Siol-Mhic-Imheair, in Caithness, the former\r\nremoved the latter from the lands and possessions he held of him\r\nin Caithness. Mac-Iver thereupon retired into Argyle, and assuming\r\nthe surname of Campbell, as being originally an Argyle man, sought\r\nthe favour and protection of Lord Lorn. The latter endeavoured, by\r\nwriting to the Earl of Sutherland, Berridale himself, and others, to\r\nbring about a reconciliation between Mac-Iver and Berridale, but to\r\nno purpose. Seeing no hopes of an accommodation, Mac-Iver collected\r\na party of rebels and outlaws, to the number of about 20, and made\r\nan incursion into Caithness, where, during the space of four or five\r\nyears, he did great injury, carrying off considerable spoil, which he\r\nconveyed through the heights of Strathnaver and Sutherland.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to Mac-Iver’s depredations, Lord Berridale at first\r\nbrought a legal prosecution against him, and having got him denounced\r\nrebel, sent out parties of his countrymen to ensnare him; but he\r\nescaped for a long time, and always retired in safety with his\r\nbooty, either into the isles or into Argyle. Lord Lorn, however,\r\npublicly disowned Mac-Iver’s proceedings. In his incursions,\r\nMac-Iver was powerfully assisted by an islander of the name of\r\nGille-Calum-Mac-Shomhairle, who had married his daughter, and who was\r\nwell acquainted with all the passes leading into Caithness.\r\n\r\nAt last Mac-Iver and his son were apprehended by Lord Berridale,\r\nand hanged, and the race of the Siol-Mhic-Imheair was almost\r\nextinguished; but Gille-Calum-Mac-Shomhairle having associated with\r\nhimself several of the men of the Isles and Argyle, and some outlaws\r\nof the clan Mhic-Iain-Dhuinn, who were dependants of Lord Lorn,\r\ncontinued his incursions into Caithness. Having divided his company\r\ninto two parties, one of which, headed by Gille-Calum himself, went\r\nto the higher parts of Ross and Sutherland, there to remain till\r\njoined by their companions. The other party went through the lowlands\r\nof Ross, under the pretence of going to the Lammas fair, then held at\r\nTain, and thence proceeded to Sutherland to meet the rest of their\r\nassociates, under the pretence of visiting certain kinsmen they\r\nsaid they had in Strathully and Strathnaver. This last-mentioned\r\nbody consisted of 16 or 20 persons, most of whom were of the clan\r\nMhic-Iain-Dhuinn. They were under the command of one Ewen Aird; and\r\nas they passed the town of Tain, on their way to Sutherland, they\r\nstole some horses, which they sold in Sutherland, without being in\r\nthe least suspected of the theft.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the stolen horses soon came into Sutherland in quest\r\nof them, and claimed them from the persons to whom they had been\r\nsold. The Earl of Sutherland, on proof being given of the property,\r\nrestored the horses to the true owners, and sent some men in quest\r\nof Ewen Aird, who was still in Strathully. Ewen was apprehended\r\nand brought to Dunrobin. The Earl of Sutherland ordained him to\r\nrepay the monies which Ewen and his companions had received for\r\nthe horses, the only punishment he said he would inflict on them,\r\nbecause they were strangers. Ewen assented to the earl’s request,\r\nand remained as a hostage at Dunrobin until his companions should\r\nsend money to relieve him; but as soon as his associates heard of\r\nhis detention, they, instead of sending money for his release, fled\r\nto Gille-Calum-Mac-Shomhairle and his party, leaving their captain a\r\nprisoner at Dunrobin. In their retreat they destroyed some houses in\r\nthe high parts of Sutherland, and on entering Ross they laid waste\r\nsome lands belonging to Hutcheon Ross of Auchincloigh. These outrages\r\noccasioned an immediate assemblage of the inhabitants of that part of\r\nthe country, who pursued the marauders and took them prisoners. On\r\nthe prisoners being sent to the Earl of Sutherland, he assembled the\r\nprincipal gentlemen of Ross and Sutherland at Dornoch, where Ewen\r\nAird and his accomplices were tried before a jury, convicted, and\r\nexecuted at Dornoch, with the exception of two young boys, who were\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council not only approved of what the Earl of Sutherland\r\nhad done, but also sent a commission to him, the Earl of Seaforth,\r\nHutcheon Ross, and some other gentlemen in Ross and Sutherland,\r\nagainst the clan Mhic-Iain-Dhuinn, in case they should again make any\r\nincursion into Ross and Sutherland.\r\n\r\nLord Lorn being at this time justiciary of the Isles, had obtained\r\nan act of the Privy Council in his favour, by which it was decreed\r\nthat any malefactor, being an islander, upon being apprehended in any\r\npart of the kingdom, should be sent to Lord Lorn, or to his deputies,\r\nto be judged; and that to this effect he should have deputies in\r\nevery part of the kingdom. As soon as his lordship heard of the\r\ntrial and execution of the men at Dornoch, who were of the clan\r\nMhic-Iain-Dhuinn, his dependants and followers, he took the matter\r\nhighly amiss, and repaired to Edinburgh, where he made a complaint to\r\nthe lords of the council against the Earl of Sutherland, for having,\r\nas he maintained, apprehended the king’s free subjects without a\r\ncommission, and for causing them to be executed, although they had\r\nnot been apprehended within his own jurisdiction. The lords of the\r\ncouncil having heard this complaint, Lord Lorn obtained letters to\r\ncharge the Earl of Sutherland and Hutcheon Ross to answer to the\r\ncomplaint at Edinburgh before the lords of the Privy Council, and,\r\nmoreover, obtained a suspension of the earl’s commission against the\r\nclan Mhic-Iain-Dhuinn, on becoming bound, in the meantime, as surety\r\nfor their obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Gordon happening to arrive at Edinburgh from England,\r\nshortly after Lord Lorn’s visit to Edinburgh, in the year 1634,\r\nlearned the object of his mission, and the success which had attended\r\nit. He, therefore, being an eye-witness of every thing which had\r\ntaken place at Dornoch respecting the trial, condemnation, and\r\nexecution of Lord Lorn’s dependents, informed the lords of the\r\ncouncil of all the proceedings, which proceeding on his part had the\r\neffect of preventing Lord Lorn from going on with his prosecution\r\nagainst the Earl of Sutherland. He, however, proceeded to summon\r\nHutcheon Ross; but the earl, Sir Robert Gordon, Lord Reay, and all\r\nthe gentlemen who were present at the trial at Dornoch, signed\r\nand sent a letter to the lords of the council, giving a detail of\r\nthe whole circumstances of the case, and along with this letter\r\nhe sent a copy of the proceedings, attested by the sheriff clerk\r\nof Sutherland, to be laid before the council on the day appointed\r\nfor Ross’s appearance. After the matter had been fully debated in\r\ncouncil, the conduct of the Earl of Sutherland and Hutcheon Ross\r\nwas approved of, and the commission to the earl of Sutherland again\r\nrenewed, and Lord Lorn was taken bound, that, in time coming, the\r\ncounties of Sutherland and Ross should be kept harmless from the\r\nclan Mhic-Iain-Dhuinn. The council, moreover, decided, that, as the\r\nEarl of Sutherland had the rights of regality and sheriffship within\r\nhimself, and as he was appointed to administer justice within his\r\nown bounds, therefore he was not obliged to send criminals, though\r\nislanders, to Lord Lorn or to his deputies. This decision had the\r\neffect of relieving Sutherland and Ross from farther incursions on\r\nthe part of Lord Lorn’s followers.[229]\r\n\r\nThe disaster at Frendraught had made an impression upon the mind of\r\nthe Marquis of Huntly, which nothing could efface, and he could never\r\nbe persuaded that the fire had not originated with the proprietor of\r\nthe mansion himself. He made many unsuccessful attempts to discover\r\nthe incendiaries, and on the arrival of King Charles at Edinburgh, in\r\nthe year 1633, the marquis made preparations for paying a personal\r\nvisit to the king, for the purpose of imploring him to order an\r\ninvestigation into all the circumstances attending the fire, so as\r\nto lead to a discovery of the criminals. Falling sick, however, on\r\nhis journey, and unable to proceed to Edinburgh, he sent forward his\r\nmarchioness, who was accompanied by Lady Aboyne and other females\r\nof rank, all clothed in deep mourning, to lay a statement of the\r\ncase before his majesty, and to solicit the royal interference. The\r\nking received the marchioness and her attendants most graciously,\r\ncomforted them as far as words could, and promised to see justice\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAfter the king’s departure from Scotland, the marchioness and Lady\r\nAboyne, both of whom still remained in Edinburgh, determining to see\r\nhis majesty’s promise implemented, prevailed upon the Privy Council\r\nto bring John Meldrum of Reidhill to trial, the result being as\r\nrecorded above. A domestic servant of Frendraught named Tosh, who was\r\nsuspected of having been concerned in the fire, was afterwards put\r\nto the torture, for the purpose of extorting a confession of guilt\r\nfrom him; but he confessed nothing, and was therefore liberated from\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation and execution of Meldrum, in place of abating,\r\nappear to have increased the odium of Frendraught’s enemies. The\r\nHighlanders of his neighbourhood, as well as the Gordons, considering\r\nhis property to be fair game, made frequent incursions upon his\r\nlands, and carried off cattle and goods. In 1633 and 1634 Adam Gordon\r\nof Strathdoun, with a few of his friends and some outlaws, made\r\nincursions upon Frendraught’s lands, wasted them, and endeavoured\r\nto carry off a quantity of goods and cattle. Frendraught, however,\r\nheading some of his tenants, pursued them, secured the booty, and\r\ncaptured some of the party, whom he hanged.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, about 600 Highlanders, belonging to the clan\r\nGregor, clan Cameron, and other tribes, appeared near Frendraught,\r\nand openly declared that they had come to join Adam Gordon of Park,\r\nJohn Gordon of Invermarkie, and the other friends of the late\r\nGordon of Rothiemay, for the purpose of revenging his death. When\r\nFrendraught heard of the irruption of this body, he immediately\r\ncollected about 200 foot, and 140 horsemen, and went in quest of\r\nthese intruders; but being scattered through the country, they could\r\nmake no resistance, and every man provided for his own safety by\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to these annoyances, Frendraught got these marauders\r\ndeclared outlaws, and the lords of the Privy Council wrote to\r\nthe Marquis of Huntly, desiring him to repress the disorders of\r\nthose of his surname, and failing his doing so, that they would\r\nconsider him the author of them. The marquis returned an answer to\r\nthis communication, stating, that as the aggressors were neither\r\nhis tenants nor servants, he could in no shape be answerable for\r\nthem,--that he had neither countenanced nor incited them, and that he\r\nhad no warrant to pursue or prosecute them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Marquis and Marchioness of Huntly. Copied by\r\npermission of His Grace the Duke of Richmond, from the Originals at\r\nGordon Castle.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the marquis to obey the orders of the Privy Council,\r\nemboldened the denounced party to renew their acts of spoliation and\r\nrobbery. They no longer confined their depredations to Frendraught\r\nand his tenants, but extended them to the property of the ministers\r\nwho lived upon Frendraught’s lands. In this course of life, they\r\nwere joined by some of the young men of the principal families of\r\nthe Gordons in Strathbogie, to the number of 40 horsemen, and 60\r\nfoot, and to encourage them in their designs against Frendraught,\r\nthe lady of Rothiemay gave them the castle of Rothiemay, which they\r\nfortified, and from which they made daily sallies upon Frendraught’s\r\npossessions; burned his corn, laid waste his lands, and killed some\r\nof his people. Frendraught opposed them for some time; but being\r\nsatisfied that such proceedings taking place almost under the very\r\neyes of the Marquis of Huntly, must necessarily be done with his\r\nconcurrence he went to Edinburgh, and entered a complaint against\r\nthe marquis to the Privy Council. During Frendraught’s absence, his\r\ntenants were expelled by the Gordons from their possessions, without\r\nopposition.[230]\r\n\r\nWhen the king heard of these lawless proceedings, and of the\r\nrefusal of the marquis to interfere, he ordered the lords of the\r\nPrivy Council to adopt measures for suppressing them; preparatory\r\nto which they cited the marquis, in the beginning of the following\r\nyear, to appear before them to answer for these oppressions. He\r\naccordingly went to Edinburgh in the month of February, 1635, where\r\nhe was commanded to remain till the matter should be investigated.\r\nThe heads of the families whose sons had joined the outlaws also\r\nappeared, and, after examination, Letterfourie, Park, Tilliangus,\r\nTerrisoule, Invermarkie, Tulloch, Ardlogy, and several other persons\r\nof the surname of Gordon, were committed to prison, until their\r\nsons, who had engaged in the combination against Frendraught, should\r\nbe presented before the council. The prisoners, who denied being\r\naccessory thereto, then petitioned to be set at liberty, a request\r\nwhich was complied with on condition that they should either produce\r\nthe rebels, as the pillagers were called, or make them leave the\r\nkingdom. The marquis, although nothing could be proved against him,\r\nwas obliged to find caution that all persons of the surname of\r\nGordon within his bounds should keep the peace; and that he should\r\nbe answerable in all time coming for any damage which should befall\r\nthe laird of Frendraught, or his lands, by whatever violent means;\r\nand also that he should present the rebels at Edinburgh, that justice\r\nmight be satisfied, or make them leave the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly, thereupon, returned to the north, and the\r\nrebels hearing of the obligation he had come under, immediately\r\ndispersed themselves. The greater part of them fled into Flanders,\r\nand about twelve of them were apprehended by the marquis, and sent by\r\nhim to Edinburgh. John Gordon, who lived at Woodhead of Rothiemay,\r\nand another, were executed. Of the remaining two, James Gordon, son\r\nof George Gordon in Auchterless, and William Ross, son of John Ross\r\nof Ballivet, the former was acquitted by the jury, and the latter was\r\nimprisoned in the jail of Edinburgh for future trial, having been a\r\nringleader of the party. In apprehending these twelve persons, James\r\nGordon, son of Adam Gordon of Strathdoun, was killed, and to show the\r\nPrivy Council how diligent the marquis had been in fulfilling his\r\nobligation, his head was sent to Edinburgh along with the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe activity with which the marquis pursued the oppressors of\r\nFrendraught, brought him afterwards into some trouble. Adam Gordon,\r\none of the principal ringleaders of the confederacy, and second son\r\nof Sir Adam Gordon of the Park, thinking it “hard to be baneishit out\r\nof his native country, resoluit to cum home” and throw himself on the\r\nking’s mercy. For this purpose he made a private communication to\r\nthe Archbishop of St. Andrews, then chancellor of Scotland, in which\r\nhe offered to submit himself to the king’s pleasure, promising, that\r\nif his majesty would grant him a pardon, he would reveal the author\r\nof the rebellion. The archbishop, eager, it would appear, to fulfil\r\nthe ends of justice, readily entered into Gordon’s views, and sent a\r\nspecial messenger to London to the king, who at once granted Adam a\r\npardon. On receiving the pardon, Gordon accused the Marquis of Huntly\r\nas the author of the conspiracy against Frendraught, and with having\r\ninstigated him and his associates to commit all the depredations\r\nwhich had taken place. The king, thereupon, sent a commission to\r\nScotland, appointing a select number of the lords of the Privy\r\nCouncil to examine into the affair.\r\n\r\nAs Adam Gordon had charged James Gordon of Letterfourie, with\r\nhaving employed him and his associates, in name of the marquis,\r\nagainst the laird of Frendraught, Letterfourie was cited to appear\r\nat Edinburgh for trial. On being confronted with Adam Gordon, he\r\ndenied everything laid to his charge, but, notwithstanding this\r\ndenial, he was committed a prisoner to the jail of Edinburgh. The\r\nmarquis himself, who had also appeared at Edinburgh on the appointed\r\nday, January 15th, 1636, was likewise confronted with Adam Gordon\r\nbefore the committee of the Privy Council; but although he denied\r\nAdam’s accusation, and “cleared himself with great dexteritie,\r\nbeyond admiration,” as Gordon of Sallagh observes, he was, “upon\r\npresumption,” committed a close prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nWhen his majesty was made acquainted with these circumstances by the\r\ncommissioners, and that there was no proof to establish the charge\r\nagainst the marquis, both the marquis and Gordon of Letterfourie\r\nwere released by his command, on giving security for indemnifying\r\nthe laird of Frendraught for any damage he might sustain in time\r\ncoming, from the Gordons and their accomplices. Having so far\r\nsucceeded in annoying the marquis, Adam Gordon, after collecting a\r\nbody of men, by leave of the Privy Council, went along with them to\r\nGermany, where he became a captain in the regiment of Colonel George\r\nLeslie. To terminate the unhappy differences between the marquis and\r\nFrendraught, the king enjoined Sir Robert Gordon, who was related\r\nto both,--the marquis being his cousin-german, and chief of that\r\nfamily, and Frendraught the husband of his niece,--to endeavour to\r\nbring about a reconciliation between them. Sir Robert, accordingly,\r\non his return to Scotland, prevailed upon the parties to enter\r\ninto a submission, by which they agreed to refer all questions and\r\ndifferences between them to the arbitrament of friends; but before\r\nthe submission was brought to a final conclusion, the marquis\r\nexpired at Dundee on the 13th June, (15th according to Gordon),\r\n1636, at the age of seventy-four, while returning to the north from\r\nEdinburgh. He was interred in the family vault at Elgin, on the\r\nthirtieth day of August following, “having,” says Spalding, “above\r\nhis chist a rich mort-cloath of black velvet, wherein was wrought two\r\nwhyte crosses. He had torchlights in great number carried be freinds\r\nand gentlemen; the marques’ son, called Adam, was at his head, the\r\nearle of Murray on the right spaik, the earle of Seaforth on the left\r\nspaik, the earle of Sutherland on the third spaik, and Sir Robert\r\nGordon on the fourth spaik. Besyds thir nobles, many barrons and\r\ngentlemen was there, haveing above three hundred lighted torches at\r\nthe lifting. He is carried to the east port, doun the wynd to the\r\nsouth kirk stile of the colledge kirk, in at the south kirk door,\r\nand buried in his own isle with much murning and lamentation. The\r\nlike forme of burriall, with torch light, was not sein heir thir many\r\ndayes befor.”[231]\r\n\r\nThe marquis was a remarkable man for the age in which he lived, and\r\nthere are no characters in that eventful period of Scottish history\r\nso well entitled to veneration and esteem. A lover of justice, he\r\nnever attempted to aggrandize his vast possessions at the expense\r\nof his less powerful neighbours; a kind and humane superior and\r\nlandlord, he exercised a lenient sway over his numerous vassals and\r\ntenants, who repaid his kindness by sincere attachment to his person\r\nand family. Endowed with great strength of mind, invincible courage,\r\nand consummate prudence, he surmounted the numerous difficulties with\r\nwhich he was surrounded, and lived to see the many factions which had\r\nconspired against him discomfited and dissolved. While his constant\r\nand undeviating attachment to the religion of his forefathers, raised\r\nup many enemies against him among the professors of the reformed\r\ndoctrines, by whose cabals he was at one time obliged to leave the\r\nkingdom, his great power and influence were assailed by another\r\nformidable class of opponents among the turbulent nobility, who\r\nwere grieved to see a man who had not imitated their venality and\r\nrapacity, not only retain his predominance in the north, but also\r\nreceive especial marks of his sovereign’s regard. But skilful and\r\nintriguing as they were in all the dark and sinister ways of an age\r\ndistinguished for its base and wicked practices, their machinations\r\nwere frustrated by the discernment and honesty of George Gordon, the\r\nfirst Marquis of Huntly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] Spalding says that the party were commanded by Lauchlan\r\nMacintosh, _alias_ Lauchlan Og, uncle of the young chief, and\r\nLauchlan Macintosh or Lauchlan Angus-son, eldest son of Angus\r\nMacintosh, _alias_ Angus William, son of Auld Tirlie.--_Memorialls of\r\nthe Trubles in Scotland and in England_, A.D. 1624-1645.\r\n\r\n[212] _Memorials_, vol. i. p. 8.\r\n\r\n[213] Founder of the house of Culloden, and great-grandfather of the\r\ncelebrated Lord President Forbes.\r\n\r\n[214] _Vide_ the petition of Provost Forbes to the king, “in the name\r\nof the inhabitants” of Inverness; printed among the Culloden Papers,\r\nNo. 5, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[215] Sir R.

The plan on which this\r\nAct chiefly proceeded was, “To make it imperative on all landlords,\r\nbailies, and chiefs of clans, to find sureties to a large amount,\r\nproportioned to their wealth and the number of their vassals or\r\nclansmen, for the peaceable and orderly behaviour of those under\r\nthem. It was provided, that, if a superior, after having found the\r\nrequired sureties, should fail to make immediate reparation of any\r\ninjuries committed by persons for whom he was bound to answer, the\r\ninjured party might proceed at law against the sureties for the\r\namount of the damage sustained. Besides being compelled, in such\r\ncases, to reimburse his sureties, the superior was to incur a heavy\r\nfine to the Crown. This important statute likewise contained many\r\nuseful provisions for facilitating the administration of justice\r\nin these rude districts.”--Spalding’s _Memorialls_, vol. i. p. 3,\r\n(note).

We now enter upon a\r\nmore important era, when the Highlanders begin to play a much more\r\nprominent part in the theatre of our national history, and to give a\r\nforetaste of that military prowess for which they afterwards became\r\nso highly distinguished.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the details of the military achievements of the\r\nHighlanders during the period of the civil wars, it is quite\r\nunnecessary and foreign to our purpose to trouble the reader with\r\na history of the rash, unconstitutional, and ill-fated attempt of\r\nCharles I. to introduce Episcopacy into Scotland; nor, for the same\r\nreason, is it requisite to detail minutely the proceedings of the\r\nauthors of the Covenant. Suffice it to say, that in consequence of\r\nthe inflexible determination of Charles to force English Episcopacy\r\nupon the people of Scotland, the great majority of the nation\r\ndeclared their determination “by the great name of the Lord their\r\nGod,” to defend their religion against what they considered to be\r\nerrors and corruptions. Notwithstanding, however, the most positive\r\ndemonstrations on the part of the people to resist, Charles, acting\r\nby the advice of a privy council of Scotsmen established in England,\r\nexclusively devoted to the affairs of Scotland, and instigated by\r\nArchbishop Laud, resolved to suppress the Covenant by open force.\r\nIn order to gain time for the necessary preparations, he sent the\r\nMarquis of Hamilton, as his commissioner, to Scotland, who was\r\ninstructed to promise “that the practice of the liturgy and the\r\ncanons should never be pressed in any other than a fair and legal\r\nway, and that the high commission should be so rectified as never\r\nto impugn the laws, or to be a just grievance to loyal subjects,”\r\nand that the king would pardon those who had lately taken an illegal\r\ncovenant, on their immediately renouncing it, and giving up the bond\r\nto the commissioners.\r\n\r\nWhen the Covenanters heard of Hamilton’s approach, they appointed a\r\nnational fast to be held, to beg the blessing of God upon the kirk,\r\nand on the 10th of June, 1638, the marquis was received at Leith,\r\nand proceeded to the capital through an assemblage of about 60,000\r\nCovenanters, and 500 ministers. The spirit and temper of such a\r\nvast assemblage overawed the marquis, and he therefore concealed\r\nhis instructions. After making two successive journeys to London\r\nto communicate the alarming state of affairs, and to receive fresh\r\ninstructions, he, on his second return, issued a proclamation,\r\ndischarging “the service book, the book of canons, and the high\r\ncommission court, dispensing with the five articles of Perth,\r\ndispensing the entrants into the ministry from taking the oath of\r\nsupremacy and of canonical obedience, commanding all persons to lay\r\naside the new Covenant, and take that which had been published by the\r\nking’s father in 1589, and summoning a free assembly of the kirk to\r\nmeet in the month of November, and a parliament in the month of May,\r\nthe following year.” Matters had, however, proceeded too far for\r\nsubmission to the conditions of the proclamation, and the covenanting\r\nleaders answered it by a formal protest, in which they gave sixteen\r\nreasons, showing that to comply with the demands of the king would\r\nbe to betray the cause of God, and to act against the dictates of\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the opposition made to the proclamation, it was\r\ngenerally expected that the king would have recalled the order for\r\nthe meeting of the assembly at Glasgow; but no prohibition having\r\nbeen issued, that assembly, which consisted, besides the clergy, of\r\none lay-elder and four lay-assessors from every presbytery, met at\r\nthe time appointed, viz., in the month of November, 1638. After the\r\nassembly had spent a week in violent debates, the commissioner, in\r\nterms of his instructions, declared it dissolved; but, encouraged\r\nby the accession of the Earl of Argyle, who placed himself at the\r\nhead of the Covenanters, the members declined to disperse at the\r\nmere mandate of the sovereign, and passed a resolution that, in\r\nspiritual matters, the kirk was independent of the civil power, and\r\nthat the dissolution by the commissioner was illegal and void. After\r\nspending three weeks in revising the ecclesiastical regulations\r\nintroduced into Scotland since the accession of James to the crown\r\nof England, the assembly condemned the liturgy, ordinal, book of\r\ncanons, and court of high commission, and, assuming all the powers\r\nof legislation, abolished episcopacy, and excommunicated the bishops\r\nthemselves, and the ministers who supported them. Charles declared\r\ntheir proceedings null; but the people received them with great joy,\r\nand testified their approbation by a national thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nBoth parties had for some time been preparing for war, and they\r\nnow hastened on their plans. In consequence of an order from the\r\nsupreme committee of the Covenanters in Edinburgh, every man\r\ncapable of bearing arms was called out and trained. Experienced\r\nScottish officers, who had spent the greater part of their lives\r\nin military service in Sweden and Germany, returned to Scotland to\r\nplace themselves at the head of their countrymen, and the Scottish\r\nmerchants in Holland supplied them with arms and ammunition. The\r\nking advanced as far as York with an army, the Scottish bishops\r\nmaking him believe that the news of his approach would induce\r\nthe Covenanters to submit themselves to his pleasure; but he was\r\ndisappointed,--for instead of submitting themselves, they were\r\nthe first to commence hostilities. About the 19th of March, 1639,\r\nGeneral Leslie, the covenanting general, with a few men, surprised,\r\nand without difficulty, occupied the castle of Edinburgh, and about\r\nthe same time the Earl of Traquair surrendered Dalkeith house.\r\nDumbarton castle, like that of Edinburgh, was taken by stratagem, the\r\ngovernor, named Stewart, being intercepted on a Sunday as he returned\r\nfrom church, and made to change clothes with another gentleman and\r\ngive the pass-word, by which means the Covenanters easily obtained\r\npossession. The king, on arriving at Durham, despatched the Marquis\r\nof Hamilton with a fleet of forty ships, having on board 6,000\r\ntroops, to the Frith of Forth; but as both sides of the Frith were\r\nwell fortified at different points, and covered with troops, he was\r\nunable to effect a landing.[232]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Marquis of Huntly raised the royal standard in\r\nthe north, and as the Earl of Sutherland, accompanied by Lord Reay,\r\nJohn, Master of Berridale and others, had been very busy in Inverness\r\nand Elgin, persuading the inhabitants to subscribe the Covenant, the\r\nmarquis wrote him confidentially, blaming him for his past conduct,\r\nand advising him to declare for the king; but the earl informed him\r\nin reply, that it was against the bishops and their innovations, and\r\nnot against the king, that he had so acted. The earl then, in his\r\nturn, advised the marquis to join the Covenanters, by doing which\r\nhe said he would not only confer honour on himself, but much good\r\non his native country; that in any private question in which Huntly\r\nwas personally interested he would assist, but that in the present\r\naffair he would not aid him. The earl thereupon joined the Earl of\r\nSeaforth, the Master of Berridale, Lord Lovat, Lord Reay, the laird\r\nof Balnagown, the Rosses, the Monroes, the laird of Grant, Macintosh,\r\nthe laird of Innes, the sheriff of Moray, the baron of Kilravock, the\r\nlaird of Altire, the tutor of Duffus, and the other Covenanters on\r\nthe north of the river Spey.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly assembled his forces first at Turriff, and\r\nafterwards at Kintore, whence he marched upon Aberdeen, which he took\r\npossession of in name of the king. The marquis being informed shortly\r\nafter his arrival in Aberdeen, that a meeting of Covenanters, who\r\nresided within his district, was to be held at Turriff on the 14th\r\nof February, resolved to disperse them. He therefore wrote letters\r\nto his chief dependents, requiring them to meet him at Turriff the\r\nsame day, and bring with them no arms but swords and “schottis” or\r\npistols. One of these letters fell into the hands of the Earl of\r\nMontrose, one of the chief covenanting lords, who determined at all\r\nhazards to protect the meeting of his friends, the Covenanters. In\r\npursuance of this resolution, he collected, with great alacrity, some\r\nof his best friends in Angus, and with his own and their dependents,\r\nto the number of about 800 men, he crossed the range of hills called\r\nthe Grangebean, between Angus and Aberdeenshire, and took possession\r\nof Turriff on the morning of the 14th of February. When Huntly’s\r\nparty arrived during the course of the day, they were surprised at\r\nseeing the little churchyard of the village filled with armed men;\r\nand they were still more surprised to observe them levelling their\r\nhagbuts at them across the walls of the churchyard. Not knowing how\r\nto act in the absence of the marquis, they retired to a place called\r\nthe Broad Ford of Towie, about two miles south from the village,\r\nwhen they were soon joined by Huntly and his suite. After some\r\nconsultation, the marquis, after parading his men in order of battle\r\nalong the north-west side of the village, in sight of Montrose,\r\ndispersed his party, which amounted to 2,000 men, without offering to\r\nattack Montrose, on the pretence that his commission of lieutenancy\r\nonly authorised him to act on the defensive.[233]\r\n\r\nJames Graham, Earl, and afterwards first Marquis of Montrose, who\r\nplayed so prominent a part in the history of the troublous times\r\non which we are entering, was descended from a family which can be\r\ntraced back to the beginning of the 12th century. His ancestor,\r\nthe Earl of Montrose, fell at Flodden, and his grandfather became\r\nviceroy of Scotland after James VI. ascended the throne of England.\r\nHe himself was born in 1612, his mother being Lady Margaret Ruthven,\r\neldest daughter of William, first Earl of Gowrie. He succeeded to\r\nthe estates and title in 1626, on the death of his father, and three\r\nyears after, married Magdalene Carnegie, daughter of Lord Carnegie\r\nof Kinnaird. He pursued his studies at St. Andrews University and\r\nKinnaird Castle till he was about twenty years of age, when he went\r\nto the Continent and studied at the academies of France and Italy,\r\nreturning an accomplished gentleman and a soldier. On his return\r\nhe was, for some reason, coldly received by Charles I., and it is\r\nsupposed by some that it was mainly out of chagrin on this account\r\nthat he joined the Covenanters. Whatever may have been his motive for\r\njoining them, he was certainly an important and powerful accession to\r\ntheir ranks, although, as will be seen, his adherence to them was but\r\nof short duration.\r\n\r\nMontrose is thus portrayed by his contemporary, Patrick Gordon of\r\nRuthven, author of _Britane’s Distemper_. “It cannot be denied but\r\nhe was ane accomplished gentleman of many excellent partes; a bodie\r\nnot tall, but comely and well compossed in all his liniamentes;\r\nhis complexion meerly whitee, with flaxin haire; of a stayed,\r\ngraue, and solide looke, and yet his eyes sparkling and full of\r\nlyfe; of speach slowe, but wittie and full of sence; a presence\r\ngraitfull, courtly, and so winneing vpon the beholder, as it seemed\r\nto claime reuerence without seweing for it; for he was so affable,\r\nso courteous, so benign, as seemed verely to scorne ostentation and\r\nthe keeping of state, and therefor he quicklie made a conquesse of\r\nthe heartes of all his followers, so as whan he list he could haue\r\nlead them in a chaine to haue followed him with chearefullnes in\r\nall his interpryses; and I am certanely perswaded, that this his\r\ngratious, humane, and courteous fredome of behauiour, being certanely\r\nacceptable befor God as well as men, was it that wanne him so much\r\nrenovne, and inabled him cheifly, in the loue of his followers, to\r\ngoe through so great interprysses, wheirin his equall had failled,\r\naltho they exceeded him farre in power, nor can any other reason\r\nbe giuen for it, but only this that followeth. He did not seeme\r\nto affect state, nor to claime reuerence, nor to keepe a distance\r\nwith gentlemen that ware not his domestickes; but rather in a noble\r\nyet courteouse way he seemed to slight those vanisheing smockes of\r\ngreatnes, affecting rather the reall possession of mens heartes\r\nthen the frothie and outward showe of reuerence; and therefor was\r\nall reuerence thrust vpon him, because all did loue him, therfor\r\nall did honour him and reuerence him, yea, haueing once acquired\r\nthere heartes, they ware readie not only to honour him, but to\r\nquarrell with any that would not honour him, and would not spare\r\nthere fortounes, nor there derrest blood about there heartes, to the\r\nend he might be honoured, because they saue that he tooke the right\r\ncourse to obtaine honour. He had fund furth the right way to be\r\nreuerenced, and thereby was approued that propheticke maxime which\r\nhath never failed, nor neuer shall faille, being pronounced by the\r\nFontaine of treuth (_He that exalteth himselfe shall be humbled_);\r\nfor his winneing behauiour and courteous caryage got him more respect\r\nthen those to whom they ware bound both by the law of nature and by\r\ngood reason to hawe giuen it to. Nor could any other reason be giuen\r\nfor it, but only there to much keepeing of distance, and caryeing\r\nthemselfes in a more statlye and reserued way, without putteing a\r\ndifference betuixt a free borne gentleman and a seruille or base\r\nmynded slaue.\r\n\r\n“This much I thought good by the way to signifie; for the best and\r\nmost waliant generall that euer lead ane armie if he mistake the\r\ndisposition of the nation whom he commandes, and will not descend a\r\nlitle till he meete with the genious of his shouldiours, on whose\r\nfolloweing his grandour and the success of his interpryses chiefely\r\ndependeth, stryueing through a high soireing and ower winneing\r\nambition to drawe them to his byas with awe and not with lowe, that\r\nleader, I say, shall neuer prewaill against his enemies with ane\r\narmie of the Scotes nation.”\r\n\r\nMontrose had, about this time, received a commission from the\r\nTables--as the boards of representatives, chosen respectively by the\r\nnobility, county gentry, clergy, and inhabitants of the burghs,\r\nwere called--to raise a body of troops for the service of the\r\nCovenanters, and he now proceeded to embody them with extraordinary\r\npromptitude. Within one month, he collected a force of about 3,000\r\nhorse and foot, from the counties of Fife, Forfar, and Perth, and\r\nput them into a complete state of military discipline. Being joined\r\nby the forces under General Leslie, he marched upon Aberdeen, which\r\nhe entered, without opposition, on the 30th of March, the Marquis\r\nof Huntly having abandoned the town on his approach. Some idea\r\nof the well-appointed state of this army may be formed from the\r\ncurious description of Spalding, who says, that “upon the morne,\r\nbeing Saturday, they came in order of battell, weill armed, both on\r\nhorse and foot, ilk horseman having five shot at the least, with ane\r\ncarabine in his hand, two pistols by his sydes, and other two at his\r\nsaddell toir; the pikemen in their ranks, with pike and sword; the\r\nmusketiers in their ranks, with musket, musket-staffe, bandelier,\r\nsword, powder, ball, and match; ilk company, both on horse and foot,\r\nhad their captains, lieutenants, ensignes, serjeants, and other\r\nofficers and commanders, all for the most part in buff coats, and\r\nin goodly order. They had five colours or ensignes, whereof the\r\nEarl of Montrose had one, haveing this motto: ‘FOR RELIGION, THE\r\nCOVENANT, AND THE COUNTRIE;’ the Earle of Marischall had one, the\r\nEarle of Kinghorne had one, and the town of Dundie had two. They had\r\ntrumpeters to ilk company of horsemen, and drummers to ilk company\r\nof footmen; they had their meat, drink, and other provision, bag and\r\nbaggage, carryed with them, all done be advyse of his excellence\r\nFelt Marschall Leslie, whose councell Generall Montrose followed\r\nin this busieness. Now, in seemly order and good array, this army\r\ncame forward, and entered the burgh of Aberdein, about ten hours in\r\nthe morning, at the Over Kirkgate Port, syne came doun throw the\r\nBroadgate, throw the Castlegate, out at the Justice Port to the\r\nQueen’s Links directly. Here it is to be notted that few or none of\r\nthis hail army wanted ane blew ribbin hung about his craig, doun\r\nunder his left arme, which they called the _Covenanters’ Ribbin_.\r\nBut the Lord Gordon, and some other of the marquess’ bairnes and\r\nfamilie, had ane ribbin when he was dwelling in the toun, of ane\r\nreid flesh cullor, which they wore in their hatts, and called it\r\n_The Royall Ribbin_, as a signe of their love and loyalltie to the\r\nking. In despyte and derision thereof this blew ribbin was worne, and\r\ncalled the _Covenanters’ Ribbin_, be the hail souldiers of the army,\r\nand would not hear of the royall ribbin; such was their pryde and\r\nmalice.”[234]\r\n\r\nAt Aberdeen Montrose was joined the same day by Lord Fraser, the\r\nMaster of Forbes, the laird of Dalgettie, the tutor of Pitsligo,\r\nthe Earl Marshal’s men in Buchan, with several other gentlemen and\r\ntheir tenants, dependants, and servants, to the number of 2,000,\r\nan addition which augmented Montrose’s army to 9,000 men. Leaving\r\nthe Earl of Kinghorn with 1,500 men to keep possession of Aberdeen,\r\nMontrose marched the same day towards Kintore, where he encamped that\r\nnight. Halting all Sunday, he proceeded on the Monday to Inverury,\r\nwhere he again pitched his camp. The Marquis of Huntly grew alarmed\r\nat this sudden and unexpected movement, and thought it now time\r\nto treat with such a formidable foe for his personal safety. He,\r\ntherefore, despatched Robert Gordon of Straloch and Doctor Gordon,\r\nan Aberdeen physician, to Montrose’s camp, to request an interview.\r\nThe marquis proposed to meet him on a moor near Blackhall, about\r\ntwo miles from the camp, with 11 attendants each, with no arms but\r\na single sword at their side. After consulting with Field Marshal\r\nLeslie and the other officers, Montrose agreed to meet the marquis,\r\non Thursday the 4th of April, at the place mentioned. The parties\r\naccordingly met. Among the eleven who attended the marquis were his\r\nson James, Lord Aboyne, and the Lord Oliphant. Lords Elcho and Cowper\r\nwere of the party who attended Montrose. After the usual salutation\r\nthey both alighted and entered into conversation; but, coming to\r\nno understanding, they adjourned the conference till the following\r\nmorning, when the marquis signed a paper obliging himself to maintain\r\nthe king’s authority, “the liberty of church and state, religion\r\nand laws.” He promised at the same time to do his best to make his\r\nfriends, tenants, and servants subscribe the Covenant.[235] The\r\nmarquis, after this arrangement, went to Strathbogie, and Montrose\r\nreturned with his army to Aberdeen, the following day.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had not been many days at Strathbogie, when he received\r\na notice from Montrose to repair to Aberdeen with his two sons, Lord\r\nGordon and Viscount Aboyne, for the ostensible purpose of assisting\r\nthe committee in their deliberations as to the settlement of the\r\ndisturbances in the north.[236] On Huntly receiving an assurance from\r\nMontrose and the other covenanting leaders that no attempt should be\r\nmade to detain himself and his sons as prisoners, he complied with\r\nMontrose’s invitation, and repairing to Aberdeen, he took up his\r\nquarters in the laird of Pitfoddel’s house.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of the marquis, which followed, has been attributed, not\r\nwithout reason, to the intrigues of the Frasers and the Forbeses, who\r\nbore a mortal antipathy to the house of Huntly, and who were desirous\r\nto see the “Cock of the North,” as the powerful head of that house\r\nwas popularly called, humbled.[237] But, be these conjectures as they\r\nmay, on the morning after the marquis’s arrival at Aberdeen, viz.,\r\non the 11th April, a council of the principal officers of Montrose’s\r\narmy was held, at which it was determined to arrest the marquis and\r\nLord Gordon, his eldest son, and carry them to Edinburgh. It was not,\r\nhowever, judged advisable to act upon this resolution immediately,\r\nand to do away with any appearance of treachery, Montrose and his\r\nfriends invited the marquis and his two sons to supper the following\r\nevening. During the entertainment the most friendly civilities were\r\npassed on both sides, and, after the party had become somewhat merry,\r\nMontrose and his friends hinted to the marquis the expediency, in\r\nthe present posture of affairs, of resigning his commission of\r\nlieutenancy. They also proposed that he should write a letter to the\r\nking along with the resignation of his commission, in favour of the\r\nCovenanters, as good and loyal subjects; and that he should despatch\r\nthe laird of Cluny, the following morning, with the letter and\r\nresignation. The marquis, seeing that his commission was altogether\r\nunavailable, immediately wrote out, in presence of the meeting, a\r\nresignation of it, and a letter of recommendation as proposed, and,\r\nin their presence, delivered the same to the laird of Cluny, who was\r\nto set off the following morning with them to the king. It would\r\nappear that Montrose was not sincere in making this demand upon the\r\nmarquis, and that his object was, by calculating on a refusal, to\r\nmake that the ground for arresting him; for the marquis had scarcely\r\nreturned to his lodgings to pass the night, when an armed guard was\r\nplaced round the house, to prevent him from returning home, as he\r\nintended to do, the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the marquis rose, next morning, he was surprised at receiving\r\na message from the covenanting general, desiring his attendance at\r\nthe house of the Earl Marshal; and he was still farther surprised,\r\nwhen, on going out, along with his two sons, to the appointed place\r\nof meeting, he found his lodging beset with sentinels. The marquis\r\nwas received by Montrose with the usual morning salutation, after\r\nwhich, he proceeded to demand from him a contribution for liquidating\r\na loan of 200,000 merks, which the Covenanters had borrowed from Sir\r\nWilliam Dick, a rich merchant of Edinburgh. To this unexpected demand\r\nthe marquis replied, that he was not obliged to pay any part thereof,\r\nnot having been concerned in the borrowing, and of course, declined\r\nto comply. Montrose then requested him to take steps to apprehend\r\nJames Grant and John Dugar, and their accomplices, who had given\r\nconsiderable annoyance to the Covenanters in the Highlands. Huntly\r\nobjected, that, having now no commission, he could not act, and\r\nthat, although he had, James Grant had already obtained a remission\r\nfrom the king; and as for John Dugar, he would concur, if required,\r\nwith the other neighbouring proprietors in an attempt to apprehend\r\nhim. The earl, finally, as the Covenant, he said, admitted of no\r\nstanding hatred or feud, required the marquis to reconcile himself to\r\nCrichton, the laird of Frendraught, but this the marquis positively\r\nrefused to do. Finding, as he no doubt expected, the marquis quite\r\nresolute in his determination to resist these demands, the earl\r\nsuddenly changed his tone, and thus addressed the marquis, apparently\r\nin the most friendly terms, “My lord, seeing we are all now friends,\r\nwill you go south to Edinburgh with us?” Huntly answered that he\r\nwould not--that he was not prepared for such a journey, and that he\r\nwas just going to set off for Strathbogie. “Your lordship,” rejoined\r\nMontrose, “will do well to go with us.” The marquis now perceiving\r\nMontrose’s design, accosted him thus, “My lord, I came here to this\r\ntown upon assurance that I should come and go at my own pleasure,\r\nwithout molestation or inquietude; and now I see why my lodging was\r\nguarded, and that ye mean to take me to Edinburgh, whether I will or\r\nnot. This conduct, on your part, seems to me to be neither fair nor\r\nhonourable.” He added, “My lord, give me back the bond which I gave\r\nyou at Inverury, and you shall have an answer.” Montrose thereupon\r\ndelivered the bond to the marquis. Huntly then inquired at the earl,\r\n“Whether he would take him to the south as a captive, or willingly of\r\nhis own mind?” “Make your choice,” said Montrose. “Then,” observed\r\nthe marquis, “I will not go as a captive, but as a volunteer.” The\r\nmarquis thereupon immediately returned to his lodging, and despatched\r\na messenger after the laird of Cluny, to stop him on his journey.[238]\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of Montrose to take both the marquis and his\r\nsons to Edinburgh, but Viscount Aboyne, at the desire of some of\r\nhis friends, was released, and allowed to return to Strathbogie. On\r\narriving at Edinburgh, the marquis and his son, Lord Gordon, were\r\ncommitted close prisoners to the castle of Edinburgh, and the Tables\r\n“appointed five guardians to attend upon him and his son night and\r\nday, upon his own expenses, that none should come in nor out but\r\nby their sight.”[239] On being solicited to sign the Covenant,\r\nHuntly issued a manifesto characterized by magnanimity and the most\r\nsteadfast loyalty, concluding with the following words:--“For my oune\r\npart, I am in your power; and resolved not to leave that foul title\r\nof traitor as ane inheritance upon my posteritye. Yow may tacke my\r\nheade from my shoulders, but not my heart from my soveraigne.”[240]\r\n\r\nSome time after the departure of Montrose’s army to the south, the\r\nCovenanters of the north appointed a committee meeting to be held at\r\nTurriff, upon Wednesday, 24th April, consisting of the Earls Marshal\r\nand Seaforth, Lord Fraser, the Master of Forbes, and some of their\r\nkindred and friends. All persons within the diocese, who had not\r\nsubscribed the Covenant, were required to attend this meeting for the\r\npurpose of signing it, and failing compliance, their property was to\r\nbe given up to indiscriminate plunder. As neither Lord Aboyne, the\r\nlaird of Banff, nor any of their friends and kinsmen, had subscribed\r\nthe Covenant, nor meant to do so, they resolved to protect themselves\r\nfrom the threatened attack. A preliminary meeting of the heads of\r\nthe northern Covenanters was held on the 22d of April, at Monymusk,\r\nwhere they learned of the rising of Lord Aboyne and his friends.\r\nThis intelligence induced them to postpone the meeting at Turriff\r\ntill the 26th of April, by which day they expected to be joined by\r\nseveral gentlemen from Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Moray, and other\r\nquarters. At another meeting, however, on the 24th of April, they\r\npostponed the proposed meeting at Turriff, _sine die_, and adjourned\r\nto Aberdeen; but as no notice had been sent of the postponement\r\nto the different covenanting districts in the north, about 1,500\r\nmen assembled at the place of meeting on the 26th of April, and\r\nwere quite astonished to find that the chiefs were absent. Upon an\r\nexplanation taking place, the meeting was adjourned till the 20th of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nLord Aboyne had not been idle during this interval, having collected\r\nabout 2,000 horse and foot from the Highlands and Lowlands, with\r\nwhich force he had narrowly watched the movements of the Covenanters.\r\nHearing, however, of the adjournment of the Turriff meeting, his\r\nlordship, at the entreaty of his friends, broke up his army, and\r\nwent by sea to England to meet the king, to inform him of the\r\nprecarious state of affairs in the north. Many of his followers, such\r\nas the lairds of Gight, Haddo, Udney, Newton, Pitmedden, Foveran,\r\nTippertie, Harthill, and others, who had subscribed the Covenant,\r\nregretted his departure; but as they had gone too far to recede, they\r\nresolved to continue their forces in the field, and held a meeting on\r\nthe 7th of May at Auchterless, to concert a plan of operations.\r\n\r\nA body of the Covenanters, to the number of about 2,000, having\r\nassembled at Turriff as early as the 13th of May, the Gordons\r\nresolved instantly to attack them, before they should be joined\r\nby other forces, which were expected to arrive before the 20th.\r\nTaking along with them four brass field-pieces from Strathbogie,\r\nthe Gordons, to the number of about 800 horse and foot, commenced\r\ntheir march on the 13th of May, at ten o’clock at night, and reached\r\nTurriff next morning by day-break, by a road unknown to the sentinels\r\nof the covenanting army. As soon as they approached the town, the\r\ncommander of the Gordons ordered the trumpets to be sounded and the\r\ndrums to be beat, the noise of which was the first indication the\r\nCovenanters had of their arrival. Being thus surprised, the latter\r\nhad no time to make any preparations for defending themselves. They\r\nmade, indeed, a short resistance, but were soon dispersed by the\r\nfire from the field-pieces, leaving behind them the lairds of Echt\r\nand Skene, and a few others, who were taken prisoners. The loss on\r\neither side, in killed and wounded, was very trifling. This skirmish\r\nis called by the writers of the period, “the Trott of Turray.”[241]\r\n\r\nThe successful issue of this trifling affair had a powerful effect\r\non the minds of the victors, who forthwith marched on Aberdeen,\r\nwhich they entered on the 15th of May. They expelled the Covenanters\r\nfrom the town, and were there joined by a body of men from the Braes\r\nof Mar under the command of Donald Farquharson of Tulliegarmouth,\r\nand the laird of Abergeldie, and by another party headed by James\r\nGrant, so long an outlaw, to the number of about 500 men. These men\r\nquartered themselves very freely upon the inhabitants, particularly\r\non those who had declared for the Covenant, and they plundered many\r\ngentlemen’s houses in the neighbourhood. The house of Durris,\r\nbelonging to John Forbes of Leslie, a great Covenanter, received\r\na visit from them. “There was,” says Spalding, “little plenishing\r\nleft unconveyed away before their comeing. They gott good bear and\r\nale, broke up girnells, and buke bannocks at good fyres, and drank\r\nmerrily upon the laird’s best drink: syne carried away with them\r\nalse meikle victual as they could beir, which they could not gett\r\neaten and destroyed; and syne removed from that to Echt, Skene,\r\nMonymusk, and other houses pertaining to the name of Forbes, all\r\ngreat Covenanters.”[242]\r\n\r\nTwo days after their arrival at Aberdeen, the Gordons sent to\r\nDunnottar, for the purpose of ascertaining the sentiments of the Earl\r\nMarshal, in relation to their proceedings, and whether they might\r\nreckon on his friendship. The earl, however, intimated that he could\r\nsay nothing in relation to the affair, and that he would require\r\neight days to advise with his friends. This answer was considered\r\nquite unsatisfactory, and the chiefs of the army were at a loss how\r\nto act. Robert Gordon of Straloch, and James Burnet of Craigmylle, a\r\nbrother of the laird of Leys, proposed to enter into a negotiation\r\nwith the Earl Marshal, but Sir George Ogilvie of Banff would not\r\nlisten to such a proceeding, and, addressing Straloch, he said, “Go,\r\nif you will go; but pr’ythee, let it be as quarter-master, to inform\r\nthe earl that we are coming.” Straloch, however, went not in the\r\ncharacter of a quarter-master, but as a mediator in behalf of his\r\nchief. The earl said he had no intention to take up arms, without\r\nan order from the Tables; that, if the Gordons would disperse, he\r\nwould give them early notice to re-assemble, if necessary, for their\r\nown defence, but that if they should attack him, he would certainly\r\ndefend himself.\r\n\r\nThe army was accordingly disbanded on the 21st of May, and the barons\r\nwent to Aberdeen, there to spend a few days. The depredations of the\r\nHighlanders, who had come down to the lowlands in quest of plunder,\r\nupon the properties of the Covenanters, were thereafter carried on\r\nto such an extent, that the latter complained to the Earl Marshal,\r\nwho immediately assembled a body of men out of Angus and the Mearns,\r\nwith which he entered Aberdeen on the 23d of May, causing the barons\r\nto make a precipitate retreat. Two days thereafter the earl was\r\njoined by Montrose, at the head of 4,000 men, an addition which, with\r\nother accessions, made the whole force assembled at Aberdeen exceed\r\n6,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a large body of northern Covenanters, under the command\r\nof the Earl of Seaforth, was approaching from the districts beyond\r\nthe Spey; but the Gordons having crossed the Spey for the purpose of\r\nopposing their advance, an agreement was entered into between both\r\nparties that, on the Gordons retiring across the Spey, Seaforth and\r\nhis men should also retire homewards.\r\n\r\nAfter spending five days in Aberdeen, Montrose marched his army\r\nto Udney, thence to Kellie, the seat of the laird of Haddo, and\r\nafterwards to Gight, the residence of Sir Robert Gordon, to which he\r\nlaid siege. But intelligence of the arrival of Viscount Aboyne in\r\nthe bay of Aberdeen, deranged his plans. Being quite uncertain of\r\nAboyne’s strength, and fearing that his retreat might be cut off,\r\nMontrose quickly raised the siege and returned to Aberdeen. Although\r\nLord Aboyne still remained on board his vessel, and could easily have\r\nbeen prevented from landing, Montrose most unaccountably abandoned\r\nthe town, and retired into the Mearns.\r\n\r\nViscount Aboyne had been most graciously received by the king, and\r\nhad ingratiated himself so much with the monarch, as to obtain the\r\ncommission of lieutenancy which his father held. The king appears to\r\nhave entertained good hopes from his endeavours to support the royal\r\ncause in the north of Scotland, and before taking leave he gave the\r\nviscount a letter addressed to the Marquis of Hamilton, requesting\r\nhim to afford his lordship all the assistance in his power. From\r\nwhatever cause, all the aid afforded by the Marquis was limited to\r\na few officers and four field-pieces: “The king,” says Gordon of\r\nSallagh, “coming to Berwick, and business growing to a height, the\r\narmies of England and Scotland lying near one another, his majesty\r\nsent the Viscount of Aboyne and Colonel Gun (who was then returned\r\nout of Germany) to the Marquis of Hamilton, to receive some forces\r\nfrom him, and with these forces to go to Aberdeen, to possess and\r\nrecover that town. The Marquis of Hamilton, lying at anchor in Forth,\r\ngave them no supply of men, but sent them five ships to Aberdeen,\r\nand the marquis himself retired with his fleet and men to the Holy\r\nIsland, hard by Berwick, to reinforce the king’s army there against\r\nthe Scots at Dunslaw.”[243] On his voyage to Aberdeen, Aboyne’s ships\r\nfell in with two vessels, one of which contained the lairds of Banff,\r\nFoveran, Newton, Crummie, and others, who had fled on the approach\r\nof Montrose to Gight; and the other had on board some citizens of\r\nAberdeen, and several ministers who had refused to sign the Covenant,\r\nall of whom the viscount persuaded to return home along with him.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June, Lord Aboyne, accompanied by the Earls of\r\nGlencairn and Tullibardine, the lairds of Drum, Banff, Fedderet,\r\nFoveran, and Newton, and their followers, with Colonel Gun and\r\nseveral English officers, landed in Aberdeen without opposition.\r\nImmediately on coming ashore, Aboyne issued a proclamation which\r\nwas read at the cross of Aberdeen, prohibiting all his majesty’s\r\nloyal subjects from paying any rents, duties, or other debts to the\r\nCovenanters, and requiring them to pay one-half of such sums to the\r\nking, and to retain the other for themselves. Those persons who had\r\nbeen forced to subscribe the Covenant against their will, were, on\r\nrepentance, to be forgiven, and every person was required to take an\r\noath of allegiance to his majesty.\r\n\r\nThis bold step inspired the royalists with confidence, and in a short\r\nspace of time a considerable force rallied round the royal standard.\r\nLewis Gordon, third son of the Marquis of Huntly, a youth of\r\nextraordinary courage, on hearing of his brother’s arrival, collected\r\nhis father’s friends and tenants, to the number of about 1,000 horse\r\nand foot, and with these he entered Aberdeen on the 7th of June.\r\nThese were succeeded by 100 horse, sent in by the laird of Drum, and\r\nby considerable forces led by James Grant and Donald Farquharson.\r\nMany of the Covenanters also joined the viscount, so that his\r\nforce ultimately amounted to several thousand men. Spalding[244]\r\ngives a sad, though somewhat ludicrous account of the way in which\r\nFarquharson’s “hieland men” conducted themselves while in Aberdeen.\r\nHe says, “Thir saulless lounis plunderit meit, drink, and scheip\r\nquhair ever they cam. Thay oppressit the Oldtoun, and brocht in out\r\nof the countrie honest menis scheip, and sold at the cross of Old\r\nAbirdein to sic as wold by, ane scheip upone foot for ane groat. The\r\npoor men that aucht thame follouit in and coft bak thair awin scheip\r\nagane, sic as wes left unslayne for thair meit.”\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June the viscount left Aberdeen, and advanced upon\r\nKintore with an army of about 2,000 horse and foot, to which he\r\nreceived daily accessions. The inhabitants of the latter place\r\nwere compelled by him to subscribe the oath of allegiance, and\r\nnotwithstanding their compliance, “the troops,” says Spalding,\r\n“plundered meat and drink, and made good fires: and, where they\r\nwanted peats, broke down beds and boards in honest men’s houses to\r\nbe fires, and fed their horses with corn and straw that day and\r\nnight.”[245] Next morning the army made a raid upon Hall Forrest, a\r\nseat of the Earl Marshal, and the house of Muchells, belonging to\r\nLord Fraser; but Aboyne, hearing of a rising in the south, returned\r\nto Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nAs delay would be dangerous to his cause in the present conjuncture,\r\nhe crossed the Dee on the 14th of June, his army amounting altogether\r\nprobably to about 3,000 horse and foot,[246] with the intention of\r\noccupying Stonehaven, and of issuing afresh the king’s proclamation\r\nat the market cross of that burgh. He proceeded as far as Muchollis,\r\nor Muchalls, the seat of Sir Thomas Burnet of Leyes, a Covenanter,\r\nwhere he encamped that night. On hearing of his approach, the Earl\r\nMarshal and Montrose posted themselves, with 1,200 men, and some\r\npieces of ordnance which they had drawn from Dunnottar castle, on the\r\ndirect road which Aboyne had to pass, and waited his approach.\r\n\r\nAlthough Aboyne was quite aware of the position of the Earl Marshal,\r\ninstead of endeavouring to outflank him by making a detour to the\r\nright, he, by Colonel Gun’s advice, crossed the Meagre hill next\r\nmorning, directly in the face of his opponent, who lay with his\r\nforces at the bottom of the hill. As Aboyne descended the hill, the\r\nEarl Marshal opened a heavy fire upon him, which threw his men into\r\ncomplete disorder. The Highlanders, unaccustomed to the fire of\r\ncannon, were the first to retreat, and in a short time the whole army\r\ngave way. Aboyne thereupon returned to Aberdeen with some horsemen,\r\nleaving the rest of the army to follow; but the Highlanders took\r\na homeward course, carrying along with them a large quantity of\r\nbooty, which they gathered on their retreat. The disastrous issue of\r\n“the Raid of Stonehaven,” as this affair has been called, has been\r\nattributed, with considerable plausibility, to treachery on the part\r\nof Colonel Gun, to whom, on account of his great experience, Aboyne\r\nhad intrusted the command of the army.[247]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Aberdeen, Aboyne held a council of war, at which it\r\nwas determined to send some persons into the Mearns to collect the\r\nscattered remains of his army, for, with the exception of about 180\r\nhorsemen and a few foot soldiers, the whole of the fine army which he\r\nhad led from Aberdeen had disappeared; but although the army again\r\nmustered at Leggetsden to the number of 4,000, they were prevented\r\nfrom recrossing the Dee and joining his lordship by the Marshal and\r\nMontrose, who advanced towards the bridge of Dee with all their\r\nforces. Aboyne, hearing of their approach, resolved to dispute with\r\nthem the passage of the Dee, and, as a precautionary measure, blocked\r\nup the entrance to the bridge of Dee from the south by a thick wall\r\nof turf, beside which he placed 100 musketeers upon the bridge, under\r\nthe command of Lieutenant-Colonel Johnstone, to annoy the assailants\r\nfrom the small turrets on its sides. The viscount was warmly seconded\r\nin his views by the citizens of Aberdeen, whose dread of another\r\nhostile visit from the Covenanters induced them to afford him every\r\nassistance in their power, and it is recorded that the women and\r\nchildren even occupied themselves in carrying provisions to the army\r\nduring the contest.\r\n\r\nThe army of Montrose consisted of about 2,000 foot and 300 horse,\r\nand a large train of artillery. The forces which Lord Aboyne had\r\ncollected on the spur of the occasion were not numerous, but he was\r\nsuperior in cavalry. His ordnance consisted only of four pieces\r\nof brass cannon. Montrose arrived at the bridge of Dee on the\r\n18th of June, and, without a moment’s delay, commenced a furious\r\ncannonade upon the works which had been thrown up at the south end,\r\nand which he kept up during the whole day without producing any\r\nmaterial effect. Lieutenant-colonel Johnstone defended the bridge\r\nwith determined bravery, and his musketeers kept up a galling and\r\nwell-directed fire upon their assailants. Both parties reposed\r\nduring the short twilight, and as soon as morning dawned Montrose\r\nrenewed his attack upon the bridge, with an ardour which seemed to\r\nhave received a fresh impulse from the unavailing efforts of the\r\npreceding day; but all his attempts were vain. Seeing no hopes of\r\ncarrying the bridge in the teeth of the force opposed to him, he had\r\nrecourse to a stratagem, by which he succeeded in withdrawing a part\r\nof Aboyne’s forces from the defence of the bridge. That force had,\r\nindeed, been considerably impaired before the renewal of the attack,\r\nin consequence of a party of 50 musketeers having gone to Aberdeen to\r\nescort thither the body of a citizen named John Forbes, who had been\r\nkilled the preceding day; to which circumstance Spalding attributes\r\nthe loss of the bridge; but whether the absence of this party had\r\nsuch an effect upon the fortune of the day is by no means clear. The\r\ncovenanting general, after battering unsuccessfully the defences of\r\nthe bridge, ordered a party of horsemen to proceed up the river some\r\ndistance, and to make a demonstration as if they intended to cross.\r\nAboyne was completely deceived by this manœuvre, and sent the whole\r\nof his horsemen from the bridge to dispute the passage of the river\r\nwith those of Montrose, leaving Lieutenant-colonel Johnstone and\r\nhis 50 musketeers alone to protect the bridge. Montrose having thus\r\ndrawn his opponent into the snare set for him, immediately sent\r\nback the greater part of his horse, under the command of Captain\r\nMiddleton, with instructions to renew the attack upon the bridge with\r\nredoubled energy. This officer lost no time in obeying these orders,\r\nand Lieutenant-colonel Johnstone having been wounded in the outset\r\nby a stone torn from the bridge by a shot, was forced to abandon its\r\ndefence, and he and his party retired precipitately to Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nWhen Aboyne saw the colours of the Covenanters flying on the bridge\r\nof Dee, he fled with great haste towards Strathbogie, after releasing\r\nthe lairds of Purie Ogilvy and Purie Fodderinghame, whom he had taken\r\nprisoners, and carried with him from Aberdeen. The loss on either\r\nside during the conflict on the bridge was trifling. The only person\r\nof note who fell on Aboyne’s side was Seaton of Pitmedden, a brave\r\ncavalier, who was killed by a cannon shot while riding along the\r\nriver side with Lord Aboyne. On that of the Covenanters was slain\r\nanother valiant gentleman, a brother of Ramsay of Balmain. About 14\r\npersons of inferior note were killed on each side, including some\r\nburgesses of Aberdeen, and several were wounded.\r\n\r\nMontrose, reaching the north bank of the Dee, proceeded immediately\r\nto Aberdeen, which he entered without opposition. So exasperated were\r\nMontrose’s followers at the repeated instances of devotedness shown\r\nby the inhabitants to the royal cause, that they proposed to raze the\r\ntown and set it on fire; but they were hindered from carrying their\r\ndesign into execution by the firmness of Montrose. The Covenanters,\r\nhowever, treated the inhabitants very harshly, and imprisoned many\r\nwho were suspected of having been concerned in opposing their\r\npassage across the Dee; but an end was put to these proceedings in\r\nconsequence of intelligence being brought on the following day (June\r\n20th) of the treaty of pacification which had been entered into\r\nbetween the king and his subjects at Berwick, upon the 18th of that\r\nmonth. On receipt of this news, Montrose sent a despatch to the Earl\r\nof Seaforth, who was stationed with his army on the Spey, intimating\r\nthe pacification, and desiring him to disband his army, with which\r\norder he instantly complied.\r\n\r\nThe articles of pacification were preceded by a declaration on the\r\npart of the king, in which he stated, that although he could not\r\ncondescend to ratify and approve of the acts of the Glasgow General\r\nAssembly, yet, notwithstanding the many disorders which had of late\r\nbeen committed, he not only confirmed and made good whatsoever his\r\ncommissioner had granted and promised, but he also declared that\r\nall matters ecclesiastical should be determined by the assemblies\r\nof the kirk, and matters civil by the parliament and other inferior\r\njudicatories established by law. To settle, therefore, “the general\r\ndistractions” of the kingdom, his majesty ordered that a free general\r\nassembly should be held at Edinburgh on the 6th August following,\r\nat which he declared his intention, “God willing, to be personally\r\npresent;” and he moreover ordered a parliament to meet at Edinburgh\r\non the 20th of the same month, for ratifying the proceedings of the\r\ngeneral assembly, and settling such other matters as might conduce\r\nto the peace and good of the kingdom of Scotland. By the articles\r\nof pacification, it was, _inter alia_, provided that the forces in\r\nScotland should be disbanded within forty-eight hours after the\r\npublication of the declaration, and that all the royal castles,\r\nforts, and warlike stores of every description, should be delivered\r\nup to his majesty after the said publication, as soon as he should\r\nsend to receive them. Under the seventh and last article of the\r\ntreaty, the Marquis of Huntly and his son, Lord Gordon, and some\r\nothers who had been detained prisoners in the castle of Edinburgh by\r\nthe Covenanters, were set at liberty.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally supposed that neither party had any sincere\r\nintention to observe the conditions of the treaty. Certain it is,\r\nthat the ink with which it was written was scarcely dry before\r\nits violation was contemplated. On the one hand, the king, before\r\nremoving his army from the neighbourhood of Berwick, required the\r\nheads of the Covenanters to attend him there, obviously with the\r\nobject of gaining them over to his side; but, with the exception\r\nof three commoners and three lords, Montrose, Loudon, and Lothian,\r\nthey refused to obey. It was at this conference that Charles,\r\nwho apparently had great persuasive powers, made a convert of\r\nMontrose, who from that time determined to desert his associates\r\nin arms, and to place himself under the royal standard. The\r\nimmediate strengthening of the forts of Berwick and Carlisle, and\r\nthe provisioning of the castle of Edinburgh, were probably the\r\nsuggestions of Montrose, who would, of course, be intrusted with the\r\nsecret of his majesty’s designs. The Covenanters, on the other hand,\r\nalthough making a show of disbanding their army at Dunse, in reality\r\nkept a considerable force on foot, which they quartered in different\r\nparts of the country, to be in readiness for the field on a short\r\nnotice. The suspicious conduct of the king certainly justified this\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly met on the day fixed upon, but, instead of\r\nattending in person as he proposed, Charles appointed the Earl of\r\nTraquair to act as his commissioner. After abolishing the articles\r\nof Perth, the book of canons, the liturgy, the high commission\r\nand episcopacy, and ratifying the late Covenant, the assembly was\r\ndissolved on the 30th of August, and another general assembly\r\nwas appointed to be held at Aberdeen on the 28th of July of the\r\nfollowing year, 1640. The parliament met next day, viz., on the\r\nlast day of August, and as there were no bishops to represent the\r\nthird estate, fourteen minor barons were elected in their stead.\r\nHis majesty’s commissioner protested against the vote and against\r\nfarther proceedings till the king’s mind should be known, and the\r\ncommissioner immediately sent off a letter apprising him of the\r\noccurrence. Without waiting for the king’s answer, the parliament\r\nwas proceeding with a variety of bills for securing the liberty\r\nof the subject and restraining the royal prerogative, when it was\r\nunexpectedly and suddenly prorogued, by an order from the king, till\r\nthe 2d of June in the following year.\r\n\r\nIf Charles had not already made up his mind for war with his Scottish\r\nsubjects, the conduct of the parliament which he had just prorogued\r\ndetermined him again to have recourse to arms in vindication of his\r\nprerogative. He endeavoured, at first, to enlist the sympathies of\r\nthe bulk of the English nation in his cause, but without effect;\r\nand his repeated appeals to his English people, setting forth the\r\nrectitude of his intentions and the justice of his cause, being\r\nanswered by men who questioned the one and denied the other, rather\r\ninjured than served him. The people of England were not then in a\r\nmood to embark in a crusade against the civil and religious liberties\r\nof the north; and they had too much experience of the arbitrary\r\nspirit of the king to imagine that their own liberties would be\r\nbetter secured by extinguishing the flame which burned in the breasts\r\nof the sturdy and enthusiastic Covenanters.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the many discouraging circumstances which\r\nsurrounded him, Charles displayed a firmness of resolution to coerce\r\nthe rebellious Scots by every means within his reach. The spring and\r\npart of the summer of 1640 were spent by both parties in military\r\npreparations. Field-Marshal Sir Alexander Leslie of Balgony, an\r\nold and experienced officer who had been in foreign service, was\r\nappointed generalissimo of the Scots army by the war committee. When\r\nmustered by the general at Choicelee, it amounted to about 22,000\r\nfoot and 2,500 horse. A council of war was held at Dunse at which\r\nit was determined to invade England. Montrose, to whose command a\r\ndivision of the army, consisting of 2,000 foot and 500 horse, was\r\nintrusted, was absent when this meeting was held; but, although his\r\nsentiments had, by this time, undergone a complete change, seeing on\r\nhis return no chance of preventing the resolution of the council, he\r\ndissembled his feelings and openly approved of the plan. There seems\r\nto be no doubt that in following this course he intended, on the\r\nfirst favourable opportunity, to declare for the king, and carry off\r\nsuch part of the army as should be inclined to follow him, which he\r\nreckoned at a third of the whole.[248]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Argyle was commissioned by the Committee of Estates to\r\nsecure the west and central Highlands. This, the eighth Earl and\r\nfirst Marquis of Argyle, had succeeded to the title only in 1638,\r\nalthough he had enjoyed the estates for many years before that, as\r\nhis father had been living in Spain, an outlaw. He was born in 1598,\r\nand strictly educated in the protestant faith as established in\r\nScotland at the Reformation. In 1626 he was made a privy councillor,\r\nand in 1634 appointed one of the extraordinary lords of session. In\r\n1638, at the General Assembly of Glasgow, he openly went over to the\r\nside of the Covenanters, and from that time was recognised as their\r\npolitical head. Argyle, in executing the task intrusted to him by\r\nthe committee, appears to have been actuated more by feelings of\r\nprivate revenge than by an honest desire to carry out the spirit of\r\nhis commission. The ostensible reason for his undertaking this charge\r\nwas his thorough acquaintance with the Highlands and the Highlanders,\r\nand his ability to command the services of a large following of his\r\nown. “But the cheefe cause,” according to Gordon of Rothiemay,[249]\r\n“though least mentioned, was Argylle, his spleene that he carryed\r\nupon the accompt of former disobleedgments betwixt his family and\r\nsome of the Highland clans: therefore he was glade now to gett so\r\nfaire a colour of revenge upon the publicke score, which he did not\r\nlett slippe. Another reasone he had besyde; it was his designe to\r\nswallow upp Badzenoch and Lochaber, and some landes belonging to the\r\nMackdonalds, a numerous trybe, but haters of, and aeqwally hated\r\nby Argylle.” He had some hold on these two districts, as, in 1639,\r\nhe had become security for some of Huntly’s debts to the latter’s\r\ncreditors. Argyle managed to seduce from their allegiance to Huntly\r\nthe clan Cameron in Lochaber, who bore a strong resentment against\r\ntheir proper chief on account of some supposed injury done to the\r\nclan by the former marquis. Although they had little relish for the\r\nCovenant, still to gratify their revenge, they joined themselves\r\nto Argyle. A tribe of the Macdonalds who inhabited Lochaber, the\r\nMacranalds of Keppoch, who remained faithful to Huntly, met with very\r\ndifferent treatment at the hands of Argyle, who devastated their\r\ndistrict and burnt down their chief’s dwelling at Keppoch.\r\n\r\nDuring this same summer (July 1640), Argyle, who had raised an army\r\nof about 5,000 men, made a devastating raid into the district of\r\nForfarshire belonging to the Earl of Airly. He made first for Airly\r\ncastle, about five miles north of Meigle, which, in the absence\r\nof the earl in England, was held by his son Lord Ogilvie, who had\r\nrecently maintained it against Montrose. When Argyle came up, Ogilvie\r\nsaw that resistance was hopeless, and abandoned the castle to the\r\ntender mercy of the enemy. Argyle without scruple razed the place to\r\nthe ground, and is said to have shown himself so “extremely earnest”\r\nin the work of demolition “that he was seen taking a hammer in his\r\nhande and knocking down the hewed work of the doors and windows till\r\nhe did sweat for heat at his work.”[250] Argyle’s men carried off all\r\nthey could from the house and the surrounding district, and rendered\r\nuseless what they were compelled to leave behind.\r\n\r\nFrom Airly, Argyle proceeded to a seat belonging to Lord Ogilvie,\r\nForthar in Glenisla, the “bonnie house o’ Airly,” of the well-known\r\nsong. Here he behaved in a manner for which it would be difficult\r\nfor his warmest supporters to find the shadow of an excuse, even\r\ntaking into consideration the roughness of the times. The place is\r\nsaid by Gordon to have been “no strength,” so that there is still\r\nless excuse for his conduct. He treated Forthar in the same way that\r\nhe did Airly, and although Lady Ogilvie, who at the time was close\r\non her confinement, asked Argyle to stay proceedings until she gave\r\nbirth to her infant, he without scruple expelled her from the house,\r\nand proceeded with his work of destruction. Not only so, however,\r\nbut “the Lady Drum, Dame Marian Douglas, who lived at that time in\r\nKelly, hearing tell what extremity her grandchild, the Lady Ogilvy,\r\nwas reduced to, did send a commission to Argyle, to whom the said\r\nLady Drum was a kinswoman, requesting that, with his license, she\r\nmight admit into her own house, her grandchild, the Lady Ogilvy, who\r\nat that time was near her delivery; but Argyle would give no license.\r\nThis occasioned the Lady Drum for to fetch the Lady Ogilvie to her\r\nhouse of Kelly, and for to keep her there upon all hazard that might\r\nfollow.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time Argyle “was not forgetful to remember old quarrels\r\nto Sir John Ogilvie of Craigie.” He sent a sergeant to Ogilvie’s\r\nhouse to warn him to leave it, but the sergeant thought Argyle\r\nmust have made some mistake, as he found it no more than a simple\r\nunfortified country house, occupied only by a sick gentlewoman and\r\nsome servants. The sergeant returned and told this to Argyle, who\r\nwaxed wroth and told him it was his duty simply to obey orders,\r\ncommanding him at the same time to return and “deface and spoil\r\nthe house.” After the sergeant had received his orders, Argyle was\r\nobserved to turn round and repeat to himself the Latin political\r\nmaxim _Abscindantur qui nos perturbant_, “a maxime which many thought\r\nthat he practised accurately, which he did upon the account of the\r\nproverb consequential thereunto, and which is the reason of the\r\nformer, which Argyle was remarked likewise to have often in his mouth\r\nas a choice aphorism, and well observed by statesmen, _Quod mortui\r\nnon mordent_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Marquis of Argyle.]\r\n\r\nArgyle next proceeded against the Earl of Athole, who, with about\r\n1,200 followers, was lying in Breadalbane, ready to meet him. Argyle,\r\nwhose army was about five times the size of Athole’s, instead of\r\ngiving fight, managed by stratagem to capture Athole and some of his\r\nfriends, whom he sent to the Committee of Estates at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nArgyle, after having thus gratified his private revenge and made a\r\nshow of quieting the Highlands, returned to the lowlands.[251]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of August General Leslie crossed the Tweed with his army,\r\nthe van of which was led by Montrose on foot. This task, though\r\nperformed with readiness and with every appearance of good will, was\r\nnot voluntarily undertaken, but had been devolved upon Montrose by\r\nlot; none of the principal officers daring to take the lead of their\r\nown accord in such a dangerous enterprise. There can be no doubt\r\nthat Montrose was insincere in his professions, and that those who\r\nsuspected him were right in thinking that in his heart he was turned\r\nRoyalist,[252] a supposition which his correspondence with the king\r\nand his subsequent conduct fully justify.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proper time had not arrived for throwing off the mask,\r\nMontrose immediately on his return to Scotland, after the close\r\nof this campaign, began to concert measures for counteracting the\r\ndesigns of the Covenanters; but his plans were embarrassed by some\r\nof his associates disclosing to the Covenanters the existence of an\r\nassociation which Montrose had formed at Cumbernauld for supporting\r\nthe royal authority. A great outcry was raised against Montrose\r\nin consequence, but his influence was so great that the heads of\r\nthe Covenanters were afraid to show any severity towards him. On\r\nsubsequently discovering, however, that the king had written him\r\nletters which were intercepted and forcibly taken from the messenger,\r\na servant of the Earl of Traquair, they apprehended him, along with\r\nLord Napier of Merchiston, and Sir George Stirling of Keith, his\r\nrelatives and intimate friends, and imprisoned them in the castle of\r\nEdinburgh. On the meeting of the parliament at Edinburgh in July,\r\n1641, which was attended by the king in person, Montrose demanded\r\nto be tried before them, but his application was rejected by the\r\nCovenanters, who obtained an order from the parliament prohibiting\r\nhim from going into the king’s presence. After the king had returned\r\nto England, Montrose and his fellow-prisoners were liberated, and\r\nhe, thereupon, went to his own castle, where he remained for some\r\ntime, ruminating on the course he should pursue for the relief of the\r\nking. The king, while in Scotland at this time, conferred honours\r\nupon several of the covenanting leaders, apparently for the purpose\r\nof conciliation, Argyle being raised to the dignity of a marquis.\r\n\r\nAlthough Charles complied with the demands of his Scottish subjects,\r\nand heaped many favours and distinctions upon the heads of the\r\nleading Covenanters, they were by no means satisfied, and entered\r\nfully into the hostile views of their brethren in the south, with\r\nwhom they made common cause. Having resolved to send an army into\r\nEngland to join the forces of the parliament, which had come to an\r\nopen rupture with the sovereign, they attempted to gain over Montrose\r\nto their side by offering him the post of lieutenant-general of\r\ntheir army, and promising to accede to any demands he might make;\r\nbut he rejected all their offers; and, as an important crisis was at\r\nhand, he hastened to England in the early part of the year 1643, in\r\ncompany with Lord Ogilvie, to lay the state of affairs before the\r\nking, and to offer him his advice and service in such an emergency.\r\nCharles, however, either from a want of confidence in the judgment of\r\nMontrose, who, to the rashness and impetuosity of youth, added, as\r\nhe was led to believe, a desire of gratifying his personal feelings\r\nand vanity, or overcome by the calculating but fatal policy of the\r\nMarquis of Hamilton, who deprecated a fresh war between the king and\r\nhis Scottish subjects, declined to follow the advice of Montrose, who\r\nhad offered to raise an army immediately in Scotland to support him.\r\n\r\nA convention of estates called by the Covenanters, without any\r\nauthority from the king, met at Edinburgh on the 22d of June, 1643,\r\nand he soon perceived from the character and proceedings of this\r\nassembly, the great majority of which were Covenanters, the mistake\r\nhe had committed in rejecting the advice of Montrose, and he now\r\nresolved, thenceforth, to be guided in his plans for subduing\r\nScotland by the opinion of that nobleman. Accordingly, at a meeting\r\nheld at Oxford, between the king and Montrose, in the month of\r\nDecember, 1643, when the Scots army was about entering England, it\r\nwas agreed that the Earl of Antrim, an Irish nobleman of great power\r\nand influence, who then lived at Oxford, should be sent to Ireland\r\nto raise auxiliaries with whom he should make a descent on the west\r\nparts of Scotland in the month of April following;--that the Marquis\r\nof Newcastle, who commanded the royal forces in the north of England,\r\nshould furnish Montrose with a party of horse, with which he should\r\nenter the south of Scotland,--that an application should be made\r\nto the King of Denmark for some troops of German horse; and that a\r\nquantity of arms should be transported into Scotland from abroad.[253]\r\n\r\nInstructions having been given to the Earl of Antrim to raise the\r\nIrish levy, and Sir James Cochran having been despatched to the\r\ncontinent as ambassador for the king, to procure foreign aid,\r\nMontrose left Oxford on his way to Scotland, taking York and Durham\r\nin his route. Near the latter city he had an interview with the\r\nMarquis of Newcastle for the purpose of obtaining a sufficient party\r\nof horse to escort him into Scotland, but all he could procure\r\nwas about 100 horse, badly appointed, with two small brass field\r\npieces.[254] The Marquis sent orders to the king’s officers, and to\r\nthe captains of the militia in Cumberland and Westmoreland, to afford\r\nMontrose such assistance as they could, and he was in consequence\r\njoined on his way to Carlisle by 800 foot and three troops of horse,\r\nof Cumberland and Northumberland militia. With this small force, and\r\nabout 200 horse, consisting of noblemen and gentlemen who had served\r\nas officers in Germany, France, or England, Montrose entered Scotland\r\non the 13th of April, 1644. He had not, however, proceeded far,\r\nwhen a revolt broke out among the English soldiers, who immediately\r\nreturned to England. In spite of this discouragement, Montrose\r\nproceeded on with his small party of horse towards Dumfries, which\r\nsurrendered to him without opposition. After waiting there a few\r\ndays, in expectation of hearing some tidings respecting the Earl of\r\nAntrim’s movements, without receiving any, he retired to Carlisle,\r\nto avoid being surprised by the Covenanters, large bodies of whom\r\nwere hovering about in all directions.\r\n\r\nTo aid the views of Montrose, the king had appointed the Marquis of\r\nHuntly, on whose fidelity he could rely, his lieutenant-general in\r\nthe north of Scotland. He, on hearing of the capture of Dumfries by\r\nMontrose, immediately collected a considerable body of horse and\r\nfoot, consisting of Highlanders and lowlanders, at Kincardine-O’Neil,\r\nwith the intention of crossing the Cairn-a-Mount; but being\r\ndisappointed in not being joined by some forces from Perthshire,\r\nAngus, and the Mearns, which he expected, he altered his steps, and\r\nproceeded towards Aberdeen, which he took. Thence he despatched\r\nparties of his troops through the counties of Aberdeen and Banff,\r\nwhich brought in quantities of horses and arms for the use of his\r\narmy. One party, consisting of 120 horse and 300 foot, commanded\r\nby the young laird of Drum and his brother, young Gicht, Colonel\r\nNathaniel Gordon and Colonel Donald Farquharson and others, proceeded\r\nto the town of Montrose, which they took, killed one of the bailies,\r\nmade the provost prisoner, and threw some cannon into the sea as\r\nthey could not carry them away. But, on hearing that the Earl of\r\nKinghorn was advancing upon them with the forces of Angus, they made\r\na speedy retreat, leaving thirty of their foot behind them prisoners.\r\nTo protect themselves against the army of the Marquis of Huntly, the\r\ninhabitants of Moray, on the north of the Spey, raised a regiment of\r\nfoot and three companies of horse, which were quartered in the town\r\nof Elgin.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention heard of Huntly’s movements, they appointed the\r\nMarquis of Argyle to raise an army to quell this insurrection. He,\r\naccordingly, assembled at Perth a force of 5,000 foot and 800 horse\r\nout of Fife, Angus, Mearns, Argyle, and Perthshire, with which he\r\nadvanced on Aberdeen. Huntly, hearing of his approach, fled from\r\nAberdeen and retired to the town of Banff, where, on the day of\r\nhis arrival, he disbanded his army. The marquis himself thereafter\r\nretired to Strathnaver, and took up his residence with the master\r\nof Reay. Argyle, after taking possession of Aberdeen, proceeded\r\nnorthward and took the castles of Gicht and Kellie, made the lairds\r\nof Gicht and Haddo prisoners and sent them to Edinburgh, the latter\r\nbeing, along with one Captain Logan, afterwards beheaded.[255]\r\n\r\nWe now return to Montrose, who, after an ineffectual attempt to\r\nobtain an accession of force from the army of Prince Rupert, Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine, determined on again entering Scotland with\r\nhis little band. But being desirous to learn the exact situation of\r\naffairs there, before putting this resolution into effect, he sent\r\nLord Ogilvie and Sir William Rollock into Scotland, in disguise,\r\nfor that purpose. They returned in about fourteen days, and brought\r\na spiritless and melancholy account of the state of matters in\r\nthe north, where they found all the passes, towns, and forts, in\r\npossession of the Covenanters, and where no man dared to speak in\r\nfavour of the king. This intelligence was received with dismay by\r\nMontrose’s followers, who now began to think of the best means of\r\nsecuring their own safety. In this unpleasant conjuncture of affairs,\r\nMontrose called them together to consult on the line of conduct\r\nthey should pursue. Some advised him to return to Oxford and inform\r\nhis majesty of the hopeless state of his affairs in Scotland, while\r\nothers gave an opinion that he should resign his commission, and go\r\nabroad till a more favourable opportunity occurred of serving the\r\nking; but the chivalrous and undaunted spirit of Montrose disdained\r\nto follow either of these courses, and he resolved upon the desperate\r\nexpedient of venturing into the very heart of Scotland, with only\r\none or two companions, in the hope of being able to rally round his\r\nperson a force sufficient to support the declining interests of his\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated this intention privately to Lord Ogilvie, he\r\nput under his charge the few gentlemen who had remained faithful to\r\nhim, that he might conduct them to the king; and having accompanied\r\nthem to a distance, he withdrew from them clandestinely, leaving his\r\nservants, horses, and baggage behind him, and returned to Carlisle.\r\nHaving prepared himself for his journey, he selected Sir William\r\nRollock, a gentleman of tried honour, and one Sibbald, to accompany\r\nhim. Disguised as a groom, and riding upon a lean, worn-out horse,\r\nand leading another in his hand, Montrose passed for Sibbald’s\r\nservant, in which condition and capacity he proceeded to the borders.\r\nThe party had not proceeded far when an occurrence took place, which\r\nconsiderably disconcerted them. Meeting with a Scottish soldier,\r\nwho had served under the Marquis of Newcastle in England, he, after\r\npassing Rollock and Sibbald, went up to the marquis, and accosted him\r\nby his name. Montrose told him that he was quite mistaken; but the\r\nsoldier being positive, and judging that the marquis was concerned in\r\nsome important affair, replied, with a countenance which betokened a\r\nkind heart, “Do not I know my lord Marquis of Montrose well enough?\r\nBut go your way, and God be with you.”[256] When Montrose saw that\r\nhe could not preserve an incognito from the penetrating eye of the\r\nsoldier, he gave him some money and dismissed him.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence excited alarm in the mind of Montrose, and made him\r\naccelerate his journey. Within four days he arrived at the house of\r\nTullibelton, among the hills near the Tay, which belonged to Patrick\r\nGraham of Inchbrakie, his cousin, and a royalist. No situation\r\nwas better fitted for concocting his plans, and for communicating\r\nwith those clans and the gentry of the adjoining lowlands who\r\nstood well affected to the king. It formed, in fact, a centre, or\r\n_point d’appui_ to the royalists of the Highlands and the adjoining\r\nlowlands, from which a pretty regular communication could be kept up,\r\nwithout any of those dangers which would have arisen in the lowlands.\r\n\r\nFor some days Montrose did not venture to appear among the people\r\nin the neighbourhood, nor did he consider himself safe even in\r\nTullibelton house, but passed the night in an obscure cottage, and\r\nin the day-time wandered alone among the neighbouring mountains,\r\nruminating over the strange peculiarity of his situation, and waiting\r\nthe return of his fellow-travellers, whom he had despatched to\r\ncollect intelligence on the state of the kingdom. These messengers\r\ncame back to him after some days’ absence, bringing with them the\r\nmost cheerless accounts of the situation of the country, and of\r\nthe persecutions which the royalists suffered at the hands of the\r\nCovenanters. Among other distressing pieces of intelligence, they\r\ncommunicated to Montrose the premature and unsuccessful attempt\r\nof the Marquis of Huntly in favour of the royal cause, and of his\r\nretreat to Strathnaver to avoid the fury of his enemies. These\r\naccounts greatly affected Montrose, who was grieved to find that\r\nthe Gordons, who were stern royalists, should be exposed, by the\r\nabandonment of their chief, to the revenge of their enemies; but he\r\nconsoled himself with the reflection, that as soon as he should be\r\nenabled to unfurl the royal standard, the tide of fortune would turn.\r\n\r\nWhile cogitating on the course he should pursue in this conjuncture,\r\na report reached him from some shepherds on the hills that a body of\r\nIrish troops had landed in the West, and was advancing through the\r\nHighlands. Montrose at once concluded that these were the auxiliaries\r\nwhom the Earl of Antrim had undertaken to send him four months\r\nbefore, and such they proved to be. This force, which amounted to\r\n1,500 men, was under the command of Alexander Macdonald, son of Coll\r\nMac-Gillespic Macdonald of Iona, who had been greatly persecuted by\r\nthe family of Argyle. Macdonald had arrived early in July, 1644,\r\namong the Hebrides, and had landed and taken the castles of Meigray\r\nand Kinloch Alan. He had then disembarked his forces in Knoydart,\r\nwhere he expected to be joined by the Marquis of Huntly and the Earl\r\nof Seaforth. As he advanced into the interior, he despatched the\r\nfiery cross for the purpose of summoning the clans to his standard;\r\nbut, although the cross was carried through a large extent of\r\ncountry, even to Aberdeen, he was joined at first only by the clan\r\nDonald, under the captain of clan Ranald, and the laird of Glengary.\r\nThe Marquis of Argyle collected an army to oppose the progress of\r\nMacdonald, and, to cut off his retreat to Ireland, he sent some ships\r\nof war to Loch Eishord, where Macdonald’s fleet lay, which captured\r\nor destroyed them. This loss, while it frustrated an intention\r\nMacdonald entertained of returning to Ireland, in consequence of the\r\ndisappointment he had met with in not being joined by the clans,\r\nstimulated him to farther exertions in continuing his march, in the\r\nhope of meeting Montrose.\r\n\r\nAs Macdonald was perfectly ignorant of Montrose’s movements, and\r\nthought it likely that he might be still at Carlisle, waiting till\r\nhe should hear of Macdonald’s arrival, he sent letters to him by the\r\nhands of a confidential friend, who resided in the neighbourhood of\r\nInchbrakie’s house. This gentleman, who knew nothing of Montrose’s\r\nreturn to Scotland, having luckily communicated to Mr. Graham the\r\nsecret of being intrusted with letters to his kinsman, Montrose,\r\nGraham offered to see them safely delivered to Montrose, though he\r\nshould ride to Carlisle himself. The gentleman in question then\r\ndelivered the letters to Graham, and Montrose having received them,\r\nwrote an answer as if from Carlisle, in which he requested Macdonald\r\nto keep up his spirits, that he would soon be joined by a seasonable\r\nreinforcement and a general at their head, and he ordered him with\r\nall expedition to march down into Athole. In fixing on Athole as the\r\nplace of his rendezvous, Montrose is said to have been actuated by\r\nan implicit reliance on the fidelity and loyalty of the Athole-men,\r\nand by a high opinion of their courage. They lay, besides, under many\r\nobligations to himself, and he calculated that he had only to appear\r\namong them to command their services in the cause of their sovereign.\r\n\r\nWhen Macdonald received these instructions, he marched towards\r\nAthole; but in passing through Badenoch he was threatened with\r\nan attack by the Earls of Sutherland and Seaforth, at the head\r\nof some of their people, and by the Frasers, Grants, Rosses, and\r\nMonroes, and other inhabitants of Moray, who had assembled at the\r\ntop of Strathspey; but Macdonald very cautiously avoided them, and\r\nhastened into Athole. On arriving in Athole, Macdonald was coldly\r\nreceived by the people of that as well as the surrounding country,\r\nwho doubted whether he had any authority from the king; and besides,\r\nthey hesitated to place themselves under the command of a person\r\nof neither noble nor ancient lineage, and whom they considered an\r\nupstart. This indecision might have proved fatal to Macdonald, who\r\nwas closely pressed in his rear by the army of Argyle, had not these\r\nuntoward deliberations been instantly put an end to by the arrival\r\nof Montrose at Blair, where Macdonald had fixed his head-quarters.\r\nMontrose had travelled seventy miles on foot, in a Highland dress,\r\naccompanied by Patrick Graham, his cousin, as his guide.[257] His\r\nappearance was hailed by his countrymen with every demonstration\r\nof joy, and they immediately made him a spontaneous offer of their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the following day, the Athole-men, to the number of\r\nabout 800, consisting chiefly of the Stewarts and Robertsons, put\r\nthemselves under arms and flocked to the standard of Montrose. Thus,\r\nin little more than twenty-four hours, Montrose saw himself at the\r\nhead of a force of upwards of 2,000 men, animated by an enthusiastic\r\nattachment to his person and to the cause which he had espoused. The\r\nextraordinary contrast between his present commanding position, and\r\nthe situation in which he was placed a few days before, as a forlorn\r\nwanderer among the mountains, produced a powerful effect upon the\r\ndaring and chivalrous spirit of Montrose, who looked forward to the\r\nsuccess of his enterprise with the eagerness of a man who considered\r\nthe destinies of his sovereign as altogether depending upon his\r\nindividual exertions. Impressed with the necessity of acting with\r\npromptitude, he did not hesitate long as to the course he should\r\npursue. He might have immediately gone in quest of Argyle, who had\r\nfollowed the army of Macdonald, with slow and cautious steps, and by\r\none of those sudden movements which no man knew better how to execute\r\nwith advantage, surprised and defeated his adversary; but such a plan\r\ndid not accord with the designs of Montrose, who resolved to open the\r\ncampaign at once in the lowlands, and thus give confidence to the\r\nfriends and supporters of the king.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion which the Lowlanders of this period entertained\r\nregarding their upland neighbours was not very respectful. A\r\ncovenanting wit, in a poem which he wrote against the bishops only\r\na few years before, says of one whose extraction was from the other\r\nside of the Grampians,\r\n\r\n      “A bishop and a Highlandman, how can’st thou honest be?”\r\n\r\nas if these two qualifications were of themselves sufficient, without\r\nany known vice, to put a man completely beyond the pale of virtue.\r\nIt seems, indeed, to have been a general belief at the time that\r\nthis primitive and sequestered people, as they were avowedly out of\r\nthe saving circle of the Covenant, were also out of the limits of\r\nboth law and religion, and therefore hopelessly and utterly given up\r\nto all sorts of wickedness. Not only were murder and robbery among\r\nthe list of offences which they were accused of daily committing,\r\nbut there even seems to have been a popular idea that sorcery was\r\na prevailing crime amongst them. They were also charged with a\r\ngeneral inclination to popery, an offence which, from the alarms and\r\nsuperstitions of the time, had now come, in general phraseology, to\r\nsignify a condensation of all others. Along with this horrible notion\r\nof the mountaineers, there was not associated the slightest idea of\r\ntheir ardent and chivalrous character; nor was there any general\r\nsensation of terror for the power which they undoubtedly possessed of\r\nannoying the peaceful inhabitants, and thwarting the policy of the\r\nLow country, no considerable body of Highlanders having been there\r\nseen in arms for several generations.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his determination, Montrose put his small army in\r\nmotion the same day towards Strathearn, in passing through which he\r\nexpected to be joined by some of the inhabitants of that and the\r\nadjoining country. At the same time he sent forward a messenger\r\nwith a friendly notice to the Menzieses of his intention to pass\r\nthrough their country, but instead of taking this in good part they\r\nmaltreated the messenger and harassed the rear of his army. This\r\nunprovoked attack so exasperated Montrose, that he ordered his men,\r\nwhen passing by Weem castle, which belonged to the clan Menzies, to\r\nplunder and lay waste their lands, and to burn their houses, an order\r\nwhich was literally obeyed. He expected that this example of summary\r\nvengeance would serve as a useful lesson to deter others, who might\r\nbe disposed to imitate the conduct of the Menzieses, from following\r\na similar course. Notwithstanding the time spent in making these\r\nreprisals, Montrose passed the Tay with a part of his forces the same\r\nevening, and the remainder followed very early the next morning.\r\nHe had, at the special request of the Athole-men themselves, placed\r\nthem under the command of his kinsman, Patrick Graham of Inchbrakie,\r\nand he now sent him forward with a select party to reconnoitre.\r\nInchbrakie soon returned with information that he had observed a\r\nparty of armed men stationed upon the hill of Buchanty. On inquiry,\r\nMontrose ascertained that this body was commanded by Lord Kilpont,\r\neldest son of the Earl of Menteith, and by Sir John Drummond, son\r\nof the Earl of Perth, both of whom were his relations. The force\r\nin question, which consisted of about 500 men, was on its way to\r\nPerth to join the other covenanting troops who were stationed there.\r\nMontrose immediately marched up to this body, with the intention,\r\nif he could not prevail on them to join him, of attacking them, but\r\nbefore he had approached sufficiently near, Lord Kilpont, who had\r\nascertained that Montrose commanded, sent some of his principal\r\nofficers to him to ascertain what his object was in thus advancing.\r\nMontrose having explained his views and stated that he acted by\r\nthe king’s authority, and having entreated them to return to their\r\nallegiance, they and the whole of their party immediately joined him.\r\nThis new accession augmented Montrose’s army to about 3,000 men.\r\n\r\nMontrose now learned from his new allies that the Covenanters had\r\nassembled their forces in great numbers at Perth, and that they lay\r\nthere waiting for his approach. The covenanting army, in fact, was\r\nmore than double that of Montrose, amounting to about 6,000 foot and\r\n700 horse, to which were attached four pieces of artillery. Montrose,\r\non the other hand, had not a single horseman, and but three horses,\r\ntwo of which were for his own use, and the other for that of Sir\r\nWilliam Rollock, and besides he had no artillery. Yet with such a\r\ndecided disparity, Montrose resolved to march directly to Perth\r\nand attack the enemy. He appears to have been influenced in this\r\nresolution by the consideration of the proximity of Argyle with his\r\narmy, and the danger in which he would be placed by being hemmed in\r\nby two hostile armies: he could expect to avoid such an embarrassment\r\nonly by risking an immediate engagement.\r\n\r\nAs the day was too far advanced to proceed to Perth, Montrose ordered\r\nhis men to bivouac during the night about three miles from Buchanty,\r\nand began his march by dawn of day. As soon as Lord Elcho, the\r\ncommander of the covenanting army, heard of Montrose’s approach,\r\nhe left Perth and drew up his army on Tippermuir, a plain of some\r\nextent between four and five miles west from the town. Reserving to\r\nhimself the command of the right wing, he committed the charge of\r\nthe left to Sir James Scott, an able and skilful officer, who had\r\nserved with great honour in the Venetian army; and to the Earl of\r\nTullibardine he intrusted the command of the centre. The horse were\r\ndivided and placed on each wing with the view of surrounding the army\r\nof Montrose, should he venture to attack them in their position. As\r\nsoon as Montrose perceived the enemy thus drawn up in battle array,\r\nhe made the necessary dispositions for attacking them. To counteract\r\nas much as possible the danger arising to such a small body of men,\r\nunprotected by cavalry, from the extended line of the Covenanters,\r\nMontrose endeavoured to make his line as extensive as possible with\r\nsafety, by limiting his files to three men deep. As the Irish had\r\nneither swords nor pikes to oppose the cavalry, they were stationed\r\nin the centre of the line, and the Highlanders, who were provided\r\nwith swords and Lochaber axes, were placed on the wings, as better\r\nfitted to resist the attacks of the cavalry. Some of the Highlanders\r\nwere, however, quite destitute of arms of every description, and\r\nit is related on the authority of an eye-witness that Montrose,\r\nseeing their helpless condition, thus quaintly addressed them:--“It\r\nis true you have no arms; your enemies, however, have plenty. My\r\nadvice, therefore, is, that as there happens to be a great abundance\r\nof stones upon this moor, every man should provide himself, in the\r\nfirst place, with as stout a stone as he can well manage, rush up to\r\nthe first Covenanter he meets, beat out his brains, take his sword,\r\nand then, I believe, he will be at no loss how to proceed.”[258]\r\nThis advice, as will be seen, was really acted upon. As Montrose\r\nwas almost destitute of powder, he ordered the Irish forces to\r\nhusband their fire till they should come close to the enemy, and\r\nafter a simultaneous discharge from the three ranks, (the front\r\nrank kneeling,) to assail the enemy thereafter as they best could.\r\nTo oppose the left wing of the Covenanters, commanded by Sir James\r\nScott, Montrose took upon himself the command of his own right,\r\nplacing Lord Kilpont at the head of the left, and Macdonald, his\r\nmajor-general, over the centre.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these arrangements, Montrose despatched an\r\naccomplished young nobleman, named Drummond, eldest son of Lord\r\nMaderty, with a message to the chiefs of the Covenanters’ army,\r\nentreating them to lay down their arms and return to their duty and\r\nobedience to their sovereign. Instead, however, of returning any\r\nanswer to this message, they seized the messenger, and sent him\r\nto Perth under an escort, with an intimation that, on obtaining\r\na victory over his master, they would execute him. Indeed, the\r\nprobability of a defeat seems never for a moment to have entered into\r\nthe imaginations of the Covenanters, and they had been assured by\r\nFrederick Carmichael, a minister who had preached to them the same\r\nday, being Sunday, 1st September, “that if ever God spoke truth out\r\nof his mouth, he promised them, in the name of God, a certain victory\r\nthat day.”[259]\r\n\r\nThere being no hopes, therefore, of an accommodation, both armies,\r\nafter advancing towards each other, remained motionless for a short\r\ntime, as if unwilling to begin the attack; but this state of matters\r\nwas speedily put an end to by the advance of a select skirmishing\r\nparty under the command of Lord Drummond, sent out from the main body\r\nof the covenanting army, for the double purpose of distracting the\r\nattention of Montrose, and inducing his troops to leave their ranks,\r\nand thus create confusion among them; but Montrose kept his men in\r\ncheck, and contented himself with sending out a few of his men to\r\noppose them. Lord Drummond, whom Baillie appears to have suspected\r\nof treachery, and his party were routed at the first onset, and\r\nfled back upon the main body in great disorder. This trivial affair\r\ndecided the fate of the day, for the Covenanters, many of whom were\r\nundisciplined, seeing the unexpected defeat of Lord Drummond’s party,\r\nbecame quite dispirited, and began to show symptoms which indicated a\r\ndisposition for immediate flight. The confusion into which the main\r\nbody had been thrown by the retreat of the advanced party, and the\r\nindecision which seemed now to prevail in the Covenanters’ army in\r\nconsequence of that reverse, were observed by the watchful eye of\r\nMontrose, who saw that the favourable moment for striking a decisive\r\nblow had arrived. He therefore gave orders to his men to advance,\r\nwho, immediately setting up a loud shout, rushed forward at a quick\r\npace towards the enemy. They were met by a random discharge from some\r\ncannon which the Covenanters had placed in front of their army, but\r\nwhich did little or no execution. When sufficiently near, Montrose’s\r\nmusketeers halted, and, as ordered, poured a volley into the main\r\nrank of the Covenanters, which immediately gave way. The cavalry of\r\nthe Covenanters, thereupon, issued from their stations and attacked\r\nthe royalists, who, in their turn, defended themselves with singular\r\nintrepidity. While the armed Highlanders made ample use of their\r\nLochaber axes and swords, the Irish steadily opposed the attacks of\r\nthe horse with the butt ends of their muskets; but the most effective\r\nannoyance which the cavalry met with appears to have proceeded from\r\nthe unarmed Highlanders, who having supplied themselves with a\r\nquantity of stones, as suggested by Montrose, discharged them with\r\nwell-directed aim at the horses and their riders. The result was,\r\nthat after a short struggle, the cavalry were obliged to make a\r\nprecipitate retreat. While this contest was going on, another part of\r\nMontrose’s army was engaged with the right wing of the covenanting\r\narmy, under Sir James Scott, but although this body made a longer\r\nand more determined resistance, and galled the party opposed to them\r\nby an incessant fire of musketry, they were at last overpowered\r\nby the Athole-men, who rushed upon them with their broad-swords,\r\nand cut down and wounded a considerable number. The rout of the\r\nCovenanters now became general. The horsemen saved themselves by\r\nthe fleetness of their horses; but during the pursuit, which was\r\nkept up to a distance of six or seven miles, many hundreds of foot\r\nwere killed, and a considerable number made prisoners,[260] some of\r\nwhom afterwards served in Montrose’s army. The loss on the side of\r\nMontrose appears to have been very trifling. By this victory, and the\r\nsubsequent capture of Perth, which he entered the same day, Montrose\r\nwas enabled to equip his army with all those warlike necessaries of\r\nwhich it had been so remarkably destitute in the morning, and of\r\nwhich the Covenanters left him an abundant supply.[261]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[232] Gordon’s _Scots Affairs_, vol. ii. p. 209.\r\n\r\n[233] Spalding, vol. i. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[234] _Troubles_, vol. i. pp. 107, 108.\r\n\r\n[235] Spalding, vol. i. pp. 157, 160.\r\n\r\n[236] Gordon of Rothiemay, vol. ii. p. 235.\r\n\r\n[237] Id., vol. ii. p. 235.\r\n\r\n[238] Spalding, vol. i. p. 168.\r\n\r\n[239] Ibid. p. 177.\r\n\r\n[240] Gordon of Rothiemay, ii. 240.

The spirits of\r\nthe royalists had been too much subdued by the severities of the\r\nCovenanters for them all at once to risk their lives and fortunes\r\non the issue of what they had long considered a hopeless cause; and\r\nalthough Montrose had succeeded in dispersing one army with a greatly\r\ninferior force, yet it was well known that that army was composed of\r\nraw and undisciplined men, and that the Covenanters had still large\r\nbodies of well-trained troops in the field.\r\n\r\nThus disappointed in his hopes, and understanding that the Marquis\r\nof Argyle was fast approaching with a large army, Montrose crossed\r\nthe Tay on the 4th of September, directing his course towards\r\nCoupar-Angus, and encamped at night in the open fields near Collace.\r\nHis object in proceeding northward was to endeavour to raise some of\r\nthe loyal clans, and thus to put himself in a sufficiently strong\r\ncondition to meet Argyle. Montrose had given orders to the army to\r\nmarch early next morning, but by break of day, and before the drums\r\nhad beat, he was alarmed by an uproar in the camp. Perceiving his\r\nmen running to their arms in a state of fury and rage, Montrose,\r\napprehensive that the Highlanders and Irish had quarrelled,\r\nimmediately rushed in among the thickest of the crowd to pacify\r\nthem, but to his great grief and dismay, he ascertained that the\r\nconfusion had arisen from the assassination of his valued friend Lord\r\nKilpont. He had fallen a victim to the blind fury of James Stewart of\r\nArdvoirlich, with whom he had slept the same night, and who had long\r\nenjoyed his confidence and friendship. According to Wishart, wishing\r\nto ingratiate himself with the Covenanters, he formed a design to\r\nassassinate Montrose or his major-general, Macdonald; and endeavoured\r\nto entice Kilpont to concur in his wicked project. He, therefore, on\r\nthe night in question, slept with his lordship, and having prevailed\r\nupon him to rise and take a walk in the fields before daylight, on\r\nthe pretence of refreshing themselves, he there disclosed his horrid\r\npurpose, and entreated his lordship to concur therein. Lord Kilpont\r\nrejected the base proposal with horror and indignation, which so\r\nalarmed Stewart that, afraid lest his lordship might discover the\r\nmatter, he suddenly drew his dirk and mortally wounded Kilpont.\r\nStewart, thereupon, fled, and thereafter joined the Marquis of\r\nArgyle, who gave him a commission in his army.[262]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUART. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nMontrose now marched upon Dundee, which refused to surrender. Not\r\nwishing to waste his time upon the hazardous issue of a siege with\r\na hostile army in his rear, Montrose proceeded through Angus and\r\nthe Mearns, and in the course of his route was joined by the Earl\r\nof Airly, his two sons, Sir Thomas and Sir David Ogilvie, and a\r\nconsiderable number of their friends and vassals, and some gentlemen\r\nfrom the Mearns and Aberdeenshire. This was a seasonable addition to\r\nMontrose’s force, which had been greatly weakened by the absence of\r\nsome of the Highlanders who had gone home to deposit their spoils,\r\nand by the departure of Lord Kilpont’s retainers, who had gone to\r\nMonteith with his corpse.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Tippermuir, Lord Elcho had retired, with his\r\nregiment and some fugitives, to Aberdeen, where he found Lord\r\nBurleigh and other commissioners from the convention of estates.\r\nAs soon as they heard of the approach of Montrose, Burleigh, who\r\nacted as chief commissioner, immediately assembled the Forbeses, the\r\nFrasers, and the other friends of the covenanting interest, and did\r\neverything in his power to gain over to his side as many persons as\r\nhe could from those districts where Montrose expected assistance. In\r\nthis way Burleigh increased his force to 2,500 foot and 500 horse,\r\nbut some of these, consisting of Gordons, and others who were obliged\r\nto take up arms, could not be relied upon.\r\n\r\nWhen Montrose heard of these preparations, he resolved,\r\nnotwithstanding the disparity of force, his own army now amounting\r\nonly to 1,500 foot and 44 horse, to hasten his march and attack them\r\nbefore Argyle should come up. On arriving near the bridge of Dee, he\r\nfound it strongly fortified and guarded by a considerable force. He\r\ndid not attempt to force a passage, but, directing his course to the\r\nwest, along the river, crossed it at a ford at the Mills of Drum,\r\nand encamped at Crathas that night (Wednesday, 11th September). The\r\nCovenanters, the same day, drew up their army at the Two Mile Cross,\r\na short distance from Aberdeen, where they remained till Thursday\r\nnight, when they retired into the town. On the same night, Montrose\r\nmarched down Dee-side, and took possession of the ground which the\r\nCovenanters had just left.[263]\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, viz., Friday, 13th September, about\r\neleven o’clock, the Covenanters marched out of Aberdeen to meet\r\nMontrose, who, on their approach, despatched a drummer to beat a\r\nparley, and sent a commissioner along with him bearing a letter to\r\nthe provost and bailies of Aberdeen, commanding and charging them\r\nto surrender the town, promising that no more harm should be done\r\nto it; “otherwise, if they would disobey, that then he desired them\r\nto remove old aged men, women, and children out of the way, and to\r\nstand to their own peril.” Immediately on receipt of this letter,\r\nthe provost called a meeting of the council, which was attended by\r\nLord Burleigh, and, after a short consultation, an answer was sent\r\nalong with the commissioner declining to surrender the town. On their\r\nreturn the drummer was killed by the Covenanters, at a place called\r\nJustice Mills; which violation of the law of nations so exasperated\r\nMontrose, that he gave orders to his men not to spare any of the\r\nenemy who might fall into their hands. His anger at this occurrence\r\nis strongly depicted by Spalding, who says, that “he grew mad, and\r\nbecame furious and impatient.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Montrose received notice of the refusal of the magistrates\r\nto surrender the town, he made the necessary dispositions for\r\nattacking the enemy. From his paucity of cavalry, he was obliged to\r\nextend his line, as he had done at Tippermuir, to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom surrounding or outflanking him with their horse, and on each\r\nof his wings he posted his small body of horsemen along with select\r\nparties of musketeers and archers. To James Hay and Sir Nathaniel\r\nGordon he gave the command of the right wing, committing the charge\r\nof the left to Sir William Rollock, all men of tried bravery and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe Covenanters began the battle by a cannonade from their\r\nfield-pieces, and, from their commanding position, gave considerable\r\nannoyance to the royal forces, who were very deficient in artillery.\r\nAfter the firing had been kept up for some time, Lord Lewis Gordon,\r\nthird son of the Marquis of Huntly, a young man of a very ardent\r\ndisposition, and of a violent and changeable temper, who commanded\r\nthe left wing of the Covenanters, having obtained possession of some\r\nlevel ground where his horse could act, made a demonstration to\r\nattack Montrose’s right wing; which being observed by Montrose, he\r\nimmediately ordered Sir William Rollock, with his party of horse,\r\nfrom the left wing to the assistance of the right. These united\r\nwings, which consisted of only 44 horse, not only repulsed the attack\r\nof a body of 300, but threw them into complete disorder, and forced\r\nthem to retreat upon the main body, leaving many dead and wounded on\r\nthe field. Montrose restrained these brave cavaliers from pursuing\r\nthe body they had routed, anticipating that their services might be\r\nsoon required at the other wing; and he was not mistaken, for no\r\nsooner did the covenanting general perceive the retreat of Lord Lewis\r\nGordon than he ordered an attack to be made upon the left wing of\r\nMontrose’s army; but Montrose, with a celerity almost unexampled,\r\nmoved his whole cavalry from the right to the left wing, which,\r\nfalling upon the flank of their assailants sword in hand, forced them\r\nto fly, with great slaughter. In this affair Montrose’s horse took\r\nForbes of Craigievar and Forbes of Boyndlie prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful attacks on the wings of Montrose’s army had in no\r\nshape affected the future fortune of the day, as both armies kept\r\ntheir ground, and were equally animated with hopes of ultimate\r\nsuccess. Vexed, but by no means intimidated by their second defeat,\r\nthe gentlemen who composed Burleigh’s horse consulted together\r\nas to the best mode of renewing the attack; and, being of opinion\r\nthat the success of Montrose’s cavalry was owing chiefly to the\r\nexpert musketeers, with whom they were interlined, they resolved to\r\nimitate the same plan, by mixing among them a select body of foot,\r\nand renewing the charge a third time, with redoubled energy. But\r\nthis scheme, which might have proved fatal to Montrose, if tried,\r\nwas frustrated by a resolution he came to, of making an instant and\r\nsimultaneous attack upon the enemy. Perceiving their horse still in\r\ngreat confusion, and a considerable way apart from their main body,\r\nhe determined upon attacking them with his foot before they should\r\nget time to rally; and galloping up to his men, who had been greatly\r\ngalled by the enemies’ cannon, he told them that there was no good\r\nto be expected by the two armies keeping at such a distance--that in\r\nthis way there was no means of distinguishing the strong from the\r\nweak, nor the coward from the brave man, but that if they would once\r\nmake a home charge upon these timorous and effeminate striplings,\r\nas he called Burleigh’s horse, they would never stand their attack.\r\n“Come on, then,” said he, “my brave fellow-soldiers, fall down upon\r\nthem with your swords and muskets, drive them before you, and make\r\nthem suffer the punishment due to their perfidy and rebellion.”[264]\r\nThese words were no sooner uttered, than Montrose’s men rushed\r\nforward at a quick pace and fell upon the enemy, sword in hand. The\r\nCovenanters were paralyzed by the suddenness and impetuosity of the\r\nattack, and, turning their backs, fled in the utmost trepidation\r\nand confusion, towards Aberdeen. The slaughter was tremendous,\r\nas the victors spared no man. The road leading from the field of\r\nbattle to Aberdeen was strewed with the dead and the dying; the\r\nstreets of Aberdeen were covered with the bodies, and stained with\r\nthe blood of its inhabitants. “The lieutenant followed the chase\r\ninto Aberdeen, his men hewing and cutting down all manner of men\r\nthey could overtake, within the town, upon the streets, or in the\r\nhouses, and round about the town, as our men were fleeing, with broad\r\nswords, but (_i.e._ without) mercy or remeid. Their cruel Irish,\r\nseeing a man well clad, would first tyr (strip) him, and save his\r\nclothes unspoiled, syne kill the man.”[265] In fine, according to\r\nthis writer, who was an eye-witness, the town of Aberdeen, which, but\r\na few years before, had suffered for its loyalty, was now, by the\r\nsame general who had then oppressed it, delivered up by him to be\r\nindiscriminately plundered by his Irish forces, for having espoused\r\nthe same cause which he himself had supported. For four days did\r\nthese men indulge in the most dreadful excesses, “and nothing,”\r\ncontinues Spalding, was “heard but pitiful howling, crying, weeping,\r\nmourning, through all the streets.” Yet Guthry says that Montrose\r\n“shewed great mercy, both pardoning the people and protecting their\r\ngoods.”[266]\r\n\r\nIt is singular, that although the battle continued for four hours\r\nwithout any determinate result, Montrose lost very few men, a\r\ncircumstance the more extraordinary as the cannon of the Covenanters\r\nwere placed upon advantageous ground, whilst those of Montrose were\r\nrendered quite ineffective by being situated in a position from\r\nwhich they could not be brought to bear upon the enemy. An anecdote,\r\ncharacteristic of the bravery of the Irish, and of their coolness\r\nin enduring the privations of war, has been preserved. During the\r\ncannonade on the side of the Covenanters, an Irishman had his leg\r\nshot away by a cannon ball, but which kept still attached to the\r\nstump by means of a small bit of skin, or flesh. His comrades-in-arms\r\nbeing affected with his disaster, this brave man, without betraying\r\nany symptoms of pain, thus cheerfully addressed them:--“This, my\r\ncompanions, is the fate of war, and what none of us ought to grudge:\r\ngo on, and behave as becomes you; and, as for me, I am certain my\r\nlord, the marquis, will make me a trooper, as I am now disabled\r\nfor the foot service.” Then, taking a knife from his pocket, he\r\ndeliberately opened it, and cut asunder the skin which retained the\r\nleg, without betraying the least emotion, and delivered it to one of\r\nhis companions for interment. As soon as this courageous man was able\r\nto mount a horse, his wish to become a trooper was complied with, in\r\nwhich capacity he afterwards distinguished himself.[267]\r\n\r\nHoping that the news of the victory he had obtained would create a\r\nstrong feeling in his favour among the Gordons, some of whom had\r\nactually fought against him, under the command of Lord Lewis Gordon,\r\nMontrose sent a part of his army towards Kintore and Inverury,\r\nthe following day, to encourage the people of the surrounding\r\ncountry to declare for him; but he was sadly disappointed in his\r\nexpectations. The fact is, that ever since the appointment of\r\nMontrose as lieutenant-general of the kingdom,--an appointment which\r\ntrenched upon the authority of the Marquis of Huntly as lieutenant\r\nof the north,--the latter had become quite lukewarm in the cause\r\nof his sovereign; and, although he was aware of the intentions of\r\nhis son, Lord Lewis, to join the Covenanters, he quietly allowed\r\nhim to do so without remonstrance. But, besides being thus, in\r\nsome measure, superseded by Montrose, the marquis was actuated by\r\npersonal hostility to him on account of the treatment he had formerly\r\nreceived from him; and it appears to have been partly to gratify\r\nhis spleen that he remained a passive observer of a struggle which\r\ninvolved the very existence of the monarchy itself. Whatever may have\r\nbeen Huntly’s reasons for not supporting Montrose, his apathy and\r\nindifference had a deadening influence upon his numerous retainers,\r\nwho had no idea of taking the field but at the command of their chief.\r\n\r\nAs Montrose saw no possibility of opposing the powerful and\r\nwell-appointed army of Argyle, which was advancing upon him with slow\r\nand cautious steps, disappointed as he had been of the aid which he\r\nhad calculated upon, he resolved to march into the Highlands, and\r\nthere collect such of the clans as were favourably disposed to the\r\nroyal cause. Leaving Aberdeen, therefore, on the 16th of September,\r\nwith the remainder of his forces, he joined the camp at Kintore,\r\nwhence he despatched Sir William Rollock to Oxford to inform the king\r\nof the events of the campaign, and of his present situation, and to\r\nsolicit him to send supplies.\r\n\r\nWe must now advert to the progress of Argyle’s army, the slow\r\nmovements of which form an unfavourable contrast with the rapid\r\nmarches of Montrose’s army. On the 4th of September, four days\r\nafter the battle of Tippermuir, Argyle, who had been pursuing the\r\nIrish forces under Macdonald, had arrived with his Highlanders at\r\nStirling, where, on the following day, he was joined by the Earl of\r\nLothian and his regiment, which had shortly before been brought over\r\nfrom Ireland. After raising some men in Stirlingshire, he marched\r\nto Perth upon the 10th, where he was joined by some Fife men, and\r\nLord Bargenny’s and Sir Frederick Hamilton’s regiments of horse,\r\nwhich had been recalled from Newcastle for that purpose. With this\r\nincreased force, which now consisted of about 3,000 foot and two\r\nregular cavalry regiments, besides ten troops of horse, Argyle left\r\nPerth on the 14th of September for the north, and in his route was\r\njoined by the Earl Marshal, Lords Gordon, Fraser, and Crichton, and\r\nother Covenanters. He arrived at Aberdeen upon the 19th of September,\r\nwhere he issued a proclamation, declaring the Marquis of Montrose and\r\nhis followers traitors to religion and to their king and country, and\r\noffering a reward of 20,000 pounds Scots, to any person who should\r\nbring in Montrose dead or alive.[268] Spalding laments with great\r\npathos and feeling the severe hardships to which the citizens of\r\nAberdeen had been subjected by these frequent visitations of hostile\r\narmies, and alluding to the present occupancy of the town by Argyle,\r\nhe observes that “this multitude of people lived upon free quarters,\r\na new grief to both towns, whereof there was quartered on poor old\r\nAberdeen Argyle’s own three regiments. The soldiers had their baggage\r\ncarried, and craved nothing but house-room and fire. But ilk captain,\r\nwith twelve gentlemen, had free quarters, (so long as the town had\r\nmeat and drink,) for two ordinaries, but the third ordinary they\r\nfurnished themselves out of their own baggage and provisions, having\r\nstore of meal, molt and sheep, carried with them. But, the first\r\nnight, they drank out all the stale ale in Aberdeen, and lived upon\r\nwort thereafter.”[269]\r\n\r\nArgyle was now within half a day’s march of Montrose, but, strange\r\nto tell, he made no preparations to follow him, and spent two or\r\nthree days in Aberdeen doing absolutely nothing. After spending\r\nthis time in inglorious supineness, Argyle put his army in motion\r\nin the direction of Kintore. Montrose, on hearing of his approach,\r\nconcealed his cannon in a bog, and leaving behind him some of his\r\nheavy baggage, made towards the Spey with the intention of crossing\r\nit. On arriving at the river, he encamped near the old castle of\r\nRothiemurchus; but finding that the boats used in passing the river\r\nhad been removed to the north side of the river, and that a large\r\narmed force from the country on the north of the Spey had assembled\r\non the opposite bank to oppose his passage, Montrose marched his\r\narmy into the forest of Abernethy. Argyle only proceeded at first as\r\nfar as Strathbogie; but instead of pursuing Montrose, he allowed his\r\ntroops to waste their time in plundering the properties and laying\r\nwaste the lands of the Gordons in Strathbogie and the Enzie, under\r\nthe very eyes of Lord Gordon and Lord Lewis Gordon, neither of whom\r\nappears to have endeavoured to avert such a calamity. Spalding says\r\nthat it was “a wonderful unnaturalitie in the Lord Gordon to suffer\r\nhis father’s lands and friends in his own sight to be thus wreckt\r\nand destroyed in his father’s absence;” but Lord Gordon likely had\r\nit not in his power to stay these proceedings, which, if not done at\r\nthe instigation, may have received the approbation of his violent\r\nand headstrong younger brother, who had joined the Covenanters’\r\nstandard. On the 27th of September, Argyle mustered his forces at\r\nthe Bog of Gicht, when they were found to amount to about 4,000 men;\r\nbut although the army of Montrose did not amount to much more than a\r\nthird of that number, and was within twenty miles’ distance, he did\r\nnot venture to attack him. After remaining a few days in Abernethy\r\nforest, Montrose passed through the forest of Rothiemurchus, and\r\nfollowing the course of the Spey, marched through Badenoch to Athole,\r\nwhich he reached on 1st October.\r\n\r\nWhen Argyle heard of the departure of Montrose from the forest of\r\nAbernethy, he made a feint of following him. He accordingly set his\r\narmy in motion along Spey-side, and crossing the river himself with\r\na few horse, marched up some distance along the north bank, and\r\nrecrossed, when he ordered his troops to halt. He then proceeded to\r\nForres to attend a committee meeting of Covenanters to concert a\r\nplan of operations in the north, at which the Earl of Sutherland,\r\nLord Lovat, the sheriff of Moray, the lairds of Balnagown, Innes and\r\nPluscardine, and many others were present. From Forres Argyle went to\r\nInverness, and after giving some instructions to Sir Mungo Campbell\r\nof Lawers, and the laird of Buchanan, the commanders of the regiments\r\nstationed there, he returned to his army, which he marched through\r\nBadenoch in pursuit of Montrose. From Athole Montrose sent Macdonald\r\nwith a party of 500 men to the Western Highlands, to invite the laird\r\nof Maclean, the captain of clan Ranald, and others to join him.\r\nMarching down to Dunkeld, Montrose himself proceeded rapidly through\r\nAngus towards Brechin and Montrose.[270]\r\n\r\nAlthough some delay had been occasioned in Montrose’s movements by\r\nhis illness for a few days in Badenoch, this was fully compensated\r\nfor by the tardy motions of Argyle, who, on entering Badenoch,\r\nfound that his vigilant antagonist was several days’ march a-head\r\nof him. This intelligence, however, did not induce him in the least\r\nto accelerate his march. Hearing, when passing through Badenoch,\r\nthat Montrose had been joined by some of the inhabitants of that\r\ncountry, Argyle, according to Spalding, “left nothing of that country\r\nundestroyed, no not one four footed beast;” and Athole shared a\r\nsimilar fate.\r\n\r\nAt the time Montrose entered Angus, a committee of the estates,\r\nconsisting of the Earl Marshal and other barons, was sitting in\r\nAberdeen, who, on hearing of his approach, issued on the 10th of\r\nOctober a printed order, to which the Earl Marshal’s name was\r\nattached, ordaining, under pain of being severely fined, all persons,\r\nof whatever age, sex, or condition, having horses of the value\r\nof forty pounds Scots or upwards, to send them to the bridge of\r\nDee, which was appointed as the place of rendezvous, on the 14th\r\nof October, by ten o’clock, A.M., with riders fully equipped and\r\narmed. With the exception of Lord Gordon, who brought three troops\r\nof horse, and Captain Alexander Keith, brother of the Earl Marshal,\r\nwho appeared with one troop at the appointed place, no attention was\r\npaid to the order of the committee by the people, who had not yet\r\nrecovered from their fears, and their recent sufferings were still\r\ntoo fresh in their minds to induce them again to expose themselves to\r\nthe vengeance of Montrose and his Irish troops.\r\n\r\nAfter refreshing his army for a few days in Angus, Montrose prepared\r\nto cross the Grampians, and march to Strathbogie to make another\r\nattempt to raise the Gordons; but, before setting out on his\r\nmarch, he released Forbes of Craigievar and Forbes of Boyndlie, on\r\ntheir parole, upon condition that Craigievar should procure the\r\nliberation of the young laird of Drum and his brother from the jail\r\nof Edinburgh, failing which, Craigievar and Boyndlie were both\r\nto deliver themselves up to him as prisoners before the 1st of\r\nNovember. This act of generosity on the part of Montrose was greatly\r\nadmired, more particularly as Craigievar was one of the heads of the\r\nCovenanters, and had great influence among them. In pursuance of\r\nhis design, Montrose marched through the Mearns, and upon Thursday,\r\nthe 17th of October, crossed the Dee at the Mills of Drum, with his\r\nwhole army. In his progress north, contrary to his former forbearing\r\npolicy, he laid waste the lands of some of the leading Covenanters,\r\nburnt their houses, and plundered their effects. He arrived at\r\nStrathbogie on the 19th of October, where he remained till the 27th,\r\nwithout being able to induce any considerable number of the Gordons\r\nto join him. It was not from want of inclination that they refused\r\nto do so, but they were unwilling to incur the displeasure of their\r\nchief, who they knew was personally opposed to Montrose, and who felt\r\nindignant at seeing a man who had formerly espoused the cause of the\r\nCovenanters preferred before him. Had Montrose been accompanied by\r\nany of the Marquis of Huntly’s sons, they might have had influence\r\nenough to have induced some of the Gordons to declare for him; but\r\nthe situation of the marquis’s three sons was at this time very\r\npeculiar. The eldest son, Lord Gordon, a young man “of singular worth\r\nand accomplishments,” was with Argyle, his uncle by the mother’s\r\nside; the Earl of Aboyne, the second son, was shut up in the castle\r\nof Carlisle, then in a state of siege; and Lord Lewis Gordon, the\r\nthird son, had, as we have seen, joined the Covenanters, and fought\r\nin their ranks.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of matters, Montrose left Strathbogie on the day\r\nlast mentioned, and took up a position in the forest of Fyvie, where\r\nhe despatched some of his troops, who took possession of the castles\r\nof Fyvie and Tollie Barclay, in which he found a good supply of\r\nprovisions, which was of great service to his army. During his stay\r\nat Strathbogie, Montrose kept a strict outlook for the enemy, and\r\nscarcely passed a night without scouring the neighbouring country\r\nto the distance of several miles with parties of light foot, who\r\nattacked straggling parties of the Covenanters, and brought in\r\nprisoners from time to time, without sustaining any loss. These petty\r\nenterprises, while they alarmed their enemies, gave an extraordinary\r\ndegree of confidence to Montrose’s men, who were ready to undertake\r\nany service, however difficult or dangerous, if he only commanded\r\nthem to perform it.\r\n\r\nWhen Montrose crossed the Dee, Argyle was several days’ march behind\r\nhim. The latter, however, reached Aberdeen on the 24th of October,\r\nand proceeded the following morning towards Kintore, which he reached\r\nthe same night. Next morning he marched forward to Inverury, where\r\nhe halted at night. Here he was joined by the Earl of Lothian’s\r\nregiment, which increased his force to about 2,500 foot, and 1,200\r\nhorse. In his progress through the counties of Angus, Kincardine,\r\nAberdeen, and Banff, he received no accession of strength, from the\r\ndread which the name and actions of Montrose had infused into the\r\nminds of the inhabitants of these counties.\r\n\r\nThe sudden movements of Argyle from Aberdeen to Kintore, and from\r\nKintore to Inverury, form a remarkable contrast with the slowness\r\nof his former motions. He had followed Montrose through a long\r\nand circuitous route, the greater part of which still bore recent\r\ntraces of his footsteps, and instead of showing any disposition\r\nto overtake his flying foe, seemed rather inclined to keep that\r\nrespectful distance from him so congenial to the mind of one who,\r\n“willing to wound,” is “yet still afraid to strike.” But although\r\nthis questionable policy of Argyle was by no means calculated to\r\nraise his military fame, it had the effect of throwing Montrose, in\r\nthe present case, off his guard, and had well-nigh proved fatal to\r\nhim. The rapid march of Argyle on Kintore and Inverury, in fact, was\r\neffected without Montrose’s knowledge, for the spies he had employed\r\nconcealed the matter from him, and while he imagined that Argyle was\r\nstill on the other side of the Grampians, he suddenly appeared within\r\na very few miles of Montrose’s camp, on the 28th of October.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected arrival of Argyle’s army did not disconcert Montrose.\r\nHis foot, which amounted to 1,500 men, were little more than the\r\nhalf of those under Argyle, while he had only about 50 horse to\r\noppose 1,200. Yet, with this immense disparity, he resolved to await\r\nthe attack of the enemy, judging it inexpedient, from the want of\r\ncavalry, to become the assailant by descending into the plain where\r\nArgyle’s army was encamped. On a rugged eminence behind the castle\r\nof Fyvie, on the uneven sides of which several ditches had been\r\ncut and dikes built to serve as farm fences, Montrose drew up his\r\nlittle but intrepid host; but before he had marked out the positions\r\nto be occupied by his divisions, he had the misfortune to witness\r\nthe desertion of a small body of the Gordons, who had joined him\r\nat Strathbogie. They, however, did not join Argyle, but contented\r\nthemselves with withdrawing altogether from the scene of the\r\nensuing action. It is probable that they came to the determination\r\nof retiring, not from cowardice, but from disinclination to appear\r\nin the field against Lord Lewis Gordon, who held a high command\r\nin Argyle’s army. The secession of the Gordons, though in reality\r\na circumstance of trifling importance in itself, (for had they\r\nremained, they would have fought unwillingly, and consequently might\r\nnot have had sufficient resolution to maintain the position which\r\nwould have been assigned them,) had a disheartening influence upon\r\nthe spirits of Montrose’s men, and accordingly they found themselves\r\nunable to resist the first shock of Argyle’s numerous forces, who,\r\ncharging them with great impetuosity, drove them up the eminence, of\r\na considerable part of which Argyle’s army got possession. In this\r\ncritical conjuncture, when terror and despair seemed about to obtain\r\nthe mastery over hearts to which fear had hitherto been a stranger,\r\nMontrose displayed a coolness and presence of mind equal to the\r\ndangers which surrounded him. Animating them by his presence, and by\r\nthe example which he showed in risking his person in the hottest of\r\nthe fight, he roused their courage by putting them further in mind\r\nof the victories they had achieved, and how greatly superior they\r\nwere in bravery to the enemy opposed to them. After this emphatic\r\nappeal to their feelings, Montrose turned to Colonel O’Kean, a young\r\nIrish gentleman, highly respected by the former for his bravery,\r\nand desired him, with an air of the most perfect _sang froid_, to\r\ngo down with such men as were readiest, and to drive these fellows\r\n(meaning Argyle’s men), out of the ditches, that they might be no\r\nmore troubled with them. O’Kean quickly obeyed the mandate, and\r\nthough the party in the ditches was greatly superior to the body he\r\nled, and was, moreover, supported by some horse, he drove them away,\r\nand captured several bags of powder which they left behind them in\r\ntheir hurry to escape. This was a valuable acquisition, as Montrose’s\r\nmen had spent already almost the whole of their ammunition.\r\n\r\nWhile O’Kean was executing this brilliant affair, Montrose observed\r\nfive troops of horse, under the Earl of Lothian, preparing to attack\r\nhis 50 horse, who were posted a little way up the eminence, with a\r\nsmall wood in their rear. He, therefore, without a moment’s delay,\r\nordered a party of musketeers to their aid, who, having interlined\r\nthemselves with the 50 horse, kept up such a galling fire upon\r\nLothian’s troopers, that before they had advanced half way across a\r\nfield which lay between them and Montrose’s horse, they were obliged\r\nto wheel about and gallop off.\r\n\r\nMontrose’s men became so elated with their success that they could\r\nscarcely be restrained from leaving their ground and making a general\r\nattack upon the whole of Argyle’s army; but although Montrose did\r\nnot approve of this design, he disguised his opinion, and seemed\r\nrather to concur in the views of his men, telling them, however, to\r\nbe so far mindful of their duty as to wait till he should see the\r\nfit moment for ordering the attack. Argyle remained till the evening\r\nwithout attempting anything farther, and then retired to a distance\r\nof about three miles across the Spey; his men passed the night under\r\narms. The only person of note killed in these skirmishes was Captain\r\nKeith, brother of the Earl Marshal.\r\n\r\nNext day Argyle resolved to attack Montrose, with the view of driving\r\nhim from his position. He was induced to come to this determination\r\nfrom a report, too well founded, which had reached him, that\r\nMontrose’s army was almost destitute of ammunition;--indeed, he had\r\ncompelled the inhabitants of all the surrounding districts to deliver\r\nup every article of pewter in their possession for the purpose of\r\nbeing converted into ammunition; but this precarious supply appears\r\nsoon to have been exhausted.[271] On arriving at the bottom of the\r\nhill, he changed his resolution, not judging it safe, from the\r\nexperience of the preceding day, to hazard an attack. Montrose, on\r\nthe other hand, agreeably to his original plan, kept his ground, as\r\nhe did not deem it advisable to expose his men to the enemy’s cavalry\r\nby descending from the eminence. With the exception of some trifling\r\nskirmishes between the advanced posts, the main body of both armies\r\nremained quiescent during the whole day. Argyle again retired in the\r\nevening to the ground he had occupied the preceding night, whence\r\nhe returned the following day, part of which was spent in the same\r\nmanner as the former; but long before the day had expired he led off\r\nhis army, “upon fair day light,” says Spalding, “to a considerable\r\ndistance, leaving Montrose to effect his escape unmolested.”\r\n\r\nMontrose, thus left to follow any course he pleased, marched off\r\nafter nightfall towards Strathbogie, plundering Turriff and Rothiemay\r\nhouse in his route. He selected Strathbogie as the place of his\r\nretreat on account of the ruggedness of the country and of the\r\nnumerous dikes with which it was intersected, which would prevent\r\nthe operations of Argyle’s cavalry, and where he intended to remain\r\ntill joined by Macdonald, whom he daily expected from the Highlands\r\nwith a reinforcement. When Argyle heard of Montrose’s departure on\r\nthe following morning, being the last day of October, he forthwith\r\nproceeded after him with his army, thinking to bring him to action in\r\nthe open country, and encamped at Tullochbeg on the 2d of November,\r\nwhere he drew out his army in battle array. He endeavoured to bring\r\nMontrose to a general engagement, and, in order to draw him from a\r\nfavourable position he was preparing to occupy, Argyle sent out a\r\nskirmishing party of his Highlanders; but they were soon repulsed,\r\nand Montrose took possession of the ground he had selected.\r\n\r\nBaffled in all his attempts to overcome Montrose by force of\r\narms, Argyle, whose talents were more fitted for the intrigues of\r\nthe cabinet than the tactics of the field, had now recourse to\r\nnegotiation, with the view of effecting the ruin of his antagonist.\r\nFor this purpose he proposed a cessation of arms, and that he and\r\nMontrose should hold a conference, previous to which arrangements\r\nshould be entered into for their mutual security. Montrose knew\r\nArgyle too well to place any reliance upon his word, and as he had\r\nno doubt that Argyle would take advantage, during the proposed\r\ncessation, to tamper with his men and endeavour to withdraw them from\r\ntheir allegiance, he called a council of war, and proposed to retire\r\nwithout delay to the Highlands. The council at once approved of this\r\nsuggestion, whereupon Montrose resolved to march next night as far\r\nas Badenoch; and that his army might be able to accomplish such a\r\nlong journey within the time fixed, he immediately sent off all his\r\nheavy baggage under a guard, and ordered his men to keep themselves\r\nprepared as if to fight a battle the next day.[272] Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had the carriages and heavy baggage been despatched, when\r\nan event took place which greatly disconcerted Montrose. This was\r\nnothing less than the desertion of his friend Colonel Sibbald\r\nand some of his officers, who went over to the enemy. They were\r\naccompanied by Sir William Forbes of Craigievar, who, having been\r\nunable to fulfil the condition on which he was to obtain his ultimate\r\nliberation, had returned two or three days before to Montrose’s\r\ncamp. This distressing occurrence induced Montrose to postpone his\r\nmarch for a time, as he was quite certain that the deserters would\r\ncommunicate his plans to Argyle. Ordering, therefore, back the\r\nbaggage he had sent off, he resumed his former position, in which he\r\nremained four days, as if he there intended to take up his winter\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Montrose had the mortification to witness the\r\ndefection of almost the whole of his officers, who were very\r\nnumerous, for, with the exception of the Irish and Highlanders, they\r\noutnumbered the privates from the Lowlands. The bad example which\r\nhad been set by Sibbald, the intimate friend of Montrose, and the\r\ninsidious promises of preferment held out to them by Argyle, induced\r\nsome, whose loyalty was questionable, to adopt this course; but the\r\nidea of the privations to which they would be exposed in traversing,\r\nduring winter, among frost and snow, the dreary and dangerous regions\r\nof the Highlands, shook the constancy of others, who, in different\r\ncircumstances, would have willingly exposed their lives for their\r\nsovereign. Bad health, inability to undergo the fatigue of long and\r\nconstant marches--these and other excuses were made to Montrose as\r\nthe reasons for craving a discharge from a service which had now\r\nbecome more hazardous than ever. Montrose made no remonstrance, but\r\nwith looks of high disdain which betrayed the inward workings of\r\na proud and unsubdued mind, indignant at being thus abandoned at\r\nsuch a dangerous crisis, readily complied with the request of every\r\nman who asked permission to retire. The Earl of Airly, now sixty\r\nyears of age and in precarious health, and his two sons, Sir Thomas\r\nand Sir David Ogilvie, out of all the Lowlanders, alone remained\r\nfaithful to Montrose, and could, on no account, be prevailed upon to\r\nabandon him. Among others who left Montrose on this occasion, was\r\nSir Nathaniel Gordon, who, it is said, went over to Argyle’s camp in\r\nconsequence of a concerted plan between him and Montrose, for the\r\npurpose of detaching Lewis Gordon from the cause of the Covenanters,\r\na conjecture which seems to have originated in the subsequent conduct\r\nof Sir Nathaniel and Lord Lewis, who joined Montrose the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMontrose, now abandoned by all his Lowland friends, prepared for his\r\nmarch, preparatory to which he sent off his baggage as formerly; and\r\nafter lighting some fires for the purpose of deceiving the enemy,\r\ntook his departure on the evening of the 6th of November, and arrived\r\nabout break of day at Balveny. After remaining a few days there to\r\nrefresh his men, he proceeded through Badenoch, and descended by\r\nrapid marches into Athole, where he was joined by Macdonald and John\r\nMuidartach, the captain of the Clanranald, the latter of whom brought\r\n500 of his men along with him. He was also reinforced by some small\r\nparties from the neighbouring Highlands, whom Macdonald had induced\r\nto follow him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Argyle, after giving orders to his Highlanders to\r\nreturn home, went himself to Edinburgh, where he “got but small\r\nthanks for his service against Montrose.”[273] Although the Committee\r\nof Estates, out of deference, approved of his conduct, which some of\r\nhis flatterers considered deserving of praise because he “had shed no\r\nblood;”[274] yet the majority had formed a very different estimate of\r\nhis character, during a campaign which had been fruitful neither of\r\nglory nor victory. Confident of success, the heads of the Covenanters\r\nlooked upon the first efforts of Montrose in the light of a desperate\r\nand forlorn attempt, rashly and inconsiderately undertaken, and\r\nwhich they expected would be speedily put down; but the results of\r\nthe battles of Tippermuir, Aberdeen, and Fyvie, gave a new direction\r\nto their thoughts, and the royalists, hitherto contemned, began now\r\nto be dreaded and respected. In allusion to the present “posture of\r\naffairs,” it is observed by Guthry, that “many who had formerly been\r\nviolent, began to talk moderately of business, and what was most\r\ntaken notice of, was the lukewarmness of many amongst the ministry,\r\nwho now in their preaching had begun to abate much of their former\r\nzeal.”[275] The early success of Montrose had indeed caused some\r\nmisgivings in the minds of the Covenanters; but as they all hoped\r\nthat Argyle would change the tide of war, they showed no disposition\r\nto relax in their severities towards those who were suspected of\r\nfavouring the cause of the king. The signal failure, however, of\r\nArgyle’s expedition, and his return to the capital, quite changed,\r\nas we have seen, the aspect of affairs, and many of those who had\r\nbeen most sanguine in their calculations regarding the result of the\r\nstruggle, began now to waver and to doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile Argyle was passing his time in Edinburgh, Montrose was\r\nmeditating a terrible blow at Argyle himself to revenge the cruelties\r\nhe had exercised upon the royalists, and to give confidence to the\r\nclans in Argyle’s neighbourhood. These had been hitherto prevented\r\nfrom joining Montrose’s standard from a dread of Argyle, who having\r\nalways a body of 5,000 or 6,000 Highlanders at command, had kept\r\nthem in such complete subjection that they dared not, without the\r\nrisk of absolute ruin, espouse the cause of their sovereign. The\r\nidea of curbing the power of a haughty and domineering chief whose\r\nword was a law to the inhabitants of an extensive district, ready to\r\nobey his cruel mandates at all times, and the spirit of revenge, the\r\npredominating characteristic of the clans, smoothed the difficulties\r\nwhich presented themselves in invading a country made almost\r\ninaccessible by nature, and rendered still more unapproachable by\r\nthe severities of winter. The determination of Montrose having thus\r\nmet with a willing response in the breasts of his men, he lost no\r\ntime in putting them in motion. Dividing his army into two parts, he\r\nhimself marched with the main body, consisting of the Irish and the\r\nAthole-men, to Loch Tay, whence he proceeded through Breadalbane.\r\nThe other body, composed of the clan Donald and other Highlanders,\r\nhe despatched by a different route, with instructions to meet him\r\nat an assigned spot on the borders of Argyle. The country through\r\nwhich both divisions passed, being chiefly in possession of Argyle’s\r\nkinsmen or dependants, was laid waste, particularly the lands of\r\nCampbell of Glenorchy.\r\n\r\nWhen Argyle heard of the ravages committed by Montrose’s army on the\r\nlands of his kinsmen, he hastened home from Edinburgh to his castle\r\nat Inverary, and gave orders for the assembling of his clan, either\r\nto repel any attack that might be made on his own country, or to\r\nprotect his friends from future aggression. It is by no means certain\r\nthat he anticipated an invasion from Montrose, particularly at such a\r\nseason of the year, and he seemed to imagine himself so secure from\r\nattack, owing to the intricacy of the passes leading into Argyle,\r\nthat although a mere handful of men could have effectually opposed\r\nan army much larger than that of Montrose, he took no precautions to\r\nguard them. So important indeed did he himself consider these passes\r\nto be, that he had frequently declared that he would rather forfeit\r\na hundred thousand crowns, than that an enemy should know the passes\r\nby which an armed force could penetrate into Argyle.[276]\r\n\r\nWhile thus reposing in fancied security in his impregnable\r\nstronghold, and issuing his mandates for levying his forces, some\r\nshepherds arrived in great terror from the hills, and brought him\r\nthe alarming intelligence that the enemy, whom he had imagined were\r\nabout a hundred miles distant, were within two miles of his own\r\ndwelling. Terrified at the unexpected appearance of Montrose, whose\r\nvengeance he justly dreaded, he had barely self-possession left to\r\nconcert measures for his own personal safety, by taking refuge on\r\nboard a fishing boat in Loch Fyne, in which he sought his way to the\r\nLowlands, leaving his people and country exposed to the merciless\r\nwill of an enemy thirsting for revenge. The inhabitants of Argyle\r\nbeing thus abandoned by their chief, made no attempt to oppose\r\nMontrose, who, the more effectually to carry his plan for pillaging\r\nand ravaging the country into execution, divided his army into three\r\nparties, under the respective orders of the captain of clan Ranald,\r\nMacdonald, and himself. For upwards of six weeks, viz., from the 13th\r\nof December, 1644, till nearly the end of January following, these\r\ndifferent bodies traversed the whole country without molestation,\r\nburning, wasting, and destroying every thing which came within their\r\nreach. Nor were the people themselves spared, for although it is\r\nmentioned by one writer that Montrose “shed no blood in regard that\r\nall the people (following their lord’s laudable example) delivered\r\nthemselves by flight also,”[277] it is evident from several\r\ncontemporary authors that the slaughter must have been immense.[278]\r\nIn fact, before the end of January, the face of a single male\r\ninhabitant was not to be seen throughout the whole extent of Argyle\r\nand Lorn, the whole population having been either driven out of these\r\ndistricts, or taken refuge in dens and caves known only to themselves.\r\n\r\nHaving thus retaliated upon Argyle and his people in a tenfold degree\r\nthe miseries which he had occasioned in Lochaber and the adjoining\r\ncountries, Montrose left Argyle and Lorn, passing through Glencoe\r\nand Lochaber on his way to Lochness. On his march eastwards he was\r\njoined by the laird of Abergeldie, the Farquharsons of the Braes of\r\nMar, and by a party of the Gordons. The object of Montrose, by this\r\nmovement, was to seize Inverness, which was then protected by only\r\ntwo regiments, in the expectation that its capture would operate as a\r\nstimulus to the northern clans, who had not yet declared themselves.\r\nThis resolution was by no means altered on reaching the head of\r\nLochness, where he learned that the Earl of Seaforth was advancing\r\nto meet him with an army of 5,000 horse and foot, which he resolved\r\nto encounter, it being composed, with the exception of two regular\r\nregiments, of raw and undisciplined levies.\r\n\r\nWhile proceeding, however, through Abertarf, a person arrived in\r\ngreat haste at Kilcummin, the present fort Augustus, who brought\r\nhim the surprising intelligence that Argyle had entered Lochaber\r\nwith an army of 3,000 men; that he was burning and laying waste\r\nthe country, and that his head-quarters were at the old castle of\r\nInverlochy. After Argyle had effected his escape from Inverary, he\r\nhad gone to Dumbarton, where he remained till Montrose’s departure\r\nfrom his territory. While there, a body of covenanting troops who\r\nhad served in England, arrived under the command of Major-general\r\nBaillie, for the purpose of assisting Argyle in expelling Montrose\r\nfrom his bounds; but on learning that Montrose had left Argyle,\r\nand was marching through Glencoe and Lochaber, General Baillie\r\ndetermined to lead his army in an easterly direction through the\r\nLowlands, with the intention of intercepting Montrose, should he\r\nattempt a descent. At the same time it was arranged between Baillie\r\nand Argyle that the latter, who had now recovered from his panic in\r\nconsequence of Montrose’s departure, should return to Argyle and\r\ncollect his men from their hiding-places and retreats. As it was\r\nnot improbable, however, that Montrose might renew his visit, the\r\nCommittee of Estates allowed Baillie to place 1,100 of his soldiers\r\nat the disposal of Argyle, who, as soon as he was able to muster his\r\nmen, was to follow Montrose’s rear, yet so as to avoid an engagement,\r\ntill Baillie, who, on hearing of Argyle’s advance into Lochaber,\r\nwas to march suddenly across the Grampians, should attack Montrose\r\nin front. To assist him in levying and organizing his clan, Argyle\r\ncalled over Campbell of Auchinbreck, his kinsman, from Ireland, who\r\nhad considerable reputation as a military commander. In terms of\r\nhis instructions, therefore, Argyle had entered Lochaber, and had\r\nadvanced as far as Inverlochy, when, as we have seen, the news of his\r\narrival was brought to Montrose.\r\n\r\nMontrose was at first almost disinclined, from the well-known\r\nreputation of Argyle, to credit this intelligence, but being fully\r\nassured of its correctness from the apparent sincerity of his\r\ninformer, he lost not a moment in making up his mind as to the course\r\nhe should pursue. He might have instantly marched back upon Argyle\r\nby the route he had just followed; but as the latter would thus get\r\ndue notice of his approach, and prepare himself for the threatened\r\ndanger, Montrose resolved upon a different plan. The design he\r\nconceived could only have originated in the mind of such a bold\r\nand enterprising commander as Montrose, before whose daring genius\r\ndifficulties hitherto deemed insurmountable at once disappeared.\r\nThe idea of carrying an army over dangerous and precipitous\r\nmountains, whose wild and frowning aspect seemed to forbid the\r\napproach of human footsteps, and in the middle of winter, too, when\r\nthe formidable perils of the journey were greatly increased by the\r\nsnow, however chimerical it might have seemed to other men, appeared\r\nquite practicable to Montrose, whose sanguine anticipations of the\r\nadvantages to be derived from such an extraordinary exploit, more\r\nthan counterbalanced, in his mind, the risks to be encountered.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the place where Montrose received the news of\r\nArgyle’s arrival and Inverlochy is about thirty miles; but this\r\ndistance was considerably increased by the devious track which\r\nMontrose followed. Marching along the small river Tarf in a southerly\r\ndirection, he crossed the hills of Lairie Thierard, passed through\r\nGlenroy, and after traversing the range of mountains between the Glen\r\nand Ben Nevis, he arrived in Glennevis before Argyle had the least\r\nnotice of his approach. Before setting out on his march, Montrose\r\nhad taken the wise precaution of placing guards upon the common road\r\nleading to Inverlochy, to prevent intelligence of his movements being\r\ncarried to Argyle, and he had killed such of Argyle’s scouts as he\r\nhad fallen in with in the course of his march. This fatiguing and\r\nunexampled journey had been performed in little more than a night and\r\na day, and when, in the course of the evening, Montrose’s men arrived\r\nin Glennevis, they found themselves so weary and exhausted that they\r\ncould not venture to attack the enemy. They therefore lay under arms\r\nall night, and refreshed themselves as they best could till next\r\nmorning. As the night was uncommonly clear, it being moonlight, the\r\nadvanced posts of both armies kept up a small fire of musketry, which\r\nled to no result.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Argyle, after committing his army to the charge of\r\nhis cousin, Campbell of Auchinbreck, with his customary prudence,\r\nwent, during the night, on board a boat in the loch, excusing himself\r\nfor this apparent pusillanimous act by alleging his incapacity to\r\nenter the field of battle in consequence of some contusions he had\r\nreceived by a fall two or three weeks before; but his enemies averred\r\nthat cowardice was the real motive which induced him to take refuge\r\nin his galley, from which he witnessed the defeat and destruction\r\nof his army. This somewhat suspicious action of Argyle--and it was\r\nnot the only time he provided for his personal safety in a similar\r\nmanner--is accounted for in the following (? ironical) way by the\r\nauthor of _Britane’s Distemper_ (p. 100):--\r\n\r\n“In this confusion, the commanders of there armie lightes wpon\r\nthis resolution, not to hazart the marquisse owne persone; for it\r\nseems not possible that Ardgylle himselfe, being a nobleman of such\r\neminent qualitie, a man of so deepe and profund judgement, one that\r\nknew so weell what belongeth to the office of a generall, that any\r\nbasse motion of feare, I say, could make him so wnsensible of the\r\npoynt of honour as is generally reported. Nether will I, for my owne\r\npairt, belieue it; but I am confident that those barrones of his\r\nkinred, wha ware captanes and commanderes of the armie, feareing the\r\neuent of this battelle, for diuers reasones; and one was, that Allan\r\nM’Collduie, ane old fox, and who was thought to be a seer, had told\r\nthem that there should be a battell lost there by them that came\r\nfirst to seike battell; this was one cause of there importunitie with\r\nhim that he should not come to battell that day; for they sawe that\r\nof necessitie they most feght, and would not hazart there cheife\r\npersone, urgeing him by force to reteire to his galay, which lay\r\nhard by, and committe the tryall of the day to them; he, it is to be\r\nthought, with great difficultie yeelding to there request, leaues\r\nhis cusine, the laird of Auchinbreike, a most walorous and braue\r\ngentleman, to the generall commande of the armie, and takes with\r\nhimselfe only sir James Rollocke, his brother in lawe, sir Jhone\r\nWachope of Nithrie, Mr. Mungo Law, a preacher. It is reported those\r\ntwo last was send from Edinburgh with him to beare witnesse of the\r\nexpulsion of those rebelles, for so they ware still pleased to terme\r\nthe Royalistes.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear that it was not until the morning of the battle that\r\nArgyle’s men were aware that it was the army of Montrose that was so\r\nnear them, as they considered it quite impossible that he should have\r\nbeen able to bring his forces across the mountains; they imagined\r\nthat the body before them consisted of some of the inhabitants of\r\nthe country, who had collected to defend their properties. But they\r\nwere undeceived when, in the dawn of the morning, the warlike sound\r\nof Montrose’s trumpets, resounding through the glen where they lay,\r\nand reverberating from the adjoining hills, broke upon their ears.\r\nThis served as the signal to both armies to prepare for battle.\r\nMontrose drew out his army in an extended line. The right wing\r\nconsisted of a regiment of Irish, under the command of Macdonald,\r\nhis major-general; the centre was composed of the Athole-men, the\r\nStuarts of Appin, the Macdonalds of Glencoe, and other Highlanders,\r\nseverally under the command of Clanranald, M’Lean, and Glengary; and\r\nthe left wing consisted of some Irish, at the head of whom was the\r\nbrave Colonel O’Kean. A body of Irish was placed behind the main body\r\nas a reserve, under the command of Colonel James M’Donald, alias\r\nO’Neill. The general of Argyle’s army formed it in a similar manner.\r\nThe Lowland forces were equally divided, and formed the wings,\r\nbetween which the Highlanders were placed. Upon a rising ground,\r\nbehind this line, General Campbell drew up a reserve of Highlanders,\r\nand placed a field-piece. Within the house of Inverlochy, which was\r\nonly about a pistol-shot from the place where the army was formed,\r\nhe planted a body of 40 or 50 men to protect the place, and to\r\nannoy Montrose’s men with discharges of musketry.[279] The account\r\ngiven by Gordon of Sallagh, that Argyle had transported the half\r\nof his army over the water at Inverlochy, under the command of\r\nAuchinbreck, and that Montrose defeated this division, while Argyle\r\nwas prevented from relieving it with the other division, from the\r\nintervening of “an arm of the sea, that was interjected betwixt them\r\nand him,”[280] is probably erroneous, for the circumstance is not\r\nmentioned by any other writer of the period, and it is well known,\r\nthat Argyle abandoned his army, and witnessed its destruction from\r\nhis galley,--circumstances which Gordon altogether overlooks.\r\n\r\nIt was at sunrise, on Sunday, the 2d of February, 1645, that\r\nMontrose, after having formed his army in battle array, gave orders\r\nto his men to advance upon the enemy. The left wing of Montrose’s\r\narmy, under the command of O’Kean, was the first to commence the\r\nattack, by charging the enemy’s right. This was immediately followed\r\nby a furious assault upon the centre and left wing of Argyle’s army,\r\nby Montrose’s right wing and centre. Argyle’s right wing not being\r\nable to resist the attack of Montrose’s left, turned about and fled,\r\nwhich circumstance had such a discouraging effect on the remainder\r\nof Argyle’s troops, that after discharging their muskets, the whole\r\nof them, including the reserve, took to their heels. The rout now\r\nbecame general. An attempt was made by a body of about 200 of the\r\nfugitives, to throw themselves into the castle of Inverlochy, but a\r\nparty of Montrose’s horse prevented them. Some of the flying enemy\r\ndirected their course along the side of Loch-Eil, but all these\r\nwere either killed or drowned in the pursuit. The greater part,\r\nhowever, fled towards the hills in the direction of Argyle, and were\r\npursued by Montrose’s men, to the distance of about eight miles. As\r\nno resistance was made by the defeated party in their flight, the\r\ncarnage was very great, being reckoned at 1,500 men. Many more would\r\nhave been cut off had it not been for the humanity of Montrose, who\r\ndid every thing in his power to save the unresisting enemy from\r\nthe fury of his men, who were not disposed to give quarter to the\r\nunfortunate Campbells. Having taken the castle, Montrose not only\r\ntreated the officers, who were from the Lowlands, with kindness, but\r\ngave them their liberty on parole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inverlochy Castle.--From M’Culloch’s celebrated\r\npicture in the Edinburgh National Gallery.]\r\n\r\nAmong the principal persons who fell on Argyle’s side, were the\r\ncommander, Campbell of Auchinbreck, Campbell of Lochnell, the eldest\r\nson of Lochnell, and his brother, Colin; M’Dougall of Rara and his\r\neldest son; Major Menzies, brother to the laird, (or Prior as he\r\nwas called) of Achattens Parbreck; and the provost of the church of\r\nKilmun. The loss on the side of Montrose was extremely trifling.\r\nThe number of wounded is indeed not stated, but he had only three\r\nprivates killed. He sustained, however, a severe loss in Sir Thomas\r\nOgilvie, son of the Earl of Airly, who died a few days after the\r\nbattle, of a wound he received in the thigh. Montrose regretted\r\nthe death of this steadfast friend and worthy man, with feelings\r\nof real sorrow, and caused his body to be interred in Athole with\r\ndue solemnity.[281] Montrose immediately after the battle sent a\r\nmessenger to the king with a letter, giving an account of it, at\r\nthe conclusion of which he exultingly says to Charles, “Give me\r\nleave, after I have reduced this country, and conquered from Dan\r\nto Beersheba, to say to your Majesty, as David’s general to his\r\nmaster, Come thou thyself, lest this country be called by my name.”\r\nWhen the king received this letter, the royal and parliamentary\r\ncommissioners were sitting at Uxbridge negotiating the terms of a\r\npeace; but Charles, induced by the letter, imprudently broke off the\r\nnegotiation, a circumstance which led to his ruin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] Wishart, p. 84.--Stewart’s descendant, the late Robert Stewart\r\nof Ardvoirlich, gives an account of the above incident, founded\r\non a “constant tradition in the family,” tending to show that his\r\nancestor was not so much a man of base and treacherous character, as\r\nof “violent passions and singular temper.” James Stewart, it is said,\r\nwas so irritated at the Irish, for committing some excesses on lands\r\nbelonging to him, that he challenged their commander, Macdonald, to\r\nsingle combat. By advice of Kilpont, Montrose arrested both, and\r\nbrought about a seeming conciliation. When encamped at Collace,\r\nMontrose gave an entertainment to his officers, on returning from\r\nwhich Ardvoirlich, “heated with drink, began to blame Kilpont for the\r\npart he had taken in preventing his obtaining redress, and reflecting\r\nagainst Montrose for not allowing him what he considered proper\r\nreparation. Kilpont, of course, defended the conduct of himself and\r\nhis relative, Montrose, till their argument came to high words, and\r\nfinally, from the state they were both in, by an easy transition, to\r\nblows, when Ardvoirlich, with his dirk, struck Kilpont dead on the\r\nspot.” He fled, leaving his eldest son, Henry, mortally wounded at\r\nTippermuir, on his death-bed.--Introd. to _Legend of Montrose_.\r\n\r\n[263] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 405.\r\n\r\n[264] Wishart, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[265] Spalding, vol. ii. 407.\r\n\r\n[266] Memoirs, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[267] Wishart, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[268] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 414.\r\n\r\n[269] Idem.\r\n\r\n[270] Guthry, p. 231.\r\n\r\n[271] Wishart, p. 100.\r\n\r\n[272] Wishart, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[273] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 287.\r\n\r\n[274] Guthry, p. 134.\r\n\r\n[275] Memoirs, pp. 134-5.\r\n\r\n[276] Wishart, p. 107.\r\n\r\n[277] Guthry, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[278] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 442; Wishart, p. 108--_Red Book of\r\nClanranald_.\r\n\r\n[279] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 444.\r\n\r\n[280] _Continuation_, p. 522.\r\n\r\n[281] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 445.--Wishart, p. 111, et seq.--Guthry,\r\np. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA.D.

They\r\nhad, no doubt, begun to fear, before that event, and, of course, to\r\nrespect the prowess of Montrose, but they never could have been made\r\nto believe that, within the space of a few days, a well-appointed\r\narmy, composed in part of veteran troops, would have been utterly\r\ndefeated by a force so vastly inferior in point of numbers, and\r\nbeset with difficulties and dangers to which the army of Argyle\r\nwas not exposed. Nor were the fears of the Estates much allayed by\r\nthe appearance of Argyle, who arrived at Edinburgh to give them an\r\naccount of the affair, “having his left arm tied up in a scarf, as if\r\nhe had been at bones-breaking.”[282] It is true that Lord Balmerino\r\nmade a speech before the assembly of the Estates, in which he\r\naffirmed, that the great loss reported to be sustained at Inverlochy\r\n“was but the invention of the malignants, who spake as they wished,”\r\nand that “upon his honour, not more than thirty of Argyle’s men\r\nhad been killed;”[283] but as the disaster was well known, this\r\ndevice only misled the weak and ignorant. Had Montrose at this\r\njuncture descended into the Lowlands, it is not improbable that his\r\npresence might have given a favourable turn to the state of matters\r\nin the south, where the king’s affairs were in the most precarious\r\nsituation; but such a design does not seem to have accorded with his\r\nviews of prolonging the contest in the Highlands, which were more\r\nsuitable than the Lowlands to his plan of operations, and to the\r\nnature of his forces.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after allowing his men to refresh themselves a few days\r\nat Inverlochy, Montrose returned across the mountains of Lochaber\r\ninto Badenoch, “with displayed banner.” Marching down the south\r\nside of the Spey, he crossed that river at Balchastel, and entered\r\nMoray without opposition. He proceeded by rapid strides towards the\r\ntown of Inverness, which he intended to take possession of; but, on\r\narriving in the neighbourhood, he found it garrisoned by the laird\r\nof Lawers’ and Buchanan’s regiments. As he did not wish to consume\r\nhis time in a siege, he immediately altered his course and marched\r\nin the direction of Elgin, issuing, as he went along, a proclamation\r\nin the king’s name, calling upon all males, from 16 to 60 years of\r\nage, to join him immediately, armed as they best could, on foot or\r\non horse, and that under pain of fire and sword, as rebels to the\r\nking. In consequence of this threat Montrose was joined by some of\r\nthe Moray-men, including the laird of Grant and 200 of his followers;\r\nand, to show an example of severity, he plundered the houses and laid\r\nwaste the estates of many of the principal gentlemen of the district,\r\ncarrying off, at the same time, a large quantity of cattle and\r\neffects, and destroying the boats and nets which they fell in with on\r\nthe Spey.[284]\r\n\r\nWhilst Montrose was thus laying waste part of Moray, a committee of\r\nthe Estates, consisting of the Earl of Seaforth, the laird of Innes,\r\nSir Robert Gordon, the laird of Pluscardine, and others, was sitting\r\nat Elgin; these, on hearing of his proceedings, prohibited the\r\nholding of the fair which was kept there annually on Fasten’s eve,\r\nand to which many merchants and others in the north resorted, lest\r\nthe property brought there for sale might fall a prey to Montrose’s\r\narmy. They, at the same time, sent Sir Robert Gordon, Mackenzie of\r\nPluscardine, and Innes of Luthers, to treat with Montrose, in name\r\nof the gentry of Moray, most of whom were then assembled in Elgin;\r\nbut he refused to enter into any negotiation, offering, at the same\r\ntime, to accept of the services of such as would join him and obey\r\nhim as the king’s lieutenant.[285] Before this answer had been\r\ncommunicated to the gentry at Elgin, they had all fled from the town\r\nin consequence of hearing that Montrose was advancing upon them with\r\nrapidity. The laird of Innes, along with some of his friends, retired\r\nto the castle of Spynie, possessed by his eldest son, which was well\r\nfortified and provided with every necessary for undergoing a siege.\r\nThe laird of Duffus went into Sutherland. As soon as the inhabitants\r\nof the town saw the committee preparing to leave it, most of them\r\nalso resolved to depart, which they did, carrying along with them\r\ntheir principal effects. Some went to Inverness, and others into\r\nRoss, but the greater part went to the castle of Spynie, where they\r\nsought and obtained refuge.\r\n\r\nApprehensive that Montrose might follow up the dreadful example he\r\nhad shown, by burning the town, a proposal was made to, and accepted\r\nby him, to pay four thousand merks to save the town from destruction;\r\nbut, on entering it, which he did on the 19th of February, his men,\r\nand particularly the laird of Grant’s party, were so disappointed\r\nin their hopes of plunder, in consequence of the inhabitants having\r\ncarried away the best of their effects, that they destroyed every\r\narticle of furniture which was left.\r\n\r\nMontrose was joined, on his arrival at Elgin, by Lord Gordon, the\r\neldest son of the Marquis of Huntly, with some of his friends and\r\nvassals. This young nobleman had been long kept in a state of durance\r\nby Argyle, his uncle, contrary to his own wishes, and now, when an\r\nopportunity had for the first time occurred, he showed the bent of\r\nhis inclination by declaring for the king.\r\n\r\nOn taking possession of Elgin, Montrose gave orders to bring all\r\nthe ferry-boats on the Spey to the north side of the river, and\r\nhe stationed sentinels at all the fords up and down, to watch any\r\nmovements which might be made by the enemies’ forces in the south.\r\n\r\nMontrose, thereupon, held a council of war, at which it was\r\ndetermined to cross the Spey, march into the counties of Banff and\r\nAberdeen, by the aid of Lord Gordon, raise the friends and retainers\r\nof the Marquis of Huntly, and thence proceed into the Mearns, where\r\nanother accession of forces was expected. Accordingly, Montrose left\r\nElgin on the 4th of March with the main body of his army, towards\r\nthe Bog of Gicht, accompanied by the Earl of Seaforth, Sir Robert\r\nGordon, the lairds of Grant, Pluscardine, Findrassie, and several\r\nother gentlemen who “had come in to him” at Elgin. To punish the\r\nEarl of Findlater, who had refused to join him, Montrose sent the\r\nFarquharsons of Braemar before him, across the Spey, who plundered,\r\nwithout mercy, the town of Cullen, belonging to the earl.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Spey, Montrose, either apprehensive that\r\ndepredations would be committed upon the properties of his Moray\r\nfriends who accompanied him, by the two regiments which garrisoned\r\nInverness, and the Covenanters of that district, or having received\r\nnotice to that effect, he allowed the Earl of Seaforth, the laird\r\nof Grant, and the other Moray gentlemen, to return home to defend\r\ntheir estates; but before allowing them to depart, he made them\r\ntake a solemn oath of allegiance to the king, and promise that they\r\nshould never henceforth take up arms against his majesty or his loyal\r\nsubjects. At the same time, he made them come under an engagement\r\nto join him with all their forces as soon as they could do so. The\r\nEarl of Seaforth, however, disregarded his oath, and again joined the\r\nranks of the Covenanters. In a letter which he wrote to the committee\r\nof Estates at Aberdeen, he stated that he had yielded to Montrose\r\nthrough fear only, and he avowed that he would abide by “the good\r\ncause to his death.”[286]\r\n\r\nOn Montrose’s arrival at Strathbogie, or Gordon castle, Lord Graham,\r\nhis eldest son, a most promising youth of sixteen, became unwell, and\r\ndied after a few days’ illness. The loss of a son who had followed\r\nhim in his campaigns, and shared with him the dangers of the field,\r\nwas a subject of deep regret to Montrose. While Montrose was occupied\r\nat the death-bed of his son, Lord Gordon was busily employed among\r\nthe Gordons, out of whom he speedily raised a force of about 500\r\nfoot, and 160 horse.\r\n\r\nWith this accession to his forces, Montrose left Strathbogie and\r\nmarched towards Banff, on his route to the south. In passing by the\r\nhouse of Cullen, in Boyne, the seat of the Earl of Findlater, who had\r\nfled to Edinburgh, and left the charge of the house to the countess,\r\na party of Montrose’s men entered the house, which they plundered\r\nof all its valuable contents. They then proceeded to set the house\r\non fire, but the countess entreated Montrose to order his men to\r\ndesist, and promised that if her husband did not come to Montrose\r\nand give him satisfaction within fifteen days, she would pay him\r\n20,000 merks, of which sum she instantly paid down 5,000. Montrose\r\ncomplied with her request, and also spared the lands, although the\r\nearl was “a great Covenanter.” Montrose’s men next laid waste the\r\nlands in the Boyne, burnt the houses, and plundered the minister of\r\nthe place of all his goods and effects, including his books. The\r\nlaird of Boyne shut himself up in his stronghold, the Crag, where he\r\nwas out of danger; but he had the misfortune to see his lands laid\r\nwaste and destroyed. Montrose then went to Banff, which he gave up\r\nto indiscriminate plunder. His troops did not leave a vestige of\r\nmoveable property in the town, and they even stripped to the skin\r\nevery man they met with in the streets. They also burned two or three\r\nhouses of little value, but not a drop of blood was shed.\r\n\r\nFrom Banff Montrose proceeded to Turriff, where a deputation from\r\nthe town council of Aberdeen waited upon him, to represent the\r\nmany miseries which the loyal city had suffered from its frequent\r\noccupation by hostile armies since the first outbreaking of the\r\nunfortunate troubles which molested the kingdom. They further\r\nrepresented, that such was the terror of the inhabitants at the idea\r\nof another visit from his Irish troops, that all the men and women,\r\non hearing of his approach, had made preparations for abandoning the\r\ntown, and that they would certainly leave it if they did not get an\r\nassurance from the marquis of safety and protection. Montrose heard\r\nthe commissioners patiently, expressed his regret at the calamities\r\nwhich had befallen their town, and bade them not be afraid, as he\r\nwould take care that none of his foot, or Irish, soldiers should\r\ncome within eight miles of Aberdeen; and that if he himself should\r\nenter the town, he would support himself at his own expense. The\r\ncommissioners returned to Aberdeen, and related the successful issue\r\nof their journey, to the great joy of all the inhabitants.[287]\r\n\r\nWhilst Montrose lay at Turriff, Sir Nathaniel Gordon, with some\r\ntroopers, went to Aberdeen, which he entered on Sunday, the 9th\r\nof March, on which day there had been “no sermon in either of the\r\nAberdeens,” as the ministers had fled the town. The keys of the\r\nchurches, gates, and jail were delivered to him by the magistrates.\r\nThe following morning Sir Nathaniel was joined by 100 Irish dragoons.\r\nAfter releasing some prisoners, he went to Torry, and took, after a\r\nslight resistance, 1,800 muskets, pikes, and other arms, which had\r\nbeen left in charge of a troop of horse. Besides receiving orders\r\nto watch the town, Sir Nathaniel was instructed to send out scouts\r\nas far as Cowie to watch the enemy, who were daily expected from\r\nthe south. When reconnoitring, a skirmish took place at the bridge\r\nof Dee, in which Captain Keith’s troop was routed. Finding the\r\ncountry quite clear, and no appearance of the covenanting forces,\r\nGordon returned back to the army, which had advanced to Frendraught.\r\nNo attempt was made upon the house of Frendraught, which was kept\r\nby the young viscount in absence of his father, who was then at\r\nMuchallis with his godson, Lord Fraser; but Montrose destroyed 60\r\nploughs of land belonging to Frendraught within the parishes of\r\nForgue, Inverkeithnie, and Drumblade, and the house of the minister\r\nof Forgue, with all the other houses, and buildings, and their\r\ncontents. Nothing, in fact, was spared. All the cattle, horses,\r\nsheep, and other domestic animals, were carried off, and the whole of\r\nFrendraught’s lands were left a dreary and uninhabitable waste.\r\n\r\nFrom Pennyburn, Montrose despatched, on the 10th of March, a letter\r\nto the authorities of Aberdeen, commanding them to issue an order\r\nthat all men, of whatever description, between the age of sixteen\r\nand sixty, should meet him equipped in their best arms, and such\r\nof them as had horses, mounted on the best of them, on the 15th of\r\nMarch, at his camp at Inverury, under the pain of fire and sword.\r\nIn consequence of this mandate he was joined by a considerable\r\nnumber of horse and foot. On the 12th of March, Montrose arrived at\r\nKintore, and took up his own quarters in the house of John Cheyne,\r\nthe minister of the place, whence he issued an order commanding\r\neach parish within the presbytery of Aberdeen, (with the exception\r\nof the town of Aberdeen,) to send to him two commissioners, who\r\nwere required to bring along with them a complete roll of the whole\r\nheritors, feuars, and liferenters of each parish. His object, in\r\nrequiring such a list, was to ascertain the number of men capable\r\nof serving, and also the names of those who should refuse to join\r\nhim. Commissioners were accordingly sent from the parishes, and the\r\nconsequence was, that Montrose was joined daily by many men who would\r\nnot otherwise have assisted him, but who were now alarmed for the\r\nsafety of their properties. While at Kintore, an occurrence took\r\nplace which vexed Montrose exceedingly.\r\n\r\nTo reconnoitre and watch the motions of the enemy, Montrose had,\r\non the 12th of March, sent Sir Nathaniel Gordon, along with Donald\r\nFarquharson, Captain Mortimer, and other well-mounted cavaliers, to\r\nthe number of about 80, to Aberdeen. This party, perceiving no enemy\r\nin the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, utterly neglected to place any\r\nsentinels at the gates of the town, and spent their time at their\r\nlodgings in entertainments and amusements. This careless conduct\r\ndid not pass unobserved by some of the Covenanters in the town,\r\nwho, it is said, sent notice thereof to Major-general Hurry, the\r\nsecond in command under General Baillie, who was then lying at the\r\nNorth Water Bridge with Lord Balcarras’s and other foot regiments.\r\nOn receiving this intelligence, Hurry put himself at the head of\r\n160 horse and foot, taken from the regular regiments, and some\r\ntroopers and musketeers, and rode off to Aberdeen in great haste,\r\nwhere he arrived on the 15th of March, at 8 o’clock in the evening.\r\nHaving posted sentinels at the gates to prevent any of Montrose’s\r\nparty from escaping, he entered the town at an hour when they\r\nwere all carelessly enjoying themselves in their lodgings, quite\r\nunapprehensive of such a visit. The noise in the streets, occasioned\r\nby the tramping of the horses, was the first indication they had\r\nof the presence of the enemy, but it was then too late for them to\r\ndefend themselves. Donald Farquharson was killed in the street,\r\nopposite the guard-house; “a brave gentleman,” says Spalding, “and\r\none of the noblest captains amongst all the Highlanders of Scotland,\r\nand the king’s man for life and death.” The enemy stripped him of\r\na rich dress he had put on the same day, and left his body lying\r\nnaked in the street. A few other gentlemen were killed, and some\r\ntaken prisoners, but the greater part escaped. Hurry left the town\r\nnext day, and, on his return to Baillie’s camp, entered the town\r\nof Montrose, and carried off Lord Graham, Montrose’s second son, a\r\nboy of fourteen years of age, then at school, who, along with his\r\nteacher, was sent to Edinburgh, and committed to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who had escaped from Aberdeen returned to Montrose, who\r\nwas greatly offended at them for their carelessness. The magistrates\r\nof Aberdeen, alarmed lest Montrose should inflict summary vengeance\r\nupon the town, as being implicated in the attack upon the cavaliers,\r\nsent two commissioners to Kintore to assure him that they were in\r\nno way concerned in that affair. Although he heard them with great\r\npatience, he gave them no satisfaction as to his intentions, and they\r\nreturned to Aberdeen without being able to obtain any promise from\r\nhim to spare the town. Montrose contented himself with making the\r\nmerchants furnish him with cloth, and gold and silver-lace, to the\r\namount of £10,000 Scots, for the use of his army, which he held the\r\nmagistrates bound to pay, by a tax upon the inhabitants. “Thus,” says\r\nSpalding, “cross upon cross upon Aberdeen.”\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Nathaniel Gordon and the remainder of his party returned\r\nto Kintore, Montrose despatched, on the same day (March 16th), a\r\nbody of 1,000 horse and foot, the latter consisting of Irish, to\r\nAberdeen, under the command of Macdonald, his major-general. Many of\r\nthe inhabitants, alarmed at the approach of this party, and still\r\nhaving the fear of the Irish before their eyes, were preparing\r\nto leave the town; but Macdonald relieved their apprehensions by\r\nassuring them that the Irish, who amounted to 700, should not enter\r\nthe town; he accordingly stationed them at the Bridge of Dee and the\r\nTwo Mile Cross, he and his troopers alone entering the town. With\r\nthe exception of the houses of one or two “remarkable Covenanters,”\r\nwhich were plundered, Macdonald showed the utmost respect for private\r\nproperty, a circumstance which obtained for him the esteem of the\r\ninhabitants, who had seldom experienced such kind treatment before.\r\n\r\nHaving discharged the last duties to the brave Farquharson and his\r\ncompanions, Macdonald left Aberdeen, on March 18th, to join Montrose\r\nat Durris; but he had not proceeded far when complaints were brought\r\nto him that some of his Irish troops, who had lagged behind, had\r\nentered the town, and were plundering it. Macdonald, therefore,\r\nreturned immediately to the town, and drove, says Spalding, “all\r\nthese rascals with sore skins out of the town before him.”[288]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Kintore, the Earl of Airly was attacked by a fever, in\r\nconsequence of which, Montrose sent him to Lethintie, the residence\r\nof the earl’s son-in-law, under a guard of 300 men; but he was\r\nafterwards removed to Strathbogie for greater security. On arriving,\r\nMarch 17th, at Durris, in Kincardineshire, where he was joined by\r\nMacdonald, Montrose burnt the house and offices to the ground, set\r\nfire to the grain, and swept away all the cattle, horses, and sheep.\r\nHe also wasted such of the lands of Fintry as belonged to Forbes of\r\nCraigievar, to punish him for the breach of his parole; treating\r\nin the same way the house and grain belonging to Abercrombie, the\r\nminister of Fintry, who was “a main Covenanter.” On the 19th,\r\nMontrose entered Stonehaven, and took up his residence in the\r\nhouse of James Clerk, the provost of the town. Here learning that\r\nthe Covenanters in the north were troubling Lord Gordon’s lands, he\r\ndespatched 500 of Gordon’s foot to defend Strathbogie and his other\r\npossessions; but he still retained Lord Gordon himself with his\r\ntroopers.\r\n\r\nOn the day after his arrival at Stonehaven, Montrose wrote a letter\r\nto the Earl Marshal, who, along with sixteen ministers, and some\r\nother persons of distinction, had shut himself up in his castle of\r\nDunottar. The bearer of the letter was not, however, suffered to\r\nenter within the gate, and was sent back, at the instigation probably\r\nof the earl’s lady and the ministers who were with him, without an\r\nanswer. Montrose then endeavoured, by means of George Keith, the\r\nEarl Marshal’s brother, to persuade the latter to declare for the\r\nking, but he refused, in consequence of which Montrose resolved to\r\ninflict summary vengeance upon him, by burning and laying waste his\r\nlands and those of his retainers in the neighbourhood. Acting upon\r\nthis determination, he, on the 21st of March, set fire to the houses\r\nadjoining the castle of Dunottar, and burnt the grain which was\r\nstacked in the barn-yards. Even the house of the minister did not\r\nescape. He next set fire to the town of Stonehaven, sparing only the\r\nhouse of the provost, in which he resided; plundered a ship which\r\nlay in the harbour, and then set her on fire, along with all the\r\nfishing boats. The lands and houses of Cowie shared the same hard\r\nfate. Whilst the work of destruction was going on, it is said that\r\nthe inhabitants appeared before the castle of Dunottar, and, setting\r\nup cries of pity, implored the earl to save them from ruin, but they\r\nreceived no answer to their supplications, and the earl witnessed\r\nfrom his stronghold the total destruction of the properties of his\r\ntenants and dependents without making any effort to stop it. After he\r\nhad effected the destruction of the barony of Dunottar, Montrose set\r\nfire to the lands of Fetteresso, one-fourth part of which was burnt\r\nup, together with the whole corn in the yards. A beautiful deer park\r\nwas also burnt, and its alarmed inmates were all taken and killed, as\r\nwell as all the cattle in the barony. Montrose next proceeded to\r\nDrumlaithie and Urie, belonging to John Forbes of Leslie, a leading\r\nCovenanter, where he committed similar depredations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dunottar Castle in the 17th century.--From Slezer’s\r\n_Theatrum Scotiæ_ (1693).]\r\n\r\nMontrose, on the following day, advanced to Fettercairn, where he\r\nquartered his foot soldiers, sending out quarter-masters through the\r\ncountry, and about the town of Montrose, to provide quarters for some\r\ntroopers; but, as these troopers were proceeding on their journey,\r\nthey were alarmed by the sudden appearance of some of Major-general\r\nHurry’s troops, who had concealed themselves within the plantation\r\nof Halkerton. These, suddenly issuing from the wood, set up a loud\r\nshout, on hearing which the troopers immediately turned to the right\r\nabout and went back to the camp. This party turned out to be a body\r\nof 600 horse, under the command of Hurry himself, who had left the\r\nhead-quarters of General Baillie, at Brechin, for the purpose of\r\nreconnoitring Montrose’s movements. In order to deceive Hurry, who\r\nkept advancing with his 600 horse, Montrose placed his horse, which\r\namounted only to 200, and which he took care to line with some expert\r\nmusqueteers, in a prominent situation, and concealed his foot in\r\nan adjoining valley. This _ruse_ had the desired effect, for Hurry\r\nimagining that there were no other forces at hand, immediately\r\nattacked the small body of horse opposed to him; but he was soon\r\nundeceived by the sudden appearance of the foot, and forced to\r\nretreat with precipitation. Though his men were greatly alarmed,\r\nHurry, who was a brave officer, having placed himself in the rear,\r\nmanaged to retreat across the North Esk with very little loss.\r\n\r\nAfter this affair Montrose allowed his men to refresh themselves for\r\na few days, and, on the 25th of March, put his army in motion in the\r\ndirection of Brechin. On hearing of his approach, the inhabitants of\r\nthe town concealed their effects in the castle, and in the steeples\r\nof churches, and fled. Montrose’s troops, although they found out the\r\nsecreted goods, were so enraged at the conduct of the inhabitants\r\nthat they plundered the town, and burnt about sixty houses.\r\n\r\nFrom Brechin, Montrose proceeded through Angus, with the intention\r\neither of fighting Baillie, or of marching onwards to the south. His\r\nwhole force, at this time, did not exceed 3,000 men, and, on reaching\r\nKirriemuir, his cavalry was greatly diminished by his having been\r\nobliged to send away about 160 horsemen to Strathbogie, under Lord\r\nGordon and his brother Lewis, to defend their father’s possessions\r\nagainst the Covenanters. Montrose proceeded with his army along the\r\nfoot of the Grampians, in the direction of Dunkeld, where he intended\r\nto cross the Tay in the sight of General Baillie, who commanded an\r\narmy greatly superior in numbers; but, although Montrose frequently\r\noffered him battle, Baillie, contrary, it is said, to the advice\r\nof Hurry, as often declined it. On arriving at the water of Isla,\r\nthe two armies, separated by that stream, remained motionless for\r\nseveral days, as if undetermined how to act. At length Montrose sent\r\na trumpeter to Baillie offering him battle; and as the water could\r\nnot be safely passed by his army if opposed, Montrose proposed to\r\nallow Baillie to pass it unmolested, on condition that he would give\r\nhim his word of honour that he would fight without delay; but Baillie\r\nanswered that he would attend to his own business himself, and that\r\nhe would fight when he himself thought proper. The conduct of Baillie\r\nthroughout seems altogether extraordinary, but it is alleged that he\r\nhad no power to act for himself, being subject to the directions of a\r\ncouncil of war, composed of the Earls of Crawford and Cassilis, Lords\r\nBalmerino, Kirkcudbright, and others.[289]\r\n\r\nAs Montrose could not attempt to cross the water of Isla without\r\ncavalry, in opposition to a force so greatly superior, he led\r\nhis army off in the direction of the Grampians, and marched upon\r\nDunkeld, of which he took possession. Baillie being fully aware of\r\nhis intention to cross the Tay, immediately withdrew to Perth for\r\nthe purpose of opposing Montrose’s passage; but, if Montrose really\r\nentertained such an intention after he had sent away the Gordon\r\ntroopers, he abandoned it after reaching Dunkeld, and resolved to\r\nretrace his steps northwards. Being anxious, however, to signalize\r\nhimself by some important achievement before he returned to the\r\nnorth, and to give confidence to the royalists, he determined to\r\nsurprise Dundee, a town which had rendered itself particularly\r\nobnoxious to him for the resistance made by the inhabitants after\r\nthe battle of Tippermuir. Having sent off the weaker part of his\r\ntroops, and those who were lightly armed, with his heavy baggage,\r\nalong the bottom of the hills with instructions to meet him at\r\nBrechin, Montrose himself, at the head of about 150 horse, and 600\r\nexpert musketeers,[290] left Dunkeld on April 3d about mid-night, and\r\nmarched with such extraordinary expedition that he arrived at Dundee\r\nLaw at 10 o’clock in the morning, where he encamped. Montrose then\r\nsent a trumpeter into the town with a summons requiring a surrender,\r\npromising that, in the event of compliance, he would protect the\r\nlives and properties of the inhabitants, but threatening, in case\r\nof refusal, to set fire to the town and put the inhabitants to the\r\nsword. Instead of returning an answer to this demand, the town’s\r\npeople put the messenger into prison. This insult was keenly felt by\r\nMontrose, who immediately gave orders to his troops to storm the town\r\nin three different places at once, and to fulfil the threat which\r\nhe had held out in case of resistance. The inhabitants, in the mean\r\ntime, made such preparations for defence as the shortness of the time\r\nallowed, but, although they fought bravely, they could not resist\r\nthe impetuosity of Montrose’s troops, who, impelled by a spirit of\r\nrevenge, and a thirst for plunder, which Dundee, then one of the\r\nlargest and most opulent towns in Scotland, offered them considerable\r\nopportunities of gratifying, forced the inhabitants from the stations\r\nthey occupied, and turned the cannon which they had planted in the\r\nstreets against themselves. The contest, however, continued in\r\nvarious quarters of the town for several hours, during which the town\r\nwas set on fire in different places. The whole of that quarter of the\r\ntown called the Bonnet Hill fell a prey to the flames, and the entire\r\ntown would have certainly shared the same fate had not Montrose’s\r\nmen chiefly occupied themselves in plundering the houses and filling\r\nthemselves with the contents of the wine cellars. The sack of the\r\ntown continued till the evening, and the inhabitants were subjected\r\nto every excess which an infuriated and victorious soldiery, maddened\r\nby intoxication, could inflict.\r\n\r\nThis melancholy state of things was, however, fortunately put an end\r\nto by intelligence having been brought to Montrose, who had viewed\r\nthe storming of the town from the neighbouring height of Dundee Law,\r\nthat General Baillie was marching in great haste down the Carse of\r\nGowrie, towards Dundee, with 3,000 foot and 800 horse. On receiving\r\nthis news from his scouts, Montrose gave immediate orders to his\r\ntroops to evacuate Dundee, but so intent were they upon their booty,\r\nthat it was with the utmost difficulty they could be prevailed upon\r\nto leave the town, and, before the last of them could be induced to\r\nretire, some of the enemy’s troops were within gun-shot of them.\r\nThe sudden appearance of Baillie’s army was quite unlooked-for, as\r\nMontrose had been made to believe, from the reports of his scouts,\r\nthat it had crossed the Tay, and was proceeding to the Forth, when,\r\nin fact, only a very small part, which had been mistaken by the\r\nscouts for the entire army of Baillie, had passed.\r\n\r\nIn this critical conjuncture, Montrose held a council of war, to\r\nconsult how to act under the perilous circumstances in which he was\r\nnow placed. The council was divided between two opinions. Some of\r\nthem advised Montrose to consult his personal safety, by riding off\r\nto the north with his horse, leaving the foot to their fate, as they\r\nconsidered it utterly impossible for him to carry them off in their\r\npresent state, fatigued, and worn out as they were by a march of 24\r\nmiles during the preceding night, and rendered almost incapable of\r\nresisting the enemy, from the debauch they had indulged in during\r\nthe day. Besides, they would require to march 20 or even 30 miles,\r\nbefore they could reckon themselves secure from the attacks of their\r\npursuers, a journey which it was deemed impossible to perform,\r\nwithout being previously allowed some hours repose. In this way, and\r\nin no other, urged the advocates of this view, might he expect to\r\nretrieve matters, as he could, by his presence among his friends in\r\nthe north, raise new forces; but that, if he himself was cut off, the\r\nking’s affairs would be utterly ruined. The other part of the council\r\ngave quite an opposite opinion, by declaring that, as the cause for\r\nwhich they had fought so gloriously was now irretrievably lost, they\r\nshould remain in their position, and await the issue of an attack,\r\njudging it more honourable to die fighting in defence of their\r\nking, than to seek safety in an ignominious flight, which would\r\nbe rendered still more disgraceful by abandoning their unfortunate\r\nfellow-warriors to the mercy of a revengeful foe.\r\n\r\nMontrose, however, disapproved of both these plans. He considered the\r\nfirst as unbecoming the generosity of men who had fought so often\r\nside by side; and the second he thought extremely rash and imprudent.\r\nHe, therefore, resolved to steer a middle course, and, refusing to\r\nabandon his brave companions in arms in the hour of danger, gave\r\norders for an immediate retreat, in the direction of Arbroath. This,\r\nhowever, was a mere manœuvre to deceive the enemy, as Montrose\r\nintended, after nightfall, to march towards the Grampians. In order\r\nto make his retreat more secure, Montrose despatched 400 of his\r\nfoot, and gave them orders to march as quickly as possible, without\r\nbreaking their ranks. These were followed by 200 of his most expert\r\nmusketeers, and Montrose himself closed the rear with his horse in\r\nopen rank, so as to admit the musketeers to interline them, in case\r\nof an attack. It was about six o’clock in the evening when Montrose\r\nbegan his retreat, at which hour the last of Baillie’s foot had\r\nreached Dundee.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Montrose begun to move, when intelligence was received\r\nby Baillie, from some prisoners he had taken, of Montrose’s\r\nintentions, which was now confirmed by ocular proof. A proposal, it\r\nis said, was then made by Hurry, to follow Montrose with the whole\r\narmy, and attack him, but Baillie rejected it; and the better, as he\r\nthought, to secure Montrose, and prevent his escape, he divided his\r\narmy into two parts, one of which he sent off in the direction of the\r\nGrampians, to prevent Montrose from entering the Highlands; and the\r\nother followed directly in the rear of Montrose. He thus expected\r\nto be able to cut off Montrose entirely, and to encourage his men\r\nto the pursuit, he offered a reward of 20,000 crowns to any one who\r\nshould bring him Montrose’s head. Baillie’s cavalry soon came up with\r\nMontrose’s rear, but they were so well received by the musketeers,\r\nwho brought down some of them, that they became very cautious in\r\ntheir approaches. The darkness of the night soon put an end to the\r\npursuit, and Montrose continued unmolested his march to Arbroath, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of which he arrived about midnight. His troops had\r\nnow marched upwards of 40 miles, 17 of which they had performed in\r\na few hours, in the face of a large army, and had passed two nights\r\nand a day without sleep; but as their safety might be endangered\r\nby allowing them to repose till daylight, Montrose entreated them\r\nto proceed on their march. Though almost exhausted with incessant\r\nfatigue, and over-powered with drowsiness, they readily obeyed the\r\norder of their general, and, after a short halt, proceeded on their\r\nroute in a northwesterly direction. They arrived at the South Esk\r\nearly in the morning, which they crossed, at sunrise, near Carriston\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\nMontrose now sent notice to the party which he had despatched from\r\nDunkeld to Brechin, with his baggage, to join him, but they had, on\r\nhearing of his retreat, already taken refuge among the neighbouring\r\nhills. Baillie, who had passed the night at Forfar, now considered\r\nthat he had Montrose completely in his power; but, to his utter\r\namazement, not a trace of Montrose was to be seen next morning.\r\nLittle did he imagine that Montrose had passed close by him during\r\nthe night, and eluded his grasp. Chagrined at this unexpected\r\ndisappointment, Baillie, without waiting for his foot, galloped off\r\nat full speed to overtake Montrose, and, with such celerity did he\r\ntravel, that he was close upon Montrose before the latter received\r\nnotice of his approach. The whole of Montrose’s men, with the\r\nexception of a few sentinels, were now stretched upon the ground,\r\nin a state of profound repose, and, so firmly did sleep hold their\r\nexhausted frames in its grasp, that it was with the utmost difficulty\r\nthat they could be aroused from their slumbers, or made sensible of\r\ntheir danger. The sentinels, it is said, had even to prick some of\r\nthem with their swords, before they could be awakened,[291] and when\r\nat length the sleepers were aroused they effected a retreat, after\r\nsome skirmishing, to the foot of the Grampians, about three miles\r\ndistant from their camp, and retired, thereafter, through Glenesk\r\ninto the interior without further molestation.\r\n\r\nThis memorable retreat is certainly one of the most extraordinary\r\nevents which occurred during the whole of Montrose’s campaigns. It\r\nis not surprising, that some of the most experienced officers in\r\nBritain, and in France and Germany, considered it the most splendid\r\nof all Montrose’s achievements.[292]\r\n\r\nBeing now secure from all danger in the fastnesses of the Grampians,\r\nMontrose allowed his men to refresh themselves for some days.\r\nWhilst enjoying this necessary relaxation from the fatigues of the\r\nfield, intelligence was brought to Montrose that a division of the\r\ncovenanting army, under Hurry, was in full march on Aberdeen, with an\r\nintention of proceeding into Moray. Judging that an attack upon the\r\npossessions of the Gordons would be one of Hurry’s objects, Montrose\r\ndespatched Lord Gordon with his horse to the north, for the purpose\r\nof assisting his friends in case of attack.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the nature of Montrose to remain inactive for any\r\nlength of time, and an occurrence, of which he had received notice,\r\nhad lately taken place, which determined him to return a second\r\ntime to Dunkeld. This was the escape of Viscount Aboyne, and some\r\nother noblemen and gentlemen, from Carlisle, who, he was informed,\r\nwere on their way north to join him. Apprehensive that they might\r\nbe interrupted by Baillie’s troops, he resolved to make a diversion\r\nin their favour, and, by drawing off the attention of Baillie,\r\nenable them the more effectually to elude observation. Leaving,\r\ntherefore, Macdonald, with about 200 men, to beat up the enemy in the\r\nneighbourhood of Coupar-Angus, Montrose proceeded, with the remainder\r\nof his forces, consisting only of 500 foot and 50 horse, to Dunkeld,\r\nwhence he marched to Crieff, which is about 17 miles west from Perth.\r\nIt was not until he had arrived at the latter town that Baillie,\r\nwho, after his pursuit of Montrose, had returned to Perth with his\r\narmy, heard of this movement. As Baillie was sufficiently aware of\r\nthe weakness of Montrose’s force, and as he was sure that, with such\r\na great disparity, Montrose would not risk a general engagement, he\r\nendeavoured to surprise him, in the hope either of cutting him off\r\nentirely, or crippling him so effectually as to prevent\r\nhim from again taking the field. He therefore left Perth during the\r\nnight of the 7th of April, with his whole army, consisting of 2,000\r\nfoot and 500 horse, with the intention of falling upon Montrose\r\nby break of day, before he should be aware of his presence; but\r\nMontrose’s experience had taught him the necessity of being always\r\nupon his guard when so near an enemy’s camp, and, accordingly, he\r\nhad drawn up his army, in anticipation of Baillie’s advance, in such\r\norder as would enable him either to give battle or retreat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he heard of Baillie’s approach, Montrose advanced with his\r\nhorse to reconnoitre, and having ascertained the enemy’s strength and\r\nnumbers, which were too formidable to be encountered with his little\r\nband, brave as they were, he gave immediate orders to his foot to\r\nretreat with speed up Strathearn, and to retire into the adjoining\r\npasses. To prevent them from being harassed in their retreat by the\r\nenemy’s cavalry, Montrose covered their rear with his small body of\r\nhorse, sustaining a very severe attack, which he warmly repulsed.\r\nAfter a march of about eight miles, Montrose’s troops arrived at\r\nthe pass of Strathearn, of which they took immediate possession,\r\nand Baillie, thinking it useless to follow them into their retreat,\r\ndiscontinued the pursuit, and retired with his army towards Perth.\r\nMontrose passed the night on the banks of Loch Earn, and marched\r\nnext morning through Balquidder, where he was joined, at the ford\r\nof Cardross, by the Viscount Aboyne, the Master of Napier, Hay\r\nof Dalgetty, and Stirling of Keir, who, along with the Earl of\r\nNithsdale, Lord Herries, and others, had escaped from Carlisle, as\r\nbefore stated.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Baillie returned from the pursuit of Montrose than\r\nintelligence was brought him that Macdonald, with the 200 men which\r\nMontrose had left with him, had burnt the town of Coupar-Angus,--that\r\nhe had wasted the lands of Lord Balmerino,--killed Patrick Lindsay,\r\nthe minister of Coupar,--and finally, after routing some troopers of\r\nLord Balcarras, and carrying off their horses and arms, had fled to\r\nthe hills. This occurrence, withdrawing the attention of Baillie from\r\nMontrose’s future movements, enabled the latter to proceed to the\r\nnorth without opposition.\r\n\r\nMontrose had advanced as far as Loch Katrine, when a messenger\r\nbrought him intelligence that General Hurry was in the Enzie with a\r\nconsiderable force, that he had been joined by some of the Moray-men,\r\nand, after plundering and laying waste the country, was preparing to\r\nattack Lord Gordon, who had not a sufficient force to oppose him. On\r\nreceiving this information, Montrose resolved to proceed immediately\r\nto the north to save the Gordons from the destruction which appeared\r\nto hang over them, hoping that, with such accessions of force as he\r\nmight obtain in his march, united with that under Lord Gordon, he\r\nwould succeed in defeating Hurry before Baillie should be aware of\r\nhis movements.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, returned through Balquidder, marched, with rapid\r\nstrides, along the side of Loch Tay, through Athole and Angus, and,\r\ncrossing the Grampian hills, proceeded down the Strath of Glenmuck.\r\nIn his march, Montrose was joined by the Athole-men and the other\r\nHighlanders who had obtained, or rather taken leave of absence after\r\nthe battle of Inverlochy, and also by Macdonald and his party. On\r\narriving in the neighbourhood of Auchindoun, he was met by Lord\r\nGordon, at the head of 1,000 foot and 200 horse. Montrose crossed\r\nthe Dee on the 1st of May, at the mill of Crathie--having provided\r\nhimself with ammunition from a ship in Aberdeen harbour--continued\r\nhis march towards the Spey, and before Hurry was even aware that\r\nthe enemy had crossed the Grampians, he found them within six miles\r\nof his camp. The sudden appearance of Montrose with such a superior\r\nforce--for Hurry had only at this time about 1,000 foot and 200\r\nhorse--greatly alarmed him, and raising his camp, he crossed the Spey\r\nin great haste, with the intention of marching to Inverness, where\r\nhe would be joined by the troops of the garrison, and receive large\r\nreinforcements from the neighbouring counties. Montrose immediately\r\npursued him, and followed close upon his heels to the distance of 14\r\nmiles beyond Forres, when, favoured by the darkness of the night,\r\nHurry effected his escape, with little loss, and arrived at Inverness.\r\n\r\nThe panic into which Hurry had been thrown soon gave way to a very\r\ndifferent feeling, as he found the Earls of Seaforth and Sutherland\r\nwith their retainers, and the clan Fraser, and others from Moray\r\nand Caithness, all assembled at Inverness, as he had directed. This\r\naccession of force increased his army to 3,500 foot and 400 horse.\r\nHe therefore resolved to act on the offensive, by giving battle to\r\nMontrose immediately.\r\n\r\nMontrose had taken up a position at the village of Auldearn,\r\nabout three miles south-east from Nairn, on the morning after\r\nthe pursuit. In the course of the day, Hurry advanced with all\r\nhis forces, including the garrison of Inverness, towards Nairn;\r\nand, on approaching Auldearn, formed his army in order of battle.\r\nMontrose’s force, which had been greatly weakened by the return of\r\nthe Athole-men and other Highlanders to defend their country from the\r\ndepredations of Baillie’s army, now consisted of only 1,500 foot and\r\n250 horse. It was not, therefore, without great reluctance, that he\r\nresolved to risk a battle with an enemy more than double in point of\r\nnumbers, and composed in great part of veteran troops; but, pressed\r\nas he was by Hurry, and in danger of being attacked in his rear by\r\nBaillie, who was advancing by forced marches to the north, he had\r\nno alternative but to hazard a general engagement. He therefore\r\ninstantly looked about him for an advantageous position.\r\n\r\nThe village of Auldearn stands upon a height, behind which, or on the\r\neast, is a valley, overlooked by a ridge of little eminences, running\r\nin a northerly direction, and which almost conceals the valley from\r\nview. In this hollow Montrose arranged his forces in order of battle.\r\nHaving formed them into two divisions, he posted the right wing on\r\nthe north of the village, at a place where there was a considerable\r\nnumber of dikes and ditches. This body, which consisted of 400 men,\r\nchiefly Irish, was placed under the command of Macdonald. On taking\r\ntheir stations, Montrose gave them strict injunctions not to leave\r\ntheir position on any account, as they were effectually protected by\r\nthe walls around them, not only from the attacks of cavalry, but of\r\nfoot, and could, without much danger to themselves, keep up a galling\r\nand destructive fire upon their assailants. In order to attract the\r\nbest troops of the enemy to this difficult spot where they could not\r\nact, and to make them believe that Montrose commanded this wing, he\r\ngave the royal standard to Macdonald, intending, when they should get\r\nentangled among the bushes and dikes, with which the ground to the\r\nright was covered, to attack them himself with his left wing; and to\r\nenable him to do so the more effectually, he placed the whole of his\r\nhorse and the remainder of the foot on the left wing to the south of\r\nthe village. The former he committed to the charge of Lord Gordon,\r\nreserving the command of the latter to himself. After placing a few\r\nchosen foot with some cannon in front of the village, under cover of\r\nsome dikes, Montrose firmly awaited the attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHurry divided his foot and his horse each into two divisions. On\r\nthe right wing of the main body of the foot, which was commanded by\r\nCampbell of Lawers, Hurry placed the regular cavalry which he had\r\nbrought from the south, and on the left the horse of Moray and the\r\nnorth, under the charge of Captain Drummond. The other division of\r\nfoot was placed behind as a reserve, and commanded by Hurry himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Hurry observed the singular position which Montrose had taken\r\nup, he was utterly at a loss to guess his designs, and though\r\nit appeared to him, skilful as he was in the art of war, a most\r\nextraordinary and novel sight, yet, from the well known character\r\nof Montrose, he was satisfied that Montrose’s arrangements were\r\nthe result of a deep laid scheme. But what especially excited the\r\nsurprise of Hurry, was the appearance of the large yellow banner or\r\nroyal standard in the midst of a small body of foot stationed among\r\nhedges and dikes and stones, almost isolated from the horse and the\r\nmain body of the foot. To attack this party, at the head of which\r\nhe naturally supposed Montrose was, was his first object. This was\r\nprecisely what Montrose had wished; his snare proved successful. With\r\nthe design of overwhelming at once the right wing, Hurry despatched\r\ntowards it the best of his horse and all his veteran troops, who\r\nmade a furious attack upon Macdonald’s party, the latter defending\r\nthemselves bravely behind the dikes and bushes. The contest continued\r\nfor some time on the right with varied success, and Hurry, who had\r\nplenty of men to spare, relieved those who were engaged by fresh\r\ntroops. Montrose, who kept a steady eye upon the motions of the\r\nenemy, and watched a favourable opportunity for making a grand attack\r\nupon them with the left wing, was just preparing to carry his design\r\ninto execution, when a confidential person suddenly rode up to him\r\nand whispered in his ear that the right wing had been put to flight.\r\n\r\nThis intelligence was not, however, quite correct. It seems that\r\nMacdonald who, says Wishart, “was a brave enough man, but rather a\r\nbetter soldier than a general, extremely violent, and daring even\r\nto rashness,” had been so provoked with the taunts and insults of\r\nthe enemy, that in spite of the express orders he had received\r\nfrom Montrose on no account to leave his position, he had unwisely\r\nadvanced beyond it to attack the enemy, and though he had been\r\nseveral times repulsed he returned to the charge. But he was at last\r\nborne down by the great numerical superiority of the enemy’s horse\r\nand foot, consisting of veteran troops, and forced to retire in\r\ngreat disorder into an adjoining enclosure. Nothing, however, could\r\nexceed the admirable manner in which he managed this retreat, and the\r\ncourage he displayed while leading off his men. Defending his body\r\nwith a large target, he resisted, single-handed, the assaults of the\r\nenemy, and was the last man to leave the field. So closely indeed was\r\nhe pressed by Hurry’s spearmen, that some of them actually came so\r\nnear him as to fix their spears in his target, which he cut off by\r\nthrees or fours at a time with his broadsword.[293]\r\n\r\nIt was during this retreat that Montrose received the intelligence of\r\nthe flight of the right wing; but he preserved his usual presence of\r\nmind, and to encourage his men, who might get alarmed at hearing such\r\nnews, he thus addressed Lord Gordon, loud enough to be heard by his\r\ntroops, “What are we doing, my Lord? Our friend Macdonald has routed\r\nthe enemy on the right and is carrying all before him. Shall we look\r\non and let him carry off the whole honour of the day?” A crisis had\r\narrived, and not a moment was to be lost. Scarcely, therefore, were\r\nthe words out of Montrose’s mouth, when he ordered his men to charge\r\nthe enemy. When his men were advancing to the charge, Captain or\r\nMajor Drummond, who commanded Hurry’s horse, made an awkward movement\r\nby wheeling about his men, and his horse coming in contact with the\r\nfoot, broke their ranks and occasioned considerable confusion. Lord\r\nGordon seeing this, immediately rushed in upon Drummond’s horse with\r\nhis party and put them to flight. Montrose followed hard with the\r\nfoot, and attacked the main body of Hurry’s army, which he routed\r\nafter a powerful resistance. The veterans in Hurry’s army, who had\r\nserved in Ireland, fought manfully, and chose rather to be cut down\r\nstanding in their ranks than retreat; but the new levies from Moray,\r\nRoss, Sutherland, and Caithness, fled in great consternation. They\r\nwere pursued for several miles, and might have been all killed or\r\ncaptured if Lord Aboyne had not, by an unnecessary display of ensigns\r\nand standards, which he had taken from the enemy, attracted the\r\nnotice of the pursuers, who halted for some time under the impression\r\nthat a fresh party of the enemy was coming up to attack them. In this\r\nway Hurry and some of his troops, who were the last to leave the\r\nfield of battle, as well as the other fugitives, escaped from the\r\nimpending danger, and arrived at Inverness the following morning. As\r\nthe loss of this battle was mainly owing to Captain Drummond, he was\r\ntried by a court-martial at Inverness, and condemned to be shot, a\r\nsentence which was carried into immediate execution. He was accused\r\nof having betrayed the army, and it is said that he admitted that\r\nafter the battle had commenced he had spoken with the enemy.[294]\r\n\r\nThe number of killed on both sides has been variously stated. That\r\non the side of the Covenanters has been reckoned by one writer\r\nat 1,000,[295] by another[296] at 2,000, and by a third at 3,000\r\nmen.[297] Montrose, on the other hand, is said by the first of these\r\nauthors to have lost about 200 men, while the second says that he had\r\nonly “some twenty-four gentlemen hurt, and some few Irish killed,”\r\nand Wishart informs us that Montrose only missed one private man\r\non the left, and that the right wing, commanded by Macdonald, “lost\r\nonly fourteen private men.” The clans who had joined Hurry suffered\r\nconsiderably, particularly the Frasers, who, besides unmarried men,\r\nare said to have left dead on the field no less than 87 married men.\r\nAmong the principal covenanting officers who were slain were Colonel\r\nCampbell of Lawers, Sir John and Sir Gideon Murray, and Colonel James\r\nCampbell, with several other officers of inferior note. The laird\r\nof Lawers’s brother, Archibald Campbell, and a few other officers,\r\nwere taken prisoners. Captain Macdonald and William Macpherson of\r\nInvereschie were the only persons of any note killed on Montrose’s\r\nside. Montrose took several prisoners, whom, with the wounded,\r\nhe treated with great kindness. Such of the former as expressed\r\ntheir sorrow for having joined the ranks of the Covenanters he\r\nreleased--others who were disposed to join him he received into his\r\narmy, but such as remained obstinate he imprisoned. Besides taking\r\n16 standards from the enemy, Montrose got possession of the whole\r\nof their baggage, provisions, and ammunition, and a considerable\r\nquantity of money and valuable effects. The battle of Auldearn was\r\nfought on the 4th of May, according to Wishart,[298] and on the 9th\r\naccording to others,[299] in the year 1645.\r\n\r\nThe immense disproportion between the numbers of the slain on the\r\nside of the Covenanters and that of the prisoners taken by Montrose\r\nevidently shows that very little quarter had been given, the cause\r\nof which is said to have been the murder of James Gordon, younger of\r\nRhiny, who was killed by a party from the garrison of Spynie, and by\r\nsome of the inhabitants of Elgin, at Struders, near Forres, where he\r\nhad been left in consequence of a severe wound he had received in a\r\nskirmish during Hurry’s first retreat to Inverness.[300] But Montrose\r\nrevenged himself still farther by advancing to Elgin and burning the\r\nhouses of all those who had been concerned in the murder, at the same\r\ntime sending out a party[301] to treat in a similar way the town of\r\nGarmouth, belonging to the laird of Innes.\r\n\r\nWhile these proceedings were going on, Montrose sent his whole\r\nbaggage, booty, and warlike stores across the Spey, which he himself\r\ncrossed upon the 14th of May, proceeding to Birkenbog, the seat of “a\r\ngreat Covenanter,” where he took up his head quarters. He quartered\r\nhis men in the neighbourhood, and, during a short stay at Birkenbog,\r\nhe sent out different parties of his troops to scour the country, and\r\ntake vengeance on the Covenanters.\r\n\r\nWhen General Baillie first heard of the defeat of his colleague,\r\nHurry, at Auldearn, he was lying at Cromar, with his army. He had,\r\nin the beginning of May, after Montrose’s departure to the north,\r\nentered Athole, which he had wasted with fire and sword, and had\r\nmade an attempt upon the strong castle of Blair, in which many of\r\nthe prisoners taken at the battle of Inverlochy were confined;\r\nbut, not succeeding in his enterprise, he had, after collecting an\r\nimmense booty, marched through Athole, and, passing by Kirriemuir\r\nand Fettercairn, encamped on the Birse on the 10th of May. His force\r\nat this time amounted to about 2,000 foot and 120 troopers. On the\r\nfollowing day he had marched to Cromar, where he encamped between\r\nthe Kirks of Coull and Tarlan till he should be joined by Lord\r\nBalcarras’s horse regiment. In a short time he was joined, not only\r\nby Balcarras’s regiment, but by two foot regiments. The ministers\r\nendeavoured to induce the country people also to join Baillie, by\r\n“thundering out of pulpits,” but “they lay still,” says Spalding,\r\n“and would not follow him.”[302]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Baillie heard of the defeat of Hurry, he raised his camp\r\nat Cromar, upon the 19th of May, and hastened north. He arrived at\r\nthe wood of Cochlarachie, within two miles of Strathbogie, before\r\nMontrose was aware of his approach. Here he was joined by Hurry,\r\nwho, with some horse from Inverness, had passed themselves off as\r\nbelonging to Lord Gordon’s party, and had thus been permitted to go\r\nthrough Montrose’s lines without opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 19th of May, when lying at Birkenbog, that Montrose\r\nreceived the intelligence of Baillie’s arrival in the neighbourhood\r\nof Strathbogie. Although Montrose’s men had not yet wholly recovered\r\nfrom the fatigues of their late extraordinary march and subsequent\r\nlabours, and although their numbers had been reduced since the battle\r\nof Auldearn, by the departure of some of the Highlanders with the\r\nbooty they had acquired, they felt no disinclination to engage the\r\nenemy, but, on the contrary, were desirous of coming to immediate\r\naction. But Montrose, although he had the utmost confidence in the\r\noften tried courage of his troops, judged it more expedient to avoid\r\nan engagement at present, and to retire, in the meantime, into his\r\nfastnesses to recruit his exhausted strength, than risk another\r\nbattle with a fresh force, greatly superior to his own. In order to\r\ndeceive the enemy as to his intentions, he advanced, the same day,\r\nupon Strathbogie, and, within view of their camp, began to make\r\nintrenchments, and raise fortifications, as if preparing to defend\r\nhimself. But as soon as the darkness of the night prevented Baillie\r\nfrom discovering his motions, Montrose marched rapidly up the south\r\nside of the Spey with his foot, leaving his horse behind him, with\r\ninstructions to follow him as soon as daylight began to appear.\r\n\r\nBaillie had passed the night in the confident expectation of a\r\nbattle next day, but was surprised to learn the following morning\r\nthat not a vestige of Montrose’s army was to be seen. Montrose had\r\ntaken the route to Balveny, which having been ascertained by Baillie,\r\nhe immediately prepared to follow. He, accordingly, crossed the\r\nSpey, and after a rapid march, almost overtook the retiring foe in\r\nGlenlivet; but Montrose, having outdistanced his pursuers by several\r\nmiles before night came on, got the start of them so completely,\r\nthat they were quite at a loss next morning to ascertain the route\r\nhe had taken, and could only guess at it by observing the traces\r\nof his footsteps on the grass and the heather over which he had\r\npassed. Following, therefore, the course thus pointed out, Baillie\r\ncame again in sight of Montrose; but he found that he had taken up\r\na position, which, whilst it almost defied approach from its rocky\r\nand woody situation, commanded the entrance into Badenoch, from\r\nwhich country Montrose could, without molestation, draw supplies of\r\nboth men and provisions. To attack Montrose in his stronghold was\r\nout of the question; but, in the hope of withdrawing him from it,\r\nBaillie encamped his army hard by. Montrose lay quite secure in his\r\nwell-chosen position, from which he sent out parties who, skirmishing\r\nby day, and beating up the quarters of the enemy during the night, so\r\nharassed and frightened them, that they were obliged to retreat to\r\nInverness, after a stay of a few days, a measure which was rendered\r\nstill more necessary from the want of provisions and of provender\r\nfor the horses. Leaving Inverness, Baillie crossed the Spey, and\r\nproceeded to Aberdeenshire, arriving on the 3d of June at Newton, in\r\nthe Garioch, “where he encamped, destroying the country, and cutting\r\nthe green growing crops to the very clod.”[303]\r\n\r\nHaving got quit of the presence of Baillie’s army, Montrose resolved\r\nto make a descent into Angus, and attack the Earl of Crawford, who\r\nlay at the castle of Newtyle with an army of reserve to support\r\nBaillie, and to prevent Montrose from crossing the Forth, and\r\ncarrying the war into the south. This nobleman, who stood next to\r\nArgyle, as head of the Covenanters, had often complained to the\r\nEstates against Argyle, whose rival he was, for his inactivity and\r\npusillanimity; and having insinuated that he would have acted a very\r\ndifferent part had the command of such an army as Argyle had, been\r\nintrusted to him, he had the address to obtain the command of the\r\narmy now under him, which had been newly raised; but the earl was\r\nwithout military experience, and quite unfit to cope with Montrose.\r\n\r\nProceeding through Badenoch, Montrose crossed the Grampians, and\r\narrived by rapid marches on the banks of the river Airly, within\r\nseven miles of Crawford’s camp, but was prevented from giving battle\r\nby the desertion of the Gordons and their friends, who almost all\r\nreturned to their country.\r\n\r\nHe now formed the resolution to attack Baillie himself, but before\r\nhe could venture on such a bold step, he saw that there was an\r\nabsolute necessity of making some additions to his force. With this\r\nview he sent Sir Nathaniel Gordon, an influential cavalier, into the\r\nnorth before him, to raise the Gordons and the other royalists; and,\r\non his march north through Glenshee and the Braes of Mar, Montrose\r\ndespatched Macdonald into the remoter Highlands with a party to bring\r\nhim, as speedily as possible, all the forces he could. Judging that\r\nthe influence and authority of Lord Gordon might greatly assist Sir\r\nNathaniel, he sent him after him, and Montrose himself encamped in\r\nthe country of Cromar, waiting for the expected reinforcements.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Baillie lay in camp on Dee-side, in the lower part\r\nof Mar, where he was joined by Crawford; but he showed no disposition\r\nto attack Montrose, who, from the inferiority, in point of number, of\r\nhis forces, retired to the old castle of Kargarf. Crawford did not,\r\nhowever, remain long with Baillie; but, exchanging a thousand of his\r\nraw recruits for a similar number of Baillie’s veterans, he returned\r\nwith these, and the remainder of his army, through the Mearns into\r\nAngus, as if he intended some mighty exploit; he, thereafter, entered\r\nAthole, and in imitation of Argyle, plundered and burnt the country.\r\n\r\nRaising his camp, Baillie marched towards Strathbogie to lay siege to\r\nthe Marquis of Huntly’s castle, the Bog of Gight, now Gordon castle;\r\nbut although Montrose had not yet received any reinforcements, he\r\nresolved to follow Baillie and prevent him from putting his design\r\ninto execution. But Montrose had marched scarcely three miles when he\r\nwas observed by Baillie’s scouts, and at the same time ascertained\r\nthat Baillie had taken up a strong position on a rising ground above\r\nKeith, about two miles off. Next morning Montrose, not considering it\r\nadvisable to attack Baillie in the strong position he occupied, sent\r\na trumpeter to him offering to engage him on open ground, but Baillie\r\nanswered the hostile message by saying, that he would not receive\r\norders for fighting from his enemy.[304]\r\n\r\nIn this situation of matters, Montrose had recourse to stratagem to\r\ndraw Baillie from his stronghold. By retiring across the river Don,\r\nthe covenanting general was led to believe that Montrose intended to\r\nmarch to the south, and he was, therefore, advised by a committee\r\nof the Estates which always accompanied him, and in whose hands he\r\nappears to have been a mere passive instrument, to pursue Montrose.\r\nAs soon as Montrose’s scouts brought intelligence that Baillie was\r\nadvancing, he set off by break of day to the village of Alford on\r\nthe river Don, where he intended to await the enemy. When Baillie\r\nwas informed of this movement, he imagined that Montrose was in full\r\nretreat before him, a supposition which encouraged him so to hasten\r\nhis march, that he came up with Montrose at noon at the distance of a\r\nfew miles from Alford. Montrose, thereupon, drew up his army in order\r\nof battle on an advantageous rising ground and waited for the enemy;\r\nbut instead of attacking him, Baillie made a detour to the left with\r\nthe intention of getting into Montrose’s rear and cutting off his\r\nretreat. Montrose then continued his march to Alford, where he passed\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the 2d of July, the two armies were only\r\nthe distance of about four miles from each other. Montrose drew up\r\nhis troops on a little hill behind the village of Alford. In his rear\r\nwas a marsh full of ditches and pits, which would protect him from\r\nthe inroads of Baillie’s cavalry should they attempt to assail in\r\nthat quarter, and in his front stood a steep hill, which prevented\r\nthe enemy from observing his motions. He gave the command of the\r\nright wing to Lord Gordon and Sir Nathaniel; the left he committed to\r\nViscount Aboyne and Sir William Rollock; and the main body was put\r\nunder the charge of Angus Macvichalaster, chief of the Macdonells of\r\nGlengarry, Drummond younger of Balloch, and Quarter-master George\r\nGraham, a skilful officer. To Napier his nephew, Montrose intrusted\r\na body of reserve, which was concealed behind the hill.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Montrose completed his arrangements, when he received\r\nintelligence that the enemy had crossed the Don, and was moving\r\nin the direction of Alford. This was a fatal step on the part of\r\nBaillie, who, it is said, was forced into battle by the rashness of\r\nLord Balcarras, “one of the bravest men of the kingdom,”[305] who\r\nunnecessarily placed himself and his regiment in a position of such\r\ndanger that they could not be rescued without exposing the whole of\r\nthe covenanting army.[306]\r\n\r\nWhen Baillie arrived in the valley adjoining the hill on which\r\nMontrose had taken up his position, both armies remained motionless\r\nfor some time, viewing each other, as if unwilling to begin the\r\ncombat. Owing to the commanding position which Montrose occupied, the\r\nCovenanters could not expect to gain any advantage by attacking him\r\neven with superior forces; but now, for the first time, the number\r\nof the respective armies was about equal, and Montrose had this\r\nadvantage over his adversary, that while Baillie’s army consisted\r\nin part of the raw and undisciplined levies which the Earl of\r\nCrawford had exchanged for some of his veteran troops, the greater\r\npart of Montrose’s men had been long accustomed to service. These\r\ncircumstances determined Baillie not to attempt the ascent of the\r\nhill, but to remain in the valley, where, in the event of a descent\r\nby Montrose, his superiority in cavalry would give him the advantage.\r\n\r\nThis state of inaction was, however, soon put an end to by Lord\r\nGordon, who observing a party of Baillie’s troops driving away\r\nbefore them a large quantity of cattle which they had collected in\r\nStrathbogie and the Enzie, and being desirous of recovering the\r\nproperty of his countrymen, selected a body of horse, with which\r\nhe attempted a rescue. The assailed party was protected by some\r\ndykes and enclosures, from behind which they fired a volley upon\r\nthe Gordons, which did considerable execution amongst them. Such a\r\ncool and determined reception, attended with a result so disastrous\r\nand unexpected, might have been attended by dangerous consequences,\r\nhad not Montrose, on observing the party of Lord Gordon giving\r\nindications as if undetermined how to act, resolved immediately to\r\ncommence a general attack upon the enemy with his whole army. But\r\nas Baillie’s foot had intrenched themselves amongst the dykes and\r\nfences which covered the ground at the bottom of the hill, and could\r\nnot be attacked in that position with success, Montrose immediately\r\nordered the horse, who were engaged with the enemy, to retreat to\r\ntheir former position, in the expectation that Baillie’s troops would\r\nleave their ground and follow them. And in this hope he was not\r\ndisappointed, for the Covenanters thinking that this movement of the\r\nhorse was merely the prelude to a retreat, advanced from their secure\r\nposition, and followed the supposed fugitives with their whole horse\r\nand foot in regular order.\r\n\r\nBoth armies now came to close quarters, and fought face to face and\r\nman to man with great obstinacy for some time, without either party\r\nreceding from the ground they occupied. At length Sir Nathaniel\r\nGordon, growing impatient at such a protracted resistance, resolved\r\nto cut his way through the enemy’s left wing, consisting of Lord\r\nBalcarras’s regiment of horse; and calling to the light musketeers\r\nwho lined his horse, he ordered them to throw aside their muskets,\r\nwhich were now unnecessary, and to attack the enemy’s horse with\r\ntheir drawn swords. This order was immediately obeyed, and in a\r\nshort time they cut a passage through the ranks of the enemy,\r\nwhom they hewed down with great slaughter. When the horse which\r\ncomposed Baillie’s right wing, and which had been kept in check by\r\nLord Aboyne, perceived that their left had given way, they also\r\nretreated.[307] An attempt was made by the covenanting general to\r\nrally his left wing by bringing up the right, after it had retired,\r\nto its support, but they were so alarmed at the spectacle or _mêlée_\r\nwhich they had just witnessed on the left, where their comrades had\r\nbeen cut down by the broad swords of Montrose’s musketeers, that they\r\ncould not be induced to take the place of their retiring friends.\r\n\r\nThus abandoned by the horse, Baillie’s foot were attacked on all\r\nsides by Montrose’s forces. They fought with uncommon bravery, and\r\nalthough they were cut down in great numbers, the survivors exhibited\r\na perseverance and determination to resist to the last extremity. An\r\naccident now occurred, which, whilst it threw a melancholy gloom over\r\nthe fortunes of the day, and the spirits of Montrose’s men served\r\nto hasten the work of carnage and death. This was the fall of Lord\r\nGordon, who having incautiously rushed in amongst the thickest of\r\nthe enemy, was unfortunately shot dead, it is said,[308] when in the\r\nact of pulling Baillie, the covenanting general, from his horse,\r\nhaving, it is said, in a moment of exultation, promised to his men,\r\nto drag Baillie out of the ranks and present him before them. The\r\nGordons, on perceiving their young chief fall, set no bounds to their\r\nfury, and falling upon the enemy with renewed vigour, hewed them\r\ndown without mercy; yet these brave men still showed no disposition\r\nto flee, and it was not until the appearance of the reserve under\r\nthe Master of Napier, which had hitherto been kept out of view of\r\nthe enemy at the back of the hill, that their courage began to\r\nfail them. When this body began to descend the hill, accompanied\r\nby what appeared to them a fresh reinforcement of cavalry, but\r\nwhich consisted merely of the camp or livery boys, who had mounted\r\nthe sumpter-horses to make a display for the purpose of alarming\r\nthe enemy, the entire remaining body of the covenanting foot fled\r\nwith precipitation. A hot pursuit took place, and so great was the\r\nslaughter that very few of them escaped. The covenanting general and\r\nhis principal officers were saved by the fleetness of their horses,\r\nand the Marquis of Argyle, who had accompanied Baillie as a member of\r\nthe committee, and who was closely pursued by Glengarry and some of\r\nhis Highlanders, made a narrow escape by repeatedly changing horses.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the best contested battles which Montrose had yet\r\nfought, yet strange as the fact may appear, his loss was, as usual,\r\nextremely trifling, Lord Gordon being the only person of importance\r\nslain. A considerable number of Montrose’s men, however, were\r\nwounded, particularly the Gordons, who, for a long time, sustained\r\nthe attacks of Balcarras’s horse, amongst whom were Sir Nathaniel,\r\nand Gordon, younger of Gicht.[309] The loss on the side of the\r\nCovenanters was immense; by far the greater part of their foot, and\r\na considerable number of their cavalry having been slain. Some\r\nprisoners were taken from them, but their number was small, owing to\r\ntheir obstinacy in refusing quarter. These were sent to Strathbogie\r\nunder an escort.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant victory was, however, clouded by the death of Lord\r\nGordon, “a very hopeful young gentleman, able of mind and body,\r\nabout the age of twenty-eight years.”[310] Wishart gives an\r\naffecting description of the feelings of Montrose’s army when this\r\namiable young nobleman was killed. “There was,” he says, “a general\r\nlamentation for the loss of the Lord Gordon, whose death seemed to\r\neclipse all the glory of the victory. As the report spread among the\r\nsoldiers, every one appeared to be struck dumb with the melancholy\r\nnews, and a universal silence prevailed for some time through the\r\narmy. However, their grief soon burst through all restraint, venting\r\nitself in the voice of lamentation and sorrow. When the first\r\ntransports were over, the soldiers exclaimed against heaven and\r\nearth for bereaving the king, the kingdom, and themselves, of such\r\nan excellent young nobleman; and, unmindful of the victory or of the\r\nplunder, they thronged about the body of their dead captain, some\r\nweeping over his wounds and kissing his lifeless limbs; while others\r\npraised his comely appearance even in death, and extolled his noble\r\nmind, which was enriched with every valuable qualification that could\r\nadorn his high birth or ample fortune: they even cursed the victory\r\nbought at so dear a rate. Nothing could have supported the army\r\nunder this immense sorrow but the presence of Montrose, whose safety\r\ngave them joy, and not a little revived their drooping spirits. In\r\nthe meantime he could not command his grief, but mourned bitterly\r\nover the melancholy fate of his only and dearest friend, grievously\r\ncomplaining, that one who was the honour of his nation, the ornament\r\nof the Scots nobility, and the boldest asserter of the royal\r\nauthority in the north, had fallen in the flower of his youth.”[311]\r\n\r\nThe victories of Montrose in Scotland were more than counterbalanced\r\nby those of the parliamentary forces in England. Under different\r\ncircumstances, the success at Alford might have been attended with\r\nconsequences the most important to the royal cause; but the defeat\r\nof the king on the 14th of June, at Naseby, had raised the hopes of\r\nthe Covenanters, and prepared their minds to receive the tidings of\r\nBaillie’s defeat with coolness and moderation.\r\n\r\nUpon the day on which the battle of Alford was fought, the parliament\r\nhad adjourned to Stirling from Edinburgh, on account of a destructive\r\npestilence which had reached the capital from Newcastle, by way of\r\nKelso. Thither General Baillie, Lord Balcarras, and the committee\r\nof Estates, which had accompanied the covenanting army, repaired,\r\nto lay a statement of the late disaster before the parliament,\r\nand to receive instructions as to their future conduct. With the\r\nexception of Baillie, they were well received. Balcarras, who had\r\nparticularly distinguished himself in the battle at the head of his\r\nhorse, received a vote of thanks, and a similar acknowledgment was,\r\nafter some hesitation, awarded to Baillie, notwithstanding some\r\nattempts made to prejudice the parliament against him. But the fact\r\nwas, they could not dispense in the present emergency with an officer\r\nof the military talents of Baillie, who, instead of shrinking from\r\nresponsibility for the loss of the battle of Alford, offered to stand\r\ntrial before a court martial, and to justify his conduct on that\r\noccasion. To have withheld, therefore, the usual token of approbation\r\nfrom him, while bestowing it upon an inferior officer, would have\r\nbeen to fix a stigma upon him which he was not disposed to brook\r\nconsistently with the retention of the command of the army; and as\r\nthe parliament resolved to renew his commission, by appointing him\r\nto the command of the army then being concentrated at Perth, they\r\nafterwards professed their unqualified satisfaction with him.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Alford the army of Montrose was considerably\r\ndiminished, in consequence of the Highlanders, according to custom,\r\ntaking leave of absence, and returning home with the spoil they\r\nhad taken from the enemy. This singular, though ordinary practice,\r\ncontributed more to paralyze the exertions of Montrose, and to\r\nprevent him from following up his successes, than any event which\r\noccurred in the whole course of his campaigns, and it may appear\r\nstrange that Montrose did not attempt to put an end to it; but the\r\ntenure by which he held the services of these hardy mountaineers\r\nbeing that they should be allowed their wonted privileges, any\r\nattempt to deviate from their established customs would have been an\r\nimmediate signal for desertion.\r\n\r\nAs it would have been imprudent in Montrose, with forces thus\r\nimpaired, to have followed the fugitives, who would receive fresh\r\nsuccours from the south, he, after allowing his men some time to\r\nrefresh themselves, marched to Aberdeen, where he celebrated the\r\nfuneral obsequies of his valued friend, Lord Gordon, with becoming\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nThe district of Buchan in Aberdeenshire, which, from its outlying\r\nsituation, had hitherto escaped assessment for the supply of the\r\nhostile armies, was at this time subjected to the surveillance of\r\nMontrose, who despatched a party from Aberdeen into that country to\r\ncollect all the horses they could find for the use of his army, and\r\nalso to obtain recruits. About the same time the Marquis of Huntly,\r\nwho had been living in Strathnaver for some time, having heard of\r\nthe death of his eldest son, Lord Gordon, meditated a return to\r\nhis own country, intending to throw the influence of his name and\r\nauthority into the royal scale. But as he might be exposed to danger\r\nin passing through countries which were hostile to the royal cause,\r\nit was arranged between Montrose and Viscount Aboyne, who had just\r\nbeen created an earl, that the latter should proceed to Strathnaver,\r\nwith a force of 2,000 men to escort his father south. This expedition\r\nwas, however, abandoned, in consequence of intelligence having been\r\nbrought to Montrose that the Covenanters were assembling in great\r\nstrength at Perth.\r\n\r\nThe parliament which, as we have seen, had left Edinburgh, and gone\r\nto Stirling on account of the pestilence, had been obliged, in\r\nconsequence of its appearance in Stirling, to adjourn to Perth, where\r\nit was to meet on the 24th of July; but before leaving Stirling, they\r\nordered a levy of 10,000 foot to be raised in the counties to the\r\nsouth of the Tay; and to insure due obedience to this mandate, all\r\nnoblemen, gentlemen, and heritors, were required to attend at Perth\r\non or before that day, well mounted, and to bring with them such\r\nforces as they could raise, under a heavy penalty.[312]\r\n\r\nOn leaving Aberdeen, Montrose took up his quarters at Crabston,\r\nsituated a few miles from Aberdeen, between the rivers Don and Dee,\r\nwhere he remained for some time in the expectation of being joined by\r\nreinforcements from the Highlands under Major-general Macdonald, who\r\nhad been absent about two months from the army in quest of recruits.\r\nAs, however, these expected succours did not arrive within the time\r\nexpected, Montrose, impatient of delay, crossed the Dee, and marching\r\nover the Grampians, descended into the Mearns, and pitched his camp\r\nat Fordoun in Kincardineshire.\r\n\r\nProceeding on his march through Angus and Blairgowrie to Dunkeld,\r\nMontrose had the good fortune to be successively joined by his\r\ncousin, Patrick Graham of Inchbrakie, at the head of the brave\r\nAthole Highlanders, and by Macdonald, his major-general, who brought\r\nwith him the chief of the Macleans, and about 700 of that clan, all\r\nanimated by a strong feeling of animosity against Argyle and his\r\npartisans. He was also joined by John Muidartach, the celebrated\r\ncaptain of the Clanranald, at the head of 500 of his men; by the\r\nMacgregors and Macnabs, headed by their respective chieftains; by the\r\nClandonald, under the command of the uncles of Glengarry and other\r\nofficers, Glengarry himself, “who,” says Bishop Wishart, “deserves\r\na singular commendation for his bravery and steady loyalty to the\r\nking, and his peculiar attachment to Montrose,”[313] having never\r\nleft Montrose since he joined him at the time of his expedition\r\ninto Argyle. Besides all these, the Stewarts of Appin, some of the\r\nFarquharsons of Braemar, and small parties of inferior clans from\r\nBadenoch, rallied round the standard of Montrose.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained these reinforcements, Montrose now formed the design\r\nof marching upon Perth, and breaking up the parliament which had\r\nthere assembled, and thereafter of proceeding to the south, and\r\ndissipating the levies which were being raised beyond the Tay. But\r\nthe want of cavalry, in which he was constantly deficient, formed\r\na bar to this plan, and Montrose was, therefore, obliged to defer\r\nhis project till he should be joined by the Earls of Aboyne and\r\nAirly, whom he expected soon with a considerable body of horse. In\r\nthe meantime, Montrose crossed the Tay at Dunkeld, and encamped at\r\nAmulree. The covenanting army, with the exception of the garrison of\r\nPerth, was then lying on the south side of the Earn, and a body of\r\n400 horse was posted near the town, for the protection of the Estates\r\nor parliament.\r\n\r\nThis movement, on the part of Montrose, created some alarm in the\r\nminds of the Covenanters, which was greatly increased by a report\r\nfrom their horse, stationed in the neighbourhood of the town, who,\r\nseeing some of his scouts approach it, had fancied that he was going\r\nto storm it. While this panic was at its height, Montrose, who had\r\nno intention of attacking the town, raised his camp, and took up a\r\nposition in the wood of Methven, about five miles from Perth. During\r\nthis movement, the town was thrown into a state of the greatest\r\nconsternation, from an apprehension that Montrose was about to attack\r\nit, and the nobility and the other members of the parliament were\r\nearnestly solicited to secure their safety by a speedy flight, but\r\nthe Estates remained firm, and could not be persuaded to abandon\r\ntheir posts. In order, if possible, still farther to increase the\r\npanic in the town, Montrose advanced almost to the very gates\r\nof Perth with his horse the following day, which, although not\r\nexceeding 100, were made to appear formidable by the addition of\r\nthe baggage-horses, on which some musketeers were mounted. This act\r\nof bold defiance magnified the fears of those who were in the town,\r\nand made them imagine that Montrose was well provided in cavalry.\r\nThe covenanting troops, therefore, were afraid to venture beyond the\r\ngates; and Montrose having thus easily accomplished his object, was\r\nencouraged, still farther, to cross the Earn at Dupplin, when he\r\nopenly reconnoitred the enemy’s army on the south of that river, and\r\nsurveyed the Strath with great deliberation and coolness, without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nBoth armies remained in their positions for several days without\r\nattempting any thing, each waiting for reinforcements. During all\r\nthis time, the enemy had been deceived respecting the strength of\r\nMontrose’s horse, but having learned his weakness in that respect,\r\nand the deception which he had practised so successfully upon them,\r\nand being joined by three regiments from Fife, they resolved to\r\noffer him battle. Montrose, however, from his great inferiority of\r\nnumbers, particularly in horse, was not in a condition to accept the\r\nchallenge, and wisely declined it. Accordingly, when he saw the enemy\r\nadvancing towards him, he prepared to retreat among the neighbouring\r\nmountains; but to deceive the enemy, and to enable him to carry off\r\nhis baggage, he drew out his army as if he intended to fight, placing\r\nhis horse in front, and securing the passes into the mountains with\r\nguards. While making these dispositions, he sent off his baggage\r\ntowards the hills under an escort; and when he thought the baggage\r\nout of danger, gave orders to his army to march off in close rank;\r\nand to cover its retreat and protect it from the cavalry of the\r\nenemy, he placed his horse, lined as usual with the best musketeers,\r\nin the rear.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Baillie, the covenanting general, perceived that Montrose\r\nwas in full retreat, he despatched General Hurry with the cavalry in\r\npursuit of him; but from a most unaccountable delay on Hurry’s part\r\nin crossing the Pow--so slow, indeed, had his movements been, that\r\nBaillie’s foot overtook him at the fords of the Almond--Montrose had\r\nalmost reached the passes of the mountains before he was overtaken.\r\nChagrined at his easy escape, and determined to perform some striking\r\nexploit before Montrose should retire into his fastnesses, a body of\r\n300 of the best mounted covenanting cavalry set off at full gallop\r\nafter him, and attacked him with great fury, using at the same time\r\nthe most insulting and abusive language. To put an end to this\r\nannoyance, Montrose selected twenty expert Highlanders, and requested\r\nthem to bring down some of the assailants. Accordingly these marksmen\r\nadvanced in a crouching attitude, concealing their guns, and having\r\napproached within musket-shot, took deliberate aim, and soon brought\r\ndown the more advanced of the party. This unexpected disaster made\r\nthe assailants more cautious in their advances, and caused them to\r\nresolve upon an immediate retreat; but the marksmen were so elated\r\nwith their success that they actually pursued them down into the\r\nplain, “and resolutely attacked the whole party, who, putting spurs\r\nto their horses, fled with the utmost precipitation, like so many\r\ndeer before the hunters.”[314] In this retreat Montrose did not lose\r\na single man.\r\n\r\nAfter giving over this fruitless pursuit, the enemy returned to\r\nMontrose’s camp at Methven, where, according to Wishart, they\r\ncommitted a most barbarous act in revenge of their late affront, by\r\nbutchering some of the wives of the Highlanders and Irish who had\r\nbeen left behind. Montrose took up his quarters at Little Dunkeld,\r\nboth because he was there perfectly secure from the attacks of the\r\nenemy’s cavalry, and because it was a convenient station to wait for\r\nthe reinforcements of horse which he daily expected from the north\r\nunder the Earls of Airly and Aboyne. Although both armies lay close\r\ntogether for several days, nothing was attempted on either side. The\r\ncovenanting general had become quite disgusted with the service in\r\nconsequence of the jealousies and suspicions which it was too evident\r\nthe committee entertained of him. His disgust was increased by the\r\nsudden return to their country of the Fife men, who preferred their\r\ndomestic comforts to the vicissitudes of war, but who unfortunately\r\nwere, as we shall soon see, to be sacrificed at its shrine.\r\n\r\nAt length the Earl of Aboyne, accompanied by Sir Nathaniel Gordon,\r\narrived at Little Dunkeld, but with a force much inferior in numbers\r\nto what was expected. They only brought 200 horse and 120 musketeers,\r\nwhich last were mounted upon carriage horses. The smallness of\r\ntheir number was compensated, however, in a great measure by their\r\nsteadiness and bravery. The Earl of Airly and his son, Sir David\r\nOgilvie, joined Montrose at the same time, along with a troop of 80\r\nhorse, consisting chiefly of gentlemen of the name of Ogilvie, among\r\nwhom was Alexander Ogilvie, son of Sir John Ogilvie of Innerquharity,\r\na young man who had already distinguished himself in the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perth in the 17th century.--From Slezer’s _Theatrum\r\nScotiæ_ (1693).]\r\n\r\nNever, at any former period of his eventful career, did the\r\nprobabilities of ultimate success on the side of Montrose appear\r\ngreater than now. His army, ardent and devoted to the royal cause,\r\nnow amounted to nearly 5,000 foot and about 500 horse, the greater\r\npart of which consisted of brave and experienced warriors whom he\r\nhad often led to victory. A considerable portion of his army was\r\ncomposed of some of the most valiant of the Highland clans, led by\r\ntheir respective chiefs, among whom stood conspicuous the renowned\r\ncaptain of clan Ranald, in himself a host. The clans were animated by\r\na feeling of the most unbounded attachment to what they considered\r\nthe cause of their chiefs, and by a deadly spirit of revenge for the\r\ncruelties which the Covenanters under Argyle had exercised in the\r\nHighlands. The Macleans and the Athole Highlanders in particular,\r\nlonged for an opportunity of retaliating upon the covenanting\r\npartisans of Argyle the injuries which they had repeatedly received\r\nat his hands, and thereby wiping out the stain which, as they\r\nconceived, had been cast upon them. But fortunate as Montrose now\r\nwas in having such an army at his disposal, the chances in his\r\nfavour were greatly enhanced by the circumstance, that whereas in\r\nhis former campaigns he had to watch the movements of different\r\narmies, and to fight them in detail, he was now enabled, from having\r\nannihilated or dispersed the whole armies formerly opposed to him, to\r\nconcentrate his strength and to direct all his energies to one point.\r\nThe only bar which now stood in the way of the entire subjugation\r\nof Scotland to the authority of the king, was the army of Baillie,\r\nand the defeat or destruction of this body now became the immediate\r\nobject of Montrose. His resolution to attack the enemy was hastened\r\nby the receipt of information that the Fife regiments had left\r\nBaillie’s camp and returned home, and that the general himself was\r\nso dissatisfied with the conduct of the covenanting committee, who\r\nthwarted all his plans and usurped his authority, that he was about\r\nto resign the command of the army.\r\n\r\nMontrose, therefore, without loss of time, raised his camp, and\r\ndescending into the Lowlands, arrived at Logie Almond, where he\r\nhalted his foot. Thence he went out with his cavalry to reconnoitre\r\nthe enemy, and came in full view of them before sunset. They made no\r\nattempt to molest him, and testified their dread of this unexpected\r\nvisit by retiring within their lines. Early next morning Montrose\r\nagain rode out to make his observations, but was surprised to learn\r\nthat the enemy had abandoned their camp at Methven during the\r\nnight, and had retired across the Earn, and taken up a position at\r\nKilgraston, near Bridge-of-Earn. Montrose immediately put his army\r\nin motion towards the Earn, which he crossed by the bridge of Nether\r\nGask, about eight miles above Kilgraston. He then proceeded forward\r\nas far as the Kirk of Dron, by which movement he for the first time\r\nsucceeded in throwing open to the operations of his army the whole\r\nof the country south of the Tay, from which the enemy had hitherto\r\ncarefully excluded him. The enemy, alarmed at Montrose’s approach,\r\nmade every preparation for defending themselves by strengthening\r\nthe position in which they were intrenched, and which, from the\r\nnarrowness of the passes and the nature of the ground, was well\r\nadapted for sustaining an attack.\r\n\r\nMontrose was most anxious to bring the enemy to an engagement before\r\nthey should be joined by a large levy then raising in Fife; but they\r\nwere too advantageously posted to be attacked with much certainty\r\nof success. As he could not by any means induce them to leave their\r\nground, he marched to Kinross for the double purpose of putting\r\nan end to the Fife levies and of withdrawing the enemy from their\r\nposition, so as to afford him an opportunity of attacking them under\r\nmore favourable circumstances. This movement had the effect of\r\ndrawing Baillie from his stronghold, who cautiously followed Montrose\r\nat a respectful distance. In the course of his march, Baillie was\r\nagain joined by the three Fife regiments. On arriving at Kinross in\r\nthe evening, Montrose learned from an advanced party he had sent out\r\nto collect information through the country, under the command of\r\nColonel Nathaniel Gordon, and Sir William Rollock, that the people\r\nof Fife were in arms, a piece of intelligence which made him resolve\r\nimmediately to retrace his steps, judging it imprudent to risk a\r\nbattle in such a hostile district. Although the men of Fife were\r\nstern Covenanters, and were ready to fight for the Covenant on their\r\nown soil, yet living for the most part in towns, and following out\r\nthe sober pursuits of a quiet and domestic life, they had no relish\r\nfor war, and disliked the service of the camp. Hence the speedy\r\nreturn of the Fife regiments from the camp at Methven, to their own\r\ncountry, and hence another reason which induced Montrose to leave\r\ntheir unfriendly soil, viz., that they would probably again abandon\r\nBaillie, should he attempt to follow Montrose in his progress west.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after remaining a night at Kinross, Montrose, the\r\nfollowing morning, marched towards Alloa, in the neighbourhood of\r\nwhich he arrived in the evening, and passed the night in the wood of\r\nTullybody. The Irish plundered the town of Alloa, and the adjoining\r\nlordship, which belonged to the Earl of Mar; but notwithstanding this\r\nunprovoked outrage, the earl and Lord Erskine gave Montrose, the\r\nEarl of Airly, and the principal officers of the army, an elegant\r\nentertainment in the castle of Alloa. Montrose, however, did not\r\ndelay the march of his army while partaking of the hospitality of the\r\nEarl of Mar, but immediately despatched Macdonald west to Stirling\r\nwith the foot, retaining only the horse to serve him as a body-guard.\r\nIn this route the Macleans laid waste the parishes of Muckhart and\r\nDollar, of which the Marquis of Argyle was the superior, and burnt\r\nCastle Campbell, the principal residence of the Argyle family in the\r\nlowlands, in requital of similar acts done by the marquis and his\r\nfollowers in the country of the Macleans.[315]\r\n\r\nAs the pestilence was still raging in the town of Stirling, Montrose\r\navoided it altogether, lest his army might catch the infection. He\r\nhalted within three miles of the town, where his army passed the\r\nnight, and being apprised next morning, by one of Baillie’s scouts\r\nwho had been taken prisoner, that Baillie was close at hand with the\r\nwhole of his army, Montrose marched quickly up to the fords of Frew,\r\nabout eight miles above Stirling bridge, and there crossed the Forth.\r\nPursuing his march the following morning in the direction of Glasgow,\r\nhe made a short halt about six miles from Stirling, to ascertain\r\nthe enemy’s movements, and being informed that Baillie had not yet\r\ncrossed the Forth, he marched to Kilsyth, where he encamped. During\r\nthe day, Baillie passed the Forth by Stirling bridge, and marching\r\nforwards, came within view of Montrose’s army, and encamped that\r\nevening within three miles of Kilsyth.[316]\r\n\r\nThe covenanting army had, in its progress westward, followed exactly\r\nthe tract of Montrose through the vale of the Devon. The Marquis of\r\nArgyle availing himself of this circumstance, caused the house of\r\nMenstrie, the seat of the Earl of Stirling, the king’s secretary, and\r\nthat of Airthrie, belonging to Sir John Graham of Braco, to be burnt.\r\nHe, moreover, sent an insolent message to the Earl of Mar, notifying\r\nto him, that, on the return of the army from the pursuit of Montrose,\r\nhe, the earl, might calculate on having his castle also burnt, for\r\nthe hospitality he had shown Montrose.[317]\r\n\r\nThe conjecture of Montrose, that the Fife regiments would not cross\r\nthe Forth, was not altogether without foundation. In fact, when they\r\narrived near Stirling, they positively refused to advance further,\r\nand excused themselves by alleging, that they were raised on the\r\nexpress condition that they should not be called upon to serve out\r\nof their own shire, and that, having already advanced beyond its\r\nlimits, they would on no account cross the Forth. But their obstinacy\r\nwas overcome by the all-powerful influence of the ministers, who, in\r\naddition to the usual scriptural appeals, “told them jolly tales that\r\nLanark, Glencairn, and Eglinton, were lifting an army to join them,\r\nand therefore entreated that they would, for only one day more, go\r\nout,” until that army approached, when they should be discharged.[318]\r\n\r\nWhile the Fife regiments were thus persuaded to expose themselves\r\nto the unforeseen destruction which unfortunately awaited them, an\r\nincident occurred on the opposite bank of the Forth, which betokened\r\nill for the future prospects of the covenanting army. This will be\r\nbest explained by stating the matter in General Baillie’s own words.\r\n“A little above the park (the king’s park at Stirling), I halted\r\nuntil the Fife regiments were brought up, hearing that the rebels\r\nwere marching towards Kilsyth. After the upcoming of these regiments,\r\nthe Marquis of Argyle, Earl of Crawford, and Lord Burleigh, and,\r\nif I mistake not, the Earl of Tulliebardine, the Lords Elcho and\r\nBalcarras, with some others, came up. My lord marquis asked me what\r\nnext was to be done. I answered, the direction should come from his\r\nlordship and those of the committee. My lord demanded what reason\r\nwas for this? I answered, I found myself so slighted in every thing\r\nbelonging to a commander-in-chief, that, for the short time I was\r\nto stay with them, I would absolutely submit to their direction and\r\nfollow it. The marquis desired me to explain myself, which I did\r\nin these particulars, sufficiently known to my lord marquis and\r\nthe other lords and gentlemen then present. I told his lordship,\r\n(1.) Prisoners of all sorts were exchanged without my knowledge;\r\nthe traffickers therein received passes from others, and, sometimes\r\npassing within two miles of me, did neither acquaint me with their\r\nbusiness, nor, at their return, where, or in what posture they had\r\nleft the enemy: (2.) While I was present, others did sometimes\r\nundertake the command of the army: (3.) Without either my order or\r\nknowledge, fire was raised, and that destroyed which might have\r\nbeen a recompense to some good deserver, for which I would not be\r\nanswerable to the public. All which things considered, I should\r\nin any thing freely give my own opinion, but follow the judgment\r\nof the committee, and the rather because that was the last day of\r\nmy undertaking.”[319] It is here necessary to state, by way of\r\nexplanation, that Baillie had, in consequence of the previous conduct\r\nof the committee, resigned his commission, and had only been induced,\r\nat the earnest solicitation of the parliament, to continue his\r\nservices for a definite period, which, it appears, was just on the\r\npoint of expiring.\r\n\r\nThe differences between Baillie and the committee being patched up,\r\nthe covenanting army proceeded on the 14th of August in the direction\r\nof Denny, and having crossed the Carron at Hollandbush, encamped, as\r\nwe have stated, about 3 miles from Kilsyth.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of Baillie, Montrose had received information\r\nwhich made him resolve to hazard a battle immediately. The\r\nintelligence he had obtained was to the effect, that the Earls\r\nof Cassilis, Eglinton, and Glencairn, and other heads of the\r\nCovenanters, were actively engaged in levying forces in the west\r\nof Scotland, and that the Earl of Lanark had already raised a body\r\nof 1,000 foot and 500 horse in Clydesdale, among the vassals and\r\ndependents of the Hamilton family, and that this force was within 12\r\nmiles of Kilsyth.\r\n\r\nHaving taken his resolution, Montrose made the necessary arrangements\r\nfor receiving the enemy, by placing his men in the best position\r\nwhich the nature of the ground afforded. In front of his position\r\nwere several cottages and gardens, of which he took possession.\r\nBaillie, seeing the advantageous position chosen by Montrose,\r\nwould have willingly delayed battle till either the expected\r\nreinforcements from the west should arrive, or till Montrose should\r\nbe induced to become the assailant; but his plans were over-ruled\r\nby Argyle and the other members of the committee, who insisted\r\nthat he should immediately attack Montrose. Accordingly, early\r\nin the morning he put his army in motion from Hollandbush, and\r\nadvanced near Auchinclogh, about two miles to the east of Kilsyth,\r\nwhere he halted. As the ground between him and Montrose was full\r\nof quagmires, which effectually prevented Montrose from attacking\r\nhim in front, he proposed to take up a defensive position without\r\nadvancing farther, and await an attack. But here again the committee\r\ninterposed, and when he was in the very act of arranging the stations\r\nof his army, they advised him to take a position on a hill on his\r\nright, which they considered more suitable. It was in vain that\r\nBaillie remonstrated against what he justly considered an imprudent\r\nadvice--the committee were inexorable in their resolution, and\r\nBaillie had no alternative but to obey. In justice, however, to Lord\r\nBalcarras, it must be mentioned that he disapproved of the views of\r\nthe committee.\r\n\r\nWhen Montrose saw the covenanting army approach from Hollandbush,\r\nhe was exceedingly delighted, as, from the excellent state of his\r\narmy, the courageous bearing of his men, and the advantage of his\r\nposition, he calculated upon obtaining a decisive victory, which\r\nmight enable him to advance into England and retrieve the affairs of\r\nhis sovereign in that kingdom. But while Montrose was thus joyfully\r\nanticipating a victory which, he flattered himself, would be crowned\r\nwith results the most favourable to the royal cause, an incident\r\noccurred which might have proved fatal to his hopes, had he not, with\r\nthat wonderful self-possession and consummate prudence for which he\r\nwas so distinguished, turned that very incident to his own advantage.\r\nAmong the covenanting cavalry was a regiment of cuirassiers, the\r\nappearance of whose armour, glittering in the sun, struck such terror\r\ninto Montrose’s horse, that they hesitated about engaging with such\r\nformidable antagonists, and, while riding along the line to encourage\r\nhis men and give the necessary directions, Montrose heard his cavalry\r\nmuttering among themselves and complaining that they were now for\r\nthe first time to fight with men clad in iron, whose bodies would\r\nbe quite impenetrable to their swords. When the terror of a foe has\r\nonce taken hold of the mind, it can only be sufficiently eradicated\r\nby supplanting it with a feeling of contempt for the object of its\r\ndread, and no man was better fitted by nature than Montrose for\r\ninspiring such a feeling into the minds of his troops. Accordingly,\r\nscarcely had the murmurings of his cavalry broken upon his ears,\r\nwhen he rode up to the head of his cavalry, and (pointing to the\r\ncuirassiers) thus addressed his men:--“Gentlemen, these are the\r\nsame men you beat at Alford, that ran away from you at Auldearn,\r\nTippermuir, &c.; they are such cowardly rascals that their officers\r\ncould not bring them to look you in the face till they had clad them\r\nin armour; to show our contempt of them we’ll fight them in our\r\nshirts.”[320] No sooner had these words been uttered, when, to add\r\nto the impression they could not fail to produce, Montrose threw off\r\nhis coat and waistcoat, and, drawing his sword with the air of a\r\nhero, stood before his men, at once an object of their wonder and a\r\nmodel for their imitation. The effect was instantaneous. The example\r\nthus set by Montrose was immediately followed by the whole army,\r\nevery man stripping himself to his shirt, and the cavalry, partaking\r\nin the general enthusiasm, assured themselves of victory. As the day\r\nwas uncommonly hot and oppressive, the troops found great relief by\r\ndisburdening themselves of their clothes, and the infantry were,\r\nin consequence, enabled to display greater agility in combat. The\r\nextraordinary appearance of Montrose’s men after they had parted with\r\ntheir clothes, excited the astonishment of the Covenanters, and as\r\nthey could only attribute such a singular preparation for battle to\r\na fixed determination on the part of the royalists to conquer or to\r\ndie, fearful doubts arose in their minds as to the probable result of\r\nthe contest in which they were just about to engage.\r\n\r\nIn moving to take up the new position which had been assigned to it\r\nby the committee, the utmost disorder prevailed among the covenanting\r\narmy, which the general was unable to correct. Indeed, so unruly\r\nhad the troops become, that some regiments, instead of taking\r\nthe stations assigned to them by the commander, took up, at the\r\nsuggestion of Argyle, quite different ground, while others, in utter\r\ndisregard of Baillie’s instructions, actually selected positions\r\nfor themselves. Thus, at the moment the battle was about to begin,\r\nBaillie found all his plans completely overruled, and as he now\r\nsaw how utterly impossible it would be for him to carry any of his\r\ncontemplated arrangements into effect, he was necessitated to engage\r\nMontrose under the most unfavourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe covenanting general, however, might have so accommodated himself\r\nin the unexpected dilemma in which he had been placed as to have\r\nprevented the disastrous result which followed, had not his horse\r\nregiments, from an impression that Montrose had begun a retreat,\r\nrashly commenced the action before all the infantry had come up, by\r\nattempting to carry the cottages and gardens in which the advanced\r\nguard of Montrose was placed. Although they made a violent charge,\r\nthey were as warmly received by Montrose’s musketeers, who, being\r\nprotected by the dikes and enclosures, kept up such a galling fire\r\nupon their assailants as to oblige them to retreat with precipitation\r\nand some loss.\r\n\r\nA body of about 1,000 Highlanders, who were posted next to Montrose’s\r\nadvanced guard, became so suddenly elated with this success that,\r\nwithout waiting for orders from Montrose, they immediately ran up\r\nthat part of the hill where the main body of the covenanting army\r\nwas posted. Montrose was highly displeased with the Highlanders\r\nfor this rash act, which seemed to threaten them with instant\r\ndestruction; but there was no time for remonstrance, and as he saw\r\nan absolute necessity for supporting this intrepid body, he stifled\r\nhis displeasure, and began to consider how he could most effectually\r\nafford support. Owing to the tardy advance of the enemy’s rear,\r\nit was some little time before the covenanting army attacked this\r\nresolute body. At length three troops of horse and a body of about\r\n2,000 foot were seen advancing against them, and in a short time both\r\nparties closed upon each other. The Highlanders, as usual, displayed\r\ngreat intrepidity, and firmly maintained their ground; but as it\r\nwas evident that they could not long withstand the overwhelming\r\nforce opposed to them, the Earl of Aboyne, who, with a select body\r\nof horsemen, had been placed by Montrose at some distance from the\r\nmain army, taking with him 12 horsemen, rode forward to see if he\r\ncould render any assistance. Seeing the critical position in which\r\nthe rash Highlanders were placed, he sent back for the cavalry to\r\nadvance immediately, at the same time bravely shouting to the few\r\nfollowers that were with him, “Let us go, Monsieurs, and assist\r\nthese our distressed friends, in so great hazard through the foolish\r\nrashness of their commander. We shall, God willing, bring them off,\r\nat least in some good order, so as they shall neither be all lost,\r\nnor endanger the army by their sudden flight, whereto they may be\r\nforced.”[321] He thereupon charged the enemy’s lancers, who, seeing\r\nhim make such a furious onset, retired to the left, thus putting the\r\nfoot between themselves and Aboyne. The latter, without halting,\r\ncharged forward upon the foot, until, when within pistol-shot, he\r\nperceived them preparing to receive him upon their pikes. He then\r\nnimbly turned a little to the left, and charged with such impetuosity\r\nand suddenness a regiment of musketeers, that although they received\r\nhim with three volleys from the three first ranks, he broke right\r\nthrough them, till he came out to where his distressed friends were\r\nenvironed with horse and foot, and so sorely straightened as to be\r\ncrying out for quarter. His presence caused them to rally, and they\r\ntook heart as he cried with a lusty voice, “Courage, my hearts,\r\nfollow me, and let them have one sound charge.” “And this he gives\r\nwith such brave and invincible resolution, as he breaks, disperses,\r\nand discourages both foot and horse, who seek no more to pursue, but\r\nstrive to retire in order, to the which their commanders often invite\r\nthem, but in vain.” They got into complete disorder, and began to\r\nrun for their lives. What had been begun by Aboyne, was completed by\r\nthe Earl of Airly, who, at the urgent request of Montrose, now came\r\nup at the head of the Ogilvies to the assistance of the Highlanders.\r\nMontrose had made several ineffectual attempts to induce different\r\nparties of his army to volunteer in defence of the brave men who\r\nwere struggling for their existence within view of their companions\r\nin arms, and, as a _dernier ressort_, appealed to his tried friend\r\nthe Earl of Airly, in behalf of the rash men who had thus exposed\r\nthemselves to imminent danger. This appeal to the chivalrous feelings\r\nof the venerable earl met with a ready and willing response from him,\r\nand after stating his readiness to undertake the duty assigned him,\r\nhe immediately put himself at the head of a troop of his own horse,\r\ncommanded by Colonel John Ogilvie of Baldavie, who had distinguished\r\nhimself in the Swedish service, and rode off with great speed towards\r\nthe enemy. He instantly ordered his squadron to charge the enemy’s\r\nhorse, who were so closely pressed that they got entangled among the\r\ncovenanting foot, whom they put into disorder.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Baillie perceived that his horse were falling back, he\r\nendeavoured to bring up his reserve to support them; but this body,\r\nwhich consisted chiefly of the Fife militia, became so alarmed at\r\nthe retreat of the horse, that they immediately abandoned their ranks\r\nand fled. On the other hand, the rest of Montrose’s men, encouraged\r\nby the success of the Ogilvies, could no longer restrain themselves,\r\nand rushing forward upon the enemy with a loud shout, completed the\r\ndisorder. The wild appearance of the royalists, added to the dreadful\r\nyells which they set up, created such a panic among the astonished\r\nCovenanters, that, in an instant, and as if by a simultaneous\r\nimpulse, every man threw away his arms, and endeavoured to secure\r\nhis personal safety by flight. In the general rout which ensued, the\r\ncovenanting horse, in their anxiety to escape, galloped through the\r\nflying foot, and trampled many of their companions in arms almost to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit which followed, Montrose’s men cut down the\r\ndefenceless Covenanters without mercy, and so great was the carnage,\r\nthat, out of a body of upwards of 6,000 foot, probably not more than\r\n100 escaped with their lives. The royalists were so intent upon\r\nhewing down the unfortunate foot, that a considerable part of the\r\ncavalry effected their escape. Some of them, however, in the hurry of\r\ntheir flight, having run unawares into a large morass, called Dolater\r\nbog, now forming a part of the bed of the Forth and Clyde canal,\r\nthere perished, and, many years afterwards, the bodies of men and\r\nhorses were dug up from the bog, without any marks of decomposition;\r\nand there is a tradition still current, that one man was found upon\r\nhorseback, fully attired in his military costume, in the very posture\r\nin which he had sunk.[322] Very few prisoners were taken, and with\r\nthe exception of Sir William Murray of Blebo, James Arnot, brother\r\nto Lord Burleigh, and Colonels Dyce and Wallace, and a few other\r\ngentlemen, who received quarter, and, after being well treated by\r\nMontrose, were afterwards released upon parole, all the officers of\r\nthe covenanting army escaped. Some of them fled to Stirling, and\r\ntook temporary refuge in the castle; others galloped down to the\r\nsouth shore of the Frith of Forth. Among the latter, Argyle was the\r\nmost conspicuous, who, according to Bishop Guthry, “never looked\r\nover his shoulder until, after 20 miles’ riding, he reached the\r\nSouth Queensferry, where he possessed himself of a boat again.”[323]\r\nWishart sarcastically observes, that this was the third time that\r\nArgyle had “saved himself by means of a boat; and, even then, he did\r\nnot reckon himself secure till they had weighed anchor and carried\r\nthe vessel out to sea.”[324]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the baggage, arms, and stores, belonging to the\r\ncovenanting army were captured by the royalists. The loss on the side\r\nof Montrose was, as usual, extremely trifling, amounting, it is said,\r\nonly to six or eight men, three of whom were Ogilvies, who fell in\r\nthe charge which decided the fortune of the day.\r\n\r\nThe news of this disastrous and melancholy defeat, speedily spread\r\nthroughout the kingdom and filled it with mourning. The plague,\r\nwhich had devastated some of the most populous of the covenanting\r\ndistricts, was still carrying on its depopulating career, and\r\nthe spirits of the people, already broken and subdued under that\r\nscourge, were reduced to a state almost bordering on despair, when\r\nthey received the afflicting intelligence of the utter annihilation\r\nof an army on which their only hopes were placed. No alternative,\r\ntherefore, now remained for them but unconditional submission to the\r\nconqueror, and accordingly, deputies were sent to him from different\r\nparts of the kingdom, to assure him of the return of the people to\r\ntheir allegiance to the king, to proffer their obedience to Montrose\r\nas his lieutenant, and to offer him assistance in support of the\r\nroyal cause. The nobility and other persons of note who had hitherto\r\nkept aloof, or whose loyalty had been questionable, also crowded\r\nto the royal standard to congratulate Montrose upon the favourable\r\naspect of affairs and to offer their services.\r\n\r\nWhile at Kilsyth, two commissioners, Sir Robert Douglas and Mr.\r\nArchibald Fleming, commissary, arrived at Montrose’s camp on the part\r\nof the inhabitants of Glasgow, to obtain favour and forgiveness,\r\nby congratulating him upon his success, and inviting him to visit\r\ntheir city. Montrose received these commissioners and the other\r\nnumerous deputations and individuals who afterwards waited on him,\r\nnot merely with courtesy but with kindness, and promised to bury all\r\npast occurrences in perfect oblivion, but on the condition that they\r\nshould return to their allegiance and conduct themselves in future\r\nas loyal subjects. “The whole country now,” says Wishart, “resounded\r\nMontrose’s praise. His unparalleled magnanimity and bravery, his\r\nhappiness in devising his plan of operations, and his quickness in\r\nexecuting them, his unshaken resolution and intrepidity, even in the\r\ngreatest dangers, and his patience in bearing the severest hardships\r\nand fatigues; his faithfulness and strict observance of his promises\r\nto such as submitted, and his clemency towards his prisoners; in\r\nshort, that heroic virtue which displayed itself in all his actions,\r\nwas extolled to the skies, and filled the mouths of all ranks of men,\r\nand several poems and panegyrics were wrote upon this occasion.”[325]\r\nIt is believed, however, that there was little sincerity in these\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nThis submission of the people was accelerated by the dispersion of\r\nthe Covenant nobility, an event that put a temporary end to the\r\ngovernment which they had established. Argyle, Crawford, Lanark, and\r\nothers, sought protection in Berwick, and Glencairn, and Cassilis\r\ntook refuge in Ireland.\r\n\r\nMontrose might now have marched directly upon, and seized the\r\ncapital, where many of his friends were confined as prisoners; but he\r\nconsidered it of more importance to march to the west and disperse\r\nsome levies which were there raising. Accordingly, after refreshing\r\nhis troops two days at Kilsyth, he dispatched a strong body under the\r\ncommand of Macdonald, his major-general, into Ayrshire to suppress\r\na rising under the Earls of Cassilis and Glencairn; and with the\r\nremainder of his army he proceeded towards Glasgow, which he entered\r\namidst the general acclamations of the citizens. Here Montrose\r\nimmediately commenced an inquiry into the conduct of the leading\r\nCovenanters of the city, some of whom he put to death as a terror to\r\nothers. Montrose remained only a day in Glasgow, and encamped the\r\nfollowing day on Bothwell moor, about twelve miles from the city.\r\nHis object in doing so, was to put an end to some excesses on the\r\npart of his Irish and Highland troops, whom, from the precarious\r\ntenure of their services, and his inability to pay them, he could not\r\nventure to control by the severities of martial law.[326] And as he\r\nwas apprehensive that some of his men might lurk behind, or visit the\r\ncity for the purpose of plunder, he allowed the inhabitants to form a\r\nguard among themselves to protect it. The citizens, in gratitude for\r\nthe favour and clemency thus shown them, presented Montrose with the\r\nsum of 10,000 merks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Major-general Macdonald arrived in Ayrshire, where\r\nhe was received with open arms. The levies, which had been raised\r\nin the west quietly dispersed; and, as above mentioned, the Earls\r\nof Cassilis and Glencairn fled to Ireland. The Countess of Loudon,\r\nwhose husband had acted a conspicuous part against the king, received\r\nMacdonald with great kindness at Loudon castle, embracing him in her\r\narms, and entertaining him with great splendour and hospitality; she\r\neven sent a servant to Montrose to offer her respects to him.[327]\r\n\r\nDuring Montrose’s stay at Bothwell, where he remained till the 4th\r\nof September, he was waited upon by many of the nobility in person,\r\nto congratulate him upon his recent victory, and to tender their\r\nservices. Others sent similar communications by their friends. The\r\nMarquis of Douglas, the Earls of Linlithgow and Annandale, Lords\r\nSeton, Drummond, Fleming, Maderty, Carnegie and Johnston, were\r\namong the first who came forward. Deputations also arrived from the\r\ncounties of Linlithgow, Lanark, Renfrew, and Ayr, and also from the\r\ntowns of Greenock, Ayr, and Irvine, to implore forgiveness for past\r\noffences, and to give pledges for their future loyalty. Montrose\r\nreceived them all very graciously, and relying upon their assurances,\r\ngranted them an amnesty.\r\n\r\nMontrose expected that the city of Edinburgh, which had been the\r\nfocus of rebellion, would have followed the example of Glasgow and\r\nthe other towns; but whether from obstinacy or from the dread of\r\na refusal of pardon, the authorities did not send commissioners to\r\nMontrose, and it was not until a body of the royalist horse appeared\r\nwithin four miles of the city, that they resolved to proffer their\r\nsubmission, and to throw themselves on the mercy of the conqueror.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Kilsyth, Montrose dispatched his nephew,\r\nArchibald, Master of Napier, and Nathaniel Gordon, with a select body\r\nof horse, to summon Edinburgh to surrender, to secure its obedience\r\nand fidelity, and to set at liberty the royalist prisoners, many of\r\nwhom were confined in the Tolbooth. Should the city refuse to submit,\r\nit was to be subjected to fire and sword. On his way to Edinburgh,\r\nNapier set at liberty his father and wife, Stirling of Keir, his\r\nbrother-in-law, and sisters, from the prison of Linlithgow. When\r\nfour miles from Edinburgh they came to a halt, and waited to see how\r\nthe citizens would conduct themselves. The inhabitants, so far from\r\nhaving any intention of resisting the royal army, were in a state\r\nof consternation and despair lest their submission should not be\r\naccepted by Montrose, “accusing themselves as sacrilegious, perjured\r\nand ungrateful traitors, unworthy of that clemency and forgiveness\r\nfor which they so ardently prayed.” In the most grovelling and humble\r\nmanner they besought the prisoners, whom not long before they had\r\ntreated with harshness and contempt, to intercede with Montrose on\r\ntheir behalf, promising to submit to any conditions.\r\n\r\nThe citizens, having chosen deputies, selected from the prisoners two\r\nof the most eminent and stanch royalists, Ludovic Earl of Crawford\r\nand James Lord Ogilvie, the Earl of Airly’s son, to wait upon\r\nMontrose and introduce the deputation, implore his pardon, and tender\r\nthe city’s humble submission. These two noblemen and the deputies\r\nhaving joined Napier, the latter returned directly to his uncle\r\nMontrose, who was unfeignedly delighted at the sight of his dear\r\nfriends Crawford and Ogilvie.\r\n\r\nThe city delegates, on being admitted to audience, “made a free\r\nsurrender to him of the town, and humbly deprecated his vengeance\r\nand implored his pardon and forgiveness, promising, in name of the\r\nwhole inhabitants, an inviolable fidelity and obedience for the\r\nfuture, and committing themselves and all their concerns to his\r\npatronage and protection, which they humbly entreated he would grant\r\nthem. They promised also, immediately to release all the prisoners\r\nin their custody, and desired him to assure himself that any thing\r\nelse he should desire of them should be instantly complied with. The\r\ntown, they said, had been almost depopulated by a dreadful plague,\r\nso that no supplies of men could be expected from it; but they were\r\nready to contribute all they could to defray the expense of what\r\ntroops he might raise in other places. Above all, they most earnestly\r\nimplored him to intercede for them with their most gracious and\r\nmerciful king, to obtain his pity and pardon, and that he would not\r\ncondemn the whole city for the crime of rebellion, in which they had\r\nbeen involved by the craft and example of a few seditious men, armed\r\nwith power and authority. Montrose gave them reason to hope for the\r\nroyal forgiveness; and the only conditions he required of them, were,\r\nsacredly to observe their loyalty and allegiance to his majesty for\r\nthe future; to renounce all correspondence with the rebels, whether\r\nwithin or without the kingdom: the castle of Edinburgh, which he well\r\nknew was then in their power, he required they should surrender to\r\nthe king’s officers; and that, as soon as the delegates returned to\r\nthe city, all the prisoners should be immediately set at liberty, and\r\nsent to his camp.”[328]\r\n\r\nAlthough the commissioners agreed to these conditions, and promised\r\nto perform them, the only one they ever fulfilled was that which\r\nstipulated the release of the prisoners, who were immediately on\r\nthe return of the commissioners sent to Montrose’s camp. Indeed, it\r\nwas scarcely to be expected, from the character of the times, that\r\nthe citizens of Edinburgh, who had all along been warm partisans\r\nof the covenanting interest, would show a readiness to comply with\r\nstipulations which had been extorted from their commissioners under\r\nthe circumstances we have mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhile at Bothwell, Montrose received various communications from\r\nthe king, who was then at Oxford. The most important of these were\r\ntwo commissions under the great seal, one appointing Montrose\r\nCaptain-general and Lieutenant-governor of Scotland, and conferring\r\non him full powers to raise forces, punish state offenders, and make\r\nknights, &c.; and the other authorising him to summon a parliament\r\nto meet at Glasgow, to settle the affairs of the kingdom. The bearer\r\nof these important documents was Sir Robert Spottiswood, formerly\r\npresident of the Court of Session, and who now acted as secretary of\r\nstate for Scotland. As a person so well known as Sir Robert could not\r\ntravel by any of the ordinary roads without risk of apprehension,\r\nhe took a circuitous route from Oxford, passing through Wales, and\r\nthence crossing over to the Isle of Man, took shipping and landed\r\nin the West Highlands. From Lochaber he proceeded down into Athole,\r\nwhence he was conducted by a party of Athole-men to Montrose, at\r\nBothwell Moor.\r\n\r\nThe instructions brought by Sir Robert Spottiswood, regarding the\r\nholding of a parliament and the matters connected therewith, were\r\nin the meantime superseded by orders from the king of a later date,\r\nbrought by a more direct route. By these he was directed to march\r\nimmediately to the borders, where he would, it was said, be joined\r\nby the Earls of Roxburgh, Traquair, and Home, and the other royalist\r\nnobility of the southern counties, at the head of their numerous\r\nvassals and tenants, as well as by a body of horse which his majesty\r\nwould send from England; that, with these united forces, he should\r\nwatch the motions of General David Leslie, who was advancing to the\r\nnorth with a body of 6,000 cavalry. In fact, Leslie, who had acquired\r\ngreat celebrity by his conduct in the battle of Marston Moor, had\r\nreached Berwick in the beginning of September, having been called\r\nthither on his road to Hereford by the covenanting nobility, who had\r\ntaken refuge there after the battle of Kilsyth.\r\n\r\nMontrose reviewed his army on the 3d of September, on which occasion\r\nSir Robert Spottiswood delivered to him the commission appointing\r\nhim his majesty’s Lieutenant-governor for Scotland and General of\r\nall his majesty’s forces.[329] After this and the other commission\r\nhad been read, Montrose addressed his army in a short and feeling\r\nspeech, in the course of which he took occasion to praise their\r\nbravery and loyalty, and expressed great affection for them. In\r\nconclusion, addressing Macdonald, his major-general, he bestowed upon\r\nhim the tribute of his praise, and, by virtue of the power with which\r\nhe had been invested, conferred upon him the honour of knighthood,\r\nin presence of the whole army. Little did Montrose imagine, that\r\nthe man whose services he was now so justly rewarding had resolved\r\nimmediately to abandon him, and, under the pretence of revenging some\r\ninjuries which his friends had sustained at the hands of Argyle four\r\nyears before, to quit for ever the service of his royal master.\r\n\r\nMontrose’s ranks had, before the review alluded to, been thinned\r\nby private desertions among the Highlanders, who carried off with\r\nthem all the booty they had been able to collect; but as soon as\r\nMontrose announced his intention, in terms of the instructions he\r\nhad received from the king, to march south, the Highlanders in a\r\nbody demanded liberty to return home for a short time to repair\r\ntheir houses, which had been reduced to ruins by the enemy, and to\r\nprovide a stock of provisions for their wives and families during\r\nthe ensuing winter. To induce Montrose to comply the more readily\r\nwith their request, they promised to return to his camp within\r\nforty days, and to bring some of their friends along with them. As\r\nMontrose saw that the Highlanders were determined to depart, and\r\nthat consequently any attempt to retain them would be unavailing,\r\nhe dissembled the displeasure he felt, and after thanking them in\r\nthe king’s name for their services, and entreating them to return\r\nto him as soon as possible, he granted them leave of absence with\r\napparent goodwill. But when Sir Alaster Macdonald also announced his\r\nintention to return to the Highlands, Montrose could not conceal his\r\nchagrin, and strongly remonstrated against such a step. “Montrose,”\r\nsays Guthry, “dealt most seriously with him to have staid until they\r\nhad been absolute conquerors, promising then to go thither himself,\r\nand be concurring with him in punishing them, (Argyle and his\r\nparty,) as they deserved; and withal told him that his separating\r\nat this time must be the occasion of ruin to them both. But all was\r\nto no purpose; he would needs be gone, and for a reason enlarged\r\nhimself in reckoning up the Marquis of Argyle’s cruelties against\r\nhis friends, who, as he said, did four years ago draw his father\r\nand brother to Inverary upon trust, and then made them prisoners;\r\nand since, (his friends having retired to the isles of Jura and\r\nRachlin for shelter,) sent Ardkinlass and the captain of Skipness to\r\nthe said isles to murder them, which, (said he,) they did without\r\nmercy, sparing neither women nor children. With such discourses\r\nhe justified his departure, and would not be hindered.” Macdonald\r\naccordingly, after returning thanks to Montrose in a formal oration\r\nfor the favours he had received, and pledging himself for the early\r\nreturn of the Highlanders, departed for the Highlands on the day of\r\nthe review, accompanied by about 3,000 Highlanders, the _elite_ of\r\nMontrose’s army, and by 120 of the best of the Irish troops, whom he\r\nhad selected as a body guard.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of such a large body of men, consisting of the flower\r\nof his army, was a subject of the deepest concern to Montrose, whose\r\nsole reliance for support against the powerful force of Leslie, now\r\ndepended upon the precarious succours he might obtain on his march\r\nto the south. Under such circumstances a commander more prudent than\r\nMontrose would have hesitated about the course to be pursued, and\r\nwould probably have either remained for some time in his position,\r\ntill the levies raising in the south should assemble, or retreat\r\nacross the Forth, and there awaited reinforcements from the north;\r\nbut the ardent and chivalrous feelings of Montrose so blinded him, as\r\nto make him altogether disregard prudential considerations, and the\r\nsplendour of his victories had dazzled his imagination so much, as to\r\ninduce him to believe that he had only to engage the enemy to defeat\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the day following the departure of the Highlanders,\r\nviz., the 4th of September, Montrose began his march to the south;\r\nbut he had not proceeded far, when he had the mortification to find\r\nhimself also abandoned by the Earl of Aboyne, who not only carried\r\noff the whole of his own men, but induced the other horsemen of the\r\nnorth, who were not of his party, to accompany him. Sir Nathaniel\r\nGordon appears to have been the only individual of the name of Gordon\r\nwho remained behind. The cause of such a hasty proceeding on the part\r\nof the Earl of Aboyne, is not very evident; but it seems probable,\r\nthat his lordship had taken some offence at Montrose, who, according\r\nto a partisan of the Gordon family, arrogated to himself all the\r\nhonour of the victories which the earl had greatly contributed to\r\nobtain.[330]\r\n\r\nThe army of Montrose was now reduced to a mere handful of men,\r\nconsisting only of about 200 gentlemen who had joined him at\r\nBothwell, and 700 foot, chiefly Irish.[331] Yet he resolved to\r\nproceed on his march, and reached Cranstoun-Kirk in Mid-Lothian,\r\non Saturday the 6th of September, where he received intelligence\r\nthat General David Leslie had arrived at Berwick with a great body\r\nof cavalry. He encamped at Cranstoun-Kirk with the intention of\r\nremaining there over the Sunday, and hearing Dr. Wishart preach;\r\nbut having, the following morning, been put in possession of a\r\ncorrespondence between Leslie and the heads of the Covenanters, at\r\nBerwick, which developed their plans, he quickly raised his camp,\r\nwithout waiting for sermon, and advanced into the district of the\r\nGala. A more imprudent step than this cannot be well conceived, as\r\nMontrose threw his little band into the jaws of Leslie’s army, which\r\nwas lying ready to pounce upon him. In his march along Gala-water, he\r\nwas joined by the Marquis of Douglas and Lord Ogilvie at the head of\r\na small party, the remains of a larger body which had been diminished\r\nby desertion. Montrose was waited upon at Galashiels by the Earl of\r\nTraquair, who professed the most fervent attachment to the king, and\r\npromised to obtain information for him respecting Leslie’s movements;\r\nand in proof of his sincerity, sent his son Lord Linton with a troop\r\nof well-mounted horse, who joined him the following day.\r\n\r\nFrom Galashiels Montrose marched to Kelso, where he expected to be\r\njoined by the Earls of Home and Roxburgh, and their vassals; but on\r\nhis arrival there, he was surprised to find that these two noblemen\r\nhad taken no measures to raise the levies they had promised. He,\r\ntherefore, resolved to pay them a visit, to compel them to fulfil\r\ntheir engagements; but anticipating such a step, they had allowed\r\nthemselves to be made voluntary prisoners by a party of Leslie’s\r\nhorse and carried to Berwick. Roxburgh, whom Wishart calls “a cunning\r\nold fox,” was the contriver of this artful scheme, which, while it\r\nsecured him and his colleague Home the favour of the Covenanters, was\r\nintended to induce the king to believe that they were suffering for\r\ntheir loyalty.\r\n\r\nThis act of perfidy opened the eyes of Montrose to the danger of his\r\nsituation, and made him instantly resolve to retrace his steps, so as\r\nto prevent his retreat to the north being cut off by David Leslie,\r\nwho had by this time crossed the Tweed. He, therefore, marched from\r\nKelso westward to Jedburgh, and from thence to Selkirk, where he\r\narrived on the 12th of September, and encamped that night in a wood,\r\ncalled Hareheadwood, in the neighbourhood of the town at the head of\r\na long and level piece of ground called Philiphaugh, on the north\r\nbank of the Ettrick. Montrose himself, with his horse, took up his\r\nquarters in the town.\r\n\r\nThe position thus selected by Montrose was well calculated to prevent\r\nhis being taken by surprise, as Leslie, from the direction in which\r\nhe had necessarily to advance, could only approach it by coming up\r\nthe open vale of Philiphaugh; but unfortunately, Montrose did not,\r\non this occasion, take those extraordinary precautions which he had\r\nbeen accustomed to do. It had always been his practice hitherto, to\r\nsuperintend in person the setting of the night watches, and to give\r\ninstructions himself to the sentinels, and to the scouts he sent\r\nout, to watch the motions of the enemy; but having important letters\r\nto write to the king, which he was desirous of sending off before\r\nthe break of day by a trusty messenger, he intrusted these details\r\nto his cavalry officers, whom he exhorted to great vigilance, and\r\nto take care that the scouts kept a sharp outlook for the enemy.\r\nMontrose had the utmost confidence in the wisdom and integrity of his\r\nofficers, whose long experience in military affairs he had many times\r\nwitnessed; and as there seemed to be no immediate danger, he thought\r\nthat, for one night at least, he could safely leave the direction of\r\naffairs to such men.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied during the night preparing his dispatches for the\r\nking, Montrose received several loose reports, from time to time,\r\nrespecting the alleged movements of the enemy, of which he sent due\r\nnotice to his officers, but he was as often assured, both by the\r\nreports of his officers and of the scouts, that not a vestige of an\r\nenemy was to be seen. Thus the night passed without any apparent\r\nfoundation for the supposition that the enemy was at hand, and to\r\nmake assurance doubly sure, some of the fleetest of the cavalry\r\nwere sent out at break of day to reconnoitre. On their return, they\r\nstated that they had examined with care all the roads and passes for\r\nten miles round, and solemnly averred, that there was not the least\r\nappearance of an enemy within the range they had just scoured. Yet\r\nsingular as the fact may appear, Leslie was lying at that very time\r\nat Melrose, with 4,000 horse, within six miles of Montrose’s camp.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on the day of Montrose’s march from Jedburgh,\r\nGeneral Leslie, who had a few days before crossed the Tweed at\r\nBerwick, held a council of war on Gladsmuir in East Lothian, at\r\nwhich it was determined that he should proceed towards Stirling to\r\ncut off Montrose’s retreat to the Highlands, whither it was supposed\r\nthat he meant instantly to retire, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nreinforcements. But the council had scarcely risen, when letters were\r\nbrought to Leslie, acquainting him with the low and impaired state\r\nof Montrose’s forces, and his design of marching into Dumfries-shire\r\nto procure an accession of strength. On receiving this intelligence,\r\nLeslie abandoned his plan of marching northward, and ordering his\r\narmy to turn to the left, he immediately marched to the south, and\r\nentering the vale of Gala, proceeded to Melrose, where he took up\r\nhis quarters for the night, intending to attack Montrose’s little\r\nband next morning, in the hope of annihilating it altogether.\r\nBoth Wishart and Guthry suspect that the Earl of Traquair was the\r\ninformant, and they rest their conjecture upon the circumstance\r\nof his having withdrawn during the night, (without acquainting\r\nMontrose,) the troop of horse under his son, Lord Linton; but this\r\nis not sufficient, of itself, to warrant us in charging him with such\r\nan act.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstance which\r\npreceded the battle of Philiphaugh, was, that although Leslie was\r\nwithin six miles of Montrose’s camp, neither the scouts nor the\r\ncavalry, who are stated to have scoured the country for four miles\r\nbeyond the place where Leslie lay, could discover, as they reported,\r\nany traces of him. Did the scouts deceive Montrose, or did they not\r\nproceed in the direction of Leslie’s camp, or did they confine their\r\nperambulations within a more limited range? These are questions which\r\nit is impossible to answer with any degree of certainty. But what\r\nis to be said of the cavalry who having made their observations at\r\nday-break, and confessedly several miles beyond the enemy’s camp,\r\nreturned as luckless as the midnight scouts? The only plausible\r\nanswer that can be given to this question is, either that they had\r\nnot visited the neighbourhood of Melrose, or that a thick mist which\r\nprevailed on the morning of the 13th of September, had concealed\r\nthe enemy from their view. However, be this as it may, certain it\r\nis that owing to the thickness of the fog, Leslie was enabled to\r\nadvance, unobserved, till he came within half a mile of Montrose’s\r\nhead quarters. On the alarm occasioned by this sudden and unexpected\r\nappearance of the enemy, Montrose instantly sprung upon the first\r\nhorse that came to hand, and galloped off to his camp. On his\r\narrival, he fortunately found that all his men, though the hour was\r\nvery early, had risen, but considerable disorder prevailed in the\r\ncamp in consequence of preparations they were making for an immediate\r\nmarch into Dumfries-shire in terms of instructions they had received\r\nthe previous evening. The cavalry, however, were quite dismounted,\r\nsome of the officers were absent, and their horses were scattered\r\nthrough the adjoining fields taking their morning repast. Short as\r\nthe time was for putting his small band in a defensive position,\r\nMontrose acted with his accustomed presence of mind, and before\r\nthe enemy commenced his attack, he had succeeded in drawing up his\r\nmen in order of battle, in the position which they had occupied\r\nthe preceding night. Nothing but self-preservation, on which the\r\ncause of the king, his master, was chiefly dependant, could have\r\njustified Montrose in attempting to resist the powerful force now\r\nabout to assail him. With about 1,000 foot and 500 horse, the greater\r\npart of which was composed of raw and undisciplined levies hastily\r\nbrought into the field, and lukewarm in the cause, he had to resist\r\nthe attack of a body of about 6,000 veteran troops, chiefly English\r\ncavalry, who had distinguished themselves at the battle of Marston\r\nMoor, and who, though they could make no addition to their laurels\r\nby defeating such a handful of men, may be supposed to have been\r\nespecially desirous of annihilating the remains of an army which had\r\nbeen so long formidable and victorious.\r\n\r\nThe covenanting general began the battle by charging Montrose’s right\r\nwing, consisting of horse, with the great body of his cavalry; but so\r\nfirmly was the charge received by the brave cavaliers with Montrose\r\nat their head, that the assailants were forced to retire with loss.\r\nA second charge met a similar fate. Thus foiled in their attempts\r\non the right, they next attacked Montrose’s left wing, consisting\r\nof foot, which, after a gallant resistance, retired a little up the\r\nface of the hill, where it was posted, to avoid the attacks of the\r\ncavalry. While this struggle was going on on the left, a body of\r\n2,000 covenanting foot which had made a circuitous route, appeared\r\nin the rear of the right wing, which they attacked. The right wing\r\nnot being able to resist this force, and apprehensive that a new\r\nattack would be made upon them by the enemy’s cavalry, and that\r\nthey would thus be surrounded and perhaps cut to pieces, fled from\r\nthe field. The foot who had taken up a position on the side of the\r\nhill, being thus abandoned to their fate, surrendered themselves as\r\nprisoners of war after a slight resistance; but horrible to tell,\r\nthey were afterwards shot by orders of the covenanting general, at\r\nthe instigation, it is said, of some presbyterian ministers, who\r\ndeclared that no faith should be kept with such persons.\r\n\r\nMontrose was still on the field with about 30 brave cavaliers, and\r\nwitnessed the rout of one part of his army and the surrender of\r\nanother, with the most poignant feelings of regret. He might have\r\ninstantly retreated with safety, but he could not brook the idea of\r\nrunning away, and, therefore, resolved not to abandon the post of\r\nhonour, but to fight to the last extremity, and to sell his life as\r\ndearly as possible. It was not long before he and his noble band\r\nwere nearly surrounded by the enemy, who kept pressing so hard upon\r\nhim, and in such numbers, as almost to preclude the possibility of\r\nescape. Yet they did not venture to attack Montrose and his brave\r\nassociates in a body, but in detached parties, every one of which was\r\nsuccessively repulsed with loss. As the enemy grew tired of attacking\r\nhim, and seemed to be more intent upon plundering his baggage than\r\ncapturing his person, Montrose saw that the danger was not so great\r\nas he supposed, and therefore he began to reflect upon the folly\r\nof sacrificing his life so long as a ray of hope remained. He had\r\nlost a battle, no doubt; but in this there was no dishonour when\r\nthe disparity of his force with that of the enemy was considered.\r\nBesides, he had lost few of his men, and the Highlanders, on whom\r\nhe chiefly relied, were still entire, and were ready to take the\r\nfield as soon as he appeared again among them. And as to the effect\r\nwhich such a defeat might be supposed to have upon the adherents of\r\nthe king, who were still numerous and powerful, it could be easily\r\nremoved as soon as they saw him again at the head of a fresh force.\r\nThat he could only expect to retrieve the present state of affairs\r\nby escaping from the present danger and raising new troops; but\r\nthat if he rashly sacrificed his life the king’s affairs might be\r\nirretrievably ruined. These reflections being seconded by the Marquis\r\nof Douglas and a few trusty friends, who implored him not to throw\r\naway a life so valuable to the king and to the country, Montrose\r\nresolved to consult his safety by an immediate flight. Putting\r\nhimself, therefore, at the head of his troop, he cut his way through\r\nthe enemy, without the loss of a single man. They were pursued by a\r\nparty of horse, some of whom they killed, and actually carried off\r\none Bruce, a captain of horse, and two standard-bearers, with their\r\nensigns, as prisoners. Montrose went in the direction of Peebles,\r\nwhich he entered about sunset, and here he was joined by various\r\nstraggling parties of his men who had escaped.\r\n\r\nMontrose lost in this engagement very few of his horse, but a\r\nconsiderable part of his foot was destroyed. He carried off, as we\r\nhave seen, two of the enemy’s standards, and fortunately preserved\r\nhis own, two in number, from the enemy. That belonging to his\r\ninfantry was saved by an Irish soldier of great bravery, who, on\r\nseeing the battle lost, and the enemy in possession of the field,\r\ntore it from the pole, and, wrapping it round his body, which was\r\nwithout any other covering, nobly cut his way through the enemy sword\r\nin hand. He overtook Montrose at Peebles, and delivered the standard\r\ninto his hands the same night. Montrose rewarded him for his bravery\r\nby appointing him one of his life-guard, and by committing the\r\nstandard to his future charge. The other was preserved and delivered\r\nto Montrose by the Honourable William Hay, brother to the Earl of\r\nKinnoul, a youth of a martial and enterprising spirit.\r\n\r\nMontrose passed the night at Peebles, where he was joined by most\r\nof his horse and part of his infantry; but some of his officers\r\nwho had mistaken their way, or fled in a different direction, were\r\nseized by the country people and delivered over to Leslie. Among\r\nthese were the Earl of Hartfell, Lords Drummond and Ogilvie, Sir\r\nRobert Spottiswood, Sir Alexander Leslie of Auchintoul, Sir William\r\nRollock, Sir Philip Nisbet, the Honourable William Murray, brother\r\nto the Earl of Tulliebardine, Alexander Ogilvie of Inverquharity,\r\nColonel Nathaniel Gordon, and Mr. Andrew Guthry, son of the bishop of\r\nMurray.[332] Montrose left Peebles early the following morning, and,\r\ncrossing the Clyde at a ford shown him by Sir John Dalziel, where he\r\nwas, to his great joy, joined by the Earls of Crawford and Airly, and\r\nother noblemen who had effected their escape by a different route, he\r\nproceeded rapidly to the north, and entered Athole, after dispatching\r\nthe Marquis of Douglas and the Earl of Airly into Angus, and Lord\r\nErskine into Mar, to raise forces. Montrose then sent letters to Sir\r\nAlexander Macdonald and the Earl of Aboyne, requesting them to join\r\nhim without delay, and to bring with them all the forces they could\r\nmuster, to enable him to enter on a new campaign.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the members of the Committee of Estates, who had taken\r\nrefuge in Berwick, heard of Montrose’s defeat at Philiphaugh, they\r\njoined Leslie’s army, which they accompanied to Edinburgh, and there\r\nconcocted those measures of revenge against the unhappy royalists\r\nwho had fallen into their hands, which they afterwards carried\r\ninto execution. The first who suffered were Colonel O’Kean, to\r\nwhose distinguished bravery at the battle of Fyvie we have already\r\nalluded, and Major Lauchlan, another brave officer. Both these were\r\nhanged, without trial, upon the Castle-hill at Edinburgh. Perhaps the\r\ncircumstance of being Irishmen appeared a sufficient reason in the\r\neyes of their enemies for dispatching them so summarily; but they\r\nwere, nevertheless, the subjects of the king, and as fully entitled\r\nto all the privileges of war as the other prisoners. This hatred of\r\nthe Irish by the Covenanters was not confined to the cases of these\r\nindividuals. Having in their march westward to Glasgow fallen in,\r\nnear Linlithgow, with a body of helpless Irish women and children,\r\nwho, in consequence of the loss of their husbands and fathers at\r\nthe battle of Philiphaugh, were now seeking their way home to their\r\nown country, they were all seized by orders of the heads of the\r\nCovenanters, and thrown headlong by the brutal soldiers over the\r\nbridge of Avon into the river below. Some of these unfortunate\r\nbeings, who had sufficient strength left to reach the banks of the\r\nriver, were not allowed to save themselves from drowning, but after\r\nbeing beaten on the head and stunned by blows from the butt ends of\r\nmuskets and by clubs, were pushed back into the stream, where they\r\nall perished.[333] According to Gordon of Ruthven, many of the women\r\nwho were with child were ripped up and cut to pieces, “with such\r\nsavage and inhuman cruelty, as neither Turk nor Scythian was ever\r\nheard to have done the like.”[334]\r\n\r\nThe covenanting army continued its march to Glasgow, where a\r\nconvention of the Estates was held, to determine upon farther\r\nmeasures. To testify their gratitude to Leslie, they granted him a\r\npresent of 50,000 merks and a gold chain, and they also voted the sum\r\nof 25,000 merks to Middleton, the second in command.[335]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[282] Guthry, p. 141.\r\n\r\n[283] Idem.\r\n\r\n[284] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 447.\r\n\r\n[285] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 522.\r\n\r\n[286] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 301.\r\n\r\n[287] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 452.\r\n\r\n[288] Vol. ii. p. 457.\r\n\r\n[289] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 462.\r\n\r\n[290] _Montrose Redivivus_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[291] _Montrose Redivivus_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[292] Wishart, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[293] Wishart, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[294] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 525.\r\n\r\n[295] Idem.\r\n\r\n[296] Spalding.\r\n\r\n[297] Wishart.\r\n\r\n[298] _Montrose Redivivus_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[299] Spalding, vol. ii., p. 473. _Britane’s Distemper_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[300] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 525.\r\n\r\n[301] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 474.\r\n\r\n[302] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 476.\r\n\r\n[303] Spalding, vol. ii. p. 479.\r\n\r\n[304] Wishart, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[305] _Britane’s Distemper_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[306] Wishart, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[307] Wishart, p. 149.\r\n\r\n[308] This incident is extremely doubtful; it appears to be mentioned\r\nonly in the _Red Book of Clanranald_, while no mention is made of it\r\nin Gordon of Sallagh, Wishart, or Gordon of Ruthven.\r\n\r\n[309] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 526.\r\n\r\n[310] Idem.\r\n\r\n[311] _Memoirs_, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[312] Guthrie’s _Memoirs_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[313] _Memoirs_, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[314] Wishart’s _Memoirs_, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[315] Guthry’s _Memoirs_, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[316] Wishart, p. 156.\r\n\r\n[317] Guthry, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[318] Idem.\r\n\r\n[319] General Baillie’s _Narrative_, Baillie’s _Letters_, vol. ii.\r\npp. 270, 271.\r\n\r\n[320] Carte, vol. iv. p. 538.

Many of them were engaged\r\nin the occupation of the harvest, securing, for the support of\r\nthemselves and their families, the scanty and precarious crops\r\nwhich were then upon the ground, and which, if neglected to be cut\r\ndown in due time, might be destroyed by unfavourable weather. It\r\nwas, besides, little more than a month since they had left him at\r\nBothwell, for the purpose partly of repairing the damages which had\r\nbeen committed by Argyle’s men upon their houses, and the interval\r\nwhich had since elapsed had not been sufficient for accomplishing\r\ntheir object. Yet, notwithstanding these drawbacks, Montrose\r\nsucceeded in inducing about 400 of the men of Athole to join him\r\nimmediately, and to follow him to the north in quest of additional\r\nreinforcements; and he obtained a promise that, on his return, the\r\nwhole of the Athole Highlanders would join him in a body.\r\n\r\nWhile in Athole, Montrose received promises both from Lord Aboyne\r\nand Sir Alexander Macdonald, that they would speedily join him with\r\nconsiderable reinforcements; but, growing impatient at Aboyne’s\r\ndelay, he resolved to proceed north himself to ascertain in person\r\nthe cause of it, and to urge that nobleman to fulfil his promise.\r\nCrossing, therefore, the Grampians, he marched with great haste\r\nthrough Aberdeenshire, and had an interview with Lord Aboyne, whom he\r\nexpected to rouse from his apathy. Montrose, however, soon perceived,\r\nthat whatever Lord Aboyne’s own intentions were, he was thwarted by\r\nhis father, the Marquis of Huntly, who, on hearing of Montrose’s\r\nsuccess at Kilsyth, had left his retreat in Strathnaver, where he\r\nhad passed a year and a half in absolute supineness, and returned to\r\nhis own country. The marquis appears to have been filled with envy\r\ntowards Montrose, and although, being a royalist in his heart, he\r\ndid not care to expose the crown and monarchy to danger to gratify\r\nhis spleen and vanity, yet he could not endure to see a man whom he\r\nlooked upon as his inferior in rank, monopolize the whole power and\r\nauthority in Scotland.\r\n\r\n“He was,” says Bishop Wishart, “a man equally unfortunate and\r\ninconsiderate; and, however much he would seem, or was really\r\nattached to the king, yet he often betrayed that interest through\r\na pride and unaccountable envy he had conceived against Montrose,\r\nwhose glory and renown he endeavoured rather to extenuate than make\r\nthe object of his emulation. He durst not venture to depreciate\r\nMontrose’s actions before his own people, who had been eye-witnesses\r\nof them, and were well acquainted with his abilities, lest it might\r\nbe construed into a sign of disaffection to the king himself.\r\nHowever, he gave out that he would take the charge of commanding them\r\nhimself during the remainder of the war; and in that view he headed\r\nall his own vassals, and advised his neighbours, not without threats\r\nif they acted otherwise, to enlist under no other authority than his\r\nown. They remonstrated against being asked to disobey the commands\r\nof Montrose, who was appointed by the king his deputy-governor\r\nand captain-general of all the forces within the kingdom. Huntly\r\nreplied, that he himself should in no way be wanting in his duty to\r\nthe king; but, in the meantime, it tended no less to their honour\r\nthan his own that it should appear to the king and the whole kingdom\r\nhow much they contributed to the maintenance of the war; and this,\r\nhe said, could never be done, unless they composed a separate army\r\nby themselves. He spoke in very magnificent terms of his own power,\r\nand endeavoured as much as possible to extenuate that of Montrose. He\r\nextolled immoderately the glory and achievements of his ancestors,\r\nthe Gordons; a race, worthy indeed of all due commendation, whose\r\npower had for many ages been formidable, and an overmatch for their\r\nneighbours; and was so even at this day. It was therefore, he said,\r\nextremely unjust to ascribe unto another, meaning Montrose, the glory\r\nand renown acquired by their courage, and at the expense of their\r\nblood. But, for the future, he would take care that neither the king\r\nshould be disappointed of the help of the Gordons, nor should they be\r\nrobbed of the praise due to their merit.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Huntly’s reasoning, some of his clan perceived the\r\ngreat danger to which the king’s affairs would be exposed by such\r\nconduct, and they did everything in their power to induce him to\r\nalter his resolution. It was, however, in vain that they represented\r\nto him the danger and impropriety of dividing the friends of the\r\nking at such a crisis, when union and harmony were so essentially\r\nnecessary for accomplishing the objects they had in view, and\r\nwhen, by allowing petty jealousies to interfere and distract their\r\ncouncils, they might ruin the royal cause in Scotland. Huntly lent a\r\ndeaf ear to all their entreaties, and instead of adopting the advice\r\nof his friends to support Montrose, by ordering his vassals to join\r\nhim, he opposed him almost in everything he proposed by underhand\r\nmeans, although affecting a seeming compliance with his wishes.\r\nSeeing all their efforts fruitless, those friends who had advised\r\nHuntly to join Montrose declared that they would range themselves\r\nunder Montrose’s banner, as the king’s lieutenant, regardless of\r\nconsequences, and they kept their word.\r\n\r\nThe author of the history of the family of Gordon, and Gordon of\r\nRuthven, author of _Britane’s Distemper_, endeavour to defend Huntly\r\nfrom these charges made against him by Wishart. They assert that\r\nWishart has given only one side of the case, and that Huntly acted\r\nas he did from a genuine desire to serve the highest interests of\r\nthe king, and through no envy towards Montrose. They lament that\r\nany misunderstanding should ever have arisen between these two\r\neminent royalists, as it undoubtedly tended materially to prejudice\r\nthe cause of the king. No doubt Huntly sincerely wished to serve\r\nthe royal cause: but we are afraid that jealousy towards Montrose\r\nhelped considerably to obscure his mental vision and prejudice his\r\njudgment.[336]\r\n\r\nAmong other reasons which induced Montrose to take the speedy step\r\nhe did of marching north himself, was a report which had reached\r\nhim that the king was to send from England a large body of horse to\r\nsupport him, and he was most anxious to collect such forces as he\r\ncould to enable him to be in a condition to advance to the south,\r\nand unite with this body. In fact, the king had given orders to Lord\r\nDigby and Sir Marmaduke Langdale to proceed to Scotland with a body\r\nof 1,500 horse; but they were, unfortunately, completely defeated,\r\neven before Montrose’s departure to the north, by Colonel Copley at\r\nSherburn, with the loss of all their baggage. Digby and Langdale,\r\naccompanied by the Earls of Carnwath and Nithsdale, fled to Skipton,\r\nand afterwards to Dumfries, whence they took ship to the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the evasions of the Marquis of Huntly, Montrose\r\nsucceeded in inducing the Earl of Aboyne to join him at Drumminor,\r\nthe seat of Lord Forbes, with a force of 1,500 foot and 300 horse,\r\nall of whom appeared to be actuated by the best spirit. To remove\r\nevery unfavourable impression from the mind of Montrose, Aboyne\r\nassured him with great frankness, that he and his men were ready to\r\nfollow him wherever he should be pleased to lead them; that they\r\nwould obey his orders; and that his brother, Lord Lewis, would also\r\nspeedily join him, as he soon did, with an additional force.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this reinforcement, Montrose turned his face to the\r\nsouth, and marched towards Mar, where he was to be joined by forces\r\nwhich Lord Erskine had raised there; but he had not proceeded far,\r\nwhen Lord Lewis Gordon, under some pretence or other, returned home\r\nwith a considerable party of horse, promising to return to the army\r\nthe following day. The desertion of Lord Lewis had a most pernicious\r\ninfluence upon the remainder of Aboyne’s men, who, before the army\r\nhad reached Alford, were greatly diminished by desertion. As the\r\nremainder showed great unwillingness to march forward, and as the\r\ndesertions continued, Aboyne requested leave of absence, alleging as\r\nhis reason, that his father had expressly commanded him to return\r\nto defend his possessions against a party of the enemy who were in\r\nLower Mar, and who were threatening an attack. The demand of Aboyne\r\nexcited the astonishment of Montrose, who remonstrated with him, and\r\ngave many reasons to induce him to remain. He showed that Aboyne’s\r\napprehensions of danger were groundless, as, with the exception\r\nof a few troops of the enemy’s horse quartered in Aberdeen, there\r\nwere no other forces in the north which could disturb his father’s\r\npossessions, and that these horse were too weak to attempt any\r\nthing--that by marching south, the seat of war would be transferred\r\nfrom the north country, and that, in this way, the Marquis of Huntly\r\nwould be relieved altogether of the presence of the enemy--that it\r\nwould be impossible to join the royalist forces, which were on their\r\nway from England, without crossing the Forth, and that it was only by\r\nadopting the latter step that they could ever expect to rescue their\r\nbrave friends from the fangs of the Covenanters, and save their lives.\r\n\r\nAboyne did not attempt to answer these reasons, which were urged\r\nwith Montrose’s peculiar energy, but he requested him to send some\r\npersons who had influence with his father to acquaint him with them.\r\nDonald, Lord Reay, at whose house Huntly had lived during his exile\r\nin Strathnaver, and Alexander Irvine, younger of Drum, Huntly’s\r\nson-in-law, both of whom had been indebted to Montrose for their\r\nliberty, were accordingly sent by him to the Marquis of Huntly,\r\nas the most likely persons he could select to induce Huntly to\r\nallow Aboyne to remain with the army. But all their arguments and\r\nentreaties were to no purpose. Lord Reay was so heartily ashamed\r\nat the failure of his mission, that he declined to return to\r\nMontrose; and Irvine, who brought some evasive letters from Huntly,\r\nfrankly declared to Montrose, that he could obtain no satisfactory\r\nexplanation from his father-in-law of his real intentions, farther,\r\nthan that he remained fixed in his resolution that Aboyne should\r\nreturn home immediately. After declaring that he parted from Montrose\r\nwith reluctance, and promising to join him within a fortnight with a\r\nforce even larger than that which he had lately brought, Aboyne left\r\nthe army and returned to his father.\r\n\r\nMontrose then continued his march through Braemar and Glenshee into\r\nAthole, where he obtained an accession of force. He next proceeded\r\nto Strathearn, where he was met by two messengers,--Captain Thomas\r\nOgilvie, younger of Pourie, and Captain Robert Nisbet,--who arrived\r\nby different routes, with orders from the king, desiring Montrose to\r\njoin Lord George Digby, near the English border, as soon as possible.\r\nOn receiving these commands, Montrose immediately sent the messengers\r\nnorth to the Marquis of Huntly, to acquaint him with the king’s\r\nwishes, in the expectation that the use of his majesty’s name would\r\nat once induce him to send Aboyne south with reinforcements.\r\n\r\nWhile Montrose lay in Strathearn waiting for reinforcements,\r\nintelligence was brought to him that the Covenanters were about\r\nto imbrue their hands in the blood of his friends who had been\r\ntaken prisoners after the battle of Philiphaugh. The committee of\r\nEstates, which had accompanied the covenanting army to Glasgow, had\r\nnow determined upon this bold and illegal step, for which hitherto,\r\nwith the recent exceptions of O’Kean and Laughlane, no example had\r\nbeen set by either of the belligerent parties in Scotland since the\r\ncommencement of the war. They had wisely abstained from staining\r\nthe scaffolds with blood, but from different motives. Montrose, in\r\ngeneral, refrained from inflicting capital punishment, and, as we\r\nhave seen, often released his prisoners on parole. The heads of the\r\nCovenanters had been deterred by fear alone from carrying their\r\nbloody purposes into execution; but considering that they had now\r\nnothing to fear, they soon appeared in their true colours.\r\n\r\nBesides the committee of the Estates, a committee of the kirk held\r\nsittings in Glasgow at the same time, which sittings were afterwards\r\ntransferred to Perth, where, after deposing some ministers who\r\nwere considered disaffected to the Covenant, because they had not\r\n“mourned” for Montrose’s victory at Kilsyth, they “concerned”\r\nthemselves, as Guthry observes, about “the disposition of men’s\r\nheads.” Accordingly, thinking the committee of Estates remiss in\r\ncondemning and executing the prisoners, they appointed Mr. William\r\nBennet, who acted as Moderator in the absence of Mr. Robert Douglas,\r\nand two others of their number, to wait upon the committee of\r\nEstates, and remonstrate with them for their supineness. Guthry\r\nrelates, that the deputation reported on their return, in his own\r\nhearing, that some of the lords of the committee slighted the desire\r\nof the committee of the kirk, and that they were likely to have\r\nobtained nothing had not the Earl of Tulliebardine made a seasonable\r\nspeech to the effect, “that because he had a brother among those\r\nmen, it might be that their lordships so valued his concurrence\r\nwith them in the good cause, that for respect of him they were the\r\nmore loth to resolve upon the question. But that, as for himself,\r\nsince that young man had joined with that wicked crew, he did not\r\nesteem him his brother, and therefore declared that he would take\r\nit for no favour if upon that account any indulgence was granted\r\nhim.”[337],[338] This fratricidal speech made those members of the\r\ncommittee, who had disliked the shedding of blood, hang down their\r\nheads, according to Bennet’s report, and the committee, thereupon,\r\nresolved that 10 of the prisoners should be executed, viz., the Earl\r\nof Hartfell, Lord Ogilvie, Sir Robert Spottiswood, the Honourable\r\nWilliam Murray, brother to the Earl of Tulliebardine, Alexander\r\nOgilvie of Inverquharity, Sir William Rollock, Sir Philip Nisbet,\r\nColonel Nathaniel Gordon, Adjutant Stewart, and Captain Andrew Guthry.\r\n\r\nApprehensive, however, that Montrose might still be in a condition\r\nto avenge the blood of his friends, the committee did not venture\r\nto carry their sentence into immediate execution upon any of them;\r\nbut hearing of the division between Montrose and Huntly, and the\r\ndesertion of the Gordons, they thought they might now safely venture\r\nto immolate a few victims at the shrine of the Covenant. Accordingly\r\nthree of the prisoners were ordered for execution, viz., Sir William\r\nRollock, Sir Philip Nisbet, chief of that name, and Alexander\r\nOgilvie, younger of Inverquharity, a youth not quite 18 years of age,\r\nwho had already given proofs of ability. This excellent young man\r\nwas sacrificed to gratify the malignant animosity of Argyle at the\r\nOgilvies. Sir William was executed at the market cross of Glasgow,\r\non the 28th of October, and Sir Philip and Ogilvie suffered at the\r\nsame place on the following day. Wishart relates a circumstance\r\nconnected with Sir William Rollock’s condemnation, which exhibits a\r\nsingular instance of the ferocity and fanaticism of the times. He\r\nsays, that the chief crime laid to Sir William’s charge was, that\r\nhe had not perpetrated a deed of the most villanous and atrocious\r\nnature. Having been sent by Montrose, after the battle of Aberdeen,\r\nwith some despatches to the king, he was apprehended by the enemy,\r\nand would undoubtedly have been immediately executed, but for Argyle,\r\nwho used all his endeavours to engage him to assassinate Montrose,\r\nand who at length, by threatening him with immediate death, and\r\npromising him, in case of compliance, very high rewards, prevailed\r\non him to undertake that barbarous office, for which, however, he\r\nsecretly entertained the utmost abhorrence. Having thereby obtained\r\nhis life and liberty, he returned straight to Montrose and disclosed\r\nthe whole matter to him, entreating him, at the same time, to look\r\nmore carefully to his own safety; as it could not be supposed that\r\nhe, Sir William, was the only person who had been practised upon in\r\nthis shameful manner or that others would equally detest the deed,\r\nbut that some persons would undoubtedly be found who, allured with\r\nthe bait, would use their utmost industry and pains to obtain the\r\npromised reward.[339] Another instance of fanaticism is related by\r\nGuthry, of David Dickson the “bloody preacher,” who, on witnessing\r\nthe execution of Nisbet and Ogilvie, was heard to utter the barbarous\r\nexpression--“The work goes bonnyly on,” an expression which\r\nafterwards became proverbial.\r\n\r\nAbout the time this tragedy was performing, Montrose crossed the\r\nForth and entered Lennox with a force of 300 horse and 1,200 foot,\r\nand took up his quarters on the lands of Sir John Buchanan, an\r\nardent Covenanter, whence he sent out his cavalry every day, who\r\nhovered about Glasgow, and plundered the neighbouring country without\r\nopposition, although the Covenanters had a force of about 3,000\r\ncavalry in Glasgow and the neighbourhood. When Montrose heard of the\r\nexecution of his friends, his heart was filled with the most poignant\r\ngrief, and he longed for a suitable opportunity to avenge their\r\ndeaths, but he was too weak to venture upon an immediate attack.\r\nHe sent repeated messengers from his present head-quarters to Sir\r\nAlexander Macdonald to join him; but after hovering several weeks\r\nabout Glasgow, like a hawk ready to pounce upon its quarry, he had\r\nthe mortification to find, that Macdonald had no intention of ever\r\nagain returning to him, and that his expectations of being joined by\r\nthe Earl of Aboyne were to be equally disappointed.\r\n\r\nUnder these untoward circumstances, therefore, and as the winter,\r\nwhich turned out unusually severe, was far advanced, Montrose\r\nresolved to retire into the north where he could remain undisturbed.\r\nWith this view he began his march from the Lennox on the 19th of\r\nNovember, and crossing the hills of Monteith, which were covered with\r\nsnow to a considerable depth, he entered Strathearn, and crossing\r\nthe Tay, marched into Athole. Here Montrose received the melancholy\r\nnews of the death of his brother-in-law, Archibald Lord Napier of\r\nMerchiston, whom he had left behind him in Athole on account of\r\nindisposition; a man, says Bishop Wishart, “not less noble in his\r\npersonal accomplishments than in his birth and descent; a man of\r\nthe greatest uprightness and integrity, and of a most happy genius,\r\nbeing, as to his skill in the sciences, equal to his father and\r\ngrandfather, who were famous all the world over for their knowledge\r\nin philosophy and mathematics, and in the doctrine of civil prudence\r\nfar beyond them.” Montrose had been accustomed from his earliest\r\nyears to look up to this gifted nobleman with feelings of reverential\r\nand filial awe, nor were these feelings impaired as he advanced in\r\nlife. He was interred in the Kirk of Blair with becoming solemnity by\r\nMontrose.\r\n\r\nWhen Montrose arrived in Athole, he there found Captain Ogilvie and\r\nCaptain Nisbet, who had just returned from the north to give an\r\naccount of their embassy to the Marquis of Huntly. They reported that\r\nthey found him quite inflexible in his determination not to send\r\nassistance to Montrose, that he had spoken disdainfully to them, and\r\neven questioned the authenticity of the message which they brought\r\nfrom the king. It was truly grievous for Montrose to see the cause\r\nfor which he had fought so long, and for which he had encountered\r\nso many personal risks, thus endangered by the apparently wilful\r\nand fatal obstinacy of an individual who had abandoned his country\r\nand his friends in the most trying circumstances, and skulked in\r\nStrathnaver, without showing any inclination to support the tottering\r\nthrone of his sovereign. But Montrose did not yet despair of bringing\r\nthe marquis to a due sense of his duty; and as he considered that\r\nit was more expedient, in the present conjuncture, to endeavour to\r\nsoothe the wounded pride of the marquis than to use the language of\r\nmenace, he sent Sir John Dalziel to Huntly with a message of peace\r\nand reconciliation; intending, if necessary, as soon as circumstances\r\npermitted, to follow him, and enforce by his personal presence, at\r\na friendly conference, which Sir John was requested to ask from the\r\nmarquis, the absolute necessity of such a reconciliation.\r\n\r\nAs Dalziel was quite unsuccessful in his mission, and could not\r\nprevail upon Huntly to agree to a conference with Montrose, the\r\nlatter hastened to put into effect his intention of paying a personal\r\nvisit to Huntly, “that nothing might be unattempted to bring him to\r\na right way of thinking,” and “by heaping favours and benefits upon\r\nhim, force him even against his will, to a reconciliation, and to\r\nco-operate with him in promoting the king’s affairs.”[340] Montrose\r\naccordingly left Athole with his army in the month of December,\r\nand marching into Angus, crossed the Grampians, then covered with\r\nfrost and snow, by rapid marches, and arrived in Strathbogie,\r\nbefore Huntly was aware of his movements. To avoid Montrose, Huntly\r\nimmediately shut himself up in his castle of Bog of Gicht, on the\r\nSpey, but Montrose having left his head-quarters with a troop of\r\nhorse, unexpectedly surprised him very early in the morning before\r\nhe had time to secrete himself. Instead of reproaching Huntly with\r\nhis past conduct, Montrose spoke to him in the most affable manner,\r\nand apparently succeeded in removing his dissatisfaction so far,\r\nthat a plan for conducting the future operations of the army was\r\nagreed upon between them. The reduction of the garrison of Inverness,\r\nwhich, though strong and well fortified, was but scantily stored\r\nwith provisions, and an attempt to induce the Earl of Seaforth to\r\njoin them, were the leading parts of this plan. Accordingly, while\r\nMontrose was to march through Strathspey, on his way to Inverness,\r\nit was agreed that Huntly should also advance upon it by a different\r\nroad along the sea-coast of Morayshire, and thereby hem in the\r\ngarrison on both sides.\r\n\r\nIn prosecution of this design, Montrose proceeded through Strathspey,\r\nand sat down before Inverness, waiting for the arrival of Huntly.\r\nWhen marching through Strathspey, Montrose received intelligence\r\nthat Athole was threatened with a visit from the Campbells--a\r\ncircumstance which induced him to despatch Graham of Inchbrakie and\r\nJohn Drummond, younger of Balloch, to that country, for the purpose\r\nof embodying the Athole Highlanders, who had remained at home, in\r\ndefence of their country. The inhabitants of Argyle, on hearing of\r\nSir Alexander Macdonald’s arrival in their country, after the battle\r\nof Kilsyth, had fled to avoid his vengeance, and concealed themselves\r\nin caverns or in the clefts of the rocks; but being compelled by the\r\ncalls of hunger to abandon their retreats, they had been collected\r\ntogether by Campbell of Ardkinlass to the number of about 1,200,\r\nand had attacked the Macgregors and Macnabs for favouring Montrose.\r\nBeing joined by the Stuarts of Balquidder, the Menzieses, and other\r\npartisans of Argyle, to the number of about 300, they meditated an\r\ninvasion of Athole, and had advanced as far as Strathample, with the\r\nintention of carrying their design into execution, when intelligence\r\nwas brought to Inchbrakie of their approach. Inchbrakie and Balloch\r\nhad by this time collected a body of 700 able-bodied men, and, with\r\nthis force, they immediately proceeded to meet the Campbells. These\r\nhad laid siege to Castle Ample; but, on being apprised of the advance\r\nof the Athole-men, they retired to Monteith, whither they were hotly\r\npursued by the Athole-men, who overtook them at Callander, near the\r\nvillage of Monteith. After crossing the river Teith, they halted and\r\nprepared for battle, having previously stationed a large party of\r\nmusketeers to guard the ford.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the strength and position of the Campbells,\r\nInchbrakie ordered 100 of his men to advance to the ford, as if\r\nwith the intention of crossing it, in order to draw the attention\r\nof the Campbells to this single point, while, with the remainder\r\nof his men, he hastened to cross the river by another ford, higher\r\nup, and nearer the village. This movement was immediately perceived\r\nby the Argyle-men, who, alarmed at such a bold step, and probably\r\nthinking that the Athole-men were more numerous than they really\r\nwere, abandoned their position, and fled with precipitation towards\r\nStirling. As soon as the Athole party, stationed at the lower ford,\r\nsaw the opposite bank deserted, they immediately crossed the river\r\nand attacked the rear of the retiring Campbells. They were soon\r\njoined in the pursuit by the party which had crossed the higher ford;\r\nbut, as the Athole-men had performed a tedious march of ten miles\r\nthat morning, they were unable to continue the pursuit far. About\r\n80 of the Campbells were killed in the pursuit. They loitered about\r\nStirling for some time in a very pitiful state, till visited by\r\ntheir chief, on his way to Ireland, who, not knowing how to dispose\r\nof them, led them into Renfrewshire, under the impression that as\r\nthe inhabitants of that district were friendly to the Covenant, they\r\nwould be well received; but the people of Renfrewshire, instead of\r\nshowing sympathy for these unfortunate wanderers, threatened to\r\ntake arms and cut them down, unless they departed immediately. The\r\nmarquis, thereupon, sent them into Lennox, and quartered them upon\r\nthe lands of Lord Napier and other “malignants,” as the royalists\r\nwere called.[341]\r\n\r\nThe support of General Leslie’s army being heavily felt by the\r\npeople, complaints were made to the Committee of Estates for\r\nretaining such a large body of men in Scotland, without any\r\nnecessity, and whose habits and mode of living were so different\r\nfrom those of the inhabitants of North Britain. The Committee sent\r\nLeslie back to England, retaining only a small brigade under General\r\nMiddleton, to watch the motions of Montrose.\r\n\r\nThe Covenanters, emboldened by recent events, had summoned a\r\nparliament to meet at St. Andrews, which accordingly assembled on\r\nthe 26th of November, 1645; and, that the ministers might not be\r\nbehind their lay brethren in zeal for the blood of the “malignants,”\r\nthe general assembly of the church also met at the same time and\r\nplace. It is truly humiliating to find men, no doubt sincerely\r\nbelieving they were serving the cause of religion, demanding the\r\nlives of their countrymen as a sacrifice which they considered would\r\nbe well-pleasing to God; yet, whilst every unprejudiced mind must\r\ncondemn the fanaticism of the Covenanters, it must be remembered\r\nthat the unconstitutional attempts of the king to force Episcopacy\r\nupon them--a system which they detested,--the severe losses which\r\nthey had sustained from the arms of Montrose, and the dread of being\r\nsubjected to the yoke of prelacy, and punished for their resistance,\r\nhad aroused them to a state of frenzy, over which reason and religion\r\ncould have little control.\r\n\r\nAs a preparative for the bloody scenes about to be enacted, Sir\r\nArchibald Johnston of Warriston, on the day the parliament met,\r\naddressed the house in a long harangue, in which he entreated them\r\nto “unity amongst themselves, to lay all private respects and\r\ninterests aside, and to do justice on delinquents and malignants;\r\nshowing that their dallying formerly had provoked God’s two great\r\nservants against them--the sword and plague of pestilence--which had\r\nploughed up the land with deep furrows: he showed that the massacre\r\nof Kilsyth was never to be forgotten, and that God, who was the just\r\nJudge of the world, would not but judge righteously, and keep in\r\nremembrance that sea of innocent blood which lay before his throne,\r\ncrying for vengeance on these bloodthirsty rebels, the butchers of\r\nso many innocent souls. He showed, likewise, that the times required\r\na more narrow and sharp looking into than formerly, in respect that\r\nthe house of parliament was become at this present like to Noah’s\r\nark, which had in it both foul and clean creatures, and therefore he\r\nbesought the Estates there now convened by God’s especial permission\r\nand appointment, before that they went about the constitution of\r\nthat high court of parliament, that they would make a serious search\r\nand inquiry after such as were ears and eyes to the enemies of the\r\ncommonwealth, and did sit there as if there was nothing to say to\r\nthem; and, therefore, he humbly desired that the house might be\r\nadjourned till to-morrow at two o’clock in the afternoon, and that\r\nthe several Estates might consider what corrupted members were\r\namongst them, who had complied with the public enemy of the state,\r\neither by themselves or by their agents or friends.”[342]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, a petition was presented to the parliament\r\nfrom the prisoners confined in the castle of St. Andrews, praying to\r\nbe tried either by their peers, the justice-general, or before the\r\nwhole parliament, and not by a committee, as proposed; and they very\r\nproperly objected to Sir Archibald Johnston’s sitting as a judge, he\r\nhaving already prejudged their case; but the house, “in one voice,”\r\nmost iniquitously rejected the petition, reserving, however, to the\r\nprisoners still to object to Sir Archibald before the committee, “if\r\nthey had not any personal exception against his person.”[343]\r\n\r\nAs the ministers considered the parliament tardy in their proceedings\r\nagainst the royalists, the commissioners of the general assembly\r\npresented, on the 5th of December, a remonstrance, praying them\r\n“for justice upon delinquents and malignants who had shed the\r\nblood of their brethren,” and on the same day, four petitions and\r\nremonstrances to the same effect were presented to the parliament,\r\nfrom the provincial assemblies and from Fife, Dumfries, Merse,\r\nTeviotdale, and Galloway, by a body of about 200 persons. The\r\nparliament, says Balfour, by their president, answered, that they\r\nhad taken their “_modest_ petitions and _seasonable_ remonstrances\r\nvery kindly, and rendered them hearty thanks, and wished them to\r\nbe confident that, with all alacrity and diligence, they would\r\ngo about and proceed in answering the expectations of all their\r\nreasonable desires, as they might themselves perceive in their\r\nprocedure hitherto; and, withal, he entreated them, in the name of\r\nthe house, that they would be earnest with God to implore and beg his\r\nblessing to assist and encourage them to the performance of what they\r\ndemanded.”[344]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the entreaties of the ministers to proceed with the\r\ncondemnation of the prisoners, the parliament postponed proceedings\r\ntill the 17th of January, 1646; but, as a peace-offering, they\r\nordered, in the mean time, some Irish prisoners, composed partly\r\nof those who had been taken at Philiphaugh, and who had escaped\r\nassassination, and partly of stragglers who had been picked up after\r\nthat battle, and who were confined in various prisons throughout\r\nthe kingdom, especially in those of Selkirk, Jedburgh, Glasgow,\r\nDumbarton, and Perth, to be executed without trial, “conform to the\r\ntreaty betwixt both kingdoms.”[345] A more illegal act it is scarcely\r\npossible to conceive, but in these times even the forms of justice\r\nwere set aside.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Estates, when sitting in Glasgow, had condemned the\r\nEarl of Hartfell and Lord Ogilvie to death, along with Sir William\r\nRollock, Sir Philip Nisbet, and Alexander Ogilvie; but, for some\r\nreason or other, their execution was deferred. So that, with the\r\nexception of Adjutant Stuart, who escaped while under the charge of\r\nGeneral Middleton, there remained only four persons of any note for\r\ncondemnation, viz., Colonel Nathaniel Gordon, Sir Robert Spottiswood,\r\nthe Honourable William Murray, and Captain Guthry. It appears from\r\nthe parliamentary register of Sir James Balfour, that these four\r\nprisoners pleaded exemption from trial, or rather from condemnation,\r\non the ground of “quarters;” but after three hours’ debate, on the\r\n10th of January, the parliament overruled this defence; and the\r\ncommittee having, of course, found them all “guilty of high treason\r\nagainst the states of the kingdom,” they fixed the 16th of that month\r\nfor taking into consideration the punishment to be inflicted upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first case taken up on the appointed day, was that of Colonel\r\nNathaniel Gordon, who, after a debate of three hours’ duration, was\r\nsentenced to be beheaded at the cross of St. Andrews, on Tuesday, the\r\n20th of January, at twelve o’clock, noon, and his lands and goods\r\nwere declared forfeited to the public. The lord chancellor declined\r\nvoting. Similar sentences were pronounced upon the Honourable William\r\nMurray and Captain Guthry, by a majority of votes, a few of the\r\nmembers having voted that they should be imprisoned during life. Mr.\r\nMurray’s brother, the Earl of Tulliebardine, absented himself. These\r\nthree fell under an act passed the preceding year, declaring that all\r\npersons who, after having subscribed the Covenant, should withdraw\r\nfrom it, should be held as guilty of high treason. But the case of\r\nSir Robert Spottiswood, who had not subscribed the Covenant, not\r\nfalling within the scope of this _ex-post-facto_ law, the committee\r\nhad stated in a special report the grounds on which they found Sir\r\nRobert guilty of high treason, namely, 1st, that he had advised,\r\ndocketed, signed, carried, and delivered to Montrose the commission\r\nappointing him “lieutenant-governor and captain-general” of all his\r\nmajesty’s forces in Scotland; and 2dly, that he had been taken in\r\narms against the country at Philiphaugh. After a lengthened debate,\r\nthe parliament decided that both these charges were capital offences,\r\nand accordingly Sir Robert was condemned by a large majority to lose\r\nhis head.[346]\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of the parliament to have ordered the Earl\r\nof Hartfell and Lord Ogilvie to be executed along with the other\r\nprisoners; but on the evening of the 19th of January Lord Ogilvie\r\neffected his escape in the following way. Pretending sickness he\r\napplied for, and obtained, though with considerable difficulty,\r\nliberty to his mother, wife, and sister, to visit and attend him in\r\nprison. On entering his chamber the sentinels retired out of respect\r\nto the ladies; and, as soon as the door was shut, his lordship jumped\r\nout of bed, and attired himself in his sister’s clothes, who, on\r\nundressing, took the place of her brother in bed, and put on his\r\nnight-cap. After spending some time together to prevent suspicion,\r\nthe two other ladies and his lordship, after opening the door ajar so\r\nas to be seen by the guards, pretended to take a most affectionate\r\nand painful leave of the unfortunate bed-ridden prisoner, and drawing\r\nthe door after them, passed the sentinels without interruption. This\r\nhappened about eight o’clock in the evening; and as horses had been\r\nprepared for his lordship and two companions who were waiting to\r\nescort him, he immediately mounted, and was out of all danger before\r\nnext morning, when the deception was discovered. The escape of Lord\r\nOgilvie highly incensed Argyle, who hated the Ogilvies, and who, it\r\nis said, longed for the death of his lordship. He could not conceal\r\nthe chagrin he felt on the occasion, and even had the audacity to\r\npropose that the three ladies should be immediately punished; but the\r\nHamiltons and Lord Lindsay, who, on account of their relationship to\r\nLord Ogilvie, were suspected of being privy to his escape, protected\r\nthem from his vengeance. The escape of Lord Ogilvie was a fortunate\r\noccurrence for the Earl of Hartfell, for whose life it is alleged\r\nthe Hamiltons thirsted in their turn; and to disappoint whom Argyle\r\ninsisted that the earl’s life should be spared, a concession which he\r\nobtained.[347]\r\n\r\nOf the four prisoners, Colonel Nathaniel Gordon, “a man,” says\r\nWishart, “of excellent endowments both of body and mind,” was the\r\nfirst that suffered. He had been long under the ban of the church for\r\nadultery; but on signing a paper, declaratory of his repentance, he\r\nwas absolved from the sentence of excommunication. He died expressing\r\ngreat sorrow for the vices and follies of his youth; but vindicated\r\nhimself for the part he had taken in the troubles of his country,\r\nprofessed the most unshaken loyalty to his king, and declared that\r\nif there were any thing in the instrument he had signed which might\r\nbe construed as dishonourable to the king, or repugnant to his\r\nauthority, he completely disowned it.\r\n\r\nColonel Gordon was followed to the scaffold by Sir Robert\r\nSpottiswood, a man of spotless integrity, and one of the most\r\nprofound scholars of the age. He was the eldest son of Archbishop\r\nSpottiswood, and had, by his rare endowments and great merit, been\r\nnoticed with distinction by King James and his successor Charles.\r\nJames conferred on him the order of knighthood, and made him a privy\r\ncouncillor, and Charles promoted him to the high situation of lord\r\npresident of the court of session; and, upon the desertion of the\r\nEarl of Lanark to the Covenanters, the king appointed him principal\r\nsecretary of state for Scotland instead of that nobleman. This\r\nappointment drew down upon him the hatred of the leading Covenanters,\r\nbut still there were some among them who continued to respect him\r\non account of his worth and shining talents; and when the vote was\r\ntaken in parliament whether he should suffer, the Earls of Eglintoun,\r\nCassilis, Dunfermline, and Carnwath, voted that his life should be\r\nspared; and the lord chancellor and the Earl of Lanark, by leave\r\nof the house, declined voting. “Though many liked not his party,\r\nthey liked his person, which made him many friends even among the\r\nCovenanters, insomuch, that after his sentence was read, some of the\r\nnobility spoke in his behalf, and entreated the house to consider\r\nthe quality and parts of that excellent gentleman and most just\r\njudge, whom they had condemned, and begged earnestly his life might\r\nbe spared. But an eminent knowledge and esteem, which, in other\r\ncases, might be a motive to save a criminal, was here only the cause\r\nof taking an innocent man’s life--so dangerous is it, in a corrupt\r\nage, to be eminently constant and virtuous. The gentlemen who spoke\r\nwere told that the authority of the established government was not\r\nsecure while Sir Robert’s life was spared. Whereupon the noblemen\r\nwho presided at the meeting of the estates at Glasgow, and in the\r\nparliament at St. Andrews, openly declared, when they signed the\r\nrespective sentences, that they did sign as preses, and in obedience\r\nto the command of the estates, but not as to their particular\r\njudgment.”[348]\r\n\r\nAfter he had mounted the scaffold, still reeking with the blood of\r\nColonel Gordon, Sir Robert surveyed the terrific scene around him\r\nwith singular composure, which, added to his naturally grave and\r\ndignified appearance, filled the breasts of the spectators with a\r\nfeeling of compassion. Sir Robert had intended to have addressed\r\nthe people, and had prepared a written speech for the occasion;\r\nbut on turning round to address the spectators, he was prevented\r\nfrom proceeding by the provost of St. Andrews, formerly a servant\r\nof Sir Robert’s father, who had been instigated to impose silence\r\nupon him by Robert Blair, one of those ministers who, to the scandal\r\nof religion, had dishonoured their profession by calling out for\r\nthe blood of their countrymen. Blair’s motive in occasioning this\r\ninterruption is said to have arisen from a dread he entertained that\r\nSir Robert would expose the designs of the Covenanters, and impress\r\nthe bystanders with an unfavourable opinion of their proceedings.\r\nSir Robert bore the interruption with the most unruffled composure,\r\nand, as he saw no chance of succeeding, he threw the manuscript\r\nof his speech amongst the crowd, and applied himself to his\r\nprivate devotions. But here again he was annoyed by the officious\r\nimpertinence of Blair, who rudely asked him whether he (Blair)\r\nand the people should pray for the salvation of his soul? To this\r\nquestion Sir Robert answered, that he indeed desired the prayers of\r\nthe people; but knowing the bloodthirsty character of the man he\r\nwas addressing, who had come to tease him in his last moments, he\r\ntold him that he “would have no concern with his prayers, which he\r\nbelieved were impious, and an abomination unto God; adding, that of\r\nall the plagues with which the offended majesty of God had scourged\r\nthe nation, this was certainly by far the greatest, greater than even\r\nthe sword, fire, or pestilence; that for the sins of the people God\r\nhad sent a lying spirit into the mouths of the prophets.”[349] This\r\nanswer raised the fury of Blair, who assailed Sir Robert with the\r\nmost acrimonious imputations, and reviled the memory of his father\r\nby the most infamous charges; but Sir Robert was too deeply absorbed\r\nin meditation to regard such obloquy. Having finished his devotions,\r\nthis great and good man, after uttering these words, “Merciful Jesus!\r\ngather my soul unto thy saints and martyrs who have run before me in\r\nthis race,” laid his neck upon the fatal block, and in an instant his\r\nhead was severed from his body.\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Robert Spottiswood’s execution, Captain Guthry, son of the\r\nex-bishop of Moray, was next led to the scaffold. The fierce and\r\nunfeeling Blair, who had already officiously witnessed, with the\r\nmost morbid complacency, the successive executions of Colonel Gordon\r\nand Sir Robert, not satisfied with reviling the latter gentleman in\r\nhis last moments, and lacerating his feelings by heaping every sort\r\nof obloquy upon the memory of his father, vented the dregs of his\r\nimpotent rage upon the unfortunate victim now before him; but Guthry\r\nbore all this man’s reproaches with becoming dignity, and declared\r\nthat he considered it an honour to die in defence of the just cause\r\nof his sovereign. He met his death with the fortitude of a hero and\r\nthe firmness of a Christian.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of an application to the parliament by the Earl\r\nof Tulliebardine, the execution of his brother, William Murray,\r\nwas delayed till the 23d of January. The case of this unfortunate\r\nyoung man excited a strong feeling of regret among the Covenanters\r\nthemselves, and some writers have not scrupled to blame the earl as\r\nthe cause of his death, that he might succeed to his patrimony. Some\r\ncountenance is afforded to this conjecture from the circumstance\r\nthat the earl not only made no exertions to save his brother from\r\ncondemnation, but that he even absented himself from parliament\r\nthe day that his brother’s case came to be discussed, when, by his\r\npresence or his vote, he might have saved his brother’s life. Nor\r\nis this supposition, it is contended, in any shape weakened by the\r\nattempt he afterwards made to get off his brother; for he must have\r\nknown that the parliament had gone too far to retract, and could not,\r\nwithout laying itself open to the charge of the grossest partiality,\r\nreprieve Mr. Murray, and allow their sentence to be carried into\r\nexecution against the other prisoners. If true, however, that the\r\nearl delivered the speech imputed to him by Bennet, there can be no\r\ndoubt of his being a participator in the death of his brother, but,\r\nit would be hard to condemn him on such questionable authority. To\r\nwhatever cause it was owing, Mr. Murray was not, during his last\r\nmoments, subjected to the annoyances of Blair, nor was he prevented\r\nfrom delivering the following speech to the persons assembled\r\nto witness his execution. He spoke in a loud tone of voice as\r\nfollows: “I hope, my countrymen, you will reckon that the house of\r\nTulliebardine, and the whole family of Murray, have this day acquired\r\na new and no small addition of honour; that a young man, descended\r\nof that ancient race, has, though innocent, and in the flower of his\r\nage, with the greatest readiness and cheerfulness, delivered up his\r\nlife for his king, the father of his country, and the most munificent\r\npatron and benefactor of that family from which he is sprung. Let not\r\nmy honoured mother, my dearest sisters, my kindred or my friends,\r\nlament the shortness of my life, seeing that it is abundantly\r\nrecompensed by the honour of my death. Pray for my soul, and God be\r\nwith you.”[350]\r\n\r\nMany prisoners, but of less note, still remained to be disposed\r\nof; but the parliament, either averse to shed more blood, or from\r\nother considerations, took no steps against them. The committee\r\nof the kirk, however, being actuated by other motives, pressed\r\nthe parliament to dispose of some more of the “malignants;” but\r\nthe bloody zeal of these clerical enthusiasts was checked by the\r\nbetter sense of the parliament; and in order to get rid of their\r\nimportunities for blood, a suggestion was made to them by the leading\r\nmen in parliament to lay before them an “overture,” proposing some\r\nmore lenient mode of punishment. The “godly” brotherhood soon met,\r\nbut a considerable difference of opinion prevailing as to the nature\r\nof the punishment to be submitted to parliament in the proposed\r\noverture, the moderator asked David Dickson what he thought best\r\nto be done with the prisoners, who answered “in his homely way of\r\nspeaking, ‘shame them and herry (plunder) them.’” This proposal,\r\nbeing adopted, was made the subject of an overture, which was\r\naccordingly presented to parliament; and to meet the views of the\r\nministers, a remit was made to a large committee, which was appointed\r\nto meet at Linlithgow, on the 25th of February, to fix the amount of\r\nthe fines to be imposed upon the different delinquents.\r\n\r\nWhile the proceedings before detailed were going on at St. Andrews,\r\nMontrose was ineffectually endeavouring to reduce the garrison\r\nof Inverness, the acquisition of which would have been of some\r\nimportance to him. Had the Marquis of Huntly kept his promise, and\r\njoined Montrose, its capture might have been effected; but that\r\nnobleman never made his appearance, and as Inverness was thus left\r\nopen on the side which it was intended he should block up, the enemy\r\nwere enabled to supply themselves with provisions and warlike stores,\r\nof which they stood in great need. Huntly, however, afterwards\r\ncrossed the Spey, and entered Moray with a considerable force; but\r\ninstead of joining Montrose, who repeatedly sent for him, he wasted\r\nhis time in fruitless enterprises, besieging and taking a few castles\r\nof no importance.\r\n\r\nAs Huntly probably did not think that the capture of a few obscure\r\ncastles was sufficient to establish his pretensions as Montrose’s\r\nrival, he resolved to seize Aberdeen, and had advanced on his way\r\nas far as Kintore, where he was met by Ludovick Lindsay, Earl\r\nof Crawford, who had retired from the Mearns, where he had been\r\nstationed with Montrose’s horse, on hearing of the approach of the\r\nparliamentary army under the command of General Middleton towards\r\nAberdeen. This intelligence was quite sufficient to induce the\r\nmarquis to desist from his enterprise. Lindsay then marched into\r\nBuchan, and burnt the town of Fraserburgh. He, thereafter, went to\r\nBanff, but was compelled to retire hastily into Moray with some\r\nloss in February 1646, by a division of Middleton’s army under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel Montgomery and Major David Barclay.[351]\r\n\r\nAbout this time intelligence was brought to Montrose that General\r\nMiddleton had arrived at Aberdeen with a force of 600 horse and\r\n800 foot. He now renewed his entreaties to Huntly to join him\r\nimmediately, that they might either reduce Inverness or march jointly\r\nupon Aberdeen and attack Middleton; Huntly, however, refused to\r\naccede to Montrose’s request. This refusal exasperated Montrose to\r\nsuch a degree that he resolved to have recourse to force to compel\r\ncompliance, as he could no longer endure to see the authority of the\r\nsovereign, whose deputy he was, thus trampled upon and despised.\r\nAs he had already brought over to his side the Earl of Seaforth,\r\nwho had induced the heads of some of the principal clans to form\r\na confederation for obtaining a national peace, he was fully in a\r\ncondition to have reduced Huntly to obedience. Montrose having got\r\na new commission, sent a copy of it to Huntly, and, as governor and\r\ngeneral of the royal forces, charged him to come without delay, with\r\nhis whole force to Inverness, and there receive further orders.\r\nHuntly appears to have made preparations for complying with this\r\norder, but Middleton’s sudden advance on Inverness induced him to\r\nalter his purpose.[352]\r\n\r\nWishart relates rather an incredible story respecting an alleged\r\npiece of treachery on the part of Lord Lewis Gordon on this occasion.\r\nHe states that, as Montrose had no reliance on Huntly, and as he\r\nbegan now to think it high time to look more carefully to his own\r\nsafety, lest Huntly’s malice might at last carry him the length even\r\nto betray him, he sent three troops of horse to the fords of the Spey\r\nto watch the motions of the enemy, with orders, if they approached,\r\nto send him immediate intimation of their movements. This body, it is\r\nsaid, occupied the most convenient stations, and watched with very\r\ngreat diligence for some time, till Lord Lewis, who then kept the\r\ncastle of Rothes, having contrived his scheme of villany, assured\r\nthe officers who commanded the horse, that the enemy was very far\r\ndistant, and had no intention to pass the river; he, therefore,\r\nadvised them to cease watching, and having invited them to the castle\r\nwhere they were sumptuously entertained by him, plied with wine and\r\nspirits, and detained till such time as Lord Middleton had crossed\r\nthe Spey with a large army of horse and foot, and penetrated far\r\ninto Moray, he dismissed his guests with these jeering remarks--“Go,\r\nreturn to your general Montrose, who will now have better work than\r\nhe had at Selkirk.” Gordon of Ruthven, however, contradicts this very\r\nimprobable story, and attributes Middleton’s unmolested crossing of\r\nthe Spey to the negligence of the troops who guarded the passage;\r\nasserting that Lord Lewis knew nothing of it till Mortimer, one of\r\nthe captains in command of the troops, appeared at Rothes to tell\r\nhim that Middleton was on the other side of the Spey on his way to\r\nInverness. Moreover such a statement carries its own condemnation\r\nupon the face of it, for even supposing that Montrose’s officers had\r\nacted the stupid part imputed to them, they would certainly not have\r\nforgotten their duty so far as to order their men to abandon their\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of May, 1646, that General Middleton left\r\nAberdeen at the head of his army, on his way to Inverness. He left\r\nbehind him in Aberdeen a regiment of horse, and another of foot, for\r\nthe protection of the town, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMontgomery. Middleton made a rapid march, and arrived in the\r\nneighbourhood of Inverness on the 9th of May, driving before him the\r\nfew troops of horse which Montrose had stationed on the Spey to watch\r\nhis motions. On being warned of Middleton’s approach, Montrose drew\r\nhis troops together, and took up a position at some distance from the\r\ntown; but having ascertained that Middleton was strong in cavalry,\r\nhe hastily crossed the river Ness. Middleton, thereupon, despatched\r\ntwo regiments of cavalry after him, who attacked his rear, cut off\r\nsome of his men, and captured two pieces of cannon and part of his\r\nbaggage. Montrose continued his retreat by Beauly into Ross-shire,\r\nwhither he was pursued by Middleton, who, however, suffered some loss\r\nin the pursuit. As Montrose’s forces were far inferior, in point of\r\nnumbers, to those of Middleton, he avoided coming to an engagement,\r\nand as Seaforth’s men, who had joined Montrose at Inverness, under\r\ntheir chief, began to desert him in great numbers, and as he could\r\nnot depend on the population by which he was surrounded, Montrose\r\nturned to the right, and passing by Lochness, marched through\r\nStrathglass and Stratherrick to the banks of the Spey. Middleton did\r\nnot follow Montrose, but went and laid siege to the castle of the\r\nEarl of Seaforth in the canonry of Ross, which he took after a siege\r\nof four days. He behaved towards the Countess of Seaforth, who was\r\nwithin the castle, with great politeness, and restored it to her\r\nafter taking away the ammunition which it contained.\r\n\r\nThe absence of Middleton from Aberdeen afforded Huntly an opportunity\r\nof accomplishing the design which he formerly entertained, till\r\nprevented by the approach of Middleton from the south, of taking\r\nAberdeen, and accordingly he ordered his men to march from Deeside\r\nto Inverury, where he appointed a general rendezvous to be held on\r\nthe 10th of May. Colonel Montgomery being aware of his motions, beat\r\nup his quarters the same night at Kintore with a party of horse, and\r\nkilled some of his men. But Montgomery was repulsed by Lord Lewis\r\nGordon, with some loss, and forced to retire to Aberdeen. The marquis\r\nappeared at the gates of Aberdeen at 12 o’clock on the following\r\nday, with a force of 1,500 Highland foot and 600 horse, and stormed\r\nit in three different places. The garrison defended themselves with\r\ncourage, and twice repulsed the assailants, in which contest a\r\npart of the town was set on fire; but a fresh reinforcement having\r\nentered the town, under Lord Aboyne, the attack was renewed, and\r\nMontgomery and his horse were forced to retire down to the edge of\r\nthe river Dee, which they crossed by swimming. The covenanting foot,\r\nafter taking refuge in the tolbooth and in the houses of the Earl\r\nMarischal and Menzies of Pitfoddles, craved quarter and surrendered\r\nat discretion. Although, the city of Aberdeen had done nothing to\r\nincur Huntly’s displeasure, he allowed his Highlanders to pillage it.\r\nAbout twenty officers were taken prisoners, among whom were Colonels\r\nHurry, Barclay, and David Leighton; besides Sir William Forbes of\r\nCraigievar, and other country gentlemen, particularly of the name of\r\nForbes; but they were all released next day on their parole of honour\r\nnot to serve against the king in future. There were killed on the\r\nside of the Covenanters, Colonel William Forbes, Captain Lockhart,\r\nson of Sir James Lockhart of Lee, and three captains of foot, besides\r\na number of privates; but Huntly lost only about twenty men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Aberdeen in the 17th century.--From Slezer’s\r\n_Theatrum Scotiæ_ (1693).]\r\n\r\nAs Huntly’s force was considerably reduced by the return of the\r\nHighlanders, who had accompanied him, to their own houses, with\r\nthe booty which they had collected in Aberdeen, and, as he was\r\napprehensive of the immediate return of Middleton from the north,\r\nhe remained but a short time in Aberdeen. Marching up the north\r\nbank of the Dee, he encamped in Cromar; but the sudden appearance\r\nof Middleton, who, on hearing of Huntly’s advance on Aberdeen, had\r\nretraced his steps and re-crossed the Spey, made him retire into\r\nMar. Middleton, after pursuing him for a short distance, returned to\r\nAberdeen, which he found had suffered severely from Huntly’s visit.\r\n\r\nAfter an ineffectual attempt by Montrose to obtain an interview with\r\nHuntly at the bog of Gight, whither he had gone after Middleton’s\r\nreturn to Aberdeen, Montrose resolved to make a tour through the\r\nHighlands, in the hope that he would be able, by his personal\r\npresence, and by promising suitable rewards, to induce the clans\r\nto rise in defence of their sovereign; but with the determination,\r\nin case of refusal, to enforce obedience to his commands. This\r\nresolution was not taken by Montrose, without the concurrence of\r\nsome of his best friends, who promised to aid him by every means in\r\ntheir power, in carrying it into effect. In pursuance of his design,\r\nMontrose was just about setting out on his proposed journey, when,\r\non the last day of May, a messenger arrived with a letter from the\r\nking, requesting him to disband his forces, and to retire, himself,\r\nto France, where he would receive “further directions.” After the\r\ndisastrous battle of Naseby, which was fought on the 14th of June,\r\n1644, between the English royalists and the parliamentary forces,\r\nthe campaign in England, on the part of the king, “presented little\r\nmore than the last and feeble struggles of an expiring party.”[353]\r\nThe king had been enabled, in consequence of the recall of the\r\nhorse, which had reached Nottingham, on their way to Hereford,\r\nunder General David Leslie, after the battle of Kilsyth, to drive\r\nthe parliamentary infantry back from the siege of Hereford; but the\r\nsurrender of Bristol to the forces of the parliament, on the 10th\r\nof September, and the defeat of the royalists at Chester, on the\r\n23d of the same month, completed the ruin of the king’s affairs.\r\nHaving shut himself up in Oxford, for the last time, in November\r\nfollowing, Charles, after the discovery of the secret treaty with\r\nthe Catholics of Ireland, which had been entered into by the Earl of\r\nGlamorgan, endeavoured to negotiate with the English parliament in\r\nthe expectation that if he could gain either the presbyterians or\r\nindependents over to his side, by fair promises, he would be enabled\r\nto get the upper hand of both.[354] That negotiation, however, not\r\nsucceeding, another was set on foot, through the medium of Montrevil,\r\nthe French envoy, with the Scots army before Newark, the leaders\r\nof which offered an asylum to the king on certain conditions. At\r\nlength Charles, undetermined as to the course he should pursue, on\r\nhearing of the approach of the parliamentary army, under Fairfax,\r\nleft Oxford at midnight, on the 27th of April, 1646, in the disguise\r\nof a servant, accompanied by Mr. Ashburnham and Dr. Hudson, a\r\nclergyman, and, after traversing the neighbouring country, arrived\r\nat Southwell on the 5th of May, where he was introduced by Montrevil\r\nto the Earl of Leven, the commander of the Scots army, and the\r\nofficers of his staff. The arrival of the king seemed to surprise\r\nthe officers very much, although it is generally supposed that they\r\nhad been made previously aware of his intentions by Hudson, who\r\nhad preceded him, and they treated him with becoming respect, the\r\ncommander tendering his bare sword upon his knee;[355] but when\r\nCharles, who had retained Leven’s sword, indicated his intention to\r\ntake the command of the army, by giving orders to the guard, that\r\ncrafty veteran unhesitatingly thus addressed him:--“I am the older\r\nsoldier, Sire, your majesty had better leave that office to me.”[356]\r\nThe king was, in fact, now a prisoner. As soon as the intelligence\r\nreached the capital, that the king had retired to the Scots camp, the\r\ntwo parliamentary factions united in accusing the Scots of perfidy,\r\nand sent a body of 5,000 horse to watch their motions; but the Scots\r\nbeing desirous to avoid hostilities, raised their camp before\r\nNewark, and hastily retired to Newcastle, carrying the king along\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Newcastle, the king was waited upon by the Earls of\r\nLanark and Callander, and Lord Balmerino, who paid their respects\r\nto him. As Callander was understood to be favourably inclined to\r\nthe king, Lanark and Balmerino were desirous to get rid of him, and\r\naccordingly they prevailed upon his majesty to send Callander back\r\nto Edinburgh with a letter, which they had induced his majesty to\r\nwrite to the Committee of Estates, expressive of his desire to comply\r\nwith the wishes of the Scots parliament, and containing instructions\r\nto them to order Montrose, Huntly, and Sir Alexander Macdonald to\r\ndisband their forces. And it was also at the desire of these two\r\nnoblemen that the king wrote the letter to Montrose already referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nAfter Montrose had read this letter he was filled with deep amazement\r\nand concern. All those visionary schemes for accomplishing the great\r\nobject of his ambition, which a few minutes before had floated in his\r\nvivid imagination, were now dispelled. He was now placed in one of\r\nthe most painful and difficult situations it is possible to conceive.\r\nHe had no doubt that the letter had been extorted from the king, yet\r\nhe considered that it would neither be prudent nor safe for him to\r\nrisk the responsibility of disobeying the king’s orders. Besides,\r\nwere he to attempt to act contrary to these instructions, he might\r\nthereby compromise the safety of the king, as his enemies would find\r\nit no difficult affair to convince the army that Montrose was acting\r\naccording to private instructions from the king himself. On the\r\nother hand, by instantly disbanding his army, Montrose considered\r\nthat he would leave the royalists, and all those friends who had\r\nshared his dangers, to the mercy of their enemies. In this dilemma,\r\nhe determined to convene a general meeting of all the principal\r\nroyalists, to consult as to how he should act--a resolution which\r\nshowed his good sense, and kind and just feeling towards those who\r\nhad been induced by his means to risk their lives and fortunes in\r\nthe cause of the king. Notwithstanding the many slights which had\r\nbeen put upon him by the Marquis of Huntly, Montrose, anxious to\r\npreserve a good understanding with him, sent Sir John Hurry and Sir\r\nJohn Innes to Huntly, to invite him to attend the proposed meeting,\r\nand that there might be no appearance of dictation on the part of\r\nMontrose, the time and place of meeting was left to Huntly’s own\r\nchoice. But this nobleman answered that he himself had received\r\norders similar to those sent to Montrose, which he was resolved to\r\nobey immediately, and, therefore, he declined to attend any meeting\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of matters, Montrose considered that his best and\r\nwisest course would be to keep his army together till he should\r\nreceive another communication from the king, in answer to a letter\r\nwhich he sent by a messenger of his own, in which he begged his\r\nmajesty to acquaint him with the real situation of matters, whether\r\nhe considered his person safe in the hands of the Covenanters, and\r\nif he could be of any farther service to him. Montrose begged also\r\nto be informed by the king, if he persevered in his resolution to\r\ndisband an army which had fought so bravely in his defence, and that\r\nat a time when his enemies, in both kingdoms, were still under arms;\r\nand if so, he wished to be instructed by his majesty as to the course\r\nhe should pursue, for the protection and security of the lives and\r\nfortunes of those brave men, who had encountered so many dangers, and\r\nhad spent their blood in his defence, as he could not endure the idea\r\nof leaving such loyal subjects to the mercy of their enemies.[357]\r\nThe king returned an answer[358] to this letter, by the former\r\nmessenger, Ker, in which he assured him that he no less esteemed\r\nhis willingness to lay down arms at his command, “for a gallant and\r\nreal expression” of his zeal and affection to his service than any\r\nof his former actions; but he hoped that Montrose had not such a\r\nmean opinion of him, that for any particular or worldly respects\r\nhe would suffer him (Montrose) to be ruined,--that his only reason\r\nfor sending Montrose out of the country was that he might return\r\nwith greater glory, and, in the meantime, to have as honourable an\r\nemployment as he (the king) could confer upon him,--that Ker would\r\ntell him the care he had of all Montrose’s friends, and his own, to\r\nwhom, although he could not promise such conditions as he would have\r\nwished, yet they would be such, all things considered, as were most\r\nfit for them to accept. “Wherefore,” continues his majesty, “I renew\r\nmy former directions, of laying down arms, unto you, desiring you to\r\nlet Huntly, Crawford, Airly, Seaforth, and Ogilvy, know, that want of\r\ntime hath made me now omit to reiterate my former commands unto you,\r\nintending that this shall serve for all; assuring them, and all the\r\nrest of my friends, that, whensoever God shall enable me, they shall\r\nreap the fruits of their loyalty and affection to my service.”\r\n\r\nThese ‘conditions,’ which consisted of several articles, and in the\r\ndrawing up of which the king probably had no concern, were far from\r\nsatisfactory to Montrose, who refused to accede to them. He even\r\nrefused to treat with the Covenanters, and sent back the messenger to\r\nthe king to notify to him, that as he had acted under his majesty’s\r\ncommission, he would admit of no conditions for laying down his\r\narms, or disbanding his army, which did not come directly from the\r\nking himself; but that if his majesty imposed conditions upon him,\r\nhe would accept of them with the most implicit submission. The king,\r\nwho had no alternative but to adopt these conditions as his own,\r\nput his name to them and sent back the messenger with them, with\r\nfresh instructions to Montrose to disband his army forthwith under\r\nthe pain of high treason. Besides Ker, the king despatched another\r\ntrusty messenger to Montrose with a private letter[359] urging him\r\nto accept of the conditions offered, as in the event of his refusal\r\nto break up his army, his majesty might be placed “in a very sad\r\ncondition,” such as he would rather leave Montrose to guess at than\r\nseek himself to express. From this expression, it would appear that\r\nCharles already began to entertain some apprehensions about his\r\npersonal safety. These commands of the king were too peremptory to be\r\nany longer withstood, and as Montrose had been informed that several\r\nof the leading royalists, particularly the Marquis of Huntly, Lord\r\nAboyne, and the Earl of Seaforth, were negotiating with the Estates\r\nin their own behalf, and that Huntly and Aboyne had even offered to\r\ncompel Montrose to lay down his arms in compliance with the orders of\r\nthe king, he immediately resolved to disband his army.\r\n\r\nAs Middleton had been intrusted by the Committee of Estates with\r\nample powers to negotiate with the royalists, and to see the\r\nconditions offered to Montrose implemented by him in case of\r\nacceptance, a cessation of arms was agreed upon between Montrose and\r\nMiddleton; and in order to discuss the conditions, a conference was\r\nheld between them on the 22d day of July, on a meadow, near the river\r\nIsla, in Angus, where they “conferred for the space of two hours,\r\nthere being none near them but one man for each of them to hold his\r\nhorse.”[360] The conditions agreed upon were these, that with the\r\nexception of Montrose himself, the Earl of Crawford, Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald, and Sir John Hurry, all those who had taken up arms\r\nagainst the Covenanters would be pardoned on making their submission,\r\nand that Montrose, Crawford, Hurry, and Graham of Gorthy, should\r\ntransport themselves beyond seas, before the last day of August, in\r\na ship to be provided by the Estates. This arrangement was ratified\r\nby the committee of Estates, but the committee of the kirk exclaimed\r\nagainst it, and petitioned the Committee of Estates not to sanction\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to disbanding his army, Montrose appointed it to\r\nrendezvous at Rattray, in the neighbourhood of Coupar-Angus, at which\r\nplace, on the 30th of July, he discharged his men, after addressing\r\nthem with feeling and animation. After giving them due praise for\r\ntheir faithful services and good behaviour, he told them his orders,\r\nand bade them farewell, an event no less sorrowful to the whole\r\narmy than to himself; and, notwithstanding that he used his utmost\r\nendeavours to raise their drooping spirits, and encourage them with\r\nthe flattering prospect of a speedy and desirable peace, and assured\r\nthem that he contributed to the king’s safety and interest by his\r\npresent ready submission, no less than he had formerly done by his\r\nmilitary attempts; yet they concluded, that a period was that day\r\nput to the king’s authority, which would expire with the dissolution\r\nof their army, for disbanding which, they were all convinced the\r\norders had been extorted from the king, or granted by him on purpose\r\nto evite a greater and more immediate evil. And, upon whatever\r\nfavourable conditions their own safety might be provided for, yet\r\nthey lamented their fate, and would much rather have undergone the\r\ngreatest fatigue and hardships than be obliged to remain inactive\r\nand idle spectators of the miseries and calamities befalling their\r\ndearest sovereign. Neither were their generous souls a little\r\nconcerned for the unworthy and disgraceful opinion which foreign\r\nnations and after ages could not fail to conceive of the Scots, as\r\nuniversally dipt in rebellion, and guilty of defection from the best\r\nof kings. Their sorrow was likewise considerably augmented by the\r\nthoughts of being separated from their brave and successful general,\r\nwho was now obliged to enter into a kind of banishment, to the\r\nirreparable loss of the king, the country, themselves, and all good\r\nmen, at a time when they never had greater occasion for his services:\r\nAnd falling down upon their knees, with tears in their eyes, they\r\nobtested him, that seeing the king’s safety and interest required his\r\nimmediate departure from the kingdom, he would take them along with\r\nhim to whatever corner of the world he would retire, professing their\r\nreadiness to live, to fight, nay, if it so please God, even to die\r\nunder his command. And not a few of them had privately determined,\r\nthough at the evident risk of their lives and fortunes, to follow him\r\nwithout his knowledge, and even against his inclination, and to offer\r\nhim their service in a foreign land, which they could not any longer\r\nafford him in their own distressed native country.[361]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of the affecting farewell between Montrose and\r\nthe few remaining brave and adventurous men who had shared with him\r\nall the dangers and vicissitudes of the battle-field, as related by a\r\nwarm partisan of fallen royalty; yet there is no reason for supposing\r\nthat he has given an exaggerated view of the feelings of the warlike\r\nand devoted band at parting, under existing circumstances, with their\r\nbeloved commander who had so often led them to victory, and whose\r\nbanishment from his native country they regarded as the death-blow\r\nto their hopes.\r\n\r\nUpon the dissolution of Montrose’s army, the Scots officers and\r\nsoldiers retired to their homes, and the Irish troops marched\r\nwestward into Argyle, whence they embarked for their own country,\r\nbeing accompanied thither by the Earl of Crawford, who from thence\r\nwent to Spain. Montrose, along with the few friends who were to\r\nfollow him abroad, took up his abode at his seat of Old Montrose,\r\nthere to wait the arrival of the vessel destined to convey them to\r\nthe continent. The day fixed for Montrose’s departure was the 1st\r\nof September, and he waited with impatience for the arrival of the\r\nexpected vessel; but as the month of August was fast expiring without\r\nsuch vessel making its appearance, or any apparent preparation for\r\nthe voyage, Montrose’s friends applied to the committee of the\r\nEstates for a prorogation of the day stipulated for his departure,\r\nbut they could obtain no satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the last day of August, a vessel for the reception of\r\nthe marquis entered the harbour of Montrose, in which he proposed\r\nimmediately to embark, but he was told by the shipmaster, “a violent\r\nand rigid Covenanter,” that he meant to careen his vessel before\r\ngoing to sea, an operation which would occupy a few days. In the\r\ncourse of conversation, the shipmaster bluntly stated to his intended\r\npassengers, that he had received express instructions to land them\r\nat certain ports. The behaviour of the captain, joined to the\r\ninformation he had communicated, and the fact that several English\r\nships of war had been seen for several days off the coast, as if\r\nwatching his embarkation and departure, created a strong suspicion\r\nin Montrose’s mind that a plan had been laid for capturing him,\r\nand induced him to consult his own safety and that of his friends,\r\nby seeking another way of leaving the kingdom. The anxiety of\r\nMontrose and his followers was speedily relieved by the arrival of\r\nintelligence, that a small vessel belonging to Bergen, in Norway,\r\nhad been found in the neighbouring harbour of Stonehaven; and that\r\nthe master had engaged, on being promised a handsome freight, to be\r\nin readiness, on an appointed day, to sail with such passengers as\r\nshould appear.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after sending off Sir John Hurry, John Drummond of\r\nBalloch, Graham of Gorthy, Dr. Wishart, and a few other friends by\r\nland to Stonehaven, on the 3d of September 1646, he himself left the\r\nharbour of Montrose in a small boat, disguised as the servant of\r\nJames Wood, a clergyman, who accompanied him; and the same evening\r\nwent safely on board the vessel, into which his friends had embarked,\r\nand setting sail with a fair wind, arrived in a few days at Bergen,\r\nin Norway, where he received a friendly welcome from Thomas Gray, a\r\nScotsman, the governor of the castle of Bergen.[362]\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the province of this history to give a detailed account\r\nof the transactions which took place between the Scotch and English\r\nconcerning the disbanding of the Scottish army and the delivery of\r\nthe king to the English parliament. Although the Scotch are certainly\r\nnot free from blame for having betrayed their king, after he had cast\r\nhimself upon their loyalty and mercy, still it must be remembered,\r\nin extenuation, that the king was merely playing a game, that his\r\ngiving himself up to the Scotch army was his last desperate move,\r\nand that he would not have had the least scruple in outwitting,\r\ndeceiving, and even destroying his protectors. In September, 1646,\r\nan agreement was come to between the Scotch commissioners and the\r\nEnglish parliament, that the army should be disbanded, on the latter\r\npaying £400,000 as payment in full of the arrears of pay due to\r\nthe army for its services. There was no mention then made of the\r\ndelivery of the king, and a candid examination of the evidence on\r\nboth sides proves that the one transaction was quite independent of\r\nthe other. “That fanaticism and self-interest had steeled the breasts\r\nof the Covenanters against the more generous impulses of loyalty and\r\ncompassion, may, indeed, be granted; but more than this cannot be\r\nlegitimately inferred from any proof furnished by history.”[363]\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations for the delivery of the king were pending,\r\nCharles, who seems to have been fully aware of them, meditated the\r\ndesign of escaping from the Scots army, and putting himself at the\r\nhead of such forces as the Marquis of Huntly could raise in the\r\nnorth. In pursuance of this design, his majesty, about the middle of\r\nDecember, sent Robert Leslie, brother of General David Leslie, with\r\nletters and a private commission to Huntly, by which he was informed\r\nof his majesty’s intentions, and Huntly was, therefore, desired\r\nto levy what forces he could, and have them in readiness to take\r\nthe field on his arrival in the north. On receipt of his majesty’s\r\ncommands, Huntly began to raise forces, and having collected them at\r\nBanff, fortified the town, and there awaited the king’s arrival.[364]\r\nBut the king was prevented from putting his plan into execution by a\r\npremature discovery, and was thenceforth much more strictly guarded.\r\n\r\nAfter the delivery of the king to the English, on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1647, the Scots army returned to Scotland. It was thereupon\r\nremodelled and reduced, by order of the parliament, to 6,000 foot,\r\nand 1,200 horse; a force which was considered sufficient not only\r\nto keep the royalists in awe, but also to reduce the Marquis of\r\nHuntly and Sir Alexander Macdonald, who were still at the head of\r\nsome men. The dispersion, therefore, of the forces under these\r\ntwo commanders became the immediate object of the parliament. An\r\nattempt had been made in the month of January, by a division of\r\nthe covenanting army stationed in Aberdeenshire, under the command\r\nof Major Bickerton, to surprise the Marquis of Huntly at Banff,\r\nbut it had been obliged to retire with loss; and Huntly continued\r\nto remain in his position till the month of April, when, on the\r\napproach of General David Leslie with a considerable force, he fled\r\nwith a few friends to the mountains of Lochaber for shelter. Leslie\r\nthereupon reduced the castles belonging to the marquis. He first took\r\nthat of Strathbogie, and sent the commander thereof, the laird of\r\nNewton-Gordon, to Edinburgh; then the castle of Lesmore; and lastly,\r\nthe Bog of Gicht, or Gordon castle, the commander of which, James\r\nGordon of Letterfurie, and his brother, Thomas Gordon of Clastirim,\r\nand other gentlemen of the name of Gordon, were sent to Edinburgh as\r\nprisoners. Leslie next took the isle of Lochtanner, in Aboyne, which\r\nhad been fortified by Huntly.[365] Quarter was given to the men who\r\ngarrisoned those different strengths, with the exception of the Irish\r\nand deserters, who were hanged immediately on their capture.[366]\r\n\r\nHaving taken these different places, Leslie, in quest of the\r\nmarquis, next marched into Badenoch, where he captured the castle of\r\nRuthven. Thence he proceeded into Lochaber, and took the fortress\r\nof Inverlochy. Huntly disbanded his forces in Badenoch, reserving\r\nonly a few as a body-guard for himself and his son; “showing them\r\nthat he was resolved to live an outlaw till provident heaven should\r\nbe pleased to change the king’s fortune, upon whose commandments\r\nhis life and fortune should always depend.”[367] The covenanting\r\ngeneral, thereupon, marched to the south with a part of his forces,\r\nleaving the remainder in the north, under the command of Middleton,\r\nand encamped in Strathallan, he himself taking up his head-quarters\r\nin Dunblane. Here he remained till the middle of May, when he was\r\njoined by the Marquis of Argyle, and ordered to advance into that\r\nnobleman’s country to drive out Sir Alexander Macdonald. Accordingly,\r\nhe set out on the 17th of May, and arrived at Inverary on the 21st.\r\nSir Alexander Macdonald was at this time in Kintyre, with a force of\r\nabout 1,400 foot and two troops of horse, which would have been fully\r\nsufficient to check Leslie, but he seems not to have been aware of\r\nthe advance of the latter, and had taken no precautions to guard the\r\npasses leading into the peninsula, which might have been successfully\r\ndefended by a handful of men against a considerable force. Having\r\nsecured these difficult passes, Leslie advanced into Kintyre, and\r\nafter skirmishing the whole of the 25th of May with Macdonald, forced\r\nhim to retire. After throwing 300 men into a fortress on the top of\r\nthe hill of Dunaverty, and in which “there was not a drop of water\r\nbut what fell from the clouds,”[368] Macdonald, on the following day,\r\nembarked his troops in boats provided for the occasion, and passed\r\nover into Islay.\r\n\r\nLeslie, thereupon, laid siege to the castle of Dunaverty, which was\r\nwell defended; but the assailants having carried a trench at the\r\nbottom of the hill which gave the garrison the command of water,\r\nand in the storming of which the besieged lost 40 men, the latter\r\ncraved a parley, in consequence of which Sir James Turner, Leslie’s\r\nadjutant-general, was sent to confer with the garrison on the terms\r\nof surrender. Leslie would not grant “any other conditions than that\r\nthey should yield on discretion or mercy. And it seemed strange to\r\nme,” continues Sir James Turner, “to hear the lieutenant-general’s\r\nnice distinction, that they should yield themselves to the kingdom’s\r\nmercy, and not to his. At length they did so, and after they had\r\ncome out of the castle, they were put to the sword, every mother’s\r\nson, except one young man, Maccoul, whose life I begged to be sent\r\nto France, with 100 fellows which we had smoked out of a cave, as\r\nthey do foxes, who were given to Captain Campbell, the chancellor’s\r\nbrother.”[369] This atrocious act was perpetrated at the instigation\r\nof John Nave or Neaves, “a bloody preacher,”[370] but, according to\r\nWodrow, an “excellent man,” who would not be satisfied with less than\r\nthe blood of the prisoners. As the account given by Sir James Turner,\r\nan eye-witness of this infamous transaction, is curious, no apology\r\nis necessary for inserting it. “Here it will be fit to make a stop,\r\ntill this cruel action be canvassed. First, the lieutenant-general\r\nwas two days irresolute what to do. The Marquis of Argyle was\r\naccused at his arraignment of this murder, and I was examined as a\r\nwitness. I declared, which was true, that I never heard him advise\r\nthe lieutenant-general to it. What he did in private I know not.\r\nSecondly, Argyle was but a colonel then, and he had no power to do\r\nit of himself. Thirdly, though he had advised him to it, it was no\r\ncapital crime; for counsel is no command. Fourthly, I have several\r\ntimes spoke to the lieutenant-general to save these men’s lives, and\r\nhe always assented to it, and I know of himself he was unwilling\r\nto shed their blood. Fifthly, Mr. John Nave (who was appointed by\r\nthe commission of the kirk to wait on him as his chaplain) never\r\nceased to tempt him to that bloodshed, yea, and threatened him with\r\nthe curses befell Saul for sparing the Amalekites, for with them\r\nhis theology taught him to compare the Dunaverty men. And I verily\r\nbelieve that this prevailed most with David Leslie, who looked upon\r\nNave as the representative of the kirk of Scotland.” The fact of\r\nSir James and David Leslie’s repugnance to shed the blood of those\r\ndefenceless men is fully corroborated by Bishop Guthry, on the\r\nauthority of many persons who were present, who says that while\r\nthe butchery was going on, and while Leslie, Argyle, and Neaves\r\nwere walking over the ancles in blood, Leslie turned out and thus\r\naddressed the latter:--“Now, Mr. John, have you not once got your\r\nfill of blood?” The sufferers on this occasion were partly Irish, and\r\npartly belonging to the clan Dougal or Coull, to the castle of whose\r\nchief, in Lorne, Colonel Robert Montgomerie now laid siege, while\r\nLeslie himself, with a part of his forces, left Kintyre for Islay in\r\npursuit of Macdonald.\r\n\r\nOn landing in Islay, Leslie found that Macdonald had fled to Ireland,\r\nand had left Colkittoch, his father, in the castle of Dunniveg, with\r\na force of 200 men to defend the island against the superior power\r\nof Leslie. The result turned out as might have been anticipated.\r\nAlthough the garrison made a brave resistance, yet, being wholly\r\nwithout water, they found themselves unable to resist, and offered\r\nto capitulate on certain conditions. These were, that the officers\r\nshould be entitled to go where they pleased, and that the privates\r\nshould be sent to France. These conditions were agreed to, and were\r\npunctually fulfilled. Old Colkittoch had, however, the misfortune\r\nnot to be included in this capitulation, for, before the castle had\r\nsurrendered, “the old man, Coll,” says Sir James Turner, “coming\r\nfoolishly out of the house, where he was governor, on some parole or\r\nother,[371] to speak with his old friend, the captain of Dunstaffnage\r\ncastle, was surprised, and made prisoner, not without some stain to\r\nthe lieutenant-general’s honour. He was afterwards hanged by a jury\r\nof Argyle’s sheriff-depute, one George Campbell, from whose sentence\r\nfew are said to have escaped that kind of death.”\r\n\r\nLeaving Islay, Leslie “boated over to Jura, a horrible isle,” says\r\nSir James Turner, “and a habitation fit for deer and wild beasts; and\r\nso from isle to isle,” continues he, “till he came to Mull, which\r\nis one of the best of the Hebrides. Here Maclaine saved his lands,\r\nwith the loss of his reputation, if he ever had any. He gave up his\r\nstrong castles to Leslie, gave his eldest son for hostage of his\r\nfidelity, and, which was unchristian baseness in the lowest degree,\r\nhe delivered up fourteen prettie Irishmen, who had been all along\r\nfaithful to him, to the lieutenant-general, who immediately caused\r\nhang them all. It was not well done to demand them from Maclaine, but\r\ninexcusablie ill done in him to betray them. Here I cannot forget one\r\nDonald Campbell, fleshed in blood from his very infancie, who with\r\nall imaginable violence pressed that the whole clan Maclaine should\r\nbe put to the edge of the sword; nor could he be commanded to forbear\r\nhis bloody suit by the lieutenant-general and two major-generals;\r\nand with some difficulty was he commanded silence by his chief, the\r\nMarquis of Argyle. For my part, I said nothing, for indeed I did not\r\ncare though he had prevailed in his suit, the delivery of the Irish\r\nhad so irritated me against that whole clan and name.”\r\n\r\nWhile Leslie was thus subduing the Hebrides, Middleton was occupied\r\nin pursuing the Marquis of Huntly through Glenmoriston, Badenoch, and\r\nother places. Huntly was at length captured by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMenzies, in Strathdon, in December, 1647. Having received\r\nintelligence of the place of the marquis’s retreat, Menzies came to\r\nDalnabo with a select body of horse, consisting of three troops,\r\nabout midnight, and immediately entered the house just as Huntly was\r\ngoing to bed. The marquis was attended by only ten gentlemen and\r\nservants, as a sort of body-guard, who notwithstanding the great\r\ndisparity of numbers, made a brave attempt to protect the marquis, in\r\nwhich six of them were killed and the rest mortally wounded, among\r\nwhom was John Grant, the landlord. On hearing that the marquis had\r\nbeen taken prisoner, the whole of his vassals in the neighbourhood,\r\nto the number of between 400 and 500, with Grant of Carron at\r\ntheir head, flew to arms to rescue him. Lieutenant-Colonel Menzies\r\nthereupon carried the marquis to the castle of Blairfindie, in\r\nGlenlivet, about four miles from Dalnabo, where the latter received\r\na notice from Grant and his party by the wife of Gordon of Munmore,\r\nthat they had solemnly sworn either to rescue him or die to a man,\r\nand they requested him to give them such orders to carry their plan\r\ninto effect as he might judge proper. But the marquis dissuaded his\r\npeople from the intended attempt, and returned for answer that, now\r\nalmost worn out with grief and fatigue, he could no longer live in\r\nhills and dens; and hoped that his enemies would not drive things to\r\nthe worst; but, if such was the will of heaven, he could not outlive\r\nthe sad fate he foresaw his royal master was likely to undergo; and\r\nbe the event as it would, he doubted not but the just providence of\r\nGod would restore the royal family, and his own along with it.[372]\r\n\r\nBesides the gentlemen and servants about Huntly’s person, there were\r\nsome Irish who were quartered in the offices about Dalnabo. These\r\nwere carried prisoners by Menzies to Strathbogie, where Middleton\r\nthen was, who ordered them all to be shot. In consequence of an\r\norder from the committee of Estates at Edinburgh, Menzies carried\r\nthe marquis under a strong guard of horse to Leith, where, after\r\nbeing kept two days, he was delivered up to the magistrates, and\r\nincarcerated in the jail of the city. The committee had previously\r\ndebated the question whether the marquis should be immediately\r\nexecuted or reprieved till the meeting of parliament, but although\r\nthe Argyle faction, notwithstanding the Marquis of Argyle withdrew\r\nbefore the vote was taken, and the committee of the church did every\r\nthing in their power to procure the immediate execution of the\r\nmarquis, his life was spared till the meeting of the parliament by a\r\nmajority of one vote.[373] The Earl of Aboyne and Lord Lewis Gordon\r\nhad the good fortune to escape to the continent. The first went to\r\nFrance, where he shortly thereafter died--the second took refuge in\r\nHolland. A reward of £1,000 sterling had been promised to any person\r\nwho should apprehend Huntly, which sum was duly paid to Menzies by\r\nthe Committee of Estates.[374]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Second Marquis of Huntly.--From a rare print in the\r\ncollection of W. F. Watson, Esq., Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no doubt that Argyle was highly gratified at the\r\ncapture of Huntly. It is related by Spalding, that taking advantage\r\nof Huntly’s situation, Argyle bought up all the comprisings on his\r\nlands, and that he caused summon at the market-cross of Aberdeen by\r\nsound of trumpet, all Huntly’s wadsetters and creditors to appear\r\nat Edinburgh in the month of March following Huntly’s imprisonment,\r\ncalling on them to produce their securities before the lords of\r\nsession, with certification that if they did not appear, their\r\nsecurities were to be declared null and void. Some of Huntly’s\r\ncreditors sold their claims to Argyle, and having thus bought up all\r\nthe rights he could obtain upon Huntly’s estate at a small or nominal\r\nvalue, under the pretence that he was acting for the benefit of his\r\nnephew, Lord Gordon, he granted bonds for the amount which, according\r\nto Spalding, he never paid. In this way did Argyle possess himself\r\nof the marquis’s estates, which he continued to enjoy upwards of\r\ntwelve years; viz., from 1648, till the restoration of Charles II. in\r\n1660.\r\n\r\nWhen the king, who was then a prisoner in Carisbrook castle, heard\r\nof the capture of Huntly, he wrote a letter to the Earl of Lanark,\r\nthen in London, earnestly urging him to do all in his power in behalf\r\nof the Marquis. The earl, however, either from unwillingness or\r\ninability, appears to have paid no attention to this letter.\r\n\r\nShortly before the capture of the Marquis of Huntly, John Gordon\r\nof Innermarkie, Gordon, younger of Newton-Gordon, and the laird of\r\nHarthill, three of his chief friends, had been taken prisoners by\r\nMajor-General Middleton, and sent to Edinburgh, where they were\r\nimprisoned. The two latter were condemned to die by the Committee\r\nof Estates, and although their friends procured a remission of the\r\nsentence from the king, they were, notwithstanding, both beheaded at\r\nthe market-cross of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nWhile the hopes of the royalists, both in England and Scotland,\r\nseemed to be almost extinguished, a ray of light, about this time,\r\ndarted through the dark gloom of the political horizon, which they\r\nfondly imagined was the harbinger of a new and, for them, a better\r\norder of things; but all their expectations were destined to end in\r\nbitter disappointment. The Duke of Hamilton, who had lately formed\r\nan association to release the king from his captivity, which went\r\nunder the name of the “Engagement,” prevailed upon the parliament,\r\nwhich met in March, 1648, to appoint a committee of danger, and to\r\nconsent to a levy of 40,000 men. The bulk of the English population,\r\nwith the exception of the army, had grown quite dissatisfied with the\r\nstate of matters. Their eyes were now directed towards Scotland, and\r\nthe news of the Scots’ levy made them indulge a hope that they would\r\nsoon be enabled, by the aid of the Scots auxiliaries, to throw off\r\nthe military yoke, and restore the king on conditions favourable to\r\nliberty. But Hamilton, being thwarted by Argyle and his party, had it\r\nnot in his power to take advantage of the favourable disposition of\r\nthe English people, and instead of raising 40,000 men, he found, to\r\nhis great mortification, that, at the utmost, he could, after upwards\r\nof three months’ labour, only bring about 15,000 men into the field,\r\nand that not until several insurrections in England, in favour of the\r\nking, had been suppressed.\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of Hamilton that with every disposition to\r\nserve the cause of his royal master, he had neither the capacity to\r\nconceive, nor the resolution to adopt bold and decisive measures\r\nequal to the emergency of the times. Like the king, he attempted\r\nto act the part of the cunning politician, but was wholly unfitted\r\nfor the performance of such a character. Had he had the address\r\nto separate old Leslie and his nephew from the party of Argyle,\r\nby placing the direction of military affairs in their hands, he\r\nmight have succeeded in raising a force sufficient to cope with\r\nthe parliamentary army of England; but he had the weakness, after\r\nboth these generals had joined the kirk in its remonstrance to\r\nthe parliament that nothing should be done without the consent of\r\nthe committee of the general assembly, to get himself appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army, a measure which could not fail to\r\ndisgust these hardy veterans. He failed in an attempt to conciliate\r\nthe Marquis of Argyle, who did all in his power to thwart Hamilton’s\r\ndesigns. Argyle went to Fife and induced the gentry of that county\r\nnot only to oppose the levies, but to hold themselves in readiness to\r\nrise on the other side when called upon. He was not so successful in\r\nStirlingshire, none of the gentlemen of that county concurring in his\r\nviews except the laird of Buchanan, Sir William Bruce of Stenhouse,\r\nand a few persons of inferior note; but in Dumbartonshire he\r\nsucceeded to the utmost of his wishes. After attending a meeting with\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, (Loudon,) the Earls of Cassilis and Eglinton,\r\nand David Dick and other ministers, at Eglinton’s house, on the 29th\r\nof May, Argyle went home to raise his own people.\r\n\r\nSeveral instances of opposition to the levy took place; but the most\r\nformidable one, and the only one worthy of notice, was in Ayrshire,\r\nwhere a body of armed insurgents, to the number of 800 horse and\r\n1,200 foot according to one writer,[375] and 500 horse and 2,000 foot\r\naccording to another,[376] headed by several ministers, assembled at\r\nMauchline; but they were defeated and dispersed, on the 10th of June,\r\nby Middleton, who had been appointed lieutenant-general of horse,\r\nwith the loss of 80 men.\r\n\r\nThere are no data by which to ascertain the number of men raised\r\nin the Highlands for Hamilton’s army; but it must necessarily\r\nhave been very inconsiderable. Not a single man was of course\r\nraised in Argyleshire, and scarcely any in the adjoining part of\r\nInverness-shire, to which the influence or power of Argyle extended.\r\nThe Earl of Sutherland, who had been appointed a colonel of foot in\r\nhis own division, declined the office, and Lord Reay was so disgusted\r\nwith “Duke Hamilton’s failure,” that he took shipping at Thurso in\r\nthe month of July, and went to Norway,[377] where he was appointed\r\ngovernor of Bergen, and received the colonelcy of a regiment from the\r\nKing of Denmark, whom he had formerly served. The only individual who\r\ncould have benefitted the royal-cause in the north was the Marquis\r\nof Huntly, but by a strange fatality the Duke of Hamilton, who could\r\nhave easily procured an order from the parliament for his liberation\r\nfrom prison, allowed him to continue there, and merely contented\r\nhimself with obtaining a warrant for changing the marquis’s place of\r\nconfinement from the jail to the castle of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the many difficulties which occurred in collecting\r\nhis troops, and providing the necessary _matériel_ for the use of\r\nthe army, the duke was not able to begin his march till the 8th of\r\nJuly, on which day he put his army in motion towards the borders.\r\nHis force, which amounted to about 10,000 foot and 4,000 horse, was\r\ncomposed of raw and undisciplined levies, and he had not a single\r\nfield-piece. He entered England by the western border, where he was\r\nmet by Sir Marmaduke Langdale and a body of 4,000 brave cavaliers,\r\nall devotedly attached to the king. At this time Lambert, the\r\nparliamentary general, had invested Carlisle, and Hamilton was\r\ninduced by the English royalists, contrary to his own views, to march\r\nupon Carlisle, and force Lambert to raise the siege. That general,\r\nwho had received orders from Cromwell not to engage the Scots till he\r\nshould join him, accordingly retired, and Carlisle was delivered up\r\nnext day to Hamilton by the English royalists, who also put him in\r\npossession of Berwick.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter into details concerning this mismanaged\r\nand unfortunate expedition, the result of which is well known to\r\nevery reader of English history. Sir Marmaduke Langdale was defeated\r\nby Cromwell at Preston on the 17th of August, and on entering the\r\ntown after the defeat, was mortified to find that his Scotch allies\r\nhad abandoned it. Langdale having now no alternative but flight,\r\ndisbanded his infantry, and along with his cavalry and Hamilton, who,\r\nrefusing to follow the example of his army, had remained in the town,\r\nswam across the Ribble.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch army retired during the night towards Wigan, where it\r\nwas joined by the duke next morning, but so reduced in spirits and\r\nweakened by desertion as to be quite unable to make any resistance\r\nto the victorious troops of Cromwell, who pressed hard upon them.\r\nThe foot, under the command of Baillie, continued to retreat during\r\nthe day, but were overtaken at Warrington, and, being unable either\r\nto proceed or to resist, surrendered. The number which capitulated\r\namounted to about 3,000. Upwards of 6,000 had previously been\r\ncaptured by the country people, and the few who had the good fortune\r\nto escape joined Munro and returned to Scotland. These prisoners were\r\nsold as slaves, and sent to the plantations.\r\n\r\nThe duke, abandoning Baillie to his fate, carried off the whole\r\ncavalry; but he had not proceeded far when his rear was attacked by\r\nthe parliamentary army. Middleton made a gallant defence, and was\r\ntaken prisoner; but the duke escaped, and fled to Uttoxeter, followed\r\nby his horse, where he surrendered himself to General Lambert and\r\nLord Grey of Groby, who sent him prisoner to Windsor. The Earl\r\nof Callander, having effected his escape, went over to Holland,\r\ndisgusted at the conduct of the duke.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the defeat of Hamilton reached Scotland,\r\nthe Covenanters of the west began to bestir themselves, and a\r\nparty of them, under the command of Robert Montgomery, son of the\r\nEarl of Eglinton, attacked a troop of Lanark’s horse, quartered in\r\nAyrshire, killed some and routed the rest. The Committee of Estates,\r\napprehensive that the spirit of insurrection would speedily spread,\r\nimmediately ordered out all the fencible men in the kingdom to put\r\ndown the rising in the west. A difference, however, arose in the\r\ncommittee in the choice of a commander. The Earl of Lanark and the\r\nEarl Marischal were proposed by their respective friends. Lanark’s\r\nchief opponent was the Earl of Roxburgh, who, (says Wishart,) “in a\r\ngrave and modest speech, earnestly entreated him, for the sake of\r\ntheir dear sovereign and their distressed country, not to insist\r\nin demanding that dignity, which was extremely unseasonable and\r\nill-judged at that time.”[378] Roxburgh’s remonstrance had no effect\r\nupon Lanark, who, on a vote being taken, was found to have the\r\nmajority, and so anxious was he to obtain the command of the army\r\nthat he actually voted for himself.[379] He had even the indiscretion\r\nto declare, that he would not permit any other person to command in\r\nhis brother’s absence. This rash and imprudent behaviour on the part\r\nof Lanark so exasperated Roxburgh and his friends, who justly dreaded\r\nthe utter ruin of the king’s affairs, that they henceforth withdrew\r\naltogether from public affairs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lanark had been appointed to the command of the new levy,\r\nhe set about raising it with great expedition. For this purpose he\r\nsent circulars, plausibly written, to every part of Scotland, calling\r\nupon all classes to join him without delay. These circulars had the\r\ndesired effect. The people beyond the Forth, and even the men of\r\nFife, showed a disposition to obey the call. The Earl of Seaforth\r\nraised 4,000 men in the Western Islands and in Ross-shire, whom he\r\nbrought south, and the Earl of Morton also brought into Lothian 1,200\r\nmen from the Orkneys. In short, with the exception of Argyle, there\r\nwere few places in Scotland from which considerable bodies of men\r\nmight not have been expected.\r\n\r\nBefore the defeat of Hamilton’s army, Lanark had raised three\r\nregiments of horse, which were now under his command. These, with\r\nthe accessions of force which were daily arriving from different\r\nparts of the kingdom, were quite sufficient to have put down the\r\ninsurrection in the west; but instead of marching thither, Lanark, to\r\nthe surprise of every person, proceeded through East Lothian towards\r\nthe eastern borders to meet Sir George Munro, who was retiring\r\nupon Berwick before the army of Cromwell. The people of the west\r\nbeing thus relieved from the apprehensions of a visit, assembled\r\nin great numbers, and taking advantage of Lanark’s absence, a body\r\nof them, to the number of no less than 6,000 men, headed by the\r\nchancellor, the Earl of Eglinton, and some ministers, advanced upon\r\nthe capital, which they entered without opposition, the magistrates\r\nand ministers of the city welcoming their approach by going out to\r\nmeet them. Bishop Wishart describes this body as “a confused rabble,\r\ncomposed of farmers, cow-herds, shepherds, coblers, and such like\r\nmob, without arms, and without courage,” and says, that when they\r\narrived in Edinburgh, “they were provided with arms, which, as they\r\nwere unaccustomed to, were rather a burden and incumbrance than of\r\nany use,”--that “they were mounted upon horses, or jades rather,\r\nwhich had been long used to the drudgery of labour, equipped with\r\npack saddles and halters, in place of saddles and bridles.”[380]\r\nThis tumultuary body, however, was soon put into proper order by the\r\nEarl of Leven, who was invested with the chief command, and by David\r\nLeslie, as his lieutenant-general, and presented a rather formidable\r\nappearance, for on Lanark’s return from the south, he did not venture\r\nto engage it, though his force amounted to 4,000 or 5,000 horse and\r\nas many foot, many of whom were veterans who had served in Ireland\r\nunder Munro.\r\n\r\nIn thus declining to attack Leslie, Lanark acted contrary to the\r\nadvice of Munro and his other officers. According to Dr. Wishart,\r\nLanark’s advanced guard, on arriving at Musselburgh, fell in with\r\nsome of Leslie’s outposts, who defended the bridge over the Esk, and\r\nLanark’s advanced guard, though inferior in number, immediately put\r\nthem in great disorder, and killed some of them without sustaining\r\nany loss. This success was reported to Lanark, and it was represented\r\nto him, that by following it up immediately, while the enemy\r\ncontinued in the state of alarm into which this affair of outposts\r\nhad thrown them, he might, perhaps, obtain a bloodless victory, and\r\nsecure possession of the city of Edinburgh and the town of Leith,\r\nwith all the warlike stores, before sunset.\r\n\r\nLeading his army along the base of the Pentland hills, Lanark\r\nproceeded to Linlithgow, which he entered on the evening of the 11th\r\nof September, where he almost surprised the Earl of Cassilis, who,\r\nat the head of 800 horse from Carrick and Galloway, had taken up his\r\nquarters there for the night; but a notice having been sent to him of\r\nthe Earl of Lanark’s approach by some friend, he fled precipitately\r\nto Queensferry, leaving the supper which was cooking for him and\r\nhis men on the fire, which repast was greedily devoured by Lanark’s\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nEver since Lanark’s march to the borders to meet Munro, the\r\nMarquis of Argyle had been busily employed in raising men in his\r\nown territory to assist the insurgents, but it had been so much\r\ndepopulated by the ravages of Montrose and Macdonald, that he could\r\nscarcely muster 300 men. With these and 400 more which he had\r\ncollected in the Lennox and in the western part of Stirlingshire,\r\nhe advanced to Stirling, entering it upon the 12th of September\r\nat eleven o’clock forenoon. After assigning to the troops their\r\ndifferent posts in the town, and making arrangements with the\r\nmagistrates for their support, Argyle went to dine with the Earl of\r\nMar at his residence in the town. But while the dinner was serving\r\nup, Argyle, to his infinite alarm, heard that a part of Lanark’s\r\nforces had entered Stirling. This was the advanced guard, commanded\r\nby Sir George Munro, who, on hearing that Argyle was in possession of\r\nthe town when only within two miles of it, had, unknown to Lanark,\r\nwho was behind with the main body of the army, pushed forward and\r\nentered the town before Argyle’s men were aware of his approach.\r\nArgyle, as formerly, having a great regard for his personal safety,\r\nimmediately mounted his horse, galloped across Stirling bridge,\r\nand never looked behind till he reached North Queensferry, where\r\nhe instantly crossed the Frith in a small boat and proceeded to\r\nEdinburgh. Nearly 200 of Argyle’s men were either killed or drowned,\r\nand the remainder were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nA negotiation for peace immediately ensued between the two parties,\r\nand on the 15th of September a treaty was entered into by which\r\nthe Hamilton party agreed to refer all civil matters in dispute\r\nto a Parliament, to be held before the 10th of January, and all\r\necclesiastical affairs to an assembly of the kirk. It was also\r\nstipulated that both armies should be disbanded before the 29th of\r\nSeptember, or at farthest on the 5th of October, that the adherents\r\nof the king should not be disturbed, and that all the prisoners taken\r\nin Scotland should be released. Munro perceiving that the king’s\r\naffairs would be irretrievably ruined by this compromise, objected to\r\nthe treaty, and would have stood out had he been backed by the other\r\nofficers; but very few seconding his views, he addressed the troops,\r\nwho had accompanied him from Ireland, in St Ninian’s church, and\r\noffered to lead back to Ireland such as were inclined to serve under\r\ntheir old commander, Major-General Robert Munro; but having received\r\nintelligence at Glasgow that that general had been taken prisoner and\r\nsent to London, he disbanded the troops who had followed him thither,\r\nand retired to Holland.\r\n\r\nAccording to the treaty the two armies were disbanded on the\r\nappointed day, and the “Whigamores,” as the insurgents from the west\r\nwere called, immediately returned home to cut down their corn, which\r\nwas ready for the sickle. Argyle’s men, who had been taken prisoners\r\nat Stirling, were set at liberty, and conducted home to their own\r\ncountry by one of Argyle’s officers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUNRO. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Argyle, Loudon the chancellor, the Earls of Cassilis\r\nand Eglinton, and others, now met at Edinburgh, and formed themselves\r\ninto a body under the title of the Committee of Estates, and having\r\narranged matters for the better securing their own influence, they\r\nsummoned a parliament to meet on the 4th of January. In the meantime,\r\nOliver Cromwell, who, after the pursuit of Munro, had laid siege\r\nto Berwick, was waited upon by Argyle, Lord Elcho, and Sir Charles\r\nErskine, to compliment him upon his success at Preston, and after\r\nmaking Ludovick Leslie deliver up Berwick to him, they invited him\r\nand Lambert to Edinburgh. Cromwell took up his residence in the House\r\nof Lady Home in the Canongate, where he received frequent visits\r\nfrom Argyle, Loudon, the Earl of Lothian, Lords Arbuthnot, Elcho,\r\nand Burleigh, and the most noted of the ministers. It is said, that\r\nduring these conferences, Cromwell communicated to his visitors his\r\nintentions with respect to the king, and obtained their consent.[381]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Independents were doing their utmost to induce\r\nthe English parliament to bring the king to trial for high treason.\r\nThey, having in the meantime been disappointed in their views by\r\nthe presbyterians, prevailed upon Fairfax to order Hammond, the\r\ngovernor of the Isle of Wight, to attend him at Windsor, and to\r\nsend Colonel Eure with orders to seize the king at Newport, where\r\nhe was conferring with the commissioners, and imprison him again\r\nin Carisbrook castle; but Hammond having declined to allow Eure to\r\ninterfere without an order from the parliament, Eure left the island\r\nwithout attempting to fulfil his instructions. Hammond, however,\r\nafterwards left the island with the commissioners, and committed\r\nCharles to the custody of one Major Rolfe, a person who, only six\r\nmonths before, had been charged with a design on the life of the\r\nking, and who had escaped trial because only one witness had attested\r\nthe fact before the grand jury.\r\n\r\nThe king seemed to be fully aware of the danger of his present\r\nsituation, and on the morning of the 28th of November, when the\r\ncommissioners left the island, he gave vent to his feelings in a\r\nstrain of the most pathetic emotions, which drew tears from his\r\nattendants; “My lords,” said he to the commissioners, “I believe we\r\nshall scarce ever see each other again, but God’s will be done! I\r\nhave made my peace with him, and shall undergo without fear whatever\r\nhe may suffer men to do to me. My lords, you cannot but know, that in\r\nmy fall and ruin you see your own, and that also near you. I pray God\r\nsend you better friends than I have found. I am fully informed of the\r\ncarriage of those who plot against me and mine; but nothing affects\r\nme so much as the feeling I have of the sufferings of my subjects,\r\nand the mischief that hangs over my three kingdoms, drawn upon them\r\nby those who, upon pretences of good, violently pursue their own\r\ninterests and ends.”[382] As soon as the commissioners and Hammond\r\nhad quitted the island, Fairfax sent a troop of horse and a company\r\nof foot, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cobbett, to seize\r\nthe king, who received notice of the approach of this body and of its\r\nobject next morning from a person in disguise; but although advised\r\nby the Duke of Richmond, the Earl of Lindsay, and Colonel Coke to\r\nmake his escape, which he could easily have accomplished, he declined\r\nto do so, because he considered himself bound in honour to remain\r\ntwenty days after the treaty. The consequence was, that Charles was\r\ntaken prisoner by Cobbett, and carried to Hurst castle.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this painful tragedy is well known. After the _purified_\r\nhouse of commons had passed a vote declaring that it was high treason\r\nin the king of England, for the time being, to levy war against the\r\nparliament and kingdom of England, his majesty was brought to trial\r\nbefore a tribunal erected _pro re nata_ by the house called the high\r\ncourt of justice, which adjudged him “as a tyrant, traitor, murderer,\r\nand public enemy to the good people of the nation, to be put to death\r\nby the severing of his head from his body,” a sentence which was\r\ncarried into execution, in front of Whitehall, on the 30th of January\r\n1649. The unfortunate monarch conducted himself throughout the whole\r\nof these melancholy proceedings with becoming dignity, and braved the\r\nterrors of death with fortitude and resignation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Hamilton, who, by his incapacity, had ruined the king’s\r\naffairs when on the point of being retrieved, was not destined long\r\nto survive his royal master. In violation of the articles of his\r\ncapitulation, he was brought to trial, and although he pleaded that\r\nhe acted under the orders of the Scottish parliament, and was not\r\namenable to an English tribunal, he was, under the pretence that\r\nhe was Earl of Cambridge in England, sentenced to be beheaded. He\r\nsuffered on the 9th of March.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly had languished in prison since December 1647,\r\nand during the life of the king the Scottish parliament had not\r\nventured to bring him to the block; but both the king and Hamilton,\r\nhis favourite, being now put out of the way, they felt themselves no\r\nlonger under restraint, and accordingly the parliament, on the 16th\r\nof March, ordained the marquis to be beheaded, at the market-cross\r\nof Edinburgh, on the 22d of that month. As he lay under sentence\r\nof ecclesiastical excommunication, one of the “bloody ministers,”\r\nsays the author of the History of the family of Gordon, “asked him,\r\nwhen brought upon the scaffold, if he desired to be absolved from\r\nthe sentence;” to which the marquis replied, “that as he was not\r\naccustomed to give ear to false prophets, he did not wish to be\r\ntroubled by him.” And thereupon turning “towards the people, he told\r\nthem that he was going to die for having employed some years of his\r\nlife in the service of the king his master; that he was sorry he\r\nwas not the first of his majesty’s subjects who had suffered for\r\nhis cause, so glorious in itself that it sweetened to him all the\r\nbitterness of death.” He then declared that he had charity to forgive\r\nthose who had voted for his death, although he could not admit that\r\nhe had done any thing contrary to the laws. After throwing off his\r\ndoublet, he offered up a prayer, and then embracing some friends\r\naround him, he submitted his neck, without any symptoms of emotion,\r\nto the fatal instrument.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[336] _History of the Family of Gordon_, vol. ii. p. 495. _Britane’s\r\nDistemper_, p. 166.\r\n\r\n[337] _Memoirs_, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[338] This report fortunately appears to be belied by the following\r\nentries in Balfour’s Annals, 17th and 19th January, 1646. “The earl\r\nof Tulliebardine humbly petitions the House that they would be\r\npleased to pardon his brother, William Murray’s life, in respect\r\nhe averred on his honour, that he was not _compos mentis_, as also\r\nwithin age.” “The earl of Tulliebardine again this day gave in a\r\nhumble petition to the House for prolonging the execution of that\r\nsentence pronounced against his brother.” Vol. iii. pp. 362, 363.\r\n\r\n[339] Wishart p. 223.\r\n\r\n[340] Wishart, p. 227.\r\n\r\n[341] Guthry, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[342] Balfour, vol. iii. pp. 311, 312.\r\n\r\n[343] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 323.\r\n\r\n[344] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 325.\r\n\r\n[345] Ibid. p. 341.\r\n\r\n[346] Balfour, vol. iii. pp. 356-61.\r\n\r\n[347] Wishart, p. 238; Guthry, p. 168.\r\n\r\n[348] Life prefixed to Sir Robert’s work, entitled _Practicks_,\r\nfolio, printed in 1706.\r\n\r\n[349] Wishart, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[350] Guthry, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[351] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 531.\r\n\r\n[352] _Britane’s Distemper_, p. 182.\r\n\r\n[353] Lingard, vol. vi. p. 539, 4to.\r\n\r\n[354] Lingard, vol. vi. p. 543.\r\n\r\n[355] Kirkton.\r\n\r\n[356] Rushworth, vi.\r\n\r\n[357] Wishart, p. 262.\r\n\r\n[358] June 15, 1646.\r\n\r\n[359] July 16, 1646.\r\n\r\n[360] Guthry, p. 179.\r\n\r\n[361] Wishart, pp. 264-5.\r\n\r\n[362] Wishart.\r\n\r\n[363] Lingard, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n[364] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 536.\r\n\r\n[365] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 537.\r\n\r\n[366] Guthry.\r\n\r\n[367] _Britane’s Distemper_, p. 200.\r\n\r\n[368] Turner’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[369] Turner’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[370] Guthry.\r\n\r\n[371] Spalding says that Col Kittoch came out of the castle to treat\r\nfor a surrender on an assurance of personal safety.\r\n\r\n[372] Gordon’s _History of the Family of Gordon_, vol. ii. p. 546.\r\n\r\n[373] Guthry, p. 207.\r\n\r\n[374] See the Act of Sederunt of the committee in the appendix to\r\nGordon’s _History of the family of Gordon_, vol. ii. p. 537.\r\n\r\n[375] Baillie.\r\n\r\n[376] Guthry.\r\n\r\n[377] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 541.\r\n\r\n[378] _Memoirs_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n[379] Guthry, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[380] _Memoirs_, p. 316.\r\n\r\n[381] Guthry.\r\n\r\n[382] Appendix to Evelyn’s _Memoirs_, vol. ii. pp. 128, 390.\r\nClarendon, vol. iii. p. 234.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1649-1650.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, 1649-1660; including Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell,\r\n1653-1658.\r\n\r\n  Negotiations with Charles II.--Proceedings of Montrose\r\n  --Pluscardine’s Insurrection--Landing of Kinnoul and Montrose\r\n  in Orkney--Montrose’s Declaration--Montrose advances southwards\r\n  --Is defeated at Carbisdale--Montrose captured and sent to\r\n  Edinburgh--His reception there--Trial and Execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the dominant party in England were contemplating the erection\r\nof a commonwealth upon the ruins of the monarchy they had just\r\noverthrown, the faction in Scotland, with Argyle at its head, which\r\nhad usurped the reins of government in that country, in obedience to\r\nthe known wish of the nation, resolved to recognise the principle of\r\nlegitimacy by acknowledging the Prince of Wales as successor to the\r\ncrown of Scotland. No sooner, therefore, had the intelligence of the\r\nexecution of the king reached Edinburgh, than the usual preparations\r\nwere made for proclaiming Charles II., a ceremony which was performed\r\nat the market-cross of Edinburgh, on the 5th of February, with the\r\nusual formalities.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding was contrary to the policy of Argyle, whose\r\nintentions were in exact accordance with those of the English\r\nIndependents; but, as the melancholy fate of the king had excited\r\na feeling of indignation in the Scottish nation, he was afraid to\r\nimitate the example of his English friends, and dissembling his\r\nviews, adopted other measures without changing his object. At the\r\ninstigation of Argyle it was agreed in parliament to propose certain\r\nconditions to the prince as the terms on which alone he should be\r\nentitled to sway the sceptre of his father. These were, in substance,\r\n1st, that he should sign the Covenants, and endeavour to establish\r\nthem by his authority in all his dominions; 2d, that he should\r\nratify and confirm all the acts of the Estates, approving of the two\r\nCovenants, the directory, confession of faith, and the catechism,\r\nthat he should renounce episcopacy and adopt the presbyterian form\r\nof worship; 3d, that in all civil matters he should submit to the\r\nparliament, and in things ecclesiastical to the authority of the\r\ngeneral assembly; and, _lastly_, that he should remove from his\r\nperson and court the Marquis of Montrose, “a person excommunicated by\r\nthe church, and forfaulted by the parliament of Scotland, being a man\r\nmost justly, if ever any, cast out of the church of God.”\r\n\r\nThese conditions, so flattering to popular prejudice and the\r\nprevailing ideas of the times, appear to have been proposed only\r\nbecause Argyle thought they would be rejected by the youthful\r\nmonarch, surrounded as he then was by counsellors to whom these\r\nterms would be particularly obnoxious. To carry these propositions\r\nto Charles II., then at the Hague, seven commissioners from the\r\nparliament and kirk were appointed, who set sail from Kirkcaldy roads\r\non the 17th of March,[383] arriving at the Hague on the 26th. His\r\ncourt, which at first consisted of the few persons whom his father\r\nhad placed about him, had been lately increased by the arrival of\r\nthe Earl of Lanark, now become, by the death of his brother, Duke\r\nof Hamilton, the Earls of Lauderdale and Callander, the heads of\r\nthe Engagers; and by the subsequent addition of Montrose, Kinnoul,\r\nand Seaforth. The following graphic sketch is given by Dr. Wishart\r\nof the appearance and reception of the commissioners:--“When these\r\ncommissioners, or deputies from the Estates were admitted to their\r\nfirst audience of the king, their solemn gait, their grave dress,\r\nand dejected countenances, had all the appearance imaginable of\r\nhumility; and many who were not acquainted with the temper and\r\npractices of the men, from thence concluded that they were about\r\nto implore of his majesty a general oblivion and pardon for what\r\nwas past, and to promise a perfect obedience and submission in time\r\ncoming; and that they were ready to yield every thing that was just\r\nand reasonable, and would be sincere in all their proposals of\r\npeace and accommodation. They acted in a double capacity, and had\r\ninstructions both from the Estates and from the commission of the\r\nkirk, in both of which the Earl of Cassilis was the chief person,\r\nnot only in what they were charged with from the Estates, as being\r\na nobleman, but also from the commission of the kirk, of which\r\nhe was a ruling elder. Their address to the king was introduced\r\nwith abundance of deep sighs and heavy groans, as if they had been\r\nlabouring, as Virgil says of the Sibyl, to shake the ponderous load\r\nfrom off their breasts, after which they at last exhibited their\r\npapers, containing the ordinances of the Estates, and acts of the\r\ncommission of the kirk, and pretended that the terms demanded in them\r\nwere moderate, just, and reasonable, and absolutely necessary for\r\nsettling the present confusions, and restoring the king; with which,\r\nif he complied, he would be immediately settled upon his father’s\r\nthrone by the unanimous consent of the people.”[384]\r\n\r\nThe king, after vainly endeavouring to induce the commissioners to\r\nmodify the conditions to which his acceptance was required, and to\r\ndeclare publicly their opinions of the murder of his father, to which\r\nthey had made no allusion, declined to agree to the terms proposed.\r\nHe at the same time stated, that as he had been already proclaimed\r\nking of Scotland by the Committee of Estates, it was their duty to\r\nobey him, and that he should expect the Committee of Estates, the\r\nassembly of the kirk, and the nation at large, to perform their duty\r\nto him, humbly obeying, maintaining, and defending him as their\r\nlawful sovereign.[385] The commissioners having got their answer\r\non the 19th of May, returned to Scotland, and Charles went to St.\r\nGermain in France, to visit Queen Henrietta Maria, his mother, before\r\ngoing to Ireland, whither he had been invited by the Marquis of\r\nOrmond to join the royalist army.\r\n\r\nDuring the captivity of Charles I., Montrose used every exertion at\r\nthe court of France to raise money and men to enable him to make\r\na descent upon the coast of England or Scotland, to rescue his\r\nsovereign from confinement; but his endeavours proving ineffectual,\r\nhe entered into the service of the Emperor of Germany, who honoured\r\nhim with especial marks of his esteem. He had been lately residing\r\nat Brussels engaged in the affairs of the emperor, where he received\r\nletters from the Prince of Wales, then at the Hague, requiring his\r\nattendance to consult on the state of his father’s affairs; but\r\nbefore he set out for the Hague, he received the news of the death\r\nof Charles I. He was so overwhelmed with grief at this intelligence,\r\nthat according to Bishop Wishart, who was an eye-witness, he fainted\r\nand fell down in the midst of his attendants, and appeared for some\r\ntime as if quite dead. When he had sufficiently recovered to give\r\nfull vent to his feelings, he expressed a desire to die with his\r\nsovereign, as he could no longer enjoy, as he said, a life which had\r\nnow become a grievous and heavy burden. But on Wishart remonstrating\r\nwith him upon the impropriety of entertaining such a sentiment, and\r\ninforming him that he should be rather more desirous of life that he\r\nmight avenge the death of his royal master, and place his son and\r\nlawful successor upon the throne of his ancestors, Montrose replied\r\nwith composure, that in that view he should be satisfied to live;\r\n“but,” continued he, “I swear before God, angels, and men, that I\r\nwill dedicate the remainder of my life to the avenging the death\r\nof the royal martyr, and re-establishing his son upon his father’s\r\nthrone.”\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Hague, Montrose was received by Charles II.\r\nwith marked distinction. After some consultation, a descent upon\r\nScotland was resolved upon, and Montrose, thereupon, received a\r\ncommission, appointing him Lieutenant-governor of Scotland, and\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the forces there both by sea and land. The\r\nking also appointed him his ambassador to the emperor, the princes\r\nof Germany, the King of Denmark, and other friendly sovereigns,\r\nto solicit supplies of money and warlike stores, to enable him to\r\ncommence the war. Thus, before the commissioners had arrived, the\r\nking had made up his mind as to the course he should pursue, and\r\nbeing backed by the opinion of a man of such an ardent temperament\r\nas Montrose, the result of the communing between the king and the\r\ncommissioners was as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nConnected probably with Montrose’s plan of a descent, a rising took\r\nplace in the north under Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine, brother\r\nof the Earl of Seaforth, Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, Colonel\r\nJohn Munro of Lumlair, and Colonel Hugh Fraser, who, at the head\r\nof a number of their friends and followers, entered the town of\r\nInverness, on the 22d of February, expelled the troops from the\r\ngarrison, and demolished and razed the walls and fortifications of\r\nthe town. The pretext put forward by Mackenzie and his friends was,\r\nthat the parliament had sent private commissioners to apprehend\r\nthem; but the fact appears to be, that this insurrection had taken\r\nplace at the instigation of the king, between whom and Pluscardine\r\na correspondence had been previously opened.[386] General David\r\nLeslie was sent to the north with a force to suppress the insurgents,\r\nwho, on his approach, fled to the mountains of Ross; but he was\r\nsoon obliged to retrace his steps, in consequence of a rising in\r\nAthole under the direction of Lord Ogilvie, General Middleton, and\r\nothers, in favour of the king. Leslie had previously made terms with\r\nUrquhart, Munro, and Fraser, but as Mackenzie would not listen to\r\nany accommodation, he left behind him a garrison in the castle of\r\nChanonry, and also three troops of horse in Moray under the charge of\r\nColonel Gilbert Ker, and Lieutenant-colonels Hacket and Strachan, to\r\nwatch Pluscardine’s motions. But this force was quite insufficient to\r\nresist Pluscardine, who, on the departure of Leslie, descended from\r\nthe mountains and attacked the castle of Chanonry, which he re-took.\r\nHe was thereupon joined by his nephew, Lord Reay, at the head of 300\r\nwell-armed able-bodied men, which increased his force to between 800\r\nand 900.\r\n\r\nHaving suppressed the rising in Athole, Leslie was again sent north\r\nby the parliament, accompanied by the Earl of Sutherland; but he\r\nhad not proceeded far, when he ascertained that Mackenzie had been\r\ninduced by Lord Ogilvie and General Middleton, who had lately joined\r\nhim, to advance southward into Badenoch, with the view of raising\r\nthe people in that and the neighbouring districts, and that they had\r\nbeen there joined by the young Marquis of Huntly, formerly Lord Lewis\r\nGordon, and had taken the castle of Ruthven. Leslie thereupon divided\r\nhis army, with one part of which he himself entered Badenoch, while\r\nhe despatched the Earl of Sutherland to the north to collect forces\r\nin Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, with another part, consisting\r\nof five troops of horse, under the command of Ker, Hacket, and\r\nStrachan. To hinder the royalists from retiring into Athole, Leslie\r\nmarched southward towards Glenesk, by which movement he compelled\r\nthem to leave Badenoch and to march down Spey-side towards Balveny.\r\nOn arriving at Balveny, they resolved to enter into a negotiation\r\nwith Leslie, and accordingly Pluscardine and Middleton left Balveny\r\nwith a troop of horse to meet Leslie, leaving Huntly, Reay, and\r\nOgilvie, in charge of the forces, the former of whom sent his brother\r\nLord Charles Gordon to the Enzie, to raise some horse.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the return of Pluscardine and Middleton, the party\r\nat Balveny had not the slightest idea that they might be taken\r\nby surprise; but on the 8th of May at day-break, they were most\r\nunexpectedly attacked by the horse which had been sent north with\r\nthe Earl of Sutherland, and which, returning from Ross, had speedily\r\ncrossed the Spey. Seizing the royalist sentinels, they surprised\r\nLord Reay at the castle of Balveny, where he and about 900 foot were\r\ntaken prisoners and about 80 killed. Huntly and Ogilvie, who had\r\ntheir quarters at the church of Mortlach, about a mile from Balveny\r\ncastle, escaped. Colonel Ker at once dismissed all the prisoners to\r\ntheir own homes on giving their oaths not to take up arms against the\r\nparliament in time coming. He sent Lord Reay along with some of his\r\nkinsmen and friends and Mackenzie of Redcastle and other prisoners\r\nof his surname to Edinburgh; all of whom were imprisoned. Huntly,\r\nOgilvie, Pluscardine, and Middleton, on giving security to keep the\r\npeace, were forgiven by Leslie and returned to their homes. Colonel\r\nKer afterwards returned to Ross, took Redcastle, which he demolished,\r\nand hanged the persons who had defended it. Thus ended this premature\r\ninsurrection which, had it been delayed till the arrival of Montrose,\r\nmight have been attended with a very different result.[387]\r\n\r\nThe projected descent by Montrose upon Scotland, was considered by\r\nmany persons as a desperate measure, which none but those quite\r\nreckless of consequences would attempt; but there were others,\r\nchiefly among the ultra-royalists, who viewed the affair in a\r\ndifferent light, and who, although they considered the enterprise\r\nas one not without considerable risk, anticipated its success. Such,\r\nat least, were the sentiments of some of the king’s friends before\r\nthe insurrection under Mackenzie of Pluscardine had been crushed;\r\nbut it is very probable that these were greatly altered after its\r\nsuppression. The failure of Pluscardine’s ill-timed attempt was\r\nindeed considered by Montrose as a great misfortune, but a misfortune\r\nfar from irreparable, and as he had invitations from the royalist\r\nnobility of Scotland, requesting him to enter upon his enterprise,\r\nand promising him every assistance in their power, and as he was\r\nassured that the great body of the Scottish nation was ready to\r\nsecond his views, he entered upon the task assigned him by his royal\r\nmaster, with an alacrity and willingness which indicated a confidence\r\non his part of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the powers he had received from the king, Montrose\r\nvisited the north of Europe, and obtained promises of assistance\r\nof men, money, and ammunition, from some of the northern princes;\r\nbut few of them fulfilled their engagements in consequence of the\r\nintrigues of the king’s enemies with the courtiers, who thwarted\r\nwith all their influence the measures of Montrose. By the most\r\nindefatigable industry and perseverance, however, he collected a\r\nforce of 1,200 men at Gottenburg, about 800 of whom had been raised\r\nin Holstein and Hamburg, and having received from the Queen of Sweden\r\n1,500 complete stands of arms, for arming such persons as might join\r\nhis standard on landing in Scotland, he resolved, without loss of\r\ntime, to send off this armament to the Orkneys, where, in consequence\r\nof a previous arrangement with the Earl of Morton, who was\r\nfavourable to the king, it was agreed that a descent should be made.\r\nAccordingly, the first division of the expedition, which consisted of\r\nthree parts, was despatched early in September; but it never reached\r\nits destination, the vessels having foundered at sea in a storm. The\r\nsecond division was more fortunate, and arrived at Kirkwall, about\r\nthe end of the month. It consisted of 200 common soldiers and 80\r\nofficers, under the command of the Earl of Kinnoul, who on landing\r\nwas joined by his uncle the Earl of Morton and by many of the Orkney\r\ngentlemen. Kinnoul immediately laid siege to the castle of Birsay,\r\nwhich was soon surrendered to him; and he proceeded to raise levies\r\namong the Orcadians, but was checked in his progress in consequence\r\nof a difference with Morton, who claimed the privilege, as superior\r\nof Orkney, of commanding his own vassals, a claim which Kinnoul would\r\nnot allow. Morton felt the repulse keenly, and died soon thereafter\r\nof a broken heart, as is believed. His nephew, perhaps hurt at the\r\ntreatment he had given his uncle, speedily followed him to the grave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General David Leslie.]\r\n\r\nThe news of Kinnoul’s landing reached Edinburgh about the 14th of\r\nOctober, when General David Leslie was despatched to the north with\r\nseven or eight troops of horse to watch him if he attempted to cross\r\nthe Pentland Frith; but seeing no appearance of an enemy, and hearing\r\nof intended commotions among the royalists in Angus and the Mearns,\r\nhe returned to the south after an absence of fifteen days,[388]\r\nhaving previously placed strong garrisons in some of the northern\r\nstrengths.[389]\r\n\r\nMontrose himself, with the remainder of the expedition, still\r\ntarried at Gottenburg, in the expectation of obtaining additional\r\nreinforcements or of procuring supplies of arms and money. It appears\r\nfrom a letter[390] which he addressed to the Earl of Seaforth, of\r\nthe date of 15th December, that he intended to sail for Scotland\r\nthe following day; but owing to various causes he did not leave\r\nGottenburg till about the end of February 1650. He landed in Orkney\r\nin the beginning of March, with a force of 500 men, accompanied by\r\nLord Frendraught, Major General Hurry, and other gentlemen who had\r\nattached themselves to his service and fortunes.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the minds of the people of Scotland for the enterprise\r\nhe was about to undertake, Montrose, about the close of the year,\r\nhad circulated a “Declaration” in Scotland, as “Lieutenant-governor\r\nand Captain-general for his Majesty of the Kingdom of Scotland,”\r\nin which, after detailing the proceedings of those whom he termed\r\n“an horrid and infamous faction of rebels within the kingdom of\r\nScotland,” towards his late majesty, he declared that his present\r\nmajesty was not only willing to pardon every one, with the exception\r\nof those who upon clear evidence should be found guilty “of that most\r\ndamnable fact of murder of his father,” provided that immediately\r\nor upon the first convenient occasion, they abandoned the rebels\r\nand joined him, and therefore, he expected all persons who had “any\r\nduty left them to God, their king, country, friends, homes, wives,\r\nchildren, or would change now at last the tyranny, violence, and\r\noppression of those rebels, with the mild and innocent government\r\nof their just prince, or revenge the horrid and execrable murdering\r\nof their sacred king, redeem their nation from infamy, restore the\r\npresent and oblige the ages to come, would join themselves with him\r\nin the service he was about to engage.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration which, by order of the Committee of Estates, was\r\npublicly burnt at the market cross of Edinburgh, by the hands of the\r\ncommon hangman, was answered on the 2d of January, by a “declaration\r\nand warning of the commission of the General Assembly,” addressed\r\nto “all the members of the kirk and kingdom,” which was followed\r\non the 24th of the same month, by another “declaration” from the\r\nCommittee of Estates of the parliament of Scotland, in vindication\r\nof their proceedings from “the aspersions of a scandalous pamphlet,\r\npublished by that excommunicate traitor, James Graham, under the\r\ntitle of a ‘Declaration of James, Marquis of Montrose.’” The last of\r\nthese documents vindicates at great length, and apparently with great\r\nsuccess, those whom Montrose had designated the “infamous faction\r\nof rebels,” not because the committee thought “it worth the while\r\nto answer the slanders and groundless reproaches of that viperous\r\nbrood of Satan, James Graham, whom the Estates of parliament had\r\nlong since declared traitor, the church delivered into the hands\r\nof the devil, and the nation doth generally detest and abhor;” but\r\nbecause “their silence might be subject to misconstruction, and some\r\nof the weaker sort might be inveigled by the bold assertions and\r\nrailing accusations of this impudent braggard, presenting himself\r\nto the view of the world clothed with his majesty’s authority, as\r\nlieutenant-governor and captain-general of this kingdom.” These\r\ndeclarations of the kirk and Estates, backed as they were by\r\nfulminations from all the pulpits of the kingdom against Montrose,\r\nmade a deep impression on men’s minds, highly unfavourable to him;\r\nand as the Committee of Estates discharged all persons from aiding\r\nor assisting him under the pain of high treason, and as every action\r\nand word of those considered friendly to him were strictly watched,\r\nthey did not attempt, and had they attempted, would have found it\r\nimpossible, to make any preparations to receive him on his arrival.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of matters when Montrose landed in Orkney,\r\nwhere, in consequence of the death of Morton and Kinnoul, little\r\nprogress had been made in raising troops. He remained several weeks\r\nin Orkney, without exciting much notice, and having collected about\r\n800 of the natives, which, with the addition of the 200 troops\r\ncarried over by Kinnoul, made his whole force amount to about 1,500\r\nmen, he crossed the Pentland Frith in a number of boats collected\r\namong the islands, and landed without opposition at the northern\r\nextremity of Caithness, in the immediate vicinity of John o’Groat’s\r\nhouse. On landing, he displayed three banners, one of which was\r\nmade of black taffeta, in the centre of which was exhibited a\r\nrepresentation of the bleeding head of the late king, as struck off\r\nfrom the body, surrounded by two inscriptions, “Judge and avenge my\r\ncause, O Lord,” and “Deo et victricibus armis.” Another standard\r\nhad this motto, “Quos pietas virtus et honor fecit amicus.” These\r\ntwo banners were those of the king. The third, which was Montrose’s\r\nown, bore the words, “Nil medium,” a motto strongly significant of\r\nthe uncompromising character of the man.[391] Montrose immediately\r\ncompelled the inhabitants of Caithness to swear obedience to him as\r\nthe king’s lieutenant-governor. All the ministers, with the exception\r\nof one named William Smith, took the oath, and to punish Smith for\r\nhis disobedience, he was sent in irons on board a vessel.[392] A\r\nnumber of the inhabitants, however, alarmed at the arrival of foreign\r\ntroops, with whose presence they considered carnage and murder to be\r\nassociated, were seized with a panic and fled, nor did some of them\r\nstop till they reached Edinburgh, where they carried the alarming\r\nintelligence of Montrose’s advance to the parliament which was then\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Earl of Sutherland heard of Montrose’s arrival in\r\nCaithness, he assembled all his countrymen to oppose his advance\r\ninto Sutherland. He sent, at the same time, for two troops of horse\r\nstationed in Ross, to assist him, but their officers being in\r\nEdinburgh, they refused to obey, as they had received no orders.\r\nBeing apprized of the earl’s movements, and anticipating that he\r\nmight secure the important pass of the Ord, and thus prevent him from\r\nentering Sutherland, Montrose despatched a body of 500 men to the\r\nsouth, who obtained possession of the pass. The next step Montrose\r\ntook, was against the castle of Dunbeath, belonging to Sir John\r\nSinclair, who, on Montrose’s arrival, had fled and left the place\r\nin charge of his lady. The castle was strong and well supplied with\r\nprovisions, and the possession of it was considered very important\r\nby Montrose, in case he should be obliged to retreat into Orkney. The\r\ncastle, which was defended by Sir John’s lady and a few servants,\r\nsurrendered to General Hurry, after a short resistance, on condition\r\nthat persons and property should be respected. Hurry put a strong\r\ngarrison in the castle, under the command of Major Whiteford.\r\n\r\nHaving secured this important strength, Montrose marched into\r\nSutherland, leaving Henry Graham, his natural brother, behind him\r\nwith a party to raise men for the service. While in Caithness, the\r\nonly persons that proffered their services to Montrose, were Hucheon\r\nMackay of Skoury, Hugh Mackay of Dirlet, and Alexander Sinclair of\r\nBrims, whom he despatched to Strathnaver, to collect forces, but they\r\nappear to have neglected the matter. On the approach of Montrose,\r\nthe Earl of Sutherland, not conceiving himself in a condition to\r\nresist, retired with his men, and putting strong garrisons into\r\nDunrobin, Skelbo, Skibo, and Dornoch, and sending off a party with\r\ncattle and effects to the hills to be out of the reach of the enemy,\r\nhe went himself into Ross with 300 of his men. Montrose continued to\r\nadvance, and encamped the first night at Garty and Helmsdale, the\r\nsecond at Kintredwell, and the third night at Rhives. In passing by\r\nDunrobin, a part of his men went between the castle and the sea, some\r\nof whom were killed, and others taken prisoners, in a sortie from\r\nthe garrison. On the following day, Montrose demanded the prisoners\r\nfrom William Gordon the commander of Dunrobin, but his request\r\nwas refused. Montrose encamped at Rian in Strathfleet the fourth\r\nnight, at Gruidy on the fifth, and at Strathoikel on the sixth. He\r\nthen marched to Carbisdale, on the borders of Ross-shire, where he\r\nhalted a few days in expectation of being joined by the Mackenzies.\r\nWhile reposing here in fancied security and calculating on complete\r\nsuccess, he sent a notification to the Earl of Sutherland to the\r\neffect, that though he had spared his lands for the present, yet the\r\ntime was at hand when he would make his own neighbours undo him.\r\nLittle did Montrose then imagine that his own fate was so near at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as intelligence of Montrose’s descent was received in\r\nEdinburgh, the most active preparations were made to send north\r\ntroops to meet him. David Leslie, the commander-in-chief, appointed\r\nBrechin as the place of rendezvous for the troops; but as a\r\nconsiderable time would necessarily elapse before they could be\r\nall collected, and as apprehensions were entertained that Montrose\r\nmight speedily penetrate into the heart of the Highlands, where he\r\ncould not fail to find auxiliaries, Lieutenant-Colonel Strachan, an\r\nofficer who had been particularly active in suppressing Pluscardine’s\r\ninsurrection, was despatched, in the meantime, to the north with a\r\nfew troops of horse, for the purpose of keeping Montrose in check,\r\nand enabling the Earl of Sutherland, and the other presbyterian\r\nleaders in the north to raise their levies. These troops, which\r\nwere those of Ker, Hacket, Montgomery, and Strachan, and an Irish\r\ntroop commanded by one Collace, were joined by a body of about 500\r\nfoot under the Earl of Sutherland, Ross of Balnagown, and Munro of\r\nLumlair, all of whom were assembled at Tain when Montrose encamped\r\nat Strathoikel. This movement brought the hostile parties within\r\ntwenty miles of each other, but Montrose was not aware that his enemy\r\nwas so near at hand. Strachan, who had early intelligence brought\r\nhim of Montrose’s advance, immediately called a council of war to\r\ndeliberate, at which it was resolved that the Earl of Sutherland\r\nshould, by a circuitous movement, throw himself into Montrose’s rear,\r\nin order to prevent a junction between him and Henry Graham, and\r\nsuch of the Strathnaver and Caithness men as should attempt to join\r\nhim. It was resolved that, at the same time, Strachan with his five\r\ntroops of horse, and the Munroes, and Rosses, under Balnagown, and\r\nLumlair, should march directly forward and attack Montrose in the\r\nlevel country before he should, as was contemplated, retire to the\r\nhills on the approach of Leslie, who was hastening rapidly north with\r\na force of 4,000 horse and foot, at the rate of thirty miles a-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUTHERLAND OR 93^D. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday the 27th of April, when Strachan’s officers were\r\ndeliberating whether they should move immediately forward or wait\r\ntill Monday, “and so decline the hazard of engaging upon the Lord’s\r\nday,”[393] when notice being brought that Montrose had advanced from\r\nStrathoikel to Carbisdale, a movement which brought him six miles\r\nnearer to them, they made arrangements for attacking him without\r\ndelay. Strachan advanced without observation as far as Fearn, within\r\na mile and a half or two miles of Montrose, where he concealed\r\nhis men on a moor covered with broom, whence he sent out a party\r\nof scouts under Captain Andrew Munro, son of Munro of Lumlair, to\r\nreconnoitre Montrose. Munro soon returned and reported that Montrose\r\nhad sent out a body of 40 horse to ascertain their movements. In\r\norder to deceive this body, Strachan ordered one troop of horse out\r\nof the broom, which being the only force observed by Montrose’s\r\nscouts, they returned and reported to Montrose what they had seen.\r\nThis intelligence threw Montrose completely off his guard, who,\r\nconceiving that the whole strength of the enemy consisted of a single\r\ntroop of horse, made no preparations for defending himself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Strachan formed his men into four divisions. The\r\nfirst, which consisted of about 100 horsemen, he commanded himself;\r\nthe second, amounting to upwards of 80, was given in charge to\r\nHacket; and the third, also horse, to the number of about 40, was led\r\nby Captain Hutcheson. The fourth division, which was composed of a\r\nbody of musketeers belonging to Lawer’s regiment, was commanded by\r\none Quarter-master Shaw.[394]\r\n\r\nThe deception which had been so well practised upon Montrose by\r\nStrachan, in concealing the real amount of his force, might not have\r\nbeen attended with any serious effect to Montrose, but for another\r\nstratagem which Strachan had in reserve, and which proved Montrose’s\r\nruin. Strachan’s scheme was first to advance with his own division\r\nto make it appear as if his whole strength consisted of only 100\r\nhorse, and while Montrose was impressed with this false idea, to\r\nbring up the other three divisions in rapid succession, and thus\r\ncreate a panic among Montrose’s men as if a large army were about\r\nto attack them. This contrivance was crowned with the most complete\r\nsuccess. Montrose little suspecting the trick, was thrown quite off\r\nhis guard, and alarmed at the sudden appearance of successive bodies\r\nof cavalry, he immediately gave orders for a retreat to a wood and\r\ncraggy hill at a short distance in his rear; but before Montrose’s\r\nmen could reach their intended place of retreat, they were overtaken\r\nwhen almost breathless, by Strachan’s troopers, who charged them\r\nviolently. The foreign troops received the charge with firmness, and,\r\nafter discharging a volley upon the horse, flew into the wood; but\r\nmost of the Orcadians threw down their arms in terror and begged for\r\nquarter. The Munroes and Rosses followed the Danish troops into the\r\nwood and killed many of them. 200 of the fugitives in attempting to\r\ncross the adjoining river were drowned.\r\n\r\nMontrose for some time made an unavailing effort to rally some of his\r\nmen, and fought with his accustomed bravery; but having his horse\r\nshot under him, and seeing it utterly impossible longer to resist the\r\nenemy, he mounted the horse of Lord Frendraught, which that young\r\nand generous nobleman proffered him, and galloped off the field; and\r\nas soon as he got out of the reach of the enemy, he dismounted, and\r\nthrowing away his cloak, which was decorated with the star of the\r\ngarter, and his sword, sought his safety on foot.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of Montrose’s men continued about two hours, or until\r\nsunset, during which time ten of his best officers and 386 common\r\nsoldiers were killed. The most conspicuous among the former for\r\nbravery was Menzies younger of Pitfoddles, the bearer of the black\r\nstandard, who repeatedly refused to receive quarter. Upwards of 400\r\nprisoners were taken, including 31 officers, among whom were Sir\r\nJohn Hurry and Lord Frendraught, the latter of whom was severely\r\nwounded. Among the prisoners taken were two ministers. This victory\r\nwas achieved almost without bloodshed on the part of the victors,\r\nwho had only two men wounded, and one trooper drowned. After the\r\nslaughter, the conquerors returned thanks to God on the open field\r\nfor the victory they had obtained, and returned to Tain, carrying\r\nthe prisoners along with them.[395] For several days the people of\r\nRoss and Sutherland continued to pursue some unfortunate stragglers,\r\nwhom they despatched. The result was most calamitous to Orkney, as\r\nappears from a petition and memorandum by the gentlemen of Orkney to\r\nLord Morton in 1662, in which it is stated, that there was scarcely\r\na gentleman’s house in that country “but lost either a son or a\r\nbrother.”[396]\r\n\r\nMontrose, accompanied by the Earl of Kinnoul, who had lately\r\nsucceeded to the title on the death of his brother, and six or seven\r\ncompanions, having, as before stated, dismounted from his horse\r\nand thrown away his cloak and sword, and having, by the advice of\r\nhis friends, to avoid detection, exchanged his clothes for the\r\nmore homely attire of a common Highlander, wandered all night and\r\nthe two following days among bleak and solitary regions, without\r\nknowing where to proceed, and ready to perish under the accumulated\r\ndistresses of hunger, fatigue, and anxiety of mind. The Earl of\r\nKinnoul, unable, from exhaustion, to follow Montrose any farther,\r\nwas left among the mountains, where it is supposed he perished. When\r\nupon the point of starvation, Montrose was fortunate to light upon a\r\nsmall cottage, where he obtained a supply of milk and bread,[397] on\r\nreceiving which he continued his lonely and dangerous course among\r\nthe mountains of Sutherland, at the risk of being seized every hour,\r\nand dragged as a felon before the very man whom, only a few days\r\nbefore, he had threatened with his vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, active search was made after Montrose. As it was\r\nconjectured that he might attempt to reach Caithness, where his\r\nnatural brother, Henry Graham, still remained with some troops in\r\npossession of the castle of Dunbeath, and as it appeared probable,\r\nfrom the direction Montrose was supposed to have taken, that he meant\r\nto go through Assynt, Captain Andrew Munro sent instructions to\r\nNeil Macleod, the laird of Assynt, his brother-in-law, to apprehend\r\nevery stranger that might enter his bounds, in the hope of catching\r\nMontrose, for whose apprehension a splendid reward was offered. In\r\nconsequence of these instructions, Macleod sent out various parties\r\nin quest of Montrose, but they could not fall in with him. “At\r\nlast,” says Bishop Wishart, “the laird of Assynt being abroad in arms\r\nwith some of his tenants in search of him, lighted on him in a place\r\nwhere he had continued three or four days without meat or drink, and\r\nonly one man in his company.” The bishop then states, that “Assynt\r\nhad formerly been one of Montrose’s own followers; who immediately\r\nknowing him, and believing to find friendship at his hands, willingly\r\ndiscovered himself; but Assynt not daring to conceal him, and being\r\ngreedy of the reward which was promised to the person who should\r\napprehend him by the Council of the Estates, immediately seized and\r\ndisarmed him.”[398] This account differs a little from that of the\r\nauthor of the continuation of Sir Robert Gordon’s history, who,\r\nhowever, it must be remembered, represents the Earl of Sutherland and\r\nhis friends in as favourable a light as possible. Gordon says, that\r\nit was one of Macleod’s parties that apprehended Montrose, and is\r\naltogether silent as to Assynt’s having been his follower; but both\r\nwriters inform us that Montrose offered Macleod a large sum of money\r\nfor his liberty, which he refused to grant. Macleod kept Montrose\r\nand his companion, Major Sinclair, an Orkney gentleman, prisoners\r\nin the castle of Ardvraick, his principal residence. By order of\r\nLeslie, Montrose was thence removed to Skibo castle, where he was\r\nkept two nights, thereafter to the castle of Braan, and thence again\r\nto Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn his progress to the capital, Montrose had to endure all those\r\nindignities which vulgar minds, instigated by malevolence and\r\nfanaticism, could suggest; but he bore every insult with perfect\r\ncomposure. At a short interview which he had with two of his children\r\nat the house of the Earl of South Esk, his father-in-law, on his\r\nway to Edinburgh, he exhibited the same composure, for “neither at\r\nmeeting nor parting could any change of his former countenance be\r\ndiscerned, or the least expression heard which was not suitable to\r\nthe greatness of his spirit, and the fame of his former actions. His\r\nbehaviour was, during the whole journey, such as became a great man;\r\nhis countenance was serene and cheerful, as one who was superior to\r\nall those reproaches which they had prepared the people to pour out\r\nupon him in all the places through which he was to pass.”[399]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle of Ardvraick.]\r\n\r\nAt Dundee, which had particularly suffered from his army, a very\r\ndifferent feeling was shown by the inhabitants, who displayed a\r\ngenerosity of feeling and a sympathy for fallen greatness, which\r\ndid them immortal honour. Instead of insulting the fallen hero in\r\nhis distress, they commiserated his misfortunes, and prevailed upon\r\nhis guards to permit him to exchange the rustic and mean apparel in\r\nwhich he had been apprehended, and which, to excite the derision\r\nof the mob, they had compelled him to wear, for a more becoming\r\ndress which had been provided for him by the people of Dundee. The\r\nsensibilities of the inhabitants had probably been awakened by a\r\nbold and ineffectual attempt to rescue Montrose, made by the lady\r\nof the laird of Grange, at whose house, in the neighbourhood of\r\nDundee, he had passed the previous night. The author of the Memoirs\r\nof the Somervilles gives the following characteristic account of this\r\naffair:--\r\n\r\n“It was at this ladye’s house that that party of the Covenanters\r\ntheir standing armie, that gairded in the Marques of Montrose,\r\nefter his forces was beat and himself betrayed in the north, lodged\r\nhim, whom this excellent lady designed to sett at libertie, by\r\nprocureing his escape from her house; in order to this, soe soon as\r\nther quarters was settled, and that she had observed the way and\r\nmanner of the placeing of the guairds, and what officers commanded\r\nthem, she not only ordered her butlers to let the souldiers want for\r\nnoe drink, but she herself, out of respect and kyndnesse, as she\r\npretended, plyed hard the officers and souldiers of the main-guaird,\r\n(which was keeped in her owne hall) with the strongest ale and\r\nacquavite, that before midnight, all of them, (being for the most\r\npart Highlandmen of Lawer’s regiment) became starke drunke. If her\r\nstewarts and other servants had obeyed her directions in giving out\r\nwhat drinke the out-gairds should have called for, undoubtedly the\r\nbusiness had been effectuat; but unhappily, when the marques had\r\npassed the first and second centinells that was sleeping upon their\r\nmusquets, and likewayes through the main-gaird, that was lying in\r\nthe hall lyke swyne on a midding, he was challenged a little without\r\nthe outmost guaird by a wretched trouper of Strachan’s troupe, that\r\nhad been present at his taking. This fellow was none of the guaird\r\nthat night, but being quartered hard by, was come rammelling in\r\nfor his bellieful of drinke, when he made this unluckie discovery,\r\nwhich being done, the marques was presently seized upon, and with\r\nmuch rudenesse (being in the ladye’s cloaths which he had put on for\r\na disguize) turned back to his prisone chamber. The lady, her old\r\nhusband, with the wholl servants of the house, were made prisoners\r\nfor that night, and the morrow efter, when they came to be challenged\r\nbefore these that had the command of this party, and some members of\r\nthat wretched Committee of Estates, that satt allways at Edinbrough\r\n(for mischief to the royall interest,) which they had sent for the\r\nmore security, to be still with this party, fearing the great friends\r\nand weill-wishers this noble heroe had upon the way he was to come,\r\nshould either by force or stratageme, be taken from them. The ladie,\r\nas she had been the only contryver of Montrose’s escape, soe did she\r\navow the same before them all; testifying she was heartily sorry it\r\nhad not taken effect according to her wished desyre. This confidence\r\nof hers, as it bred some admiratione in her accusors, soe it freed\r\nher husband and the servants from being farder challenged; only they\r\ntook security of the laird for his ladye’s appearing before the\r\nCommittie of Estates when called, which she never was. Ther worships\r\ngott something else to thinke upon, then to conveen soe excellent\r\na lady before them upon such ane account, as tended greatly to her\r\nhonour and ther oune shame.”\r\n\r\nThe parliament, which had been adjourned till the 15th of May, met\r\non the appointed day, and named a committee to devise the mode of\r\nhis reception into the capital and the manner of his death. In terms\r\nof the committee’s report an act was passed on the 17th of May,\r\nordaining “James Graham” to be conveyed bareheaded from the Water\r\nGate (the eastern extremity of the city) on a cart, to which he was\r\nto be tied with a rope, and drawn by the hangman in his livery,\r\nwith his hat on, to the jail of Edinburgh, and thence to be brought\r\nto the parliament house, and there on his knees to receive sentence\r\nof death. It was resolved that he should be hanged on a gibbet at\r\nthe cross of Edinburgh, with the book which contained the history of\r\nhis wars and the declaration which he had issued, tied to his neck,\r\nand after hanging for the space of three hours, that his body should\r\nbe cut down by the hangman, his head severed from his body, fixed\r\non an iron spike, and placed on the pinnacle on the west end of the\r\nprison; that his hands and legs should also be cut off, the former\r\nto be placed over the gates of Perth and Stirling, and the latter\r\nover those of Aberdeen and Glasgow; that if at his death he showed\r\nany signs of repentance, and should in consequence be relieved from\r\nthe sentence of excommunication which the kirk had pronounced against\r\nhim, that the trunk of his body should be interred by “pioneers” in\r\nthe Gray Friars’ churchyard; but otherwise, that it should be buried\r\nby the hangman’s assistants, under the scaffold on the Boroughmuir,\r\nthe usual place of execution.[400]\r\n\r\nThe minds of the populace had, at this time, been wrought up to the\r\nhighest pitch of hatred at Montrose by the ministers, who, during a\r\nfast which had lately been held in thanksgiving for his apprehension,\r\nhad launched the most dreadful and bloody invectives against him, and\r\nto this circumstance perhaps is to be attributed the ignominious plan\r\ndevised for his reception.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the passing of the act, Montrose was brought up\r\nfrom Leith, mounted on an outworn horse, to the Water Gate, along\r\nwith 23 of his officers, his fellow-prisoners, where he was met about\r\nfour o’clock, P.M., by the magistrates of the city in their robes,\r\nfollowed by the “town guard,” and the common executioner. Having\r\nbeen delivered by his guards to the civic authorities, whose duty it\r\nnow was to take charge of his person, Montrose was, for the first\r\ntime, made acquainted with the fate which awaited him, by one of the\r\nmagistrates putting a copy of the sentence into his hands. He perused\r\nthe paper with composure, and after he had read it he informed\r\nthe magistrates that he was ready to submit to his fate, and only\r\nregretted, “that through him the king’s majesty, whose person he\r\nrepresented, should be so much dishonoured.”[401]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Montrose (his signature)\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT MARQUIS OF MONTROSE.\r\n\r\nFrom a rare contemporary print in possession of W. F. Watson Esq^r.\r\nEdin^r.]\r\n\r\nBefore mounting the vehicle brought for his reception, Montrose was\r\nordered by the hangman to uncover his head; but as the mandate was\r\nnot immediately attended to, that abhorred instrument of the law\r\nenforced his command with his own hands. He thereupon made Montrose\r\ngo into the cart, and placing him on a high chair fixed upon a\r\nsmall platform raised at the end of the cart, he pinioned his arms\r\nclose to his sides by means of cords, which being passed across his\r\nbreast, and fastened behind the vehicle, kept him so firmly fixed as\r\nto render his body immoveable. The other prisoners, who were tied\r\ntogether in pairs, having been marshalled in front of the cart in\r\nwalking order and uncovered, the hangman, clothed in his official\r\nattire, mounted one of the horses[402] attached to the cart, and the\r\nprocession thereupon moved off at a slow pace up the Canongate, in\r\npresence of thousands of spectators, who lined the long street, and\r\nfilled the windows of the adjoining houses. Among the crowd which\r\nthronged the street to view the mournful spectacle was a great number\r\nof the inferior classes of the community, chiefly females, who had\r\ncome with the determined intention of venting abuse upon the fallen\r\nhero, and pelting him, as he proceeded along the street, with dirt,\r\nstones, and other missiles, incited thereto by the harangues of the\r\nministers on occasion of the late fast; but they were so overawed\r\nby the dignity of his demeanour, and the undaunted courage of soul\r\nwhich he displayed, that their feelings were at once overcome, and\r\ninstead of covering him with reproaches, they dissolved into tears of\r\npity at the sight of fallen greatness, and invoked the blessings of\r\nheaven upon the head of the illustrious captive. A result so totally\r\nunlooked-for, could not be but exceedingly displeasing to the enemies\r\nof Montrose, and particularly to the ministers, who, on the following\r\nday (Sunday), denounced the conduct of the people from the pulpits\r\nof the city, and threatened them with the wrath of heaven.\r\n\r\nBut displeasing as the humane reception of Montrose was to the\r\nclergy, it must have been much more mortifying to Argyle, his mortal\r\nenemy, who, contrary to modern notions of decency and good feeling,\r\nsurrounded by his family and the marriage party of his newly-wedded\r\nson, Lord Lorn, appeared publicly on a balcony in front of the\r\nEarl of Moray’s house[403] in the Canongate, from which he beheld\r\nundaunted the great Montrose, powerless now to do him personal harm.\r\nTo add to the insult, either accidentally or on purpose, the vehicle\r\nwhich carried Montrose was stopped for some time beneath the place\r\nwhere Argyle and his party stood, so that they were able to take a\r\nleisurely view of the object of their hate and fear, and it would\r\nappear that they took advantage of their fallen foe’s position to\r\nindulge in unseemly demonstrations of triumph and insult. For the\r\nsake of humanity and the honour of tender-hearted woman, we would\r\nfain disbelieve the statement that the Marchioness of Argyle had the\r\neffrontery to vent her hatred toward the fallen enemy of her house by\r\nspitting upon him. Whatever were the inward workings of Montrose’s\r\nsoul, he betrayed no symptoms of inquietude, but preserved, during\r\nthis trying scene, a dignified demeanour which is said to have\r\nconsiderably discomposed his triumphant rival and his friends.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance from the Water Gate to the prison was only\r\nabout half a mile, yet so slow had the procession moved, that it\r\nwas almost seven o’clock in the evening before it reached the\r\nprison. When released from the cart Montrose gave the hangman some\r\nmoney for his services in having driven so well his “triumphal\r\nchariot,”[404] as he jocularly termed the cart. On being lodged in\r\njail, he was immediately visited by a small committee appointed\r\nby the parliament, which had held an extraordinary meeting at\r\nsix o’clock in the evening. Balfour says, that the object of the\r\ncommittee, which consisted of three members and two ministers, was to\r\nask “James Grahame if he had any thing to say, and to show him that\r\nhe was to repair to the house to receive his sentence.” The house\r\nremained sitting till the return of the deputation, who reported\r\nthat Montrose had refused to answer any of the questions put to him\r\ntill he was informed upon what terms they stood with the king, and\r\nwhether they had concluded any agreement with him. In consequence\r\nof this information, the parliament delayed passing sentence till\r\nMonday the 20th of May; and, in the meantime, appointed seven of\r\ntheir members to wait upon the marquis and examine him on some points\r\nrespecting “Duke Hamilton and others;” and to induce him to answer,\r\nthe deputation was instructed to inform him, that an agreement had\r\nbeen concluded between the commissioners on the part of the estates\r\nand his majesty, who was coming to Scotland.[405] Montrose, however,\r\nexcused himself from annoyance by stating, that as his journey had\r\nbeen long, and as “the ceremony and compliment they had paid him\r\nthat day had been somewhat wearisome and tedious,” he required\r\nrepose;[406] in consequence of which the deputation left him.\r\n\r\nMontrose meant to have spent the whole of the following day, being\r\nSunday, in devotional exercises suitable to his trying situation;\r\nbut he was denied this consolation by the incessant intrusions of\r\nthe ministers and members of parliament, who annoyed him by asking a\r\nvariety of ensnaring questions, which he having refused to answer,\r\nthey gave vent to the foulest reproaches against him. These insults,\r\nhowever, had no effect on him, nor did he show the least symptoms\r\nof impatience, but carried himself throughout with a firmness which\r\nno menaces could shake. When he broke silence at last, he said that\r\n“they were much mistaken if they imagined that they had affronted\r\nhim by carrying him in a vile cart the day before; for he esteemed\r\nit the most honourable and cheerful journey he had ever performed\r\nin his life; his most merciful God and Redeemer having all the\r\nwhile manifested his presence to him in a most comfortable and\r\ninexpressible manner, and supplied him by his divine grace, with\r\nresolution and constancy to overlook the reproaches of men, and to\r\nbehold him alone for whose cause he suffered.”[407]\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the order of parliament, Montrose was brought up by\r\nthe magistrates of Edinburgh on Monday at ten o’clock forenoon to\r\nreceive sentence. As if to give dignity and importance to the cause\r\nfor which he was about to suffer, and to show how indifferent he was\r\nto his own fate, Montrose appeared at the bar of the parliament in a\r\nsuperb dress which he had provided for the purpose, after his arrival\r\nin Edinburgh. His small clothes consisted of a rich suit of black\r\nsilk, covered with costly silver lace, over which he wore a scarlet\r\nrochet which reached to his knee, and which was trimmed with silver\r\ngalloons, and lined with crimson taffeta. He also wore silk stockings\r\nof a carnation colour, with garters, roses and corresponding\r\nornaments, and a beaver hat having a very rich silver band.[408]\r\n\r\nHaving ascended “the place of delinquents,” a platform on which\r\ncriminals received sentence, Montrose surveyed the scene before him\r\nwith his wonted composure, and though his countenance was rather\r\npale, and exhibited other symptoms of care, his firmness never for a\r\nmoment forsook him. Twice indeed was he observed to heave a sigh and\r\nto roll his eyes along the house,[409] during the virulent invectives\r\nwhich the lord-chancellor (Loudon) poured out upon him, but these\r\nemotions were only the indications of the warmth of his feelings\r\nwhile suffering under reproaches which he could not resent.\r\n\r\nThe lord-chancellor, in rising to address Montrose, entered into\r\na long detail of his “rebellions,” as he designated the warlike\r\nactions of Montrose, who, he said, had invaded his native country\r\nwith hostile arms, and had called in Irish rebels and foreigners to\r\nhis assistance. He then reproached Montrose with having broken not\r\nonly the national covenant, which he had bound himself to support,\r\nbut also the solemn league and covenant, to which the whole nation\r\nhad sworn; and he concluded by informing Montrose, that for the many\r\nmurders, treasons, and impieties of which he had been guilty, God had\r\nnow brought him to suffer condign punishment. After the chancellor\r\nhad concluded his harangue, Montrose requested permission to say a\r\nfew words in his own vindication, which being granted, though not\r\nwithout some difficulty, he proceeded to vindicate his conduct,\r\nshowing that it was the result of sincere patriotism and devoted\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\n“He had,” he said, “not spilt any blood, not even that of his most\r\ninveterate enemies, but in the field of battle; and that even in the\r\ngreatest heat of action he had preserved the lives of many thousands;\r\nand that as he had first taken up arms at the command of the king,\r\nhe had laid them down upon his orders, without any regard to his own\r\ninterest, and had retired beyond the seas.\r\n\r\n“With regard to his late invasion, he said, he had undertaken it at\r\nthe command and by the express orders of the present king, (to whom\r\nthey all owed duty and allegiance, and for whose long and happy reign\r\nhe offered his sincere and earnest prayers,) in order to accelerate\r\nthe treaty which was then begun betwixt him and them--that it was his\r\nintention, as soon as the treaty had been concluded, to lay down arms\r\nand retire at the call of his majesty; and such being his authority\r\nand determination, he might justly affirm, that no subject ever\r\nacted upon more honourable grounds, nor by a more lawful power and\r\nauthority than he had done in the late expedition.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, he called upon the assemblage to lay aside all\r\nprejudice, private animosity, and desire of revenge, and to consider\r\nhim, in relation to the justice of his cause, as a man and a\r\nChristian, and an obedient subject, in relation to the commands of\r\nhis sovereign, which he had faithfully executed. He then put them in\r\nmind of the great obligations which many of them were under to him,\r\nfor having preserved their lives and fortunes at a time when he had\r\nthe power and authority, had he inclined, of destroying both, and\r\nentreated them not to judge him rashly, but according to the laws of\r\nGod, the laws of nature and nations, and particularly by the laws of\r\nthe land--that if they should refuse to do so, he would appeal to\r\nthe just Judge of the world, who would at last judge them all, and\r\npronounce a righteous sentence.”[410]\r\n\r\nThis speech was delivered without affectation or embarrassment, and\r\nwith such firmness and clearness of intonation, that, according to\r\na cavalier historian, many persons present were afterwards heard to\r\ndeclare, that he looked and spoke as he had been accustomed when at\r\nthe head of his army.[411] The chancellor replied to Montrose, in a\r\nstrain of the most furious invective, “punctually proving him,” says\r\nBalfour, “by his acts of hostility, to be a person most infamous,\r\nperjured, treacherous, and of all that this land ever brought forth,\r\nthe most creuell and inhumane butcher and murtherer of his natione,\r\na sworne enimy to the Covenant and peace of his countrey, and one\r\nquhosse boundlesse pryde and ambition had lost the father, and by\r\nhis wicked counsells done quhat in him lay to distroy the sone\r\nlykwayes.”[412]\r\n\r\nMontrose attempted to address the court a second time, but was rudely\r\ninterrupted by the chancellor, who ordered him to keep silence, and\r\nto kneel down and receive his sentence. The prisoner at once obeyed,\r\nbut remarked, that on falling on his knees, he meant only to honour\r\nthe king his master, and not the parliament. While Sir Archibald\r\nJohnston, the clerk-register, was reading the sentence, Montrose kept\r\nhis countenance erect and displayed his usual firmness. “He behaved\r\nall this time in the house with a great deal of courage and modesty,\r\nunmoved and undaunted.”[413] The execution was fixed for three\r\no’clock the following day.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of humanity and the voice of religion, now demanded that\r\nthe unfortunate prisoner should be allowed to spend the short time\r\nhe had to live, in those solemn preparations for death, enjoined\r\nby religion, in privacy and without molestation; but it was his\r\nfate to be in the hands of men in whose breasts such feelings were\r\nstifled, and whose religion was deeply imbued with a stern and\r\ngloomy fanaticism, to which charity was an entire stranger. However,\r\nit would be unfair and uncharitable to look upon the conduct of\r\nthese men as if they had been surrounded with all the advantages\r\nof the present enlightened age. We ought to bear in mind their\r\nrecent escape from the most intolerant of all religions, of whose\r\npersecuting principles they had not yet got rid; the hard treatment\r\nto which they had been subjected by the late king and his father;\r\nand the fact that they really believed they were doing their duty\r\nto God and serving the best interests of true religion. It is\r\nindeed difficult to be charitable to the uncharitable, tolerant to\r\npersecutors.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Montrose returned to prison, than he was again assailed\r\nby the ministers, who endeavoured to induce him to submit to the\r\nkirk, no doubt considering the conversion of such an extraordinary\r\n_malignant_ as Montrose, as a theological achievement of the first\r\nimportance. To subdue his obstinacy, they magnified the power of the\r\nkeys, which they said had been committed to them, and informed him\r\nthat unless he reconciled himself to the kirk and obtained a release\r\nfrom the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced\r\nagainst him, he would be eternally damned. But Montrose, regardless\r\nof their threats and denunciations, remained inflexible. Besides the\r\nministers, he was frequently waited upon by the magistrates of the\r\ncity, with whom he entered into conversation. He told them that he\r\nwas much indebted to the parliament for the great honour they had\r\ndecreed him,--that he was prouder to have his head fixed upon the top\r\nof the prison, than if they had decreed a golden statue to be erected\r\nto him in the market-place, or ordered his portrait to be placed in\r\nthe king’s bed-chamber,--that so far from grieving for the mutilation\r\nwhich his body was about to undergo, he was happy that the parliament\r\nhad taken such an effectual method of preserving the memory of his\r\nloyalty, by transmitting such proofs of them to the four principal\r\ncities of the kingdom, and he only wished that he had flesh enough\r\nto have sent a piece to every city in Christendom, as a testimony\r\nof his unshaken love and fidelity to his king and country.[414] But\r\nannoying as the visits of the ministers and magistrates undoubtedly\r\nwere, Montrose was still farther doomed to undergo the humiliation\r\nof being placed under the more immediate charge of Major Weir, who\r\nafterwards obtained an infamous notoriety in the annals of criminal\r\njurisprudence. This incestuous wretch, who laid claim to superior\r\ngodliness, and who pretended to be gifted with the spirit of prayer,\r\nof which he gave proofs by many extemporary effusions, gave Montrose\r\ngreat uneasiness by smoking tobacco, to the smell of which he had,\r\nlike Charles I., a particular aversion.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, when free from the intrusion of the ministers,\r\nMontrose occupied himself in devotional exercises, and even found\r\nleisure to gratify his poetic taste, by composing the following\r\nlines which he wrote upon the window of the chamber in which he was\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\n      “Let them bestow on every airth a limb,\r\n      Then open all my veins, that I may swim\r\n      To thee, my Maker, in that crimson lake,\r\n      Then place my parboiled head upon a stake;\r\n      Scatter my ashes, strow them in the air.\r\n      Lord, since thou knowest where all these atoms are,\r\n      I’m hopeful thou’lt recover once my dust,\r\n      And confident thou’lt raise me with the just.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st of May, 1650, the city of Edinburgh was\r\nput into a state of commotion by the noise of drums and trumpets,\r\nwhich was heard in every quarter of the city. The sound attracted\r\nthe notice of Montrose, who inquired at the captain of the guard\r\nthe cause of it. The officer told him that the parliament, dreading\r\nthat an attempt might be made by the mob, under the influence of the\r\nmalignants, to rescue him, had given orders to call out the soldiers\r\nand citizens to arms. “Do I,” said the marquis, “who was such a\r\nterror to these good men when alive, continue still so formidable to\r\nthem, now that I am about to die? But let them look to themselves;\r\nfor even after I am dead, I will be continually present to their\r\nwicked consciences, and become more formidable to them than while I\r\nwas alive.”\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of a hearty breakfast, Montrose entered upon the\r\nbusiness of the toilet, to which he paid particular attention. While\r\nin the act of combing his hair, he was visited by Sir Archibald\r\nJohnston, the clerk-register, one of his most inveterate foes, who\r\nmade some remarks on the impropriety, as he thought, of a person in\r\nthe dreadful situation of the marquis, occupying some of the precious\r\nmoments he had yet to live in frivolous attentions to his person.\r\nThe marquis, who knew well the character of this morose man, thus\r\naddressed him with a smile of contempt, “While my head is my own, I\r\nwill dress and adorn it; but to-morrow, when it becomes yours, you\r\nmay treat it as you please.”\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before the time fixed for his execution, Montrose was\r\nwaited upon by the magistrates of the city, who saw him conveyed to\r\nthe scaffold on the same vehicle on which he had been carried into\r\nthe city. In addition to the dress which he wore on that occasion, he\r\nwas now habited in a superb scarlet cloak, ornamented with gold and\r\nsilver lace, which his friends had provided him with. Long before his\r\nremoval from prison, an immense assemblage of persons had congregated\r\naround the place of execution in the High-street, all of whom were\r\ndeeply affected on Montrose’s appearance. As he proceeded along, he\r\nhad, says Wishart, “such a grand air, and so much beauty, majesty,\r\nand gravity appeared in his countenance, as shocked the whole city at\r\nthe cruelty that was designed him; and extorted even from his enemies\r\nthis unwilling confession, that he was a man of the most lofty and\r\nelevated soul, and of the most unshaken constancy and resolution that\r\nthe age had produced.”\r\n\r\nIt had always been the uniform practice in Scotland to permit all\r\npersons about to suffer the last penalty of the law to address the\r\nassembled spectators, and on mounting the scaffold Montrose was\r\nproceeding to avail himself of this privilege; but the magistrates,\r\nwho probably had received their instructions from the parliament,\r\nrefused to allow him to harangue the multitude. His friends, however,\r\nanticipating this, had hired a young man, skilled in stenography,\r\nwho, having stationed himself near the scaffold, was enabled to take\r\ndown the substance of some observations which Montrose was permitted\r\nto make in answer to questions put by some persons who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nHe began by remarking that he would consider it extremely hard\r\nindeed if the mode of his death should be esteemed any reflection\r\nupon him, or prove offensive to any good Christian, seeing that such\r\noccurrences often happened to the good at the hands of the wicked,\r\nand often to the wicked at the hands of the good--and that just men\r\nsometimes perish in their righteousness, while wicked men prosper in\r\ntheir villanies. That he, therefore, expected that those who knew\r\nhim well would not esteem him the less for his present sufferings,\r\nespecially as many greater and more deserving men than he had\r\nundergone the same untimely and disgraceful fate. Yet, that he could\r\nnot but acknowledge that all the judgments of God were just, and that\r\nthe punishment he was about to suffer was very deservedly inflicted\r\nupon him for the many private sins he had committed, and he therefore\r\nwillingly submitted to it;--that he freely pardoned his enemies, whom\r\nhe reckoned but the instruments of the Divine will, and prayed to God\r\nto forgive them, although they had oppressed the poor, and perverted\r\njudgment and justice.\r\n\r\nThat he had done nothing contrary to the laws of the kingdom, and\r\nthat he had undertaken nothing but in obedience to the just commands\r\nof his sovereign, when reduced to the greatest difficulties by his\r\nrebellious subjects, who had risen up in arms against him--that his\r\nprincipal study had always been to fear God and honour the king,\r\nin a manner agreeable to the law of God, the laws of nature, and\r\nthose of his own country; and that, in neither of these respects,\r\nhad he transgressed against men, but against God alone, with whom\r\nhe expected to find abundant mercy, and in the confidence of which,\r\nhe was ready to approach the eternal throne without terror--that\r\nhe could not pretend to foretell what might happen, or to pry into\r\nthe secrets of Divine Providence; but he prayed to God that the\r\nindignities and cruelties which he was that day to suffer might\r\nnot be a prelude of still greater miseries which would befall his\r\nafflicted country, which was fast hastening to ruin.\r\n\r\nThat with regard to the grievous censure of the church, which he was\r\nsorry some good people thought it a crime in him to die under, he\r\nobserved, that he did not incur it from any fault of his own, but in\r\nthe performance of his duty to his lawful prince, for the security\r\nof religion, and the preservation of his sacred person and royal\r\nauthority--that the sentence of excommunication, so rashly laid upon\r\nhim by the clergy, gave him much concern, and that he earnestly\r\ndesired to be released from it, so far as that could be done,\r\nagreeably to the laws of God, and without hurting his conscience or\r\nallegiance, which, if they refused, he appealed to God, the righteous\r\njudge of the world, who, ere long, was to be his impartial judge and\r\ngracious redeemer.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the reproaches of some persons who had endeavoured to\r\ndestroy the marquis’s character and reputation by spreading a report\r\nthat he had laid the whole blame of what he had done upon the king\r\nand his royal father, he observed that such a thought had never once\r\nentered into his breast--that the late king had lived a saint and\r\ndied a martyr, and he prayed to God, that as his own fate was not\r\nunlike his, so his death might be attended with the same degree of\r\npiety and resignation; for if he could wish his soul in another man’s\r\nstead, or to be conjoined with it in the same condition after this\r\nlife, it would be his alone.\r\n\r\nHe then requested that the people would judge charitably of him\r\nand his actions, without prejudice and without passion. He desired\r\nthe prayers of all good men for his soul; for his part, he said he\r\nprayed earnestly for them all; and with the greatest seriousness,\r\nsubmission and humility, deprecated the vengeance of Almighty God,\r\nwhich had been so long awakened, and which was still impending over\r\nhis afflicted country--that his enemies were at liberty to exult\r\nand triumph over the perishing remains of his body, but the utmost\r\nindignities they could inflict should never prevail on him, now\r\nat his death, to swerve from that duty and reverence to God, and\r\nobedience and respect to the king, which he had manifested all his\r\nlife long. “I can say no more,” concluded the marquis, “but remit\r\nmyself to your charity, and I desire your prayers. You that are\r\nscandalized at me, give me your charity; I shall pray for you all.\r\nI leave my soul to God, my service to my prince, my goodwill to my\r\nfriends, and my name in charity to you all. I might say more, but I\r\nhave exonered my conscience; the rest I leave to God’s mercy.”[415]\r\n\r\nA party of ministers who occupied the lower end of the scaffold now\r\nattempted, partly by persuasion and partly by threats, to induce\r\nMontrose to yield to the kirk by acknowledging his own criminality;\r\nbut he denied that he had acted contrary to religion and the laws of\r\nthe land, and, of course, refused to accept of a reconciliation upon\r\nsuch terms. Finding him inflexible, they refused to pray for him as\r\nhe desired, observing, that no prayers could be of any avail to a man\r\nwho was an outcast from the church of God. Being desired to pray by\r\nhimself apart, he told them that if they would not permit the people\r\nto join with him, his prayers alone and separately before so large an\r\nassembly would perhaps be offensive both to them and him--that he had\r\nalready poured out his soul before God, who knew his heart, and to\r\nwhom he had committed his spirit. He then shut his eyes, and holding\r\nhis hat before his face with his left hand, he raised his right in\r\nthe attitude of prayer, in which posture he continued about a quarter\r\nof an hour in silent and fervent prayer.\r\n\r\nAs the fatal hour was fast approaching when this unfortunate\r\nnobleman was to bid a last adieu to sublunary things, he desired the\r\nexecutioner to hasten his preparations. This gloomy functionary,\r\naccordingly, brought the book of Montrose’s wars, and his late\r\ndeclaration, which, by the sentence, were ordered to be tied round\r\nhis neck with a cord. Montrose himself assisted in carrying this\r\npart of his sentence into execution, and while the operation was\r\nperforming, good-humouredly remarked, that he considered himself as\r\nmuch honoured then by having such tokens of his loyalty attached to\r\nhis person as he had been when his majesty had invested him with the\r\norder of the garter.[416]\r\n\r\nHitherto, Montrose had remained uncovered; but, before ascending the\r\nladder that conducted to the top of the gibbet, which rose to the\r\nheight of thirty feet from the centre of the scaffold, he requested\r\npermission to put on his hat. This request was, however, refused.\r\nHe then asked leave to keep on his cloak; but this favour was also\r\ndenied him. Irritated, probably at these refusals, he appears for a\r\nmoment to have lost his usual equanimity of temper, and when orders\r\nwere given to pinion his arms, he told the magistrates that if they\r\ncould invent any further marks of ignominy, he was ready to endure\r\nthem all for the sake of the cause for which he suffered.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the top of the ladder, which he ascended with\r\nastonishing firmness, Montrose asked the executioner how long his\r\nbody was to be suspended to the gibbet. “Three hours,” was the\r\nanswer. He then presented the executioner with three or four pieces\r\nof gold, told him he freely forgave him for the part he acted, and\r\ninstructed him to throw him off as soon as he observed him uplifting\r\nhis hands. The executioner watched the fatal signal, and on the\r\nnoble victim raising his hands, obeyed the mandate, and, it is\r\nsaid, burst into tears. A feeling of horror seized the assembled\r\nmultitude, who expressed their disapprobation by a general groan.\r\nAmong the spectators were many persons who had indulged during the\r\nday in bitter invectives against Montrose, but whose feelings were\r\nso overpowered by the sad spectacle of his death that they could not\r\nrefrain from tears.[417] Even the relentless Argyle, who had good\r\nfeeling enough to absent himself from the execution, is said to have\r\nshed tears on hearing of Montrose’s death, but if a cavalier writer\r\nis to be believed, his son, Lord Lorne, disgraced himself by the most\r\nunfeeling barbarity.[418]\r\n\r\nThus died, at the early age of thirty-eight, James Graham, Marquis of\r\nMontrose, who had acquired during a short career of military glory\r\ngreater reputation than perhaps ever fell to the lot of any commander\r\nwithin the same compass of time. That partisans may have exaggerated\r\nhis actions, and extolled his character too highly, may be fairly\r\nadmitted; but it cannot be denied that Montrose was really a great\r\ncommander, and that there were noble and generous traits about him\r\nwhich indicated a high and cultivated mind, in many respects far\r\nsuperior to the age in which he lived. But however much the military\r\nexploits of Montrose may be admired, it must never be forgotten that\r\nhis sword was drawn against his own countrymen in their struggles\r\nagainst arbitrary power, and that although there was much to condemn\r\nin the conduct of the Covenanters, subsequent events, in the reign of\r\nthe second Charles and James, showed that they were not mistaken in\r\nthe dread which they entertained of the extinction of their religious\r\nliberties, had Charles I. succeeded in his designs.\r\n\r\nAmong Montrose’s officers five of the most distinguished were\r\nselected for execution, all of whom perished under ‘the Maiden,’\r\na species of guillotine, introduced into Scotland by the Regent\r\nMorton, to which he himself became the first victim. The officers\r\nwho suffered were Sir John Hurry,[419] Captain Spottiswood, younger\r\nof Dairsie, Sir Francis Hay of Dalgetty, Colonel William Sibbald,\r\nand Captain Charteris, a cadet of the ancient family of Amisfield.\r\nAll these met death with extraordinary fortitude. Sir Francis\r\nHay, who was a Catholic, “and therefore,” as a cavalier historian\r\nquaintly observes, “not coming within the compass of the ministers’\r\nprayers,”[420] displayed in particular an intrepidity worthy of his\r\nname and family.[421] After a witty metaphorical allusion to “the\r\nMaiden,” he kissed the fatal instrument, and kneeling down, laid his\r\nhead upon the block. Colonel Sibbald exhibited a surprising gaiety,\r\nand, “with an undaunted behaviour, marched up to the block, as if he\r\nhad been to act the part of a gallant in a play.”[422] An instance\r\nof the unfeeling levity with which such melancholy scenes were\r\nwitnessed, even by those who considered themselves the ministers of\r\nthe gospel, occurred on the present as on former occasions. Captain\r\nSpottiswood, grandson of the archbishop of that name, having on his\r\nknees said the following prayer:--“O Lord, who hath been graciously\r\npleased to bring me through the wilderness of this world, I trust\r\nat this time you will waft me over this sea of blood to my heavenly\r\nCanaan;” was rebuked by a minister who was near him in the following\r\nwords:--“Take tent (heed), take tent, sir, that you drown not by the\r\ngate!” (way). Spottiswood replied with great modesty that “he hoped\r\nhe was no Egyptian,” an answer which forced the base intruder to\r\nretire among the crowd to conceal his shame.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Captain Charteris (the last who suffered) was a\r\nsource of melancholy regret to his friends, and of triumph to the\r\nministers. He was a man of determined mind; but his health being\r\nmuch impaired by wounds which he had received, he had not firmness to\r\nresist the importunities of his friends, who, as a means of saving\r\nhis life, as they thought, prevailed upon him to agree to make a\r\npublic declaration of his errors. This unhappy man, accordingly, when\r\non the scaffold, read a long speech, which had been prepared for him\r\nby the ministers, penned in a peculiarly mournful strain, in which\r\nhe lamented his apostacy from the Covenant, and acknowledged “other\r\nthings which he had vented to them (the ministers) in _auricular\r\nconfession_.”[423] Yet, notwithstanding the expectations which he and\r\nhis friends were led to entertain that his life would be spared, he\r\nhad no sooner finished his speech than he was despatched.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[383] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 393.\r\n\r\n[384] _Memoirs_, p. 351.\r\n\r\n[385] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 405.\r\n\r\n[386] See Appendix to Wishart’s _Memoirs_, p. 440.\r\n\r\n[387] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 547, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[388] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 432.\r\n\r\n[389] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 551.\r\n\r\n[390] Appendix to Wishart’s _Memoirs_, p. 441.\r\n\r\n[391] Balfour, vol. iii. p. 440.\r\n\r\n[392] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 552.\r\n\r\n[393] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 9.\r\n\r\n[394] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 9.\r\n\r\n[395] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 555.\r\n\r\n[396] Vide the document in the Appendix to Peterkin’s Notes on Orkney\r\nand Zetland, pp. 106, 107.\r\n\r\n[397] Gordon’s _Continuation_, p. 555.\r\n\r\n[398] _Memoirs_, p. 377.\r\n\r\n[399] _Memoirs_, p. 380.\r\n\r\n[400] Balfour, vol. iv. pp. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n[401] Wishart, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[402] According to _Montrose Redivivus_, p. 181, the cart was drawn\r\nby four horses.\r\n\r\n[403] Now the Free Church Normal School.\r\n\r\n[404] Wishart, p. 386.\r\n\r\n[405] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 14.\r\n\r\n[406] Wishart, p. 386.\r\n\r\n[407] Wishart, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[408] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 16, note to Kirkton’s _Church History_, p.\r\n124. _Relation of the execution of James Graham_, London, 1650.\r\n\r\n[409] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[410] Wishart, p. 391.\r\n\r\n[411] Monteith’s _Hist. of the Troubles_, &c., p. 514.\r\n\r\n[412] _Annals_, vol. iv. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[413] Idem, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[414] Wishart, p. 393.\r\n\r\n[415] Wishart, p. 399.

The same enthusiasm spread quickly throughout the\r\nkingdom, and his majesty was welcomed with warm congratulations as he\r\nproceeded on his journey towards Falkland, which had been fixed upon\r\nby parliament as the place of his residence. The pleasure he received\r\nfrom these professions of loyalty was, however, not without alloy,\r\nas he was obliged, at the request of the parliament, to dismiss from\r\nhis presence some of his best friends, both Scotch and English,\r\nparticularly the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Lauderdale, and\r\nother “engagers,” who, by an act passed on the 4th of June against\r\n“classed delinquents,” were debarred from returning to the kingdom,\r\nor remaining therein, “without the express warrant of the Estates\r\nof parliament.”[424] Of the English exiles the Duke of Buckingham,\r\nLord Wilmot, and seven gentlemen of the household were allowed to\r\nremain with him.[425] In fact, with these exceptions, every person\r\neven suspected of being a “malignant,” was carefully excluded from\r\nthe court, and his majesty was thus surrounded by the heads of the\r\nCovenanters and the clergy. These last scarcely ever left his person,\r\nwatched his words and motions, and inflicted upon him long harangues,\r\nin which he was often reminded of the misfortunes of his family.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the English commonwealth, aware of the negotiations\r\nwhich had been going on between the young king and the Scots\r\ncommissioners in Holland, became apprehensive of their own stability,\r\nshould a union take place between the Covenanters and the English\r\nPresbyterians, to support the cause of the king, and they therefore\r\nresolved to invade Scotland, and by reducing it to their authority\r\nextinguish for ever the hopes of the king and his party. Fairfax\r\nwas appointed commander-in-chief, and Cromwell lieutenant-general of\r\nthe army destined for this purpose; but as Fairfax considered the\r\ninvasion of Scotland as a violation of the solemn league and covenant\r\nwhich he had sworn to observe, he refused, notwithstanding the most\r\nurgent entreaties, to accept the command, which in consequence\r\ndevolved upon Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe preparations making in England for the invasion of Scotland were\r\nmet with corresponding activity in Scotland, the parliament of which\r\nordered an army of 30,000 men to be immediately raised to maintain\r\nthe independence of the country. The nominal command of this army was\r\ngiven to the Earl of Leven, who had become old and infirm; but David\r\nLeslie his relative, was in reality the commander. The levies went on\r\nwith considerable rapidity, but before they were assembled Cromwell\r\ncrossed the Tweed on the 22d of July at the head of 16,000 well\r\nappointed and highly disciplined troops. On his march from Berwick\r\nto Musselburgh a scene of desolation was presented to the eyes of\r\nCromwell, far surpassing anything he had ever before witnessed. With\r\nthe exception of a few old women and children, not a human being was\r\nto be seen, and the whole country appeared as one great waste over\r\nwhich the hand of the ruthless destroyer had exercised its ravages.\r\nTo understand the cause of this it is necessary to mention, that,\r\nwith the view of depriving the enemy of provisions, instructions\r\nhad been issued to lay waste the country between Berwick and the\r\ncapital, to remove or destroy the cattle and provisions, and that\r\nthe inhabitants should retire to other parts of the kingdom under\r\nthe severest penalties. To induce them to comply with this ferocious\r\ncommand, appalling statements of the cruelties of Cromwell in Ireland\r\nwere industriously circulated among the people; that he had given\r\norders to put all the males between 16 and 60 to death, to cut\r\nof the right hands of all the boys between 6 and 16, and to bore\r\nwith red-hot irons the breasts of all females of age for bearing\r\nchildren.[426] Fortunately for his army Cromwell had provided a fleet\r\nin case of exigency, which kept up with him in his march along the\r\ncoast, and supplied him with provisions.\r\n\r\nThe English general continued his course along the coast till he\r\narrived at Musselburgh, where he established his head-quarters. Here\r\nhe learnt that the Scots army, consisting of upwards of 30,000 men,\r\nhad taken up a strong position between Edinburgh and Leith, and\r\nhad made a deep entrenchment in front of their lines, along which\r\nthey had erected several batteries. Cromwell reconnoitered this\r\nposition, and tried all his art to induce the Scots to come to a\r\ngeneral engagement; but as Leslie’s plan was to act on the defensive,\r\nand thus force Cromwell either to attack him at a considerable\r\ndisadvantage, or to retreat back into England after his supply\r\nof provisions should be exhausted, he kept his army within their\r\nentrenchments.\r\n\r\nAs Cromwell perceived that he would be soon reduced to the\r\nalternative of attacking the Scots in their position, or of retracing\r\nhis steps through the ruined track over which his army had lately\r\npassed, he resolved upon an assault, and fixed Monday the 29th of\r\nJuly for advancing on the enemy. By a singular coincidence, the\r\nking, at the instigation of the Earl of Eglinton, but contrary to\r\nthe wish of his council and the commanders, visited the army that\r\nvery day. His presence was hailed with shouts of enthusiasm by the\r\nsoldiers, who indulged in copious libations to the health of their\r\nsovereign. The soldiers in consequence neglected their duty, and\r\ngreat confusion prevailed in the camp;[427] but on the approach of\r\nCromwell sufficient order was restored, and they patiently waited his\r\nattack. Having selected the centre of the enemy’s position, near a\r\nspot called the Quarry Holes, about half-way between Edinburgh and\r\nLeith, as appearing to him the most favourable point for commencing\r\nthe operations of the day, Cromwell led forward his army to the\r\nassault; but after a desperate struggle he was repulsed with the\r\nloss of a considerable number of men and horses.[428] Cromwell\r\nrenewed the attack on the 31st, and would probably have carried\r\nLeslie’s position but for a destructive fire from some batteries\r\nnear Leith. Cromwell retired to Musselburgh in the evening, where\r\nhe was unexpectedly attacked by a body of 2,000 horse and 500 foot,\r\ncommanded by Major-General Montgomery, son of the Earl of Eglinton,\r\nand Colonel Strachan, which had been despatched at an early part\r\nof the day by a circuitous route to the right, for the purpose of\r\nfalling on Cromwell’s rear. If Balfour is to be credited, this party\r\nbeat Cromwell “soundlie,” and would have defeated his whole army\r\nif they had had an additional force of 1,000 men; but an English\r\nwriter informs us, that the Scots suffered severely.[429] According\r\nto the first-mentioned author the English had 5 colonels and 500 men\r\nkilled, while the latter states the loss of the Scots to have been\r\nabout 100 men, and a large number of prisoners. On the following day,\r\nCromwell, probably finding that he had enough of mouths to consume\r\nhis provisions, without the aid of prisoners, offered to exchange all\r\nthose he had taken the preceding day, and sent the wounded Scots back\r\nto their camp.\r\n\r\nThese encounters, notwithstanding the expectations of the ministers,\r\nand the vaunts of the parliamentary committee of their pretended\r\nsuccesses, inspired some of Leslie’s officers with a salutary dread\r\nof the prowess of Cromwell’s veterans. An amusing instance of this\r\nfeeling is related by Balfour in the case of the earl of W. (he\r\nsuppresses the name) who “being commandit the nixt day (the day\r\nafter the last mentioned skirmish) in the morning, to marche out one\r\na partey, saw he could not goe one upone service untill he had his\r\nbrackefaste. The brackefaste was delayed above four hours in getting\r\nuntil the L. General being privily advertissed by a secrett frind,\r\nthat my Lord was peaceably myndit that morning, sent him expresse\r\norders not to marche, to save his reputation. One this, the gallants\r\nof the army raissed a proverbe, ‘That they wold not goe out one a\r\npartey until they gate ther brackefaste.’”[430]\r\n\r\nFor several days Cromwell remained inactive in his camp, during which\r\nthe parliamentary committee subjected the Scots army to a purging\r\noperation, which impaired its efficiency, and, perhaps, contributed\r\nchiefly to its ruin. As the Solemn League and Covenant was considered\r\nby the Covenanters a sacred pledge to God, which no true Christian\r\ncould refuse to take, they looked upon those who declined to\r\nsubscribe it as the enemies of religion, with whom it would be\r\ncriminal in the eye of Heaven to associate. Before the purgation\r\ncommenced, the king received a hint, equivalent to a command, from\r\nthe heads of the Covenanters to retire to Dunfermline, an order which\r\nhe obeyed “sore against his own mind,”[431] by taking his departure\r\non Friday the 2d of August, after spending the short space of two\r\nhours at a banquet, which had been provided for him by the city of\r\nEdinburgh. No sooner had the king departed than the purging process\r\nwas commenced, and on the 2d, 3d, and 5th of August, during which\r\nthe committee held their sittings, no less than 80 officers, all men\r\nof unquestionable loyalty, besides a considerable number of common\r\nsoldiers, were expelled from the army.[432]\r\n\r\nCromwell retired with his army to Dunbar on the 5th of August. Here\r\nhe found the few inhabitants who had remained in the town in a state\r\nof starvation. Touched with commiseration, he generously distributed\r\namong them, on his supplies being landed, a considerable quantity of\r\nwheat and pease.[433]\r\n\r\nWhile the ministers were thanking God “for sending the sectarian army\r\n(for so they designated the Independents) back the way they came, and\r\nflinging such a terror into their hearts, as made them fly when none\r\npursued,”[434] Cromwell suddenly re-appeared at Musselburgh, and thus\r\nput an end to their thanksgivings.\r\n\r\nSeeing no hopes of the Scots army leaving its entrenchments, and\r\nafraid that farther delay might be injurious to him, Cromwell made a\r\nmovement on the 13th of August to the west, as far as the village of\r\nColinton, three miles south-west from Edinburgh, where he posted the\r\nmain body of his army. The Scottish general thinking that Cromwell\r\nhad an intention of attacking him in his rear, raised his camp and\r\nmarched towards Corstorphine, about two miles north from Colinton,\r\nwhere he drew out his army. Both armies surveyed each other for\r\nseveral days, but neither attempted to bring the other to action. As\r\nhe could not, from the nature of the ground which lay between the\r\ntwo armies, attack his opponents with any probability of success,\r\nCromwell again returned to Musselburgh with his army on a Sunday,\r\nthat he might not be harassed in his march by the Covenanters, who\r\nnever fought but on the defensive on that day.\r\n\r\nAlthough the king before his landing had subscribed the Solemn League\r\nand Covenant, and although they had purged the army to their heart’s\r\ncontent, still Argyle and his party were not satisfied, and they,\r\ntherefore, required his majesty to subscribe a declaration “for the\r\nsatisfaction of all honest men.” On the 16th of August, after some\r\nhesitation and with slight modification of the terms, Charles was\r\ninduced to sign a most humiliating declaration, which reflected upon\r\nthe conduct of his father, lamented the “idolatry” of his mother,\r\npledged him to renounce the friendship of all who were unfriendly to\r\nthe Covenant, establish Presbyterianism in England, in short, made\r\nhim a mere tool in the hands of the extreme Covenanters.\r\n\r\nAlthough every sober and judicious person must have perceived that\r\nthere was little probability that such a declaration would be\r\nregarded by the young monarch when released from his trammels, yet so\r\ngreatly important was his majesty’s subscription to the instrument\r\nconsidered by the Covenanters, that they hailed it with the most\r\nlively emotions of joy and gratitude; and the ministers who, only two\r\ndays before, had denounced the king from the pulpits as the root of\r\nmalignancy, and a hypocrite, who had shown, by his refusal to sign\r\nthe declaration, that he had no intention to keep the Covenant, were\r\nthe first to set the example. The army, excited by the harangues of\r\nthe ministers during a fast, which they proclaimed to appease the\r\nanger of heaven for the sins of the king and his father, longed to\r\nmeet the enemy, and it required all the influence and authority of\r\nGeneral Leslie to restrain them from leaving their lines and rushing\r\nupon the “sectaries;” but, unfortunately for the Covenanters, their\r\nwish was soon to be gratified.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the chiefs of the Covenanters were actuated\r\nby the same enthusiasm as the ministers and the common soldiers,\r\nor that the generals of the army were very sanguine of success.\r\nThey were too well aware of the composition of Cromwell’s veteran\r\nhost, to suppose that their raw and undisciplined levies, though\r\nnumerically superior, could meet the enemy in the open field; and\r\nhence they deemed it a wise course of policy to act on the defensive,\r\nand to harass them by a desultory warfare as occasion offered. This\r\nsystem had been so successful as to embarrass Cromwell greatly, and\r\nto leave him no alternative but a retreat into England--a course\r\nwhich he was obliged to adopt more speedily, perhaps, than he would\r\notherwise have done, in consequence of extensive sickness in his\r\narmy. No indications of any movement had appeared up to the 29th\r\nof August, as on that day the Committee of Estates adjourned the\r\nmeeting of parliament, which was to have then assembled, till the\r\n10th of September, “in respecte that Oliver Cromwell and his armey\r\nof sectaries and blasphemers have invadit this kingdome, and are now\r\nlaying within the bosome thereof.”[435]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of August, however, Cromwell collected his army at\r\nMusselburgh, and having put all his sick on board his fleet, which\r\nlay in the adjoining bay, he gave orders to his army to march next\r\nmorning to Haddington, and thence to Dunbar. He made an attempt to\r\nobtain the consent of the Committee of Estates to retire without\r\nmolestation, promising never again to interfere in the affairs\r\nof Scotland; but they refused to agree to his proposal, as they\r\nconsidered that they would be able to cut off his retreat and compel\r\nhim to surrender at discretion.\r\n\r\nNext morning Cromwell’s army was in full retreat towards Haddington.\r\nThe Scots army followed in close pursuit, but with the exception\r\nof some slight skirmishing between the advanced guard of the Scots\r\nand Cromwell’s rear, nothing important took place. Cromwell halted\r\nduring the night at Haddington, and offered battle next day; but\r\nas the Scots declined, he continued his retreat to Dunbar, which\r\nhe reached in the evening. With the intention of cutting off his\r\nretreat, Leslie drew off his army to the south towards the heights\r\nof Lammermuir, and took up a position on Doon hill. Having at the\r\nsame time secured an important pass called the Peaths, through which\r\nCromwell had necessarily to pass on his way to Berwick, the situation\r\nof the latter became extremely critical, as he had no chance of\r\nescape but by cutting his way through the Scots army, which had\r\nnow completely obstructed his line of retreat. Cromwell perceived\r\nthe danger of his situation, but he was too much of an enthusiast\r\nto give way to despair; he deliberately, and within view of the\r\nenemy, shipped off the remainder of his sick at Dunbar, on the 2d\r\nof September, intending, should Providence not directly interpose\r\nin his behalf, to put his foot also on board, and at the head of\r\nhis cavalry to cut his way through the Scots army.[436] But as, in\r\nan affair of such importance, nothing could be done without prayer,\r\nhe directed his men to “seek the Lord for a way of deliverance and\r\nsalvation.”[437] A part of the day was accordingly spent in prayer,\r\nand at the conclusion, Cromwell declared, that while he prayed he\r\nfelt an enlargement of heart and a buoyancy of spirit which assured\r\nhim that God had hearkened to their prayers.[438]\r\n\r\nWhile Cromwell and his men were employed in their devotional\r\nexercises, a council of war was held by the Scottish commander to\r\ndeliberate upon the course to be pursued in the present crisis. As\r\nLeslie considered himself perfectly secure in his position, which\r\ncould not be assailed by the enemy without evident risk of a defeat,\r\nand as he was apprehensive of a most formidable and desperate\r\nresistance should he venture to attack the brave and enthusiastic\r\nIndependents, who were drawn out within two miles of his camp; he\r\ngave as his opinion that the Scottish army should not only remain\r\nin its position, but that Cromwell should be allowed to retire\r\ninto England on certain easy conditions. The officers of the army\r\nconcurred in the views of the general, but this opinion was overruled\r\nby the Committees of the Estates and kirk, who, anxious to secure\r\ntheir prey, lest by any possibility it might escape, insisted that\r\nthe army should descend from the heights and attack the “army of\r\nsectaries and blasphemers,” which they fully expected the Lord would\r\ndeliver into their hands.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the orders of the Committees to attack Cromwell\r\nearly the following morning, Leslie drew down his men on the evening\r\nof the 2d of September from the heights which they occupied to the\r\nlevel ground below, that he might be ready to commence the attack\r\nbefore the enemy should be fully on their guard. But nothing could\r\nescape the penetrating eye of Cromwell, who, though pondering\r\nwith solicitude upon the difficulties of his situation, was not\r\ninattentive to the enemy, whose motions he personally watched with\r\nthe utmost vigilance and assiduity. He was about retiring for the\r\nnight, when looking through his glass for the last time that evening,\r\nhe perceived, to his infinite joy, the Scottish army in motion\r\ndown the hill. The object of this movement at once occurred to\r\nhim, and in a rapture of enthusiasm he exclaimed, “They are coming\r\ndown;--the Lord hath delivered them into our hands.” A strong spirit\r\nof religious enthusiasm had in fact seized both armies, and each\r\nconsidered itself the peculiar favourite of heaven.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Scots their movements were considerably impeded\r\nby the state of the weather, which, during the night, became very\r\nrainy and tempestuous. Confident in their numbers, they seem to have\r\ndisregarded the ordinary rules of military prudence, and such was the\r\nslowness of their movements, that they found themselves unexpectedly\r\nattacked at the dawn of day before the last of their forces had\r\nleft the hill where they had been stationed. Cromwell had, during\r\nthe night, advanced his army to the edge of a deep ravine which\r\nhad separated the advanced posts of both parties, along which his\r\ntroops reposed waiting in deep silence the order for attack. As soon\r\nas Cromwell was enabled by the approach of day to obtain a partial\r\nview of the position selected by the Scots, he perceived that the\r\nScottish general had posted a large body of cavalry on his right wing\r\nnear to a pass on the road from Dunbar to Berwick, with the evident\r\nintention of preventing the English from effecting an escape. To this\r\npoint, therefore, Cromwell directed his attack with the main body\r\nof his horse, and some regiments of foot, with which he endeavoured\r\nto obtain possession of the pass; but they were charged by the\r\nScottish lancers, who, aided by some artillery, drove them down the\r\nhill. Cromwell, thereupon, brought up a reserve of horse and foot\r\nand renewed the attack, but was again repulsed. He still persevered,\r\nhowever, and the cavalry were again giving way, when just as the sun\r\nwas emerging from the ocean, and beginning, through the mist of the\r\nmorning, to dart its rays upon the armour of the embattled hosts, he\r\nexclaimed with impassioned fervour,--“Let God arise, let his enemies\r\nbe scattered.” In a moment Cromwell’s own regiment of foot, to whom\r\nhis exclamation had been more particularly addressed, advanced with\r\ntheir pikes levelled, the cavalry rallied, and the Scottish horse, as\r\nif seized with a panic, turned their backs and fled, producing the\r\nutmost confusion among the foot, who were posted in their rear.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Scots perceived the defeat and flight of their\r\ncavalry, they were seized with a feeling of consternation, and\r\nthrowing away their arms, sought their safety in flight. They were\r\nclosely pursued by Cromwell’s dragoons, who followed them to the\r\ndistance of many miles in the direction of Edinburgh, and cut them\r\ndown without mercy. Out of a force of 27,000 men, who, a few hours\r\nbefore, had assured themselves of victory, not more than 14,000\r\nescaped. 3,000 of the Scots lay lifeless on the fertile plains of\r\nEast Lothian, and about 10,000 were taken prisoners, of whom not\r\nless than 5,000 were wounded.[439] All the ammunition, artillery,\r\nand baggage of the Scots army fell into the hands of the conquerors.\r\nThe loss on the side of Cromwell was trifling, not amounting to more\r\nthan 30 men killed. The battle of Dunbar took place on the 3d of\r\nSeptember, 1650, and was long familiarly known among the Scots by the\r\nname of “the Tyesday’s chase.”\r\n\r\nCromwell spent the following day at Dunbar writing despatches to\r\nthe parliament. He ordered all the wounded to be taken particular\r\ncare of, and after their wounds were dressed they were released on\r\ntheir parole. The remainder of the prisoners were sent to England,\r\nwhere about 2,000 of them died of a pestilential disease, and the\r\nrest were sent as slaves to the English plantations in the West\r\nIndies. Cromwell, of course, now abandoned his intention of returning\r\nto England. In furtherance of his design to subject Scotland to\r\nhis authority, he marched to Edinburgh, which he entered without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Scottish horse and the few foot which had\r\nescaped from the slaughter of Dunbar were collected together at\r\nStirling. Here the Commissioners of the General Assembly held\r\na meeting on the 12th of September, at which they drew up a\r\n“declaration and warning to all the congregations of the kirk of\r\nScotland,” exhorting the people to bear the recent disaster with\r\nbecoming fortitude, and to humble themselves before God that he might\r\nturn away his anger from them; at the same time ordaining a “soleme\r\npublicke humiliatione upone the defait of the armey,” to be kept\r\nthroughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this “declaration and warning” had little effect\r\nupon the minds of the people, whose enthusiasm had been somewhat\r\ncooled by Cromwell’s success, and although they did not, perhaps,\r\nlike their unfortunate countrymen, who were taken captives on the\r\n3d of September and sent into England, curse the king and clergy\r\nfor insnaring them in misery, as Whitelock observes, they could\r\nnot but look upon the perpetual meddling of the ministers with the\r\naffairs of the State, as the real source of all the calamities which\r\nhad recently befallen the country. As to the king he had become so\r\nthoroughly disgusted with the conduct of the Argyle faction, whose\r\nsole object seemed to be to use him as a tool for their own purposes,\r\nthat he regarded the recent defeat of the Covenanters in the light\r\nof a triumph to his cause, which, by destroying the power of Argyle,\r\nwould pave the way for the due exercise of the royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe king now entertained the idea of forming a party for himself\r\namong the numerous royalists in the Highlands, for which purpose he\r\nopened up a correspondence with Huntly, Moray, and Athole, and other\r\nchiefs; but before matters were fully concocted, the negotiation\r\nwas disclosed to Argyle, who took immediate means to defeat it.\r\nAccordingly, on the 27th of September, the Committee of Estates\r\nordered the whole cavaliers who still remained about the king’s\r\nperson, with the exception of three, one of whom was Buckingham, to\r\nquit the court within 24 hours, and the kingdom in 20 days.\r\n\r\nAs Charles was to be thus summarily deprived of the society and\r\nadvice of his friends, he took the resolution of leaving Perth, and\r\nretiring to the Highlands among his friends. Accordingly, under the\r\npretence of hawking, he left Perth about half-past one o’clock in the\r\nafternoon of the 4th of October, accompanied by five of his livery\r\nservants, and rode at full gallop, until he arrived at Dudhope near\r\nDundee, which he did in an hour and a half. He then proceeded to\r\nAuchter-house along with Viscount Dudhope, whence he was conveyed by\r\nthe Earl of Buchan and the Viscount to Cortuquhuy, the seat of the\r\nEarl of Airly. After partaking of some refreshment he proceeded the\r\nsame night up the glen, under the protection of 60 or 80 Highlanders,\r\nto a poor cottage, 42 miles from Perth, belonging to the laird of\r\nClova. Fatigued by such a long journey, he threw himself down on an\r\nold mattress, but he had not enjoyed many hours repose when the house\r\nwas entered, a little before break of day, by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nNairne, and Colonel Baynton, an Englishman, who had been sent by\r\nColonel Montgomery in quest of him. Shortly after Montgomery himself\r\nappeared, accompanied by the laird of Scotscraig, who had given him\r\ninformation of the place of his Majesty’s retreat, and Sir Alexander\r\nHope bearing one of the king’s hawks. This party advised the king to\r\nget on horseback, offered to attend him, and promised to live and die\r\nwith him if necessary.\r\n\r\nPerceiving their intention to carry him back to Perth, the king told\r\nMontgomery that he had left Perth in consequence of information\r\nhe had received from Dr. Fraser, his physician, that it was the\r\nintention of the Committee of Estates to have delivered him up to\r\nthe English, and to hang all his servants: Montgomery assured his\r\nMajesty that the statement was false, and that no person but a\r\ntraitor could have invented it. While this altercation was going on,\r\nDudhope and the Highlanders who attended the king strongly advised\r\nhim to retire instantly to the mountains, and they gave him to\r\nunderstand that a force of 2,000 horse and 5,000 foot was waiting for\r\nhim within the distance of five or six miles ready to execute his\r\norders; but before his Majesty had come to any resolution as to the\r\ncourse he should adopt, two regiments of covenanting horse appeared,\r\non observing which, says Balfour, “Buchan, Dudhope and ther begerly\r\nguard begane to shecke ther eares, and speake more calmley, and in\r\na lower strain.” The king thereupon gave his consent to return to\r\nPerth, whither he was accordingly conducted by Montgomery at the head\r\nof his horse.[440]\r\n\r\nThis attempt of the king to escape (familiarly known by the name\r\nof “the Start”) produced a salutary effect upon the Committee of\r\nEstates, and they now began to treat him with more respect, admitting\r\nhim to their deliberations, and even suspending the act they had\r\nissued ordering the English cavaliers to leave the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs a considerable part of the Highlands was now up in arms to\r\nsupport the king, the committee induced him to write letters to the\r\nchief leaders of the insurrection desiring them to lay down their\r\narms, which correspondence led to a protracted negotiation. An act\r\nof indemnity was passed on the 12th of October, in favour of the\r\npeople of Athole, who had taken up arms; but as it was couched in\r\nlanguage which they disliked, and contained conditions of which they\r\ndisapproved, the Earl of Athole and his people presented a petition\r\nto his majesty and the committee, craving some alteration in the\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nIn order to enforce the orders of the king to the northern royalists,\r\nto lay down their arms, Sir John Brown’s regiment was despatched to\r\nthe north; but they were surprised during the night of the 21st of\r\nOctober, and defeated by a party under Sir David Ogilvie, brother\r\nto Lord Ogilvie. On receiving this intelligence, General Leslie\r\nhastened to Perth from Stirling, and crossed the Tay on the 24th,\r\nwith a force of 3,000 cavalry, with which he was ordered to proceed\r\nto Dundee and scour Angus. At this time General Middleton was lying\r\nat Forfar, and he, on hearing of Leslie’s advance, sent him a letter,\r\ninclosing a copy of a “bond and oath of engagement” which had been\r\nentered into by Huntly, Athole, Seaforth, Middleton, and other\r\nindividuals, by which they had pledged themselves to join firmly and\r\nfaithfully together, and neither for fear, threatening, allurement,\r\nnor advantage, to relinquish the cause of religion, of the king and\r\nof the kingdom, nor to lay down their arms without a general consent;\r\nand as the best undertakings often did not escape censure and malice,\r\nthey promised and swore, for the satisfaction of all reasonable\r\npersons, that they would maintain the true religion, as then\r\nestablished in Scotland, the National Covenant, and the Solemn League\r\nand Covenant; and defend the person of the king, his prerogative,\r\ngreatness, and authority, and the privileges of parliament, and the\r\nfreedom of the subject. Middleton stated that Leslie would perceive\r\nfrom the terms of the document inclosed, that the only aim of himself\r\nand friends was to unite Scotsmen in defence of their common rights,\r\nand that the grounds on which they had entered into the association\r\nwere precisely the same as those professed by Leslie himself. As the\r\nindependence of Scotland was at stake, and as Scotsmen should unite\r\nfor the preservation of their liberties, he proposed to join Leslie,\r\nand to put himself under his command, and he expressed a hope that\r\nLeslie would not shed the blood of his countrymen, or force them to\r\nthe unhappy necessity of shedding the blood of their brethren in\r\nself-defence.[441] The negotiation thus begun was finally concluded\r\non the 4th of November at Strathbogie, agreeably to a treaty between\r\nLeslie and the chief royalists, by which the latter accepted an\r\nindemnity and laid down their arms.\r\n\r\nCromwell did not follow up his success as might have been expected,\r\nbut contented himself with laying siege to the castle of Edinburgh,\r\nand pushing forward his advanced posts as far as Linlithgow.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading Covenanters both in parliament and the church,\r\nthere were some whose political ideas were pretty similar to those\r\nof Cromwell, respecting monarchical government, and who had not\r\nonly approved of the execution of the late king, but were desirous\r\nof excluding his son from the crown of Scotland. This party, though\r\na minority, made up for its numerical inferiority, by the talents,\r\nfanaticism, and restless activity of its partisans; but formidable\r\nas their opposition in parliament was, they found themselves unable\r\neffectually to resist the general wish of the nation in favour of\r\nthe king, and yielded to the force of circumstances. By excluding,\r\nhowever, the royalists from the camp, and keeping the king in a state\r\nof subjection to their authority, they had succeeded in usurping the\r\ngovernment, and had the disaster of Dunbar not occurred, might have\r\nbeen enabled to carry their designs against the monarchy into effect;\r\nbut notwithstanding this catastrophe, they were not discouraged, and\r\nas soon as they had recovered from the temporary state of alarm into\r\nwhich the success of Cromwell had thrown them, they began to concert\r\nmeasures, in accordance with a plan they now contemplated, for making\r\nthemselves altogether independent of parliament. For this purpose,\r\nunder the pretence of opposing the common enemy, they solicited and\r\nobtained permission from the Committee of Estates to raise forces in\r\nthe counties of Dumfries, Galloway, Wigton, Ayr, and Renfrew, the\r\ninhabitants of which were imbued with a sterner spirit of fanaticism,\r\nand therefore more ready to support their plans than those of any\r\nother parts of Scotland. By bringing in the exhortations of Gillespie\r\nand others of the more rigid among the ministers to their aid, they\r\nsucceeded in a short time in raising a body of nearly 5,000 horse,\r\nover which Strachan, Kerr, and two other colonels, all mere tools of\r\nthe party, were placed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the leaders of this faction, of whom Johnston of\r\nWarriston, the clerk-register, was chief, had collected these levies,\r\nthey began to develop the plan they had formed of withdrawing\r\nthemselves from the control of the Committee of Estates by raising\r\na variety of objections against the line of conduct pursued by\r\nthe Committee, and, till these were removed, they refused to unite\r\n“the western army,” as this new force was called, with the army\r\nunder Leslie. Cromwell, aware of this division in the Scottish\r\narmy, endeavoured to widen the breach by opening a correspondence\r\nwith Strachan, who had fought under him at Preston, the consequence\r\nbeing that Strachan soon went over to the English army with a body\r\nof troopers. Leslie complained to the Estates of the refusal of the\r\nwestern forces to join him, and solicited to be recalled from his\r\ncharge; but they declined to receive his resignation, and sent a\r\ndeputation, consisting of Argyle, Cassilis, and other members to the\r\nwestern army, “to solicit unity for the good of the kingdom.”[442]\r\nSo unsuccessful, however, was the deputation in bringing about this\r\ndesired “unity,” that, on the 17th October, an elaborate paper,\r\ntitled, “the humble Remonstrance of the Gentlemen-Commanders, and\r\nMinisters attending the forces in the west,” addressed to the\r\nCommittee of Estates, was drawn up and presented by Sir George\r\nMaxwell to them at Stirling, on the 22d. The compilers of this\r\ndocument proposed to remove from the presence of the king, the\r\njudicatories and the armies, the “malignants,” whom many of the\r\ncommittee were accused of having received “into intimate friendship,”\r\nadmitting them to their councils, and bringing in some of them to\r\nthe parliament and committees, and about the king, thereby affording\r\n“many pregnant presumptions,” of a design on the part of some of the\r\nCommittee of Estates, “to set up and employ the malignant party,”\r\nor, at least, giving “evidences of a strong inclination to intrust\r\nthem again in the managing of the work of God.”[443] The Committee\r\nof Estates paid no regard to this remonstrance, a circumstance which\r\ngave such umbrage to Warriston and the leaders of the western army,\r\nthat they drew up another, couched in still stronger language, on\r\nthe 30th of October, at Dumfries, whither they had retired with\r\nthe army on a movement made by Cromwell to the west. In this fresh\r\nremonstrance the faction declared that as it was now manifest that\r\nthe king was opposed to the work of God and the Covenants, and\r\ncleaving to the enemies of both, they would not regard him or his\r\ninterest in their quarrel with the invaders; that he ought not to be\r\nintrusted in Scotland with the exercise of his power till he gave\r\nproofs of a real change in his conduct; and that an effectual course\r\nought to be taken for preventing, in time coming, “his conjunction\r\nwith the malignant party,” and for investigating into the cause of\r\nhis late flight; and that the malignants should be rendered incapable\r\nin future of hurting the work and people of God.[444]\r\n\r\nA petition having been presented to the Committee of Estates on\r\nthe 9th of November, requiring a satisfactory answer to the first\r\nremonstrance, a joint declaration was issued by the king and the\r\ncommittee on the 25th, declaring “the said paper, as it related to\r\nthe parliament and civil judicatories, to be scandalous and injurious\r\nto his majesty’s person, and prejudicial to his authority.” The\r\ncommission of the General Assembly having been required to give their\r\nopinion upon the remonstrance, in so far as it related to religion\r\nand church judicatories, acknowledged that, although it contained\r\n“many sad truths,” nevertheless, the commission declared itself\r\ndissatisfied with the remonstrance, which it considered apt to breed\r\ndivision in kirk and kingdom.[445] This declaration of the commission\r\nwas not only approved of by the General Assembly, but what was of\r\nequal importance, that venerable body passed a resolution declaring\r\nthat in such a perilous crisis all Scotsmen might be employed to\r\ndefend their country. An exception of persons “excommunicated,\r\nforfeited, notoriously profane, or flagitious, and professed enemies\r\nand opposers of the Covenant and cause of God,”[446] was no doubt\r\nmade, but this exemption did not exclude _all_ the “malignants.” A\r\nbreach was now made in the unity of the Scottish church, and the\r\nnation was split into two parties--a division which paved the way for\r\nthe subjugation of Scotland by Cromwell. The party which adhered to\r\nthe king was distinguished by the name of _Resolutioners_, and the\r\nother was denominated _Protesters_, a distinction which was kept up\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more gratifying to Cromwell than to see the Scots\r\nthus divided among themselves, and keeping up two distinct armies\r\nin the field, mutually opposed to each other. He had by negotiation\r\nand intrigue contributed to increase the irritation between the two\r\nparties, and had even succeeded in sowing the seeds of dissension\r\namong the leaders of the western army itself. Strachan, his old\r\nfriend, had resigned the command which had been conferred on Kerr,\r\nwho was by no means hearty in the cause. In this situation of matters\r\nCromwell resolved, in the meantime, to confine his attention to the\r\noperations of the western army, with the intention, if he succeeded\r\nin defeating it, of marching north with the whole of his forces, and\r\nattacking the royal army. As the castle of Edinburgh was still in\r\nthe hands of the Covenanters, Cromwell could only spare a force of\r\nabout 7,000 horse, which he accordingly sent west about the end of\r\nNovember, under Lambert, to watch Kerr’s motions. Intelligence of\r\nthis movement was received by the parliament then sitting at Perth,\r\non the 30th of November, in consequence of which Colonel Robert\r\nMontgomery was despatched with three regiments to support the western\r\narmy, the command of which he was requested by the parliament to\r\ntake; and, to enforce this order, the committee on military affairs\r\nwas directed to send a deputation to the western forces to intimate\r\nto them the command of the parliament. Before the arrival however,\r\nof Montgomery, Kerr was defeated on the 1st of December, in an\r\nattack he made on Lambert at Hamilton, in which he himself was taken\r\nprisoner, and the whole of his forces dispersed.[447] This victory\r\ngave Cromwell quiet possession of the whole of Scotland, south of\r\nthe Clyde and the Forth, with the exception of Stirling, and a small\r\ntract around it; and as the castle of Edinburgh surrendered on the\r\n24th of December, Stirling castle was the only fortress of any note,\r\nsouth of the Forth, which remained in the possession of the royalists\r\nat the close of the year.\r\n\r\nA considerable time, however, elapsed before Cromwell found himself\r\nin a condition to commence his intended campaign beyond the Forth.\r\nHis inactivity is to be ascribed partly to an ague with which he was\r\nseized in February, 1651, and which had impaired his health so much\r\nthat in May he obtained permission to return to England to recruit\r\nhis debilitated constitution; but a sudden and favourable change\r\nhaving taken place in the state of his health, he gladly remained\r\nwith the army, which he put in motion towards Stirling on the 3d of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish parliament was fully aware of the impending danger, and\r\nmade the necessary preparations to meet it, but the Engagers and the\r\nparty of Argyle did not always draw together; yet the king had the\r\naddress, by his accommodating and insinuating behaviour, to smooth\r\ndown many differences, and thus prepared the way for that ascendency\r\nwhich his friends, the Hamiltons, afterwards obtained. The coronation\r\nof the king took place at Scone, on the 1st of January, 1651, in\r\npursuance of an order of the parliament. His conduct on that occasion\r\nadded greatly to his growing popularity. The first trial of strength,\r\nto borrow a modern parliamentary phrase, which took place in the\r\nparliament, was on the 23d of December, 1650, on the nomination\r\nof colonels to the different horse and foot regiments then in the\r\ncourse of being raised. A list of them had been submitted to the\r\nhouse on the 20th, which contained about an equal number of royalists\r\nand Covenanters. This gave rise to a long debate, but the list was\r\nfinally approved of.\r\n\r\nAmong the colonels of foot, were the Earls of Athole and\r\nTulliebardine, and the Master of Gray for Perth; the lairds of\r\nMaclean and Ardkinlass for Argyle and Bute; the laird of Grant and\r\nthe sheriff of Moray for Nairne, Elgin, and “Grant’s Lands;” the\r\nlairds of Pluscardine, Balnagowan, the master of Lovat, and the laird\r\nof Lumlair, for Inverness and Ross; Lord Sutherland and Henry Mackay\r\nof Skowrie, for Sutherland and Strathnaver; the master of Caithness\r\nfor Caithness; and Duncan Macpherson for Badenoch. The clans in\r\nthe Highlands and the Isles were to be commanded respectively by\r\nMacdonald, the tutor of Macleod, Clanranald, the tutor of Keppoch,\r\nthe laird of Lochaber, the tutor of Maclean, Lochiel, Macneil of\r\nBarra, Lauchlane Mackintosh, and the laird of Jura.[448]\r\n\r\nArgyle and his party made several attempts, afterwards, to check the\r\nrising influence of the Hamiltons, by opposing the different plans\r\nsubmitted to the parliament for rendering the army more efficient,\r\nbut they were outvoted. The finishing blow was given to their hopes\r\nby the appointment of the king to the chief command of the army, and\r\nby the repeal of the “act of classes,” which excluded the royalists\r\nfrom having any share in the administration of the affairs of the\r\nkingdom, and from serving their country.\r\n\r\nIn expectation of Cromwell’s advance, the Scots had raised, during\r\nthe spring, strong fortifications along the fords of the river\r\nForth, to obstruct his passage, and had entrenched themselves at the\r\nTorwood, having the town of Stirling at their back, in which position\r\nCromwell found them when he advanced west in July. As he considered\r\nit dangerous to attempt to carry such a strong position in the face\r\nof an army of about 20,000 men, (for such it is said was the number\r\nof the Scots), he endeavoured, by marches and countermarches, to draw\r\nthem out; but although they followed his motions, they took care not\r\nto commit themselves, by going too far from their lines of defence.\r\nSeeing no chance of bringing them to a general engagement, Cromwell\r\nadopted the bold plan of crossing the Frith of Forth at Queensferry,\r\nand of throwing himself into the rear of the Scottish army. While\r\ntherefore, he continued, by his motions along the Scottish lines, to\r\ndraw off the attention of the Scottish commanders from his plan, he,\r\non the 20th of July, sent over Lambert, with a large division of his\r\narmy in a number of boats which had been provided for the occasion.\r\nHe landed without opposition, and proceeded immediately to fortify\r\nhimself on the hill between the North Ferry and Inverkeithing.\r\nGeneral Holburn was immediately despatched with a large force to keep\r\nLambert in check, and though the Scots fought with great bravery,\r\nthey were defeated. A body of Highlanders particularly distinguished\r\nthemselves. The loss of the Scots was considerable; and among the\r\nslain were the young chief of Maclean and about 100 of his friends\r\nand followers. This victory opened a free passage to Cromwell to the\r\nnorth of Scotland. He immediately, therefore, crossed the Forth with\r\nthe remainder of his army, and proceeded to Perth, of which he took\r\npossession on the 2d of August.\r\n\r\nWhile the Scottish leaders were puzzled how to extricate themselves\r\nfrom the dilemma into which they had been thrown by the singular\r\nchange which had lately taken place in the relative position of the\r\ntwo armies, the king alone seemed free from embarrassment, and at\r\nonce proposed to his generals, that, instead of following Cromwell,\r\nor waiting till he should attack them, they should immediately invade\r\nEngland, where he expected to be joined by numerous royalists, who\r\nonly required his presence among them at the head of such an army, to\r\ndeclare themselves. Under existing circumstances, the plan, though\r\nat once bold and decisive, was certainly judicious, and, therefore,\r\nit is not surprising that it should have received the approbation of\r\nthe chiefs of the army. Having obtained their concurrence, the king\r\nimmediately issued a proclamation on the 30th of July, to the army,\r\nannouncing his intention of marching for England the following day,\r\naccompanied by such of his subjects as were willing to give proofs\r\nof their loyalty by sharing his fortunes. This appeal was not made\r\nin vain, and Charles found himself next morning in full march on\r\nthe road to Carlisle, at the head of 11,000, or, as some accounts\r\nstate, of 14,000 men. Argyle, as was to be expected, excused himself\r\nfrom accompanying the army, and obtained permission to retire to his\r\ncastle.[449]\r\n\r\nAlthough Cromwell was within almost a day’s march of the Scottish\r\narmy, yet, so sudden and unexpected had been its departure, and so\r\nsecretly had the whole affair been managed, that it was not until\r\nthe 4th of August that he received the extraordinary intelligence\r\nof its departure for England. Cromwell was now as much embarrassed\r\nas the Scottish commander had lately been, for he had not the most\r\ndistant idea, when he threw himself so abruptly into their rear,\r\nthat they would adopt the bold resolution of marching into England.\r\nAs soon, however, as he had recovered from the surprise into which\r\nsuch an alarming event had thrown him, he despatched letters to the\r\nparliament, assuring them of his intention to follow the Scottish\r\narmy without delay, and exhorting them not to be discouraged, but\r\nto rely on his activity. He also sent Lambert with a force of 3,000\r\ncavalry to harass the rear of the Scottish army, and forwarded orders\r\nto Harrison, who was then at Newcastle, to press upon their flank\r\nwith a similar number; and, in a few days, he himself crossed the\r\nForth with an army of 10,000 men, and proceeded along the eastern\r\ncoast, in the direction of York, leaving Monk behind him with a force\r\nof 5,000 horse and foot to complete the reduction of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish army reached Worcester on the 22d, and on being mustered\r\nthe king found that he had at his command only 14,000 men, 2,000\r\nof whom were Englishmen. To attack this force, large bodies of\r\nparliamentary troops were concentrated at Worcester, and on the\r\n28th of August, when Cromwell arrived to take the command, the army\r\nof the republic amounted to upwards of 30,000 men, who hailed the\r\npresence of their commander with rapture. The two armies met on the\r\n3d of September, the anniversary of the battle of Dunbar, and the\r\ndisastrous result is well known, it being out of place here to enter\r\ninto details. The king himself, at the head of the Highlanders,\r\nfought with great bravery: his example animated the troops, and had\r\nhe been supported by Leslie’s cavalry, as was expected, the issue of\r\nthe struggle might have been different. As it was, the royal army was\r\ncompletely defeated, and the king had to provide for his personal\r\nsafety by flight.\r\n\r\nThis battle, which Cromwell admits “was as stiff a contest for\r\nfour or five hours as ever he had seen,” was very disastrous\r\nto the royalists, 3,000 of whom were killed on the spot, and a\r\nconsiderably larger number taken prisoners, and even the greater\r\npart of the cavalry, who escaped from the city, were afterwards\r\ntaken by detachments of the enemy. The Duke of Hamilton was mortally\r\nwounded in the field of battle; the Earls of Derby, Lauderdale,\r\nRothes, Cleveland and Kelly, Lords Sinclair, Kenmure and Grandison,\r\nand Generals Leslie, Middleton, Massey and Montgomery, were made\r\nprisoners after the battle. When the king considered himself free\r\nfrom immediate danger, he separated, during the darkness of the\r\nnight, from the body of cavalry which surrounded him, and with a\r\nparty of 60 horse proceeded to Whiteladies, a house belonging to\r\none Giffard a recusant and royalist, at which he arrived at an\r\nearly hour in the morning, after a ride of 25 miles. After a series\r\nof extraordinary adventures and of the most singular hair-breadth\r\nescapes, he landed in safety at Fecamp in Normandy, on the 17th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nWhile Cromwell was following the king through England, Monk proceeded\r\nto complete the subjugation of Scotland. He first laid siege to\r\nStirling castle, into which he threw shells from batteries he had\r\nraised, the explosion of which so alarmed the Highlanders who\r\ncomposed the garrison, that they forced the governor to surrender.\r\nAll the records of the kingdom, the royal robes, and part of the\r\nregalia, which had been locked up in the castle as a place of perfect\r\nsecurity, fell into the hands of the captors, and were sent by Monk\r\nto England. He next proceeded to Dundee, which was strongly fortified\r\nand well garrisoned, and contained within it an immense quantity of\r\ncostly furniture and plate, besides a large sum of money, all of\r\nwhich had been lodged in the town for safety. Monk, hearing that the\r\nCommittees of the Estates and of the kirk were sitting at Alyth in\r\nAngus, sent a company of horse, who surprised the whole party and\r\nmade them prisoners.\r\n\r\nWhen the necessary preparations for an assault had been completed,\r\nMonk sent a summons to Lumsden, the governor of Dundee, to surrender,\r\nbut he rejected it with disdain. The obstinacy of Lumsden exasperated\r\nMonk, who ordered his troops to storm the town, and to put the\r\ngarrison and all the inhabitants, without regard to age or sex, to\r\nthe sword. The town was accordingly carried by assault on the 1st of\r\nSeptember, and was followed by all the horrors which an infuriated\r\nsoldiery could inflict upon a defenceless population. The townsmen\r\ngave no aid to the garrison, and when the republican troops entered\r\nthe town, they found the greater part of them lying drunk in the\r\nstreets. The carnage was stayed, but not until 800 males, including\r\nthe greater part of the garrison, and about 200 women and children,\r\nwere killed. Among the slain, was Lumsden the governor, who, although\r\nhe had quarter given him by Captain Kelly, was nevertheless shot dead\r\nby Major Butler as Kelly was conducting him along the street to Monk.\r\nBesides the immense booty which was in the town, about 60 ships which\r\nwere in the harbour of Dundee with their cargoes, fell into the hands\r\nof the English.[450]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Dundee was immediately followed by the voluntary\r\nsurrender of St. Andrews, Montrose and Aberdeen. Some of the\r\nCommittee of Estates who had been absent from Alyth, held a meeting\r\nat Inverury, to deliberate on the state of matters, at which the\r\nMarquis of Huntly presided, and at which a motion was made, to invest\r\nhim with full authority to act in the absence of the king, but the\r\nmeeting broke up on hearing of Monk’s approach. The committee retired\r\nacross the Spey, but Huntly went to Strathdon along with his forces.\r\nMonk did not proceed farther north than Aberdeen at this time.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Argyle, who had given great offence to Cromwell, by\r\nhis double dealing, seeing now no chance of opposing successfully the\r\nrepublican arms, made an attempt at negotiation, and sent a letter by\r\na trumpeter to Monk, proposing a meeting at some convenient place,\r\n“as a means to stop the shedding of more Christian blood.” The only\r\nanswer which Monk gave to the messenger, who arrived at Dundee on the\r\n19th of October, was, that he could not treat without orders from the\r\nparliament of England. This refusal on the part of Monk to negotiate,\r\nwas a sore disappointment to Argyle, as it disappointed the hopes he\r\nentertained of getting the English government to acknowledge a debt\r\nwhich he claimed from them.[451]\r\n\r\nMonk now turned his whole attention to the state of matters in\r\nthe North, where some forces were still on foot, under the command\r\nof the Marquis of Huntly and Lord Balcarras. With the former he\r\nconcluded an agreement on the 21st of November, under which Huntly\r\nconsented to disband his men; and on the 3d of December, a similar\r\ntreaty was entered into between Balcarras and Colonels Overton\r\nand Lilburn. Shortly after the English army crossed the Spey and\r\nentered Inverness, where they planted a garrison; so that before\r\nthe end of the year, the whole of the Lowlands and a part of the\r\nHighlands had submitted to the arms of the republic.[452] To complete\r\nthe destruction of the independence of Scotland, a destruction\r\naccomplished less by the power of her enemy than by the perversity\r\nof her sons, and to reduce it to a province of England, the English\r\narmy was augmented to 20,000 men, and citadels erected in several\r\ntowns, and a long chain of military stations drawn across the country\r\nto curb the inhabitants. All the crown lands were declared public\r\nproperty by the English parliament, and the estates of all persons\r\nwho had joined in the English invasions, under the king and the Duke\r\nof Hamilton, were confiscated by the same authority. A proclamation\r\nwas issued, abolishing all authority not derived from the English\r\nparliament: all persons holding public appointments, whose fidelity\r\nto the new order of things was suspected, were dismissed, and their\r\nplaces supplied by others of more subservient principles; the supreme\r\ncourts of justice were abolished, and English judges appointed to\r\ndischarge the judicial functions, aided by a few natives.[453]\r\n\r\nAs several bodies of Highlanders still remained under arms in the\r\ninterior of the Highlands, Monk directed three distinct parties to\r\ncross the mountains, simultaneously, in the summer of 1652. While\r\nColonel Lilburn advanced from Inverness towards Lochaber on one side,\r\nGeneral Dean led his troops from Perth in the same direction on the\r\nother, and Colonel Overton landed in Kintyre with a force from Ayr.\r\nBut they were all obliged speedily to retrace their steps, amid the\r\njeers and laughter of the Highlanders.[454]\r\n\r\nThe administration of the affairs of Scotland was committed to\r\nMonk, than whom a more prudent person, and one better calculated\r\nto disarm the indignant feelings of the Scots at their national\r\ndegradation, could not have been selected. But as it was evident that\r\norder could not be restored, or obedience enforced, as long as the\r\nclergy were allowed to continue their impertinent meddling in state\r\naffairs, he prohibited the meetings of the General Assembly, and,\r\nin one instance, dispersed that body by a military force. In doing\r\nso, it was afterwards admitted by some of the clergy themselves,\r\nthat he had acted wisely, as the shutting up of the assembly tended\r\ngreatly to allay those fierce contentions between the protesters and\r\nresolutioners, which, for several years, distracted the nation, and\r\nmade them attend more to the spiritual concerns of their flocks.[455]\r\nThe spirit of dissension was not, however, confined to the clergy,\r\nbut extended its withering influence to many of the laity, who, to\r\ngratify their revenge, accused one another of the most atrocious\r\ncrimes before the newly constituted tribunal. The English judges were\r\ncalled to decide upon numerous acts alleged to have been committed\r\ntwenty or thirty years before, of which no proofs were offered, but\r\nextorted confessions in the kirk, and no less than sixty persons were\r\nbrought before them accused of witchcraft, who had been tortured into\r\nan admission of its practices. All these cases were dismissed, and\r\nthe new judges administered the laws throughout with an equity and\r\nmoderation which was almost unknown before in Scotland, and which\r\nformed a singular contrast with the disregard of justice, and the\r\nextreme violence which had of late disgraced the Scottish tribunals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William, Ninth Earl of Glencairn.]\r\n\r\nWith a short interruption, occasioned by an insurrection, under\r\nthe Earl of Glencairn, in the Highlands, Scotland now enjoyed\r\ntranquillity till the restoration of Charles II., and comparative\r\nprosperity and happiness, a compensation in some degree for the loss\r\nof her liberties. The interruption alluded to took place in the year\r\n1653, on the departure of Monk from Scotland to take the command of\r\nthe English fleet.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1653, a meeting was held at Lochearn,\r\nwhich was attended by Glencairn, the Earl of Athole, Lord Lorn,\r\neldest son of the Marquis of Argyle, Glengarry, Lochiel, Graham\r\nof Duchray, Donald Macgregor tutor of Macgregor, Farquharson of\r\nInverey, Robertson of Strowan, Macnaughton of Macnaughton, and\r\nColonel Blackadder of Tullyallan. At this meeting, which continued\r\nseveral days, it was ultimately agreed that the persons present\r\nshould assemble their vassals and dependents with as little delay\r\nas possible, and place themselves under the command of Glencairn,\r\nwho was to wait in the neighbourhood of Lochearn till the different\r\nparties should collect and bring together their respective forces.\r\nSix weeks were, however, allowed to expire before any assemblage\r\ntook place, during all which time Glencairn roamed through the\r\nneighbouring mountains, attended only by one companion and three\r\nservants. The first who made his appearance was Graham of Duchray,\r\nat the head of 40 men. He was followed, in two or three days, by the\r\ntutor of Macgregor, and 80 of that clan. With this force he went to\r\nDuchray house, in Stirlingshire, near Loch Ard, where he was joined\r\nby Lord Kenmure, and about 40 horsemen, and by Colonel Blackadder,\r\nwith 30 more from Fife. The Laird of Macnaughton also arrived with 12\r\nhorse, and a party of between 60 and 80 lowlanders, under the command\r\nof Captain Hamilton, brother to the laird of Milntown. The earl’s\r\nforce thus amounted to nearly 300 men.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the assemblage of this body, Colonel Kidd, the governor\r\nof Stirling castle, at the head of the greater part of a regiment\r\nof foot, and a troop of horse, marched towards Aberfoyle, which was\r\nwithin three miles of Glencairn’s camp; but having received notice\r\nof his approach, the earl took care to secure the adjoining pass.\r\nHe posted his foot to the best advantage on both sides, and he drew\r\nup the horse under Lord Kenmure in the centre. Although Kidd must\r\nhave perceived the great risk he would run in attempting to carry the\r\npass, he nevertheless made the attempt, but his advance was driven\r\nback at the first charge by the lowlanders and Duchray’s men, with\r\nwhom they first came in contact, with the loss of about 60 men. The\r\nwhole of Kidd’s party, thereupon, turned their backs and fled. They\r\nwere hotly pursued by Glencairn’s horse and foot, who killed about 80\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe news of Kidd’s defeat, trifling as it was, raised the hopes of\r\nthe royalists, and small parties of Highlanders flocked daily to\r\nGlencairn’s standard. Leaving Aberfoyle, he marched to Lochearn, and\r\nthence to Loch Rannoch, where he was met by several of the clans.\r\nGlengarry brought 300, Lochiel 400, and Macgregor about 200 men.\r\nThe Earl of Athole appeared at the head of 100 horse, and brought\r\nalso a regiment of foot, consisting of about 1,200 men, commanded by\r\nAndrew Drummond, brother to Sir James Drummond of Mechaney, as his\r\nlieutenant-colonel. Sir Arthur Forbes and some officers, with about\r\n80 horsemen, also joined the royal army.\r\n\r\nHaving despatched some officers to the lowlands, with instructions\r\nto raise forces, Glencairn marched north to join Farquharson of\r\nInverey, who was raising a regiment in Cromar. In the course of his\r\nmarch, several gentlemen of the adjoining country joined him. Morgan,\r\nthe English general, who was lying at the time in Aberdeen, being\r\napprised of Farquharson’s movements, collected a force of 2,000 foot\r\nand 1,000 horse, with which he advanced, by forced marches, towards\r\nCromar, and a brisk attack upon the outposts of Glencairn’s army was\r\nthe first intelligence they received of Morgan’s approach. In the\r\nsituation in which Glencairn thus found himself unexpectedly placed,\r\nhe had no remedy but an immediate retreat through a long and narrow\r\nglen leading to the forest of Abernethy, which he was enabled to\r\nreach chiefly by the bravery of Graham of Duchray, who, at the head\r\nof a resolute party of 40 men, kept in check a body of the enemy who\r\nhad entered the glen before the royalists, and prevented them from\r\nsecuring the passes. Morgan pursued the fugitives through the glen\r\nvery closely, and did not desist till prevented by the darkness of\r\nthe night. He thereafter returned to Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nGlencairn passed about five weeks in Cromar and Badenoch, waiting for\r\nadditional reinforcements; and as Lord Lorn had not yet joined him,\r\nhe despatched Lord Kenmure with 100 horse into Argyleshire to urge\r\nhim to hurry forward the levies in that quarter. Lorn soon arrived in\r\nBadenoch with 1,000 foot and about 50 horse; but he had not remained\r\nabove a fortnight in the field when, on some pretence or other, he\r\n(January 1st, 1654) clandestinely left the army, and carried off\r\nhis men along with him, taking the direction of Ruthven castle,\r\nwhich was then garrisoned by English troops. Glencairn was greatly\r\nexasperated at Lorn’s defection, and sent a party of horse, under the\r\ncommand of Glengarry and Lochiel, with instructions either to bring\r\nhim and his men back to the army, or, in case of refusal, to attack\r\nthem. Glengarry followed the Campbells so hard that he came up with\r\nthem within half a mile of the castle. Lord Lorn escaped, and was\r\nfollowed by his horse, of whom about 20 were brought back by a party\r\nsent in pursuit by Glengarry; the foot halted on a hill, and offered\r\nto return to the camp. Glengarry, who had had a great antipathy to\r\nthe whole race of the Campbells ever since Montrose’s wars, would,\r\ncontrary to his instructions, have attacked them; but Glencairn\r\nfortunately arrived in time to prevent bloodshed, and having ordered\r\nGraham of Duchray to acquaint them that he could not receive any\r\nproposals from them with arms in their hands, they delivered them\r\nup. Glencairn, along with some officers, then rode up to them, and\r\nhaving addressed them on the impropriety of their conduct, they all\r\ndeclared their willingness to serve the king and to obey him as their\r\ncommander, a declaration which both officers and men confirmed with\r\nan oath. Their arms were then restored to them, but they all deserted\r\nwithin a fortnight.[456]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Glencairn was joined by a small party of English\r\nroyalists, under Colonel Wogan, an enterprising officer, who had\r\nlanded at Dover, and having raised a body of volunteers in London,\r\ntraversed England under the banners of the commonwealth, and entered\r\nScotland by Carlisle.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the desertion of the Campbells, Glencairn’s army was\r\nso increased by daily accessions of force that he considered himself\r\nin a condition to cope with the enemy, and, by the advice of his\r\nofficers, resolved to descend into Aberdeenshire, and beat up the\r\nquarters of the English. Another reason which urged him to leave\r\nthe Highlands was a scarcity of provisions in the districts which\r\nhad been occupied by his army, and which could no longer afford to\r\nsupport such a large body of men. Descending by Balveny, he took up\r\nhis quarters at Whitelums, near the castle of Kildrummie, belonging\r\nto the Earl of Mar, then garrisoned by the English. After lying about\r\na fortnight at Whitelums unmolested, Glencairn raised his camp,\r\nand marching into Morayshire, took possession of Elgin, where he\r\nestablished his head quarters. Here he was joined by the Marquis of\r\nMontrose, Lord Forrester, and some country gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a month at Elgin, where, according to Graham of\r\nDuchray’s narrative, the army had “very good quarters, and where\r\nthey made themselves merry,” the earl received letters from General\r\nMiddleton, who had some time before made his escape from the tower of\r\nLondon, where he had been imprisoned after the battle of Worcester,\r\nannouncing his arrival in Sutherland, with a commission from the\r\nking, appointing him generalissimo of all the royal forces in\r\nScotland. Some dissensions had existed among the royalists respecting\r\nthe chief command of the army, which had been finally conceded to\r\nGlencairn; but neither he nor the nobility who were with him, were\r\nprepared to expect that the king would have appointed, to such\r\nan important charge, a man so much their inferior in station as\r\nMiddleton. The intelligence was accordingly received with discontent;\r\nbut, as the king’s commission could not, without serious injury to\r\nthe royal cause, be disputed, in the present juncture they stifled\r\ntheir displeasure, and Glencairn, in terms of the instructions he\r\nhad received from Middleton to march north, put his army in motion.\r\nMorgan, the English commander, having drawn together a body of\r\ntroops, followed Glencairn, between whose rear and Morgan’s advanced\r\nguard many warm skirmishes took place.\r\n\r\nGlencairn and his men crossed the river Ness, eight miles above\r\nInverness. The earl having placed guards along the northern bank of\r\nthe river to watch the approach of the enemy, hastened to Dornoch\r\nto meet Middleton. In a few days a grand muster of the army took\r\nplace, when it was found to amount to 3,500 foot, and 1,500 horse.\r\nGlencairn then resigned the command to Middleton, in presence of the\r\narmy, and, riding along the lines, acquainted the troops that he was\r\nno longer their general, and expressed a hope that they would find\r\nthemselves happy in serving under such a commander as Middleton. The\r\ntroops expressed great dissatisfaction at this announcement by their\r\nlooks, and some, “both officers and soldiers, shed tears, and vowed\r\nthat they would serve with their old general in any corner of the\r\nworld.”[457]\r\n\r\nAfter the review, the earl gave a sumptuous entertainment to\r\nMiddleton and the principal officers of the army, at which an\r\noccurrence took place which soured the temper of the officers, and\r\nsowed the seeds of new divisions in the camp. On the cloth being\r\nremoved, Glencairn proposed the health of the commander-in-chief,\r\nwhom he thus addressed:--“My lord general, you see what a gallant\r\narmy these worthy gentlemen here present and I have gathered\r\ntogether, at a time when it could hardly be expected that any number\r\ndurst meet together: these men have come out to serve his majesty,\r\nat the hazard of their lives and all that is dear to them: I hope,\r\ntherefore, you will give them all the encouragement to do their duty\r\nthat lies in your power.” Scarcely had these words been uttered\r\nwhen Sir George Munro, who had come over with Middleton from France\r\nto act as his lieutenant-general, started up from his seat, and\r\naddressing himself to the earl, swore by G-- that the men he had\r\nthat day seen were nothing but a number of thieves and robbers, and\r\nthat ere long he would bring a very different set of men into the\r\nfield. These imprudent observations called up Glengarry, but he was\r\nrestrained by Glencairn, who said that he was more concerned in\r\nthe affront put upon the army by Munro than he was, and, turning\r\nto Munro, he thus addressed him:--“You, Sir, are a base liar; for\r\nthey are neither thieves nor robbers, but brave gentlemen and good\r\nsoldiers.” A meeting took place in consequence early next morning\r\nbetween Glencairn and Munro, about two miles to the south of Dornoch,\r\nwhen the latter was severely wounded. The parties then returned to\r\nhead-quarters, when Glencairn was put under arrest in his chamber, by\r\norders of Middleton, and his sword taken from him.\r\n\r\nThe partiality thus shown to Munro, who was the aggressor, and who\r\nhad sent the challenge to Glencairn, was exceedingly mortifying to\r\nthe earl, which being followed by another affair which soon took\r\nplace, and in which the same partiality was displayed, made him\r\nresolve to retire from the army. The occurrence was this:--A dispute\r\nhaving taken place on the merits of the recent quarrel between a\r\nCaptain Livingston, a friend of Munro, and a gentleman of the name\r\nof Lindsay, who had accompanied Lord Napier from the continent, in\r\nwhich Livingston maintained that Munro had acted properly, and the\r\ncontrary insisted upon by Lindsay; mutual challenges were given, and\r\nthe parties met on the links of Dornoch to decide the dispute by the\r\nsword. Lindsay, being a superior swordsman, run Livingston through\r\nthe heart at the first thrust, and he expired immediately. Lindsay\r\nwas immediately apprehended, and although Glencairn, backed by other\r\nofficers, used every exertion to save him, he was brought to trial\r\nbefore a court-martial, by order of Middleton, and condemned to be\r\nshot at the cross of Dornoch, a sentence which was carried into\r\nexecution the same day.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate disputes divided the officers of the army into two\r\nparties, and afforded but a sorry prognostic of the prospects of the\r\nroyalists. Glencairn, no longer able to curb his displeasure, slipped\r\noff about a fortnight after Lindsay’s death, with his own troop of\r\nhorse, and a few gentlemen volunteers--100 horse in all--and took the\r\ndirection of Assynt. The laird of Assynt, who had betrayed Montrose,\r\non the arrival of Glencairn’s party on his lands, offered to assist\r\nhim to secure the passes, so as to prevent him from being overtaken\r\nthat night, of which offer Glencairn, though distrustful of Macleod,\r\nagreed to accept. Middleton indeed sent a party in pursuit, but they\r\ndid not come up with Glencairn, who reached Kintail the following\r\nday, where he was well received by the Earl of Seaforth’s people. He\r\nremained there a few days, and afterwards traversed the Highlands\r\ntill he arrived at Killin, at the head of Loch Tay, where he was\r\nsuccessively joined by Sir George Maxwell, the Earl of Selkirk,\r\nand Lord Forrester, each of whom brought a small party of horse\r\nalong with him, by which additions his force was increased to 400\r\nhorsemen. The earl now appears, for the first time, to have seen the\r\nimpropriety of his conduct in withdrawing from the army; but as he\r\ncould not endure the idea of returning himself, he endeavoured to\r\nmake some reparation by sending this body north to join Middleton,\r\nand sought a retreat with the laird of Luss at his castle of Rosedoe,\r\nwhen he despatched some officers to raise men in the lowlands for the\r\nking’s service.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Monk had returned to Scotland, and had brought along\r\nwith him a strong reinforcement of troops from England, with which he\r\njoined Morgan in the north, and marched directly into the Highlands\r\nin search of Middleton. It was the intention of the latter to have\r\nremained for some time in the Highlands, to have collected all the\r\nforces he possibly could, to make occasional descents upon the\r\nlowlands, and by marches and countermarches to have distracted the\r\nenemy; but the advance of Monk into the very bosom of the Highlands,\r\nwith a large army, frustrated his design. Middleton soon found\r\nhimself sorely pressed by his able adversary, who brought forward his\r\narmy in separate divisions, yet not so isolated as not to be able\r\nto support each other in case of attack. In an attempt to elude his\r\npursuers, Middleton was surprised in a defile near Lochgarry, by one\r\nof these divisions under the command of Morgan. His men were either\r\nslain or dispersed, and he himself escaped with difficulty. The\r\nchiefs of the insurrection immediately made their peace with Monk,\r\nwho treated them with great lenity.[458]\r\n\r\nThere was one chief, however, whom Monk could neither bribe, cajole,\r\nnor threaten into submission; this was the brave and intractable Sir\r\nEwen or Evan Cameron of Lochiel in the north-west of Argyleshire, now\r\nabout 25 years of age. Having been left an orphan, he was brought\r\nup till his 18th year under the care of the Marquis of Argyle, who,\r\nendeavouring to instil into him the unsavoury principles of the\r\nCovenanters, put him to school at Inverary under the guardianship of\r\na gentleman of his own principles. “But young Lochiel preferred the\r\nsports of the field to the labours of the school,” and Argyle finding\r\nhim totally intractable and utterly disgusted with covenanting\r\nprinciples, allowed him to return to Lochaber, to head his clan in\r\nthe 18th year of his age. In 1651, Charles II. having written to\r\nLochiel inviting him and his clan to take arms and come to the aid\r\nof his country and his sovereign, he, early in spring 1652, was the\r\nfirst to join Glencairn’s expedition.\r\n\r\nMonk left no method untried to induce Lochiel to submit, but, in\r\nspite of his friends’ entreaties, he refused to lay down his arms.\r\nMonk, finding all his attempts useless, resolved to plant a garrison\r\nat Inverlochy, (now Fort William,) in order to keep the country in\r\nawe and the chief at home. Lochiel resolved that Monk should find it\r\nno easy matter to accomplish his task, and took up his station at\r\nAchdalew, 3 miles west of Inverlochy, on the north side of Loch Eil.\r\nHe kept spies in and around the garrison, who informed him of all\r\nthat was going on. Lochiel, having been informed that the governor\r\nwas about to despatch 300 of his men, in two vessels, westward, to\r\ncut down wood and carry off cattle, resolved that they “should pay\r\nwell for every tree and every hide.” He had at the time only 38 men\r\nbeside him, the rest having been sent off to secure their cattle and\r\nother goods. In spite of the disparity of numbers, he resolved to\r\nwatch and attack the governor’s men at a favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\n“The Camerons being some more than 30 in number, armed partly with\r\nmusquets, and partly with bows, kept up their pieces and arrows\r\ntill their very muzzles and points almost touched their enemies’\r\nbreasts, when the very first fire took down above 30. They then\r\nlaid on with their swords, and laid about with incredible fury. The\r\nEnglish defended themselves with their musquets and bayonets with\r\ngreat bravery, but to little purpose. The skirmish continued long\r\nand obstinate: at last the English gave way, and retreated towards\r\nthe ship, with their faces to the enemy, fighting with astonishing\r\nresolution. But Lochiel, to prevent their flight, commanded two or\r\nthree of his men to run before, and from behind a bush to make a\r\nnoise, as if there was another party of Highlanders to intercept\r\ntheir retreat. This took so effectually, that they stopped, and\r\nanimated by rage, madness, and despair, they renewed the skirmish\r\nwith greater fury than ever, and wanted nothing but proper arms to\r\nmake Lochiel repent of his stratagem. They were at last, however,\r\nforced to give way, and betake themselves to their heels; the\r\nCamerons pursued them chin deep in the sea; 138 were counted dead of\r\nthe English, and of the Camerons only 5 were killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel.--From a rare print in the\r\ncollection of W. F. Watson, Esq., Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\n“In this engagement, Lochiel himself had several wonderful escapes.\r\nIn the retreat of the English, one of the strongest and bravest\r\nof the officers retired behind a bush, when he observed Lochiel\r\npursuing, and seeing him unaccompanied with any, he leaped out,\r\nand thought him his prey. They met one another with equal fury. The\r\ncombat was long, and doubtful. The English gentleman had by far\r\nthe advantage in strength and size; but Lochiel exceeding him in\r\nnimbleness and agility, in the end tript the sword out of his hand:\r\nupon which, his antagonist flew upon him with amazing rapidity; they\r\nclosed, and wrestled till both fell to the ground in each other’s\r\narms. The English officer got above Lochiel, and pressed him hard;\r\nbut stretching forth his neck by attempting to disengage himself,\r\nLochiel, who by this time had his hands at liberty, with his left\r\nhand seized him by the collar, and jumping at his extended throat,\r\nhe bit it with his teeth quite through, and kept such a hold of his\r\ngrip, that he brought away his mouth full; this, he said, was the\r\nsweetest bite he ever had in his life time. Immediately afterwards,\r\nwhen continuing the pursuit after that encounter was over, he found\r\nhis men chin deep in the sea; he quickly followed them, and observing\r\na fellow on deck aiming his piece at him, plunged into the sea,\r\nand escaped, but so narrowly that the hair on the back part of his\r\nhead was cut, and a little of the skin ruffled. In a little while\r\na similar attempt was made to shoot him: his foster-brother threw\r\nhimself before him, and received the shot in his mouth and breast,\r\npreferring his chief’s life to his own.”[459]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMERON OF LOCHIEL. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nAfter Lochiel had joined General Middleton, he heard that the\r\ngovernor of Inverlochy, taking advantage of his absence, was cutting\r\ndown the woods and collecting all the provisions he could lay hold\r\nof. Middleton allowed him to return to Lochaber, but with only 150\r\nmen. He soon found that the information was quite correct, and in\r\norder to obtain revenge, on the day after his arrival, he posted his\r\nmen in different parts of a wood, about a mile from the garrison, to\r\nwhich the soldiers resorted every day, to cut down and bring in wood.\r\nLochiel soon observed upwards of 400 approaching the wood, and at the\r\nmost favourable moment gave his men the signal of attack. A terrible\r\nslaughter ensued among the governor’s men; 100 fell on the spot,\r\nand the pursuit was carried on to the very walls of the garrison.\r\nThe officers were the only persons who resisted, and not one of them\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nLochiel, in this manner, continued for a long time to harass the\r\ngarrison, frequently cutting off small detachments, partly by\r\nstratagem and partly by force, until the garrison became so wary\r\nthat they ultimately gave him few opportunities of pouncing upon\r\nthem. Even after Middleton and the other chiefs had capitulated and\r\ncome to terms, Lochiel refused to give in. At last, however, after\r\nlong cajoling, the obstinate chief was induced to come to terms, the\r\nMarquis of Argyle becoming his surety. He was asked simply to give\r\nhis word of honour to live in peace, on which condition, he and his\r\nclan were allowed to keep their arms as before the war broke out.\r\nReparation was to be made to Lochiel and his tenants, for whatever\r\nlosses they had sustained from the garrison, and an indemnity was\r\ngranted for all past offences. In fact, the treaty was a very liberal\r\nbribe to Lochiel to be quiet. All that was demanded of Lochiel was,\r\nthat he and his clan should lay down their arms in the name of\r\nCharles II., before the governor of Inverlochy, and take them up in\r\nthe name of the Commonwealth, no mention being made of the Protector;\r\npromising at the same time to do his best to make his clan behave\r\nthemselves.[460]\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place in a History of the Highlands to enter into\r\na detailed account of the general history of Scotland during the\r\nCommonwealth, and of the various intrigues for the restoration of\r\nCharles II. There appears to have been no events of any importance\r\nduring this period in the Highlands, which at that time were so\r\nremote and inaccessible as to be almost beyond the influence of the\r\nmany wise measures introduced by Cromwell for the government of\r\nScotland, as well as the by no means beneficial strictness of the\r\npresbyterian clergy. Baillie[461] thus sadly describes the state of\r\nsome of the noble families of Scotland about this time: “The country\r\nlies very quiet; it is exceeding poor; trade is nought; the English\r\nhas all the moneys. Our noble families are almost gone: Lennox has\r\nlittle in Scotland unsold; Hamilton’s estate, except Arran and the\r\nBaronrie of Hamilton, is sold; Argyle can pay little annual rent for\r\nseven or eight hundred thousand merks; and he is no more drowned in\r\ndebt than public hatred, almost of all, both Scottish and English;\r\nthe Gordons are gone; the Douglasses little better; Eglintoun and\r\nGlencairn on the brink of breaking; many of our chief families\r\nestates are cracking; nor is there any appearance of any human relief\r\nfor the time. What is become of the king and his family we do not\r\nknow.” Nicoll[462] writes in the same strain: “The condition of this\r\nnation of Scotland yet remains sad, by reason of poverty and heavy\r\nburdens.” “At the same time,” says Dr. Chambers,[463] “that so great\r\npoverty prevailed, there was such a protection to life and property\r\nas had never before been known. It was not we believe without cause,\r\nthat the famous Colonel Desborough, in a speech in the House of\r\nCommons (March 17th, 1659), made it a boast for his party, that a man\r\nmay ride over all Scotland, with a switch in his hand and a hundred\r\npounds in his pocket, which he could not have done these five hundred\r\nyears.” In some of the letters sent home by the English soldiery,\r\nwe get a slight glimpse into the condition of the Highlands at this\r\ntime, which shows that the people generally had made but little\r\nadvance in civilization. Their houses, we are told, were built of\r\nearth and turf, and were so low that the horsemen sometimes rode over\r\nthem; the people generally, both men and women, wore plaids about\r\ntheir middles; they were “simple and ignorant in the things of God,”\r\nand some of them as brutish as heathens; nevertheless “some did hear\r\nthe English preachers with great attention and groaning.”[464]\r\n\r\nBy the tact and management of General Monk, who gradually detached\r\nhimself from the cause of the parliament, and espoused that of the\r\nexiled king, and a few other royalists, the Long Parliament, now\r\nreduced to a “Rump,” after having sat nineteen years and a half,\r\ndissolved itself by its own act, on the 16th of March, 1660. A new\r\nparliament, in which the cavaliers and moderate presbyterians had the\r\nmajority, met on the 25th of April, and carried out the wishes of\r\nthe nation, by inviting his majesty to come and take possession of\r\nhis inheritance. The king was not long in obeying the invitation. He\r\nwas received at Dover by Monk, at the head of the nobility, whence\r\nhe proceeded to London, which he entered on the 29th of May, 1660,\r\namidst the acclamations of the citizens.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[424] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 42.\r\n\r\n[425] Idem, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[426] Whitelock, p. 465.\r\n\r\n[427] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 86.\r\n\r\n[428] Idem, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[429] Whitelock.\r\n\r\n[430] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 87.\r\n\r\n[431] Balfour.\r\n\r\n[432] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 89.\r\n\r\n[433] Whitelock.\r\n\r\n[434] Idem, p. 483.\r\n\r\n[435] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 96.\r\n\r\n[436] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 97.\r\n\r\n[437] _Cromwelliana_, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[438] Burnet’s _Own Times_, vol. i. p. 54.\r\n\r\n[439] Whitelock, p. 471.\r\n\r\n[440] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 115.\r\n\r\n[441] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 129.\r\n\r\n[442] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[443] Idem, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[444] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 136.\r\n\r\n[445] Idem, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[446] Woodrow, _Introduction_, iii.\r\n\r\n[447] Balfour, vol. iv. p. 193-195.\r\n\r\n[448] Balfour, vol. iv. pp. 210-212.\r\n\r\n[449] Leicester’s _Journal_, p. 110.

So, weill laughin\r\nat by the heighlanders, he wes forced to returne with penurey\r\naneuche, werey glade all of them that ther lives were saved.”--Vol.\r\niv. pp. 349-50.\r\n\r\n[455] “And I verily believe there were more souls converted to\r\nChrist in that short period of time, than in any season since the\r\nReformation, though of treeple its duration.

The Highlands now are generally\r\nas accessible as the lowlands; the manners, speech, and occupations\r\nof the inhabitants are becoming more and more assimilated to those\r\nof their lowland neighbours, and to all appearance, in a very\r\nshort time, there will remain little or nothing to distinguish the\r\nScottish Celt from the Saxon. Although this change has by no means\r\nbeen altogether to the advantage of the Highlander,--although many\r\nof the vices as well as the virtues of civilization have been forced\r\nupon him, still, for the sake of the community at large, the change\r\ncannot be regretted, and it is only to be desired that the lowlanders\r\nin turn may be brought to admire and imitate the noble virtues of\r\ntheir northern neighbours, their courage, fidelity, reverence,\r\nself-respect, and love of independence.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Highlanders presents us with a bold and\r\nhardy race of men, filled with a romantic attachment to their native\r\nmountains and glens, cherishing an exalted spirit of independence,\r\nand firmly bound together in septs or clans by the ties of kindred.\r\nHaving little intercourse with the rest of the world, and pent up for\r\nmany centuries within the Grampian range, the Highlanders acquired\r\na peculiar character, and retained or adopted habits and manners\r\ndiffering widely from those of their lowland neighbours. “The ideas\r\nand employments, which their seclusion from the world rendered\r\nhabitual,--the familiar contemplation of the most sublime objects\r\nof nature,--the habit of concentrating their affections within the\r\nnarrow precincts of their own glens, or the limited circle of their\r\nown kinsmen,--and the necessity of union and self-dependence in all\r\ndifficulties and dangers, combined to form a peculiar and original\r\ncharacter. A certain romantic sentiment, the offspring of deep and\r\ncherished feeling, strong attachment to their country and kindred,\r\nand a consequent disdain of submission to strangers, formed the\r\ncharacter of independence; while an habitual contempt of danger was\r\nnourished by their solitary musings, of which the honour of their\r\nclan, and a long descent from brave and warlike ancestors, formed the\r\nfrequent theme. Thus, their exercises, their amusements, their modes\r\nof subsistence, their motives of action, their prejudices and their\r\nsuperstitions, became characteristic, permanent, and peculiar.\r\n\r\n“Firmness and decision, fertility in resources, ardour in friendship,\r\nand a generous enthusiasm, were the result of such a situation,\r\nsuch modes of life, and such habits of thought. Feeling themselves\r\nseparated by Nature from the rest of mankind, and distinguished by\r\ntheir language, their habits, their manners, and their dress, they\r\nconsidered themselves the original possessors of the country, and\r\nregarded the Saxons of the Lowlands as strangers and intruders.”[466]\r\n\r\nLike their Celtic ancestors, the Highlanders were tall, robust, and\r\nwell formed. Early marriages were unknown among them, and it was rare\r\nfor a female who was of a puny stature and delicate constitution to\r\nbe honoured with a husband. The following observations of Martin\r\non the inhabitants of some of the western islands may be generally\r\napplied to the Highlanders:--“They are not obliged to art in forming\r\ntheir bodies, for Nature never fails to act her part bountifully to\r\nthem; perhaps there is no part of the habitable globe where so few\r\nbodily imperfections are to be seen, nor any children that go more\r\nearly. I have observed several of them walk alone before they were\r\nten months old: they are bathed all over every morning and evening,\r\nsome in cold, some in warm water; but the latter is most commonly\r\nused, and they wear nothing strait about them. The mother generally\r\nsuckles the child, failing of which, a nurse is provided, for they\r\nseldom bring up any by hand: they give new born infants fresh butter\r\nto take away the _meconium_, and this they do for several days; they\r\ntaste neither sugar, nor cinnamon, nor have they any daily allowance\r\nof sack bestowed on them, as the custom is elsewhere, nor is the\r\nnurse allowed to taste ale. The generality wear neither shoes nor\r\nstockings before they are seven, eight, or ten years old; and many\r\namong them wear no night-caps before they are sixteen years old, and\r\nupwards; some use none all their life-time, and these are not so\r\nliable to headaches as others who keep their heads warm.”[467]\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the indifference of the Highlanders to cold, reference\r\nhas been made to their often sleeping in the open air during the\r\nseverity of winter. Burt, who resided among them and wrote in the\r\nyear 1725, relates that he has seen the places which they occupied,\r\nand which were known by being free from the snow that deeply covered\r\nthe ground, except where the heat of their bodies had melted it. The\r\nsame writer represents a chief as giving offence to his clan by his\r\ndegeneracy in forming the snow into a pillow before he lay down.\r\n“The Highlanders were so accustomed to sleep in the open air, that\r\nthe want of shelter was of little consequence to them. It was usual\r\nbefore they lay down to dip their plaids in water, by which the cloth\r\nwas less pervious to the wind, and the heat of their bodies produced\r\na warmth, which the woollen, if dry, could not afford. An old man\r\ninformed me, that a favourite place of repose was under a cover of\r\nthick overhanging heath. The Highlanders, in 1745, could scarcely be\r\nprevailed on to use tents. It is not long since those who frequented\r\nLawrence fair, St. Sair’s, and other markets in the Garioch of\r\nAberdeenshire, gave up the practice of sleeping in the open fields.\r\nThe horses being on these occasions left to shift for themselves, the\r\ninhabitants no longer have their crop spoiled, by their ‘upthrough\r\nneighbours,’ with whom they had often bloody contentions, in\r\nconsequence of these unceremonious visits.”[468]\r\n\r\nAs to the antiquity of the picturesque Highland costume, there\r\nhas been considerable discussion. Till of late years the general\r\nopinion was that the plaid, philibeg, and bonnet, formed the ancient\r\ngarb of the Highlanders, but some writers have maintained that the\r\nphilibeg is of modern invention, and that the truis, which consisted\r\nof breeches and stockings in one piece, and made to fit close to\r\nthe limbs, was the old costume. That the truis is very ancient\r\nin the Highlands is probable, but it was chiefly confined to the\r\nhigher classes, who always used it when travelling on horseback.\r\nAt p. 4 of this volume, fig. 2 shows a very early form of Highland\r\ncostume; and although rude, it bears a strong resemblance to the more\r\nmodern belted plaid. In an appendix to this chapter will be found\r\na collection of extracts from various writers, reaching back to a\r\nvery early period, and containing allusions to the peculiar form and\r\npattern of the Highland dress, proving that, in its simple form, it\r\nlays claim to considerable antiquity. For these extracts we are\r\nindebted to the admirable publication of the Iona club, entitled\r\n_Collectanea de rebus Albanicis_.\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of the various parts of the Highland\r\ncostume:--The Breacan-feile, literally, the variegated or chequered\r\ncovering, is the original garb of the Highlanders, and forms the\r\nchief part of the costume; but it is now almost laid aside in its\r\nsimple form. It consisted of a plain piece of tartan from four to\r\nsix yards in length, and two yards broad. The plaid was adjusted\r\nwith much nicety, and made to surround the waist in great plaits or\r\nfolds, and was firmly bound round the loins with a leathern belt in\r\nsuch a manner that the lower side fell down to the middle of the knee\r\njoint, and then, while there were the foldings behind, the cloth\r\nwas double before. The upper part was then fastened on the left\r\nshoulder with a large brooch or pin, so as to display to the most\r\nadvantage the tastefulness of the arrangement, the two ends being\r\nsometimes suffered to hang down; but that on the right side, which\r\nwas necessarily the longest, was more usually tucked under the belt.\r\nIn battle, in travelling, and on other occasions, this added much to\r\nthe commodiousness and grace of the costume. By this arrangement,\r\nthe right arm of the wearer was left uncovered and at full liberty;\r\nbut in wet or very cold weather the plaid was thrown loose, by which\r\nboth body and shoulders were covered. To give free exercise for both\r\narms in case of need, the plaid was fastened across the breast by a\r\nlarge silver bodkin, or circular brooch, often enriched with precious\r\nstones, or imitations of them, having mottos engraved, consisting of\r\nallegorical and figurative sentences.[469] Macculloch, we think, in\r\nhis jaunty off-hand way, has very happily conjectured what is likely\r\nto have been the origin of this part of Highland dress. “It does\r\nnot seem very difficult,” he says,[470] “to trace the origin of the\r\nbelted plaid; the true and characteristic dress from which the other\r\nmodifications have been derived. It is precisely, as has been often\r\nsaid, the expedient of a savage, unable or unwilling to convert the\r\nweb of cloth which he had procured, into a more convenient shape.\r\nRolling one extremity round his body, the remainder was thrown over\r\nhis shoulder, to be used as occasion should require, in covering the\r\nrest of his person.” It indeed appears to be a well authenticated\r\nfact that the _kilt_ or _philibeg_, as distinct from the belted\r\nplaid, is a comparatively modern article of dress in the Highlands,\r\nhaving been the invention of an Englishman who, while superintending\r\nsome works in Lochaber about 1728, induced his workmen to separate\r\nthat part of the ancient garment which came over the shoulder, and\r\nwhich encumbered their movements, from the part which surrounded the\r\nloins, retaining only the latter.\r\n\r\nAs the _breacan_ was without pockets, a purse, called _sporan_ by the\r\nHighlanders, was fastened or tied in front, and was made of goats’\r\nor badgers’ skin, sometimes of leather, and was neither so large nor\r\nso gaudy as that now in use. People of rank or condition ornamented\r\ntheir purses sometimes with a silver mouthpiece, and fixed the\r\ntassels and other appendages with silver fastenings; but in general\r\nthe mouthpieces were of brass, and the cords employed were of leather\r\nneatly interwoven. The sporan was divided into several compartments.\r\nOne of these was used for holding a watch, another money, &c. The\r\nHighlanders even carried their shot in the sporan occasionally, but\r\nfor this purpose they commonly carried a wallet at the right side,\r\nin which they also stowed when travelling, a quantity of meal and\r\nother provisions. This military knapsack was called _dorlach_ by the\r\nHighlanders.\r\n\r\nThe use of stockings and shoes is comparatively of recent date among\r\nthe Highlanders. Originally they encased their feet in a piece of\r\nuntanned hide, cut to the shape and size of the foot, and drawn close\r\ntogether with leather thongs, a practice which is observed even at\r\nthe present day by the descendants of the Scandinavian settlers in\r\nthe Shetland islands, where they are called _rivelins_; but this\r\nmode of covering the feet was far from being general, as the greater\r\npart of the population went barefooted. Such was the state of the\r\nHighlanders who fought at Killiecrankie; and Burt, who wrote in the\r\nearly part of the 18th century, says that he visited a well-educated\r\nand polite Laird, in the north, who wore neither shoes nor stockings,\r\nnor had any covering for his feet. A modern writer observes, that\r\nwhen the Highland regiments were embodied during the French and\r\nAmerican wars, hundreds of the men were brought down without either\r\nstockings or shoes.\r\n\r\nThe stockings, which were originally of the same pattern with the\r\nplaid, were not knitted, but were cut out of the web, as is still\r\ndone in the case of those worn by the common soldiers in the Highland\r\nregiments; but a great variety of fancy patterns are now in use.\r\nThe garters were of rich colours, and broad, and were wrought in a\r\nsmall loom, which is now almost laid aside. Their texture was very\r\nclose, which prevented them from wrinkling, and displayed the pattern\r\nto its full extent. On the occasion of an anniversary cavalcade,\r\non Michaelmas day, by the inhabitants of the island of North Uist,\r\nwhen persons of all ranks and of both sexes appeared on horseback,\r\nthe women, in return for presents of knives and purses given them by\r\nthe men, presented the latter “with a pair of fine garters of divers\r\ncolours.”[471]\r\n\r\nThe bonnet, of which there were various patterns, completed the\r\nnational garb, and those who could afford had also, as essential\r\naccompaniments, a dirk, with a knife and fork stuck in the side of\r\nthe sheath, and sometimes a spoon, together with a pair of steel\r\npistols.\r\n\r\nThe garb, however, differed materially in quality and in ornamental\r\ndisplay, according to the rank or ability of the wearer. The short\r\ncoat and waistcoat worn by the wealthy, were adorned with silver\r\nbuttons, tassels, embroidery, or lace, according to the taste of\r\nthe wearer or fashion of the times, and even “among the better and\r\nmore provident of the lower ranks,” as General Stewart remarks,\r\nsilver buttons were frequently found, which had come down to them\r\nas an inheritance of long descent. The same author observes, that\r\nthe reason for wearing these buttons, which were of a large size and\r\nof solid silver, was, that their value might defray the expense of\r\na decent funeral in the event of the wearer falling in battle, or\r\ndying in a strange country and at a distance from his friends. The\r\nofficers of Mackay’s and Munroe’s Highland regiments, who served\r\nunder Gustavus Adolphus in the wars of 1626 and 1638, in addition to\r\nrich buttons, wore a gold chain round the neck, to secure the owner,\r\nin case of being wounded or taken prisoner, good treatment, or as\r\npayment for future ransom.[472]\r\n\r\nAlthough shoe buckles now form a part of the Highland costume, they\r\nwere unknown in the Highlands 150 years ago. The ancient Highlanders\r\ndid not wear neckcloths. Their shirts were of woollen cloth, and as\r\nlinen was long expensive, a considerable time elapsed before linen\r\nshirts came into general use. We have heard an old and intelligent\r\nHighlander remark, that rheumatism was almost, if not wholly, unknown\r\nin the Highlands until the introduction of linen shirts.\r\n\r\nIt is observed by General Stewart, that “among the circumstances\r\nwhich influenced the military character of the Highlanders, their\r\npeculiar garb was conspicuous, which, by its freedom and lightness,\r\nenabled them to use their limbs, and to handle their arms with ease\r\nand celerity, and to move with great speed when employed with either\r\ncavalry or light infantry. In the wars of Gustavus Adolphus, in\r\nthe civil wars of Charles I., and on various other occasions, they\r\nwere often mixed with the cavalry, affording to detached squadrons\r\nthe incalculable advantage of support from infantry, even in their\r\nmost rapid movements.” “I observed,” says the author of ‘Memoirs of\r\na Cavalier,’ speaking of the Scots army in 1640, “I observed that\r\nthese parties had always some foot with them, and yet if the horses\r\ngalloped or pushed on ever so forward, the foot were as forward as\r\nthey, which was an extraordinary advantage. These were those they\r\ncall Highlanders; they would run on foot with all their arms, and all\r\ntheir accoutrements, and kept very good order too, and kept pace with\r\nthe horses, let them go at what rate they would.”\r\n\r\nThe dress of the women seems to require some little notice. Till\r\nmarriage, or till they arrived at a certain age, they went with the\r\nhead bare, the hair being tied with bandages or some slight ornament,\r\nafter which they wore a head-dress, called the curch, made of linen,\r\nwhich was tied under the chin; but when a young woman lost her virtue\r\nand character she was obliged to wear a cap, and never afterwards to\r\nappear bare-headed. Martin’s observations on the dress of the females\r\nof the western islands may be taken as giving a pretty correct idea\r\nof that worn by those of the Highlands. “The women wore sleeves of\r\nscarlet cloth, closed at the end as men’s vests, with gold lace round\r\nthem, having plate buttons set with fine stones. The head-dress was\r\na fine kerchief of linen, strait about the head. The plaid was tied\r\nbefore on the breast, with a buckle of silver or brass, according\r\nto the quality of the person. I have seen some of the former of\r\none hundred merks value; the whole curiously engraved with various\r\nanimals. There was a lesser buckle which was worn in the middle of\r\nthe larger. It had in the centre a large piece of crystal, or some\r\nfiner stone, of a lesser size.” The plaid, which, with the exception\r\nof a few stripes of red, black, or blue, was white, reached from the\r\nneck almost to the feet; it was plaited, and was tied round the waist\r\nby a belt of leather, studded with small pieces of silver.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the tartan has been called in question by several\r\nwriters, who have maintained that it is of modern invention; but they\r\nhave given no proofs in support of their assertion. In the appendix\r\nto this chapter it will be seen that, as far back as the years 1538\r\nand 1597, mention is made of this species of cloth; and in the\r\naccount of charge and discharge of John, Bishop of Glasgow, Treasurer\r\nto King James III. in 1471, the following entries occur:--\r\n\r\n  “An elne and ane halve of blue tartane\r\n    to lyne his gowne of cloth of gold,      £1 10  6\r\n\r\n  “Four elne and ane halve of tartane for a\r\n    sparwurt abun his credill, price ane\r\n    elne, 10s.,                               2  5  0\r\n\r\n  “Halve ane elne of duble tartane to lyne\r\n    collars to her lady the Quene, price\r\n    8 shillings.”\r\n\r\nIt is not at all improbable that Joseph’s well-known “coat of many\r\ncolours” may have been somewhat of the same nature as tartan; and\r\nthe writer of the article TARTAN in _Chambers’s Encyclopædia_ says,\r\n“this is probably the oldest pattern ever woven; at all events the\r\nso-called shepherd’s plaid of Scotland is known to have a very remote\r\nantiquity amongst the eastern nations of the world.” It has been\r\nproved by Logan, from Diodorus, Pliny, and other ancient writers,\r\nthat variegated cloth was in common use for purposes of dress among\r\nthe continental Celts.\r\n\r\nWhen the great improvements in the process of dyeing by means of\r\nchemistry are considered, it will appear surprising, that without\r\nany knowledge of this art, and without the substances now employed,\r\nthe Highlanders should have been able, from the scanty materials\r\nwhich their country afforded, to produce the beautiful and lasting\r\ncolours which distinguish the old Highland tartan, some specimens\r\nof which are understood still to exist, and which retain much of\r\ntheir original brilliancy of colouring. “In dyeing and arranging\r\nthe various colours of their tartans, they displayed no small art\r\nand taste, preserving at the same time the distinctive patterns (or\r\nsets, as they were called) of the different clans, tribes, families,\r\nand districts. Thus, a Macdonald, a Campbell, a Mackenzie, &c., was\r\nknown by his plaid; and, in like manner, the Athole, Glenorchy, and\r\nother colours of different districts, were easily distinguishable.\r\nBesides those general divisions, industrious housewives had patterns,\r\ndistinguished by the set, superior quality, and fineness of cloth, or\r\nbrightness and variety of the colours. In those times, when mutual\r\nattachment and confidence subsisted between the proprietors and\r\noccupiers of land in the Highlands, the removal of tenants, except in\r\nremarkable cases, rarely occurred; and, consequently, it was easy to\r\npreserve and perpetuate any particular set or pattern, even among the\r\nlower orders.”[473]\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, in common with most other nations, were much\r\naddicted to superstition. The peculiar aspect of their country, in\r\nwhich nature appears in its wildest and most romantic features,\r\nexhibiting at a glance sharp and rugged mountains, with dreary\r\nwastes--wide-stretched lakes, and rapid torrents, over which\r\nthe thunders and lightnings, and tempests, and rains, of heaven,\r\nexhaust their terrific rage, wrought upon the creative powers of\r\nthe imagination, and from these appearances, the Highlanders “were\r\nnaturally led to ascribe every disaster to the influence of superior\r\npowers, in whose character the predominating feature necessarily was\r\nmalignity towards the human race.”[474]\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous and most malignant creature was the _kelpie_,\r\nor water-horse, which was supposed to allure women and children to\r\nhis subaqueous haunts, and there devour them. Sometimes he would\r\nswell the lake or torrent beyond its usual limits, and overwhelm\r\nthe unguarded traveller in the flood. The shepherd, as he sat upon\r\nthe brow of a rock in a summer’s evening, often fancied he saw this\r\nanimal dashing along the surface of the lake, or browsing on the\r\npasture-ground upon its verge.\r\n\r\nThe _urisks_, who were supposed to be of a condition somewhat\r\nintermediate between that of mortal men and spirits, “were a sort of\r\n_lubbary_ supernaturals, who, like the _brownies_ of England, could\r\nbe gained over by kind attentions to perform the drudgery of the\r\nfarm; and it was believed that many families in the Highlands had\r\none of the order attached to it.”[475] The urisks were supposed to\r\nlive dispersed over the Highlands, each having his own wild recess;\r\nbut they were said to hold stated assemblies in the celebrated cave\r\ncalled _Coire-nan-Uriskin_, situated near the base of Ben-Venue, in\r\nAberfoyle, on its northern shoulder. It overhangs Loch Katrine “in\r\nsolemn grandeur,” and is beautifully and faithfully described by Sir\r\nWalter Scott.[476]\r\n\r\nThe _urisks_, though generally inclined to mischief, were supposed\r\nto relax in their propensity, if kindly treated by the families\r\nwhich they haunted. They were even serviceable in some instances,\r\nand in this point of view were often considered an acquisition. Each\r\nfamily regularly set down a bowl of cream for its urisk, and even\r\nclothes were sometimes added. The urisk resented any omission or want\r\nof attention on the part of the family; and tradition says, that\r\nthe urisk of _Glaschoil_, a small farm about a mile to the west of\r\nBen-Venue, having been disappointed one night of his bowl of cream,\r\nafter performing the task allotted him, took his departure about\r\nday-break, uttering a horrible shriek, and never again returned.\r\n\r\nThe _Daoine Shith_, or _Shi’_ (_men of peace_), or as they are\r\nsometimes called, _Daoine matha_ (good men), come next to be noticed.\r\nDr. Graham considers the part of the popular superstitions of the\r\nHighlands which relates to these imaginary persons, and which is to\r\nthis day retained, as he observes, in some degree of purity, as “the\r\nmost beautiful and perfect branch of Highland mythology.”\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been generally supposed that the mythology of the\r\nDaoine Shi’ is the same as that respecting the fairies of England, as\r\nportrayed by Shakspeare, in the Midsummer Night’s Dream, and perhaps,\r\ntoo, of the Orientals, they differ essentially in many important\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe Daoine Shi’, or men of peace, who are the _fairies_ of the\r\nHighlanders, “though not absolutely malevolent, are believed to be\r\na peevish repining race of beings, who, possessing themselves but a\r\nscanty portion of happiness, are supposed to envy mankind their more\r\ncomplete and substantial enjoyments. They are supposed to enjoy, in\r\ntheir subterraneous recesses, a sort of shadowy happiness, a tinsel\r\ngrandeur, which, however, they would willingly exchange for the\r\nmore solid joys of mortals.”[477] Green was the colour of the dress\r\nwhich these men of peace always wore, and they were supposed to take\r\noffence when any of the mortal race presumed to wear their favourite\r\ncolour. The Highlanders ascribe the disastrous result of the battle\r\nof Killiecrankie to the circumstance of Viscount Dundee having been\r\ndressed in green on that ill-fated day. This colour is even yet\r\nconsidered ominous to those of his name who assume it.\r\n\r\nThe abodes of the Daoine Shi’ are supposed to be below grassy\r\neminences or knolls, where, during the night, they celebrate their\r\nfestivities by the light of the moon, and dance to notes of the\r\nsoftest music.[478] Tradition reports that they have often allured\r\nsome of the human race into their subterraneous retreats, consisting\r\nof gorgeous apartments, and that they have been regaled with the most\r\nsumptuous banquets and delicious wines. Their females far exceed the\r\ndaughters of men in beauty. If any mortal shall be tempted to partake\r\nof their repast, or join in their pleasures, he at once forfeits\r\nthe society of his fellow-men, and is bound down irrevocably to the\r\ncondition of a Shi’ich, or man of peace.\r\n\r\n“A woman,” says a Highland tradition, “was conveyed, in days of\r\nyore, into the secret recesses of the men of peace. There she was\r\nrecognised by one who had formerly been an ordinary mortal, but who\r\nhad, by some fatality, become associated with the Shi’ichs. This\r\nacquaintance, still retaining some portion of human benevolence,\r\nwarned her of her danger, and counselled her, as she valued her\r\nliberty, to abstain from eating or drinking with them for a certain\r\nspace of time. She complied with the counsel of her friend; and\r\nwhen the period assigned was elapsed, she found herself again upon\r\nearth, restored to the society of mortals. It is added, that when she\r\nhad examined the viands which had been presented to her, and which\r\nhad appeared so tempting to the eye, they were found, now that the\r\nenchantment had been removed, to consist only of the refuse of the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nSome mortals, however, who had been so unhappy as to fall into the\r\nsnares of the Shi’ichs, are generally believed to have obtained a\r\nrelease from Fairyland, and to have been restored to the society of\r\ntheir friends. Ethert Brand, according to the legend, was released by\r\nthe intrepidity of his sister, as related by Sir Walter Scott in the\r\nfourth Canto of the Lady of the Lake:--\r\n\r\n      “She crossed him thrice that lady bold:\r\n        He rose beneath her hand,\r\n      The fairest knight on Scottish mould,\r\n        Her brother, Ethert Brand!”\r\n\r\nA recent tradition gives a similar story, except in its unfortunate\r\ncatastrophe, and is thus related by Dr. Patrick Graham in his\r\n“Sketches of Perthshire.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Robert Kirk, the first translator of the Psalms into Gaelic\r\nverse, had formerly been minister at Balquidder, and died minister\r\nof Aberfoyle, in 1688, at the early age of 42. His gravestone, which\r\nmay be seen near the east end of the church of Aberfoyle, bears the\r\ninscription which is given underneath.[479] He was walking, it is\r\nsaid, one evening in his night-gown, upon the little eminence to the\r\nwest of the present manse, which is still reckoned a _Dun_-shi’. He\r\nfell down dead, as was believed; but this was not his fate:--\r\n\r\n      “It was between the night and day,\r\n        When the fairy king has power,\r\n      That he sunk down (but not) in sinful fray,\r\n      And, ’twixt life and death, was snatched away,\r\n        To the joyless Elfin bower.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kirk was the near relation of Mr. Grahame of Duchray. Shortly\r\nafter his funeral, he appeared in the dress in which he had sunk\r\ndown, to a mutual relation of his own and of Duchray. “Go,” said\r\nhe to him, “to my cousin Duchray, and tell him that I am not dead;\r\nI fell down in a swoon, and was carried into Fairy-land, where I\r\nnow am. Tell him, that when he and my friends are assembled at the\r\nbaptism of my child--for he had left his wife pregnant--I will\r\nappear in the room, and that if he throws the knife which he holds\r\nin his hand over my head, I will be released, and restored to human\r\nsociety.” The man, it seems, neglected for some time, to deliver the\r\nmessage. Mr. Kirk appeared to him a second time, threatening to haunt\r\nhim night and day till he executed his commission, which at length\r\nhe did. The day of the baptism arrived. They were seated at table.\r\nMr. Kirk entered, but the laird of Duchray, by some unaccountable\r\nfatality, neglected to perform the prescribed ceremony. Mr. Kirk\r\nretired by another door, and was seen no more. It is firmly believed\r\nthat he is, at this day, in Fairy-land.\r\n\r\nAnother legend in a similar strain is also given as communicated by\r\na very intelligent young lady:--\r\n\r\n“A young man roaming one day through the forest, observed a number\r\nof persons, all dressed in green, issuing from one of those round\r\neminences which are commonly accounted fairy hills. Each of them, in\r\nsuccession, called upon a person by name, _to fetch his horse_. A\r\ncaparisoned steed instantly appeared; they all mounted, and sallied\r\nforth into the regions of the air. The young man, like Ali Baba in\r\nthe Arabian Nights, ventured to pronounce the same name, and called\r\nfor his horse. The steed immediately appeared; he mounted, and was\r\nsoon joined to the fairy choir. He remained with them for a year,\r\ngoing about with them to fairs and weddings, and feasting, though\r\nunseen by mortal eyes, on the victuals that were exhibited on those\r\noccasions. They had, one day, gone to a wedding, where the cheer\r\nwas abundant. During the feast the bridegroom _sneezed_. The young\r\nman, according to the usual custom, said, ‘God bless you.’ The\r\nfairies were offended at the pronunciation of the sacred name, and\r\nassured him, that if he dared to repeat it they would punish him.\r\nThe bridegroom _sneezed_ a second time. He repeated his _blessing_;\r\nthey threatened more than tremendous vengeance. He _sneezed_ a third\r\ntime; he _blessed_ him as before. The fairies were enraged; they\r\ntumbled him from a precipice, but he found himself unhurt, and was\r\nrestored to the society of mortals.”\r\n\r\nThe Shi’ichs, or men of peace, are supposed to have a design\r\nagainst new-born children, and women in childbed, whom, it is still\r\nuniversally believed, they sometimes carry off into their secret\r\nrecesses. To prevent this abduction, women in childbed are closely\r\nwatched, and are not left alone, even for a single moment, till the\r\nchild is baptized, when the Shi’ichs are supposed to have no more\r\npower over them.[480]\r\n\r\nThe following tradition will illustrate this branch of the popular\r\nsuperstition respecting the Shi’ichs: A woman whose new-born child\r\nhad been conveyed by them into their secret abodes, was also carried\r\nthither herself, to remain, however, only until she should suckle\r\nher infant. She one day, during this period, observed the Shi’ichs\r\nbusily employed in mixing various ingredients in a boiling cauldron;\r\nand as soon as the composition was prepared, she remarked that they\r\nall carefully anointed their eyes with it, laying the remainder\r\naside for future use. In a moment when they were all absent, she\r\nalso attempted to anoint her eyes with the precious drug, but had\r\ntime to apply it to one eye only, when the Daoine Shi’ returned. But\r\nwith that eye, she was henceforth enabled to see every thing as it\r\nreally passed in their secret abodes; she saw every object, not as\r\nshe had hitherto done, in deceptive splendour and elegance, but in\r\nits genuine colours and form. The gaudy ornaments of the apartment\r\nwere reduced to the naked walls of a gloomy cavern. Soon after,\r\nhaving discharged her office, she was dismissed to her own home.\r\nStill, however, she retained the faculty of seeing with her medicated\r\neye, every thing that was done, any where in her presence, by the\r\ndeceptive art of the order. One day, amidst a throng of people, she\r\nchanced to observe the Shi’ich, or man of peace, in whose possession\r\nshe had left her child, though to every other eye invisible. Prompted\r\nby maternal affection, she inadvertently accosted him, and began to\r\ninquire after the welfare of her child. The man of peace, astonished\r\nat thus being recognised by one of mortal race, sternly demanded how\r\nshe had been enabled to discover him. Awed by the terrible frown of\r\nhis countenance, she acknowledged what she had done. He spat into her\r\neye, and extinguished it for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Shi’ichs, it is still believed, have a great propensity for\r\nattending funerals and weddings, and other public entertainments, and\r\neven fairs. They have an object in this; for it is believed that,\r\nthough invisible to mortal eyes, they are busily employed in carrying\r\naway the substantial articles and provisions which are exhibited, in\r\nplace of which they substitute shadowy forms, having the appearance\r\nof the things so purloined. And so strong was the belief in this\r\nmythology, even till a recent period, that some persons are old\r\nenough to remember, that some individuals would not eat any thing\r\npresented on the occasions alluded to, because they believed it to be\r\nunsubstantial and hurtful.\r\n\r\nAs the Shi’ichs are supposed to be present on all occasions, though\r\ninvisible, the Highlanders, whenever they allude to them, do so in\r\nterms of respect. This is, however, done as seldom as possible;\r\nand when the Shi’ichs are casually mentioned, the Highlanders add\r\nsome propitiatory expression of praise to avert their displeasure,\r\nwhich they greatly dread. This reserve and dread on the part of the\r\nHighlanders, is said to arise from the peevish envy and jealousy\r\nwhich the Shi’ichs are believed to entertain towards the human race.\r\nAlthough believed to be always present, watching the doings of\r\nmortals, the Shi’ichs are supposed to be more particular in their\r\nattendance on Friday, on which day they are believed to possess very\r\nextensive influence. They are believed to be especially jealous of\r\nwhat may be said concerning them; and if they are at all spoken of\r\non that day, which is never done without great reluctance, the\r\nHighlanders uniformly style them the _Daoine matha_, or _good men_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the traditionary legends of the Highlanders, the\r\nShi’ichs are believed to be of both sexes; and it is the general\r\nopinion among the Highlanders that men have sometimes cohabited with\r\nfemales of the Shi’ich race, who are in consequence called Leannan\r\nShi’. These mistresses are believed to be very kind to their mortal\r\nparamours, by revealing to them the knowledge of many things both\r\npresent and future, which were concealed from the rest of mankind.\r\nThe knowledge of the medicinal virtues of many herbs, it is related,\r\nhas been obtained in this way from the Leannan Shi’. The Daoine Shi’\r\nof the other sex are said, in their turn, to have sometimes held\r\nintercourse with mistresses of mortal race.\r\n\r\nThis popular superstition relating to the Daoine Shi’, is supposed,\r\nwith good reason, to have taken its rise in the times of the Druids,\r\nor rather to have been invented by them after the overthrow of their\r\nhierarchy, for the purpose of preserving the existence of their\r\norder, after they had retreated for safety to caves and the deep\r\nrecesses of the forest. This idea receives some corroboration from\r\nthe Gaelic term, _Druidheachd_, which the Highlanders apply to the\r\ndeceptive power by which the men of peace are believed to impose\r\nupon the senses of mankind, “founded, probably, on the opinion\r\nentertained of old, concerning the magical powers of the Druids.\r\nDeeply versed, according to Cæsar’s information, as the Druids were,\r\nin the higher departments of philosophy, and probably acquainted with\r\nelectricity, and various branches of chemistry, they might find it\r\neasy to excite the belief of their supernatural powers, in the minds\r\nof the uninitiated vulgar.”[481] The influence of this powerful order\r\nupon the popular belief was felt long after the supposed era of its\r\nextinction; for it was not until Christianity was introduced into\r\nthe Highlands, that the total suppression of the Druids took place.\r\nAdamnan mentions in his life of St. Columba, the _mocidruidi_, (or\r\nsons of Druids,) as existing in Scotland in the time of Columba; and\r\nhe informs us, “that the saint was interrupted at the castle of the\r\nking (of the Picts), in the discharge of his religious offices, by\r\ncertain _magi_;” a term, by the bye, applied by Pliny to the order of\r\nthe Druids. The following passage from an ancient Gaelic MS.[482] in\r\nthe possession of the Highland Society of Scotland, supposed to be\r\nof the 12th or 13th century, is conjectured to refer to the incident\r\nnoticed by Adamnan. “After this, St. Columba went upon a time to\r\nthe king of the Picts, namely, Bruidhi, son of Milchu, and the gate\r\nof the castle was shut against him; but the iron locks of the town\r\nopened instantly, through the prayers of Columb Cille. Then came the\r\nson of the king, to wit, Maelchu, and his Druid, to argue keenly\r\nagainst Columb Cille, in support of paganism.”\r\n\r\nMartin relates, that the natives of South-Uist believed that a valley\r\ncalled Glenslyte, situated between two mountains on the east side of\r\nthe island, was haunted by spirits, whom they called the Great Men,\r\nand that if any man or woman entered the valley without first making\r\nan entire resignation of themselves to the conduct of the great\r\nmen, they would infallibly grow mad. The words by which they gave\r\nthemselves up to the guidance of these men are comprehended in three\r\nsentences, wherein the glen is twice named. This author remonstrated\r\nwith the inhabitants upon this “piece of silly credulity,” but they\r\nanswered that there had been recently an instance of a woman who\r\nwent into the glen without resigning herself to the guidance of the\r\ngreat men, “and immediately after she became mad; which confirmed\r\nthem in their unreasonable fancy.” He also observes, that the people\r\nwho resided in the glen in summer, said, they sometimes heard a loud\r\nnoise in the air like men speaking.[483]\r\n\r\nThe same writer mentions a universal custom among the inhabitants of\r\nthe Western Islands, of pouring a cow’s milk upon a little hill, or\r\nbig stone, where a spirit they called Brownie, was believed to lodge,\r\nwhich spirit always appeared in the shape of a tall man, with very\r\nlong brown hair. On inquiring “from several well-meaning women, who,\r\nuntil of late, had practised it,” they told Martin that it had been\r\ntransmitted to them by their ancestors, who believed it was attended\r\nwith good fortune, but the most credulous of the vulgar had then laid\r\nit aside.\r\n\r\nIt was also customary among the “over-curious,” in the Western\r\nIslands, to consult an invisible oracle, concerning the fate of\r\nfamilies, battles, &c. This was done three different ways; the\r\nfirst was by a company of men, one of whom being chosen by lot, was\r\nafterwards carried to a river, the boundary between two villages:\r\nfour of the company seized on him, and having shut his eyes, they\r\ntook him by the legs and arms, and then tossing him to and fro,\r\nstruck his posteriors with force against the bank. One of them then\r\ncried out, What is it you have got here? Another answered, A log of\r\nbirch wood. The other cried again, Let his invisible friends appear\r\nfrom all quarters, and let them relieve him, by giving an answer\r\nto our present demands; and in a few minutes after, a number of\r\nlittle creatures came from the sea, who answered the question, and\r\ndisappeared suddenly. The man was then set at liberty, and they all\r\nreturned home to take their measures according to the prediction of\r\ntheir false prophets. This was always practised at night.\r\n\r\nThe second way of consulting the oracle was by a party of men, who\r\nfirst retired to solitary places, remote from any house, and then\r\nsingling out one of their number, wrapt him in a large cow’s hide,\r\nwhich they folded about him, covering all but his head, in which\r\nposture they left him all night until his invisible friends relieved\r\nhim by giving a proper answer to the question put; which answer he\r\nreceived, as he fancied, from several persons he found about him all\r\nthat time. His companions returned to him at break of day when he\r\ncommunicated his news to them, which it is said “often proved fatal\r\nto those concerned in such unlawful inquiries.”[484]\r\n\r\nThe third way of consulting the oracle, and which consultation was to\r\nserve as a confirmation of the second, was this: The same company who\r\nput the man into the hide, took a live cat and put him on a spit. One\r\nof the company was employed to turn the spit, and when in the act of\r\nturning, one of his companions would ask him, what are you doing? He\r\nanswered, I roast this cat, until his friends answer the question,\r\nthe same as that proposed to the man inclosed in the hide. Afterwards\r\na very large cat was said to come, attended by a number of lesser\r\ncats, desiring to relieve the cat turned upon the spit, and answered\r\nthe question. And if the answer turned out to be the same that was\r\ngiven to the man in the hide, then it was taken as a confirmation of\r\nthe other, which in this case was believed infallible.[485]\r\n\r\nA singular practice called _Deis-iuil_ existed in the Western\r\nIslands, so called from a man going round carrying fire in his right\r\nhand, which in the Gaelic is called _Deas_. In the island of Lewis\r\nthis fiery circuit was made about the houses, corn, cattle, &c.,\r\nof each particular family, to protect them from the power of evil\r\nspirits. The fire was also carried round about women before they\r\nwere churched after child-bearing, and about children till they\r\nwere baptized. This ceremony was performed in the morning and at\r\nnight, and was practised by some of the old midwives in Martin’s\r\ntime. Some of them told him that ‘the fire-round was an effectual\r\nmeans of preserving both the mother and the infant from the power\r\nof evil spirits, who are ready at such times to do mischief, and\r\nsometimes carry away the infant; and when they get them once in their\r\npossession, return them poor meagre skeletons; and these infants are\r\nsaid to have voracious appetites, constantly craving for meat. In\r\nthis case it was usual with those who believed that their children\r\nwere thus taken away, to dig a grave in the fields upon quarter-day,\r\nand there to lay the fairy skeleton till next morning; at which\r\ntime the parents went to the place, where they doubted not to find\r\ntheir own child instead of this skeleton. Some of the poorer sort of\r\npeople in these islands long retained a custom of performing rounds\r\nsun-wise, about the persons of their benefactors three times, when\r\nthey blessed them, and wished good success to all their enterprises.\r\nSome were very careful, when they set out to sea, that the boat\r\nshould be first rowed about sun-wise; and if this was neglected, they\r\nwere afraid their voyage would prove unfortunate.’\r\n\r\nA prevailing superstition also existed in the Western Islands, and\r\namong the inhabitants of the neighbouring coast, that women, by\r\na certain charm or by some secret influence, could withdraw and\r\nappropriate to their own use the increase of their neighbour’s cow’s\r\nmilk. It was believed, however, that the milk so charmed did not\r\nproduce the ordinary quantity of butter usually churned from other\r\nmilk, and that the curds made of such milk were so tough that they\r\ncould not be made so firm as other cheese, and that it was also much\r\nlighter in weight. It was also believed that the butter produced\r\nfrom the charmed milk could be discovered from that yielded from\r\nthe charmer’s own milk, by a difference in the colour, the former\r\nbeing of a paler hue than the latter. The woman in whose possession\r\nbutter so distinguished was found, was considered to be guilty. To\r\nbring back the increase of milk, it was usual to take a little of the\r\nrennet from all the suspected persons, and put it into an egg shell\r\nfull of milk, and when the rennet taken from the charmer was mingled\r\nwith it, it was said presently to curdle, but not before. Some women\r\nput the root of groundsel among their cream as an amulet against such\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nIn retaliation for washing dishes, wherein milk was kept, in streams\r\nor rivulets in which trouts were, it was believed that they prevented\r\nor took away an increase of milk, and the damage thus occasioned\r\ncould only be repaired by taking a live trout and pouring milk into\r\nits mouth. If the milk curdled immediately, this was a sure sign of\r\nits being taken away by trouts; if not, the inhabitants ascribed the\r\nevil to some other cause. Some women, it was affirmed, had the art to\r\ntake away the milk of nurses.\r\n\r\nA similar superstition existed as to malt, the virtues of which were\r\nsaid to be sometimes imperceptibly filched, by some charm, before\r\nbeing used, so that the drink made of this malt had neither strength\r\nnor good taste, while, on the contrary, the supposed charmer had very\r\ngood ale all the time. The following curious story is told by Martin\r\nin relation to this subject. “A gentleman of my acquaintance, for\r\nthe space of a year, could not have a drop of good ale in his house;\r\nand having complained of it to all that conversed with him, he was\r\nat last advised to get some yeast from every alehouse in the parish;\r\nand having got a little from one particular man, he put it among his\r\nwort, which became as good ale as could be drank, and so defeated\r\nthe charm. After which, the gentleman on whose land this man lived,\r\nbanished him thirty-six miles from thence.”[486]\r\n\r\nA singular mode of divination was sometimes practised by the\r\nHighlanders with bones. Having picked the flesh clean off a\r\nshoulder-blade of mutton, which was supposed to lose its virtue\r\nif touched by iron, they turned towards the east, and with looks\r\nsteadily fixed on the transparent bone they pretended to foretell\r\ndeaths, burials, &c.\r\n\r\nThe phases or changes of the moon were closely observed, and it\r\nwas only at particular periods of her revolution that they would\r\ncut turf or fuel, fell wood, or cut thatch for houses, or go upon\r\nany important expedition. They expected better crops of grain\r\nby sowing their seed in the moon’s increase. “The moon,” as Dr.\r\nJohnson observes, “has great influence in vulgar philosophy,” and\r\nin his memory it was a precept annually given in one of the English\r\nalmanacs, “To kill hogs when the moon was increasing, and the bacon\r\nwould prove the better in boiling.”\r\n\r\nThe aid of superstition was sometimes resorted to for curing\r\ndiseases. For hectic and consumptive complaints, the Highlanders\r\nused to pare the nails of the fingers and toes of the patient,--put\r\nthese parings into a bag made from a piece of his clothes,--and after\r\nwaving their hand with the bag thrice round his head, and crying,\r\n_Deis-iuil_, they buried it in some unknown place. Pliny, in his\r\nnatural history, says that this practice existed among the Magi of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nTo remove any contagious disease from cattle, they used to extinguish\r\nthe fires in the surrounding villages, after which they forced fire\r\nwith a wheel, or by rubbing one piece of dry wood upon another,\r\nwith which they burned juniper in the stalls of the cattle that\r\nthe smoke might purify the air about them. When this was performed,\r\nthe fires in the houses were rekindled from the forced fire. Shaw\r\nrelates in his history of Moray, that he personally witnessed both\r\nthe last-mentioned practices.\r\n\r\nAkin to some of the superstitions we have noticed, but differing from\r\nthem in many essential respects, is the belief--for superstition it\r\ncannot well be called--in the Second Sight, by which, as Dr. Johnson\r\nobserves, “seems to be meant a mode of seeing, super-added to that\r\nwhich nature generally bestows,”[487] and consists of “an impression\r\nmade either by the mind upon the eye, or by the eye upon the mind,\r\nby which things distant or future are perceived, and seen as if they\r\nwere present.”[488] This “deceptive faculty” is in Gaelic called\r\n_Taibhse_, i.e. a spectre, or a vision, and is neither voluntary nor\r\nconstant, but consists “in seeing an otherwise invisible object,\r\nwithout any previous means used by the person that sees it for that\r\nend; the vision makes such a lively impression upon the seer, that\r\nthey neither see nor think of any thing else, except the vision,\r\nas long as it continues: and then they appear pensive or jovial,\r\naccording to the object which was represented to them.”[489]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by lookers-on, that those persons who saw, or\r\nwere supposed to see, a vision, always kept their eye-lids erect,\r\nand that they continued to stare until the object vanished. Martin\r\naffirms that he and other persons that were with them, observed\r\nthis more than once, and he mentions an instance of a man in Skye,\r\nthe inner part of whose eye-lids was turned so far upwards during a\r\nvision, that after the object disappeared he found it necessary to\r\ndraw them down with his fingers, and would sometimes employ others to\r\ndraw them down, which he indeed, Martin says, “found from experience\r\nto be the easier way.”\r\n\r\nThe visions are said to have taken place either in the morning, at\r\nnoon, in the evening, or at night. If an object was seen early in\r\nthe morning, its accomplishment would take place in a few hours\r\nthereafter. If at noon, that very day. If in the evening, perhaps\r\nthat night; if after the candles were lighted, the accomplishment\r\nwould take place by weeks, months, and sometimes years, according to\r\nthe time of night the vision was seen.\r\n\r\nAs the appearances which are said to have been observed in visions\r\nand their prognostics may prove curious to the general reader, a few\r\nof them shall be here stated, as noted by Martin.\r\n\r\nWhen a shroud was perceived about one, it was a sure prognostic of\r\ndeath. The time was judged according to the height of it about the\r\nperson. If not seen above the middle, death was not to be expected\r\nfor the space of a year, and perhaps some months longer; and as it\r\nwas frequently seen to ascend higher towards the head, death was\r\nconcluded to be at hand within a few days, if not hours.\r\n\r\nIf a woman was seen standing at a man’s left hand, it was a presage\r\nthat she would be his wife, whether they were married to others, or\r\nunmarried at the time of the apparition.\r\n\r\nIf two or three women were seen at once standing near a man’s left\r\nhand, she that was next to him would undoubtedly be his wife first,\r\nand so on, whether all three, or the man, were single or married at\r\nthe time of the vision or not.\r\n\r\nIt was usual for the Seers to see any man that was shortly to arrive\r\nat the house. If unknown to the Seer he would give such a description\r\nof the person he saw as to make him to be at once recognised upon his\r\narrival. On the other hand, if the Seer knew the person he saw in the\r\nvision, he would tell his name, and know by the expression of his\r\ncountenance whether he came in a good or bad humour.\r\n\r\nThe Seers often saw houses, gardens, and trees, in places where there\r\nwere none, but in the course of time these places became covered with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo see a spark of fire fall upon one’s arm or breast, was a\r\nforerunner of a dead child to be seen in the arms of those persons.\r\nTo see a seat empty when one was sitting on it, was a presage of that\r\nperson’s immediate death.\r\n\r\nThere are now few persons, if any, who pretend to this faculty,\r\nand the belief in it is almost generally exploded. Yet it cannot\r\nbe denied that apparent proofs of its existence have been adduced\r\nwhich have staggered minds not prone to superstition. When the\r\nconnexion between cause and effect can be recognised, things which\r\nwould otherwise have appeared wonderful and almost incredible, are\r\nviewed as ordinary occurrences. The impossibility of accounting\r\nfor such an extraordinary phenomenon as the alleged faculty, on\r\nphilosophical principles, or from the laws of nature, must ever\r\nleave the matter suspended between rational doubt and confirmed\r\nscepticism. The strong-minded but superstitious Dr. Johnson appears,\r\nfrom the following passage, to have been inclined to believe in the\r\ngenuineness of the faculty. “Strong reasons for incredulity,” says\r\nDr. Johnson, “will readily occur. This faculty of seeing things out\r\nof sight is local, and commonly useless. It is a breach of the common\r\norder of things, without any visible reason or perceptible benefit.\r\nIt is ascribed only to a people very little enlightened; and among\r\nthem, for the most part, to the mean and ignorant. To the confidence\r\nof these objections it may be replied, that by presuming to determine\r\nwhat is fit, and what is beneficial, they presuppose more knowledge\r\nof the universal system than man has attained; and therefore depend\r\nupon principles too complicated and extensive for our comprehension;\r\nand that there can be no security in the consequence, when the\r\npremises are not understood: that the Second Sight is only wonderful\r\nbecause it is rare, for, considered in itself, it involves no more\r\ndifficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exercises of\r\nthe cogitative faculty; that a general opinion of communicative\r\nimpulses, or visionary representations, has prevailed in all ages and\r\nall nations; that particular instances have been given, with such\r\nevidence as neither Bacon, nor Bayle, has been able to resist; that\r\nsudden impressions, which the event has verified, have been felt by\r\nmore than own or publish them; that the Second Sight of the Hebrides\r\nimplies only the local frequency of a power which is no where totally\r\nunknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reason,\r\nwe must be content to yield to the force of testimony.”[490]\r\n\r\nAmong the various modes of social intercourse which gladdened the\r\nminds and dissipated the few worldly cares of the Highlanders,\r\nweddings bore a distinguished part, and they were longed for with a\r\npeculiar earnestness. Young and old, from the boy and girl of the\r\nage of ten to the hoary-headed sire and aged matron, attended them.\r\nThe marriage invitations were given by the bride and bridegroom, in\r\nperson, for some weeks previous, and included the friends of the\r\nbetrothed parties living at the distance of many miles.\r\n\r\nWhen the bride and bridegroom had completed their rounds, the custom\r\nwas for the matrons of the invited families to return the visit\r\nwithin a few days, carrying along with them large presents of hams,\r\nbeef, cheese, butter, malt, spirits, and such other articles as they\r\ninclined or thought necessary for the approaching feast. To such an\r\nextent was this practice carried in some instances in the quantity\r\npresented, that, along with what the guests paid (as they commonly\r\ndid) for their entertainment at the marriage, and the gifts presented\r\non the day after the marriage, the young couple obtained a pretty\r\nfair competence, which warded off the shafts of poverty, and even\r\nmade them comfortable in after-life.\r\n\r\nThe joyous wedding-morning was ushered in by the notes of the\r\nbagpipe. A party of pipers, followed by the bridegroom and some of\r\nhis friends, commenced at an early hour a round of morning calls\r\nto remind the guests of their engagements. These hastened to join\r\nthe party, and before the circuit, which sometimes occupied several\r\nhours, had ended, some hundreds, perhaps, had joined the wedding\r\nstandard before they reached the bridegroom’s house. The bride made\r\na similar round among her friends. Separate dinners were provided;\r\nthe bridegroom giving a dinner to his friends, and the bride to\r\nhers. The marriage ceremony was seldom performed till after dinner.\r\nThe clergyman sometimes attended, but the parties preferred waiting\r\non him, as the appearance of a large procession to his house gave\r\nadditional importance and eclat to the ceremony of the day, which\r\nwas further heightened by a constant firing by the young men, who\r\nsupplied themselves with guns and pistols, and which firing was\r\nresponded to by every hamlet as the party passed along; “so that,\r\nwith streamers flying, pipers playing, the constant firing from all\r\nsides, and the shouts of the young men, the whole had the appearance\r\nof a military army passing, with all the noise of warfare, through a\r\nhostile country.”\r\n\r\nOn the wedding-day, the bride and bridegroom avoided each other till\r\nthey met before the clergyman. Many ceremonies were performed during\r\nthe celebration of the marriage rites. These ceremonies were of an\r\namusing and innocent description, and added much to the cheerfulness\r\nand happiness of the young people. One of these ceremonies consisted\r\nin untying all the bindings and strings about the person of the\r\nbridegroom, to denote, that nothing was to be bound on the marriage\r\nday but the one indissoluble knot which death only can dissolve. The\r\nbride was exempted from this operation from a delicacy of feeling\r\ntowards her sex, and from a supposition that she was so pure that\r\ninfidelity on her part could not be contemplated.\r\n\r\nTo discontinue practices in themselves innocent, and which contribute\r\nto the social happiness of mankind, must ever be regretted, and it\r\nis not therefore to be wondered at, that a generous and open-hearted\r\nHighlander, like General Stewart, should have expressed his regret\r\nat the partial disuse of these ceremonies, or that he should have\r\npreferred a Highland wedding, where he had himself “been so happy,\r\nand seen so many blithe countenances, and eyes sparkling with\r\ndelight, to such weddings as that of the Laird of Drum, ancestor\r\nof the Lord Sommerville, when he married a daughter of Sir James\r\nBannatyne of Corehouse.”[491]\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the wedding-day were generally prolonged to a\r\nlate hour, and during the whole day the fiddlers and pipers never\r\nceased except at short intervals, to make sweet music. The fiddlers\r\nperformed in the house, the pipers in the field;[492] so that the\r\ncompany alternately enjoyed the pleasure of dancing within and\r\nwithout the house, as they felt inclined, provided the weather\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nNo people were more attached to the fulfilment of all the domestic\r\nduties, and the sacred obligation of the marriage vow, than the\r\nHighlanders. A violation thereof was of course of unfrequent\r\noccurrence, and among the common people a separation was almost\r\nunknown. Rarely, indeed, did a husband attempt to get rid of his\r\nwife, however disagreeable she might be. He would have considered\r\nhis children dishonoured, if he had driven their mother from\r\nthe protection of his roof. The punishment inflicted by the\r\necclesiastical authority for an infringement of the marriage vow\r\nwas, that “the guilty person, whether male or female, was made to\r\nstand in a barrel of cold water at the church door, after which, the\r\ndelinquent, clad in a wet canvas shirt, was made to stand before the\r\ncongregation, and at close of service the minister explained the\r\nnature of the offence.”[493] Illicit intercourse before marriage\r\nbetween the sexes was also of rare occurrence, and met with condign\r\npunishment in the public infamy which attended such breaches against\r\nchastity.\r\n\r\nThis was the more remarkable, as early marriages were discouraged,\r\nand the younger sons were not allowed to marry until they obtained\r\nsufficient means to keep a house and to rent a small farm, or were\r\notherwise enabled to support a family.\r\n\r\nThe attachment of the Highlanders to their offspring, and the\r\nveneration and filial piety which a reciprocal feeling produced on\r\nthe part of their children, were leading characteristics in the\r\nHighland character, and much as these mountaineers have degenerated\r\nin some of the other virtues, these affections still remain almost\r\nunimpaired. Children seldom desert their parents in their old age,\r\nand when forced to earn a subsistence from home, they always consider\r\nthemselves bound to share with their parents whatever they can save\r\nfrom their wages. But the parents are never left alone, as one of\r\nthe family, by turns, remains at home for the purpose of taking\r\ncare of them in terms of an arrangement. “The sense of duty is not\r\nextinguished by absence from the mountains. It accompanies the\r\nHighland soldier amid the dissipations of a mode of life to which he\r\nhas not been accustomed. It prompts him to save a portion of his pay,\r\nto enable him to assist his parents, and also to work when he has an\r\nopportunity, that he may increase their allowance, at once preserving\r\nhimself from idle habits, and contributing to the comfort and\r\nhappiness of those who gave him birth. I have been a frequent witness\r\nof these offerings of filial bounty, and the channel through which\r\nthey were communicated, and I have generally found that a threat of\r\ninforming their parents of misconduct, has operated as a sufficient\r\ncheck on young soldiers, who always received the intimation with a\r\nsort of horror. They knew that the report would not only grieve their\r\nrelations, but act as a sentence of banishment against themselves,\r\nas they could not return home with a bad or blemished character.\r\nGenerals M’Kenzie, Fraser, and M’Kenzie of Suddie, who successively\r\ncommanded the 78th Highlanders, seldom had occasion to resort to any\r\nother punishment than threats of this kind, for several years after\r\nthe embodying of that regiment.”[494]\r\n\r\nNor were the Highlanders less alive to the principles of honesty\r\nand fair dealing, in their transactions with one another. Disgrace\r\nwas the usual consequence of insolvency, which was considered _ex\r\nfacie_ criminal. Bankrupts were compelled to undergo a singular\r\npunishment. They “were forced to surrender their all, and were clad\r\nin a party-coloured clouted garment, with the hose of different sets,\r\nand had their hips dashed against a stone, in presence of the people,\r\nby four men, each taking a hold of an arm or a leg. This punishment\r\nwas called _Toncruaidh_.”[495]\r\n\r\nSuch was the confidence in their honour and integrity, that in\r\nthe ordinary transactions of the people, a mere verbal obligation\r\nwithout the intervention of any writing, was held quite sufficient,\r\nalthough contracted in the most private manner,[496] and there were\r\nfew instances where the obligation was either unfulfilled or denied.\r\nTheir mode of concluding or confirming their money agreements or\r\nother transactions, was by the contracting parties going out into\r\nthe open air, and with eyes erect, taking Heaven to witness their\r\nengagements, after which, each party put a mark on some remarkable\r\nstone or other natural object, which their ancestors had been\r\naccustomed to notice.\r\n\r\nAccustomed, as the Highlanders were, to interminable feuds arising\r\nout of the pretensions of rival clans, the native courage which they\r\nhad inherited from their Celtic progenitors was preserved unimpaired.\r\nInstances of cowardice were, therefore, of rare occurrence, and\r\nwhoever exhibited symptoms of fear before a foe, was considered\r\ninfamous and put under the ban of his party. The following anecdote,\r\nas related by Mrs. Grant, shows, strongly, the detestation which the\r\nHighlanders entertained towards those who had disgraced themselves\r\nand their clan by an act of poltroonery: “There was a clan, _I must\r\nnot say what clan it is_, who had been for ages governed by a series\r\nof chiefs, singularly estimable, and highly beloved, and who, in\r\none instance, provoked their leader to the extreme of indignation.\r\nI should observe, that the transgression was partial, the culprits\r\nbeing the inhabitants of one single parish. These, in a hasty\r\nskirmish with a neighbouring clan, thinking discretion the best\r\npart of valour, sought safety in retreat. A cruel chief would have\r\ninflicted the worst of punishments--banishment from the bounds of\r\nhis clan,--which, indeed, fell little short of the curse of Kehama.\r\nThis good laird, however, set bounds to his wrath, yet made their\r\npunishment severe and exemplary. He appeared himself with all the\r\npopulation of the three adjacent parishes, at the parish church of\r\nthe offenders, where they were all by order convened. After divine\r\nservice, they were marched three times round the church, in presence\r\nof their offended leader and his assembled clan. Each individual, on\r\ncoming out of the church door, was obliged to draw out his tongue\r\nwith his fingers, and then cry audibly, ‘Shud bleider heich,’ (i.e.)\r\n‘This is the poltroon,’ and to repeat it at every corner of the\r\nchurch. After this procession of ignominy, no other punishment was\r\ninflicted, except that of being left to guard the district when the\r\nrest were called out to battle.... It is credibly asserted, that no\r\nenemy has seen the back of any of that name (Grant) ever since. And\r\nit is certain, that, to this day, it is not safe for any person of\r\nanother name to mention the circumstance in presence of one of the\r\naffronted clan.”[497]\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, like the inhabitants of other romantic and\r\nmountainous regions, always retain an enthusiastic attachment to\r\ntheir country, which neither distance of place nor length of time\r\ncan efface. This strong feeling has, we think, been attributed\r\nerroneously to the powerful and lasting effect which the external\r\nobjects of nature, seen in their wildest and most fantastic forms and\r\nfeatures, are calculated to impress upon the imagination.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the remembrance of these objects might contribute to endear\r\nthe scenes of youth to the patriotic Highlander when far removed\r\nfrom his native glens; but it was the recollection of home,--sweet\r\nhome!--of the domestic circle, and of the many pleasing associations\r\nwhich arise from the contemplation of the days of other years, when\r\nmirth and innocence held mutual dalliance, that chiefly impelled\r\nhim to sigh for the land of his fathers. Mankind have naturally an\r\naffection for the country of their birth, and this affection is\r\nfelt more or less according to the degree of social or commercial\r\nintercourse which exists among nations. Confined, like the Swiss,\r\nfor many ages within their natural boundaries, and having little or\r\nno intercourse with the rest of the world, the Highlanders formed\r\nthose strong local attachments for which they were long remarkably\r\ndistinguished; but which are now being gradually obliterated by the\r\nmighty changes rapidly taking place in the state of society.\r\n\r\nFirmly attached as they were to their country, the Highlanders had\r\nalso a singular predilection for the place of their birth. An amusing\r\ninstance of this local attachment is mentioned by General Stewart.\r\nA tenant of his father’s, at the foot of the mountain Shichallion,\r\nhaving removed and followed his son to a farm which the latter had\r\ntaken at some distance lower down the country, the old man was\r\nmissing for a considerable time one morning, and on being asked on\r\nhis return where he had been, replied, “As I was sitting by the\r\nside of the river, a thought came across me, that, perhaps, some of\r\nthe waters from Shichallion, and the sweet fountains that watered\r\nthe farm of my forefathers, might now be passing by me, and that\r\nif I bathed they might touch my skin. I immediately stripped, and,\r\nfrom the pleasure I felt in being surrounded by the pure waters of\r\nLeidna-breilag (the name of the farm) I could not tear myself away\r\nsooner.” But this fondness of the Highlander was not confined to\r\nthe desire of living upon the beloved spot--it extended even to the\r\ngrave. The idea of dying at a distance from home and among strangers\r\ncould not be endured, and the aged Highlander, when absent from his\r\nnative place, felt discomposed lest death should overtake him before\r\nhis return. To be consigned to the grave among strangers, without\r\nthe attendance and sympathy of friends, and at a distance from their\r\nfamily, was considered a heavy calamity; and even to this day,\r\npeople make the greatest exertions to carry home the bodies of such\r\nrelations as happen to die far from the ground hallowed by the ashes\r\nof their forefathers.[498] This trait was exemplified in the case\r\nof a woman aged ninety-one, who a few years ago went to Perth from\r\nher house in Strathbrane in perfect health, and in the possession\r\nof all her faculties. A few days after her arrival in Perth, where\r\nshe had gone to visit a daughter, she had a slight attack of fever.\r\nOne evening a considerable quantity of snow had fallen, and she\r\nexpressed great anxiety, particularly when told that a heavier fall\r\nwas expected. Next morning her bed was found empty, and no trace of\r\nher could be discovered, till the second day, when she sent word\r\nthat she had slipt out of the house at midnight, set off on foot\r\nthrough the snow, and never stopped till she reached home, a distance\r\nof twenty miles. When questioned some time afterwards why she went\r\naway so abruptly, she answered, “If my sickness had increased, and\r\nif I had died, they could not have sent my remains home through the\r\ndeep snows. If I had told my daughter, perhaps she would have locked\r\nthe door upon me, and God forbid that my bones should be at such\r\na distance from home, and be buried among _Gall-na-machair_, The\r\nstrangers of the plain.”[499]\r\n\r\nAmong the causes which contributed to sustain the warlike character\r\nof the Highlanders, the exertions of the bards in stimulating them\r\nto deeds of valour in the field of battle, must not be overlooked.\r\nOne of the most important duties of the bard consisted in attending\r\nthe clans to the field, and exhorting them before battle to emulate\r\nthe glories of their ancestors, and to die if necessary in defence\r\nof their country. The appeals of the bards, which were delivered and\r\nenforced with great vehemence and earnestness, never failed to arouse\r\nthe feelings; and when amid the din of battle the voices of the bards\r\ncould no longer be heard, the pipers succeeded them, and cheered on\r\ntheir respective parties with their warlike and inspiring strains.\r\nAfter the termination of the battle, the bard celebrated the praises\r\nof the brave warriors who had fallen in battle, and related the\r\nheroic actions of the survivors to excite them to similar exertions\r\non future occasions. To impress still more deeply upon the minds of\r\nthe survivors the honour and heroism of their fallen friends, the\r\npiper was employed to perform plaintive dirges for the slain.\r\n\r\nFrom the associations raised in the mind by the great respect thus\r\npaid to the dead, and the honours which awaited the survivors who\r\ndistinguished themselves in the field of battle, by their actions\r\nbeing celebrated by the bards, and transmitted to posterity,\r\noriginated that magnanimous contempt of death for which the\r\nHighlanders are noted. While among some people the idea of death\r\nis avoided with studious alarm, the Highlander will speak of it\r\nwith an easy and unconcerned familiarity, as an event of ordinary\r\noccurrence, but in a way “equally remote from dastardly affectation,\r\nor fool-hardy presumption, and proportioned solely to the inevitable\r\ncertainty of the event itself.”[500]\r\n\r\nTo be interred decently, and in a becoming manner, is a material\r\nconsideration in the mind of a Highlander, and care is generally\r\ntaken, even by the poorest, long before the approach of death, to\r\nprovide sufficient articles to insure a respectable interment. To\r\nwish one another an honourable death, _crioch onarach_, is considered\r\nfriendly by the Highlanders, and even children will sometimes express\r\nthe same sentiment towards their parents. “A man well known to the\r\nwriter of these pages was remarkable for his filial affection, even\r\namong the sons and daughters of the mountains, so distinguished for\r\nthat branch of piety. His mother being a widow, and having a numerous\r\nfamily, who had married very early, he continued to live single, that\r\nhe might the more sedulously attend to her comfort, and watch over\r\nher declining years with the tenderest care. On her birth-day, he\r\nalways collected his brothers and sisters, and all their families, to\r\na sort of kindly feast, and, in conclusion, gave a toast, not easily\r\ntranslated from the emphatic language, without circumlocution,--_An\r\neasy and decorous departure to my mother_, comes nearest to it. This\r\ntoast, which would shake the nerves of fashionable delicacy, was\r\nreceived with great applause, the old woman remarking, that God had\r\nbeen always good to her, and she hoped she would die as decently as\r\nshe had lived, for it is thought of the utmost consequence to die\r\ndecently. The ritual of decorous departure, and of behaviour to be\r\nobserved by the friends of the dying on that solemn occasion, being\r\nfully established, nothing is more common than to take a solemn leave\r\nof old people, as if they were going on a journey, and pretty much in\r\nthe same terms. People frequently send conditional messages to the\r\ndeparted. _If you are permitted, tell my dear brother, that I have\r\nmerely endured the world since he left it, and that I have been very\r\nkind to every creature he used to cherish, for his sake._ I have,\r\nindeed, heard a person of a very enlightened mind, seriously give a\r\nmessage to an aged person, to deliver to a child he had lost not long\r\nbefore, which she as seriously promised to deliver, with the wonted\r\nsalvo, if she was permitted.”[501]\r\n\r\nIn no country was “the savage virtue of hospitality” carried to a\r\ngreater extent than in the Highlands, and never did stranger receive\r\na heartier welcome than was given to the guest who entered a Highland\r\nmansion or cottage. This hospitality was sometimes carried rather too\r\nfar, particularly in the island of Barra, where, according to Martin,\r\nthe custom was, that, when strangers from the northern islands went\r\nthere, “the natives, immediately after their landing, obliged them to\r\neat, even though they should have liberally eat and drank but an hour\r\nbefore their landing there.” This meat they called _Bieyta’v_, i.e.\r\nOcean meat. Sir Robert Gordon informs us that it was a custom among\r\nthe western islanders, that when one was invited to another’s house,\r\nthey never separated till the whole provision was finished; and that,\r\nwhen it was done, they went to the next house, and so on from one\r\nhouse to another until they made a complete round, from neighbour to\r\nneighbour, always carrying the head of the family in which they had\r\nbeen last entertained to the next house along with them.[502]\r\n\r\nThe removal of the court by Malcolm Canmore to the Lowlands was an\r\nevent which was followed by results very disastrous to the future\r\nprosperity of the Highlands. The inhabitants soon sunk into a state\r\nof poverty, and, as by the transference of the seat of government\r\nthe administration of the laws became either inoperative or was\r\nfeebly enforced, the people gave themselves up to violence and\r\nturbulence, and revenged in person those injuries which the laws\r\ncould no longer redress. Released from the salutary control of\r\nmonarchical government, the Highlanders soon saw the necessity of\r\nsubstituting some other system in its place, to protect themselves\r\nagainst the aggressions to which they were exposed. From this state\r\nof things originated the great power of the Chiefs, who attained\r\ntheir ascendancy over the different little communities into which\r\nthe population of the Highlands was naturally divided, on account\r\nof their superior property, courage, or talent. The powers of the\r\nchiefs were very great. They acted as judges or arbiters in the\r\nquarrels of their clansmen and followers, and as they were backed by\r\nresolute supporters of their rights, their property, and their power,\r\nthey established within their own territories a jurisdiction almost\r\nindependent of the kingly authority.\r\n\r\nFrom this division of the people into clans and tribes under separate\r\nchiefs, arose many of those institutions, feelings, and usages which\r\ncharacterised the Highlanders. “The nature of the country, and the\r\nmotives which induced the Celts to make it their refuge, almost\r\nnecessarily prescribed the form of their institutions. Unequal to\r\ncontend with the overwhelming numbers, who drove them from the\r\nplains, and, anxious to preserve their independence, and their blood\r\nuncontaminated by a mixture with strangers, they defended themselves\r\nin those strongholds which are, in every country, the sanctuaries of\r\nnational liberty, and the refuge of those who resist the oppressions\r\nand the dominion of a more powerful neighbour. Thus, in the absence\r\nof their monarchs, and defended by their barrier of rocks, they did\r\nnot always submit to the authority of a distant government, which\r\ncould neither enforce obedience nor afford protection.”[503]\r\n\r\nThe various little societies into which the Highland population\r\nwas, by the nature of the country, divided, having no desire to\r\nchange their residence or to keep up a communication with one\r\nanother, and having all their wants, which were few, supplied within\r\nthemselves, became individually isolated. Every district became\r\nan independent state, and thus the Highland population, though\r\npossessing a community of customs and the same characteristics, was\r\ndivided or broken into separate masses, and placed under different\r\njurisdictions. A patriarchal[504] system of government, “a sort\r\nof hereditary monarchy founded on custom, and allowed by general\r\nconsent, rather than regulated by laws,” was thus established over\r\neach community or clan in the persons of the chiefs.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the separation which was preserved by the\r\ndifferent clans, matrimonial alliances were rarely made with\r\nstrangers, and hence the members of the clan were generally related\r\nto one another by the ties of consanguinity or affinity. While this\r\ndouble connexion tended to preserve harmony and good will among the\r\nmembers of the same clan, it also tended, on the other hand, to\r\nexcite a bitter spirit of animosity between rival clans, whenever\r\nan affront or injury was offered by one clan to another, or by\r\nindividuals of different clans.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief had great power with his clan in the different\r\nrelations of landlord, leader, and judge, his authority was far from\r\nabsolute, as he was obliged to consult the leading men of the clan\r\nin matters of importance--in things regarding the clan or particular\r\nfamilies, in removing differences, punishing or redressing injuries,\r\npreventing lawsuits, supporting declining families, and declaring war\r\nagainst, or adjusting terms of peace with other clans.\r\n\r\nAs the system of clanship was calculated to cherish a warlike spirit,\r\nthe young chiefs and heads of families were regarded or despised\r\naccording to their military or peaceable disposition. If they\r\nrevenged a quarrel with another clan by killing some of the enemy,\r\nor carrying off their cattle and laying their lands waste, they were\r\nhighly esteemed, and great expectations were formed of their future\r\nprowess and exploits. But if they failed in their attempts, they were\r\nnot respected; and if they appeared disinclined to engage in hostile\r\nrencontres, they were despised.[505]\r\n\r\nThe military ranks of the clans were fixed and perpetual. The chief\r\nwas, of course, the principal commander. The oldest cadet commanded\r\nthe right wing, and the youngest the rear. Every head of a distinct\r\nfamily was captain of his own tribe. An ensign or standard-bearer was\r\nattached to each clan, who generally inherited his office, which had\r\nbeen usually conferred on an ancestor who had distinguished himself.\r\nA small salary was attached to this office.\r\n\r\nEach clan had a stated place of rendezvous, where they met at the\r\ncall of their chief. When an emergency arose for an immediate meeting\r\nfrom the incursions of a hostile clan, the cross or tarie, or\r\nfiery-cross, was immediately despatched through the territories of\r\nthe clan. This signal consisted of two pieces of wood placed in the\r\nform of a cross. One of the ends of the horizontal piece was either\r\nburnt or burning, and a piece of linen or white cloth stained with\r\nblood was suspended from the other end. Two men, each with a cross\r\nin his hand, were despatched by the chief in different directions,\r\nwho kept running with great speed, shouting the war-cry of the tribe,\r\nand naming the place of rendezvous, if different from the usual\r\nplace of meeting. The cross was delivered from hand to hand, and as\r\neach fresh bearer ran at full speed, the clan assembled with great\r\ncelerity. General Stewart says, that one of the latest instances of\r\nthe fiery-cross being used, was in 1745 by Lord Breadalbane, when\r\nit went round Loch Tay, a distance of thirty-two miles, in three\r\nhours, to raise his people and prevent their joining the rebels, but\r\nwith less effect than in 1715 when it went the same round, and when\r\n500 men assembled in a few hours, under the command of the Laird of\r\nGlenlyon, to join the Earl of Mar.\r\n\r\nEvery clan had its own war-cry, (called in Scottish _slogan_,) to\r\nwhich every clansman answered. It served as a watch-word in cases\r\nof sudden alarm, in the confusion of combat, or in the darkness of\r\nthe night. The clans were also distinguished by a particular badge,\r\nor by the peculiar arrangements or sets of the different colours of\r\nthe tartan, which will be fully noticed when we come to treat of the\r\nhistory of the clans.\r\n\r\nWhen a clan went upon any expedition they were much influenced\r\nby omens. If they met an armed man they believed that good was\r\nportended. If they observed a deer, fox, hare, or any other\r\nfour-footed beast of game, and did not succeed in killing it, they\r\nprognosticated evil. If a woman barefooted crossed the road before\r\nthem, they seized her and drew blood from her forehead.\r\n\r\nThe _Cuid-Oidhche_, or night’s provision, was paid by many tenants to\r\nthe chief; and in hunting or going on an expedition, the tenant who\r\nlived near the hill was bound to furnish the master and his followers\r\na night’s entertainment, with brawn for his dogs.\r\n\r\nThere are no sufficient data to enable us to estimate correctly the\r\nnumber of fighting men which the clans could bring at any time into\r\nthe field; but a general idea may be formed of their strength in\r\n1745, from the following statement of the respective forces of the\r\nclans as taken from the memorial supposed to be drawn up by the Lord\r\nPresident Forbes of Culloden, for the information of government. It\r\nis to be observed, however, that besides the clans here mentioned,\r\nthere were many independent gentlemen, as General Stewart observes,\r\nwho had many followers, but being what were called broken names, or\r\nsmall tribes, are omitted.\r\n\r\n  Argyle,                                 3000\r\n  Breadalbane,                            1000\r\n  Lochnell and other chieftains of the\r\n    Campbells,                            1000\r\n  Macleans,                                500\r\n  Maclauchlans,                            200\r\n  Stewart of Appin,                        300\r\n  Macdougals,                              200\r\n  Stewart of Grandtully,                   300\r\n  Clan Gregor,                             700\r\n  Duke of Athol,                          3000\r\n  Farquarsons,                            500\r\n  Duke of Gordon,                          300\r\n  Grant of Grant,                          850\r\n  Mackintosh,                              800\r\n  Macphersons,                             400\r\n  Frasers,                                 900\r\n  Grant of Glenmorriston,                  150\r\n  Chisholms,                               200\r\n  Duke of Perth,                           300\r\n  Seaforth,                               1000\r\n  Cromarty, Scatwell, Gairloch, and other\r\n    chieftains of the Mackenzies,         1500\r\n  Laird of Menzies,                        300\r\n  Munros,                                  300\r\n  Rosses,                                  500\r\n  Sutherland,                             2000\r\n  Mackays,                                 800\r\n  Sinclairs,                              1100\r\n  Macdonald of Slate,                      700\r\n  Macdonald of Clanronald,                 700\r\n  Macdonell of Glengary,                   500\r\n  Macdonell of Keppoch,                    300\r\n  Macdonald of Glencoe,                    130\r\n  Robertsons,                              200\r\n  Camerons,                                800\r\n  M’Kinnon,                                200\r\n  Macleod,                                 700\r\n  The Duke of Montrose, Earls of Bute\r\n    and Moray, Macfarlanes, M’Neils\r\n    of Barra, M’Nabs, M’Naughtons,\r\n    Lamonts, &c. &c.                      5600\r\n                                         -----\r\n                                        31,930\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so remarkable in the political history of any\r\ncountry as the succession of the Highland chiefs, and the long\r\nand uninterrupted sway which they held over their followers. The\r\nauthority which a chief exercised among his clan was truly paternal,\r\nand he might, with great justice, have been called the father of\r\nhis people. We cannot account for that warm attachment and the\r\nincorruptible and unshaken fidelity which the clans uniformly\r\ndisplayed towards their chiefs, on any other ground, than the kind\r\nand conciliatory system which they must have adopted towards their\r\npeople; for, much as the feelings of the latter might have been\r\nawakened, by the songs and traditions of the bards, to a respect for\r\nthe successors of the heroes whose praises they heard celebrated,\r\na sense of wrongs committed, or of oppressions exercised, would\r\nhave obliterated every feeling of attachment in the minds of the\r\nsufferers, and caused them to attempt to get rid of a tyrant who had\r\nrendered himself obnoxious by his tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe division of the people into small tribes, and the establishment\r\nof patriarchal government, were attended with many important\r\nconsequences affecting the character of the Highlanders. This\r\ncreation of an _imperium in imperio_ was an anomaly, but it was,\r\nnevertheless, rendered necessary from the state of society in the\r\nHighlands shortly after the transference of the seat of government\r\nfrom the mountains. The authority of the king, though weak and\r\ninefficient, continued, however, to be recognised, nominally at\r\nleast, except indeed when he interfered in the disputes between the\r\nclans. On such occasions his authority was utterly disregarded. “His\r\nmandates could neither stop the depredations of one clan against\r\nanother, nor allay their mutual hostilities. Delinquents could not,\r\nwith impunity, be pursued into the bosom of a clan which protected\r\nthem, nor could his judges administer the laws in opposition to\r\ntheir interests or their will. Sometimes he strengthened his arm by\r\nfomenting animosities among them, and by entering occasionally into\r\nthe interest of one, in order to weaken another. Many instances of\r\nthis species of policy occur in Scottish history, which, for a long\r\nperiod, was unhappily a mere record of internal violence.”[506]\r\n\r\nThe general laws being thus superseded by the internal feuds of the\r\nclans, and the authority of the sovereign being insufficient to\r\nrepress these disorders, a perpetual system of warfare, aggression,\r\ndepredation, and contention existed among them, which, during the\r\ncontinuance of clanship, banished peace from the Highlands. The\r\nlittle sovereignties of the clans “touched at so many points, yet\r\nwere so independent of one another; they approached so nearly, in\r\nmany respects, yet were, in others, so distant; there were so many\r\nopportunities of encroachment, on the one hand, and so little of a\r\ndisposition to submit to it, on the other; and the quarrel of one\r\nindividual of the tribe so naturally involved the rest, that there\r\nwas scarcely ever a profound peace, or perfect cordiality between\r\nthem. Among their chiefs the most deadly feuds frequently arose\r\nfrom opposing interests, or from wounded pride. These feuds were\r\nwarmly espoused by the whole clan, and were often transmitted, with\r\naggravated animosity, from generation to generation.”[507]\r\n\r\nThe disputes between opposing clans were frequently made matters\r\nof negotiation, and their differences were often adjusted by\r\ntreaties. Opposing clans, as a means of strengthening themselves\r\nagainst the attacks of their rivals, or of maintaining the balance\r\nof power, also entered into coalitions with friendly neighbours.\r\nThese bands of amity or _manrent_, as they were called, were of\r\nthe nature of treaties of offensive and defensive alliance, by\r\nwhich the contracting parties bound themselves to assist each\r\nother; and it is remarkable that the duty of allegiance to the king\r\nwas always acknowledged in these treaties,--“always excepting my\r\nduty to our lord the king, and to our kindred and friends,” was a\r\nclause which was uniformly inserted in them. In the same manner,\r\nwhen men who were not chiefs of clans, but of subordinate tribes,\r\nthus bound themselves, their fidelity to their chiefs was always\r\nexcepted. The smaller clans who were unable to defend themselves,\r\nand such clans or families who had lost their chiefs, were included\r\nin these friendly treaties.[508] Under these treaties the smaller\r\nclans identified themselves with the greater clans; they engaged in\r\nthe quarrels, followed the fortunes, and fought under the greater\r\nchiefs; but their ranks, as General Stewart observes, were separately\r\nmarshalled, and led by their own subordinate chieftains and lairds,\r\nwho owned submission only when necessary, for the success of combined\r\noperations. Several instances of this union will be found in the\r\nhistory of the clans.\r\n\r\nAs the system of clanship, by ignoring the authority of the sovereign\r\nand of the laws, prevented the clans from ever coming to any general\r\nterms of accommodation for settling their differences, their feuds\r\nwere interminable, and the Highlands were, therefore, for ages,\r\nthe theatre of a constant petty warfare destructive of the social\r\nvirtues. “The spirit of opposition and rivalry between the clans\r\nperpetuated a system of hostility, encouraged the cultivation of\r\nthe military at the expense of the social virtues, and perverted\r\ntheir ideas of both law and morality. Revenge was accounted a\r\nduty, the destruction of a neighbour a meritorious exploit, and\r\nrapine an honourable occupation. Their love of distinction, and\r\ntheir conscious reliance on their courage, when under the direction\r\nof these perverted notions, only tended to make their feuds more\r\nimplacable, their condition more agitated, and their depredations\r\nmore rapacious and desolating. Superstition added its influence in\r\nexasperating animosities, by teaching the clansmen, that, to revenge\r\nthe death of a relation or friend, was a sacrifice agreeable to their\r\nshades: thus engaging on the side of the most implacable hatred,\r\nand the darkest vengeance, the most amiable and domestic of all our\r\nfeelings,--reverence for the memory of the dead, and affection for\r\nthe virtues of the living.”[509]\r\n\r\nAs the causes out of which feuds originated were innumerable, so many\r\nof them were trivial and unimportant, but as submission to the most\r\ntrifling insult was considered disgraceful, and might, if overlooked,\r\nlead to fresh aggression, the clan was immediately summoned, and\r\nthe cry for revenge met with a ready response in every breast. The\r\nmost glaring insult that could be offered to a clan, was to speak\r\ndisrespectfully of its chief,[510] an offence which was considered as\r\na personal affront by all his followers, and was resented accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt often happened that the insulted clan was unable to take the field\r\nto repel aggression or to vindicate its honour; but the injury was\r\nnever forgotten, and the memory of it was treasured up till a fitting\r\nopportunity for taking revenge should arrive. The want of strength\r\nwas sometimes supplied by cunning, and the blackest and deadliest\r\nintentions of hatred and revenge were sought to be perpetrated under\r\nthe mask of conciliation and friendship. This was the natural result\r\nof the inefficiency of the laws which could afford no redress for\r\nwrongs, and which, therefore, left every individual to vindicate\r\nhis rights with his own hand. The feeling of revenge, when directed\r\nagainst rival tribes, was cherished and honoured, and to such an\r\nextent was it carried, that there are well authenticated instances\r\nwhere one of the adverse parties has been exterminated in the bloody\r\nand ferocious conflicts which the feuds occasioned.\r\n\r\nAs the wealth of the Highlanders consisted chiefly in flocks and\r\nherds, “the usual mode of commencing attacks, or of making reprisals,\r\nwas by an incursion to carry off the cattle of the hostile clan.\r\nA predatory expedition was the general declaration of enmity, and\r\na command given by the chief to clear the pastures of the enemy,\r\nconstituted the usual letters of marque.”[511] These _Creachs_, as\r\nsuch depredations were termed, were carried on with systematic order,\r\nand were considered as perfectly justifiable. If lives were lost\r\nin these forays, revenge full and ample was taken, but in general\r\npersonal hostilities were avoided in these incursions either against\r\nthe Lowlanders or rival tribes. These predatory expeditions were more\r\nfrequently directed against the Lowlanders, whom the Highlanders\r\nconsidered as aliens, and whose cattle they, therefore, considered\r\nas fair spoil at all times. The forays were generally executed with\r\ngreat secrecy, and the cattle were often _lifted_ and secured for\r\na considerable time before they were missed. To trace the cattle\r\nwhich had been thus carried off, the owners endeavoured to discover\r\ntheir foot-marks in the grass, or by the yielding of the heath over\r\nwhich they had passed; and so acute had habit rendered their sight,\r\nthat they frequently succeeded, in this manner, in discovering their\r\nproperty. The man on whose property the tract of the cattle was lost\r\nwas held liable if he did not succeed in following out the trace or\r\ndiscovering the cattle; and if he did not make restitution, or offer\r\nto compensate the loss, an immediate quarrel was the consequence. A\r\nreward, called _Tasgal_ money, was sometimes offered for the recovery\r\nof stolen cattle; but as this was considered in the light of a bribe,\r\nit was generally discouraged. The Camerons and some other clans, it\r\nis said, bound themselves by oath never to accept such a reward, and\r\nto put to death all who should receive it.\r\n\r\nBesides those who took part in the _Creachs_ there was another and a\r\npeculiar class called _Cearnachs_, a term of similar import with the\r\n_Catherans_ of the Lowlands, the _Kernes_ of the English, and the\r\n_Catervæ_ of the Romans. The Cearnachs were originally a select body\r\nof men employed in difficult and dangerous enterprises where more\r\nthan ordinary honour was to be acquired; but, in process of time,\r\nthey were employed in the degrading and dishonourable task of levying\r\ncontributions on their Lowland neighbours, or in forcing them to pay\r\ntribute or _black mail_ for protection. Young men of the second order\r\nof gentry who were desirous of entering the military profession,\r\nfrequently joined in these exploits, as they were considered well\r\nfitted for accustoming those who engaged in them to the fatigues\r\nand exercises incident to a military life. The celebrated Robert\r\nMacgregor Campbell, or Rob Roy,[512] was the most noted of these\r\nfreebooters.\r\n\r\nThe cearnachs were principally the borderers living close to and\r\nwithin the Grampian range, but cearnachs from the more northerly\r\nparts of the Highlands also paid frequent visits to the Lowlands,\r\nand carried off large quantities of booty. The border cearnachs\r\njudging such irruptions as an invasion of their rights, frequently\r\nattacked the northern cearnachs on their return homewards; and if\r\nthey succeeded in capturing the spoil, they either appropriated it to\r\ntheir own use or restored it to the owners.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the system of spoliation we have described,\r\nwould have led these freebooters occasionally to steal from one\r\nanother. Such, however, was not the case; for they observed the\r\nstrictest honesty in this respect. No precautions were taken--because\r\nunnecessary--to protect property; and the usual securities of locks,\r\nbolts, and bars, were never used, nor even thought of. Instances of\r\ntheft from dwelling-houses were very rare; and, with the exception\r\nof one case which happened so late as the year 1770, highway robbery\r\nwas totally unknown. Yet, notwithstanding the laudable regard thus\r\nshown by the freebooters to the property of their own society, they\r\nattached no ideas of moral turpitude to the acts of spoliation we\r\nhave alluded to. Donald Cameron, or Donald Bane Leane, an active\r\nleader of a party of banditti who had associated together after the\r\ntroubles of 1745, tried at Perth for cattle-stealing, and executed\r\nat Kinloch Rannoch, in 1752, expressed surprise and indignation\r\nat his hard fate, as he considered it, as he had never committed\r\nmurder nor robbery, or taken any thing but cattle off the grass\r\nof those with whom he had quarrelled. The practice of “lifting of\r\ncattle” seems to have been viewed as a very venial offence, even by\r\npersons holding very different views of morality from the actors, in\r\nproof of which, General Stewart refers to a letter of Field-Marshal\r\nWade to Mr. Forbes of Culloden, then Lord Advocate, dated October,\r\n1729, describing an entertainment given him on a visit to a party of\r\ncearnachs. “The Knight and I,” says the Marshal, “travelled in my\r\ncarriage with great ease and pleasure to the feast of oxen which the\r\nhighwaymen had prepared for us, opposite Lochgarry, where we found\r\nfour oxen roasting at the same time, in great order and solemnity.\r\nWe dined in a tent pitched for that purpose. The beef was excellent;\r\nand we had plenty of bumpers, not forgetting your Lordship’s and\r\nCulloden’s health; and, after three hours’ stay, took leave of\r\nour benefactors, the highwaymen,[513] and arrived at the hut at\r\nDalnachardoch, before it was dark.”[514]\r\n\r\nAmid the violence and turbulence which existed in the Highlands,\r\nno appeal for redress of wrongs committed, or injuries sustained,\r\ncould be effectually made to the legal tribunals of the country;\r\nbut to prevent the utter anarchy which would have ensued from such\r\na state of society, voluntary and associated tribunals, composed\r\nof the principal men of the tribes, were appointed. A composition\r\nin cattle being the mode of compensating injuries, these tribunals\r\ngenerally determined the amount of the compensation according to the\r\nnature of the injury, and the wealth and rank of the parties. These\r\ncompensations were called _Erig_.\r\n\r\nBesides these tribunals, every chief held a court, in which he\r\ndecided all disputes occurring among his clansmen. He generally\r\nresided among them. “His castle was the court where rewards were\r\ndistributed, and the most enviable distinctions conferred. All\r\ndisputes were settled by his decision, and the prosperity or poverty\r\nof his tenants depended on his proper or improper treatment of them.\r\nThese tenants followed his standard in war--attended him in his\r\nhunting excursions--supplied his table with the produce of their\r\nfarms--and assembled to reap his corn, and to prepare and bring home\r\nhis fuel. They looked up to him as their adviser and protector. The\r\ncadets of his family, respected in proportion to the proximity of the\r\nrelation in which they stood to him, became a species of sub-chiefs,\r\nscattered over different parts of his domains, holding their lands\r\nand properties of him, with a sort of subordinate jurisdiction over\r\na portion of his people, and were ever ready to afford him their\r\ncounsel or assistance in all emergencies.\r\n\r\n“Great part of the rent of land was paid in kind, and generally\r\nconsumed where it was produced. One chief was distinguished from\r\nanother, not by any additional splendour of dress or equipage, but\r\nby being followed by more dependants, and by entertaining a greater\r\nnumber of guests. What his retainers gave from their individual\r\nproperty was spent amongst them in the kindest and most liberal\r\nmanner. At the castle every individual was made welcome, and was\r\ntreated according to his station, with a degree of courtesy and\r\nregard to his feelings unknown in any other country.[515] This\r\ncondescension, while it raised the clansman in his own estimation,\r\nand drew closer the ties between him and his superior, seldom\r\ntempted him to use any improper familiarities. He believed himself\r\nwell born, and was taught to respect himself in the respect which\r\nhe showed to his chief; and thus, instead of complaining of the\r\ndifference of station and fortune, or considering a ready obedience\r\nto his chieftain’s call as a slavish oppression, he felt convinced\r\nthat he was supporting his own honour in showing his gratitude and\r\nduty to the generous head of his family. ‘Hence, the Highlanders,\r\nwhom more savage nations called savage, carried in the outward\r\nexpression of their manners the politeness of courts without their\r\nvices, and in their bosoms the high point of honour without its\r\nfollies.’”[516]\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be denied, that the authority of the chief was\r\nnaturally arbitrary, and was sometimes exercised unduly and with\r\ngreat severity; as a proof of which, there is said to exist among\r\nthe papers of the Perth family, an application to Lord Drummond\r\nfrom the town of Perth, dated in 1707, requesting an occasional\r\nuse of his lordship’s executioner, who was considered an expert\r\noperator, a request with which his lordship complied, reserving,\r\nhowever, to himself the power of recalling the executioner when he\r\nhad occasion for his services. Another curious illustration of this\r\nexercise of power is given by General Stewart. Sometime before the\r\nyear 1745, Lord President Forbes dined at Blair castle with the Duke\r\nof Athole, on his way from Edinburgh to his seat at Culloden. A\r\npetition was delivered to his Grace in the course of the evening, on\r\nreading which, he thus addressed the President: “My lord, here is a\r\npetition from a poor man, whom Commissary Bisset, my baron bailie (an\r\nofficer to whom the chief occasionally delegated his authority), has\r\ncondemned to be hanged; and as he is a clever fellow, and is strongly\r\nrecommended to mercy, I am much inclined to pardon him.” “But your\r\nGrace knows,” said the President, “that, after condemnation, no\r\nman can pardon but his Majesty.” “As to that,” replied the Duke,\r\n“since I have the power of punishing, it is but right that I should\r\nhave the power to pardon.” Then, calling upon a servant who was in\r\nwaiting, his Grace said, “Go, send an express to Logierait, and\r\norder Donald Stewart, presently under sentence, to be instantly set\r\nat liberty.”[517]\r\n\r\nThe authority which the generality of the chiefs exercised, was\r\nacquired from ancient usage and the weakness of the government;\r\nbut the lords of regality, and the great barons and chiefs, had\r\njurisdiction conferred on them by the Crown, both in civil and\r\ncriminal cases, which they sometimes exercised in person and\r\nsometimes by deputy. The persons to whom they delegated this\r\nauthority were called _bailies_. In civil matters the baron or\r\nchief could judge in questions of debt within his barony, as well\r\nas in most of those cases known by the technical term of possessory\r\nactions. And though it has always been an established rule of law,\r\nthat no person can be judge in his own cause, a baron might judge in\r\nall actions between himself and his vassals and tenants, necessary\r\nfor making his rents and feu-duties effectual. Thus, he could\r\nascertain the price of corn due by a tenant, and pronounce sentence\r\nagainst him for arrears of rent; but in all cases where the chief was\r\na party, he could not judge in person. The criminal jurisdiction of a\r\nbaron, according to the laws ascribed to Malcolm Mackenneth, extended\r\nto all crimes except treason, and the four pleas of the Crown, viz.,\r\nrobbery, murder, rape, and fire-raising. Freemen could be tried by\r\nnone but their peers. Whenever the baron held a court, his vassals\r\nwere bound to attend and afford such assistance as might be required.\r\nOn these occasions many useful regulations for the good of the\r\ncommunity were often made, and supplies were sometimes voluntarily\r\ngranted to the chief to support his dignity. The bounty of the\r\nvassals was especially and liberally bestowed on the marriage of the\r\nchief, and in the portioning of his daughters and younger sons. These\r\ndonations consisted of cattle, which constituted the principal riches\r\nof the country in those patriarchal days. In this way the younger\r\nsons of the chief were frequently provided for on their settlement in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal ties which connected the chief and his clan were\r\nalmost indissoluble. In return for the kindness and paternal care\r\nbestowed by the former on the latter, they yielded a ready submission\r\nto his authority, and evinced a rare fidelity to his person, which\r\nno adversity could shake. Innumerable instances of this devoted\r\nattachment might be given, but two will suffice. In the battle\r\nof Inverkeithing, between the royalists and the troops of Oliver\r\nCromwell, 500 of the followers of the Laird of Maclean were left\r\ndead on the field. Sir Hector Maclean being hard pressed by the\r\nenemy in the heat of the action, was successively covered from their\r\nattacks by seven brothers, all of whom sacrificed their lives in his\r\ndefence; and as one fell another came up in succession to cover him,\r\ncrying, “Another for Hector.” This phrase, says General Stewart, has\r\ncontinued ever since a proverb or watchword, when a man encounters\r\nany sudden danger that requires instant succour. The other instance\r\nis that of a servant of the late James Menzies of Culdares, who had\r\nbeen engaged in the rebellion of 1715. Mr. Menzies was taken at\r\nPreston in Lancashire, was carried to London, where he was tried and\r\ncondemned, but afterwards reprieved. This act prevented him from\r\nturning out in 1745: but to show his good wishes towards Prince\r\nCharles, he sent him a handsome charger as a present, when advancing\r\nthrough England. The servant who led and delivered the horse was\r\ntaken prisoner and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried and\r\ncondemned. Every attempt was made, by threats of immediate execution,\r\nin case of refusal, and promises of pardon, on giving information,\r\nto extort a discovery from him of the person who sent the horse,\r\nbut in vain. He knew, he said, what would be the consequence of a\r\ndisclosure, and that his own life was nothing in comparison with\r\nthat which it would endanger. Being hard pressed at the place of\r\nexecution to inform on his master, he asked those about him if they\r\nwere really serious in supposing that he was such a villain as to\r\nbetray his master. He said, that if he did what they desired, and\r\nforgot his master and his trust, he needed not return to his country,\r\nfor Glenlyon would be no home or country for him, as he would be\r\ndespised and hunted out of the glen. This trusty servant’s name was\r\nJohn Macnaughton, a native of Glenlyon in Perthshire.[518]\r\n\r\nThe obedience and attachment of the Highlanders to their chiefs,\r\nand the readiness they displayed, on all occasions, to adopt, when\r\ncalled upon, the quarrels of their superiors, did not, however, make\r\nthem forget their own independence. When a chief was unfit for his\r\nsituation, or had degraded his name and family, the clan proceeded\r\nto depose him, and set up the next in succession, if deserving, to\r\nwhom they transferred their allegiance, as happened to two chiefs of\r\nthe families of Macdonald of Clanronald and Macdonell of Keppoch.\r\nThe head of the family of Stewart of Garth, who, on account of his\r\nferocious disposition, was nick-named the “Fierce Wolf,” was, about\r\nthe year 1520, not only deposed, but confined for life in a cell\r\nin the castle of Garth, which was, therefore, long regarded by the\r\npeople with a kind of superstitious terror. The clans even sometimes\r\ninterfered with the choice of the chiefs in changing their places\r\nof abode, or in selecting a site for a new residence. The Earl of\r\nSeaforth was prevented by his clan (the M’Kenzies) from demolishing\r\nBrahan castle, the principal seat of the family. In the same way the\r\nLaird of Glenorchy, ancestor of the Marquis of Breadalbane, having\r\nsome time previous to the year 1570, laid the foundation of a castle\r\nwhich he intended to build on a hill on the side of Lochtay, was\r\ncompelled, or induced, by his people, to change his plan and build\r\nthe castle of Balloch or Taymouth.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, it will be perceived that the influence\r\nof a chief with his clan depended much on his personal qualities,\r\nof which kindness and a condescension, which admitted of an easy\r\nfamiliarity, were necessary traits. Captain Burt, the author of\r\n‘Letters from the North,’ thus alludes to the familiarity which\r\nexisted between a chief and his clan, and the affability and courtesy\r\nwith which they were accustomed to be treated: “And as the meanest\r\namong them pretended to be his relations by consanguinity, they\r\ninsisted on the privilege of taking him by the hand whenever they met\r\nhim. Concerning this last, I once saw a number of very discontented\r\ncountenances when a certain lord, one of the chiefs, endeavoured to\r\nevade this ceremony. It was in the presence of an English gentleman,\r\nof high station, from whom he would willingly have concealed the\r\nknowledge of such seeming familiarity with slaves of wretched\r\nappearance; and thinking it, I suppose, a kind of contradiction to\r\nwhat he had often boasted at other times, viz., his despotic power in\r\nhis clan.”\r\n\r\nFrom the feeling of self-respect which the urbanity and condescension\r\nof the chiefs naturally created in the minds of the people, arose\r\nthat honourable principle of fidelity to superiors and to their\r\ntrust, which we have already noticed, “and which,” says General\r\nStewart, “was so generally and so forcibly imbibed, that the man who\r\nbetrayed his trust was considered unworthy of the name which he bore,\r\nor of the kindred to which he belonged.”\r\n\r\nFrom this principle flowed a marked detestation of treachery, a vice\r\nof very rare occurrence among the Highlanders; and so tenacious were\r\nthey on that point, that the slightest suspicion of infidelity on the\r\npart of an individual estranged him from the society of his clan,\r\nwho shunned him as a person with whom it was dangerous any longer to\r\nassociate. The case of John Du Cameron, better known, from his large\r\nsize, by the name of Sergeant Mor,[519] affords an example of this.\r\nThis man had been a sergeant in the French service, and returned to\r\nScotland in the year 1745, when he engaged in the rebellion. Having\r\nno fixed abode, and dreading the consequences of having served in\r\nthe French army, and of being afterwards engaged in the rebellion,\r\nhe formed a party of freebooters, and took up his residence among\r\nthe mountains on the borders of the counties of Perth, Inverness,\r\nand Argyle, where he carried on a system of spoliation by carrying\r\noff the cattle of those he called his enemies, if they did not\r\npurchase his forbearance by the payment of _black mail_. Cameron\r\nhad long been in the habit of sleeping in a barn on the farm of\r\nDunan in Rannoch; but having been betrayed by some person, he was\r\napprehended one night when asleep in the barn, in the year 1753, by\r\na party of Lieutenant (after Sir Hector) Munro’s detachment. He was\r\ncarried to Perth, and there tried before the court of justiciary\r\nfor the murder alluded to in the note, and various acts of theft\r\nand cattle-stealing. Being found guilty, he was executed at Perth\r\nin 1753. It was generally believed in the country that Cameron had\r\nbeen betrayed by the man in whose barn he had taken shelter, and the\r\ncircumstance of his renting a farm from government, on the forfeited\r\nestate of Strowan, on advantageous terms, strengthened the suspicion;\r\nbut beyond this there was nothing to confirm the imputation. Yet\r\nthis man was ever after heartily despised, and having by various\r\nmisfortunes lost all his property, which obliged him to leave the\r\ncountry in great poverty, the people firmly believed that his\r\nmisfortunes were a just judgment upon him for violating the trust\r\nreposed in him by an unsuspecting and unfortunate person.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the leading characteristics of this remarkable\r\nrace of people, who preserved many of their national peculiarities\r\ntill a comparatively recent period. These, whoever, are now fast\r\ndisappearing before the march of modern improvement and civilization;\r\nand we are sorry to add that the vices which seem almost inseparable\r\nfrom this new state of society have found their way into some parts\r\nof the Highlands, and supplanted, to a certain extent, many of those\r\nshining virtues which were once the glory of the Gael.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XVIII.,\r\n\r\n  Containing notices by contemporary writers, from the 11th century\r\n  downwards, of the dress and arms of the Highlanders; extracted\r\n  from the Iona Club publication, _Collectanea de rebus Albanicis_.\r\n\r\nMagnus Berfaet’s Saga.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1093. It is said when King Magnus returned from his\r\n  expedition in the west, that he adopted the costume in use in the\r\n  western lands, and likewise many of his followers; that they went\r\n  about barelegged having short tunics (W. kyrtles), and also upper\r\n  garments; and so many men called him Barelegged or Barefoot.\r\n\r\nAndrew Wyntoun (1420), referring to the combat on N. Inch, says,\r\n\r\n      At Sanct Johnstone beside the Freris,\r\n      All thai entrit in Barreris\r\n      Wyth Bow and Ax, Knyf and Swerd,\r\n      To deil amang them their last werd.\r\n\r\nJohn Major (1512).\r\n\r\n  From the middle of their thigh to the foot they have no covering\r\n  for the leg, clothing themselves with a mantle instead of an\r\n  upper garment, and a shirt dyed with saffron. They always carry a\r\n  bow and arrows, a very broad sword with a small halbert, a large\r\n  dagger, sharpened on one side only, but very sharp, under the\r\n  belt. In time of war they cover their whole body with a shirt of\r\n  mail of iron rings, and fight in that. The common people of the\r\n  Highland Scots rush into battle, having their body clothed with a\r\n  linen garment manifoldly sewed and painted or daubed with pitch,\r\n  with a covering of deerskin.\r\n\r\nIn another place he speaks much to the same purport.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, in August\r\n1538, we find the following entries regarding a Highland dress made\r\nfor King James V., on the occasion of that monarch making a hunting\r\nexcursion into the Highlands:--\r\n\r\n  ITEM in the first for ii elnis ane quarter elne of variant\r\n  cullorit velvet to be the Kingis Grace are schort _Heland_\r\n  coit price of the elne vi^{lib} summa                xiii^{lib} x^s.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for iii elnis quarter elne of grene taffatys to lyne\r\n  the said coit with, price of the elne x^s summa        xxxii^s vi^d.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for iii elnis of _Heland tartane_ to be hoiss to\r\n  the Kingis Grace, price of the elne iiii^s iiii^d summa      xiii^s.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for xv elnis of holland claith to be syde Heland sarkis\r\n  to the Kingis Grace, price of the elne viii^s summa        vi^{lib}.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for sewing and making of the said sarkis                  ix^s.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for twa unce of silk to sew thame                          x^s.\r\n\r\n  ITEM for iiii elnis of rubanis to the handis of thame          ii^s.\r\n\r\nLetter written by John Elder, a Highland priest, to Henry VIII.\r\n(1543).\r\n\r\n  Moreover, wherefor they call us in Scotland Reddshankes, and in\r\n  your Graces dominion of England, roghe footide Scottis, Pleas it\r\n  your Maiestie to understande, that we of all people can tollerat,\r\n  suffir, and away best with colde, for boithe somer and wyntir\r\n  (excepte when the froest is most vehemonte), goynge alwaies bair\r\n  leggide and bair footide, our delite and pleasure is not onely\r\n  in huntynge of redd deir, wolfes, foxes, and graies, whereof we\r\n  abounde, and have greate plentie, but also in rynninge, leapinge,\r\n  swymmynge, shootynge, and thrawinge of dartis: therfor, in so\r\n  moche as we use and delite so to go alwaies, the tendir delicatt\r\n  gentillmen of Scotland call us _Reddshankes_.

They be clothed with ane\r\n  mantle, with ane schirt saffroned after the Irisch manner, going\r\n  bair-legged to the knee. Thair weapones ar bowis and dartes, with\r\n  ane verie broad sword and ane dagger scharp onlie at the on edge.\r\n\r\nJohn Lesley, Bishop of Ross, who published his work _De origine,\r\nmoribus et rebus gestis Scotorum_ at Rome in 1578, thus describes the\r\narms and dress of the old Scots, which were still in his time used by\r\nthe Highlanders and Islanders:--\r\n\r\n  In battle and hostile encounter their missile weapons were a\r\n  lance and arrows. They used also a two-edged sword which, with\r\n  the foot soldiers was pretty long, and short for the horse;\r\n  both had it broad, and with an edge so exceeding sharp that at\r\n  one blow it would easily cut a man in two. For defence, they\r\n  used a coat of mail, woven of iron rings, which they wore over\r\n  a leather jerkin, stout and of handsome appearance, which we\r\n  call an aeton. Their whole armour was light, that they might the\r\n  more easily slip from their enemies’ hands if they chanced to\r\n  fall into such a strait. Their clothing was made for use (being\r\n  chiefly suited to war), and not for ornament. All, both nobles\r\n  and common people, wore mantles of one sort (except that the\r\n  nobles preferred those of several colours). These were long and\r\n  flowing, but capable of being neatly gathered up at pleasure\r\n  into folds. I am inclined to believe that they were the same as\r\n  those to which the ancients gave the name of brachal. Wrapped up\r\n  in these for their only covering they would sleep comfortably.\r\n  They had also shaggy rugs, such as the Irish use at the present\r\n  day, some fitted for a journey, others to be placed on a bed.\r\n  The rest of their garments consisted of a short woollen jacket\r\n  with the sleeves open below for the convenience of throwing their\r\n  darts, and a covering for the thighs of the simplest kind, more\r\n  for decency than for show or a defence against cold. They made\r\n  also of linen, very large shirts, with numerous folds and wide\r\n  sleeves, which flowed abroad loosely to their knees. These, the\r\n  rich coloured with saffron, and others smeared with some grease\r\n  to preserve them longer clean among the toils and exercises of a\r\n  camp, which they held it of the highest consequence to practise\r\n  continually. In the manufacture of these, ornament and a certain\r\n  attention to taste were not altogether neglected, and they\r\n  joined the different parts of their shirts very neatly with silk\r\n  threads, chiefly of a green or red colour.\r\n\r\n  Their women’s attire was very becoming. Over a gown reaching to\r\n  the ancles, and generally embroidered, they wore large mantles of\r\n  the kind already described, and woven of different colours. Their\r\n  chief ornaments were the bracelets and necklaces with which they\r\n  decorated their arms and necks.\r\n\r\nGeorge Buchanan (pub. 1582, thus translated by Monypenny 1612).\r\n\r\n  They delight in marled clothes, specially that have long stripes\r\n  of sundry colours; they love chiefly purple and blew. Their\r\n  predecessors used short mantles or plaids of divers colours\r\n  sundry waies devided; and amongst some, the same custome is\r\n  observed to this day; but for the most part now they are browne,\r\n  more nere to the colour of the hadder; to the effect when they\r\n  lie amongst the hadder the bright colour of their plaids shall\r\n  not bewray them; with the which, rather coloured than clad,\r\n  they suffer the most cruel tempests that blow in the open field\r\n  in such sort, that under a wrythe of snow they slepe sound....\r\n  Their armour wherewith they cover their bodies in time of werre,\r\n  is an iron bonnet and an habbergion side (long) almost even to\r\n  their heeles. Their weapones against their enemies are bowes and\r\n  arrowes. The arrows are for the most part hooked, with a bauble\r\n  on either side, which once entered within the body cannot be\r\n  drawn forth againe, unlesse the wounde be made wider. Some of\r\n  them fight with broad swords and axes.\r\n\r\nNicolay d’Arfeville, Cosmographer to King of France, pub. 1583, a\r\nvol. on Scotland, speaks thus:--\r\n\r\n  They [wild Scots] weir like the Irish, a long large and full\r\n  shirt, coloured with saffron, and over this a garment hanging\r\n  to the knee, of thick wool, after the manner of a cassock. They\r\n  go with bare heads, and allow the hair to grow very long, and\r\n  they wear neither stockings nor shoes, except some who have\r\n  buskins made in a very old fashion, which come as high as their\r\n  knees. Their arms are the bow and arrow, and some darts, which\r\n  they throw with great dexterity, and a large sword, with a\r\n  single-edged dagger. They are very swift of foot, and there is no\r\n  horse so swift as to outstrip them, as I have seen proved several\r\n  times, both in England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn 1594, when Red Hugh O’Donnell, Lord of Tirconall in Ulster, was in\r\nrebellion against Queen Elizabeth, he was assisted for some time by a\r\nbody of auxiliaries from the Hebrides. These warriors are described\r\nin the following terms in the Life of Hugh O’Donnell, originally\r\nwritten in Irish by Peregrine O’Clery, and since translated by the\r\nlate Edward O’Reilly, Esq.\r\n\r\n  The outward clothing they (the auxiliaries from the isles) wore,\r\n  was a mottled garment with numerous colours hanging in folds\r\n  to the calf of the leg, with a girdle round the loins over\r\n  the garment. Some of them with horn-hafted swords, large and\r\n  military, over their shoulders. A man when he had to strike with\r\n  them, was obliged to apply both his hands to the haft.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, the Water Poet, made an excursion to Scotland in 1618,\r\nof which he published an amusing account under the title of _The\r\nPennylesse Pilgrimage_. He describes the dress of the Highlanders\r\nin the following account he gives of his visit to Braemar for the\r\npurpose of paying his respects to the Earl of Mar and Sir W. Moray of\r\nAbercairney.\r\n\r\n  Thus, with extreme travell, ascending and descending, mounting\r\n  and alighting, I came at night to the place where I would be,\r\n  in the Brae of Marr, which is a large county all composed of\r\n  such mountaines, that Shooters hill, Gads hill, Highgate hill,\r\n  Hampstead hill, Birdlip hill, or Malvernes hills, are but\r\n  mole-hills in comparison, or like a liver, or a gizzard under\r\n  a capon’s wing, in respect to the altitude of their tops, or\r\n  perpendicularite of their bottomes. There I saw mount Benawne\r\n  with a furrd’d mist upon his snowy head instead of a night-cap;\r\n  for you must understand, that the oldest man alive never saw\r\n  but the snow was on the top of divers of those hills, (both in\r\n  summer as well as in winter). There did I find the truely noble\r\n  and Right Honourable Lords John Erskine, Earle of Marr, James\r\n  Stuart, Earle of Murray, George Gordon, Earle of Engye, sonne and\r\n  heire to the Marquise of Huntley, James Erskin, Earle of Bughan,\r\n  and John, Lord Erskin, sonne and heire to the Earle of Marr, and\r\n  their Countesses, with my much honoured, and my best assured\r\n  and approved friend, Sir William Murray, Knight, of Abercarny,\r\n  and hundred of others, knights, esquires, and their followers;\r\n  _all_ and every man in generall, in one habit, as if Licurgus\r\n  had been there, and made lawes of equality. For once in the\r\n  yeere, which is the whole moneth of August, and sometimes part of\r\n  September, many of the nobility and gentry of the kingdome (for\r\n  their pleasure) doe come into these Highland countries to hunt,\r\n  where they doe conforme themselves to the habite of the Highland\r\n  men, who, for the moste part, speake nothing but Irish; and in\r\n  former time were those people which were called the _Red-shanks_.\r\n  Their habite is shooes with but one sole apiece; stockings (which\r\n  they call short hose) made of a warme stuff of divers colours,\r\n  which they call tartane. As for breeches, many of them, nor their\r\n  forefathers, ever wore any, but a jerkin of the same stuffe that\r\n  their hose is of, their garters being bands or wreathes of hay or\r\n  straw, with a plaed about their shoulders, which is a mantle of\r\n  divers colours, much finer and lighter stuffe than their hose,\r\n  with blue flat caps on their heads, a handkerchiefe knit with two\r\n  knots about their necke; and thus are they attyred. Now, their\r\n  weapons are long bowes and forked arrowes, swords and targets,\r\n  harquebusses, muskets, durks, and Loquhabor-axes. With these\r\n  armes I found many of them armed for the hunting. As for their\r\n  attire, any man of what degree soever that comes amongst them,\r\n  must not disdaine to weare it; for if they doe, then they will\r\n  disdaine to hunt, or willingly to bring in their dogges; but\r\n  if men be kind unto them, and be in their habit, then are they\r\n  conquered with kindnesse, and the sport will be plentifull. This\r\n  was the reason that I found so many noblemen and gentlemen in\r\n  those shapes. But to proceed to the hunting.\r\n\r\n  My good Lord of Marr having put me into that shape, I rode with\r\n  him from his house, where I saw the ruines of an old castle,\r\n  called the castle of Kindroghit. It was built by king Malcolm\r\n  Canmore (for a hunting house), who raigned in Scotland when\r\n  Edward the Confessor, Harold, and Norman William raigned in\r\n  England; I speak of it, because it was the last house that I saw\r\n  in those parts; for I was the space of twelve dayes after, before\r\n  I saw either house, corne-field, or habitation for any creature,\r\n  but deere, wild horses, wolves, and such like creatures, which\r\n  made me doubt that I should never have seene a house againe.\r\n\r\nDefoe, in his _Memoirs of a Cavalier_, written about 1721, and\r\nobviously composed from authentic materials, thus describes the\r\nHighland part of the Scottish army which invaded England in 1639, at\r\nthe commencement of the great civil war. The Cavalier having paid a\r\nvisit to the Scottish camp to satisfy his curiosity, thus proceeds:--\r\n\r\n  I confess the soldiers made a very uncouth figure, especially the\r\n  Highlanders: the oddness and barbarity of their garb and arms\r\n  seemed to have something in it remarkable. They were generally\r\n  tall swinging fellows; their swords were extravagantly and I\r\n  think insignificantly broad, and they carried great wooden\r\n  targets, large enough to cover the upper part of their bodies.\r\n  Their dress was as antique as the rest; a cap on their heads,\r\n  called by them a bonnet, long hanging sleeves behind, and their\r\n  doublet, breeches, and stockings, of a stuff they called plaid,\r\n  stripped across red and yellow, with short cloaks of the same.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cleland, Lieutenant-Colonel to the Earl of Angus’s regiment,\r\nwho was killed whilst gallantly defending his post at Dunkeld,\r\nagainst a party of Highlanders, soon after the Revolution, wrote a\r\nsatirical poem upon the expedition of the Highland host in 1678, from\r\nwhich the following extract is taken:--\r\n\r\n      Their head, their neck, their legs, their thighs\r\n      Are influenced by the skies,\r\n      Without a clout to interrupt them\r\n      They need not strip them when they whip them;\r\n      Nor loose their doublet when they’re hanged.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      But those who were their chief Commanders,\r\n      As such who bore the pirnie standards,\r\n      Who led the van, and drove the rear,\r\n      Were right well mounted of their gear;\r\n      With brogues, trues, and pirnie plaides,\r\n      With good blew bonnets on their heads,\r\n      Which on the one side had a flipe\r\n      Adorn’d with a tobacco pipe,\r\n      With durk, and snap work, and snuff mill,\r\n      A bagg which they with onions fill,\r\n      And, as their strik observers say,\r\n      A tupe horn fill’d with usquebay;\r\n      A slasht out coat beneath her plaids,\r\n      A targe of timber, nails and hides;\r\n      With a long two-handed sword,\r\n      As good’s the country can affoord.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  they’re smear’d with tar,\r\n      Which doth defend them heel and neck,\r\n      Just as it doth their sheep protect.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sacheverell, governor of the Isle of Man, made an excursion\r\nin 1688 through the Isle of Mull, and thence to Icolmkill. An account\r\nof this he published in 1702, in which he describes from observation,\r\nthe dress, armour, and appearance of the Highlanders.\r\n\r\n  During my stay, I generally observed the men to be large-bodied,\r\n  stout, subtle, active, patient of cold and hunger. There appeared\r\n  in all their actions a certain generous air of freedom, and\r\n  contempt of those trifles, luxury and ambition, which we so\r\n  servilely creep after. They bound their appetites by their\r\n  necessities, and their happiness consists, not in having\r\n  much, but in coveting little. The women seem to have the same\r\n  sentiments with the men; though their habits were mean, and they\r\n  had not our sort of breeding, yet in many of them there was a\r\n  natural beauty and a graceful modesty, which never fails of\r\n  attracting. The usual outward habit of both sexes is the pladd;\r\n  the women’s much finer, the colours more lively, and the squares\r\n  larger than the men’s, and put me in mind of the ancient Picts.\r\n  This serves them for a veil, and covers both head and body. The\r\n  men wear theirs after another manner, especially when designed\r\n  for ornament: it is loose and flowing, like the mantles our\r\n  painters give their heroes. Their thighs are bare, with brawny\r\n  muscles. Nature has drawn all her strokes bold and masterly;\r\n  _what is covered is only adapted to necessity_--a thin brogue\r\n  on the foot, a short buskin of various colours on the leg, tied\r\n  above the calf with a striped pair of garters. What should be\r\n  concealed is hid with a large shot-pouch, on each side of which\r\n  hangs a pistol and a dagger, as if they found it necessary to\r\n  keep those parts well guarded. A round target on their backs,\r\n  a blue bonnet on their heads, in one hand a broadsword, and a\r\n  musquet in the other. Perhaps no nation goes better armed; and\r\n  I assure you they will handle them with bravery and dexterity,\r\n  especially the sword and target, as our veteran regiments found\r\n  to their cost at Killiecrankie.\r\n\r\nThe following minute description of Highland dress is contained in\r\nMartin’s _Western Isles of Scotland_:--\r\n\r\n  The first habit wore by persons of distinction in the islands,\r\n  was the _leni-croich_, from the Irish word _leni_, which\r\n  signifies a shirt, and _croch_, saffron, because their shirt was\r\n  died with that herb: the ordinary number of ells used to make\r\n  this robe was twenty-four; it was the upper garb, reaching below\r\n  the knees, and was tied with a belt round the middle; but the\r\n  islanders have laid it aside about a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n  They now generally use coat, wastcoat, and breeches, as\r\n  elsewhere, and on their heads wear bonnets made of thick cloth,\r\n  some blew, some black, and some gray.\r\n\r\n  Many of the people wear _trowis_. Some have them very fine woven\r\n  like stockings of those made of cloath; some are coloured and\r\n  others striped; the latter are as well shap’d as the former,\r\n  lying close to the body from the middle downwards, and tied round\r\n  with a belt above the haunches. There is a square piece of cloth\r\n  which hangs down before. The measure for shaping the trowis is a\r\n  stick of wood whose length is a cubit, and that divided into the\r\n  length of a finger, and half a finger; so that it requires more\r\n  skill to make it, than the ordinary habit.\r\n\r\n  The shooes anciently wore, was a piece of the hide of a deer,\r\n  cow, or horse, with the hair on, being tied behind and before\r\n  with a point of leather. The generality now wear shooes having\r\n  one thin sole only, and shaped after the right and left foot; so\r\n  that what is for one foot, will not serve the other.\r\n\r\n  But persons of distinction wear the garb in fashion in the south\r\n  of Scotland.\r\n\r\n  The plad wore only by the men, is made of fine wool, the thread\r\n  as fine as can be made of that kind; it consists of divers\r\n  colours, and there is a great deal of ingenuity requir’d in\r\n  sorting the colours, so as to be agreeable to the nicest fancy.\r\n  For this reason the women are at great pains, first to give an\r\n  exact pattern of the plade upon a piece of wood, having the\r\n  number of every thread of the stripe on it. The length of it\r\n  is commonly seven double ells; the one end hangs by the middle\r\n  over the left arm, the other going round the body, hangs by the\r\n  end over the left arm also. The right hand above it is to be at\r\n  liberty to do any thing upon occasion. Every isle differs from\r\n  each other in their fancy of making plaids, as to the stripes in\r\n  breadth and colours. This humour is as different thro’ the main\r\n  land of the Highlands, insofar that they who have seen those\r\n  places, is able at the first view of a man’s plaid, to guess the\r\n  place of his residence.\r\n\r\n  When they travel on foot, the plaid is tied on the breast with a\r\n  bodkin of bone or wood, (just as the _spina_ wore by the Germans,\r\n  according to the description of C. Tacitus;) the plaid is tied\r\n  round the middle with a leather belt; it is pleated from the belt\r\n  to the knee very nicely; this dress for footmen is found much\r\n  easier and lighter than breeches, or trowis.\r\n\r\n  The ancient dress wore by the women, and which is yet wore by\r\n  some of the vulgar, called _arisad_, is a white plade, having\r\n  a few small stripes of black, blew, and red; it reached from\r\n  the neck to the heels, and was tied before on the breast with\r\n  a buckle of silver, or brass, according to the quality of the\r\n  person. I have seen some of the former of an hundred marks value;\r\n  it was broad as any ordinary pewter plate, the whole curiously\r\n  engraven with various animals, &c. There was a lesser buckle\r\n  which was wore in the middle of the larger, and above two ounces\r\n  weight; it had in the center a large piece of chrystal, or some\r\n  finer stone, and this was set all round with several finer stones\r\n  of a lesser size.\r\n\r\n  The plad being pleated all round, was tied with a belt below the\r\n  breast; the belt was of leather, and several pieces of silver\r\n  intermix’d with the leather like a chain. The lower end of the\r\n  belt has a piece of plate about eight inches long, and three\r\n  in breadth, curiously engraven; the end of which was adorned\r\n  with fine stones, or pieces of red corral. They wore sleeves of\r\n  scarlet cloth, clos’d at the end as mens vests, with gold lace\r\n  round ’em, having plate buttons set with fine stones. The head\r\n  dress was a fine kerchief of linen strait about the head, hanging\r\n  down the back taper-wise; a large lock of hair hangs down their\r\n  cheeks above their breast, the lower end tied with a knot of\r\n  ribbands.\r\n\r\n  The ancient way of fighting was by set battles, and for arms some\r\n  had broad two handed swords, and head-pieces, and others bows\r\n  and arrows. When all their arrows were spent, they attack’d one\r\n  another with sword in hand. Since the invention of guns, they\r\n  aere very early accustomed to use them, and carry their pieces\r\n  with them wherever they go: they likewise learn to handle the\r\n  broad sword, and target. The chief of each tribe advances with\r\n  his followers within shot of the enemy, having first laid aside\r\n  their upper garments; and after one general discharge, they\r\n  attack them with sword in hand, having their target on their left\r\n  hand, (as they did at Kelicranky) which soon brings the matter\r\n  to an issue, and verifies the observation made of ’em by our\r\n  historians,\r\n\r\n      Aut mors cito, aut victoria læta.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from _Letters from a Gentleman in the North of\r\nScotland_, written by Captain Burt, an English officer of Engineers,\r\nengaged under Marshal Wade on the military roads through the\r\nHighlands, begun in the year 1726:--\r\n\r\n  The Highland dress consists of a bonnet made of thrum without a\r\n  brim, a short coat, a waistcoat, longer by five or six inches,\r\n  short stockings, and brogues, or pumps without heels. By the way,\r\n  they cut holes in their brogues, though new made, to let out the\r\n  water, when they have far to go and rivers to pass: this they do\r\n  to preserve their feet from galling.\r\n\r\n  Few besides gentlemen wear the _trowze_,--that is, the breeches\r\n  and stockings all of one piece, and drawn on together; over\r\n  this habit they wear a plaid, which is usually three yards long\r\n  and two breadths wide, and the whole garb is made of chequered\r\n  tartan, or plaiding: this, with the sword and pistol, is called a\r\n  _full dress_, and, to a well-proportioned man, with any tolerable\r\n  air, it makes an agreeable figure; but this you have seen in\r\n  London, and it is chiefly their mode of dressing when they are\r\n  in the Lowlands, or when they make a neighbouring visit, or go\r\n  anywhere on horseback; but when those among them who travel on\r\n  foot, and have not attendants to carry them over the waters,\r\n  they vary it into the _quelt_, which is a manner I am about to\r\n  describe.\r\n\r\n  The common habit of the ordinary Highlanders is far from being\r\n  acceptable to the eye: with them a small part of the plaid, which\r\n  is not so large as the former, is set in folds and girt round\r\n  the waist, to make of it a short petticoat that reaches half way\r\n  down the thigh, and the rest is brought over the shoulders, and\r\n  then fastened before, below the neck, often with a fork, and\r\n  sometimes with a bodkin or sharpened piece of stick, so that they\r\n  make pretty nearly the appearance of the poor women in London\r\n  when they bring their gowns over their heads to shelter them from\r\n  the rain. In this way of wearing the plaid, they have sometimes\r\n  nothing else to cover them, and are often barefoot; but some I\r\n  have seen shod with a kind of pumps, made out of a raw cowhide,\r\n  with the hair turned outward, which being ill made, the wearer’s\r\n  foot looked something like those of a rough-footed hen or pigeon:\r\n  these are called _quarrants_, and are not only offensive to the\r\n  sight, but intolerable to the smell of those who are near them.\r\n  The stocking rises no higher than the thick of the calf, and\r\n  from the middle of the thigh to the middle of the leg is a naked\r\n  space, which, being exposed to all weathers, becomes tanned and\r\n  freckled. This dress is called the _quelt_; and, for the most\r\n  part, they wear the petticoat so very short, that in a windy day,\r\n  going up a hill, or stooping, the indecency of it is plainly\r\n  discovered.\r\n\r\n  I have observed before that the plaid serves the ordinary people\r\n  for a cloak by day and bedding at night: by the latter it imbibes\r\n  so much perspiration, that no one day can free it from the filthy\r\n  smell; and even some of better than ordinary appearance, when\r\n  the plaid falls from the shoulder, or otherwise requires to be\r\n  re-adjusted, while you are talking with them, toss it over again,\r\n  as some people do the knots of their wigs, which conveys the\r\n  offence in whiffs that are intolerable;--of this they seem not\r\n  to be sensible, for it is often done only to give themselves airs.\r\n\r\n  The plaid is the undress of the ladies; and to a genteel woman,\r\n  who adjusts it with a good air, is a becoming veil. But as I am\r\n  pretty sure you never saw one of them in England, I shall employ\r\n  a few words to describe it to you. It is made of silk or fine\r\n  worsted, chequered with various lively colours, two breadths\r\n  wide, and three yards in length; it is brought over the head, and\r\n  may hide or discover the face according to the wearer’s fancy or\r\n  occasion: it reaches to the waist behind; one corner falls as low\r\n  as the ankle on one side; and the other part, in folds, hangs\r\n  down from the opposite arm.\r\n\r\n  The ordinary girls wear nothing upon their heads until they are\r\n  married or have a child, except sometimes a fillet of red or blue\r\n  coarse cloth, of which they are very proud; but often their hair\r\n  hangs down over the forehead like that of a wild colt. If they\r\n  wear stockings, which is very rare, they lay them in plaits one\r\n  above another, from the ancle up to the calf, to make their legs\r\n  appear as near as they can in the form of a cylinder; but I think\r\n  I have seen something like this among the poor German refugee\r\n  women and the Moorish men in London.\r\n\r\nMr. Gough, in his additions to Camden’s _Britannia_, gives the\r\nfollowing accurate description of the Highland dress and armour, as\r\nthey were to be found in the district of Breadalbane previous to the\r\nproscription of the dress:--\r\n\r\n  The dress of the men is the _brechan_ or plaid, 12 or 13 yards\r\n  of narrow stuff wrapped round the middle, and reaching to the\r\n  knees, often girt round the waist, and in cold weather covering\r\n  the whole body, even on the open hills, all night, and fastened\r\n  on the shoulders with a brooch; short stockings tied below the\r\n  knee; _truish_, a genteeler kind of breeches, and stockings of\r\n  one piece; _cueranen_, a laced shoe of skin, with the hairy side\r\n  out, rather disused; _kilt_ or fillibeg, g. d. little plaid, or\r\n  short petticoat, reaching to the knees, substituted of late to\r\n  the longer end of the plaid; and lastly, the pouch of badger or\r\n  other skins, with tassels hanging before them.\r\n\r\n  The women’s dress is the _kerch_, or white linen pinned round\r\n  behind like a hood, and over the foreheads of married women,\r\n  whereas maidens wear only a _snood_ or ribbon round their heads;\r\n  the _tanac_ or plaid fastened over their shoulders, and drawn\r\n  over their heads in bad weather; a plaited long stocking, called\r\n  _ossan_, is their high dress.\r\n\r\nThe following detail of the complete equipment of a Highland chief\r\nwas communicated by a Highland gentleman to _Charles Grant, Vicomte\r\nde Vaux_, by whom it was printed in his _Mémoires de la Maison de\r\nGrant_, in 1796:--\r\n\r\n  No. 1.  A full-trimmed bonnet.\r\n      2.  A tartan jacket, vest, kilt, and cross-belt.\r\n      3.  A tartan belted plaid.\r\n      4.  -------- pair of hose, made up [of cloth].\r\n      5.  A tartan pair of stockings, ditto, with yellow\r\n            garters.\r\n      6.  Two pair of brogs.\r\n      7.  A silver-mounted purse and belt.\r\n      8.  A target with spear.\r\n      9.  A broadsword.\r\n     10.  A pair of pistols and bullet-mould.\r\n     11.  A dirk, knife, fork, and belt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[465] For much of the matter in this chapter we must confess\r\nourselves indebted to General Stewart’s admirable and interesting\r\n_Sketches of the Highlanders_, a well-stored repository of\r\ninformation on all points connected with the ancient manners and\r\ncustoms of the Highlands.\r\n\r\n[466] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. pp. 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[467] Martin’s _Western Islands_, 2d edit. pp. 194, 195.\r\n\r\n[468] Logan, vol. i. pp. 404, 405.\r\n\r\n[469] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 74.\r\n\r\n[470] _Highlands_, vol. i. p. 180.\r\n\r\n[471] Martin’s _Western Islands_, 2d edit. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[472] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 78.\r\n\r\n[473] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 76.\r\n\r\n[474] Graham’s _Sketches of Perthshire_.\r\n\r\n[475] Idem.\r\n\r\n[476]\r\n      “It was a wild and strange retreat,\r\n      As e’er was trod by outlaw’s feet.\r\n      The dell, upon the mountain’s crest,\r\n      Yawned like a gash on warrior’s breast;\r\n      Its trench had staid full many a rock,\r\n      Hurl’d by primeval earthquake shock\r\n      From Ben-Venue’s grey summit wild,\r\n      And here, in random ruin piled,\r\n      They frowned incumbent o’er the spot,\r\n      And formed the rugged sylvan grot.\r\n      The oak and birch, with mingled shade,\r\n      At noontide there a twilight made,\r\n      Unless where short and sudden shone\r\n      From straggling beam on cliff or stone,\r\n      With such a glimpse as prophet’s eye\r\n      Gains on thy depth, Futurity.\r\n\r\n      No murmur wak’d the solemn still,\r\n      Save tinkling of a fountain rill;\r\n      But when the wind chafed with the lake,\r\n      A sullen sound would upward break,\r\n      With dashing hollow voice, that spoke\r\n      The incessant war of wave and rock.\r\n      Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,\r\n      Seem’d nodding o’er the cavern grey.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Grey Superstition’s whisper dread,\r\n      Debarred the spot to vulgar tread;\r\n      For there, she said, did fays resort,\r\n      And satyrs hold their sylvan court,\r\n      By moon-light tread their mystic maze,\r\n      And blast the rash beholder’s gaze.”\r\n\r\n            _Lady of the Lake_, c. iii. s. 26.\r\n\r\n[477] Graham’s _Sketches_.\r\n\r\n[478] The belief in _Fairies_ is a popular superstition among the\r\nShetlanders. The margin of a small lake called the Sandy Loch,\r\nabout two miles from Lerwick, is celebrated for having been their\r\nfavourite resort. It is said that they often walk in procession along\r\nthe sides of the loch in different costumes. Some of the natives\r\nused frequently, when passing by a knoll, to stop and listen to the\r\nmusic of the fairies, and when the music ceased, they would hear\r\nthe rattling of the pewter plates which were to be used at supper.\r\nThe fairies sometimes visit the Shetland barns, from which they are\r\nusually ejected by means of a _flail_, which the proprietor wields\r\nwith great agility, thumping and thrashing in every direction.\r\n\r\n[479] ROBERTUS KIRK, A.

The unhappy mother must take\r\nas much care of this phantom as she did of her child, and on no\r\naccount destroy it, otherwise, it is believed, the fairies will not\r\nrestore her child to her. “This is not my bairn,” said a mother to a\r\nneighbour who was condoling with her on the wasted appearance of her\r\ninfant, then sitting on her knee,--“this is not my bairn--may the\r\nd--l rest where my bairn now is!”\r\n\r\n[481] Graham’s _Sketches_.\r\n\r\n[482] MS.

In the Highlands the piper is always in\r\nthe open air; and when people wish to dance to his music, it is on\r\nthe green, if the weather permits; nothing but necessity makes them\r\nattempt a pipe-dance in the house. The bagpipe was a field instrument\r\nintended to call the clans to arms, and animate them in battle, and\r\nwas no more intended for a house than a round of six-pounders. A\r\nbroadside from a first-rate, or a round from a battery, has a sublime\r\nand impressive effect at a proper distance. In the same manner, the\r\nsound of bagpipes, softened by distance, had an indescribable effect\r\non the mind and actions of the Highlanders. But as few would choose\r\nto be under the muzzle of the guns of a battery, so I have seldom\r\nseen a Highlander, whose ears were not grated when close to pipes,\r\nhowever much his breast might be warmed, and his feelings roused,\r\nby the sounds to which he had been accustomed in his youth, when\r\nproceeding from the proper distance.”--_Sketches_, App. xxiii.\r\n\r\n[493] Dr. M’Queen’s Dissertation.\r\n\r\n[494] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 86.\r\n\r\n[495] Stewart’s _Sketches_.\r\n\r\n[496] Two remarkable instances of the regard paid by the Highlanders\r\nto their engagements, are given by General Stewart. “A gentleman of\r\nthe name of Stewart, agreed to lend a considerable sum of money to a\r\nneighbour. When they had met, and the money was already counted down\r\nupon the table, the borrower offered a receipt. As soon as the lender\r\n(grandfather of the late Mr. Stewart of Ballachulish) heard this, he\r\nimmediately collected the money, saying, that a man who could not\r\ntrust his own word, without a bond, should not be trusted by him,\r\nand should have none of his money, which he put up in his purse and\r\nreturned home.” An inhabitant of the same district kept a retail\r\nshop for nearly fifty years, and supplied the whole district, then\r\nfull of people, with all their little merchandise. He neither gave\r\nnor asked any receipts. At Martinmas of each year he collected the\r\namount of his sales, which were always paid to a day. In one of his\r\nannual rounds, a customer happened to be from home; consequently, he\r\nreturned unpaid, but before he was out of bed the following morning,\r\nhe was awakened by a call from his customer, who came to pay his\r\naccount. After the business was settled, his neighbour said, “You are\r\nnow paid; I would not for my best cow that I should sleep while you\r\nwanted your money after your term of payment, and that I should be\r\nthe last in the country in your debt.” Such examples of stern honesty\r\nare now, alas! of rare occurrence. Many of the virtues which adorned\r\nthe Highland character have disappeared in the vortex of modern\r\nimprovement, by which the country has been completely revolutionized.\r\n\r\n[497] On the Superstitions of the Highlanders.\r\n\r\n[498] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 82.\r\n\r\n[499] Id.\r\n\r\n[500] Stewart’s _Sketches_.\r\n\r\n[501] Mrs. Grant’s _Superstitions of the Highlanders_.\r\n\r\n[502] _Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland_, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[503] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 22.\r\n\r\n[504] The power of the chiefs over their clans was, from political\r\nmotives, often supported by the government, to counteract the great\r\ninfluence of the feudal system which enabled the nobles frequently\r\nto set the authority of the state at defiance. Although the Duke of\r\nGordon was the feudal superior of the lands held by the Camerons,\r\nM’Phersons, M’Donells of Keppoch and others, he had no influence over\r\nthose clans who always obeyed the orders of Lochiel, Clunie, Keppoch,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[505] Martin observes that in the Western Islands, “every heir, or\r\nyoung chieftain of a tribe, was obliged in honour to give a public\r\nspecimen of his valour before he was owned and declared governor or\r\nleader of his people, who obeyed and followed him upon all occasions.\r\nThis chieftain was usually attended with a retinue of young men of\r\nquality, who had not beforehand given any proof of their valour, and\r\nwere ambitious of such an opportunity to signalize themselves. It was\r\nusual for the captain to lead them, to make a desperate incursion\r\nupon some neighbour or other that they were in feud with, and they\r\nwere obliged to bring, by open force, the cattle they found on the\r\nlands they attacked, or to die in the attempt. After the performance\r\nof this achievement, the young chieftain was ever after reputed\r\nvaliant, and worthy of government, and such as were of his retinue\r\nacquired the like reputation. This custom being reciprocally used\r\namong them, was not reputed robbery, for the damage which one tribe\r\nsustained by this essay of the chieftain of another, was repaired\r\nwhen their chieftain came in his turn to make his specimen; but I\r\nhave not heard an instance of this practice for these sixty years\r\npast.”--_Western Islands_, 2d edit. pp. 101, 102.\r\n\r\n[506] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[507] Idem, vol. i. pp. 30, 31.\r\n\r\n[508] General Stewart says that the families of the name of Stewart,\r\nwhose estates lay in the district of Athole, and whose chief, by\r\nbirth, was at a distance, ranged themselves under the family of\r\nAthole, though they were themselves sufficiently numerous to raise\r\n1000 fighting men.\r\n\r\n[509] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. pp. 33, 34.\r\n\r\n[510] “When a quarrel begins in words between two Highlanders of\r\ndifferent clans, it is esteemed the very height of malice and\r\nrancour, and the greatest of all provocations, to reproach one\r\nanother with the vices or personal defects of their chiefs, or that\r\nof the particular branch whence they sprung”--Burt’s _Letters_.\r\n\r\n[511] Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 35.\r\n\r\n[512] For an account of this notorious individual, see the history of\r\nthe clan Macgregor in the second part of this work.\r\n\r\n[513] General Stewart observes, that the Marshal had not at this\r\nperiod been long enough in the Highlands to distinguish a cearnach,\r\nor “lifter of cattle,” from a highwayman. “No such character as the\r\nlatter then existed in the country; and it may be presumed he did not\r\nconsider these men in the light which the word would indicate,--for\r\ncertainly the Commander-in-chief would neither have associated with\r\nmen whom he supposed to be really highwaymen, nor partaken of their\r\nhospitality.”\r\n\r\n[514] _Culloden Papers._\r\n\r\n[515] This was noticed by Dr. Johnson. He thus describes\r\na meeting between the young laird of Coll and some of his\r\n“subjects:”--“Wherever we roved, we were pleased to see the reverence\r\nwith which his subjects regarded him. He did not endeavour to\r\ndazzle them by any magnificence of dress,--his only distinction was\r\na feather in his bonnet; but as soon as he appeared, they forsook\r\ntheir work and clustered about him: he took them by the hand, and\r\nthey seemed mutually delighted. He has the proper disposition of a\r\nchieftain, and seems desirous to continue the customs of his house.\r\nThe bagpiper played regularly when dinner was served, whose person\r\nand dress made a good appearance; and he brought no disgrace upon the\r\nfamily of Rankin, which has long supplied the lairds of Coll with\r\nhereditary music.”--_Journey to the Western Islands._\r\n\r\n[516] _Stewart’s Sketches_, vol. i. p. 46, &c.--Dalrymple’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[517] Stewart, vol. i. p. 50.\r\n\r\n[518] A picture of the horse was in the possession of the late\r\nGeneral Stewart of Garth, being a legacy bequeathed to him by the\r\ndaughter of Mr. Menzies. “A brother of Macnaughton,” says the\r\nGeneral, “lived for many years on the estate of Garth, and died in\r\n1790. He always went about armed, at least so far armed, that when\r\ndebarred wearing a sword or dirk, he slung a large long knife in\r\nhis belt. He was one of the last I recollect of the ancient race,\r\nand gave a very favourable impression of their general manner and\r\nappearance. He was a smith by trade, and although of the lowest order\r\nof the people, he walked about with an air and manner that might have\r\nbecome a field-marshal. He spoke with great force and fluency of\r\nlanguage, and, although most respectful to those to whom he thought\r\nrespect was due, he had an appearance of independence and ease, that\r\nstrangers, ignorant of the language and character of the people,\r\nmight have supposed to proceed from impudence. As he always carried\r\narms when legally permitted, so he showed on one occasion that he\r\nknew how to handle them. When the Black Watch was quartered on the\r\nbanks of the rivers Tay and Lyon, in 1741, an affray arose between a\r\nfew of the soldiers and some of the people at a fair at Kenmore. Some\r\nof the Breadalbane men took the part of the soldiers, and, as many\r\nwere armed, swords were quickly drawn, and one of the former killed,\r\nwhen their opponents, with whom was Macnaughton, and a smith, (to\r\nwhom he was then an apprentice,) retreated and fled to the ferry-boat\r\nacross the Tay. There was no bridge, and the ferryman, on seeing the\r\nfray, chained his boat. Macnaughton was the first at the river side,\r\nand leaping into the boat, followed by his master, the smith, with\r\na stroke of his broadsword cut the chain, and crossing the river,\r\nfixed the boat on the opposite side, and thus prevented an immediate\r\npursuit. Indeed no farther steps were taken. The Earl of Breadalbane,\r\nwho was then at Taymouth, was immediately sent for. On inquiry, he\r\nfound that the whole had originated from an accidental reflection\r\nthrown out by a soldier of one of the Argyle companies against the\r\nAtholemen, then supposed to be Jacobites, and that it was difficult\r\nto ascertain who gave the fatal blow. The man who was killed was an\r\nold warrior of nearly eighty years of age. He had been with Lord\r\nBreadalbane’s men, under Campbell of Glenlyon, at the battle of\r\nSheriffmuir; and, as his side lost their cause, he swore never to\r\nshave again. He kept his word, and as his beard grew till it reached\r\nhis girdle, he got the name of Padric-na-Phaisaig, ‘Peter with the\r\nBeard.’”\r\n\r\n[519] The following amusing anecdote of this man is related by\r\nGeneral Stewart:--“On one occasion he met with an officer of the\r\ngarrison of Fort-William on the mountains of Lochaber. The officer\r\ntold him that he suspected he had lost his way, and, having a large\r\nsum of money for the garrison, was afraid of meeting the sergeant\r\nMor; he therefore requested that the stranger would accompany\r\nhim on his road. The other agreed; and, while they walked on,\r\nthey talked much of the sergeant and his feats, the officer using\r\nmuch freedom with his name, calling him robber, murderer.--‘Stop\r\nthere,’ interrupted his companion, ‘he does indeed take the cattle\r\nof the whigs and you Sassanachs, but neither he nor his cearnachs\r\never shed innocent blood; except once,’ added he, ‘that I was\r\nunfortunate at Braemar, when a man was killed, but I immediately\r\nordered the _creach_ (the spoil) to be abandoned, and left to the\r\nowners, retreating as fast as we could after such a misfortune!’\r\n‘_You_,’ says the officer, ‘what had _you_ to do with the affair?’\r\n‘I am John Du Cameron,--I am the sergeant Mor; there is the road to\r\nInverlochay,--you cannot now mistake it. You and your money are safe.\r\nTell your governor to send a more wary messenger for his gold. Tell\r\nhim also, that, although an outlaw, and forced to live on the public,\r\nI am a soldier as well as himself, and would despise taking his gold\r\nfrom a defenceless man who confided in me.’ The officer lost no time\r\nin reaching the garrison, and never forgot the adventure, which he\r\nfrequently related.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1660-1689.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGNS:--\r\n\r\nCharles II., 1660-1685. James II., (VII. of Scotland,) 1685-1688.\r\n\r\n  Trial and Execution of the Marquis of Argyle--His character--Feud\r\n  between the Earl of Argyle and the Macleans--The “Highland\r\n  Host”--The Test--Trial and Condemnation of the Earl of\r\n  Argyle--Argyle escapes--Argyle and Monmouth’s invasion--Execution\r\n  of Argyle--Unconstitutional proceedings of the King--Designs of\r\n  the Prince of Orange--Proceedings of King James--Landing of the\r\n  Prince of Orange--State of feeling in Scotland--Flight of the\r\n  King--The Duke of Gordon--Convention of Estates--Duke of Gordon\r\n  holds Edinburgh Castle--Viscount Dundee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the king’s arrival was received in Scotland with a\r\nburst of enthusiasm not quite in accordance with the national\r\ncharacter;[520] but the idea that the nation was about to regain its\r\nliberties made Scotsmen forget their wonted propriety. Preparatory to\r\nthe assembling of the Scottish parliament, which was summoned to meet\r\nat Edinburgh on the 1st of January, 1661, Middleton, who had lately\r\nbeen created an earl, was appointed his majesty’s commissioner; the\r\nEarl of Glencairn, chancellor; the Earl of Lauderdale, secretary of\r\nstate; the Earl of Rothes, president of the council; and the Earl of\r\nCrawford, lord-treasurer.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite apart from the object of this work to detail the\r\nmany unconstitutional acts passed by this “terrible parliament,” as\r\nit is well named by Kirkton; but the trial of the Marquis of Argyle\r\nmust not be overlooked. That nobleman had, on the restoration of\r\nthe king, gone to London to congratulate his majesty on his return;\r\nbut on his arrival he was immediately seized and committed to the\r\nTower. He petitioned the king for a personal interview, which was\r\nrefused, and, to get rid of his importunities, his majesty directed\r\nthat he should be sent back to Scotland for trial. Being brought to\r\ntrial, he applied for delay, till some witnesses at a distance should\r\nbe examined on commission; but this also was refused. He thereupon\r\nclaimed the benefit of the amnesty which the king had granted at\r\nStirling. This plea was sustained by desire of the king; but as\r\nthere were other charges against him, arising out of transactions\r\nsubsequent to the year 1651, to which year only the amnesty extended,\r\nthe trial was proceeded in. These charges were, that he had aided\r\nthe English in destroying the liberties of Scotland--that he had\r\naccepted a grant of £12,000 from Cromwell--that he had repeatedly\r\nused defamatory and traitorous language in speaking of the royal\r\nfamily--and, lastly, that he had voted for a bill abjuring the right\r\nof the royal family to the crowns of the three kingdoms, which had\r\nbeen passed in the parliament of Richard Cromwell, in which he sat.\r\nArgyle denied that he had ever given any countenance or assistance\r\nto the English in their invasion of Scotland; but he admitted the\r\ngrant from Cromwell, which he stated was given, not in lieu of\r\nservices, but as a compensation for losses sustained by him. He,\r\nmoreover, denied that he had ever used the words attributed to him\r\nrespecting the royal family; and with regard to the charge of sitting\r\nin Richard Cromwell’s parliament, he stated that he had taken his\r\nseat to protect his country from oppression, and to be ready, should\r\noccasion offer, to support by his vote the restoration of the king.\r\nThis defence staggered the parliament, and judgment was postponed.\r\nIn the meantime Glencairn and Rothes hastened to London, to lay\r\nthe matter before the king, and to urge the necessity of Argyle’s\r\ncondemnation. Unfortunately for that nobleman, they had recovered\r\nsome letters which he had written to Monk and other English officers,\r\nin which were found some expressions very hostile to the king; but as\r\nthese letters have not been preserved, their precise contents are not\r\nknown. Argyle was again brought before parliament, and the letters\r\nread in his presence. He had no explanation to give, and his friends,\r\nvexed and dismayed, retired from the house and left him to his fate.\r\nHe was accordingly sentenced to death on the 25th of May, 1661, and,\r\nthat he might not have an opportunity of appealing to the clemency of\r\nthe king, he was ordered to be beheaded within forty-eight hours. He\r\nprepared for death with a fortitude not expected from the timidity\r\nof his nature; wrote a long letter to the king, vindicating his\r\nmemory, and imploring protection for his poor wife and family; on\r\nthe day of his execution, dined at noon with his friends with great\r\ncheerfulness, and was accompanied by several of the nobility to the\r\nscaffold, where he behaved with singular constancy and courage. After\r\ndinner he retired a short time for private prayer, and, on returning,\r\ntold his friends that “the Lord had sealed his charter, and said to\r\nhim, ‘Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven.’” When brought\r\nto the scaffold he addressed the people, protested his innocence,\r\ndeclared his adherence to the Covenant, reproved “the abounding\r\nwickedness of the land, and vindicated himself from the charge\r\nof being accessory to the death of Charles I.” With the greatest\r\nfortitude he laid his head upon the block, which was immediately\r\nsevered from his body by the maiden. This event took place upon\r\nMonday, the 27th of May, 1661, the marquis being then 65 years of\r\nage. By a singular destiny, the head of Argyle was fixed on the same\r\nspike which had borne that of his great rival Montrose.[521]\r\n\r\nArgyle was held in high estimation by his party, and, by whatever\r\nmotives he may have been actuated, it cannot but be admitted, that\r\nto his exertions Scotland is chiefly indebted for the successful\r\nstand which was made against the unconstitutional attempts of\r\nthe elder Charles upon the civil and religious liberties of his\r\nScottish subjects. He appears to have been naturally averse to\r\nphysical pain, deficient in personal courage, the possession of\r\nwhich, in the times in which Argyle lived, “covered a multitude of\r\nsins,” and the want of which was esteemed by some unpardonable. We\r\nbelieve that it is chiefly on this account that his character is\r\nrepresented by his enemies and the opponents of his principles in\r\nsuch an unfavourable light, contrasting as it does so strikingly with\r\nthat of his great opponent, the brave and chivalrous Montrose. That\r\nhe was an unprincipled hypocrite, we think it would be difficult\r\nto prove; genuine hypocrisy, in a man of his ability, would have\r\nprobably gained for its possessor a happier fate. That he was wary,\r\ncunning, reticent, and ambitious, there cannot be any doubt;--such\r\nqualities are almost indispensable to the politician, and were more\r\nthan ordinarily necessary in those times, especially, considering\r\nthe men Argyle had to deal with. We believe that he was actuated all\r\nalong by deep but narrow and gloomy religious principle, that he had\r\nthe welfare of his country sincerely at heart, and that he took the\r\nmeans he thought best calculated to maintain freedom, and, what he\r\nthought, true religion in the land. As he himself said in a letter to\r\nthe Earl of Strafford,[522] he thought “his duty to the king would be\r\nbest shown by maintaining the constitution of his country in church\r\nand state.” On the whole, he appears to have been a well-meaning,\r\nwrong-headed, narrow-minded, clever politician. Mr. Grainger, in his\r\n_Biographical History of England_, justly observes, “The Marquis of\r\nArgyle was in the cabinet what his enemy, the Marquis of Montrose,\r\nwas in the field, the first character of his age for political\r\ncourage and conduct.” Had he been tried by impartial judges, the\r\ncircumstances of the times would have been considered as affording\r\nsome extenuation for his conduct; but it was his misfortune to be\r\ntried by men who were his enemies, and who did not scruple to violate\r\nall the forms of justice to bring him to the block, in the hope of\r\nobtaining his vast possessions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Scottish “Maiden.”--Now in the Edinburgh\r\nAntiquarian Museum.[523]]\r\n\r\nThe execution of Argyle was not in accordance with the views of the\r\nking, who, to show his disapprobation of the death of the marquis,\r\nreceived Lord Lorn, his eldest son, with favour at court; from which\r\ncircumstance the enemies of the house of Argyle anticipated that they\r\nwould be disappointed in their expectations of sharing among them\r\nthe confiscated estates of the marquis. To impair, therefore, these\r\nestates was their next object. Argyle had obtained from the Scottish\r\nparliament a grant of the confiscated estate of the Marquis of\r\nHuntly, his brother-in-law, on the ground that he was a considerable\r\ncreditor, but as Huntly was indebted to other persons to the extent\r\nof 400,000 merks, the estate was burdened to that amount on passing\r\ninto Argyle’s possession. Middleton and his colleagues immediately\r\npassed an act, restoring Huntly’s estate free of incumbrance, leaving\r\nto Huntly’s creditors recourse upon the estates of Argyle for payment\r\nof their debts. Young Argyle was exasperated at this proceeding, and\r\nin a letter to Lord Duffus, his brother-in-law, expressed himself\r\nin very unguarded terms respecting the parliament. This letter was\r\nintercepted by Middleton, and on it the parliament grounded a charge\r\nof verbal sedition, or _leasing-making_, as the crime is known in\r\nthe statutory law of Scotland, an offence which was then capital.\r\nUpon this vague charge the young nobleman was brought to trial before\r\nthe parliament, and condemned to death. The enemies of the house of\r\nArgyle now supposed that the estates of the family were again within\r\ntheir grasp; but the king, at the intercession of Lauderdale, the\r\nrival of Middleton, pardoned Lorn, released him from prison after\r\nabout a year’s confinement, restored to him the family estates, and\r\nallowed him to retain the title of Earl.[524]\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of Glencairn’s short-lived insurrection, the\r\nHighlands appear to have enjoyed repose till the year 1674, when an\r\noutbreak took place which threatened to involve the greater part of\r\nthat country in the horrors of feudal war, the occasion of which was\r\nas follows. The Marquis of Argyle had purchased up some debts due\r\nby the laird of Maclean, for which his son, the earl, applied for\r\npayment; but the laird being unwilling or unable to pay, the earl\r\napprised his lands, and followed out other legal proceedings, to make\r\nthe claim effectual against Maclean’s estates. In the meantime the\r\nlatter died, leaving a son under the guardianship of his brother,\r\nto whom, on Maclean’s death, the earl renewed his application for\r\npayment. The tutor of Maclean stated his readiness to settle, either\r\nby appropriating as much of the rents of his ward’s lands in Mull\r\nand Tirey as would be sufficient to pay the interest of the debt, or\r\nby selling or conveying to him in security as much of the property\r\nas would be sufficient to pay off the debt itself; but he required,\r\nbefore entering into this arrangement, that the earl would restrict\r\nhis claim to what was justly due. The earl professed his readiness to\r\ncomply with the tutor’s offer; but the latter contrived to evade the\r\nmatter for a considerable time, and at length showed a disposition to\r\nresist the earl’s demand by force.\r\n\r\nThe earl, therefore, resolved to enforce compliance, and armed with a\r\ndecree of the Court of Session, and supported by a body of 2,000 of\r\nhis tenants and vassals, he crossed into Mull, in which, he landed\r\nat three different places without opposition, although the Macleans\r\nhad 700 or 800 men in the island. The Macleans had sent their cattle\r\ninto Mull for safety, a considerable number of which were killed or\r\nhoughed by Lord Neill, brother to the earl, at the head of a party of\r\nthe Campbells. The islanders at once submitted, and the earl having\r\nobtained possession of the castle of Duart, and placed a garrison\r\ntherein, left the island. Although the Macleans had promised to pay\r\ntheir rents to the earl, they refused when applied to the following\r\nyear, a refusal which induced him to prepare for a second invasion\r\nof Mull. In September, 1675, he had collected a force of about 1,500\r\nmen, including 100 of the king’s troops from Glasgow, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Crichton, and a similar number of militia-men,\r\nunder Andrew M’Farlane, the laird of M’Farlane, the use of which\r\ncorps had been granted to the earl on application to the Council. The\r\nMacleans, aware of their danger, had strengthened themselves by an\r\nalliance with Lord Macdonald and other chieftains, who sent a force\r\nof about 1,000 men to their aid; but Argyle’s forces never reached\r\nthe island, his ships having been driven back damaged and dismantled\r\nby a dreadful hurricane, which lasted two days.[525]\r\n\r\nThis misfortune, and intelligence which the earl received from the\r\ncommander of Duart castle that the Macleans were in great force in\r\nthe island, made him postpone his enterprise. With the exception\r\nof 500 men whom he retained for the protection of his coasts, and\r\nabout 300 or 400 to protect his lands against the incursions of the\r\nMacleans, he dismissed his forces, after giving them instructions\r\nto re-assemble on the 18th of October, unless countermanded before\r\nthat time. The earl then went to Edinburgh to crave additional aid\r\nfrom the government; but receiving no encouragement, he posted to\r\nLondon, where he expected, with the help of his friend the Duke of\r\nLauderdale, to obtain assistance. Lord Macdonald and the other\r\nfriends of the Macleans, hearing of Argyle’s departure, immediately\r\nfollowed him to London, and laid a statement of the dispute before\r\nthe king, who, in February, 1676, remitted the matter to three lords\r\nof the Privy Council of Scotland for judgment. The earl returned to\r\nEdinburgh in June following. A meeting of the parties took place\r\nbefore the lords to whom the matter had been referred, but they\r\ncame to no decision, and the subsequent fate of Argyle put an end\r\nto these differences, although it appears that he was allowed to\r\ntake possession of the island of Mull without resistance in the year\r\n1680.[526]\r\n\r\nExcept upon one occasion, now to be noticed, the Highlanders took\r\nno share in any of the public transactions in Scotland during the\r\nreigns of Charles the Second and his brother James. Isolated from the\r\nLowlands by a mountain barrier which prevented almost any intercourse\r\nbetween them and their southern neighbours, they happily kept free\r\nfrom the contagion of that religious fanaticism which spread over\r\nthe Lowlands of Scotland, in consequence of the unconstitutional\r\nattempts of the government to force episcopacy upon the people. Had\r\nthe Highlanders been imbued with the same spirit which actuated the\r\nScottish whigs, the government might have found it a difficult task\r\nto have suppressed them; but they did not concern themselves with\r\nthese theological disputes, and they did not hesitate when their\r\nchiefs, at the call of the government, required their services to\r\nmarch to the Lowlands to suppress the disturbances in the western\r\ncounties. Accordingly, an army of about 8,000 men, known in Scottish\r\nhistory by the name of the “Highland Host,” descended from the\r\nmountains under the command of their respective chiefs, and encamped\r\nat Stirling on the 24th of June, 1678, whence they spread themselves\r\nover Clydesdale, Renfrew, Cunningham, Kyle, and Carrick, and overawed\r\nthe whigs so effectually, that they did not attempt to oppose the\r\ngovernment during the stay of these hardy mountaineers among them.\r\nAccording to Wodrow and Kirkton, the Highlanders were guilty of great\r\noppression and cruelty, but they kept their hands free from blood,\r\nas it has been correctly stated that not one whig lost his life\r\nduring the invasion of these Highland crusaders.[527] After remaining\r\nabout eight months in the Lowlands, the Highlanders were sent home,\r\nthe government having no further occasion for their services, but\r\nbefore their departure they took care to carry along with them a\r\nlarge quantity of plunder they had collected during their stay.[528]\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Highlanders, the Covenanters again\r\nappeared upon the stage, and proceeded so far as even to murder some\r\nsoldiers who had been quartered on some landlords who had refused to\r\npay cess. The assassination of Archbishop Sharp, and the insurrection\r\nof the Covenanters under a preacher named Hamilton, followed by the\r\ndefeat of the celebrated Graham of Claverhouse at Drumclog on the\r\n1st of June, 1679, alarmed the government; but the defeat of the\r\nCovenanters by the king’s forces at Bothwell bridge, on the 22d\r\nof June, quieted their apprehensions. Fresh measures of severity\r\nwere adopted against the unfortunate whigs, who, driven to despair,\r\nagain flew to arms, encouraged by the exhortations of the celebrated\r\nRichard Cameron,--from whom the religious sect known by the name of\r\nCameronians takes its name,--and Donald Cargill, another enthusiast;\r\nbut they were defeated in an action at Airs-moss in Kyle, in which\r\nCameron, their ecclesiastical head, was killed.\r\n\r\nTo check the diffusion of anti-monarchical principles, which were\r\nspreading fast throughout the kingdom under the auspices of the\r\ndisciples of Cameron, the government, on the meeting of the Scottish\r\nparliament on the 28th of July, 1681, devised a test, which they\r\nrequired to be taken by all persons possessed of any civil, military,\r\nor ecclesiastical office. The parties taking this test were made to\r\ndeclare their adhesion to the true Protestant religion, as contained\r\nin the original confession of faith, ratified by parliament in the\r\nyear 1560, to recognise the supremacy of the king over all persons\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical, and to acknowledge that there “lay no\r\nobligation from the national covenant, or the solemn league and\r\ncovenant, or any other manner of way whatsoever, to endeavour any\r\nalteration in the government in church or state, as it was then\r\nestablished by the laws of the kingdom.”[529]\r\n\r\nThe terms of this test were far from satisfactory to some even of\r\nthe best friends of the government, as it was full of contradictions\r\nand absurdities, and it was not until the Privy Council issued\r\nan explanatory declaration that they could be prevailed upon to\r\ntake it. The Dukes of Hamilton and Monmouth, however, rather\r\nthan take the test, resigned their offices. Among others who had\r\ndistinguished themselves in opposing the passing of the test, was\r\nthe Earl of Argyle, who supported an amendment proposed by Lord\r\nBelhaven, for setting aside a clause excepting the Duke of York,\r\nbrother to the king, and the other princes of the blood, from its\r\noperation. The conduct of Argyle gave great offence to the duke, who\r\nsat as commissioner in the parliament, and encouraged his enemies\r\nto set about accomplishing his ruin. The Earl of Errol brought in\r\na bill reviving some old claims upon his estates, and the king’s\r\nadvocate endeavoured to deprive him of his hereditary offices;\r\nbut the Duke of York interposed, and prevented the adoption of\r\nthese intended measures. To gratify his enemies, however, and to\r\nshow the displeasure of the court at his recent opposition, Argyle\r\nwas deprived of his seat in the Court of Session. But this did\r\nnot sufficiently appease their resentment, and, anxious for an\r\nopportunity of gratifying their malice, they hoped that he would\r\nrefuse to take the test. Accordingly, he was required to subscribe\r\nit: he hesitated, and craved time to deliberate. Aware of the\r\nplot which had been long hatching against him, and as he saw that\r\nif he refused he would be deprived of his important hereditary\r\njurisdictions, he resolved to take the test, with a declaratory\r\nexplanation, which, it is understood, received the approbation\r\nof the Duke of York, to whom the earl had submitted it. The earl\r\nthen subscribed the test in presence of the council, and added the\r\nfollowing explanation:--“I have considered the test, and am very\r\ndesirous of giving obedience as far as I can. I am confident that the\r\nparliament never intended to impose contradictory oaths: Therefore I\r\nthink no man can explain it but for himself. Accordingly, I take it\r\nso far as it is consistent with itself and the Protestant religion.\r\nAnd I do declare, that I mean not to bind myself, in my station, in\r\na lawful way, from wishing and endeavouring any alteration which I\r\nthink to the advantage of Church or State, and not repugnant to the\r\nProtestant religion and my loyalty. And this I understand as a part\r\nof my oath.” This declaration did not please the council, but as the\r\nDuke appeared to be satisfied, the matter was passed over, and Argyle\r\nkept his seat at the council board.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duke of York had been heard to declare that no honest\r\nman could take the test,--a declaration which fully justified the\r\ncourse Argyle had pursued,--yet the enemies of that nobleman wrought\r\nso far upon the mind of his royal highness as to induce him to think\r\nthat Argyle’s declaration was a highly criminal act. The earl,\r\ntherefore, was required to take the test a second time, without\r\nexplanation; and having refused, he was committed a prisoner to the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh, and on the slight foundation of a declaration\r\nwhich had been sanctioned by the next heir to the crown, was raised a\r\nhideous superstructure of high treason, leasing-making, and perjury.\r\n\r\nArgyle was brought to trial on Monday, the 12th of December, 1681,\r\nbefore the High Court of Justiciary. The Earl of Queensberry, the\r\njustice-general, and four other judges, sat upon the bench, and\r\nfifteen noblemen acted as jurors. The absurdity of the charges,\r\nand the iniquity of the attempt to deprive a nobleman, who had,\r\neven in the worst times, shown an attachment to the royal family,\r\nof his fortune, his honours, and his life, were ably exposed by\r\nthe counsel for the earl; but so lost was a majority of the judges\r\nto every sense of justice, that, regardless of the infamy which\r\nwould for ever attach to them, they found the libel relevant; and\r\non the following day the assize or jury, of which the Marquis of\r\nMontrose, cousin-german to Argyle, was chancellor, found him guilty.\r\nIntelligence of Argyle’s condemnation was immediately sent to the\r\nking, but the messenger was anticipated in his arrival by an express\r\nfrom the earl himself to the king, who, although he gave orders that\r\nsentence should be passed against Argyle, sent positive injunctions\r\nto delay the execution till his pleasure should be known. Argyle,\r\nhowever, did not wish to trust to the royal clemency, and as he\r\nunderstood preparations were making for his execution, he made his\r\nescape from the castle of Edinburgh, disguised as a page carrying the\r\ntrain of Lady Sophia Lindsay, his step-daughter, daughter of Lord\r\nBalcarres, whose widow Argyle married.[530] He went to London, where\r\nhe lay some time in concealment, whence he went over to Holland. On\r\nthe day of his escape, being the 21st of December, he was proclaimed\r\na fugitive at the market cross of Edinburgh, and, on the 24th, the\r\nCourt of Justiciary passed sentence of death against him, ordered his\r\narms to be reversed and torn at the market cross of Edinburgh, and\r\ndeclared his titles and estates forfeited.\r\n\r\nIn exculpation of their infamous proceedings, the persecutors\r\nof Argyle pretended that their only object in resorting to such\r\nunjustifiable measures, was to force him to surrender his extensive\r\nhereditary jurisdictions, which, they considered, gave him too great\r\nauthority in the Highlands, and the exercise of which in his family,\r\nmight obstruct the ends of justice; and that they had no designs\r\neither upon his life or fortune. But this is an excuse which cannot\r\nbe admitted, for they had influence enough with the Crown to have\r\ndeprived Argyle of these hereditary jurisdictions, without having\r\nrecourse to measures so glaringly subversive of justice.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage taken by the king of Argyle’s forfeiture was the\r\nretention of the heritable jurisdictions, which were parcelled out\r\namong the friends of the court during pleasure. Lord Lorn, the earl’s\r\nson, had the forfeited estates restored to him, after provision had\r\nbeen made for satisfying the demands of his father’s creditors.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of Charles II., a number of persons from\r\nEngland and Scotland had taken refuge in Holland, to escape state\r\nprosecutions with which they were threatened. Among the Scottish\r\nexiles, besides Argyle, were Sir James Dalrymple, afterwards Earl\r\nof Stair, the celebrated Fletcher of Salton, and Sir Patrick Hume\r\nof Polwarth,--all of whom, as martyrs of liberty, longed for an\r\nopportunity of vindicating its cause in the face of their country.\r\nThe accession of James II, in 1685, to the crown of his brother,\r\nseemed an event favourable to their plans, and at a meeting which\r\nsome of the exiled leaders held at Rotterdam, they resolved to raise\r\nthe standard of revolt in England and Scotland, and invited the\r\nDuke of Monmouth, also an exile, and the Earl of Argyle, to join\r\nthem.[531] Monmouth, who was then living in retirement at Brussels,\r\nspending his time in illicit amours, accepted the invitation, and\r\nhaving repaired to Rotterdam, offered either to attempt a descent on\r\nEngland, at the head of the English exiles, or to go to Scotland as a\r\nvolunteer, under Argyle.[532] The latter, who had never ceased since\r\nhis flight to keep up a correspondence with his friends in Scotland,\r\nhad already been making preparations, and by means of a large sum\r\nof money he had received from a rich widow of Amsterdam, had there\r\npurchased a ship and arms, and ammunition. He now also repaired to\r\nRotterdam, where it was finally arranged that two expeditions should\r\nbe fitted out,--one for England, under Monmouth, and the other for\r\nScotland, under the command of Argyle, who was appointed by the\r\ncouncil at Rotterdam captain-general of the army, “with as full power\r\nas was usually given to generals by the free states in Europe.”[533]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May, 1685, the expedition under Argyle, which consisted\r\nof three ships and about 300 men, left the shores of Holland, and\r\nreached Cairston in the Orkneys on the 6th, after a pleasant voyage.\r\nThe seizure, by the natives, of Spence, the earl’s secretary, and of\r\nBlackadder, his surgeon, both of whom had incautiously ventured on\r\nshore, afforded the government the necessary information as to the\r\nstrength and destination of the expedition. A proclamation had been\r\nissued, on the 28th of April, for putting the kingdom in a posture\r\nof defence, hostages had been taken from the vassals of Argyle as\r\nsureties for their fidelity, and all persons whose loyalty was\r\nsuspected were either imprisoned or had to find security for their\r\nfidelity to the government; but as soon as the council at Edinburgh\r\nreceived the intelligence of Argyle’s having reached the Orkneys,\r\nthey despatched troops to the west, and ordered several frigates\r\nto cruise among the Western Isles. After taking four Orcadians as\r\nhostages for the lives of his secretary and surgeon, Argyle left\r\nthe Orkneys on the 7th of May, and arrived at Tobermory in the isle\r\nof Mull on the 11th, whence he sailed to the mainland, and landed\r\nin Kintyre. Here he published a declaration which had been drawn up\r\nin Holland by Sir James Stuart, afterwards king’s advocate, full of\r\ninvective against the government, and attributing all the grievances\r\nunder which the country had laboured in the preceding reign to a\r\nconspiracy between popery and tyranny, which had, he observed, been\r\nevidently disclosed by the cutting off of the late king and the\r\nascension of the Duke of York to the throne. It declared that the\r\nobject of the invaders was to restore the true Protestant religion,\r\nand that as the Duke of York was, from his religion, as they\r\nsupposed, incapable of giving security on that head, they declared\r\nthat they would never enter into any treaty with him. The earl\r\nissued, a few days thereafter, a second declaration, from Tarbet,\r\nreciting his own wrongs, and calling upon his former vassals to join\r\nhis standard. Messengers were despatched in all directions, bearing\r\naloft the fiery cross, and in a short time about 800 of his clan,\r\nheaded by Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck, rallied around their\r\nchief. Other reinforcements arrived, which increased his army to\r\n2,500 men; a force wholly insufficient to meet a body of about 7,000\r\nmilitia and a considerable number of regular troops already assembled\r\nin the west to oppose his advance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Argyle’s obvious plan was at once to have dashed into\r\nthe western Lowlands, where the spirit of disaffection was deeply\r\nprevalent, and where a great accession of force might have been\r\nexpected, he, contrary to the advice of some of his officers,\r\nremained in Argyle a considerable time in expectation of hearing of\r\nMonmouth’s landing, and spent the precious moments in chasing out of\r\nhis territories a few stragglers who infested his borders. Amid the\r\ndissensions which naturally arose from this difference of opinion,\r\nthe royalists were hemming Argyle in on all sides. Whilst the Duke\r\nof Gordon was advancing upon his rear with the northern forces, and\r\nthe Earl of Dumbarton with the regular troops pressing him in front,\r\nthe Marquis of Athole and Lord Charles Murray, at the head of 1,500\r\nmen, kept hanging on his right wing, and a fleet watched his ships\r\nto prevent his escape by sea. In this conjuncture Argyle yielded to\r\nthe opinion of his officers, and, leaving his stores in the castle of\r\nAllangreg, in charge of a garrison of 150 men, he began his march, on\r\nthe 10th of June, to the Lowlands, and gave orders that his vessels\r\nshould follow close along the coast. The commander of the castle,\r\non the approach of the king’s ships under Sir Thomas Hamilton,\r\nabandoned it five days thereafter, without firing a single shot, and\r\nthe warlike stores which it contained, consisting of 5,000 stand\r\nof arms and 300 barrels of powder, besides a standard bearing the\r\ninscription “Against Popery, Prelacy, and Erastianism,” fell a prey\r\nto the royalists. The vessels also belonging to Argyle were taken at\r\nthe same time.[534]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June Argyle crossed the Leven near Dumbarton, but\r\nfinding it impracticable, from the numerous forces opposed to him,\r\nand which met him at every point, to proceed on his intended route\r\nto Glasgow by the ordinary road, he betook himself to the hills,\r\nin the expectation of eluding his foes during the darkness of the\r\nnight; but this desperate expedient did not succeed, and next morning\r\nArgyle found his force diminished by desertion to 500 men. Thus\r\nabandoned by the greater part of his men, he, in his turn, deserted\r\nthose who remained with him, and endeavoured to secure his own\r\nsafety. Disguised in a common dress he wandered for some time in\r\nthe company of Major Fullarton in the vicinity of Dumbarton, and on\r\nthe opposite side of the Clyde, but was at last taken prisoner by a\r\nfew militiamen in attempting to reach his own country.[535] About\r\n100 of the volunteers from Holland crossed the Clyde in boats, but\r\nbeing attacked by the royalists were dispersed. Thus ended this ill\r\nconcerted and unfortunate expedition.[536]\r\n\r\nArgyle was carried to Glasgow, and thence to Edinburgh, where he\r\nunderwent the same ignominious and brutal treatment which the brave\r\nMontrose had suffered on being brought to the capital after his\r\ncapture. As the judgment which had been pronounced against Argyle,\r\nafter his escape from the castle of Edinburgh, was still in force, no\r\ntrial was considered necessary. He was beheaded accordingly on the\r\n26th of June, evincing in his last moments the fortitude of a Roman,\r\nand the faith of a martyr. “When this nobleman’s death,” observes Sir\r\nWalter Scott, “is considered as the consequence of a sentence passed\r\nagainst him for presuming to comment upon and explain an oath which\r\nwas self-contradictory, it can only be termed a judicial murder.” His\r\ntwo sons, Lord Lorn and Lord Neill Campbell, were banished. Monmouth,\r\nwho did not land in England till the 11th of June, was equally\r\nunfortunate, and suffered the death of a traitor on Tower Hill on the\r\n15th of July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ninth Earl of Argyle.]\r\n\r\nThe ill-fated result of Argyle’s expedition, and the suppression\r\nof Monmouth’s rebellion, enabled James to turn the whole of his\r\nattention to the accomplishment of an object more valuable, in his\r\nopinion, than the crown itself--the restoration of the Catholic\r\nreligion. In furtherance of this design, the king adopted a series\r\nof the most unconstitutional and impolitic measures, which destroyed\r\nthe popularity he had acquired on his accession, and finally ended\r\nin his expulsion from the throne.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till the Scottish parliament, which met on the\r\n28th of April, 1686, and on the obsequiousness of which the king\r\nhad placed great reliance, had refused to repeal the test, that he\r\nresolved upon those desperate measures which proved so fatal to him.\r\nThis parliament was prorogued by order of the king on the 15th of\r\nJune, and in a few months thereafter, he addressed a succession of\r\nletters to the council,--from which he had previously removed some\r\nindividuals who were opposed to his plans,--in which he stated,\r\nthat in requiring the parliament to repeal the penal statutes, he\r\nmerely meant to give them an opportunity of evincing their loyalty,\r\nas he considered that he had sufficient power, by virtue of his\r\nprerogative, to suspend or dispense with those laws; a most erroneous\r\nand dangerous doctrine certainly, but which could never be said to\r\nhave been exploded till the era of the revolution. In these letters\r\nthe king ordered the council to allow the Catholics to exercise their\r\nworship freely in private, to extend the protection of government\r\nto his Protestant as well as Catholic subjects, to receive the\r\nconformist clergy in general to livings in the church, and to admit\r\ncertain individuals whom he named to offices in the state without\r\nrequiring any of them to take the test.[537]\r\n\r\nBut these letters, though disapproved of in part by the council, were\r\nmerely preparatory to much more important steps, viz., the issuing\r\nof two successive proclamations by the king on the 12th of February\r\nand the 5th of July in the following year, granting full and free\r\ntoleration to Presbyterians, Catholics, and Quakers, with liberty\r\nto exercise their worship in houses and chapels. He also suspended\r\nthe severe penal statutes against the Catholics, which had been\r\npassed during the minority of his grandfather; but he declared his\r\nresolution to preserve inviolate the rights and privileges of the\r\nthen established (Episcopal) church of Scotland, and to protect the\r\nholders of church property in their possessions.\r\n\r\nBy the Presbyterians who had for so many years writhed under the\r\nlash of persecution, these proclamations were received with great\r\nsatisfaction; and at a meeting which was held at Edinburgh of the\r\nPresbyterian ministers, who had assembled from all parts of the\r\ncountry to consider the matter, a great majority not only accepted\r\nthe boon with cheerfulness, but voted a loyal address to his majesty,\r\nthanking him for the indulgence he had granted them. Some there were,\r\nhowever, of the more rigorous kind, who denounced any communication\r\nwith the king, whom they declared “an apostate, bigoted,\r\nexcommunicated papist, under the malediction of the Mediator; yea,\r\nheir to the imprecation of his grandfather,” and who found warm\r\nabettors in the clergy of the Episcopal church in Scotland, who\r\ndisplayed their anger even in their discourses from the pulpit.[538]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Presbyterians reaped great advantages from the\r\ntoleration which the king had granted, by being allowed the free and\r\nundisturbed exercise of their worship, and by being, many of them,\r\nadmitted into offices of the state, yet they perceived that a much\r\ngreater proportion of Catholics was admitted to similar employments.\r\nThus they began to grow suspicious of the king’s intentions, and,\r\ninstead of continuing their gratitude, they openly declared that\r\nthey did not any longer consider themselves under any obligation\r\nto his majesty, as the toleration had been granted for the purpose\r\nof introducing Catholics into places of trust, and of dividing\r\nProtestants among themselves. These apprehensions were encouraged\r\nby the Episcopal party, who, alarmed at the violent proceedings\r\nof the king against the English universities, and the bishops who\r\nhad refused to read his proclamation for liberty of conscience in\r\nthe churches, endeavoured to instil the same dread of popery and\r\narbitrary power into the minds of their Presbyterian countrymen which\r\nthey themselves entertained. By these and similar means discontent\r\nspread rapidly among the people of Scotland, who considered their\r\ncivil and religious liberties in imminent danger, and were,\r\ntherefore, ready to join in any measure which might be proposed for\r\ntheir protection.\r\n\r\nWilliam, Prince of Orange, who had married the Princess Mary, the\r\neldest daughter of James, next in succession to the Crown, watched\r\nthe progress of this struggle between arbitrary power and popular\r\nrights with extreme anxiety. He had incurred the displeasure of his\r\nfather-in-law, while Duke of York, by joining the party whose object\r\nit was to exclude James from the throne, by the reception which\r\nhe gave the Duke of Monmouth in Holland, and by his connivance,\r\napparent at least, at the attempts of the latter and the Earl of\r\nArgyle. But, upon the defeat of Monmouth, William, by offering\r\nhis congratulations on that event, reinstated himself in the good\r\ngraces of his father-in-law. As James, however, could not reconcile\r\nthe protection which the prince afforded to the numerous exiles\r\nfrom England and Scotland who had taken refuge in Holland, with\r\nthe prince’s professions of friendship, he demanded their removal;\r\nbut this was refused, through the influence of the prince with the\r\nStates, and though, upon a hint being given that a war might ensue in\r\nconsequence of this refusal, they were removed from the Hague, yet\r\nthey still continued to reside in other parts of Holland, and kept\r\nup a regular communication with the Prince. Another demand made by\r\nthe king to dismiss the officers of the British regiments serving\r\nin Holland, whose fidelity was suspected, met with the same evasive\r\ncompliance; for although William displaced those officers, he refused\r\ncommissions to all persons whom he suspected of attachment to the\r\nking or the Catholic faith. The wise policy of this proceeding was\r\nexemplified in the subsequent conduct of the regiments which declared\r\nthemselves in favour of the prince’s pretensions.[539]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1687, William perceived that matters were\r\napproaching to a crisis in England, but he did not think that the\r\ntime had then arrived for putting his intended design of invasion\r\ninto execution. To sound the dispositions of the people, he sent\r\nover in February, that year, Dyckvelt, an acute statesman, who kept\r\nup a secret communication with those who favoured the designs of his\r\nmaster. Dyckvelt soon returned to Holland, with letters from several\r\nof the nobility addressed to the prince, all couched in favourable\r\nterms, which encouraged him to send Zuleistein, another agent, into\r\nEngland to assure his friends there that if James attempted, with the\r\naid “of a packed parliament,” to repeal the penal laws and the test\r\nact, he would oppose him with an armed force.[540]\r\n\r\nAlthough the king was aware of the prince’s intrigues, he could\r\nnever be persuaded that the latter had any intention to dispossess\r\nhim of his crown, and continued to pursue the desperate course he\r\nhad resolved upon, with a pertinacity and zeal which blinded him to\r\nthe dangers which surrounded him. The preparations of the prince for\r\na descent on England went on in the meantime with activity; but a\r\ntemporary damp was cast on his hopes by reports of the pregnancy of\r\nthe queen, an event which, if a son was the result, might prevent the\r\naccession of his wife, the Princess Mary. On the 10th of June, 1688,\r\nthe queen gave birth to a prince, afterwards known as the Pretender.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the month of September, when James was on the verge\r\nof the precipice, that he saw the danger of his situation. He\r\nnow began, when too late, to attempt to repair the errors of his\r\nreign, by a variety of popular concessions; but although these were\r\ngranted with apparent cheerfulness, and accepted with indications\r\nof thankfulness, it was evident that they were forced from the king\r\nby the necessity of his situation, and might be withdrawn when that\r\nnecessity ceased to exist, an idea which appears to have prevailed\r\namong the people.\r\n\r\nBeing now convinced that the Prince of Orange contemplated an\r\ninvasion of England, James began to make the necessary preparations\r\nfor defence. In September, 1688, he sent down an express to Scotland\r\nto the members of the Privy Council, acquainting them with the\r\nprince’s preparations, and requiring them to place that part of his\r\ndominions on the war establishment. The militia was accordingly\r\nembodied, the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, &c. provisioned, and\r\norders were sent to the chiefs of the Highland clans to be ready\r\nto assemble their men on a short notice. Many persons at first\r\ndiscredited the report of an invasion from Holland, and considered\r\nthat it was a mere device of the king either to raise money or to\r\ncollect an army for some sinister purpose; but their suspicions were\r\nallayed by intelligence being brought by some seamen from Holland\r\nof the warlike preparations which were making in the Dutch ports.\r\nThe jealousies which were entertained of the king’s intentions were\r\ndissipated by the dread of a foreign invasion, and addresses were\r\nsent in to the Privy Council from the different towns, and from the\r\ncountry gentlemen, with offers of service.[541]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Privy Council were engaged in fulfilling the king’s\r\ninstructions, they received an order from his majesty to concentrate\r\nthe regular army, and despatch it without delay into England. This\r\nforce, which did not exceed 3,000 men, was in a state of excellent\r\ndiscipline, and was so advantageously posted throughout the kingdom\r\nthat any insurrection which might break out could be easily\r\nsuppressed. As the Prince of Orange had many adherents in Scotland,\r\nand as the spirit of disaffection to the existing government in the\r\nwestern counties, though subdued, had not been extinguished, the\r\nPrivy Council considered that to send the army out of the kingdom\r\nunder such circumstances would be a most imprudent step; and they,\r\ntherefore, sent an express to the king, representing the danger of\r\nsuch a movement, of which the disaffected would not fail to avail\r\nthemselves, should an opportunity occur. They proposed that the army\r\nshould remain as it was then stationed, and that, in lieu thereof, a\r\nbody of militia and a detachment of Highlanders, amounting together\r\nto 13,000 men, should be despatched to the borders, or marched into\r\nthe north of England, to watch the movements of the king’s enemies in\r\nthat quarter, and to suppress any risings which they might attempt\r\nin favour of the prince. But, although the Council were unanimous in\r\ngiving this advice, the king disregarded it altogether, reiterated\r\nthe order he had formerly given, and intimated, that if any of them\r\nwere afraid to remain in Scotland, they might accompany the army into\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Scottish army began its march early in October,\r\nin two divisions. The first, consisting of the foot, at the head of\r\nwhich was General Douglas, brother of the Duke of Queensberry, who\r\nhad the chief command of the army, took the road to Chester; and the\r\nsecond, consisting of the horse, under the direction of Graham of\r\nClaverhouse, as major-general, marched by York. These detachments, on\r\ntheir arrival at London, joined the English army under the command of\r\nthe Earl of Feversham, about the end of October.\r\n\r\nTo supply the absence of the regular troops, and to prevent the\r\ndisaffected from making the capital the focus of insurrection,\r\na large body of militia, under the command of Sir George Munro,\r\nwas quartered in Edinburgh and the suburbs; but no sooner had the\r\narmy passed the borders, than crowds from all parts of the kingdom\r\ncongregated, as if by mutual consent, in the metropolis, where they\r\nheld private meetings, which were attended by the Earls of Glencairn,\r\nCrawford, Dundonald, and others. The objects of these meetings were\r\nmade known to the council by spies, who were employed to attend them;\r\nand although they were clearly treasonable, the council had not\r\nthe courage to arrest a single individual. Among other things, the\r\nleaders of these meetings resolved to intercept all correspondence\r\nbetween the king and the council, a task which Sir James Montgomery\r\nundertook to see accomplished, and which he did so effectually that\r\nvery few despatches reached their destination.[542]\r\n\r\nFor several weeks the Privy Council, owing to this interruption, was\r\nkept in a state of painful uncertainty as to the state of the king’s\r\naffairs in England; but at last an express arrived from the Earl of\r\nMelfort, announcing the important intelligence that the Prince of\r\nOrange had landed in England with a considerable force, and that his\r\nmajesty had gone to meet him at the head of his army.\r\n\r\nThe landing of the prince, which was effected without opposition\r\non the 5th of November 1688, at Torbay in Devonshire, excited\r\nthe greatest alarm in the mind of the king, who had entertained\r\nhopes that a well appointed fleet of thirty-seven men-of-war, and\r\nseventeen fire-ships which had been stationed off the Gun-fleet\r\nunder the Earl of Dartmouth, an old and experienced commander, would\r\nhave intercepted the prince in his voyage. Unfortunately, however,\r\nfor the king, the cruisers which the admiral had sent out to watch\r\nthe approach of the enemy had been driven back by the violence of\r\nthe wind, and when the fleet of the prince passed the Downs towards\r\nits destined place of disembarkation, the royal fleet was riding at\r\nanchor abreast of the Long-sand, several miles to leeward, with the\r\nyards and topmasts struck; and as twenty-four hours elapsed before\r\nit could be got ready to commence the pursuit, the commander, on the\r\nrepresentation of his officers, desisted from the attempt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the king had recovered from the panic into which the news\r\nof the prince’s arrival had thrown him, he ordered twenty battalions\r\nof infantry and thirty squadrons of cavalry to march towards\r\nSalisbury and Marlborough, leaving six squadrons and six battalions\r\nbehind to preserve tranquillity in the capital.[543] The prince, who\r\nhad been led to expect that he would be received with open arms by\r\nall classes on his arrival, met at first with a very cold reception,\r\nand he felt so disappointed that he even threatened to re-embark his\r\narmy. Had James therefore adopted the advice given him by the King of\r\nFrance, to push forward his troops immediately in person and attack\r\nthe invader before the spirit of disaffection should spread, he\r\nmight, perhaps, by one stroke, have for ever annihilated the hopes of\r\nhis son-in-law and preserved his crown; but James thought and acted\r\ndifferently, and he soon had cause to repent bitterly of the course\r\nhe pursued. Owing to the open defection of some of his officers and\r\nthe secret machinations of others, the king soon found, that with the\r\nexception perhaps of the Scottish regiments, he could no longer rely\r\nupon the fidelity of his army. On the 20th of November he arrived at\r\nSalisbury, and reviewed a division of the army stationed there; and\r\nintended to inspect the following day, another division which lay at\r\nWarminster; but being informed that General Kirk, its commander,\r\nLord Churchill and others, had entered into a conspiracy to seize him\r\nand carry him a prisoner to the enemy’s camp, he summoned a council\r\nof war, at which these officers were present, and without making\r\nthem aware that he was in the knowledge of such a plot, proposed a\r\nretreat beyond the Thames. This proposition met with keen opposition\r\nfrom Churchill, but was supported by the Earl of Feversham, his\r\nbrother the Count de Roye, and the Earl of Dumbarton, who commanded\r\none of the Scottish foot regiments. The proposal having been adopted,\r\nChurchill and some other officers went over to the prince during the\r\nnight.[544]\r\n\r\nThe army accordingly retired behind the Thames, and the king, without\r\nleaving any particular instructions to his officers, proceeded to\r\nLondon, to attend a council of peers which he had summoned to meet\r\nhim at Whitehall. The departure of the king was a subject of deep\r\nregret to his real friends in the army, and particularly to the Earl\r\nof Dumbarton, and Lord Dundee, who had offered to engage the enemy\r\nwith the Scots troops alone. This offer his majesty thought proper to\r\ndecline, and in a conference which Dundee and the Earl of Balcarras\r\nafterwards had with him in London, when he had made up his mind to\r\nretire to France, he gave them to understand that he meant to intrust\r\nthe latter with the administration of his civil affairs in Scotland,\r\nand to appoint the former the generalissimo of his forces.\r\n\r\nIn the Scottish Privy Council there were several persons who\r\nwere inimical to the king, and who only waited for a favourable\r\nopportunity of offering their allegiance and services to the Prince\r\nof Orange. These were the Marquis of Athole, the Viscount Tarbet,\r\nand Sir John Dalrymple, the Lord-president of the Court of Session.\r\nThe two latter, in conjunction with Balcarras, had been appointed\r\nby the council to proceed to England, to obtain personally from\r\nthe king the necessary instructions how to act on the landing of\r\nthe prince; but on some slight pretext they declined the journey,\r\nand Balcarras, a nobleman of undoubted loyalty, was obliged to go\r\nalone, and had the meeting with his majesty to which allusion has\r\nbeen made. These counsellors were duly apprised of the advance of\r\nthe prince, the defection of some of the king’s officers, and of his\r\nreturn to London; but as the result of the struggle seemed still\r\nto be dubious, they abstained from openly declaring themselves. In\r\norder, however, to get rid of the chancellor, the Earl of Perth, and\r\nget the government into their own hands, as preliminary to their\r\ndesigns, Viscount Tarbet proposed that, with the exception of four\r\ncompanies of foot and two troops of horse to collect the revenue,\r\nthe remainder of the troops should be disbanded, as he considered\r\nit quite unnecessary to keep up such a force in time of peace, the\r\nPrince of Orange having stated in a declaration which he had issued,\r\nthat that was one of the grievances complained of by the nation.\r\nThe chancellor, not foreseeing the consequences, assented to the\r\nproposal, and he had the mortification, after the order for dismissal\r\nhad been given, to receive an intimation from the Marquis of Athole\r\nand his party, who waited personally upon him at his lodgings, that\r\nas they considered it dangerous to act with him and other Catholic\r\ncounsellors who were incapacitated by law, they meant to take the\r\ngovernment into their own hands in behalf of the king, and they\r\ndemanded that he and his party should retire from the administration\r\nof affairs. The Duke of Gordon and the other Catholic members of the\r\ncouncil, on hearing of this proceeding, assembled in the chancellor’s\r\nhouse to consult with him as to the nature of the answer which\r\nshould be given to this extraordinary demand. As they saw resistance\r\nhopeless, they advised the chancellor to submit, and, probably to\r\navoid personal danger, he retired immediately to the country.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Athole called a meeting of the council, and proposed\r\nan address of congratulation to the Prince of Orange, strongly\r\nexpressive of gratitude to him for his generous undertaking to\r\nrelieve them from popery and arbitrary power, and offering a tender\r\nof their services; but this address was warmly opposed by the two\r\narchbishops, Sir John Dalrymple, Sir George Mackenzie and others,\r\nand was finally negatived. They even opposed the voting of any\r\naddress under existing circumstances, but the marquis and his party\r\nsucceeded in carrying a short address, drawn up in general terms.\r\nLord Glammis was sent up with it, but it was so different from what\r\nthe Prince expected, that it met with a very cold reception.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the unfortunate monarch had by this time been decided.\r\nBefore his return to London a great defection had taken place among\r\nthe officers of the army, and he had at last the mortification to see\r\nhimself deserted by his son-in-law, Prince George of Denmark, and by\r\nhis daughter the Princess Anne, the wife of the Prince. “God help me!\r\nmy very children have forsaken me;” such was the exclamation uttered\r\nby the unhappy monarch, his countenance suffused with tears, when\r\nhe received the afflicting intelligence of the flight of Anne from\r\nWhitehall. When the king saw he could no longer resist the torrent of\r\npopular indignation, and that an imperious necessity required that\r\nhe should leave the kingdom, his first solicitude was to provide for\r\nthe safety of the queen and his son, whom he managed to get safely\r\nconveyed to France.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the king to quit the kingdom was hastened after a\r\nfruitless attempt at negotiation with the Prince of Orange, by the\r\nappearance of an infamous proclamation against Catholics, issued\r\nunder the signature of the prince, and which, though afterwards\r\ndisowned by him, was, at the time, believed to be genuine. Having,\r\ntherefore, made up his mind to follow the queen without delay, the\r\nking wrote a letter to the Earl of Feversham, the commander of\r\nthe forces, intimating his intention, and after thanking him and\r\nthe army for their loyalty, he informed them that he did not wish\r\nthem any longer to run the risk of resisting “a foreign army and a\r\npoisoned nation.” Shortly after midnight, having disguised himself\r\nas a country gentleman, he left the palace, and descending by the\r\nback stairs, entered into a hackney coach, which conveyed him to the\r\nhorse-ferry, whence he crossed the river, into which the king threw\r\nthe great seal. Having arrived at Emley ferry near Feversham by ten\r\no’clock, he embarked on board the custom-house hoy, but before she\r\ncould be got ready for sea the king was apprehended, and placed under\r\na strong guard.\r\n\r\nWhen the king’s arrest was first reported in London, the intelligence\r\nwas not believed; but all uncertainty on the subject was removed by\r\na communication from James himself in the shape of a letter, but\r\nwithout any address, which was put into the hands of Lord Mulgrave by\r\na stranger at the door of the council chamber at Whitehall. A body of\r\nabout thirty peers and bishops had, on the flight of the king, formed\r\nthemselves into a council, and had assumed the reins of government,\r\nand many of these, on this letter being read, were desirous of\r\ntaking no notice of it, lest they might, by so doing, displease\r\nthe prince. Lord Halifax, the chairman, who favoured the prince’s\r\ndesigns, attempted to quash the matter, by adjourning the meeting,\r\nbut Mulgrave prevailed on the members of the council to remain, and\r\nobtained an order to despatch the Earl of Feversham with 200 of the\r\nlife-guards to protect the person of the king.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Feversham the king resolved to remain in the\r\nkingdom, and to return to London, a resolution which he adopted at\r\nthe urgent entreaty of Lord Winchelsea, whom, on his apprehension,\r\nhe had appointed lord-lieutenant of Kent. James was not without\r\nhopes that the prince would still come to terms, and to ascertain\r\nhis sentiments he sent Feversham to Windsor to invite the prince to\r\na personal conference in the capital, and to inform him that St.\r\nJames’s palace would be ready for his reception. The arrival of the\r\nearl with such a proposal was exceedingly annoying to William and\r\nhis adherents, the former of whom, on the supposition that the king\r\nhad taken a final adieu of the kingdom, had begun to act the part\r\nof the sovereign, while the latter were already intriguing for the\r\ngreat offices of the state. Instead of returning an answer to the\r\nking’s message, William, on the pretence that Feversham had disbanded\r\nthe army without orders, and had come to Windsor without a passport,\r\nordered him to be arrested, and committed a prisoner to the round\r\ntower, an order which was promptly obeyed.\r\n\r\nAt Rochester, whence he had despatched Feversham, the king was met\r\nby his guards, and thence proceeded to London, which he entered on\r\nthe 16th of December amidst the acclamations of the citizens, and\r\nthe ringing of bells, and other popular manifestations of joy, a\r\nremarkable proof of the instability and inconstancy of feeling which\r\nactuate masses of people under excitement.\r\n\r\nAs James conceived that the only chance he now had of securing the\r\nconfidence of his subjects and preserving his crown, consisted in\r\ngiving some signal proof of his sincerity to act constitutionally,\r\nhe made the humiliating offer to Lewis and Stamps, two of the city\r\naldermen, to deliver himself up into their hands on receiving an\r\nassurance that the civil authorities would guarantee his personal\r\nsafety, and to remain in custody till parliament should pass such\r\nmeasures as might be considered necessary for securing the religion\r\nand liberties of the nation. But Sir Robert Clayton dissuaded the\r\ncommon council from entering into any engagement which the city might\r\npossibly be unable to fulfil, and thus a negotiation was dropt,\r\nwhich, if successful, might have placed William in a situation of\r\ngreat embarrassment.[545]\r\n\r\nBut although James did not succeed in his offer to the city, his\r\nreturn to Whitehall had changed the aspect of affairs, and had placed\r\nWilliam in a dilemma from which he could only extricate himself by\r\nwithdrawing altogether his pretensions to the crown, or by driving\r\nhis uncle out of it by force. William considered that the most safe\r\nand prudent course he could pursue would be to force James to leave\r\nthe kingdom; but in such a manner as to induce the belief that he did\r\nso freely and of his own accord. Accordingly, to excite the king’s\r\nalarms, a body of Dutch guards, by order of the prince, marched\r\ninto Westminster, and, after taking possession of the palace of St.\r\nJames’s, marched with their matches lighted to Whitehall, of which\r\nthey also demanded possession. As resistance, owing to the great\r\ndisparity of numbers, was considered by the king to be unavailing,\r\nhe, contrary to the opinion of Lord Craven, the commander of his\r\nguards, who, though eighty years of age, offered to oppose the\r\ninvaders, ordered the guards to resign their posts, of which the\r\nDutch took possession. This event took place late on the evening of\r\nthe 16th of December.[546]\r\n\r\nThe king now received orders from William to quit Whitehall by ten\r\no’clock next morning, as the latter meant to enter London about\r\nnoon, and that he should retire to Ham, a house in Surrey belonging\r\nto the dowager duchess of Lauderdale, which had been provided\r\nfor his reception. The king objected to Ham as a residence being\r\nuncomfortable, but stated his willingness to return to Rochester.\r\nPermission being granted by the prince, James left Whitehall about\r\ntwelve o’clock noon, after taking an affectionate adieu of his\r\nfriends, many of whom burst into tears. He embarked on board the\r\nroyal barge, attended by Viscount Dundee and other noblemen, and\r\ndescended the river, surrounded by several boats filled with Dutch\r\nguards, in presence of an immense concourse of spectators, many of\r\nwhom witnessed with sorrow the humiliating spectacle.[547]\r\n\r\nThe king arrived at Rochester the following day from Gravesend,\r\nwhere he had passed the previous night. Having remained four days at\r\nRochester, he, accompanied by two captains in the navy, his natural\r\nson the Duke of Berwick, and a domestic, went on board the Eagle\r\nfireship, being unable to reach, on account of the unfavourable\r\nstate of the weather, a fishing smack which had been hired for his\r\nreception. On the following morning he went on board the smack,\r\nand after a boisterous voyage of two days, arrived at Ambleteuse,\r\nin France, on the 25th of December, and joined his wife and child,\r\nat the castle of St. Germain’s, on the 28th. Thus ingloriously and\r\nsadly ended the reign of the last of the unfortunate and seemingly\r\ninfatuated royal race of Stuarts.\r\n\r\nConsidering the crisis at which matters had arrived, the course which\r\nthe king pursued, of withdrawing from the kingdom, was evidently the\r\nmost prudent which could be adopted. All his trusty adherents in\r\nEngland were without power or influence, and in Scotland the Duke of\r\nGordon was the only nobleman who openly stood out for the interests\r\nof his sovereign. He had been created a duke by Charles II. James\r\nhad appointed him governor of the castle of Edinburgh, and he had\r\nbeen thereafter made a privy-counsellor and one of the lords of the\r\ntreasury. Though a firm and conscientious Catholic, he was always\r\nopposed to the violent measures of the court, as he was afraid that\r\nhowever well meant, they would turn out ruinous to the king; not\r\nindeed that he did not wish to see the professors of the same faith\r\nwith himself enjoy the same civil privileges as were enjoyed by his\r\nProtestant countrymen, but because he was opposed to the exercise of\r\nthe dispensing power at a time when the least favour shown to the\r\nprofessors of the proscribed faith was denounced as an attempt to\r\nintroduce popery. The king, influenced by some of his flatterers,\r\nreceived the duke coldly on his appearance at court in March, 1688,\r\nand curtailed some of his rights and privileges over the lands of\r\nsome of his vassals in Badenoch. Even his fidelity appeared to be\r\nquestioned, by various acts of interference with the affairs of the\r\ncastle, of which he disapproved. He resented these indignities by\r\ntendering his resignation of the various appointments he held from\r\nthe crown, and demanded permission from the king to retire beyond\r\nseas for a time; but James put a negative upon both proposals, and\r\nthe duke returned to his post at Edinburgh.[548]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the bad treatment he had received, the duke, true to\r\nhis trust, determined to preserve the castle of Edinburgh for the\r\nking, although the Prince of Orange should obtain possession of every\r\nother fortress in the kingdom. He requested the privy council to lay\r\nin a quantity of provisions and ammunition, but this demand was but\r\npartially attended to, for though the garrison consisted only of 120\r\nmen, there was not a sufficiency of materials for a three months’\r\nsiege. The duke shut himself up in the castle, and invited the Earl\r\nof Perth, the chancellor, to join him; but the earl declined the\r\noffer, and, in attempting to make his escape to the continent, was\r\nseized near the Bass, in the Frith of Forth, by some seamen from\r\nKirkcaldy, under a warrant from the magistrates of that burgh, and\r\ncommitted to Stirling castle, where he remained a close prisoner for\r\nnearly four years.[549] A few days after the duke had retired to the\r\ncastle, an attempt was made by some of the prince’s adherents to\r\ncorrupt the fidelity of the garrison, by circulating a false report\r\nthat the duke meant to make the whole garrison, who were chiefly\r\nProtestants, swear to maintain the Catholic religion. A mutiny was\r\non the eve of breaking out, but it was detected by the vigilance\r\nof some officers. The duke, thereupon, drew out the garrison,\r\nassured them that the report in question was wholly unfounded, and\r\ninformed them that all he required of them was to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the king, which was immediately done by the greater\r\npart of the garrison. Those who refused were at once dismissed. To\r\nsupply the deficiency thus made, the duke sent notice to Francis\r\nGordon of Midstrath to bring up from the north 45 of the best and\r\nmost resolute men he could find on his lands; but, on their arrival\r\nat Leith, a hue and cry was raised that the duke was bringing down\r\nPapists and Highlanders to overawe the Protestants. To calm the minds\r\nof the people, the duke ordered these men to return home.[550]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the arrival of the Prince of Orange in London,\r\nand the departure of the king, was received in Edinburgh, an immense\r\nconcourse of persons, “of all sorts, degrees, and persuasions,” who\r\n“could (says Balcarras) scrape so much together” to defray their\r\nexpenses, went up to London, influenced by motives of interest or\r\npatriotism. The Prince of Orange took the wise expedient of obtaining\r\nall the legal sanction which, before the assembling of a parliament,\r\ncould be given to his assumption of the administration of affairs\r\nin England; obtaining the concurrence of many of the spiritual and\r\ntemporal peers, and of a meeting composed of some members who had\r\nsat in the House of Commons during the reign of Charles II., as also\r\nof the Lord-Mayor of London, and 50 of the common council. He now\r\nadopted the same expedient as to Scotland, and taking advantage of\r\nthe great influx into the capital of noblemen and gentlemen from\r\nthat country, he convened them together. A meeting was accordingly\r\nheld at Whitehall, at which 30 noblemen and 80 gentlemen attended.\r\nThe Duke of Hamilton, who aimed at the chief direction of affairs in\r\nScotland, was chosen president. At this meeting a motion was made by\r\nthe duke that a convention of the estates should be called as early\r\nas possible, and that an address should be presented to the prince to\r\ntake upon him the direction of affairs in Scotland in the meantime;\r\nbut this motion was unexpectedly opposed by the Earl of Arran, the\r\nduke’s eldest son, who proposed that the king should be invited back\r\non condition that he should call a free parliament for securing the\r\ncivil and religious liberties of Scotland. This proposition threw\r\nthe assembly into confusion, and a short adjournment took place, but\r\non resuming their seats, the earl’s motion was warmly opposed by Sir\r\nPatrick Hume, and as none of the members offered to second it, the\r\nmotion was consequently lost, and the duke’s being put to the vote,\r\nwas carried.\r\n\r\nA convention of the estates, called by circular letters from the\r\nprince, was accordingly appointed to be held at Edinburgh, on the\r\n14th of March, 1689, and the supporters of the prince, as well as the\r\nadherents of the king, prepared to depart home to attend the ensuing\r\nelection. But the prince managed to detain them till he should be\r\ndeclared king, that as many as might feel inclined might seal their\r\nnew-born loyalty by kissing his hand; but William had to experience\r\nthe mortification of a refusal even from some of those whom he\r\nhad ranked amongst his warmest friends. The Earl of Balcarras and\r\nViscount Dundee, the former of whom had, as before mentioned, been\r\ninvested by the king with the civil, the latter with the military\r\nadministration of affairs in Scotland, were the first of either party\r\nwho arrived in Scotland, but not until the end of February, when the\r\nelections were about to commence. On their arrival at Edinburgh they\r\nfound the Duke of Gordon, who had hitherto refused to deliver up the\r\ncastle, though tempted by the most alluring offers from the prince,\r\nabout to capitulate, but they dissuaded him from this step, on the\r\nground that the king’s cause was not hopeless, and that the retention\r\nof such an important fortress was of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nThe elections commenced. The inhabitants of the southern and western\r\ncounties (for every Protestant, without distinction, was allowed to\r\nvote), alarmed for the extinction of their religious liberties, and\r\nexcited by the recollection of the wrongs they and their forefathers\r\nhad suffered, gave their suffrages to the popular candidate, and\r\nthe adherents of the king soon perceived that the chances were\r\nagainst him. Yet, when the convention met, a respectable minority\r\nseemed, notwithstanding, to be in favour of the king, but they had\r\nneither the courage nor address to oppose the popular current. To\r\noverawe, as is supposed, the friends of the king, or to prevent the\r\nconvention from being overawed by the troops in the castle, the\r\nDuke of Hamilton and his friends, a few days before the meeting of\r\nthe convention, introduced a considerable number of armed men into\r\nEdinburgh, some of whom were concealed in cellars and houses, ready\r\nto act as occasion might require. The first trial of strength between\r\nthe two parties took place on the election of a president. To the\r\nDuke of Hamilton the adherents of the king opposed the Marquis of\r\nAthole, who, in consequence of being slighted by the prince, had\r\npromised his support to the royal party; but the duke was elected by\r\na considerable majority. This vote sealed the fate of the Tory party,\r\nand many who had hitherto wavered in their allegiance now openly\r\nabandoned the cause of James. The consequence was, that within a few\r\ndays, the number of the adherents of the king was greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the convention was to send the Earls of Tweeddale\r\nand Leven, with an order to the Duke of Gordon to deliver up the\r\ncastle within twenty-four hours. The duke, overcome by the smooth and\r\ninsinuating behaviour of Tweeddale, reluctantly yielded, and promised\r\nto surrender the castle next morning at ten o’clock. When this answer\r\nwas brought to the convention, Balcarras and Dundee were alarmed, and\r\nimmediately despatched a confidential servant to the duke reminding\r\nhim of his promise to hold out, and imploring him not to give way.\r\nThe duke wavered, but on obtaining a writing which he required under\r\nthe hands of these noblemen that the retention of the castle was\r\nabsolutely necessary for the success of the king’s affairs, and\r\nbeing visited the following morning by Lord Dundee, who impressed\r\non him the importance of holding out, he resolved to break with the\r\nconvention. To prepare matters in the north he despatched thither\r\nthe Earl of Dunfermline, his brother-in-law, to whom he granted a\r\nwritten commission, authorising him to raise his friends and vassals\r\nin support of the king.[551]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the refusal of the duke to deliver up the castle,\r\nhe was, by order of the convention, summoned by the heralds at the\r\ngate of the castle to surrender, and a proclamation was read at the\r\nsame time prohibiting all persons from having any communication with\r\nhim, and promising a reward of six months’ pay to the Protestants\r\nin the garrison who should seize him and deliver him and the castle\r\nup to the convention. The duke addressed the heralds from within\r\nthe gate, and told them, that he kept the castle by commission from\r\ntheir common master, and would defend it to the last extremity; and\r\nafter handing them some guineas, which he requested they would spend\r\nin drinking the king’s health, and the healths of all his loyal\r\nsubjects, he facetiously advised them not to proclaim men traitors\r\nwith the king’s coats on their backs till they had turned them. Upon\r\nthe departure of the heralds, the duke drew out the garrison and gave\r\nthem their option, either to remain in the castle and share with him\r\nthe dangers that awaited them, or to depart. Upwards of a third of\r\nthe garrison took advantage of the permission to depart, and left the\r\ncastle on that and the following day.[552]\r\n\r\nAs the king’s friends saw that any efforts they could make in the\r\nconvention would be quite unavailing, they agreed at a private\r\nmeeting which they held on the 17th of March, to repair to Stirling\r\nand there hold a convention by themselves. This resolution was\r\nadopted agreeably to the wish of the king himself, who had sent a\r\nwritten authority, dated from Ireland, empowering the Archbishop of\r\nSt. Andrews, the Earl of Balcarras, and Viscount Dundee, to call a\r\nmeeting of the estates at Stirling. Balcarras and Dundee received\r\nan assurance from the Marquis of Athole, who, ever since the cold\r\nreception he had met with from William, had been wonderfully loyal,\r\nthat he would accompany them, and a similar promise was obtained from\r\nthe Earl of Mar, governor of Stirling castle. Athole, however, began\r\nto waver, a circumstance which deferred the departure of the king’s\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nHere it may not be improper to notice a circumstance which probably\r\nhad its weight in the deliberations preceding the departure of\r\nDundee. On the morning of 16th March, just as Lord Dundee was on the\r\npoint of going to the convention, he was waited upon by James Binnie,\r\na dyer, who informed him that he had overheard a conversation the\r\nday before among some persons of their intention of murdering him and\r\nSir George Mackenzie, and Binnie offered, if a warrant were granted\r\nhim, to apprehend them. Dundee immediately went to the convention and\r\napplied for protection, but they refused to act in the matter, and\r\npassed to the order of the day. Whether this affair was the device of\r\nthe Whig party, as has been supposed, to get quit of two individuals\r\nparticularly obnoxious to them, there are no means of ascertaining;\r\nbut when the circumstances of the times, and the opinions then held\r\nby many of the people are considered, the design of assassinating\r\nthem is far from improbable.[553]\r\n\r\nBut be this as it may, Dundee resolved to remain as short as\r\npossible in a place where he might be every moment exposed to the\r\ndagger of the assassin; and, accordingly, he and his friends fixed\r\non Monday the 18th of March for their departure for Stirling. With\r\nthe exception of Dundee, they all assembled at the appointed place\r\nof rendezvous in the city at the hour which had been fixed; but\r\nas the Marquis of Athole, who had promised to accompany them and\r\nto protect them on their arrival at Stirling with a body of his\r\nvassals, wished them to postpone their departure till the following\r\nday; they consented to remain, and were in the act of dispersing\r\nand proceeding to the convention when Dundee made his appearance.\r\nSuch an unexpected resolution greatly surprised him, but he told\r\nBalcarras, that whatever were the views of his friends, he would not\r\nremain another day in Edinburgh. Balcarras remonstrated with him,\r\nand represented, that his departure would give the alarm to their\r\nenemies, who would not fail to take advantage of the discovery;\r\nbut he replied, that as he had a select body of between forty and\r\nfifty troopers ready mounted and prepared to start, he would not\r\nremain any longer within the city, but would clear the walls with\r\nhis party and wait without for such friends as might choose to join\r\nhim. Dundee accordingly left the city at the head of his troopers, to\r\ngo, as he is said to have emphatically replied to a friend who put\r\nthe question to him, wherever the spirit of Montrose should direct.\r\nAfter passing the Nether Bow port, he turned to the left down Leith\r\nWynd, and after clearing the suburbs of the Calton, he faced to the\r\nwest, and proceeded along the line of road known at the time by the\r\nname of the Lang-gate, and which now forms the splendid terrace of\r\nPrinces’ street. On arriving opposite the castle, Dundee ordered his\r\nmen to halt, and alighting from his horse, he clambered up the steep\r\nprecipice on the west side of that fortress, and from the bottom of\r\nthe wall held a conference with the Duke of Gordon, who stood in\r\nan adjoining postern gate immediately above. No account has been\r\npreserved of the nature of the conversation which passed between\r\nthese two devoted adherents of the king, but it is understood that\r\nthe viscount entreated the duke to hold out the castle as long as he\r\ncould, and that he would endeavour to raise the siege as soon as he\r\nhad collected sufficient forces.[554]\r\n\r\nThe convention despatched a Major Bunting with a party of horse in\r\npursuit, but although he overtook Dundee, he had not the courage\r\nto attack him, alarmed by a threat with which, it is said, Dundee\r\nmenaced him, that he would send him (Bunting) back to the convention,\r\nin a pair of blankets, did he dare to molest him.[555] Dundee crossed\r\nStirling bridge the second day of his departure, and proceeded to\r\nhis residence of Dudhope, near Dundee, to ruminate over the events\r\nwhich had just passed, and to concoct his plans, under the new\r\nand extraordinary circumstances in which he was placed, for the\r\nrestoration of James.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[520] “I believe there was never accident in the world altered the\r\ndisposition of a people more than that (the king’s return) did\r\nthe Scottish nation. Sober men observed, it not only inebriat but\r\nreally intoxicate, and made people not only drunk but frantick; men\r\ndid not think they could handsomely express their joy except they\r\nturned brutes for debauch, rebels, and pugeants; yea, many a sober\r\nman was tempted to exceed, lest he should be condemned as unnatural,\r\ndisloyal, and unsensible. Most of the nobility, and many of the\r\ngentry, and hungry old souldiers, flew to London, just as the vulture\r\ndoes to the carcase.

On entering she made\r\nthem immediately change clothes; they did so, and, on the expiration\r\nof the half-hour, she, in a flood of tears, bade farewell to her\r\nsupposed father, and walked out of the prison with the most perfect\r\ndignity, and with a slow pace. The sentinel at the drawbridge, a\r\nsly Highlander, eyed her father hard, but her presence of mind did\r\nnot desert her, she twitched her train of embroidery, carried in\r\nthose days by the page, out of his hand, and, dropping it in the\r\nmud, “Varlet,” cried she, in a fury, dashing it across his face,\r\n“take that--and that too,” adding a box on the ear, “for knowing no\r\nbetter how to carry your lady’s garment.” Her ill-treatment of him,\r\nand the dirt with which she had besmeared his face, so confounded\r\nthe sentinel, that he let them pass the drawbridge unquestioned.’\r\nHaving passed through all the guards, attended by a gentleman from\r\nthe castle, Lady Sophia entered her carriage, which was in waiting\r\nfor her; ‘the Earl,’ says a contemporary annalist, ‘steps up on\r\nthe hinder part of her coach as her lackey, and, coming forgainst\r\nthe weighhouse, slips off and shifts for himself.’”--_Lives of the\r\nLindsays_, vol. ii. p. 147.\r\n\r\n[531] Hume’s _Narrative_, pp. 5-9.\r\n\r\n[532] Hume’s _Nar._, p. 15.

A person of this name from\r\nLochwinnoch, within forty years ago, had gone to the Balloch fair,\r\nnear Dumbarton, in the capacity of a horse-dealer.

Colin had been in town but\r\nthree or four days, which he had employed in endeavours to unite his\r\nMajesty’s friends in his interest. ‘He was received affectionately,’\r\nsays his son, ‘but observed that there were none with the king but\r\nsome of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber.’ L---- came in, one of the\r\ngenerals of his army disbanded about a fortnight before. He informed\r\nthe king that most of his generals and colonels of his guards had\r\nassembled that morning upon observing the universal joy of the city\r\nupon his return; that the result of their meeting was to appoint him\r\nto tell his Majesty that still much was in their power to serve and\r\ndefend him; that most part of the army disbanded was either in London\r\nor near it; and that, if he would order them to beat their drums,\r\nthey were confident twenty thousand men could be got together before\r\nthe end of next day.--‘My lord,’ says the king, ‘I know you to be\r\nmy friend, sincere and honourable; the men who sent you are not so,\r\nand I expect nothing from them.’--He then said it was a fine day--he\r\nwould take a walk. None attended him but Colin and Lord Dundee. When\r\nhe was in the Mall, he stopped and looked at them, and asked how they\r\ncame to be with him, when all the world had forsaken him and gone to\r\nthe Prince of Orange? Colin said their fidelity to so good a master\r\nwould ever be the same; they had nothing to do with the Prince of\r\nOrange,--Lord Dundee made the strongest professions of duty;--‘Will\r\nyou two, as gentlemen, say you have still attachment to me?’--‘Sir,\r\nwe do.’--‘Will you give me your hands upon it, as men of honour?’\r\nthey did so,--‘Well, I see you are the men I always took you to be;\r\nyou shall know all my intentions.

John Graham, Viscount Dundee,\r\ndescended from the royal line of the Stuarts by the marriage of\r\nWilliam, Lord Graham of Kincardine, his ancestor, with the Princess\r\nMary, second daughter of King Robert III., was the eldest son of\r\nSir William Graham of Claverhouse in Angus or Forfarshire, and was\r\nborn in 1643. Besides a royal descent, Viscount Dundee also claimed\r\nto be descended, through the family of Morphy in Mearns, from the\r\nillustrious house of Montrose, and was also allied to the noble\r\nfamily of Northesk by his mother, Lady Jean Carnegy, who was fourth\r\ndaughter of the first earl. Young Graham entered the university\r\nof St. Andrews in the year 1660, where, according to his partial\r\nbiographer, he made “very considerable progress” in “Humanity\r\nand Mathematics.” He was chiefly remarkable for his enthusiastic\r\npredilection for Highland poetry and the established order of\r\nthings. He left the university in 1670 and went to France, where\r\nhe entered as a volunteer. He afterwards transferred his services\r\nto Holland, and received the commission of a cornet in one of the\r\nPrince of Orange’s troops of guards. He distinguished himself at\r\nthe battle of Seneffe, in 1674, by saving the life of the prince,\r\nwho had been dismounted, and carrying him off upon his own horse.\r\nHaving been refused the command of one of the Scottish regiments\r\nin the employment of the States, he left the Dutch service and\r\nreturned to Scotland in the year 1677, and was appointed by Charles\r\nII. captain of one of the regiments then raising in Scotland for\r\nthe suppression of the Whigs, in which service he acquired from the\r\nunfortunate Covenanters, on account of his severities, the unenviable\r\nappellation of “the bloody Clavers.” The confidence which Charles\r\nhad bestowed on Captain Graham was continued by his successor James,\r\nwho, after promoting him successively to the ranks of brigadier and\r\nmajor-general, raised him to the peerage under the title of Viscount\r\nDundee, on the 12th of November 1688, seven days after the invasion\r\nof the Prince of Orange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Graham, Viscount Dundee.\r\n\r\nFrom Original Painting in possession of the Earl of Strathmore.]\r\n\r\nThe idea of setting up a counter convention at Stirling, was\r\nimmediately abandoned on the departure of Dundee from the capital.\r\nThe Marquis of Athole, whom the adherents of the king had chosen\r\nfor their leader, showed no disposition to follow Dundee, and the\r\nEarl of Mar, who to save his loyalty made a feint to escape by the\r\nonly guarded way, was apprehended, not unwillingly, as is supposed,\r\nby the sentinels, and brought back, but was released on giving his\r\nparole that he would not leave the city without the permission of\r\nthe convention. The ambiguous conduct of these two noblemen tended\r\nto cool the ardour of the few remaining adherents of the king, some\r\nof whom resolved to support the new order of things, whilst others,\r\nless pliant, absented themselves wholly from the convention. That\r\nassembly, after approving of the conduct of the English convention,\r\nin requesting the Prince of Orange (now declared King of England)\r\nto take upon him the administration of the affairs of that kingdom,\r\nacknowledged their obligations to him as the assertor of their\r\nliberties, and also entreated him to assume the management of the\r\naffairs of Scotland.\r\n\r\nPopular as the steps were which the convention were about to take for\r\nsettling the government of the nation, with the great body of the\r\npeople, they were not insensible to the probability of a formidable\r\nopposition being raised to their plans by a determined band of\r\nroyalists in the north, who, headed by such a warlike and experienced\r\ncommander as Dundee, might involve the whole kingdom in a civil war.\r\nTo prepare, therefore, against such an emergency, the convention\r\nbefore proceeding to the important business for which it had\r\nassembled issued a proclamation, requiring all persons from sixteen\r\nto sixty, and capable of bearing arms, to put themselves in readiness\r\nto take the field when called upon; they deprived all militia\r\nofficers suspected of attachment to the king of their commissions,\r\nand filled up the vacancies thus occasioned by others on whom they\r\ncould rely. Sir Patrick Hume, who lay under an attainder for the part\r\nhe took in Argyle’s rebellion, was appointed to the command of the\r\nhorse militia, and the Earl of Leven was nominated to the command of\r\na body of 800 men, raised for a guard to the city of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nBacked by these, and by about 1100 men of the Scotch brigade from\r\nHolland, which arrived at Leith from England, on the 25th of\r\nMarch, under General Mackay, as major-general of all the forces\r\nin Scotland,[556] and by a force of 200 dragoons which were also\r\nsent from England; the leaders of the convention proposed that a\r\ncommittee of eight lords, eight knights, and eight burgesses, should\r\nbe appointed to prepare and report upon a plan of settling the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe throne having been declared vacant, the convention, on the\r\nmotion of the Duke of Hamilton, appointed the committee to draw up\r\nan act for settling the crown of Scotland upon William and Mary, and\r\nthey were also instructed to prepare an instrument or declaration\r\nfor preventing a recurrence of the grievances, of which the nation\r\ncomplained. The Earl of Argyle on the part of the lords, Sir James\r\nMontgomery for the knights, and Sir John Dalrymple for the burghs,\r\nwere thereupon despatched to London to offer the crown to William\r\nand Mary, on the conditions stipulated by the convention. The\r\ncommissioners were introduced to their majesties at Whitehall, on the\r\n11th of May, and were of course well received, but on the coronation\r\noath being presented to them by the Earl of Argyle, William, who\r\nwas rather disposed to support episcopacy in Scotland, demurred to\r\ntake it, as it appeared by a clause which it contained, importing\r\nthat their majesties should root out heresy, and all enemies to the\r\ntrue worship of God, to lay him under an obligation to become a\r\npersecutor. This difficulty, which it is evident was well founded,\r\nwas however got over by the commissioners declaring that such was not\r\nthe meaning or import of the oath.\r\n\r\nThe convention having thus completed the object for which it\r\nwas assembled, adjourned to the 21st of May, not however till\r\nit had passed an act at utter variance with those principles of\r\nconstitutional liberty, which it professed to establish. By this\r\nact the Duke of Hamilton was vested with full power and authority\r\nto imprison any person he might suspect of disaffection to the new\r\ngovernment, a violent and arbitrary measure certainly, which nothing\r\nbut the extraordinary circumstances of the times could justify. The\r\nEarl of Balcarras and Viscount Dundee were marked out as the first\r\nvictims of this unconstitutional law. The latter had been already\r\nproclaimed an outlaw and a rebel by the convention, for absenting\r\nhimself from its meetings, but he had hitherto made no movement,\r\nin consequence of instructions from the king, desiring him not to\r\ntake the field till a force of 5,000 foot, and 300 horse, which he\r\npromised to send him from Ireland, should land in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese instructions having come to the knowledge of Hamilton, hastened\r\nhis determination to arrest Balcarras and Dundee. Balcarras was\r\nseized at his country seat, carried to Edinburgh, and imprisoned in\r\nthe common jail, from which he was afterwards transferred to the\r\ncastle after its surrender; but Dundee, who had received notice of\r\nthe approach of the party, retired from his house at Dudhope and took\r\nrefuge in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe favourable reception which James had met with in Ireland, and\r\nthe discovery which the adherents of William in Scotland had made\r\nof his intention to land an army in Scotland, joined to the fact\r\nthat the great body of the Highlanders, and almost the whole of the\r\nepiscopal party in the north, were hostile to the recent change\r\nin the government, could not fail to excite alarm in the minds of\r\nthe partizans of the new dynasty. The brilliant achievements of\r\nMontrose had shown how inadequate the peaceful inhabitants of the\r\nsouth, though impelled by the spirit of religious fanaticism, were\r\nto contend with the brave and hardy mountaineers of the north; and\r\nas Dundee, as they were aware, was desirous of emulating his great\r\npredecessor, and was engaged in an active correspondence with the\r\nHighland chiefs, they must necessarily have looked forward to a long\r\nand bloody, and perhaps a doubtful contest.\r\n\r\nAs Dundee possessed the confidence of the Highland clans,[557] and\r\nas he looked chiefly to them for support in his attempt to restore\r\nthe exiled monarch, Viscount Tarbat, one of the ablest politicians of\r\nthe period, proposed a plan for detaching the chiefs from the cause\r\nof James, some of whom he averred were not so inimical to William\r\nnor so attached to James, as was supposed; but who, jealous of the\r\npower of Argyle, were justly apprehensive that if, as appearances\r\nindicated, that nobleman acquired an ascendency in the national\r\ncouncils, he would make use of his power to oppress them, and would\r\nobtain a revocation of the grants of certain lands which belonged\r\nto his family, and which had been forfeited in the reign of Charles\r\nII. Besides these reasons, there was another which was supposed\r\nto influence others in their determination to restore the fallen\r\ndynasty, and thereby crush the rising power of Argyle, viz. that they\r\nwere greatly in arrears to him as their superior. Tarbat, therefore,\r\nsuggested to General Mackay, that an attempt should be made, in the\r\nfirst place to obtain the submission of these last by making them\r\nan offer to discharge Argyle’s claims against their lands, which\r\nhe computed would amount to £5,000 sterling, and that a separate\r\noffer should be made to the chief of the Macleans to make good a\r\ntransaction which had been in part entered upon between him and the\r\nlate earl for adjusting their differences. This plan was approved\r\nof by the English government, but the affair is said to have been\r\nmarred by the appointment of Campbell of Cawdor as negotiator, who\r\nwas personally obnoxious to the chiefs. Mackay attempted to open a\r\ncorrespondence with Cameron of Lochiel on the subject, but could\r\nobtain no answer, and Macdonell of Glengary, to whom he also made a\r\ncommunication, heartily despising the bribe, advised the general,\r\nin return, to imitate the conduct of General Monk, by restoring\r\nJames.[558]\r\n\r\nDundee crossed the Dee, and entered the Duke of Gordon’s country,\r\nthe inhabitants of which were friendly to the cause of James, and\r\nwhere he was joined by about 50 horse under the Earl of Dunfermline,\r\nwho, as has been stated, was sent north by the Duke of Gordon to\r\nraise his vassals in support of his royal master. Whilst Dundee was\r\noccupied in raising forces in this district, Mackay was despatched\r\nfrom Edinburgh with a considerable body of troops in pursuit. Mackay\r\nappointed the town of Dundee as the rendezvous for his troops,\r\nbeing the best station he could select for keeping the adjoining\r\ncountry, which was disaffected to the new government, in awe, and\r\nwhence he could send parties to the north to watch the motions of\r\nDundee. On arriving at Dundee, Mackay, leaving a part of his troops\r\nthere under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Livingston, proceeded\r\nnorth with a body of about 500 men, consisting chiefly of dragoons,\r\nin quest of the viscount. At Brechin he received intelligence that\r\nDundee, ignorant of course of Mackay’s movements, was on his return\r\nto his seat of Glenogilvie in the braes of Angus, that he had already\r\npassed the Cairn-a-mount, and that he was expected to pass the night\r\nat Fettercairn, only a few miles north from Brechin. The viscount,\r\nhowever, having been apprized of Mackay’s movements, recrossed the\r\nDee.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mackay was informed of this retrograde movement, he\r\nresolved to pursue Dundee, and, if possible, to overtake him before\r\nhe should have time to collect any considerable body of forces. With\r\na small but select body of horse and foot, therefore, he crossed the\r\nDee at Kincardine, in the expectation of being joined in the course\r\nof his march by some country gentlemen who had given him assurances\r\nof support before leaving Edinburgh. In this expectation, however,\r\nhe was sadly disappointed, for, with the exception of the Master of\r\nForbes, who met him after he had crossed the Dee, with a party of\r\n40 gentlemen of his name on horseback and a body of between 500 and\r\n600 men on foot, chiefly raw peasantry, not one of them showed any\r\ninclination to join him. The fact was, that, with few exceptions,\r\nthe people residing to the north of the Tay, were either indifferent\r\nto the course of events, or were opposed upon principle to any\r\nchange in the hereditary succession to the crown, which many of them\r\nconsidered an infraction of the Divine law, and which they believed\r\nno misconduct on the part of the king could justify. No man knew\r\nthese things better than Dundee, who calculated that by means of this\r\nfeeling he would soon be able to arouse the war-like north against\r\nthe more peaceful south. But valuable as such a body of auxiliaries\r\nas that brought by the Master of Forbes may be supposed to have been\r\nunder these circumstances, Mackay, who had been accustomed to the\r\nfinest troops in Europe, considered that they would be of no service\r\nto him, as, according to his own account, they were “ill armed,”\r\nand appeared “little like the work” for which they were intended.\r\nHe therefore declined the services of the Forbeses in the meantime,\r\nand after thanking the master for having brought them together, he\r\nordered him to dismiss them to their homes, with instructions that\r\nthey should re-assemble whenever a necessity occurred for defending\r\ntheir own country against the inroads of Dundee.\r\n\r\nHaving received intelligence of Dundee’s route through Strathdon\r\ntowards Strathbogie, Mackay continued his march in that direction\r\nthrough Aberdeenshire and Moray. On arriving at Strathbogie, he\r\nwas informed that Dundee had crossed the Spey with about 150 horse\r\nwithout opposition, although Mackay had given particular instruction\r\nto the laird of Grant, while in Edinburgh, to occupy all the fords of\r\nthat river. Mackay also learned, on the following day, by a letter\r\nsent to him by the magistrates of Elgin, which had been addressed\r\nto them by Dundee, that the viscount was at Inverness, that he had\r\nbeen there joined by Macdonald of Keppoch at the head of 1,000\r\nHighlanders, and that he intended to make Elgin his head-quarters\r\npreparatory to an attack upon Mackay. The accession of the Macdonalds\r\nwas of immense importance to Dundee, and was as seasonable as\r\nunexpected. A deadly feud had for some time existed between Macdonald\r\nand Mackintosh, arising out of certain claims by the former upon\r\nthe lands of the latter; and to such a pitch of armed violence did\r\nKeppoch carry his pretensions, that James II. felt himself called\r\nupon to interfere, by issuing a commission of fire and sword against\r\nhim as a rebel. Keppoch, taking advantage of the unsettled state of\r\nthe government, renewed his claims against Mackintosh; and having\r\ndefeated the Mackintoshes in battle, he had advanced to Inverness,\r\nthe inhabitants of which had supported the Mackintoshes against him,\r\nand was threatening to wreak his vengeance upon them if they did\r\nnot purchase forbearance by paying him a large pecuniary fine. It\r\nwas at this critical moment that Dundee arrived, who, anxious at\r\nonce to secure the aid of Keppoch and the friendship of the citizens\r\nof Inverness, who had only a few days before proclaimed the Prince\r\nof Orange, interposed between them and their exasperated foe, and\r\nsatisfied the latter’s supposed claims by collecting the amount of\r\nhis demands by subscription among the inhabitants.[559]\r\n\r\nThe news of the junction of the Keppoch Highlanders with Dundee,\r\nand of their intention to march to the south, was exceedingly\r\ndisconcerting to Mackay, who had advanced into a hostile country\r\nwith a handful of troops quite incapable of resisting the powerful\r\nforce now opposed to them. The obvious and apparently most prudential\r\ncourse which presented itself, was, on the approach of the enemy,\r\nto make a sure and as slow a retreat as possible, and to bring up\r\nthe forces which he had left behind him; but Mackay, rightly judging\r\nthat a retreat, besides giving Dundee the command of a large tract of\r\ncountry favourable to his views, might create an impression that his\r\nadversary was much stronger than he really was, resolved not only to\r\nstand firm, but even to cross the Spey, and take possession of Elgin\r\nbefore Dundee should arrive there. Accordingly, after despatching\r\na courier to bring up his reserves from Brechin without delay, he\r\ncrossed the Spey and advanced upon Elgin, with his dragoons at a hard\r\ntrot, followed by 200 veteran foot, who were so desirous of coming to\r\naction that they kept up with the horse the whole way from the river\r\nto the town. From Elgin, Mackay despatched messengers to some of the\r\nprincipal Whig proprietors in Moray, Ross, and Sutherland, desiring\r\nthem to prepare themselves for joining him as soon as they should\r\nreceive his orders.\r\n\r\nMackay lay a few days at Elgin in expectation of Dundee’s advance;\r\nbut as the latter did not appear, Mackay, who had just received a\r\nreinforcement of horse from Brechin, left Elgin and took the road to\r\nInverness. When he reached Forres, he ascertained that Dundee had\r\nleft Inverness, and had crossed the heights of Badenoch on his way to\r\nAthole. It is said that Dundee intended to have advanced upon Elgin,\r\nand to have engaged Mackay, but he was counteracted in his design by\r\nthe refusal of a party of Camerons, who were under Keppoch, to march\r\nwithout the consent of their chief, their real motive apparently\r\nbeing that they were desirous of securing what booty they had taken.\r\nMackay continued his march to Inverness, where he was joined by 500\r\nof the Mackays, Grants, and Rosses. From Inverness, he despatched\r\ncouriers to the adherents of the new government in the north to join\r\nhim; and at the same time sent an express to Colonel Balfour at\r\nEdinburgh, to despatch Colonel Ramsay north with a select body of\r\n600 men to be drawn from the Dutch regiments. To effect as speedy a\r\njunction with him as possible, Mackay directed that Ramsay should\r\nmarch through Athole and Badenoch. These transactions, Burton[560]\r\nthinks happened probably about the beginning of May.\r\n\r\nDundee, on the other hand, was no less busy in his preparations\r\nfor the ensuing campaign. He never ceased to carry on an active\r\ncorrespondence with many of the Highland chieftains whose confidence\r\nhe possessed; and on his march through Badenoch he received the\r\nmost gratifying assurances of support from the gentlemen of that\r\ncountry, with the exception of Mackintosh, who had taken offence at\r\nDundee. Having fixed upon Lochaber as the most central and convenient\r\ndistrict for mustering his forces, Dundee appointed the friends of\r\nKing James to assemble there on the 18th of May, and in the meantime\r\nhe descended into Athole, with a body of 150 horse, where he met with\r\na cordial reception from Stewart of Ballechan, factor or steward to\r\nthe Marquis of Athole, and from the other vassals of the marquis.\r\nWhether Stewart and the other gentlemen of the district, in taking\r\nthis decided part, acted from a private understanding with their\r\nchief, who still remained at Edinburgh, where he had given in an\r\nequivocal adherence to the government, or whether they were yet\r\nignorant of the course he meant to follow, are questions which, for\r\nwant of information, do not admit of solution. The omission on the\r\npart of the marquis to send instructions to Stewart to raise a body\r\nof 400 Athole Highlanders, to oppose the passage of Dundee through\r\nhis bounds to the south, should he attempt it, to which effect he\r\nhad pledged himself to Mackay, before the latter left Edinburgh for\r\nthe north, raises a suspicion that the gentlemen of Athole acted\r\nagreeably to the understood wishes of their chief.[561]\r\n\r\nBeing informed that the lairds of Blair and Pollock were lying in\r\nPerth with a troop of horse, which they had raised for the service of\r\nthe government, Dundee determined to surprise them, and accordingly\r\nleft Athole, and proceeded with celerity during the night towards\r\nPerth, which he entered unawares early next morning, and seized both\r\nthese gentlemen and two other officers in their beds, carrying them\r\noff prisoners. He also took away 30 horses, and a sum of 9,000 merks\r\nof the public revenue which he found in the office of the collector.\r\nLeaving Perth, Dundee ranged through Angus, augmenting his cavalry,\r\nand after an ineffectual attempt to surprise Lord Rollo, who was\r\nraising a troop of horse, he appeared before the town of Dundee, then\r\nguarded by two troops of Livingston’s dragoons. Their commander,\r\nunwilling to encounter Dundee, shut himself up in the town, and the\r\nviscount, after spending two nights at Dudhope, his country seat,\r\nreturned to the Highlands, to meet his friends at the appointed place\r\nof rendezvous.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Mackay remained at Inverness, waiting for\r\nthe arrival of Ramsay’s detachment from the south, which he had\r\nlong and anxiously looked for. In conformity with Mackay’s orders,\r\nColonel Balfour immediately put the troops under Colonel Ramsay in\r\nreadiness to march, but just as they were about to pass across the\r\nFrith of Forth, from Leith to Burntisland, an alarm was created by\r\nthe appearance of a large number of vessels at the mouth of the\r\nFrith, which were at once supposed to be a French fleet with troops\r\non board for the purpose of making a descent upon the coast in\r\nsupport of Dundee. As the seizure of the capital, it was naturally\r\nsupposed, would be the first object of the invaders, the embarkation\r\nof Ramsay’s detachment, which in such an event would be necessary for\r\nits defence, was countermanded; but in two or three days the fears of\r\nthe government were dispelled, by having ascertained that the fleet\r\nin question consisted of a number of Dutch herring vessels which\r\nwere proceeding on their annual voyage to the fishing stations on\r\nthe northern coast. This delay occasioned great embarrassment to the\r\noperations of Mackay, and almost proved fatal to him, as Dundee was\r\nthereby enabled to throw himself with a large force between Mackay’s\r\nand Ramsay’s corps, and to threaten both with annihilation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of his instructions, Ramsay, after reaching Perth, proceeded\r\nthrough Athole, on his way to Inverness. Though the Athole-men,\r\nmany of whom he found armed, offered no opposition to his march,\r\nyet as every thing around him assumed a warlike appearance, and\r\nas reports were continually brought to him that Dundee had placed\r\nhimself between him and Mackay, with a very large force, he grew\r\nalarmed, and so strong had his fears become when within a dozen of\r\nmiles of Ruthven in Badenoch, that he resolved to return to Perth.\r\nHe had previously despatched a letter to Mackay, informing him of\r\nhis advance, and appointing a meeting at Ruthven on a given day,\r\nbut he neglected to send another express acquainting Mackay of his\r\ndesign to return to Perth. The retreat of Ramsay was disorderly, and\r\nsome of his men deserted. The Athole-men, who kept hovering about\r\nhim, were desirous of attacking him, but they were prevented, though\r\nwith difficulty, by the gentlemen of the district. Mackay having\r\nreceived Ramsay’s despatch, was so anxious to form a speedy junction\r\nwith the latter’s detachment, that he left Inverness the following\r\n(Sunday) morning, taking with him only two days’ provisions. When\r\nabout half-way between Inverness and Ruthven, he received an express\r\nfrom the governor of the castle, informing him of Ramsay’s retreat,\r\nand that Dundee acting on information contained in an intercepted\r\ndespatch of Mackay’s, had entered Badenoch on Sunday morning, (the\r\nmorning of Mackay’s march from Inverness,) with an immense force,\r\nand was within a few miles of the castle.\r\n\r\nThe first person who had met Dundee in Lochaber on the appointed day\r\nwas Glengary, who had with him a body of between 200 and 300 men. He\r\nwas followed by Macdonald of Morer, at the head of nearly 200 of Clan\r\nRanald’s men, and by Appin and Glencoe, with about the same number.\r\nDundee had been subsequently joined by Lochiel (now 60 years of age),\r\nwho had 600 men under him, and by Keppoch, at the head of 200; but\r\nSir Alexander Maclean, who had promised also to attend, failed to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence communicated by the commander of Ruthven castle\r\nwas exceedingly perplexing to Mackay, who must have felt keenly the\r\ndisappointment of Ramsay’s flight. He saw himself with a handful\r\nof men surrounded by a warlike and hostile population, and within\r\na short march of a powerful force, which he could not singly\r\nresist--with few friends on whom he could place much reliance. He\r\nhad, in the unfortunate situation in which he was placed, only a\r\nchoice of evils before him. To have proceeded on his march with the\r\nview of cutting his way through the enemy, would have been, even if\r\npracticable, an imprudent and very dangerous step, and to have taken\r\nup a position in a district where he would have been exposed to be\r\nsurrounded and cut off from his resources, would have been equally\r\nrash. He had, therefore, no alternative which he could prudently\r\nadopt, but either to fall back upon Inverness, or retire down the\r\nvale of the Spey. He preferred the latter course; for, although\r\nsuch a movement would leave Inverness quite exposed to Dundee’s\r\narmy, that disadvantage would be more than counterbalanced by the\r\nprotection which would be thereby afforded to the laird of Grant’s\r\nlands, near the borders of which Dundee was now hovering, and by the\r\nobstruction which the interposition of Mackay’s troops would present\r\nto any attempt on the part of Dundee to recruit his army in the Duke\r\nof Gordon’s country. Besides, by making Strathspey the scene of his\r\noperations, Mackay expected to be able to keep up a communication\r\nwith the south through Angus and Aberdeenshire, and the adjoining\r\nparts of Moray, which he could not maintain if he returned to\r\nInverness.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after despatching an express to Inverness, apprising\r\nthe garrison of his intentions, and promising assistance, should\r\nDundee venture to attack the town, Mackay began a rapid march towards\r\nStrathspey, which he continued during the night, and did not halt\r\ntill he had descended a considerable way down that vale. Dundee, who\r\nhad closely pursued him, afraid of exposing his men to the attacks of\r\nMackay’s cavalry, did not follow him after he had gained the flatter\r\npart of the Strath, but kept aloof at the distance of some miles\r\nin a more elevated position where he encamped. Notwithstanding his\r\ninferiority in point of numbers, the revolutionary general determined\r\nto endeavour to allure Dundee from his stronghold by offering him\r\nbattle, and having refreshed his men, wearied by a long march of\r\ntwenty-four hours, he advanced next morning to within a mile of\r\nDundee’s camp, and, after reconnoitring the position of the enemy,\r\nmade preparations for receiving them; but Dundee, secure from danger,\r\nby the nature of the ground he occupied, showed no disposition\r\nto engage. It is probable that, in acting thus passively, he was\r\ninfluenced by the conduct of the Highlanders, who were averse to\r\nengage with cavalry, and some of whom (the Camerons, according to\r\nMackay,) fled to the neighbouring hills on Mackay’s approach. Seeing\r\nno hope of drawing the viscount out of his trenches, Mackay returned\r\nin the evening to his camp, which he removed the following day to\r\nColmnakill, about six miles lower down the Spey, where he considered\r\nhimself more secure from any sudden surprise or attack, and where\r\nhe was speedily joined by two troops of Livingston’s dragoons\r\nfrom Dundee. The ground occupied by Mackay was a spacious plain,\r\nbounded on the south by the Spey, which effectually protected his\r\nrear, whilst his front was covered by a wood and some marshes which\r\nskirted the plain on the north. The right of Mackay’s position was\r\nprotected by a small river with a rough and stony bottom. The general\r\nhimself took up his quarters at Belcastle, a summer-house in the\r\nneighbourhood belonging to the laird of Grant, whence he despatched\r\nten or twelve of Grant’s tenants, selected by Grant himself as the\r\nmost intelligent and trustworthy, to watch and bring him notice of\r\nDundee’s motions. These scouts kept up a constant communication\r\nwith Mackay, who received a report from one or other of them almost\r\nevery alternate hour. In the meantime, he kept his whole army under\r\narms, and to prevent surprise, small parties of horse and dragoons\r\npatrolled the neighbouring woods, and some foot were stationed along\r\nthe banks of the little river on the right. But these precautions\r\nwould probably have been unavailing, if the government general had\r\nnot timeously been made acquainted with the fact, that there were\r\nenemies in his camp who were watching an opportunity to betray him.\r\n\r\nFor some time, a report had been current that Livingston’s regiment\r\nof dragoons was disaffected to the government; but as Mackay could\r\nnot trace the rumour to any authentic source, he disbelieved it,\r\nand to mark his confidence in its fidelity, he had ordered the two\r\ntroops which were stationed at Dundee to join him in the north. But\r\ntwo days after two deserters from Dundee’s camp informed Mackay\r\nthat, with few exceptions, all the dragoon officers had entered into\r\na conspiracy to betray him. They said that they had heard Dundee\r\nfrequently assure the chiefs of the clans that he could depend upon\r\nthe dragoons, and heard him inform the chiefs, that till he saw a\r\nfavourable opportunity for requiring the services of the dragoons,\r\nhe would allow them to remain in the enemy’s camp, where they might\r\nbe useful to him. The deserters likewise informed Mackay that they\r\nhad not left Dundee’s camp altogether of their own accord, but partly\r\nat the instigation of the lairds of Blair and Pollock, who had been\r\ncarried about by Dundee as prisoners ever since their capture at\r\nPerth, and who were anxious to prevent Mackay from engaging, under\r\nthese circumstances, with such a small party of troops as he then had.\r\n\r\nThis information, though calculated to shake the general’s confidence\r\nin the fidelity of these dragoons, was too vague and unsatisfactory\r\nto be relied upon. Mackay appears at first to have had some doubts\r\nof the truth of the statement; but his unwillingness to believe the\r\naccusation gave place to an opposite impression when, after ordering\r\nthe deserters to be confined in Belcastle, and threatening them with\r\nexemplary punishment should it turn out that they were spies sent by\r\nDundee, they expressed themselves quite satisfied to abide the result\r\nof any investigation he might institute.\r\n\r\nMackay, though now satisfied that there were traitors in his camp,\r\ntook no steps to secure them, but continued to remain in his position\r\nwaiting for the arrival of Barclay’s dragoons and Leslie’s foot from\r\nForfar and Couper Angus. Mackay might have retreated down the river,\r\nbut he was advised to remain at Colmnakill by Sir Thomas Livingston\r\nand the laird of Grant; because by retaining his ground, his expected\r\nsuccours would be every day drawing nearer to him, and every day thus\r\nspent would be lost to Dundee, who was prevented, by his presence,\r\nfrom communicating with those places in the low country from which\r\nhe expected reinforcements, particularly in horse, of which he\r\nstood in most need. Besides, by retiring, Mackay considered that he\r\nmight probably be forced to recross the Grampians before the two\r\nregiments could join him, in which case he would leave the whole of\r\nthe north exposed to Dundee, who would probably avail himself of the\r\nopportunity to raise a force too formidable to be encountered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Dundee sent a detachment of his army to lay siege\r\nto the old castle of Ruthven, in which Mackay, on his arrival at\r\nInverness, had placed a garrison of about 60 of Grant’s Highlanders,\r\nunder the command of John Forbes, brother to Culloden. The garrison\r\nbeing in want of provisions, capitulated on the condition that their\r\nlives should be spared, and that they should be allowed to return\r\nto their homes on their parole. While conducted through Dundee’s\r\ncamp, Forbes observed all the horses saddled, and his army preparing\r\nas if for an immediate march. In proceeding towards Colmnakill, he\r\nmet, at the distance of about a mile from Dundee’s lines, two men\r\non horseback, one in a red, the other in a blue uniform. The latter\r\nimmediately challenged him with the usual parole, “Qui vive?” on\r\nwhich Forbes returning the “Vive le Roi Guilleaume,” as indicative\r\nof his loyalty to the existing government, the man in red informed\r\nhim that they had been despatched from Mackay’s camp to obtain\r\nintelligence of the enemy. Captain Forbes then cautioned the men of\r\nthe risk they would run if they proceeded farther, but regardless\r\nof his advice, they rode forward in the direction of Dundee’s camp.\r\nForbes having mentioned this occurrence to Mackay the same day, the\r\nlatter immediately suspected that the officers of dragoons were in\r\ncommunication with Dundee, as he had given no such order as the man\r\nclothed in red had pretended. He, thereupon, desired inquiry to be\r\nmade if any dragoons had been sent out, and by whom; and as blue was\r\nthe uniform of Livingston’s men, he desired them to be instantly\r\nmustered to ascertain if any were absent; but the general had\r\nscarcely issued these instructions, when some of his scouts brought\r\nhim intelligence that Dundee’s army was moving down the Strath\r\ntowards Colmnakill. This movement, combined with the information\r\nwhich had been communicated to him by Forbes, left no doubt of the\r\ntreachery of the dragoons.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Mackay had no alternative but an immediate\r\nretreat. Calling, therefore, his commanding officers together, he\r\nordered them to put their men under arms, and to form them upon\r\nthe plain in marching order. He next addressed himself to the\r\nlaird of Grant, and after expressing his regret at the step he was\r\nabout to take, by which Grant’s lands would be left for a short\r\ntime exposed to the ravages of Dundee’s army, he requested him to\r\norder his tenants to drive their cattle down the country out of\r\nthe reach of the enemy, who would probably overlook them in their\r\nanxiety to follow him in his retreat. Grant listened to this advice\r\nwith becoming attention, but to show how little he regarded his\r\nown personal interest, as opposed to what he conceived his duty to\r\nhis country, he observed, that though he might lose every thing\r\nby Dundee’s invasion of his country, he would not take one step\r\nprejudicial to the government.\r\n\r\nIn fixing the order of his retreat, Mackay adopted the plan he had\r\nbeen accustomed to follow, that he might not excite the jealousy of\r\nthe dragoons, or make them suspect that he was distrustful of them.\r\nAccordingly, as was his usual practice, he divided the dragoons into\r\ntwo bodies, one of which, consisting of Major and Captain Balfour’s\r\ncompanies, he placed in the rear, and the other four companies\r\ncommanded by the disaffected officers he placed in the front, that he\r\nmight overawe them by his own presence. Immediately before the two\r\ntroops of dragoons which formed the rear-guard, Mackay placed 200\r\nfoot, chiefly grenadiers of the three Scoto-Dutch regiments, and next\r\nto them the English horse, then scarcely 70 men strong, and between\r\nthose horse and the four companies of dragoons which were led by Sir\r\nThomas Livingston, he posted 200 of Lord Reay’s and Balnagowan’s\r\nHighlanders, having previously dismissed Grant’s men, whom he had\r\ninformed their chief he would leave behind to protect their own\r\ncountry from Dundee’s stragglers.\r\n\r\nThere were three ways by which Mackay could retreat,--either towards\r\nInverness, or through Strathdown and Glenlivet, a movement which\r\nwould bring him near his expected reinforcements, or down Strathspey.\r\nOf these routes Mackay would have preferred the southern; but as the\r\npopulation of Strathdown and Glenlivet was Catholic, and of course\r\nhostile to him, and as the ground in those districts was unfavourable\r\nto the operations of cavalry in case of attack, he resolved to\r\nmarch down Strathspey. But as he was desirous to conceal his route\r\nfrom Dundee, he did not begin his march till nightfall, at which\r\ntime Dundee was within three miles of his camp. In his course down\r\nSpeyside he passed by the house of Grant of Ballindalloch, who was\r\nserving under Dundee, and arrived early the following morning at\r\nBalveny, where he halted to refresh his men and procure a supply\r\nof provisions. There he met Sir George Gordon of Edinglassie, from\r\nwhom he obtained some men to act as intelligencers. Some of these he\r\ndespatched back in the direction he had come, to ascertain if Dundee\r\nstill remained in the Strath; but apprehensive that Dundee would take\r\na southerly course, by crossing the Strath, with the view of throwing\r\nhimself between Mackay and his reinforcements, he sent off others in\r\nthat direction. These scouts soon returned with intelligence that\r\nDundee was still in Strathspey. This information was satisfactory to\r\nMackay, and relieved him from a state of the most painful anxiety;\r\nbut he was still greatly perplexed by the want of provisions, which,\r\nthough hourly expected, had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nDesirous, however, to wait for supplies as long as consistent with\r\nsafety, he again despatched some of Gordon’s men in the direction\r\nhe supposed Dundee would take, and at the same time sent a sergeant\r\nwith a party of 12 dragoons back by the course he had marched, to\r\nbring him notice of Dundee’s motions. Mackay waited with the greatest\r\nimpatience till about five o’clock in the evening for the return of\r\nthe dragoons, without any signs of their appearance, a circumstance\r\nwhich alarmed him so much, that although a quantity of provisions and\r\noats had just reached his camp, he would not allow time for baking\r\nbread or feeding the horses, but gave orders for an immediate march.\r\nAccordingly, the whole party moved off in the same order as before,\r\nand passed a small river about a mile above the place where they had\r\nbeen encamped; but they had scarcely advanced half a mile when Sir\r\nThomas Livingston, who happened to be a little behind, observed the\r\nenemy on the other side of the river they had just passed, marching\r\ntowards the ford by which Mackay’s men had crossed. On being informed\r\nof this, Mackay, after ordering Lieutenant-colonel Livingston, who\r\nwas at the head of the vanguard, to continue at a pretty quick pace;\r\ngalloped to the rear, and having despatched Sir Thomas Livingston to\r\nthe front to lead the party, with instructions to keep up a constant\r\npace, but without wearying the troops, he posted himself upon a\r\nrising ground with about 50 or 60 horse and dragoons in view of\r\nDundee’s army, where he was joined by the Master of Forbes with about\r\n50 horse.\r\n\r\nWhen Dundee observed the party of dragoons drawn up on the hillock\r\nhe immediately halted, drew in his stragglers, and marshalled his\r\nmen into battalions, keeping up the usual distinction of the clans.\r\nIn the meantime Mackay sent off his nephew, Major Mackay, to a hill\r\nwhich lay about a quarter of a mile to his left, from which he\r\ncould obtain a nearer and more correct view of Dundee’s force and\r\nhis motions. The viscount’s horse immediately passed the river, and\r\ndrew up along the bank to protect the passage of the foot, who in\r\ntheir turn also formed till the baggage was brought over. It was now\r\nafter sunset, but the viscount continued to advance. Mackay, who was\r\nnearly two miles behind his rear; thereupon began to ride off with\r\nhis party, but he had not proceeded far when a cry of “halt!” met his\r\nears. On turning round he observed galloping after him, Major Mackay,\r\nwho, having observed a party of horse which he supposed to belong\r\nto Dundee, moving along the face of a hill to the General’s left,\r\nand which from the twilight appeared more numerous than it really\r\nwas, had hastened to acquaint the General of the circumstance. It\r\nturned out, however, that this party which had occasioned such alarm\r\nwas no other than the sergeant with the 12 dragoons of Livingston’s\r\nregiment which had been sent out by Mackay in the morning to\r\nreconnoitre. It was afterwards ascertained that this sergeant was\r\nconcerned in the plot, and that he was the same individual in blue,\r\nwhom Captain Forbes had met with within a mile of Dundee’s camp. This\r\nman pretended, however, that he had run great danger of capture;\r\nand that he had taken such a round-about way merely to avoid the\r\nenemy, though he and his party had been with Dundee the whole day,\r\nand had conducted him over the ground which Mackay had passed on the\r\npreceding day. The government forces continued their march all night\r\ntill they crossed the river of Bogie, where, from pure exhaustion,\r\nthey halted at four o’clock in the morning. The General then ordered\r\nthe provisions which had reached the camp previous to his retreat,\r\nto be distributed among his troops, and desired the horsemen to\r\nlead their horses into an adjoining corn-field and feed them. When\r\nthe men were refreshing themselves Mackay received the agreeable\r\nintelligence that Barclay and Leslie’s regiments would join him that\r\nday, but “to play sure game,” as he himself says, after allowing his\r\nmen two hours’ rest, he marched three miles further down towards his\r\nsuccours, and took up a position at the foot of Suy-hill upon the\r\ncommon road from the south to the north, by which he expected the two\r\nregiments would march.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Hugh Mackay of Scourie.]\r\n\r\nHaving sent a pressing order to Barclay and Leslie to hasten their\r\nmarch, Mackay had the satisfaction of being joined by the former at\r\ntwelve o’clock noon, and by the latter at six o’clock in the evening,\r\nafter a long and fatiguing march. Resolved that no time should be\r\nlost in turning the chase upon Dundee before he should be aware of\r\nthese reinforcements, Mackay put his army in marching order, and\r\nadvanced towards him after ten o’clock at night. But his designs were\r\nmade known to Dundee by two dragoons who had been despatched by their\r\nofficers. These men, on the departure of Dundee, were discovered in\r\na wood, and the general being satisfied that the sergeant before\r\nmentioned had had a conference with Dundee, and the two dragoons\r\nhaving confessed nearly as much themselves, he immediately put\r\nLieutenant-colonel Livingston and the other suspected officers under\r\narrest. He thereupon continued his march, and arrived at Balveny\r\nthat night; and on the following day reached Colmnakill, which he\r\nhad left only five days before. Here having received notice that a\r\nparty of Dundee’s men was on the other side of the adjoining river,\r\nhe sent orders to Sir Thomas Livingston to cross with 200 dragoons\r\nand drive them away; but Sir Thomas having been previously informed\r\nthat the laird of Grant was sorely pressed by the retiring forces of\r\nDundee, had anticipated the general’s orders, and had advanced two\r\nmiles beyond the river with a greater force, in pursuit of a body of\r\nHighlanders. These were, according to Balcarras, Sir John Maclean’s\r\nmen, who were on their way to join Dundee, and who, alarmed at the\r\nappearance of such a large number of dragoons, threw away their\r\nplaids and betook themselves to an adjoining hill, where they formed.\r\nThey are stated by the last-mentioned author to have amounted only\r\nto 200 men, but Mackay, in his memoirs,[562] states the number at\r\n500. Mackay observes, that but for the indiscretion of Livingston’s\r\nadjutant, who by riding a quarter of a mile in advance, gave the\r\nHighlanders timeous notice of the approach of the dragoons, not one\r\nof them would have escaped, but being thereby enabled to gain the top\r\nof the hill before the dragoons came up with them, they sustained a\r\nloss of only 80 or 100 men. In this skirmish, a captain of Barclay’s\r\nregiment and six dragoons were killed, and some wounded.\r\n\r\nHaving been joined by Ramsay’s detachment, which during the occupancy\r\nof Strathspey by the hostile armies, had, unknown to Mackay,\r\npenetrated through Athole and Badenoch and reached Inverness, Mackay\r\ncontinued to pursue Dundee into Badenoch; but as the latter retired\r\ninto Lochaber, Mackay gave over the pursuit on learning that Dundee\r\nhad dismissed the greater part of his forces. Mackay, thereupon,\r\nmarched to Inverness with Livingston’s dragoons, Leslie’s foot, and\r\na party of Leven’s and Hastings’ regiments, and 200 Highlanders, and\r\nsent Barclay’s regiment to Strathbogie, and the three Dutch regiments\r\nto Elgin. From Inverness, Mackay despatched an express to the Duke\r\nof Hamilton, urging upon him the necessity of placing “a formidable\r\ngarrison” at Inverlochy, and small ones in other places in the north,\r\nwithout which he considered that it would be utterly impossible to\r\nsubdue the Highlanders, who, on the approach of an army, for which\r\na fortnight’s subsistence could not be found in their mountainous\r\nregions, could easily retire to difficult passes and other places\r\ninaccessible to regular troops. He, therefore, requested that his\r\ngrace and the parliament would consider the matter before the season\r\nwas farther spent, and provide the necessary means for carrying such\r\na design into effect against his arrival in the south, whither he\r\nintended to proceed in a few days.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the south, Mackay despatched 50 horse, as many of\r\nBarclay’s dragoons, and 60 foot, to take possession of the house\r\nof Braemar, into which he intended to place a garrison to keep the\r\nBraemar men in check, and to cover the county of Aberdeen; and he\r\nordered the captain of dragoons, after putting 20 of his men into\r\nthe house, to march forward, without halting, before break of day,\r\nto the house of Inverey, about three miles farther off, for the\r\npurpose of seizing Inverey and some other gentlemen who had lately\r\nbeen with Dundee. But, fortunately for Inverey and his guests,\r\nthe officer trifled off his time in Braemar house, refreshing his\r\nhorses, till the dawn of the morning, and the approach of him and\r\nhis party being perceived, Inverey and his friends escaped in their\r\nshirts to a neighbouring wood. Disappointed of their prey, the party\r\nretired to the house of Braemar, where, after setting their horses\r\nloose to graze, they laid themselves down to repose; but they were\r\nsoon wakened from their slumbers by some firing from a party on a\r\nrock above, which had so alarmed the horses that they were found\r\ngalloping to and fro in the adjoining fields. As soon as the dragoons\r\nhad caught their horses, which they had some difficulty in doing,\r\nthey galloped down the country. The party on the rock was headed by\r\nInverey, who had collected a number of his tenantry for the purpose\r\nof expelling the dragoons from his bounds, and who, on their retreat,\r\nset fire to Braemar house, which was consumed.\r\n\r\nThe party of foot, which, having charge of a convoy of provisions and\r\nammunition for the intended garrison, had not yet arrived, on hearing\r\nof the retreat of the dragoons, shut themselves up in a gentleman’s\r\nhouse, to secure themselves from attack, and the commanding officer\r\nsent an express after Mackay, who was then on his way to the south,\r\nacquainting him with the failure of the enterprise. On receiving\r\nthis intelligence, Mackay, although he had not a day’s bread on hand,\r\nand was in great haste to reach Edinburgh, “to put life in the design\r\nof Inverlochy,” turned off his course and crossed the hills towards\r\nBraemar, with his foot, after giving directions to Barclay’s dragoons\r\nto march up Deeside. Finding Braemar house destroyed, and the\r\nvaults of it incapable of holding a garrison, Mackay, after burning\r\nInverey’s house and laying waste all his lands, descended the river\r\nto Abergeldie, where he left a detachment of 72 men as a check upon\r\nthe Farquharsons. And having placed the other troops which he had\r\nbrought from the north in quarters farther down the Dee, he posted\r\noff to Edinburgh, where he arrived in the beginning of July, about\r\na fortnight after the surrender of the castle of Edinburgh, which\r\ncapitulated on the 14th of June, after a siege of three months.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Edinburgh, Mackay was exceedingly mortified to\r\nfind that no steps whatever had been taken by the government for\r\nputting his design into execution, of erecting a fort at Inverlochy.\r\nAs the season was now too far advanced to collect materials for\r\nsuch an erection, he proposed that a body of 1,500 pioneers should\r\nbe levied in the northern counties, each of whom should be obliged\r\nto carry a spade, shovel, or pickaxe, along with him, and that a\r\nmonth’s provisions of meal, with horses to carry it, should be\r\nfurnished, along with a force of 400 men. But this plan, the general\r\nhimself confesses, “considering the inability, ignorance, and little\r\nforwardness of the government to furnish the necessary ingredients\r\nfor the advance of their service, was built upon a sandy foundation,\r\nand much like the building of castles in the air.”[563] As an\r\ninstance of the slowness and irresolution of government, Mackay\r\nmentions, that after his return from the north, they took three weeks\r\nto deliberate upon the mode of conveying a fortnight’s provisions for\r\n400 men; by which delay he says he lost the opportunity of preventing\r\nDundee from occupying Athole, Badenoch, and other parts of the\r\nsouthern Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe return of Mackay to the capital, after a fruitless and\r\nexceedingly harassing series of marches and countermarches,\r\nseems to have abated the ardour of some of the supporters of the\r\ngovernment, who, disappointed in their expectations, and displeased\r\nat the preference shown by the court to others they considered less\r\ndeserving than themselves, had become either indifferent about the\r\nresult of the struggle, or secretly wished for a restoration. That\r\nsuch an event might occur was indeed far from improbable. James was\r\nalready in possession, with the exception of two cities, of all\r\nIreland, and William was by no means popular in England. To give,\r\ntherefore, a decided and favourable turn to James’s affairs in\r\nScotland, nothing was wanting but to aid Dundee immediately with a\r\nfew thousand men from Ireland; but although the necessity of such\r\na step was urged by Dundee in his communications with the exiled\r\nmonarch, the latter did not, unfortunately for himself, consider the\r\nmatter in the same light. The expectation of such a reinforcement,\r\nwhich they confidently looked for, had, however, its due effect\r\nupon the minds of the Highlanders, who gladly endured during the\r\nrecent campaign all those painful privations which necessarily\r\nattend an army scantily provided with the means of subsistence.\r\nNo man was better fitted by nature than Dundee for command under\r\nsuch difficulties, and at the head of such troops. Whilst by his\r\nopenness, frankness, and disinterestedness he acquired an ascendency\r\nover the minds of the chiefs, he was equally successful by attending\r\npersonally to their wants, by mixing frequently among them, and by\r\nsharing their privations and fatigues, in securing the obedience of\r\nthe clans. But valuable and important as the services were of such\r\na bold and devoted band, it was evident that without a sudden and\r\npowerful diversion from Ireland, or a considerable rising in the\r\nlowlands, it would be impossible for Dundee, from the paucity of his\r\nforces, and the want of cavalry, to carry the war into the south with\r\nany possible chance of success.\r\n\r\nAs the Irish reinforcements were daily expected, Dundee enjoined\r\nthe chiefs of the clans, who, with their men, had taken a temporary\r\nleave of absence on the departure of Mackay, to rejoin him as soon as\r\npossible, and from his head-quarters at Moy, in Lochaber, he sent\r\nexpresses to the other chiefs who had not yet joined him to hasten to\r\nthe approaching muster.[564]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he despatched a letter to the Earl of Melfort, in\r\nwhich, after adverting to various circumstances, he advises him to\r\nsend over from Ireland a body of 5,000 or 6,000 men to Inverlochy,\r\nwhich he considered the safest landing-place that could be selected\r\nas being “far from the enemy,” and whence an easy entrance could be\r\nobtained for an army into Moray, Angus, or Perthshire. On the return\r\nof the transports from Inverlochy, Dundee advised Melfort to send\r\nover as many foot as he conveniently could to the point of Cantyre,\r\non hearing of whose landing he would advance as far as the neck of\r\nTarbert to meet them, and that on the junction taking place, Dundee\r\nwould march “to raise the country,” and afterwards proceed to the\r\npasses of the Forth to meet the king, who, it was supposed, would\r\nfollow the expedition. To deceive Mackay and the Scottish council,\r\nand to induce them to withdraw their forces from the north, and thus\r\nleave him at greater liberty to organize it, Dundee industriously\r\ncirculated a report that the forces from Ireland would land\r\naltogether in some quarter south of the Clyde. To give an appearance\r\nof certainty to the rumour, he wrote a letter to Lady Errol, a warm\r\nsupporter of James’s interest, acquainting her of the expected\r\nlanding in the west, and to prevent suspicion of any _ruse_ being\r\nintended, he inclosed some proclamations, which, it is presumed, he\r\nintended to issue when the Irish arrived. As wished and anticipated,\r\nthis despatch was intercepted and sent to Edinburgh. The device\r\nappears to have in part succeeded, as Dundee informs Melfort, that\r\nthe government forces were afterwards withdrawn from Cantyre.[579]\r\n\r\nWhilst Dundee was thus maturing his plans, preparatory to another\r\ncampaign, Mackay was urging the privy council to supply him with a\r\nsufficient force, for carrying into effect his favourite plan of\r\nerecting a strong fortification at Inverlochy. This leads to the\r\nsupposition that “the General,” a term by which Mackay distinguishes\r\nhimself in his memoirs, had not taken the bait which had been\r\nprepared for him by his artful rival, for it is improbable, had\r\nMackay believed the story invented by Dundee, that he would have\r\ninsisted on carrying such a large force as 4,000 men, the number\r\nhe required, into Lochaber, so very remote from the scene of the\r\nthreatened invasion.\r\n\r\nHaving collected his forces, Mackay made the necessary preparations\r\nfor his departure, but he was detained nearly a fortnight in\r\nEdinburgh, beyond the time he had fixed for his march, by the delays\r\nof the government, in furnishing meal for his troops, and horses for\r\ntransporting it. In the meantime he was informed by Lord Murray,\r\neldest son of the Marquis of Athole, that Stewart of Ballochin, his\r\nfather’s chamberlain, and other gentlemen of the county of Angus,\r\nhad taken possession of the castle of Blair Athole, belonging to\r\nthe Marquis, and were fortifying it for behoof of King James. Lord\r\nMurray offered to go immediately to Athole, and do everything in his\r\npower to obtain possession of the castle of Blair, before Dundee\r\nshould arrive. As Lord Murray’s wife was known to be very zealous for\r\nthe presbyterian interest, and as his lordship and the Marquis his\r\nfather, who was secretly hostile to the government, were at variance,\r\nMackay gave a ready assent to the proposal, and pressed his lordship\r\neagerly to depart for Athole without loss of time, informing him that\r\nall he required from him, was to prevent the Athole-men from joining\r\nDundee.[584]\r\n\r\nLord Murray accordingly proceeded to Athole, where he arrived about\r\nthe beginning of July, and lost no time in summoning his father’s\r\nvassals to meet him. About 1,200 of them assembled, but no entreaties\r\ncould induce them to declare in favour of the government, nor could a\r\ndistinct pledge be obtained from them to observe a neutrality during\r\nthe impending contest. His lordship was equally unsuccessful in an\r\napplication which he made to Stewart of Ballochin, for delivery of\r\nBlair castle; Stewart telling him that he held the castle for behoof\r\nof King James, by order of his lieutenant-general. The failure of\r\nLord Murray’s mission could certainly occasion no disappointment, as\r\nit was not to be imagined that a body of men who had all along been\r\ndistinguished for their attachment to the exiled family, were, at the\r\ncall of a young man, who by marriage, and the disagreement with his\r\nfather, may be supposed to have made himself obnoxious to the men of\r\nAthole, all at once to abandon long-cherished ideas and to arm in\r\nsupport of a cause in which they felt no interest.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of Lord Murray’s arrival in Athole, intelligence was\r\nbrought to Dundee that a body of 500 Irish troops, under an officer\r\nof the name of Cannon, had reached Mull. The viscount immediately\r\nproceeded to Inverlochy to give orders respecting their landing,\r\nbut, although they all reached the mainland in perfect safety, the\r\nships which carried their provisions being unnecessarily detained\r\nat Mull, were all captured by some English frigates which were\r\ncruizing amongst the western islands. The loss of their stores was\r\na serious evil; and it embittered the disappointment felt by Dundee\r\nand the chiefs, to find that instead of an efficient force of 5,000\r\nor 6,000 men, as they had been led to expect, not more than a tenth\r\npart had been sent, and even this paltry force was neither properly\r\ndisciplined, nor sufficiently armed; so that, according to Balcarras,\r\ntheir arrival did “more harm than good.” Such also was the opinion of\r\nMackay at the time, as expressed in a letter to Lord Melville.[585]\r\n\r\nHaving given the necessary orders for bringing up the Irish troops,\r\nDundee returned to Strowan, where he had fixed his head quarters.\r\nHere he received a letter which had arrived during his absence\r\nat Inverlochy, from Lord Strathnaver, eldest son of the Earl of\r\nSutherland, couched in very friendly terms, and advising him to\r\nfollow the example of the Duke of Gordon, as the course he was\r\nfollowing, if persisted in, would lead inevitably to his ruin.\r\nBut Dundee was not the man who would allow his personal interest\r\nto interfere with the allegiance which he considered he owed to\r\nhis exiled sovereign, and while in his answer he expressed a deep\r\nsense of the obligation he lay under to his lordship for his advice\r\nand offers of service, which he imputed to his lordship’s “sincere\r\ngoodness and concern” for him and his family, he assured him that\r\nhe (Dundee) had no less concern for him, and that he had been even\r\nthinking of making a proposal to him, but delayed doing so till his\r\nlordship should see things in a clearer point of view.\r\n\r\nAt Strowan, Dundee was made acquainted by Stewart of Ballochin, with\r\nLord Murray’s proceedings, and with a demand made by his lordship\r\nfor possession of Blair castle, a demand to which Ballochin had\r\ngiven the most decided refusal. The possession of this place was\r\nof vast importance to Dundee, as it commanded the entrance into\r\nthe southern Highlands, and lay in the line of Mackay’s intended\r\nroute to Inverlochy. To reward his fidelity, and to counteract Lord\r\nMurray’s influence in Athole, Dundee sent a commission to Ballochin,\r\nappointing him colonel of the Athole-men. The appointment, however,\r\nwould probably have been conferred on Lord Murray, to whom Dundee\r\nhad, on the 19th of July, two days before the date of Ballochin’s\r\ncommission, despatched a letter, stating the happiness which he\r\nfelt on hearing that his lordship had appointed a rendezvous of\r\nthe Athole-men at Blair, and expressing a hope that he would join\r\nthe viscount with his men; but, instead of answering this letter,\r\nhis lordship sent it to Lord Melville, the secretary of state for\r\nScotland. Such also was the fate of other letters, which Dundee\r\nsent to Lord Murray. Along with the last, which was written on the\r\n25th of July, Dundee despatched Major Graham and Captain Ramsay for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining a personal interview with Lord Murray;\r\nbut he declined to see them, or to give any answer to Dundee’s\r\ncommunication. It appears that up to this time the Athole-men, who\r\nhad, at the call of the son of their chief, assembled to the number\r\nof about 1,200, were ignorant of Lord Murray’s intentions; but\r\nwhen he refused to receive Dundee’s officers, they at once began\r\nto suspect his designs, and demanded with one voice an immediate\r\nexplanation, intimating at the same time, that if he would join\r\nDundee they would follow him to a man; but if on the contrary he\r\nrefused, they would all leave him. His lordship remonstrated with\r\nthem, and even threatened them with his vengeance if they abandoned\r\nhim; but regardless of his threats, they left him to join Dundee,\r\nhaving previously filled their bonnets with water from the rivulet of\r\nBanovy, in the neighbourhood of Blair castle, and pledged themselves\r\nto King James by drinking his health.[586]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the government general was busily engaged at\r\nEdinburgh, making the necessary preparations for his march. He\r\nappointed his troops to rendezvous at Perth, and after completing\r\nhis arrangements at Edinburgh, he went to Stirling to inspect the\r\ncastle, so as to make himself acquainted with its means of defence.\r\nIn a letter[587] dated 24th July, written to Lord Melville on his\r\narrival at Stirling, Mackay alludes to the distracted state of the\r\ngovernment in Scotland, and the difficulty he would experience in\r\nexecuting the commission which the king had given him, to keep the\r\nkingdom peaceable, in consequence of the divisions which existed\r\neven between the adherents of the government. The removal from\r\noffice of Stair the president of the court of session, and his son,\r\nwho had rendered themselves obnoxious to the ultra whig party, by\r\ntheir attempts to stretch the royal prerogative too far, appears to\r\nhave been considered by that party of more importance than keeping\r\nDundee in check. So high did the spirit of party run, that the Earl\r\nof Annandale and Lord Ross, who had just been appointed colonels\r\nof two newly raised regiments of horse, refused to accompany their\r\nregiments, and offered to resign their commissions rather than quit\r\nthe parliament. This state of matters was highly favourable to\r\nJames’s interests in Scotland, and if Melfort had followed Dundee’s\r\nadvice, by sending over a large force from Ireland, the cause of\r\nhis royal master might have triumphed, but with that fatality which\r\nattended the unfortunate monarch in all his undertakings, he allowed\r\nto slip away the golden opportunity which was here offered him, of\r\nrecovering his crown.\r\n\r\nFrom Stirling Mackay proceeded to Perth, after ordering the troops\r\nof horse and dragoons of the expedition to follow him. On arriving\r\nat Perth, a letter was shown him from Lord Murray, from which he\r\nlearned, that Dundee, who had been solicited by Stewart of Ballochin\r\nto hasten into Athole, was already marching through Badenoch, and\r\nso anxious was he to anticipate Mackay’s arrival in Athole, that he\r\nhad left behind him several chiefs and their men, whose junction he\r\ndaily expected. Lord Murray added, that if Mackay did not hasten his\r\nmarch so as to reach Athole before Dundee, he would not undertake\r\nto prevent his men from joining the viscount. As Mackay informs us,\r\nthat before leaving Edinburgh he had begun “already to have very ill\r\nthoughts of the expedition in gross,” and as on reaching Stirling,\r\nthe idea that he would be straitened for provisions haunted his mind,\r\nthis information was assuredly by no means calculated to relieve\r\nthese fearful apprehensions. He had gone too far, however, to retrace\r\nhis steps with honour, and although four troops of dragoons and\r\ntwo of horse had not yet joined him, he resolved, for reasons that\r\nto him, in the position in which he was then placed, seemed most\r\nforcible, to proceed immediately on his march to Athole.\r\n\r\nThe last and perhaps most important reason given by himself for this\r\nstep, is that, as the possession, by Mackay, of the castle of Blair,\r\nwas in his opinion the only means of keeping in awe the Athole-men,\r\n(who, from their numbers and strict attachment to the house of\r\nStewart, were more to be dreaded than any other body of Highlanders,)\r\nand preventing them from joining Dundee, he had no alternative but to\r\nallow Dundee to roam uncontrolled through the disaffected district of\r\nAthole, gathering strength at every step, or to attempt to gain the\r\nimportant fortress of Blair.\r\n\r\nSuch were the grounds, as stated by Mackay in his own exculpation,\r\nwhich made him resolve upon marching into Athole, and which, he\r\nobserves, “more capable commanders might readily be deceived in.”\r\nThose who make the unfortunate result of this movement the rule of\r\ntheir judgment, will be apt to condemn Mackay’s conduct on this\r\noccasion as rash and injudicious, but when his own reasons are duly\r\nweighed, it is difficult to see how he could have acted otherwise\r\nthan he did. There can be no doubt, that had he been as successful\r\nat Killiecrankie as he was unfortunate, he would have been applauded\r\nfor the exercise of a sound discretion, and regarded as a tactician\r\nof the highest order.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July, Mackay left Perth at the head of an army of\r\n4,500 men. Of this force, notwithstanding that the four troops of\r\ndragoons and two of horse already alluded to, had not yet arrived,\r\na fair proportion consisted of cavalry. At night Mackay encamped\r\nopposite to Dunkeld, and here, at midnight, he received an express\r\nfrom Lord Murray announcing the alarming intelligence, that Dundee\r\nhad entered Athole, in consequence of which event he informed him\r\nthat he had retreated from before the castle of Blair, which he had\r\nfor some time partially blockaded; and that although he had left the\r\nnarrow and difficult pass of Killiecrankie between him and Dundee, he\r\nhad posted a guard at the further extremity to secure a free passage\r\nto Mackay’s troops through the pass which he supposed Dundee had\r\nalready reached. Mackay seems to have doubted the latter part of this\r\nstatement, and his suspicions were in some degree confirmed by the\r\nfact, that Lieutenant-colonel Lauder, whom he despatched with a party\r\nimmediately on receipt of Murray’s letter, to secure the entrance\r\ninto the pass from the vale of Blair, did not see a single man on his\r\narrival there.\r\n\r\nDiscouraging as this intelligence was, Mackay still determined to\r\npersevere in his march, and having despatched orders to Perth to\r\nhasten the arrival of the six troops of cavalry he had left behind,\r\nhe put his army in motion next morning, July 27th, at day-break, and\r\nproceeded in the direction of the pass, the entrance to which he\r\nreached at ten o’clock in the morning. Here he halted, and allowed\r\nhis men two hours to rest and refresh themselves before they entered\r\nupon the bold and hazardous enterprise of plunging themselves into\r\na frightful chasm, out of which they might possibly never return.\r\nTo support Lauder in case of attack, the general, on halting,\r\ndespatched through the pass a body of 200 men under the command of\r\nthe Lieutenant-colonel of the Earl of Leven’s regiment, whom he\r\ninstructed to send him any intelligence he could obtain of Dundee’s\r\nmotions. A short way below the pass Mackay fell in with Lord Murray,\r\nwho informed him, that with the exception of 200 or 300 men, who\r\nstill remained with him, the whole had gone to the hills to secure\r\ntheir cattle, an answer which Mackay, with the open and unsuspecting\r\ngenerosity of a soldier, considered satisfactory, and made him, as he\r\nobserves, “not so apt to judge so ill of Murray as others did.”\r\n\r\nHaving received a notice from Lauder that the pass was clear, and\r\nthat there was no appearance of Dundee, Mackay put his army again\r\nin motion, and entered the fatal pass. Hastings’s regiment (now\r\nthe 13th), and Annandale’s horse were placed behind to protect the\r\nbaggage, from an apprehension that Dundee’s Highlanders might make a\r\ndetour round the hill to attack it, or that the country people might\r\nattempt to plunder it if not so guarded. The idea that no opposition\r\nwould be offered to their passage through this terrific defile,\r\nwhich seemed to forbid approach, and to warn the unhappy soldier of\r\nthe dangers which awaited him should he precipitate himself into\r\nits recesses, may have afforded some consolation to the feelings of\r\nMackay’s troops as they entered this den of desolation; but when\r\nthey found themselves fairly within its gorge, their imaginations\r\nmust have been appalled as they gazed, at every successive step,\r\non the wild and terrific objects which encompassed them on every\r\nside. They however proceeded, at the command of their general, on\r\ntheir devious course, and finally cleared it, with the loss of only\r\na single horseman, who, according to an Athole tradition, was shot\r\nby an intrepid adventurer, named Ian Ban Beg MacRan, who had posted\r\nhimself on a hill, from which he fired across the rivulet of the\r\nGarry and brought down his victim. A well, called in Gaelic, _Fuaran\r\nu trupar_,--_Anglicé_, the “Horseman’s well,”--is shown as the place\r\nwhere the horseman fell.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the five battalions and the troop of horse which preceded\r\nthe baggage had debouched from the further extremity of the pass,\r\nthey halted, by command of the general, upon a corn field, along\r\nthe side of the river to await the arrival of the baggage, and of\r\nHastings’s regiment and the other troop of horse. Mackay then\r\nordered Lieutenant-colonel Lauder to advance with his 200 fusileers\r\nand a troop of horse in the direction he supposed Dundee might be\r\nexpected to appear. Lauder had not advanced far when he discovered\r\nsome parties of Dundee’s forces between him and Blair. Being\r\nimmediately apprised of this by Lauder, Mackay, after giving orders\r\nto Colonel Balfour to supply the troops with ammunition, and to put\r\nthem under arms without delay, galloped off to the ground, from which\r\nLauder had espied the enemy, to observe their motions before making\r\nchoice of the field of battle. On arriving at the advanced post,\r\nMackay observed several small parties of troops, scarcely a mile\r\ndistant, marching slowly along the foot of a hill in the direction\r\nof Blair, and advancing towards him. Mackay, thereupon, sent orders\r\nto Balfour to advance immediately up to him with the foot. But these\r\norders were no sooner despatched than he observed some bodies of\r\nDundee’s forces marching down a high hill within a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the place where he stood, in consequence of which movement, he\r\nimmediately galloped back to his men to countermand the order he had\r\njust issued, and to put his army in order of battle.[588]\r\n\r\nDundee, who had been duly advertised of Mackay’s motions, had\r\ndescended from the higher district of Badenoch into Athole on\r\nthe previous day, with a force of about 2,500 men, of whom about\r\none-fifth part consisted of the Irish, which had lately landed at\r\nInverlochy under Brigadier Cannon. Some of the clans which were\r\nexpected had not yet joined, as the day appointed for the general\r\nrendezvous had not then arrived; but as Dundee considered it of\r\nparamount importance to prevent Mackay from establishing himself in\r\nAthole, he did not hesitate to meet the latter, whose force numbered\r\nabout 4,000.[589]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at the castle of Blair, intelligence was brought\r\nDundee that Mackay had reached the pass of Killiecrankie, which he\r\nwas preparing to enter. Dundee, against the advice of most of his\r\nofficers, resolved to allow Mackay to enter the pass undisputed. He\r\nappealed to the feelings of the Highlanders, whose ancestors, he\r\nsaid, acting upon their national maxim never to attack a foe who\r\ncould not defend himself on equal terms, would have disdained to\r\nadopt the course proposed, (and in saying so he did not, he observed,\r\nmean to insinuate that the persons he addressed had degenerated from\r\nthe honour and courage of their ancestors). One principal reason\r\nstated by Dundee for allowing Mackay to advance through the Pass\r\nunmolested, was the great advantage they would gain by engaging him\r\non open ground before he should be joined by his English dragoons,\r\nwho, from their being so formidable to the Highlanders, would, if\r\nallowed by him to come up, more than compensate for any accession\r\nof force which Dundee might receive.[590] Another reason not less\r\nimportant was, that in the event of Mackay sustaining a defeat, his\r\narmy would probably be ruined, as he could not retreat back through\r\nthe Pass without the risk of evident destruction, whereas should\r\nthe Highlanders suffer a defeat, they could easily retreat to the\r\nmountains. He added, that in anticipation of Mackay’s defeat, he had\r\nalready given orders to his friends in the neighbourhood, to cut off\r\nthe few remaining stragglers that might attempt to escape.[591]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KILLIECRANKIE.\r\n\r\nA. Fullarton & C^o. London & Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nThe forces which had been descried by Lauder, appear to have been\r\na body of 400 men under the command of Sir John Maclean, whom\r\nDundee, on learning that the advanced guard of Mackay’s army, after\r\ntraversing the pass, had taken up a position near its northern\r\nextremity, had despatched from Blair castle to keep them in check.\r\nBut his scouts having shortly thereafter brought him notice that the\r\nwhole of Mackay’s army was preparing to enter the pass, he resolved\r\nto make a detour with the main body of his army round the hill on\r\nwhich the castle of Lude stands, in the vicinity of the pass, and\r\nfall upon Mackay as soon as he should clear that defile. Having made\r\nhimself acquainted, by inquiries among the most intelligent of the\r\ncountry people, with the localities in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the pass, and of the suitableness of the ground for the operations\r\nof such a force as his, he advanced at double-quick time from Blair\r\nalong the present line of road, and on arriving at the river Tilt,\r\nturned off to the left round the back of the hill, and crossed that\r\nriver near its confluence with the rivulet of Ald-Chluan. This\r\nmovement will account for the sudden and unexpected appearance of\r\nDundee on the face of the high hill on Mackay’s right.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the ground on which Mackay had halted his troops is\r\nan eminence, the access to which is steep and difficult, and covered\r\nwith trees and shrubs. Alarmed lest Dundee should obtain possession\r\nof this eminence--which being within a carabine shot from the place\r\non which Mackay stood, would give him such a command of the ground as\r\nwould enable him, by means of his fire, to force Mackay to cross the\r\nriver in confusion--he, immediately on his return from the position\r\noccupied by his advanced guard, “made every battalion form by a Quart\r\nde Conversion to the right upon the ground where they stood,”[592]\r\nand then made them march each in succession before him up the hill\r\ntill they reached the eminence, of which they took possession. Within\r\na musket shot of this ground is another eminence immediately above\r\nthe house of Urrard, which Dundee had reached before Mackay had\r\ncompleted his ascent, and on which he halted.\r\n\r\nAt this conjuncture, neither Hastings’s regiment nor Annandale’s\r\ntroop of horse had yet come out of the pass, but Mackay,\r\nnevertheless, at once proceeded to arrange his men in fighting\r\norder on a plain between the edge of the eminence and the foot or\r\ncommencement of the ascent to Dundee’s position, which, from its\r\nextent, enabled him to form his men in one line along the eminence.\r\nIn making his dispositions, Mackay divided every battalion into two\r\nparts, and as he meant to fight three deep, he left a small distance\r\nbetween each of these sub-battalions. In the centre of his line,\r\nhowever, he left a greater interval of space, behind which he placed\r\nthe two troops of horse, with the design, when the Highlanders, after\r\nthe fire of the line had been spent, should approach, to draw them\r\noff by this larger interval, and flank the Highlanders on either\r\nside, as occasion should offer. Mackay assigns as his reason for\r\nplacing his cavalry in his rear till the fire should be exhausted\r\non both sides, a dread he entertained of exposing them to Dundee’s\r\nhorse, with whom it could not be supposed that these newly-raised\r\nlevies could cope. Hastings’s regiment, which arrived after Mackay\r\nhad taken up his ground, was placed on the right; and, for greater\r\nsecurity, there was added to it a detachment of firelocks from each\r\nbattalion. On the extreme left on a hillock covered with trees,\r\nLieutenant-colonel Lauder was posted, with his party of 200 men,\r\ncomposed of the _elite_ of the army. Mackay having been recognised by\r\nDundee’s men busily employed riding along his line, from battalion to\r\nbattalion, giving orders, was selected by some of them for a little\r\nball practice; but although “their popping shot,” which wounded some\r\nof his men, fell around him wherever he moved, he escaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nAfter his line had been fully formed, Mackay rode along the front,\r\nfrom the left wing, which he committed to the charge of Brigadier\r\nBalfour, to the right, and having ascertained that every thing was in\r\nreadiness to receive the enemy, he addressed the battalions nearest\r\nhim in a short speech. He requested them to reflect that their own\r\npersonal safety was involved in the issue of that day’s contest; and\r\nassured them that if they maintained their ground, and kept firmly\r\nand closely united together, their assailants would quickly flee\r\nbefore them for refuge to the hills--that the reason for which the\r\nHighlanders stript themselves almost naked before battle was rather\r\nto enable them to escape, than from any hopes they entertained of\r\npursuing their foes. Should, however, his men unfortunately give way\r\nbefore the rabble of Highlanders whom they saw marshalled on the\r\nadjoining heights--an event which he by no means expected--there\r\nwas an absolute certainty, as these naked mountaineers were more\r\nnimble-footed than they were, and as all the Athole-men were in arms,\r\nready to take advantage of their defeat, that few or none of them\r\nwould escape with their lives. In conclusion, he warned them that\r\nthe only way to avoid ruin was to stand firm to their posts, and,\r\nlike brave men, to fight to the last in defence of their religion and\r\nliberties, against the invaders of both, to secure which, and not the\r\ndesire of a crown, was the sole reason which had induced his majesty\r\nto send them on the present service.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mackay was thus occupied on the lower platform, his gallant\r\nrival was equally busy flying about on the eminence above, ranging\r\nhis men in battle array. He was particularly distinguished amongst\r\nhis officers by a favourite dun-coloured horse which he rode, and\r\nby his plated armour, which glittered in the sun-beams. Dundee, who\r\nhad arrived upon the higher platform about the same time that Mackay\r\nhad gained the ground he now occupied, ranged his men in one line in\r\nthe following order:--On the right, he placed Sir John Maclean, with\r\nhis regiment divided into two battalions. On the left, he posted the\r\nregiment of Sir Donald Macdonald, commanded by the young chief and\r\nSir George Barclay, and a battalion under Sir Alexander Maclean. In\r\nthe centre were placed four battalions, consisting of the Camerons,\r\nthe Macdonells of Glengary and Clanranald, and the Irish regiment,\r\nwith a troop of horse under the command of Sir William Wallace,\r\nwho had early that morning produced a commission, to the great\r\ndispleasure of the Earl of Dunfermline and other officers, appointing\r\nhim colonel of a horse regiment which the earl commanded.[593] It\r\nmay be observed, that neither Mackay nor Dundee placed any body of\r\nreserve behind their lines.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of Mackay’s line, which reached considerably beyond\r\nDundee’s wings,[594] compelled the latter, to prevent the danger of\r\nbeing outflanked, to enlarge the intervals between his battalions.\r\nA general movement from right to left accordingly took place along\r\nDundee’s line. Before Dundee’s left halted, Mackay, imagining that\r\nthe object of the movement in that quarter was to get between him\r\nand the pass, for the purpose of cutting off all communication\r\nbetween him and Perth, made his line make a corresponding movement to\r\nhis right, but on observing that Dundee’s left wing halted, Mackay\r\nbrought his line to a stand. These different movements necessarily\r\noccupied a considerable time, and both armies being now finally\r\narranged, they gazed upon each other with great composure for the\r\nspace of two whole hours.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval of care and anxious suspense, the feelings of\r\nboth parties--their hopes or their fears--would probably be tinctured\r\nby a deeper hue of confidence or despondency as they reflected on\r\nthe events of former days. Though more than forty years had elapsed\r\nsince the brilliant achievements of Montrose, the Highlanders,[595]\r\nnaturally brave, had lost none of their military ardour, and the\r\ndescendants of the heroes of Tippermuir, Aldearn, and Kilsyth, who\r\nnow stood in battle array on the upper plain, whence, with a scowl\r\nof scorn and defiance, they looked down upon the _Sassenachs_ below,\r\ncalling to mind the recital of the heroic deeds of their fathers,\r\nto which they had listened with wonder and enthusiasm in their\r\nchildhood, would burn for the moment when, at the command of their\r\nchief, they should measure their broad swords with the bayonets of\r\ntheir Lowland foes. On the other hand, Mackay’s men had no such\r\nrecollections to inspire confidence or to cheer them in their\r\nperilous enterprise, and when they beheld the Highland host ready at\r\na moment’s notice to burst like a mountain torrent upon their devoted\r\nheads, and called to mind the tales they had heard of the warlike\r\nprowess of the Highlanders, they could not but recoil at the idea of\r\nencountering, in deadly strife, such determined antagonists. There\r\nwere, it is true, many men in Mackay’s army to whom the dangers of\r\nthe battle field were familiar, and in whose minds such reflections\r\nwould doubtless find no place, but the great majority of his troops\r\nconsisted of newly raised levies, who had never before seen the face\r\nof an enemy.\r\n\r\nMackay himself, though an old and experienced officer, and a brave\r\nman, was not without his misgivings; and as the evening advanced\r\nwithout any movement on the part of Dundee to commence the action,\r\nhis uneasiness increased. Nor were his apprehensions likely to be\r\nallayed by the reply made by the second son of Lochiel, who held a\r\ncommission in his own regiment of Scots fusileers, in answer to a\r\nquestion put to him by Mackay. “Here is your father with his wild\r\nsavages,” said Mackay to the young man, on seeing the standard of\r\nthe Camerons, putting on at the same moment an air of confidence,\r\n“how would you like to be with him?” “It signifies little,” answered\r\nthe son of the chief, “what I would like, but I recommend to you\r\nto be prepared; or perhaps my father and his wild savages may be\r\nnearer to you before night than you would like.”[596] The apparent\r\nirresolution of the Highlanders to begin the battle was considered by\r\nMackay as intentional, and he supposed that their design was to wait\r\ntill nightfall, when, by descending suddenly from their position,\r\nand setting up a loud shout, according to their usual custom, they\r\nexpected to frighten his men, unaccustomed to an enemy, and put them\r\nin disorder. As Mackay could not, without the utmost danger, advance\r\nup the hill and commence the action, and as the risk was equally\r\ngreat should he attempt to retreat down the hill and cross the river,\r\nhe resolved, at all hazards, to remain in his position, “though with\r\nimpatience,” as he observes, till Dundee should either attack him or\r\nretire, which he had better opportunities of doing than Mackay had.\r\nTo provoke the Highlanders, and to induce them to engage, he ordered\r\nthree small leather field pieces to be discharged, but they proved of\r\nlittle use, and the carriages being much too high, broke after the\r\nthird firing.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the evening, some of Dundee’s sharpshooters, who\r\nhad kept up, during the day, an occasional fire in the direction in\r\nwhich they observed Mackay moving, by which they had wounded some of\r\nhis men, as already stated, took possession of some houses upon the\r\nascent which lay between the two armies, for the purpose of directing\r\ntheir aim with surer effect. But they were immediately dislodged by\r\na party of musketeers despatched by Mackay’s brother, who commanded\r\nthe general’s regiment, and chased back to their main body with some\r\nloss. This skirmish Mackay supposed would soon draw on a general\r\nengagement, and his expectations were speedily realized.\r\n\r\nIt was within half an hour of sunset, and the moment was at hand,\r\nwhen, at the word of command, the Highlanders and their allies\r\nwere to march down the hill, and with sword in hand, fall upon the\r\ntrembling and devoted host below, whom, like the eagle viewing\r\nhis destined prey from his lofty eyry, they had so long surveyed.\r\nHaving determined, as much to please his men as to gratify his own\r\ninclination, to lead the charge in person, at the head of the horse,\r\nDundee exchanged his red coat, which he had worn during the day,\r\nand by which he had been recognised by Mackay’s troops, for another\r\nof darker colour, to conceal his rank, and thereby avoid the risk\r\nof being singled out by the enemy. Dundee, after the manner of the\r\nancient Greek and Roman generals, is said to have harangued his men\r\nin the following enthusiastic strain:--[597]\r\n\r\n“You are come hither to fight, and that in the best of causes; for it\r\nis the battle of your king, your religion, and your country, against\r\nthe foulest usurpation and rebellion. And having therefore so good\r\na cause in your hands, I doubt not but it will inspire you with an\r\nequal courage to maintain it; for there is no proportion betwixt\r\nloyalty and treason, nor should there be any betwixt the valour of\r\ngood subjects and traitors. Remember that to-day begins the fate\r\nof your king, your religion, and your country. Behave yourselves,\r\ntherefore, like true Scotsmen, and let us by this action redeem\r\nthe credit of this nation, that is laid low by the treacheries and\r\ncowardice of some of our countrymen, in making which request, I ask\r\nnothing of you that I am not now ready to do myself. And if any of us\r\nshall fall upon this occasion, we shall have the honour of dying on\r\nour duty, and as becomes true men of valour and conscience; and such\r\nof us as shall live and win the battle, shall have the reward of a\r\ngracious king and the praise of all good men. In God’s name, then,\r\nlet us go on, and let this be your word--King James and the church of\r\nScotland, which God long preserve!”[598]\r\n\r\nA pause now ensued, and a death-like silence prevailed along the\r\nline, when, on a sudden, it appeared in motion, marching slowly down\r\nthe hill. The Highlanders, who stript themselves to their shirts and\r\ndoublets, advanced, according to their usual practice, with their\r\nbodies bent forward, so as to present as small a surface as possible\r\nto the fire of the enemy, the upper part of their bodies being\r\ncovered by their targets.\r\n\r\nTo discourage the Highlanders in their advance by keeping up a\r\ncontinual fire, Mackay had given instructions to his officers\r\ncommanding battalions, to commence firing by platoons, at the\r\ndistance of a hundred paces. This order was not attended to, as\r\nBalfour’s regiment, and the half of Ramsay’s, did not fire a single\r\nshot, and the other half fired very little. The Highlanders, however,\r\nmet with a very brisk fire from Mackay’s right, and particularly\r\nfrom his own battalion, in which no less than 16 gentlemen of the\r\nMacdonells of Glengarry fell; but, undismayed by danger, they kept\r\nsteadily advancing in the face of the enemy’s fire, of which they\r\nreceived three rounds. Having now come close up to the enemy, they\r\nhalted for a moment, and having levelled and discharged their\r\npistols, which did little execution, they set up a loud shout and\r\nrushed sword in hand upon the enemy, before the latter had time to\r\nscrew on their bayonets to the end of their muskets. The shock was\r\ntoo impetuous to be long resisted by men who, according to their\r\nown general, “behaved, with the exception of Hastings’s and Leven’s\r\nregiment, like the vilest cowards in nature.” But even had these\r\nmen been more stout-hearted, their courage would not have availed\r\nthem, as their arms were insufficient to parry off the tremendous\r\nstrokes of the axes, and the broad and double-edged swords of the\r\nHighlanders, who, with a single blow, either felled their opponents\r\nto the earth or struck off a member from their bodies, and at once\r\ndisabled them. While the work of death was thus going on towards the\r\nright, Dundee, at the head of the horse, made a furious charge on\r\nMackay’s own battalion, and broke through it, on which the English\r\nhorse which were stationed behind, fled without firing a single\r\nshot. Dundee, thereupon, rode off to attack the enemy’s cannon, but\r\nthe officer (Sir William Wallace) who had that morning produced his\r\ncommission as colonel of the horse, appears to have misunderstood\r\nDundee, who, on arriving near the enemy’s cannon, found himself\r\nalone. He, therefore, gave the horse a signal to advance quickly, on\r\nwhich the Earl of Dunfermline, who then served only as a volunteer,\r\noverlooking the affront which had been put upon him, rode out of the\r\nranks, followed by 16 gentlemen, attacked the party who guarded the\r\ncannon, and captured them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mackay perceived that Dundee’s grand point of attack was\r\nnear the centre of his line, he immediately resolved to attack the\r\nHighlanders in flank with the two troops of horse which he had placed\r\nin the rear of his line, for which purpose he ordered Lord Belhaven\r\nto proceed round the left wing with his own troop, and attack them\r\non their right flank; he ordered at the same time the other troop to\r\nproceed in the contrary direction, and assail them on their left.\r\nMackay himself led round Belhaven’s troop, but it was scarcely in\r\nfront of the line when it got into disorder, and instead of obeying\r\nthe orders to wheel for the flank of the enemy, after some confused\r\nfiring it turned upon the right wing of Lord Kenmure’s battalion,\r\nwhich it threw into disorder, and which thereupon began to give way.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment Mackay, who was instantly surrounded by a\r\ncrowd of Highlanders, anxious to disentangle his cavalry, so as to\r\nget them formed, called aloud to them to follow him, and putting\r\nspurs to his horse galloped through the enemy, but with the exception\r\nof one servant whose horse was shot under him, not a single horseman\r\nattempted to follow their general. When he had gone sufficiently\r\nfar to be out of the reach of immediate danger, he turned round to\r\nobserve the state of matters, and to his infinite surprise he found\r\nthat both armies had disappeared. To use his own expression, “in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, in a manner,” his own men as well as the enemy\r\nwere out of sight, having gone down pell-mell to the river where his\r\nbaggage stood. The flight of his men must have been rapid indeed, for\r\nalthough the left wing, which had never been attacked, had begun to\r\nflee before he rode off, the right wing and centre still kept their\r\nground.\r\n\r\nMackay now stood in one of the most extraordinary predicaments in\r\nwhich the commander of an army was ever placed. His whole men had, as\r\nif by some supernatural cause, disappeared almost in an instant of\r\ntime, and he found himself standing a solitary being on the mountain\r\nside, not knowing what to do, or whither to direct his course.\r\nWhether had they had the courage to follow him, the timid troop would\r\nhave turned the tide of victory in his favour, may indeed be well\r\ndoubted; but it is obvious that he adopted the only alternative which\r\ncould render success probable. Judging from the ease with which he\r\ngalloped through the Highlanders, who made way for him, he thinks\r\nthat if he had had but 50 resolute horse such as Colchester’s, he\r\n“had certainly,” as he says, “by all human appearance recovered all,”\r\nfor although his whole line had begun to give way when he ordered the\r\nhorse to follow him, the right of the enemy had not then moved from\r\ntheir ground.[599] While ruminating upon the “sad spectacle” which he\r\nnow beheld, his mind preyed upon by the most gloomy reflections, he\r\nfortunately espied to the right, “a small heap of red coats,” which\r\nhe immediately galloped for, and found it to consist of a part of\r\nthe Earl of Leven’s regiment, mixed with a few stragglers from other\r\nregiments who had escaped from the swords of the Highlanders. The\r\nEarl himself, his Lieutenant-colonel, the Major, and most of the\r\nother officers of the regiment, were with this body. Mackay perceived\r\na part of Hastings’s regiment marching up to the ground it had\r\noccupied at the commencement of the action. Having rode up to this\r\nparty, he was informed by the Colonel that he had left his ground in\r\npursuit of the enemy, a detachment of which had attempted to outflank\r\nhim, but having wheeled to the right upon them with his pikes, they\r\nabandoned the idea of attacking him, and repaired to their main body,\r\nwhich they observed among the baggage at the river-side.\r\n\r\nThe plunder which the baggage offered was too tempting a lure for\r\nthe Highlanders, whose destructive progress it at once arrested. It\r\nwas in fact solely to this thirst for spoil that Mackay and the few\r\nof his men who escaped owed their safety, for had the Highlanders\r\ncontinued the pursuit, it is very probable that not a single\r\nindividual of Mackay’s army would have been left alive to relate\r\ntheir sad disaster.[600]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mackay had got up Hastings’s battalion and joined it to\r\nthat of Leven’s, he despatched his nephew, Captain Mackay,--who,\r\nthough he had received eight broad-sword wounds on his body, was\r\nstill able to ride his horse,--in quest of such of his officers as\r\nmight be within his reach, about the bottom of the hill, with orders\r\nto collect as many of their men as they could, and join the general.\r\n\r\nThis mission was totally unsuccessful, for although he had fallen in\r\nwith several officers, few of them took any notice of him; and all\r\nwho had survived the battle were now scattered far beyond Mackay’s\r\nreach. While receiving this afflicting intelligence, Mackay descried\r\nin the twilight, a large body of men, who appeared to form themselves\r\nalong the edge of a wood on Balfour’s left, where Lieutenant-colonel\r\nLauder had been posted with 200 men. As he was not yet aware of\r\nthe fate of Lauder’s corps, which was among the first that fled, he\r\nsupposed that the body he had observed might either be that party or\r\nanother body of his men who had retired to the wood on the descent of\r\nthe Highlanders, and he therefore rode off to reconnoitre them, after\r\ndirecting his officers to endeavour to put their men in a condition\r\nto fire one discharge, at least, if attacked. Mackay approached the\r\nparty sufficiently near to discover that they were Dundee’s men,\r\nand having turned his horse’s head he walked slowly back, that he\r\nmight not excite the apprehensions of the Highlanders. The ground\r\non which Mackay stood with the wreck of his army, amounting to\r\nscarcely 400 men, was the farthest removed of any other part of the\r\nposition he had selected in the morning, from the point to which\r\nhe was necessarily obliged to direct his retreat, and over the\r\nintervening space he could not but expect to fall in with parties\r\nof the Highlanders, who would fall upon him, and kill or disperse\r\nhis tired followers. But he extricated himself from the difficulties\r\nwhich beset him, with considerable adroitness. He advised them on no\r\naccount to show any inclination to run, as it could not add to their\r\npersonal safety, but, on the contrary, might endanger it the more,\r\nas the Highlanders, observing their terror, would certainly break in\r\namong them, and pursue them with the greater avidity. When about to\r\nretire down the hill the party was joined by Lord Belhaven, and a\r\nfew other horsemen, who proved very serviceable as scouts during the\r\nretreat. Mackay then led his men slowly down the hill, and evaded the\r\nenemy so completely that he did not meet with the least interruption\r\nin his march. He retired across the Garry without molestation, and\r\nmade a short halt to ascertain whether he was pursued. Seeing no\r\ndisposition on the part of the Highlanders to follow him, he began\r\nto think of the best way of retiring out of Athole. All his officers\r\nadvised him to return to Perth through the pass of Killiecrankie, but\r\nhe saw proper to reject this advice, and resolved to march several\r\nmiles up Athole and cross over the hills to Stirling.\r\n\r\nGiving orders, therefore, to his men to march, he proceeded to the\r\nwest along the bank of the river, and had the satisfaction, when\r\nabout two miles from the field of battle, to come up with a party of\r\nabout 150 fugitives almost without arms, under the command of Colonel\r\nRamsay, who was quite at a loss what direction to take. Mackay then\r\ncontinued his march along the edge of a rivulet which falls into the\r\nGarry, till he came to some little houses. Here he obtained from\r\none of the inhabitants, information as to the route he meant to\r\nfollow, and having made himself acquainted, as far as he could, by\r\nan examination of his map, with the situation of the country through\r\nwhich he had to pass, he crossed the stream and proceeded across the\r\nhills towards Weem castle, the seat of the chief of the clan Menzies,\r\nwhose son had been in the action with a company of 100 Highlanders he\r\nhad raised for the service of the government. After a most fatiguing\r\njourney, he reached the castle before morning. Here he obtained some\r\nsleep and refreshment, of which he stood greatly in need, having\r\nsince his departure from Dunkeld, on the morning preceding, marched\r\nabout 40 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pass of Killiecrankie in last century. From an old\r\ncrayon drawing.]\r\n\r\nThe news of Mackay’s defeat had preceded his retreat; and on his\r\nmarch during the following day, he found the country through which he\r\npassed in an uproar, and every person arming in favour of King James.\r\nThe people of Strathtay alarmed at the approach of Mackay’s men, whom\r\nthey took to be Highlanders, and considering their houses and cattle\r\nin danger, set up a dreadful shout, which so frightened Mackay’s men\r\nthat they began to flee back to the hills under an apprehension that\r\nthe Highlanders were at hand. Mackay and some of his officers on\r\nhorseback, by presenting their pistols and threatening the fugitives,\r\nsucceeded in rallying them, but owing to the thickness of the morning\r\nmore than 100 escaped, all of whom were killed, stripped, or taken\r\nprisoners by the country people. Mackay continued his march with very\r\nlittle halting all that day, being Sunday the 28th, and arrived late\r\nat night at Drummond castle, in which he had a garrison. Next day he\r\nreached Stirling with about 400 men.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the battle--for night had thrown its curtain\r\nover the horrors of the scene, before the extent of the carnage\r\ncould be ascertained--the field of battle and the ground between it\r\nand the river, extending as far as the pass, presented an appalling\r\nspectacle in the vast numbers of the dead which strewed the field,\r\nwhose mutilated bodies attested the savage and unrelenting ferocity\r\nwith which Mackay’s men had been hewn down by the Highlanders. Here\r\nmight be seen a skull which had been struck off above the ears by a\r\nstroke from a broad-sword--there a head lying near the trunk from\r\nwhich it had been severed--here an arm or a limb--there a corpse\r\nlaid open from the head to the brisket; while interspersed among\r\nthese lifeless trunks, _dejectaque membra_, were to be seen broken\r\npikes, small swords and muskets, which had been snapt asunder by the\r\nathletic blows of the Lochaber axe and broad-sword.[601]\r\n\r\nIf the importance of a victory is to be reckoned by the comparative\r\nnumbers of the slain, and the brilliant achievements of the victors,\r\nthe battle of Killiecrankie may well stand high in the list of\r\nmilitary exploits. Considering the shortness of the combat, the\r\nloss on the part of Mackay was prodigious. Not less than 2,000\r\nof his men were either killed or captured. Among the slain were\r\nLieutenant-colonel Mackay, brother of the General, Brigadier Balfour,\r\nand several other officers. Highland tradition reports that Balfour\r\nwas cut down by the Reverend Robert Stewart, a Catholic clergyman,\r\nnephew to Stewart of Ballochin, for having contemptuously refused to\r\nreceive quarter when offered him by the priest. The same tradition\r\nrelates that Stewart, who was a powerful muscular man, followed\r\nthe enemy in their flight down to the river, and towards the pass,\r\nwielding a tremendous broad-sword, with which he cut down numbers of\r\nthe fugitives, and so much did he exert himself in the use of his\r\nfatal weapon, that, at the conclusion of the carnage, his hand had\r\nswollen to such an extent, that it could only be extricated from the\r\nbasket-hilt of his sword, by cutting away the net-work.\r\n\r\nBut as the importance of a victory, however splendid in itself, or\r\ndistinguished by acts of individual prowess, can only be appreciated\r\nby its results, the battle of Killiecrankie, instead of being\r\nadvantageous to the cause of King James, was, by the death of the\r\nbrave Dundee, the precursor of its ruin. After he had charged at the\r\nhead of his horse, and driven the enemy from their cannon, he was\r\nabout to proceed up the hill to bring down Sir Donald Macdonald’s\r\nregiment, which appeared rather tardy in its motions, when he\r\nreceived a musket shot in his side, through an opening of his armour,\r\nthe ball probably passing out in front through the centre of his\r\nbreastplate (See Plate of Dundee’s Armour).[602] He attempted to ride\r\na little, but was unable, and fell from his horse mortally wounded,\r\nand almost immediately expired.[603] The loss on the side of Dundee\r\nwas never properly ascertained, but is supposed to have been about\r\n900.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMOUR WORN BY VISCOUNT DUNDEE AT KILLIECRANKIE\r\n\r\n  1.

This youth, who had exhibited early proofs of bravery\r\nworthy of his name, and the race whence he sprung, killed, it is\r\nsaid, 18 of the enemy with his own hand. No less than five cousins\r\nof Sir Donald Macdonald of the isles fell, together with the tutor\r\nof Macdonald of Largo and his sons. Colonel Gilbert Ramsay, and the\r\nbrave laird of Pitcur, “who, like a moving castle in the shape of\r\nmen, threw fire and sword on all sides,”[604] were also numbered with\r\nthe dead on this eventful day.[605]\r\n\r\nIn the Viscount Dundee, King James lost the only man in Scotland\r\npossessed of all the qualifications necessary for conducting to\r\na successful issue the great and important charge which had been\r\ncommitted to him by his sovereign. Educated in the strictest\r\nprinciples of toryism, he could never divest his mind of the\r\nabstract ideas of passive obedience and hereditary right, and\r\nto him, therefore, any attempt to resist the authority of the\r\nsovereign, no matter how far that authority was abused, appeared\r\nhighly treasonable. Though a sincere Protestant Episcopalian, the\r\nheresy of the successor of Charles II. as the religion of James must\r\nhave appeared to him, in no respect altered his ideas of implicit\r\nfidelity to the sovereign, nor did his views undergo any change when\r\nthe arbitrary and unconstitutional proceedings of James seemed to\r\nthe leading men of the nation to have solved the great political\r\nproblem, when resistance should commence and obedience end.[606]\r\nIn his eye, therefore, the revolution which drove the unfortunate\r\nJames from his throne, was a great national sin, which could only\r\nbe atoned for by restoring to him his crown, an object, in the\r\naccomplishment of which, he conceived all good men were bound to lend\r\na helping hand. These ideas ingrafted upon a temperament peculiarly\r\nsanguine, made him an enthusiast in favour of hereditary right, and\r\nhis appointment by the fallen monarch as the chosen one by whose\r\ninstrumentality his restoration was to be effected, imparted a charm\r\nto his enthusiasm which dispelled every difficulty that appeared\r\nto obstruct the grand object of his ambition and his hopes. With an\r\ninflexibility of purpose, which no temptation could overcome, he\r\nsteadily pursued the course which the duty he conceived he owed to\r\nhis sovereign and the natural inclination of his own mind directed\r\nhim to follow. But Dundee had not merely the will, but, what was of\r\nno less importance, the ability, had he lived, to have executed the\r\ncommission intrusted to him, one of his highest qualifications for\r\nsuch a purpose--considering the fickle and unruly bands he had to\r\ncommand--being that he stood unrivalled among his contemporaries in\r\nthe art of gaining the affections of his troops, and communicating to\r\nthem a full measure of the spirit which animated himself. His death,\r\ntherefore, was a fatal blow to James’s prospects, and with him the\r\ncause of the Stuarts may be said to have perished. Dundee and his\r\nfriend Pitcur were interred in the church of Blair-Athole. “Never\r\nvaulted roof or marble monument covered the last abode of a more\r\nrestless and ambitious heart than that which has slept in this quiet\r\nspot amidst peasant dust.”[607]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[556] General Hugh Mackay, third son of Colonel Hugh Mackay of\r\nScowry, was born about 1640. Soon after the Restoration in 1660, he\r\nobtained an ensign’s commission in the Royal Scots, now the Scots\r\nGreys, and accompanied it to France on that corps being lent by\r\nCharles II. to the French king. In 1669 he entered the Venetian\r\nservice, in which he distinguished himself. Leaving the service of\r\nthat republic, he again went to France, where he obtained a captaincy\r\nin Douglas’s regiment. After serving under Marshal Turenne, in the\r\ncampaign in the Netherlands, in 1672, Captain Mackay offered his\r\nservices to the Prince of Orange, who gave him the commission of\r\nMajor in one of the Scotch regiments, then serving in Holland. After\r\nreaching the rank of Colonel in the Dutch service, Mackay was invited\r\nto England by James II., from whom, on the 4th of June, 1685, he\r\nreceived the appointment of major-general, or commander in chief, of\r\nthe forces in Scotland; and was admitted a member of the Scottish\r\nPrivy Council, by virtue of a warrant from the king, dated the\r\n18th of the same month. But disliking the arbitrary proceedings of\r\nJames, or preferring the service of his son-in-law, Mackay resigned\r\nhis commission in 1686, and returned to Holland. The prince raised\r\nhim to the rank of Major-general, and gave him the command of the\r\nBritish regiments, with which he invaded England. By a warrant\r\nsigned by William and Mary, dated from Kensington, 4th January,\r\n1689, Mackay was appointed “Major-general of all forces whatever,\r\nwithin our ancient kingdom of Scotland.” Mackay was raised to the\r\nrank of Lieutenant-general in 1690, and was killed at the battle of\r\nSteinkirk, 3d August, 1692.\r\n\r\n[557] “To the regular trained officers, such an army as he commanded\r\nwas as unstable and capricious as a giddy mob. If he did not study\r\nthe peculiarities of the race, and of each individual clan, some\r\nuntoward accident was ever occurring to vex his disciplinarian\r\nspirit, and make him suspect that the cause was ruined; and if\r\nhe did not at once recognise and yield to the peculiarities as\r\nthey occurred, a trifle might readily sacrifice the army or the\r\ncause,--for the Highland soldier’s immediate cause was his leader or\r\nhis clan. The succession to the crown of Britain, or the preservation\r\nof the constitution were distant and secondary objects, to be\r\nsacrificed without hesitation to any question of precedence or\r\netiquette.”--Burton’s _Scotland from the Revolution_, vol. i. pp.\r\n101-103.--“If anything good was brought him (Dundee) to eat, he sent\r\nit to a faint or sick soldier. If a soldier was weary, he offered\r\nto carry his arms. He kept those who were with him from sinking\r\nunder their fatigues, not so much by exhortation, as by preventing\r\nthem from attending to their sufferings. For this reason he walked\r\non foot with the men; now by the side of one clan, and anon by that\r\nof another. He amused them with jokes. He flattered them with his\r\nknowledge of their genealogies. He animated them by a recital of the\r\ndeeds of their ancestors, and of the verses of their bards. It was\r\none of his maxims, that no general should fight with an irregular\r\narmy, unless he was acquainted with every man he commanded. Yet,\r\nwith these habits of familiarity, the severity of his discipline was\r\ndreadful. The only punishment he inflicted was death. ‘All other\r\npunishments,’ he said, ‘disgraced a gentleman, and all who were\r\nwith him were of that rank; but that death was a relief from the\r\nconsciousness of crime.’ It is reported of him, that, having seen a\r\nyouth fly in his first action, he pretended he had sent him to the\r\nrear on a message. The youth fled a second time. He brought him to\r\nthe front of the army, and saying, ‘That a gentleman’s son ought not\r\nto fall by the hands of a common executioner,’ shot him with his own\r\npistol.”--Dalrymple’s _Memoirs_, part ii. p. 47.\r\n\r\n[558] Mackay’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[559] _Memoirs of Dundee._--Burton’s _Scotland from the Revolution_,\r\nvol. i. p. 112.\r\n\r\n[560] _Scotland from Revolution_, vol. i. p. 114.\r\n\r\n[561] “Lord Athole, Lord Tarbet, and Lord Breadalbane, men of great\r\npower in the North, were prevailed upon to give him no disturbance:\r\nThe two first because they thought themselves neglected by the new\r\ngovernment; the last to make himself necessary to it.”--Dalrymple’s\r\n_Memoirs_, Part ii. p. 45.\r\n\r\n[562] P. 38, of Bannatyne club edition.\r\n\r\n[563] _Memoirs_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[564] The following letter to Macleod of Macleod shows Dundee’s\r\nnotion of his prospects at this time:--\r\n\r\n  “_For the_ LAIRD _of_ MACLEOD.[565]\r\n\r\n  “MOY, Jun 23, 1689.\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--Glengaire gave me ane account of the substance of a\r\n  letter he receaved from yow: I shall only tell yow, that if you\r\n  heasten not to land your men, I am of opinion yow will have\r\n  litle occasion to do the king great service; for if he land in\r\n  the west of Scotland, yow will come too late, as I believe yow\r\n  will thinck yourself by the news I have to tell yow. The Prince\r\n  of Orange hath wreaten to the Scots councell not to fatig his\r\n  troops any more by following us in the hills, but to draw them\r\n  together in a body to the west; and, accordingly, severall of the\r\n  forces that were in Pearthshire and Angus, are drawn to Edinr.,\r\n  and some of Mackay’s regments are marcht that way from him....\r\n  Some of the French fleet hath been seen amongst the islands, and\r\n  hath taken the two Glasgow frigats. The king, being thus master\r\n  by sea and land, hath nothing to do but bring over his army,\r\n  which many people fancy is landed alraidy in the west. He will\r\n  have little to oppose him there, and will probably march towards\r\n  England; so that we who are in the graitest readiness will\r\n  have ado to join him. I have received by Mr. Hay a commission\r\n  of lieutenant-general, which miscairied by Breidy. I have also\r\n  receaved a double of a letter miscairied by Breidy to me, and\r\n  a new letter, dated the 18th of May; both which are so kind,\r\n  that I am asham’d to tell. He counts for great services, which\r\n  I am conscious to myself that I have hardly done my deutie. He\r\n  promises not only to me, but to all that will join, such marks\r\n  of favor, as after ages shall see what honour and advantage\r\n  there is, in being loyall. He sayes, in express terms, that\r\n  his favours shall vy with our loyalty. He hath, by the same\r\n  letters, given full power of councell to such councellors here,\r\n  as shall be joined in the king’s service, and given us power,\r\n  with the rest of his freends, to meet in a convention, by his\r\n  authority, to counteract the mock convention at Edinr., whom he\r\n  hath declaired traitours, and comanded all his loyall subjects\r\n  to make warr against them; in obedience to which, I have called\r\n  all the clannes. Captain of Glenrannald[566] is near us these\r\n  severall days; the laird of Baro[567] is there with his men. I am\r\n  persuaded Sir Donald[568] is there by this. M’Clean[569] lands in\r\n  Morven to-morrow certainly. Apen,[570] Glenco,[571] Lochell,[572]\r\n  Glengaire,[573] Keppoch,[574] are all raidy. Sir Alexander[575]\r\n  and Largo[576] have been here with there men all this while\r\n  with me, so that I hope we will go out of Lochaber about thre\r\n  thousand. Yow may judge what we will gett in Strathharig,\r\n  Badenock, Athol, Marr, and the duke of Gordon’s lands, besides\r\n  the loyall shires of Bamf, Aberdeen, Merns, Angus, Perth, and\r\n  Stirling. I hope we will be masters of the north, as the king’s\r\n  army will be of the south. I had almost forgot to tell you of my\r\n  Lord Broadalban,[577] who I suppose will now come to the feelds.\r\n  Dumbeth, with two hundred hors and eight hundred foot, are said\r\n  to be endeavouring to join us. My L.

But\r\n  I had one advantage, the Highlanders will not fire above once,\r\n  and then take to the broadsword.... The advocate[581] is gone\r\n  to England, a very honest man, firm beyond belief; and Athol is\r\n  gone too, who did not know what to do. Earl Hume, who is very\r\n  frank, is taken prisoner to Edinburgh, but he will be let out\r\n  on security. Earl Breadalbin keeps close in a strong house; he\r\n  has and pretends the gout. Earl Errol stays at home; so does\r\n  Aberdeen. Earl Marshall is at Edinburgh, but does not meddle.\r\n  Earl Lauderdale is right, and at home. The Bishops, I know not\r\n  where they are. They are now the kirk invisible. I will be\r\n  forced to open the letter, and send copies attested to them, and\r\n  keep the original, till I can find out our primate. The poor\r\n  ministers are sorely oppressed over all. They generally stand\r\n  right. Duke Queensberry was present at the cross, when their\r\n  new mock King was proclaimed, and I hear, voted for him, though\r\n  not for the throne vacant. His brother the Lieutenant General,\r\n  some say is made an Earl. He has come down to Edinburgh, and is\r\n  gone up again. He is the old man, and has abused me strangely,\r\n  for he swore to me to make amends. Tarbat is a great villain.\r\n  Besides what he has done at Edinburgh, he has endeavoured to\r\n  seduce Lochiel, by offers of money, which is under his hand.\r\n  He is now gone up to secure his faction, which is melting, the\r\n  two Dalrymples and others against Skelmarly,[582] Polwart,\r\n  Cardross, Ross, and others now joined with that worthy prince,\r\n  Duke Hamilton. M. Douglas is now a great knave, as well as beast;\r\n  as is Glencairne, Morton, and Eglinton, and even Cassillis is\r\n  gone astray, misled by Gibby.[583] Panmure keeps right, and at\r\n  home, so does Strathmore, Southesk, and Kinnaird. Old Airly is at\r\n  Edinburgh under caution, so is Balcarras and Dunmore. Stormont is\r\n  declared fugitive for not appearing. All these will break out,\r\n  and many more, when the King lands, or any from him. Most of the\r\n  gentry on this side the Forth, and many on the other, will do\r\n  so too. But they suffer mightily in the mean time; and will be\r\n  forced to submit, if there be not relief sent very soon. The Duke\r\n  of Gordon, they say, wanted nothing for holding out but hopes\r\n  of relief. Earl of Dunfermling stays constantly with me, and so\r\n  does Lord Dunkell, Pitcur, and many other gentlemen, who really\r\n  deserve well, for they suffer great hardships. When the troops\r\n  land there must be blank commissions sent for horse and foot, for\r\n  them and others that will join.”\r\n\r\n[580] This letter was printed by Macpherson from the Nairne papers.\r\n\r\n[581] Sir George Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n[582] Sir James Montgomery.\r\n\r\n[583] Dr. Gilbert Burnet, the historian.\r\n\r\n[584] Mackay’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[585] No. 14 of Appendix to Mackay’s _Memoirs_, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[586] Balcarras, p. 68.

On this account there was a deficiency of troops\r\nin Dundee’s centre.--Memoir of Dundee in _Miscellanea Scotica_, vol.\r\niii.\r\n\r\n[595] “The night before the battle, Dundee having reflected that the\r\nHighlanders had not been tried in general actions since the battle\r\nof Philiphaugh, which had been fought 40 years before, and being\r\ndesirous to put their courage to the test, gave an alarm, and caused\r\na false attack to be made upon his own camp.

Burton’s _Scotland from Revolution_, vol. i. p.\r\n132. Burton, however, thinks we may readily believe General Mackay’s\r\nstatement as to the few homely sentences which he says he dropped to\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\n[598] Macpherson’s _Original Papers_, vol i. p 371.\r\n\r\n[599] _Memoirs_, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[600] In a conversation respecting the battle between General Wade\r\nand an old Highlander, who had fought at Killiecrankie, the latter\r\nis reported to have spoken lightly of Mackay as a commander, calling\r\nhim a great fool, because he did not put his baggage in front of his\r\narmy at Killiecrankie. Wade dissented, of course, but the old man\r\ninsisted that the baggage should have been placed before the line,\r\nin which case Mackay, he observed, would have gained the battle, as\r\nthe Highlanders would have first attacked the baggage, and would have\r\nthus fallen an easy prey to Mackay’s army.\r\n\r\n[601] In allusion to this battle, the author of the memoirs of\r\nViscount Dundee, (in _His. Scot._, vol. iii.,) says, “Then the\r\nHighlanders fired, threw down their fusils, rushed in upon the enemy\r\nwith sword, target, and pistol, who did not maintain their ground two\r\nminutes after the Highlanders were amongst them; and I dare be bold\r\nto say, that were scarce ever such strokes given in Europe as were\r\ngiven that day by the Highlanders. Many of General Mackay’s officers\r\nand soldiers were cut down through the skull and neck to the very\r\nbreast; others had skulls cut off above their ears like night-caps;\r\nsome soldiers had both their bodies and cross-belts cut through at\r\none blow; pikes and small swords were cut like willows; and whoever\r\ndoubts of this, may consult the witnesses of the tragedy.”\r\n\r\n[602] Balcarras.\r\n\r\n[603] The authenticity of the letter alleged to have been written\r\nby Dundee after he received his wound, may well be doubted. 1st.\r\nNo contemporary writer mentions its existence. 2d. It is probable\r\nthat Dundee died as stated in the text. King James says, that “when\r\ncrossing over the plaine to give some orders on the left where the\r\nenemy made the most opposition, he was most unfortunately _killed_\r\nby a random shot.” Clarke’s _James II._, vol. ii. p. 352. See the\r\nauthorities referred to by Mr. Smythe of Methven, in a note on the\r\nletter in the Bannatyne collection of Dundee’s letters. These are\r\nsupported by the following note, written on a copy of Balcarras’s\r\n_Memoirs_, in the Library of Christ Church, Oxford, upon the passage\r\nrelative to a bundle of papers found lying near Dundee on the field.\r\n\r\n“N.B.--I spoke with some that were at that fight, and saw the\r\nViscount of Dundee’s corpse naked upon the ground, and was of the\r\nnumber that wrapt it in a pladd, and brought it off the field to the\r\nBlair of Athole; they said they saw no papers, nor was there any such\r\nrumour among them.” ...\r\n\r\nHis Grace the Duke of Athole has kindly sent us the following note\r\non this matter. “Lord Dundee is reported to have been watering his\r\nhorse at a spring within gunshot of Urrard House, and at the same\r\ntime lifted his left arm to point or give some directions. At this\r\ninstant he was shot out of a window through the chinks of his armour,\r\n_i.e._ between back- and breast-plates, which must have gaped open.\r\nThe left side of the breastplate, inside, is stained apparently with\r\nblood, and the ball must have passed out from back to front through\r\nthe hole in the centre (See Plate). An old woman who died near here\r\n(Blair) within the memory of persons still living, used to relate how\r\nher grandfather was skulking on the hill above and saw Lord Dundee\r\nfall; and his brother, who was the hostler at the inn at Blair, saw\r\nhim carried in _there_, and said that Lord Dundee died in the middle\r\nroom, upstairs, of the inn. I think I have seen it stated elsewhere\r\nthat he was taken to the Castle, but I should be inclined to believe\r\nthe country tradition.”\r\n\r\n_The alleged letter from_ DUNDEE _to the_ KING _is as follows_:--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,\r\n\r\n  It hath pleased God to give your forces a great victory over\r\n  the rebels, in which three-fourths of them are fallen under\r\n  the weight of our swords. I might say much of the action, if I\r\n  had not the honour to command it; but of 5,000 men, which was\r\n  the best computation I could make of the rebels, it is certain\r\n  there have not escaped 1,200. We have not lost full out 900.\r\n  This absolute victory made us masters of the field and enemy’s\r\n  baggage, which I gave to the soldiers; who, to do them all right,\r\n  both officers and common men. Highlands, Lowlands, and Irish,\r\n  behaved themselves with equal gallantry to what I ever saw in the\r\n  hottest battles fought abroad by disciplined armies; and this\r\n  M’Kay’s old soldiers felt on this occasion. I cannot now, Sir,\r\n  be more particular; but take leave to assure your majesty the\r\n  kingdom is generally disposed to your service, and impatiently\r\n  wait for your coming; and this success will bring in the rest\r\n  of the nobility and gentry, having had all their assurance for\r\n  it, except the notorious rebels. Therefore, Sir, for God’s sake,\r\n  assist us, though it be with such another detachment as you sent\r\n  us before, especially of horse and dragoons; and you will crown\r\n  our beginning with a complete success, and yourself with an\r\n  entire possession of your ancient hereditary kingdom of Scotland.\r\n  My wounds forbid me to enlarge to your Majesty at this time,\r\n  though they tell me they are not mortal. However, I beseech your\r\n  Majesty to believe, whether I live or die,\r\n\r\n  I am entirely yours,\r\n\r\n  DUNDEE.”\r\n\r\n“The letter is so happily expressed as to be a forgery on its face;\r\nfor it is not to be imagined that he who vainly struggled after\r\ngrammar with all his senses with him, would command it when mortally\r\nwounded, and utterly unfit for that species of command with which he\r\nwas familiar.”--Burton, vol. i. p. 134.\r\n\r\n[604] _Memoirs of Dundee._\r\n\r\n[605] “In this battle Lochiel was attended by the son of his\r\nfoster-brother. This faithful adherent followed him like his shadow,\r\nready to assist him with his sword, or cover him from the shot of the\r\nenemy. Soon after the battle began, the chief missed his friend from\r\nhis side, and turning round to look what had become of him, saw him\r\nlying on his back, with his breast pierced by an arrow. He had hardly\r\nbreath before he expired to tell Lochiel, that, seeing an enemy, a\r\nHighlander in General Mackay’s army, aiming at him with a bow and\r\narrow from the rear, he sprung behind him, and thus sheltered him\r\nfrom instant death. This is a species of duty not often practised,\r\nperhaps, by an aide-de-camp of the present day.”--_Stewart’s\r\nSketches._\r\n\r\n[606] “He became a fanatic of the order he found himself in,--the\r\norder of the cavalier who is devoted to his monarch and his monarch’s\r\nallies, aristocratic and hierarchical. His fanaticism was that of the\r\ngentleman. It is not common, perhaps, to associate the reproachful\r\nterm, ‘fanatic,’ with a word so expressive of estimable social\r\nqualities as this word ‘gentleman;’ but as there is no hesitation in\r\napplying it to religious opinions carried to excess, surely there can\r\nbe no desecration in applying it to social qualities when they become\r\noffensively prurient.”--Burton’s _Scotland from Revolution_, vol. i.\r\np. 99.\r\n\r\n[607] Burton, vol. i. p. 134.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1689-1691.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--William III., 1688-1703.\r\n\r\n  Mackay’s movements--Advances to Perth--Colonel Cannon marches\r\n  north and is joined by several clans--Followed by Mackay--Cannon\r\n  returns south--The Cameronians at Dunkeld--Movements of Mackay\r\n  --Major-General Buchan arrives from Ireland and marches north\r\n  --Skirmish at Cromdale--Mackay marches to Inverlochy--Erection\r\n  of Fort-William--Movements of Buchan and Cannon--Mackay marches\r\n  to the north--Earl of Seaforth imprisoned--Cessation of hostilities\r\n  --Departure of Dundee’s officers for France.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of Mackay’s defeat reached Edinburgh on Sunday the\r\n28th of July, the day after the battle, and threw the partizans\r\nof the government, who were there assembled, into the greatest\r\nconsternation. In the absence of official details, the most gloomy\r\naccounts were given by a few terrified stragglers who arrived in the\r\ncapital, and who gave out that, with the exception of themselves,\r\nthe whole of Mackay’s army had been destroyed. In the state of\r\ndisorder and confusion which prevailed, the Duke of Hamilton, the\r\nCommissioner to the revolution parliament, summoned a meeting of the\r\nprivy council, at which orders were issued to raise all the fencible\r\nmen in the west, and to concentrate all the forces in the south at\r\nStirling, to which point it was supposed Dundee (of whose death they\r\nwere not aware) would be rapidly hastening; and on the supposition\r\nthat Mackay was either killed or made prisoner, Sir John Lanier was\r\nordered west to take the command.\r\n\r\nDuring two entire days the ferment continued in the capital, and\r\nevery hour added to the fears of those who had most to dread from a\r\ncounter-revolution. At length, when the minds of men were wrought\r\nup to the highest pitch of terror and dismay, intelligence was\r\nreceived of the death of Dundee, and shortly thereafter a despatch\r\nfrom General Mackay, giving an account of the battle, and of his safe\r\nretreat to Stirling. An event so unlooked for and so important as the\r\ndeath of the only man in whom the hopes of King James rested, and\r\nfrom the decision of whose character the supporters of the revolution\r\nsettlement anticipated the most fearful consequences, was hailed by\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton and his friends with transports of joy. They\r\nhad indeed good reason to rejoice, for although the battle had been\r\ndisastrous to their forces, the loss which King James had sustained\r\nin the person of Dundee was irreparable.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Stirling, Mackay met Sir John Lanier, who communicated\r\nto him the orders that had been issued by the government on receiving\r\nthe news of his defeat. So decisive had the battle of Killiecrankie\r\nappeared to them that they had given up all idea of maintaining a\r\nposition on the north of the Forth, all the country beyond which they\r\nmeant to abandon to the victorious arms of Dundee, and to confine\r\ntheir operations to a defence of the fords of the Forth, and the\r\npass and bridge of Stirling. In pursuance of this design orders had\r\nbeen sent to Barclay’s regiment, which was quartered in the county\r\nof Aberdeen, to retire upon Dundee, and Lanier had despatched an\r\nexpress to his own regiment, which lay partly at Alnwick and partly\r\nat Morpeth, to hasten down to Scotland. This plan, however, was\r\ndisapproved of by Mackay, and he, therefore, as he says, “resolved\r\nto alter these measures, knowing how hard a pull we would have, if\r\nhe left the north, which are absolutely the best men of that kingdom\r\nfor the war, to the discretion of the enemy, where he would not only\r\nget great numbers to join him, but also take possession of towns and\r\nseize upon the public revenues, whereby they could form a fashion of\r\ngovernment, and so have more plausible ways, not only to maintain but\r\nalso to engross their party, than ever they have had.”[608]\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Mackay determined to take the field again without\r\ndelay, and to give, as he observes, “some eclat to the service, and\r\nhinder the disaffected of the shires of Perth and Angus to rise in\r\narms against the government,” he resolved to march direct to Perth\r\nwith the forces which were at hand, and place a garrison there.\r\nFortunately some of the troops which the privy council had ordered to\r\nrendezvous at Stirling were already there, and others were at hand.\r\nPreparatory to his march he sent Sir John Lanier to Edinburgh to\r\nhasten the advance of his own regiment, consisting of nine troops of\r\nhorse, and also of Hayford’s dragoons, consisting of eight troops,\r\nand ordered eight troops of horse, and four of dragoons, both of\r\nwhich had been newly levied, and Lord Colchester’s regiment of horse,\r\nnot above 500 men in all, to join him at Stirling on the morning of\r\nWednesday, the 31st of July. Many thousands of men in the western\r\ncounties were now assembling of their own accord in consequence of\r\nMackay’s defeat; but disliking such auxiliaries, “whose pretensions,”\r\nhe says, “appeared already exorbitant enough,” and who, if employed,\r\nmight think that the government could not be maintained without their\r\nassistance, he intimated that he would not require their services,\r\nand ordered them to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe horse and dragoons having come to Stirling as directed, with\r\nthese he departed for Perth at two o’clock in the afternoon, giving\r\norders to a newly-raised battalion of foot, consisting of Mar and\r\nBargeny’s regiments, to follow him. On his way he could obtain no\r\nintelligence respecting the motions of the enemy, as he found the\r\nhouses mostly deserted by their inhabitants, who had taken up arms\r\nand had gone to join the standard of King James. On approaching the\r\nriver Earn, however, Mackay’s scouts, who, to prevent notice of his\r\napproach, kept only a musket-shot in advance, were saluted with a\r\nloud “qui vive” by two horsemen. The scouts, four in number, answered\r\nthis challenge by a discharge from their carabines, which brought\r\ndown the two horsemen, one of whom was shot dead. The other was\r\nmortally wounded, and though he spoke a few words, was not able to\r\nanswer some questions put to him for eliciting information. As Mackay\r\nconjectured from this occurrence, that the main body of the enemy\r\nwas not far off, he altered his line of march, and crossing a pretty\r\nsteep hill to the north, reached the field of Tippermuir, a few miles\r\nwest from Perth.\r\n\r\nHaving been informed at Tippermuir, that the enemy lay encamped at\r\nDunkeld, and that a party of their horse and foot was in Perth for\r\nthe purpose of carrying off some meal which had been sent thither\r\nby the council for the use of Mackay’s army, the general drew off\r\nhis men to the left to throw himself between Dunkeld and Perth, and\r\nthereby cut off the party. He himself marched down upon Perth, but\r\non coming within sight of the town was disappointed to observe that\r\nabout 30 of the enemy’s horse had already crossed the Tay, and were\r\nbeyond his reach. He proceeded on his march, and when within half a\r\nmile of the town observed the foot party, which consisted of about\r\n300 Athole-men, approaching. The Highlanders, who had not the most\r\ndistant idea that there was a single enemy nearer than Stirling, were\r\nalmost petrified with horror when they beheld such a large body of\r\ncavalry ready to pounce upon them, and for a time they stood quite\r\nmotionless not knowing what to do. Apprehensive that they might\r\nattempt to escape by a ford near the place where they stood, Mackay\r\ndespatched four troops of dragoons at full gallop to prevent their\r\npassage. The Athole-men seeing that their retreat would be cut off,\r\nthrew themselves into the Tay, whither they were followed by the\r\nhorse and dragoons, who cut them down in the water without mercy.\r\nAbout 120 of the Athole-men were killed and 30 made prisoners. In\r\nthis affair Mackay lost only one man, who had imprudently pursued to\r\na distance a small party of the Highlanders.[609]\r\n\r\nThis disastrous skirmish, whilst it raised the expectations of the\r\nrevolutionists, threw a damp over King James’s supporters, and\r\naugured ill for the success of Colonel Cannon, who had assumed the\r\ncommand of James’s army on the death of Dundee. This officer, though\r\na faithful adherent of his royal master, was altogether unfit for\r\nthe command of such an army. He seems to have possessed none of\r\nDundee’s genius, and his regular military experience rendered him\r\ntotally unfit to deal with such an irregular and capricious race as\r\nwere the Highlanders, with whose habits, feelings, and dispositions,\r\nhe was totally unacquainted. Had Dundee lived he would probably have\r\ncarried his victorious army across the Forth, seized upon the capital\r\nand dispersed the government; but his successor did not know how to\r\ntake advantage of the victory which had been obtained, and instead\r\nof marching instantly south, he merely advanced to Dunkeld, about 16\r\nmiles from the field of the recent battle, where he remained encamped\r\nfor several days, when the party he had sent to Perth was attacked\r\nand almost destroyed by the dogged and steady Mackay.\r\n\r\nAt Dunkeld, Cannon was joined by the Stewarts of Appin, the\r\nMacgregors and the Athole-men under Lord James Murray, of which\r\ncircumstance Mackay was informed soon after his arrival at Perth.\r\nIn the meantime he took care to secure the town against attack by\r\nerecting pallisades, and sent out patrols during the night to bring\r\nnotice of the enemy should they approach the town. Cannon, however,\r\nmade no attempt to disturb Mackay, and after passing several days at\r\nDunkeld in inactivity, he raised his camp and proceeded northwards\r\nalong the skirts of the Grampians with a force of about 3,000 men.\r\nIt was the intention of Mackay to have returned to Edinburgh to\r\nconsult with the privy council as to the best means of speedily\r\nsettling the peace of the kingdom, and to leave Mar and Bargeny’s\r\nregiments and six troops of cavalry in garrison at Perth; but on\r\nhearing of Cannon’s movement to the north he abandoned his intention,\r\nand after despatching orders to Sir John Lanier to proceed to Perth\r\nwith all possible haste along with the horse and dragoons which were\r\nexpected from England, he crossed the Tay with his whole cavalry\r\nforce, consisting of nearly 1,500 men, leaving two battalions of foot\r\nbehind, and advanced towards Coupar-Angus. At Coupar he received\r\nintelligence from some prisoners who had been taken at Killiecrankie,\r\nand who had escaped on the march north, that Cannon had marched\r\nas far as Glen Isla, about eight miles from Forfar, where he had\r\nencamped. Mackay in consequence continued his march to Forfar, where\r\nhe learned that Cannon had made another movement to Clova.\r\n\r\nAfter passing two nights at Forfar, he received notice that Cannon\r\nhad crossed the mountains and entered Braemar. As Mackay considered\r\nthat these movements of Cannon were intended by him as a _ruse_ to\r\ndraw him north, and that when Cannon had accomplished his object he\r\nmeant immediately to recross the mountains and enter Angus, where\r\nhe expected some reinforcements to join him, Mackay sent orders to\r\nLanier to advance to Forfar, to serve as a check upon Cannon should\r\nhe again enter Angus, and proceeded himself to Aberdeen, which he\r\nreached the second day, to the great joy, he says, of most of the\r\ninhabitants, who were in dread of a visit from the Highlanders that\r\nvery night.[610]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACPHERSON, FULL DRESS. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Braes of Mar, Cannon was joined by the\r\nFarquharsons, the Frasers, the Gordons of Strathdown and Glenlivet,\r\nand by 200 of the Macphersons. Keppoch and young Lochiel also met\r\nhim.[611] At Aberdeen, Mackay received an express from the Master of\r\nForbes, informing him that Cannon had taken up a very strong position\r\nupon his father’s lands, having the Highlands at his back and a\r\nwood to cover him in front; the position being so well chosen that\r\nhe could keep up a free communication with his friends in the lower\r\nparts of the shires of Aberdeen and Banff. Judging that Cannon’s\r\nobject in selecting such a position was to strengthen himself in\r\nhorse from the adjoining low country, of which species of force\r\nhe stood in most need, Mackay, with the view of obstructing his\r\nlevies, ordered Sir Thomas Livingston to leave the command of the\r\nforces at Inverness with Sir James Leslie, and to repair immediately\r\nto Strathbogie with his regiment of dragoons, with instructions,\r\nshould the enemy appear in that quarter, to march farther to the\r\nleft across the low country, and to send him despatches from time to\r\ntime, announcing the state of matters. At the same time he ordered\r\nSir John Lanier to send Hayford’s regiment of dragoons to Aberdeen to\r\nstrengthen him.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a day at Aberdeen, Mackay marched up Dee-side to beat\r\nup Cannon’s quarters, but learning on his march that the Highlanders\r\nhad left Lord Forbes’s lands and had gone north in the direction of\r\nthe Duke of Gordon’s territory, he drew off his men next morning\r\nat break of day towards Strathbogie, for the purpose of covering\r\nLivingston’s march. Mackay having nothing but cavalry, got the start\r\nof Cannon, and reached Strathbogie before Cannon arrived at the\r\ncastle of Auchindoun, where he intended to fix his head quarters.\r\nAt Auchindoun, Cannon was informed that Mackay was already at the\r\ncastle of Strathbogie, a distance of about six miles. He, thereupon,\r\ncalled a council of war to discuss the expediency of giving battle to\r\nMackay. A preliminary question was agitated by the Highland chiefs\r\nas to the right of the Lowland officers to sit in the council, the\r\nformer contending that as none of these officers had any troops\r\nunder their immediate command, and were wholly unacquainted with the\r\ndiscipline of the Highlanders and their mode of fighting, they had\r\nno right to deliberate on the subject, and were unable to form a\r\ncorrect judgment on the question they were called upon to discuss.\r\nThe decision of this point lay with Cannon, who, by the advice of the\r\nEarl of Dunfermline, decided the question against the Highlanders. A\r\njudgment more unfortunate to the cause of King James could not have\r\nbeen pronounced, as it gave rise to jealousies and strifes among\r\nthe officers, and when the question whether a battle should be\r\nhazarded was put to the vote, the clans who were for fighting Mackay\r\nimmediately, found themselves in a minority. This was followed by\r\na resolution to return to Athole. As matters stood, the chances of\r\nvictory on either side may be considered to have been pretty fairly\r\nbalanced, but subsequent events showed that Cannon in the present\r\ninstance omitted the best opportunity he was ever destined to have of\r\ngaining a victory which might have decided the fate of Scotland.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mackay’s men were almost worn out with extreme fatigue,\r\nbeing kept under arms every night for a considerable time, and only\r\nallowed an occasional repose by turns during the day-time, the\r\ngeneral resolved to follow Cannon with all possible despatch.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Cannon’s movement was owing to the following\r\ncircumstances. The privy council wishing to obtain possession of\r\nthe castles of Blair and Finlarig, had sent a letter to Mackay at\r\nStrathbogie with instructions to proceed to these places before the\r\nrainy season should set in, for the purpose of reducing and putting\r\ngarrisons into them. Mackay, in answer, stated his inability to\r\nundertake such a service in the face of the formidable force which\r\nlay so near him, and that he did not conceive there was any necessity\r\nfor being in such a hurry, as, from the proximity of these castles to\r\nthe low country, he could make himself master of them at any time if\r\nsufficiently strong. But he observed, that if the council was bent\r\nupon the undertaking, they might direct Sir John Lanier to order some\r\nfoot and Barclay’s regiment to join him from Forfar, and with these\r\nand three battalions of the Dutch regiments, then at Perth, and which\r\nhad not been at the battle of Killiecrankie, execute that piece of\r\nservice. Upon receiving Mackay’s answer, the council ordered the Earl\r\nof Angus’s regiment, known by the name of the Cameronian regiment--a\r\nband of stern, fearless, religious enthusiasts from the west--to\r\nadvance to Dunkeld, with the view, it is supposed, of supporting\r\nLanier. Mackay was quite averse to the employment of these men, and\r\ndisapproved of the plan of posting them so near the Highlands, the\r\neffect of which, he observed, would be, that they would be instantly\r\nattacked, “because the enemy had not such prejudice at any of\r\nthe forces as at this regiment, whom they called the Cameronian\r\nregiment, whose oppression against all such as were not of their own\r\nsentiments, made them generally hated and feared in the northern\r\ncounties.”[612] Accordingly, no sooner had they encamped at Dunkeld,\r\nthan some of King James’s friends in Athole resolved to put them\r\noff, and a notice was sent to Cannon to return south with that view,\r\nin consequence of which, he raised his camp and proceeded suddenly\r\ntowards the Dee, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\nMackay followed him, and on arriving at Aberdeen, warned Sir John\r\nLanier of the advance of Cannon, and to prevent the Highlanders from\r\nmaking any inroads, he sent out small parties of his men to scour the\r\nneighbouring country. When Lanier was informed of Cannon’s approach,\r\nhe left Forfar, where he was posted with his own and Barclay’s\r\nregiment, for Brechin, near to which town the enemy had advanced.\r\nSome skirmishing took place between the advanced posts, with loss on\r\nboth sides. The Highlanders, thereupon, retired to the hills, and\r\nLanier, who was ignorant of the object of Cannon’s march, returned\r\nto Forfar. Here he received orders from the privy council to march\r\nto the castles of Blair and Finlarig, in consequence of which he\r\nproceeded to Coupar-Angus the following day, where intelligence was\r\nbrought him from Colonel Ramsay, that the Highlanders were marching\r\nupon Dunkeld. He was informed at the same time that the Cameronian\r\nregiment, which was disadvantageously posted, would assuredly be\r\ndefeated, if not immediately supported. Instead of sending any\r\ninstructions to Ramsay, who required his advice, Lanier delayed\r\nforwarding an answer till he should arrive at Perth the following\r\nday, “in which interim,” says Mackay, “if the providence of God had\r\nnot blinded Cannon, and disheartened his Highlanders from continuing\r\ntheir attack, the regiment had certainly been lost, for they had two\r\nfull days’ time to carry them, and all their defence was but low\r\ngardens, in most places not above four feet high.”[613]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, the 18th of August, the Cameronians, in\r\nexpectation of an attack, began to entrench themselves within\r\nsome inclosures about the Marquis of Athole’s house at Dunkeld.\r\nThe country people, in parties of ten and twenty, appeared during\r\nthe morning on the neighbouring hills, and about four in the\r\nafternoon a body of about 300 men drew up on a hill to the north of\r\nDunkeld, whence they despatched a messenger, who carried a halbert\r\nsurmounted by a white cloth as a flag of truce, with a letter\r\nwithout any subscription, addressed to Lieutenant-colonel Cleland,\r\nthe commanding officer, of the following tenor:--“We the gentlemen\r\nassembled being informed that ye intend to burn the town, desire to\r\nknow whether ye come for peace or war, and do certify you, that if\r\nye burn any one house, we will destroy you.” To which communication\r\nLieutenant-colonel Cleland replied as follows:--“We are faithful\r\nsubjects to King William and Queen Mary, and enemies to their\r\nenemies; and if you, who send these threats, shall make any hostile\r\nappearance, we will burn all that belongs to you, and otherwise\r\nchastise you as you deserve.”\r\n\r\nOn the first alarm of the Highlanders’ approach to Dunkeld, Colonel\r\nRamsay sent up some troops of horse and dragoons under Lord\r\nCardross to assist the Cameronians in case of attack. This party\r\narrived at Dunkeld on Tuesday morning, but the Highlanders not\r\nbeing yet sufficiently numerous, showed no disposition to attack\r\nthe Cameronians that day. At night, Cleland received intelligence\r\nthat the fiery cross had been sent round, and that a considerable\r\ngathering had taken place, and next morning the Highlanders began\r\nto appear in large parties among the hills, between whom and some\r\ndetached parties of horse and foot which Cleland sent out to scour\r\nthe country, some brisk skirmishing took place during the day. The\r\nHighlanders having retired, Cleland’s forces returned to Dunkeld\r\nin the evening, where Lord Cardross received an order from Colonel\r\nRamsay to return instantly to Perth, from an absurd apprehension that\r\nthe cavalry could be of little use in defending the position occupied\r\nby the Cameronian regiment. When Cleland, who appears to have been\r\na determined, sensible, clear-headed enthusiast of about 30 years\r\nof age, was informed of this extraordinary mandate, he remonstrated\r\nwith Cardross in the strongest manner against complying with it, as\r\nthe safety of his regiment might be involved in the result; but his\r\nlordship pleaded his instructions, which gave him no discretionary\r\npower, and he departed for Perth the same evening, leaving the\r\nCameronians to the tender mercies of their bitterest enemies, the\r\nHighlanders. Cleland’s obvious course was to have followed the\r\ncavalry, but though the danger was imminent, he disdained to abandon\r\nthe post which had been assigned him, and easily prevailed upon the\r\nCameronians to remain and meet the enemy at all hazards. Burton[614]\r\ntruly says that it is difficult to imagine a position more dangerous\r\nfor a Lowland force than the little village of Dunkeld, being deep\r\nsunk among hills commanding it, and cutting off retreat, while a\r\nrapid river forms the diameter of their semicircle.\r\n\r\nThe parties which had appeared during the day consisted entirely\r\nof Athole-men, whose numbers probably did not exceed 500 or 600;\r\nbut in the evening they were joined by the whole of Cannon’s force,\r\namounting to nearly 4,000. To the great surprise and dismay of the\r\nCameronians, this formidable body appeared at six o’clock next\r\nmorning, Wednesday the 21st of August, on the hills about Dunkeld\r\nformed in order of battle. The situation of the Cameronians was now\r\ncritical in the extreme. They had no alternative but to fight or\r\nsurrender, for retreat was not in their power. A capitulation would\r\nhave been the obvious course, but the great abhorrence in which\r\nthe Cameronians were held by the Highlanders, gave faint hopes of\r\nobtaining the usual terms of civilized warfare from the inveterate\r\nhost which hung over them on the surrounding heights. They,\r\ntherefore, adopted the desperate resolution of defending themselves\r\nto the last extremity, and they hoped, that by posting themselves\r\nadvantageously behind the walls and enclosures adjoining the village\r\nand Dunkeld-house, they would be able to keep the Highlanders in\r\ncheck till some relief might arrive.\r\n\r\nThe Cameronian commander accordingly made the necessary preparations\r\nfor defence. He first posted parties of his men in the cathedral\r\nand steeple, and in Dunkeld-house. The remainder of his men he\r\ndisposed behind the walls of the adjoining gardens and parks, and\r\nalong some ditches which he caused to be thrown up to extend his line\r\nof defence. All these arrangements were completed before 7 o’clock\r\nin the morning, about which time the Highlanders appeared moving\r\ndown the hills towards Dunkeld. Desirous to gain possession of the\r\ntown, to dislodge the Cameronians, or to draw off their attention\r\nfrom the points where he meant to direct his main attack, Cannon\r\ndespatched a small train of artillery down a little hill near the\r\ntown, accompanied by 100 men clad in armour, who were followed by\r\na party of Highlanders on foot. To prevent the Cameronians from\r\nescaping by the ford across the Tay, he sent two troops of horse\r\nround the town, who took up a position betwixt the ford and the\r\nchurch, while two other troops were placed at the opposite end of\r\nthe town. When the party arrived at the bottom of the hill, they\r\nwere opposed by a small body of men whom Cleland had posted behind\r\na stone wall, but after some smart firing, this body was obliged\r\nto give way and to retire to Dunkeld-house. Another party of the\r\nCameronians, which had been posted at the other end of the town, was\r\nobliged also to retire. Having forced the outposts, the whole body of\r\nthe Highlanders rushed furiously into the town, which they entered\r\nat four different points at once. The Cameronians, however, firmly\r\nmaintained their ground within the enclosures, from which they kept\r\nup a galling and destructive fire upon the Highlanders, who in vain\r\nattempted to dislodge them. Finding their broad-swords of little\r\navail against the pikes and halberts of an enemy protected by stone\r\nwalls, the Highlanders retired to the houses, and some to the heights\r\nnear the town, from which they kept up a sharp though ineffectual\r\nfire upon the Cameronians, who returned it with much better effect.\r\nThe Cameronians, however, soon sustained a heavy loss in the death\r\nof Cleland, their brave commander, who, in the act of exhorting his\r\nmen to stand firm to their posts, was, within an hour after the\r\nengagement commenced, mortally wounded by two bullets, one of which\r\npierced his liver, the other entering his head at the same instant\r\nAware of his fate, he attempted to gain Dunkeld-house, lest his men,\r\nseeing him expire, might become dispirited; but he was unable to\r\nreach the threshold, and expired in their presence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dunkeld in the 17th century.--From Slezer’s _Theatrum\r\nScotiæ_.]\r\n\r\nDuring three hours an incessant firing was kept up on both sides,\r\nwhich might have continued for several hours longer without producing\r\nany definite result, unless, indeed, the ammunition of either party\r\nhad become exhausted. Probably from the dread of such a contingency,\r\nwhich would have been fatal to the Cameronians, Captain Munro, to\r\nwhom, on the death of Cleland, the command had fallen, resolved to\r\nattempt to dislodge the Highlanders from the houses by setting the\r\ntown on fire. He accordingly sent into the town several small parties\r\nof pikemen with burning faggots upon the points of their pikes to set\r\nfire to the houses in which the Highlanders were posted. This order\r\nwas executed with such promptitude, that in a short time the whole\r\ntown was in a conflagration. The scene which the town now presented\r\nwas one of the most heart-rending description. The din of war was\r\nindeed no longer heard, but a more terrific sound had succeeded,\r\nfrom the wild shrieks of despair which issued from the dense mass of\r\nsmoke and flame which enveloped the unfortunate sufferers. To add\r\nto the calamity, the pikemen had coolly locked the doors of such of\r\nthe houses as had keys standing in them, and the unhappy intruders\r\nbeing thus cut off from escape, perished in the flames. No less than\r\n16 Highlanders were, in consequence, burnt to death in one house.\r\nWith the exception of three houses, possessed by the Cameronians, the\r\nwhole of the town was consumed.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders finding their ammunition all spent,[615] and seeing\r\nthat they could no longer maintain their position among the ruins\r\nof the town, began to retire to the hills about eleven o’clock,\r\nafter having sustained a loss of about 300 men. The Cameronians,\r\nwhose loss was trifling, on seeing the Highlanders depart, set up a\r\nloud shout, threw up their caps, beat their drums, and waved their\r\ncolours in token of triumph, demonstrations which must have been\r\nexceedingly galling to the feelings of the Highlanders, who only\r\nfour hours before had assured themselves of an easy conquest. It is\r\nstated in the Cameronian account of the battle, that an attempt was\r\nmade by Cannon to induce the Highlanders to renew the attack, but\r\nthey declined, for this reason, that although still ready to fight\r\nwith men, they would not again encounter devils.[616] To show their\r\ngratitude to God for “so miraculous a victory,” the Cameronians spent\r\na considerable part of the afternoon in singing psalms of praise and\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders were greatly discouraged by the repulse which they\r\nsustained at Dunkeld, and they attributed the misfortune to the\r\nincapacity of Cannon, in whom they consequently lost all confidence.\r\nPerceiving that they could no longer keep the field with any\r\nprobability of success under such a commander, they retired to Blair,\r\nand after entering into a bond of association to support the cause of\r\nKing James, and for mutual protection, they departed for their homes,\r\nleaving Cannon and his Irish troops and the few lowland gentlemen to\r\nshift for themselves. Cannon went to Mull, and resided with the chief\r\nof Maclean.[617]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mackay left Aberdeen for the purpose of joining\r\nLanier, leaving behind him Sir Thomas Livingston, with his regiment\r\nand nine troops of cavalry, to keep the adjoining northern counties\r\nin awe. At Brechin he learnt that Lanier had received an order\r\nfrom the privy council to march into Athole, in consequence of\r\nwhich information he joined him at Perth on the 26th of August. He\r\nthereafter left Perth, with the greater part of the forces which he\r\nfound there assembled, and took the route to Blair. It was clearly\r\nthe interest of James’s party to have burned the castle of Blair,\r\nso as to prevent Mackay from placing a garrison in it to overawe\r\nthe neighbouring country; but if such was the intention of the\r\nHighlanders, they were deterred from putting it in execution by a\r\nmessage from Mackay, who threatened, in the event of the castle being\r\nburnt, to raze every house in Athole to the ground, and to burn and\r\ndestroy all the corn in that district. Mackay remained ten days at\r\nthe castle of Blair, during which time many of the Athole people\r\ntook advantage of an indemnity which he offered them, and delivered\r\nup their arms. Having placed a garrison of 500 men in the castle, and\r\ngiven orders to raise a pallisade and breast-work round it, he was\r\nforced to return to Perth in consequence of continual rains, which\r\nmade him also forego a resolution he had entertained of marching\r\nto the head of Loch Tay, and placing a garrison in the castle of\r\nFinlarig, belonging to the Earl of Breadalbane, who, according to\r\nhim, was “one of the chiefest and cunningest fomenters of the trouble\r\nof that kingdom (Scotland), not for love of King James, but to make\r\nhimself necessary to the government.”[618] The subsequent conduct\r\nof this nobleman fully corroborated this opinion. After the rains\r\nhad subsided, a detachment of 200 men under Lord Cardross, took\r\npossession of Finlarig castle, notwithstanding that the proprietor\r\nhad, shortly before, taken the oaths to the government, and found\r\nbail for his allegiance.\r\n\r\nWhile the death of Dundee seemed to give stability to the government\r\nin Scotland on the one hand, its safety appeared to be endangered\r\non the other, by the jealousies and dissensions which agitated the\r\nparliament. Among the persons who had been instrumental in bringing\r\nabout the revolution, there were some extreme Presbyterians, who,\r\nseeing that their expectations were not to be realized, and that\r\nall the offices of trust were monopolized by a few favourites about\r\ncourt, became factious and impatient, and were ready to seize the\r\nfirst opportunity that offered of overturning the government. Sir\r\nJames Montgomery was at the head of this disaffected party, which,\r\nduring the ensuing winter, held several private meetings. The result\r\nwas, that a most extraordinary and unnatural coalition took place\r\nbetween the Jacobites and the discontented Presbyterians for the\r\nrestoration of King James. By uniting their votes in parliament\r\nthey expected to embarrass the government, and make it odious to\r\nthe people, and thereby pave the way for the return of the exiled\r\nmonarch; but their designs were disconcerted by a discovery of the\r\nplot.\r\n\r\nMackay had now grown heartily tired of the service, and as his\r\nplans for the subjugation of the Highlands had been treated with\r\nindifference or neglect by the government, he became desirous to\r\nresign his commission, and retire to Holland, his adopted country,\r\nthere to spend the remainder of his days in peace. There was\r\ncertainly nothing in the situation of his native country at the\r\nperiod in question to induce him to remain. An unpaid, disorderly,\r\nand mutinous army; an oppressed people, a discontented nobility,\r\na divided parliament and council; “church divided into two more\r\nirreconcileable factions, though both calling themselves Protestants,\r\nthan Rome and Geneva,” matters deemed of so little importance by\r\nthe first reformers as scarcely to be mentioned in their writings,\r\npreferred by the “religious zealots” of those days to the well-being\r\nof the whole Protestant church, the Episcopal ministers who had\r\nbeen ejected preaching “King James more than Christ, as they had\r\nbeen accustomed to take passive obedience more than the gospel for\r\ntheir text:”--these considerations all tended to disgust a man of\r\na moderate and conciliating disposition like Mackay, and made him\r\n“look upon Scotsmen of those times in general, as void of zeal for\r\ntheir religion and natural affection, seeing all men hunt after their\r\nparticular advantages, and none minding sincerely and self-deniedly\r\nthe common good, which gave him a real distaste of the country and\r\nservice; resolving from that time forward to disengage himself out\r\nof it as soon as possible he could get it done, and that the service\r\ncould allow of.”[619] Mackay, however, failed in obtaining even a\r\ntemporary leave of absence during the winter, by the intrigues of\r\nLord Melville and Viscount Tarbet, who, as he says, suspecting an\r\ninterview with William, who was then in Holland, to be the object of\r\nhis proposed visit thither, were afraid that he would induce William\r\nto adopt a system different from that hitherto followed in the\r\nmanagement of Scottish affairs.\r\n\r\nMackay finding that he would not succeed in his application for\r\nleave of absence, began to apply himself with great perseverance\r\nto accomplish his long-desired project of erecting a fort at\r\nInverlochy, capable of containing 1,000 or 1,200 men, to keep the\r\nwestern Highlanders in check. In a communication which he made to\r\nKing William on the subject, he requested to be supplied with three\r\nfrigates of about 30 guns each, 10 or 12 ships of burden, and 3\r\nor 4 dozen of large boats, 3,000 muskets, 400 _chevaux de frise_,\r\nand 2,000 spades, shovels, and pickaxes, with money sufficient to\r\npurchase two months’ provisions for 3,000 or 4,000 men. On receiving\r\nthese supplies he proposed to march with this force through Argyle\r\nabout the end of March, as far as Dunstaffnage, where he meant to\r\nembark his men in the ships, and thence proceed to Inverlochy, and\r\nland them under the protection of the guns of the ships of war.\r\nNo notice, however, was taken of this proposal either by William\r\nor his ministers, notwithstanding that its importance was urged\r\nin repeated letters from Mackay, who, in consequence, grew quite\r\nimpatient, and threatened to throw up his commission. At length the\r\nprivy council having, at his request, written a letter to the king\r\non the subject, he ordered the frigates to be sent down, with some\r\narms and ammunition, and implements for commencing the work; but\r\nthe required supply of money was not forthcoming, without which the\r\nexpedition could not be undertaken. Anxious, however, to get the\r\nfort erected with as little delay as possible, Mackay offered to the\r\nprivy council to proceed to Inverlochy with a select detachment of\r\n600 men, provided they would give him provisions for three months;\r\nbut although a sum of five or six hundred pounds would have almost\r\nsufficed for this purpose, the council pleaded the impossibility of\r\nraising the money.[620] In this emergency he applied to the city\r\nof Glasgow, the magistrates of which undertook to hire vessels for\r\ntransporting the detachment, and to furnish him with the necessary\r\nprovisions, and such articles as he might require for completing\r\nthe fort, in addition to those sent down from England.[621] Major\r\nFerguson, who was appointed to command this expedition, repaired\r\nto Glasgow; but he was detained there about five weeks waiting\r\nfor the provisions. The news, however, of such an armament being\r\nin preparation, and a report purposely circulated by Mackay,\r\nthat it was much larger than it actually was, having reached the\r\nHighlands, had the effect of preventing many of the Islanders and\r\nthe inhabitants of the adjoining mainland from joining Major-general\r\nBuchan, who took the field in April 1690.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of this officer, the Highlanders had resolved to\r\nplace themselves under the command of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel,\r\nhaving, in consequence of their defeat at Dunkeld, lost confidence\r\nin Cannon as a commander. After that disaster, Lochiel and the other\r\nJacobite chiefs had represented to James the precarious state of\r\nhis affairs in Scotland, and the necessity there was for sending\r\nthem aid; but James was too much occupied with preparations for\r\nresisting a threatened invasion of Ireland, by his son-in-law, to\r\nattend much to his Scottish concerns. He, however, sent over a vessel\r\nwith some clothes, arms, ammunition, and provisions, and a few Irish\r\nofficers, among whom was Major-general Buchan, with a commission, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the Jacobite forces in Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn Buchan’s arrival, a meeting of the chiefs and principal officers\r\nwas held at Keppoch, to deliberate upon the course they ought to\r\npursue. As no reinforcement had arrived from Ireland, and as the\r\nplot between the Jacobites and the disappointed chiefs of the\r\nPresbyterians, which had raised the expectations of King James’s\r\npartizans, had been discovered, the meeting was divided in opinion,\r\nupon the expediency of renewing hostilities. Some, thinking the cause\r\nquite desperate, proposed to submit to the government, which they\r\nknew was quite disposed to grant them the most favourable terms;\r\nbut this proposition was warmly resisted by Lochiel, who had great\r\ninfluence with his fellow chiefs. He stated that he had adhered\r\nto the cause of Charles II. at a time when it was more desperate\r\nthan that of his royal brother now was, who was still at the head\r\nof an army in Ireland, and who had many friends in Britain, ready\r\nto declare themselves, when a fit opportunity offered; that under\r\nthese circumstances, he considered they would disgrace themselves,\r\nif they abandoned the cause they had pledged themselves to defend,\r\nand that for his own part he would neither listen to terms from\r\nthe government, nor lay down his arms, without an express order\r\nfrom King James himself. In consequence of this declaration, the\r\nmeeting unanimously resolved to continue the war; but as the labours\r\nof the spring season were not over, they postponed the muster of\r\nthe clans, till those should be completed; and in the mean time\r\ndirected Major-general Buchan, to employ the interval in beating\r\nup the enemy’s quarters, along the borders of the lowlands, for\r\nwhich purpose a detachment of 1,200 foot was to be placed at his\r\ndisposal.[622]\r\n\r\nWhen Mackay heard that Buchan had taken the field, he ordered Sir\r\nThomas Livingston,--whom he had despatched north from Aberdeen to\r\nInverness, with his regiment, in the month of January, to watch\r\nthe motions of the Highlanders,--to keep a sharp outlook after\r\nBuchan, who, it was supposed, would probably make a descent upon the\r\nlowlands of Moray or Banff. Sir Thomas had at this time, besides\r\nhis own regiment of dragoons, three regiments of foot, and some\r\ntroops of horse, under his command, posted in and about the town of\r\nInverness. Hearing that Buchan was marching through Lochaber and\r\nBadenoch, Livingston made two successive marches up the country,\r\nin the direction Buchan was said to be advancing, but on both\r\noccasions, from the great difficulty he experienced in obtaining\r\nprovender for his horses, and provisions for his troops, he was\r\nobliged to return to Inverness without seeing Buchan, or hearing\r\nanything concerning him. Having ascertained that the feeling of\r\nhostility towards the government was rapidly extending, and that it\r\nhad even reached the clans, who had hitherto, in appearance at least,\r\nshown themselves favourably inclined to the revolution, Livingston,\r\nthereupon, despatched a letter to Mackay, acquainting him of the\r\ncircumstance, and stating that if Buchan was not speedily opposed,\r\nhe was afraid that by far the greater part of the northern counties\r\nwould join him. That he might obtain early intelligence of Buchan’s\r\nmotions, and avoid the difficulties he had experienced in his former\r\nmarches for want of provisions, Livingston took up a position eight\r\nmiles from Inverness, with a select body of 1,200 men, consisting\r\nof his own regiment, which amounted to 300 men, 400 of Leslie’s\r\nregiment, a company of 100 of Lord Reay’s Highlanders, 300 of Grant’s\r\nHighlanders, and two troops of horse.[623]\r\n\r\nOn receiving Livingston’s despatch, Mackay sent orders to the\r\ndifferent detachments which lay at Stirling, Glasgow, Dundee, and\r\nother places, amounting together to 3,000 men, to assemble without\r\ndelay at Perth, that they might be in readiness, should a general\r\nrising in favour of King James take place in the north, to support\r\nLivingston, and to serve as a check upon the southern Highlands. He,\r\nat the same time, directed Lieutenant-colonel Buchan, brother of King\r\nJames’s general, who commanded the forces in the city and county\r\nof Aberdeen, consisting of a battalion of Ramsay’s regiment, the\r\nCameronian regiment, and five troops of horse and dragoons, to march\r\nupon any point Livingston should direct.[624]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Major-general Buchan was advancing through Badenoch\r\nwith the design of marching down Speyside into the Duke of Gordon’s\r\ncountry, where he expected to be joined by some of the vassals of\r\nthat nobleman. At Culnakill he held a council of war to determine\r\nwhether to take up a position in that neighbourhood, where they\r\nwould be secure from the attacks of Livingston’s cavalry, or proceed\r\nfarther down the Spey. As Buchan’s force did not exceed 800 men,\r\nand as they were aware that a large force of horse and foot lay at\r\nInverness, the Highland officers were unanimously of opinion that\r\nthey should not advance beyond Culnakill, but should march the\r\nfollowing day to Glenlochy, and encamp among the adjoining woods.\r\nBuchan, who appears to have been as incapable of conducting a\r\nHighland force, and as ignorant of the mode of warfare pursued by\r\nthe Highlanders as Cannon, his predecessor, now second in command,\r\nrejecting the Highland officers’ advice, on the following day marched\r\ndown the Spey as far as Cromdale, where he encamped on the last day\r\nof April.[625]\r\n\r\nLivingston was, at this time, lying within eight miles of Strathspey,\r\non the grounds of the laird of Grant, where he received notice the\r\nsame day from a captain in Grant’s regiment, who, with a company\r\nof men, held possession for the government of Balloch, now Grant\r\ncastle, in the vicinity of Cromdale, that Buchan was marching down\r\nStrathspey. Desirous of attacking him before he should have an\r\nopportunity of being joined by the country people, Livingston marched\r\noff towards the Spey, in the afternoon, and continued his march till\r\nhe arrived within two miles of Balloch castle. As it was already\r\ndark, and the night far advanced, and as a difficult pass lay between\r\nhim and the castle, Livingston proposed to encamp during the night;\r\nbut not finding a convenient place, he, by the persuasion of one of\r\nhis officers who was acquainted with the pass, and who undertook to\r\nconduct him safely through it, renewed his march, and arrived at\r\nthe top of the hill above the castle at two o’clock in the morning.\r\nBuchan’s men were then reposing in fancied security near Lethindie,\r\non the adjoining plain of Cromdale, and the fires of their camp,\r\nwhich were pointed out by the captain of the castle to Livingston,\r\nshowed him that he was much nearer the enemy than he had any idea\r\nof. Mackay says, that had Livingston been aware that the Highlanders\r\nwere encamped so near the pass, he would not have ventured through\r\nit during the night, having little confidence in the country people;\r\nnor would the enemy, had they suspected Livingston’s march, left\r\ntheir former station and encamped upon an open plain, a considerable\r\ndistance from any secure position, “just as if they had been led\r\nthither by the hand as an ox to the slaughter.”[626]\r\n\r\nAs several gentlemen of the adjoining country had sought an asylum in\r\nthe castle on hearing of Buchan’s advance, the commander, in order\r\nto prevent any knowledge of Livingston’s approach being communicated\r\nto the Highlanders, had taken the precaution to shut the gates of\r\nthe castle, and to prohibit all egress; so that the Highlanders were\r\nas ignorant of Livingston’s arrival as he had previously been of\r\ntheir encampment at Cromdale. Such being the case, the commander\r\nof the castle advised him to attack the Highlanders without delay,\r\nand he himself offered to conduct the troops into the plain. This\r\nproposition having been acceded to, the troops were allowed half an\r\nhour to refresh themselves, after which they marched down through the\r\nvalley of Auchinarrow to the river. Finding a ford below Dellachaple,\r\nguarded by 100 Highlanders, Livingston left a detachment of foot\r\nand a few dragoons to amuse them, while, with his main body, led\r\nby some gentlemen of the name of Grant on horseback, he marched to\r\nanother ford through a covered way, a mile farther down the river,\r\nwhich he crossed at the head of three troops of dragoons, and a\r\ntroop of horse, a company of his Highlanders forming the advanced\r\nguard. After he reached the opposite bank of the Spey, he perceived\r\nthe Highlanders, who had received notice of his approach from their\r\nadvanced guards at the upper ford, in great confusion, and in\r\nmotion towards the hills. He thereupon sent orders to a part of his\r\nregiment, and another troop of horse to cross the river and join\r\nhim; but, without waiting for them, he galloped off at full speed\r\ntowards the hills, so as to get between the fugitives--the greater\r\npart of whom were almost naked--and the hills, and intercept them\r\nin their retreat. The cavalry were accompanied by the company of\r\nHighlanders which had crossed the river, and who are said to have\r\noutrun their mounted companions, a circumstance which induced the\r\nflying Highlanders, on arriving at the foot of the hill of Cromdale,\r\nto make a stand; but, on the approach of Livingston and the remainder\r\nof his dragoons and horse, they again took to their heels. They\r\nturned, however, frequently round upon their pursuers, and defended\r\nthemselves with their swords and targets with great bravery. A thick\r\nfog, which, coming down the side of the mountain, enveloped the\r\nfugitives, compelled Livingston to discontinue the pursuit, and even\r\nto beat a retreat. According to Mackay, the Highlanders had 400 men\r\nkilled and taken prisoners, while Livingston did not lose a single\r\nman, and only 7 or 8 horses; but Balcarras states his loss at about\r\n100 killed, and several prisoners; and the author of the “Memoirs\r\nof Dundee” says, that many of Livingston’s dragoons fell.[627] A\r\nparty of the Camerons and Macleans, who had in the flight separated\r\nfrom their companions in arms, crossed the Spey the following day,\r\nbut, being pursued by some of Livingston’s men, were overtaken and\r\ndispersed on the moor of Granish near Aviemore, where some of them\r\nwere killed. The rest took shelter in Craigelachie, and, being joined\r\nby Keppoch and his Highlanders, made an attempt to seize the castle\r\nof Lochinclan in Rothiemurchus, but were repulsed with loss by the\r\nproprietor and his tenants.[628]\r\n\r\nThe news of the disaster at Cromdale was received with feelings of\r\ndismay by the partisans of King James at Edinburgh, who began to\r\nregret that they had not embraced an offer which had been made by\r\nKing William for a cessation of arms. On the other hand, the friends\r\nof the government were elated with Livingston’s success, and hastened\r\nthe long delayed expedition to Inverlochy, under Major Ferguson,\r\nwhich accordingly set sail from Greenock on the 15th of May. Having\r\nobtained the consent of King William to march into Lochaber, Mackay\r\nmade preparations for the expedition; and, although the Earl of\r\nMelville, the commissioner to the Scottish parliament, gave him\r\nnotice of some dangerous plots against the government both in England\r\nand Scotland, which might require the presence of a large force in\r\nthe lowlands to check, yet, as he considered the subjugation of\r\nthe Highlands of primary importance, he resolved to proceed on his\r\nexpedition; and, accordingly, on the 18th of June, marched from Perth\r\nat the head of about 3,000 horse and foot. As his route to Inverlochy\r\nwould bring him within a short day’s march of the enemy, and as he\r\nwas desirous--agreeably, as he says, to a military maxim, “without\r\nnecessity, to put nothing to an apparent hazard when the success is\r\nof great importance,”--to avoid an engagement in a country full\r\nof defiles and difficult passes till he should join the forces in\r\nthe north under Sir Thomas Livingston, he resolved to march towards\r\nStrathspey, and thence through Badenoch into Lochaber. To conceal\r\nfrom the enemy his design of marching north, after entering Athole,\r\nhe made a movement as if he intended to enter Badenoch by the nearest\r\nroute, and then turning suddenly to the right, took the road to\r\nStrathspey. Having joined Livingston in Strathspey on the 26th of\r\nJune, the united forces, after a day’s rest, marched towards Badenoch.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders who, after their dispersion at Cromdale, had returned\r\nto their homes, had re-assembled on hearing of Mackay’s approach;\r\nbut, from the fewness of their numbers, they made no attempt to\r\nobstruct his passage through Badenoch. Being informed that they had\r\ntaken possession of a strait and difficult pass through which they\r\nexpected him to march, he, on the 1st of July,--the very day on which\r\nthe celebrated battle of the Boyne was fought,--made a feint with\r\nfour troops of horse and dragoons as if he intended to pass that\r\nway, for the purpose of deceiving the enemy; after which he suddenly\r\nchanged his march to the left. After traversing mountains and bogs,\r\nhe entered Lochaber by Glenspean the same night, and arrived at\r\nInverlochy on the 3d of the month.[629]\r\n\r\nThe site of the old fort, which had been erected by Oliver Cromwell,\r\ndid not please Mackay, as it was commanded by a neighbouring hill;\r\nbut, as a more eligible one could not be found, he commenced the work\r\non the 5th of the month, and, in eleven days the wall was raised\r\nto its full intended height of twenty feet from the bottom of the\r\nfosse, and pallisaded round with a _chemin couvert_ and glacis.\r\nHaving finished the fort, which was named Fort-William, in honour\r\nof the king, he was about proceeding to send a detachment into\r\nMull to reduce that island, but received despatches from the privy\r\ncouncil announcing the defeat of the English and Dutch fleets, and\r\nrequiring his return to the South as soon as possible, with as many\r\nof his forces as could be spared, in consequence of an expected\r\ninvasion from France. He therefore marched from Inverlochy for the\r\nSouth on the 18th, leaving behind him 1,000 men in garrison in the\r\nnew fort. He arrived in Badenoch on the 20th by easy marches, and\r\nleaving his army in camp the whole of the 21st to rest themselves,\r\nhe went with a party of 150 horse and dragoons to inspect Ruthven\r\ncastle which the Jacobite forces had burnt the preceding year. Here\r\nhe left the company of Lord Reay’s Highlanders with instructions to\r\nthe commander to raise a breastwork round an old square wall, within\r\nwhich the garrison might remain secure against surprise or attack.\r\nHe then descended into Athole, and arrived at Perth on the 26th of\r\nJuly, being little more than five weeks since he set out on his long\r\nprojected expedition.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence Major-general Buchan and Colonel Cannon, each at\r\nthe head of a select body of cavalier horse, had been scouring the\r\nlow country. The latter, in particular, with 200 horse, had attacked\r\nLord Cardross’s dragoons who were stationed in Menteith, and had\r\npursued them down as far as the park of Stirling. On his arrival at\r\nPerth, Mackay being informed of the proceedings of Cannon’s party,\r\nsent orders to the troops at Stirling to march out in quest of them,\r\nwhile he himself, after receiving a supply of biscuit from Dundee,\r\nresolved to march from Perth with a detachment for the purpose of\r\nintercepting them; but Cannon had passed through the heights of\r\nAthole towards Braemar before the troops at Stirling left that town.\r\nMackay followed after them for two days with a force of 1,000 men,\r\nbut was unable to overtake them. Being unprovided for a longer march,\r\nhe returned on the third day to Stirling, whence he despatched three\r\ntroops of Cardross’s dragoons, and one of horse, to support the\r\nMaster of Forbes who was guarding Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBuchan and Cannon having united their forces, and being joined by\r\nFarquharson of Inverey, at the head of 500 or 600 of the Braemar\r\nHighlanders, descended into the adjoining low parts of Aberdeenshire,\r\nMearns, and Banff, to unite themselves to some of the country\r\nJacobite gentlemen, leaving behind them a body of 160 men, to block\r\nup Abergeldie, in which Mackay still kept a garrison. They were at\r\nfirst opposed on their descent into the low country, by the Master\r\nof Forbes, and Colonel Jackson, with eight troops of cavalry, which\r\nwas fully more than sufficient to have repulsed in a level country,\r\nany body the Highlanders could then bring into the field. Buchan,\r\nhowever, having purposely magnified the appearance of his forces, by\r\nranging his foot over a large extent of ground, and interspersing\r\nhis baggage and baggage horses among them, inspired the Master of\r\nForbes and Jackson with such dread, that they considered it prudent\r\nto retire before a foe apparently so formidable in appearance, and\r\ntheir fears increasing after they had begun their retreat, they set\r\noff towards Aberdeen at full gallop, and never looked behind, till\r\nthey had entered the town, after a race of upwards of 20 miles.[630]\r\nBuchan, who had no immediate design upon Aberdeen, followed the\r\nalarmed cavalry, and such was the effect of the retreat upon some of\r\nthe neighbouring noblemen and gentlemen, that they joined Buchan in\r\nthe pursuit. The inhabitants were thrown into a state of the greatest\r\nalarm at this occurrence, and the necessary means of defence were\r\nadopted, but Buchan made no attempt to enter the town.\r\n\r\nWhen Mackay received intelligence of this “disorder,” as he terms\r\nthe flight of Forbes and Jackson, he instantly despatched Colonel\r\nCunningham with 300 men, and two troops of cavalry, to the north to\r\njoin Jackson; but Cunningham was unable to effect a junction, as\r\nCannon lay encamped between him and Jackson. As the fears of a French\r\ninvasion had subsided, Mackay, on hearing of Cunningham’s failure,\r\nmarched north himself in such haste that he carried neither baggage\r\nnor provisions along with him; but on his way north, he learned that\r\nBuchan had left the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, and was marching\r\nsouthward. On hearing of Mackay’s advance, Buchan drew off his men\r\nto the right, and crossed the hills. On arriving at the Dee, he left\r\nCunningham with a detachment at the castle of Aboyne, and proceeded\r\nwith his own division to raise the siege of Abergeldie. In the course\r\nof this march, a party of 60 dragoons, under Major Mackay, fell in\r\namong the hills, with a body of 200 Highlanders, under Inverey, all\r\nof whom were either killed or made prisoners. The chief himself made\r\na very narrow escape, having been trampled under the horses’ feet,\r\nand left for dead on the field. Mackay also laid waste the fertile\r\ncountry about Abergeldie, to the extent of twelve miles round, and\r\nburnt from 1,200 to 1,400 houses, by way of reprisal, for having\r\nblocked up the garrison.[631]\r\n\r\nHaving united all his forces in the north, with the exception\r\nof those which lay at Inverness, Mackay marched as far north as\r\nStrathdon, where he was told that the greater part of the north was\r\nhostile to the government, and was ready to rise in arms, which\r\ninformation made him at once resolve to proceed north with all\r\npossible haste in order to get Buchan’s force dispersed, before any\r\ngeneral rising should take place. Leaving therefore his foot behind,\r\nhe proceeded north with his cavalry in great haste, and in the course\r\nof his march was informed that Buchan was not only on his way north,\r\nbut that he expected to be joined by several thousand Highlanders.\r\nHe, therefore, continued his march with great celerity, allowing\r\nhis men no more time than was absolutely necessary for refreshing\r\ntheir horses, and arrived within four hours’ march of the enemy,\r\nbefore they received any notice of his approach. Buchan had reached\r\nInverness, and was only waiting for the Earl of Seaforth’s and other\r\nHighlanders, whom he expected to join him in attacking the town;\r\nbut on hearing of Mackay’s advance, he crossed the river Ness, and\r\nretired along the north side of the Loch.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Seaforth, afraid of the consequences which might result\r\nto him personally, for the part he had acted, sent his mother, the\r\nCountess Dowager of Seaforth, and Mackenzie of Coul, to Mackay, to\r\ninform him that he would accede to such conditions as might be agreed\r\nupon between them and Mackay. An agreement was accordingly entered\r\ninto, by which it was stipulated, that the earl should deliver\r\nhimself into Mackay’s hands, to be kept as a prisoner at Inverness,\r\ntill the privy council should decide as to his future disposal; and\r\nto conceal this arrangement from the Jacobite party, it was farther\r\nagreed that the earl should allow himself to be seized as if by\r\nsurprise, by a party of horse under Major Mackay, at one of his seats\r\nduring the night. The earl, however, disappointed the party sent\r\nout to apprehend him, in excuse for which, both he and his mother,\r\nin letters to Mackay, pleaded the state of his health, which they\r\nalleged would suffer from imprisonment. The earl cannot certainly\r\nbe blamed for having demurred placing himself at the unconditional\r\ndisposal of such a body as the privy council of Scotland, some of\r\nwhom would not have hesitated to sacrifice him, if by doing so they\r\ncould have obtained a share of his estates.\r\n\r\nMackay was so irritated at the deception which had been practised\r\nupon him, that he resolved to treat the earl’s vassals “with all\r\nthe rigour of military execution.” Having, however, a warm feeling\r\nfor the earl’s friends, on account of their being “all Protestants,\r\nand none of the most dangerous enemies,” as he says, and being more\r\ndesirous to obtain possession of the earl’s person than to ruin his\r\nfriends, he caused information of his intentions upon the earl’s\r\nlands to be sent to Seaforth’s camp, by some of his own party,\r\nas if from a feeling of friendship to him. Contrary to Mackay’s\r\nanticipations, Seaforth surrendered himself, and was committed\r\nprisoner to the castle of Inverness.[632] About this time the\r\nEarl of Argyle--who had fled to Holland in 1685, on his father’s\r\nexecution, but returned with the Prince of Orange, and was reinstated\r\nby the Convention in his father’s estates and title--with a force of\r\n1,900 foot, and 60 dragoons, invaded Mull, the inhabitants of which\r\ntook the oaths of allegiance to the government, and delivered up\r\ntheir arms. He was, however, from the state of the weather, obliged\r\nto leave the island, before effecting the reduction of Duart castle,\r\nand left 300 men behind him to keep it in check. Maclean himself,\r\nwith a few of his friends, took refuge on Carnburrow, an inaccessible\r\nrock near Mull.\r\n\r\nKing James’s affairs had now become utterly desperate in Scotland,\r\nand his defeat at the battle of the Boyne, on the 1st of July,\r\n1690, almost annihilated his hopes in Ireland. Unable to collect\r\nany considerable body of men together, Buchan, after wandering\r\nthrough Lochaber, dismissed the few that still remained with him,\r\nand along with Sir George Barclay, Lieutenant-colonel Graham, and\r\nother officers, took up his abode with Macdonell of Glengary, Cannon\r\nand his officers retiring to the isles, under the protection of Sir\r\nDonald Macdonald. In their retreats, these officers who had displayed\r\nthe most heroic attachment to the cause of the unfortunate king,\r\nunder the most trying circumstances, still continued to cherish some\r\ndistant hopes of his restoration, and were prepared to enter upon any\r\nservice, however hazardous, which might lead to such a consummation.\r\n\r\nAt length, seeing no chance of making a successful effort in favour\r\nof James, they, in connexion with the chiefs, sent over the Earl of\r\nDunfermline to France in the spring of 1691, to represent to him\r\nthe state of matters, and to receive his commands. Having received\r\ninstructions from his majesty to enter into a negotiation with the\r\ngovernment, a meeting of the principal officers and the Jacobite\r\nchiefs was held at Achallader in Glenorchy on the 30th of June,\r\nwhich was attended by the Earl of Breadalbane on the part of the\r\ngovernment, at which a cessation of hostilities was agreed upon till\r\nthe 1st of October. To get the chiefs to submit to the government,\r\nmoney and other inducements were held out to them by Breadalbane, at\r\nwhose disposal a sum of about £15,000 or £20,000 had been placed\r\nby King William. They, however, declined to come to any definite\r\narrangement at this time, and requested liberty to send Sir George\r\nBarclay and Major Menzies to France, to obtain the sanction of King\r\nJames, to enter into a treaty with the government, a request which\r\nwas reluctantly granted. After learning from these officers the\r\nmiseries to which the clans were reduced, and the utter hopelessness\r\nof attempting another campaign under existing circumstances, James\r\nallowed them to make the best terms they could with the government.\r\nAccordingly, and in terms of a proclamation issued by the government\r\non the 27th of August, 1691, promising an indemnity to all persons\r\nwho had been in arms, and who should take an oath of allegiance to\r\nthe government before the 1st of January 1692; all the chiefs, with\r\none unfortunate exception, which will be afterwards noticed, gave in\r\ntheir adherence, and took the oath within the prescribed time. Buchan\r\nand Cannon with their officers, in terms of an agreement with the\r\ngovernment, were transported to France, to which country they had\r\nasked and obtained permission from their royal master to retire, as\r\nthey could no longer be serviceable to him in their native land.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry that it is beyond the province of the present work,\r\neven did space permit, to give a detailed account of the heroic and\r\nalmost quixotically chivalrous conduct of Dundee’s officers, after\r\ntheir emigration to France. In order that they might not be a burden\r\non their royal master King James, they entered the French service,\r\nforming themselves into a company of “private sentinels” or common\r\nsoldiers, four of their number being appointed officers, whose\r\nconduct gives “no opportunity of speaking well of them.”[633] They\r\nnumbered only about 150, and so effectively performed their duty\r\nin the service of France, that, unsuited as they were for the hard\r\nlife of common soldiers, and cheated by their heartless officers\r\nof the few comforts provided for them, in a very short time “the\r\nearth closed over the last remains of the gentlemen-adventurers who\r\nfollowed the banner of Dundee.”[634] They bore all their hardships\r\nwith cheerfulness and even gaiety, winning the tears and love of the\r\nwomen wherever they passed, and the respect of their French comrades.\r\nThe following incident must suffice as an example of their fearless\r\nhardihood.\r\n\r\n“The Germans had made a lodgement in an island in the Rhine (near\r\nStrasburg). The French, from an opinion that the river was impassable\r\nwithout boats, had ordered a number for the passage. Among other\r\ntroops intended for the service, this company was ordered to keep\r\na station opposite to the island until the boats should arrive;\r\nbut finding, upon examination, the ford, though difficult, not\r\nimpassable, they, according to the custom of the Highlanders in\r\nwading through rivers, joining their hands together, and entering\r\nthe river in a line with its current, the strongest men in the upper\r\npart, and the weaker in the under, so that those who were highest\r\nup the stream broke all its force, and tying their arms and clothes\r\non their shoulders, passed to the island in sight of both armies\r\non the opposite bank, and drove ten times their number from the\r\nlodgement. The French cried out in admiration, ‘A gentleman, in\r\nwhatever station, is still a gentleman.’ ‘Le gentilhomme est toujours\r\ngentilhomme.’ The place is called _l’Isle d’Ecosse_ to this day.”[635]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[608] _Memoirs_, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[609] Mackay, pp. 63, 64.\r\n\r\n[610] _Memoirs_, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[611] _Memoirs of Dundee._\r\n\r\n[612] _Memoirs_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n[613] Idem.\r\n\r\n[614] _Scotland_, vol. i. p. 141.\r\n\r\n[615] Balcarras.\r\n\r\n[616] _Life and Diary of Colonel Blackader._\r\n\r\n[617]\r\n  “We, Lord James Murray, Patrick Stewart of Ballechan, Sir John\r\n  M’Lean, Sir Donald M’Donald, Sir Ewen Cameron, Glengarie,\r\n  Benbecula, Sir Alexander M’Lean, Appin, Enveray, Keppoch,\r\n  Glencoe, Strowan, Calochele, Lieut.-Col.

The Christian means (as you say in your last) you\r\n  make use of to advance the good cause by, is evident to all\r\n  the world, and the argument you use to move us to address your\r\n  government, is consequential to the whole; for instead of telling\r\n  us what good Christians, men of honour, good subjects, and good\r\n  neighbours, ought to do, you tell us in both your letters, that\r\n  his Majesty has hot wars in Ireland, and cannot in haste come\r\n  to us, which, though it were as true as we know it is not, is\r\n  only an argument from safety and interest. And that you may\r\n  know the sentiments of men of honour, we declare to you and all\r\n  the world, we scorn your usurper, and the indemnities of his\r\n  government; and to save you farther trouble by your frequent\r\n  invitations, we assure you that we are satisfied our king will\r\n  take his own time and way to manage his dominions and punish\r\n  his rebels; and although he should send no assistance to us at\r\n  all, we will die with our swords in our hands before we fail in\r\n  our loyalty and sworn allegiance to our sovereign. Judge, then,\r\n  what effect Duke Hamilton’s letter has upon us; but you have got\r\n  an honourable father for this story from Ireland, and although\r\n  we can better tell you how matters go in Ireland, and that we\r\n  pity those on whom such stories have influence, yet we have no\r\n  orders to offer conditions to any rebels; we allow them and his\r\n  grace to believe on and take your measures by your success, till\r\n  his Majesty’s farther orders. Sir, We thank you for the good\r\n  meaning of your invitation, (though we are confident you had no\r\n  hope of success.) And we will shortly endeavour to give you a\r\n  requital--and those of us who live in islands have already seen\r\n  and defied the Prince of Orange his frigates.

Appendix to Memoirs, No. 73._ Mackay was directed by the privy\r\ncouncil, by warrant, dated 7th Oct. 1690, “to transport the person of\r\nColin, Earl of Seaforth, with safety from Inverness to Edinburgh, in\r\nsuch way and manner, as he should think fit.” In consequence of this\r\nremoval, he was entered a prisoner within the castle of Edinburgh,\r\non 6th Nov. following, whence he was liberated on 7th Jan. 1692, on\r\nfinding caution to appear when called upon. He was bound not to go\r\nten miles beyond Edinburgh. He was again imprisoned, but made his\r\nescape, and was apprehended at Pencaitland, on 7th May 1692, and\r\nagain kept in close confinement, within the castle of Edinburgh.\r\nHe was afterwards liberated, on giving security for his peaceable\r\nbehaviour.--_Records of the Privy Council._\r\n\r\n[633] For details, see _An Account of Dundee’s officers after they\r\nwent to France_ in _Miscellanea Scotica_.\r\n\r\n[634] Burton’s _Scotland from Revolution_, vol. i. p. 153.\r\n\r\n[635] Dalrymple’s _Memoirs_, vol. i. part ii. p. 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1691-1702.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--William III., 1688-1703.\r\n\r\n  Negotiations with the Highland chiefs--Massacre of Glencoe\r\n  --Master of Stair--King William--Subsequent enquiry--State\r\n  of Highlands during William’s reign--Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1690 and 1691 the Jacobites caused the government much trouble\r\nand anxiety by their ceaseless plotting to get up an insurrection,\r\nin which they were to be assisted by supplies from France. Many\r\nmen, professedly loyal to King William, gave, from various motives,\r\ntheir secret countenance to these attempts; and the Highlanders\r\nespecially proved a galling and distracting thorn in the side of the\r\ngovernment. As early as 1690, Lord Tarbet, (subsequently Earl of\r\nCromarty,) proposed a scheme for the quieting of the Highlands, which\r\nLord Breadalbane offered to carry into execution; but it was at the\r\ntime abandoned. In 1691, however, negotiations were again renewed,\r\nand, as has been seen, Breadalbane was intrusted with a sum of money\r\nto distribute among the chiefs, or rather to buy up the claims which\r\nArgyle and other superiors had over their feudal vassals, and which\r\nwas the real cause of the strife and dissatisfaction existing in the\r\nHighlands. The Secretary of State, Sir John Dalrymple, known as the\r\nMaster of Stair, son of the Earl of Stair, appears latterly to have\r\nbeen at the bottom of the scheme, and was certainly most anxious that\r\nit should be successfully and speedily carried out, having at first\r\napparently no thought of resorting to measures of cruel severity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Earl of Breadalbane.\r\n\r\nFrom Original Painting in possession of Lady Elizabeth Pringle.]\r\n\r\nNot much appears to have resulted from the meeting which Breadalbane\r\nhad with the chiefs at Achallader; indeed, he showed very little\r\nof an earnest desire for conciliation, as his threatening conduct\r\ninduced Alexander Macdonald, or MacIan, of Glencoe, to leave the\r\nmeeting abruptly for his own safety. Between Breadalbane, who was\r\na Campbell, and Macdonald much bad blood appears to have existed;\r\nindeed, nothing but the bitterest hatred was cherished by the whole\r\ntribe of the Macdonalds to the Campbells, as the latter had from\r\ntime to time, oftener by foul than by fair means, ousted the former\r\nfrom their once extensive possessions. The Macdonalds of Glencoe\r\nespecially, still considered the lands and property of the Campbells\r\nas their own, and without hesitation supplied their wants out of\r\nthe numerous herds of the latter. It was some recent raid of this\r\nsort which roused the wrath of Breadalbane; and on poor Macdonald’s\r\nhead lighted all the blame and the punishment of the ineffectual\r\nnegotiation. What became of the money has never been clearly\r\nascertained; but much can be inferred from Breadalbane’s answer\r\nwhen asked afterwards by Lord Nottingham to account for it, “The\r\nmoney is spent, the Highlands are quiet, and this is the only way of\r\naccounting among friends.”\r\n\r\nLike many of his contemporaries, Breadalbane attached himself\r\nopenly to King William’s government only because it was for the\r\ntime the winning side; while at the same time he professed secretly\r\nto be attached to the interest of the exiled King James. He told\r\nthe Highland chiefs that in urging them to enter into terms with\r\nthe government, he had their own interests and those of King James\r\nat heart; for there being then “no other appearance of relief, he\r\nthought they could not do better than sue for a cessation, which\r\nwould be a breathing to them, and give them time to represent their\r\ncircumstances to King James.”[636] A contemporary characterises him\r\nas being “cunning as a fox; wise as a serpent; but as slippery as an\r\neel. No government can trust him but where his own private interest\r\nis in view.”[637]\r\n\r\nAs the chiefs did not seem in any hurry to come to terms, a\r\nproclamation was issued, in August 1691, requiring them to take the\r\noath of allegiance before the 1st of January 1692, threatening all\r\nthose who did not comply with “letters of fire and sword.” This had\r\nthe proper effect, as, one by one, the chiefs swore fealty to the\r\ngovernment, Macdonald of Glencoe, from pride or some other reason,\r\nbeing the last to comply with the terms of the proclamation. The\r\ndifficulty in getting the chiefs to come to terms, and thus allowing\r\nthe government to pursue its other schemes without anxiety, seems\r\nat last to have irritated Sir John Dalrymple so much against them,\r\nthat latterly he eagerly desired that some, and especially the\r\nvarious tribes of Macdonalds, might hold out beyond the time, in\r\norder that an example might be made of them by putting into execution\r\nthe penalty attached to the non-fulfilment of the terms of the\r\nproclamation. In a letter to Breadalbane of Dec. 2d, he thinks “the\r\nclan Donald must be rooted out and Lochiel,” and is doubtful whether\r\nthe money “had been better employed to settle the Highlands, or to\r\nravage them.” In another written on the following day he mentions\r\nwith approval Breadalbane’s “mauling scheme,” artfully rousing the\r\nlatter’s indignation by speaking of the chiefs’ ungratefulness to\r\nhim, using at the same time the significant phrase _delenda est\r\nCarthago_. He and Breadalbane seemed however likely to be cheated of\r\ntheir vengeance, for even the obstinate and hated Mac Ian himself,\r\nafter holding out to the very last day, hastened to fulfil the\r\nrequirements of the proclamation, and thus place himself beyond the\r\npower of the strong arm of the law.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, 1691, Glencoe made his way to Fort-William,\r\nand presented himself to Colonel Hill the governor, asking him\r\nto administer the required oath of allegiance. The Colonel,\r\nhowever, declined to act, on the ground, that according to the\r\nproclamation, the civil magistrate alone could administer them.\r\nGlencoe remonstrated with Hill on account of the exigency of the\r\ncase, as there was not any magistrate whom he could reach before\r\nthe expiration of that day, but Hill persisted in asserting that\r\nit was out of his power to act in the matter. He, however advised\r\nGlencoe to proceed instantly to Inverary, giving him at the same\r\ntime a letter to Sir Colin Campbell of Ardkinglass, sheriff of\r\nArgyleshire, begging him to receive Glencoe as “a lost sheep,” and\r\nto administer to him the necessary oaths. Hill also gave Glencoe a\r\nletter of protection, and an assurance that no proceedings should be\r\ninstituted against him under the proclamation, till he should have an\r\nopportunity of laying his case before the king or the privy council.\r\n\r\nGlencoe left Fort-William immediately, and so great was his anxiety\r\nto reach Inverary with as little delay as possible, that although\r\nhis way lay through mountains almost impassable, and although the\r\ncountry was deeply covered with snow, he proceeded on his journey\r\nwithout even stopping to see his family, though he passed within half\r\na mile of his own house. On arriving at Inverary, Sir Colin Campbell\r\nwas absent, and he had to wait three days till his return, Sir Colin\r\nhaving been prevented from reaching Inverary sooner, on account of\r\nthe badness of the weather. As the time allowed by the proclamation\r\nfor taking the oaths had expired, Sir Colin declined at first to\r\nswear Glencoe, alleging that it would be of no use to take the\r\noaths; but Glencoe having first importuned him with tears to receive\r\nfrom him the oath of allegiance, and having thereafter threatened\r\nto protest against the sheriff should he refuse to act, Sir Colin\r\nyielded, and administered the oaths to Glencoe and his attendants\r\non the 6th of January. Glencoe, thereupon, returned home in perfect\r\nreliance that having done his utmost to comply with the injunction of\r\nthe government, he was free from danger.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Campbell transmitted to Colin Campbell,\r\nsheriff-clerk of Argyle, who was then in Edinburgh, the certificate\r\nof Glencoe’s oath on the same paper with other certificates, sending\r\nat the same time the letter which he had received from Hill. Campbell\r\nshowed this paper with Hill’s letter to several privy councillors,\r\namong whom was the Earl of Stair, all of whom were of opinion\r\nthat the certificate could not be received without a warrant from\r\nthe king. Instead, however, of laying the matter before the privy\r\ncouncil, or informing Glencoe of the rejection of the certificate,\r\nthat he might petition the king, Campbell gave in the paper to\r\nthe clerks of the council with Glencoe’s certificate “delete and\r\nobliterate.”\r\n\r\nWhether this was done at the instigation of Secretary Dalrymple, it\r\nis impossible to say; but it is not improbable that this man--who,\r\na few weeks before, had exulted[638] that as the winter was the\r\nonly season in which the Highlanders could not escape, they could\r\neasily be destroyed “in the cold long nights”--was not an indifferent\r\nspectator to Campbell’s proceedings. In fact, it appears that the\r\nsecretary contemplated the total extirpation of the clans, for,\r\nin a letter to Sir Thomas Livingston, commander of the forces in\r\nScotland, dated January 7th, he says, “You know in general that these\r\ntroops posted at Inverness and Inverlochie, will be ordered to take\r\nin the house of Innergarie, and to destroy entirely the country of\r\nLochaber, Lochiel’s lands, Keppoch’s, Glengarie’s, and Glencoe,” and\r\nhe adds, “I assure you your power shall be full enough, and I hope\r\nthe soldiers will not trouble the government with prisoners.” The\r\nMacdonalds were chiefly marked out by him for destruction, and after\r\nsaying, in a letter of the 9th, that he could have wished that they\r\n“had not divided” on the question of taking the oath of indemnity, he\r\nexpresses his regret to find that Keppoch and Glencoe were safe. When\r\nhe heard two days after from Argyle, that Glencoe had not managed to\r\ntake the oaths within the time prescribed, he expressed a joy which\r\nmight be called fiendish, and set himself busily to take proper\r\nadvantage of the opportunity.[639] _Delenda est Carthago._\r\n\r\nThat no time might be lost in enforcing the penalties in the\r\nproclamation, now that the time allowed for taking the oath of\r\nallegiance had expired, instructions of rather an equivocal nature,\r\nsigned and countersigned by the king on the 11th of January, were\r\nsent down by young Stair to Sir Thomas Livingston, enclosed in\r\na letter from the secretary of same date. By the instructions,\r\nLivingston was ordered “to march the troops against the rebels who\r\nhad not taken the benefit of the indemnity, and to destroy them by\r\nfire and sword;” but lest such a course might render them desperate,\r\nhe was _allowed_ to “give terms and quarters, but in this manner\r\nonly, that chieftains and heritors, or leaders, be prisoners of war,\r\ntheir lives only safe, and all other things in mercy, they taking the\r\noath of allegiance, and the community taking the oath of allegiance,\r\nand rendering their arms, and submitting to the government, are to\r\nhave quarters, and indemnity for their lives and fortunes, and to\r\nbe protected from the soldiers.” As a hint to Livingston how to act\r\nunder the discretionary power with which these instructions vested\r\nhim, Dalrymple says in his letter containing them, “I have no great\r\nkindness to Keppoch nor Glencoe, and it is well that people are in\r\nmercy, and then just now my Lord Argyle tells me that Glencoe hath\r\nnot taken the oath, at which I rejoice. It is a great work of charity\r\nto be exact in rooting out that damnable sect, the worst of the\r\nHighlands.”\r\n\r\nThe purport of this letter could not be misunderstood; but lest\r\nLivingston might not feel disposed to imbrue his hands in the blood\r\nof Glencoe and his people, additional instructions bearing the\r\ndate (in Stair’s handwriting) of January 16th, and also signed and\r\ncountersigned by King William, were despatched to Livingston by the\r\nMaster of Stair, ordering him to extirpate the whole clan. In the\r\nletter containing these instructions, Dalrymple informs Livingston\r\nthat “the king does not at all incline to receive any after the diet\r\nbut in mercy,” but he artfully adds, “but for a just example of\r\nvengeance, I entreat the thieving tribe of Glencoe may be rooted out\r\nto purpose.” Lest, however, Livingston might hesitate, a duplicate\r\nof these additional instructions[640] was sent at the same time by\r\nSecretary Dalrymple to Colonel Hill, the governor of Fort-William,\r\nwith a letter of an import similar to that sent to Livingston. From\r\nthe following extract it would appear that not only the Earl of\r\nBreadalbane, but also the Earl of Argyle, was privy to this infamous\r\ntransaction. “The Earls of Argyle and Breadalbane have promised that\r\nthey (the Macdonalds of Glencoe) shall have no retreat in their\r\nbounds, the passes to Rannoch would be secured, and the hazard\r\ncertified to the laird of Weems to reset them; in that case Argyle’s\r\ndetachment with a party that may be posted in Island Stalker must cut\r\nthem off.”\r\n\r\nPreparatory to putting the butchering warrant in execution, a party\r\nof Argyle’s regiment, to the number of 120 men, under the command\r\nof Captain Campbell of Glenlyon, was ordered to proceed to Glencoe,\r\nand take up their quarters there, about the end of January or\r\nbeginning of February. On approaching the Glen, they were met by\r\nJohn Macdonald, the elder son of the chief, at the head of about\r\n20 men, who demanded from Campbell the reason of his coming into a\r\npeaceful country with a military force; Glenlyon and two subalterns\r\nwho were with him explained that they came as friends, and that\r\ntheir sole object was to obtain suitable quarters, where they could\r\nconveniently collect the arrears of cess and hearth-money,--a new\r\ntax laid on by the Scottish parliament in 1690,--in proof of which,\r\nLieutenant Lindsay produced the instructions of Colonel Hill to that\r\neffect. They thereupon received a hearty welcome, and were hospitably\r\nentertained by Glencoe and his people till the fatal morning of the\r\nmassacre. Indeed, so familiar was Glenlyon, that scarcely a day\r\npassed that he did not visit the house of Alexander Macdonald, the\r\nyounger son of the chief, who was married to Glenlyon’s niece, the\r\nsister of Rob Roy, and take his “morning drink,” agreeably to the\r\nmost approved practice of Highland hospitality.\r\n\r\nIf Secretary Dalrymple imagined that Livingston was disinclined to\r\nfollow his instructions he was mistaken, for immediately on receipt\r\nof them he wrote Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who had been fixed upon\r\nby the secretary to be the executioner, expressing his satisfaction\r\nthat Glencoe had not taken the oath within the period prescribed, and\r\nurging him, if he wished to approve himself to the government, to\r\nexecute his commission with the utmost rigour, and “not to trouble\r\nthe government with prisoners.” In the meantime, the Master of Stair\r\nwas taking every precaution that the deed should be done suddenly\r\nand effectively, and accordingly, on the 13th of January he wrote\r\ntwo letters, one to Livingston, and the other to Hill, urging them\r\non. Addressing the former, he says, “I am glad Glencoe did not come\r\nin within the time prefixed; I hope what is done there may be in\r\nearnest, since the rest are not in a condition to draw together help.\r\nI think to harry (plunder) their cattle and burn their houses is but\r\nto render them desperate lawless men to rob their neighbours, but\r\nI believe you will be satisfied, it were a great advantage to the\r\nnation that thieving tribe were rooted out and cut off; it must be\r\nquietly done, otherwise they will make shift for both their men and\r\ntheir cattle.” And in his letter to Hill he says, “Pray, when the\r\nthing concerning Glencoe is resolved, let it be secret and sudden,\r\notherwise the men will shift you, and better not meddle with them\r\nthan not to do it to purpose, to cut off that nest of robbers who\r\nhave fallen in the mercy of the law, now when there is force and\r\nopportunity, whereby the king’s justice will be as conspicuous and\r\nuseful as his clemency to others. I apprehend the storm is so great\r\nthat for some time you can do little, but so soon as possible I know\r\nyou will be at work, for these false people will do nothing, but as\r\nthey see you in a condition to do with them.”\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of these fresh instructions from the secretary, Hill, on\r\nthe 12th of February, sent orders to Hamilton, forthwith to execute\r\nthe fatal commission. Accordingly, on the same day, Hamilton directed\r\nMajor Robert Duncanson of Argyle’s regiment to proceed immediately\r\nwith a detachment of that regiment to Glencoe, so as to reach the\r\npost which had been assigned him by five o’clock the following\r\nmorning, at which hour Hamilton promised to reach another post with\r\na party of Hill’s regiment. Whether Duncanson, who appears to have\r\nbeen a Campbell,[641] was averse to take an active personal part in\r\nthe bloody tragedy about to be enacted, is a question that cannot\r\nnow be solved; but it may have been from some repugnance to act in\r\nperson that immediately on receipt of Hamilton’s order, he despatched\r\nanother order from himself to Captain Campbell of Glenlyon, then\r\nliving in Glencoe, with instructions to fall upon the Macdonalds\r\nprecisely at five o’clock the following morning, and put all to the\r\nsword under seventy years of age.[642]\r\n\r\nGlenlyon appears to have been a man equal to any kind of loathsome\r\nwork, especially against a Macdonald; one who\r\n\r\n      “Could smile, and murder while he smiled.”\r\n\r\nWith this sanguinary order in his pocket, and with his mind made up\r\nunhesitatingly and rigorously to execute it, he did not hesitate\r\nto spend the eve of the massacre playing at cards with John and\r\nAlexander Macdonald, the sons of the chief, to wish them good night\r\nat parting, and to accept an invitation from Glencoe himself to dine\r\nwith him the following day. Little suspecting the intended butchery,\r\nGlencoe and his sons retired to rest at their usual hour; but early\r\nin the morning, while the preparations for the intended massacre\r\nwere going on, John Macdonald, the elder son of the chief, hearing\r\nthe sound of voices about his house, grew alarmed, and jumping out\r\nof bed threw on his clothes and went to Inverriggen, where Glenlyon\r\nwas quartered, to ascertain the cause of the unusual bustle which had\r\ninterrupted his nocturnal slumbers. To his great surprise he found\r\nthe soldiers all in motion, as if preparing for some enterprise,\r\nwhich induced him to inquire at Captain Campbell the object of\r\nthese extraordinary preparations at such an early hour. The anxiety\r\nwith which young Macdonald pressed his question, indicating a\r\nsecret distrust on his part, Campbell endeavoured by professions of\r\nfriendship to lull his suspicions, and pretended that his sole design\r\nwas to march against some of Glengarry’s men. As John Macdonald, the\r\nyounger son of Glencoe, was married to Glenlyon’s niece, that crafty\r\nknave referred to his connexion with the family of Glencoe, and put\r\nit to the young man, whether, if he intended any thing hostile to\r\nthe clan, he would not have provided for the safety of his niece and\r\nher husband. Macdonald, apparently satisfied with this explanation,\r\nreturned home and retired again to rest, but he had not been long\r\nin bed when his servant, who, apprehensive of the real intentions\r\nof Glenlyon and his party, had prevented Macdonald from sleeping,\r\ninformed him of the approach of a party of men towards the house.\r\nJumping immediately out of bed he ran to the door, and perceiving a\r\nbody of about 20 soldiers with muskets and fixed bayonets coming in\r\nthe direction of his house, he fled to a hill in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhere he was joined by his brother Alexander, who had escaped from\r\nthe scene of carnage, after being wakened from sleep by his servant.\r\n\r\nThe massacre commenced about five o’clock in the morning at\r\nthree different places at once. Glenlyon, with a barbarity which\r\nfortunately for society has few parallels, undertook to butcher his\r\nown hospitable landlord and the other inhabitants of Inverriggen,\r\nwhere he and a party of his men were quartered, and despatched\r\nLieutenant Lindsay with another party of soldiers to Glencoe’s\r\nhouse to cut off the unsuspecting chief. Under the pretence of a\r\nfriendly visit, he and his party obtained admission into the house.\r\nGlencoe was in bed, and while in the act of rising to receive his\r\ncruel visitors, was basely shot at by two of the soldiers, and fell\r\nlifeless into the arms of his wife. The lady in the extremity of her\r\nanguish leaped out of bed and put on her clothes, but the ruffians\r\nstripped her naked, pulled the rings off her fingers with their\r\nteeth, and treated her so cruelly that she died the following day.\r\nThe party also killed two men whom they found in the house, and\r\nwounded a third named Duncan Don, who came occasionally to Glencoe\r\nwith letters from Braemar.\r\n\r\nWhile the butchery was going on in Glencoe’s house, Glenlyon was\r\nbusily doing his bloody work at Inverriggen, where his own host was\r\nshot by his order. Here the party seized nine men, whom they first\r\nbound hand and foot, after which they shot them one by one. Glenlyon\r\nwas desirous of saving the life of a young man about twenty years\r\nof age, but one Captain Drummond shot him dead. The same officer,\r\nimpelled by a thirst for blood, ran his dagger through the body of\r\na boy who had grasped Campbell by the legs and was supplicating for\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glencoe.]\r\n\r\nA third party under the command of one Sergeant Barker, which was\r\nquartered in the village of Auchnaion, fired upon a body of nine\r\nmen whom they observed in a house in the village sitting before a\r\nfire. Among these was the laird of Auchintriaten, who was killed on\r\nthe spot, along with four more of the party. This gentleman had at\r\nthe time a protection in his pocket from Colonel Hill, which he\r\nhad received three months before. The remainder of the party in the\r\nhouse, two or three of whom were wounded, escaped by the back of the\r\nhouse, with the exception of a brother of Auchintriaten, who having\r\nbeen seized by Barker, requested him as a favour not to despatch him\r\nin the house but to kill him without. The sergeant consented, on\r\naccount of having shared his generous hospitality; but when brought\r\nout he threw his plaid, which he had kept loose, over the faces of\r\nthe soldiers who were appointed to shoot him, and thus escaped.\r\n\r\nBesides the slaughter at these three places, there were some\r\npersons dragged from their beds and murdered in other parts of\r\nthe Glen, among whom was an old man of eighty years of age; in\r\nall, 38 persons were slaughtered. The whole male population under\r\n70 years of age, amounting to 200, would in all likelihood have\r\nbeen cut off, if, fortunately for them, a party of 400 men under\r\nLieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was principally charged with the\r\nexecution of the sanguinary warrant, had not been prevented by the\r\nseverity of the weather from reaching the Glen till eleven o’clock,\r\nsix hours after the slaughter, by which time the whole surviving\r\nmale inhabitants, warned of their danger and of the fate of their\r\nchief and other sufferers, had fled to the hills. Ignorant of this\r\nlatter circumstance, Hamilton, on arriving at the pass, appointed\r\nseveral parties to proceed to different parts of the Glen, with\r\norders to take no prisoners, but to kill all the men that came in\r\ntheir way. They had not, however, proceeded far when they fell in\r\nwith Major Duncanson’s party, by whom they were informed of the\r\nevents of the morning, and who told them that as the survivors had\r\nescaped to the hills, they had nothing to do but to burn the houses,\r\nand carry off the cattle. They accordingly set fire to the houses,\r\nand having collected the cattle and effects in the Glen, carried\r\nthem to Inverlochy, where they were divided among the officers of\r\nthe garrison. That Hamilton would have executed his commission to\r\nthe very letter, is evident from the fact, that an old man, above\r\nseventy, the only remaining male inhabitant of the desolate vale they\r\nfell in with, was put to death by his orders.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the houses, a heart-rending scene ensued.\r\nEjected from their dwellings by the devouring element, aged matrons,\r\nwomen with child, and mothers, with infants at their breasts\r\nand followed by children on foot, clinging to them with all the\r\nsolicitude and anxiety of helplessness, were to be seen wending their\r\nway, almost in a state of nudity, towards the mountains in quest of\r\nsome friendly hovel, beneath whose roof they might seek shelter from\r\nthe pitiless tempest and deplore their unhappy fate. But as there\r\nwere no houses within the distance of several miles, and as these\r\ncould only be reached by crossing mountains deeply covered with snow,\r\na great number of these unhappy beings, overcome by fatigue, cold,\r\nand hunger, dropt down and perished miserably among the snow.\r\n\r\nWhile this brutal massacre struck terror into the hearts of the\r\nJacobite chiefs, and thus so far served the immediate object of the\r\ngovernment, it was highly prejudicial to King William. In every\r\nquarter, even at court, the account of the massacre was received at\r\nfirst with incredulity, and then with horror and indignation; and\r\nthe Jacobite party did not fail to turn the affair to good account\r\nagainst the government, by exaggerating, both at home and abroad, the\r\nbarbarous details. The odium of the nation rose to such a pitch, that\r\nhad the exiled monarch appeared at the head of a few thousand men, he\r\nwould, probably, have succeeded in regaining his crown. The ministry,\r\nand even King William, grew alarmed, and to pacify the people he\r\ndismissed the Master of Stair from his councils, and appointed a\r\ncommission of inquiry to investigate the affair.\r\n\r\nAs for the Master of Stair, at whose door the chief blame of the\r\ninfamous transaction was laid by the commission of inquiry, and who\r\nis popularly considered to have been a heartless and bloodthirsty\r\nwretch, he could not understand the indignant astonishment expressed\r\non all hands at what he considered a most patriotic, beneficial,\r\nand in every respect highly commendable proceeding. He considered\r\nthat he had done his ungrateful country excellent service in doing a\r\nlittle to root out a band of pestilential banditti, whom he regarded\r\nin as bad a light as the Italian government of the present day does\r\nthe unscrupulous robbers who infest the country, or as the American\r\ngovernment did the bloodthirsty Indians who harassed the frontiers.\r\nLetters of “fire and sword” against the Highlanders were as common,\r\nin the days of the Stewarts, as warrants for the apprehension of\r\nhouse-breakers or forgers are at the present day. They were looked\r\nupon as semi-civilized aborigines, characterised by such names as\r\n“rebellious and barbarous thieves, limmers, sorners,” &c.; and the\r\nkilling of a Highlandman was thought no more of than the killing\r\nof a “nigger” was in the slave-states of America. In various acts\r\nof the privy council of Scotland, the clan Gregor is denounced in\r\nthe above terms, and was visited with all the terrors of “fire\r\nand sword.” “Their habitations were destroyed. They were hunted\r\ndown like wild beasts. Their very name was proscribed.”[643] We\r\nhave already referred to, in its proper place, a mandate from King\r\nJames V. in 1583, against the clan Chattan, in which he charges his\r\nlieges to invade the clan “to their utter destruction by slaughter,\r\nburning, drowning, and otherways; and leave no creature living of\r\nthat clan, except priests, women, and bairns.” Even Captain Burt,\r\nin the beginning of the next century, writes of the Highlanders as\r\nif they were an interesting race of semi-barbarians, many of whom\r\nwould cut a man’s throat for the mere sake of keeping their hands in\r\npractice.[644] In a letter of the 5th March, 1692, after referring\r\nto the universal talk in London about the transaction, Dalrymple\r\nsays, “All I regret is, that any of the sort got away; and there is a\r\nnecessity to prosecute them to the utmost.” Again, writing to Colonel\r\nHill in April of the same year, he tells him that “as for the people\r\nof Glencoe, when you do your duty in a thing so necessary to rid\r\nthe country of thieving, you need not trouble yourself to take the\r\npains to vindicate yourself. When you do right, you need fear nobody.\r\nAll that can be said is, that, in the execution, it was neither so\r\nfull nor so fair as might have been.” Indeed we think that any one\r\nwho examines into the matter with unbiassed and cool mind, which\r\nis difficult, cannot fail to conclude that neither private spite\r\nnor heartless bloodthirstiness actuated him in bringing about the\r\ntransaction; but that he sincerely thought he was doing his country a\r\nservice in taking the only effectual means of putting down a public\r\npest and a hindrance to progress.\r\n\r\nHad the clan been proceeded against in open and legitimate warfare,\r\nresulting in its utter extinction, the affair might have occupied\r\nno more than a short paragraph in this and other histories. There\r\ncan be no doubt that what gives the deed its nefarious stamp, is the\r\nfiendishly deliberate and deceitful way in which it was accomplished,\r\nin violation of laws of hospitality which are respected even by\r\ncut-throat Arabs. And after all it was a blunder.\r\n\r\nAs to whether King William knew the full significance of the order\r\nwhich he signed, and what was the extent of his knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances, are points which can never be ascertained. It is mere\r\nmeaningless declamation to talk of it as a foul and indelible blot on\r\nhis character and reign. “The best that can be done for the cause of\r\ntruth, is to give the facts abundantly and accurately. The character\r\nof the revolution king is one of the questions which political\r\npassion and partizanship have not yet let go, so that reason may take\r\nit up. And with those who believe that, by his very act of heading\r\nthe revolution which drove forth the Stewarts, he was the man to\r\norder and urge on the murder of an interesting and loyal clan, it\r\nwould be quite useless to discuss the question on the ground of\r\nrational probabilities.”[645]\r\n\r\nThough the nation had long desired an inquiry into this barbarous\r\naffair, it was not until the 29th of April, 1695, upwards of three\r\nyears after the massacre, that a commission was granted. A commission\r\nhad indeed been issued in 1693 appointing the Duke of Hamilton and\r\nothers to examine into the affair, but this was never acted upon. The\r\nMarquis of Tweeddale, lord high chancellor of Scotland, and the other\r\ncommissioners now appointed, accordingly entered upon the inquiry,\r\nand, after examining witnesses and documents, drew up a report and\r\ntransmitted it to his majesty. The commissioners appear to have\r\nexecuted their task, on the whole, with great fairness, although they\r\nput the very best construction on William’s orders, and threw the\r\nwhole blame of the massacre upon Secretary Dalrymple.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners was laid before the parliament of\r\nScotland on the 24th of June, which decided that the execution of the\r\nGlencoe-men was a murder, resolved _nemine contradicente_, that the\r\ninstructions contained in the warrant of the 16th January, 1692, did\r\nnot authorise the massacre. After various sittings on the subject,\r\n“the committee for the security of the kingdom” was appointed to draw\r\nup an address to the king on the subject of the massacre, which being\r\nsubmitted to parliament on the 10th of July, was voted and approved\r\nof.\r\n\r\nNo active measures in the way of punishing either principals or\r\nsubordinates, however, were taken in consequence of the findings of\r\nthe commission and the recommendations of parliament, except that\r\nBreadalbane, who they found had laid himself open to a charge of\r\nhigh treason, was imprisoned for a few days in Edinburgh castle.\r\nA curious and interesting incident came out during the sitting of\r\nthe commission, tending to show that Breadalbane was conscious of\r\na very large share of guilt, and was fully aware of the heinous\r\nand nefarious character of the bloody transaction. Some days after\r\nthe slaughter, a person sent by Breadalbane’s steward waited upon\r\nGlencoe’s sons, and told them that if they would declare that his\r\nlordship had no concern in the slaughter, they might be assured that\r\nthe earl would procure their “remission and restitution.”\r\n\r\nAs the surviving Macdonalds, who on their humble petition and promise\r\nof good behaviour were allowed to return to the glen, had been\r\nreduced to great poverty and distress by the destruction of their\r\nproperty, and as they had conducted themselves with great moderation\r\nunder their misfortunes, the estates solicited his majesty to order\r\nreparation to be made to them for the losses they had sustained in\r\ntheir properties. Whether the “royal charity and compassion” invoked\r\nby the estates in behalf of these unfortunate people were ever\r\nexercised does not appear; but it is highly probable, that this part\r\nof the address was as little heeded as the rest.[646] In fact, the\r\nwhole matter was hushed up, and it now lives in the page of history\r\nas a sad and somewhat inexplicable blunder, which has rendered the\r\nmemories of those who contrived it and those who executed it, for\r\never infamous.[647]\r\n\r\nThese measures of the government, conciliatory and threatening, seem\r\nto have had the effect for the time of suppressing open hostility at\r\nleast among the Highlanders; but from the nature of that people, and\r\nthe method in which government treated them, we can readily believe\r\nthat their obedience was none of the heartiest, and that they would\r\nbe glad any moment to join in an attempt to oust King William and\r\nrestore King James. During the whole of William’s reign his peace\r\nof mind was being continually disturbed by rumours and discoveries\r\nof plots, and by threats of a hostile descent on this country from\r\nFrance. In all these the Highland chiefs had their fair share, and\r\nwere ready to receive with open arms any hostile expedition which\r\nmight be fortunate enough to effect a landing on their coasts.\r\n\r\nThe stirring events of the last fifty years, in which the Highlanders\r\nplayed a conspicuous part, appear to have been the means of drawing\r\ntheir attention somewhat away from their hereditary clan-quarrels,\r\nand thus rendering their destructive internal strifes less frequent.\r\nBut now that there was no external outlet for their belligerent\r\npropensities, they appear again to have resumed their old clan feuds.\r\n“To be at peace, unless they were disarmed and overawed, was not in\r\ntheir nature; and neither the law nor the military power of the\r\nnation was then on a scale sufficient to have accomplished these\r\nends. We even find those chiefs who had ingratiated themselves with\r\nthe government, obtaining, though not so readily as formerly, the\r\nwrits known by the savage name of ‘letters of fire and sword’ against\r\ntheir enemies. These were licenses for civil war, giving the sanction\r\nof government aid and encouragement to one side in the conflict. They\r\nauthorised the favoured clan to burn, waste, and slay, far and wide,\r\nwithin the territory of their enemies, setting forth--such were the\r\nwords of style used by the clerks of the privy council who prepared\r\nthese terrible documents--‘that whatever slaughter, mutilation,\r\nblood, fire-raising, or other violence’ may be done by the persons\r\nholding the letters, shall be held ‘laudable, good, and warrantable\r\nservice to his majesty and his government.’ There is little doubt\r\nthat the readiness with which these warrants were issued in earlier\r\ntimes, arose from the view that it was a good thing to encourage the\r\nHighlanders in slaying each other, and doubtless, even for a few\r\nyears after such an event as Glencoe, such a feeling would linger\r\nin the usual official quarters. Though it was professed that no one\r\ncould obtain letters of fire and sword but a litigant who could\r\nnot enforce his just claims, it would be generally a vain task to\r\nexamine the relative merits of the two sides, expecting to find one\r\nof them in the right. Any mitigation which the horrors of such a\r\nsystem may have received in later times, would be from the garrison\r\nof Fort-William being associated in arms with the holders of the\r\nletters.”[648]\r\n\r\nThe materials for the internal history of the Highlands at this\r\nperiod are scanty; doubtless there were many petty strifes carried\r\non between hostile clans, and many cattle-lifting raids made by the\r\nHighland borderers upon their lowland neighbours, but no records of\r\nthese appear to have been kept.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Glencoe massacre, a scheme appears to have\r\nbeen proposed to the king by Breadalbane[649] for utilizing the\r\nHighlanders “in case of any insurrection at home, or invasion from\r\nabroad.” The gist of it was that the Highland chiefs should be\r\nordered to raise a body of 4,000 men, who would be so disciplined\r\nthat they would be ready to be called out when required, and who\r\nwere to be commanded by “some principal man in the Highlands,” who\r\nwould have the pay of a general officer. This “principal man,”\r\nBreadalbane doubtless meant to be himself, as he suggests that the\r\n_second_ in command should be Lochiel, who he said was ambitious to\r\nserve his majesty, and was a Protestant. Forty subordinate officers\r\nwere to be appointed, Breadalbane wisely suggesting that these\r\nshould be of Highland extraction, and that the soldiers themselves\r\nshould be allowed to use their own apparel, their own arms, and to\r\nbe disciplined after their own fashion. As will be afterwards seen,\r\ngovernment appears to have acted on this or some similar proposal,\r\nand organized a few independent Highland companies. We give below the\r\nnumber of men which, according to Breadalbane’s estimate, each of the\r\nchiefs to which the proposal referred could raise. It is probably\r\nconsiderably below the number of men capable of bearing arms, who\r\nwere at the command of the various chiefs named.[650]\r\n\r\nIt is about this time that the famous Robert Macgregor, better known\r\nas Rob Roy, first emerges into notice. The details of his life will\r\nbe found in the account of the Clan Macgregor, in Part Second of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nDuring this reign, and shortly after the hushing-up of the Glencoe\r\naffair, there came into prominence another character, destined to\r\nplay a far more important part in the history of the Highlands\r\nand of the country generally, than Rob Roy, whom he resembled in\r\nthe unscrupulous means he took to attain his ends, but whose rude\r\nbut genuine sense of honour and sincerity he appears to have been\r\nentirely devoid of. This was the notorious Simon Fraser, so well\r\nknown afterwards as Lord Lovat. He was born, according to some\r\nauthorities, in the year 1670, but according to himself in 1676,\r\nand was the second son of Thomas Fraser, styled of Beaufort, near\r\nInverness, fourth son of Hugh, ninth Lord Lovat. Simon’s mother was\r\ndame Sybilla Macleod, daughter of the chief of the Macleods. He was\r\neducated at King’s College, Aberdeen, where he is said highly to have\r\ndistinguished himself, and to have taken the degree of Master of\r\nArts.[651] “One can easily believe that Simon, with his brain ever at\r\nwork, and his ambition ever on the stretch, would let no one outstrip\r\nhim.... His subsequent full and free use of the French indicates an\r\naptitude for languages seldom equalled, and his tone of writing and\r\nspeaking was that of a scholar, always when he thought fit that it\r\nshould be so.”[652] In 1695, he was induced to leave the university,\r\njust as he was about to enter upon the study of law, and accept a\r\ncompany in a regiment raised for the service of King William, by Lord\r\nMurray, son of the Marquis of Athole, whose daughter was married to\r\nthe then Lord Lovat, Simon’s cousin. Simon, who pretended the most\r\ninviolable loyalty to the exiled King James, gives as his excuse\r\nfor accepting this commission, that it was only that “he might\r\nhave a regiment well trained and accoutred to join King James in a\r\ndescent he had promised to make in the ensuing summer.” While in Lord\r\nMurray’s regiment, he, in 1696, entered into a plan for surprising\r\nEdinburgh castle, and holding it in the interest of James, but this\r\nwas stifled by the decisive victory at La Hogue.\r\n\r\nIn 1696, Simon accompanied his cousin Lord Lovat, who appears to have\r\nbeen of a “contracted understanding,” and Lord Murray, to London,\r\nand while there, endeavoured to worm himself into the colonelcy of\r\nhis regiment, but was checkmated by Murray, whom, with the house of\r\nAthole, he thenceforth regarded as his enemy.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat died in September 1696, immediately after his return from\r\nLondon, on which Thomas of Beaufort assumed the family title, and\r\nSimon that of Master of Lovat. To render his claims indisputable,\r\nSimon paid his addresses to the daughter of the late lord, who had\r\nassumed the title of baroness of Lovat, and having prevailed on\r\nher to consent to elope with him, would have carried his design of\r\nmarrying her into execution, had not their mutual confident, Fraser\r\nof Tenechiel, after conducting the young lady forth one night in\r\nsuch precipitate haste that she is said to have walked barefooted,\r\nfailed in his trust, and restored her to her mother. The heiress was\r\nthen removed out of the reach of Simon’s artifices by her uncle,\r\nthe Marquis of Athole, to his stronghold at Dunkeld. Here it was\r\ndetermined that to put an end to dispute, she should be married to\r\nthe son of Lord Saltoun, the head of a branch of the Fraser family\r\nin Aberdeenshire. As Simon saw in this match the ruin of all his\r\nhopes, he determined at all hazards to prevent it. As Saltoun and\r\nLord Mungo Murray were returning, October, 1697, from Castle Dounie,\r\nthe residence of the late lord’s widow, they were met at the wood of\r\nBunchrew, near Inverness, by Simon and his followers, and immediately\r\ndisarmed and carried to Fanellan, a house of Lord Lovat’s, before\r\nthe windows of which a threatening gallows was erected. They were\r\ndetained here about a week, when, on a report that Lord Murray and\r\nthe red coats were coming against him, Captain Fraser sent the\r\n_fiery cross_ and _coronach_ through the country of his clan, and\r\nimmediately had at his command a body of 500 armed men. With this\r\nsmall army, Fraser, accompanied by his prisoners, proceeded to Castle\r\nDounie, of which they took possession, sentinels being placed in all\r\nthe rooms, particularly Lady Lovat’s. The prisoners, after being\r\ndetained for some time in the Island of Angus in the Beauly river,\r\nwere dismissed.\r\n\r\nBurton[653] very justly remarks, that the whole of these wild acts\r\nwere evidently the result of a series of impulses. What followed\r\nappears to have been equally unpremeditated and the result of pure\r\nimpulse. Simon determined to atone to himself for the loss of the\r\ndaughter by forcibly wedding the mother, whom he himself describes\r\nas a widow “old enough to be his mother, dwarfish in her person, and\r\ndeformed in her shape.”[654] For this purpose her three waiting maids\r\nwere carried by force out of the room, and about two in the morning\r\none of them was brought back and found her lady “sitting on the\r\nfloor, her hair dishevelled, her head reclining backwards on the bed,\r\nDonald Beaton pulling off the lady’s shoes, and the Captain holding\r\nburning feathers and aqua-vitae to her nose, her ladyship being in a\r\nswoon.” A mock marriage was performed between Simon and Lady Lovat,\r\nby a wretched minister of the name of Munro, and the lady’s clothes\r\nhaving been violently pulled off her, her stays being cut off with a\r\ndirk, she was tossed into the bed, to have the marriage consummated\r\nwith violence. Notwithstanding that the bagpipes were kept playing\r\nin the next room, the poor lady’s cries were heard outside the\r\nhouse.[655] In the morning the lady was found to be so stupified with\r\nthe brutal treatment she had received that she could not recognise\r\nher dearest friends.\r\n\r\nThese violent proceedings caused much consternation in the country,\r\nand the Athole family immediately set about to obtain redress, or\r\nrather revenge. Letters of fire and sword and of intercommuning\r\nwere passed against the whole of the Frasers, and the Marquis\r\nof Tulliebardine organised a force to carry these threats into\r\nexecution. “On the whole, the force brought against him cannot have\r\nbeen very large; but in Simon’s own history of his conflicts and\r\nescapes, the whole affair assumes the aspect of a very considerable\r\ncampaign, in which his enemies, spoken of as ‘the several regiments\r\nof cavalry, infantry, and dragoons,’ are always defeated and baffled\r\nin an unaccountable manner by some handful of Frasers.”[656]\r\nThere does not appear to have been any downright skirmish, the\r\nonly approach to such a thing being a meeting that took place at\r\nStratherrick between the Frasers and the Athole-men under the two\r\nLords Murray, in which the latter threw themselves on the mercy of\r\nSimon, who made them, after the manner of the ancient Romans, pass\r\nthrough the yoke, and at the same time swear by a fearful oath never\r\nagain to enter the Lovat territories.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1698, proceedings were commenced in the court of justiciary\r\nagainst Fraser and his accomplices, and in September they were\r\ncondemned, in their absence, to be executed as traitors.\r\n\r\nIn 1699, died old Fraser of Beaufort, at the house of his\r\nbrother-in-law Macleod of Dunvegan Castle in Skye, and his son\r\nthenceforth assumed the title of Lord Lovat. He appears for some\r\ntime to have led a wandering life, subsisting on pillage and the\r\noccasional contributions of the attached mountaineers.[657] Tired\r\nof this kind of life, he, at the recommendation of Argyle, who had\r\nendeavoured to secure favour for him at head-quarters, sued for a\r\npardon, which King William granted for all his proceedings except the\r\nrape. He was willing to stand trial on this last head, and for this\r\npurpose appeared in Edinburgh with a small army of 100 followers as\r\nwitnesses; but as the majority of the judges were prejudiced against\r\nhim, he found it prudent again to take refuge in his mountains. He\r\nwas outlawed, and finding his enemies too powerful for him, he fled\r\nto France in 1702, and offered his services to King James.\r\n\r\nThese details show, that amid the growing civilization and rapid\r\nprogress of the country generally, the Highlanders were yet as\r\nbarbarous and lawless as ever; the clans still cherishing the same\r\ndevotion to their chiefs, and the same readiness, in defiance of law,\r\nto enter into an exterminating mutual strife. The government appears\r\nto have given up in despair all hopes of making the Highlanders\r\namenable to the ordinary law of the country, or of rooting out from\r\namong them those ancient customs so inconsistent with the spirit of\r\nthe British constitution. All it apparently aimed at was to confine\r\nthe lawless and belligerent propensities of these troublesome Celts\r\nto their own country, and prevent them from taking a form that\r\nwould be injurious to the civilized Lowlanders and the interests of\r\nthe existing government generally. “From old experience in dealing\r\nwith the Highlanders, government had learned a policy which suited\r\ntemporary purposes at all events, however little it tended to the\r\ngeneral pacification and civilisation of the people. This was, not\r\nto trust entirely to a Lowland government force, but to arm one clan\r\nagainst another. It seemed a crafty device for the extermination of\r\nthese troublesome tribes, and a real practical adaptation of Swift’s\r\nparadoxical project for abolishing pauperism, by making the poor\r\nfeed upon each other. But practised as it had been for centuries,\r\ndown from the celebrated battle of the antagonist clans on the Inch\r\nof Perth, yet it never seemed to weaken the strength or abate the\r\nferocity of these warlike vagrants, but rather seemed to nourish\r\ntheir thirst of blood, to make arms and warfare more familiar\r\nand indispensable, and to add every year to the terrors of this\r\nformidable people, who, in the very bosom of fast civilizing Europe,\r\nwere as little under the control of enlightened social institutions,\r\nand as completely savage in their habits, as the Bosgesman of the\r\nEast, or the Black-foot Indian of the West.”[658]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[636] Carstares’ _Papers_, p. 138.\r\n\r\n[637] _Memoirs of Mackay’s Secret Services_, p. 199.

Preface.\r\n\r\n[644] _Letters from a Gentleman in the North._\r\n\r\n[645] Burton’s _Scotland_, 1689-1748, vol. i. p. 174.\r\n\r\n[646] The following extraordinary anecdote is given by General\r\nStewart (_Sketches_, vol. i.) in reference to the punishment which,\r\nin the opinion of the Highlanders, awaits the descendants of the\r\noppressor. “The belief that punishment of the cruelty, oppression,\r\nor misconduct of an individual, descended as a curse on his children\r\nto the third and fourth generation, was not confined to the common\r\npeople. All ranks were influenced by it, believing that if the\r\ncurse did not fall upon the first, or second generation, it would\r\ninevitably descend upon the succeeding. The late Colonel Campbell\r\nof Glenlyon retained this belief through a course of thirty years’\r\nintercourse with the world, as an officer of the 42d regiment, and\r\nof marines. He was grandson of the laird of Glenlyon, who commanded\r\nthe military at the massacre of Glencoe; and who lived in the laird\r\nof Glencoe’s house, where he and his men were hospitably received\r\nas friends, and entertained a fortnight before the execution of his\r\norders. He was playing at cards with the family when the first shot\r\nwas fired, and the murderous scene commenced. Colonel Campbell was an\r\nadditional captain in the 42d regiment in 1748, and was put on half\r\npay. He then entered the marines, and in 1762 was major, with the\r\nbrevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, and commanded 800 of his corps at\r\nthe Havannah. In 1771, he was ordered to superintend the execution of\r\nthe sentence of a court-martial on a soldier of marines, condemned to\r\nbe shot. A reprieve was sent, but the whole ceremony of the execution\r\nwas to proceed until the criminal was upon his knees, with a cap\r\nover his eyes, prepared to receive the volley. It was then he was to\r\nbe informed of his pardon. No person was to be told previously, and\r\nColonel Campbell was directed not to inform even the firing party,\r\nwho were warned that the signal to fire would be the waving of a\r\nwhite handkerchief by the commanding officer. When all was prepared,\r\nand the clergyman had left the prisoner on his knees, in momentary\r\nexpectation of his fate, and the firing party were looking with\r\nintense attention for the signal, Colonel Campbell put his hand into\r\nhis pocket for the reprieve, and in pulling out the packet the white\r\nhandkerchief accompanied it, and catching the eyes of the party, they\r\nfired, and the unfortunate prisoner was shot dead.\r\n\r\n“The paper dropped through Colonel Campbell’s fingers, and clapping\r\nhis hand to his forehead, he exclaimed, ‘The curse of God and of\r\nGlencoe is here, I am an unfortunate ruined man.’ He desired the\r\nsoldiers to be sent to the barracks, instantly quitted the parade,\r\nand soon afterwards retired from the service. This retirement was\r\nnot the result of any reflection or reprimand on account of this\r\nunfortunate affair, as it was known to be entirely accidental. The\r\nimpression on his mind, however, was never effaced.

It\r\nappears to have had little influence on the Highlands, for although a\r\nfew natives took part in the expedition out of dissatisfaction with\r\nWilliam’s government, the great mass of the Highlanders were too far\r\nbehind the age to resort to such a roundabout means of aggrandizing\r\na fortune.\r\n\r\nThe attitude assumed by King William and the government to the Darien\r\nexpedition exasperated the Scottish nation so much that there seemed\r\nto be some danger of a counter-revolution. To the bitterness of\r\ndisappointment succeeded an implacable hostility to the king, who\r\nwas denounced, in pamphlets of the most violent and inflammatory\r\ntendency, as a hypocrite, and as the deceiver of those who had\r\nshed their best blood in his cause, and as the author of all the\r\nmisfortunes which had befallen Scotland. One of these pamphlets was\r\nvoted by the House of Commons a false, scandalous, and seditious\r\nlibel, and ordered to be burned by the common executioner, and\r\nan address was voted to his majesty to issue a proclamation for\r\napprehending the author, printer, and publisher of the obnoxious\r\npublication. The king was so chagrined at the conduct of the Scotch\r\nthat he refused to see Lord Basil Hamilton, who had an address to\r\npresent to his majesty from the company, praying for his interference\r\non behalf of their servants who were kept in captivity by the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nIn direct contradiction to the House of Lords, the Scottish\r\nparliament voted that the colony of Darien was a lawful and rightful\r\nsettlement which they would support; a resolution which induced the\r\nDuke of Queensberry, the commissioner, to prorogue the session. But\r\nthis step only tended to increase the discontents of the nation;\r\nand, to show the king that the people would be no longer trifled\r\nwith, an address to his majesty, containing a detail of national\r\ngrievances, and representing the necessity of calling an immediate\r\nmeeting of parliament, was drawn up and signed by a considerable\r\nnumber of the members; and a deputation, with Lord Ross at its head,\r\nwas appointed to present the address to the king. His majesty,\r\nhowever, evaded the address, by informing the deputation that they\r\nwould be made acquainted in Scotland with his intentions; and, as if\r\nto show his displeasure, he ordered the parliament to be adjourned by\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish nation was now fully ripe for a rebellion, but neither\r\nJames nor his advisers had the capacity to avail themselves of\r\npassing events, to snatch the tottering crown from the head of the\r\nillustrious foreigner, who was destined to be the happy instrument of\r\nplacing the liberties of the nation upon a more sure and permanent\r\nfooting than they had hitherto been. The hopes of the Jacobites\r\nwere, however, greatly raised by the jarrings between the king and\r\nhis Scottish subjects, and an event occurred, about this time, which\r\ntended still farther to strengthen them. This was the death of the\r\nyoung Duke of Gloucester, the only surviving child of the Princess\r\nAnne, on the 29th of July, 1700, in the eleventh year of his age. As\r\nthe Jacobites considered that the duke was the chief obstacle in the\r\nway of the accession of the Prince of Wales to the crown, they could\r\nnot conceal their pleasure at an occurrence which seemed to pave the\r\nway for the restoration of the exiled family, and they privately\r\ndespatched a trusty adherent to France to assure King James that\r\nthey would settle the succession upon the Prince of Wales. Such a\r\nproposition had indeed been made by William himself at an interview\r\nhe had with Louis XIV. in 1697, when a prospect opened of James\r\nbeing elected king of Poland on the death of John Sobieski; but this\r\nproposal was rejected by James, who told the king of France, that\r\nthough he could bear with patience the usurpation of his nephew and\r\nson-in-law, he would not allow his own son to commit such an act of\r\ninjustice; that by permitting his son to reign while he (James) was\r\nalive, he would, in fact, be held as having renounced his crown,\r\nand that the Prince of Wales would also be held as having resigned\r\nhis own right, if he accepted the crown as successor to the Prince\r\nof Orange. As James had now given up all idea of a crown, and was\r\nwholly engrossed with the more important concerns of a future life,\r\nit is probable that he received the proposal of his friends in a very\r\ndifferent spirit from that he evinced when made by William.\r\n\r\nThe designs of the Jacobites, however, were frustrated by the\r\nintrigues of the Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of\r\nHanover, grand-daughter of King James I., who had for several years\r\ncontemplated the plan of getting the succession to the English crown\r\nsettled upon herself and her heirs. An act was accordingly passed\r\nby the English parliament in June, 1701, at the desire of the king,\r\nwhom the princess had prevailed upon to espouse her cause, declaring\r\nher to be the next in succession to the crown of England, after\r\nhis majesty and the Princess Anne, in default of issue of their\r\nbodies respectively, and that after the decease of William and Anne\r\nrespectively without issue, the crown and government of England\r\nshould remain and continue to the Princess Sophia and the heirs of\r\nher body, being Protestants. This act, which, by one swoop, cut\r\noff the whole Catholic descendants of James I., of whom there were\r\nfifty-three alive, all nearer heirs to the crown than the princess,\r\ngave great offence to all the Catholic princes concerned in the\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nThe act of settlement in favour of the Princess Sophia and her\r\nheirs, was a death-blow to the Jacobite interest, but still the\r\nhopes of the party were not extinguished. As James had given up all\r\nidea of dispossessing William, and even discountenanced any attempt\r\nto disturb the peace of the kingdom during his own life-time, the\r\npartisans of his family had given up every expectation of his\r\nrestoration. But the death of King James, which took place at St.\r\nGermains on the 16th of September, 1701, and the recognition of his\r\nson by Louis XIV. as king, were events which opened up brighter\r\nprospects than they had yet enjoyed. The unfortunate monarch had,\r\nfor several years, taken farewell of worldly objects, and had turned\r\nhis whole attention to the concerns of eternity, dying ardently\r\nattached to the creed which, from principle, he had embraced. Of\r\nthe arbitrary and unconstitutional conduct of James, at the period\r\npreceding the revolution, it is impossible for any lover of genuine\r\nliberty to speak without feelings of indignation; but it must not be\r\nforgotten that in his time the prerogatives of the crown were not\r\nclearly defined, and that he was misled by evil counsellors, who\r\nadvised him to violate the existing constitution.\r\n\r\nNothing but the prospect of an immediate war with England could,\r\nit is believed, have induced Louis to recognise, as he did, the\r\nPrince of Wales as king of England, Ireland, and Scotland. William\r\nremonstrated against this act of the French king, as a violation\r\nof the treaty of Ryswick, and appealed to the King of Sweden, as\r\nthe guarantee for its observance; but Louis was inflexible, and\r\nmaintained in the face of all Europe, that he was not debarred by\r\nthe treaty from acknowledging the title of the Prince of Wales, to\r\nwhich he had right by birth. He admitted that by the fourth article\r\nof the treaty he was bound not to disturb William in the possession\r\nof his dominions, and he declared his intention to adhere to that\r\nstipulation; but this explanation was considered quite unsatisfactory\r\nby William, who recalled his ambassador from Paris. The conduct of\r\nthe French king excited general indignation in England, and addresses\r\nwere sent up from all parts of the kingdom, expressive of attachment\r\nto the government. The English parliament passed two separate acts\r\nof attainder against the pretended Prince of Wales, as the son of\r\nJames was termed, and the queen, his mother, who acted as regent.\r\nGreat preparations were made for entering into a war with France,\r\nand William had concerted with his allies the plan of a campaign,\r\nbut he did not live to see the gigantic schemes which he had devised\r\nfor humbling the pride of France put into execution. He expired at\r\nKensington on the 8th of March, 1702, in consequence of a fall from\r\nhis horse about a fortnight before, which fractured his collar-bone.\r\nHe had reigned thirteen years, and was in the fifty-second year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the Princess Anne gave satisfaction to all parties,\r\nparticularly to the Jacobites, who imagined, that as she had no\r\nheirs of her own body, she would be induced to concur with them\r\nin getting the succession act repealed, so as to make way for her\r\nbrother, the Prince of Wales. At first the queen seemed disposed to\r\nthrow herself into the hands of the Tory faction, at the head of\r\nwhich was the Earl of Rochester, first cousin to the queen, who was\r\naverse to a war with France; but the Earl, (afterwards the celebrated\r\nDuke) of Marlborough, his rival, succeeded, through the intrigues\r\nof his countess, in altering the mind of her majesty, and war was\r\naccordingly declared against France on the 4th of May.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish parliament, to which the Duke of Queensberry was\r\nappointed commissioner, met on the 9th of June; but before his\r\ncommission was read, the Duke of Hamilton objected to the legality of\r\nthe meeting, the parliament having been virtually dissolved, as he\r\nmaintained, by not having met within the statutory period; and having\r\ntaken a formal protest against its proceedings, he withdrew from the\r\nhouse, followed by seventy-nine members of the first rank in the\r\nkingdom, amidst the acclamations of the people. The seceding members,\r\nthereupon, sent up Lord Blantyre to London with an address to the\r\nqueen, but she refused to see him. This refusal highly displeased the\r\npeople, whose resentment was still farther increased by a prosecution\r\nraised by the lord advocate against the faculty of advocates, for\r\nhaving, by a vote, approved of the secession and address. Several\r\nacts were passed by the parliament, one of the most important of\r\nwhich was that authorizing the queen to name commissioners for\r\nnegotiating a treaty of union with England. An attempt was made\r\nby the Earl of Marchmont, the lord-chancellor, (better known as\r\nSir Patrick Home of Polwarth) without any instructions from his\r\ncolleagues, and even contrary to the advice of the commissioner, to\r\nalter the succession, by bringing in a bill similar to that which had\r\npassed in England for abjuring the Prince of Wales, and settling the\r\nsuccession on the Princess Sophia and her heirs; but as the ministry\r\nhad no instructions from the queen, the bill was not supported. It\r\nis not improbable that Marchmont intended, by the introduction of\r\nthis measure, to sound the disposition of the queen in regard of her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe queen, by virtue of the powers conferred on her by the\r\nparliaments of England and Scotland, named commissioners to treat\r\nabout a union, who met at the Cockpit, near Whitehall, on the 22d of\r\nOctober; but after some of the preliminaries had been adjusted, the\r\nconference broke off, in consequence of the Scottish commissioners\r\ninsisting that all the rights and privileges of the Darien company\r\nshould be preserved and maintained.\r\n\r\nA partial change in the Scottish ministry having taken place, the\r\nqueen resolved upon calling a new parliament, in the spring of\r\n1703, previous to which she issued an act of indemnity in favour of\r\nevery person who had taken any part against the government since\r\nthe revolution, and allowed such of them as were abroad to return\r\nhome. Under the protection of this amnesty many of the Jacobites\r\nreturned to Scotland, and took the oaths to the government, in the\r\nhope of forwarding the interest of the Prince of Wales. At this time\r\nScotland was divided into three parties. The first consisted of the\r\nrevolutionists, who were headed by the Duke of Argyle. The second of\r\nwhat was called the country party, who were opposed to the union,\r\nand who insisted on indemnification for the losses sustained in the\r\nDarien speculation, and satisfaction for the massacre of Glencoe and\r\nother grievances suffered in the late reign. The Duke of Hamilton\r\nand the Marquis of Tweeddale took the direction of this party.\r\nThe last, called Mitchell’s club, from the house they met in, was\r\ncomposed entirely of the Jacobites or Cavaliers. These were headed by\r\nthe Earl of Home.[659] The two latter parties, by coalescing at the\r\nelections, might have returned a majority favourable to their views;\r\nbut the Earl of Seafield, who had succeeded the Earl of Marchmont\r\nas chancellor, had the address to separate the Jacobites from the\r\ncountry party, and, by making them believe that he was their friend,\r\nprevailed upon them to throw their interest at the elections into\r\nthe scale of the government. The parliament, however, which met on\r\nthe 6th of May, was not so pliable to ministerial dictation as might\r\nhave been expected, for although the royal assent was refused to\r\nwhat was called the act of security for limiting the power of the\r\ncrown, “this session of parliament,” to use the words of Lockhart,\r\n“did more for redressing the grievances and restoring the liberties\r\nof the nation than all the parliaments since the year 1660.”[660]\r\nIt was in this parliament that the celebrated patriot, Fletcher of\r\nSaltoun, first distinguished himself. The Earl of Marchmont again\r\nbrought in his bill for settling the crown of Scotland upon the house\r\nof Hanover; but such was the indignation with which it was received\r\nby the house, that some of the members proposed that the bill should\r\nbe burnt, while others moved that the proposer of the measure should\r\nbe committed to the castle of Edinburgh. On a division the bill was\r\nthrown out by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nAfter the prorogation of the parliament, the courtiers and the heads\r\nof the cavaliers repaired to London to pay court to the queen, who\r\nreceived them kindly, and conferred marks of her favour upon some of\r\nthem. The Marquis of Athole, in particular, who aspired to be leader\r\nof the Jacobites, was made a duke, and invested with the dignity of\r\na knight of the order of the Thistle, which she had just revived to\r\nenable her to extend the royal favour. Her policy seems to have been\r\nto gain over all parties to her interest; but she was soon made to\r\nbelieve that a conspiracy existed against her among the cavaliers to\r\nsupersede her, and to place her brother upon the throne. The moving\r\nspirit in this plot, known as the Scotch Plot, was the now notorious\r\nLovat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERTSON. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\n“An indemnity having been granted to those who had left the country\r\nwith the exiled court, on condition of their returning within a time\r\nlimited, and taking the oaths, it was observed with alarm, that many\r\npersons were taking advantage of this opportunity to return, who were\r\namong the most formidable of the Jacobite leaders, and who could not\r\nbe supposed to be sincerely disposed to support the Protestant line\r\nof succession. Among these ominous apparitions were Lovat himself,\r\nthe two Murrays, Sir John Maclean, Robertson of Struan the poet\r\nchieftain,--‘a little black man, about thirty years old,’ as he was\r\ndescribed by those who kept their eyes on him; and David Lindsay,\r\nsecretary to the Pretender’s prime minister, Middleton. The fiery\r\nLord Belhaven had just paid a visit to France. He was an opponent\r\nof English ascendency, and a cadet of the house of Hamilton; and\r\nhis mission could, of course, have no other object but to offer the\r\nallegiance of that house to the young prince. Political intriguers,\r\nsuch as the renowned Ferguson, looked busy and mysterious. Mrs. Fox,\r\nwhose name was connected with the plot for which Sir John Fenwick\r\nsuffered, had ventured over to Britain, under a feigned name; and\r\nsundry young men of good birth, whose avowed mission to France had\r\nbeen to study medicine, had, either in vanity or carelessness,\r\nallowed it to transpire that they had been at the court of St.\r\nGermains, and had seen those royal personages who created so\r\ndangerous an interest throughout the country. The general movement\r\nof these parties was northwards, and was accompanied by incidents\r\nsuch as those which happened to Lovat. Captain Hamilton, an officer\r\nstationed at Inverness, wrote to Brigadier-general Maitland, governor\r\nof Fortwilliam, on the 23d of July, that a great hunting match had\r\nbeen planned for the 2d of the month, at which many of the Highland\r\nchiefs were to assemble their vassals.\r\n\r\n“‘The Duke of Hamilton is to be there, the Marquis of Athol: and our\r\nneighbour the Laird of Grant, who has ordered 600 of his men in arms,\r\nin good order, with tartane coats, all of one colour and fashion.\r\nThis is his order to his people in Strathspey. If it be a match of\r\nhunting only, I know not, but I think it my duty to acquaint you,\r\nwhatever may fall out of any such body of men in arms, particularly\r\nin our northern parts.’\r\n\r\n“It will be remembered that this was exactly the form in which the\r\nEarl of Mar raised the standard of rebellion at Braemar, in 1715; and\r\nwe appear to owe the suggestion to the inventive genius of Lovat.\r\nAt the same time, the British ambassador at the Hague received some\r\nmysterious intimations about large sums forwarded in gold, through a\r\nDutch commercial house, to persons of importance in Scotland.”[661]\r\n\r\nLovat had the address before leaving France, by imposing upon Louis,\r\nto whom he was introduced by the pope’s nuncio, to obtain from the\r\nwidow of King James, acting as regent for her son, a commission\r\nof Major-general, with power to raise and command forces in his\r\nbehalf. As the court of St. Germains had some suspicion of Fraser’s\r\nintegrity, Captain John Murray, brother of Mr. Murray of Abercairney,\r\nand Captain James Murray, brother of Sir David Murray of Stanhope,\r\nwere sent over to Scotland, under the protection of Queen Anne’s\r\nindemnity, as a check upon him, and to sound the dispositions of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Scotland, he set off for the Highlands, introduced\r\nhimself into the society of the adherents of the exiled family, and,\r\nby producing his commission of major-general, induced some of them\r\nto give him assurances that they would rise in arms when required,\r\nthough they regretted that such a character should have been\r\nintrusted with so important a command. Others, however, apprehensive\r\nof his real designs, refused to hold any intercourse with him on the\r\nsubject of his mission.\r\n\r\nOn Lovat’s return to Edinburgh, late in September, he contrived to\r\nobtain an interview with the Duke of Queensberry, High Commissioner\r\nto the Parliament of Scotland, and revealed to him the whole affair,\r\ndrawing considerably on his own fertile fancy for startling facts. He\r\nalso produced a letter, purporting to be from the ex-queen, signed\r\nwith the initial M., addressed to the Duke of Athole. Its words\r\nwere, “You may be sure that when my concerns require the help of my\r\nfriends, you are one of the first I have in my view. I am satisfied\r\nyou will not be wanting for any thing that may be in your power\r\naccording to your promise, and you may be assured of all such returns\r\nas you can expect from me and mine. The bearer, who is known to you,\r\nwill tell you more of my friendship to you, and how I rely on yours\r\nfor me, and those I am concerned for.” Queensberry was delighted with\r\nthis apparent discovery, and immediately sent the letter unopened to\r\nthe queen. Lovat, however, by his plotting had made the country too\r\nhot to hold him, and a day or two after his letter had been sent to\r\nthe queen, letters of fire and sword were issued against him, so that\r\nhe now set himself to get safely back to France. He managed to obtain\r\nfrom Queensberry a pass to London, to which place the duke himself\r\nwas bound, and after a few more secret interviews in London, with\r\nanother pass which he contrived to obtain, he safely quitted England\r\nabout the middle of October.[662]\r\n\r\nWhen this so-called conspiracy became publicly known it excited\r\nconsiderable sensation, and the House of Lords immediately resolved\r\nthat a committee should be appointed to inquire into the matter; but\r\nthe queen, who was already well acquainted with the circumstances,\r\nsent them a message, intimating, that as the affair was already\r\nunder investigation, she was desirous that the house should not\r\ninterfere, and she promised in a short time to inform them of the\r\nresult. Accordingly, on the 17th of December, she went to the House\r\nof Peers, and made a speech to both houses, informing them that she\r\nhad complete evidence of evil practices and designs against her\r\ngovernment, carried on by the emissaries of France in Scotland. The\r\npeers, however, proceeded in the inquiry, and after considerable\r\ninvestigation they agreed to the following resolution, “that there\r\nhad been a dangerous conspiracy in Scotland toward the invading\r\nthat kingdom with a French power, in order to subvert her majesty’s\r\ngovernment, and the bringing in the pretended Prince of Wales; that\r\nit was their opinion nothing had given so much encouragement to these\r\ndesigns as the succession of the crown of Scotland not being declared\r\nin favour of the Princess Sophia and her heirs; that the queen\r\nshould be addressed to use such methods as she thought convenient,\r\nfor having the succession of the crown of that kingdom settled after\r\nthat manner; and that being once done, then they would do all in\r\ntheir power to promote an entire union of the two kingdoms.” Mr.\r\nLockhart asserts that the lords thus interfered at the instance of\r\nthe Duke of Queensberry, as he knew that the Whigs would bring him\r\noff, and although they were so clear as to the existence of a plot,\r\nhe maintains that “it was all trick and villany.” Meanwhile Fraser,\r\nfor his imposition upon the French king, was committed a prisoner to\r\nthe Bastile, in which he remained several years.[663]\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the address on the letter from the ex-queen\r\nwas forged by Lovat himself, she having addressed it to no one,\r\nalthough it is supposed to have been meant for the Duke of Gordon.\r\nLovat had also to implicate the Duke of Hamilton, and as he regarded\r\nboth these noblemen as “impostors” and enemies of the exiled\r\nfamily, he considered that his conduct, in thus attempting to ruin\r\nthem, “far from being a real crime, ought to be regarded as a good\r\nand essential service to the king (James III.), and the sincere,\r\npolitical, and ingenious fruit of his zeal, for his project, and the\r\ninterests of his sovereign.”[664] Such is a specimen of the morality\r\nof this extraordinary personage, who, in his correspondence with the\r\nrevolution party, always pretended to be a friend to the revolution\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lockhart, the Duke of Queensberry was at the bottom of\r\nthis sham plot, but he appears really to have been entirely innocent,\r\nand to have acted all along for what he thought the best interests of\r\nthe government. “He was, to use a common but clear expression, made a\r\nfool of.”[665] Although he had managed to clear himself of all blame,\r\nstill as the affair had rendered him very unpopular in Scotland, he\r\nwas dismissed from his situation as one of the Scottish secretaries\r\nof state, and the Marquis of Tweeddale was appointed to succeed him\r\nas lord high-commissioner to the Scottish parliament, which met on\r\nthe 6th of July, 1704.[666]\r\n\r\nFrom the temper displayed in the Scottish parliament, it was obvious\r\nthat without entering into a treaty with Scotland, it would be\r\nutterly impossible for the English ministry to carry the question\r\nof the succession in Scotland. To accomplish this the English\r\nparliament authorised the queen to nominate commissioners to treat\r\nwith commissioners from Scotland; but the conduct of the parliament\r\nwas by no means calculated to allay the jealousy entertained by\r\nthe Scotch, of the interference of England in imposing a foreign\r\nsovereign upon them. Instead of simply empowering the queen to\r\nappoint commissioners, the English parliament, instigated by the\r\nScottish ministry, directed the Scottish parliament in the choice of\r\nits commissioners, and they even prohibited their own commissioners\r\nto meet and treat with those of Scotland unless the parliament of\r\nScotland allowed the queen to name these commissioners herself.\r\nMoreover all Scotsmen not settled in England, or in its service, were\r\ndeclared aliens, until the succession to the crown of Scotland should\r\nbe settled on the Princess Sophia and her Protestant heirs. Several\r\nprohibitory clauses against the trade of Scotland were also inserted\r\nin the act, which were to take effect about eight months thereafter\r\nif the Scottish parliament did not, before the appointed time, yield\r\nto the instructions of that of England.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the government party the Scottish ministry was changed,\r\nand the Duke of Queensberry was recalled to office, being appointed\r\nto the privy seal. The Cavaliers, thus deprived of the aid of the\r\nduke and his friends, applied to the Marquis of Tweeddale--who, with\r\nhis displaced friends, had formed a party called the _squadrone\r\nvolante_, or “flying squadron”--to unite with them against the court;\r\nbut he declined the proposal, as being inconsistent with the object\r\nfor which it was said to be formed, namely, to keep the contending\r\nparties in parliament in check, and to vote only for such measures,\r\nby whatever party introduced, which should appear most beneficial to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the exertions of the court party, the Scottish\r\nministry soon found themselves in a minority in the parliament,\r\nwhich was opened on the 28th of June, 1705, by the Duke of Argyle as\r\ncommissioner. The motion of Sir James Falconer, which had hitherto\r\nremained a dead letter, was again renewed; but although the ministry\r\nwas supported by the “squadron” in opposition to the motion, the\r\nCavaliers carried it by a great majority. The Dukes of Hamilton and\r\nAthole were now desirous of pushing on the inquiry into the alleged\r\nplot, but by advice of the Cavaliers, who insisted that such a\r\nproceeding would be a violation of the agreement entered into between\r\nthem and the Duke of Queensberry’s friends, they desisted for a time.\r\nBut the duke having prevailed upon such of his friends as had voted\r\nwith the Cavaliers in the beginning of the session, to join the court\r\nparty, the subject was introduced before the house in the shape of a\r\nmotion, to know what answer the queen had sent to an address which\r\nhad been voted to her in the preceding session, to send down to\r\nScotland against the next session such persons as had been examined\r\nrespecting the plot, and the papers connected therewith. The Dukes\r\nof Hamilton and Athole vindicated themselves against the charge of\r\nbeing accessory to Fraser’s proceedings, and the latter particularly,\r\nin a long speech, reprobated the conduct of the Duke of Queensberry,\r\nwhom he openly accused of a design to ruin him. Neither the duke nor\r\nhis friends made any answer to the charge, and Athole and Hamilton\r\nconceiving that they had cleared themselves sufficiently, allowed\r\nthe subject to drop. The most important business of the session was\r\nthe measure of the proposed union with England, an act for effecting\r\nwhich was passed, though not without considerable opposition.\r\n\r\nBefore the state of the vote upon this measure was announced, the\r\nDuke of Athole, “in regard that by an English act of parliament made\r\nin the last sessions thereof, entituled an act for the effectual\r\nsecuring England from the dangers that may arise from several\r\nacts passed lately in Scotland, the subjects of this kingdom were\r\nadjudged aliens, born out of the allegiance of the queen, as queen\r\nof England, after the 25th of December 1705,” protested that, for\r\nsaving the honour and interest of her majesty as queen of Scotland,\r\nand maintaining and preserving the undoubted rights and privileges\r\nof her subjects, no act for a treaty with England ought to pass\r\nwithout a clause being added thereto, prohibiting and discharging\r\nthe commissioners that might be appointed for carrying on the treaty\r\nfrom departing from Scotland until the English parliament should\r\nrepeal and rescind the obnoxious act alluded to. To this protest\r\ntwenty-four peers, thirty-seven barons, and eighteen of the burgh\r\nrepresentatives adhered. When the state of the vote was announced,\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton, to the surprise of the cavaliers and the\r\ncountry party, moved that the nomination of the commissioners\r\nshould be left wholly to the queen. From twelve to fifteen members\r\nimmediately exclaimed that the duke had deserted and basely betrayed\r\nhis friends, and ran out of the house in rage and despair. A warm\r\ndebate then ensued, in which Hamilton was roughly handled, and\r\nthe inconsistency of his conduct exposed; but he persisted in his\r\nmotion, which was carried by a majority of eight votes. Had the\r\nother members remained he would have found himself in a minority.\r\nThe Duke of Athole protested a second time for the reasons contained\r\nin his first protest, and twenty-one peers, thirty-three barons, and\r\neighteen burgh representatives adhered to his second protest. The\r\nprotesters consisted of most of the cavaliers and the country party,\r\nand the whole of the “Squadron.” The protesters, however, were not\r\ndiscouraged, and they succeeded so far as to obtain an order of the\r\nhouse prohibiting the Scottish commissioners from treating until the\r\nclause in the English act, declaring the subjects of Scotland aliens,\r\nshould be repealed, a resolution which had the desired effect, the\r\nEnglish parliament rescinding the clause before the time fixed for\r\nits operation arrived.[667]\r\n\r\nIn terms of the powers vested in her by the parliaments of England\r\nand Scotland, the queen nominated commissioners, who met in the\r\ncouncil chamber of the Cockpit, near Whitehall, on the 16th of April,\r\n1706. During their sittings they were twice visited by the queen, who\r\nurged them to complete with as little delay as possible, a treaty\r\nwhich, she anticipated, would be advantageous to both kingdoms. By\r\nthe second article of the treaty, it was declared that the succession\r\nto the monarchy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, in default of\r\nissue of the queen, should remain and continue to the Princess Sophia\r\nand her heirs, being Protestants.\r\n\r\nWhen the terms of the treaty became publicly known in Scotland, a\r\nshout of indignation was set up in every part of the kingdom, at a\r\nmeasure which, it was supposed, would destroy the independence of\r\nthe nation; and when the Scottish parliament met for the purpose of\r\nratifying the treaty, considerable rioting took place in different\r\nparts of the country, and large bodies of armed men threatened to\r\nmarch upon the capital, and disperse the assembly. Numerous addresses\r\nwere sent to the parliament from every part of the kingdom against\r\nthe Union, and considerable opposition was made by the Dukes of\r\nHamilton and Athole, Lord Belhaven, Fletcher of Saltoun, and others,\r\nbut the court party, having obtained the support of the “Squadron,”\r\ncarried the measure by a great majority. The treaty was, however,\r\nafter strenuous opposition, ratified by the Scotch as well as the\r\nEnglish parliament, and ultimately completed on May 1st, 1707.\r\n\r\nAs the restoration of the son of James II. now appeared to the\r\nScottish nation necessary to preserve its independence, various\r\ncombinations were entered into among the people to effect it. The\r\ninhabitants of the western shires, chiefly Cameronians, formerly\r\nthe most determined supporters of the Protestant government, all at\r\nonce became the most zealous partisans of the exiled family, whose\r\nCatholicity they showed themselves disposed altogether to overlook.\r\nPreparatory to more active measures for accomplishing their object,\r\nthe ringleaders among them held several meetings, divided themselves\r\ninto regiments, chose their officers, provided themselves with horses\r\nand arms, and, notwithstanding the religious asperity which had long\r\nexisted between them and the inhabitants of the northern shires,\r\noffered to unite with them in any measure which might be devised\r\nfor accomplishing the restoration of the young prince, who had now\r\nassumed the title of the Chevalier de St. George.[668] The court\r\nof St. Germains, fully aware of the strong national feeling which\r\nexisted in favour of the prince, sent, in concert with the French\r\nking, one Hooke into Scotland to obtain intelligence, and to treat\r\nwith the people for his restoration. This gentleman had been one of\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth’s chaplains when he invaded England; but after\r\nthe execution of that unfortunate nobleman, Hooke went to France,\r\nwhere he became a Catholic, and entered into the French service,\r\nin which he rose to the rank of Colonel. He had been in Scotland\r\nin 1705 on a mission to the heads of the Jacobite chiefs and the\r\ncountry party; but though a man of sense, he conducted himself with\r\nsuch indiscretion, that he could only obtain general promises, from\r\nthe parties he consulted, of their readiness to advance the prince’s\r\ninterest. The cavaliers, however, sent Captain Henry Straton, a\r\ngentleman in whom they placed great confidence, to France, in July\r\nthe following year, to ascertain the extent of the aid they might\r\nexpect from Louis.\r\n\r\nHooke, on this occasion, landed in the north of Scotland, about the\r\nend of February or beginning of March, 1707, and took up a temporary\r\nabode in Slains Castle, the seat of the Earl of Errol, high-constable\r\nof Scotland, where he was waited upon by the countess-dowager, the\r\nmother of the earl, her son being then absent from home. Instead\r\nof consulting, as he should have done, the principal chiefs upon\r\nthe subject of his mission, Hooke at first confined himself to\r\ninterviews with some gentlemen in the counties of Perth and Angus, by\r\nwhom he was received with great favour and hospitality, and looked\r\nupon as a person of no ordinary importance. The attention thus paid\r\nhim, flattered his vanity, in return for which he made them his\r\nconfidents, and proceeded, in concert with them, to deliberate upon\r\nthe mode of accomplishing a restoration. This party, however, had not\r\nthe wisdom to conceal the negotiation with Hooke, whose presence in\r\nthe country became consequently generally known. The result was, that\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton and others, conceiving themselves slighted, and\r\nalarmed at the imprudence of Hooke’s friends, declined to correspond\r\nwith him, and entered into direct communication with the court of St.\r\nGermains itself.\r\n\r\nAs the French king was desirous of ascertaining the exact situation\r\nof the affairs in Scotland, M. de Chamillard, his minister of war,\r\nhad furnished Hooke with a paper of instructions, in the shape of\r\nquestions, to which he was desired to obtain distinct answers,\r\nto enable his majesty to judge of the extent of the assistance\r\nrequired from him, and the probability of success. In answer to\r\nthese questions, a memorial, addressed to the king of France, was\r\ndrawn up, and signed by several noblemen and gentlemen, in which\r\nthey stated that the greater part of the Scottish nation had always\r\nbeen disposed for the service of “its lawful king” ever since the\r\nrevolution; but that this disposition had now become universal, and\r\nthat the shires of the west, which used to be the most disaffected,\r\nwere now zealous to serve him. That to reap the benefit of so\r\nfavourable a disposition, and of so happy a conjuncture, the presence\r\nof the king (the Chevalier) would be absolutely necessary, the people\r\nbeing unwilling to take arms without being sure of having him at\r\ntheir head--that the whole nation would rise upon his arrival--that\r\nhe would become master of Scotland without opposition, and that\r\nthe existing government would be entirely abolished--that of the\r\nnumbers that they would raise, the memorialists would immediately\r\ndespatch 25,000 foot, and 5,000 horse and dragoons into England,\r\nwhile the other peers and chiefs would assemble all their men in\r\ntheir respective counties, and that the general rendezvous of the\r\ntroops on the north of the river Tay should be at Perth, those of\r\nthe western counties at Stirling, and those of the south and east\r\nat Dumfries and Dunse. As to the subsistence of the troops, they\r\ninformed his majesty that they would require nothing from him, as the\r\nharvests of two years were to be found in the granaries, and that so\r\ngreat was its abundance, that a crown would purchase as much flour\r\nas would maintain a man two months--that there was also great plenty\r\nof meat, beer and brandy in the kingdom, and cloth, linen, shoes and\r\nbonnets, sufficient to clothe a considerable number of troops. The\r\nprincipal articles they stood in most need of were arms and money. Of\r\nthe former, the memorialists begged his majesty to send them as many\r\nas would equip 25,000 foot, and 5,000 horse or dragoons, together\r\nwith a proportionate quantity of ammunition, and also some pieces of\r\nartillery, bombs, &c. Of money, of which the country had been almost\r\ndrained by the Darien speculation, by five years of famine, and by\r\nthe constant residence of the nobility at London, they required a\r\nremittance of 100,000 pistoles, to enable them to march into England,\r\nand also a regular monthly subsidy during the war. In addition to\r\nthese demands, they required that the Chevalier should be accompanied\r\nto Scotland by a body of 8,000 troops, to protect his person against\r\nany sudden attempt by the government forces. The memorialists\r\nconcluded, by assuring his most Christian Majesty of their resolution\r\nto bind themselves by the strictest and most sacred ties, to assist\r\none another in what they deemed a common cause, to forget all family\r\ndifferences, and to concur sincerely, and with all their hearts,\r\n“without jealousy or distrust, like men of honour in so just and\r\nglorious an enterprise.”[669]\r\n\r\nHaving finished his negotiation, Hooke returned to France in the\r\nmonth of May, after assuring his friends that “the Pretender” would\r\nland in Scotland about August following. On arriving at the court\r\nof St. Germains, Hooke gave the most flattering account of his\r\nreception, and of the zeal of the people in behalf of the Chevalier,\r\nand accused the Duke of Hamilton and the other persons who had\r\nrefused openly to commit themselves, of luke-warmness in the cause.\r\nThe armament, promised by the king of France, should have been ready\r\nin August; but the court of Versailles contrived to put it off, from\r\ntime to time, under various pretences. The fact appears to be, that\r\nLouis was indifferent about the matter, and, although he pretended\r\nthat his object was to place the Chevalier upon the throne of his\r\nancestors, his real object was to create a diversion in his own\r\nfavour by embroiling Great Britain in a civil war. His reverses at\r\nRamillies and Turin had induced him to send Hooke into Scotland\r\nto obtain information, but, having afterwards defeated the allies\r\nat Almanza, he was in hopes that he would be able to retrieve his\r\naffairs without the aid of the intended descent on Scotland.\r\n\r\nTo hasten the enterprise, the cavaliers sent the Honourable Charles\r\nFleming, brother of the Earl of Wigton, over to France with letters\r\nto his most Christian Majesty and the Chevalier, in consequence of\r\nwhich, preparations for the expedition were commenced at Dunkirk,\r\nwhere a squadron was collected under the command of the Chevalier de\r\nForbin. When the news of these preparations reached England, the\r\ngreatest exertions were made to meet the threatened danger. Both\r\nhouses of parliament joined in an address to the queen, in which\r\nthey pledged themselves to defend her with their lives and fortunes\r\nagainst the “pretended Prince of Wales,” and all her other enemies.\r\nThey suspended the habeas corpus act, and passed a bill enacting,\r\nthat all persons should take the oath of abjuration under the pain\r\nof being held as convicted recusants. They also passed another bill,\r\nreleasing the Scottish clans from all vassalage to those chiefs who\r\nshould appear in arms against her majesty; and “the Pretender” and\r\nhis adherents were declared traitors and rebels. A large fleet was\r\nequipped and assembled at Deal with extraordinary promptitude, and\r\ndespatched towards Dunkirk under the command of Sir John Leake,\r\nSir George Byng, and Lord Dursley, and transports were engaged to\r\nbring over ten British battalions from Ostend. When this fleet,\r\nwhich the French had supposed to be destined for Lisbon, appeared\r\noff Mardyke, they were greatly surprised; and the embarkation of\r\ntheir troops, which had commenced, was immediately countermanded.\r\nThe French admiral represented to his court the danger of proceeding\r\nwith the expedition; but he received positive orders to finish\r\nthe embarkation, and to sail with the first favourable wind. The\r\nChevalier de St. George, at taking farewell, was presented by Louis\r\nwith a sword studded with costly diamonds, and sumptuous services of\r\ngold and silver plate, rich dresses, and other necessaries becoming\r\nhis high station.\r\n\r\nWhile the embarkation was going on, Mr. Fleming and a gentleman\r\nof the name of Arnott were separately despatched for Scotland\r\nfrom Dunkirk, on the evening of the 6th of March, 1708, in two\r\nfrigates, with instructions from the Chevalier to the Jacobite\r\nchiefs. Fleming arrived on the northern coast on the 13th, and,\r\nwhen about two leagues off the land, entered a fishing boat which\r\nlanded him at Slains castle, where he met the Earl of Errol, who\r\nreceived the intelligence of the expedition with great pleasure. On\r\nperusing the Chevalier’s instructions, he immediately despatched\r\na messenger to Mr. Malcolm of Grange, in Fife, with orders to\r\nhave a boat and pilots in readiness at the mouth of the Frith\r\nof Forth to go on board the first vessel that should give the signal\r\nagreed on.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the British fleet having been forced, by stress\r\nof weather, off their station on the 14th of March, the expedition\r\nsailed on the 17th from the road of Dunkirk; but it was detained\r\nin Newport-pits in consequence of a change in the wind, till the\r\n19th, when it again set sail with a fair breeze for Scotland. The\r\nexpedition consisted of seven men-of-war, two of which were fitted\r\nup as transports, and twenty-one frigates, having on board 5,100\r\ntroops, under the command of Monsieur le Comte de Gassé, who, on\r\nthe last-mentioned day, received from the French king the patent\r\nof a Marshal of France, and assumed the name of Mantignon. While\r\nat Newport, three of the frigates, which had received some damage,\r\nreturned to Dunkirk; but, at a council of war, held in the apartment\r\nof the Chevalier, it was resolved, at his desire, to proceed\r\nwithout them, although these vessels had 800 troops on board, and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of arms and provisions. At the same council it\r\nwas also determined to sail directly to the Frith of Forth, and to\r\ndisembark the troops at Burnt-island, whence it was proposed to send\r\na detachment to take possession of Stirling.[670]\r\n\r\nThe French fleet having been observed in Newport-pits from the\r\nsteeples of Ostend, a vessel was immediately despatched thence by\r\nMajor-general Cadogan to inform Sir George Byng of their having\r\nleft Dunkirk: Sir George went immediately in quest of the enemy.\r\nThe French fleet, favoured by a strong and fair wind, reached the\r\nFrith on the evening of the 23d, without seeing any of the English\r\nsquadron, and anchored off Crail, the commander intending to proceed\r\nup the Frith the following morning; but he had been anticipated by\r\nthe Proteus, one of the three vessels which had returned to Dunkirk,\r\nand which, being a superior sailer, had reached the Frith before\r\nhim, and had given notice of the approach of the French fleet to the\r\nfriends of the Chevalier, who lived on the coast, by firing five\r\nguns, the concerted signal by which the friends of the prince along\r\nthat coast were to be apprized of his arrival. Malcolm of Grange,\r\nwho had been for some days anxiously looking out for the fleet, went\r\nimmediately on board this vessel with a pilot.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of M. de Forbin to proceed up the Frith next\r\nmorning, was, however, put an end to, by the appearance, at\r\nday-break, of the English fleet, consisting of 28 sail, standing\r\nin for the Frith. Alarmed for the safety of his ships, the French\r\ncommander immediately cut his cables, and by favour of a strong\r\nland breeze which fortunately sprung up, stood out to sea under\r\nfull sail, having previously given orders to the different ships,\r\nin case of separation, to rendezvous at Cromarty or Inverness. The\r\nFrench vessels being lighter and cleaner, outstripped the English\r\nin sailing, and all of them escaped, with the exception of the\r\nSalisbury, a ship formerly captured from the English, which was\r\ntaken. On board of this vessel were Lord Griffin, the Earl of\r\nMiddleton’s two sons, M. La Vie, a Major-general, Colonel Francis\r\nWauchope, some other officers, and between 300 and 400 soldiers.\r\nOn the following day, the French commander finding himself out of\r\nsight of the enemy, and all his vessels together, with the exception\r\nof the Salisbury, consulted with the Marshal de Mantignon, on the\r\nexpediency of landing at some place in the north of Scotland, and\r\nproposed Inverness. The Chevalier, who was so desirous of landing,\r\nthat he had, though in vain, entreated M. de Forbin, the preceding\r\nday, to put him ashore, though his domestics alone should accompany\r\nhim, received this proposal with great satisfaction. The fleet\r\naccordingly, aided by a favourable wind, steered to the north\r\nduring the whole of the 25th; but at ten o’clock at night, the wind\r\nsuddenly changed to the north, and blew directly in their teeth\r\nwith considerable violence. As the storm continued the whole of the\r\nfollowing day, and as M. de Forbin was afraid that the fleet would\r\nbe dispersed, and might, when separated, fall into the hands of the\r\nenemy, a council was held, at which it was unanimously resolved, with\r\nthe entire concurrence of the Chevalier, to return to Dunkirk, where\r\nthe expedition arrived on the 7th of April.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of an enterprise, which, but for the merest\r\naccidental circumstance, might have been crowned with the most\r\ncomplete success; for had the expedition arrived only a few hours\r\nearlier in the Frith of Forth, the whole troops, arms and ammunition,\r\nwould have been landed without opposition. Such were the dispositions\r\nof the people of Scotland in favour of “the Pretender,” and so\r\ndisaffected had they become towards the government, that a universal\r\nrising would undoubtedly have taken place in his support had he set\r\nhis foot in Scotland. No effectual resistance could have been offered\r\nto him by the regular troops, which did not exceed 2,500 men; and as\r\nlittle reliance could be placed in them, from their participating\r\ngenerally in the national feeling, the Earl of Leven, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, had determined to retire to Carlisle or Berwick,\r\nwith such forces as would accompany him.[671] The news of the sailing\r\nof the expedition created a panic in England, was followed by a run\r\nupon the bank, which would have been obliged to suspend its payments\r\nhad not the most extraordinary exertions been made to support its\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nThe principal friends of the Chevalier de St. George, and every\r\nperson of any distinction in Scotland, suspected of favouring his\r\npretensions, were, upon the failure of the expedition, immediately\r\nseized and committed to the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling, and\r\nthe common jails, whence many of them were transmitted to England,\r\nand imprisoned in the Tower of London, or in Newgate. Among those\r\nwho were carried to London, was the Duke of Hamilton, who, taking\r\nadvantage of a quarrel between the Lord-treasurer Godolphin and\r\nthe Whigs, obtained, by offering his support to the latter in the\r\nelection of the Scottish representative peers, not only his own\r\nliberation, but also that of all the other prisoners, with the\r\nexception of Stirling of Kier. Seaton of Touch, Stirling of Carden,\r\nand other gentlemen of Stirlingshire, who, on receiving intelligence\r\nthat the Chevalier had landed, had mounted their horses and advanced\r\nin a body towards Edinburgh, to support him. These last were brought\r\nto trial for high treason, as having appeared in arms against the\r\ngovernment; but as no proof was brought against them, they were\r\nacquitted.[672] The fact is, that the queen’s advisers, fully aware\r\nof the great danger which the government had escaped, and the risks\r\nto which it was still exposed, were disposed to act a very lenient\r\npart, and were afraid, under existing circumstances, to commit\r\nthemselves by sacrificing any of the disaffected to a doubtful, and,\r\nas it must have appeared to them, a precarious expediency.\r\n\r\nFor a time, the idea of a restoration seems to have been abandoned;\r\nbut the systematic attacks made by the High Church party in England,\r\nupon the principles of the revolution, and the popular excitement\r\nraised against the Whig ministry in consequence of Dr. Sacheverel’s\r\ntrial, raised anew the expectations of the Jacobites, which were\r\nstill farther elevated by the expulsion of the Whigs from office in\r\n1710, by the intrigues of the Tories. Although the queen on opening\r\nthe new parliament, which met on the 25th of November, declared to\r\nboth houses that she would employ such persons only as were warmly\r\nattached to the Protestant succession in the House of Hanover; yet\r\nit was generally understood that she was inclined to favour the\r\npretensions of her brother, the Chevalier de St. George. As his\r\nreligion was, in fact, the only bar in the way of his succession, she\r\nendeavoured, but without success, to induce him to abandon it. “You\r\nsee,” she observed to the Duke of Buckingham, when speaking of her\r\nbrother, “he does not take the least step to oblige me. I have no\r\nreason to think he values me or my kingdom, therefore I shall give it\r\nto the Elector of Hanover.” On another occasion, when warmly pressed\r\nby the duke, she replied, “What would you have me to do? You know, as\r\nthe law stands, a Papist cannot inherit the crown, and, therefore,\r\nany will I may make will be to no purpose; the law gives all to\r\nHanover; and therefore I had better do that with a good grace which\r\nI cannot help. He may thank himself for it. He knows I always loved\r\nhim better than the Elector.”[673] The Tories were by no means averse\r\nto her majesty’s views of a successor, but afraid of a reaction in\r\npublic opinion in favour of the Whigs, who were endeavouring to\r\nexcite the fears of the nation by raising a no-popery cry, they not\r\nonly carefully abstained from any act which might be considered as\r\nfavouring the claims of “the Pretender;” but even appeared as if\r\nhostile to them. Indeed, so desirous were some of the Tory members\r\nof the House of Commons to settle the crown upon his head, that they\r\nrequired a mere profession of Protestantism from him, till he should\r\nbe firmly seated on the throne, after which he might, they said,\r\nagain resume the exercise and profession of his religion. But the\r\nprince refused to comply.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, however, little reserve was shown, a remarkable instance\r\nof which occurred in the Faculty of Advocates, which body accepted\r\nfrom the Duchess of Gordon a silver medal, having on one side an\r\nimpression of the head of the Chevalier de St. George, and on the\r\nreverse a representation of the British islands, with the motto,\r\n“_Reddite_.” At the presentation of this treasonable device, a motion\r\nthanking her grace for her gift was carried, after a warm debate, by\r\na majority of sixty-three voices against twelve. Dundas of Arniston,\r\nto whom the task of conveying the vote was intrusted, thanked\r\nher grace for having presented the Faculty with a medal of their\r\nsovereign, and stated a hope that she would very soon be enabled to\r\npresent them with a second medal struck upon the restoration of the\r\nking and royal family, and the finishing of usurpation, rebellion,\r\nand whiggery. This proceeding created an extraordinary sensation, and\r\nSir David Dalrymple, the Lord Advocate, was directed by the ministry\r\nto inquire into the matter. The Faculty grew alarmed, disclaimed the\r\nconduct of Dundas and of Horne, another member with whom they alleged\r\nthe transaction originated, and by a solemn resolution declared their\r\nattachment to the queen and the Protestant succession. To satisfy,\r\nin some measure, the court of Hanover, the resident of which at\r\nthe British court had presented a memorial to the queen desiring\r\nthat Dundas and his party might be prosecuted, the Lord Advocate\r\nwas dismissed from office, because he had been remiss in bringing\r\nthe delinquents to justice; but no instructions were given to his\r\nsuccessor to prosecute them.\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of Queen Anne’s reign were chiefly occupied with\r\nparty struggles, which embittered her existence and impaired her\r\nconstitution. The Tories disunited among themselves, split latterly\r\ninto two factions, which were respectively headed by Harley, Earl of\r\nOxford, and Henry St. John, Lord Viscount Bolingbroke. The Whigs, on\r\nthe other hand, united, active and vigorous, pressed hard upon them,\r\nand employed every art to inflame the people against the authors\r\nof their disgrace. Popery and the Pretender were the never-ceasing\r\ntopics with which they endeavoured to enlist the feelings of the\r\nnation in their favour, and the Duke of Argyle, in a warm debate\r\nwhich took place in the House of Peers on a question proposed by\r\nthe Earl of Wharton, “Whether the Protestant succession was in\r\ndanger under the present administration?” offered to prove that the\r\nlord-treasurer had remitted a sum of money annually to the Highland\r\nJacobite chiefs. Oxford did not deny the charge, but defended himself\r\nby saying, that he had only adopted the policy of King William, who\r\nhad granted yearly pensions to the heads of the clans, the better\r\nto secure their obedience to the government. The fate of the Tory\r\nministry was at length sealed by the removal of Oxford and the death\r\nof the queen, who survived that event only a few days. Fatigued by\r\na long attendance at a cabinet council held immediately after the\r\ndismissal of the lord-treasurer, she was thrown into a lethargic\r\ndisorder, which terminated her existence on the morning of the\r\n1st of August, 1714, in the fiftieth year of her age, and in the\r\nthirteenth of her reign. With the exception of her dereliction of\r\nduty towards her father, which, from the circumstances in which she\r\nwas placed, may admit of considerable palliation, she left behind her\r\nan unblemished reputation; and though not possessed of much genius\r\nor vigour of mind, she wielded the sceptre with greater skill than\r\nis usually to be found in sovereigns, who, like her, have allowed\r\nthemselves to be controlled by favourites.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[659] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. i. p. 58.\r\n\r\n[660] Idem, vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[661] Burton’s _Life of Lovat_, pp. 76, 77.\r\n\r\n[662] Macpherson’s _Papers_.

These\r\nindeed were in the greatest terror and confusion. And it was no great\r\nwonder that the Earl of Leven did afterwards, in one of his letters\r\nto the secretaries of state, complain that the Jacobites were so\r\nuppish he durst hardly look them in the face as they walked in the\r\nstreets of Edinburgh; for uppish they were indeed, expecting soon to\r\nhave an occasion of repaying him and his fellow-rebels in the same\r\ncoin he and they had treated them for these twenty years past. But\r\nnext day advice was sent from Sir George Byng, that he had come up\r\nwith and was then in pursuit of the French fleet, and then it was\r\nthat every body was in the greatest pain and anxiety imaginable; some\r\nfearing it would, and others that it would not, determine as it did.\r\nIn this perplexity were people when, on the next day, being Sunday,\r\na great number of tall ships were seen sailing up the Frith. This\r\nput our general in such a terror and confusion as can scarcely be\r\nwell expressed: he drew up his army in battle array on the sands of\r\nLeith, as if he’d oppose a landing, and in this posture did he remain\r\nfor several hours, when at last his fears, which truly had almost\r\ndistracted him, vanished by the landing of a boat, which acquainted\r\nhim that it was the English fleet returning from chasing the French.\r\nFor Sir George Byng, after a day’s pursuit, finding the French\r\nout-sailed him, tackt about for the Frith, which was the place he\r\ndesigned chiefly to guard; besides, he had sailed so unprovided that\r\nmost of his ships wanted water and provisions. Here he lay several\r\nweeks, and for the most part the wind was easterly, so that he could\r\nnot well have sailed down the Frith, and the French might, and every\r\nbody believed would, have landed in the north, or sailed round and\r\nlanded in the west; but instead of that they went sneakingly home,\r\nwithout doing any good, but on the contrary much harm, to the king,\r\nhis country, and themselves.”--Vol. i. pp. 243, 244.\r\n\r\n[672] Lockhart.\r\n\r\n[673] _Stuart Papers_, July, 1712. vol. ii. p. 327.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1714-1715.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George I., 1714-1727.\r\n\r\n  Proceedings of the Whigs--Declaration of the Chevalier de St.\r\n  George--Arrival of George I. in England--Conduct of the Earl of\r\n  Mar--Government measures--Intrigues of the Jacobites--The Earl\r\n  of Mar--Leaves England for Scotland--The “Hunting match”--The\r\n  Chevalier de St. George proclaimed by Mar, who raises the\r\n  standard of revolt in Braemar--Death of Louis XIV.--Manifesto\r\n  issued by the Jacobites.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the Earl of Oxford from the office of\r\nlord-high-treasurer was gratifying to the Jacobites, whose\r\nexpectations he had disappointed, and they naturally waited with\r\nanxiety for the appointment of his successor, whom they confidently\r\nimagined would be Bolingbroke, his rival, who was supposed, on juster\r\ngrounds, to favour their views, and to whom they had transferred\r\ntheir confidence. But all their hopes were disappointed by the\r\npromotion of the Duke of Shrewsbury to the treasury, a nobleman\r\ndistinguished for modesty and disinterestedness, and a devoted\r\nattachment to his country.\r\n\r\nTo counteract still farther the schemes of Bolingbroke, all the\r\nmembers of the privy council in London, or the neighbourhood, had\r\nbeen invited, on the proposal of Somerset and Argyle, to attend\r\nthe council without distinction of party, in consequence of which\r\nLord Somers, and many other Whig noblemen, repaired to Kensington.\r\nThe presence of such a number of the Whigs completely overawed\r\nthe Tories, who, confused, distracted, and disunited, were either\r\nunable or afraid to oppose the measures proposed by the former\r\nfor effectually securing the Protestant succession, and gave a\r\ntacit acquiescence to them. Every precaution, in short, had been\r\ntaken to prevent any movement of the Jacobite party in favour of\r\nthe Chevalier, and an express was sent to the Elector of Hanover,\r\ninforming him that the physicians despaired of the queen’s life, and\r\ndesiring him to repair to England with all convenient speed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the death of the queen was announced, the lords of the\r\nprivy council met, and drew up and issued a proclamation the same\r\nday, declaring that by the death of Queen Anne, the imperial crowns\r\nof Great Britain, France, and Ireland, had “solely and rightfully\r\ncome to the High and Mighty Prince George, Elector of Brunswick,\r\nLunenburg,” in consequence of which, the prince was immediately\r\nproclaimed in London, by the heralds at arms, with the usual\r\nsolemnities, and on Thursday the 5th of August, the same ceremony was\r\nrepeated at the market cross of Edinburgh, by the deputy-lord-lyon,\r\nking at arms, in presence of the magistrates and town council of the\r\ncity, the judges of the supreme courts, a considerable number of the\r\nnobility, and a large assemblage of the inhabitants. The Jacobites\r\npreserved a prudent silence on this occasion, but the supporters of\r\nthe government at Edinburgh took care, notwithstanding, to provide\r\nagainst any contingency. They, accordingly, cut off a part of the\r\nwooden bridge before the castle gate, and drew up the remaining\r\npart to cover the gate itself. They also threw up an intrenchment\r\nbetween the gate and the castle wall, on which they posted a\r\nparty of soldiers. In addition to these precautions, Major-general\r\nWightman, the commander of the forces, ordered the different\r\ndetachments quartered at Dundee, and other places, to join his camp\r\nin the vicinity of Edinburgh, with which order they immediately\r\ncomplied.[674]\r\n\r\nPursuant to an act of the late reign, the parliament met on the day\r\nthe queen died. The first four days were occupied in swearing in the\r\nmembers, and on the 5th of August, the parliament was opened by the\r\nLord Chancellor, in name of the lords justices, on whom the interim\r\nadministration of the government had devolved by an act of the 4th\r\nand 5th of Queen Anne. Both houses thereafter voted loyal addresses\r\nto his majesty, in which, after congratulating him upon his accession\r\nto the throne, they expressed their anxiety for his safe and speedy\r\narrival in Great Britain. To these addresses his majesty returned\r\nmost gracious answers, which were reported to both houses on the 25th\r\nof August, on which day the parliament was prorogued till the 23d of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chevalier de St. George heard of the death of his sister,\r\nQueen Anne, he set off from his residence in Lorraine, to Paris,\r\nto crave the aid of the King of France, in vindication of his\r\nhereditary rights; but Louis declined to interfere, on the ground\r\nthat he had, by the treaty of Utrecht, acknowledged the Protestant\r\nsuccession. Disappointed in his application, he retired first to\r\nLuneville, and afterwards to Plombieres, whence, on the 29th of\r\nAugust, he issued a declaration as King James III., asserting his\r\nindefeasible right to the crowns of Great Britain and Ireland, and\r\nsolemnly protesting against every act that had been already done, or\r\nthat should thereafter be done to the prejudice of his hereditary\r\nrights. He says, that although he had been obliged by the treaty to\r\nremove from France, that he had still continued to have his kingdoms\r\nand his people in view, and that he had never ceased to hope, that\r\nGod would in time open his people’s eyes, and convince them not only\r\nof the notorious injustice done to the crown and him, but of the\r\ndangerous consequences thereof for themselves; and that as he could\r\nnot see, without grief and sorrow, their blood and treasure lavished\r\nin the late war, in opposition to his rights, so he could not now\r\nwith less sorrow, see them exposed to be subjected to an arbitrary\r\npower, and become a prey to foreigners--that the settlement of the\r\nsuccession upon one who was so far removed from the regular line,\r\nwas opposed to the maxims of the English constitution--that the\r\nElector of Brunswick was, besides, a foreigner, a powerful prince,\r\nand absolute in his own country--that he was ignorant of the laws,\r\nmanners, customs, and language, and supported by a good many of his\r\nown people--that there had been many thousands of aliens domiciled\r\nin England, for the last thirty years, who would be ready to stand\r\nby him upon all occasions--that the subversion of such a sacred and\r\nfundamental principle as hereditary right, would lead to endless wars\r\nand divisions, and that as there were many other princes, who had\r\nbetter pretensions to the crown than the Elector of Brunswick, the\r\nnation could never enjoy any lasting peace or happiness, till the\r\nsuccession was again settled “in the rightful line.”[675]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, certain movements in Scotland, among the friends of\r\nthe Chevalier, indicated to the government that an insurrection\r\nwas intended. Bodies of armed men were seen marching towards\r\nthe Highlands, and a party of Highlanders appeared in arms near\r\nInverlochy, which was, however, soon dispersed by a detachment from\r\nthe garrison. In this situation of matters, the lords justices sent\r\ndown to Scotland a considerable number of half-pay officers, chiefly\r\nof the Scots regiments, to officer the militia of the country, under\r\nthe direction of Major-general Whitham, then commander-in-chief in\r\nScotland. These prompt measures taken by the government, alarmed the\r\nJacobites, who, after several consultations, retired to their homes.\r\nThe Duke of Gordon was, by order of the justices, confined in the\r\ncity of Edinburgh, and the Marquis of Huntly, and Lord Drummond,\r\nin their respective residences of Brahan, and castle Drummond. The\r\nlast, on hearing that an order for his seizure had arrived, fled to\r\nthe Highlands, but offered bail for his good behaviour. At the same\r\ntime, Captain Campbell, of Glendaruel, who had obtained a commission\r\nfrom the late Tory administration, to raise an independent company in\r\nthe Highlands, was apprehended at Inverlochy, and carried prisoner\r\nto the capital, and Sir Donald M’Donald of Slait, was also seized\r\nand committed to the castle of Edinburgh.[676] As the lords justices\r\nhad received information that the Chevalier intended to land in the\r\nkingdom, they, on the 15th of September, issued a proclamation, in\r\nterms of an act passed in the last session of parliament, offering a\r\nreward of £100,000 sterling for his apprehension, should he land or\r\nattempt to land in Great Britain.[677]\r\n\r\nKing George, after vesting the government of his German dominions\r\nin a council, embarked for England on the 16th of September, and\r\nlanded at Greenwich on the 18th, where he was received by the Duke\r\nof Northumberland, captain of the life-guards, and by the lords\r\njustices, and a large number of the nobility and other persons of\r\ndistinction. Among those who presented themselves on this occasion\r\nwas the Earl of Mar, one of the secretaries of state, but the king\r\nhad been so prepossessed against this nobleman, and indeed against\r\nall the heads of the Tory party, that he did not vouchsafe even to\r\nnotice him. The earl suspecting that means had been used to prejudice\r\nhis majesty against him, had, in order to take off any unfavourable\r\nimpression which these might have produced upon the king’s mind,\r\nwritten a letter to George when in Holland on his way to England,\r\ncongratulating him upon his accession to the throne, stating the\r\nservices which he had rendered to the government, and assuring his\r\nmajesty that he should find him as faithful and dutiful a subject\r\nand servant as ever any of his family, which had been always loyal,\r\nhad been to the crown, or as he had been to his late mistress, the\r\nqueen. With the same view, it is supposed, or to throw the government\r\noff its guard, Mar caused a letter to be addressed to him by some\r\nof the heads and branches of the Jacobite clans expressive of their\r\nloyalty to King George, and declaring, that as they had been always\r\nready to follow his lordship’s directions in serving Queen Anne,\r\nthey were equally ready to concur with him in faithfully serving\r\nhis majesty.[678] But the prejudices of the king against Mar were\r\ntoo deeply rooted to be overcome, and within eight days after the\r\nking’s arrival in England, Mar was dismissed from office, and the\r\nDuke of Montrose appointed in his stead. It was very natural for\r\nthe king to prefer the Whig party, by whose influence he had been\r\nraised to the throne; but unfortunately for the nation, he carried\r\nthis predilection too far. A wise and prudent prince would have\r\nendeavoured to conciliate the adverse faction by acts of kindness,\r\nbut George turned his back upon the entire body of the Tories, and\r\nthrew himself completely into the arms of the Whigs, who alone shared\r\nin the royal favour, and who used every art to confirm their own\r\ninterest, and extend their connexions. The consequence was, that a\r\nspirit of the most violent discontent was excited throughout the\r\nwhole kingdom, and the populace, led on by the Tories or Jacobites,\r\nraised tumults in different parts of the kingdom. The Chevalier de\r\nSt. George availing himself of this excitement, transmitted by the\r\nFrench mail copies of the manifesto, or declaration, which he had\r\nissued from Plombieres to the chief nobility, particularly the Dukes\r\nof Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and Argyle, who delivered them to the\r\nsecretaries of state. The king, imagining that the Duke of Lorraine\r\nwas privy to the preparation and transmission of the manifesto,\r\nrefused an audience to the Marquis de Lamberti, minister from the\r\nduke; but although the duke, on being informed by his minister of\r\nthe circumstance, denied most pointedly that he was accessory to the\r\naffair, and declared that the Chevalier took up his residence in\r\nLorraine by the directions of the king of France, the king persisted\r\nin refusing an audience to De Lamberti till his master should remove\r\nthe Chevalier from his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe parliament having been dissolved, the king, in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1715, issued an extraordinary proclamation, calling a new\r\nparliament. In this proclamation he complained of the evil designs\r\nof the disaffected, and of the misrepresentation of his principles\r\nand conduct which had been industriously circulated throughout the\r\nkingdom, expressing his hopes that his loving subjects would send up\r\nto parliament the fittest persons to redress the present disorders,\r\nand to provide for the peace and happiness of the kingdoms. In order\r\nto secure the interest of those in civil and military employments in\r\nthe elections, a proclamation was issued on the same day, continuing\r\nall persons who had been duly invested in their offices, civil or\r\nmilitary, before the demise of the queen, and who had not been since\r\nremoved therefrom, for the space of six months from the date of the\r\nproclamation, unless his majesty should see cause to remove them\r\nsooner. A warmly contested election followed in England, but although\r\nthe Tories made every exertion, and set up the usual shout of the\r\nchurch in danger, a cry which was responded to by the populace in\r\nmany places, a majority of Whigs was returned. The Whigs were still\r\nmore successful in Scotland, where a majority of the sixteen peers,\r\nand forty out of forty-five members returned to the commons, were in\r\nthe interest of the government. The principal struggle in Scotland\r\nwas in Inverness-shire, between M’Kenzie of Preston-hall, who was\r\nsupported by Glengarry and the other Jacobite chiefs, and Forbes of\r\nCulloden, brother of the celebrated President Forbes, who carried the\r\nelection by the interest of Brigadier-general Grant, and the friends\r\nof Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\nThe new parliament assembled on the 19th of March at Westminster, and\r\nwas for some time chiefly occupied in investigating the conduct of\r\nthe late ministers, against some of whom measures of extreme rigour\r\nwere resolved upon. But these proceedings were interrupted by the\r\nnecessity of devising means for the suppression of a growing spirit\r\nof discontent and disaffection, which seemed to gain ground daily in\r\nEngland, of which an insurrection in Scotland, and an invasion from\r\nabroad, seemed about to ensue as inevitable results. To put an end\r\nto future rioting, a bill was passed, by which it was declared, that\r\nif any persons, to the number of twelve, riotously, tumultuously,\r\nand unlawfully assembled, should continue together for an hour after\r\nhaving been required to disperse by a justice of peace or other\r\nofficer, by proclamation publicly read,--and of which a form was\r\ngiven in the act, they should be guilty of felony, without benefit\r\nof clergy. When the king attended in the House of Lords on the 13th\r\nof July, to give his assent to this and other bills, he informed\r\nboth houses that a rebellion had actually begun at home, and that an\r\ninvasion was threatened from abroad, and he, therefore, solicited\r\nthe commons to enable him to provide for the defence of the kingdom.\r\nThe preparations of the Chevalier de St. George for a descent upon\r\nGreat Britain were indeed already far advanced. Elated by the\r\nintelligence which had been sent him from England by the Tories, of\r\nthe disaffection of the people to the government, and by the promises\r\nof support which he had received from them, should he land in Great\r\nBritain, the prince had applied a second time for succour to Louis,\r\nwho, notwithstanding the treaty of Utrecht, supplied him privately\r\nwith money, and allowed a ship to be fitted out for him, at his own\r\nexpense, in the port of Havre. The cause of the Chevalier had now\r\nbeen openly espoused by the Duke of Ormond and Lord Bolingbroke, both\r\nof whom having retired to France, had been attainted by the British\r\nparliament without a hearing, and were busily employed corresponding\r\nwith the Tories of England. These intrigues and preparations were\r\nearly discovered by the Earl of Stair, the British ambassador at\r\nParis, and communicated by him to the ministry. Proceeding upon this\r\ninformation, the parliament suspended the Habeas Corpus act, and\r\nrenewed the offer of one hundred thousand pounds to any person or\r\npersons who should seize the Pretender, dead or alive. Great naval\r\nand military preparations were made, and the trained bands were kept\r\nin readiness to suppress tumults.\r\n\r\nAs early as May, a report was current among the Jacobites of Scotland\r\nof the Chevalier’s design to make a descent, in consequence of\r\nwhich they began to bestir themselves, by providing arms, horses,\r\n&c. Lockhart of Carnwath, a very warm partisan of the Chevalier,\r\nwhile “solacing” himself, as he says, with the expectation of\r\nhearing “great and good news,” had his house surrounded by a strong\r\ndetachment of Lord Shannon’s regiment of foot, which carried him\r\nprisoner to the castle of Edinburgh, by virtue of a warrant “under\r\nthe Elector of Hanover’s own hand.” The apprehension of Lockhart\r\nserved as a signal to the other Jacobites in Scotland, against whom\r\nwarrants were issued, all of whom escaped, with the exception of\r\nthe Earls of Home and Wigton, who were taken up, and also committed\r\nprisoners to the castle.[680]\r\n\r\nOf John Erskine, the 11th Earl of Mar, the chief leader in the\r\nensuing insurrection, it may be proper to say a few words. Following\r\nthe footsteps of his father, who joined the revolution party, merely\r\nbecause he considered it his interest so to do, the young earl, on\r\nentering into public life, attached himself to the party then in\r\npower, at the head of which was the Duke of Queensberry, the leader\r\nof the Scottish Whigs. He took the oaths and his seat in parliament\r\nin September, 1696, was sworn in a privy councillor the following\r\nyear, and was afterwards appointed to the command of a regiment of\r\nfoot, and invested with the order of the Thistle. In 1704, when the\r\nWhigs were superseded by the country party, the earl, pursuant to\r\nthe line of conduct he intended to follow, of making his politics\r\nsubservient to his interest, immediately paid court to the new\r\nadministration, by placing himself at the head of such of the Duke\r\nof Queensberry’s friends as opposed the Marquis of Tweeddale and his\r\nparty. In this situation he showed so much dexterity, and managed\r\nhis opposition with so much art and address, that he was considered\r\nby the Tories as a man of probity, and well inclined to the exiled\r\nfamily. Afterwards, when the Whig party came again into power, he\r\ngave them his support, and became very zealous in promoting all the\r\nmeasures of the court, particularly the treaty of union, for which\r\nhe presented the draught of an act in parliament, in 1705. To reward\r\nhis exertions, he was, after the prorogation of the parliament,\r\nappointed secretary of state for Scotland, instead of the Marquis of\r\nAnnandale, who was displaced, because he was suspected of holding a\r\ncorrespondence with the “Squadron,” who were inclined to support the\r\nsuccession to the crown without, rather than with the proposed union.\r\nHis lordship was chosen one of the sixteen representative peers in\r\n1707, and re-elected at the general election the following year, and\r\nin 1710 and 1713. By the share he had taken in bringing about the\r\nunion, Mar had rendered himself very unpopular in Scotland; but he\r\nendeavoured to regain the favour of his countrymen, by attending a\r\ndeputation of Scottish members, consisting of the Duke of Argyle,\r\nhimself, Cockburn younger of Ormiston, and Lockhart of Carnwath,\r\nwho waited on Queen Anne in 1712, to inform her of their resolution\r\nto move for a repeal of the union with England. When the Earl of\r\nFindlater brought forward a motion for repeal in the House of Lords,\r\nMar spoke strongly in favour of it, and pressed the dissolution of\r\nthe union as the only means to preserve the peace of the island.[681]\r\nHe was made a privy-councillor in 1708, and on the death of the Duke\r\nof Queensberry in 1713, the earl was again appointed secretary of\r\nstate for Scotland, and thus, for the second time, enlisted himself\r\nunder the banners of Toryism; but an end was put to his political\r\ntergiversation by his abrupt and unceremonious dismissal from office\r\nby George I., and he vowed revenge.\r\n\r\nThough not possessed of shining talents, he made ample amends for\r\ntheir deficiencies by artifice and an insinuating and courteous\r\ndeportment, and managed his designs with such prudence and\r\ncircumspection as to render it extremely difficult to ascertain his\r\nobject when he desired concealment; by which conduct “he showed\r\nhimself,” in the opinion of a contemporary, “to be a man of good\r\nsense, but bad morals.”[682] The versatility of his politics was\r\nperhaps owing rather to the peculiar circumstances in which he was\r\nplaced than to any innate viciousness of disposition. He was a\r\nJacobite from principle, but as the fortunes of his house had been\r\ngreatly impaired in the civil war by its attachment to the Stuarts,\r\nand as, upon his entrance into public life, he found the cause of the\r\nexiled family at a low ebb, he sought to retrieve the losses which\r\nhis ancestors had sustained; while, at the same time, he gratified\r\nhis ambition, by aspiring to power, which he could only hope to\r\nacquire by attaching himself to the existing government. The loss of\r\na place of £5,000 a-year, without any chance of ever again enjoying\r\nthe sweets of office, was gall and wormwood to such a man. This\r\ndisappointment, and the studied insult he had received from the king,\r\noperating upon a selfish and ambitious spirit, drove him into open\r\nrebellion, with no other view than the gratification of his revenge.\r\nBut whatever were his qualifications in the cabinet, he was without\r\nmilitary experience, and consequently unfit to command an army, as\r\nthe result showed.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of Mar’s departure from England to place himself at the\r\nhead of the intended insurrection in Scotland, he resolved to show\r\nhimself at court; and, accordingly, he appeared in the presence of\r\nKing George on the 1st of August, with all the complaisance of a\r\ncourtier, and with that affability of demeanour for which he was\r\nso distinguished. What his motives were for thus needlessly laying\r\nhimself open to the charge of studied duplicity by confronting a\r\nsovereign whose throne he was about to attempt to overturn, it is\r\ndifficult to conjecture. Was it to solace his offended pride, or\r\nto show the world the hardihood of his determination to unfurl the\r\nstandard of revolt, that he had the cool daring, in presence of the\r\nnobles of the land, to look in the face the man against whom he had\r\ninwardly vowed to wage war? Or was his object, in thus appearing as\r\nif no treasonable design could be in his contemplation, intended as\r\na feint to deceive the court and lull suspicion, so as to enable him\r\nthe more effectually to conceal the preparations he had made for his\r\nintended departure? All of these questions might be fairly answered\r\nin the affirmative, as being in perfect conformity with the earl’s\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHaving disguised himself by changing his usual dress, he embarked\r\nat Gravesend on the 2d of August, 1715, on board a vessel bound for\r\nNewcastle, accompanied by Major-general Hamilton and Colonel Hay,\r\nand attended by two servants. On arriving at Newcastle he and his\r\nparty went on board another vessel bound for the Frith of Forth,\r\nthe property of one Spence, and were landed at Elie, a small port\r\non the Fife coast, near the mouth of the Frith. During the great\r\ncivil war, and for many years thereafter, a landing in Fife in\r\nsupport of the Stuarts would have been a dangerous attempt, but\r\nthe opinions of many of the Fife people had, of late, undergone a\r\ncomplete revolution; and, at the time in question, Fife had, as the\r\nJacobites would have said, many “honest” men, or in other words,\r\npersons who were warmly attached to the interests of the exiled\r\nfamily. From Elie, Mar proceeded to Crail, where he was met by Sir\r\nAlexander Erskine, the Lord Lyon, and other friends of the Jacobite\r\ninterest, who accompanied him to the house of “the Honest Laird,”\r\na name by which John Bethune of Balfour, a stanch Jacobite, was\r\ncommonly known. After remaining a few days in Fife, Mar paid a visit\r\nto his brother-in-law, the Earl of Kinnoul, at his seat of Dupplin\r\nin the county of Perth, whence he departed on Thursday the 18th of\r\nAugust, and crossed the Tay about two miles below Perth, with 40\r\nhorse, on his way to his seat of Kildrummy, in the Braes of Mar. On\r\nthe following day he despatched letters to the principal Jacobites,\r\ninviting them to attend a grand hunting-match at Braemar, on the\r\n27th of August. As the government was on the alert, and watched very\r\nnarrowly any unusual assemblages, the Jacobites had frequently before\r\nhad recourse to this and similar expedients to enable them to concert\r\ntheir measures without exciting the suspicion of the government.[683]\r\n\r\nThat the earl had matured his plans before coming to Scotland, and\r\nthat the Jacobites were let into the secret of his designs, is\r\nevident from the fact that, as early as the 6th of August, those\r\nin Edinburgh and the neighbourhood were aware of his intention to\r\ncome down to Scotland. On the following morning the Honourable\r\nJohn Dalzel, a captain on half pay, sent in a resignation of his\r\ncommission, that he might join with greater freedom the standard of\r\nthe earl.\r\n\r\nUnder pretence of attending the hunting-match, a considerable number\r\nof noblemen and gentlemen arrived at Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire, about\r\nthe time appointed. Among these were the Marquis of Huntly, eldest\r\nson of the Duke of Gordon; the Marquis of Tullibardine, eldest son\r\nof the Duke of Athole; the Earls of Nithsdale, Marischal, Traquair,\r\nErrol, Southesk, Carnwath, Seaforth, Linlithgow, and others; the\r\nViscounts Kilsyth, Kenmure, Kingston, and Stormont; Lords Rollo,\r\nDuffus, Drummond, Strathallan, Ogilvie, and Nairne; and about\r\ntwenty-six gentlemen of influence in the Highlands, among whom were\r\nGenerals Hamilton and Gordon, Glengary, Campbell of Glendaruel, and\r\nthe lairds of Auchterhouse and Auldbar.[684]\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting had assembled, the earl proceeded to address his\r\nfriends in a regular and well-ordered speech. He began by expressing\r\nhis sorrow for having been instrumental in forwarding the union of\r\nthe two kingdoms. He informed them that his eyes were now opened, and\r\nthat he clearly perceived the error he had committed; that he would\r\ntherefore do every thing in his power to make his countrymen again a\r\nfree people, and restore to them their ancient liberties which had\r\nbeen surrendered into the hands of the English by the accursed treaty\r\nof union. That this treaty, which had already done so much injury to\r\nScotland, was calculated to inflict additional grievances upon it,\r\nand that such were the designs of the English appeared evident by\r\nthe measures which had been daily pursued ever since the Elector of\r\nHanover had ascended the throne. That this prince regarded neither\r\nthe welfare of his people, nor their religion; but had committed the\r\ncharge of both entirely to a set of men who, while they stuck to the\r\nProtestant succession, made such alterations in church and state as\r\nthey thought fit. That they had already begun to encroach upon the\r\nliberties of both, on which account he had resolved to vindicate\r\ntheir rights by placing the lawful sovereign, James VIII., who had\r\npromised to hear their grievances and redress their wrongs, upon the\r\nthrone of his ancestors. He then informed them of his determination\r\nto take up arms in behalf of his lawful king: that he would summon\r\nall the fencible men among his own tenantry, and with them hazard\r\nhis life in the cause; and he exhorted all those assembled to follow\r\nhis example. To encourage them to do so, he assured them that there\r\nwould be a general rising in England in support of the cause; that\r\nthey would receive powerful assistance from France, whither the Duke\r\nof Ormond and Lord Bolingbroke had gone to induce Louis XIV. to aid\r\nand assist them with men and money; and that the Duke of Berwick\r\nwould certainly land in the West of England with a large force.\r\nThat there were thousands of persons throughout the kingdom who had\r\nsolemnly pledged themselves to him, and to one another, to join\r\nhim in deposing King George, and establishing James VIII. on the\r\nthrone. He then informed them that he had received letters (which he\r\nexhibited) under the hand of James himself, from Lorraine, promising\r\nto come over to Scotland and place his person under the protection\r\nof the valour and fidelity of his Scottish subjects; and that, in\r\nthe meantime, ships, provided with arms, ammunition, and other\r\nmilitary stores, would be sent over from France as soon as a landing\r\nport should be fixed upon. He thereupon produced, or stated that\r\nhe had in his possession, a commission from James, appointing him\r\nhis Lieutenant-general, and commander of all the Jacobite forces in\r\nScotland, and informed the meeting that he was furnished with money,\r\nand that an arrangement had been made by which he would be enabled to\r\npay regularly the troops that should be raised, so that no gentleman\r\nwho might join his standard, with his followers, would be put to any\r\nexpense, and the country would be quite relieved from the burden\r\nof supporting the war. After the earl had finished his harangue,\r\nthe meeting unanimously resolved to take up arms in support of the\r\nChevalier; and after taking an oath of fidelity to the earl as the\r\nrepresentative of James VIII. and to each other, the persons present\r\ntook leave of him, and promised to return immediately to their\r\nestates and raise their men, and to hold themselves in readiness to\r\njoin the earl on the first summons. To enlist the feelings of the\r\npeople in favour of the prince, copies of his manifesto, of which\r\neach individual who attended the meeting obtained a supply from the\r\nearl, were industriously circulated throughout the country, and dropt\r\nin the streets of the different towns in Scotland during night.\r\n\r\nThe government was not inattentive to the proceedings of the\r\nJacobites, and measures were adopted immediately by the Lord Advocate\r\nfor securing the chiefs. Under the authority of an act passed on\r\nthe 30th of August, a large number of noblemen and gentlemen, of\r\nwhom a great proportion belonged to the Highlands, were summoned by\r\nhim to appear at Edinburgh within certain specified periods, under\r\nthe pain of a year’s imprisonment and other penalties, to give bail\r\nfor their allegiance to the government. Among them was Rob Roy. The\r\ntime allowed for the appearance of such as resided to the south of\r\nthe river Tay, was seven days, to those on the north, fifteen,\r\nand to such as might be out of Scotland, sixty days after the day\r\nof citation. Very few of them however appeared, and the remainder,\r\nalmost without exception, rushed at once into the insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe confederated chiefs had scarcely all of them reached their\r\nrespective homes, when they were again summoned by Mar to meet\r\nhim at Aboyne, on the 3d of September, to concert measures for\r\nappearing immediately in arms. Some of those who resided only a\r\nshort distance from the appointed rendezvous, attended, and having\r\nreceived instructions to assemble their men, and to join him without\r\ndelay, at Kirkmichael, a village in Braemar, they returned to their\r\nestates, and sent round the fiery cross to summon their followers to\r\nthe field. With 60 followers only, Mar proclaimed the Chevalier at\r\nCastletown in Braemar, after which he proceeded to Kirkmichael, where\r\non the 6th of September he raised his standard, which was consecrated\r\nby prayer, in presence, according to some accounts, of a force of\r\n2,000 men, mostly consisting of horse.[685] When the standard was in\r\nthe course of being erected, the ball on the top of the pole fell\r\noff, an incident which was regarded by the superstitious Highlanders\r\nas a bad omen, and which threw a damp over the proceedings of the day.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mar intimated by a circular letter to the\r\ngentlemen of Perthshire, his appointment to the chief command of\r\nall King James’s forces in Scotland, and he required them to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to join him with their vassals when called\r\nupon. He also directed them to secure the arms of such persons as\r\nwere hostile to the cause of King James, and desired they would\r\nprevent their men from plundering, or living at free quarters, upon\r\nhis Majesty’s subjects. “The King,” he observes, “makes no doubt of\r\nyour zeal for his service, especially at this juncture when his cause\r\nis so deeply concerned, and the relieving of our native country from\r\noppression and a foreign yoke, too heavy for us and our posterity to\r\nbear, and when now is the time to endeavour the restoring, not only\r\nour rightful and native king, but also our country to its ancient,\r\nfree, and independent constitution under him, whose ancestors have\r\nreigned over us for so many generations.”\r\n\r\nTwo days thereafter the earl published a high-flown declaration, in\r\nwhich he summons, “in his Majesty’s name and authority,” and “by\r\nthe King’s special order to me thereunto,” all faithful and loving\r\nsubjects to raise their fencible men with their best arms, and to\r\njoin him at the Inver of Mar on the following Monday, “in order to\r\nproceed in our march to attend the king’s standard with his other\r\nforces. The king intending that his forces shall be paid from the\r\ntime of their first setting out, he expects, as he positively orders,\r\nthat they behave themselves civilly, and commit no plundering or\r\nother disorders, upon the highest penalties, and his displeasure,\r\nwhich is expected you’l see observed.”\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to this high-flown and liberty-sounding document, the\r\nfollowing singular letter, written by the earl to his baillie in the\r\nlordship of Kildrummy, on the evening of the day on which the above\r\ndeclaration was issued, is curious. It exhibits, in a remarkable\r\npoint of view, the despotic power which, even down to such a modern\r\nperiod, a feudal or rather a Highland chief considered himself\r\nentitled to exercise with impunity over his vassals. Had such an\r\norder been issued by a baron, who had scarcely ever gone beyond\r\nthe boundaries of his own demesnes, it might have been passed over\r\nwithout remark, as in perfect keeping with the ideas of a feudal\r\ndespot; but to see the refined courtier threatening his own vassals\r\nand tenants with destruction, and even extermination, merely because\r\nthey hesitated to take up arms in opposition to the government under\r\nwhich they lived, and under which the earl himself had served, is\r\nindeed very extraordinary:--\r\n\r\n  “INVERCAULD, _Sept. 9, at night, 1715_.\r\n\r\n  “Jocke,--Ye was in the right not to come with the hundred men\r\n  ye sent up to-night, when I expected four times the number. It\r\n  is a pretty thing, when all the Highlands of Scotland are now\r\n  rising upon their king and country’s account, as I have accounts\r\n  from them since they were with me, and the gentlemen of our\r\n  neighbouring lowlands expecting us down to join them, that my\r\n  men should be only refractory. Is not this the thing we are now\r\n  about, which they have been wishing these twenty-six years? And\r\n  now, when it is come, and the king and country’s cause is at\r\n  stake, will they for ever sit still and see all perish? I have\r\n  used gentle means too long, and so I shall be forced to put\r\n  other orders I have in execution. I have sent you enclosed an\r\n  order for the lordship of Kildrummy, which you are immediately\r\n  to intimate to all my vassals: if they give ready obedience,\r\n  it will make some amends, and if not ye may tell them from me,\r\n  that it will not be in my power to save them (were I willing)\r\n  from being treated as enemies, by those who are ready soon to\r\n  join me; and they may depend on it, that I will be the first\r\n  to propose, and order their being so. Particularly, let my own\r\n  tenants in Kildrummy know, that if they come not forth with their\r\n  best arms, that I will send a party immediately to burn what they\r\n  shall miss taking from them. And they may believe this not only\r\n  a threat, but, by all that’s sacred, I’ll put it in execution,\r\n  let my loss be what it will, that it may be an example to others.\r\n  You are to tell the gentlemen that I’ll expect them in their\r\n  best accoutrements, on horseback, and no excuse to be accepted\r\n  of. Go about this with all diligence, and come yourself and let\r\n  me know your having done so. All this is not only as ye will be\r\n  answerable to me, but to your king and country.\r\n\r\n  “Your assured friend and servant,\r\n\r\n  “MAR.”\r\n\r\n  “_To John Forbes of Inverau,\r\n  Bailie of Kildrummy._”\r\n\r\nWhile the Jacobite chiefs were collecting their forces, an event\r\noccurred which ought to have induced them to abandon, at least for a\r\ntime, an enterprise signalized by such an untoward beginning. This\r\nwas the death of Louis XIV., who expired on the 1st of September,\r\nafter a short illness. An occurrence more unfortunate to the cause\r\nof the Chevalier could scarcely have happened at such a conjuncture,\r\nas it tended to damp the spirits of his partisans, who looked upon\r\nLouis as the main prop of the cause. On receipt of this intelligence,\r\nthe chiefs held a meeting to consult upon the course they ought to\r\npursue under this new aspect of matters. Some of the more moderate\r\nwere for returning home, and remaining quiet till the arrival of\r\nthe Chevalier, should he receive any encouragement from the new\r\ngovernment of France to proceed on his intended voyage; but the\r\nmajority argued that they had already gone too far to recede with\r\nsafety, and that as a general insurrection would take place in\r\nEngland in favour of the Chevalier, they should take the field\r\nforthwith. An immediate appeal to arms having been resolved upon,\r\nmessengers were despatched to France to urge the Chevalier to hasten\r\nhis departure, and the following notable manifesto, which had been\r\nprivately printed at Edinburgh by Freebairn, one of the king’s\r\nprinters, was issued at the same time:--\r\n\r\n  “Manifesto by the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, who dutifully\r\n  appear at this time in asserting the undoubted rights of their\r\n  lawful sovereign, James the Eighth, by the grace of God, king of\r\n  Scotland, England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith,\r\n  &c.; and for relieving this, his ancient kingdom, from the\r\n  oppressions and grievances it lies under.\r\n\r\n  “His majesty’s right of blood to the crowns of these realms is\r\n  undoubted, and has never been disputed or arraigned by the least\r\n  circumstance or lawful authority. By the laws of God, by the\r\n  ancient constitutions, and by the positive unrepealed laws of the\r\n  land, we are bound to pay his majesty the duty of loyal subjects.\r\n  Nothing can absolve us from this our duty of subjection and\r\n  obedience. The laws of God require our allegiance to our rightful\r\n  king--the laws of the land secure our religion and other interests;\r\n  and his majesty giving up himself to the support of his Protestant\r\n  subjects, puts the means of securing to us our concerns, religious\r\n  and civil, in our own hands. Our fundamental constitution has been\r\n  entirely altered and sunk amidst the various shocks of unstable\r\n  faction, while, in searching out new expedients pretended for our\r\n  security, it has produced nothing but daily disappointments, and\r\n  has brought us and our posterity under a precarious dependence upon\r\n  foreign councils and interests, and the power of foreign troops.\r\n  The late unhappy union which was brought about by the mistaken\r\n  notions of some, and the ruinous and selfish designs of others, has\r\n  proved so far from lessening and healing the differences betwixt\r\n  his majesty’s subjects of Scotland and England, that it has widened\r\n  and increased them. And it appears by experience so inconsistent\r\n  with the rights, privileges, and interests of us, and our good\r\n  neighbours and fellow-subjects of England, that the continuance\r\n  of it must inevitably ruin us, and hurt them; nor can any way be\r\n  found out to relieve us, and restore our ancient and independent\r\n  constitution, but by the restoring our rightful and natural king,\r\n  who has the only undoubted right to reign over us. Neither can\r\n  we hope that the party who chiefly contributed to bring us into\r\n  bondage, will at any time endeavour to work our relief, since it\r\n  is known how strenuously they opposed, in two late instances, the\r\n  efforts that were made by all Scotsmen by themselves, and supported\r\n  by the best and wisest of the English, towards so desirable an end,\r\n  as they will not adventure openly to disown the dissolution of the\r\n  union to be. Our substance has been wasted in the late ruinous\r\n  wars, and we see an unavoidable prospect of having wars continued\r\n  on us and our posterity so long as the possession of the crown\r\n  is not in the right line. The hereditary rights of the subjects,\r\n  though confirmed by conventions and parliaments, are now treated\r\n  as of no value or force, and past services to the crown and royal\r\n  family are now looked upon as grounds of suspicion. A packed up\r\n  assembly, who call themselves a British parliament, have, so far\r\n  as in them lies, inhumanely murdered their own and our sovereign,\r\n  by promising a good sum of money as the reward of so execrable\r\n  a crime. They have proscribed, by unaccountable and groundless\r\n  impeachments and attainders, the worthy patriots of England, for\r\n  their honourable and successful endeavours to restore trade,\r\n  plenty, and peace to these nations.\r\n\r\n  “They have broken in upon the sacred laws of both countries by\r\n  which the liberty of our persons was secured, and they have\r\n  empowered a foreign prince, (who, notwithstanding his expectations\r\n  of the crown for fifteen years, is still unacquainted with our\r\n  manners, customs, and language,) to make an absolute conquest (if\r\n  not timely prevented) of the three kingdoms, by investing himself\r\n  with an unlimited power, not only of raising unnecessary forces at\r\n  home, but also of calling in foreign troops, ready to promote his\r\n  uncontrollable designs. Nor can we be ever hopeful of its being\r\n  otherwise, in the way it is at present, for some generations to\r\n  come. And the sad consequences of these unexampled proceedings have\r\n  really been so fatal to great numbers of our kinsmen, friends, and\r\n  fellow-subjects of both kingdoms, that they have been constrained\r\n  to abandon their country, houses, wives and children, to give\r\n  themselves up prisoners, and perhaps victims, to be sacrificed to\r\n  the pleasure of foreigners, and a few hot-headed men of a restless\r\n  faction, whom they employ. Our troops abroad, notwithstanding their\r\n  long and remarkable good services, have been treated, since the\r\n  peace, with neglect and contempt, and particularly in Holland; and\r\n  it is not now the officers’ long service, merit, and blood they\r\n  have lost, but money and favour by which they can obtain justice\r\n  in their preferments. So that it is evident the safety of his\r\n  majesty’s person, and independency of his kingdoms, call loudly for\r\n  immediate relief and defence.\r\n\r\n  “The consideration of these unhappy circumstances, with the due\r\n  regard we have to common justice, the peace and quiet of us and\r\n  our posterity, and our duty to his majesty, and his commands,\r\n  are the powerful motives which have engaged us in our present\r\n  undertaking, which we are firmly and heartily resolved to push to\r\n  the utmost, and stand by one another to the last extremity, as the\r\n  only solid and effectual means for putting an end to so dreadful a\r\n  prospect, as by our present situation we have before our eyes, and\r\n  with faithful hearts true to our rightful king, our country, and\r\n  our neighbours, we earnestly beseech and expect, as his majesty\r\n  commands, the assistance of all our true fellow-subjects to second\r\n  our attempt; declaring hereby our sincere intentions that we will\r\n  promote and concur in all lawful means for settling a lasting peace\r\n  to these lands, under the auspicious government of our native-born\r\n  rightful sovereign, the direction of our own domestic councils, and\r\n  the protection of our native forces and troops. That we will in the\r\n  same manner concur and endeavour to have our laws, liberties, and\r\n  properties, secured by the parliaments of both kingdoms; that by\r\n  the wisdom of such parliaments we will endeavour to have such laws\r\n  enacted as shall give absolute security to us, and future ages, for\r\n  the Protestant religion, against all efforts of arbitrary power,\r\n  popery, and all its other enemies.\r\n\r\n  “Nor have we any reason to be distrustful of the goodness of God,\r\n  the truth and purity of our holy religion, or the known excellency\r\n  of his majesty’s judgment, as not to hope, that in due time, good\r\n  examples and conversation with our learned divines, will remove\r\n  those prejudices, which we know his education in a Popish country\r\n  has not riveted in his royal discerning mind; and we are sure, as\r\n  justice is a virtue in all religions and professions, so the doing\r\n  of it to him will not lessen his good opinion of ours. That as the\r\n  king is willing to give his royal indemnity for all that is past,\r\n  so he will cheerfully concur in passing general acts of oblivion,\r\n  that our fellow-subjects, who have been misled, may have a fair\r\n  opportunity of living with us in the same friendly manner that\r\n  we design to live with them. That we will use our endeavours for\r\n  redressing the bad usage of our troops abroad, and bringing the\r\n  troops at home on the same footing and establishment of pay, as\r\n  those of England. That we will sincerely and heartily go into such\r\n  measures as shall maintain effectually, and establish, a right,\r\n  firm, and lasting union betwixt his majesty’s ancient kingdom\r\n  of Scotland, and our good neighbours and fellow-subjects of the\r\n  kingdom of England.\r\n\r\n  “The peace of these nations being thus settled and we freed from\r\n  foreign dangers, we will use our endeavours to have the army\r\n  reduced to the usual number of guards and garrisons; and will\r\n  concur in such laws and methods, as shall relieve us of the\r\n  heavy taxes and debts now lying upon us, and at the same time,\r\n  will support the public credit in all its parts. And we hereby\r\n  faithfully promise and engage that every officer who joins with us\r\n  in our king and country’s cause shall not only enjoy the same post\r\n  he now does, but shall be advanced and preferred according to his\r\n  rank and station and the number of men he brings off with him to\r\n  us. And each foot soldier so joining us shall have twenty shillings\r\n  sterling, and each trooper or dragoon, who brings horse and\r\n  accoutrements along with him, £12 sterling gratuity, besides their\r\n  pay; and in general we shall concur with all our fellow subjects in\r\n  such measures as shall make us flourish at home, and be formidable\r\n  abroad, under our rightful sovereign, and the peaceable harmony of\r\n  our ancient fundamental constitution, undisturbed by a pretender’s\r\n  interests and councils from abroad, or a restless faction at home.\r\n  In so honourable, so good, and just a cause, we do not doubt of the\r\n  assistance, direction, and blessing of Almighty God, who has so\r\n  often succoured the royal family of Stuarts, and our country from\r\n  sinking under oppression.”\r\n\r\nA document better calculated to arouse the national feeling could\r\nnot have been penned. Every topic which could excite a spirit of\r\ndisaffection against the government then existing is artfully\r\nintroduced, and enforced with an energy of diction and an apparent\r\nstrength of reasoning admirably fitted for exciting the spirit of a\r\npeople living, as they imagined, in a state of national degradation.\r\nBut this manifesto which, a few years before, would have set the\r\nwhole of Scotland in a flame, produced little or no effect in those\r\nquarters where alone it was necessary to make such an appeal.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[674] Rae’s _History of the late Rebellion_.

And we do hereby declare to your lordship, that as\r\n  we were always ready to follow your directions in serving Queen\r\n  Anne, so we will now be equally forward to concur with your\r\n  lordship in faithfully serving King George. And we entreat your\r\n  lordship would advise as how we may best offer our duty to his\r\n  majesty upon his coming over to Britain; and on all occasions we\r\n  will beg to receive your counsel and direction how we may be most\r\n  useful to his royal government.\r\n\r\n  “We are, with all truth and respect,” &c.\r\n\r\n[679] There is little difficulty in perceiving, by comparing\r\nthis letter with that written by Mar to the king, that it is the\r\nproduction of Mar himself, though said to be drawn up by his brother,\r\nLord Grange. “The balance in the affairs of Europe,” an expression\r\nsince changed into that of the “balance of power,” is a phrase which\r\ncould have occurred only to a secretary of state.

Apprehensive of a general rising in England, particularly\r\nin the west, where a spirit of disaffection had often displayed\r\nitself, and to which the insurrection in Scotland was, it was\r\nbelieved, intended as a diversion; the government, instead of\r\ndespatching troops to Scotland, posted the whole disposable force\r\nin the disaffected districts, at convenient distances, by which\r\ndisposition, considerable bodies could be assembled together to\r\nassist each other in case of need. The wisdom of this plan soon\r\nbecame apparent, as there can be no doubt, that had an army been sent\r\ninto Scotland to suppress the rebellion in the north, an insurrection\r\nwould have broken out in England, which might have been fatal to the\r\ngovernment.[686]\r\n\r\nTo strengthen, however, the military force in Scotland, the\r\nregiments of Forfar, Orrery, and Hill, were recalled from Ireland.\r\nThese arrived at Edinburgh about the 24th of August, and were soon\r\nthereafter despatched along with other troops to the west, under\r\nMajor-general Wightman, for the purpose of securing the fords of the\r\nForth, and the pass of Stirling. These troops being upon the reduced\r\nestablishment, did not exceed 1,600 men, a force inadequate for the\r\nprotection of such an important post. Orders were, therefore, sent\r\nto the Earl of Stair’s regiment of dragoons and two foot regiments,\r\nwhich lay in the north of England, to march to the camp in the park\r\nof Stirling with all expedition, and at the same time, Evans’s\r\nregiment of dragoons, and Clyton’s and Wightman’s regiments of foot\r\nwere recalled from Ireland.[687]\r\n\r\nDuring the time the camp was forming at Stirling, the friends of\r\nthe Chevalier at Edinburgh formed the daring project of seizing the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh, the possession of which would have been of vast\r\nimportance to the Jacobite cause. Lord Drummond, a Catholic, was\r\nat the head of this party, which consisted of about 90 gentlemen\r\nselected for the purpose, about one half of whom were Highlanders.\r\nIn the event of success, each of the adventurers was to receive\r\n£100 sterling and a commission in the army. To facilitate their\r\ndesign, they employed one Arthur, who had formerly been an ensign\r\nin the Scotch guards, to corrupt some of the soldiers in the\r\ngarrison, and who by money and promises of preferment induced a\r\nsergeant, a corporal, and two sentinels to enter into the views of\r\nthe conspirators. These engaged to attend at a certain place upon\r\nthe wall, on the north, near the Sally-port, in order to assist the\r\nconspirators in their ascent. The latter had prepared a scaling\r\nladder made of ropes, capable of holding several men abreast, and\r\nhad so contrived it, that it could be drawn up through means of\r\npulleys, by a small rope which the soldiers were to fasten behind the\r\nwall. Having completed their arrangements, they fixed on the 9th of\r\nSeptember for the attempt, being the day after the last detachment\r\nof the government troops quartered in camp in St. Anne’s Yards,\r\nnear Edinburgh, had set off for Stirling. But the projectors of this\r\nwell-concerted enterprise were doomed to lament its failure when\r\nalmost on the eve of completion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edinburgh Castle in 1715, from the North-East. From an\r\nold print.]\r\n\r\nArthur, the officer who had bribed the soldiers, having engaged\r\nhis brother, a physician in Edinburgh, in the Jacobite interest,\r\nlet him into the secret of the design upon the castle. Dr. Arthur,\r\nwho appears to have been a man of a timorous disposition, grew\r\nalarmed at this intelligence, and so deep had been the impression\r\nmade upon his mind while contemplating the probable consequences of\r\nsuch a step, that on the day before the attempt his spirits became\r\nso depressed as to attract the notice of his wife, who importuned\r\nhim to inform her of the cause. He complied, and his wife, without\r\nacquainting him, sent an anonymous letter to Sir Adam Cockburn of\r\nOrmiston, Lord-Justice-Clerk, acquainting him with the conspiracy.\r\nCockburn received this letter at ten o’clock at night, and sent it\r\noff with a letter from himself to Lieutenant-colonel Stuart, the\r\ndeputy-governor of the castle, who received the communication shortly\r\nbefore eleven. Stuart lost no time in ordering the officers to double\r\ntheir guards and make diligent rounds; but probably supposing that\r\nno attempt would be made that night he went to bed after issuing\r\nthese instructions. In the meantime, the conspirators had assembled\r\nat a tavern preparatory to their attempt, but unfortunately for\r\nits success they lingered over their cups far beyond the time they\r\nhad fixed upon for putting their project into execution. In fact,\r\nthey did not assemble at the bottom of the wall till after the\r\ndeputy-governor had issued his orders; but ignorant of what had\r\npassed within the castle, they proceeded to tie the rope, which had\r\nbeen let down by the soldiers, to the ladder. Unhappily for the\r\nwhole party, the hour for changing the sentinels had arrived, and\r\nwhile the traitorous soldiers were in the act of drawing up the\r\nladder, one Lieutenant Lindsay, at the head of a party of fresh\r\nsentinels, came upon them on his way to the sally-port. The soldiers,\r\nalarmed at the approach of Lindsay’s party, immediately slipt the\r\nrope, one of them at the same time discharging his piece at the\r\nassailants to divert suspicion from himself. The noise which this\r\noccurrence produced told the conspirators that they were discovered,\r\non which they dispersed. A party of the town-guard which the Lord\r\nProvost, at the request of the Lord-Justice-Clerk, had sent to patrol\r\nabout the castle, attracted by the firing, immediately rushed from\r\nthe West-Port, and repaired to the spot, but all the conspirators,\r\nwith the exception of four whom they secured, had escaped. These\r\nwere one Captain Maclean, an officer who had fought under Dundee at\r\nKilliecrankie, whom they found lying on the ground much injured by a\r\nfall from the ladder or from a precipice; Alexander Ramsay and George\r\nBoswell, writers in Edinburgh; and one Lesly, who had been in the\r\nservice of the same Duchess of Gordon who had distinguished herself\r\nin the affair of the medal. This party picked up the ladder and a\r\nquantity of muskets and carbines which the conspirators had thrown\r\naway in their flight.[688]\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of an enterprise which had been matured with\r\ngreat judgment, and which would probably have succeeded, but for\r\nthe trifling circumstance above mentioned. The capture of such an\r\nimportant fortress as the castle of Edinburgh, at such a time, would\r\nhave been of vast importance to the Jacobites, inasmuch as it would\r\nnot only have afforded them an abundant supply of military stores,\r\nwith which it was then well provided, and put them in possession of a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, but would also have served as a rallying\r\npoint to the disaffected living to the south of the Forth, who only\r\nwaited a favourable opportunity to declare themselves. Besides giving\r\nthem the command of the city, the possession of the castle by a\r\nJacobite force would have compelled the commander of the government\r\nforces to withdraw the greater part of his troops from Stirling, and\r\nleave that highly important post exposed to the northern insurgents.\r\nHad the attempt succeeded, Lord Drummond, the contriver of the\r\ndesign, was to have been made governor of the castle, and notice\r\nof its capture was to have been announced to some of the Jacobite\r\npartisans on the opposite coast of Fife, by firing three cannon-shots\r\nfrom its battlements. On hearing the report of the guns, these men\r\nwere instantly to have communicated the intelligence to the Earl of\r\nMar, who was to hasten south with all his forces.[689]\r\n\r\nAs the appointment of a person of rank, influence, and talent, to\r\nthe command of the army, destined to oppose the Earl of Mar, was of\r\ngreat importance, the Duke of Argyle, who had served with distinction\r\nabroad, and who had formerly acted as commander-in-chief of the\r\nforces in Scotland, was pitched upon as generalissimo of the army\r\nencamped at Stirling. Having received instructions from his majesty\r\non the 8th of September, he departed for Scotland the following day,\r\naccompanied by some of the Scottish nobility, and other persons of\r\ndistinction, and arrived at Edinburgh on the 14th. About the same\r\ntime, the Earl of Sutherland, who had offered his services to raise\r\nthe clans in the northern Highlands, in support of the government,\r\nwas sent down from London to Leith in a ship of war, with orders\r\nto obtain a supply of arms and ammunition from the governor of the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh. He arrived on the 21st of September, and after\r\ngiving instructions for the shipment of these supplies, departed for\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Argyle reached Edinburgh, he found that Mar had\r\nmade considerable progress in the insurrection, and that the regular\r\nforces at Stirling were far inferior in point of numbers to those of\r\nthe Jacobite commander. He, therefore, on the day he arrived in the\r\ncapital, addressed a letter to the magistrates of Glasgow, (who, on\r\nthe first appearance of the insurrection, had offered, in a letter to\r\nLord Townshend, one of the secretaries of state, to raise 600 men in\r\nsupport of the government, at the expense of the city,) requesting\r\nthem to send forthwith 500 or 600 men to Stirling, under the command\r\nof such officers as they should think fit to appoint, to join the\r\nforces stationed there. In compliance with this demand, there were\r\ndespatched to Stirling, on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of September,\r\nthree battalions, amounting to between 600 and 700 men, under the\r\nnominal command of the Lord Provost, who deputed the active part\r\nof his duties to Colonel Blackadder. On the arrival of the first\r\nbattalion, the duke addressed a second letter from Stirling to the\r\nmagistrates of Glasgow, thanking them for their promptitude, and\r\nrequesting them to send intimation, with the greatest despatch, to\r\nall the friends of the government in the west, to assemble all the\r\nfencible forces at Glasgow, and to hold them in readiness to march\r\nwhen required. In connexion with these instructions, the duke, at\r\nthe same time, wrote letters of a similar import to the magistrates\r\nof all the well affected burghs, and to private individuals who\r\nwere known to be favourably disposed. The most active measures were\r\naccordingly adopted in the south and west by the friends of the\r\ngovernment, and in a short time a sufficient force was raised to keep\r\nthe disaffected in these districts in check.[690]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Earl of Mar and his friends were no less active\r\nin preparing for the campaign. Pursuant to an arrangement with\r\nthe Jacobite chiefs, General Gordon, an officer of great bravery\r\nand experience, was despatched into the Highlands to raise the\r\nnorth-western clans, with instructions either to join Mar with\r\nsuch forces as he could collect at the fords of the Forth, or to\r\nmarch upon Glasgow by Dumbarton. Having collected a body of between\r\n4,000 and 5,000 men, chiefly Macdonalds, Macleans, and Camerons,\r\nGordon attempted to surprise Fort-William, and succeeded so far as\r\nto carry by surprise some of the outworks, sword in hand, in which\r\nwere a lieutenant, sergeant, and 25 men; but as the garrison made\r\na determined resistance, he withdrew his men, and marched towards\r\nInverary. This route, it is said, was taken at the suggestion of\r\nCampbell of Glendaruel, who, at the first meeting of the Jacobites,\r\nhad assured Mar and his friends that if the more northern clans\r\nwould take Argyleshire in their way to the south, their numbers\r\nwould be greatly increased by the Macleans, Macdonalds, Macdougalls,\r\nMacneills, and the other Macs of that county, together with a\r\ngreat number of Campbells, of the family and followers of the\r\nEarl of Breadalbane, Sir James Campbell of Auchinbreck, and Sir\r\nDuncan Campbell of Lochnell; all of whom, he said, would join in\r\nthe insurrection, when they saw the other clans in that country at\r\nhand to protect them against those in the interest of the Duke of\r\nArgyle.[691]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Islay, brother to the Duke of Argyle, heard of\r\nGeneral Gordon’s movements, he assembled about 2,500 men to prevent a\r\nrising of the clans in Argyle, and of the disaffected branches of the\r\nname of Campbell. On arriving before Inverary, General Gordon found\r\nthe place protected by entrenchments which the earl had thrown up. He\r\ndid not venture on an attack, but contented himself with encamping at\r\nthe north-east side of the town, at nearly the distance of a mile,\r\nwhere he continued some days without any hostile attempt being made\r\non either side. It was evidently contrary to Gordon’s plan to hazard\r\nan action, his sole design in entering Argyleshire being to give an\r\nopportunity to the Jacobite population of that district to join his\r\nstandard, which the keeping of such a large body of men locked up in\r\nInverary would greatly assist.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance before Inverary of the “Black Camp,” as\r\nGeneral Gordon’s party was denominated by the Campbells, the Earl of\r\nIslay and his men were kept in a state of continual alarm from the\r\nmost trifling causes. On one occasion an amusing incident occurred,\r\nwhich excited the fears of the Campbells, and showed how greatly they\r\ndreaded an attack. Some time before this occurrence, a small body\r\nof horse from Kintyre had joined the earl: the men were quartered\r\nin the town, but the horses were put out to graze on the east side\r\nof the small river that runs past Inverary. The horses disliking\r\ntheir quarters, took their departure one night in search of better\r\npasture. They sought their way along the shore for the purpose\r\nof crossing the river at the lower end of the town. The trampling\r\nof their hoofs on the gravel being heard at some distance by the\r\ngarrison, the earl’s men were thrown into the utmost consternation,\r\nas they had no doubt that the enemy was advancing to attack them. As\r\nthe horses were at full gallop, and advancing nearer every moment,\r\nthe noise increasing as they approached, nothing but terror was\r\nto be seen in every face. With trembling hands they seized their\r\narms and put themselves in a defensive posture to repel the attack,\r\nbut they were fortunately soon relieved from the panic they had\r\nbeen thrown into by some of the horses which had passed the river\r\napproaching without riders; so that “at last,” says the narrator\r\nof this anecdote, “the whole was found only to be a plot among the\r\nKintyre horse to desert not to the enemy, but to their own country;\r\nfor ’tis to be supposed the horses, as well as their owners, were of\r\nvery loyal principles.”[692]\r\n\r\nShortly after this event, another occurrence took place, which\r\nterminated not quite so ridiculously as the other. One night the\r\nsergeant on duty, when going his rounds at the quarter of the town\r\nopposite to the place where the clans lay, happened to make some\r\nmistake in the watchword. The sentinel on duty supposing the sergeant\r\nand his party to be enemies, discharged his piece at them. The earl,\r\nalarmed at the firing, immediately ordered the drums to beat to\r\narms, and in a short time the whole of his men were assembled on the\r\ncastle-green, where they were drawn up in battalions in regular order\r\nby torch or candle light, the night being extremely dark. As soon as\r\nthey were marshalled, the earl gave them orders to fire in platoons\r\ntowards the quarter whence they supposed the enemy was approaching,\r\nand, accordingly, they opened a brisk fire, which was kept up for\r\na considerable time, by which several of their own sentinels in\r\nreturning from their posts were wounded. Whilst the Campbells were\r\nthus employed upon the castle-green, several gentlemen, some say\r\ngeneral officers, who liked to fight “under covert,” retired to the\r\nsquare tower or castle of Inverary, from the windows of which they\r\nissued their orders. When the earl found that he had no enemy to\r\ncontend with, he ordered his men to cease firing, and to continue all\r\nnight under arms. This humorous incident, however, was attended with\r\ngood consequences to the terrified Campbells, as it had the effect of\r\nrelieving them from the presence of the enemy. General Gordon, who\r\nhad not the most distant intention of entering the town, on hearing\r\nthe close and regular firing from the garrison, concluded that some\r\nforces had entered the town, to celebrate whose arrival the firing\r\nhad taken place, and alarmed for his own safety, sounded a retreat\r\ntowards Perthshire before day-light.[693]\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, had the clans left Inverary, than a detachment of\r\nthe Earl of Breadalbane’s men, to the number of about 500, entered\r\nthe county under the command of Campbell of Glenlyon. To expel\r\nthem, the Earl of Islay sent a select body of about 700 men, in the\r\ndirection of Lorn, under the command of Colonel Campbell of Fanab, an\r\nold and experienced officer, who came up with Glenlyon’s detachment\r\nat Glenscheluch, a small village at the end of the lake called\r\nLochnell, in the mid division of Lorn, about 20 miles distant from\r\nInverary. Both sides immediately prepared for battle, and to lighten\r\nthemselves as much as possible, the men threw off their plaids and\r\nother incumbrances. Whilst both parties were standing gazing on each\r\nother with fury in their looks, waiting for the signal to commence\r\nbattle, a parley was proposed, in consequence of which, a conference\r\nwas held by the commanders half-way between the lines. The result\r\nwas, that the Breadalbane-men, to spare the effusion of the Campbell\r\nblood, agreed to lay down their arms on condition of being allowed\r\nto march out of the country without disturbance. These terms being\r\ncommunicated to both detachments, were approved of by a loud shout of\r\njoy, and hostages were immediately exchanged on both sides for the\r\ndue performance of the articles. The Earl of Islay, on coming up with\r\nthe remainder of his forces, was dissatisfied with the terms of the\r\ncapitulation, as he considered that he had it in his power to cut off\r\nGlenlyon’s party; but he was persuaded to accede to the articles,\r\nwhich were accordingly honourably observed on both sides.[694]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Earl of Mar had collected a considerable force,\r\nwith which he marched, about the middle of September, to Moulinearn,\r\na small village in Athole, where he proclaimed the Chevalier. On\r\nentering Athole, he was joined by 500 Athole-men, under the Marquis\r\nof Tullibardine, and by the party of the Earl of Breadalbane’s\r\nmen, under Campbell of Glenlyon and Campbell of Glendaruel. He was\r\nafterwards joined by the old earl himself, who, although he had, the\r\nday preceding his arrival, procured an affidavit from a physician in\r\nPerth, and the minister of the parish of Kenmore, of which he was\r\npatron, certifying his total inability, from age, and a complication\r\nof diseases, to comply with a mandate of the government requiring him\r\nto attend at Edinburgh; yet, nevertheless, found himself able enough\r\nto take the field in support of the Chevalier.[695] Having received\r\nintelligence that the Earl of Rothes, and some of the gentlemen of\r\nFife, were advancing with 500 of the militia of that county to seize\r\nPerth, he sent Colonel John Hay, brother to the Earl of Kinnoul,\r\nwith a detachment of 200 horse, to take possession of that town; he\r\naccordingly entered it on the 14th of September, without opposition,\r\nand there proclaimed the Chevalier. The provost made indeed a\r\ndemonstration of opposition by collecting between 300 and 400 men\r\nin the market place; but Colonel Hay having been joined by a party\r\nof 150 men which had been sent into the town a few days before by\r\nthe Duke of Athole, the provost dismissed his men. When the Earl of\r\nRothes, who was advancing upon Perth with a body of 500 men, heard\r\nof its capture, he retired to Leslie, and sent notice of the event\r\nto the Duke of Argyle. The possession of Perth was of importance to\r\nMar in a double point of view, as it not only gave him the command\r\nof the whole of Fife, in addition to the country north of the Tay,\r\nbut also inspired his friends with confidence.[696] Accordingly,\r\nthe Chevalier was proclaimed at Aberdeen by the Earl Marischal; at\r\nCastle Gordon, by the Marquis of Huntly; at Brechin, by the Earl of\r\nPanmure; at Montrose, by the Earl of Southesk; and at Dundee, by\r\nGraham of Claverhouse, who was afterwards created Viscount Dundee, by\r\nthe Chevalier.\r\n\r\nAs Mar had no intention of descending into the Lowlands himself\r\nwithout a considerable force, he remained several days at Moulinearn\r\nwaiting for the clans who had promised to join him, and in the\r\nmeantime directed Colonel Hay, whom, on the 18th of September, he\r\nappointed governor of Perth, to retain possession of that town at\r\nall hazards. He also directed him to tender to the inhabitants the\r\noath of allegiance to the Chevalier, and to expel from the town\r\nall persons who refused to take the oath. After this purgation had\r\nbeen effected, Governor Hay was ordered to appoint a free election\r\nof magistrates by poll, to open all letters passing through the\r\npost-office, and to appoint a new post-master in whom he could have\r\nconfidence. To support Hay in case of an attack, Mar sent down a\r\nparty of Robertsons, on the 22d, under the command of Alexander\r\nRobertson of Strowan, their chief, known as the elector of Strowan.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Mar’s forces did not probably exceed 3,000 men, but\r\ntheir number having been increased to upwards of 5,000 within a few\r\ndays thereafter, he marched down upon Perth, which he entered on\r\nthe 28th of September, on which day the Honourable James Murray,\r\nsecond son of the Viscount Stormont, arrived at Perth with letters\r\nfrom the Chevalier to the earl, giving him assurances of speedy and\r\npowerful succour, and promises from the Chevalier, as was reported,\r\nof appearing personally in Scotland in a short time. This gentleman\r\nhad gone over to France in the month of April preceding, to meet the\r\nChevalier, who had appointed him principal secretary for Scotland,\r\nand had lately landed at Dover, whence he had travelled _incognito_\r\noverland to Edinburgh, where, although well known, he escaped\r\ndetection. After spending a few days in Edinburgh, during which time\r\nhe attended, it is said, several private meetings of the friends of\r\nthe Chevalier, he crossed the Frith in an open boat at Newhaven, and\r\nlanded at Burntisland, whence he proceeded to Perth.[697]\r\n\r\nThe first operations of the insurgents were marked by vigour and\r\nintrepidity. The seizure of Perth, though by no means a brilliant\r\naffair, was almost as important as a victory would have been at\r\nsuch a crisis, and another dashing exploit which a party of the\r\nearl’s army performed a few days after his arrival at Perth, was\r\ncalculated to make an impression equally favourable to the Jacobite\r\ncause. Before the Earl of Sutherland took his departure from Leith\r\nfor Dunrobin castle, to raise a force in the north, he arranged with\r\nthe government for a supply of arms, ammunition and military stores,\r\nwhich was to be furnished by the governor of Edinburgh castle, and\r\nsent down to the north with as little delay as possible. Accordingly,\r\nabout the end of September, a vessel belonging to Burntisland\r\nwas freighted for that purpose, on board of which were put about\r\n400 stands of arms, and a considerable quantity of ammunition\r\nand military stores. The vessel anchored in Leith roads, but was\r\nprevented from passing down the Frith by a strong north-easterly\r\nwind, which, continuing to blow very hard, induced the captain\r\nfor security’s sake to weigh anchor and stand over to Burntisland\r\nroads, on the opposite coast of Fife, under the protection of the\r\nweather shore. The captain went on shore at Burntisland, to visit\r\nhis wife and family who resided in the town, and the destination of\r\nthe vessel, and the nature of her cargo being made known to some\r\npersons in the Jacobite interest, information thereof was immediately\r\ncommunicated by them to the Earl of Mar, who at once resolved to\r\nsend a detachment to Burntisland to seize the vessel. Accordingly,\r\nhe despatched on the evening of the 2d of October, a party of 400\r\nhorse, and 500 foot, from Perth to Burntisland, with instructions\r\nso to order their march as not to enter the latter place till about\r\nmidnight. To draw off the attention of the Duke of Argyle from\r\nthis expedition, Mar made a movement as if he intended to march\r\nwith all his forces upon Alva, in the neighbourhood of Stirling,\r\nin consequence of which Argyle, who had received intelligence of\r\nMar’s supposed design, kept his men under arms the whole day in\r\nexpectation of an attack. Meanwhile, the party having reached their\r\ndestination, the foot entered Burntisland unperceived, and while\r\nthe horse surrounded the town to prevent any person from carrying\r\nthe intelligence of their arrival out of it, the foot seized all\r\nthe boats in the harbour and along the shore, to cut off all\r\ncommunication by sea. About 120 men were, thereupon, sent off in\r\nsome boats to board the ship, which they secured without opposition.\r\nThey at first attempted to bring the vessel into the harbour, but\r\nwere prevented by the state of the tide. They, however, lost no time\r\nin discharging her cargo, and having pressed a number of carts and\r\nhorses from the neighbourhood into their service, the detachment\r\nset off undisturbed for Perth with their booty, where they arrived\r\nwithout molestation. Besides the arms and other warlike materials\r\nwhich they found in the vessel, the detachment carried off 100 stands\r\nof arms from the town, and between 30 and 40 more which they found in\r\nanother ship. Emboldened by the success of this enterprise, parties\r\nof the insurgents spread themselves over Fife, took possession of\r\nall the towns on the north of the Frith of Forth, from Burntisland\r\nto Fifeness, and prohibited all communication between them and the\r\nopposite coast. The Earl of Rothes, who was quartered at Leslie, was\r\nnow obliged, for fear of being cut off, to retire to Stirling under\r\nthe protection of a detachment of horse and foot, which had been\r\nsent from Stirling to support him, under the command of the Earl of\r\nForfar, and Colonel Ker.[698]\r\n\r\nMar had not yet been joined by any of the northern clans, nor by\r\nthose under General Gordon; but on the 5th of October, about 500\r\nof the Mackintoshes arrived under the command of the Laird of\r\nBorlum, better known by the name of Brigadier Mackintosh, an old and\r\nexperienced soldier, who, as uncle of the chief, had placed himself\r\nat the head of that clan in consequence of his nephew’s minority.\r\nThis clan had formerly sided with the revolution party; but,\r\ninfluenced by Borlum, who was a zealous Jacobite, they were among the\r\nfirst to espouse the cause of the Chevalier, and had seized upon\r\nInverness before some of the other clans had taken the field. On\r\nthe following day the earl was also joined by the Marquis of Huntly\r\nat the head of 500 horse and 2,000 foot, chiefly Gordons; and on\r\nthe 10th by the Earl Marischal with 300 horse, among whom were many\r\ngentlemen, and 500 foot. These different accessions increased Mar’s\r\narmy to upwards of 8,000 men.\r\n\r\nMar ought now to have instantly opened the campaign by advancing upon\r\nStirling, and attacking the Duke of Argyle, whose forces did not, at\r\nthis time, amount to 2,000 men. In his rear he had nothing to dread,\r\nas the Earl of Seaforth, who was advancing to join him with a body\r\nof 3,000 foot and 600 horse, had left a division of 2,000 of his men\r\nbehind him to keep the Earl of Sutherland, and the other friends of\r\nthe government in the northern Highlands, in check. As the whole of\r\nthe towns on the eastern coast from Burntisland to Inverness were in\r\npossession of his detachments, and as there was not a single hostile\r\nparty along the whole of that extensive stretch, no obstacle could\r\nhave occurred, had he marched south, to prevent him from obtaining\r\na regular supply of provisions for his army and such warlike stores\r\nas might reach any of these ports from France. One French vessel\r\nhad already safely landed a supply of arms and ammunition in a\r\nnorthern port, and another during Mar’s stay at Perth boldly sailed\r\nup the Frith of Forth, in presence of some English ships of war, and\r\nentered the harbour of Burntisland with a fresh supply. But though\r\npersonally brave, Mar was deficient in military genius, and was\r\naltogether devoid of that promptitude of action by which Montrose\r\nand Dundee were distinguished. Instead, therefore, of attempting\r\nat once to strike a decisive blow at Argyle, the insurgent general\r\nlingered at Perth upwards of a month. This error, however, might have\r\nbeen repaired had he not committed a more fatal one by detaching a\r\nconsiderable part of his army, including the Macintoshes, who were\r\nthe best armed of his forces, at the solicitation of a few English\r\nJacobites, who, having taken up arms in the north of England, craved\r\nhis support.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of Mar’s departure for Scotland, the government\r\nhad obtained information of a dangerous conspiracy in England in\r\nfavour of the Chevalier, in consequence of which the titular Duke of\r\nPowis was committed to the Tower, and Lords Lansdowne and Dupplin\r\nwere arrested, as implicated in the conspiracy, and a warrant was\r\nissued for the apprehension of the Earl of Jersey. At the same time,\r\na message from the king was sent to the house of commons, informing\r\nthem that his majesty had given orders for the apprehension of Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham, Mr. Thomas Forster, junior, member for the county\r\nof Northumberland, and other members of the lower house, as being\r\nengaged in a design to support an invasion of the kingdom. Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham was accordingly apprehended, and committed to the\r\nTower, but Mr. Forster having been apprised of the arrival of a\r\nmessenger at Durham with the warrant for his apprehension, avoided\r\nhim, and joined the Earl of Derwentwater, a young Catholic nobleman,\r\nagainst whom a similar warrant had been issued. Tired of shifting\r\nfrom place to place, they convened a meeting of their friends in\r\nNorthumberland to consult as to the course they should pursue; it was\r\nresolved immediately to take up arms in support of the Chevalier. In\r\npursuance of a resolution entered into, about 60 horsemen, mostly\r\ngentlemen, and some attendants, met on Thursday the 6th of October,\r\nat a place called Greenrig, whence, after some consultation, they\r\nmarched to Plainfield, a place on the river Coquet, where they\r\nwere joined by a few adherents. From Plainfield they departed for\r\nRothbury, a small market town, where they took up their quarters for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nNext morning, their numbers still increasing, they advanced to\r\nWarkworth, where they were joined by Lord Widdrington, with 30\r\nhorse. Mr. Forster was now appointed to the command of this force,\r\nnot on account of his military abilities, for he had none, but\r\nbecause he was a Protestant, and therefore less objectionable to the\r\nhigh-church party than the Earl of Derwentwater, who, in the absence\r\nof a regularly bred commander, should, on account of his rank, have\r\nbeen named to the chief command. On Sunday morning, Mr. Forster\r\nsent Mr. Buxton, a clergyman of Derbyshire, who acted as chaplain\r\nto the insurgent party, to the parson of Warkworth, with orders\r\nto pray for the Chevalier by name as king, and to introduce into\r\nthe Litany the name of Mary, the queen-mother, and all the dutiful\r\nbranches of the royal family, and omit the names of King George, and\r\nthe prince and princess. The minister of the parish wisely declined\r\nto obey these orders, and for his own safety retired to Newcastle.\r\nThe parishioners, however, were not deprived of divine service, as\r\nMr. Buxton, on the refusal of the parson to officiate as directed,\r\nentered the church, and performed in his stead with considerable\r\neffect.[699]\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 10th of October, Mr. Forster was joined by 40 horse\r\nfrom the Scottish border, on which day he openly proclaimed the\r\nChevalier. This small party remained at Warkworth till the 14th, when\r\nthey proceeded to Alnwick, where they were joined by many of their\r\nfriends, and thence marched to Morpeth. At Felton bridge they were\r\nreinforced by another party of Scottish horse to the number of 70,\r\nchiefly gentlemen from the border, so that on entering Morpeth their\r\nforce amounted to 300 horse. In the course of his march Forster had\r\nnumerous offers of service from the country people, which, however,\r\nhe was obliged to decline from the want of arms; but he promised to\r\navail himself of them as soon as he had provided himself with arms\r\nand ammunition, which he expected to find in Newcastle, whither he\r\nintended to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these movements, Launcelot Errington, a Newcastle\r\nshipmaster, undertook to surprise Holy Island, which was guarded by\r\na few soldiers, exchanged weekly from the garrison of Berwick. In a\r\nmilitary point of view, the possession of such an insignificant post\r\nwas of little importance, but it was considered by the Jacobites as\r\nuseful for making signals to such French vessels as might appear off\r\nthe Northumberland coast with supplies for the insurgents. Errington,\r\nit appears, was known to the garrison, as he had been in the habit\r\nof visiting the island on business; and having arrived off the\r\nisland on the 10th of October, he was allowed to enter the port, no\r\nsuspicions being entertained of his design. Pursuant to the plan he\r\nhad formed for surprising the castle, he invited the greater part\r\nof the garrison to visit his vessel, and having got them on board,\r\nhe and the party which accompanied him left the vessel, and took\r\npossession of the castle without opposition. Errington endeavoured to\r\napprise his friends at Warkworth of his success by signals, but these\r\nwere not observed, and the place was retaken the following day by a\r\ndetachment of 30 men from the garrison of Berwick, and a party of 50\r\nof the inhabitants of the town, who, crossing the sands at low water,\r\nentered the island, and carried the fort sword in hand. Errington,\r\nin attempting to escape, received a shot in the thigh, and being\r\ncaptured, was carried prisoner to Berwick; whence he had the good\r\nfortune to make his escape in disguise.[700]\r\n\r\nThe possession of Newcastle, where the Jacobite interest was very\r\npowerful, was the first object of the Northumberland insurgents;\r\nbut they were frustrated in their design by the vigilance of the\r\nmagistrates. Having first secured all suspected persons, the\r\nmagistrates walled up all the gates with stone and lime, except\r\nthe Brampton gate, on which they placed two pieces of cannon. An\r\nassociation of the well-affected inhabitants was formed for the\r\ndefence of the town, and the churchmen and dissenters, laying aside\r\ntheir antipathies for a time, enrolled themselves as volunteers. 700\r\nof these were immediately armed by the magistrates. The keelmen also,\r\nwho were chiefly dissenters, offered to furnish a similar number\r\nof men to defend that town; but their services were not required,\r\nas two successive reinforcements of regular troops from Yorkshire\r\narrived on the 9th and 12th of October. When the insurgents received\r\nintelligence of the state of affairs at Newcastle, they retired to\r\nHexham, having a few days before sent an express to the Earl of Mar\r\nfor a reinforcement of foot.\r\n\r\nThe news of the rising under Mr. Forster having been communicated to\r\nthe Marquis of Tweeddale, Lord Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire, his\r\nlordship called a meeting of his deputy lieutenants at Haddington\r\nearly in October, and at the same time issued instructions to them\r\nto put the laws in execution against “papists” and other suspected\r\npersons, by binding them over to keep the peace, and by seizing\r\ntheir arms and horses in terms of a late act of parliament. In\r\npursuance of this order, Mr. Hepburn of Humbie, and Dr. Sinclair\r\nof Hermandston, two of the deputy lieutenants, resolved to go the\r\nmorning after the instructions were issued, to the house of Mr.\r\nHepburn of Keith, a zealous Jacobite, against whom they appear to\r\nhave entertained hostile feelings. Dr. Sinclair accordingly appeared\r\nnext morning with a party of armed men at the place where Hepburn\r\nof Humbie had agreed to meet him; but as the latter did not appear\r\nat the appointed hour, the doctor proceeded towards Keith with his\r\nattendants. On their way to Keith, Hepburn enjoined his party, in\r\ncase of resistance, not to fire till they should be first fired at\r\nby Mr. Hepburn of Keith or his party; and on arriving near the house\r\nhe reiterated these instructions. When the arrival of Sinclair and\r\nhis party was announced to Mr. Hepburn of Keith, the latter at once\r\nsuspecting the cause, immediately demanded inspection of the doctor’s\r\norders. Sinclair, thereupon, sent forward a servant with the Marquis\r\nof Tweeddale’s commission, who, finding the gates shut, offered to\r\nshow the commission to Hepburn at the dining-room window. On being\r\ninformed of the nature of the commission, Hepburn signified the\r\nutmost contempt at it, and furiously exclaiming “God damn the doctor\r\nand the marquis both,” disappeared. The servant thinking that Mr.\r\nHepburn had retired for a time to consult with his friends before\r\ninspecting the commission, remained before the inner gate waiting for\r\nhis return. But instead of coming back to receive the commission,\r\nHepburn and his friends immediately mounted their horses and sallied\r\nout, Hepburn discharging a pistol at the servant, which wounded\r\nhim in two places. Old Keith then rode up to the doctor, who was\r\nstanding near the outer gate, and after firing another pistol at him,\r\nattacked him sword in hand and wounded him in the head. Sinclair’s\r\nparty, in terms of their instructions, immediately returned the\r\nfire, and Mr. Hepburn’s younger son was unfortunately killed on the\r\nspot. Hepburn and his party, disconcerted by this event, instantly\r\ngalloped off towards the Borders and joined the Jacobite standard.\r\nThe death of young Hepburn, who was the first person that fell in\r\nthe insurrection of 1715, highly incensed the Jacobites, who longed\r\nfor an opportunity, which was soon afforded them, of punishing its\r\nauthor, Dr. Sinclair.[701]\r\n\r\nWhilst Mr. Forster was thus employed in Northumberland, the Earl\r\nof Kenmure, who had received a commission from the Earl of Mar to\r\nraise the Jacobites in the south of Scotland, was assembling his\r\nfriends on the Scottish border. Early in October he had held private\r\nmeetings with some of them, at which it had been resolved to make an\r\nattempt upon Dumfries, expecting to surprise it before the friends\r\nof the government there should be aware of their design; but the\r\nmagistrates got timely warning. Lord Kenmure first appeared in arms,\r\nat the head of 150 horse, on the 11th of October at Moffat, where he\r\nproclaimed the Chevalier, on the evening of which day he was joined\r\nby the Earl of Wintoun and 14 attendants. Next day he proceeded to\r\nLochmaben, where he also proclaimed “the Pretender.” Alarmed at his\r\napproach, the magistrates of Dumfries ordered the drums to beat to\r\narms, and for several days the town exhibited a scene of activity\r\nand military bustle perfectly ludicrous, when the trifling force\r\nwith which it was threatened is considered. Kenmure advanced within\r\ntwo miles of the town, but being informed of the preparations which\r\nhad been made to receive him, he returned to Lochmaben. He thereupon\r\nmarched to Ecclefechan, where he was joined by Sir Patrick Maxwell of\r\nSpringkell, with 14 horsemen, and thence to Langholm, and afterwards\r\nto Hawick, where he proclaimed the Chevalier. On the 17th of October,\r\nKenmure marched to Jedburgh, with the intention of proceeding to\r\nKelso, and there also proclaimed the prince; but learning that Kelso\r\nwas protected by a party under the command of Sir William Bennet of\r\nGrubbet, he crossed the Border with the design of forming a junction\r\nwith Forster.[702]\r\n\r\nWe must now direct attention to the measures taken by the Earl of Mar\r\nin compliance with the request of Mr. Forster and his friends to send\r\nthem a body of foot. As Mar had not resolution to attempt the passage\r\nof the Forth, which, with the forces under his command, he could\r\nhave easily effected, he had no other way of reinforcing the English\r\nJacobites, than by attempting to transport a part of his army across\r\nthe Frith. As there were several English men-of-war in the Frith,\r\nthe idea of sending a body of 2,000 men across such an extensive arm\r\nof the sea appeared chimerical; yet, nevertheless, Mar resolved upon\r\nthis bold and hazardous attempt.\r\n\r\nTo command this adventurous expedition, the Jacobite general\r\npitched upon Old Borlum, as Brigadier Mackintosh was familiarly\r\ncalled, who readily undertook, with the assistance of the Earl of\r\nPanmure, and other able officers, to perform a task which few men,\r\neven of experience, would have undertaken without a grudge. For\r\nthis hazardous service, a picked body of 2,500 men was selected,\r\nconsisting of the whole of the Mackintoshes, and the greater part of\r\nMar’s own regiment, and of the regiments of the Earl of Strathmore,\r\nLord Nairne, Lord Charles Murray, and Drummond of Logie-Drummond.\r\nTo escape the men-of-war, which were stationed between Leith and\r\nBurntisland, it was arranged that the expedition should embark at\r\nCrail, Pittenweem, and Elie, three small towns near the mouth of the\r\nFrith, whither the troops were to proceed with the utmost secrecy\r\nand expedition by the most unfrequented ways through the interior of\r\nFife. At the same time, to amuse the ships of war, it was concerted\r\nthat another small and select body should openly march across the\r\ncountry to Burntisland, seize upon the boats in the harbour, and make\r\npreparations as if they intended to cross the Frith. With remarkable\r\nforesight, Mar gave orders that the expedition should embark with\r\nthe flowing of the tide, that in case of detection, the ships of war\r\nshould be obstructed by it in their pursuit down the Frith.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 9th or 10th of October, both detachments left\r\nPerth escorted by a body of horse under the command of Sir John\r\nErskine of Alva, the Master of Sinclair, and Sir James Sharp,\r\ngrandson of Archbishop Sharp of St. Andrews; and whilst the main\r\nbody proceeded in a south-easterly direction, through the district\r\nof Fife bordering upon the Tay, so as to pass unobserved by the\r\nmen-of-war, the other division marched directly across the country\r\nto Burntisland, where they made a feint as if preparing to embark\r\nin presence of the ships of war which then lay at anchor in Leith\r\nRoads. When the commanders of these vessels observed the motions of\r\nthe insurgents, they manned their boats and despatched them across to\r\nattack them should they venture out to sea, and slipping their cables\r\nthey stood over with their vessels to the Fife shore to support\r\ntheir boats. As the boats and ships approached, the insurgents, who\r\nhad already partly embarked, returned on shore; and those on land\r\nproceeded to erect a battery, as if for the purpose of covering\r\nthe embarkation. An interchange of shots then took place without\r\ndamage on either side, till night put an end to hostilities. In the\r\nmeantime, Brigadier Mackintosh had arrived at the different stations\r\nfixed for his embarkation, at the distance of nearly 20 miles from\r\nthe ships of war, and was actively engaged in shipping his men in\r\nboats which had been previously secured for their reception by his\r\nfriends in these quarters. The first division crossed the same night,\r\nbeing Wednesday the 12th of October, and the second followed next\r\nmorning. When almost half across the channel, which, between the\r\nplace of embarkation and the opposite coast, is about 16 or 17 miles\r\nbroad, the fleet of boats was descried from the topmasts of the\r\nmen-of-war, and the commanders then perceived, for the first time,\r\nthe deception which had been so successfully practised upon them by\r\nthe detachment at Burntisland. Unfortunately, at the time they made\r\nthis discovery, both wind and tide were against them; but they sent\r\nout their boats fully manned, which succeeded in capturing only two\r\nboats with 40 men, who were carried into Leith, and committed to\r\njail. As soon as the tide changed, the men-of-war proceeded down\r\nthe Frith, in pursuit, but they came too late, and the whole of the\r\nboats, with the exception of eight, (which being far behind, took\r\nrefuge in the Isle of May, to avoid capture,) reached the opposite\r\ncoast in perfect safety, and disembarked their men at Gullane, North\r\nBerwick, Aberlady, and places adjacent. The number carried over\r\namounted to about 1,600. Those who were driven into the Isle of May,\r\namounting to 200, after remaining therein a day or two, regained the\r\nFife coast, and returned to the camp at Perth.[703]\r\n\r\nThe news of Mackintosh’s landing occasioned a dreadful consternation\r\nat Edinburgh, where the friends of the government, astonished at\r\nthe boldness of the enterprise, and the extraordinary success which\r\nhad attended it, at once conjectured that the brigadier would march\r\ndirectly upon the capital, where he had many friends, and from which\r\nhe was only 16 miles distant. As the city was at this time wholly\r\nunprovided with the means of defence, Campbell, the provost, a\r\nwarm partisan of the government, adopted the most active measures\r\nfor putting it in a defensive state. The well affected among the\r\ncitizens formed themselves into a body for its defence, under the\r\nname of the Associate Volunteers, and these, with the city guards and\r\ntrained bands, had different posts assigned them, which they guarded\r\nwith great care and vigilance. Even the ministers of the city, to\r\nshow an example to the lay citizens, joined the ranks of the armed\r\nvolunteers. The provost, at the same time, sent an express to the\r\nDuke of Argyle, requesting him to send, without delay, a detachment\r\nof regular troops to support the citizens.\r\n\r\nAfter the brigadier had mustered his men, he marched to Haddington,\r\nin which he took up his quarters for the night to refresh his\r\ntroops, and wait for the remainder of his detachment, which he\r\nexpected would follow. According to Mackintosh’s instructions, he\r\nshould have marched directly for England, to join the insurgents in\r\nNorthumberland, but having received intelligence of the consternation\r\nwhich prevailed at Edinburgh, and urged, it is believed, by pressing\r\nsolicitations from some of the Jacobite inhabitants to advance upon\r\nthe capital, as well as lured by the eclat which its capture would\r\nconfer upon his arms, and the obvious advantages which would thence\r\nensue, he marched rapidly towards Edinburgh the following morning.\r\nHe arrived in the evening of the same day, Friday 14th October, at\r\nJock’s Lodge, about a mile from the city, where, being informed of\r\nthe measures which had been taken to defend it, and that the Duke\r\nof Argyle was hourly expected from Stirling with a reinforcement,\r\nhe immediately halted, and called a council of war. After a short\r\nconsultation, they resolved, in the meantime, to take possession of\r\nLeith. Mackintosh, accordingly, turning off his men to the right,\r\nmarched into the town without opposition. He immediately released\r\nfrom jail the 40 men who had been taken prisoners by the boats\r\nof the men-of-war, and seized a considerable quantity of brandy\r\nand provisions, which he found in the custom-house. He then took\r\npossession of and quartered his men in the citadel which had been\r\nbuilt by Oliver Cromwell. This fort, which was of a square form,\r\nwith four demi-bastions, and surrounded by a large dry ditch, was\r\nnow in a very dismantled state, though all the outworks, with the\r\nexception of the gates, were entire. Within the walls were several\r\nhouses, built for the convenience of sea-bathing, and which served\r\nthe new occupants in lieu of barracks. To supply the want of gates,\r\nMackintosh formed barricades of beams, planks, and of carts filled\r\nwith earth, stone, and other materials, and seizing six or eight\r\npieces of cannon which he found in some vessels in the harbour, he\r\nplanted two of them at the north end of the drawbridge, and the\r\nremainder upon the ramparts of the citadel. Within a few hours,\r\ntherefore, after he had entered Leith, Mackintosh was fully prepared\r\nto withstand a siege, should the Duke of Argyle venture to attack him.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mackintosh was in full march upon the capital from the east,\r\nthe Duke of Argyle was advancing upon it with greater rapidity from\r\nthe west, at the head of 400 dragoons and 200 foot, mounted, for the\r\nsake of greater expedition, upon farm-horses. He entered the city\r\nby the west port about ten o’clock at night, and was joined by the\r\nhorse militia of Lothian and the Merse with a good many volunteers,\r\nboth horse and foot, who, with the Marquis of Tweeddale, Lord\r\nBelhaven, and others, had retired into Edinburgh on the approach\r\nof the insurgents. These, with the addition of the city guard and\r\nvolunteers, increased his force to nearly 1,200 men. With this body\r\nthe duke marched down towards Leith next morning, Saturday, 15th\r\nOctober; but before he reached the town many of the “brave gentlemen\r\nvolunteers,”[704] whose enthusiasm had cooled while contemplating the\r\nprobable consequences of encountering in deadly strife the determined\r\nband to which they were to be opposed, slunk out of the ranks and\r\nretired to their homes. On arriving near the citadel, Argyle posted\r\nthe dragoons and foot on opposite sides, and along with Generals\r\nEvans and Wightman, proceeded to reconnoitre the fort on the sea\r\nside. Thereafter he sent in a summons to the citadel requiring the\r\nrebels to surrender under the pain of high treason, and declaring\r\nthat if they obliged him to employ cannon to force them, and killed\r\nany of his men in resisting him, he would give them no quarter. To\r\nthis message the laird of Kynnachin, a gentleman of Athole, returned\r\nthis resolute answer, that as to surrendering they did not understand\r\nthe word, which could therefore only excite laughter--that if his\r\ngrace thought he was able to make an assault, he might try, but\r\nhe would find that they were fully prepared to meet it; and as to\r\nquarter they were resolved, in case of attack, neither to take nor to\r\ngive any.\r\n\r\nThis answer was followed by a discharge from the cannon on the\r\nramparts, which made Argyle soon perceive the mistake he had\r\ncommitted in advancing without cannon. Had his force been equal and\r\neven numerically superior to that of Mackintosh, he could not have\r\nventured without almost certain destruction, to have carried the\r\ncitadel sword in hand, as he found that before his men could reach\r\nthe foot of the wall or the barricaded positions, they would probably\r\nhave been exposed to five rounds from the besieged, which, at a\r\nmoderate computation, would have cut off one half of his men. His\r\ncavalry, besides, on account of the nature of the ground, could have\r\nbeen of little use in an assault; and as, under such circumstances,\r\nan attack was considered impracticable, the duke retired to Edinburgh\r\nin the evening to make the necessary preparations for a siege.\r\nWhile deliberating on the expediency of making an attack, some of\r\nthe volunteers were very zealous for it, but on being informed that\r\nit belonged to them as volunteers to lead the way, they heartily\r\napproved of the duke’s proposal to defer the attempt till a more\r\nseasonable opportunity.[705]\r\n\r\nHad the Earl of Mar been apprised in due time of Mackintosh’s advance\r\nupon Edinburgh, and of the Duke of Argyle’s departure from Stirling,\r\nhe would probably have marched towards the latter place, and might\r\nhave crossed the Forth above the bridge of Stirling, without any\r\nvery serious opposition from the small force stationed in the\r\nneighbourhood; but he received the intelligence of the brigadier’s\r\nmovement too late to make it available, had he been inclined;\r\nmoreover it appears that he had resolved not to cross the Forth till\r\njoined by General Gordon’s detachment.[706]\r\n\r\nOn returning to Edinburgh the Duke of Argyle gave orders for the\r\nremoval of some pieces of cannon from the castle to Leith, with\r\nthe intention of making an assault upon the citadel the following\r\nmorning with the whole of his force, including the dragoons, which\r\nhe had resolved to dismount for the occasion. But he was saved the\r\nnecessity of such a hazardous attempt, the insurgents evacuating\r\nthe place the same night. Old Borlum, seeing no chance of obtaining\r\npossession of Edinburgh, and considering that the occupation of the\r\ncitadel, even if tenable, was not of sufficient importance to employ\r\nsuch a large body of men in its defence, had resolved, shortly after\r\nthe departure of the duke, to abandon the place, and to retrace his\r\nsteps without delay, and with all the secrecy in his power. Two hours\r\nbefore his departure, he sent a boat across the Frith with despatches\r\nto the Earl of Mar, giving him a detail of his proceedings since his\r\nlanding, and informing him of his intention to retire. To deceive\r\nthe men-of-war which lay at anchor in the Roads, he caused a shot to\r\nbe fired after the boat, which had the desired effect of making the\r\nofficers in command of the ships think the boat had some friends of\r\nthe government on board, and thus allowing her to pursue her course\r\nwithout obstruction.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock at night, every thing being in readiness, Mackintosh,\r\nfavoured by the darkness of the night and low water, left the citadel\r\nsecretly, and pursuing his course along the beach, crossed, without\r\nobservation, the small rivulet which runs through the harbour at low\r\nwater, and which was then about knee deep, and passing the point of\r\nthe pier, pursued his route south-eastward along the sands of Leith.\r\nAt his departure, Mackintosh was obliged to leave about 40 men behind\r\nhim, who having made too free with the brandy which had been found in\r\nthe custom-house, were not in a condition to march. These, with some\r\nstragglers who lagged behind, were afterwards taken prisoners by a\r\ndetachment of Argyle’s forces, which also captured some baggage and\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders continued their march during the night, and arrived\r\nat two o’clock on the morning of Sunday, the 16th of October, at\r\nSeaton House, the seat of the Earl of Wintoun, who had already joined\r\nthe Viscount Kenmure. Here, during the day, they were joined by a\r\nsmall party of their friends, who had crossed the Frith some time\r\nafter the body which marched to Leith had landed, and who, from\r\nhaving disembarked farther to the eastward, had not been able to\r\nreach their companions before their departure for the capital. As\r\nsoon as the Duke of Argyle heard of Mackintosh’s retreat, and that\r\nhe had taken up a position in Seaton House, which was encompassed by\r\na very strong and high stone wall, he resolved to follow and besiege\r\nhim in his new quarters. But the duke was prevented from carrying\r\nthis design into execution by receiving intelligence that Mar was\r\nadvancing upon Stirling with the intention of crossing the Forth.\r\n\r\nBeing apprised by the receipt of Mackintosh’s despatch from Leith,\r\nof the Brigadier’s design to march to the south, Mar had resolved,\r\nwith the view principally of facilitating his retreat from Leith,\r\nto make a movement upon Stirling, and thereby induce the Duke of\r\nArgyle to return to the camp in the Park with the troops which he had\r\ncarried to Edinburgh. Mar, accordingly, left Perth on Monday the\r\n17th of October, and General Witham, the commander of the royalist\r\nforces at Stirling in Argyle’s absence, having on the previous day\r\nreceived notice of Mar’s intention, immediately sent an express to\r\nthe duke, begging him to return to Stirling immediately, and bring\r\nback the forces he had taken with him to Edinburgh. The express\r\nreached Edinburgh at an early hour on Monday morning, and the duke\r\nimmediately left Edinburgh for Stirling, leaving behind him only 100\r\ndragoons and 150 foot under General Wightman. On arriving at Stirling\r\nthat night he was informed that Mar was to be at Dunblane next\r\nmorning with his whole army, amounting to nearly 10,000 men.[707]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of his Grace was most opportune, for Mar had in fact\r\nadvanced the same evening, with all his horse, to Dunblane, little\r\nmore than six miles from Stirling, and his foot were only a short way\r\noff from the latter place. Whether Mar would have really attempted\r\nthe passage of the Forth but for the intelligence he received next\r\nmorning, is very problematical; but having been informed early on\r\nTuesday of the duke’s return, and of the arrival of Evans’s regiment\r\nof dragoons from Ireland, he resolved to return to Perth. In a letter\r\nwhich he wrote to Mr. Forster from Perth on the 21st of October,\r\nafter alluding to the information he had received, he gives as an\r\nadditional reason for this determination, that he had left Perth\r\nbefore provisions could be got ready for his army, and that he found\r\nall the country about Stirling, where he meant to pass the Forth, so\r\nentirely exhausted by the enemy that he could find nothing to subsist\r\nupon. Besides, from a letter he had received from General Gordon, he\r\nfound the latter could not possibly join him that week, and he could\r\nnot think of passing the Forth, under the circumstances detailed,\r\ntill joined by him. Under these difficulties, and having accomplished\r\none of the objects of his march, by withdrawing the Duke of Argyle\r\nfrom the pursuit of his friends in Lothian, he had thought fit, he\r\nobserves, to march back from Dunblane to Auchterarder, and thence\r\nback to Perth, there to wait for Gordon and the Earl of Seaforth.\r\n\r\nMackintosh, in expectation probably of an answer to his despatch\r\nfrom Leith, appeared to be in no hurry to leave Seaton House, where\r\nhis men fared sumptuously upon the best which the neighbourhood could\r\nafford. As all communication was cut off between him and the capital\r\nby the 100 dragoons which Argyle had left behind, and a party of 300\r\ngentlemen-volunteers under the command of the Earl of Rothes, who\r\npatrolled in the neighbourhood of Seaton House, Mackintosh was in\r\ncomplete ignorance of Argyle’s departure from the capital, and of\r\nMar’s march. This was fortunate, as it seems probable that had the\r\nBrigadier been aware of these circumstances, he would have again\r\nadvanced upon the capital, and might have captured it. During the\r\nthree days that Mackintosh lay in Seaton House, no attempt was, of\r\ncourse, made to dislodge him from his position, but he was subjected\r\nto some petty annoyances by the volunteers and dragoons, between whom\r\nand the Highlanders some occasional shots were interchanged without\r\ndamage on either side. Having deviated from the line of instructions,\r\nMackintosh appears to have been anxious, before proceeding south, to\r\nreceive from Mar such new or additional directions as a change of\r\ncircumstances might require. Mar lost no time in replying to Borlum’s\r\ncommunication, and on Tuesday the 18th of October, Borlum received a\r\ndespatch desiring him to march immediately towards England, and form\r\na junction near the borders with the English Jacobite forces under\r\nMr. Forster, and those of the south of Scotland under Lord Kenmure.\r\nOn the same day, Mackintosh received a despatch from Mr. Forster,\r\nrequesting him to meet him without delay at Kelso or Coldstream.[708]\r\n\r\nTo give effect to these instructions, Mackintosh left Seaton House\r\nnext morning, and proceeded across the country towards Longformacus,\r\nwhich he reached that night. Doctor Sinclair, the proprietor of\r\nHermandston House, had incurred the Brigadier’s displeasure by his\r\ntreatment of the laird of Keith, to revenge which he threatened\r\nto burn Sinclair’s mansion in passing it on his way south, but he\r\nwas persuaded not to carry his threat into execution. He, however,\r\nordered his soldiers to plunder the house, a mandate which they\r\nobeyed with the utmost alacrity. When Major-general Wightman heard of\r\nMackintosh’s departure, he marched from Edinburgh with some dragoons,\r\nmilitia and volunteers, and took possession of Seaton House. After\r\ndemolishing the wall which surrounded it, he returned to Edinburgh in\r\nthe evening, carrying along with him some Highlanders who had lagged\r\nbehind or deserted from Mackintosh on his march.[709]\r\n\r\nMackintosh took up his quarters at Longformacus during the night, and\r\ncontinued his march next morning to Dunse, where he arrived during\r\nthe day and proclaimed the Chevalier. Here Mackintosh halted two\r\ndays, and on the morning of Saturday the 22d of October, set out on\r\nhis march to Kelso, the appointed place of rendezvous, whither the\r\nNorthumbrian forces under Forster were marching the same day. Sir\r\nWilliam Bennet of Grubbet and his friends hearing of the approach\r\nof these two bodies, left the town the preceding night, and, after\r\ndismissing their followers, retired to Edinburgh. The united forces\r\nof Forster and Kenmure entered Kelso about one o’clock on Saturday.\r\nThe Highlanders had not then arrived, but hearing that they were not\r\nfar off, the Scottish cavalry, to mark their respect for the bravery\r\nthe Highlanders had shown in crossing the Frith, marched out as far\r\nas Ednam bridge to meet them, and accompanied them into the town\r\nabout three o’clock in the afternoon, amidst the martial sounds of\r\nbagpipes. The forces under Mackintosh now amounted to 1,400 foot and\r\n600 horse; but a third of the latter consisted of menial servants.\r\n\r\nThe following day, being Sunday, was entirely devoted by the\r\nJacobites to religious duties. Patten, the historian of the\r\ninsurrection, an episcopal minister and one of their chaplains, in\r\nterms of instructions from Lord Kenmure, who had the command of the\r\ntroops while in Scotland, preached in the morning in the great church\r\nof Kelso, formerly the abbey of David I., to a mixed congregation\r\nof Catholics, Presbyterians and Episcopalians, from Deuteronomy\r\nxxi. 17. “The right of the first-born is his.”[710] The prayers on\r\nthis occasion were read by Mr. Buxton, formerly alluded to. In the\r\nafternoon Mr. William Irvine, an old Scottish Episcopalian minister,\r\nchaplain to the Earl of Carnwath, read prayers, and delivered a\r\nsermon full of exhortations to his hearers to be zealous and steady\r\nin the cause of the Chevalier. This discourse, he afterwards told\r\nhis colleague, Mr. Patten, he had formerly preached in the Highlands\r\nabout twenty-six years before, in presence of Lord Viscount Dundee\r\nand his army.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Highlanders were drawn up in the church-yard,\r\nand thence marched to the market-cross with colours flying, drums\r\nbeating, and bagpipes playing, when the Chevalier was proclaimed\r\nby Seaton of Barnes, who claimed the vacant title of Earl of\r\nDunfermline. After finishing the proclamation, he read the manifesto\r\nquoted in the conclusion of last chapter, at the end of which the\r\npeople with loud acclamations shouted, “No union! no malt-tax! no\r\nsalt-tax!”[711]\r\n\r\nThe insurgents remained three days in Kelso, chiefly occupied in\r\nsearching for arms and plundering the houses of some of the loyalists\r\nin the neighbourhood. They took possession of some pieces of cannon\r\nwhich had been brought by Sir William Bennet from Hume castle for the\r\ndefence of the town, and which had formerly been employed to protect\r\nthat ancient stronghold against the attacks of the English. They also\r\nseized some broadswords which they found in the church, and a small\r\nquantity of gunpowder. Whilst at Kelso, Mackintosh seized the public\r\nrevenue, as was his uniform custom in every town through which he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay at Kelso, the insurgents seem to have come to no\r\ndetermination as to future operations; but the arrival of General\r\nCarpenter with three regiments of dragoons, and a regiment of foot,\r\nat Wooler, forced them to resolve upon something decisive. Lord\r\nKenmure, thereupon, called a council of war to deliberate upon the\r\ncourse to be pursued. According to the opinions of the principal\r\nofficers, there were three ways of proceeding. The first, which\r\nwas strongly urged by the Earl of Wintoun, was to march into the\r\nwest of Scotland, to reduce Dumfries and Glasgow, and thereafter to\r\nform a junction with the western clans, under General Gordon, to\r\nopen a communication with the Earl of Mar, and threaten the Duke of\r\nArgyle’s rear. The second was to give battle immediately to General\r\nCarpenter, who had scarcely 1,000 men under him, the greater part\r\nof whom consisted of newly-raised levies, who had never seen any\r\nservice. This plan was supported by Mackintosh, who was so intent\r\nupon it, that, sticking his pike in the ground, he declared that he\r\nwould not stir, but would wait for General Carpenter, and fight him,\r\nas he was sure there would be no difficulty in beating him. The last\r\nplan, which was that of the Northumberland gentlemen, was to march\r\ndirectly through Cumberland and Westmoreland into Lancashire, where\r\nthe Jacobite interest was very powerful, and where they expected to\r\nbe joined by great numbers of the people. Old Borlum was strongly\r\nopposed to this view, and pointed out the risk which they would run,\r\nif met by an opposing force, which they might calculate upon, while\r\nGeneral Carpenter was left in their rear. He contended, that if they\r\nsucceeded in defeating Carpenter, they would soon be able to fight\r\nany other troops,--that if Carpenter should beat them, they had\r\nalready advanced far enough, and that they would be better able, in\r\nthe event of a reverse, to shift for themselves in Scotland than in\r\nEngland.[712]\r\n\r\nEither of the two first-mentioned plans was far preferable to\r\nthe last, even had the troops been disposed to adopt it; but the\r\naversion of the Highlanders to a campaign in England was almost\r\ninsuperable; and nothing could mark more strongly the fatuity of the\r\nNorthumberland Jacobites, than to insist, under these circumstances,\r\nupon marching into England. But they pertinaciously adhered to their\r\nopinion, and, by doing so, may be truly said to have ruined the cause\r\nwhich they had combined to support. As the comparatively small body\r\nof troops under Argyle was the only force in Scotland from which\r\nthe insurgents had any thing to dread, their whole attention should\r\nhave been directed in the first place to that body, which could not\r\nhave withstood the combined attacks of the forces which the rebels\r\nhad in the field, amounting to about 16,000 men. The Duke of Argyle\r\nmust have been compelled, had the three divisions of the insurgent\r\narmy made a simultaneous movement upon Stirling, to have hazarded\r\na battle, and the result would very probably have been disastrous\r\nto his arms. Had such an event occurred, the insurgents would have\r\nimmediately become masters of the whole of Scotland, and would soon\r\nhave been in a condition to have carried the war into England with\r\nevery hope of success.\r\n\r\nAmidst the confusion and perplexity occasioned by these differences\r\nof opinion, a sort of medium course was in the mean time resolved\r\nupon, till the chiefs of the army should reconcile their divisions.\r\nThe plan agreed upon was, that they should, to avoid an immediate\r\nencounter with General Carpenter, decamp from Kelso, and proceed\r\nalong the border in a south-westerly direction towards Jedburgh:\r\naccordingly, on Thursday the 27th of October, the insurgents\r\nproceeded on their march. The disagreement which had taken place had\r\ncooled their military fervour, and a feeling of dread, at the idea of\r\nbeing attacked by Carpenter’s force, soon began to display itself.\r\nTwice, on the march to Jedburgh, were they thrown into a state of\r\nalarm, approaching to terror,[713] by mistaking a party of their own\r\nmen for the troops of General Carpenter.\r\n\r\nInstead of advancing upon Jedburgh, as they supposed Carpenter would\r\nhave done, the insurgents ascertained that he had taken a different\r\ndirection in entering Scotland, and that from their relative\r\npositions, they were considerably in advance of him in the proposed\r\nroute into England. The English officers thereupon again urged their\r\nviews in council, and insisted upon them with such earnestness, that\r\nOld Borlum was induced, though with great reluctance, and not till\r\nafter very high words had been exchanged, to yield. Preparatory\r\nto crossing the Borders, they despatched one Captain Hunter (who,\r\nfrom following the profession of a horse-stealer on the Borders, was\r\nwell acquainted with the neighbouring country,) across the hills,\r\nto provide quarters for the army in North Tynedale; but he had not\r\nproceeded far, when an order was sent after him countermanding his\r\nmarch, in consequence of a mutiny among the Highlanders, who refused\r\nto march into England. The English horse, after expostulating with\r\nthem, threatened to surround and compel them to march; but Mackintosh\r\ninformed them that he would not allow his men to be so treated,\r\nand the Highlanders themselves despising the threat, gave them to\r\nunderstand that they would resist the attempt.[714]\r\n\r\nThe determination, on the part of the Highlanders, not to march into\r\nEngland, staggered the English gentlemen; but as they saw no hopes\r\nof inducing their northern allies to enter into their views, they\r\nconsented to waive their resolution in the meantime, and by mutual\r\nconsent the army left Jedburgh on the 29th of October for Hawick,\r\nabout ten miles to the south-west. While on the march to Hawick, a\r\nfresh mutiny broke out among the Highlanders, who, suspecting that\r\nthe march to England was still resolved upon, separated themselves\r\nfrom the rest of the army, and going up to the top of a rising ground\r\non Hawick moor, grounded their arms, declaring, at the same time,\r\nthat although they were determined not to march into England, they\r\nwere ready to fight the enemy on Scottish ground. Should the chiefs\r\nof the army decline to lead them against Carpenter’s forces, they\r\nproposed, agreeably to the Earl of Wintoun’s advice, either to march\r\nthrough the west of Scotland and join the clans under General Gordon,\r\nby crossing the Forth above Stirling, or to co-operate with the Earl\r\nof Mar, by falling upon the Duke of Argyle’s rear, while Mar himself\r\nshould assail him in front. But the English officers would listen to\r\nnone of these propositions, and again threatened to surround them\r\nwith the horse and force them to march. The Highlanders, exasperated\r\nat this menace, cocked their pistols, and told their imprudent\r\ncolleagues that if they were to be made a sacrifice, they would\r\nprefer being destroyed in their own country. By the interposition of\r\nthe Earl of Wintoun a reconciliation was effected, and the insurgents\r\nresumed their march to Hawick, on the understanding that the\r\nHighlanders should not be again required to march into England.[715]\r\n\r\nThe insurgents passed the night at Hawick, during which the courage\r\nof the Highlanders was put to the test, by the appearance of a party\r\nof horse, which was observed by their advanced posts patrolling in\r\nfront. On the alarm being given, the Highlanders immediately flew to\r\narms, and forming themselves in very good order by moonlight, waited\r\nwith firmness the expected attack; but the affair turned out a false\r\nalarm, purposely got up, it is believed, by the English commanders,\r\nto try how the Highlanders would conduct themselves, should an enemy\r\nappear.[716] Next morning, being Sunday, the 30th of October, the\r\nrebels marched from Hawick to Langholm, about which time General\r\nCarpenter entered Jedburgh. They arrived at Langholm in the evening,\r\nand with the view, it is supposed, of attacking Dumfries, they sent\r\nforward to Ecclefechan, during the night, a detachment of 400 horse,\r\nunder the Earl of Carnwath, for the purpose of blocking up Dumfries\r\ntill the foot should come up. This detachment arrived at Ecclefechan\r\nbefore day-light, and, after a short halt, proceeded in the direction\r\nof Dumfries; but they had not advanced far, when they were met by\r\nan express from some of their friends at Dumfries, informing them\r\nthat great preparations had been made for the defence of the town.\r\nThe Earl of Carnwath immediately forwarded the express to Langholm,\r\nand, in the meantime, halted his men on Blacket ridge, a moor in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ecclefechan, till further orders. The express was\r\nmet by the main body of the army about two miles west from Langholm,\r\non its march to Dumfries.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence thus conveyed, immediately created another schism\r\nin the army. The English, who had been prevailed upon, from the\r\nadvantages held out to the Jacobite cause by the capture of such an\r\nimportant post as Dumfries, to accede to the proposal for attacking\r\nit, now resumed their original intention of marching into England.\r\nThe Highlanders, on the other hand, insisted upon marching instantly\r\nupon Dumfries, which they alleged might be easily taken, as there\r\nwere no regular forces in it. It was in vain that the advocates\r\nof this plan urged upon the English the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom the possession of a place so convenient as Dumfries was, for\r\nreceiving succours from France and Ireland, and for keeping up a\r\ncommunication with England and their friends in the west of Scotland.\r\nIt was to no purpose they were assured, that there were a great\r\nmany arms and a good supply of powder in the town, which they might\r\nsecure, and that the Duke of Argyle, whom they appeared to dread,\r\nwas in no condition to injure them, as he had scarcely 2,000 men\r\nunder him, and was in daily expectation of being attacked by the\r\nEarl of Mar, whose forces were then thrice as numerous;--these and\r\nsimilar arguments were entirely thrown away upon men who had already\r\ndetermined at all hazards to adhere to their resolution of carrying\r\nthe war into England. To induce the Scottish commanders to concur\r\nin their views, they pretended that they had received letters from\r\ntheir friends in Lancashire inviting them thither, and assuring them\r\nthat on their arrival a general insurrection would take place, and\r\nthat they would be immediately joined by 20,000 men, and would have\r\nmoney and provisions in abundance. The advantages of a speedy march\r\ninto England being urged with extreme earnestness by the English\r\nofficers, all their Scottish associates, with the exception of the\r\nEarl of Wintoun, at last consented to try the chances of war on the\r\nsoil of England. Even Old Borlum, (who, at the time the parties were\r\ndiscussing the point in dispute, was busily engaged at a distance\r\nfrom the place where the main body had halted, restraining a party\r\nof the Highlanders from deserting,) yielded to the entreaties of the\r\nEnglish officers, and exerted all his influence to induce his men\r\nto follow his example. By the aid of great promises and money, the\r\ngreater part of the Highlanders was prevailed upon to follow the\r\nfortunes of their commander, but about 500 of them marched off in\r\na body to the north. Before they reached Clydesdale, however, they\r\nwere almost all made prisoners by the country people, and lodged\r\nin jail. The Earl of Wintoun, who was quite opposed to the measure\r\nresolved upon, also went off with his adherents, but being overtaken\r\nby a messenger who was despatched after him to remonstrate with him\r\nfor abandoning his friends, he consented to return, and immediately\r\nrejoined the army. When overtaken, he drew up his horse, and, after\r\na momentary pause, as if reflecting on the judgment which posterity\r\nwould form of his conduct, observed with chivalrous feeling, that\r\nhistory should not have to relate of him that he deserted King\r\nJames’s interest or his country’s good, but with a deep presentiment\r\nof the danger of the course his associates were about to pursue,\r\nhe added, “You,” addressing the messenger, “or any man shall have\r\nliberty to cut these (laying hold of his own ears as he spoke) out of\r\nmy head, if we do not all repent it.”\r\n\r\nThe insurgents, after spiking two pieces of cannon which they had\r\nbrought from Kelso, immediately proceeded on their march for England,\r\nand entered Longtown in Cumberland the same night, where they were\r\njoined by the detachment which had been sent to Ecclefechan the\r\nprevious night. On the following day, November 1st, they marched to\r\nBrampton, a small market town in Cumberland, where they proclaimed\r\nthe Chevalier, and levied the excise duties on malt and ale. Mr.\r\nForster now opened a commission which he had lately received from\r\nthe Earl of Mar, appointing him general of the Jacobite forces in\r\nEngland. As the men were greatly fatigued by forced marches, having\r\nmarched about 100 miles in five successive days, they took up their\r\nquarters at Brampton for the night to refresh themselves. When\r\nGeneral Carpenter heard that the insurgents had entered England,\r\nhe left Jedburgh, and recrossing the hills into Northumberland,\r\nthrew himself between them and Newcastle, the seizure of which, he\r\nerroneously supposed, was the object of their movement.\r\n\r\nNext day the insurgents marched towards Penrith, on approaching\r\nwhich they received intelligence that the _posse comitatus_ of\r\nCumberland, amounting to nearly 14,000 men, headed by the sheriff\r\nof the county, and attended by Lord Lonsdale and the Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, had assembled near Penrith on the line of their march to\r\noppose their advance. Mr., now General Forster, sent forward a party\r\nto reconnoitre, but he experienced no trouble from this immense\r\nrustic force, which broke up and dispersed in the utmost confusion\r\non hearing of the approach of the reconnoitring party. Patten,\r\nthe historian of the rebellion, who had formerly been curate of\r\nPenrith, attempted, at the head of a party of horse, to intercept\r\nhis superior, the Bishop of Carlisle, but his lordship escaped. The\r\ninsurgents captured some horses and a large quantity of arms, and\r\nalso took several prisoners, who being soon released, expressed their\r\ngratitude by shouting, “God save King James and prosper his merciful\r\narmy.”[717] To impress the inhabitants of Penrith with a favourable\r\nidea of their strength and discipline, the insurgents halted upon\r\na moor in the neighbourhood, where they formed themselves in order\r\nof battle, and thereafter entered the town in regular marching\r\norder. The principal inhabitants, from an apprehension of being\r\nplundered, showed great attention to them, in return for which, and\r\nthe comfortable entertainment which they received, they abstained\r\nfrom doing any act which could give offence. They however raised,\r\naccording to custom, the excise and other public duties.\r\n\r\nNext day the insurgents marched to Appleby, where, as at Penrith,\r\nthey proclaimed the Chevalier and seized the public revenue. After\r\nhalting two days at this town, they resumed their march on the 5th of\r\nNovember, and arrived at Kendal, where they took up their quarters\r\nfor the night. Next morning, being Sunday, they, after a short march,\r\nreached Kirkby-Lonsdale, where, after proclaiming the Chevalier, they\r\nwent to the church in the afternoon, where, in absence of the parson,\r\nwho had absconded, Mr. Patten read prayers. This author relates a\r\nsingular instance of Jacobite zeal on the part of a gentleman of the\r\nname of Guin, or Gwyn, who entered the churches which lay in the\r\nroute of the army, and scratching out the name of King George from\r\nthe prayer books, substituted that of the Chevalier in its stead, in\r\na manner so closely resembling the print that the alteration could\r\nscarcely be perceived.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents had now marched through two populous counties, but\r\nthey had obtained the accession of only two gentlemen to their ranks.\r\nThey would probably have received some additions in Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland, had not precautions been taken by the sheriffs of\r\nthese counties beforehand to secure the principal Catholics and\r\nlodge them in the castle of Carlisle. Despairing of obtaining any\r\nconsiderable accession of force, 17 gentlemen of Teviotdale had left\r\nthe army at Appleby, and the Highlanders, who had borne the fatigues\r\nof the march with great fortitude, now began to manifest signs of\r\nimpatience at the disappointment they felt in not being joined by\r\nlarge bodies of men as they were led to expect. Their prospects,\r\nhowever, began to brighten by the arrival of some Lancashire Catholic\r\ngentlemen and their servants at Kirkby-Lonsdale, and by the receipt\r\nof intelligence the following day, when on their march to Lancaster,\r\nthat the Jacobites of Lancashire were ready to join them, and that\r\nthe Chevalier had been proclaimed at Manchester.[718]\r\n\r\nThe insurgents entered Lancaster without opposition, and instantly\r\nmarching to the market-place, proclaimed the Chevalier by sound\r\nof trumpet, the whole body being drawn up round the cross. After\r\nremaining two days at Lancaster, where the Highlanders regaled\r\nthemselves with claret and brandy found in the custom-house, they\r\ntook the road to Preston on Wednesday the 9th of November, with the\r\nintention of possessing themselves of Warrington bridge and securing\r\nManchester, as preliminary to a descent upon Liverpool. The horse\r\nreached Preston at night, two troops of Stanhope’s dragoons and part\r\nof a militia regiment under Sir Henry Houghton, which were quartered\r\nin the town, retiring to Wigan on their approach; but owing to\r\nthe badness of the road from a heavy rain which had fallen during\r\nthe day, the foot did not arrive till the following day, when the\r\nChevalier was proclaimed at the cross with the usual formalities. On\r\nthe march from Lancaster to Preston, and after their arrival there,\r\nthe insurgents were joined by different parties of gentlemen, chiefly\r\nCatholics, with their tenants and servants, to the number of about\r\n1,500 in all, by which additions Forster’s army was increased to\r\nnearly 4,000 men.\r\n\r\nForster, who had kept a strict watch upon Carpenter, and of whose\r\nmovements he received regular accounts daily, was, however, utterly\r\nignorant of the proceedings of a more formidable antagonist, who, he\r\nwas made to understand by his Lancashire friends, was at too great\r\na distance to prove dangerous. This was General Wills, who had the\r\ncommand in Cheshire, and who was now busily employed in concentrating\r\nhis forces for the purpose of attacking the rebels. Unfortunately for\r\nthem, the government had been induced, by the tumults and violences\r\nof the high-church party in the west of England during the preceding\r\nyear, to quarter bodies of troops in the disaffected districts,\r\nwhich being disposed at Shrewsbury, Chester, Birmingham, Stafford,\r\nWolverhampton, Manchester, and other adjacent places, could be\r\neasily assembled together on a short notice. On information being\r\ncommunicated to the government of the invasion of England, General\r\nWills had been directed to collect all the forces he could, and to\r\nmarch upon Warrington bridge and Preston, to prevent the advance of\r\nthe insurgents upon Manchester.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wills had, accordingly, made great exertions to fulfil,\r\nwithout delay, the instructions he had received, and hearing that\r\nGeneral Carpenter was at Durham, had sent an express to him to march\r\nwestward; but he was unable to save Preston. When the insurgents\r\nentered this town, Wills was at Manchester, waiting for the arrival\r\nof two regiments of foot and a regiment of dragoons, which were\r\nwithin a few days’ march of him; but alarmed lest by delaying his\r\nmarch the rebels might make themselves masters of Warrington bridge\r\nand Manchester, by the possession of which they would increase their\r\nforce and secure many other advantages, he resolved instantly to\r\nmarch upon Preston with such troops as he had. He left Manchester,\r\naccordingly, on Friday the 11th of November, for Wigan, with four\r\nregiments of dragoons, one of horse, and Preston’s regiment of foot,\r\nformerly known as the Cameronian regiment. He arrived at Wigan in the\r\nevening, where he met Stanhope’s dragoons and Houghton’s militia,\r\nwho had retired from Preston on the evening of the 9th. In the\r\nmeantime, the inhabitants of Liverpool anticipating a visit from the\r\ninsurgents, were actively employed in preparations for its defence.\r\nWithin three days they threw up a breastwork round that part of the\r\ntown approachable from the land side, on which they mounted 70 pieces\r\nof cannon, and, to prevent the ships in the harbour from falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy, they anchored them in the offing.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of Forster to have left Preston on the morning\r\nof Saturday the 12th; but the unexpected arrival of Wills at Wigan,\r\nof which he received intelligence on the preceding night, made him\r\nalter his design. Forster had been so elated by the addition which\r\nhis forces had received at Preston, that he affected to believe that\r\nWills would never venture to face him; but old Mackintosh advised\r\nhim not to be too confident, as they might soon find it necessary\r\nto defend themselves. Observing from a window where they stood,\r\na party of the new recruits passing by, the veteran warrior thus\r\ncontemptuously addressed the inexperienced general, “Look ye there,\r\nForster, are yon fellows the men ye intend to fight Wills with.\r\nGood faith, Sir, an’ ye had ten thousand of them, I’d fight them\r\nall with a thousand of his dragoons.” In fact, a more uncouth and\r\nunsoldier-like body had never before appeared in the field, than\r\nthese Lancashire rustics; some with rusty swords without muskets,\r\nothers with muskets without swords, some with fowling-pieces, others\r\nwith pitchforks, while others were wholly unprovided with weapons\r\nof any sort.[719] Forster now altered his tone; and if the report\r\nof a writer, who says he was an eye-witness, be true, the news of\r\nWills’s advance quite unnerved him. Undetermined how to act, he sent\r\nthe letter conveying the intelligence to Lord Kenmure, and retired\r\nto rest. His lordship, with a few of his officers, repaired to\r\nForster’s lodgings to consult him, and, to their surprise, found him\r\nin bed, though the night was not far advanced. The council, after\r\nsome deliberation, resolved to send out a party of horse towards\r\nWigan, to watch the motions of the enemy, to secure the pass into the\r\ntown by Ribble bridge, and to prepare the army for battle.[720]\r\n\r\nAbout day-break of the 12th, General Wills commenced his march\r\nfrom Wigan, and as soon as it was known that he was advancing upon\r\nPreston, a select body of 100 well-armed Highlanders, under the\r\ncommand of Farquharson of Invercauld, was posted at Ribble bridge,\r\nand Forster himself at the head of a party of horse, crossed the\r\nbridge, and advanced to reconnoitre.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Ribble bridge, which is about half a mile from\r\nPreston, is by a deep path between two high banks, and so narrow\r\nin some places that scarcely two men can ride abreast. Here it was\r\nthat Cromwell, in an action with the royalists, was nearly killed by\r\na large fragment of a rock thrown from above, and only escaped by\r\nforcing his horse into a quicksand. The possession, therefore, of\r\nthis pass, was of the utmost importance to the insurgents, as Wills\r\nwas not in a condition to have forced it, being wholly unprovided\r\nwith cannon. Nor could he have been more successful in any attempt to\r\npass the river, which was fordable only at a considerable distance\r\nabove and below the bridge, and might have been rendered impassable\r\nin different ways. But the Jacobite general was grossly ignorant\r\nof every thing appertaining to the art of war, and in an evil hour\r\nordered the party at the bridge to abandon it, and retire into the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wills arrived opposite Ribble bridge about one o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, and was surprised to find it undefended. Suspecting\r\nan ambuscade, he advanced through the way leading to the bridge\r\nwith great caution, and having cleared the bridge, marched towards\r\nthe town. He, at first, supposed that the insurgents had abandoned\r\nthe town with the intention of returning to Scotland; but he soon\r\nascertained that they still maintained their ground, and were\r\nresolved to meet him. Halting, therefore, his men upon a small\r\nrising ground near the town, he rode forward with a strong party of\r\nhorse to take a survey of the position of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning they had been busily employed in raising\r\nbarricades in the principal streets, and making other preparations\r\nfor a vigorous defence. The Earl of Derwentwater displayed\r\nextraordinary activity and zeal on this occasion. He distributed\r\nmoney among the troops, exhorted them to stand firm to their posts,\r\nand set them an example by throwing off his coat, and assisting them\r\nin raising intrenchments. There were four main barriers erected\r\nacross the leading streets near the centre of the town, at each of\r\nwhich, with one exception, were planted two pieces of cannon, which\r\nhad been carried by the insurgents from Lancaster, and beyond these\r\nbarriers, towards the extremities of the town, others were raised of\r\nan inferior description. Behind the barricades bodies of men were\r\nposted, as well as in the houses outside the barricades, particularly\r\nin those which commanded the entrances into the principal streets.\r\nCertainly after the abandonment of Ribble bridge, a more judicious\r\nplan of defence could not have been devised by the ablest tactician\r\nfor meeting the coming exigency; but unfortunately for the\r\ninsurgents, the future conduct of their leaders did not correspond\r\nwith these skilful dispositions.\r\n\r\nOne of the main barriers was a little below the church, and was\r\ncommanded by Brigadier Mackintosh, the task of supporting whom was\r\ndevolved upon the gentlemen volunteers, who were drawn up in the\r\nchurchyard under the command of Viscount Kenmure and the Earls of\r\nDerwentwater, Nithsdale, and Wintoun. A body of Highlanders, under\r\nLord Charles Murray, third son of the Duke of Athole, was posted at\r\nanother barrier at the end of a lane leading to the fields. Colonel\r\nMackintosh, at the head of the Mackintoshes, was posted at a third\r\nbarricade called the Windmill barrier, from its adjoining such a\r\nstructure on the road to Lancaster. At the remaining barrier, which\r\nwas in the street leading to the Liverpool road, were placed some\r\nof the gentlemen volunteers, and a part of the Earl of Strathmore’s\r\nregiment under the command of Major Miller and Mr. Douglas.\r\n\r\nWhen the government general had made himself acquainted with the\r\nplan of defence adopted by the insurgents, he returned to his main\r\nbody, and made preparations for an immediate attack. As he had\r\nnot sufficient forces to make a simultaneous assault upon all the\r\nbarriers, he resolved to confine himself at first to two only, those\r\ncommanded by Old Borlum and Colonel Mackintosh, in the streets\r\nleading to Wigan and Lancaster respectively, at both ends of the\r\ntown. For this purpose he divided his troops into three bodies;--the\r\nfirst consisted of Preston’s regiment of foot, and 250 dismounted\r\ndragoons taken in equal proportions from the five dragoon regiments.\r\nThis division was commanded by Brigadier Honeywood, and was supported\r\nby his own regiment of dragoons. The second body consisted of the\r\nregiments of Wynn and Dormer, and a squadron of Stanhope’s regiment,\r\nall of which were dismounted;--the last division, consisting of\r\nPitt’s horse and the remainder of Stanhope’s regiment, was kept as\r\na reserve for supporting the other divisions as occasion should\r\nrequire, and to prevent the insurgents from escaping over the Ribble.\r\n\r\nThe action was begun by the division of Honeywood, which, after\r\ndriving a party of the insurgents from a small barricade at the\r\nextremity of one of the leading streets, entered the town, and\r\nattacked the barrier near the church, defended by Brigadier\r\nMackintosh; but Honeywood’s men were unable to make any impression,\r\nand after sustaining a galling and destructive fire from the barrier\r\nand from the houses on both sides of the street, they were forced\r\nto retreat from the street with considerable loss. Some of the\r\nofficers of Preston’s regiment being informed whilst engaged in the\r\nstreet, that the street leading to Wigan was not barricaded, and\r\nthat the houses on that side were not possessed by the insurgents,\r\nLord Forrester, the lieutenant-colonel, resolved, after Honeywood’s\r\ndivision had failed to establish itself in the neighbourhood of the\r\nchurch, to attempt an entrance in that direction. He accordingly\r\ndrew off his men by a narrow back passage or lane which led into the\r\nstreet in the direction of Wigan, and ordering them to halt till\r\nhe should personally survey the position of the insurgents, this\r\nintrepid officer deliberately rode into the street with his drawn\r\nsword in his hand, and amidst a shower of bullets, coolly examined\r\nthe barrier, and returned to his troops. He then sallied into the\r\nstreet at the head of his men, and whilst with one party he attacked\r\nthe barrier, another under his direction crossed the street, and took\r\npossession of a very high house belonging to Sir Henry Houghton,\r\nwhich overlooked the whole town. In this enterprise many of the\r\nassailants fell by the fire of the insurgents who were posted in\r\nthe adjoining houses. At the same time, Forrester’s men possessed\r\nthemselves of another house opposite, which was unoccupied by the\r\ninsurgents. The possession of these houses was of immense advantage\r\nto the government troops, as it was from the firing kept up from them\r\nthat the insurgents chiefly suffered. A party of 50 Highlanders,\r\nunder Captain Innes, had been posted in Houghton’s house, and another\r\nbody in the opposite one; but Brigadier Mackintosh had unfortunately\r\nwithdrawn both parties, contrary to their own wishes, to less\r\nimportant stations.\r\n\r\nForrester’s men maintained the struggle with great bravery, but\r\nwere unsuccessful in every attempt to force the barrier. As the\r\ninsurgents, from their position in the houses and behind the\r\nbarricade, were enabled to take deliberate aim, many of their shots\r\ntook deadly effect, and the gallant Lord Forrester received several\r\nwounds; but although Preston’s foot kept up a smart fire, they did\r\nlittle execution among the insurgents, who were protected by the\r\nbarricade and the houses. Captain Peter Farquharson was the only\r\nJacobite officer who fell in this attack. He received a shot in the\r\nleg, and being taken to the White Bull inn, where the wounded were\r\ncarried, he called for a glass of brandy, and thus addressed his\r\ncomrades:--“Come lads, here is our master’s health; though I can do\r\nno more, I wish you good success.” Amputation being deemed necessary,\r\nthis brave man expired, almost immediately, from the unskilfulness of\r\nthe operator.\r\n\r\nWhilst this struggle was going on near the church, a contest equally\r\nwarm was raging in another quarter of the town between Dormer’s\r\ndivision and the party under Lord Charles Murray. In approaching the\r\nbarrier commanded by this young nobleman, Dormer’s men were exposed\r\nto a well-directed and murderous fire from the houses, yet, though\r\nnewly-raised troops, they stood firm, and reached the barricade,\r\nfrom which, however, they were vigorously repulsed. Lord Charles\r\nMurray conducted himself with great bravery in repelling this attack,\r\nand anticipating a second attempt upon the barrier, he obtained\r\na reinforcement of 50 gentlemen volunteers from the churchyard.\r\nDormer’s troops returned to the assault, but although they displayed\r\ngreat courage and resolution, they were again beaten back with loss.\r\nAn attack made on the Windmill barricade, which was defended by\r\nColonel Mackintosh, was equally unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThus repulsed in all their attacks, and as in their approaches to\r\nthe barriers the government troops had been incessantly exposed to a\r\nregular and well-directed fire from the houses, General Wills issued\r\norders to set the houses at both ends of the town on fire, for the\r\npurpose of dislodging the insurgents from such annoying positions,\r\nand cooping them up in the centre of the town. Many houses and barns\r\nwere in consequence consumed, including almost the entire range of\r\nhouses as far as Lord Charles Murray’s barrier. As the assailants\r\nadvanced under cover of the smoke of the conflagration, many of\r\nthe insurgents, in attempting to escape from the flames, were cut\r\ndown on the spot. The rebels in their turn attempted to dislodge\r\nthe government troops from the houses of which they had obtained\r\npossession, by setting them on fire. Fortunately there was no wind at\r\nthe time, otherwise the whole town would have been reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nNight came on, yet an irregular platooning was, notwithstanding,\r\nkept up till next day by both parties. To distinguish the houses\r\npossessed by the government forces, General Wills ordered them to\r\nbe illuminated, a circumstance which gave the besieged a decided\r\nadvantage, as the light from the windows enabled them to direct\r\ntheir fire with better effect. Wills soon perceived the error he\r\nhad committed, and sent persons round to order the lights to be\r\nextinguished, which order being promulgated aloud in the streets, was\r\nso strangely misunderstood by those within, that, to the amusement\r\nof both parties, they set up additional lights. During the night a\r\nconsiderable number of the insurgents left the town.\r\n\r\nBefore day-break, General Wills visited the different posts, and\r\ngave directions for opening a communication between both divisions\r\nof the army to support each other, should necessity require. During\r\nthe morning, which was that of Sunday the 13th of November, he was\r\noccupied in making arrangements for renewing the attack. Meantime\r\nGeneral Carpenter arrived about ten o’clock with Churchill’s and\r\nMolesworth’s dragoons, accompanied by the Earl of Carlisle, Lord\r\nLumley, and others. This event was as exhilarating to the royalists\r\nas it was disheartening to the besieged, who, notwithstanding the\r\ndefection of their more timorous associates during the preceding\r\nnight, were, before the accession of Carpenter, fully a match for\r\ntheir assailants. Wills, after explaining to Carpenter the state of\r\nmatters, and the dispositions he had made, offered to resign the\r\ncommand to him, as his superior officer; but being satisfied with\r\nWills’s conduct, Carpenter declined to accept it, remarking, that\r\nas he had begun the affair so well, he ought to have the glory of\r\nfinishing it. On examining matters himself, however, Carpenter found\r\nthat the town was not sufficiently invested, particularly at the end\r\nof Fishergate street, which led to a meadow by which the insurgents\r\ncould easily have escaped. He therefore posted Pitt’s horse along\r\nthe meadow, and lest the whole body of the besieged should attempt\r\nto force a retreat that way, he caused a communication to be opened\r\nthrough the enclosures on that side, that the other divisions of the\r\narmy might the more readily hasten thither to intercept them.\r\n\r\nThus invested on all sides, and pent up within a narrow compass by\r\nthe gradual encroachments of the royalists, the Jacobite general\r\ngrew alarmed, and began to think of a surrender. The Highlanders\r\nwere fully aware of their critical situation, but the idea of\r\nsurrendering had never once entered their minds, and they had been\r\nrestrained only by the most urgent entreaties from sallying out\r\nupon the royalists, and cutting their way through their ranks, or\r\ndying, as they remarked, like men of honour, with their swords in\r\ntheir hands. Neither Forster nor any other officer durst therefore,\r\nventure to make such a proposal to them, and Patten asserts, that\r\nhad they known that Colonel Oxburgh had been sent on the mission he\r\nundertook, he would have never seen Tyburn, but would have been shot\r\nby common consent before he had passed the barrier. This gentleman,\r\nwho had great influence over Forster (and who, in the opinion of the\r\nlast-named author, was better calculated, from the strictness with\r\nwhich he performed his religious duties, to be a priest than a field\r\nofficer), in conjunction with Lord Widdrington and others, prevailed\r\nupon him to make an offer of capitulation, thinking that they would\r\nobtain favourable terms from the government general. This resolution\r\nwas adopted without the knowledge of the rest of the officers, and\r\nOxburgh, who had volunteered to negotiate, went off about two o’clock\r\nin the afternoon to Wills’s head-quarters. To prevent suspicion of\r\nhis real errand, the soldiers were informed that General Wills had\r\nsent to offer them honourable terms, if they would lay down their\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe reception of Oxburgh by General Wills was very different from\r\nwhat he and his friends had anticipated. Wills, in fact, absolutely\r\nrefused to hear of any terms, and upon Oxburgh making an offer\r\nthat the insurgents should lay down their arms, provided he would\r\nrecommend them to the mercy of the king, he informed him that he\r\nwould not treat with rebels, who had killed several of his Majesty’s\r\nsubjects, and who consequently must expect to undergo the same fate.\r\nThe colonel, thereupon, with great earnestness, begged the general,\r\nas an officer and a man of honour, to show mercy to people who\r\nwere willing to submit. The royalist commander, somewhat softened,\r\nreplied, that all he would promise was, that if the insurgents\r\nwould lay down their arms and surrender themselves prisoners at\r\ndiscretion, he would prevent the soldiers from cutting them to\r\npieces till further orders; and that he would allow them an hour\r\nfor the consideration of his offer. The result of this interview\r\nwas immediately reported by Oxburgh to his friends, but nothing had\r\ntranspired to throw any light upon their deliberations. Before the\r\nhour had elapsed, Mr. Dalzell, brother of the Earl of Carnwath,\r\nappeared at Wills’s head quarters, and requested to know what terms\r\nhe would grant separately to the Scots; Wills answered that he would\r\nnot treat with rebels, nor grant any other terms than those already\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nTo bring matters to an immediate issue, General Wills sent Colonel\r\nCotton into the town about three o’clock in the afternoon, to require\r\nan immediate answer to Wills’s proposal. He was told, however, that\r\ndifferences existed between the English and Scottish officers upon\r\nthe subject, but they requested that the general would allow them\r\ntill seven o’clock next morning to settle their differences, and\r\nto consult upon the best method of delivering themselves up. This\r\nproposal being reported to Wills, he agreed to grant the Jacobite\r\ncommanders the time required, provided they would bind themselves to\r\nthrow up no new entrenchments in the streets, nor allow any of their\r\nmen to escape; for the performance of which stipulations he required\r\nthe delivery of approved hostages.--Cotton having returned to the\r\ntown, the Earl of Derwentwater and Brigadier Mackintosh were pitched\r\nupon as hostages for the observance of these stipulations, and sent\r\nto the royalist head-quarters.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Highlanders perceived that a capitulation was\r\nresolved upon, their fury knew no bounds. They declared that sooner\r\nthan surrender, they would die fighting, and that when they could\r\nno longer defend their posts, they would attempt to cut their way\r\nthrough their assailants, and make a retreat. During the night\r\nthey paraded the streets, threatening destruction to every person\r\nwho should even allude to a surrender. During these disturbances,\r\nseveral persons were killed, and many wounded, and Mr. Forster, who\r\nwas openly denounced as the originator of the capitulation, would\r\ncertainly have been cut to pieces by the infuriated soldiers, had\r\nhe appeared in the streets. He made a narrow escape even in his own\r\nchamber, a gentleman of the name of Murray having fired a pistol at\r\nhim, the ball from which would have taken effect had not Mr. Patten,\r\nthe Jacobite chaplain, struck up the pistol with his hand, and thus\r\ndiverted the course of the bullet.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock next morning, Forster notified to General Wills that\r\nthe insurgents were willing to surrender at discretion as he had\r\nrequired. Old Borlum being present when this message was delivered,\r\nobserved that he would not be answerable for the Scots surrendering\r\nwithout terms, as they were people of desperate fortunes; and that\r\nhe who had been a soldier himself, knew what it was to be a prisoner\r\nat discretion. “Go back to your people again,” answered Wills, “and\r\nI will attack the town, and the consequence will be I will not spare\r\none man of you.” After this challenge, Mackintosh could not with a\r\ngood grace remain, and returned to his friends; but he came back\r\nimmediately, and informed Wills that Lord Kenmure and the rest of the\r\nScots noblemen would surrender on the same conditions as the English.\r\n\r\nColonel Cotton was thereupon despatched with a detachment of 200 men\r\nto take possession of the town, and the rest of the government forces\r\nthereafter entered it in two grand divisions, amid the sound of\r\ntrumpets and beating of drums, and met in the market-place, where the\r\nHighlanders were drawn up under arms ready to surrender. The number\r\nof prisoners taken on this occasion was 1,468, of whom about 463 were\r\nEnglish, including 75 noblemen and gentlemen; of the Scots 143 were\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen. The noblemen and gentlemen were placed under\r\nguards in the inns of the town, and the privates were confined in\r\nthe church. On the part of the insurgents there were only 17 killed\r\nand 25 wounded in the different attacks, but the loss on the part\r\nof the royalists was very considerable, amounting, it is believed,\r\nto five times the number of the former. From the small number of\r\nprisoners taken, it would appear that few of the country people who\r\nhad joined the insurgents when they entered Lancashire, had remained\r\nin Preston. They probably left the town during the nights of Saturday\r\nand Sunday.[721]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[686] _Annals of 2d year of George I._, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[687] Idem, pp. 36-7.\r\n\r\n[688] Patten, pp. 159, 160. _Annals of George I._, pp. 39, 40.

Finding it impossible to gain the confidence of the court of\r\nSt. Germains, Simon, on the breaking out of the rebellion, resolved\r\nto seek the favour of King George by using his power as head of\r\nhis clan on behalf of the royalists. The clan had sent over some\r\nof their number to France to bring Simon home, in order that he\r\nmight tell them what side he desired them to espouse; these had got\r\nthe length of Dumfries on the day in which that town was thrown\r\ninto a state of consternation by the Lord Justice-Clerk’s letter,\r\nannouncing its proposed capture by the rebels. Simon was received\r\nthere with much suspicion, and he and his followers placed under\r\nguard, notwithstanding the pass he had managed to obtain from Lord\r\nTownshend. This he obtained on volunteering to accompany the Earl of\r\nSutherland to the north, and induce the clan Fraser to abandon the\r\nJacobites and join the royalists. Although the estates and honours\r\nwere in possession of the daughter of the late Lord Lovat, and\r\nalthough her husband, Mackenzie of Fraserdale, had joined the rebels\r\nwith a number of the clan, still, according to Highland custom,\r\nSimon was the real head of the clan, and as such his influence was\r\nparamount.[722]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inverness at the end of the 17th century.--From\r\nSlezer’s _Theatrum Scotiæ_.]\r\n\r\nOn arriving in the north “he found three hundred men, who had refused\r\nto follow the Jacobite banner of his rival, ready at his call.\r\nPlacing himself at their head, like a sovereign with an army, he\r\nsent notice to the disaffected clansmen who had followed the legal\r\nowner of the estates, to return immediately to their duty to their\r\ntrue chief, threatening them with ejection from their holdings,\r\nand military execution against their families and possessions, if\r\nthey failed. As men exorcised by a command which it would be wicked\r\nand futile to resist, the Frasers left Mar’s camp, just before the\r\nmomentous battle of Sheriffmuir, and joined their brethren. Lovat\r\nfound Duncan Forbes, afterwards the great and good Lord-President,\r\ndefending the old fortalice of Culloden, while his father-in-law,\r\nHugh Rose, held his neighbouring tower of Kilravock against repeated\r\nattacks, and with a well-ordered force of 200 men, made his mansion\r\ndo the proper service of a fort in protecting the surrounding\r\ncountry. Their efforts were important from their position. Northward\r\nof Loch Ness, and the chain of minor lakes, the power of the Earl\r\nof Sutherland, on the government side, balanced that of Seaforth,\r\nGlengarry, and the other Jacobite leaders; and in their absence at\r\nMar’s camp, was superior. Thus the fortified houses near Inverness,\r\nhad all the importance of border fortresses; and the reduction of\r\nInverness, for the Hanover interest, would relieve their owners of\r\ntheir perilous position, by giving their friends the command of\r\nthe pass between the North Highlands and the rest of Scotland. The\r\nsmall body under Rose and Forbes, with Lovat’s, and a party of the\r\nGrants, amounted in all to about 1,300 men--a considerable force\r\nin that war of small armies. They laid plans for systematically\r\ninvesting Inverness; but before it was necessary to operate on them,\r\nthe garrison silently evacuated the place, dropping down the river\r\nin boats on the night of the 13th of November, and sailing for the\r\nnorthern coast of the Moray Frith. This affair seems to have cost no\r\nother casualty than the death of a brother of Rose of Kilravock, in\r\na premature and rash attack. Thus the government had the command of\r\nthe eastern pass between the North Highlands and the low country,\r\nleaving passable only such routes, beyond the western extremity of\r\nLoch Ness, as were not liable to be interrupted by the garrison at\r\nFortwilliam.”[723]\r\n\r\nWhen the Jacobite general took the field he was so unprovided with\r\nmoney, that after Colonel Hay entered Perth he could spare him only\r\nfifty guineas for the use of his detachment, and so exhausted had\r\nhis little treasury become shortly after he took up his quarters\r\nthere, that he was reduced to the necessity of laying the surrounding\r\ncountry, and the shires of Fife, Kinross, and Clackmannan under\r\ncontribution. By an order dated from the camp at Perth on the 4th\r\nOctober, he required every man of substance attending the standard\r\nof the Chevalier, to raise amongst his tenants and possessors, the\r\nsum of twenty shillings on every hundred pounds Scots of valued rent,\r\nand such landed proprietors as did not immediately or before the 12th\r\nof October, attend his standard, were mulcted in double that amount.\r\nThis order appears to have had little effect, as it was renewed on\r\nthe 21st of October, when it was rigorously enforced, and the penalty\r\nof military execution threatened against those who should refuse to\r\nimplement it.\r\n\r\nTo compel compliance, parties of horse and foot were despatched\r\nthrough the adjoining country. One of these, consisting of 200\r\nfoot and 100 horse, being sent towards the town of Dunfermline,\r\ninformation of their march was brought to the Duke of Argyle on\r\nSunday, the 23d of October. His grace immediately despatched\r\nColonel Cathcart with a detachment of dragoons to intercept them,\r\nwho, receiving intelligence that the insurgents had passed Castle\r\nCampbell, and had taken up their quarters for the night in a village\r\non the road to Dunfermline, continued his march during the whole\r\nnight, and coming upon the village unperceived at five o’clock in the\r\nmorning, surprised the party, some of whom were killed and others\r\ntaken while in bed. Among these were eleven gentlemen, including\r\nGordon of Craig, Gordon younger of Aberlour, and Mr. Murray brother\r\nto the laird of Abercairney.[724]\r\n\r\nAfter this affair, and for want of more stirring excitements, a\r\nsort of paper war was carried on between the two generals, which,\r\nif attended with little practical effect on either side, served\r\nat least to keep up in a more marked manner the distinction\r\nbetween the adherents of the government and the partizans of the\r\nJacobite interest. When informed of the Earl of Mar’s order for\r\nan assessment, the Duke of Argyle issued a counter one, on the\r\n25th of October, prohibiting and discharging all persons from\r\ngiving or furnishing the insurgents with money or provisions,\r\nunder the pains of high treason, and for greater publicity he\r\ndirected the same to be intimated at each parish church door after\r\ndivine service, and before the dismissal of the congregation. This\r\nmandate was followed two days thereafter by another from the duke,\r\nrequiring all well-affected noblemen, gentlemen, justices of the\r\npeace, magistrates, and ministers, “to persuade and encourage all\r\nable-bodied and well-affected men,” in their respective parishes,\r\nin town and country, to enlist in the regular army, and promising a\r\nbounty of forty shillings sterling, and a discharge from the service,\r\nif required, at the end of three months after the suppression of the\r\ninsurrection. This order was answered by a proclamation from the\r\nEarl of Mar, dated November 1st, prohibiting and discharging all\r\npersons whatever, under the highest penalties, from giving obedience\r\nto it; and whereas he had promised his protection, as he observes,\r\nto all ministers who behaved themselves dutifully, and did not\r\nacknowledge “the Elector of Brunswick as king, by praying for him as\r\nsuch in their churches and congregations;” yet as several of them\r\ncontinued the practice, and might thus “involve and mislead innocent\r\nand ignorant people into traitorous and seditious practices,” he\r\nexpressly prohibited “all ministers, as well in churches as in\r\nmeeting-houses, to acknowledge the Elector of Brunswick as king, and\r\nthat upon their highest peril.” And he ordered all officers, civil\r\nand military, to shut up the church doors of such ministers as should\r\nact in contempt of the order, to apprehend their persons and bring\r\nthem prisoners to his camp. Many ministers, to avoid compliance\r\nwith this order, absented themselves from their charges, but others\r\nwho ventured openly to brave it, were apprehended and treated with\r\nseverity. Mar, however, found a more pliant body in the non-jurant\r\nepiscopal clergy, some of whom attached themselves to his camp, and\r\nharangued his troops from time to time on the duties they owed to\r\ntheir lawful sovereign, “King James VIII.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the earl seems to have calculated greatly upon the\r\nassistance of France, yet his stay at Perth appears to have been\r\nprolonged rather by the tardiness of the Earl of Seaforth, in\r\nreaching the insurgent camp, than by any intention of waiting for\r\nsupplies from France, or the expected invasion of England by the Duke\r\nof Ormond; for no sooner did Seaforth arrive with the northern clans,\r\nabout the beginning of November, than Mar began to concert measures\r\nwith his officers for opening the campaign. The march of the Earl of\r\nSeaforth had been retarded by the Earl of Sutherland, at the head of\r\na considerable number of his own men, and of the Mackays, Rosses,\r\nMunroes, and others; but having compelled them to disperse, he\r\nproceeded on his march with about 3,000 foot and 800 horse, leaving\r\na sufficient force behind to protect his own country, and keep the\r\nroyalist clans in check.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Jacobite commander, from the procrastinating system he\r\nhad pursued, and from jealousies which had arisen in his camp among\r\nhis officers, had experienced considerable difficulty in keeping his\r\nforces together. Of all men, the Highlanders were the most unlikely\r\nto relish the inactive duties of a camp, and as the duration of their\r\nservices lay entirely with themselves, it was evident that the longer\r\nMar delayed bringing them into action, the risk of their abandoning\r\nhim was proportionably increased. It was not therefore without reason\r\nthat one of the leaders remarked that he was afraid the Highlanders\r\nwould desert their colours in three cases:-- 1. If they were long\r\nwithout being brought to action, they would tire and go home; 2. If\r\nthey fought and were victorious, they would plunder and go home; 3.\r\nIf they fought and were beaten, they would run away and go home.\r\n\r\nTo counteract the injurious effect which a state of inaction might\r\nproduce upon the minds of his men, Mar buoyed up their hopes by\r\nissuing from time to time, by means of a printing press brought from\r\nAberdeen, and superintended by Freebairn of Edinburgh, a variety of\r\nfabricated accounts, highly favourable to their cause, respecting\r\nthe progress of the rebellion in the south, and the great exertions\r\nmaking by the Chevalier’s friends in France, all which accounts were\r\nswallowed with the utmost credulity by his unsuspecting adherents.\r\n\r\nAbout the time the Earl of Seaforth arrived at Perth, General Gordon\r\nhad advanced as far as Castle Drummond with the western clans on his\r\nway to Perth; and as Mar had now resolved to attempt the passage of\r\nthe Forth, he despatched an express to Gordon, to join him on his\r\nmarch. At a council of war, which was held on the 9th of November,\r\nthe Jacobite chiefs came to the determination of leaving Perth the\r\nfollowing day for Dunblane. On obtaining possession of this town,\r\nMar’s design was to detach three different bodies, of 1,000 men each,\r\nto Stirling bridge, and the two adjacent fords above, for the purpose\r\nof amusing Argyle, while he himself with the main body of his army,\r\nconsisting of nearly 8,000 men, should attempt to cross the river at\r\na ford a little way above those selected for the intended _ruse_. In\r\nthe event of success, the three detached bodies were to be directed\r\nto form a junction and follow the main body without delay, but in\r\ncase the Duke of Argyle abandoned Stirling to oppose the passage of\r\nthe main body, they were to enter the town and fall upon his rear.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morning of Thursday, the 10th of November, Mar\r\ndeparted from Perth, leaving a garrison behind under Colonel Balfour,\r\nbesides a scattered force of about 3,000 men quartered in different\r\nparts of Fife. The earl not calculating upon a return to Perth, took\r\nall his baggage along with him, and provisions sufficient to support\r\nhis army for twelve days. The insurgents took up their quarters for\r\nthe night at Auchterarder, and on the following day were joined by\r\nthe western clans under General Gordon. The army rested the whole\r\nof the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, Mar ordered General Gordon\r\nto march forward with 3,000 men of the clans, and eight squadrons\r\nof horse under Brigadier Ogilvie and the Master of Sinclair, and\r\ntake possession of Dunblane. After ordering the rest of the army to\r\nparade on the moor of Tullibardine, he departed for Drummond castle\r\nto hold an interview with the Earl of Breadalbane, having previously\r\ndirected General Hamilton to follow Gordon with the main body.\r\n\r\nAs early as the morning of Thursday the 10th[725] of November, the\r\nDuke of Argyle had received intelligence from some of his spies at\r\nPerth, of Mar’s intended march, and of his plan for effecting the\r\npassage of the Forth. Fortunately for Argyle, his little army had\r\nbeen lately almost doubled by reinforcements from Ireland, and it now\r\namounted to 2,300 foot, and 1,200 cavalry, all in the best order and\r\ncondition; but though formidable from its composition when united, it\r\nwas too weak to divide into detachments for resisting at different\r\npoints the passage of an army thrice as numerous, in an attempt to\r\ncross the Forth. As Argyle, therefore, saw he could no longer retain\r\nhis position on the banks of the river, which, from its now beginning\r\nto freeze, would soon be rendered more passable than before, he\r\ndetermined to cross and offer the insurgents battle before they\r\nshould reach its northern bank. Though he exposed himself by this\r\nbold step to the disadvantage of fighting with a river in his rear,\r\nhe considered that the risk would be sufficiently counterbalanced by\r\nthe advantage which his cavalry would have by engaging the enemy on\r\nlevel ground.\r\n\r\nHaving called in several small detachments which were quartered at\r\nGlasgow, Kilsyth, and Falkirk, Argyle crossed Stirling bridge on the\r\nmorning of the 12th of November, for Dunblane, much about the same\r\ntime that Mar’s forces had begun to advance upon that town in an\r\nopposite direction from Auchterarder. In a short time after their\r\nsetting out, Argyle’s advanced guard took possession of Dunblane,\r\nof which circumstance General Gordon was apprised on his march.\r\nHaving halted his division, Gordon sent an express, announcing the\r\nintelligence to General Hamilton, who despatched it to the Earl of\r\nMar, and in a short time he forwarded a second express confirming\r\nthe previous news, and adding that the enemy were in great force.\r\nHamilton, upon receipt of this last despatch, halted his men on the\r\nground adjoining the Roman camp at Ardoch, about five miles from\r\nDunblane, till he should receive instructions from the earl. Mar\r\nsoon thereafter returned from Drummond castle, and being desirous\r\nof obtaining additional intelligence from the general in advance,\r\nordered Hamilton to remain in his position, and to hold his men in\r\nreadiness to march on a moment’s notice. This order had, however,\r\nbeen scarcely issued, when a fresh despatch arrived from General\r\nGordon, announcing that the Duke of Argyle was in Dunblane with his\r\nwhole army. Mar thereupon desired Gordon to remain where he was till\r\nthe main body of the army should come up, and having ordered three\r\nguns to be fired, the signal agreed upon to be given Hamilton for\r\nputting his men in marching order, the latter immediately formed\r\nhis division and put it in motion. After a junction between the two\r\ndivisions of the army had been formed, the insurgents marched to\r\nthe bridge of Kinbuck, about four miles from Dunblane, where they\r\npassed the frosty night under arms without covering or tent. The\r\nDuke of Argyle, who had the most exact intelligence brought to him\r\nof the motions of the insurgents, left Dunblane and formed his army\r\nin order of battle in the evening, on a rising ground above the\r\nhouse of Kippenross, about two miles north-east of the town. His\r\narmy was drawn up in one extended line. In the centre were eight\r\nbattalions of foot under the command of Major-General Wightman.\r\nThe right wing consisted of five squadrons of dragoons, under\r\nLieutenant-General Evans, and a similar number, at the head of whom\r\nwas Lieutenant-General Witham, composed the left wing. After thus\r\ndrawing up his men, his grace issued orders that no tent should be\r\npitched during the night either by officer or private soldier; that\r\nall the officers without distinction should remain at their posts;\r\nand that the troops should rest on their arms in the exact order in\r\nwhich they had been formed. The severest penalties were threatened\r\nagainst those who should infringe these orders. Though the night\r\nwas extremely cold, the troops lay down upon the bare ground, and\r\nsnatched a few hours’ repose. The duke himself retired to a sheep-cot\r\nat the foot of a hill on the right of the army, where he passed the\r\nnight sitting on a bundle of straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dunblane, about the time of the Rebellion.--From\r\nSlezer’s _Theatrum Scotiæ_.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the two armies had bivouacked during the night within three\r\nmiles of each other, and were only separated by the Sheriffmuir, an\r\nelevated and uneven waste, skirted on the west by the high road from\r\nStirling to Perth, near the river Allan, yet so ignorant was Mar of\r\nthe movements of Argyle, that so far from supposing him to be within\r\nsuch a short distance of his camp, he imagined that he still remained\r\nat Dunblane; and it was not until he observed a reconnoitring party\r\nof Argyle’s cavalry on the adjoining heights of the Sheriffmuir next\r\nmorning, that he became aware of his immediate proximity. This party\r\nwas headed by the duke himself, who had aroused his army by break of\r\nday, and who, after issuing instructions to his men to prepare for\r\nbattle, had ascended at an early hour the hill where his advanced\r\nguard was posted, to survey the position of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mar had also put his men under arms shortly after break\r\nof day, and when Argyle’s party of observation was first noticed, Mar\r\nwas busily engaged ranging his men in marching order, preparatory\r\nto advancing upon Dunblane. Conceiving that Argyle meant to offer\r\nhim battle immediately, he instantly assembled all the chiefs, and\r\nafter addressing them in an eloquent speech, in which he painted\r\nin glowing colours the wrongs of their prince and their country,\r\nand congratulated them that the day had at length arrived when they\r\ncould revenge their injuries in open battle, he desired to know if\r\nthey were willing to engage. The Marquis of Huntly alone raised some\r\nobjections, and some few were heard in an under-tone to advise a\r\nreturn to Perth till the spring; but the voices of Huntly and his\r\nsupporters were drowned by loud shouts of “fight, fight!” from the\r\nrest, who at once galloped off to their different posts.[726]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mar, thereupon, resumed the marshalling of his army,\r\nwhich formed into two lines with a rapidity and decision that would\r\nhave done honour to veteran troops; but by accident, three squadrons\r\nof horse posted on the left, misled by a cry from the Highlanders,\r\nof “horse to the right,” left their position and took ground on the\r\nright, an unfortunate mistake for the insurgents, as it contributed\r\nto the defeat of their left wing. The centre of the first line\r\nwas composed of ten battalions of foot, consisting of about 4,000\r\nmen under the command of the captain of Clanranald, Glengary, Sir\r\nJohn Maclean, the laird of Glenbucket, Brigadier Ogilvie, and the\r\ntwo brothers of Sir Donald Macdonald of Sleat. General Gordon, who\r\nhad long served in the army of the Czar of Muscovy, was at the head\r\nof these battalions. On the right of this line were placed two of\r\nthe Marquis of Huntly’s squadrons of horse, and another called the\r\nStirling squadron, which carried the Chevalier’s standard. This\r\nsquadron, which consisted wholly of gentlemen, also bore the title\r\nof “the Restoration regiment of horse.” The Perthshire squadron\r\nformed the left wing. The centre of the second line consisted of\r\neight battalions of foot, viz., three of the Earl of Seaforth’s foot,\r\ntwo of the Marquis of Huntly’s, the Earl of Panmure’s battalion,\r\nand those of the Marquis of Tullibardine, of Drummond, commanded by\r\nthe Viscount of Strathallan, and of Logie-Almond, and Robertson of\r\nStrowan. On the right of this second line were posted two squadrons\r\nof horse under the Earl Marischal. The Angus squadron was on the\r\nleft. The whole of the force thus formed for action may be estimated\r\nat 8,000, besides which there was a _corps de reserve_ of 400 horse\r\nposted considerably in the rear.\r\n\r\nWhile this formation was going on, the Duke of Argyle observed for\r\nseveral hours with great attention the various evolutions of the\r\ninsurgents; but from the nature of the ground[727] occupied by\r\nthem he could not obtain a full view of their line which extended\r\nthrough a hollow way, the view of which was obstructed by the brow\r\nof a hill occupied by a party of Mar’s troops. From Mar’s advanced\r\nguards looking towards Dunblane, the duke conjectured that the\r\ninsurgents intended to march in that direction; but he was undeceived\r\nin this idea by a movement on the part of a mass of the insurgents\r\ntowards his right, as if they intended to cross the moor and fall\r\nupon the flank of his army. As a large morass lay in the way of\r\nthe insurgents, Argyle, in advancing from Dunblane, had conceived\r\nhimself free from danger on that side; but it had now been rendered\r\nquite passable for foot as well as horse by a keen frost during the\r\npreceding night. As soon as Argyle saw this large body advance up\r\nthe face of the moor, which, from the right wing of the insurgents\r\nbeing concealed from his view by a rising ground, he supposed was the\r\nmain body of Mar’s army, he requested the advice of the officers who\r\nsurrounded him as to how he should act. It was the general opinion,\r\nan opinion in which the duke himself concurred, that there would\r\nbe less risk in engaging the insurgents on the high grounds than\r\nin waiting for them in the position occupied by the duke’s army;\r\nbut although most of the officers thought that there would not be\r\nsufficient time to bring forward the troops and to change the order\r\nof battle, a change which was absolutely necessary, the duke resolved\r\nto draw out his troops upon the moor.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this determination, the duke returned quickly to the\r\narmy, and ordered the drums to beat the _General_. This order was\r\ngiven about eleven o’clock; but although the drums instantly beat to\r\narms, an hour elapsed before the troops were ready to march. The new\r\norder of battle was as follows. The duke’s first line consisted of\r\nsix battalions of foot, all old troops, amounting scarcely to 1,800\r\nmen. On the right were posted three squadrons of dragoons, being the\r\nbest in the army, namely, Evans’s, the Scots Greys, and the Earl of\r\nStair’s. On the left there were placed three squadrons of dragoons,\r\nnamely, Carpenter’s, Ker’s, and a squadron of Stair’s. The second\r\nline was composed of only two battalions of foot, with a squadron of\r\ndragoons on each wing. The right wing of the army was commanded by\r\nthe duke himself, the centre by General Wightman, and the left by\r\nGeneral Witham. Behind Evans’s dragoons, on the right wing, a body\r\nof about sixty horse, noblemen and gentlemen volunteers, took up a\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe body which Argyle had observed coming up the face of the\r\nmoor, was a squadron of the Earl Marischal’s horse and Sir\r\nDonald Macdonald’s battalion, under their respective commanders.\r\nThese had been despatched by the Earl of Mar, to drive away the\r\nreconnoitring party under the Duke of Argyle from the height; but\r\non its disappearing, they returned and reported the circumstance to\r\nthe earl. On receiving this intelligence, Mar gave orders to his\r\ntroops to march up the hill in four columns. The whole army was\r\naccordingly put in motion, but they had not proceeded far when the\r\nEarl Marischal, who was in advance, observed Argyle forming his lines\r\non the southern summit of the hill, at a short distance from him. He\r\nnotified the circumstance to Mar, who instantly gave orders to his\r\nmen to quicken their pace up the hill. In the hurry of their ascent,\r\nthe second line pressed so closely upon the first as to occasion\r\nsome confusion on the left when again getting into line, and it was\r\nin consequence of this disorder that the squadrons of horse forsook\r\ntheir position on the left, and took ground on the right.\r\n\r\nBefore the insurgents reached the summit of the moor, Argyle’s right\r\nwing was fully formed, but the greater part of his centre and left,\r\nwho were moving up the ascent by a gradual progression from right\r\nto left, had not yet reached their ground. Argyle’s right now found\r\nitself within pistol-shot of Mar’s left, but from the greater extent\r\nof Mar’s line, it considerably outflanked Argyle’s left.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Earl of Mar perceived that Argyle’s line was only\r\npartially formed, he resolved instantly to attack him before he\r\nshould be able to complete his arrangements; and having sent orders\r\nto his right and left to fall simultaneously upon the enemy, Mar\r\nplaced himself at the head of the clans, and being apprised by a\r\nfiring on his left that the action had commenced, he pulled off his\r\nhat, which he waved, and with a huzza led forward his men upon the\r\nhalf-formed battalions which composed the left wing of the enemy.\r\nArrived within pistol-shot, the Highlanders, according to custom,\r\npoured in a volley upon the English infantry. The fire was instantly\r\nreturned, and, to the dismay of the Highlanders, Alan Muidartach,\r\nthe captain of Clanranald, was mortally wounded. He was instantly\r\ncarried off the field, and, as his men clustered around him, he\r\nencouraged them to stand firm to their posts, and expressed a hope\r\nthat the result of the struggle in which they were engaged would be\r\nfavourable to the cause of his sovereign. The loss of a chief, who,\r\nfrom the stately magnificence with which he upheld his rank, and\r\nthe urbanity of his disposition, had acquired an ascendency over\r\nthe minds of his people, could not fail to depress their spirits,\r\nand make them almost overlook the danger of their situation. While\r\nabsorbed in grief, they were in a moment roused from their dejection\r\nby Glengary, who, observing their conduct at this juncture, sprung\r\nforward, and throwing his bonnet into the air, cried aloud, in the\r\nexpressive language of his country, “Revenge! Revenge! Revenge\r\nto-day, and mourning to-morrow!” No sooner had this brave chieftain\r\npronounced these words, than the Highlanders rushed forward, sword\r\nin hand, with the utmost fury, upon the royalist battalions. The\r\ngovernment troops attempted to stem the impetuosity of the attack,\r\nby opposing the Highlanders with fixed bayonets, but the latter\r\npushed them aside with their targets, and rushing in with their\r\nbroad-swords among the enemy, spread death and terror around them.\r\nThe three battalions on Argyle’s left, which had never been properly\r\nformed, unable to rally, instantly gave way, and falling back upon\r\nsome squadrons of horse in their rear, created such confusion,\r\nthat within seven or eight minutes after the assault, the form of\r\na battalion or squadron was no longer discernible. A complete rout\r\nensued; and there seems no doubt that the whole of Argyle’s left\r\nwould have been completely destroyed, had not General Witham, at the\r\nhead of the squadrons which were upon the left of the battalions,\r\nchecked the advance of Mar’s horse by a charge, in which he succeeded\r\nin capturing a standard. Afraid of being outflanked by Argyle’s left\r\nwing, which extended far beyond his position, and being ignorant of\r\nwhat was passing on the right wing of the royalists, the view of\r\nwhich was concealed by the unevenness of the ground, Witham retired\r\nin the direction of Dunblane. The Earl of Mar pursued the disordered\r\nmass to the distance of only half a mile, and having ordered his\r\nfoot to halt till he should put them in order, resolved to follow\r\nthe enemy and complete the victory; but receiving intelligence that\r\nhis left wing and second line had given way, and that his artillery\r\nhad been taken, he retraced his steps, and took up a position on the\r\ntop of the stony hill of Kippendavie, till he should receive further\r\ninformation respecting the fate of his left wing.\r\n\r\nThis wing, which was the first to begin the attack, opened a fire\r\nupon Argyle’s right wing when almost within pistol shot. The\r\nHighlanders thereafter steadily advanced, and pouring a second volley\r\namong the enemy, with a precision and effect not to be surpassed by\r\nthe best disciplined troops, rushed up, sword in hand, to the very\r\nmuzzles of their muskets. Though the fire was destructive, and made\r\nEvans’s dragoons reel for a time, the English troops maintained their\r\nground, and the foot kept up a platooning, which checked the fury of\r\ntheir assailants. The struggle continued for some time without any\r\ndecided advantage on either side; but as Argyle began to perceive\r\nthat he could make no impression in front upon the numerous masses of\r\nthe insurgents, and that he might be out-flanked by them, he resolved\r\nto attack them on their flank with part of his cavalry, while his\r\nfoot should gall them with their fire in front. He therefore ordered\r\nColonel Cathcart to move along the morass to the right with a strong\r\nbody of cavalry, and to fall upon the flank of Mar’s left wing,\r\na movement which he executed with great skill. Cathcart, after\r\nreceiving a fire from the insurgent horse, immediately charged them,\r\nbut they sustained the assault with great firmness. Borne down by\r\nthe superior weight of the English dragoons, whose horses were much\r\nlarger than those of the insurgents, the Scottish horse, after nearly\r\nhalf-an-hour’s contest, were compelled to give way. The foot of\r\nArgyle’s right having made a simultaneous attack upon Mar’s first\r\nline of foot, the latter also were forced to fall back, and Mar’s\r\nhorse and foot coming into contact with his second line, they mixed\r\nindiscriminately, and a general rout in consequence ensued.\r\n\r\nAfter receding a short distance, the insurgent horse, which consisted\r\nprincipally of the Jacobite gentry of Perthshire and Angus, attempted\r\nto rally, and even to charge Argyle’s cavalry in their turn, but\r\nthey were again forced to retire by the pressure of the English\r\ndragoons, who kept advancing in regular order upon the receding\r\nmasses of the insurgents. Determined, however, not to yield one inch\r\nof ground without the utmost necessity, the cavalier horse made\r\nrepeated efforts to drive the enemy back, and, in the course of their\r\nretreat, made ten or twelve attempts at different places to rally\r\nand charge the advancing foe; but unable to resist the overwhelming\r\npressure of the English cavalry, they were, after three hours’ hard\r\nfighting, driven across the river Allan by Argyle’s dragoons. Some\r\nidea may be formed of the obstinacy of the contest, when it is\r\nconsidered that the distance from the field of battle to the river\r\nis scarcely three miles. To the gallant stand made by the horse may\r\nbe ascribed the safety of the foot, who would have been probably all\r\ncut to pieces by the dragoons, if the attention of the latter had\r\nnot been chiefly occupied by the horse. The foot, however, suffered\r\nconsiderably in the retreat, notwithstanding the humanity of the Duke\r\nof Argyle, who endeavoured to restrain the carnage. Besides offering\r\nquarter to such of the Jacobite gentlemen as were personally known to\r\nhim, he displayed his anxiety for the preservation of his countrymen\r\nso far, that on observing a party of his dragoons cutting down a body\r\nof foot, into which they had thrown themselves, he exclaimed with a\r\nfeeling of deep emotion, “Oh, spare the poor Blue-bonnets!”\r\n\r\nAs Mar’s right wing had been concealed from the view of Argyle,\r\nthe latter conceived that the numerous body he was driving before\r\nhim formed the entire insurgent army. He, therefore, resolved to\r\ncontinue the pursuit till dark, and to support him, he ordered\r\nGeneral Wightman, who commanded his foot upon the right, to follow\r\nhim with his battalions as quickly as possible. Wightman accordingly\r\nproceeded to follow the duke with a force of rather more than three\r\nregiments; but he had not marched far, when he heard a firing on his\r\nleft, to ascertain the cause of which, he sent his aide-de-camp in\r\nthe direction whence the firing proceeded. This officer returned in\r\na short time, and reported that the half of Argyle’s foot, and the\r\nsquadrons on the left, had all been cut off by the right of the\r\ninsurgents, which was superior in point of numbers to Argyle’s left.\r\nWightman thereupon slackened his pace, and despatched a messenger\r\nto inform the duke of the fate of his left wing. Afraid of being\r\nattacked in his rear by Mar’s right wing, he kept his men in perfect\r\norder, but no demonstration was made to follow him. When informed\r\nof the defeat of his left wing, Argyle gave over the pursuit, and\r\njoining Wightman with five squadrons of dragoons, put his men in\r\norder of battle and marched boldly to the bottom of the hill, on the\r\ntop of which the enemy, amounting to 4,000 men, were advantageously\r\nposted. Argyle had now scarcely 1,000 men under him, and as these\r\nwere already greatly exhausted, he judged it expedient to act on the\r\ndefensive; but the insurgents showed no disposition to engage, and\r\nboth parties, as if by mutual consent, retired from their positions\r\nin different directions. The duke filed off his men to the right, in\r\nmarching order, towards Dunblane; but as he still dreaded an attack,\r\nhe formed his men several times on the march, wherever he found the\r\nground convenient, and waited the approach of the enemy. Mar drew off\r\nhis men toward Ardoch, where he passed the night, and Argyle’s troops\r\nlay under arms during the night in the neighbourhood of Dunblane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE-FIELD OF SHERIFFMUIR\r\n\r\nA. Fullarton & C^o. London & Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, on an occasion of such dubious success\r\non either side, both parties claimed a victory, but impartiality will\r\nconfer the palm on neither.[728] Argyle, it is true, visited the\r\nfield of battle the following morning, which Mar might also have done\r\nhad he been inclined, and this circumstance, therefore, can afford no\r\nargument in support of his pretensions. Neither can the capture of\r\nstandards and colours by Argyle be considered as a proof of success,\r\nfor although he took fourteen colours and standards, including the\r\nroyal standard called “the Restoration,” besides six pieces of cannon\r\nand other trophies, Mar, according to the official Jacobite account,\r\ncaptured four stands of colours, several drums, and about 1,400 or\r\n1,500 stands of arms. Accounts the most contradictory have been given\r\nby both parties of the losses sustained by them. According to the\r\nrolls of Argyle’s muster-master general, his loss amounted to 290\r\nmen killed, 187 wounded, and 133 prisoners, making a grand total of\r\n610, while the Jacobite account makes the loss in killed and wounded\r\non the side of Argyle amount to between 700 and 800. On the other\r\nhand, the Jacobites state their loss in killed at only 60, and that\r\nvery few of their men were wounded, while the royalists say that\r\nthey lost, in killed and wounded, about 800 men.[730] Supposing the\r\nroyalist statement correct, the comparative loss of the insurgents\r\nscarcely exceeded one-third of that sustained by the government\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nSeveral officers were killed on the royalist side. Among the\r\nwounded was the Earl of Forfar, a brave officer who commanded\r\nMorison’s regiment. He received a shot in the knee, and sixteen\r\nother wounds, of which he died at Stirling about three weeks after\r\nthe battle. Several persons of distinction were killed on the side\r\nof the insurgents, among whom were the Earl of Strathmore, and the\r\nCaptain of Clanranald. A considerable number of gentlemen were\r\ntaken prisoners by Argyle, but many of them escaped, and he was\r\nable to carry only 82 of them to Stirling. Of this number were Lord\r\nStrathallan, Thomas Drummond his brother, Walkinshaw of Barrowfield,\r\nDrummond of Logie-Drummond, and Murray of Auchtertyre.\r\n\r\nOn whichsoever side success lay, the battle, in its consequences,\r\nwas most important in many respects to the government, as it was\r\nimmediately followed by the desertion of a considerable number of\r\nthe clans. With the exception of the Macdonalds, who particularly\r\ndistinguished themselves on the right, and the Perthshire and\r\nAngus horse who withstood the repeated shocks of Argyle’s cavalry,\r\nthe remainder of the insurgent army made little resistance. The\r\nMacphersons and the Macgregors, (the latter commanded by Rob\r\nRoy,[731] the chief’s uncle), did not join in the contest at all,\r\nbut looked on as if unconcerned about the result. Some of the\r\nclans, disgusted at the pusillanimity or indifference exhibited by\r\ntheir associates, and others dispirited by the firmness displayed\r\nby the government forces, returned to their homes, thus verifying\r\nthe observation made by a Jacobite in reference to the clans, that\r\nwhether victorious or beaten, they would run away and go home. The\r\ndefection of these clans was a severe blow to Mar, and made him\r\nabandon the idea of crossing the Forth. He, therefore, returned to\r\nPerth with the remains of his army, and to encourage the friends of\r\nthe Jacobite interest, circulated the most favourable accounts of his\r\nalleged success at Sheriffmuir, and of the state of the Chevalier’s\r\naffairs, although he himself began to consider them desperate.[732]\r\nThe Duke of Argyle, on the other hand, retired to his head-quarters\r\nat Stirling, intending to resume offensive operations as soon as some\r\nexpected reinforcements should arrive.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of Mar to disguise the real state of matters was too\r\ngross to deceive his adherents, and there were not a few who already\r\nbegan to entertain thoughts of making their own terms with the\r\ngovernment: but the Highland chiefs and the principal officers\r\nremained firm, and urged Mar to risk another battle even with his\r\nreduced forces. The earl, however, though personally brave, was not\r\nthe man to comply with an advice so opposed to the rule he had laid\r\ndown for himself, never to engage without a very superior force on\r\nhis side. But had he been of a different opinion, the receipt of the\r\nnews of the re-capture of Inverness would probably have precluded him\r\nfrom moving a second time upon Stirling.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked as a singular circumstance in this history\r\nof Mar’s insurrection, that the three important events which\r\ndecided its fate should have occurred in regular daily succession.\r\nInverness was captured on the 13th of November,[733] and on the\r\nsame day Mackintosh’s forces, cooped up in Preston, had to maintain\r\na precarious struggle against the attacks of Wells’s army. Next\r\nday witnessed the battle of Sheriffmuir, and at the very time the\r\ninsurgents in Preston were offering terms of surrender, the right\r\nwings of Argyle’s and Mar’s armies were pursuing, with all the\r\nconfidence of victory, the wings to which they were respectively\r\nopposed. And lastly, while on the 14th the insurgents in England\r\nwere capitulating at Preston, the two rival armies in the north were\r\nretiring to their head-quarters, each of them claiming a victory.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Chevalier had been long anxiously looked for\r\nby his friends in Scotland. He was now about to gratify their\r\ndesire of beholding his person; but James had already missed the\r\ngolden opportunity, which presented itself at an early stage of the\r\ninsurrection, of recovering his father’s crown. Had he, on arriving\r\nat St. Malo, whither he proceeded from Lorraine at the breaking out\r\nof the insurrection, instantly taken shipping, he would not only have\r\ncomplied with the declared wishes of his adherents, but would have\r\nevinced at once a determination to maintain his claim. Instead of\r\nembarking, however, immediately, as he should have done, he spent so\r\nmuch time in the shipment of supplies, which he was desirous should\r\nprecede his departure, that he was at last altogether prevented\r\nfrom sailing by some men-of-war, which appeared off the harbour\r\nof St. Malo, and which had been sent by the British government to\r\nintercept him. That he might not disappoint the expectations of his\r\npartisans, he resolved to go to Dunkirk in quest of shipping, and\r\nhaving traversed the country in disguise, he embarked at that port,\r\nabout the middle of December, on board a small French vessel of eight\r\nguns, which had formerly been a privateer. He was attended by five\r\npersons only, who, to prevent suspicion, were disguised as French\r\nofficers. Among these were the Marquis of Tynemouth, son of the Duke\r\nof Berwick, and Lieutenant Allan Cameron, a son of Lochiel.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the evident risk which he ran, by attempting a descent\r\nupon the eastern coast of Scotland, he sailed from Dunkirk in the\r\nsmall vessel in which he had embarked, after leaving instructions to\r\ndespatch after him two other vessels that lay in the harbour with\r\nhis domestics, and some stores for the use of his army. It was the\r\nChevalier’s intention to have landed in the vicinity of the Frith\r\nof Tay, and accordingly, after steering in a northerly direction,\r\nhe stood across for the coast of Angus, which was descried after a\r\nvoyage of five days; but observing, at some distance, a sail, which\r\nhe judged to be unfriendly, he altered his course to northward with\r\nthe design of landing at Peterhead, of which the Earl Marischal was\r\nthe feudal superior. The vessel which carried the Chevalier came,\r\nhowever, sufficiently near to land to intimate by signals to the\r\nfriends of the prince in the neighbourhood that he was on board,\r\nwhich intelligence was immediately conveyed to the camp at Perth,\r\nwhere it was received with a feeling of intense delight.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier arrived off Peterhead, on the 22d of December, seven\r\ndays from the date of his departure from Dunkirk, and immediately\r\nlanded with his small retinue of five persons, all disguised as\r\nseamen. After despatching the vessel to France with the news of his\r\narrival, he and his companions took up their abode in the town for\r\nthe night. He passed the next night at Newburgh, a seat of the Earl\r\nMarischal, having previously sent Lieutenant Cameron to Perth with\r\nthe intelligence of his landing. The Chevalier continued his journey\r\ntowards Perth, and on the 24th passed _incognito_ through Aberdeen,\r\nand arrived at Fetteresso, the principal seat of the Earl Marischal,\r\nwhere he remained several days. As soon as Lieutenant Cameron reached\r\nPerth, the Earl of Mar, the Earl Marischal, General Hamilton, and\r\nabout thirty other gentlemen, mounted their horses, and set off to\r\nmeet the Chevalier. This cavalcade arrived at Fetteresso on the 27th,\r\nand the persons composing it were introduced to “the king,” and had\r\nthe honour of kissing his hand. After the breaking up of the court,\r\nthe Chevalier was proclaimed at the gates of the house, and printed\r\ncopies of the declaration which he had issued in Lorraine were\r\nimmediately dispersed.[734]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier intended to have proceeded next day on his journey to\r\nPerth, but he was detained at Fetteresso till the 2d of January, by\r\ntwo successive fits of ague, which, however, did not prevent him\r\nfrom receiving addresses from the “Episcopal clergy of the diocese\r\nof Aberdeen,” and from the magistrates, town council, and Jacobite\r\ninhabitants of the town.\r\n\r\nWhile at Fetteresso the Chevalier exercised some of the functions of\r\nroyalty, by conferring titles of dignity on some of his adherents.\r\nHe raised the Earl of Mar to a dukedom; and, according to report,\r\nconferred the honour of knighthood upon Bannerman, the Jacobite\r\nprovost of Aberdeen, who presented the address from that city. Having\r\nrecovered from his attack, the Chevalier left Fetteresso on the 2d of\r\nJanuary, and went to Brechin, where he passed the night. Next day he\r\nmoved forward to Kinnaird, and on the 4th reached Glammis Castle, the\r\nprincipal seat of the Earl of Strathmore. At Glammis Mar drew up a\r\nletter, in which he gave a very flattering account of the Chevalier.\r\nAs the object of this letter was to impress the people with a\r\nfavourable opinion of the Chevalier, Mar ordered it to be printed and\r\ncirculated as widely as possible. The letter is written with address,\r\nand may still be perused with interest:\r\n\r\n  “Glames, 5 Jan. 1716.\r\n\r\n  “I met the king at Fetteresso on Tuesday se’enight, where we\r\n  staid till Friday; from thence we came to Brechin, then to\r\n  Kinnaird, and yesterday here. The king designed to have gone to\r\n  Dundee to-day, but there is such a fall of snow that he is forced\r\n  to put it off till to-morrow, if it be practicable then; and\r\n  from thence he designs to go to Scoon. There was no haste in his\r\n  being there sooner, for nothing can be done this season, else he\r\n  had not been so long by the way. People, everywhere, as we have\r\n  come along, are excessively fond to see him, and express that\r\n  duty they ought. Without any compliment to him, and to do him\r\n  nothing but justice, set aside his being a prince, he is really\r\n  the first gentleman I ever knew: He has a very good presence, and\r\n  resembles King Charles a great deal. His presence, however, is\r\n  not the best of him. He has fine parts, and despatches all his\r\n  business himself with the greatest exactness. I never saw any\r\n  body write so finely. He is affable to a great degree, without\r\n  losing that majesty he ought to have, and has the sweetest\r\n  temper in the world. In a word, he is every way fitted to make\r\n  us a happy people, were his subjects worthy of him. To have him\r\n  peaceably settled on his throne, is what these kingdoms do not\r\n  deserve; but he deserves it so much that I hope there is a good\r\n  fate attending him. I am sure there is nothing wanting to make\r\n  the rest of his subjects as fond of him as we are, but their\r\n  knowing him as we do; and it will be odd if his presence among\r\n  us, after his running so many hazards to compass it, do not turn\r\n  the hearts, even of the most obstinate. It is not fit to tell all\r\n  the particulars, but I assure you he has left nothing undone,\r\n  that well could be, to gain every body; and I hope God will touch\r\n  their hearts.\r\n\r\n  “I have reason to hope we shall very quickly see a new face of\r\n  affairs abroad in the king’s favour, which is all I dare commit\r\n  to paper.\r\n\r\n  “MAR.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th of January the Chevalier left Glammis for\r\nDundee, which town he entered about eleven o’clock a.m. on horseback,\r\namidst the acclamations of the inhabitants, the Earl of Mar riding on\r\nhis right hand, and the Earl Marischal on his left, and followed by\r\na train of nearly 300 adherents on horseback. To gratify the people\r\nwho flocked round him eager to behold him and to kiss his hand, he,\r\nat the request of his friends, remained about an hour on horseback\r\nat the cross of the burgh, after which he rode out to the house\r\nof Stewart of Grandtully in the neighbourhood, where he dined and\r\npassed the night. On the following day he proceeded along the Carse\r\nof Gowrie to Castle Lyon, a seat of the Earl of Strathmore, where\r\nhe dined, and thence to Fingask, the seat of Sir David Threipland,\r\nwhere he spent the night. Next day, being Sunday, he took up his\r\nabode in the royal palace of Scone, where he intended to stay till\r\nthe ceremony of his coronation should be performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES STUART.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEVALIER DE S^T. GEORGE.\r\n\r\nA. Fullarton & C^o. London & Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday the Chevalier made his public entry into Perth. He met,\r\nhowever, with a cold reception, and he himself felt evidently\r\ndisappointed at the appearance of the camp. He had heard much of\r\nthe Highland chiefs and the clans, and being desirous to see “those\r\nlittle kings (the chiefs,) with their armies,” a select body of\r\nHighlanders exhibited before him. Their appearance gave him great\r\nsatisfaction, but when he ascertained the paucity of the number in\r\nthe camp, he could not repress the chagrin and disappointment he\r\nfelt. On the other hand, the friends of the Chevalier were equally\r\ndisappointed. Neither his appearance nor demeanour on the present\r\noccasion tended in any shape to justify the exaggerated encomiums\r\nof Mar, and his lugubrious deportment while at Perth tended more\r\nto alienate the affections of his adherents, and depress their\r\nspirits, than even the disappointment of supplies from France. The\r\nfollowing is an account, doubtfully attributed to the Master of\r\nSinclair, of the appearance of the Chevalier on his arrival at Perth,\r\nhis behaviour while there, and their consequent effects upon his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n“His person was tall and thin, seeming to incline to be lean rather\r\nthan to fill as he grows in years. His countenance was pale, but\r\nperhaps looked more so than usual, by reason he had three fits of\r\nague which took him two days after his coming on shore. Yet he seems\r\nto be sanguine in his constitution, and there is something of a\r\nvivacity in his eye that perhaps would have been more visible if\r\nhe had not been under dejected circumstances, and surrounded with\r\ndiscouragement, which it must be acknowledged were sufficient to\r\nalter the complexion even of his soul as well as of his body. His\r\nspeech was grave, and not very clearly expressive of his thoughts,\r\nnor over much to the purpose; but his words were few, and his\r\nbehaviour and temper seemed always composed. What he was in his\r\ndiversions we know not: here was no room for such things. It was no\r\ntime for mirth. Neither can I say I ever saw him smile. Those who\r\nspeak so positively of his being like King James VII. must excuse me\r\nfor saying, that it seems to say they either never saw this person,\r\nor never saw King James VII.; and yet I must not conceal that when\r\nwe saw the man whom they called our king, we found ourselves not at\r\nall animated by his presence; and if he was disappointed in us, we\r\nwere tenfold more so in him. We saw nothing in him that looked like\r\nspirit. He never appeared with cheerfulness and vigour to animate\r\nus. Our men began to despise him; some asked if he could speak. His\r\ncountenance looked extremely heavy. He cared not to come abroad\r\namongst us soldiers, or to see us handle our arms or do our exercise.\r\nSome said the circumstances he found us in dejected him. I am sure\r\nthe figure he made dejected us; and had he sent us but 5,000 men\r\nof good troops, and never himself come among us, we had done other\r\nthings than we have now done. At the approach of that crisis when\r\nhe was to defend his pretensions, and either lose his life or gain\r\na crown, I think, as his affairs were situated, no man can say that\r\nhis appearing grave and composed was a token of his want of thought,\r\nbut rather of a significant anxiety grounded upon the prospect of his\r\ninevitable ruin, which he could not be so void of sense as not to see\r\nplainly before him, at least when he came to see how inconsistent his\r\nmeasures were, how unsteady the resolution of his guides, and how\r\nimpossible it was to make them agree with one another.”[735]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier returned to Scone in the evening, and notwithstanding\r\nthe ominous symptoms of the day, proceeded to form a council\r\npreparatory to exercising the functions of royalty. From Scone\r\nhe soon issued no less than six proclamations; one for a general\r\nthanksgiving for his safe arrival; another enjoining the ministers\r\nto pray for him in the churches; a third, establishing the currency\r\nof foreign coin; a fourth, ordering a meeting of the convention of\r\nestates; a fifth, commanding all fencible men from sixteen to sixty\r\nto repair to his standard; and a sixth, fixing the 23d of January for\r\nhis coronation at Scone. These assumptions of sovereign authority\r\nwere, however, of a very evanescent character, as they had scarcely\r\nbeen issued when the Chevalier and his principal friends resolved to\r\nabandon the contest as hopeless. Indeed, from the reduced state of\r\nthe army, and its deficiency in arms and ammunition, a determination\r\nhad been come to by his party, a month before he landed, to retire\r\nfrom Perth as soon as Argyle should march against it; but being\r\nignorant of that resolution, and believing that the insurgents\r\nintended to defend Perth, Argyle delayed his advance till he should\r\nbe joined by large reinforcements from England and Holland.\r\n\r\nThough continued in the command of the army, Argyle, for some reason\r\nor other, was not a favourite at court. Of his fidelity there could\r\nbe no suspicion, and his conduct had lately shown that he wanted\r\nneither zeal nor ability to perform the task which had been assigned\r\nhim. It has been conjectured that the leniency which he was disposed\r\nto show towards his unfortunate countrymen was the cause of that\r\nhidden displeasure which ended in the dismissal of himself and of his\r\nbrother, the Earl of Islay, from all their employments. The rejection\r\nof an application which he made to the government for extended powers\r\nto treat with the insurgents after the battle of Sheriffmuir, goes\r\nfar to support the supposition. But whatever were his views, he\r\nappeared to be in no hurry to pursue the insurgents, probably from\r\nan idea that they would disperse of their own accord. By the arrival\r\nof a body of 6,000 Dutch auxiliaries, and other reinforcements from\r\nEngland, Argyle found himself, early in January, at the head of\r\nupwards of 10,000 men, besides a large train of artillery. Desirous\r\nof expelling the insurgents from Fife before advancing north, a\r\ndetachment of Dutch and Scotch troops crossed the Frith of Forth\r\nby the duke’s orders, and under cover of some men-of-war, landed\r\nat Burntisland, of which they took possession. On receiving this\r\nintelligence the insurgents immediately abandoned all the towns\r\non the north side of the Frith, a circumstance which was attended\r\nwith serious consequences to their friends at Perth, who were in\r\nconsequence entirely cut off from their supplies of coals, at an\r\nunusually inclement season.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of January, Argyle was in full condition to march\r\nnorth, but the snow, which had fallen to a great depth, appeared\r\nto him to offer a formidable obstruction to the march of an army\r\nunaccustomed to a winter’s campaign; and which, from the insurgents\r\nhaving burnt and destroyed the villages on the road, would have to\r\nbivouac two or three nights in the open air, exposed to all the\r\nrigours of a northern winter. For these reasons Argyle urged, at a\r\ncouncil of war, which was held at Stirling, a postponement of the\r\nmarch; but General Cadogan,[736] who had been sent down to Scotland\r\nto hasten the duke’s motions, insisting upon an immediate advance,\r\nand having openly accused Argyle of a want of zeal, his Grace made\r\npreparations for marching, and to facilitate the transport of his\r\ncannon and waggons, issued orders for assembling some thousands of\r\nthe country people to clear away the snow.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Jacobite leaders had come to the resolution of\r\nabandoning Perth as soon as the Duke of Argyle should advance upon\r\nit, they nevertheless gave indications as if they really meant\r\nto hold out. Pursuant to an order of a council, which was held on\r\nthe 16th of January, the most strenuous exertions were made to\r\nfortify the town, and both officers and men vied with one another\r\nin hastening the completion of the works. What the motives of the\r\nleaders may have been in thus practising a deception upon the army\r\nit is impossible to conceive; perhaps the distant hope of being\r\njoined by the more remote clans, the chance of some fortunate, though\r\nunlooked for, occurrence in the chapter of accidents, or an idea\r\nthat their men could not be otherwise kept together, may have been\r\nthe inducing causes of these defensive preparations; but whatever\r\ntheir motives were, the apparent determination shown by the leading\r\nmen to meet the enemy, had the most beneficial effect upon the army,\r\nwhich evinced a strong desire to engage. In this wish they thought\r\nthey were to be gratified sooner than they expected, by the arrival\r\nof some country people at Perth who brought intelligence that Argyle\r\nwas advancing with all his cavalry, and 4,000 foot mounted on\r\nhorses. This news was, however, premature, and had originated in the\r\nappearance of a reconnoitring party of 200 dragoons, which Argyle had\r\nsent forward on the road to Perth, on the 21st of January, and which\r\nthe fears of the people had magnified into an army.\r\n\r\nAll doubts, however, were removed in a few days, by the receipt of\r\nauthentic intelligence at Perth, that Argyle having completed his\r\narrangements, was to leave Stirling for Perth on the 29th of January,\r\nwith his whole army. The councillors of the Chevalier were dismayed\r\nat this intelligence, but it had quite an opposite effect upon the\r\nmass of the army. Nothing was to be heard in the Jacobite camp but\r\nthe voice of joy and rejoicing, and congratulations, on the expected\r\nhappy result of an encounter with the enemy, were exchanged on all\r\nsides--between the officers and gentlemen volunteers, and the common\r\nsoldiers and clansmen. While the former were pledging each other in\r\ntheir cups and drinking to “the good day,” so near at hand, as they\r\nthought, which was to crown the Chevalier’s arms with victory, the\r\nlatter, amid the din of the warlike bagpipe, were to be seen giving\r\neach other a cordial shake of the hand as if fully assured of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWhilst these congratulatory exhibitions were going on, the\r\ncouncillors of the Chevalier were deliberating upon the course they\r\nshould pursue; but although they sat during the whole night they\r\ncould come to no decided resolution. When the irresolution of the\r\ncouncil became generally known, the men could not restrain their\r\nindignation, and a general opinion began to prevail among them that\r\nthey had been betrayed. Impressed with this feeling, they became\r\nmutinous, and carried their insubordination so far as to insult the\r\nofficers, whom they supposed had betrayed them, in the streets, and\r\nto load them with reproachful epithets. The gentlemen volunteers\r\nalso participated in the same sentiments; and one of them from the\r\nhigher parts of Aberdeenshire was heard to declare before a group\r\nof malcontents assembled in the streets, that the clans should take\r\nthe person of the Chevalier out of the hands of the weak councillors\r\nwho surrounded him, adding that he would find 10,000 gentlemen in\r\nScotland who would hazard their lives for him, if he was equally\r\nready as a prince to risk his own life in vindicating his right to\r\nthe crown. A friend of the Earl of Mar, after remonstrating with this\r\nparty, asked what they wished their officers to do.--“Do,” replied\r\na Highlander, “what did you call us to take arms for? Was it to run\r\naway? What did the king come hither for? Was it to see his people\r\nbutchered by hangmen, and not strike a stroke for their lives? Let us\r\ndie like men and not like dogs.”[737]\r\n\r\nAmid the confusion and perplexity occasioned by such a state of\r\nthings, Mar convened another meeting of the council on the evening of\r\nthe 29th, at which a resolution to retreat was entered into chiefly\r\nat Mar’s suggestion. His reasons for advising an abandonment of the\r\nenterprise for the present, were, 1st, the failure of the Duke of\r\nOrmond’s attempt to invade England; 2dly, the great accession of\r\nforce which Argyle had received from abroad; and, lastly, the reduced\r\nstate of the Jacobite forces, which did not exceed 4,000 men, and\r\nof whom only about 2,500 were properly armed.[738] Besides these\r\nthere were, according to the Master of Sinclair, other reasons of a\r\nprivate nature which influenced Mar to give the advice he did, the\r\nchief of which, says the above-named authority, was that the Earl\r\nof Seaforth, the Marquis of Huntly, and other Jacobites who were in\r\ntreaty with the government, had basely resolved to deliver up the\r\nChevalier to the Duke of Argyle, that they might procure better terms\r\nfor themselves than they could otherwise expect. This odious charge,\r\nwhich is not corroborated by any other writer, must be looked upon as\r\nhighly improbable.\r\n\r\nBefore communicating to the army the resolution to retreat, a general\r\nmeeting of all the officers was held at Scone on the following day,\r\nwhen they were informed of the determination of the previous evening,\r\nand of the reasons which had led to it. It was then secretly resolved\r\nthat the Chevalier and his principal officers should take shipping at\r\nMontrose for France, and that the army should be disbanded as soon\r\nas it reached the Highlands, or as soon as circumstances permitted;\r\nbut to save appearances with the men, it was given out, that as Perth\r\nwas untenable, it became necessary to retire to a stronger position,\r\nwhere they could not only defend themselves, but keep up a more\r\nsecure and direct communication with their friends in the north. At\r\nthis time there were three ships lying in the Tay off Dundee, which\r\nhad lately arrived with supplies from France; and to secure these for\r\nthe conveyance of the Chevalier and his followers, a French officer\r\nand clergyman were despatched to Dundee with orders to send them down\r\nthe coast to Montrose, there to wait his arrival.[739]\r\n\r\nOn the return of the officers to the camp, they promulgated the order\r\nto retreat to their men, and, as might have been anticipated, it was\r\nreceived with scorn and contempt. Among the Jacobite inhabitants of\r\nthe town who had shown themselves very zealous in the cause of the\r\nChevalier, the intelligence caused nothing but dismay, as from the\r\nprominent and decided part they had taken, they had incurred the\r\npenalties of treason against the government. The morning of the 31st\r\nof January was fixed upon for the retreat, but a body of about 800\r\nHighlanders, disliking the aspect of affairs, and displeased with the\r\nconduct of the principal officers, quitted Perth the preceding night\r\nfor the Highlands by way of Dunkeld. Preparatory to his departure,\r\nthe Chevalier went from Scone to Perth in the evening, and took up\r\nhis residence in the house of Hay the provost, a stanch Jacobite,\r\nwhere he supped and passed the night. At ten o’clock next morning the\r\nrebels began their march across the Tay, which was covered with ice\r\nof extraordinary thickness. About noon the whole army had passed, and\r\nwas on the march to Dundee along the Carse of Gowrie.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Argyle was advancing upon Perth as fast as\r\nthe nature of the difficulties he had to contend with would admit\r\nof. He had left Stirling on the 29th of January, and marched to\r\nDunblane. Next day he advanced as far as Auchterarder, which had\r\nbeen entirely burnt by the rebels. Here they passed the night\r\nupon the snow without “any other covering than the fine canopy of\r\nheaven.”[740] On the following day a detachment of 200 dragoons and\r\n400 foot, which had been sent forward to protect the country people\r\nwho were engaged in clearing away the snow, took possession of the\r\ncastle of Tullibardine, the garrison of which had capitulated. The\r\nDuke of Argyle had resolved to take up his quarters for the night in\r\nthis fortress; but receiving intelligence that the rebels had retired\r\nfrom Perth that morning, he ordered a party of 400 dragoons and 1,000\r\nfoot to hasten forward to take possession of that town. The duke,\r\nat the head of the dragoons, arrived at Perth about two o’clock in\r\nthe morning of the 1st of February; but the foot, who were greatly\r\nfatigued, did not come up till ten o’clock. The remainder of the\r\nduke’s army reached Perth that evening.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Stirling to Perth is only 34 miles, yet such was\r\nthe obstruction that Argyle’s army met with from the snow, that their\r\nmarch occupied three entire days. The difficulties of the march and\r\nthe privations which his men had suffered by resting two nights on\r\nthe snow, exposed to all the severities of the weather, had so\r\nexhausted his men, that it was not till the day after his arrival\r\nat Perth that the duke could muster a force sufficiently strong to\r\npursue the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of February Argyle left Perth at the head of six squadrons\r\nof dragoons, three battalions of foot, and 800 Highlanders. He\r\nstopped at Errol that night, and entered Dundee next day. Having\r\nlearned that the Chevalier had left Dundee the preceding day on\r\nhis way to Montrose, the duke sent forward a detachment towards\r\nArbroath, and being joined by the remainder of his army on the 4th\r\nof February, he despatched on the same day three battalions of foot,\r\n500 of his own Highlanders, and 50 dragoons, towards Arbroath, and\r\nanother detachment of 300 foot, and 50 dragoons, in the direction\r\nof Brechin; but their march was retarded for some time by the snow.\r\nOn the 5th the duke followed with the remainder of the army; and\r\nwhile he himself, at the head of the cavalry, took the high road to\r\nBrechin, General Cadogan with the infantry marched in the direction\r\nof Arbroath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Second Duke of Argyle.]\r\n\r\nDuring the retreat to Montrose, suspicions began to be entertained\r\nin the Chevalier’s army, that it was his intention to embark for\r\nFrance, notwithstanding the assurances of the principal officers to\r\nthe contrary. The unusual route along the sea-coast gave credence\r\nto the rumour; but when they approached Montrose, and saw some\r\nFrench vessels lying at anchor off the shore, their suspicions were\r\nconfirmed, and the men began to manifest symptoms of discontent.\r\nThe insurgent army arrived at Montrose on the 3d of February, where\r\nit was intended they should pass the night; but the Chevalier’s\r\nadvisers, alarmed at the murmurings of the troops, ordered them to\r\nmarch the same night towards Aberdeen, where it was given out they\r\nmeant to make a stand till succours should arrive from abroad. This\r\nassurance had the desired effect upon the troops, who accordingly\r\nbegan their march in the expectation that the Chevalier would follow\r\nthem. To prevent suspicion, his horses were ordered to be brought\r\nbefore the door of the house where he lodged at the hour appointed\r\nfor the march, and his guards were ordered to mount, and to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to accompany him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Chevalier was busily employed in making the necessary\r\npreparations for his approaching departure. To relieve his memory\r\nfrom the imputation of having voluntarily abandoned the brave men\r\nwho had taken up arms in his cause, it is due to him to state that\r\nhe had been all along opposed to such a step, and it was not until\r\nhe had been repeatedly and earnestly urged by his friends that he\r\ncould be prevailed upon to give his consent to retire beyond seas.\r\nHe said he was ready to suffer every hardship, and expose himself\r\nto every danger, rather than abandon those who had risked their all\r\nin his service; but being assured by his friends, that the course\r\nthey advised might be ultimately beneficial to both, he reluctantly\r\nyielded to their entreaties. His principal motive for acceding\r\nto their wishes was the consideration that, if relieved from his\r\npresence, the government might be disposed to give better terms to\r\nhis followers than they would be otherwise disposed to grant.[741]\r\n\r\nBefore his departure he ordered a commission to be drawn up, by which\r\nhe appointed General Gordon commander-in-chief, with all necessary\r\npowers, and particularly with authority to treat with the enemy. He\r\nwrote, at the same time, a paper containing his reasons for leaving\r\nthe kingdom, and along with which he delivered to the general all the\r\nmoney in his possession, (excepting a small sum which he reserved\r\nfor defraying the expenses of himself and suite,) with instructions,\r\nafter paying the army, to apply the residue in indemnifying the\r\ninhabitants of the villages[742] which had been burned, for the\r\nlosses sustained by them. At the same time the Chevalier put the\r\nfollowing letter to the Duke of Argyle, which he dictated to\r\na secretary, into the hands of General Gordon, respecting the\r\nappropriation of the money so left. It is an interesting document,\r\nand exhibits the humanity of the prince in a favourable point of\r\nview:--\r\n\r\n  “FOR THE DUKE OF ARGYLE.\r\n\r\n  “_Montrose, 4th February, 1716._\r\n\r\n  “It was the view of delivering this my ancient kingdom from the\r\n  hardship it lay under, and restoring it to its former happiness\r\n  and independency, that brought me into this country; and all\r\n  hopes of effectuating that at this time being taken from me, I\r\n  have been reduced much against my inclination, but by a cruel\r\n  necessity, to leave the kingdom with as many of my faithful\r\n  subjects as were desirous to follow me, or I able to carry\r\n  with me, that so at least I might secure them from the utter\r\n  destruction that threatens them, since that was the only way left\r\n  me to show them the regard I had for, and the sense I had of\r\n  their unparalleled loyalty.\r\n\r\n  “Among the manifold mortifications I have had in this unfortunate\r\n  expedition, that of being forced to burn several villages, &c.,\r\n  as the only expedient left me for the publick security, was not\r\n  the smallest. It was indeed forced upon me by the violence with\r\n  which my rebellious subjects acted against me, and what they, as\r\n  the first authors of it, must be answerable for, not I: however,\r\n  as I cannot think of leaving this country without making some\r\n  provision to repair that loss, I have, therefore, consigned to\r\n  the magistrates of ---- the sum of ----, desiring and requiring\r\n  of you, if not as an obedient subject, at least as a lover of\r\n  your country, to take care that it be employed to the designed\r\n  use, that I may at least have the satisfaction of having been\r\n  the destruction and ruin of none, at a time I came to free all.\r\n  Whether you have yet received my letter,[743] or what effect it\r\n  hath had upon you, I am as yet ignorant of; but what will become\r\n  of these unhappy nations is but too plaine. I have neglected\r\n  nothing to render them a free and prosperous people; and I fear\r\n  they will find yet more than I the smart of preferring a foreign\r\n  yoak to that obedience they owe me; and what must those who have\r\n  so obstinately resisted both my right and my clemency have to\r\n  answer for? But however things turn, or Providence is pleased\r\n  to dispose of me, I shall never abandon my just right, nor the\r\n  pursuits of it, but with my life; and beseech God so to turn at\r\n  last the hearts of my subjects, as that they may enjoy peace and\r\n  happiness by submitting to what their interest and duty equally\r\n  require of them. As for your own particular, you might, if you\r\n  had pleased, joined interest and greatness in your own person;\r\n  but, though you have refused to do that, I must earnestly request\r\n  of you to do at least all in your power to save your country from\r\n  utter ruin, and to be just at least to them, since you are it not\r\n  to me.\r\n\r\n  “[744]I thought to write this in my own hand, but had not time.\r\n\r\n  “JAMES R.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was accompanied by a note of the following letter to\r\nGeneral Gordon, written in the Chevalier’s own hand:--\r\n\r\n  “General Gordon is hereby empowered, as soon as he has no\r\n  other further occasion for the money left in his hands for the\r\n  subsistence of the troops, to forward, if he thinks fitt, the\r\n  enclosed letter to the duke of Argil, and to fill up the blanks\r\n  of my letter with the name of the town where he shall leave the\r\n  money, and the summ he shall leave.\r\n\r\n  “JAMES R.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until the eve of his departure, that James thought of\r\nselecting the persons he wished to accompany him in his flight,\r\nbut the near approach of the enemy, of whose motions he had just\r\nreceived intelligence, and the murmurings and jealousies of his\r\ntroops compelling him to hasten his departure, he was narrowed in\r\nhis choice, as some of the friends, whose presence he desired, were\r\nat some distance from Montrose. The first individual he pitched upon\r\nwas Mar; but the earl begged that he might be left behind with the\r\narmy. The Chevalier, however, insisted that he should go; and on\r\nrepresenting to him that reasons almost equally strong existed for\r\nMar’s departure as for his own, that his friends would make better\r\nterms with the government without him than with him, and that his\r\nservices could be of no use in Scotland under existing circumstances,\r\nhe gave his consent.\r\n\r\nMatters being adjusted, the Chevalier left his lodgings privately\r\nabout nine o’clock on the evening of the 4th of February, accompanied\r\nonly by one of his domestics, and having met Mar at his lodgings,\r\nthey both proceeded by a private way to the beach, where a boat was\r\nlying in readiness to receive them, which carried them on board a\r\nsmall French vessel that lay at a little distance from the shore. The\r\nboat was immediately sent back, and returned in about a quarter of an\r\nhour with the Earl of Melfort, Lord Drummond, and the remainder of\r\nthe Chevalier’s suite. Being favoured with a fresh breeze from the\r\nwest-south-west, the vessel stood directly out to sea, and after a\r\nvoyage of five days, arrived in safety at Waldam, near Gravelines in\r\nFrench Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents, under General Gordon, marched to Aberdeen, which they\r\nentered on the morning of the 6th of February. Here he communicated\r\nto his men the paper of instructions he had received from the\r\nChevalier, which, he informed them, he had been ordered not to open\r\ntill their arrival at Aberdeen. In this writing the prince complained\r\nof the disappointments he had met with, particularly from abroad,\r\nand informed the army of the necessity he was under, for his own\r\npreservation, to leave the country. He thanked them for having\r\nentered so cheerfully into his service, and imputed the failure of\r\nthe enterprise to the apathy of others, who had not seconded their\r\nefforts as they had promised to do. He advised them to consult their\r\nown safety by keeping together in a body under General Gordon till\r\nhe should order them to disperse, and concluded by encouraging them\r\nto hope for better times. After reading this document, the General\r\nnotified to his men that their pay would cease after that day.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cadogan arrived at Montrose on the afternoon of the 5th\r\nof February with three regiments of foot, and 600 of Argyle’s\r\nHighlanders, and the duke reached Brechin with the dragoons the same\r\nnight. The whole royalist forces continued their march the following\r\nday towards Aberdeen, but they could not overtake the insurgents,\r\nwho were nearly two days’ march in advance. The latter left Aberdeen\r\non the 7th, and the Duke of Argyle entered it the following day at\r\nthe head of 400 dragoons. The main body of the insurgents, chiefly\r\nfoot, marched in the direction of Old Meldrum, but a party of about\r\n200 horse, among whom were many officers and gentlemen-volunteers,\r\ntook the route to Peterhead, where some vessels were lying to carry\r\nthem to France. The Duke of Argyle, without waiting for the coming up\r\nof the rest of his army, immediately sent 200 dragoons, and a party\r\nof foot under Major-General Evans, to cut off the retreat of the\r\nlatter, but he did not overtake them. Upwards of 100 of the gentlemen\r\ncomposing this party escaped to France.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the insurgents continued their march westwards into Moray,\r\nand after marching through Strathspey, retired into Badenoch, where\r\nthey quietly dispersed. During their retreat, however, many, whose\r\nhouses lay contiguous to their route, gradually withdrew from the\r\nranks, so that before their arrival in Badenoch a considerable\r\nreduction had taken place in their numbers. Though closely pursued\r\nby Argyle’s troops, the insurgents did not lose 100 men during the\r\nwhole retreat, so well and orderly was it conducted by the Jacobite\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nAfter the dispersion of the insurgents, about 160 officers and\r\ngentlemen-volunteers who had followed the army into the Highlands,\r\nhearing that two French frigates, destined to receive on board such\r\nof the adherents of the Chevalier as might be inclined to retire\r\nabroad, had arrived off the Orkney coast, sallied from the hills on\r\nhorseback, and crossing the low country of Moray embarked in boats at\r\nBurgh-head, and landed in Caithness. From Caithness they proceeded\r\nto the Orkney islands, where they had the good fortune to reach the\r\nFrench ships, which carried them to Gottenburg. Among this party were\r\nLord Duffus, who, being a seaman, entered into the naval service of\r\nthe King of Sweden, Sir George Sinclair, Sir David Threipland of\r\nFingask, and General Eckline. Most of these refugees entered into the\r\nSwedish army then about to invade Norway.\r\n\r\nThus ended an enterprise badly contrived, and conducted throughout\r\nwith little judgment or energy. Yet notwithstanding the disadvantages\r\nunder which it was attempted, it might have succeeded, if the efforts\r\nof the Scottish Jacobites had been seconded by the Jacobites of\r\nEngland; but the latter, though decidedly hostile to the House of\r\nBrunswick, were not inclined to risk their lives and fortunes in a\r\ndoubtful contest, in support of the pretensions of a prince known\r\nto them only by name, and to whose religion many of them felt a\r\ndeep-rooted repugnance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[722] Burton’s _Scotland_ (1689-1748), vol. ii. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[723] Burton’s _Scotland_, vol. ii. pp. 188, 189.\r\n\r\n[724] Rae, p. 294. _Life of Argyle_, p. 187.\r\n\r\n[725] It must be remembered that these dates are according to the Old\r\nStyle of reckoning, and that to make them accord with the New Style,\r\neleven days must be added: thus, the 10th of November O.

Accordingly we find Rob Roy there in\r\nSeptember and October 1715.\r\n\r\n“From thence he came down with the rest of the clans, and joined\r\ngeneral Gordon in Strathfillan. He was with the clans before\r\nInverary, and was active in making some reprisals both by carrying\r\noff cattle on the banks of Loch-Fyne, and capturing ships that lay at\r\nanchor in the loch.\r\n\r\n“He marched with the clans to Ardoch, and was present at the\r\nbattle of Sheriffmuir, but kept a shy distance, thereby weakening\r\nthat wing of the army to which the Macgregors were placed as a\r\ncorps-de-reserve, on what principle it is not easy to determine, if\r\nit was not, as the bard suggests, to watch who gained the day, and\r\nthen assist them in disposing of the booty.\r\n\r\n“Before the friends of the Stuarts, however, could be properly\r\nbrought to a head, Rob performed a very signal service to many of\r\nthem by an act worthy of his character, and exactly in his own way.\r\nAt the great hunting of Brae Mar, it has been mentioned what a number\r\nof noblemen and chiefs signed the bond of faith and mutual support.\r\nBy the negligence of a chieftain to whose charge this important and\r\ndangerous document was committed, it fell into the hands of Captain\r\nCampbell, then at Fort William; and when it became known that a man\r\nof such determined Whig principles held this bond, those who signed\r\nit were seriously alarmed, and various plans were suggested for\r\nrecovering it. Rob Roy Macgregor, who was at this clan meeting, had\r\nalso affixed his name; but on his own account he was indifferent, as\r\nhe regarded neither king nor government. He was, however, urged by\r\nseveral chiefs, particularly his patron, to exert himself, and if\r\npossible to recover the bond. With this view he went to Fort William\r\nin disguise, not with his usual number of attendants, and getting\r\naccess to Captain Campbell, who was a near relation of his own, he\r\ndiscovered that, out of revenge for the contemptuous manner in which\r\nthe chieftains now treated the captain, he had put the bond into\r\nthe possession of the governor of the garrison, who was resolved\r\nto forward it to the privy council; and Rob, learning by accident\r\nthe day on which it was to be sent, took his leave, and went home.\r\nThe despatch which contained the bond was made up by Governor Hill,\r\nand sent from Fort William, escorted by an ensign’s command, which\r\nin those countries always accompanied the messages of government.\r\nOn the third day’s march, Rob and 50 of his men met this party in\r\nGlendochart, and ordering them to halt, demanded their despatches.\r\nThe officer refused; but Rob told him, that he would either have\r\ntheir lives and the despatches together, or the despatches alone.\r\nThe ferocious looks and appearance of Rob and his men bespoke no\r\nirresolution. The packet was given up; and Rob, having taken out the\r\nbond he wanted, begged the officer would excuse the delay he had\r\noccasioned, and wishing him a good journey, left the military to\r\nproceed unmolested. By this manœuvre many chieftains kept on their\r\nheads, and the forfeiture of many estates was prevented.\r\n\r\n“The following notices are from Mr. Moir’s MSS.\r\n\r\n“One of the causes of the repulse of part of Mar’s forces was the\r\npart which Rob Roy acted; this Rob Roy, or Red Robert, was uncle\r\nto the laird of Macgregor, and commanded that clan in his nephew’s\r\nabsence; but on the day of battle he kept his men together at some\r\ndistance, without allowing them to engage, though they showed all the\r\nwillingness imaginable; and waited only an opportunity to plunder,\r\nwhich was it seems the chief design of his coming there. This clan\r\nare a hardy rough people, but noted for pilfering, as they lie upon\r\nthe border of the Highlands, and this Rob Roy had exercised their\r\ntalents that way, pretty much in a kind of thieving war he carried on\r\nagainst the Duke of Montrose, who had cheated him of a small feudal\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n“The conduct of this gentleman (who was wont, as occasion served,\r\nto assume the name of Campbell, his own being prohibited by act of\r\nparliament) was the more surprising, as he had ever been remarked for\r\ncourage and activity. When desired by one of his own officers to go\r\nand assist his friends, he remarked, ‘If they cannot do it without\r\nme, they cannot do it with me.’ It is more than probable, however,\r\nthat his interference would have decided the day in favour of his\r\nown party. He continued in arms for some years, and committed great\r\ndepredations in the shires of Dumbarton and Lennox, particularly on\r\nthe Duke of Montrose’s lands, defeating several detachments sent to\r\nreduce him.”--_Jacobite Relics_, vol. ii. pp. 248-251.\r\n\r\n[732] _Journal of Mar’s proceedings_, printed at Paris.\r\n\r\n[733] “The coincidence in time, of this achievement, with the\r\nreduction of Preston, and the battle of Sheriffmuir, is remarkable,\r\nand was much dwelt on at the time. But perhaps the day of the capture\r\nof Inverness not being exactly known--though it was certainly about\r\nthe middle of November--it is not unlikely that the coincidence\r\nmay have created a tendency to assign it to the 13th.”--Burton’s\r\n_Scotland_ (1689-1747), vol. ii. p. 189 (note).\r\n\r\n[734] _Annals of 2d year of George I._, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[735] _A true account of the proceedings at Perth_, by a Rebel.\r\n\r\n[736] This officer appears to have been very suspicious of Argyle’s\r\nmotives, and did not hesitate to communicate his opinion to his\r\nsuperiors. In a letter to the Duke of Marlborough, he says: “Argyle\r\ngrows so intolerably uneasy, that it is almost impossible to live\r\nwith him any longer; he is enraged at the success of the expedition,\r\nthough he and his creatures attribute to themselves the honour of\r\nit. When I brought him the news of the rebels having ran from Perth,\r\nhe seemed thunderstruck; and was so visibly concerned, that even\r\nthe foreign officers that were in the room took notice of it....\r\nSince the rebels quitting Perth, he (Argyle) has sent 500 or 600 of\r\nhis Argyleshire men, who go before the army a day’s march, to take\r\npossession of the towns the enemy have abandoned, and to plunder\r\nand destroy the country, which enrages our soldiers, who are forbid\r\nunder pain of death to take the value of a farthing, though out of\r\nthe rebels’ houses. Not one of these Argyle-men appeared whilst\r\nthe rebels were in Perth, and when they might have been of some\r\nuse.”--Cox’s _Marlborough_, vol. iii. p. 612.\r\n\r\n[737] _True Account of the Proceedings at Perth_, by a Rebel.\r\n\r\n[738] Mar’s _Journal_.\r\n\r\n[739] _True Account of the Proceedings at Perth._\r\n\r\n[740] _Annals of George I._, vol. ii. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[741] Mar’s _Journal_.\r\n\r\n[742] Dunning, Auchterarder, Blackford, Crieff, Muthil.\r\n\r\n[743] It is presumed this is the letter alluded to in a conversation\r\nbetween Lockhart of Carnwath and Captain Dougall Campbell, who is\r\nrepresented by him as “a person of great worth and loyalty, and a\r\nbosome friend of Argyle’s.” “Being with me (says Lockhart) at my\r\ncountry house, he (Campbell) asked me if I heard Argyle blam’d for\r\nhaving received and given no answer to a letter writt to him by the\r\nking whilst he was at Perth. I told him I had, but could not agree\r\nwith those who censured him, for I had such an abhorrence of breach\r\nof trust, that had I been the duke’s adviser, it should have been\r\nto doe as he did; for tho there was nothing I so much desired as\r\nto see him engaged in the king’s cause, I wisht it done in a way\r\nconsistent with his honour. Captain Campbell smiled and told me,\r\nhe was to acquaint me of a secret which he must previously have my\r\nsolemn word I would communicate to none, which he had given when it\r\nwas revealed to him, having however obtained liberty afterwards to\r\nspeak of it to me. After giving him the assurance he demanded, he\r\ntold me that the letter was not delivered to the duke, for in his\r\nlate Highland progress, he saw it and another to Lord Isla in the\r\nhands of the person to whose care they were committed, (but who that\r\nperson was he would not tell me), who receiving them unseal’d, did\r\nnot, after perusal, think it for the king’s service to deliver them,\r\nthat to the duke being writt in a style by no means to be approved\r\nof; ‘and, indeed,’ added Campbell, ‘when I read them, I was entirely\r\nof the same mind, and could not but think that Mar or some other\r\nperson, with a view of rather widening than healing the breaches,\r\nhad prevail’d with the king to write after that manner.’ The letter\r\nto Isla was writt as to a man of business, insisting on the unhappy\r\nstate of Scotland, and that nothing but a dissolution of the union\r\nby the king’s restoration, could prevent the utter ruin of that\r\ncountry. That to the duke did invite him to return to his loyalty\r\nand duty, threatening him, if he neglected, with revenge and the\r\nutter extirpation of his family, for what he and his predecessors had\r\ndone in this and the last century. I doe not pretend to narrate the\r\nprecise words of this letter, nor did Campbell mention them as such\r\nto me; however, I have narrated what he said was the aim and purport\r\nof the letter.”--_Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. pp. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n[744] What follows is in the Chevalier’s own handwriting. The\r\noriginal document is in the Fingask family; of course, it had never\r\nbeen delivered to the duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1716-1737.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGNS:--George I., 1714-1727.--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  Trial and execution of the prisoners taken in the\r\n  rebellion--Bills of attainder against the Earl of Mar and\r\n  others--Proceedings of General Cadogan in the Highlands--Trials\r\n  of the prisoners in Scotland--Act of grace--Removal of\r\n  the Chevalier from France--Duke of Argyle dismissed from\r\n  office--Continental affairs--Confederacy to restore the\r\n  Chevalier--Threatened Spanish invasion--Disarming of the\r\n  Highlanders--Means taken to prevent further disturbances by\r\n  building forts, making roads, &c.--Aversion of the Highlanders\r\n  to these innovations--The Chevalier appoints trustees to\r\n  manage his affairs in Scotland--Discovery of a new Jacobite\r\n  conspiracy--Habeas-corpus act suspended--Bolingbroke--Meeting\r\n  of Highland chiefs at Paris--The disarming act--Disgrace of the\r\n  Earl of Mar--His ambiguous conduct--Atterbury’s charges against\r\n  him--The Chevalier’s domestic affairs--Death of George I.--Views\r\n  of the Chevalier--Prospects of the Jacobites.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the flight and dispersion of the insurgents, the Duke of\r\nArgyle returned to Edinburgh about the end of February, where he was\r\nmagnificently entertained by the magistrates of the city, whence he\r\nset off for London on the 1st of March. He had left instructions with\r\nGeneral Cadogan to keep up a communication with the Whig leaders in\r\nthe north, and to distribute the troops in quarters contiguous to the\r\nadjoining Highlands, that they might be the more readily assembled to\r\nrepress any fresh insurrection which might break out. To keep some\r\nof the disaffected districts in check, parties of Highlanders were\r\nplaced by Lord Lovat and Brigadier Grant, in Brahan castle, and in\r\nErchles and Borlum; the former the seat of the Chisholm, the latter\r\nthat of Brigadier Mackintosh.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the prisoners taken at Preston remains now to be\r\ntold. The first who were tried were Lord Charles Murray, Captain\r\nDalziel, brother to the earl of Carnwath, Major Nairne, Captain\r\nPhilip Lockhart, brother to Lockhart of Carnwath, Captain Shaftoe,\r\nand Ensign Nairne. These six were tried before a court-martial at\r\nPreston, and all, with the exception of Captain Dalziel, having been\r\nproved to have been officers in the service of government, were\r\ncondemned to be shot. Lord Charles Murray received a pardon through\r\nthe interest of his friends. The remainder suffered on the 2d of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe English parliament met on the 9th of January, 1716. The commons\r\nagreed, on the motion of Mr. Lechmere, to impeach Lords Derwentwater,\r\nNithsdale, Wintoun, Carnwath, and Kenmure, of high treason. The\r\narticles of impeachment were carried up to the lords the same night,\r\nand on the next day these peers were brought to the bar of the house\r\nof lords to hear the articles of impeachment read. They were brought\r\nback from the Tower on the 19th, when they all pled guilty to the\r\ncharge of high treason, except the Earl of Wintoun, who petitioned\r\nfor a longer time to give in his answers. The rest received sentence\r\nof death on the 9th of February, in Westminster-hall. The Countess\r\nof Nithsdale and Lady Nairne surprised the king as he was passing\r\nthrough his apartments at St. James’s, and throwing themselves at\r\nhis feet implored his mercy in behalf of their husbands; but he\r\nturned away from them with contemptuous indifference. The Countess\r\nof Derwentwater was equally unsuccessful, though introduced by the\r\nDukes of Richmond and St. Albans into the king’s bed-chamber, and\r\naccompanied by the Duchesses of Cleveland and Bolton.\r\n\r\nThis refusal on the part of the king raised up a number of advocates\r\nin both houses of parliament, in behalf of the unfortunate noblemen.\r\nAvailing themselves of this feeling, the ladies of the condemned\r\nlords, accompanied by about twenty others of equal rank, waited in\r\nthe lobby of the house of peers, and at the door of the house of\r\ncommons, and solicited the intercession of both houses. Next day they\r\npetitioned the houses. The commons rejected the application, and to\r\nget quit of further importunity adjourned for six or seven days, by a\r\nsmall majority; but the result was different in the house of lords.\r\nPetitions, craving the intercession of that house, were presented\r\nfrom the condemned peers, which being read, after considerable\r\nopposition, a motion was made to address his majesty to grant them\r\na reprieve. This occasioned a warm debate; but before the vote was\r\ntaken, an amendment was proposed to the effect, that his majesty\r\nshould reprieve such of the peers as should seem to deserve his\r\nmercy. It was contended by the supporters of the original address,\r\nthat the effect of this amendment would be to destroy the nature\r\nof the address, as from the nature of the sentence which had been\r\npassed, none of the condemned peers could _deserve_ mercy; but the\r\namendment was substituted, and on the vote being taken, whether the\r\naddress should be presented, it was carried _present_, by a majority\r\nof five votes. It is said that on one of the peers afterwards\r\nobserving to the mover of the amendment, that it looked as if its\r\nobject was to defeat the vote, and make it of no use to the persons\r\nfor whose benefit it was intended, the proposer observed, that such\r\nwas his intention in moving it.[745]\r\n\r\nThe king was evidently chagrined at the conduct of the house, and\r\nwhen the address was presented, he informed the deputation, that on\r\nthis as on all other occasions, he would do what he thought most\r\nconsistent with the dignity of the crown, and the safety of his\r\npeople. The Earl of Nottingham, president of the council, who had\r\nsupported the petitions of the condemned lords, together with Lord\r\nAylesford, his brother, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord\r\nFinch, his son, one of the lords of the treasury, and Lord Guernsey,\r\nmaster of the jewel office, were all removed from office; and to show\r\nthe determination of the king, orders were issued on the same day the\r\naddress was delivered, for executing the Earls of Derwentwater and\r\nNithsdale, and Viscount Kenmure the following day. The other three\r\npeers were reprieved to the 7th of March. The Earl of Nithsdale, by\r\nthe assistance of his heroic wife, made his escape the night before\r\nthe execution, dressed in female attire. When the king heard of his\r\nescape next morning, he observed, that “it was the best thing a man\r\nin his condition could have done.”[746]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 24th of February the Earl of Derwentwater\r\nand Viscount Kenmure were beheaded on Tower-hill. On ascending the\r\nscaffold, Derwentwater knelt down, and having spent some time in\r\nprayer, he got up, and drawing a paper out of his pocket, read a\r\nshort address. He hoped for forgiveness through the passion and death\r\nof his Saviour; apologised to those who might have been scandalized\r\nat his pleading guilty at his trial, excusing himself for doing\r\nso on the ground that he was made to believe that it was only a\r\nconsequence of having submitted to mercy, acknowledged as his only\r\nright and lawful sovereign, King James III., and earnestly hoped for\r\nhis speedy restoration; and died, as he had lived, a Roman Catholic.\r\nHe displayed the utmost coolness and perfect self-possession.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the remains of the Earl of Derwentwater were removed,\r\nViscount Kenmure was brought up to the scaffold. Like Derwentwater,\r\nhe expressed his regret for pleading guilty to the charge of high\r\ntreason, and prayed for “King James.” After praying a short time with\r\nuplifted hands, he advanced to the fatal block, and laying down his\r\nhead, the executioner struck it off at two blows.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Wintoun, on various frivolous pretences, got his trial\r\npostponed till the 15th of March, when he was brought finally up,\r\nand, after a trial which occupied two days, was found guilty, and\r\nreceived sentence of death; but his lordship afterwards made his\r\nescape from the Tower and fled to France.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April a commission for trying the other rebels met in\r\nthe court of Common Pleas, Westminster, when bills of high treason\r\nwere found against Mr. Forster, Brigadier Mackintosh, Colonel\r\nOxburgh, Mr. Menzies of Culdares, and seven of their associates, and\r\non the 10th bills were found against eleven more. Forster escaped\r\nfrom Newgate, and so well had his friends concerted matters, that\r\nhe reached Calais in less than 24 hours. The trials of Brigadier\r\nMackintosh and others were fixed for the 4th of May, but about\r\neleven o’clock the preceding night, the brigadier and fifteen other\r\nprisoners broke out of Newgate, after knocking down the keepers and\r\ndisarming the sentinels. Eight were retaken, but Mackintosh and\r\nseven others escaped. The trials of the prisoners who remained\r\nproceeded: many of them were found guilty; and five, among whom were\r\nColonel Oxburgh and Mr. Paul, a non-jurant clergyman of the Church of\r\nEngland, were executed at Tyburn. Twenty-two prisoners were executed\r\nin Lancashire. The remainder of the prisoners taken at Preston,\r\namounting to upwards of 700, submitted to the king’s mercy, and\r\nhaving prayed for transportation, were sold as slaves to some West\r\nIndia merchants; a cruel proceeding, when it is considered that the\r\ngreater part of these men were Highlanders, who had joined in the\r\ninsurrection in obedience to the commands of their chiefs.[747]\r\n\r\nThe severities exercised by the government, and the courage and\r\nfortitude displayed by the unfortunate sufferers, wrought an\r\nextraordinary change in the dispositions of the people, who began\r\nto manifest great dissatisfaction at proceedings so revolting to\r\nhumanity. Though the rebellion was extinguished, the spirit which had\r\nanimated it still remained, being increased rather than diminished\r\nby the proceedings of the government; and the Tories longed for an\r\nopportunity of availing themselves of the universal dissatisfaction\r\nto secure a majority favourable to their views at the next general\r\nelection. The Whigs, afraid of the result of an early election as\r\ndestructive to themselves as a party and to the liberties of the\r\ncountry, had recourse to a bold measure, which nothing but the most\r\nurgent necessity could justify. This was no other than a plan to\r\nrepeal the triennial act, and to prolong the duration of parliament.\r\nIt is said that at first they intended to suspend the triennial act\r\nfor one election only, but thinking that a temporary measure would\r\nappear a greater violation of constitutional law than a permanent\r\none, they resolved to extend the duration of parliament to seven\r\nyears. A bill was accordingly brought into the house of lords on the\r\n10th of April by the Duke of Devonshire, which, notwithstanding much\r\nopposition, passed both houses, receiving the royal assent on the\r\n7th of May. On the same day an act of attainder against the Earls\r\nMarischal, Seaforth, Southesk, Panmure, and others, also received\r\nhis majesty’s sanction. An act of attainder against the Earl of Mar,\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine, the Earl of Linlithgow, Lord Drummond,\r\nand other leaders of the insurrection, had received the royal assent\r\non the 17th of February preceding. Besides these bills, three others\r\nwere passed, one attainting Mr. Forster and Brigadier Mackintosh;\r\nanother for more effectually securing the peace of the Highlands; a\r\nthird appointing commissioners to inquire into the estates of those\r\npersons who had been attainted or convicted.\r\n\r\nWhile the parliament was thus engaged in devising measures for\r\nmaintaining the public tranquillity, General Cadogan was employed in\r\ndispersing some hostile bands of the clans which still continued to\r\nassemble with their chiefs in the remoter parts of the Highlands.\r\nHearing that the Earl of Seaforth had retired into the island of\r\nLewis, where he had collected a considerable body of his men under\r\nthe command of Brigadier Campbell of Ormundel, an officer who had\r\njust arrived from Muscovy, where he had served in the army of the\r\nCzar, he sent a detachment into the island under the command of\r\nColonel Cholmondely to reduce it. The earl, on the appearance of this\r\nforce, crossed into Ross-shire, whence he escaped to France; and\r\nCampbell being abandoned by his men after he had formed them in order\r\nof battle, was taken prisoner while standing in a charging posture.\r\nAnother detachment under Colonel Clayton, was sent into the isle\r\nof Skye, where Sir Donald Macdonald was at the head of about 1,000\r\nmen; but the chief made no resistance, and having no assurance of\r\nprotection from the government in case of a surrender, retired into\r\none of the Uists, where he remained till he obtained a ship which\r\ncarried him to France. About this time three ships arrived among the\r\nwestern islands from France with military supplies for the use of the\r\ninsurgents, but they came too late to be of any service. Two of them,\r\nafter taking 70 gentlemen on board, immediately returned to France,\r\nand the third, which carried fifty chests of small arms, and one\r\nhundred and fifty barrels of gunpowder, and other military stores,\r\nwas captured while at anchor near Uist by an English ship of war.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of instructions from government, General Cadogan\r\nissued an order, which was intimated at the different parish churches\r\nin the north, requiring the rebels to surrender themselves and to\r\ndeliver up their arms, assuring them, that such as complied should\r\nhave liberty granted to return home in safety, but threatening\r\nto punish rigorously those who refused to comply. This order was\r\ngenerally obeyed by the common people in the Lowlands, who had been\r\nengaged in the insurrection; but few of the Highlanders seemed to\r\nregard it. To enforce compliance, Cadogan despatched different\r\ndetachments through the Highlands, and took up his quarters at Blair\r\nAthole, where he could more easily communicate with the disaffected\r\ndistricts. He next removed to Ruthven in Badenoch, and afterwards\r\nproceeded to Inverness, where he received Glengary’s submission.\r\nLochiel, Keppoch, and Clanranald, had resolved to oppose by force the\r\ndelivery of their arms; but on hearing that Clayton, who had returned\r\nfrom Skye, had resolved to march from Fortwilliam to Lochiel’s house\r\nto disarm the Camerons, these chiefs retired, and their men delivered\r\nup their arms without resistance. Having succeeded in disarming the\r\nHighlands, the general left Inverness on the 27th of April, leaving\r\nGeneral Sabine in command, and proceeded to London. The rebellion\r\nbeing now considered completely extinguished, the Dutch auxiliaries\r\nwere withdrawn from Scotland, and in a short time thereafter were\r\nembarked for Holland.\r\n\r\nTo try the prisoners confined in the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling,\r\nBlackness, and other places in Scotland, a commission of Oyer and\r\nTerminer was appointed to sit at Carlisle in December, 1716. There\r\nwere nearly seventy arraigned. Of twenty-nine who were brought to\r\ntrial, twenty-five pled guilty. Brigadier Campbell of Ormundel,\r\nTulloch of Tannachie, Stewart of Foss, and Stewart of Glenbuckie,\r\nentered a plea of not guilty. The two last having satisfied the\r\nsolicitor-general of their innocence, he allowed a writ of _noli\r\nprosequi_ to be entered in their behalf, and Campbell having escaped\r\nfrom the castle of Carlisle, Tulloch alone stood his trial, but he\r\nwas acquitted. Sentence of death was passed upon the twenty-five who\r\nhad admitted their guilt, and thirty-six were discharged for want of\r\nevidence; but the sentence of death was never put into execution. It\r\nwas wise in the government to pacify the national disaffection by\r\nshowing mercy.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the same humane view, an act of grace was passed in\r\n1717 by the king and both houses of parliament, granting a free and\r\ngeneral pardon to all persons who had committed any treasonable\r\noffences, before the 6th of May of that year, with the exception of\r\nthose who, having committed such offences, had gone beyond the seas,\r\nand who, before the said day, had returned into Great Britain or\r\nIreland without his majesty’s license, or who should on or after the\r\nsaid day return into either of the kingdoms without such license.\r\nAll persons of the name and clan of Macgregor were also excepted,\r\nas well as all such persons as should, on the 5th of May, 1717,\r\nremain attainted for high treason. But all such persons so attainted,\r\nunless specially named, and who had not escaped out of prison, were\r\nfreely pardoned and discharged. Under this act the Earl of Carnwath,\r\nand Lords Widdrington and Nairne, were delivered from the Tower:\r\nseventeen persons confined in Newgate, the prisoners still remaining\r\nin the castles of Lancaster and Carlisle, and those in the castles of\r\nEdinburgh and Stirling, and other places in Scotland, including Lords\r\nStrathallan and Rollo, were likewise released.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chevalier was preparing to embark for Scotland, the Earl\r\nof Stair, (the ambassador at the court of France,) had used every\r\neffort to prevent him. Duclos and others say that Stair not only\r\napplied to the Duke of Orleans, the regent, to have the Chevalier\r\narrested, but that finding the regent insincere in his promises of\r\ncompliance, he sent persons to assassinate the Chevalier on the road\r\nwhen crossing France to embark for Scotland. That Stair made such an\r\napplication, and that he employed spies to watch the progress of the\r\nprince, are circumstances highly probable; but both Marshal Berwick\r\nand the Earl of Mar discredited the last part of the story, as they\r\nconsidered Stair incapable of ordering an action so atrocious as the\r\nassassination of the prince.[748]\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Chevalier, Stair, afraid that he and his\r\npartisans in France would intrigue with the court, presented a\r\nmemorial to the regent in name of his Britannic majesty, in which,\r\nafter notifying the flight of the Chevalier, and the dispersion of\r\nhis forces, he requested the regent to compel the prince to quit\r\nFrance. He next insisted that such of the rebels as had retired to\r\nFrance should be ordered forthwith to depart from that country. The\r\nremoval of the Jacobite exiles from the French court was all that\r\nthe earl could at that time obtain from the regent. By an agreement,\r\nhowever, which was shortly thereafter entered into between France\r\nand England, mutually guaranteeing the succession to the crown of\r\nFrance, and the Hanover succession according to the provisions of\r\nthe treaty of Utrecht, it was stipulated that the Pretender should\r\nbe sent beyond the Alps, and should never be allowed to return again\r\nto France or Lorraine on any pretence whatever, and that none of the\r\nrebellious subjects of Great Britain should be allowed to reside in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the insurrection, the leading supporters of\r\ngovernment in Scotland repaired to London to congratulate George I.\r\non the success of his arms, and to obtain the rewards they expected.\r\nThe Duke of Argyle, to whose exertions chiefly the king was indebted\r\nfor his peaceable accession to the throne, and the extinction of\r\nthe rebellion, was already so overloaded with favours that he could\r\nscarcely expect any addition to be made to them, and would probably\r\nhave been contented with those he had obtained. The “squadron” party,\r\nhowever, which had been long endeavouring to ruin him, now made every\r\nexertion to get him disgraced; and being assisted by the Marlborough\r\nfaction, and a party which espoused the interests of Cadogan, they\r\nsucceeded with the king, who dismissed the duke and his brother,\r\nthe Earl of Islay, from all their employments, which were conferred\r\non others. General Carpenter, to whom the success at Preston was\r\nentirely ascribed, succeeded Argyle in the chief command of the\r\nforces in North Britain; and the Duke of Montrose was appointed\r\nLord-Register of Scotland in the room of the Earl of Islay.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of affairs in the north of Europe requiring the king’s\r\npresence in his German dominions, an act was passed repealing the\r\nclause in the act for the further limitation of the crown, which\r\nrestricted the sovereign from leaving his British dominions. He\r\nclosed the session on the 26th of June, and embarked at Gravesend\r\non the 7th of July for Holland, where he arrived on the 9th. He\r\nproceeded to Loo incognito, and thence set out for Pyrmont.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which need not be stated here, Alberoni, the Spanish\r\nprime minister, was eager that Great Britain should enter upon an\r\nalliance with his country, and in his appeal to George I. he was\r\nbacked by the English minister at Madrid. George thus found himself\r\nplaced in a singular but fortunate situation. Equally courted by\r\nFrance and Spain, he had only to choose between them, and to form\r\nthat connexion which might be most conducive to uphold the Protestant\r\nsuccession and to maintain the peace of Europe, with which the\r\ninternal peace of Great Britain and the safety of the reigning family\r\nwere intimately connected. The alliance with France being considered\r\nas more likely to secure these advantages than a connexion with\r\nSpain, the English minister at Madrid was instructed by the cabinet\r\nat home to decline the offers of Spain. “His majesty,” said secretary\r\nStanhope, in his letter to the minister, “is perfectly disposed to\r\nenter into a new treaty with the Catholic king, to renew and confirm\r\nthe past; but the actual situation of affairs does not permit him to\r\nform other engagements, which, far from contributing to preserve the\r\nneutrality of Italy, would give rise to jealousies tending to disturb\r\nit.”[749]\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the agreement with France, to which allusion\r\nhas been made, and in January, 1717, a triple alliance was entered\r\ninto between England, France, and Holland, by which the contracting\r\nparties mutually guaranteed to one another the possession of all\r\nplaces respectively held by them. The treaty also contained a\r\nguaranty of the Protestant succession on the throne of England, as\r\nwell as that of the Duke of Orleans to the crown of France.\r\n\r\nBaffled in all his attempts to draw England into an alliance against\r\nthe Emperor of Austria, Alberoni looked to the north, where he hoped\r\nto find allies in the persons of the King of Sweden and the Czar of\r\nMuscovy. Both Peter the Great and Charles XII. were highly incensed\r\nagainst the Elector of Hanover, the former for resisting the attempts\r\nof Russia to obtain a footing in the empire, the latter for having\r\njoined the confederacy formed against him during his captivity, and\r\nfor having accepted from the King of Denmark the duchies of Bremen\r\nand Verden, Swedish possessions, which had been conquered by Denmark\r\nduring the absence of Charles. Charles, to revenge himself, formed\r\nthe design of restoring the Stuarts, and by his instructions, Goertz,\r\nhis minister in England, began to cabal with the English Jacobites,\r\nto whom, in name of his master, he promised to grant assistance in\r\nany efforts they might make to rid themselves of the elector. It was\r\nwhispered among the Scottish Jacobites, that “the king,” as they\r\ntermed the Chevalier, had some hopes of prevailing on Charles to\r\nespouse his cause, but the first notice on which they could place any\r\nreliance was a letter from the Earl of Mar to one Captain Straiton,\r\nwhich he directed to be communicated to the Bishop of Edinburgh, Lord\r\nBalmerino, and Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, and in which he suggested,\r\nthat as there was a great scarcity in Sweden, the friends of the\r\nChevalier should purchase and send 5,000 or 6,000 bolls of meal\r\nto that country. Their poverty, however, and the impracticability\r\nof collecting and sending such a large quantity of food out of\r\nthe kingdom, without exciting the suspicions of the government,\r\nprevented the plan from being carried into execution.[750] Shortly\r\nthereafter, Straiton received another letter from Mar, in which,\r\nafter stating that there was a design to attempt the restoration of\r\nthe prince by the aid of a certain foreign sovereign, and that it\r\nwould look strange if his friends at home did not put themselves in\r\na condition to assist him, he suggested, that as the want of money\r\nhad been hitherto a great impediment in the way of the Chevalier’s\r\nsuccess, the persons to whom this and his first letter were to be\r\ncommunicated, should persuade their friends to have in readiness\r\nsuch money as they could procure, to be employed when the proper\r\nopportunity offered. Mr. Lockhart, who received a letter from the\r\nChevalier at the same time, undertook the task of acquainting the\r\nChevalier’s friends in Scotland with Mar’s wish, and obtained\r\nassurances from several persons of rank that they would attend to the\r\nprince’s request. Lord Eglinton in particular made an offer of 3,000\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nThe intrigues of Goertz, the Swedish minister, being discovered by\r\nthe government, he was arrested and his papers seized at the desire\r\nof King George. This extraordinary proceeding, against which the\r\nforeign ministers resident at the British court remonstrated, roused\r\nthe indignation of Charles to the highest pitch, and being now more\r\ndetermined than ever to carry his project into effect, he, at the\r\ninstigation of Alberoni, reconciled himself to the Czar, who, in\r\nresentment of an offer made by King George to Charles to join against\r\nRussia, if the latter would ratify the cession of Bremen and Verden,\r\nagreed to unite his forces with those of Sweden and Spain for placing\r\nthe Pretender on the throne of England. To strengthen the interest\r\nof the Chevalier in the north, Alberoni sent the Duke of Ormond into\r\nRussia to negotiate a marriage between the son of the Chevalier, and\r\nAnne the daughter of Peter, but this project did not take effect.\r\nThe Chevalier himself, in the meantime, contracted a marriage with\r\nthe Princess Clementina Sobieski, but she was arrested at Inspruck\r\nby order of the imperial government, when on her journey to meet her\r\nbetrothed husband, and sent to a convent.\r\n\r\nKing George returned to England towards the end of January, 1717.\r\nThe parliament met on the 20th of February, when he informed them\r\nof the projected invasion, and mentioned that he had given orders\r\nfor laying copies of papers connected therewith before them. From\r\nthese documents it appeared, that the plan of invasion was ripe for\r\nexecution, but that it was not intended to attempt it till the Dutch\r\nauxiliaries should be sent back to Holland.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the conduct of his Swedish majesty, parliament\r\npassed a bill prohibiting all intercourse with Sweden, and a fleet\r\nwas despatched to the Baltic under the command of Sir George Byng,\r\nto observe the motions of the Swedes; but the death of Charles XII.\r\ndissolved the confederacy between Sweden and Russia.\r\n\r\nWar was declared against Spain in December 1718; but a respectable\r\nminority in parliament, and the nation at large, were opposed to it,\r\nas hurtful to the commercial interests of Great Britain. France also\r\nfollowed the same course.\r\n\r\nThe war with Spain revived the hopes of the Jacobites, and the\r\nDuke of Ormond repaired to Madrid, where he held conferences with\r\nAlberoni, and concerted an invasion of Great Britain. The Dutch,\r\nalarmed at Ormond’s appearance at Madrid, remonstrated with Alberoni,\r\nas they had guaranteed the Protestant succession, which might be\r\nendangered if an insurrection in favour of the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge was encouraged by Spain; but the cardinal assured them that\r\nthe duke had no other design in coming into Spain but to consult\r\nhis personal safety. Meanwhile, under the pretence of sending\r\nreinforcements into Sicily, preparations were made at Cadiz and in\r\nthe ports of Galicia for the projected invasion, and the Chevalier\r\nhimself proceeded to Madrid, where he was cordially received and\r\ntreated as King of Great Britain. On the 10th of March, 1719, a\r\nfleet, consisting of ten men-of-war and twenty-one transports, having\r\non board 5,000 men, a great quantity of ammunition, and 30,000\r\nmuskets, sailed from Cadiz, with instructions to join the rest of the\r\nexpedition at Corunna, and to make a descent at once upon England and\r\nIreland. The Duke of Ormond was appointed commander of the fleet,\r\nwith the title of Captain-general of his most Catholic Majesty; and\r\nhe was provided with declarations in the name of the king, stating,\r\nthat for many good reasons he had sent forces into England and\r\nScotland to act as auxiliaries to King James.\r\n\r\nTo defeat this attempt the allied cabinets adopted the necessary\r\nmeasures. His Britannic majesty having communicated to both houses\r\nof parliament the advices he had received respecting the projected\r\ninvasion, they gave him every assurance of support, and requested\r\nhim to augment his forces by sea and land. He offered a reward of\r\n£10,000 to any one who should apprehend the Duke of Ormond. Troops\r\nwere ordered to assemble in the north and west of England, and a\r\nstrong squadron, under Admiral Norris, was equipped and sent out to\r\nsea to meet the Spanish fleet. The Dutch furnished 2,000 men, and six\r\nbattalions of Imperialists were sent from the Austrian Netherlands;\r\nand the Duke of Orleans ordered ships to be prepared at Brest to join\r\nthe English fleet, and made an offer of twenty battalions for the\r\nservice of King George.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under Ormond, with the exception of two frigates,\r\nnever reached its destination, having been dispersed and disabled,\r\noff Cape Finisterre, by a violent storm which lasted twelve days.\r\nThese two ships reached the coast of Scotland, having on board the\r\nEarls Marischal and Seaforth, the Marquis of Tullibardine, some field\r\nofficers, 300 Spaniards, and arms for 2,000 men. The expedition\r\nentered Loch Alsh about the middle of May, and the small force landed\r\nin the western Highlands, when it was joined by some Highlanders,\r\nchiefly Seaforth’s men. The other Jacobite clans, with the\r\ndisappointment they formerly experienced from France still fresh in\r\ntheir recollection, resolved not to move till the whole forces under\r\nOrmond should arrive. A difference arose between the Earl Marischal\r\nand the Marquis of Tullibardine about the command, but this dispute\r\nwas put an end to by the advance of General Wightman from Inverness,\r\nwith a body of regular troops. The Highlanders and their allies had\r\ntaken possession of the pass at Glenshiel; but on the approach of\r\nthe government forces they retired to the pass at Strachell, which\r\nthey resolved to defend. General Wightman attacked and drove them,\r\nafter a smart action of three hours’ duration, and after sustaining\r\nsome loss, from one eminence to another, when night put an end to\r\nthe combat. The Highlanders seeing no chance of making a successful\r\nresistance, dispersed, during the night, among the mountains, and the\r\nSpaniards, on the following day, surrendered themselves prisoners\r\nof war. Marischal, Seaforth, and Tullibardine, with the other\r\nofficers, retired to the Western Isles, and managed to escape to the\r\ncontinent.[751]\r\n\r\nAfter government had succeeded in putting an end to the rebellion,\r\nit felt the necessity of doing something, not only to allay the\r\nconsequent disorders in the Highlands, but also to render the\r\nHighlanders less capable in future of entering into rebellion, and\r\nmake them more accessible to the strong arm of the law. The estates\r\nof most of the chiefs and proprietors who had been engaged were\r\nforfeited, although practically in some cases it was found difficult\r\nto carry the forfeiture into effect; as in the case of the Earl of\r\nSeaforth, one of whose retainers seized the office of receiver, and\r\ntransmitted the rents to the exiled earl.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat, who, on account of his loyal conduct, had risen high\r\nin the royal favour, drew up, in 1721, a memorial to George I.\r\nconcerning the state of the Highlands, characterised by great insight\r\ninto the source of the existing evils, and recommending to government\r\nthe adoption of measures calculated to remedy these.\r\n\r\nFrom this memorial we learn that King William, possibly in accordance\r\nwith the recommendation of Breadalbane, formerly referred to, had\r\norganized a few independent Highland companies, which appear to have\r\nbeen of some service in repressing the disorders so prevalent in the\r\nnorth.[752] “The independent companies, raised by King William not\r\nlong after the revolution, reduced the Highlanders to better order\r\nthan at any time they had been in since the restoration. They were\r\ncomposed of the natives of the country, inured to the fatigue of\r\ntravelling the mountains, lying on the hills, wore the same habit,\r\nand spoke the same language; but for want of being put under proper\r\nregulations, corruptions were introduced, and some, who commanded\r\nthem, instead of bringing criminals to justice, (as I am informed)\r\noften compounded for the theft, and, for a sum of money set them at\r\nliberty. They are said also to have defrauded the government by\r\nkeeping not above half their numbers in constant pay, which (as I\r\nhumbly conceive) might be the reason your majesty caused them to be\r\ndisbanded.”[753]\r\n\r\nThese companies being broken up in 1717, according to Lovat and Wade,\r\nrobberies went on “without any manner of fear or restraint, and have\r\never since continued to infest the country in a public and open\r\nmanner.”[754]\r\n\r\nWade entered upon his investigation in 1724, and his report shows\r\nhe was competent to undertake such a task. He computed that of\r\nthe 22,000 Highlandmen able to bear arms, 10,000 were “vassals to\r\nsuperiors,” well affected to government, and the remainder had been\r\nengaged in rebellions, and were ready, when called upon by their\r\nchiefs, “to create new troubles.” One of the greatest grievances was\r\nthe robberies referred to by Lovat, accompanied with the levying of\r\n_black mail_. According to the general, “the clans, in the Highlands,\r\nthe most addicted to rapine and plunder, are the Camerons, on the\r\nwest of the shire of Inverness; the Mackenzies and others, in the\r\nshire of Ross, who were vassals to the late Earl of Seaforth; the\r\nM’Donalds of Keppoch; the Broadalbin men and the M’Gregors, on the\r\nborders of Argileshire. They go out in parties from ten to thirty\r\nmen, traverse large tracks of mountains, till they arrive at the low\r\nlands, where they design to commit their depredations, which they\r\nchoose to do in places distant from the glens which they inhabit.\r\nThey drive the stolen cattle in the night time, and in the day\r\nremain on the tops of the mountains or in the woods, (with which the\r\nHighlands abound), and take the first occasion to sell them at the\r\nfairs or markets that are annually held in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\n“Those who are robbed of their cattle (or persons employed by them),\r\nfollow them by the tract, and often recover them from the robbers, by\r\ncompounding for a certain sum of money agreed on; but if the pursuers\r\nare in numbers superiour to the thieves, and happen to seize any of\r\nthem, they are seldom or never prosecuted, the poorer sort being\r\nunable to support the charges of a prosecution. They are likewise\r\nunder the apprehension of becoming the object of their revenge,\r\nby having their houses and stacks burnt, their cattle stolen, or\r\nhocked, and their lives at the mercy of the tribe or clan to whom the\r\nbanditti belongs. The richer sort, to keep, as they call it, good\r\nneighbourhood, generally compound with the chieftain of the tribe or\r\nclan for double restitution, which he willingly pays to save one of\r\nhis clan from prosecution; and this is repaid him by a contribution\r\nfrom the thieves of his clan, who never refuse the payment of their\r\nproportion to save one of their own fraternity. This composition is\r\nseldom paid in money, but in cattle stolen from the opposite side of\r\nthe country, to make reparation to the person injured.”[755]\r\n\r\nTo remedy these evils, an act for the disarming of the Highlanders\r\nwas passed in the year 1716, but it was so badly put into force\r\nthat the most disaffected clans remained better armed than ever. By\r\nthe act, the collectors of taxes were empowered to pay for the arms\r\ndelivered up; but none were given in except such as were broken and\r\nunfit for use, which were valued at a price far beyond what they were\r\nworth. Not only so, but a brisk trade appears to have been carried on\r\nwith Holland and other countries in broken and useless arms, which\r\nwere imported and delivered up to the commissioners at exorbitant\r\nprices. Wade also found in the possession of the Highlanders a great\r\nnumber of arms which they had obtained from the Spaniards engaged in\r\nthe affair at Glen Shiel. Altogether he computed that the Highlanders\r\nhostile to his majesty were in possession of about five or six\r\nthousand arms of various kinds. Wade further reports that to keep\r\nthe Highlanders in awe, “four barracks had been built in different\r\nparts of the Highlands, and parties of regular troops, under the\r\ncommand of Highland officers, with a company of 30, established to\r\nconduct them through the mountains, was thought an effectual scheme,\r\nas well to prevent the rising of the Highlanders disaffected to your\r\nmajesty’s government, as to hinder depredations on your faithful\r\nsubjects. It is to be wished that, during the reign of your majesty\r\nand your successors, no insurrection may ever happen to experience\r\nwhether the barracks will effectually answer the end proposed;\r\nyet I am humbly of opinion, that if the number of troops they are\r\nbuilt to contain were constantly quartered in them (whereas there\r\nis now in some but 30 men, and proper provisions laid in for their\r\nsupport during the winter season), they might be of some use to\r\nprevent the insurrections of the Highlanders, though, as I humbly\r\nconceive (having seen them all), that two of the four are not built\r\nin as proper situations as they might have been. As to the Highland\r\nparties, I have already presumed to represent to your majesty the\r\nlittle use they were of in hindering depredations, and the great\r\nsufferings of the soldiers employed in that service, upon which your\r\nmajesty was graciously pleased to countermand them.\r\n\r\n“I must farther beg leave to report to your majesty, that another\r\ngreat cause of disorders in the Highlands is the want of proper\r\npersons to execute the several offices of civil magistrates,\r\nespecially in the shires of Inverness, Ross, and some other parts of\r\nthe Highlands.\r\n\r\n“The party quarrels and violent animosities among the gentlemen\r\nequally well affected to your majesty’s government, I humbly conceive\r\nto be one great cause of this defect. Those here in arms for your\r\nmajesty, who raised a spirit in the shire of Inverness, and recovered\r\nthe town of that name from the rebels (their main body being then\r\nat Perth), complain that the persons employed as magistrates over\r\nthem have little interest in the country, and that three of the\r\ndeputy sheriffs in those parts were persons actually in arms against\r\nyour majesty at the time of the rebellion, which (as I am credibly\r\ninformed) is true. They likewise complain that many are left out of\r\nthe commissions of lord lieutenants, deputy lieutenants, sheriffs,\r\n&c., and I take the liberty to observe, that the want of acting\r\njustices of the peace is a great encouragement to the disorders so\r\nfrequently committed in that part of the country, there being but one\r\nnow residing as an acting justice for the space of above an hundred\r\nmiles in compass.”[756]\r\n\r\nHe also complained that the regular troops laboured under great\r\ndisadvantages in endeavouring to penetrate in the Highland fastnesses\r\nfrom the want of roads and bridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fort Augustus.]\r\n\r\nAs a remedy for these evils he proposed “that companies of such\r\nHighlanders as are well affected to his majesty’s government be\r\nestablished under proper regulations, and commanded by officers\r\nspeaking the language of the country, subject to martial law, and\r\nunder the inspection and orders of the governors of Fort-William,\r\nInverness, and the officer commanding his majesty’s forces in those\r\nparts;”[757] that a redoubt or barrack be erected at Inverness, and\r\nan addition be made to the one already established at Killyhuimen\r\n(Fort Augustus), at the south end of Loch Ness, and that a small\r\nvessel, with oars and sails, be built on the loch, capable of holding\r\nfrom sixty to eighty soldiers, which would be a means of keeping up\r\ncommunication between Inverness and Fort Augustus, and of sending\r\nparties to the county bordering on the lake. Further, that the\r\ndifferent garrisons and castles in North Britain, especially the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh, be put in such condition as to guard against\r\nsurprise, and that a regiment of dragoons be quartered in the\r\ndistrict between Perth and Inverness. As to the civil government\r\nof the country, Wade recommended that proper persons be nominated\r\nfor sheriffs and deputy sheriffs in the Highland counties, and\r\nthat justices of the peace and constables, with small salaries, be\r\nestablished in proper places, and that quarter sessions be regularly\r\nheld at Killyhuimen, Ruthven in Badenoch, Fort William, and if\r\nnecessary, at Bernera, near the coast of the Isle of Skye.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed in 1725, Wade was empowered to proceed to the\r\nHighlands and summon the clans to deliver up their arms, and to\r\ncarry most of his other recommendations into effect. After quelling\r\nthe malt-tax riots in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Wade set out for the\r\nHighlands, and arrived in Inverness on the 10th of August 1725,\r\nand immediately proceeded to business. As his report contains much\r\ninteresting and valuable information on the state of the Highlands\r\nat this time, we shall give here a large extract from it.\r\n\r\n  “The laird of the M’Kenzies, and other chiefs of the clans and\r\n  tribes, tenants to the late Earl of Seaforth, came to me in a body,\r\n  to the number of about fifty, and assured me that both they and their\r\n  followers were ready to pay a dutiful obedience to your majesty’s\r\n  commands, by a peaceable surrender of their arms; that if your\r\n  majesty would be graciously pleased to procure them an indemnity for\r\n  the rents that had been misapplied for the time past, they would\r\n  for the future become faithful subjects to your majesty, and pay\r\n  them to your majesty’s receiver for the use of the public. I assured\r\n  them of your majesty’s gracious intentions towards them, and that\r\n  they might rely on your majesty’s bounty and clemency, provided they\r\n  would merit it by their future good conduct and peaceable behaviour;\r\n  that I had your majesty’s commands to send the first summons to the\r\n  country they inhabited; which would soon give them an opportunity of\r\n  showing the sincerity of their promises, and of having the merit to\r\n  set example to the rest of the Highlands, who in their turns were\r\n  to be summoned to deliver up their arms, pursuant to the disarming\r\n  act; that they might choose the place they themselves thought most\r\n  convenient to surrender their arms; and that I would answer, that\r\n  neither their persons nor their property should be molested by your\r\n  majesty’s troops.--They desired they might be permitted to deliver\r\n  up their arms at the castle of Brahan, the principal seat of their\r\n  late superior, who, they said, had promoted and encouraged them to\r\n  this their submission; but begged that none of the Highland companies\r\n  might be present; for, as they had always been reputed the bravest,\r\n  as well as the most numerous of the northern clans, they thought\r\n  it more consistent with their honour to resign their arms to your\r\n  majesty’s veteran troops;--to which I readily consented.\r\n\r\n  “Summonses were accordingly sent to the several clans and tribes,\r\n  the inhabitants of 18 parishes, who were vassals or tenants of the\r\n  late Earl of Seaforth, to bring or send in all their arms and warlike\r\n  weapons to the castle of Brahan, on or before the 28th of August.\r\n\r\n  “On the 25th of August I went to the castle of Brahan, with a\r\n  detachment of 200 of the regular troops, and was met there by the\r\n  chiefs of the several clans and tribes, who assured me they had used\r\n  their utmost diligence in collecting all the arms they were possessed\r\n  of, which should be brought thither on the Saturday following,\r\n  pursuant to the summons they had received; and telling me they were\r\n  apprehensive of insults or depredations from the neighbouring clans\r\n  of the Camerons, and others who still continued in possession of\r\n  their arms. Parties of the Highland companies were ordered to guard\r\n  the passes leading to their country; which parties continued there\r\n  for their protection, till the clans in that neighbourhood were\r\n  summoned, and had surrendered their arms.\r\n\r\n  “On the day appointed, the several clans and tribes assembled in the\r\n  adjacent villages, and marched in good order through the great avenue\r\n  that leads to the castle; and one after another laid down their arms\r\n  in the court-yard, in great quiet and decency, amounting to 784 of\r\n  the several species mentioned in the act of parliament.\r\n\r\n  “The solemnity with which this was performed, had undoubtedly a great\r\n  influence over the rest of the Highland clans; and disposed them\r\n  to pay that obedience to your majesty’s commands, by a peaceable\r\n  surrender of their arms, which they had never done to any of your\r\n  royal predecessors, or in compliance with any law either before or\r\n  since the Union.\r\n\r\n  “The next summons were sent to the clans and countries in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Killyhuimen and Fort William. The arms of the\r\n  several clans of the M’Donalds of Glengary, M’Leods of Glenelg,\r\n  Chisholms of Strathglass, and Grants of Glenmoriston, were\r\n  surrendered to me at the barrack of Killyhuimen, the 15th of\r\n  September; and those of the M’Donalds of Keppoch, Moidart, Aresaig,\r\n  and Glencoe; as also the Camerons, and Stewarts of Appin, were\r\n  delivered to the governor of Fort William. The M’Intoshes were\r\n  summoned, and brought in their arms to Inverness; and the followers\r\n  of the Duke of Gordon, with the clan of M’Phersons, to the barrack of\r\n  Ruthven in Badenoch.\r\n\r\n  “The inhabitants of the isles of Skye and Mull were also summoned;\r\n  the M’Donalds, M’Kinnons, and M’Leods delivered their arms at the\r\n  barrack of Bernera; and those of the Isle of Mull, to the officer\r\n  commanding at Castle Duart, both on the 1st day of October.\r\n\r\n  “The regiments remained till that time encamped at Inverness; and\r\n  this service was performed by sending detachments from the camp to\r\n  the several parts of the Highlands appointed for the surrender of\r\n  arms. Ammunition bread was regularly delivered to the soldiers, and\r\n  biscuits to the detachments that were sent into the mountains. The\r\n  camp was plentifully supplied with provisions, and an hospital in\r\n  the town provided for the sick men. This contributed to preserve the\r\n  soldiers in health; so that notwithstanding the excessive bad weather\r\n  and continued rains that fell during the campaign, there died of the\r\n  three regiments no more than ten soldiers:--but the weather growing\r\n  cold, and the snow falling in the mountains, obliged me to break up\r\n  the camp, and send the troops into winter quarters.\r\n\r\n  “The new-raised companies of Highlanders were for some time encamped\r\n  with the regular troops, performing the duty of the camp with the\r\n  rest of the soldiers. They mounted guard, went out upon parties, had\r\n  the articles of war read and explained to them, and were regularly\r\n  paid with the rest of the troops. When they had made some progress\r\n  in their exercise and discipline, they were sent to their respective\r\n  stations with proper orders; as well to prevent the Highlanders\r\n  from returning to the use of arms, as to hinder their committing\r\n  depredations on the low country.\r\n\r\n  “The Lord Lovat’s company was posted to guard all the passes in the\r\n  mountains, from the Isle of Skye eastward, as far as Inverness;\r\n  the company of Colonel Grant in the several passes from Inverness\r\n  southward to Dunkeld; Sir Duncan Campbell’s company, from Dunkeld\r\n  westward, as far as the country of Lorn. The three companies\r\n  commanded by lieutenants were posted, the first at Fort William; the\r\n  second at Killyhuimen; and the third at Ruthven in Badenoch; and may\r\n  in a short time be assembled in a body, to march to any part of the\r\n  Highlands as occasion may require.\r\n\r\n  “The clans of the northern Highlands having peaceably surrendered\r\n  their arms, pursuant to the several summonses sent them in your\r\n  majesty’s name, and consequently exposed to the inroads of their\r\n  neighbours, to prevent this inconvenience, (though the season of\r\n  the year was far advanced) I thought it both just and necessary to\r\n  proceed to disarm the southern clans, who had also joined in the\r\n  rebellion, and thereby to finish the campaign by summoning all the\r\n  clans and countries who had taken up arms against your majesty in the\r\n  year 1715.\r\n\r\n  “Summonses were accordingly sent to the inhabitants of the Brea of\r\n  Mar, Perth, Athol, Braidalbin, Menteth, and those parts of the shire\r\n  of Stirling and Dumbarton included in the disarming act. Parties of\r\n  the regular troops were ordered to march from the nearest garrisons\r\n  to several places appointed for the surrender of their arms, and\r\n  circular letters were sent to the principal gentlemen in those parts,\r\n  exciting them to follow the example of the northern Highlands. The\r\n  clans of these countries brought in their arms on the days and at the\r\n  places appointed by their respective summonses, but not in so great\r\n  a quantity as the northern clans had done. The gentlemen assured me\r\n  they had given strict orders to their tenants to bring in all the\r\n  arms they had in their possession; but that many of them, knowing\r\n  they were not to be paid for them, as stipulated by the former act,\r\n  several had been carried to the forges, and turned into working tools\r\n  and other peaceable instruments; there being no prohibition by the\r\n  act of parliament to hinder them from disposing of them in any manner\r\n  they thought most to their advantage, provided they had no arms in\r\n  their possession, after the day mentioned in the summons; and if\r\n  the informations I have received are true, the same thing has been\r\n  practised, more or less, by all the clans that have been summoned\r\n  pursuant to the present act of parliament, which makes no allowance\r\n  for arms delivered up, in order to prevent the notorious frauds and\r\n  abuses committed by those who had the execution of the former act,\r\n  whereby your majesty paid near £13,000 for broken and useless arms,\r\n  that were hardly worth the expense of carriage.\r\n\r\n  “The number of arms collected this year in the Highlands, of the\r\n  several species mentioned in the disarming act, amount in the whole\r\n  to 2,685. The greatest part of them are deposited in the Castle of\r\n  Edinburgh, and the rest at Fort William, and the barrack of Bernera.\r\n  At the time they were brought in by the clans, there was a mixture\r\n  of good and bad; but the damage they received in the carriage, and\r\n  growing rusty by being exposed to rain, they are of little more worth\r\n  than the value of the iron.\r\n\r\n  “In the execution of the power given me by your majesty, to grant\r\n  licences to such persons whose business or occupation required the\r\n  use of arms for their safety and defence, I have given out in the\r\n  whole 230 licences to the foresters, drovers, and dealers in cattle,\r\n  and other merchandise, belonging to the several clans who have\r\n  surrendered their arms, which are to remain in force for two years,\r\n  provided they behave themselves during that time as faithful subjects\r\n  to your majesty, and peaceably towards their neighbours. The names\r\n  of the persons empowered to wear arms by these licences are entered\r\n  in a book, as also the names of the gentlemen by whom they were\r\n  recommended, and who have promised to be answerable for their good\r\n  behaviour.\r\n\r\n  “The several summonses for the surrender of arms have been affixed\r\n  to the doors of 129 parish churches, on the market crosses of the\r\n  county towns; and copies of the same regularly entered in the\r\n  sheriff’s books in the method prescribed by the disarming act, by\r\n  which these Highlanders who shall presume to wear arms without a\r\n  legal qualification, are subject to the penalties of that law which\r\n  has already had so good an effect, that, instead of guns, swords,\r\n  durks, and pistols, they now travel to their churches, markets, and\r\n  fairs with only a staff in their hands. Since the Highland companies\r\n  have been posted at their respective stations, several of the most\r\n  notorious thieves have been seized on and committed to prison,\r\n  some of which are now under prosecution, but others, either by the\r\n  corruption or negligence of the jailers, have been set at liberty, or\r\n  suffered to make their escape.\r\n\r\n  “The imposition commonly called black-meal is now no longer paid\r\n  by the inhabitants bordering on the Highlands; and robberies and\r\n  depredations, formerly complained of, are less frequently attempted\r\n  than has been known for many years past, there having been but\r\n  one single instance where cattle have been stolen, without being\r\n  recovered and returned to their proper owners.\r\n\r\n  “At my first coming to the Highlands, I caused an exact survey to\r\n  be taken of the lakes, and that part of the country lying between\r\n  Inverness and Fort William, which extends from the east to the west\r\n  sea, in order to render the communication more practicable; and\r\n  materials were provided for the vessel which, by your majesty’s\r\n  commands, was to be built on the Lake Ness; which is now finished and\r\n  launched into the lake. It is made in the form of a gally, either\r\n  for rowing or sailing; is capable of carrying a party of 50 or 60\r\n  soldiers to any part of the country bordering on the said lake; and\r\n  will be of great use for transporting provisions and ammunition from\r\n  Inverness to the barrack of Killyhuimen, where four companies of foot\r\n  have been quartered since the beginning of last October.\r\n\r\n  “I presume also to acquaint your majesty, that parties of regular\r\n  troops have been constantly employed in making the roads of\r\n  communication between Killyhuimen and Fort William, who have already\r\n  made so good a progress in that work, that I hope, before the end of\r\n  next summer, they will be rendered both practicable and convenient\r\n  for the march of your majesty’s forces between those garrisons, and\r\n  facilitate their assembling in one body, if occasion should require.\r\n\r\n  “The fortifications and additional barracks, which, by your majesty’s\r\n  commands were to be erected at Inverness and Killyhuimen, are the\r\n  only part of your majesty’s instructions which I have not been able\r\n  to put in execution. There were no persons in that part of the\r\n  Highlands of sufficient credit or knowledge to contract for a work\r\n  of so extensive a nature. The stone must be cut out of the quarries;\r\n  nor could the timber be provided sooner than by sending to Norway to\r\n  purchase it; and, although the materials had been ready and at hand,\r\n  the excessive rains, that fell during the whole summer season, must\r\n  have rendered it impossible to have carried on the work. I have,\r\n  however, contracted for the necessary repairs of the old castle at\r\n  Inverness, which I am promised will be finished before next winter.\r\n\r\n  “I humbly beg leave to observe to your majesty, that nothing has\r\n  contributed more to the success of my endeavours in disarming the\r\n  Highlanders, and reducing the vassals of the late Earl of Seafield to\r\n  your obedience, than the power your majesty was pleased to grant me\r\n  of receiving the submissions of persons attainted of high treason.\r\n  They were dispersed in different parts of the Highlands, without the\r\n  least apprehension of being betrayed or molested by their countrymen,\r\n  and, for their safety and protection, must have contributed all they\r\n  were able to encourage the use of arms, and to infect the minds of\r\n  those people on whose protection they depended. In this situation,\r\n  they were proper instruments, and always ready to be employed in\r\n  promoting the interest of the Pretender, or any other foreign power\r\n  they thought capable of contributing to a change in that government\r\n  to which they had forfeited their lives, and from whom they expected\r\n  no favour. The greatest part of them were drawn into the rebellion\r\n  at the instigation of their superiors, and, in my humble opinion,\r\n  have continued their disaffection, rather from despair than any real\r\n  dislike to your majesty’s government; for it was no sooner known that\r\n  your majesty had empowered me to receive the submissions of those\r\n  who repented of their crimes, and were willing and desirous for the\r\n  future to live peaceably under your mild and moderate government,\r\n  but applications were made to me from several of them to intercede\r\n  with your majesty on their behalf, declaring their readiness to\r\n  abandon the Pretender’s party, and to pay a dutiful obedience to your\r\n  majesty; to which I answered, that I should be ready to intercede in\r\n  their favour, when I was farther convinced of the sincerity of their\r\n  promises; that it would soon come to their turn to be summoned to\r\n  bring in their arms; and, when they had paid that first mark of their\r\n  obedience, by peaceably surrendering them, I should thereby be better\r\n  justified in receiving their submissions, and in recommending them to\r\n  your majesty’s mercy and clemency.\r\n\r\n  “As soon as their respective clans had delivered up their arms,\r\n  several of these attainted persons came to me at different times and\r\n  places to render their submissions to your majesty. They laid down\r\n  their swords on the ground, expressed their sorrow and concern for\r\n  having made use of them in opposition to your majesty; and promised a\r\n  peaceful and dutiful obedience for the remaining part of their lives.\r\n  They afterwards sent me their several letters of submission, copies\r\n  of which I transmitted to your majesty’s principal secretary of state.\r\n\r\n  “I made use of the proper arguments to convince them of their past\r\n  folly and rashness, and gave them hopes of obtaining pardon from your\r\n  majesty’s gracious and merciful disposition; but, being a stranger\r\n  both to their persons and character, I required they would procure\r\n  gentlemen of unquestioned zeal to your majesty’s government, who\r\n  would write to me in their favour, and in some measure be answerable\r\n  for their future conduct--which was accordingly done.\r\n\r\n  “When the news came that your majesty was graciously pleased to\r\n  accept their submission, and had given the proper orders for\r\n  preparing their pardons, it was received with great joy and\r\n  satisfaction throughout the Highlands, which occasioned the Jacobites\r\n  at Edinburgh to say, (by way of reproach,) that I had not only\r\n  defrauded the Highlanders of their arms, but had also debauched them\r\n  from their loyalty and allegiance.”[758]\r\n\r\nBarracks were built at Inverness, a fort erected at Fort-Augustus,\r\nand at various places over the country small towers or forts, each\r\ncapable of containing a small number of soldiers.\r\n\r\nWade at the same time received letters of submission from a\r\nconsiderable number of chiefs and other troublesome Highlanders who\r\nwere lying under the taint of high treason. These were expressed\r\nin terms of excessive humility and contrition, and were full of\r\nthe strongest promises of future good behaviour. Wade seems, as\r\nBurton[759] remarks, “to have known so little of the people as to\r\nbelieve in their sincerity. Yet the contemporary correspondence of\r\nthe Jacobites indicates, what subsequent events confirmed, that the\r\nHighlanders, with the inscrutable diplomatic cunning peculiar to\r\ntheir race, had overreached the military negotiator, and committed\r\na quantity of effective arms to places of concealment.”[760]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest services rendered by Wade to the government, and\r\nthat for which he is chiefly known to posterity, was the construction\r\nof roads through the Highlands, in order to facilitate the march of\r\ntroops, and open up a communication between the various garrisons.\r\nPrevious to this the only substitutes for roads existing in the\r\nHighlands were the rude tracts, sometimes scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom the surrounding waste, made by many generations of Highlanders\r\nand their cattle over mountains, through bogs, across rapid rivers,\r\nskirting giddy precipices, and perfectly bewildering and fraught\r\nwith danger to any but natives. Captain Burt, one of the engineers\r\nengaged in Wade’s expedition, gives in his _Letters_ many graphic\r\ndescriptions of the difficulties and dangers attendant on travelling\r\nin the Highlands before the making of these new roads. “The old\r\nways,” he says, “(for roads I shall not call them,) consisted chiefly\r\nof stony moors, bogs, rugged, rapid fords, declivities of hills,\r\nentangling woods, and giddy precipices.”[761] As a specimen of what\r\nthe traveller might expect in his progress among the mountains, we\r\ngive the following incident which occurred to Burt in one of his own\r\njourneys.[762] “There was nothing remarkable afterwards, till I came\r\nnear the top of the hill; where there was a seeming plain, of about\r\n150 yards, between me and the summit.\r\n\r\n“No sooner was I upon the edge of it, but my guide desired me to\r\nalight; and then I perceived it was a bog, or peat-moss, as they call\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“I had experience enough of these deceitful surfaces to order that\r\nthe horses should be led in separate parts, lest, if one broke the\r\nturf, the other, treading in his steps, might sink.\r\n\r\n“The horse I used to ride having little weight but his own, went on\r\npretty successfully; only now and then breaking the surface a little;\r\nbut the other, that carried my portmanteau, and being not quite so\r\nnimble, was much in danger, till near the further end, and there he\r\nsank. But it luckily happened to be in a part where his long legs\r\nwent to the bottom, which is generally hard gravel, or rock; but he\r\nwas in almost up to the back.\r\n\r\n“By this time my own (for distinction) was quite free of the bog,\r\nand being frighted, stood very tamely by himself; which he would not\r\nhave done at another time. In the mean while we were forced to wait\r\nat a distance, while the other was flouncing and throwing the dirt\r\nabout him; for there was no means of coming near him to ease him of\r\nthe heavy burden he had upon his loins, by which he was sometimes\r\nin danger to be turned upon his back, when he rose to break the bog\r\nbefore him. But, in about a quarter of an hour, he got out, bedaubed\r\nwith the slough, shaking with fear, and his head and neck all over in\r\na foam.\r\n\r\n“As for myself, I was harassed on this slough, by winding about\r\nfrom place to place, to find such tufts as were within my stride or\r\nleap, in my heavy boots with high heels; which, by my spring, when\r\nthe little hillocks were too far asunder, broke the turf, and then\r\nI threw myself down toward the next protuberance; but to my guide\r\nit seemed nothing; he was light of body, shod with flat _brogues_,\r\nwide in the soles, and accustomed to a particular step, suited to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n“This hill was about three quarters of a mile over, and had but a\r\nshort descent on the further side, rough, indeed, but not remarkable\r\nin this country. I had now five computed miles to go before I came to\r\nmy first asylum,--that is, five Scots miles, which, as in the north\r\nof England, are longer than yours as three is to two; and, if the\r\ndifficulty of the way were to be taken into account, it might well be\r\ncalled fifteen. This, except about three quarters of a mile of heathy\r\nground, pretty free from stones and rocks, consisted of stony moors,\r\nalmost impracticable for a horse with his rider, and likewise of\r\nrocky way, where we were obliged to dismount, and sometimes climb,\r\nand otherwhile slide down. But what vexed me most of all, they called\r\nit a road; and yet I must confess it was preferable to a boggy way.\r\nThe great difficulty was to wind about with the horses, and find such\r\nplaces as they could possibly be got over.”\r\n\r\nWade went vigorously to work in the construction of his roads,\r\nselecting from the regular troops and Highland companies 500\r\nmen, who were put on extra pay while at the work of road-making.\r\nNotwithstanding the many difficulties to be encountered, the\r\ninexperience of the workmen, and the inferior tools then at their\r\ncommand for such a purpose, the undertaking was satisfactorily\r\naccomplished in about ten years. A Scottish gentleman, who visited\r\nthe Highlands in 1737, found the roads completed, and was surprised\r\nby the improvements which he found to have arisen from them, amongst\r\nwhich he gratefully notes the existence of civilized places for\r\nthe entertainment of travellers. Formerly the only apologies for\r\nhostelries in the Highlands were wretched huts, often with only one\r\napartment, swarming with lively insects, the atmosphere solid with\r\nsmoke, and the fragile walls pierced here and there with holes large\r\nenough to admit a man’s head. Now, however, these were replaced by\r\nsmall but substantial inns built of stone, located at distances of\r\nabout ten miles from each other along the new roads. The standard\r\nbreadth of the roads was sixteen feet, although where possible they\r\nwere made wider, and were carried on in straight lines, unless where\r\nthis was impracticable.\r\n\r\nWade’s main road, commencing at Perth, went by Dunkeld and\r\nBlair-Athole to Dalnacardoch, where it was joined by another from\r\nStirling by Crieff, through Glenalmond, to Aberfeldy, where it\r\ncrossed the Tay, on what was then considered a magnificent bridge\r\nof five arches. From Dalnacardoch the road goes on to Dalwhinny,\r\nwhere it again branches into two, one branch proceeding towards the\r\nnorth-west through Garva Moor, and over the Corryarrick mountain to\r\nFort-Augustus, the other striking almost due north to Ruthven in\r\nBadenoch, and thence by Delmagary to Inverness. Another road, along\r\nthe shores of Lochs Ness and Lochy, joined the latter place with\r\nthe strongholds of Fort-Augustus and Fort-William. One of the most\r\ndifficult parts of the undertaking was the crossing of the lofty\r\nCorryarrick, the road having to be carried up the south side of the\r\nmountain by a series of about fifteen zigzags. The entire length of\r\nroad constructed measured about 250 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lieutenant General Wade, Commander-in-Chief of all\r\nHis Majesty’s Forces in Scotland. (From an old engraving in the\r\npossession of D. Laing, Esq.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough these roads were doubtless of considerable advantage in\r\na military point of view, they appear to have been of very little\r\nuse in developing the commercial resources of the country. “They\r\nwere indeed truly military roads--laid down by a practical soldier,\r\nand destined for warlike purposes--with scarcely any view towards\r\nthe ends for which free and peaceful citizens open up a system of\r\ninternal transit.”[763] They appear to have been regarded with\r\nsuspicion and dislike by all classes of the Highlanders. The chiefs,\r\naccording to Burt,[764] complained that in time of peace they opened\r\nup their country to strangers, who would be likely to weaken the\r\nattachment of their vassals, and that in time of war they laid their\r\nfastnesses open to the enemy. The bridges, especially, they said\r\nwould render the people effeminate, and less fit to ford the rivers\r\nin other places where there were no such means of crossing. The\r\nmiddle class again objected to them because, their horses being\r\nunshod,--and necessarily so on account of the places where they had\r\nto find pasture--the gravel would soon whet away their hoofs, and\r\nthus render them unserviceable. “The lowest class, who, many of\r\nthem, at some times cannot compass a pair of shoes for themselves,\r\nallege that the gravel is intolerable to their naked feet; and the\r\ncomplaint has extended to their thin brogues.” For these reasons,\r\nallied no doubt to obstinacy and hatred of innovation and government\r\ninterference, many of the Highlanders, despising the new roads,\r\ncontinued to walk in the wretched ways of their fathers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Chevalier still had many adherents in the south of\r\nScotland, yet, as they were narrowly watched by the government, it\r\nwas considered inexpedient and unsafe to correspond with them on\r\nthe subject of the Spanish expedition. In the state of uncertainty\r\nin which they were thus kept, they wisely abstained from committing\r\nthemselves, and when Marischal landed they were quite unprepared to\r\nrender him any assistance, and unanimously resolved not to move in\r\nany shape till a rising should take place in England in favour of the\r\nChevalier.\r\n\r\nAs many inconveniences had arisen from a want of co-operation\r\namong the friends of the Chevalier in the south of Scotland, Mr.\r\nLockhart, in concert with the Bishop of Edinburgh, proposed to James\r\nthat the Earls of Eglinton and Wigton, Lord Balmerino, the Bishop\r\nof Edinburgh, (the head of the nonjuring clergy,) Mr. Paterson of\r\nPreston-hall, and Captain Straiton, should be appointed commissioners\r\nor trustees for transacting his affairs in Scotland. This proposal\r\non the whole was well received by the Chevalier, who, however,\r\nprobably influenced by the jealous schemers who surrounded him, did\r\nnot sanction the formation of a regularly organized authoritative\r\ncommission. Writing to Lockhart in February, 1721, he says, “to\r\nappoint a certain number of persons for this effect by commission, is\r\nby no means, at this time, advisable, because of the inconveniences\r\nit might draw, sooner or later, upon the persons concern’d; since\r\nit could not but be expected that the present government would, at\r\nlong run, be inform’d of such a paper which, by its nature, must be\r\nknown to a great number of people; besides, that many who might\r\nbe most fit to discharge such a trust might, with reason, not be\r\nfond of having their names exposed in such a matter; while, on the\r\nother hand, numbers might be disobliged for not having a share where\r\nit is not possible all can be concerned; but I think all these\r\ninconveniences may be obviated, the intent of the proposal comply’d\r\nwith, and equal advantages drawn from it if the persons named below,\r\nor some of them, would meet and consult together for the intents\r\nabove-mention’d. The persons you propose I entirely approve, to\r\nwit, the Earls of Eglinton and Wigton, Lord Balmerino, the Bishop\r\nof Edinburgh, Mr. Paterson and Captain Straiton, to whom I would\r\nhave added Mr. Harry Maul, Sir John Erskine, Lord Dun, Pourie and\r\nGlengary.”[765]\r\n\r\nMr. Lockhart acquainted the different persons, therein named, of its\r\ncontents, and all of them undertook to execute the trust reposed in\r\nthem; but as they judged it advisable to conceal the powers they had\r\nreceived from their friends, they requested Mr. Lockhart, when their\r\nadvice was wanted, to communicate with them individually, and having\r\ncollected their sentiments, to give the necessary instructions with\r\ndue caution.\r\n\r\nIn June 1721, a treaty of peace was signed at Madrid between Great\r\nBritain and Spain, and at the same time a defensive alliance was\r\nentered into between Great Britain, France, and Spain. As the two\r\nlast were the only powers from whom the “Pretender” could expect any\r\neffectual aid in support of his pretensions, his long-wished-for\r\nrestoration seemed now to be hopeless, and King George secure, as he\r\nimagined, from foreign invasion and domestic plots, made preparations\r\nfor visiting his German dominions, and actually appointed a regency\r\nto act in his absence. But early in the year 1722, a discovery\r\nwas made, on information received by the king from the regent of\r\nFrance, that the Jacobites were busy in a new conspiracy against the\r\ngovernment. It appeared that the Chevalier de St. George, who was at\r\nRome, was to sail from Porto-Longone for Spain, under the protection\r\nof three Spanish men-of-war, and there to wait the resolutions\r\nof his friends.[766] In following the clue given by the Duke of\r\nOrleans, it was ascertained that all the letters, in relation to the\r\nconspiracy, were carried to Mr. George Kelly, an Irish clergyman, who\r\ndespatched them to their different destinations. The insurrection was\r\nto have taken place during the king’s absence in Hanover; but his\r\nmajesty having deferred his journey in consequence of the discovery\r\nof the plot, the conspirators resolved to postpone their attempt till\r\nthe dissolution of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators, finding they were watched by government, became\r\nextremely cautious, and the ministers, desirous of getting hold of\r\nthe treasonable correspondence, ordered Kelly, the principal agent,\r\nto be arrested. He was accordingly apprehended, but not until he had,\r\nby keeping his assailants at bay with his sword, succeeded in burning\r\nthe greater part of his papers. Although the papers which were seized\r\nfrom Kelly, and others which had been intercepted by government, bore\r\nevident marks of a conspiracy, yet it became very difficult, from\r\nthe fictitious names used in them, to trace out the guilty persons.\r\n“We are in trace of several things very material,” observes Robert\r\nWalpole in a letter to his brother, in reference to this discovery,\r\n“but we fox-hunters know that we do not always find every fox that we\r\ncross upon.” Among other persons who were arrested on suspicion, were\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, Lords North and Grey, Strafford, and Orrery,\r\nAtterbury, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Harry Goring.\r\n\r\nTo check the threatened insurrection, a camp was immediately formed\r\nin Hyde-park, and all military officers were ordered to repair\r\nto their respective regiments. Lieutenant-general Macartney was\r\ndespatched to Ireland to bring over some troops from that kingdom,\r\nand the states of Holland were requested to have their auxiliary\r\ntroops in readiness for embarkation. These preparations, and the many\r\nrumours which prevailed respecting the extent of the conspiracy,\r\naffected public credit, and a run took place upon the bank, but the\r\npanic soon subsided, and public confidence was restored.\r\n\r\nOf all the persons seized of any note, the Bishop of Rochester\r\nwas the only individual against whom a charge could plausibly be\r\nmaintained. He was equally noted for his high literary attainments\r\nand a warm attachment to the exploded dogma of passive obedience. He\r\nhad written Sacheverel’s defence _con amore_, and he had carried his\r\npartisanship for the house of Stuart so far, that, according to Lord\r\nHarcourt, he offered, upon the death of Queen Anne, to proclaim the\r\nChevalier de St. George at Charing-cross in his lawn sleeves, and\r\nwhen his proposal was declined, he is said to have exclaimed, “Never\r\nwas a better cause lost for want of spirit.”\r\n\r\nAfter an examination before the privy-council, the bishop was\r\ncommitted to the Tower on a charge of high treason. The committal of\r\nthe bishop was highly resented by the clergy, who considered it an\r\noutrage upon the Church of England and the Episcopal order, and they\r\ngave full vent to their feelings by offering up public prayers for\r\nhis health in all the churches and chapels of London and Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe new parliament met in the month of October, and the first thing\r\nthe king did was to announce, by a speech from the throne, the nature\r\nof the conspiracy. A bill for suspending the _habeas corpus_ act for\r\na whole year was immediately brought into the house of lords, but as\r\nthe period of suspension was double of any suspension hitherto known,\r\nit met with some opposition. In the commons, however, the opposition\r\nwas so violent, that Mr. Robert Walpole found himself necessitated to\r\ninvent a story of a design to seize the bank and the exchequer, and\r\nto proclaim the “Pretender” on the royal exchange. This ridiculous\r\ntale, uttered with the greatest confidence, alarmed the commons, and\r\nthey passed the bill.\r\n\r\nAs the Catholics were supposed to be chiefly concerned in the\r\nconspiracy, a bill was introduced into the house of commons for\r\nraising £100,000 upon the real and personal estates of all “papists,”\r\nor persons educated in the Catholic religion, towards defraying the\r\nexpenses incurred by the late rebellion and disorders. This bill\r\nbeing justly regarded as a species of persecution, was warmly opposed\r\nby some members, but it was sent up to the house of lords along with\r\nanother bill, obliging all persons, being “papists,” in Scotland,\r\nand all persons in Great Britain refusing or neglecting to take the\r\noaths appointed for the king’s person and government, to register\r\ntheir names and real estates. As might have been anticipated, both\r\nbills were passed without amendments, and received the royal assent.\r\n\r\nAtterbury was brought up for trial on the 9th of May, 1723, and\r\nsentenced to banishment under pain of death if he should ever return.\r\nHe quitted the kingdom in June, and after a short stay at Brussels,\r\nfinally settled in Paris. It is said that when crossing over to\r\nCalais he met Lord Bolingbroke, then on his way to England, whom he\r\nthus addressed with a smile, “My lord, you and I are exchanged!”\r\n\r\nThe return of this extraordinary person to England gave rise to much\r\nspeculation, and many conjectures were hazarded as to the reasons\r\nwhich had induced Walpole to promote the return of a man whose\r\nimpeachment he had himself moved; but the mystery has been cleared up\r\nby papers which have since met the public eye. From these it appears\r\nthat several years before his appearance in England, Bolingbroke had\r\ncompletely broken with the Stuarts in consequence of his deprivation\r\nof the seals. It seems that the Earl of Mar and the duke had a\r\nviolent difference with regard to the conduct of the expedition in\r\n1715; and Mar, to revenge himself upon his rival, prevailed upon\r\nthe Duke of Ormond to report in presence of the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge certain abusive expressions which Bolingbroke, when in a state\r\nof intoxication, had uttered in disparagement of his master. The\r\nChevalier, highly exasperated at Bolingbroke, sent for the seals,\r\nat which his lordship was so incensed that when the queen mother\r\nattempted to reconcile them, Bolingbroke said that he wished his arm\r\nmight rot off if ever he drew his sword or employed his pen in the\r\nservice of the Stuarts. He, thereupon, proffered his services to\r\nKing George, and offered to do any thing but betray the secrets of\r\nhis friends. This offer was followed by the celebrated letter to Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham, in which he dissuaded the Tories from placing any\r\nreliance on the Pretender, and exposed the exiled family to ridicule\r\nand contempt; but his overtures were rejected by the government, and\r\nwhen an act of indemnity was hinted at, Walpole expressed in the\r\nstrongest terms his indignation at the very idea of such a measure.\r\nBolingbroke, however, persevered; and Walpole having been softened\r\nby the entreaties of the Duchess of Kendal, one of the mistresses of\r\nthe king, to whom Bolingbroke made a present of £11,000, he procured\r\na pardon. In April, 1725, a bill was brought into the house of lords\r\nfor restoring to Bolingbroke his family estate, which, after some\r\nopposition, passed both houses.\r\n\r\nUpon the passing of the disarming act, some of the Highland chiefs\r\nheld a meeting at Paris, at which they resolved to apply to the\r\nChevalier de St. George, to know whether, in his opinion, they should\r\nsubmit to the new law. James returned an answer under cover to the\r\nrestless Atterbury, in which he advised the chiefs rather to submit\r\nthan run the risk of ruining their followers; but the bishop thought\r\nproper to keep up the letter, and having sent off an express to Rome,\r\nJames was induced to write another letter altogether different from\r\nthe first, requiring them to resist, by force, the intended attempt\r\nof the government to disarm the Highlanders. Meanwhile, the chiefs\r\nwere apprised of James’s original sentiments by a correspondent at\r\nRome, and of the letter which had been sent to Atterbury’s care.\r\nUnaware of this circumstance, the bishop, on receipt of the second\r\nletter, convened the chiefs, and communicated to them its contents;\r\nbut these being so completely at variance with the information of\r\ntheir correspondent, they insisted upon seeing the first letter,\r\nbut Atterbury refused in the most positive terms to exhibit it,\r\nand insisted upon compliance with the injunctions contained in the\r\nsecond letter. They, thereupon, desired to know what support they\r\nwere to receive in men, money, and arms; but the bishop told them,\r\nthat unless they resolved to go to Scotland and take up arms, he\r\nwould give them no further information than this, that they would be\r\nassisted by a certain foreign power, whose name he was not at liberty\r\nto mention.[767] The chiefs, dissatisfied with the conduct of the\r\nbishop, refused to pledge themselves as required, and retired.\r\n\r\nThe great preparations made to carry the disarming act into\r\neffect, indicated a dread, on the part of the government, that the\r\nHighlanders would not deliver up their arms without a struggle.\r\nThe Chevalier de St. George, deceived as it would appear by the\r\nrepresentations of Atterbury, resolved to support the Highlanders,\r\nto the effect at least of enabling them to obtain favourable terms\r\nfrom the government. “I find,” says James, in a letter[768] to Mr.\r\nLockhart, “they (the Highlanders) are of opinion that nothing less\r\nthan utter ruin is designed for them, and those on this side are\r\npersuaded that the English government will meet with the greatest\r\ndifficulties in executing their projects, and that the clans will\r\nunanimously agree to oppose them to the last, and if thereby\r\ncircumstances will allow them to do nothing for my service, that\r\nthey will still, by a capitulation, be able to procure better terms\r\nto themselves than they can propose by leaving themselves at the\r\ngovernment’s mercy, and delivering up their arms; and, if so, I am\r\nresolved, and I think I owe it to them, to do all in my power to\r\nsupport them, and the distance I am at has obliged me to give my\r\norders accordingly; and nothing in my power shall be wanting to\r\nenable them to keep their ground against the government, at least\r\ntill they can procure good terms for themselves, though, at the same\r\ntime, I must inform you that the opposition they propose to make\r\nmay prove of the greatest advantage to my interest, considering the\r\nhopes I have of foreign assistance, which, perhaps, you may hear of\r\neven before you receive this letter. I should not have ventured to\r\ncall the Highlanders together, without a certainty of their being\r\nsupported, but the great probability there is of it makes me not at\r\nall sorry they should take the resolution of defending themselves,\r\nand not delivering up their arms, which would have rendered them, in\r\na great measure, useless to their countrie; and as the designs of\r\nthe government are represented to me, the laying down of their arms\r\nis only to be the forerunner of other methods, that are to be taken\r\nto extirpate their race for ever. They are certainly in the right to\r\nmake the government buy their slavery at as dear a rate as they can.\r\nThe distance I am at (Rome), and the imperfect accounts I have had\r\nof this law, (for disarming the Highlanders,) have been very unlucky;\r\nhowever, the orders I have sent to France I hope will not come too\r\nlate, and I can answer for the diligence in the execution of them,\r\nwhich is all I can say to you at present from hence.”\r\n\r\nA few days after the receipt of this letter, Mr. Lockhart went\r\nto Edinburgh, where he found the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl\r\nof Kincardine, two of James’s “trustees,” to whom he showed the\r\nletter, and requested their opinion as to the proposed attempt to\r\nresist the contemplated measures of the government. These noblemen\r\nconsidered that the attempt would be rash as well as fatal,--that\r\nthe idea of obtaining better terms by a temporary resistance, was\r\nvain, unless the Highlanders succeed in defeating the government;\r\nbut that if they failed, the utter extirpation of their race would\r\ncertainly follow;--that the Highlanders being a body of men of such\r\nhigh value, as well in relation to the interests of the exiled\r\nfamily, as to those of the kingdom, it was by no means reasonable\r\nto hazard them upon an uncertainty, for though they should give\r\nup their arms, it would be easier to provide them afterwards with\r\nothers, when their services were required, than to repair the loss\r\nof their persons;--that with regard to foreign assistance, as such\r\nundertakings were liable to many accidents, and as the best formed\r\ndesigns often turned out abortive, it was by no means advisable to\r\nhazard the Highlanders, who were hated by the government, upon the\r\nexpectancy of such aid; and that if such foreign powers as could, and\r\nwere willing to assist, would inquire into the true state of affairs\r\nin Scotland, they would find that wherever a feasible attempt should\r\nbe made by them to restore the exiled family, the Scots would be\r\nready to declare themselves.\r\n\r\nThis opinion was communicated by Mr. Lockhart to James,[769] and he\r\ninformed him at the same time that a person of distinction, who had\r\nbeen sent by the Highland Jacobite chiefs to obtain intelligence\r\nand advice, had arrived in Edinburgh _incognito_, and had informed\r\nKincardine that the Highlanders had resolved to make a show of\r\nsubmission, by giving up part of their arms under the pretence of\r\ndelivering up the whole, while their intention was to retain and\r\nconceal the best and greater part of them. Kincardine, without giving\r\nany opinion on the subject, recommended to the gentleman in question,\r\nas foreign assistance might be speedily expected, the expediency\r\nof putting off the delivery as long as possible, and that as four\r\nor five weeks would be consumed before the forms required by the\r\nact could be complied with, they should retain their arms till the\r\nexpiration of that period.\r\n\r\nThe advice given by Hamilton and Eglinton coincided with the\r\nview which James, upon being made acquainted with the resolution\r\nof the chief at Paris, had adopted; and in a letter written to\r\nMr. Lockhart by Colonel Hay, whom he had appointed his secretary\r\nof state, and raised to the peerage under the title of Earl of\r\nInverness, he signified his approbation of the advice given by his\r\nfriends, which he said was entirely agreeable to his own sentiments\r\nfrom the beginning. He stated, moreover, that the orders he had\r\ngiven to assist the Highlanders were only conditional, and in the\r\nevent only that they themselves should have resolved to oppose the\r\ngovernment, and that if the Bishop of Rochester had pressed any\r\nof the chiefs at Paris to go to arms, it was more with a view to\r\ndiscover a correspondence which he suspected one of them had carried\r\non independent of the others, than with any real design to induce\r\nthem to order their followers to make opposition, as that was to have\r\ndepended as much upon the chiefs at home as upon those abroad.[770]\r\n\r\nWhen James ascertained that the Highlanders were resolved to\r\nsubmit, he withdrew the orders he had given for assisting them, and\r\ndespatched a trusty messenger to the Highlands to acquaint them of\r\nhis readiness to support them when a proper occasion offered, and to\r\ncollect information as to the state of the country. Allan Cameron,\r\nthe messenger in question, arrived in the Highlands in August, and\r\nvisited the heads of the clans in the interest of James, to whom\r\nhe delivered the message with which he had been intrusted. It is\r\nsaid that General Wade was aware of his arrival, but it does not\r\nappear that any measures were taken to apprehend him. After four\r\nmonths’ residence in the Highlands, Cameron ventured on a journey to\r\nEdinburgh, where, in the beginning of the year 1726, he held frequent\r\nconferences with the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Kincardine, and\r\nLockhart of Carnwath, on the subject of his mission and the state\r\nof affairs, but nothing of importance was resolved upon at these\r\nmeetings, and Cameron departed for the continent early in February.\r\n\r\nAbout this time an event occurred, which, while it tended to create\r\nfactions amongst the adherents of James, made many of them keep\r\neither altogether aloof from any direct management in his affairs,\r\nor abstain from entering into any plan of co-operation for his\r\nrestoration. This was the dismissal of Mar from his post as minister\r\nof James at Paris, on the suspicion that he had betrayed the secrets\r\nof his master to the British government. From his situation he was\r\nintimately acquainted with all the Chevalier’s affairs, and knew the\r\nname of every person of any note in the three kingdoms who had taken\r\nan interest in the restoration of the exiled family, with many of\r\nwhom he himself had corresponded. The removal, therefore, of such a\r\nperson from the Jacobite councils could not fail to excite uneasy\r\napprehensions in the minds of those who had intrusted him with their\r\nconfidence, and to make them extremely cautious in again committing\r\nthemselves by any act, which, if discovered, would place them in\r\njeopardy. To this feeling may be ascribed the great reserve which for\r\nseveral years subsequent to this occurrence the Jacobites observed in\r\ntheir foreign relations, and the want of unity of action which formed\r\nso remarkable a characteristic in their subsequent proceedings. As\r\nthis affair forms an important link in the historical chain which\r\nconnects the events of the year 1715 with those of 1745, a short\r\naccount of it is necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring a temporary confinement at Geneva, Mar had obtained a sum\r\nof money, whether solicited or not does not appear, from the Earl\r\nof Stair, the British ambassador at Paris, without the knowledge\r\nof James. In a narrative afterwards drawn up by Mar in his own\r\njustification, he states, that being in great straits he received\r\nthis money as a loan from the earl, who was his old friend; but\r\nColonel Hay, in a letter to Mr. Lockhart of the 8th of September,\r\n1725, states that Mar had no occasion for such a loan, as “the king”\r\nremitted him considerable supplies to Geneva, where his expense\r\nwould be trifling, as he was entertained by the town.[771] This\r\nmatter might have been overlooked, but he, soon thereafter, accepted\r\na pension of £2,000 from the government, over and above the sum of\r\n£1,500 which his countess and daughter actually then received by way\r\nof jointure and aliment out of the produce of his estate. Mar states\r\nthat before he agreed to receive this pension he took the advice of\r\nGeneral Dillon, a zealous supporter of the interests of the Stuarts,\r\nwhom he had been accustomed to consult in all matters of importance,\r\nand that the general advised him to accept of the offer, as by\r\nrefusing it the government might stop his lady’s jointure, and that\r\nhis estate would be sold and lost for ever to his family; and that as\r\nhe had been released from his confinement at Geneva on condition that\r\nhe should not act or take any part against the government of Great\r\nBritain during his abode in France, and should return when required\r\nto Geneva, that government might insist on his being sent back to\r\nGeneva, whence he had been allowed to go to the waters of Bourbon for\r\nhis health. Mar communicated the proposal also to James, who at once\r\nsanctioned his acceptance of the pension, and assured him that his\r\nsentiments in regard to him remained unaltered. Notwithstanding this\r\nassurance, however, there is every reason to believe that James, not\r\nwithout good grounds, had begun to suspect his fidelity; and as he\r\ncould clearly perceive that Mar had already taken his resolution to\r\nclose with the government, he might consider it his wisest policy to\r\nconceal his displeasure, and not to break at once with a man who had\r\nso much in his power to injure him and his friends.\r\n\r\nHaving thus succeeded in their advances to Mar, the government,\r\non receiving information of the conspiracy in which Atterbury was\r\nconcerned, sent a gentleman to Paris in May, 1722, with a letter to\r\nMar from Lord Carteret. This gentleman received instructions to\r\nsound Mar as to his knowledge of the intended plot. On arriving at\r\nParis, the messenger, (who, it is understood, was Colonel Churchill,)\r\nsent a letter to Mar requesting a private interview. Dillon was\r\npresent when this letter was delivered, and on reading it, Mar says\r\nhe showed it to Dillon, upon which it was arranged that Mar should\r\ninstantly call upon the person who had written the letter, and that\r\nDillon should remain in the house till Mar’s return, when the object\r\nand nature of the interview would be communicated to him. On Mar’s\r\nreturn he and Dillon consulted together, and they both thought that\r\nthe incident was a lucky one, as it afforded Mar an opportunity of\r\ndoing James’s affairs a good service by leading the government off\r\nthe true scent, and thereby prevent further inquiries. They thereupon\r\ndrew up a letter with that view, to be sent by Mar in answer to\r\nCarteret’s communication, which being approved of by another person\r\nin the confidence of the Chevalier, was sent by Mar to the bearer\r\nof Carteret’s letter. Mar immediately sent an account of the affair\r\nto James and the Duke of Ormond, and shortly received a letter from\r\nthe former, dated 8th June, 1722, in which he expressed himself\r\nentirely satisfied with the course pursued by Mar on the occasion. To\r\njustify himself still farther, Mar states, that among the vouchers\r\nof his exculpation, there was the copy of another letter from James,\r\nwritten by him to one of his agents at Paris, wherein he justifies\r\nand approves of Mar’s conduct, and expresses his regret for the\r\naspersions which had been cast upon the earl about the plot.\r\n\r\nThough James thus continued to profess his usual confidence in Mar’s\r\nintegrity, he had, ever since he became acquainted with his pecuniary\r\nobligations to Stair, resolved to withdraw that confidence from him\r\nby degrees, and in such a manner as might not be prejudicial to the\r\nadherents of the exiled family in Great Britain. But Mar, who, as\r\nJames observed,[772] had put himself under such engagements that he\r\ncould not any longer serve him in a public manner, and who, from the\r\nnature of these engagements, should have declined all knowledge of\r\nJames’s secrets, continued to meddle with his affairs as formerly,\r\nby taking the direction and management of those intrusted to Dillon,\r\nthe confidential agent of James and the English Jacobites. In this\r\nway was Mar enabled for several years, when distrusted by James,\r\nto compel him in a manner to keep on good terms with him. From\r\nthe natural timidity of James, and his anxiety to avoid an open\r\nbreach with Mar, it is difficult to say how long matters might\r\nhave remained in this awkward state, had not the attention of the\r\nScottish Jacobites been drawn to Mar’s pension by the report of\r\nthe parliamentary committee concerning the conspiracy; and the\r\nrepresentations of the Bishop of Rochester respecting Mar’s conduct,\r\nshortly after his arrival in France, brought matters to a crisis. In\r\nthe letter last referred to, James thus intimates to Mr. Lockhart the\r\nfinal dismissal of Mar. “I have been always unwilling to mention Mar,\r\nbut I find myself indispensably engaged at present to let my Scots\r\nfriends know that I have withdrawn my confidence entirely from him,\r\nas I shall be obliged to do from all who may be any ways influenced\r\nby him. This conduct is founded on the strongest and most urgent\r\nnecessity in which my regard to my faithful subjects and servants\r\nhave the greatest share. What is here said of Mar is not with a\r\nview of its being made public, there being no occasion for that,\r\nsince, many years ago, he put himself under such engagements that he\r\ncould not serve me in a public manner, neither has he been publicly\r\nemploy’d by me.”\r\n\r\nThe charges made by Atterbury against Mar were, _1mo_, That about the\r\ntime he, the bishop, was sent prisoner to the Tower, Mar had written\r\nhim a letter which was the cause of his banishment. _2do_, That\r\nhe had betrayed the secrets of the Chevalier de St. George to the\r\nBritish government, and had entered into a correspondence with them.\r\n_3tio_, That he had advised the Chevalier to resign his right to the\r\ncrown for a pension; and lastly, that without consulting James, he\r\ndrew up and presented a memorial to the Duke of Orleans, containing\r\na plan, which, under the pretence of restoring him, would, if acted\r\nupon, have rendered his restoration for ever impracticable.\r\n\r\nTo understand the nature of the last charge against Mar, that he\r\nlaid the scheme before the Regent of France with a design to ruin\r\nJames, Mar refers to the plan itself for his justification. The\r\nexpulsion of the Stuarts from the British throne had been always\r\nlooked upon by the French court as an event which, by dividing the\r\nnation into rival factions, would enable France to humble and weaken\r\nan ancient and formidable rival. To encourage the Jacobites and\r\nTories in their opposition to the new dynasty, and to embroil the\r\nnation in a civil war, the French ministry repeatedly promised to\r\naid them in any attempts they might make to overturn the government;\r\nbut true to the line of policy they had laid down for themselves, of\r\nallowing the opposing parties in the state to weaken each other’s\r\nstrength in their contest for ascendency, they sided with the weaker\r\nparty only to prolong the struggle, in the hope that, by thus keeping\r\nalive the spirit of discontent, France might be enabled to extend her\r\npower, and carry into effect her designs of conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ERSKINE, EARL OF MARR.]\r\n\r\nTo remove the objections which such a policy opposed to the\r\nrestoration of James, Mar proposed that, upon such event taking\r\nplace, Scotland and Ireland should be restored to their ancient state\r\nof independence, and protected in their trade, and thereby enabled,\r\nas they would be inclined, to support “the king in such a manner as\r\nhe’d be under no necessity of entering into measures contrary to\r\nhis inclinations to gratify the caprices, and allay the factions of\r\nhis English subjects.”[773] He also proposed that a certain number\r\nof French forces should remain in Britain after James was restored,\r\ntill he had modelled and established the government on this footing,\r\nand that 5,000 Scots and as many Irish troops should be lent to the\r\nFrench king, to be kept by him in pay for a certain number of years.\r\nMar was fully aware that such a scheme would be highly unpopular in\r\nEngland, on which account he says, that although he had long ago\r\nformed it, he took no steps therein during the life of Cardinal\r\nDubois, whom he knew to be particularly attached to the existing\r\ngovernment of Britain; but that obstacle being removed, he laid it\r\nbefore the regent of France, who, he says, he had reason to believe,\r\nreceived it with approbation, as he sealed it up, and addressed it\r\nto the Duke of Bourbon, and recommended it to his care. To excuse\r\nhimself for laying the scheme before the Duke of Orleans without the\r\nChevalier’s knowledge, he states that he did so to prevent James, in\r\ncase of the scheme being discovered, being blamed by those who, for\r\nparticular reasons, would be displeased at it; but that immediately\r\nafter the delivery he acquainted James thereof, and sent him a copy\r\nof it, and at the same time represented to him the absolute necessity\r\nof keeping it secret. Notwithstanding this injunction, Colonel Hay\r\nsent a copy of it to the Bishop of Rochester, and Mar attributes the\r\nbad feeling which Atterbury afterwards displayed towards him, to the\r\nproposal he made for restoring Scotland to her independence.\r\n\r\nThe memorial was presented by Mar to the Duke of Orleans in\r\nSeptember, 1723; but so little secrecy was observed, that, in the\r\nmonth of January following, a statement appeared in the public\r\nnewspapers, that a certain peer, then in Paris, had laid a plan\r\nbefore the regent for restoring the exiled family. Though the\r\nBritish government must have been aware, or at all events must have\r\nsuspected, after such a notification, that Mar was the author of the\r\nscheme, his pension was still continued, and they even favoured him\r\nstill more by allowing the family estate, which was exposed to sale,\r\nto fall again into the hands of the family on favourable terms.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the whole circumstances of Mar’s conduct, evolved by\r\nAtterbury’s charges, it must be admitted that his justification is\r\nfar from being complete. From the position in which he placed himself\r\nas a debtor of Stair, and a pensioner of the British government, he\r\ncould no longer be trusted with safety by his Jacobite colleagues,\r\nand as he had come under an obligation, as a condition of his\r\npension, not to act in behalf of the Stuarts, he was bound in honour\r\nto have abstained from all farther interference in their affairs;\r\nbut for reasons only known to himself, he continued to act as if no\r\nalteration of his relations with the exiled family had taken place\r\nsince he was first intrusted by them. Selfish in his disposition, and\r\nregardless whether the Chevalier de St. George, or the Elector of\r\nHanover wore the crown, provided his ambition was gratified, it is\r\nprobable, that, without harbouring any intention to betray, he wished\r\nto preserve an appearance of promoting the interests of the Stuarts,\r\nin order that the compact which he had entered into with the British\r\ngovernment, might, in the event of a restoration of that family, form\r\nno bar to his advancement under a new order of things; but whatever\r\nwere his views or motives, his design, if he entertained any such as\r\nhas been supposed, was frustrated by his disgrace in 1725.\r\n\r\nThe breach with Mar was looked upon by some of the Jacobites as a\r\nrash act on the part of the Chevalier, and they considered that he\r\nhad been sacrificed to gratify Colonel Hay, between whom and Mar an\r\nirreconcilable difference had for some time existed. This opinion had\r\na pernicious influence upon the councils of the Chevalier, and to the\r\nrupture with Mar may be attributed the _denouement_ of an unhappy\r\ndifference between James and his consort, which, for a time, fixed\r\nthe attention of all the European courts.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1720 the Chevalier de St. George had espoused the\r\nPrincess Clementina, granddaughter of John Sobieski, king of Poland,\r\nwho had born him two sons, viz. Charles Edward, celebrated for his\r\nexploits in 1745, and Henry Benedict, afterwards known as Cardinal\r\nYork.[774] Prince Charles was placed under the tuition of one Mrs.\r\nSheldon, who, it is said, obtained a complete ascendency over the\r\nPrincess Clementina. As alleged by the partisans of Colonel Hay, she\r\nwas entirely devoted to Mar, and served him as a spy in the family.\r\nTo counteract the rising influence of Hay, she is represented to\r\nhave incited the princess against him to such a degree, as to render\r\nthe whole household a scene of constant disturbance. But whatever\r\nmay have been the conduct of Mrs. Sheldon, there is good reason for\r\nbelieving that the cause of irritation proceeded entirely from the\r\nbehaviour of Hay and his lady, who appear not to have treated the\r\nprincess with the respect due to her rank, and who, from the sway\r\nthey appear to have had over the mind of her husband, indulged in\r\nliberties which did not become them.\r\n\r\nTo relieve herself from the indignities which she alleged she\r\nsuffered, the princess resolved to retire into a convent, of which\r\nresolution the Chevalier first received notice from a confidante\r\nof the princess, who also informed him that nothing but the\r\ndismissal of Colonel Hay from his service would induce her to alter\r\nher resolution. The princess afterwards personally notified her\r\ndetermination to her husband, who remonstrated with her upon the\r\nimpropriety of a step which would prejudice them in the eyes of their\r\nfriends, and make their enemies triumph; but she remained inflexible.\r\n\r\nFinding the Chevalier fully determined to retain Colonel Hay in his\r\nservice, the princess made preparations for carrying her resolution\r\ninto effect; and, accordingly, on the morning of Thursday, the 15th\r\nof November, 1725, under the pretence of taking an airing in her\r\ncarriage, she drove off to the convent of St. Cecilia, at Rome, into\r\nwhich she retired, without taking any notice of a long letter, by way\r\nof remonstrance, which her husband had written her on the 11th.[775]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier was anxious that his friends should form a favourable\r\nopinion of the course he had adopted in resisting the demand of\r\nhis wife; and, accordingly, on the morning after her departure,\r\nhe assembled all his household, and explained to them fully the\r\ndifferent steps he had taken to prevent the extraordinary proceeding\r\nof the princess. He also entered into a justification of his own\r\nconduct, and concluded by assuring them that it should be his\r\nprincipal care to educate his two sons in such a manner as might\r\ncontribute one day to the happiness of the people he expected to\r\ngovern. With the same view, he immediately despatched copies of\r\nthe memoir, and of the two letters he had written to the princess,\r\nto Mr. Lockhart, to be shown to his friends in Scotland; but as\r\nthe memoir and letters had been made public, copies of them were\r\npublicly hawked through the streets of London and Edinburgh, with a\r\nscurrilous introduction, several weeks before Mr. Lockhart received\r\nhis communication. This was done apparently with the approbation of\r\nthe government, as the magistrates of Edinburgh compelled the porters\r\nof the city to cry the papers through the streets.[776] At first,\r\nthe Jacobites imagined that these documents were forgeries got up\r\nby the government, to make the Jacobite cause contemptible in the\r\neyes of the people; but they were soon undeceived, and great was\r\ntheir consternation when they found that the papers in question were\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\nThe court of Rome seemed to approve of the Chevalier’s conduct in\r\nrefusing to remove Hay; but when it was understood that the removal\r\nof Murray, the young princes’ governor, was considered by their\r\nmother even of more importance than the dismissal of Hay, the pope\r\nsent a message to James, intimating that if Murray were removed\r\nand Mrs. Sheldon restored to favour, a reconciliation might be\r\neffected with the princess,--that, however, he would not insist on\r\nMrs. Sheldon being taken back, but that he could not approve of\r\nnor consent to Murray being about the prince. The Chevalier did\r\nnot relish such interference, and returned for answer, that he had\r\nno occasion for the pope’s advice, and that he did not consider\r\nhis consent necessary in an affair which related to the private\r\nconcerns of his family. As James was the pensioner of his holiness,\r\nthe answer may be considered rather uncourteous, but the Chevalier\r\nlooked upon such meddling as an insult which his dignity could not\r\nbrook. The pope, however, renewed his application to bring about\r\na reconciliation, and with such earnestness, that James became so\r\nuneasy as to express a wish to retire from his dominions.[777] By\r\nthe efforts, however, it is believed, of the princess’s friends,\r\naided by the repeated remonstrances of a respectable portion of\r\nthe Jacobites, the Chevalier at length reluctantly dismissed Hay\r\nfrom his service. According to Mr. Lockhart, Hay and his wife had\r\nobtained such a complete ascendency over the Chevalier, that they\r\nhad the direction of all matters, whether public or domestic, and\r\ntaking advantage of the confidence which he reposed in them, they\r\ninstilled into his mind unfavourable impressions of his best\r\nfriends. By insinuating that the princess, and every person that did\r\nnot truckle to them, were factious, and that their complaints against\r\nthe colonel and his lady proceeded from a feeling of disrespect to\r\nhimself, his temper became by degrees soured towards his wife. To\r\nescape from the insolence of these favourites, the princess, as has\r\nbeen seen, embraced, for a time, a conventual life; and while some\r\nof the Chevalier’s adherents, who had lost their estates in his\r\nservice, left his court in disgust, others were ordered away. It was\r\ncurrently reported at the time that Mrs. Hay was the king’s mistress,\r\nand that jealousy on the part of the Princess Clementina was the\r\ncause of the rupture; the princess herself in her letters distinctly\r\nspeaks of Mrs. Hay as “the king’s mistress,” although persons who had\r\nample opportunities of observation could observe no impropriety. The\r\npertinacity with which James clung to his unworthy favourites tended\r\ngreatly to injure his affairs.[778]\r\n\r\nThe death of George I., which took place on Sunday, the 11th June,\r\n1727, while on his journey to Hanover, raised anew the hopes of the\r\nChevalier. He was at Bologna when this intelligence reached him,\r\nand so anxious was he to be nearer England to watch the progress\r\nof events, and to be ready to avail himself of the services of his\r\nfriends in Britain to effect his restoration, that he left Bologna\r\nprivately for Lorraine, the day after the news was brought him,\r\nalthough the princess, who had just left the convent, by the advice\r\nof her friends, was at the time on her way from Rome to Bologna\r\nto join him. The journey of the princess being publicly known,\r\nthe Chevalier availed himself of the circumstance to conceal his\r\nreal design, by giving out that he had left Bologna to meet her.\r\nOn arriving at Nancy, the Chevalier despatched couriers to Vienna,\r\nMadrid, and Paris, announcing the object of his journey, and at\r\nthe same time sent a messenger with a letter to Mr. Lockhart, who,\r\nin consequence of a warrant being issued by the British government\r\nfor his apprehension, had a few months before taken refuge on the\r\ncontinent, and was then residing at Liege. Although he expected no\r\nassistance from any foreign power, still, he says, “the present\r\nconjuncture appears so favourable in all its circumstances that had\r\nI only consulted my own inclinations, I should certainly out of hand\r\nhave crossed the seas, and seen at any rate what I could do for my\r\nown and my subjects’ delivery; but as on this occasion I act for\r\nthem as well as myself, and cannot hope without their concurrence to\r\nsucceed in what I may undertake in our mutual behalf, I find myself\r\nunder the necessity of making no further steps without their advice.\r\n\r\n“’Tis true the disadvantages I lie under are great and many; I have\r\nbut a small stock of money, scarce sufficient to transport what\r\nfew arms I have and what officers I may get to follow me on this\r\noccasion. I’m sensible that it is next to impossible that a concert\r\nshould be established amongst my friends at home, such as would be\r\nsufficient for a rising in arms in my favour before my arrival,\r\nand by what is said before, the little hopes of foreign assistance\r\nwill be sufficiently seen; but with all this, many arguments may be\r\nbrought to authorise an undertaking which at first sight might appear\r\nrash.... All put together it must be concluded that if the present\r\nconjuncture is slip’d, it cannot be expected that we ever can have\r\nso favorable a one for acting by ourselves, and that we run the\r\nrisk of allowing the general affairs of Europe to be less favorable\r\nto us than they are at present; so that whatever is not absolutely\r\ndesperate ought certainly to be undertaken, and the sooner the better.\r\n\r\n“I desire therefore you may think seriously on this matter, and\r\nlet me have your opinion as soon as possible, and if my going into\r\nEngland be not adviseable, whether my going to the Highlands of\r\nScotland might not be found proper.” To this letter is appended the\r\nfollowing postscript in James’s own handwriting. “The contents of\r\nthis will show you the confidence I have in you, and I expect you\r\nwill let me know by the bearer, (Allan Cameron,) your advice and\r\nopinion, particularly on this important occasion.”[779]\r\n\r\nFrom Cameron Mr. Lockhart was surprised to learn that the Chevalier,\r\nnotwithstanding his certainty that he could look for no foreign\r\naid, and that his friends, both in Scotland and England, had made no\r\npreparations to receive him, was not only inclined, but seemed even\r\nresolved, to repair to the Highlands of Scotland, and there raise the\r\nstandard of insurrection, and that Colonel Hay, whom he had so lately\r\ndiscarded, was one of his counsellors on the occasion. As Cameron,\r\nwho had visited the Highlands some time before, and was well aware\r\nof the almost insuperable difficulties which opposed themselves to\r\nthe contemplated step, seemed to approve of the Chevalier’s design,\r\nMr. Lockhart expressed his wonder that one who knew the state of the\r\nHighlands so well, and the determination generally of the Highlanders\r\nnot to take the field again till they saw England actually engaged,\r\ncould advise his master to risk his person, and expose the country\r\nand his friends to certain destruction. He observed, that there were\r\nindeed some persons who would venture their all in any attempt headed\r\nby the Chevalier in person, but as matters then stood, the number of\r\nsuch persons would be few, and that the great majority of those that\r\nmight be expected to join him would consist of idle persons, actuated\r\nsolely by the hopes of plunder, who would abandon him eventually to\r\nthe mercy of the government troops that would be poured into the\r\nHighlands, and that, under the pretence of punishing the few who\r\nhad taken up arms, they would ravage the country and cut off the\r\ninhabitants, for doing which the government only wanted such a handle.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these sentiments, Mr. Lockhart represented in his\r\nanswer to the Chevalier’s letter, that the design he contemplated\r\nwas one of the greatest importance, and though it was very proper\r\nfor him to put himself in a condition to avail himself of any\r\nfavourable circumstances that might occur, yet that appearances did\r\nnot warrant such expectations,--that the people of England seemed to\r\nhave forgot all the grievances under which they had laboured during\r\nthe late reign, in hope of a better order of things, and that until\r\nthey found themselves disappointed, he could expect nothing from\r\nthem,--that with regard to such of the people of Scotland as were\r\nfavourably disposed, they could not possibly do any thing without\r\nbeing previously provided with many material things they stood in\r\nneed of, and that before these could be supplied, many difficulties\r\nhad to be surmounted and much time would be lost, during which\r\npreparations would be made on all hands to crush them,--that although\r\nit would be of advantage to strike a blow before the government had\r\ntime to strengthen itself at home and abroad, yet the attempt was not\r\nadvisable without necessary precautions and provisions to insure its\r\nsuccess, as without these such an attempt would be desperate, and\r\nmight ruin the cause for ever,--that no man living would be happier\r\nthan he (Mr. Lockhart) to see the dawning of a fair day, but when\r\nevery point of the compass was black and cloudy, he could not but\r\ndread very bad weather, and such as could give no encouragement to a\r\ntraveller to proceed on his voyage, and might prove the utter ruin\r\nof himself and attendants.[780] This judicious advice was not thrown\r\naway upon the Chevalier, who at once laid aside his design of going\r\nto Scotland, and retired to Avignon, where he proposed to reside\r\nunder the protection of the pope; but his stay at Avignon was short,\r\nbeing obliged to leave that place in consequence, it is believed, of\r\nthe representations of the French government to the court of Rome. He\r\nreturned to Italy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[745] _Annals of the 2d year of George I._, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[746] _State Trials_, vol. xv.\r\n\r\n[747] “It is painful to see on the lists, the many Highland names\r\nfollowed with the word ‘labourer,’ indicating that they belonged to\r\nthe humblest class.

But\r\nhowever willing Spain might be to assist him, he was desirous that\r\nno attempt should be made without the concurrence of France.[781]\r\nAbout the same time, that is, in the beginning of the year 1740, some\r\nof the more zealous and leading Jacobites, in anticipation of a war\r\nwith France, held a meeting at Edinburgh, and formed themselves into\r\nan association, by which they engaged themselves to take arms and\r\nventure their lives and fortunes to restore the family of Stuart,\r\nprovided the King of France would send over a body of troops to\r\ntheir assistance. The association, like that which brought over King\r\nWilliam to England, consisted of seven persons, viz., Lord Lovat,\r\nJames Drummond, commonly called Duke of Perth, the Earl of Traquair,\r\nSir James Campbell of Auchinbreck, Cameron of Lochiel, John Stuart,\r\nbrother to Lord Traquair, and Lord John Drummond, uncle to the Duke\r\nof Perth.[782] The conspirators despatched Drummond of Bochaldy, or\r\nBalhady, (nephew to Lochiel,) to Rome with the bond of association,\r\nand a list of those chiefs and chieftains who were considered by the\r\nassociates to be favourable to the cause. Drummond was instructed to\r\ndeliver these papers into the hands of the Chevalier de St. George,\r\nand to entreat him to procure assistance from France in furtherance\r\nof their design. The project was well received by James, who, after\r\nperusing the papers, forwarded them immediately by the same messenger\r\nto Cardinal Fleury at Paris, with a request that the court of France\r\nwould grant the required assistance. But the cardinal, with that\r\ncaution which distinguished him, would come under no engagement, but\r\ncontented himself at first by a general assurance of conditional\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation was, however, persevered in, but the death of the\r\nEmperor Charles VI., which happened on the 20th of October, drew off\r\nthe cardinal’s attention to matters which appeared to him of greater\r\nimportance. The emperor was succeeded in his hereditary dominions\r\nby his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, married to the Grand-duke of\r\nTuscany, formerly Duke of Lorraine. Though this princess succeeded\r\nunder the title of the pragmatic sanction, which had been guaranteed\r\nby England, France, Spain, Prussia, Russia, Holland, and the whole of\r\nthe Germanic body, with the exception of the elector-palatine, and\r\nthe electors of Bavaria and Saxony, a powerful confederacy was formed\r\nagainst her by almost all these powers, to strip her of her dominions.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the formidable confederacy formed against her, the Queen\r\nof Hungary applied to Great Britain for succour; but Sir Robert\r\nWalpole evaded the demand, and recommended an immediate peace\r\nwith Prussia. The parliament, as well as the nation, however, had\r\ndifferent views; and as the minister saw that he would be compelled\r\nto fulfil his engagements to the house of Austria, parliament was\r\ncalled upon to support the Queen of Hungary, and maintain the\r\nliberties of Europe. The commons cheerfully voted a sum of £300,000\r\nto enable George II. to fulfil his engagements, which sum was\r\nremitted to the Queen of Hungary, and the contingent of 12,000 Danish\r\nand Hessian troops, which Great Britain had engaged to furnish, was\r\ngot in readiness.\r\n\r\nWhile the flames of war were thus spreading over Europe, the\r\nsituation of the British ministry was every day becoming more\r\ncritical from the clamours of the Tories and the discontented Whigs.\r\nWalpole had triumphed in both houses on motions for an address to\r\nthe king to dismiss him from his presence and councils; but his\r\ntriumph was short, and the approach of an election redoubled the\r\nefforts of his enemies. Though the Jacobites required no incentive\r\nto induce them to assist in displacing a minister who had been the\r\nchief obstacle to the restoration of the exiled family; yet to make\r\nperfectly sure of their aid, Lord Chesterfield went to France, and by\r\nmeans of the Duke of Ormond, obtained, it is said, a circular letter\r\nfrom the Chevalier de St. George to his friends, urging them to do\r\nevery thing in their power to ruin Walpole. To encourage the popular\r\nclamour against the minister, reports, the most absurd and incredible\r\nrespecting him, were circulated among the people and believed;\r\nand while the general discontent was at its height, the election\r\ncommenced. The contests between the two parties were extremely\r\nviolent; but the country party, backed by the adherents of the Prince\r\nof Wales, who had formed a party against the minister, prevailed.\r\nSo powerful was the influence of the Duke of Argyle, who had lately\r\njoined the opposition, that out of the forty-five members returned\r\nfor Scotland, the friends of the ministry could not secure above six.\r\nThe new parliament met on the 4th of December, 1741; and Walpole, no\r\nlonger able to contend with the forces arrayed against him, retired\r\nfrom office within a few weeks thereafter.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by appearances, and imagining that some of the old\r\ndiscontented Whigs who deprecated the system which had been pursued\r\nsince the accession of the house of Hanover, of maintaining the\r\nforeign dominions of the sovereign at the expense, as they thought,\r\nof the honour and interests of the nation, Drummond of Bochaldy\r\nproposed to the Chevalier to visit England, and make overtures in\r\nhis name to the “old Whigs.”[783] This plan was highly approved of\r\nby James, who wrote him a letter in his own hand, which was intended\r\nto be exhibited to such persons as might seem inclined to favour his\r\nrestoration. This letter was inclosed in a private letter containing\r\ninstructions for the regulation of his conduct in the proposed\r\nnegotiation, which it was intended should be kept an entire secret\r\nfrom the Jacobites, both in England and Scotland. Erskine of Grange,\r\nwho enjoyed the confidence of some of the discontented Whigs, and who\r\nprivately favoured the designs of the exiled family, was pitched upon\r\nas a fit person to make advances to the old Whigs.[784]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his instructions, Drummond departed for England\r\nabout the beginning of the year 1742, but it does not appear that\r\nat this time he entered upon the subject of his mission. He came\r\nprivately to Edinburgh in the month of February, and there met some\r\nof the persons who had entered into the association, and several\r\nothers, who, in conjunction with the original conspirators, had\r\nformed themselves into a society, denominated by them “the Concert\r\nof Gentlemen for managing the King’s affairs in Scotland.” To these,\r\namong whom was Murray of Broughton, Drummond represented that, on his\r\nreturn from Rome, he had been extremely well received by Cardinal\r\nFleury, to whom he had delivered the papers which he had carried\r\nfrom Edinburgh,--that the cardinal expressed great satisfaction\r\nwith the contents of these papers, had the Pretender’s interest so\r\nmuch at heart, and was so sanguine of his success, that provided he\r\nhad sufficient assurances from the friends of the exiled family in\r\nEngland, that they would assist in the restoration of the Stuarts,\r\nhe would send over an army of from 13,000 to 15,000 men, the number\r\nrequired. One division of this force, consisting of 1,500 men, was\r\nto be landed on the east coast of Scotland, at or near Inverness;\r\nanother of a similar amount in the west Highlands of Scotland; and\r\nthe main body, which was to consist of 10,000 or 12,000 men, was\r\nto be landed as near London as possible. He added, that, provided\r\nassistance could be obtained in England, the projected invasion might\r\nbe put in execution the following autumn. Before leaving Edinburgh,\r\nDrummond had an interview with Cameron of Lochiel, who came to town\r\nat his desire, and to whom he communicated the result of his mission\r\nto Rome and Paris.[785]\r\n\r\nAfter a short stay at Edinburgh, Drummond returned to Paris, where,\r\naccording to his own account, as communicated in letters to Lord\r\nTraquair and Lochiel, he had an audience of the cardinal, to whom\r\nhe represented matters in such a favourable light that he promised\r\nto carry his design of invasion into effect in a very short time.\r\nThe French minister, however, though he appears to have seriously\r\ncontemplated such a step, was not yet in a condition to come to\r\nan open rupture with England; and to postpone the enterprise, he\r\nproposed to Drummond that an application should be made to Sweden\r\nfor a body of troops to invade Scotland, and that a person from\r\nScotland, along with another person from France whom the cardinal\r\nwould appoint, should be sent thither to urge the application at the\r\nSwedish court. The cardinal gave as his reason for thus deviating\r\nfrom his original plan, that the Swedes being Protestants, would be\r\nmore agreeable to the people of Scotland than French or Irish troops.\r\nIn accordance with this proposal, Lord Traquair suggested that Murray\r\nof Broughton should be sent to Sweden on the proposed mission, but he\r\ndeclined.[786]\r\n\r\nFrom the turn which the affair of the invasion had now taken, and\r\nthe time when it was expected to take place being allowed to elapse\r\nwithout any preparations on the part of France, a suspicion began\r\nto be entertained by the members of the Concert, that the cardinal\r\nnever had any intention to invade Scotland, and that the whole was a\r\nscheme of Drummond’s to keep alive the spirit of party in Scotland,\r\nand to make himself pass for useful in the eyes of his employers.\r\nTo ascertain the real state of the case, Murray of Broughton, at\r\nthe suggestion of Lord Traquair, was sent to Paris in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1743. He took London on his way, but before he reached the\r\ncapital, he heard of the death of Cardinal Fleury. After staying\r\na short time in London, Murray went privately to Paris, where he\r\nmet Drummond and Sempil, who managed the Chevalier’s affairs in\r\nFrance. They stated to him, that in all probability the scheme of\r\ninvasion would have been carried into effect, had not the army of\r\nMarshal Maillebois been sent towards Hanover instead of the coast of\r\nFlanders, as at first intended; and that from the interest taken by\r\nthe cardinal in the affairs of the Stuarts, he had put all the papers\r\nrelating to them into the hands of Monsieur Amelot, the secretary for\r\nforeign affairs.[787]\r\n\r\nAt an audience which Murray afterwards had with Monsieur Amelot\r\nat Versailles, the foreign secretary told him that, on being\r\nmade acquainted by Sempil with the cause of Murray’s journey, he\r\nhad informed the King of France of it, and that his majesty had\r\nauthorised him to assure Mr. Murray that he had the interest of\r\nthe Stuart family as much at heart as any of the gentlemen who had\r\nsigned the memorial of association, and that as soon as he had an\r\nopportunity he would put the scheme into execution.[788]\r\n\r\nShortly after this interview, Murray left Paris for London,\r\naccompanied by Drummond, who came over to obtain the assurances\r\nrequired by the French court from the English Tories and Jacobites.\r\nAfter remaining a few days in London, Murray returned to Edinburgh,\r\nto report to his friends the result of his mission. Drummond stopped\r\nat London, where he met Mr. Erskine of Grange,[789] but although\r\novertures were then, it is believed, made to Lord Barrymore, Sir\r\nJohn Hynde Cotton, and Sir Watkin Williams Wynne, they declined to\r\ngive any assurance or promise of support in writing. By desire of\r\nDrummond, Lord Traquair met him in London shortly after his arrival\r\nto assist him in his negotiations.[790]\r\n\r\nAt first view it may appear singular, and the circumstances must\r\nconvey a very sorry idea of the councils of the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge, that a person of so little weight and influence as Drummond,\r\nwho was utterly unknown to the English Tories and Jacobites,\r\nshould have been sent on such an important mission; but when it\r\nis considered that some of the leading Jacobites were proscribed\r\nand in exile, and that those at home were strictly watched by the\r\ngovernment, and were therefore afraid to commit themselves by any\r\novert act, it cannot excite surprise that the Chevalier availed\r\nhimself of the services of one whom he considered “an honest and\r\nsensible man.”[791] Drummond was, however, considered, even by his\r\noriginal employers, as a person unfit to execute the trust reposed\r\nin him, and Lord John Drummond, one of the seven who had signed the\r\nassociation, was quite indignant when he found him engaged in the\r\nmission to England.[792] Nor was Sempil, between whom and Drummond a\r\nclose intimacy subsisted, more acceptable to the Scottish Jacobites,\r\nsome of whom he offended by his forwardness.[793]\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the year 1743, the French ministry were\r\ntoo much occupied with the war in Germany to pay much attention\r\nto the affairs of the Stuarts; but towards the close of that year\r\nthey began to meditate an invasion of Great Britain. The British\r\nparliament met in the beginning of December, when a motion was made\r\nin the house of peers by the Earl of Sandwich, for an address to\r\nthe crown to discontinue the Hanoverian troops in British pay, in\r\norder to remove the national discontent, which was represented to\r\nbe so violent, that nothing but their dismission could appease it.\r\nThe motion was negatived, but renewed in another shape on the army\r\nestimates being brought forward, when it shared the same fate. The\r\nattention of the French ministry being drawn to these and similar\r\ndiscussions, and to the general dissatisfaction which seemed to\r\npervade the people of Great Britain, by the agents and partizans\r\nof the exiled family, backed by the influence of Cardinal Tencin,\r\nentered upon the project of an invasion in good earnest. The\r\ncardinal, who now had great influence in the councils of France,\r\nhad, while a resident at Rome, been particularly noticed by the\r\nChevalier de St. George, by whose influence he had been raised to\r\nthe cardinalate, and he was moved as much by gratitude to his patron\r\nas by ambition to bring about the restoration of the Stuarts. The\r\ncourt of Versailles, indeed, required little inducement to engage\r\nin an enterprise which, whether it succeeded or not, would at all\r\nevents operate as a diversion in favour of France in her contest\r\nwith the house of Austria, whose chief support was Great Britain;\r\nbut it is not improbable that they at this time contemplated a more\r\nserious attempt. In intimating, however, his resolution to undertake\r\nthe expedition, the King of France notified to the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge that it was to be kept a profound secret, and that neither the\r\nDuke of Ormond nor Lord Marischal should be told, till the enterprise\r\nwas ready to be put into execution.\r\n\r\nThe command of the troops designed for this expedition, amounting to\r\n15,000 men, was given to the celebrated Marshal Saxe; and the naval\r\npart, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, besides transports,\r\ncollected at Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne, was intrusted to Monsieur\r\nde Roquefeuille, an officer of considerable experience and capacity.\r\nThis force was destined for the coast of Kent, and a smaller force\r\nwas to be landed in Scotland under the command of Lord Marischal.\r\n\r\nWhile the preparations for the expedition were going on, Cardinal\r\nTencin kept up an active correspondence with the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge. As James felt rather disinclined to accompany the expedition\r\nhimself, he proposed that his eldest son, Charles, then in his\r\ntwenty-third year, should go in his stead; but as it was doubtful\r\nwhether the prince would arrive in time to join the expedition,\r\nthe Chevalier sent an express to the Duke of Ormond requesting\r\nhim to accompany the expedition, and to act as regent, by virtue\r\nof a commission of regency formerly granted him, until the prince\r\nshould arrive. On arriving in England, the duke was directed to\r\nadvise with the principal friends of the family, among whom he\r\nparticularly enumerated the Duke of Beaufort, the Earls of Barrymore,\r\nWestmoreland, and Orrery, Lord Cobham, and Sirs Watkin Williams\r\nWynne, John Hynde Cotton, and Robert Abdy. Having obtained the\r\nconsent of the French court to this arrangement, the cardinal, upon\r\nthe completion of the preparations for the expedition, despatched\r\na messenger to Rome to request the attendance of the young prince\r\nat Paris. Accordingly, on the morning of the 9th of January, 1744,\r\nPrince Charles, accompanied by his brother Henry and two or three\r\nattendants, left Rome before break of day, but they had not proceeded\r\nfar when they parted, the prince on his route to France and the duke\r\nto Cisterna.[794] The former was disguised as a Spanish courier, and\r\ntook only one servant along with him on his journey. To account for\r\nthe departure of the two brothers, it was given out at Rome that they\r\nhad gone to a boar hunt, and so well was the secret of the prince’s\r\nreal destination kept, that nearly a fortnight elapsed before it was\r\ndiscovered.[795]\r\n\r\nProvided with passports furnished by Cardinal Aquaviva, the prince\r\ntravelled through Tuscany and arrived at Genoa. From Genoa he\r\nproceeded to Savona, where he embarked in a felucca, and passing by\r\nMonaco arrived at Antibes. From the latter place he proceeded to\r\nParis, where he met Marshal Saxe and other officers belonging to\r\nthe expedition, and after a private audience of the French king, he\r\nset out incognito for the coast of Picardy. The route by Genoa and\r\nAntibes was selected as the safest, and, from the season of the year,\r\nthe most expeditious; but so unfavourable was the weather, that the\r\nprince had to stop some days at different places, and when he reached\r\nAntibes he was recognised, and information of his arrival there and\r\nof his departure for Paris was sent to the British government by\r\npersons in its interest. Hitherto the British ministry do not appear\r\nto have had any suspicion that the armaments at Brest, Boulogne, and\r\nother French ports, were destined for the shores of Britain, but\r\nthe appearance of the eldest son of the Chevalier de St. George in\r\nFrance opened their eyes to the dangers which now menaced them. At\r\nthis time the military force in England did not exceed 6,000 men, so\r\nthat if the threatened invasion had taken place, the result might\r\nhave been disastrous to the reigning family.[796]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the French fleet, consisting of 15 ships of the line and\r\n5 frigates, under M. de Roquefeuille, sailed from Brest, and for\r\nseveral days displayed itself in the channel. Knowing the object\r\nfor which these ships had put to sea, the government was greatly\r\nalarmed, and not without cause; for, besides the paucity of troops\r\nin the island, they had only six ships of the line at home ready for\r\nsea, the grand fleet being then in the Mediterranean. The activity\r\nand preparations of the government corresponded with the magnitude\r\nof the danger with which it was threatened. Orders were instantly\r\nsent to fit out and man all the ships of war in the different ports\r\nof the channel. These orders were so promptly obeyed, that in a few\r\ndays an English fleet of three ships of 100 guns, four of 90, six\r\nof 70, and six of 50, was collected at Spithead under the command\r\nof Sir John Norris.[797] Several regiments were immediately marched\r\nto the southern coast of England; all governors and commanders were\r\nordered to repair forthwith to their respective posts; the forts at\r\nthe mouth of the Thames and Medway were put in a posture of defence;\r\nand the militia of Kent were directed to assemble to defend the coast\r\nin case of an invasion. On the 15th of February, the arrival of\r\nPrince Charles in France, the preparations along the French coast,\r\nand the appearance of the French fleet in the English channel, were\r\nannounced to parliament in a message from the king. Both houses\r\njoined in an address, in which they declared their indignation at\r\nthe design formed in favour of “a popish pretender,” and assured\r\nhis majesty they would take measures to frustrate so desperate and\r\ninsolent an attempt. The city of London, the universities of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge,[798] the principal towns in Great Britain, almost all\r\nthe corporations and communities of the kingdom, the clergy of the\r\nestablishment, the dissenting ministers, and the Quakers, or Society\r\nof Friends, presented similar addresses. A demand was made from the\r\nStates-general of the 6,000 auxiliaries which by treaty they had\r\nengaged to furnish on such occasions; and this force was immediately\r\ngranted. Forgetful of the wrongs which he had suffered at the hands\r\nof the government, the Earl of Stair tendered his services, and\r\nwas reappointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Great Britain.\r\nSeveral noblemen of the first rank followed his example, among whom\r\nwas the Duke of Montague, who was permitted to raise a regiment\r\nof horse. Orders were sent to bring over the 6,000 British troops\r\nfrom Flanders; and both houses of parliament, in a second address,\r\nexhorted the king to augment his forces by sea and land, in such\r\nmanner as he should think necessary at this dangerous juncture of\r\naffairs. The habeas corpus act was suspended for six months; several\r\nsuspected persons were taken into custody; the usual proclamation\r\nwas issued for putting the laws in execution against the unfortunate\r\nCatholics and nonjurors, who were ordered to retire ten miles\r\nfrom London; and every other precaution, deemed necessary for the\r\npreservation of the public tranquillity, was adopted.[799]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the preparations for invasion were proceeding rapidly at\r\nBoulogne and Dunkirk, under the eye of Prince Charles. Roquefeuille\r\nhad in his excursion in the channel come in sight of Spithead; and,\r\nas he could perceive no ships there, he imagined that the English\r\nships had retired within their harbours. Judging the opportunity\r\nfavourable, he detached M. de Barriel with five ships of war to\r\nhasten the embarkation at Dunkirk, and to order the transports\r\nthereupon to put to sea. Roquefeuille then sailed up the channel\r\nwith the remainder of his fleet as far as Dungeness, a promontory on\r\nthe coast of Kent, off which he anchored to await the arrival of the\r\ntransports. Having received intelligence of Roquefeuille’s arrival\r\nfrom an English frigate which came into the Downs, Sir John Norris\r\nleft Spithead with the British fleet, and doubling the South Foreland\r\nfrom the Downs, on the 23d of February discovered the French fleet\r\nat anchor. Though the wind was against him, Sir John endeavoured,\r\nby availing himself of the tide, to come up and engage the French\r\nsquadron; but the tide failing, he was obliged to anchor when\r\nabout two leagues from the enemy. He intended to attack them next\r\nmorning, but M. de Roquefeuille, not judging it advisable to risk\r\nan engagement, weighed anchor after sunset, and favoured by a hard\r\ngale of wind from the north-east which blew during the night, ran\r\ndown the channel and got into Brest harbour. So violent was the gale,\r\nthat all the English fleet (two ships only excepted,) parted with\r\ntheir cables and were driven out to sea, and before they could have\r\nreturned to their station, the transports, under convoy of the five\r\nships of war despatched by Roquefeuille, might have disembarked the\r\narmy under Marshal Saxe had the storm not reached the French coast;\r\nbut the tempest, which merely forced the English ships to quit their\r\nmoorings, was destructive to the expedition, and utterly disconcerted\r\nthe design of invading England.\r\n\r\nOn the very day on which the two fleets discovered each other,\r\nMarshal Saxe, accompanied by Charles Edward, arrived at Dunkirk, and\r\nproceeded to get his troops embarked as fast as possible; 7,000 men\r\nwere actually shipped, and proceeded to sea that day with a fair\r\nwind, but in the evening the wind changed to the east, and blew a\r\nhurricane. The embarkation ceased, several of the transports which\r\nhad put to sea were wrecked, many soldiers and seamen perished, and\r\na considerable quantity of warlike stores was lost. The remainder of\r\nthe transports were damaged to such an extent that they could not be\r\nspeedily repaired.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of an expedition planned with great judgment\r\nand conducted with such secrecy as to have escaped the vigilance\r\nof the government till on the very eve of its being carried into\r\nexecution. After the discomfiture it had met with from the elements,\r\nand the formidable attitude which England, aroused to a sense of the\r\nimminent danger she was in, had now assumed, the French court must\r\nhave instantly abandoned, as it is believed it did abandon, any idea\r\nof renewing the enterprise; but Charles Edward, sanguine of success,\r\nand in no shape discouraged by the catastrophe which had happened,\r\ndaily importuned Marshal Saxe to re-embark his troops and proceed to\r\nEngland; but the marshal excused himself, by urging the necessity of\r\nfresh instructions from court and the previous repair of the damaged\r\ntransports.[800] The French ministry, however, finally resolved to\r\npostpone the expedition.\r\n\r\nAlthough war may be said to have virtually commenced between Great\r\nBritain and France by the battle of Dettingen, which was fought\r\nbetween the allies and the French in the month of June, 1743, no\r\nformal declaration of war was issued by either power till the month\r\nof March following, after the expedition against England had been\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure and abandonment of the enterprise, Prince Charles\r\nretired to Gravelines, where he lived several months in private,\r\nunder the assumed name of the Chevalier Douglas. Ever since his\r\narrival in France he had been forced by the French court to preserve\r\nan incognito, which, though highly approved of by Drummond and\r\nSempil, his father’s agents, was productive of great uneasiness to\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George, who could not understand the reason for\r\naffecting to conceal a fact which was notorious to all the world.[801]\r\n\r\nThe preparations for invasion had raised, not without foundation,\r\ngreat hopes of a restoration in the minds of the Scottish Jacobites;\r\nbut when they ascertained that the expedition was relinquished, they\r\nfelt all that bitterness of disappointment which the miscarriage\r\nof any cherished scheme is sure to engender. They did not however\r\ndespair of effecting their object ultimately, and, in the meantime,\r\nthe leading members of the Concert despatched a messenger to the\r\nprince to assure him of their attachment to his cause, and inform him\r\nof the state of the country and the dispositions of the people.[802]\r\nAbout the same time Murray of Broughton went to Paris, by advice of\r\nthe Earl of Traquair, to ascertain the exact situation of affairs.\r\nHere he was introduced to the prince by Drummond and Sempil. At\r\na private interview which he had with Charles the following day,\r\nMurray stated, that from the absurd and contradictory nature of the\r\ncommunications made by the prince’s agent at Paris, they had, as it\r\nappeared to him, a design to impose upon him with the intention of\r\nserving themselves. Charles alluded to the association which had\r\nbeen formed at Edinburgh, said that he did not doubt that the King\r\nof France intended to invade Britain in the ensuing spring,--that\r\nhe was already preparing for it, and intended to execute it as soon\r\nas the campaign in Flanders was over; but that whether the King of\r\nFrance undertook the expedition or not, he himself was determined to\r\ngo to Scotland. Murray, thereupon, endeavoured to show him that such\r\nan attempt would be desperate, as he could not at the utmost expect\r\nto be joined by more than 4,000 or 5,000 men; but notwithstanding\r\nMurray’s representations, Charles repeated his determination of going\r\nto Scotland. Murray says that he was so much against the undertaking,\r\nthat he spoke to Sir Thomas Sheridan--an Irish gentleman who enjoyed\r\nthe prince’s confidence--to endeavour to persuade him against it,\r\nand that Sir Thomas told him, on his arrival in Scotland, that he\r\nhad done so, but to no purpose. On returning to Scotland Murray\r\nreported to the members of the association all that had passed at\r\nthe conference with the prince; and all of them, except the Duke of\r\nPerth, declared themselves opposed to the prince’s resolution of\r\ncoming to Scotland without troops.[803] Murray then wrote a letter\r\nto Charles, stating the opinion of his friends, and representing the\r\nruinous consequences which might ensue from such a rash undertaking.\r\nThis letter was committed to the care of a gentleman who went to\r\nLondon in the month of January, 1745; but he neglected to forward\r\nit, and it was returned to Murray in the month of April. Murray made\r\nseveral attempts afterwards to forward the letter to France, and at\r\nlast succeeded; but it never came to the hands of the prince, who\r\ndeparted for Scotland before the letter reached its destination.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1745, the agents of the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge renewed their solicitations at the French court for another\r\nexpedition; but Louis and his ministers were too much occupied with\r\npreparations for the campaign in Flanders to pay much attention to\r\nsuch applications. They however continued to amuse the Jacobite\r\nnegotiators with assurances of conditional support; but James began\r\nto perceive that little or no reliance could be placed upon such\r\npromises. To relieve himself from the _ennui_ occasioned by the\r\nfailure of the expedition, and the state of seclusion in which he\r\nwas kept by the French government, and to obtain some knowledge of\r\nmilitary tactics, Charles applied for permission to make a campaign\r\nwith the French army in Flanders; but although he was warmly backed\r\nin his application by his father, Louis refused to accede to his\r\nwish. Though frustrated in his expectations of any immediate aid from\r\nFrance, and denied the trifling gratification of making a campaign,\r\nCharles manifested little of the restlessness and hauteur which he\r\nafterwards displayed on his return from Scotland. Though he had\r\nmuch reason, as he observed, “to be out of humour,” he resolved,\r\nnotwithstanding, to bear with patience the disappointments which he\r\nhad experienced.[804]\r\n\r\nTo ease his mind from the anxieties which pressed upon it, the Duke\r\nof Fitzjames and other friends of his family, invited the prince\r\nto pass the spring at their country-seats in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, where, amid the society of his friends and rural recreations,\r\nhe seemed, for a time, to forget the object for which he had come to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[781] Letters to the Duke of Ormond and Lord Marischal, 27th January,\r\n1740, among the _Stuart Papers_. Alluding to his expectations of\r\nassistance from France, the Chevalier, in a letter (of which a copy\r\nis also in the same collection,) written to Marischal on the 11th\r\nJanuary, 1740, while the latter was on his way to Madrid, says, “I am\r\nbetwixt hopes and fears, though I think there is more room for the\r\nfirst than the last, as you will have perceived by what Lord Sempil\r\n(so an active agent of James was called,) has I suppose writ to you.\r\nI conclude I shall sometime next month see clearer into these great\r\naffairs.”\r\n\r\n[782] Trial of Lord Lovat, p. 21. Home’s _Rebellion_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[783] This scheme was first broached by Drummond to Sempil, another\r\nactive agent of the Chevalier, and communicated by him to James, who\r\nsignified his approbation of it in a letter to Sempil, dated Nov.\r\n22, 1741. “I approve very much in general of our making application\r\nto the old Whigs, and take it as a new and great mark of Balhaldy’s\r\nzeal. The offer he makes of being instrumental in that measure, I\r\nperused with satisfaction. What you write on the subject, I shall\r\nconsider seriously on it betwixt this and next week; I shall by next\r\npost send you a packet for Balhaldy, with all that may appear proper\r\nand necessary for me on that particular.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[784] There is, among the _Stuart Papers_, a copy of a letter from\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George to Mr. Erskine, 13th March, 1740,\r\nthanking him for the zeal he had shown in his cause.\r\n\r\n[785] Lord Lovat’s Trial, p. 75.\r\n\r\n[786] Lord Lovat’s Trial, p. 76.\r\n\r\n[787] Idem.\r\n\r\n[788] Idem.\r\n\r\n[789] The Chevalier alludes to this meeting in a letter to Sempil,\r\n9th April, 1743; and in another of 16th May following, he mentions\r\na long paper which Mr. Erskine had sent him on the state of\r\naffairs.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[790] Letter from the Chevalier to Sempil, 24th May, 1743.--_Stuart\r\nPapers._\r\n\r\n[791] Letter to Sempil, 16th March, 1740,--_Stuart Papers_. Drummond\r\nwas not the only person employed by the Chevalier about this time\r\nto visit his friends in England. A Colonel Bret, and afterwards a\r\nColonel Cecil, with both of whom James corresponded, made frequent\r\njourneys to England. The Duchess of Buckingham made many unsolicited\r\ntrips to Paris to hasten Cardinal Fleury’s motions, but James was by\r\nno means satisfied with her officiousness. In writing to her on 20th\r\nJuly, 1741, he cautions her as follows:--“I must seriously recommend\r\nto you not to importune the old gentleman too much. When you have\r\ngiven him what lights and information have come to your knowledge,\r\nall the good is done, for in the present situation one would think he\r\nshould want no spur to befriend us, and in all events he will go on\r\nin his own way, while teazing him can serve for nothing but to make\r\nhim peevish and out of humour.” The duchess must have been possessed\r\nof some important papers, as James, in a letter to Sempil, (2d May,\r\n1743,) written shortly after her death, expresses his concern lest\r\nher papers should fall into the hands of the government.--_Stuart\r\nPapers._\r\n\r\n[792] Letter from Lord John to Secretary Edgar among the _Stuart\r\nPapers_, Feb. 25th, 1743.\r\n\r\n[793] Letter from Lord Marischal to Lord John Drummond.--_Stuart\r\nPapers_, Feb. 12th, 1743.\r\n\r\n[794] “My children,” says James in a letter to Sempil, 9th January,\r\n1744, “parted both this morning from hence before day, the duke for\r\nCisterna and the prince for his long journey. We have been at so much\r\npains and contrivance to cover it, that I hope the secret will be\r\nkept for some days, perhaps for several.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[795] Alluding to the discovery, James says, (letter to Sempil, 23d\r\nJanuary, 1744,) that it made “a great noise, as you may believe,\r\nhere,” viz. at Rome.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[796] About this time, if we may believe the accounts of the Stuart\r\nparty, the spirit of Jacobitism was widely diffused in Scotland. “The\r\nviolentest Whigs,” says Mr. John Stuart in a letter to Secretary\r\nEdgar from Boulogne, in February, 1744, “are become the most zealous\r\nJacobites. My friend says that the last night of the year with us\r\n(that is to say, the prince’s birth-night,) was celebrated there (in\r\nScotland) as publicly as we could do it here,--that he was himself in\r\na numerous company of people of fashion, amongst whom were several\r\nofficers of the army,--that the health of the day, the merry meeting,\r\nand a whole train of such, were drunk publicly,--that about the third\r\nhour, when the third bottle had banished all reserve, servants were\r\nturned out and the doors lockt, one of the company made a speech,\r\nand filled a bumper to the restoration, and damnation to every\r\none that would not help; the whole stood to their feet, drunk the\r\n(some words are here torn away in the original,) and their hands to\r\ntheir swords: the officers pulled the cockades out of their hats,\r\ntrampled them under feet, and then tossed them into the fire; then\r\ncalled for music, and serenaded the ladies with loyal tunes, songs,”\r\n&c.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[797] _Memoirs of Europe_, vol. ii. p. 197.\r\n\r\n[798] The Chevalier de St. George drew up an address to both\r\nuniversities. It bears the same date (23d December, 1743,) as\r\nthe two declarations published in 1745. This address was not\r\npublished.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[799] Smollett’s _History of England_, vol. iii. book ii. chap. 5.\r\n\r\n[800] The Marshal, in answer to a querulous note sent by the prince\r\non 11th of March, says in his answer on the 13th, “Vous ne pouvez,\r\nMonseigneur, accuser que les vents et la fortune des contretemps qui\r\nnous arrivent.” But he promises after the ships were refitted to\r\nproceed with the expedition.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[801] James, however, at first approved of the incognito. Writing\r\nto Sempil, on 10th March, 1744, he observes, “The prince will have\r\nbeen tired with his confinement; but, as matters stand, the French\r\ncourt was much in the right to keep him private, tho’ that will not,\r\nit is true, hinder the Elector of Hanover from taking the alarm, and\r\nhis measures against the invasion.” His views were different when\r\nwriting Drummond on 12th June. After complaining of the disagreeable\r\nway in which the prince had been employed on his first arrival at\r\nGravelines, (of which no particulars are given,) he continues, “I\r\nshall not be easy till I know the prince is out of his strange and\r\nlong confinement and incognito, which must be so uneasy to him, and,\r\nI think, does little honor to the King of France, while it must carry\r\nsomething very odd with it in the eye of the public. But there were,\r\nto be sure, reasons for it which the public never knew, but I hope I\r\nshall at last.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[802] The arrival of this messenger, whose name was Blair, was\r\nannounced by Drummond of Bochaldy to the prince’s father, in a\r\nletter, dated 30th July, 1744:--“Yesterday night there arrived\r\nhere, (at Dunkirk,) a gentleman from Scotland sent by the Duke of\r\nPerth, Lord Traquair, and young Lochiel, to inform the prince of\r\nthe state and disposition of that country, and the hazard the clans\r\nrun by Lord John Drummond attempting to raise a regiment in your\r\nmajesty’s name, which he gloriously averred to every particular,\r\nwas by his majesty’s command and order; but the dangerous effect of\r\nthis was prevented by the gentlemen of the Concert, their prudence\r\nand influence in allowing nobody of any distinction to give either\r\ncountenance or credit to it except his brother, who, it seems, they\r\ncould not hinder from going such lengths as brought troops about him,\r\nand forced him to abscond, till such time as the government came to\r\nunderstand that the view was absolutely private in Lord John, and\r\nthat the using your majesty’s name was an imposition for private\r\nends, which the clans had disappointed as much as they could. It\r\nwould appear exaggeration to repeat to your majesty the accounts this\r\ngentleman brings of the real spirit and forwardness every man showed\r\non hearing that the prince was coming to them, and what an universal\r\nmelancholy succeeded that flow of spirits on being made certain of a\r\ndisappointment.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\nIt appears from the Chevalier’s answer (28th August, 1744), to the\r\nabove-mentioned letter, that Lord John Drummond was authorised to\r\nraise the regiment:--“I remarked what you said last post in relation\r\nto Lord John: he had my approbation for endeavouring to raise a Scots\r\nregiment in the French service; and as I think that in general the\r\nmore troops there be of my subjects in that service, the better. I\r\nmust recommend to you not to take any steps to obstruct the raising\r\nof the said regiment.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[803] The prince’s design was rumoured at Paris, and communicated\r\nby Sempil to the Chevalier, who, in his answer, dated 23d February,\r\n1745, remarks as follows:--“I am noways surprised that some French\r\npeople should have a notion of the prince’s going to Scotland without\r\ntroops, tho’ nobody surely can enter into such an idea except out\r\nof ignorance, and from not knowing the true state of things. But\r\nI am always alarmed at it, because I think it impossible that the\r\nKing of France should approve of such a project, and that it is well\r\nknown how much I should myself be averse to it. However, it will be\r\nalways well that you use your best endeavours to refute so dangerous\r\na scheme, and that nobody can do more solidly and effectually than\r\nyourself, from the lights and knowledge you have of the affairs of\r\nBritain; and I own, till I see the contrary, I shall, as long as\r\nthe war lasts, always hope that the French will take at last some\r\ngenerous resolution in our favour.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[804] _Stuart Papers_, February and March, 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1745.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  Preparations--Departure of the expedition--Incidents of the\r\n  voyage--The Prince lands in Eriska--Has interviews with Macdonald\r\n  of Boisdale and young Clanranald--Kinlochmoidart, Dr. Cameron,\r\n  and others, visit the Prince--Charles lands at Borodale--Cameron,\r\n  younger, of Lochiel--His interview with the Prince--Charles\r\n  arrives at Kinlochmoidart--Commencement of hostilities--Charles\r\n  raises his standard at Glenfinnan--Manifesto--The Chevalier’s\r\n  ignorance of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom mere auxiliaries in the war of the Austrian succession, Great\r\nBritain and France at last entered the field as principals; and\r\nin the spring of 1745, both parties were prepared to decide their\r\nrespective differences by force of arms. The Jacobites, who looked\r\nupon war as the harbinger to a speedy realisation of their wishes\r\nand their hopes, awaited the result with anxiety; though, from the\r\npolicy of France, it was not difficult to perceive that the issue,\r\nwhether favourable or unfavourable to France, would in reality\r\nneither advance nor retard the long looked for restoration. France,\r\nif defeated in the field, almost on her own frontiers, would require\r\nall her forces to protect herself; and could not, therefore, be\r\nexpected to make a diversion on the shores of Britain. And, on the\r\nother hand, if successful in the campaign about to open in Flanders,\r\nshe was likely to accomplish the objects for which the war had been\r\nundertaken, without continuing an expensive and dubious struggle in\r\nsupport of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward Stuart, the aspirant to the British throne, seems\r\nto have viewed matters much in the same light on receiving\r\nintelligence of the victory obtained by the French over the allies\r\nat Fontenoy.[805] In writing to one of his father’s agents at\r\nParis,[806] who had sent him information of the battle, Charles\r\nobserves that it was not easy to form an opinion as to whether the\r\nresult would “prove good or bad” for his affairs. He had, however,\r\ntaken his resolution to go to Scotland, though unaccompanied even by\r\na single company of soldiers; and the event which had just occurred\r\nmade him determine to put that resolution into immediate execution.\r\nAt Fontenoy, the British troops maintained by their bravery the\r\nnational reputation, but they were obliged to yield to numbers;\r\nyet, to use the words of a French historian, “they left the field\r\nof battle without tumult, without confusion, and were defeated with\r\nhonour.”[807] The flower of the British army was, however, destroyed;\r\nand as Great Britain had been almost drained of troops, Charles\r\nconsidered the conjuncture as favourable, and made such preparations\r\nfor his departure as the shortness of the time would allow.\r\n\r\nThe French government was apprised of Charles’s intentions, and\r\nthough the French ministers were not disposed openly to sanction an\r\nenterprise which they were not at the time in a condition to support,\r\nthey secretly favoured a design, which, whatever might be its result,\r\nwould operate as a diversion in favour of France. Accordingly, Lord\r\nClare, (afterwards Marshal Thomond,) then a lieutenant-general in\r\nthe French service, was authorised to open a negotiation with two\r\nmerchants of Irish extraction, named Ruttledge and Walsh, who had\r\nmade some money by trading to the West Indies. They had, since the\r\nwar, been concerned in privateering; and with the view of extending\r\ntheir operations, had lately obtained from the French government a\r\ngrant of the Elizabeth, an old man-of-war of sixty-six guns, and they\r\nhad purchased a small frigate of sixteen guns named the Doutelle,\r\nboth of which ships were in the course of being fitted out for a\r\ncruise in the north seas. Lord Clare having introduced Charles to\r\nRuttledge and Walsh, explained the prince’s design, and proposed that\r\nthey should lend him their ships. This proposal was at once acceded\r\nto by the owners, who also offered to supply the prince with money\r\nand such arms as they could procure, in fulfilment of which offer\r\nthey afterwards placed in his hands the sum of £3,800.[808]\r\n\r\nWhile the preparations for the expedition were going on, Charles\r\nresided at Navarre, a seat of the Duke of Bouillon, and occupied\r\nhimself in hunting, fishing, and shooting. A few persons only in his\r\nown confidence were aware of his intentions; and so desirous was\r\nhe of concealing his movements from his father’s agents at Paris,\r\nthat he gave out, shortly before his departure, that he intended\r\nto visit the monastery of La Trappe, in the vicinity of Rouen, and\r\nwould return to Paris in a few days.[809] The prince ordered the few\r\nfollowers who were to accompany him to assemble at Nantes, near the\r\nmouth of the Loire; and the better to conceal their design, they\r\narrived there singly, took up their residence in different parts of\r\nthe town, and when they met on the streets did not seem to recognise\r\none another.[810]\r\n\r\nWhen informed that every thing was in readiness for his departure,\r\nCharles went to Nantes in disguise, and having descended the Loire\r\nin a fishing boat on the 20th of June, (O. S.) 1745, embarked on the\r\n21st on board the Doutelle at St. Nazaire, whence he proceeded on the\r\nfollowing day to Belleisle, where he was joined on the 4th of July by\r\nthe Elizabeth, which had on board 100 marines raised by Lord Clare,\r\nabout 2,000 muskets, and 500 or 600 French broad-swords. The persons\r\nwho accompanied Charles were the Marquis of Tullibardine,[811] elder\r\nbrother of James, Duke of Athole; Sir Thomas Sheridan, who had been\r\ntutor to Charles; Sir John Macdonald, an officer in the Spanish\r\nservice; Francis Strickland, an English gentleman; George Kelly,\r\na clergyman; Æneas or Angus Macdonald, a banker in Paris, brother\r\nto Kinlochmoidart; and O’Sullivan, an officer in the service of\r\nFrance. These were afterwards designated the “Seven Men of Moidart.”\r\nThere were also some persons of inferior note, among whom were one\r\nBuchanan, who had been employed as a messenger to Rome by Cardinal\r\nTencin, and Duncan Cameron, formerly a servant of old Lochiel at\r\nBoulogne, who was hired for the expedition, for the purpose, as he\r\ninforms us, of descrying the “Long Isle.”[812]\r\n\r\nThe expedition sailed from Belleisle on the 5th of July with a fair\r\nwind, which continued favourable till the 8th, when a dead calm\r\nensued. On the following day, when in the latitude of 47° 57´ north,\r\nand thirty-nine leagues west from the meridian of the Lizard, a sail\r\nwas descried to windward, which proved to be the Lion, a British\r\nman-of-war of sixty guns, commanded by Captain Brett. When the Lion\r\nhove in sight, the prince, for better accommodation, was preparing\r\nto go on board the Elizabeth; but luckily for him he laid aside\r\nhis design on the appearance of the man-of-war. While the Lion was\r\nbearing down on the French ships, M. D’Oe, or D’Eau, the captain of\r\nthe Elizabeth, went on board the Doutelle, where a council of war was\r\nimmediately held, at which it was determined, if possible, to avoid\r\nan action; but if an action became inevitable, that the Elizabeth\r\nshould receive the first broadside, and should thereupon endeavour\r\nto board her adversary. While this conference lasted, both ships\r\nkept running before the wind; but the Lion being a fast sailing\r\nvessel soon neared the Elizabeth, and, when within nearly a mile of\r\nher, hove to for the purpose of reconnoitring the French ships and\r\npreparing for action. Judging an action now unavoidable, Captain\r\nD’Oe proposed to Walsh, one of the proprietors of the two vessels,\r\nand who acted as commander of the Doutelle, that while the Elizabeth\r\nand Lion were engaged, the Doutelle should assist the Elizabeth by\r\nplaying upon the Lion at a distance; but Walsh declined to interfere\r\nin any shape. The Captain of the Elizabeth thereupon drew his sword,\r\nand taking leave, went back to his ship, with his drawn sword in his\r\nhand, to prepare for action.[813]\r\n\r\nCaptain D’Oe had scarcely reached the Elizabeth when the Lion bore\r\ndown upon her. Contrary to the plan laid down on board the Doutelle,\r\nthe Elizabeth gave the first broadside, which was instantly returned\r\nby the Lion; and before the Elizabeth could get her other side\r\nto bear upon her opponent, the latter tacked about and poured in\r\nanother broadside into the Elizabeth, which raked her fore and aft,\r\nand killed a great number of her men. Notwithstanding this untoward\r\nbeginning, the Elizabeth maintained the fight for nearly five hours,\r\nwhen night coming on, and both vessels being complete wrecks,\r\nthey parted as if by mutual consent. The prince, in the Doutelle,\r\nviewed the battle with great anxiety, and, it is said, importuned\r\nthe captain to assist the Elizabeth, but Walsh positively refused\r\nto engage, and intimated to the prince, that if he continued his\r\nsolicitations, he would order him down to the cabin.[814]\r\n\r\nAfter the action was over, Captain Walsh bore up to the Elizabeth\r\nto ascertain the state of matters, and was informed by a lieutenant\r\nof the severe loss she had sustained in officers and men, and the\r\ncrippled state she was in. He, however, offered to pursue the voyage\r\nif supplied with a main-mast and some rigging, but Walsh had no spare\r\nmaterials; and after intimating that he would endeavour to finish\r\nthe voyage himself, and advising the commander of the Elizabeth to\r\nreturn to France, both ships parted, the Elizabeth on her way back to\r\nFrance, and the Doutelle on her voyage to the Western Highlands.[815]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July a sail was discovered, which gave chase to the\r\nDoutelle; but being a swift-sailing vessel she outran her pursuer.\r\nShe encountered a rough sea and tempestuous weather on the 15th and\r\n16th, after which the weather became fine till the midnight of the\r\n20th, when a violent storm arose. She stood out the gale, however,\r\nand on the 22d came within sight of land, which was discovered to be\r\nthe southern extremity of Long Island, a name by which, from their\r\nappearing at a distance, and in a particular direction, to form one\r\nisland, the islands of Lewis, the Uists, Barra, and others, are\r\ndistinguished. On approaching the land, a large ship, which appeared\r\nto be an English man-of-war, was descried between the Doutelle and\r\nthe island. On perceiving this vessel, Walsh changed the course of\r\nthe Doutelle, and stretching along the east side of Barra, reached\r\nthe strait between South Uist and Eriska, the largest of a cluster\r\nof little rocky islands that lie off South Uist. When near the land,\r\nDuncan Cameron, before mentioned, was sent on shore in the long-boat\r\nto bring off a proper pilot, and having accidentally met the piper of\r\nMacneil of Barra, with whom Cameron was acquainted, he took him on\r\nboard. In the strait alluded to, the Doutelle cast anchor on the 23d\r\nof July, having been eighteen days at sea.[816]\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his attendants, the prince immediately landed in\r\nEriska, and was conducted to the house of Angus Macdonald, the\r\ntacksman, or principal tenant thereof and of the small islands\r\nadjoining. To anticipate that prying curiosity and speculation which\r\nthe inhabitants of the western isles always display on the arrival of\r\nstrangers, the prince’s companions represented him as a young Irish\r\npriest, a species of visitor by no means uncommon in these islands,\r\nwhither priests from the opposite coast of Ireland had been long\r\naccustomed to resort, for the purpose of giving the islanders that\r\nreligious instruction and consolation of which, by the change in\r\nthe national religion, they had been almost debarred from receiving\r\nfrom the hands of native priests. From the tacksman of Eriska, the\r\nparty learned, that Macdonald, chief of Clanranald, and Macdonald\r\nof Boisdale, his brother, were upon the island of South Uist, and\r\nthat young Clanranald, the son of the chief, was at Moidart upon the\r\nmainland. As Boisdale was understood to have great influence with\r\nhis brother, a messenger was immediately despatched to South Uist,\r\nrequesting his attendance on board the Doutelle.\r\n\r\nCharles and his companions passed the night in the house of the\r\ntacksman, but the accommodation was very indifferent. They had not\r\na sufficient supply of beds, but the prince, regardless of his own\r\nease, declined to occupy one.[817] Next morning they returned to\r\nthe ship. Boisdale soon thereafter made his appearance. As his\r\nbrother, Clanranald, was unfit, from age and bad health, to be of any\r\nessential service, Charles was anxious to secure the assistance of\r\nBoisdale, by whose means he expected that the clan would be induced\r\nto rise in his support. Boisdale had, however, already made up his\r\nmind upon the subject, and the result of the interview was extremely\r\ndiscouraging to Charles. At first, the prince proposed that Boisdale\r\nshould accompany him to the mainland, and endeavour to engage his\r\nnephew to take up arms; but Boisdale decidedly declined the proposal,\r\nand even declared that he would do every thing in his power to\r\nprevent his brother and nephew from engaging in an enterprise which\r\nhe considered desperate. Baffled in his first attempt, Charles\r\nnext proposed to despatch Boisdale with a message to Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald of Sleat and the Laird of Macleod, who had extensive\r\npossessions in the island of Skye, requesting their assistance; but\r\nBoisdale informed the prince that such a mission would be useless, as\r\nhe had seen Sir Alexander Macdonald and Macleod very lately,--that\r\nthey had stated to him the probability that the prince would arrive,\r\nbut that if he came without a body of regular troops, they were\r\ndetermined not to join him, and were of opinion that no other person\r\nwould. Boisdale added, that he was instructed by these gentlemen to\r\nmention their resolution to the prince in case he should meet him\r\non his arrival, and to advise him, should he come unprovided with\r\ntroops, to return directly to France.\r\n\r\nCharles was sadly perplexed at Boisdale’s obduracy, but he\r\nendeavoured to soften him by representing his affairs in the most\r\nfavourable light; but the Highlander was inflexible. Whilst this\r\nprolonged altercation was going on, two vessels appeared making\r\nfor the strait in which the Doutelle lay, a circumstance which\r\ninduced her commander to weigh anchor and stand in for the mainland.\r\nBoisdale, still pressed by the prince, remained on board till the\r\nship had advanced several miles in her course, when he entered his\r\nboat, and left Charles to ruminate over his disappointment. The\r\nDoutelle continued her course during the night, and next morning\r\ncast anchor in the bay of Lochnanuagh, which partly divides the\r\ncountries of Moidart and Arisaig.[818] On approaching the strait,\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine, when about to retire below to dinner,\r\nobserved an eagle hovering over the frigate, which he looked upon\r\nas a happy augury, but afraid of being taxed by his companions\r\nwith superstition, he at first took no notice of the circumstance.\r\nOn coming upon deck after dinner, he saw the eagle still hovering\r\nabove the vessel and following her in her course. No longer able\r\nto restrain himself, he directed the attention of Charles and his\r\nsuite to the royal bird, and thereafter turning to the prince, thus\r\naddressed him: “Sir, I hope this is an excellent omen, and promises\r\ngood things to us. The king of birds is come to welcome your royal\r\nhighness upon your arrival in Scotland.”\r\n\r\nThough foiled in his attempt upon Boisdale, the young adventurer\r\nresolved to repeat the same experiment upon his nephew, and\r\naccordingly he immediately sent a boat on shore with a letter to\r\nyoung Clanranald; Æneas Macdonald also went on shore to bring\r\noff Kinlochmoidart, his brother. Kinlochmoidart came on board\r\nimmediately, and after a short interview with the prince, was\r\ndespatched with letters to Lochiel, the Duke of Perth, Murray of\r\nBroughton and others.\r\n\r\nNext day young Clanranald, accompanied by his kinsmen, Alexander\r\nMacdonald of Glenalladale, Æneas Macdonald of Dalily and a Highland\r\nofficer (author of a journal and memoirs of the expedition),[819]\r\ncame to Forsy, a small village opposite to the Doutelle’s anchorage\r\nground. They called for the ship’s boat, and were immediately carried\r\non board. The feelings of the party on getting upon deck are thus\r\ndescribed by the writer alluded to. “Our hearts were overjoyed to\r\nfind ourselves so near our long-wished-for prince; we found a\r\nlarge tent erected with poles on the ship’s deck, covered and well\r\nfurnished with variety of wines and spirits. As we entered this\r\npavilion we were most cheerfully welcom’d by the Duke of Athole, to\r\nwhom some of us had been known in the year 1715. While the duke was\r\ntalking with us, Clanranald was a-missing, and had, as we understood,\r\nbeen called into the prince’s cabin, nor did we look for the honour\r\nof seeing His R. H. at least for that night.”[820]\r\n\r\nOf the conversation which took place between the prince and young\r\nClanranald during the three hours they were closeted together, no\r\naccount was ever given; but it is probable that if the latter stated\r\nany objections against the enterprise, they had been overcome before\r\nhe rejoined his companions, as no allusion is made by the writer just\r\nquoted, to any unwillingness on the part of the young chieftain to\r\njoin the prince. Maxwell of Kirkconnel, who mentions the refusal of\r\nBoisdale, says, that young Clanranald frankly offered his services\r\nto the prince,[821] a statement which, from the ardent and romantic\r\nattachment for the Stuarts with which that young chieftain was\r\ninspired, seems to approximate nearer the truth than that of Home,\r\nwho classes Kinlochmoidart and young Clanranald together, as joining\r\nin a positive refusal to take up arms.\r\n\r\nAccording to Home, young Clanranald and Kinlochmoidart came on board\r\ntogether, and were addressed, with great emotion, by Charles, who had\r\nbeen almost reduced to despair by his interview with Boisdale. After\r\nusing all the arguments he could for taking up arms, he conjured\r\nthem to assist their countryman, their prince, in his utmost need.\r\nThough well inclined and warmly attached to the cause, the gentlemen\r\nin question are said to have positively refused, and to have told\r\nthe prince, one after another, that to take up arms in their present\r\nunprepared state, without concert or support, would bring down\r\ncertain destruction on their own heads. Charles persisted, argued,\r\nand implored, but without effect. During this conversation the\r\nparties walked backwards and forwards upon the deck, and were closely\r\neyed by a Highlander who stood near them armed at all points, as\r\nwas then the fashion of the country. He was a younger brother of\r\nKinlochmoidart, and had come off to the ship to inquire for news, not\r\nknowing who was on board. When he gathered from their discourse that\r\nthe stranger was Prince Charles, and heard his chief and his brother\r\nrefuse to take up arms in his behalf, his colour went and came, his\r\neyes sparkled, he shifted his place and grasped his sword. Charles\r\nobserving his demeanour, stopped short, and turning towards him,\r\nput this interrogatory, “Will not you assist me?” “I will! I will!”\r\nexclaimed Ranald; “though no other man in the Highlands should draw\r\na sword, I am ready to die for you.” Charles, delighted with the\r\nyoung man’s answer, evinced his gratitude by a profusion of thanks\r\nand acknowledgments, extolled his champion to the skies, and said he\r\nonly wished that all the Highlanders were like him. Stung with the\r\nprince’s observation, which could be regarded only as a reproach, and\r\nsmitten by the example set by the heroic youth, the two Macdonalds\r\ninstantly declared that they would unsheath their swords in support\r\nof the claims of the house of Stuart, and would use their utmost\r\nendeavours to rouse their countrymen to arms.[822]\r\n\r\nAfter the interview with the prince, Clanranald returned to his\r\nfriends, who had, during the conference, been regaling themselves in\r\nthe pavilion. In about half-an-hour thereafter, the prince entered\r\nthe tent and took his seat without appearing to notice any of the\r\ncompany. His appearance, and the scene which followed, are thus\r\ndescribed by an eyewitness. “There entered the tent a tall youth of\r\na most agreeable aspect, in a plain black coat with a plain shirt,\r\nnot very clean, and a cambrick stock fixed with a plain silver\r\nbuckle, a fair round wig out of the buckle, a plain hat with a canvas\r\nstring having one end fixed to one of his coat buttons; he had black\r\nstockings, and brass buckles in his shoes. At his first appearance\r\nI found my heart swell to my very throat. We were immediately told\r\nby one Obrian, a churchman, that this youth was also an English\r\nclergyman, who had long been possessed with a desire to see and\r\nconverse with Highlanders.\r\n\r\n“When this youth entered, Obrian forbid any of those who were sitting\r\nto rise; he saluted none of us, and we only made a low bow at a\r\ndistance. I chanced to be one of those who were standing when he came\r\nin, and he took his seat near me, but immediately started up again\r\nand caused me to sit down by him upon a chest. I at this time taking\r\nhim only to be a passenger or some clergyman, presumed to speak to\r\nhim with too much familiarity, yet still retained some suspicion he\r\nmight be one of more note than he was said to be. He asked me if I\r\nwas not cold in that habit, (viz. the Highland garb,) I answered I\r\nwas so habituated to it, that I should rather be so (feel cold) if I\r\nwas to change my dress for any other. At this he laughed heartily,\r\nand next inquired how I lay with it at night, which I explained to\r\nhim. He said that by wrapping myself so close in my plaid I would\r\nbe unprepared for any sudden defence in the case of a surprise. I\r\nanswered that in such times of danger, or during the war, we had a\r\ndifferent method of using the plaid, that with one spring I could\r\nstart to my feet with drawn sword and cocked pistol in my hand,\r\nwithout being the least encumbered with my bed-clothes. Several such\r\nquestions he put to me; then rising quickly from his seat he calls\r\nfor a dram, when the same person whispered me a second time to pledge\r\nthe stranger but not to drink to him, by which seasonable hint I was\r\nconfirmed in my suspicion who he was. Having taken a glass of wine in\r\nhis hand, he drank to us all round, and soon after left us.”[823]\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured the support of young Clanranald, Charles selected\r\nhim to execute the commission which his uncle, Boisdale, had refused\r\nto undertake. Accordingly, on the 22d of July the young chieftain,\r\nattended by Allan Macdonald, a younger brother of Kinlochmoidart, was\r\ndespatched with letters from the prince, to Sir Alexander Macdonald\r\nand the laird of Macleod, to solicit the aid of their services. These\r\npowerful chieftains, who could raise nearly 2,000 men between them,\r\nhad promised to join the prince if he brought a foreign force along\r\nwith him, but when they found that he had come without troops, they\r\nconsidered themselves released from their engagements, and refused to\r\njoin in an enterprise which they considered desperate.[824]\r\n\r\nDuring young Clanranald’s absence, Donald Macdonald of Scothouse, Dr.\r\nArchibald Cameron on the part of his brother Donald Cameron, younger\r\nof Lochiel, and Hugh Macdonald, brother of the laird of Morar, came\r\non board the Doutelle. The latter, on his way home from Edinburgh,\r\nhad met Kinlochmoidart crossing the water of Lochy, and had been\r\ninformed by him of the arrival of the prince.[825] In expectation of\r\nseeing the prince, he went to Kinlochmoidart’s house, where he found\r\nÆneas Macdonald, brother of Kinlochmoidart, who told him that he\r\nmight see the prince the following day if he pleased, but cautioned\r\nhim not to accost him as such, as the prince passed for a French abbé\r\nwith the crew of the vessel, who were ignorant of his rank. Next day\r\nthe two Macdonalds went on board; and Charles, being informed of the\r\nname and character of his visitor, invited him down to the cabin. In\r\na conversation which ensued, Hugh Macdonald expressed his fears as\r\nto the result of the expedition if persevered in, and hinted that,\r\nas he had brought no forces along with him, the most eligible course\r\nthe prince could pursue, was to return to France, and wait a more\r\nfavourable opportunity. Charles remarked that he did not wish to be\r\nindebted for the restoration of his father to foreigners, but to\r\nhis own friends; that he had now put it in their power to have the\r\nglory of doing so, and that as to returning to France without making\r\nan attempt, foreigners should never have to say that he had thrown\r\nhimself upon his friends, that they had turned their backs upon\r\nhim, and that he had been forced to retire for shelter to foreign\r\nlands. He concluded by observing, that if he could get only six stout\r\ntrusty fellows to join him, he would choose rather to skulk with them\r\namong the mountains of Scotland than return to France. Dr. Cameron\r\nalso urged Charles to return, and told him that Lochiel had made up\r\nhis mind not to join; but Charles returned the same answer he had\r\ngiven to Hugh Macdonald. On the return from Skye of young Clanranald\r\nand Allan Macdonald, who brought back an absolute refusal from Sir\r\nAlexander Macdonald and the laird of Macleod, the whole party on\r\nboard, including even Sir Thomas Sheridan, by whose advice the prince\r\ngenerally acted, importuned him to desist, chiefly on the ground that\r\nthe refusal of two such influential and powerful chieftains would\r\nprevent others, who were well disposed to the cause, from joining;\r\nbut Charles was immoveable, and though without a single supporter,\r\npersisted in his resolution.[826]\r\n\r\nCharles remained on board the Doutelle till the 25th of July, the\r\ninterval between which day and that of his arrival in Lochnanuagh,\r\nwas spent in despatching letters and receiving communications from\r\nhis friends, and in consultations with his companions and the\r\nadherents who visited him, as to the means to be adopted for raising\r\nthe clans that were favourably disposed. During the same interval,\r\nall the arms, ammunition, and stores were landed; and every thing\r\nbeing in readiness for his reception on shore, Charles, accompanied\r\nby his suite, landed at Borodale, a farm belonging to Clanranald,\r\nand took up his abode in the house of Angus Macdonald, the tenant\r\nof the farm, who received him and his companions with a hearty\r\nwelcome. By orders of young Clanranald, Macdonald of Glenalladale and\r\nanother gentleman of the clan, had collected about 100 of their men\r\nto serve as a body-guard to the prince, all of whom were hospitably\r\nentertained at Borodale.\r\n\r\nNo situation could have been any where selected more suitable for the\r\ncircumstances and designs of Charles than the abode he had chosen.\r\nBesides being one of the most remote and inaccessible places in the\r\nwestern Highlands of Scotland, it was surrounded on all sides by the\r\nterritories of the most devoted adherents of the house of Stuart, by\r\nthe descendants of the heroes of Kilsyth and Killiecrankie, in whose\r\nbreasts the spirit of revenge had taken deep root, for the cruelties\r\nwhich had followed the short-lived insurrection of 1715, and the\r\naffronts to which they had been subjected under the disarming act.\r\nThese mountaineers had long sighed for an opportunity of retaliation,\r\nand they were soon to imagine that the time for vengeance had arrived.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the landing of Charles was known, the whole neighbourhood\r\nwas in motion, and repaired, “without distinction of age or\r\nsex,”[827] to the house of Borodale, to see a man with whose success\r\nthey considered the glory and happiness of their country to be\r\ninseparably associated. To gratify his warm-hearted and generous\r\nvisitors, and to attain a full view of the assembled group, Charles\r\nseated himself in a conspicuous part of the room where a repast had\r\nbeen laid out for him and his friends. Here, amid the congregated\r\nspectators who feasted their eyes with the sight of the lineal\r\ndescendant of a race of kings, endeared to them by many sorrowful\r\nrecollections, the prince partook of the fare provided by his\r\nkind host, with a cheerfulness which banished all reflection of\r\nthe past or care for the future. At the conclusion of the repast,\r\nCharles drank the grace-drink in English, which, of course, was\r\nunderstood only by a few of the persons present. The guest, to whom\r\nwe are indebted for this account, says, that when his turn came\r\nto propose a toast, wishing to distinguish himself, he gave “the\r\nking’s health” in Gaelic in an audible voice,--“Deoch slaint an\r\nRigh.” When the prince was informed that his father’s health had been\r\ndrunk, he requested the gentleman who had proposed it to pronounce\r\nthe words again in Gaelic, that he might repeat them himself. This\r\nbeing done, Charles repeated the words, and understanding that the\r\nproposer was skilful in Gaelic, the prince intimated to him that\r\nhe would henceforth take instructions from him in that language.\r\nThe same individual, afterwards, by desire, gave also the healths\r\nof the prince, and his brother “the duke,” in Gaelic.[828] Such\r\ncondescension and familiarity on the part of Charles were highly\r\ngratifying to the feelings of all present, and were better calculated\r\nto secure the affections of the unsophisticated people, into whose\r\narms he had thrown himself, than all the pomp and circumstance of\r\nregal splendour.\r\n\r\nThough the extreme rashness of young Clanranald and his friends, in\r\nthus exposing themselves to almost inevitable destruction, be quite\r\ninexcusable on the score of sober reason, yet it is impossible not\r\nto admire the daring intrepidity of the men, who, at the call of\r\na friendless and unprotected youth, could commit themselves in a\r\nstruggle with the government even before they had ascertained that\r\na single clan, except their own, would join. Their devotedness to\r\nthe cause of the Stuarts did not blind them, however, to the dangers\r\nto which they were about to expose themselves by declaring for the\r\nprince; but having now thrown away the scabbard, they resolved\r\nto cling to the cause which a feeling of fidelity prompted them\r\nto espouse, reckless of the consequences. “All may judge (says a\r\ngentleman of the clan), how hazardous an enterprise we were now\r\nengaged in, being for some time quite alone; but we resolved,\r\nnotwithstanding, to follow our prince, and risk our fate with\r\nhis.”[829]\r\n\r\nCharles, before landing, had despatched messengers to several of\r\nthe chiefs who were favourably disposed. From Borodale he again\r\nsent off fresh messengers to all the chiefs from whom he expected\r\nassistance, requiring their attendance. Some of his friends, aware\r\nof his arrival, had, it is said, already held a meeting to consult\r\nas to the course they should pursue; at which Macdonald of Keppoch\r\nhad given his opinion, that as the prince had risked his person, and\r\ngenerously thrown himself into the hands of his friends, they were\r\nbound, in duty at least, to raise men instantly for the protection of\r\nhis person, whatever might be the consequences;[830] but it does not\r\nappear that any such resolution was at that time adopted.\r\n\r\nThe person pitched upon to visit Lochiel on this occasion, was\r\nMacdonald, younger of Scothouse, who succeeded in inducing that chief\r\nto visit the prince at Borodale, but he went with a determination not\r\nto take up arms. On his way to Borodale he called at the house of his\r\nbrother, John Cameron of Fassefern, who, on being told the object of\r\nhis journey, advised Lochiel not to proceed, as he was afraid that\r\nthe prince would prevail upon him to forego his resolution.[831]\r\nLochiel, firm in his determination, as he imagined, told his brother\r\nthat his reasons for declining to join the prince were too strong to\r\nbe overcome, and pursued his journey.\r\n\r\nDonald Cameron of Lochiel, on whose final determination the question\r\nof a civil war was now to depend, (for it seems to be universally\r\nadmitted, that if Lochiel had declined to take up arms the other\r\nchiefs would have also refused,) though called young Lochiel by the\r\nHighlanders, from his father being still alive, was rather advanced\r\nin life. His father, for the share he had taken in the insurrection\r\nof 1715, was attainted and in exile. In consequence of the attainder,\r\nyoung Lochiel had succeeded to the family estates upon the death of\r\nhis grandfather, Sir Ewen Cameron, in 1719. Sir Ewen, the reader\r\nknows, had served with distinction under Montrose and Dundee, and\r\nhis son and grandson had inherited from the old warrior a devoted\r\nattachment to the house of Stuart, which no change of circumstances\r\nhad been ever able to eradicate. The Chevalier de St. George,\r\nsensible of the inflexible integrity of the young chief, and of the\r\ngreat influence which he enjoyed among his countrymen on account\r\nof the uprightness of his character, and as being at the head of\r\none of the most powerful of the clans, had invested him with full\r\npowers to negotiate with his friends in Scotland, on the subject of\r\nhis restoration.[832] Knowing the confidence which was so deservedly\r\nreposed in him, he was consulted on all occasions by the Jacobites\r\nin the Highlands, and, as has been elsewhere observed, was one of\r\nthe seven who, in the year 1740, signed the bond of association to\r\nrestore the Chevalier. Upon the failure of the expedition of 1743,\r\nyoung Lochiel had urged the prince to continue his exertions to get\r\nanother fitted out; but he was averse to any attempts being made\r\nwithout foreign assistance, and cautioned the prince accordingly.[833]\r\n\r\nAmong the chiefs who were summoned to Borodale, Lochiel was the\r\nfirst to appear, and he immediately had a private interview with\r\nthe prince. Charles told him that he meant to be quite candid, and\r\nto conceal nothing; he reprobated in severe terms the conduct of\r\nthe French ministry, who, he averred, had long amused him with fair\r\npromises, and had at last deceived him. He admitted that he had\r\nbut a small quantity of arms, and very little money; that he had\r\nleft France without concerting anything, or even taking leave of\r\nthe French court,--that he had, however, before leaving, written to\r\nthe French king and his ministers soliciting succours, which he was\r\npersuaded they would send as soon as they saw that he really had a\r\nparty in Scotland,--that he had appointed Earl Marischal his agent\r\nat the court of France,--and that he depended much upon the zeal\r\nand abilities of that nobleman, who would himself superintend the\r\nembarkation of the succours he was soliciting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Donald Cameron of Lochiel.--From the original painting\r\nin possession of Mrs. Cameron-Campbell of Monzie.]\r\n\r\nWhile Lochiel admitted the engagements which he and other chiefs\r\nhad come under to support the cause, he observed that they were\r\nbinding only in the event of the stipulated aid being furnished;\r\nand as his royal highness had come over without such support, they\r\nwere released from the engagements they had contracted. He therefore\r\nreiterated his resolution not to join in the present hopeless\r\nattempt, and advised his royal highness to return to France and\r\nawait a more favourable opportunity. Charles, on the other hand,\r\nmaintained, that an opportunity more favourable than the present\r\nmight never occur again,--that, with the exception of a very few\r\nnewly raised regiments, all the British troops were occupied abroad.\r\nHe represented, that the regular troops now in the kingdom were\r\ninsufficient to withstand the body of Highlanders his friends could\r\nbring into the field; and he stated his belief, that if in the outset\r\nhe obtained an advantage over the government forces, the country in\r\ngeneral would declare in his favour, and his friends abroad would\r\nat once aid him,--that every thing, in fact, now depended upon the\r\nHighlanders,--and that to accomplish the restoration of his father,\r\nit was only necessary that they should instantly declare themselves\r\nand begin the war.\r\n\r\nThese arguments, which, as the result showed, were more plausible\r\nthan solid, had no effect upon Lochiel, who continued to resist all\r\nthe entreaties of Charles to induce him to alter his resolution.\r\nFinding the prince utterly averse to the proposal made to him to\r\nreturn to France, Lochiel entreated him to be more moderate in his\r\nviews. He then suggested, that Charles should send his attendants\r\nback to France; that he himself should remain concealed in the\r\ncountry; that a report should be circulated that he also had returned\r\nto France, and that the court of France should be made acquainted\r\nwith the state of matters, and informed that his friends would be\r\nready to take up arms upon the first notice of a landing, but that\r\nnothing could be done without foreign support. Charles, however,\r\nrejected this proposal also, and told Lochiel, that the court of\r\nFrance would never be convinced that he had a considerable party in\r\nScotland, till there was an actual insurrection, without which he was\r\nafraid they would not venture their troops.\r\n\r\nAs a last shift, Lochiel suggested, that Charles should remain\r\nat Borodale till he and other friends should hold a meeting, and\r\nconcert what was best to be done. With an impatience which spurned\r\ndelay, Charles would not even listen to the proposal, and declared\r\nhis firm determination to take the field, however small the number\r\nof his attendants might be. “In a few days,” said he, “with the few\r\nfriends that I have, I will erect the royal standard, and proclaim\r\nto the people of Britain, that Charles Stuart is come over to claim\r\nthe crown of his ancestors--to win it, or to perish in the attempt:\r\nLochiel, whom my father has often told me, was our firmest friend,\r\nmay stay at home, and from the newspapers, learn the fate of his\r\nprince.” This appeal was irresistible. “No!” exclaimed Lochiel, “I’ll\r\nshare the fate of my prince; and so shall every man over whom nature\r\nor fortune has given me any power.”[834]\r\n\r\nHaving extorted an acquiescence from Lochiel, who, impelled by a\r\nmistaken but chivalrous sense of honour, thus yielded to the prince’s\r\nentreaties in spite of his own better judgment, Charles resolved to\r\nraise his standard at Glenfinnan on the 19th of August. Accordingly,\r\nhe despatched letters from Borodale on the 6th, to the various chiefs\r\nwho were favourably disposed, informing them of his intention, and\r\nrequiring the presence of them and their followers at Glenfinnan on\r\nthe day appointed, or as soon thereafter as possible. Lochiel, at the\r\nsame time, returned to his own house, whence he despatched messengers\r\nto the leading gentlemen of his clan to raise their men, and to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to march with him to Glenfinnan.\r\n\r\nAfter sending off his messengers, Charles left Borodale for the\r\nhouse of Kinlochmoidart, about seven miles from Borodale, whither\r\nhe and his suite had been invited by the proprietor to spend a few\r\ndays, while the preparations for the appointed meeting were going\r\non. Charles and his party went by sea, and their baggage and some\r\nartillery were forwarded by the same conveyance; but the body-guard,\r\nwhich had been provided by Clanranald, proceeded by land along the\r\nheads of two intervening bays. While at the hospitable mansion of his\r\nfriend, Charles expressed his sense of the services of Kinlochmoidart\r\nin the warmest terms, offered him a colonel’s commission in a\r\nregiment of dragoons, and promised him a peerage.[835]\r\n\r\nDuring Charles’s stay at Kinlochmoidart, the arming of the\r\nHighlanders went on with extraordinary alacrity; and several days\r\nbefore the prince’s departure for Glenfinnan, detached parties of\r\narmed Highlanders were to be seen perambulating the country in\r\ndifferent directions. Though three weeks had elapsed since the\r\narrival of the prince, and although Kinlochmoidart was only about\r\nthirty miles from Fort William, yet so effectually had his arrival\r\nbeen concealed from the officers of the government in the Highlands,\r\nthat it was not until they received intelligence of these movements,\r\nthat they began even to suspect his arrival. Alarmed by reports\r\nwhich reached him for the safety of Fort William, around which\r\nLochiel and Keppoch were assembling their men, the governor of Fort\r\nAugustus despatched, on the 16th of August, two companies of the\r\nsecond battalion of the Scots Royals, under the command of Captain\r\n(afterwards General) Scott, to reinforce that garrison; but they did\r\nnot reach their destination, having been taken prisoners by a party\r\nof Lochiel’s and Keppoch’s men. As this occurrence may be regarded as\r\nthe commencement of hostilities, and as it is strongly characteristic\r\nof the ardour with which the Highlanders took the field at the\r\ncommand of their chiefs, the details of it may not here be considered\r\nas out of place.\r\n\r\nAt the period in question, as well as at the time of the previous\r\ninsurrection of 1715, the country between Fort William and Inverness\r\nwas inhabited altogether by disaffected clans; mainly to overawe\r\nwhom, the chain of forts, namely, Fort William, Fort Augustus, and\r\nFort George, which reach across the Highlands from the east to the\r\nwest sea, was placed. In the centre of these, or almost equidistant\r\nbetween Fort William and Fort George, stands Fort Augustus, the\r\ndistance between which and Fort William is twenty-eight miles. To\r\nkeep up a regular communication between the garrisons of the two last\r\nmentioned forts, a road, as we have seen, was made by order of the\r\ngovernment along the sides of the mountains which skirt the narrow\r\nlakes, which now form part of the bed of the Caledonian canal. It\r\nwas along this road that the detachment in question marched. That\r\nthey might reach Fort William the same day--there being no place\r\non the road where so many men could have taken up their quarters\r\nduring night--they left Fort Augustus early in the morning of the\r\n16th of August, and met with no interruption till they arrived\r\nat High Bridge, within eight miles of Fort William. This bridge,\r\nwhich consists of one arch of great height, is built across the\r\nriver Spean,--a mountain torrent confined between high and steep\r\nbanks. On approaching the bridge the ears of the party were saluted\r\nby the sound of a bagpipe,--a circumstance which could excite\r\nlittle surprise in the Highlands; but when they observed a body of\r\nHighlanders on the other side of the bridge with swords and firelocks\r\nin their hands, the party became alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders who had posted themselves at the bridge, were\r\nof Keppoch’s clan, and were under the command of Macdonald of\r\nTierndriech; and though they did not consist of more than eleven or\r\ntwelve persons, yet by leaping and skipping about, moving from place\r\nto place, and extending their plaids between one another to give\r\nthemselves a formidable appearance, they impressed Captain Scott with\r\nan idea that they were a pretty numerous body. He therefore halted\r\nhis men, and sent forward a sergeant with his own servant towards the\r\nbridge to reconnoitre; but when they came near the bridge they were\r\nseized and carried across by two nimble Highlanders, who unexpectedly\r\ndarted upon them. Seeing the fate of his messengers, knowing that he\r\nwas in a disaffected district, and ignorant of the strength of the\r\nHighlanders, Captain Scott deemed it more advisable to retreat than\r\nrisk an encounter. He, therefore, ordered his men to face about,\r\nand return by the road they had come. Tierndriech had for some time\r\nobserved the march of these troops, and had sent expresses to Lochiel\r\nand Keppoch, whose houses were within three or four miles of High\r\nBridge, announcing their advance, and demanding assistance. Expecting\r\nimmediate aid, and not wishing to display his weakness, which, from\r\nthe openness of the ground near the bridge, would have been easily\r\ndiscernible, he did not follow Scott immediately, but kept at a\r\ndistance till the troops had passed the west end of Loch Lochy, and\r\nwere upon the narrow road between the lake and the mountain. The\r\nHighlanders thereupon made their appearance, and ascending the\r\ncraggy eminences which overhang the road, and, sheltering themselves\r\namong the rocks and trees, began to fire down upon the retreating\r\nparty, who, in place of returning the fire, accelerated their pace.\r\n\r\nBefore this fire had been opened, bands of Highlanders were\r\nproceeding in the direction of the bridge to assist in the attack.\r\nUpon hearing the report of the fire-arms, these hastened to the place\r\nwhence the firing proceeded, and in a short time a considerable body\r\njoined the party under Tierndriech. Captain Scott continued his march\r\nrapidly along the loch, and when he reached the east end, he observed\r\nsome Highlanders on a hill at the west end of Loch Oich, where they\r\nhad assembled apparently for the purpose of intercepting him on\r\nhis retreat. Disliking the appearance of this body, which stood in\r\nthe direct way of his retreat, Scott resolved to throw himself for\r\nprotection into Invergary castle, the seat of Macdonell of Glengarry,\r\nand accordingly crossed the isthmus between the two lakes. This\r\nmovement, however, only rendered his situation more embarrassing, as\r\nhe had not marched far when he perceived another body of Highlanders,\r\nthe Macdonells of Glengarry, coming down the opposite hill to attack\r\nhim. In this dilemma he formed his men into a hollow square, and\r\nproceeded on his march. Meanwhile, Tierndriech having been reinforced\r\nby a party of Keppoch’s men, headed by the chief, hastened the\r\npursuit, and soon came up with the fugitives. To spare the effusion\r\nof blood, Keppoch advanced alone to Scott’s party, required them\r\nto surrender, and offered them quarters; but assured them, that,\r\nin case of resistance, they would be cut to pieces. Fatigued with\r\na long march, and surrounded on all sides by increasing bodies of\r\nHighlanders, Captain Scott, who had been wounded, and had had two\r\nof his men killed, accepted the terms offered, and surrendered.\r\nThis affair was scarcely over, when Lochiel arrived on the spot\r\nwith a party of Camerons, and took charge of the prisoners, whom he\r\ncarried to his own house at Achnacarie. The result of this singular\r\nrencounter, in which the Highlanders did not lose a single man, was\r\nhailed by them as the harbinger of certain success, and they required\r\nno farther inducement to prosecute the war thus auspiciously begun,\r\nas they imagined.[836]\r\n\r\nCharles, to whom it may be supposed intelligence of this affair\r\nwas instantly sent, left Kinlochmoidart on the 18th of August, on\r\nwhich day he went by water to the seat of Alexander Macdonald of\r\nGlenalladale, on the side of Loch Shiel, where he was joined by\r\nGordon of Glenbucket, who brought with him Captain Sweetenham, an\r\nEnglish officer of Guise’s regiment, who had been taken prisoner by\r\na party of Keppoch’s men while on his way to Fort William to inspect\r\nthat fortress. The prince passed the night at Glenalladale, and with\r\nhis attendants, who amounted to about 25 persons, proceeded about\r\nsix o’clock next morning, in three boats, to Glenfinnan, and landed\r\nwithin a few hours at the east end of Loch Shiel, where the little\r\nriver Finnan falls into the lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCH SHIEL\r\n\r\nWITH MONUMENT ON SPOT WHERE PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD FIRST RAISED HIS\r\nSTANDARD 18^{TH}. AUG^T. 1746.\r\n\r\nA. Fullarton & C^o. London & Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nGlenfinnan, the place appointed for the rendezvous, is a narrow vale\r\nbounded on both sides by high and rocky mountains, between which\r\nthe river Finnan runs. This glen forms the inlet from Moidart into\r\nLochaber, and at its gorge is about fifteen miles west from Fort\r\nWilliam. On landing, the prince was received by the laird of Morar\r\nat the head of 150 men, with whom he marched to Glenfinnan, where he\r\narrived about eleven o’clock. Charles, of course, expected to find\r\na large “gathering of the clans” in the vale awaiting his approach;\r\nbut, to his great surprise, not a human being was to be seen\r\nthroughout the whole extent of the lonely glen, except the solitary\r\ninhabitants of the few huts which formed the hamlet. Chagrined and\r\ndisappointed, Charles entered one of these hovels to ruminate over\r\nthe supposed causes which might have retarded the assembling of his\r\nfriends. After waiting about two hours in anxious suspense, he was\r\nrelieved from his solicitude by the distant sound of a bagpipe, which\r\nbroke upon his ear, and by its gradual increase, it soon became\r\nevident that a party was coming in the direction of the glen. While\r\nall eyes were turned towards the point whence the sound proceeded, a\r\ndark mass was seen overtopping the hill and descending its side. This\r\nwas the clan Cameron, amounting to between 700 and 800 men, with\r\nLochiel, their chief, at their head. They advanced in two columns, of\r\nthree men deep each, with the prisoners who were taken in the late\r\nscuffle between the lines.\r\n\r\nIf in the state of suspense in which he was kept after entering\r\nGlenfinnan, the spirits of Charles suffered a temporary depression,\r\nthey soon recovered their wonted buoyancy when he beheld the gallant\r\nband which now stood before him. Without waiting, therefore, for the\r\nother clans who were expected to join, the prince at once resolved to\r\nraise his standard, and to declare open war against “the Elector of\r\nHanover,” as George II. was called, “and his adherents.” The Marquis\r\nof Tullibardine, to whom, from his rank, was allotted the honour of\r\nunfurling the standard, took his station on a small knoll in the\r\ncentre of the vale,[837] where, supported by two men, he displayed\r\nthe banner, and proclaimed the Chevalier de St. George as king before\r\nthe assembled host, who rent the air with their acclamations. The\r\nflag used upon this occasion was of silk, of a white, blue, and red\r\ntexture, but without any motto. After proclamation, a commission from\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George, appointing his son Prince Charles regent\r\nof these kingdoms, was read by the Marquis of Tullibardine.\r\n\r\nThe reading of this commission was succeeded by the following\r\nmanifesto:--\r\n\r\n  “James VIII. by the Grace of God, King of Scotland, England,\r\n  France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all our loving\r\n  subjects, of what degree or quality soever, greeting.\r\n\r\n  “Having always borne the most constant affection to our ancient\r\n  kingdom of Scotland, from whence we derive our royal origin, and\r\n  where our progenitors have swayed the sceptre with glory through\r\n  a longer succession of kings than any monarchy upon earth can at\r\n  this day boast of; we cannot but behold with the deepest concern the\r\n  miseries they suffer under a foreign usurpation, and the intolerable\r\n  burdens daily added to their yoke, which become yet more sensible to\r\n  us when we consider the constant zeal and affection the generality\r\n  of our subjects of that our ancient kingdom have expressed for us on\r\n  all occasions, and particularly when we had the satisfaction of being\r\n  ourselves amongst them.\r\n\r\n  “We see a nation always famous for valour, and highly esteemed by\r\n  the greatest of foreign potentates, reduced to the condition of\r\n  a province, under the specious pretence of an union with a more\r\n  powerful neighbour. In consequence of this pretended union, grievous\r\n  and unprecedented taxes have been laid on, and levied with severity\r\n  in spite of all the representations that could be made to the\r\n  contrary; and these have not failed to produce that poverty and decay\r\n  of trade which were easily foreseen to be the necessary consequences\r\n  of such oppressive measures.\r\n\r\n  “To prevent the just resentment which could not but arise from\r\n  such usage, our faithful Highlanders, a people always trained up\r\n  and inured to arms, have been deprived of them; forts and citadels\r\n  have been built and garrisoned where no foreign invasion could\r\n  be apprehended, and a military government has been effectually\r\n  introduced, as into a conquered country. It is easy to foresee\r\n  what must be the consequences of such violent and unprecedented\r\n  proceedings, if a timely remedy be not put to them; neither is it\r\n  less manifest that such a remedy can ever be obtained but by our\r\n  restoration to the throne of our ancestors, into whose royal heart\r\n  such destructive maxims could never find admittance.\r\n\r\n  “We think it needless to call to mind how solicitous we have ever\r\n  been, and how often we have ventured our royal person, to compass\r\n  this great end; which the Divine Providence seems now to have\r\n  furnished us with the means of doing effectually by enabling our\r\n  good subjects in England to shake off the yoke, under which they\r\n  have likewise felt their share of the common calamities. Our former\r\n  experience leaves us no room to doubt of the cheerful and hearty\r\n  concurrence of our Scots subjects on this occasion, towards the\r\n  perfecting the great and glorious work; but that none may be deterred\r\n  by the memory of past miscarriages from returning to their duty, and\r\n  being restored to the happiness they formerly enjoyed, we in this\r\n  public manner think fit to make known our gracious intentions towards\r\n  all our people.\r\n\r\n  “We do therefore, by this our royal declaration, absolutely and\r\n  effectually pardon and remit all treasons, and other crimes hitherto\r\n  committed against our royal father, or ourselves. From the benefit of\r\n  which pardon we except none, but such as shall, after the publication\r\n  hereof, wilfully and maliciously oppose us, or those who shall appear\r\n  or endeavour to appear in arms for our service.\r\n\r\n  “We farther declare that we will with all convenient speed call\r\n  a free parliament; that by the advice and assistance of such an\r\n  assembly, we may be enabled to repair the breaches caused by so long\r\n  an usurpation, to redress all grievances, and to free our people from\r\n  the unsupportable burden of the malt-tax, and all other hardships\r\n  and impositions which have been the consequences of the pretended\r\n  union; that so the nation may be restored to that honour, liberty,\r\n  and independency, which it formerly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n  “We likewise promise upon our royal word to protect, secure, and\r\n  maintain all our Protestant subjects in the free exercise of their\r\n  religion, and in the full enjoyment of all their rights, privileges,\r\n  and immunities, and in the secure possession of all churches,\r\n  universities, colleges, and schools, conform to the laws of the land.\r\n\r\n  “All this we shall be ready to confirm in our first parliament;\r\n  in which we promise to pass any act or acts that shall be judged\r\n  necessary to secure each private person in the full possession of\r\n  his liberty and property, to advance trade, to relieve the poor, and\r\n  establish the general welfare and tranquillity of the nation. In all\r\n  such matters we are fully resolved to act always by the advice of\r\n  our parliaments, and to value none of our titles so much as that of\r\n  _common father of our people_, which we shall ever show ourselves to\r\n  be by our constant endeavours to promote the quiet and happiness of\r\n  all our subjects. And we shall be particularly solicitous to settle,\r\n  encourage, and maintain the fishery and linen manufactures of the\r\n  nation, which we are sensible may be of such advantage to it, and\r\n  which we hope are works reserved for us to accomplish.\r\n\r\n  “As for those who shall appear more signally zealous for the recovery\r\n  of our just rights and the prosperity of their country, we shall take\r\n  effectual care to reward them according to their respective degrees\r\n  and merits. And we particularly promise, as aforesaid, our full,\r\n  free, and general pardon to all officers, soldiers, and sailors, now\r\n  engaged in the service of the usurper, whether of the sea or land,\r\n  provided that upon the publication hereof, and before they engage in\r\n  any fight or battle against our forces, they quit the said unjust and\r\n  unwarrantable service, and return to their duty, in which case we\r\n  shall pay them all the arrears that shall be at that time due to them\r\n  from the usurper; we shall grant to the officers the same commissions\r\n  they shall then bear, if not higher; and to all soldiers and sailors\r\n  a gratification of a whole year’s pay for their forwardness in\r\n  promoting our service.\r\n\r\n  “We farther promise and declare, that the vassals of such as shall\r\n  without regard to our present declaration, obstinately persist in\r\n  their rebellion, and thereby forfeit all pretensions to our royal\r\n  clemency, shall be delivered from all servitude they were formerly\r\n  bound to, and shall have grants and charters of their lands to be\r\n  held immediately of the crown, provided they, upon the publication of\r\n  this our royal declaration, declare openly for us, and join heartily\r\n  in the cause of their country.\r\n\r\n  “And having thus declared our gracious intentions to our loving\r\n  subjects, we do hereby require and command them to be assisting to\r\n  us in the recovery of our rights, and of their own liberties; and\r\n  that all our subjects, from the age of sixteen to sixty, do, upon\r\n  the setting up of our royal standard, immediately repair to it,\r\n  or join themselves to such as shall first appear for us in their\r\n  respective shires; and also to seize the horses and arms of all\r\n  suspected persons, and all ammunition, forage, and whatever else may\r\n  be necessary for the use of our forces.\r\n\r\n  “We also strictly command all receivers, collectors, or other persons\r\n  who may be seized of any sum or sums of money levied in the name or\r\n  for the use of the usurper, to retain such sum or sums of money in\r\n  their own hands, till they can pay them to some person of distinction\r\n  appearing publicly for us, and demanding the same for our use and\r\n  service; whose receipt or receipts shall be a sufficient discharge\r\n  for all such collectors, receivers, or other persons, their heirs, &c.\r\n\r\n  “Lastly, we do hereby require all sheriffs of shires, stewards of\r\n  stewartries, and their respective deputies, magistrates of royal\r\n  boroughs, and bailies of regalities, and all others to whom it may\r\n  belong, to publish this our declaration, at the market crosses of\r\n  their respective towns and boroughs, and there to proclaim us under\r\n  the penalty of being proceeded against according to law, for their\r\n  neglect of so necessary and important a duty.”\r\n\r\nAfter this manifesto had been read, the Marquis of Tullibardine\r\nreturned to the prince’s quarters with the standard under an escort\r\nof 50 Camerons. In about an hour after the conclusion of this\r\nceremony, Macdonald of Keppoch joined the prince with 300 of his men;\r\nand in the evening some gentlemen of the name of Macleod, displeased\r\nwith the conduct of their chief, arrived at Glenfinnan, proffered\r\ntheir services to the prince, and offered to return to Skye, and\r\nraise all the men they could in support of his cause. On arriving at\r\nGlenfinnan, Macdonald of Tierndriech presented the prince with an\r\nexcellent horse which he had taken from Captain Scott. The animated\r\nappearance of the glen, which now resounded with the martial strains\r\nof the pibroch, contrasted strongly with the solitary gloom which\r\npervaded when the prince entered it. Instead of the small party which\r\njoined him in the morning, Charles found himself within a few hours\r\nat the head of a body of about 1,200 brave and resolute men, warmly\r\nattached to his person and cause, at least those of them who were\r\nchiefs, and ready and willing to hazard their lives in his service.\r\nCharles was exceedingly delighted at the appearance of his little\r\narmy, and it has been observed that at no other time did he look more\r\ncheerful or display a greater buoyancy of spirits.[838]\r\n\r\nOf the many singular circumstances attending this extraordinary\r\ninsurrection, the utter ignorance in which the personage in whose\r\nname it was undertaken was kept, is not the least. Charles had\r\nindeed written his father on the eve of his departure from France,\r\nacquainting him with the resolution he had taken, but before his\r\nletter reached Rome, the prince was actually at the head of his army.\r\nThe object of Charles in concealing his design from the Chevalier\r\nis obvious. He was aware that his father would have opposed such a\r\nrash attempt, and might probably have applied to the court of France\r\nto prevent his departure; and having taken his resolution, he was\r\ndetermined not to put it in jeopardy by too timely an announcement\r\nof his intentions. Whatever opinion may _now_ be formed of the\r\nprudence of an undertaking, which, had it succeeded, would have been\r\nconsidered as one of the boldest strokes of political wisdom, there\r\ncan be but one sentiment as to the conduct of the prince, in thus\r\nwithholding from his parent all knowledge of the design he had formed\r\nfor accomplishing the object of his daring ambition. Though under the\r\ncorrupt influence of a few interested persons, whom he kept about\r\nhis person,[839] he still retained a sufficient portion of filial\r\nrespect to prevent him from violating the declared injunctions of\r\nhis father; and as no opposition short of actual violence could have\r\ninduced him to forego his resolution of going to Scotland, he avoided\r\nthe disagreeable alternative of disregarding the commands which his\r\nfather would have laid upon him by taking the course he did.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chevalier de St. George received the prince’s letter, which\r\ninformed him that he was to proceed instantly to Scotland, he was\r\ngreatly surprised and agitated;[840] but as the step had been taken,\r\nhe became reconciled to it, and even could not help applauding the\r\ncourage of the prince in entering upon the enterprise. Writing to\r\nthe Duke of Ormond, on the 11th of August, the Chevalier says, “I\r\nhave now by me your letters of the 14th July, and of the 27th,\r\nwhich last came by the courier, which brought me an account of the\r\nresolution the prince had taken, and executed without consulting me,\r\nfor he was very sure I would not have approved it, tho’ I cannot\r\nbut say, that the courage and sentiments he shows on this occasion,\r\nwill always do him honor.”[841] Again in writing to his agent,\r\nSempil, on the same day, he observes, “What takes me up wholly at\r\npresent, is the resolution the prince has taken and executed, without\r\nmy knowledge.... The question now is to look forward, and not to\r\nblame what is past. It is true, I never should have advised the\r\nprince to have taken such a step, but since it is taken it must be\r\nsupported, and whatever be the event, it will certainly turn much\r\nto the prince’s personal honor, nay, even something may be said\r\nto justify what he has done. The usage he met with in France, and\r\nthe dread of a peace, were no doubt strong motives to push him on\r\na rash undertaking, than to sit still; and who knows but what has\r\nhappened, may, in some measure, force the court of France out of\r\nshame to support him, while otherwise perhaps they had continued to\r\nneglect him, and then have abandoned him at last.... The prince’s\r\nexample will, I hope, animate our friends in England; he has ventured\r\ngenerously for them, and if they abandon him, they themselves, and\r\nindeed our country, will be ruined.”\r\n\r\nIt had always been the opinion of the Chevalier--an opinion which\r\nexperience has shown was well founded--that no attempt on Scotland\r\ncould possibly succeed, unless accompanied by a simultaneous\r\nlanding in England; and he now saw the necessity of enforcing this\r\nconsideration more strongly than ever upon the court of France. In\r\nthe letter which Charles had sent him, he desired his father to\r\nwrite to the King of France and Cardinal Tencin, entreating them\r\nfor support. The Chevalier, however, did not confine himself to the\r\nking and to the cardinal, but addressed himself also to the Maréchal\r\nde Noailles, and the whole of the French ministers. Alluding to\r\nthe necessity of supporting the prince by a descent on England,\r\nthe Chevalier says in the letter to Ormond, from which a quotation\r\nhas already been made; “Enfin, since the step is taken, it is\r\ncertainly incumbent on all of us to do our best to support it, and I\r\nam very sure nothing will be wanting on your side for that effect.\r\nMy darkness, my anxiety, and the multiplicity of my reflections on\r\nthis occasion, are so great that I shall not pretend to enlarge\r\non this subject at present. In the mean time, I now write to Lord\r\nMarischal by the way of Paris, and write also directly to the King\r\nof France, and all the ministers, for without a landing in England\r\nis soon made, humanly speaking, it will be impossible for the prince\r\nto succeed.” He repeats almost the same observations in his letter\r\nto Sempil, also referred to: “I know not particularly the grounds he\r\n(the prince) goes upon, but I am afraid there is little room to hope\r\nhe will succeed, except he be vigorously supported by the court of\r\nFrance; and, therefore, we must all of us in our different spheres\r\nleave nothing undone for that effect. I now write myself to the King\r\nof France and all the ministers, and we must be all of us more than\r\never solely and wholly intent on the great object.”\r\n\r\nBut the Chevalier, in his anxiety to procure early succours for the\r\nprince, did not confine himself to words. To pay off the debts which\r\nCharles had contracted before his departure, he immediately remitted\r\na sum of 200,000 francs to O’Bryan, his chief agent at Paris, and\r\nplaced another sum of 50,000 francs in the hands of Waters, junior,\r\nhis banker in Paris, at the disposal of O’Bryan, to meet instant\r\ncontingencies.[842] He afterwards remitted to Waters, through\r\nBelloni, his banker at Rome, 80,000 Roman crowns, and promised\r\nanother remittance of 28,000 in a few weeks, which, he said, would\r\nexhaust his treasury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACFARLANE. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nIn his letter to the King of France, the Chevalier informed him that\r\nhe had learned with great astonishment the departure of the prince\r\nfor Scotland; that knowing well he would never have approved of such\r\na step, he had taken his resolution and put it into effect without\r\nconsulting him; but that being done, he was obliged in sincerity to\r\nconfess that he could not but admire the conduct of the prince in\r\nentering upon the enterprise, which, he was certain, would make a\r\ngreat and favourable impression upon the minds of his adherents. He\r\nstated, however, his conviction, that without the aid of a foreign\r\nforce it was utterly impossible for the prince to succeed, and\r\nhe entreated his majesty to furnish the necessary assistance. He\r\nreminded him that the prince had been invited by him into France,\r\nand although a year and a half had since elapsed, that he certainly\r\nhad not forgot the object which brought his son thither; and that a\r\ncrisis had now arrived, when the smallest delay on the part of his\r\nmajesty might be attended with danger to the success of the brave\r\nattempt which the prince had made, and that he might now, at little\r\nrisk and at a small expense, finish the work which the prince was\r\nabout to commence. As to himself personally, the Chevalier informed\r\nLouis that he had formerly intimated to him that he intended to\r\nresign his rights to the prince; and that his intentions were still\r\nthe same, with this difference, however, that while he formerly\r\nconsidered that such a step would be advantageous for his family, it\r\nhad now become indispensably necessary for his own honour, on account\r\nof his infirmities, as he considered that he should act rashly, and\r\nbe guilty of bad faith towards his subjects, if he pretended to\r\ntake upon himself the cares of government, when he was incapable of\r\nany fatigue either of body or of mind, and consequently unable to\r\ndischarge the duties of a sovereign.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[805] This battle was fought on the 11th May, 1745.\r\n\r\n[806] Letter to Colonel O’Bryan, 16th June, 1745, in _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[807] Lettres et Mémoires du Maréchal de Saxe, Paris, 1794.\r\n\r\n[808] Home’s _Rebellion_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[809] Letter to Colonel O’Bryan, 20th June, 1745, Appendix, No. II.\r\nSee also Sempil’s letter to the Chevalier, Appendix, No. III.\r\n\r\n[810] _Forbes Papers, or Jacobite Memoirs of the Rebellion of 1745_,\r\nedited by Dr. R.

A flying report had, indeed, been spread\r\nin the Highlands in the beginning of summer, that the prince was\r\nto come over in the course of that season; but no person, not in\r\nthe secret of his design, could have imagined that Charles had\r\nany intention to risk his person without being accompanied by a\r\nsufficient body of troops, and no disposition appeared on the part of\r\nFrance to assist him.\r\n\r\nThe report alluded to was first communicated in a letter from “a\r\ngentleman of consideration in the Highlands” to Lord President\r\nForbes, who, on the 2d of July, showed it to Sir John Cope, the\r\ncommander-in-chief in Scotland. Little credit was, however, attached\r\nto the report, either by the writer of the letter or by the\r\npresident. Cope, though equally incredulous, considered it his duty\r\nto communicate the report to the Marquis of Tweeddale, the secretary\r\nof state for Scotland; and to provide against any contingency that\r\nmight occur, he proposed that the forts of Scotland should be well\r\nprovided, and that arms should be transmitted for the use of the\r\nwell-affected clans. In an answer which the marquis wrote upon the\r\n9th, he ordered Cope to keep a strict watch upon the north, but\r\ninformed him, that, as the measures he proposed were considered by\r\nthe lords of the regency acting in behalf of the king during his\r\nmajesty’s absence in Hanover, as likely to create alarm, they had\r\ndeclined to enter into them.[843]\r\n\r\nBut the lords of the regency were soon aroused from their supineness\r\nby advices from abroad that the French court was meditating an\r\ninvasion of Great Britain, and that the eldest son of the Pretender\r\nhad left Nantes in a French man-of-war, and, according to some\r\naccounts, was actually landed in Scotland. On the 30th of July, the\r\nMarquis of Tweeddale wrote to Sir John Cope, communicating to him\r\nthe news which had just been received, and despatched letters of the\r\nsame date to Lord Milton, the Justice Clerk,[844] and to the Lord\r\nAdvocate, with similar intelligence, and enjoining them to keep a\r\nstrict look out,--to concert what was proper to be done in the event\r\nof a landing,--to give the necessary orders for making the strictest\r\ninquiry into the truth of the intelligence,--and to transmit to the\r\nmarquis, from time to time, such information as they were able to\r\ncollect. The Lords Justices, however, without waiting for a return\r\nto these letters, issued, on the 6th of August, a proclamation,\r\ncommanding all his majesty’s officers, civil and military, and all\r\nother loving subjects of his majesty, to use their utmost endeavours\r\nto seize and secure the son of the Pretender, promising at the same\r\ntime a reward of £30,000 to any one who should seize Prince Charles,\r\nand “bring him to justice.”\r\n\r\nThe express sent by the Marquis of Tweeddale reached Edinburgh on the\r\n3d of August, but the advices which had been received in London had\r\npreceded it. The Lord President, in a letter written the day before\r\nto Mr. Pelham,[845] mentions the alarm which, in a state of profound\r\ntranquillity, these advices had created. The report, however, of\r\nthe prince’s intended visit was discredited by the President, who\r\nconsidered the “young gentleman’s game” to be then “very desperate”\r\nin Scotland, the President believing that there was not “the least\r\napparatus for his reception, even amongst the few Highlanders who\r\nwere expected to be in his interest.” As, however, where there was so\r\nmuch at stake, the President wisely judged that no report respecting\r\nthe prince’s movements, however improbable, was to be disregarded,\r\nhe resolved to make his accustomed journey to the north a little\r\nearlier than usual, to the end that, though, as he himself observes,\r\nhis “fighting days” were over, he might give countenance to the\r\nfriends of government, and prevent the seduction of the unwary,\r\nshould the report turn out well-founded. On the 8th of August, Forbes\r\nwrote the Marquis of Tweeddale, stating that the Lord Advocate\r\nand Sir John Cope had informed him of the advices which had been\r\nreceived from abroad, but expressing his disbelief of the report,\r\nwhich he considered “highly improbable.” “I consider the report as\r\nimprobable,” he observes, “because I am confident that young man\r\ncannot with reason expect to be joined by any considerable force\r\nin the Highlands. Some loose lawless men of desperate fortunes may\r\nindeed resort to him; but I am persuaded that none of the Highland\r\ngentlemen, who have ought to lose, will, after the experience\r\nwith which the year 1715 furnished them, think proper to risque\r\ntheir fortunes on an attempt which to them must appear desperate;\r\nespecially as so many considerable families amongst themselves have\r\nlately uttered their sentiments; unless the undertaking is supported\r\nby an arm’d power from abroad, or seconded by an invasion on some\r\nother part of his majesty’s dominions.”[846] To provide against any\r\nemergency which might arise in the north, his lordship proposed\r\nfirst, that a sufficient number of arms should be lodged in the forts\r\nin the Highlands, with directions by whom, and to whom they might be\r\ndelivered out,--a proposal the same in substance as that made by Sir\r\nJohn Cope; and secondly, that money or credit should be lodged in\r\nthe hands of confidential persons in the north, for the use of the\r\npublic service. This last-mentioned measure he considered the more\r\nnecessary, as it could not be expected, as he observed, that private\r\nindividuals would come forward with money, when they recollected that\r\nseveral gentlemen, who, in the year 1715, had advanced large sums out\r\nof their pockets for the public service, had not even been repaid,\r\nfar less rewarded by the government.\r\n\r\nThe Lord President, though a man of sound judgment, and gifted\r\nwith a considerable portion of political foresight, was in this\r\ninstance deceived in his speculations; and Lord Tweeddale, perhaps\r\nmisled by the President, on whose personal knowledge of the state\r\nof the Highlands he placed great reliance, adopted the same views.\r\nIn an answer to the President’s letter, which the marquis wrote on\r\nthe 17th of August, he thus expresses himself: “I own I have never\r\nbeen alarmed with the reports of the Pretender’s son’s landing\r\nin Scotland. I consider it as a rash and desperate attempt, that\r\ncan have no other consequence than the ruin of those concerned in\r\nit.”[847]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, however, on which the President’s letter to Lord\r\nTweeddale was written, all doubts of the arrival and landing of the\r\nprince were removed at Edinburgh. An express came from Lord Milton,\r\nthe Justice Clerk, then at Roseneath, to Sir John Cope, with a letter\r\ndated the 5th, which he had received from Mr. Campbell of Stonefield,\r\nsheriff of Argyle, in which was contained a copy of a letter received\r\nby the latter from Mr. Campbell of Aird, factor to the Duke of Argyle\r\nin Mull and Morvern, announcing the landing of the prince in Arisaig,\r\nand stating that some of the Macdonalds were already up in arms, and\r\nthat other Highlanders were preparing to follow their example. This\r\nnews was confirmed next day, by another express from the laird of\r\nMacleod to the Lord President, dated the 3d of August.[848]\r\n\r\nThis intelligence, which at first was withheld from the public,\r\nwas shortly followed by the arrival of the Gazette, containing the\r\nproclamation for the apprehension of the prince. Nothing was now\r\ntalked of at Edinburgh but the threatened invasion. In the state of\r\nignorance in which the public was still kept, the most contradictory\r\nreports were circulated. A rumour of the departure of Charles from\r\nFrance had indeed been inserted in the Edinburgh Courant a few days\r\nbefore, and the same paper had also, on the back of this report,\r\nstated, upon the alleged information of a foreign journal, that\r\nthe prince had actually landed in the Highlands, and was to be\r\nsupported by 30,000 men and 10 ships of war; but neither of these\r\nstatements appears to have excited any sensation, being generally\r\ndiscredited.[849] Now, however, every person firmly believed that\r\nthe prince had arrived. One day it was confidently asserted that he\r\nhad landed in the western Highlands with 10,000 French troops. Next\r\nday it was affirmed with equal confidence that he had landed without\r\ntroops; but that wherever he came the Highlanders to a man had joined\r\nhim. On the other hand, the Jacobites, who were in the secret of the\r\narrival, anxious to conceal the fact till Charles should be ready to\r\ntake the field, industriously circulated a report that he was still\r\nin France, and had not the least intention of coming over. To divert\r\nthe public attention, they had recourse to the weapons of ridicule.\r\nIn their conversation they represented the preparations of the\r\ncommander-in-chief in a ludicrous light; and to make him contemptible\r\nin the eyes of the public, sent him anonymous letters containing most\r\nabsurd articles of intelligence, which they afterwards circulated\r\nwith scurrilous comments.[850]\r\n\r\nIn the present crisis Sir John Cope acted with more wisdom than has\r\nbeen usually ascribed to him, and certainly with more energy than\r\nhis superiors. Not wishing, however, to trust entirely to his own\r\njudgment, he consulted Lord President Forbes, and the Lord Advocate\r\nand Solicitor General, the law-officers of the crown, upon the\r\ncourse to be adopted under existing circumstances. No man was better\r\nacquainted with every thing appertaining to the Highlands than\r\nForbes; and in fixing upon him as an adviser, Cope showed a laudable\r\ndesire to avail himself of the best advice and information within\r\nhis reach. At the period now in question, the insurrection was in a\r\nmerely inceptive state; and, according to the opinions of those best\r\nqualified to judge, there was little probability that it would assume\r\na formidable character. At all events, sound policy dictated that\r\nthe threatened insurrection should be checked in its bud, and as its\r\nprogress could only be stopped by the presence of a body of troops,\r\nCope proposed, and his proposal received the approbation of the\r\nthree public functionaries before named, to march to the Highlands\r\nwith such troops as he could collect. The number of regular troops\r\nin Scotland did not, it is true, amount to 3,000 men, and some of\r\nthem were newly raised; but there can be little doubt that, by a\r\ntimely and judicious disposition of about two-thirds of this force in\r\nthe disaffected districts, the embers of rebellion might have been\r\nextinguished. The unfortunate result of Cope’s expedition detracts in\r\nno respect from the design he thus formed, though the propriety of\r\nhis subsequent measures may well indeed be questioned.\r\n\r\nHaving formed his resolution, the commander-in-chief sent expresses\r\nto the Secretary of State for Scotland on the 9th and 10th of August,\r\nannouncing his intention of marching to the Highlands. In pursuance\r\nof this resolution he ordered a camp to be formed at Stirling, and\r\nrequired all the officers who were absent from their regiments, to\r\nrepair to their respective posts. About the same time he directed\r\nthe Lord President to take the command of the companies raised in\r\nthe north for Lord Loudon’s Highland regiment, and notified the\r\nappointment to the officers of the regiment commanding in that\r\nquarter. As there was no bread in the country through which he\r\nintended to march, he bought up all the biscuit which the bakers of\r\nEdinburgh and Leith had on hand, and set all the bakers there, as\r\nwell as those of Perth and Stirling, to work night and day to prepare\r\na quantity of bread sufficient to support his army for twenty-one\r\ndays.[851]\r\n\r\nOn receipt of Cope’s letters, the Marquis of Tweeddale laid them\r\nbefore the Lords of the Treasury, who approved of the conduct of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, and particularly of his resolution to march into\r\nthe Highlands with such troops as he could assemble. The secretary\r\nnotified the approbation of their lordships in a letter to Cope; and\r\nso satisfied were they with his plan, that when they understood that\r\nthe march had been delayed only for a day or two, they sent down an\r\nexpress to him, with positive orders to begin his march to the north\r\ninstantly. Their lordships seem not to have been aware of the causes\r\nwhich retarded his march, not the least of which was the want of\r\nmoney, a credit for which did not arrive till the 17th of August. The\r\norder to march reached Edinburgh on the 19th of August, on which day\r\nCope, accompanied by the Earl of Loudon and several officers, set off\r\nfor Stirling, where he arrived in the evening. Thus, by a singular\r\ncoincidence, Charles and his opponent placed themselves at the head\r\nof their respective armies on the same day.\r\n\r\nThe force which Cope found upon his arrival at Stirling consisted of\r\ntwenty-five companies of foot, amounting altogether to 1,400 men, and\r\nsome of Gardiner’s dragoons. Leaving the dragoons, which could be of\r\nno use in a campaign among the mountains, behind him, Cope began his\r\nmarch towards the north on the 20th, carrying along with him four\r\nsmall field-pieces, as many cohorns, and 1,000 stand of spare arms\r\nfor the use of such of the well-affected Highlanders as might join\r\nhim. He carried also with him a considerable number of black cattle\r\nfor the use of the army. Only a part, however, of the bread which\r\nhad been ordered had arrived; but so anxious was Cope to obey his\r\ninstructions, that he began his march with the limited supply he had\r\nreceived, after giving orders to forward the remainder as soon as it\r\nshould arrive at Stirling.\r\n\r\nCope halted on the 21st at Crieff. He was here visited by the Duke\r\nof Athole, and his younger brother, Lord George Murray, the latter\r\nof whom, doubtless, little imagined he was to act the conspicuous\r\npart he afterwards did, as commander of the prince’s army. The duke\r\nattended in consequence of a notice which Cope had sent to him and\r\nthe other leading adherents of the government, through, or in the\r\nneighbourhood of whose territories he meant to pass, requiring them\r\nto raise their men; but neither the duke nor the other chiefs who\r\nhad been applied to seem to have been disposed to obey the call.\r\nLord Glenorchy, who arrived shortly after the duke and his brother,\r\nexcused himself on the ground that he had not had sufficient time.\r\nAs Cope had calculated upon the junction of a considerable body\r\nof Highlanders on his route, he was exceedingly disappointed that\r\nhis expectations were not likely to be realized, and would have\r\ninstantly retraced his steps had the orders of government allowed\r\nhim a discretionary power; but his instructions were too peremptory\r\nto admit of a return to Stirling. Seeing, therefore, no use for the\r\nlarge quantity of spare arms, he sent 700 of them back to Stirling\r\ncastle. This was a judicious step, as from the want of carriages he\r\ncould not have got them transported to Inverness.[852]\r\n\r\nOn the 22d the army advanced to Amulree, where it stopped for a\r\nsupply of bread. Next day it proceeded to Tay bridge, on the 24th to\r\nTrinifuir, reaching Dalnacardoch on the 25th of August. Here Cope\r\nwas met by Captain Sweetenham,--the officer who had been taken\r\nprisoner when on his way to Fort William from Ruthven, and who had\r\nbeen released on his parole. This officer informed Sir John that\r\nhe was carried to Glenfinnan, where he saw the rebels erect their\r\nstandard, and that when he left them on the 21st they amounted to\r\n1,400 men,--that on the road to Dalwhinnie he had met several parties\r\nof Highlanders hastening to join them,--and that on arriving at\r\nDalwhinnie he had been informed that they were 3,000 strong, and were\r\nin full march towards Corriearrick, where they intended to meet him\r\nand give him battle. Notwithstanding this alarming intelligence, Cope\r\nproceeded on his march, and arrived at Dalwhinnie next day. Here he\r\nreceived a letter from Lord President Forbes, written at his seat of\r\nCulloden near Inverness, corroborating the intelligence received from\r\nSweetenham of the advance of the rebels, and of their intention to\r\nmeet him upon Corriearrick.\r\n\r\nCorriearrick, of which the royal army had now come within sight,\r\nand over which it was Cope’s intention to march into Lochaber,\r\nis, as we have already seen, a lofty mountain of immense extent,\r\noccupying no less than nine miles out of the eighteen that form the\r\nlast day’s march from Garviemore to Fort Augustus. It is extremely\r\nsteep on the south side, and appears at a distance to rise almost\r\nas perpendicularly as a wall. Wade, we have seen, carried his road\r\nup this steep ascent by a series of many traverses, the descent on\r\nthe north side being accomplished in much the same manner. As there\r\nare several gullies and brooks on the south side, bridges have been\r\nthrown across, over which the road is carried. These tortuosities,\r\nrendered absolutely necessary from the nature of the ground, almost\r\nquadruple the real distance, which, from base to base, does not\r\nexceed five miles. As the mountain was peculiarly fitted for the\r\noperations of Highlanders, it is evident that in attempting to\r\ncross Corriearrick, Cope, if attacked, would labour under every\r\ndisadvantage; for while his men could not leave the road in pursuit\r\nof their assailants, the latter could keep a running fire from\r\nnumerous positions, from which it would be impossible to dislodge\r\nthem. Cope was warned by the President of the dangers he would run,\r\nand his fears were not a little increased by a report that, on\r\narriving at the bridge of Snugborough, a dangerous pass on the north\r\nside of the mountain, he was to be opposed by a body of Highlanders;\r\nand that, while this party kept him employed, he was to be attacked\r\nin his rear by another body, which was to be sent round the west end\r\nof the hill.[853]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Sir John Cope, from an Original\r\nManuscript in the possession of W. F. Watson, Esq.]\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the intelligence he had received,--distracted by a variety\r\nof reports as to the strength of the enemy, and disgusted with\r\nthe apathy of those on whose support he had relied, Cope called a\r\ncouncil of war at Dalwhinnie, on the morning of the 27th of August,\r\nto which he summoned every field officer, and the commanders of\r\nthe different corps of his little army. He would have acted more\r\njudiciously had he convened a council at Dalnacardoch, when he first\r\nreceived intelligence of the advance of the Highlanders. At this\r\nmeeting, Cope laid before his officers the orders he had received\r\nfrom the secretary of state to march to the north, which were too\r\npositive to be departed from without the most urgent necessity. After\r\nsome deliberation, the council were unanimously of opinion, that\r\nthe general’s original design of marching to Fort Augustus over\r\nCorriearrick, was, under existing circumstances, quite impracticable.\r\nHaving abandoned the design of crossing Corriearrick, the council\r\nnext considered what other course should be adopted. The wisest\r\ncourse certainly, if practicable, would have been to march back\r\nto Stirling, and guard the passes of the Forth; but against this\r\nproposal it was urged, that the rebels, by marching down the side\r\nof Loch Rannoch, would be able to reach Stirling before the king’s\r\ntroops, and that, by breaking down the bridges, they would intercept\r\nthem in their retreat. As it was impossible to remain at Dalwhinnie,\r\nno other course therefore remained, in the opinion of the council,\r\nbut to march to Inverness. This opinion, which was reduced to\r\nwriting, and signed by all the members of the council, was delivered\r\nto Sir John Cope, who, acquiescing in its propriety, immediately\r\nissued an order to march. We must now advert to the proceedings of\r\nthe prince and his friends.\r\n\r\nCharles remained only one night at Glenfinnan. On the 20th of August\r\nhe marched to the head of Loch Lochy, where he encamped. At this\r\nplace, a copy of the proclamation for his apprehension was brought\r\nhim, which exasperated the Highlanders to such a degree that they\r\ninsisted on a counter one being issued, offering a reward for the\r\napprehension of “the Elector of Hanover.” Charles remonstrated\r\nagainst such a step, but he was forced to yield, and accordingly put\r\nforth the following answer:[854]\r\n\r\n  “Charles, Prince of Wales, &c., Regent of the Kingdoms of\r\n  Scotland, England, France, and Ireland, and the dominions\r\n  thereunto belonging:\r\n\r\n“Whereas we have seen a certain scandalous and malicious paper\r\npublished in the style and form of a proclamation, bearing date the\r\n6th instant, wherein, under pretence of bringing to justice, like\r\nour royal ancestor King Charles the I. of blessed memory, there is a\r\nreward of thirty thousand pounds sterling promised to those who shall\r\ndeliver us into the hands of our enemies, we could not but be moved\r\nwith a just indignation at so insolent an attempt. And though, from\r\nour nature and principles, we abhor and detest a practice so unusual\r\namong Christian princes, we cannot but, out of a just regard to the\r\ndignity of our person, promise the like reward of thirty thousand\r\npounds sterling to him, or those, who shall seize and secure till\r\nour farther orders, the person of the Elector of Hanover, whether\r\nlanded or attempting to land in any part of his majesty’s dominions.\r\nShould any fatal accident happen from hence, let the blame be\r\nentirely at the door of those who first set the infamous example.”\r\nThis proclamation, which was dated from the “camp at Kinlocheill,”\r\nwas countersigned by Murray of Broughton, who had lately joined the\r\nprince, and had been appointed his secretary.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d, the prince advanced to Fassefern, the seat of Lochiel’s\r\nbrother, where he passed the night. While at Fassefern, intelligence\r\nwas received by the prince of the march of Sir John Cope from\r\nStirling. Having previously sent off his baggage under an escort of\r\n200 Camerons towards Moy, in Lochaber, Charles put his army in motion\r\non the 24th, and arrived at Moy on the following day. On the 26th,\r\nthe prince crossed the water of Lochy with his army, and proceeded\r\nto the castle of Invergary, in which he took up his quarters for\r\nthe night. During the night, he received an express from Gordon of\r\nGlenbucket, acquainting him, that Sir John Cope was considerably\r\nadvanced in his march to the north, and that he intended to cross\r\nCorriearrick. About the same time, he was visited by Fraser of\r\nGortuleg, who came to him in name of Lord Lovat, to assure him of his\r\nlordship’s services. Fraser advised him to march north, and raise\r\nthe Frasers of Stratherrick, and assured him that Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald, the laird of Macleod, and many of the Mackenzies, Grants,\r\nand Mackintoshes, would join him; but the proposal was opposed by\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine and secretary Murray, the latter of whom\r\nconsidered the early possession of Edinburgh, where he alleged there\r\nwere many persons ready to join the ranks of the insurgents, of more\r\nimportance than any advantages that might be derived by remaining in\r\nthe Highlands.[855]\r\n\r\nThis opinion was adopted by Charles, who next morning proceeded\r\nto Abertarf in Glengarry. He was joined at Low Bridge by 260 of\r\nthe Stewarts of Appin, under the command of Stewart of Ardshiel,\r\nand at Aberchallader, near the foot of Corriearrick, by 600 of the\r\nMacdonells of Glengarry, under the command of Macdonell of Lochgarry;\r\nand by a party of the Grants of Glenmoriston. With these accessions\r\nthe force under Charles amounted to nearly 2,000 men. Charles now\r\nheld a council of war to deliberate upon the course he should\r\npursue,--whether to advance and give battle to Cope, or postpone an\r\nengagement till he should receive additional strength. It was clearly\r\nthe interest of Charles to meet his adversary with as little delay\r\nas possible, and as his forces already outnumbered those opposed to\r\nhim, he could not doubt but that the result of an engagement would\r\nbe favourable to his arms. The council, every member of which was\r\nanimated with an ardent desire to engage Cope, at once resolved to\r\nmeet him. This resolution corresponded with the inclinations of the\r\nclans, all of whom, to use the expression of Fraser of Gortuleg on\r\nthe occasion, were “in top spirits,”[856] and making sure of victory.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the council, and the valorous enthusiasm of\r\nthe clans, acting upon the ardent mind of the prince, created an\r\nexcitement, to which even he, with all his dreams of glory and\r\nambition, had before been a stranger. The generous and devoted people\r\ninto whose hands he had committed the destinies of his house, struck\r\nwith admiration by the condescension, and that easy yet dignified\r\nfamiliarity which never fails to secure attachment, were ready to\r\nencounter any danger for his sake. No man knew better than Charles\r\nhow to improve the advantages he had thus obtained over the minds and\r\naffections of these hardy mountaineers. Becoming, as it were, one\r\nof themselves, he entered into their views,--showed an anxiety to\r\nlearn their language, which he daily practised,--and finally resolved\r\nto adopt their dress. This line of policy endeared him to the\r\nHighlanders, and to it may be ascribed the veneration in which his\r\nmemory is still held by their descendants, at the distance of more\r\nthan a century. Having in this way inspired his faithful Highlanders\r\nwith a portion of his own natural ardour, they in their turn, by the\r\nenthusiasm they displayed, raised his expectations of success to the\r\nhighest possible pitch. A remarkable instance of this was exhibited\r\nbefore commencing the march next morning, when, after putting on his\r\nHighland dress, he solemnly declared, when in the act of tying the\r\nlatchets of his shoes, that he would not unloose them till he came up\r\nwith Cope’s army.[857]\r\n\r\nDesirous of getting possession of the defiles of Corriearrick before\r\nCope should ascend that mountain, Charles began his march from\r\nAberchallader at four o’clock of the morning of the 27th August. His\r\narmy soon reached the top of the hill, and was beginning to descend\r\non the south side, when intelligence was brought the prince, that\r\nCope had given up his intention of crossing Corriearrick and was\r\nin full march for Inverness. Cope had put his army in motion the\r\nsame morning towards Garviemore; but when his van reached Blarigg\r\nBeg, about seven miles and a half from Dalwhinnie, he ordered his\r\ntroops to halt, to face about, and, in conformity with the opinion\r\nof his council, to take the road to Inverness by Ruthven. To deceive\r\nCharles, Cope had left behind, on the road to Fort Augustus, part\r\nof his baggage, some companies of foot, and his camp colours. The\r\nnews of Cope’s flight (for it was nothing else) was received by\r\nthe Highland army with a rapturous shout, which was responded to\r\nby the prince, who, taking a glass of brandy, said, with a jeering\r\nsmile, “Here’s a health to Mr. Cope; he is my friend, and if all\r\nthe usurper’s generals follow his example, I shall soon be at St.\r\nJames’s.” Every man, by the prince’s orders, drank this toast in a\r\nglass of usquebaugh.[858] The Highlanders immediately put themselves\r\nin motion, and marched down the traverses on the south side of the\r\nmountain with great celerity, as if in full pursuit of a flying\r\nenemy, on whose destruction they were wholly bent.\r\n\r\nThe Highland army continued the same rapid pace till it reached\r\nGarviemore, where it halted. A council of war was then held, at which\r\nvarious proposals were made for pursuing and intercepting the enemy;\r\nbut none of them were agreed to. The council finally resolved to\r\nabandon the pursuit of Cope,--to march to the south, and endeavour to\r\nseize Edinburgh; the possession of which was considered, particularly\r\nby secretary Murray, as of the highest importance. This determination\r\nwas by no means relished by the clans, who were eager for pursuing\r\nCope, whose army they expected to have annihilated; but their chiefs\r\nhaving concurred in the resolution, they reluctantly acquiesced. A\r\nparty of 600 Highlanders, however, volunteered to follow Cope under\r\ncloud of night; and undertook to give a good account of his army, but\r\nthe prince dissuaded them from the enterprise.[859]\r\n\r\nFrom Garviemore, Charles despatched Macdonald of Lochgary with a\r\nparty of 200 men, to seize the small fort of Ruthven, in which there\r\nwas a garrison of regular troops; but the vigilance of the commander\r\nrendered the attempt abortive, and the Highlanders were repulsed\r\nwith a trifling loss. A party of Camerons, commanded by Dr. Cameron,\r\nwas sent to the house of Macpherson of Cluny, the chief of the\r\nMacphersons, who commanded a company in the service of government, to\r\napprehend him, and succeeded.[860]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August, the Highland army was again put in motion,\r\nand advanced towards Dalnacardoch. At Dalwhinnie, they were rejoined\r\nby Dr. Cameron and his party, bringing along with them Macpherson\r\nof Cluny, who, after a short interview with the prince, promised\r\nto raise his clan for his service. On giving this assurance he\r\nwas released, and went home to collect his men. Next day, Charles\r\nmarched to the castle of Blair, which had been abandoned by the\r\nDuke of Athole on his approach. The Marquis of Tullibardine took\r\npossession of the castle as his own property, and immediately assumed\r\nthe character of host, by inviting Charles and the Highland chiefs\r\nto supper.[861] To make his guests as comfortable as possible, the\r\nmarquis had written a letter from Dalnacardoch, to Mrs. Robertson\r\nof Lude, a daughter of Lord Nairne, desiring her to repair to the\r\ncastle, to get it put in proper order, and to remain there to do the\r\nhonours of the house on the prince’s arrival.[862]\r\n\r\nAt Blair, Charles was joined by Lord Nairne, and several other\r\nPerthshire gentlemen; but the greater part of the resident gentry had\r\nfled on hearing of the entrance of the Highland army into Athole.\r\nCharles reviewed his army the morning after his arrival at the\r\ncastle, when he found that a considerable number of his men were\r\nwanting. Some officers were immediately sent to bring them up, and\r\nthe only reason they assigned for loitering behind, was that they had\r\nbeen denied the gratification of pursuing Cope.\r\n\r\nFrom Blair, Charles sent forward Lord Nairne, and Lochiel, with\r\n400 men, to take possession of Dunkeld, which they entered on the\r\nmorning of the 3d of September. In this town they proclaimed the\r\nChevalier. After remaining two days at the castle of Blair, Charles\r\nrepaired on the 2d of September to the house of Lude, where he spent\r\nthe night,[863] and next day went to Dunkeld, whence he proceeded\r\nto Lord Nairne’s house, on the road to Perth. While at dinner, the\r\nconversation turning upon the character of the enterprise, and\r\nthe peculiarity of the prince’s situation, some of the company\r\ntook occasion to express their sympathy for the prince’s father,\r\non account of the state of anxiety he would be in, from the\r\nconsideration of those dangers and difficulties the prince would have\r\nto encounter. But Charles, without meaning to depreciate his father’s\r\ncares, observed that he did not pity him half so much as his brother;\r\n“for,” said he, “the king has been inured to disappointments and\r\ndistresses, and has learnt to bear up easily under the misfortunes of\r\nlife; but poor Harry! his young and tender years make him much to be\r\npitied, for few brothers love as we do.”[864]\r\n\r\nCharles spent the night at Nairne-house, and proceeded next day to\r\nPerth, which had been taken possession of by a party of Camerons\r\nthe preceding evening. Attired in a superb dress of tartan, trimmed\r\nwith gold, and mounted on Captain Scott’s charger, Charles entered\r\nthe “fair city,” attended by several gentlemen on horseback. They\r\nimmediately repaired to the cross, and proclaimed the Chevalier;\r\nafter which ceremony Charles was conducted, amid the acclamations\r\nof the people, to the house of Viscount Stormont, which had been\r\nprovided for his residence while in Perth. The magistrates and\r\nsome of the principal inhabitants, following the example set by\r\nmany of the landed proprietors of the county, abandoned the city\r\non the appearance of the Highlanders, and fled to Edinburgh. An\r\nadvanced party under Macdonald of Keppoch, had been sent forward to\r\nseize Dundee; but being informed by some of the inhabitants, who\r\nmet him on the road, that his force was too small for the purpose,\r\nKeppoch applied for a reinforcement; which was accordingly sent off\r\nfrom Perth, about midnight, under Clanranald. These detachments\r\nentered Dundee at day-break, and captured two vessels with arms and\r\nammunition on board, which were sent up the Tay for the use of the\r\nroyal army.\r\n\r\nAt Perth, Charles was joined by the Duke of Perth, Lord Ogilvie and\r\nStrathallan, Robertson of Strowan, Oliphant of Gask, and several\r\nother gentlemen; but the chief personage who rallied under Charles’s\r\nstandard at Perth, and was indeed among the first to appear there,\r\nwas Lord George Murray,[865] immediate younger brother to the Duke\r\nof Athole. He was conducted by his eldest brother, the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, into the presence of the prince. Lord George had taken\r\na share in the insurrection of 1715, and was one of the few persons\r\nwho joined the Spanish forces, which were defeated at Glenshiel\r\nin 1719. He afterwards went abroad, and served several years as\r\nan officer in the King of Sardinia’s army; but having obtained a\r\npardon, he returned from exile, and was presented to George I. by\r\nhis brother the Duke of Athole. Lord George was tall in person, and\r\nthough now past the meridian of life, retained all the qualities of\r\na robust and vigorous constitution. Besides a natural genius for\r\nmilitary operations, in which he had had considerable experience,\r\nLord George was fertile in resources, indefatigable in application,\r\nand brave even to a fault. With sword in hand he was always the first\r\nto rush forward upon the enemy in the day of battle, often saying\r\nto his men, “I do not ask you, my lads, to go before, but to follow\r\nme.” The accession therefore of such a man, at such a crisis, was\r\nof the highest importance to the Jacobite cause. Charles, when at\r\nGlenfinnan, had conferred the post of quarter-master-general of the\r\narmy on O’Sullivan. Aware of the brilliant qualifications of Lord\r\nGeorge, the prince, almost immediately on his arrival at Perth,\r\nappointed him lieutenant-general, to the great satisfaction of the\r\nclans, to whom he was favourably known.\r\n\r\nLord George appointed the Chevalier Johnstone,[866] who had also\r\njoined the prince at Perth, his aide-de-camp, and immediately entered\r\non his duties with alacrity. Though the Highlanders acted in complete\r\nsubordination to their chiefs when in the field of battle, they\r\nhad so little idea of military discipline, that they would absent\r\nthemselves without permission, and roam about the country. This\r\nhappened more particularly on marches, when there was a scarcity\r\nof food, on which occasions they would spread themselves over the\r\nwhole country, in straggling parties, in quest of provisions. The\r\ninconveniences and loss of time, and the great abuses to which such a\r\npractice led, had been strongly felt in the former insurrection, and\r\nhad been witnessed by Lord George himself. To prevent a recurrence of\r\nsuch evils during the present contest, the first thing Lord George\r\ndid, was to advise the prince to appoint proper persons to fill the\r\ncommissariat department, by whose exertions an adequate supply of\r\nfood might be provided for the use of the army, without which, he\r\nsaid, it would be impossible to keep the Highlanders together for\r\nany length of time. That no delay might take place in waiting for\r\nprovisions, in forced marches, or in detached enterprises, which\r\nrequired despatch, he caused a considerable number of small knapsacks\r\nto be made, sufficient to contain a peck of meal each, which the men\r\ncould carry on their backs without any inconvenience. A thousand of\r\nthese knapsacks were sent to Crieff, for the use of the Athole men,\r\nwho were to march south in that direction.[867]\r\n\r\nThe march of Charles into Athole had been so rapid and unexpected,\r\nthat his friends in that district had had no time to gather any\r\nconsiderable force to join him on his route to Perth. He was,\r\ntherefore, under the necessity of remaining a few days at Perth,\r\nto give his adherents time to raise their men. In mustering their\r\ntenants and vassals, some of them are said to have met with\r\nconsiderable difficulties from the unwillingness of their people to\r\ntake up arms, and the Duke of Perth has been charged with the crime\r\nof shooting one or two of his tenants, who were refractory, but the\r\ncharge does not appear sufficiently supported.[868]\r\n\r\nAnother reason for Charles’s stay in Perth was the want of money.\r\nHis treasury had been completely drained by his liberal advances\r\nfor the support of his army; and of the few thousand pounds which\r\nhe brought with him from France, he had only one guinea remaining\r\nwhen he entered Perth. Taking the solitary coin from his pocket, he\r\nshowed it to Kelly, one of the gentlemen who came over with him, and\r\ntold him that it was all the money that now remained; but he added\r\nwith an air of confidence, that the army had received a fortnight’s\r\npay in advance, and that before the expiration of another fortnight\r\nhe would receive a fresh supply.[869] In order to meet pecuniary\r\ndemands, Charles had despatched a circular from Kinlochiel on the 22d\r\nof August to his friends in different parts of Scotland, soliciting\r\nan immediate supply; but up to the time of his arrival at Perth no\r\nmoney appears to have reached him.[870] Shortly thereafter, however,\r\nhis expectations began to be realized by some private pecuniary\r\ncontributions sent by persons well affected to his cause, but who\r\nwere afraid of openly declaring themselves.[871] But Charles did not\r\ntrust to such uncertain supplies to recruit his exhausted treasury.\r\nBesides compelling the city of Perth to contribute £500, he appointed\r\npersons in Perth, Dundee, and other towns in the counties of Perth\r\nand Angus, to collect the public money, by means of which, and the\r\ncontributions of his friends, his coffers were speedily replenished.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Perth, Charles devoted almost all his time to\r\nthe disciplining and training of his men, in writing despatches,\r\nand in a variety of military details to which he had hitherto been\r\nunaccustomed. Though fond of amusement, he never allowed it to\r\noccupy much of his time; and if he accepted a convivial invitation,\r\nit was more from a wish not to disoblige than from a desire to join\r\nin the festivities of his friends. Amid the occupations of the camp\r\nhe did not, however, neglect the outward observances of religion.\r\nFor the first time, it is believed, of his life, he attended the\r\nProtestant service at Perth, on Sunday the 8th of September, rather,\r\nit may be conjectured, to please his Protestant friends, than from\r\nany predilection for a form of worship to which he was an entire\r\nstranger. The text appropriately chosen on this occasion by the\r\npreacher, a Mr. Armstrong, was from Isaiah xiv., verses 1, 2, “For\r\nthe Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and\r\nset them in their own land; and the strangers shall be joined with\r\nthem, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. And the people\r\nshall take them, and bring them to their place; and the house of\r\nIsrael shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants\r\nand handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives\r\nthey were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.”[872] The\r\nnon-juring Jacobite discourse delivered on the occasion in question,\r\nwould certainly form an extraordinary contrast with the democratic\r\nharangues to which Charles’s great-grandfather, Charles I., and his\r\ngrand uncle, Charles II., were accustomed to listen from the mouths\r\nof the stern Covenanters.\r\n\r\nWhile Charles was thus employed at Perth, Sir John Cope was marching\r\nfrom Inverness to Aberdeen. After leaving the direct road to Fort\r\nAugustus, Cope had proceeded by forced marches to Inverness, where\r\nhe arrived on the 29th of August. Here he met the Lord President,\r\nwho communicated to him a letter he had received on his arrival in\r\nthe north, from Sir Alexander Macdonald, informing him of the names\r\nof the chiefs who had joined Charles, and requesting directions how\r\nto act in the event of the insurgent chiefs being forced to retire\r\nto the islands. After consulting with the President, Cope resolved\r\nto march back his army to Stirling, provided he could obtain a\r\nreinforcement of Highlanders from the Whig clans in the neighbourhood\r\nof Inverness. An application was accordingly made to the chiefs; but\r\nas it turned out ineffectual, Cope determined to march to Aberdeen\r\nand embark his troops for the Frith of Forth. The feelings of alarm\r\nand anxiety with which he was agitated on this occasion, are thus\r\ndescribed by himself in a letter which he wrote from Inverness, on\r\nthe 31st of August, to Lord Milton the Justice Clerk:--“I, from the\r\nbeginning, thought this affair might become serious; and sorry I am\r\nthat I was not mistaken: indeed, my lord, it is serious. I know your\r\nactivity and ability in business,--the whole is at stake,--exert your\r\nauthority,--lengths must be gone,--and rules and common course of\r\nbusiness must yield to the necessity of the times, or it may soon be\r\ntoo late. So much fatigue of body and mind I never knew of before;\r\nbut my health continues good, and my spirits do not flag. Much\r\ndepends upon the next step we take. In this country the rebels will\r\nnot let us get at them unless we had some Highlanders with us; and,\r\nas yet, not one single man has joined us, though I have lugged along\r\nwith us 300 stand of arms. No man could have believed that not one\r\nman would take arms in our favour, or show countenance to us; but so\r\nit is.”[873]\r\n\r\nIt is rather singular, that on the same day on which the\r\nabove-mentioned letter was written, the adherents of government\r\nat Edinburgh, who had hitherto derided the attempt of the prince,\r\nshould have been at last aroused to a full sense of the danger they\r\nwere in. Lulled by a false security, they had never, for a moment,\r\ndoubted that Cope would be successful on his expedition in the north;\r\nbut certain intelligence, brought to them by James Drummond or\r\nMacgregor, son of the celebrated Rob Roy, who arrived at Edinburgh\r\non the 26th, began to open their eyes. With the object of throwing\r\nthe government party in the capital off their guard, this man was\r\ndespatched from the Jacobite camp in Lochaber to Edinburgh, with\r\nthe necessary instructions. Enjoying in some degree the confidence\r\nof the whig party, he was the better fitted to impose upon them by\r\nhis misrepresentations. When introduced to the public functionaries\r\non his arrival, he stated that the Highland army was not 1,500\r\nstrong,--that it was chiefly composed of old men and boys, who were\r\nbadly armed, and that from what he saw and knew of them he was sure\r\nthey would fly before Cope’s army. Though unsuccessful, as will be\r\nseen, in this branch of his mission, he succeeded in another which\r\nhe had volunteered to perform, by getting one Drummond, a Jacobite\r\nprinter, to print the prince’s proclamations and manifestoes, which\r\nhe took care to distribute throughout the city among the friends\r\nof the cause. When apprised of the fact of the publication, the\r\nmagistrates, without suspecting Macgregor as the importer of these\r\ntreasonable documents, issued a proclamation, offering a large reward\r\nfor the discovery of the printer.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, at the period in question, and for many years afterwards,\r\nwas confined within narrow limits. It had never been properly\r\nfortified; and its castle, which majestically overtops the city,\r\nand forms the western boundary of that division now called the “Old\r\ntown,” could afford it little security. On the south and on the\r\neast, the ancient city was bounded by a wall varying from ten to\r\ntwenty feet high. On the north side, a lake, easily fordable, called\r\nthe North Loch, now drained and converted into beautiful gardens,\r\nwas its only defence. In several places the old wall had been built\r\nupon, so that dwelling houses formed part of the wall, but these\r\nerections were overlooked by rows of higher houses without the city.\r\nThere were no cannon mounted upon the wall, but in some places it was\r\nstrengthened by bastions and embrasures. The standing force of the\r\ncity consisted of two bodies, called the Town Guard and the Trained\r\nBands, neither of which now exist. The first, which, at the time we\r\nare now treating of, amounted to 126 men, acted in lieu of a police;\r\nand though pretty well versed in the manual and platoon exercise,\r\nwere, from their being generally old men, unfit for military duty.\r\nThe Trained Bands, or Burgher Guard, which was composed of citizens,\r\nand in former times amounted to a considerable number of men, did not\r\nat the period in question exceed 1,000. Anciently, the tallest men\r\nwere armed with pikes, and those of a lower stature with firelocks,\r\nand both were provided with defensive armour. The captain of each\r\ncompany, eight in number, instructed his men one day in every week in\r\nthe exercise of arms;[874] but the pikes and armour were afterwards\r\nlaid aside, and since the Revolution the Trained Bands had appeared\r\nin arms only once in the year, to celebrate the king’s birth-day, on\r\nwhich occasion they were furnished with arms for the service of the\r\nday from a magazine belonging to the city.\r\n\r\nAs it was obvious that, under these circumstances, no effectual\r\nresistance could be made to the entrance of an army into the city,\r\nthe provost and magistrates held a meeting on the 27th of August, at\r\nwhich some of the principal citizens attended, to devise means of\r\ndefence. At this meeting it was resolved to repair the walls and to\r\nraise a regiment of 1,000 men, to be paid by a voluntary contribution\r\nof the inhabitants. A standing committee was, at the same time,\r\nappointed to carry this resolution into effect, and to advise with\r\nthe Lord-Justice-Clerk and other judges then in town, and the crown\r\nlawyers, as to such other steps as might be considered necessary in\r\nthe present crisis. To obtain the requisite permission to embody\r\nthe proposed regiment, an application was sent to London by the\r\nLord Advocate; and leave to that effect was granted on the 4th of\r\nSeptember.[875]\r\n\r\nUp to the 31st of August, no certain intelligence had been received\r\nat Edinburgh of the movements of the Highlanders; but in the evening\r\nof that day the inhabitants were thrown into a state of great\r\nalarm by receiving intelligence of the march of the Highland army\r\ninto Athole, and of the ominous departure of Cope for Inverness.\r\nInstantly the drum beat to arms, and the town-council having met,\r\nthey ordained that the keys of the city should be lodged with the\r\ncaptain of the city guard, and ordered sentries to be placed at each\r\nof the gates, and the city guard to be augmented. As an additional\r\nsecurity, Hamilton’s dragoons, then quartered in the vicinity of\r\nthe city, were kept under arms that night. The repairs of the city\r\nwalls were commenced; orders were issued to place cannon on them, and\r\nto throw up a ditch on the north side of the castle, and arms were\r\nsent from the city magazine to Leith to arm its inhabitants. These\r\npreparations, and the hurry and bustle with which it may be supposed\r\nthey were attended, may appear ludicrous when contrasted with the\r\nresult; but the public functionaries were bound to put the city in\r\nas defensible a state as their means would admit of, and without the\r\nleast possible delay.\r\n\r\nIt would have been perhaps fortunate for the honour of the city,\r\nif on the present occasion the civic authorities had been allowed,\r\nin conjunction with the committee which had been named, to follow\r\nout such measures as they might have deemed necessary for defending\r\nthe city; but, unluckily, there existed a party consisting of\r\nex-magistrates and councillors, who, by the course they adopted,\r\nbrought dissension among the citizens. This party, at the head of\r\nwhich was ex-provost Drummond, “a zealous loyalist, and one of the\r\nmost valuable municipal chiefs whom Edinburgh has possessed,”[876]\r\nhad been succeeded in the town-council by Stewart, the then provost,\r\nand his friends, who, for five years, had kept possession of the\r\nmunicipal government, to the entire exclusion of Drummond and\r\nhis party. Desirous of regaining their lost power, they availed\r\nthemselves of the present opportunity, the elections being at hand,\r\nto instil distrust of the existing magistracy into the minds of\r\nthe electors, by representing the members of the town-council as\r\nJacobitically inclined, and as indifferent to the preservation of\r\nthe city from the rebels. And indeed it appears that Stewart showed\r\nhimself incapable of performing effectually the responsible duties\r\nof his office at this important juncture.[877] The opposition party,\r\npartly, no doubt, to ingratiate themselves still farther with the\r\nelectors, the majority of whom were whigs, and warmly attached to the\r\ngovernment, really showed greater zeal in organising measures for\r\nthe defence of the city. They presented, on the 6th of September, a\r\npetition to the provost, signed by about 100 citizens, praying that\r\nthey, the subscribers, might be authorised to form themselves into an\r\nassociation for the defence of the city,--that they might be allowed\r\nto name their own officers,--and that an application should be made\r\nby the provost to General Guest, for a supply of arms from the castle\r\nfor their use.[878]\r\n\r\nThis petition was laid before an extraordinary meeting of the council\r\nnext day, and the law officers of the crown having given their\r\nopinion that the council could legally authorise an arming of the\r\ninhabitants for the contemplated purpose, they acceded to its prayer,\r\nwith the exception of that part which craved that the volunteers\r\nshould have the nomination of their own officers, a privilege which\r\nthe provost reserved to himself, in virtue of his office of chief\r\nmagistrate. To ascertain the names of the citizens who were willing\r\nto serve as volunteers, a paper was lodged, on the 9th of September,\r\nin the Old-church aisle, and all loyal persons were invited by\r\nhandbills to subscribe: 418 persons joined this association, and were\r\nsupplied with arms from the castle. Simultaneously with the formation\r\nof the association, the magistrates exerted themselves to raise the\r\nregiment they had petitioned for, the warrant for which was received\r\nby the provost on the 8th of September; but their efforts were\r\nineffectual, not being able, after a week’s recruiting, to raise 200\r\nmen. This paltry force, however, was named the Edinburgh regiment, to\r\ndistinguish it from the volunteer association.\r\n\r\nHitherto the repairs of the city walls had been steadily progressing,\r\nand, to the great scandal of the more religious part of the\r\ninhabitants, no cessation took place even upon the Sunday; but\r\nalthough the persons employed upon the walls might plead necessity\r\nin justification of their work on the day of rest, they seem to\r\nhave overlooked that necessity on the 10th of September, the day\r\nwhen the city elections commenced. So great was the anxiety of\r\nall classes to ascertain the names of the craftsmen sent up by the\r\ndifferent incorporations to the council to represent them, that a\r\ntotal suspension of every business took place, and the magistrates,\r\nwho felt little difficulty in procuring men to work upon the Sunday,\r\nnow saw the works almost entirely deserted by the artificers employed\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nA few days after receipt of the intelligence of the march of the\r\nHighlanders into the low country, Captain Rogers, an aide-de-camp of\r\nSir John Cope, arrived at Edinburgh from Inverness, with instructions\r\nto General Guest to send down a number of transports to Aberdeen to\r\ncarry his men to the southern shores of the Frith of Forth. These\r\nvessels sailed from Leith roads on the 10th, under convoy of a ship\r\nof war, and their return was expected with the greatest anxiety by\r\nthe inhabitants of Edinburgh, who were continually looking up to the\r\nweather-cocks to ascertain the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers being officered and organised, were regularly drilled\r\ntwice every day. Cannon were brought up from Leith and mounted on\r\nthe walls, and the defensive works were proceeded with under the\r\nsuperintendence of Maclaurin, the celebrated mathematician, who had\r\nfurnished the designs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[843] Cope’s Trial, p 105.

It was about the price upon my kinsman’s\r\nhead, which, knowing your Majesty’s generous humanity, I am sure,\r\nwill shock you, as it did me, when I was shown the proclamation,\r\nsetting a price upon my head. I smiled, and treated it with the\r\ndisdain I thought it deserved; upon which they flew into a violent\r\nrage, and insisted upon my doing the same by him. As this flowed\r\nsolely from the poor men’s love and concern for me, I did not know\r\nhow to be angry with them for it, and tried to bring them to temper\r\nby representing that it was a mean barbarous principle among princes,\r\nand must dishonour them in the eyes of all men of honour; that I did\r\nnot see how my cousin’s having set me the example, would justify me\r\nin imitating that which I blame so much in him. But nothing I could\r\nsay would pacify them. Some went even so far as to say,--‘Shall\r\nwe venture our lives for a man who seems so indifferent of his\r\nown?’ Thus have I been drawn in to do a thing for which I condemn\r\nmyself.”--_Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[855] Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. pp. 442-484.\r\n\r\n[856] _Culloden Papers_, p. 216.\r\n\r\n[857] _Culloden Papers_, p. 216.\r\n\r\n[858] Henderson’s _History of the Rebellion_, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[859] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[860] Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. pp. 443-485.\r\n\r\n[861] Henderson’s _History of the Rebellion_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[862] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[863] At Lude Charles “was very cheerful, and took his share in\r\nseveral dances, such as minuets, Highland reels, &c.

Some\r\nidea may be formed of the lieutenant-general’s activity, from the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter written on 7th September, by him to\r\nhis brother the marquis, who was then busily employed raising the men\r\non his brother’s estates. “I hope the meal was with you this day--35\r\nbolls--for it was at Inwar last night: It shall be my study to have\r\nmore meal with you on Monday night, for you must distribute a peck\r\na man: and, cost what it will, there must be pocks, (small sacks,)\r\nmade to each man, to contain a peck or two for the men, to have\r\nalways with them. Buy linen, harn, or any thing; for these pocks are\r\nof absolute necessity, nothing can be done without them.... You may\r\nplease tell your own people, that there is a project to get arms for\r\nthem.”--_Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[868] “In the interior of the Highlands absolute submission seems to\r\nhave been easily exacted; but in the outskirts, where, perhaps, there\r\nwas a slight mingling of Lowland population, and where the people\r\nwere not too blind to see that their leaders alone had an interest in\r\nthe rising, considerable opposition was offered to the commands of\r\nthe chief. This was conspicuously visible in the Athole territory.\r\nThe chivalrous Tullibardine was much provoked by the obstinacy of\r\nthe retainers of his house in the valleys round Dunkeld. They had\r\nto be repeatedly threatened with coercive measures, and appear to\r\nhave been literally forced into the service by press-gangs from the\r\nother clans. He had been absent from the country during the whole\r\ninterval between the rebellions, and his brother, who adopted the\r\ninterest of the government, enjoyed his estate. He could not see that\r\nthis affected his divine right as chief any more than it affected\r\nthat of his royal master; but the clan appear to have imperfectly\r\nparticipated in such a principle, and to have abandoned, as he\r\nexpressed it, the virtues of their ancestors.”--Burton’s _Scotland\r\nafter Revolution_, vol. ii. p. 414.\r\n\r\n[869] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[870] Lord Elcho afterwards lent the prince 1,500 guineas.

Before the 11th\r\nhis force was considerably augmented by tributary accessions from\r\nthe uplands of Perthshire, and, as his coffers had been pretty well\r\nreplenished, he resolved to take his departure that day. With this\r\nview, Lord George Murray sent an express to his brother, the Marquis\r\nof Tullibardine, on the 7th, requesting him to march with such forces\r\nas he had collected, on the morning of Tuesday the 10th, so as to\r\nreach Crieff next day, that he might be able to form a junction with\r\nthe main army at Dunblane or Doune the following day.[879]\r\n\r\nCharles, accordingly, left Perth on Wednesday the 11th of September\r\non his route to the south. The van of the army, or rather a few of\r\neach of the clans, reached Dunblane that night, in the neighbourhood\r\nof which they encamped. The greater part of the men lagged behind,\r\nand did not get up till next day, when they appeared to be greatly\r\nfatigued. As this result was imputed to the good quarters they had\r\nenjoyed for the last eight days at Perth, and the want of exercise,\r\nit was resolved that henceforth the army should encamp in the open\r\nair, and be kept constantly in motion. On his march to Dunblane, the\r\nprince was joined by Macdonald of Glencoe,[880] with 60 of his men,\r\nand by James Drummond or Macgregor of Glengyle at the head of 255\r\nMacgregors, the retainers of Macgregor of Glencairnaig.[881]\r\n\r\nHaving been obliged to halt a whole day for the remainder of his\r\narmy, Charles remained in his camp till the 13th, on which day\r\nhe crossed the Forth at the fords of Frew, almost in the face of\r\nGardiner’s dragoons, who retired towards Stirling on the approach of\r\nthe Highland army, without attempting to dispute its passage. While\r\npassing by Doune, Charles received particular marks of attention from\r\nsome of the ladies of Menteith, who had assembled in the house of\r\nMr. Edmondstone of Cambuswallace, in the neighbourhood of Doune to\r\nsee him as he passed. A collation had been provided for him, in the\r\nexpectation that he would have entered the house; but he courteously\r\nexcused himself, and stopping before the house, without alighting\r\nfrom his horse, drank a glass of wine to the healths of his fair\r\nobservers. The daughters of Mr. Edmondstone, who served the prince\r\non this occasion, respectfully solicited the honour of kissing his\r\nhand--a favour which he readily granted; but he was asked to grant\r\na higher favour by Miss Robina Edmondstone, cousin to the daughters\r\nof the host. The favour sought was the liberty “to pree his royal\r\nhighness’s mou.” Charles not being sufficiently acquainted with broad\r\nScotch, was at a loss to comprehend the nature of the request; but on\r\nits being explained to him, he instantly caught her in his arms, and\r\ninstead of allowing her to perform the operation, he himself kissed\r\nher from ear to ear, to the great amusement of the spectators, and\r\nthe envy of the bold recipient’s cousins.[882]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Forth had always been considered one of the most\r\ndaring and decisive steps which a Highland army could take. In their\r\nown country the Highlanders possessed many natural advantages over an\r\ninvading foe, which gave them almost an absolute assurance of success\r\nin any contest even with forces greatly superior in numbers; and,\r\nin the adjoining Lowlands, they could, if worsted, easily retreat\r\nto their fastnesses; but their situation was very different on the\r\nsouth of the Forth, where they were more particularly exposed to be\r\nattacked by cavalry,--a species of force which they greatly dreaded,\r\nand from which they could, if routed, scarcely expect to escape. It\r\nis said, but not upon sufficient authority, that some of Charles’s\r\nofficers at first demurred to the propriety of exposing the army to\r\nthe dangers of a Lowland campaign in the south, but that he would\r\nlisten to no arguments against the grand design he had formed of\r\nseizing the capital. To cheer his men in the hazardous enterprise,\r\nthe dangers of which now, for the first time, began to develop\r\nthemselves, the prince is reported, on arriving on the bank of the\r\nriver, to have brandished his sword in the air, and pointing to the\r\nother side, to have rushed into the water, and darting across, to\r\nhave taken his station on the opposite bank, on which he stood till\r\nall the detachments had crossed, and congratulated each successive\r\ndetachment as it arrived.[883] In crossing the Forth, the prince may\r\nbe said to have passed the Rubicon: he had not only committed himself\r\nin a struggle with a powerful government, but he had, with intrepid\r\ndaring, and with a handful of men, entered a country whence retreat\r\nwas almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the Forth, Charles, accompanied by a party of his\r\nofficers, proceeded to Leckie House, the seat of Mr. Moir, a Jacobite\r\ngentleman, where he dined; but the proprietor was absent, having\r\nbeen seized by a party of dragoons, and carried off to Stirling\r\ncastle the preceding night, in consequence of information having been\r\nreceived at the castle that he was preparing to receive and entertain\r\nthe prince at his house. The army passed the night on the moor of\r\nSauchie, a few miles south from the ford.[884] The prince himself\r\nslept in Bannockburn House, belonging to Sir Hugh Paterson, a zealous\r\nJacobite. During this day’s march great abuses were committed by the\r\nmen in taking and shooting sheep, which the Duke of Perth and others\r\ndid every thing in their power to prevent. Lochiel was so enraged\r\nat the conduct of his men, that he is said to have shot one of them\r\nhimself, as an example to deter the rest.[885]\r\n\r\nNext day Charles put his army in motion towards Falkirk. In passing\r\nby Stirling, a few shots were fired at them from the castle, but\r\nwithout damage. Lord George Murray sent a message to the magistrates\r\nof the town, requiring a supply of provisions; on receiving which\r\nthey immediately opened the gates, and having given notice of the\r\ndemand to the inhabitants, the dealers in provisions went out and met\r\nthe Highland army near Bannockburn, and sold a considerable quantity\r\nof commodities to the men. The army, after receiving this supply,\r\nresumed its march, and finally halted on a field a little to the\r\neastward of Falkirk. Charles took up his abode in Callender House,\r\nwhere he was entertained with the greatest hospitality by the Earl\r\nof Kilmarnock, who gave him assurances of devoted attachment to his\r\ncause. By the earl, Charles was informed that Gardiner’s dragoons,\r\nwho, on his approach to Falkirk, had retired in the direction of\r\nLinlithgow, were resolved to dispute the passage of Linlithgow\r\nbridge with him, and that they had encamped that night in its\r\nneighbourhood.[887]\r\n\r\nOn receiving this intelligence, Charles immediately held a council\r\nof war, at which it was resolved to attack the dragoons during the\r\nnight. For this purpose a detachment of 1,000 well-armed men was\r\ndespatched at one o’clock in the morning under the command of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray. They marched with the utmost order, regularity,\r\nand quietness; but they were disappointed in their object, as the\r\ndragoons had retired during the night to Kirkliston, eight miles\r\nwest from Edinburgh. The detachment entered Linlithgow before\r\nbreak of day, where they were joined by the prince and the rest of\r\nthe army about ten o’clock that morning.[888] The day was Sunday;\r\nbut the prince does not appear to have gratified the burghers by\r\ngoing to church as he had done the citizens of Perth the preceding\r\nSunday. He, however, partook of a repast which some of the Jacobite\r\ninhabitants had prepared for him. The provost preserved a neutrality\r\nby absenting himself from town; but his wife and daughters are said\r\nto have paid their respects to the prince by waiting upon him at the\r\ncross, attired in tartan gowns, and wearing white cockades, and doing\r\nthemselves the honour of kissing his hand.\r\n\r\nAdvancing from Linlithgow about four o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nthe Highland army encamped on a rising ground, nearly four miles\r\neast from Linlithgow, near the twelfth milestone from Edinburgh,\r\nwhere they passed the night. The prince slept in a house in the\r\nneighbourhood. Next morning, Monday the 16th, Charles renewed his\r\nmarch eastwards, and reached Corstorphine, the dragoons all the while\r\nretiring before him as he approached.\r\n\r\nCharles was now within three miles of Edinburgh, and could not\r\nproceed farther in a direct line, without exposing his army to the\r\nfire of the castle guns. To avoid them, he led it off in a southerly\r\ndirection, towards Slateford,--a small village about the distance\r\nof a mile from Corstorphine. The prince fixed his head quarters at\r\nGray’s mills, between two and three miles from the city, and his\r\ntroops bivouacked during the night of the 16th, in an adjoining field\r\ncalled Gray’s Park.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence of the prince’s departure from Perth reached\r\nEdinburgh, the anxiety for the arrival of Cope increased every hour.\r\nThe Jacobites, of whom there was a respectable party in the city,\r\non the other hand, longed for the arrival of Charles. No certain\r\ninformation of the movements of the Highland army reached Edinburgh\r\ntill the morning of Sunday the 15th, when a messenger brought\r\nintelligence that the insurgents were in full march upon the capital,\r\nand that their van had already reached Kirkliston. The last part of\r\nthis information was, however, incorrect.\r\n\r\nAt the time the messenger arrived, all the armed volunteers, in\r\nterms of an order given the preceding evening, were assembled in\r\nthe college yards. About ten o’clock, Drummond, the ex-provost, who\r\nwas captain of a company, which, from its being partly composed of\r\nstudents belonging to the university, was called the college company,\r\nmade his appearance. After consultation with his brother-officers,\r\nhe informed the company of the advance of the Highland army,--that\r\nit had been proposed to General Guest to make a stand with the two\r\ndragoon regiments, and fight the insurgents on their way to the\r\ncity; but that the general did not think the measure advisable, as\r\nthere was not a body of foot to act with the dragoons to draw off\r\nthe fire of the enemy,--that he (Drummond), knowing that he could\r\nanswer for 250 volunteers, if Provost Stewart would allow 50 of the\r\ntown-guard to go along with them, had asked the general if that\r\nnumber would be sufficient; and that Guest had given him an answer\r\nin the affirmative. “Now, gentlemen,” said the ex-provost, “you have\r\nheard the general’s opinion, judge for yourselves. If you are willing\r\nto risk your lives for the defence of the capital of Scotland and the\r\nhonour of your country, I am ready to lead you to the field.” The\r\nvolunteers to whom Drummond seemed particularly to address himself,\r\nthrew up their hats in the air, at the conclusion of this address,\r\nand began a huzza, in which the rest of the company joined.[889]\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the consent of his own company to march, he went\r\nto the other companies in succession; but instead of advising them\r\nto follow the example which his own men had set, he told them that\r\nthough his men were, all of them, going out to conquer or die with\r\nhim, yet that such a resolution was only proper for young unmarried\r\nmen, who were at liberty to dispose of their own lives. Accordingly\r\nvery few of the volunteers in the other companies would give their\r\nconsent; but Drummond’s company becoming clamorous, the others\r\nseemed to yield, and Drummond despatched a messenger to the castle\r\nto inform General Guest that the volunteers were ready to march\r\nout with the dragoons and engage the rebels. At the request of the\r\ngeneral, Provost Stewart ordered a detachment of the town guard\r\nand the Edinburgh regiment to accompany the volunteers. General\r\nGuest, on being informed of this, directed Hamilton’s dragoons, who\r\nwere encamped on Leith links, to march through the city, and join\r\nGardiner’s regiment at Corstorphine.[890]\r\n\r\nFor the first time since they had been embodied, the volunteers now\r\nloaded their pieces. In terms of an order which had been issued the\r\npreceding day, the fire-bell was rung as a signal of approaching\r\ndanger, and the volunteers, who had assembled in the college-yards,\r\ninstantly repaired in a body to the Lawnmarket, the appointed place\r\nof rendezvous. Most of the city ministers had enrolled themselves\r\nas volunteers, but they were absent on the present occasion, being\r\nengaged celebrating divine service in their respective churches.\r\n_Semper parati_ being the motto they had adopted in their new\r\nvocation, they had gone to church equipped _à la militaire_, and\r\nwhen the alarm-bell sounded, were preaching with their swords\r\nby their sides. In an instant the churches were deserted by the\r\nworshippers, and a universal panic seized all classes on learning\r\nthe intelligence. The Lawnmarket, where the volunteers had drawn up\r\nwaiting for the arrival of Hamilton’s dragoons, was soon crowded with\r\ninhabitants: many of them, the wives, sisters, mothers, fathers,\r\nand friends of the devoted volunteers who clustered around them,\r\nand implored them, by ties the most sacred, to desist from the\r\ndangerous enterprise they were about to engage in. The attention of\r\nthe people was diverted for a time by the appearance of Hamilton’s\r\ndragoons who rode up the street. They were received with huzzas\r\nby the volunteers, and the dragoons in passing huzzaed in return,\r\nand with a gasconading air clashed their swords against each other\r\nas they went along. The alarm among the relatives and friends of\r\nthe volunteers was increased, and nothing was to be heard but the\r\ncries and lamentations of unhappy females. These doughty champions,\r\nwho never had any serious intention of exposing their persons to\r\nthe blows of the Highland broad-sword, moved in appearance by the\r\ntears, the entreaties, and embraces of their female friends, seemed\r\nrather inclined to allow the dragoons to shift for themselves; but\r\nneither the expostulations of the men, (for the male relations of the\r\nvolunteers were equally solicitous with the females in dissuading\r\nthe volunteers from marching,) nor the tears of the women, had any\r\neffect upon the volunteers of Drummond’s company, who had agreed to\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nAn order being given to march, Drummond placed himself at the head\r\nof the volunteers of his company, and marched them up the Lawnmarket\r\nand down the West Bow to the Grassmarket: they were followed by\r\nan immense crowd of people lamenting their unhappy fate. Only 42\r\nprivates of Drummond’s company followed him, but he certainly\r\nexpected some accessions from the other companies. Not a single\r\nindividual, however, belonging to them, accompanied him. Finding\r\nhimself and his little party alone, Drummond halted his men near\r\nthe West Port, and sent a lieutenant, named Lindsay, back to the\r\nLawnmarket to ascertain the reason why the volunteers, who were\r\nexpected to follow, had not joined their associates. Lindsay, on his\r\nreturn to the Lawnmarket, found the volunteers, who still remained in\r\nthe street, in great confusion. Several of the officers told Lindsay\r\nthat they themselves were willing to follow Drummond and his party,\r\nbut that very few of their men would consent to march out. On the\r\nother hand, many of the privates complained that they could not get\r\none officer to lead them. After some altercation, Lindsay, with the\r\nassistance of Captain Sir George Preston, and some other officers,\r\nsucceeded in collecting 141, who professed a willingness to march\r\nwith the dragoons, out of about 350 volunteers who had remained\r\nbehind; Lindsay led off these to the Grassmarket, where they joined\r\nDrummond’s party; but if we are to believe a pamphleteer of the day,\r\neven this small force was diminished by the way. The descent of _The\r\nBow_ presenting localities and facilities equally convenient for\r\ndesertion, the volunteers are said to have availed themselves of\r\nthese on their march. The author alluded to facetiously compared this\r\nfalling off “to the course of the Rhine, which rolling pompously its\r\nwaves through fertile fields, instead of augmenting in its course,\r\nis continually drawn off by a thousand canals, and at last becomes a\r\nsmall rivulet, which loses itself in the sands before it reaches the\r\nocean.”[891] The foot now assembled, comprehending the town guard and\r\nthe Edinburgh regiment, which numbered only 189, amounted, exclusive\r\nof officers, to 363 men.[892]\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the departure of the volunteers, Dr. Wishart, principal\r\nof the university of Edinburgh, with others of the city clergy,\r\nproceeded to the Grassmarket, and with great earnestness addressed\r\nthe volunteers, and conjured them by every thing they held most\r\nsacred and dear, to reserve themselves for the defence of the city\r\nby remaining within the walls. Principal Wishart addressed himself\r\nparticularly to the young men of Drummond’s company, some few of\r\nwhom affected to contemn his advice; but it was perfectly evident\r\nthat there was scarcely an individual present, who did not in his\r\nheart desire to follow the advice of the ministers. The volunteers,\r\nhowever, had offered to serve without the walls, and they could not\r\nwithdraw with honour. Drummond, on the departure of the clergy, and\r\nafter a short consultation with his officers, sent a lieutenant with\r\na message to the provost, to the effect, that the volunteers had\r\nresolved not to march out of town without his express permission, and\r\nthat they would wait for his answer. In all this we have no reason\r\nto doubt the sincerity and courage of Drummond, but to the great\r\nsatisfaction of his men, who were at first ignorant of the nature of\r\nthe message, an answer was returned by Provost Stewart, stating that\r\nhe was much opposed to the proposal of marching out of town, and was\r\nglad to find that the volunteers had resolved to remain within the\r\nwalls. No sooner was this answer received, than Drummond returned\r\nwith his men to the college-yards, where they were dismissed for a\r\ntime. The town guard, and the men of the Edinburgh regiment, however,\r\nalthough shamefully deserted by their companions in arms, marched out\r\nof the city on receiving an order to that effect from the provost,\r\nand joined the dragoons at Corstorphine, about four miles west from\r\nEdinburgh, where the regiments of Hamilton and Gardiner formed a\r\njunction.[893]\r\n\r\nSeeing no appearance of the enemy, Colonel Gardiner retired at sunset\r\nwith the two regiments of dragoons, to a field between Edinburgh\r\nand Leith, to pass the night, leaving a party of his men behind him\r\nto watch the motions of the Highlanders; and the foot returned at\r\nthe same time to the city. To guard the city during the night, 600\r\nor 700 men, consisting of the trained bands, the volunteers, and\r\nsome auxiliaries from the towns of Musselburgh and Dalkeith, were\r\nstationed along the walls and at the different gates; but the night\r\npassed off quietly. The same night, Brigadier General Fowkes arrived\r\nfrom London. Early next morning, he received an order from General\r\nGuest, to take the command of the dragoons, and to march to a field a\r\nlittle to the east of Coltbridge, about two miles west from the city,\r\nwhere he was joined in the course of the forenoon by the town guard,\r\nand the Edinburgh regiment.\r\n\r\nFor the first time during their march, the Highlanders descried\r\nsome dragoons as they approached Corstorphine, on the morning of\r\nthe 16th of September. This was the party which Colonel Gardiner\r\nhad left at Corstorphine the preceding evening. To reconnoitre the\r\ndragoons, a few young well-armed Highlanders were sent forward on\r\nhorseback, and ordered to go as near as possible to ascertain their\r\nnumber. These young men rode close up to the dragoons, and by way of\r\nfrolic or defiance, for they could have no intention of attacking the\r\ndragoons, fired their pistols at them. To the utter astonishment of\r\nthe Highlanders, the dragoons, instead of returning the fire, became\r\npanic-struck, and instantly wheeling about, galloped off towards\r\nthe main body. Participating in the fears of his advanced guard,\r\nGeneral Fowkes immediately ordered a retreat, and between three and\r\nfour o’clock in the afternoon, the inhabitants of Edinburgh beheld\r\nthe singular spectacle of two regiments of dragoons flying along the\r\n“Long Dykes,” now the site of Princes Street, when no one pursued.\r\nThe faint-hearted dragoons stopped a short time at Leith, and\r\nafterwards proceeded to Musselburgh. The foot returned to the city.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours before the retreat of the dragoons, a gentleman of the\r\ncity had brought in a message from the prince, requiring a surrender,\r\nand threatening, in case of resistance, to subject the city to all\r\nthe rigours of military usage; but no regard was paid to the message,\r\nand although the messenger had the imprudence (for which he was\r\nsent to prison by the provost,) to communicate the message to the\r\ninhabitants, they manifested no great symptoms of alarm, relying,\r\nprobably, on the resistance of the dragoons. After these had fled,\r\nhowever, the people became exceedingly clamorous, and crowds of the\r\ninhabitants ran about the streets crying, that since the dragoons\r\nhad fled, it was madness to think of resistance. The provost, on\r\nreturning from the West Port, where he had been giving orders after\r\nthe retreat of the dragoons, was met by some of the inhabitants, who\r\nimplored him not to persist in defending the town, for if he did,\r\nthey would all be murdered. He reproved them for their impatience,\r\nand proceeded to the Goldsmiths’ Hall, where he met the magistrates\r\nand town council and a considerable number of the inhabitants, who\r\nhad there assembled. After some consultation, a deputation was sent\r\nto the law-officers of the crown, requiring their attendance and\r\nadvice; but it was ascertained that these functionaries had left the\r\ntown. The captains of the trained bands and volunteers were next sent\r\nfor, and called upon for their opinion as to defending the city,\r\nbut they were at a loss how to advise. The meeting was divided upon\r\nthe question whether the town should be defended or not, and in the\r\ncourse of the debate much acrimony was displayed by the speakers\r\non both sides. The hall being too small to contain the crowd which\r\ncollected, the meeting adjourned to the New church aisle, which was\r\nimmediately filled with people, the great majority of whom called out\r\nfor a surrender, as they considered it impossible to defend the town.\r\nSome persons attempted to support the contrary view, but they were\r\nforced to desist by the noise and clamour of the majority.\r\n\r\nWhile matters were in this train, a letter was handed in from the\r\ndoor addressed to the lord provost, magistrates, and town council of\r\nEdinburgh. The letter was put into the hands of Orrock, the deacon\r\nof the shoemakers, who, on opening it, informed the meeting that it\r\nwas subscribed “Charles, P. R.” On hearing this announcement, the\r\nprovost stopped Deacon Orrock, who was about to read the letter, said\r\nhe would not be a witness to the reading of such a communication,\r\nand rising from his seat, left the place, accompanied by the greater\r\npart of the council and a considerable number of the inhabitants. The\r\nprovost, however, returned to the council-chamber with his friends,\r\nand sent for the city assessors to give their opinion as to whether\r\nthe letter should be read or not. One of these lawyers appeared, but\r\nafraid to commit himself, stated that the matter was too grave for\r\nhim to give an opinion upon. The provost still demurred, but the\r\nassembly getting impatient to know the contents of the letter, his\r\nlordship tacitly consented to its being read. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “_From our Camp, 16th September, 1745._\r\n\r\n  “Being now in a condition to make our way into the capital of\r\n  his majesty’s ancient kingdom of Scotland, we hereby summon you\r\n  to receive us, as you are in duty bound to do; and in order to\r\n  it, we hereby require you, upon receipt of this, to summon the\r\n  town-council and take proper measures for securing the peace and\r\n  quiet of the city, which we are very desirous to protect. But\r\n  if you suffer any of the usurper’s troops to enter the town, or\r\n  any of the cannon, arms, or ammunition in it, (whether belonging\r\n  to the public or private persons,) to be carried off, we shall\r\n  take it as a breach of your duty, and a heinous offence against\r\n  the king and us, and shall resent it accordingly. We promise\r\n  to preserve all the rights and liberties of the city, and the\r\n  particular property of every one of his majesty’s subjects.\r\n  But if any opposition be made to us, we cannot answer for the\r\n  consequences, being firmly resolved at any rate to enter the\r\n  city; and in that case, if any of the inhabitants are found in\r\n  arms against us, they must not expect to be treated as prisoners\r\n  of war.”\r\n\r\nAfter this letter was read, the clamour for surrender became more\r\nloud and general than ever, and, agreeably to the wish of the\r\nmeeting, a deputation, consisting of four members of the council, was\r\nappointed to wait upon the prince immediately, and to request that he\r\nwould grant the citizens time to deliberate on the contents of his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nWhile the meeting was debating the question as to the reading of\r\nCharles’s letter, an incident occurred, which, it is believed, gave\r\nthe finishing stroke to the mock heroism of the volunteers. After the\r\nretreat of the dragoons, the volunteers had assembled, on the ringing\r\nof the fire-bell, at their respective posts, to be in readiness to\r\nobey any instructions which might be sent to them. Four companies,\r\nout of the six, were drawn up in the Lawnmarket between four and\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon, but before they had sufficient time\r\nto recover from the agitation into which they had been thrown by the\r\ncall to arms, a well-dressed person, unknown to those assembled,\r\nentered the Lawnmarket from the West-Bow, in great haste, mounted\r\nupon a grey horse, and galloping along the lines of the volunteers,\r\nintimated, in a voice sufficiently high to be heard by the astonished\r\nvolunteers, that he had seen the Highland army, and that it amounted\r\nto 16,000 men! This “lying messenger did not stop to be questioned,\r\nand disappeared in a moment.”[894] Captain Drummond, soon after this\r\noccurrence, arrived upon the spot, and, after consulting with his\r\nbrother officers, marched up the four companies to the castle, where\r\nthey delivered up their arms. In a short time the other companies\r\nalso went up and surrendered their arms, and were followed by the\r\nother bodies of militia that had received arms from the castle\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock at night, the four deputies left the city to\r\nwait upon the prince at Gray’s Mill; but they had scarcely cleared\r\nthe walls, when intelligence was received by the lord provost and\r\nmagistrates, (who still remained assembled in the council-chamber,)\r\nthat the transports with General Cope’s army on board had arrived\r\noff Dunbar, about 27 miles east from Edinburgh, and that as the wind\r\nwas unfavourable for bringing them up the Frith, Cope intended to\r\nland his troops at Dunbar and march to the relief of the city. As\r\nthis intelligence altered the aspect of affairs, messengers were\r\nimmediately despatched to bring back the deputies before they should\r\nreach their destination, but they did not overtake them. The deputies\r\nreturned to the city about ten o’clock, and brought along with them\r\na letter of the following tenor, signed by Secretary Murray:--\r\n\r\n“His royal highness the prince regent thinks his manifesto, and\r\nthe king his father’s declaration, already published, a sufficient\r\ncapitulation for all his majesty’s subjects to accept with joy. His\r\npresent demands are, to be received into the city as the son and\r\nrepresentative of the king his father, and obeyed as such when there.\r\nHis royal highness supposes, that since the receipt of his letter to\r\nthe provost no arms or ammunition have been suffered to be carried\r\noff or concealed, and will expect a particular account of all things\r\nof that nature. Lastly, he expects a positive answer before two\r\no’clock in the morning, otherwise he will think himself obliged to\r\ntake measures conform.”\r\n\r\nThis letter gave rise to a lengthened discussion in the town-council,\r\nwhich ended in a resolution to send out a second deputation to\r\nthe prince, and, under the pretence of consulting the citizens,\r\nto solicit a few hours’ delay. The deputies accordingly set out\r\nin a coach to the prince’s head-quarters at two o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and had an interview with Lord George Murray, whom they\r\nprevailed upon to second their application for delay. His lordship\r\nwent into the prince’s apartment, and one of the deputies overheard\r\nhim endeavouring to persuade Charles to agree to the request made\r\nby them, but the prince refused. Lord George having reported the\r\nfailure of his attempt to the deputies, was induced by them to return\r\nand make another trial, but he was again unsuccessful. Charles\r\nthen requested that the deputies should be ordered away, and being\r\noffended at Lord George Murray’s entreaties, desired Lord Elcho, the\r\nson of the Earl of Wemyss, who had just joined him, to intimate the\r\norder to them, which he accordingly did.[895]\r\n\r\nApprehensive of the speedy arrival of Cope, Charles resolved not to\r\nlose a moment in obtaining possession of the capital. He saw that\r\nno effectual resistance could be made by the inhabitants in case\r\nof an assault; but as opposition might exasperate the Highlanders,\r\nand make them regardless of the lives of the citizens, he proposed\r\nto his officers that an attempt should be made to carry the city by\r\nsurprise, which, if successful, would save it from the horrors which\r\nusually befall a city taken by storm. The plan of a surprise having\r\nbeen resolved upon, a select detachment of about 900 men, under\r\nLochiel, Keppoch, Ardshiel, and O’Sullivan, was sent under cloud of\r\nnight towards the city. They marched with great secrecy across the\r\nBorough moor, and reached the south-eastern extremity of the city,\r\nwhere they halted. A party of 24 men was thereupon despatched with\r\ndirections to post themselves on each side of the Netherbow Port, the\r\neastern or lower gate of the city, and another party of 60 men was\r\ndirected to follow them half-way up St. Mary’s Wynd, to be ready to\r\nsupport them, while a third body, still farther removed, and finally\r\nthe remainder of the detachment, were to come up in succession to the\r\nsupport of the rest. In the event of these dispositions succeeding\r\nwithout observation from the sentinels on the walls, it had been\r\narranged that a Highlander in a lowland garb should knock at the\r\nwicket and demand entrance as a servant of an officer of dragoons,\r\nwho had been sent by his master to bring him something he had forgot\r\nin the city; and that if the wicket was opened, the party stationed\r\non each side of the gate should immediately rush in, seize the guard,\r\nand make themselves masters of the gate. The different parties\r\nhaving taken the stations assigned them without being perceived by\r\nthe guards, the disguised Highlander knocked at the gate and stated\r\nhis pretended errand; but the guard refused to open the gate, and\r\nthe sentinels on the walls threatened to fire upon the applicant if\r\nhe did not instantly retire. The commanders were puzzled by this\r\nunexpected refusal, and were at a loss how to act. It was now near\r\nfive o’clock, and the morning was about to dawn. The alternative\r\nof an assault seemed inevitable, but fortunately for the city, the\r\nHighlanders were destined to obtain by accident what they could not\r\neffect by stratagem.[896]\r\n\r\nWhile the party at the gate was about to retire to the main body\r\nin consequence of the disappointment they had met with, their\r\nattention was attracted by the rattling of a carriage, which, from\r\nthe increasing sound, appeared to be coming down the High-street\r\ntowards the Netherbow Port. It was, in fact, the hackney coach which\r\nhad been hired by the deputies, which was now on its way back to the\r\nCanongate, where most of the proprietors of hackney coaches at that\r\ntime lived. The Highlanders stationed at the gate stood prepared to\r\nenter, and as soon as it was opened to let out the coach, the whole\r\nparty, headed by Captain Evan Macgregor, a younger son of Macgregor\r\nof Glencairnaig, rushed in, made themselves masters of the gate, and\r\ndisarmed the guard in an instant. In a short time the whole of the\r\nHighlanders followed, with drawn swords and targets, and setting up\r\none of those hideous and terrific yells with which they salute an\r\nenemy they are about to encounter, marched quickly up the street in\r\nperfect order, in expectation of meeting the foe;[897] but to the\r\nsurprise, no less than the pleasure, of the Highlanders, not a single\r\narmed man was to be seen in the street. With the exception of a few\r\nhalf-awakened spectators, who, roused from their slumbers by the\r\nshouts of the Highlanders, had jumped out of bed, and were to be seen\r\npeeping out at the windows in their sleeping habiliments, all the\r\nrest of the inhabitants were sunk in profound repose.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the guard-house and disarmed the guards who were\r\nwithin, the Highlanders took possession of the different gates of\r\nthe city and of the stations upon the walls. They made the guards\r\nprisoners, and replaced them with some of their own men, with as much\r\nquietness as if they had been merely changing their own guard.[898]\r\nThe Highlanders conducted themselves on this occasion with the\r\ngreatest order and regularity, no violence being offered to any\r\nof the inhabitants, and the utmost respect being paid to private\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAnxious about the result, Charles had slept only two hours, and\r\nthat without taking off his clothes. At an early hour he received\r\nintelligence of the capture of the city, and immediately prepared to\r\nmarch towards it with the rest of the army. To avoid the castle guns,\r\nthe prince took a circuitous direction to the south of the city, till\r\nhe reached the Braid burn, when, turning towards the city, he marched\r\nas far as the Buck Stone,[899] a mass of granite on the side of the\r\nturnpike road, near Morningside. On reaching this stone, he drew off\r\nhis army by a solitary cross road, leading to the ground now occupied\r\nby Causewayside and Newington. Arrived near Priestfield, he entered\r\nthe king’s park by a breach, which had been made in the wall, and\r\nproceeded to the Hunter’s bog, a deep valley between Arthur’s Seat\r\nand Salisbury Crags, where his army was completely sheltered from the\r\nguns of the castle.[900]\r\n\r\nCharles was now within the royal domains, and little more than a\r\nquarter of a mile from the royal palace of Holyrood, where his\r\ngrandfather, James II., when Duke of York, had, about 60 years\r\nbefore, exercised the functions of royalty, as the representative\r\nof his brother Charles II. Sanguine as he was, he could scarcely\r\nhave imagined that within the space of one short month, from the\r\ntime he had raised his standard in the distant vale of the Finnan,\r\nhe was to obtain possession of the capital of Scotland, and take\r\nup his residence in the ancient abode of his royal ancestors.\r\nExulting as he must have done, at the near prospect which such\r\nfortuitous events seemed to afford him of realizing his most ardent\r\nexpectations, his feelings received a new impulse, when, on coming\r\nwithin sight of the palace, he beheld the park crowded with people,\r\nwho had assembled to welcome his arrival. Attended by the Duke of\r\nPerth and Lord Elcho, and followed by a train of gentlemen, Charles\r\nrode down the Hunter’s bog, on his way to the palace. On reaching\r\nthe eminence below St. Anthony’s well, he alighted from his horse\r\nfor the purpose of descending on foot into the park below. On\r\ndismounting he was surrounded by many persons who knelt down and\r\nkissed his hand. He made suitable acknowledgments for these marks\r\nof attachment, and after surveying for a short time the palace and\r\nthe assembled multitude which covered the intervening grounds, he\r\ndescended into the park below amid the shouts of the spectators,\r\nwhose congratulations he received with the greatest affability. On\r\nreaching the foot-path in the park, which, from its having been much\r\nfrequented by the Duke of York, afterwards James II., when he resided\r\nat Holyrood, obtained the name of the Duke’s walk, Charles stopped\r\nfor a few minutes to exhibit himself to the people.[901]\r\n\r\nIn person Charles appeared to great advantage. His figure and\r\npresence are described by Mr. Home, an eye-witness, as not ill-suited\r\nto his lofty pretensions. He was in the bloom of youth, tall[902]\r\nand handsome, and of a fair and ruddy complexion. His face, which\r\nin its contour exhibited a perfect oval, was remarkable for the\r\nregularity of its features. His forehead was full and high, and\r\ncharacteristic of his family. His eyes, which were large, and of a\r\nlight blue colour, were shaded by beautifully arched eye-brows, and\r\nhis nose, which was finely formed, approached nearer to the Roman\r\nthan the Grecian model. A pointed chin, and a mouth rather small,\r\ngave him, however, rather an effeminate appearance; but on the whole,\r\nhis exterior was extremely prepossessing, and his deportment was so\r\ngraceful and winning, that few persons could resist his attractions.\r\nThe dress which he wore on the present occasion was also calculated\r\nto set off the graces of his person to the greatest advantage in\r\nthe eyes of the vulgar. He wore a light-coloured peruke, with his\r\nhair combed over the front. This was surmounted by a blue velvet\r\nbonnet, encircled with a band of gold lace, and ornamented at top\r\nwith a Jacobite badge, a white satin cockade. He wore a tartan short\r\ncoat, and on his breast the star of the order of St. Andrew. Instead\r\nof a plaid, which would have covered the star, he wore a blue sash\r\nwrought with gold. His small clothes were of red velvet. To complete\r\nhis costume, he wore a pair of military boots, and a silver-hilted\r\nbroadsword.[903]\r\n\r\nCharles remained some time in the park among the people, but as he\r\ncould not be sufficiently seen by all, he mounted his horse, a fine\r\nbay gelding which the Duke of Perth had presented to him, and rode\r\noff slowly towards the palace. Every person was in admiration at the\r\nsplendid appearance he made on horseback, and a simultaneous huzza\r\narose from the vast crowd which followed the prince in triumph to\r\nHolyrood House. Overjoyed at the noble appearance of the prince, the\r\nJacobites set no bounds to their praises of the royal youth. They\r\ncompared him to King Robert Bruce, whom, they said, he resembled in\r\nhis figure as they hoped he would in his fortune.[904] The Whigs,\r\non the other hand, regarded him differently; and though they durst\r\nnot avow their opinions to the full extent, and were forced to admit\r\nthat Charles was a goodly person, yet they observed that even in\r\nthat triumphant hour when about to enter the palace of his fathers,\r\nthe air of his countenance was languid and melancholy,--that he\r\nlooked like a gentleman and a man of fashion, but not like a hero\r\nor a conqueror. Their conclusion was, that the enterprise he had\r\nundertaken was above the pitch of his mind, and that his heart was\r\nnot great enough for the sphere in which he moved.[905]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Holyrood House in 1745. From an old print.]\r\n\r\nOn arriving in front of the palace Charles alighted from his\r\nhorse, and entering the gate proceeded along the piazza within the\r\nquadrangle, towards the Duke of Hamilton’s apartments.[906] When\r\nthe prince was about to enter the porch, the door of which stood\r\nopen to receive him, a gentleman stepped out of the crowd, drew his\r\nsword, and raising it aloft, walked up stairs before Charles. The\r\nperson who took this singular mode of joining the prince, was James\r\nHepburn of Keith, a gentleman of East Lothian. When a very young man\r\nhe had been engaged in the rebellion of 1715, not from any devoted\r\nattachment to the house of Stuart, (for he disclaimed the hereditary\r\nindefeasible right of kings, and condemned the government of James\r\nII.,) but because he considered the union, which he regarded as the\r\nresult of the revolution, as injurious and humiliating to Scotland,\r\nand believed that the only way to obtain a repeal of that measure,\r\nwas to restore the Stuarts. In speaking of the union, he said that\r\nit had made a Scottish gentleman of small fortune nobody, and that\r\nrather than submit to it, he would die a thousand deaths. For thirty\r\nyears he had kept himself in readiness to take up arms to assert,\r\nas he thought, the independence of his country, when an opportunity\r\nshould occur. Honoured and beloved by both Jacobites and Whigs, the\r\naccession to the Jacobite cause of this accomplished gentleman, whom\r\nMr. Home describes as a model of ancient simplicity, manliness, and\r\nhonour, was hailed by the former with delight, and deeply regretted\r\nby the latter, who lamented that a man whom they so highly revered,\r\nshould sacrifice himself to the visionary idea of a repeal of the\r\nunion between England and Scotland.[907]\r\n\r\nOn his way to the palace Charles had been cheered by the acclamations\r\nof the people; and on his entering that memorable seat of his\r\nancestors, these acclamations were redoubled by the crowd which\r\nfilled the area in front. On reaching the suite of apartments\r\ndestined for his reception, he exhibited himself again to the people\r\nfrom one of the windows with his bonnet in his hand, and was greeted\r\nwith loud huzzas by the multitude assembled in the courtyard below.\r\nHe replied to these congratulations by repeated bows and smiles.\r\n\r\nTo complete the business of this eventful day, the proclamation\r\nat the cross of the Chevalier de St. George as James III., alone\r\nremained. The Highlanders who entered the city in the morning,\r\ndesirous of obtaining the services of the heralds and the\r\npursuivants, to perform what appeared to them an indispensable\r\nceremony, had secured the persons of these functionaries. Surrounded\r\nby a body of armed men, the heralds and pursuivants, several of\r\nwhom had probably been similarly employed on the accession of “the\r\nElector of Hanover,” proceeded to the cross, a little before one\r\no’clock afternoon, clothed in their robes of office, and proclaimed\r\nKing James, amid the general acclamations of the people. The windows\r\nof the adjoining houses were filled with ladies, who testified\r\nthe intensity of their feelings by straining their voices to the\r\nutmost pitch, and with outstretched arms waving white handkerchiefs\r\nin honour of the handsome young adventurer. Few gentlemen were,\r\nhowever, to be seen in the streets or at the windows, and even among\r\nthe common people, there were not a few who preserved a stubborn\r\nsilence.[908] The effect of the ceremony was greatly heightened by\r\nthe appearance of Mrs. Murray of Broughton, a lady of great beauty,\r\nwho, to show her devoted attachment to the cause of the Stuarts,\r\ndecorated with a profusion of white ribbons, sat on horseback near\r\nthe cross with a drawn sword in her hand, during all the time the\r\nceremony lasted.[909]\r\n\r\nWhile the heralds were proclaiming King James at the market-cross of\r\nEdinburgh, Sir John Cope, who, as has been stated, arrived in the\r\nmouth of the Frith of Forth on the 16th, was landing his troops at\r\nDunbar. The two regiments of dragoons had continued their inglorious\r\nflight during the night, and had reached that town, on the morning\r\nof the 17th, “in a condition,” to use the soft expression of Mr.\r\nHome, “not very respectable.” On arriving at Musselburgh, they had\r\nhalted for a short time, and afterwards went to a field between\r\nPreston Grange and Dolphinston, where they dismounted for the purpose\r\nof passing the night; but between ten and eleven o’clock they were\r\naroused by the cries of a dragoon who had fallen into an old coal-pit\r\nfull of water. Conceiving that the Highlanders were at hand, they\r\ninstantly mounted their horses and fled towards Dunbar with such\r\nprecipitation and alarm, that they dropped their arms by the way.\r\nNext morning the road to Dunbar was found strewed with the swords,\r\npistols, and firelocks, which had fallen from the nervous hands of\r\nthese cowards. Colonel Gardiner, who had slept during the night in\r\nhis own house at Preston, near the field where the dragoons were to\r\nbivouack, was surprised, when he rose in the morning, to find that\r\nhis men were all gone. All that he could learn was that they had\r\ntaken the road to Dunbar. He followed them with a heavy heart, which\r\ncertainly did not lighten when he saw the proofs they had left behind\r\nthem of their pusillanimity. These arms were collected and conveyed\r\nin covered carts to Dunbar, where they were again put into the hands\r\nof the craven dragoons.[910]\r\n\r\nThe landing of Cope’s troops was finished on Wednesday, the 17th of\r\nSeptember; but the disembarkation of the artillery and stores was not\r\ncompleted till the 18th. On the last-mentioned day, Mr. Home, the\r\nauthor of the history of this Rebellion, arrived at Dunbar, and was\r\nintroduced to Sir John, as a “volunteer from Edinburgh,” desirous of\r\ncommunicating to him such information as he had personally collected\r\nrespecting the Highland army. He told the general, that being curious\r\nto see the Highland army and its leader, and to ascertain the number\r\nof the Highlanders, he had remained in Edinburgh after they had\r\ntaken possession thereof,--that for the last-mentioned purpose, he\r\nhad visited the different parts they occupied in the city, and had\r\nsucceeded in making a pretty exact enumeration,--that with the same\r\nview he had perambulated the Hunter’s bog, where the main body was\r\nencamped,--and as he found the Highlanders sitting in ranks upon the\r\nground taking a meal, that he was enabled to calculate their numbers\r\nwith great certainty. He stated, from the observations he had been\r\nthus enabled to make, that the whole Highlanders within and without\r\nthe city did not amount to 2,000 men; but that he had been told that\r\nseveral bodies of men from the north were on their march, and were\r\nexpected very soon to join the main body at Edinburgh. In answer\r\nto a question put by Cope, as to the appearance and equipment of\r\nthe Highlanders, Home stated that most of them seemed to be strong,\r\nactive, and hardy men, though many of them were of a very ordinary\r\nsize: and if clothed like Lowlanders, would, in his opinion, appear\r\ninferior to the king’s troops; but the Highland garb favoured them\r\nmuch, as it showed their naked limbs, which were strong and muscular;\r\nand their stern countenances and bushy uncombed hair gave them a\r\nfierce, barbarous, and imposing aspect. With regard to their arms,\r\nMr. Home said that they had no artillery of any sort but one small\r\nunmounted iron cannon, lying upon a cart, drawn by a little Highland\r\npony,--that about 1,400 or 1,500 of them were armed with firelocks\r\nand broadswords,--that their firelocks were of all sorts and sizes,\r\nconsisting of muskets, fusees, and fowling pieces,--that some of the\r\nrest had firelocks without swords, while others had swords without\r\nfirelocks,--that many of their swords were not Highland broadswords\r\nbut French,--that one or two companies, amounting to about 100 men,\r\nwere armed, each of them with the shaft of a pitch-fork, with the\r\nblade of a scythe fastened to it, resembling in some degree the\r\nLochaber axe. Mr. Home, however, added, that all the Highlanders\r\nwould soon be provided with firelocks, as the arms belonging to the\r\ntrain bands of the city had fallen into their hands.[911]\r\n\r\nAt Dunbar, General Cope was joined by some judges and lawyers, who\r\nhad fled from Edinburgh on the approach of the Highlanders. They did\r\nnot, however, enter the camp as fighting men, but with the intention\r\nof continuing with the king’s army, as anxious and interested\r\nspectators of the approaching conflict. Cope found a more efficient\r\nsupporter in the person of the Earl of Home, then an officer in the\r\nguards, who considered it his duty to offer his services on the\r\npresent occasion. Unlike his ancestors, who could have raised in\r\ntheir own territories a force almost equal to that now opposed to\r\nSir John Cope, this peer was attended by one or two servants only, a\r\ncircumstance which gave occasion to many persons to mark the great\r\nchange in the feudal system which had taken place in Scotland, in\r\nlittle more than a century.\r\n\r\nDesirous of engaging the Highland army before the arrival of its\r\nexpected reinforcements, General Cope left Dunbar on the 19th of\r\nSeptember, in the direction of Edinburgh. The cavalry, infantry,\r\ncannon, and baggage-carts, which extended several miles along the\r\nroad, gave a formidable appearance to this little army, and attracted\r\nthe notice of the country people, who, having been long unaccustomed\r\nto war and arms, flocked from all quarters to see an army on the\r\neve of battle; and with infinite concern and anxiety for the result\r\nbeheld the uncommon spectacle. The army halted on a field to the west\r\nof the town of Haddington, sixteen miles east from Edinburgh. As it\r\nwas supposed that the Highlanders might march in the night time, and\r\nby their rapid movements surprise the army, a proposal was made in\r\nthe evening, to the general, to employ some of the young men who\r\nfollowed the camp, to ride betwixt Haddington and Duddingston, during\r\nthe night, so as to prevent surprise. This proposal was approved of\r\nby Cope, and sixteen young men, most of whom had been volunteers\r\nat Edinburgh, offered their services. These were divided into two\r\nparties of eight men each; one of which, subdivided into four parties\r\nof two men each, set out at nine o’clock at night, by four different\r\nroads that led to Duddingston. These parties returned to the camp at\r\nmidnight, and made a report to the officer commanding the piquet,\r\nthat they had not met with any appearance of the enemy. The other\r\nparty then went off, subdivided as before, by the different routes,\r\nand rode about till day-break, when six of them returned and made a\r\nsimilar report, but the remaining two who had taken the coast road\r\nto Musselburgh, did not make their appearance at the camp, having\r\nbeen made prisoners by an attorney’s apprentice, who conducted them\r\nto the rebel camp at Duddingston! The extraordinary capture of these\r\ndoughty patroles, one of whom was Francis Garden, afterwards better\r\nknown as a lord of session, by the title of Lord Gardenstone, and the\r\nother Mr. Robert Cunningham, known afterwards as General Cunningham,\r\nis thus humorously detailed by a writer in the _Quarterly Review_:--\r\n\r\n“The general sent two of the volunteers who chanced to be mounted,\r\nand knew the country, to observe the coast road, especially towards\r\nMusselburgh. They rode on their exploratory expedition, and coming to\r\nthat village, which is about six miles from Edinburgh, avoided the\r\nbridge to escape detection, and crossed the Esk, it being then low\r\nwater, at a place nigh its junction with the sea. Unluckily there\r\nwas at the opposite side a snug thatched tavern, kept by a cleanly\r\nold woman called Luckie F----, who was eminent for the excellence\r\nof her oysters and sherry. The patroles were both _bon-vivants_;\r\none of them whom we remember in the situation of a senator, as it\r\nis called, of the college of justice, was unusually so, and a gay\r\nwitty agreeable companion besides. Luckie’s sign and the heap of\r\nshells deposited near her door, proved as great a temptation to\r\nthis vigilant forlorn-hope, as the wine-house to the abbess of\r\nAndonillet’s muleteer. They had scarcely got settled at some right\r\n_Pandores_, with a bottle of sherry as an accompaniment, when, as\r\nsome Jacobite devil would have it, an unlucky north-country lad, a\r\nwriter’s (_i.e._ attorney’s) apprentice, who had given his indentures\r\nthe slip, and taken the white-cockade, chanced to pass by on his\r\nerrand to join Prince Charlie. He saw the two volunteers through the\r\nwindow, knew them, and guessed their business; he saw the tide would\r\nmake it impossible for them to return along the sands as they had\r\ncome. He therefore placed himself in ambush upon the steep, narrow,\r\nimpracticable bridge, which was then, and for many years afterwards,\r\nthe only place of crossing the Esk, ‘and how he contrived it,’ our\r\nnarrator used to proceed, ‘I never could learn, but the courage and\r\nassurance of the province from which he came are proverbial. In\r\nshort, the Norland whipper-snapper surrounded and made prisoners of\r\nmy two poor friends, before they could draw a trigger.’”[912]\r\n\r\nCope resumed his march on the morning of the 20th of September,\r\nfollowing the course of the post road to Edinburgh, till he came\r\nnear Haddington, when he led off his army along another road, nearer\r\nthe coast, by St. Germains and Seaton. His object in leaving the\r\npost road was to avoid some defiles and inclosures which would have\r\nhindered, in case of attack, the operations of his cavalry. In its\r\nmarch the army was followed by a number of spectators, all anxious to\r\nwitness the expected combat; but they were assured by the officers\r\nthat as the army was now rendered complete by the junction of the\r\nhorse and foot, the Highlanders would not venture to engage. As some\r\npersons who ventured to express a different opinion were looked\r\nupon with jealousy, it is not improbable that the officers who thus\r\nexpressed themselves did not speak their real sentiments.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the post road the general sent forward the Earl of Loudon\r\nhis adjutant-general, with Lord Home and the quarter-master-general,\r\nto select ground near Musselburgh, on which to encamp the army\r\nduring the night; but this party had not proceeded far when they\r\nobserved some straggling parties of Highlanders advancing. The Earl\r\nof Loudon immediately rode back at a good pace, and gave Sir John\r\nthe information just as the van of the royal army was entering the\r\nplain betwixt Seaton and Preston, known by the name of Gladsmuir.\r\nJudging the ground before him a very eligible spot for meeting the\r\nHighlanders, the general continued his march along the high road to\r\nPreston, and halted his army on the moor, where he formed his troops\r\nin order of battle, with his front to the west. His right extended\r\ntowards the sea in the direction of Port Seaton, and his left towards\r\nthe village of Preston. These dispositions had scarcely been made\r\nwhen the whole of the Highland army appeared.\r\n\r\nThe disembarkation of the royal army, and the advance of Cope towards\r\nEdinburgh, were known to Charles in the course of Thursday the 19th.\r\nJudging it of importance that no time should be lost in meeting Cope\r\nand bringing him to action, Charles had left Holyrood house on the\r\nevening of that day, and had proceeded to Duddingston, near which\r\nplace his army was encamped. Having assembled a council of war, he\r\nproposed to march next morning and give battle to Sir John Cope.\r\nThe members of the council having signified their acquiescence, the\r\nprince then asked the Highland chiefs how they thought their men\r\nwould conduct themselves on meeting a commander who had at last\r\nmustered courage to meet them. As Macdonald of Keppoch had served\r\nin the French army, and was considered, on that account, to be a\r\nfit judge of what the Highlanders could do against regular troops,\r\nhe was desired by the other chiefs to give his opinion. Keppoch\r\nobserved that as the country had been long at peace, few or none of\r\nthe private men had ever seen a battle, and that it was not therefore\r\nvery easy to form an opinion as to how they would behave; but that\r\nhe would venture to assure his royal highness that the gentlemen of\r\nthe army would be in the midst of the enemy, and that as the clans\r\nloved both the cause and their chiefs, they would certainly share the\r\ndanger with their leaders. Charles thereupon declared that he would\r\nlead on the Highlanders himself, and charge at their head; but the\r\nchiefs checked his impetuosity by pointing out the ruin that would\r\nbefall them if he perished in the field, though his army should be\r\nsuccessful. They declared that, should he persist in his resolution,\r\nthey would return home and make the best terms they could for\r\nthemselves. This remonstrance had the desired effect upon the young\r\nChevalier, who agreed to take a post of less danger.[913]\r\n\r\nAccording to the calculation of Home, which has been alluded to,\r\nthe Highland army, at the date of the capture of Edinburgh, did not\r\nexceed 2,000 men; but it was increased by about 400 more, by a party\r\nof 150 Maclauchlans who joined it on the 18th, and by an accession of\r\n250 Athole-men on the following day. This force was further augmented\r\nby the Grants of Glenmoriston, who joined the army at Duddingston on\r\nthe morning of Friday the 20th. In pursuance of the resolution of\r\nthe council, the prince put himself at the head of his army on that\r\nmorning, and presenting his sword, exclaimed, “My friends, I have\r\nflung away the scabbard!”[914] This was answered by a loud huzza, on\r\nwhich the army marched forward in one column of three files or ranks\r\ntowards Musselburgh. Passing the Esk by the bridge of Musselburgh,\r\nthe army proceeded along the post road towards Pinkie. On arriving\r\nopposite the south side of Pinkie gardens, Lord George Murray, who\r\nled the van, received information that Sir John Cope was at or near\r\nPreston, and that his intention probably was to gain the high grounds\r\nof Fawside near Carberry. As there was no time to deliberate or wait\r\nfor orders, and as Lord George, who was very well acquainted with\r\nthese grounds, considered the occupation of them by the Highlanders\r\nas of great importance; he struck off to the right at Edgebuckling\r\nBrae, and passing through the fields by the west side of Wallyford,\r\ngained the eminence in less than half an hour, where he waited for\r\nthe rear.[915]\r\n\r\nFrom Fawside hill the prince descried the army of Cope drawn up in\r\nthe manner before described, but its position being different from\r\nthat anticipated, Charles drew off his army towards the left, and\r\ndescending the hill in the direction of Tranent, entered again upon\r\nthe post road at some distance to the west of the village, along\r\nwhich he continued his march. On approaching Tranent the Highlanders\r\nwere received by the king’s troops with a vehement shout of defiance,\r\nwhich the Highlanders answered in a similar strain. About two o’clock\r\nin the afternoon the Highland army halted on an eminence called\r\nBirsley Brae, about half a mile to the west of Tranent, and formed in\r\norder of battle about a mile from the royal forces.\r\n\r\nIn the expectation that the Highlanders were advancing by the usual\r\nroute through Musselburgh, Cope had taken up the position we have\r\ndescribed with his front to the west; but as soon as he observed the\r\nHighlanders on the heights upon his left he changed his front to the\r\nsouth. This change of position, while it secured Cope better from\r\nattack, was not so well calculated for safety as the first position\r\nwas in the event of a defeat. On his right was the east wall of a\r\npark, belonging to Erskine of Grange, which extended a considerable\r\nway from north to south, and still farther to the right was the\r\nvillage of Preston. The village of Seaton was on his left, and the\r\nvillage of Cockenzie and the sea in his rear. Almost immediately in\r\nfront was a deep ditch filled with water, and a strong and thick\r\nhedge. Farther removed from the front, and between the two armies was\r\na morass, the ends of which had been drained, and were intersected by\r\nnumerous cuts. And on the more firm ground at the ends were several\r\nsmall inclosures, with hedges, dry stone walls, and willow trees.\r\n\r\nAs the Highlanders were in excellent spirits, and eager to close\r\nimmediately with the enemy, Charles felt very desirous to comply\r\nwith their wishes; but he soon ascertained, by examining some people\r\nof the neighbourhood, that the passage across the morass, from the\r\nnature of the ground, would be extremely dangerous if not altogether\r\nimpracticable. Not wishing, however, in a matter of such importance\r\nto trust altogether to the opinion of the country people, Lord George\r\nMurray ordered Colonel Ker of Gradon, an officer of some military\r\nexperience, to examine the ground, and to report. Mounted upon a\r\nlittle white pony he descended alone into the plain below, and with\r\nthe greatest coolness and deliberation surveyed the morass on all\r\nsides. As he went along the morass several shots were fired at him,\r\nby some of Cope’s men, from the sides of the ditches; but he paid so\r\nlittle regard to these annoyances that, on coming to a dry stone wall\r\nwhich stood in his way, he dismounted, and making a gap in it led\r\nhis horse through. After finishing this perilous duty he returned to\r\nthe army, and reported to the lieutenant-general that he considered\r\nit impracticable to pass the morass and attack the enemy in front,\r\nwithout risking the whole army, and that it was impossible for the\r\nmen to pass the ditches in a line.[916]\r\n\r\nWhile his lieutenant-general was, in consequence of this information,\r\nplanning a different mode of attack, the prince himself was moving\r\nwith a great part of his army towards Dolphinstone on Cope’s right.\r\nHalting opposite Preston tower he seemed to threaten that flank\r\nof the English general, who, thereupon, returned to his original\r\nposition with his front to Preston, and his right towards the sea.\r\nAs Lord George Murray considered that the only practicable mode of\r\nattacking Cope was by advancing from the east, he led off part of the\r\narmy about sunset through the village of Tranent, and sent notice to\r\nthe prince to follow him with the remainder as quickly as possible.\r\nWhen passing through the village Lord George was joined by fifty of\r\nthe Camerons, who had been posted by O’Sullivan in the churchyard\r\nat the foot of Tranent. This party being within half cannon shot\r\nof Cope’s artillery, had been exposed during the afternoon to a\r\nfire from their cannon, and one or two of the Camerons had been\r\nwounded. To frighten the Highlanders, who, they imagined, had never\r\nseen cannon before, Cope’s men huzzaed at every discharge; but the\r\nCamerons remained in their position, till, on the representation\r\nof Lochiel, who went and viewed the ground, and found his men\r\nunnecessarily exposed, they were ordered to retire in the direction\r\nof Tranent. O’Sullivan, who was in the rear when this order was\r\ngiven, came up on the junction of the party, and asking Lord George\r\nthe meaning of the movement he was making, was told by him, that as\r\nit was not possible to attack the enemy with any chance of success\r\non the west side of the village, he had resolved to assail them from\r\nthe east, and that he would satisfy the prince that his plan was\r\nquite practicable,--that for this purpose he had ordered the army\r\nto march to the east side of the village, where there were good dry\r\nfields covered with stubble, on which the men could bivouack during\r\nthe night,--and that with regard to the withdrawal of the party\r\nwhich O’Sullivan had posted in the churchyard, they could be of no\r\nservice there, and were unnecessarily exposed. On being informed of\r\nthe movement made by Lord George Murray, Charles proceeded to follow\r\nhim, but it was dark before the rear had passed the village. To watch\r\nCope’s motions on the west, Charles left behind the Athole brigade,\r\nconsisting of 500 men under Lord Nairne, which he posted near Preston\r\nabove Colonel Gardiner’s parks.[917]\r\n\r\nAfter the Highland army had halted on the fields to the east of\r\nTranent, a council of war was held, at which Lord George Murray\r\nproposed to attack the enemy at break of day. He assured the members\r\nof the council that the plan was not only practicable, but that it\r\nwould in all probability be attended with success,--that he knew\r\nthe ground himself, and that he had just seen one or two gentlemen\r\nwho were also well acquainted with every part of it. He added, that\r\nthere was indeed a small defile at the east end of the ditches, but\r\nif once passed there would be no farther hinderance, and though, from\r\nbeing obliged to march in a column, they would necessarily consume a\r\nconsiderable time on their march, yet when the whole line had passed\r\nthe defile they would have nothing to do but face to the left, form\r\nin a moment, and commence the attack. Charles was highly pleased with\r\nthe proposal of the lieutenant-general; which having received the\r\nunanimous approbation of the council, a few piquets were, by order of\r\nLord George, placed around the bivouack, and the Highlanders, after\r\nhaving supped, wrapped themselves up in their plaids, and lay down\r\nupon the ground to repose for the night. Charles, taking a sheaf of\r\npease for a pillow, stretched himself upon the stubble, surrounded\r\nby his principal officers, all of whom followed his example. Before\r\nthe army went to rest, notice was sent to Lord Nairne to leave his\r\npost with the Athole brigade at two o’clock in the morning as quietly\r\nas possible. To conceal their position from the English general, no\r\nfires or lights were allowed, and orders were issued and scrupulously\r\nobeyed, that strict silence should be kept, and that no man should\r\nstir from his place till directed.[918]\r\n\r\nWhen Cope observed Charles returning towards Tranent, he resumed his\r\nformer position with his front to the west and his right to the sea.\r\nHe now began to perceive that his situation was not so favourable\r\nas he had imagined, and that while the insurgents could move about\r\nat discretion, select their ground, and choose their time and mode\r\nof attack, he was cramped in his own movements, and could act only\r\non the defensive. The spectators, who felt an interest in the fate\r\nof his army, and who had calculated upon certain success to Cope’s\r\narms during the day, now, that night was at hand, began to forebode\r\nthe most gloomy results. Instead of a bold and decided movement on\r\nthe part of Cope to meet the enemy, they observed that he had spent\r\nthe day in doing absolutely nothing,--that he was in fact hemmed in\r\nby the Highlanders, and forced at pleasure to change his position at\r\nevery movement they were pleased to make. They dreaded that an army\r\nwhich was obliged to act thus upon the defensive, and which would,\r\ntherefore, be obliged to pass the ensuing night under arms, could not\r\nsuccessfully resist an attack next morning from men, who, sheltered\r\nfrom the cold by their plaids, could enjoy the sweets of repose and\r\nrise fresh and vigorous for battle.[919]\r\n\r\nTo secure his army from surprise during the night, Cope placed\r\nadvanced piquets of horse and foot along the side of the morass,\r\nextending nearly as far east as the village of Seaton. He, at the\r\nsame time, sent his baggage and military chest down to Cockenzie\r\nunder a guard of 40 men of the line and all the Highlanders of the\r\narmy, consisting of four companies, viz., two of newly raised men\r\nbelonging to Loudon’s regiments, and two additional companies of Lord\r\nJohn Murray’s regiment, which had been diminished by desertion to\r\nfifteen men each.[920] Although the weather had been very fine, and\r\nthe days were still warm, yet the nights were now getting cold and\r\noccasionally frosty. As the night in question, that of Friday the\r\n20th of September, was very cold, Cope ordered fires to be kindled\r\nalong the front of his line, to keep his men warm. During the night\r\nhe amused himself by firing off, at random, some cohorns,[921]\r\nprobably to alarm the Highlanders or disturb their slumbers, but\r\nthese hardy mountaineers, if perchance they awoke for a time,\r\ndisregarded these empty bravadoes, and fell back again into the arms\r\nof sleep.\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers the army of Cope was rather inferior to that of\r\nCharles; but many of the Highlanders were badly armed, and some of\r\nthem were without arms. The royal forces amounted altogether to about\r\n2,300 men; but the number in the field was diminished to 2,100 by\r\nthe separation of the baggage-guard which was sent to Cockenzie. The\r\norder of battle formed by Cope along the north side of the morass was\r\nas follows:--He drew up his foot in one line, in the centre of which\r\nwere eight companies of Lascelles’s regiment, and two of Guise’s.\r\nOn the right were five companies of Lee’s regiment, and on the left\r\nthe regiment of Murray, with a number of recruits for different\r\nregiments at home and abroad. Two squadrons of Gardiner’s dragoons\r\nformed the right wing, and a similar number of Hamilton’s composed\r\nthe left. The remaining squadron of each regiment was placed in the\r\nrear of its companions as a reserve. On the left of the army, near\r\nthe waggon-road from Tranent to Cockenzie, were placed the artillery,\r\nconsisting of six or seven pieces of cannon and four cohorns, under\r\nthe orders of Lieutenant-colonel Whiteford, and guarded by a company\r\nof Lee’s regiment, commanded by Captain Cochrane. Besides the regular\r\ntroops there were some volunteers, consisting principally of small\r\nparties of the neighbouring tenantry, headed by their respective\r\nlandlords. Some Seceders, actuated by religious zeal, had also placed\r\nthemselves under the royal standard.[922]\r\n\r\nPursuant to the orders he had received, Lord Nairne left the\r\nposition he had occupied during the night at the appointed hour, and\r\nrejoined the main body about three o’clock in the morning. Instead\r\nof continuing the order of march of the preceding night, it had been\r\ndetermined by the council of war to reverse it. The charge of this\r\nmovement was intrusted to Colonel Ker, who had signalized himself\r\nby the calm intrepidity with which he had surveyed the marsh on\r\nthe preceding day. To carry this plan into effect, Ker went to the\r\nhead of the column, and passing along the line, desired the men to\r\nobserve a profound silence, and not to stir a step till he should\r\nreturn to them. On reaching the rear he ordered it to march from the\r\nleft, and to pass close in front of the column, and returning along\r\nthe line, he continued to repeat the order till the whole army was in\r\nmotion. This evolution was accomplished without the least confusion,\r\nand before four o’clock in the morning the whole army was in full\r\nmarch.[923]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth, who was to command the right wing, was at the\r\nhead of the inverted column. He was attended by Hepburn of Keith,\r\nand Mr. Robert Anderson, son of Anderson of Whitbrough, who, from\r\nhis intimate knowledge of the morass, was sent forward to lead\r\nthe way. A little in advance of the van was a select party of 60\r\nmen doubly armed, under the command of Macdonald of Glenalladale,\r\nmajor of the regiment of Clanranald, whose appointed duty it was\r\nto seize the enemy’s baggage. The army proceeded in an easterly\r\ndirection till near the farm of Ringanhead, when, turning to the\r\nleft, they marched in a northerly direction through a small valley\r\nwhich intersects the farm. During the march the utmost silence was\r\nobserved by the men, not even a whisper being heard; and lest the\r\ntrampling of horses might discover their advance, the few that were\r\nin the army were left behind. The ford or path across the morass\r\nwas so narrow that the column, which marched three men abreast, had\r\nscarcely sufficient standing room, and the ground along it was so\r\nsoft that many of the men were almost at every step up to the knees\r\nin mud. The path in question, which was about two hundred paces to\r\nthe west of the stone-bridge afterwards built across Seaton mill-dam,\r\nled to a small wooden bridge which had been thrown over the large\r\nditch that ran through the morass from east to west. This bridge,\r\nand the continuation of the path on the north of it, were a little\r\nto the east of Cope’s left. From ignorance of the existence of this\r\nbridge, from oversight, or from a supposition that the marsh was\r\nnot passable in that quarter, Cope had placed no guards in that\r\ndirection, and the consequence was, that the Highland army, whose\r\nmarch across could have been effectually stopped by a handful of men,\r\npassed the bridge and cleared the marsh without interruption.[924]\r\n\r\nThe army was divided into two columns or lines, with an interval\r\nbetween them. After the first line had got out of the marsh, Lord\r\nGeorge Murray sent the Chevalier Johnstone, one of his aides-de-camp,\r\nto hasten the march of the second, which was conducted by the prince\r\nin person, and to see that it passed without noise or confusion.\r\nAt the remote end of the marsh there was a deep ditch, three or\r\nfour feet broad, over which the men had to leap. In jumping across\r\nthis ditch, Charles fell upon his knees on the other side, and was\r\nimmediately raised by the Chevalier Johnstone, who says, that Charles\r\nlooked as if he considered the accident a bad omen.[925]\r\n\r\nHitherto the darkness had concealed the march of the Highlanders; but\r\nthe morning was now about to dawn, and at the time the order to halt\r\nwas given, some of Cope’s piquets, stationed on his left, for the\r\nfirst time heard the tramp of the Highlanders. The Highlanders then\r\nheard distinctly these advanced guards repeatedly call out, “Who is\r\nthere?” No answer having been returned, the piquets immediately gave\r\nthe alarm, and the cry of “cannons, cannons; get ready the cannons,\r\ncannoneers,” resounded on Cope’s left wing.[926]\r\n\r\nCharles proceeded instantly to give directions for attacking Cope\r\nbefore he should have time to change his position by opposing his\r\nfront to that of the Highland army. It was not in compliance with any\r\nrule in military science, that the order of march of the Highland\r\narmy had been reversed; but in accordance with an established\r\npunctilio among the clans, which, for upwards of seven centuries,\r\nhad assigned the right wing, regarded as the post of honour, to\r\nthe Macdonalds. As arranged at the council of war on the preceding\r\nevening, the army was drawn up in two lines. The first consisted of\r\nthe regiments of Clanranald, Keppoch, Glengary, and Glencoe,[927]\r\nunder their respective chiefs. These regiments formed the right wing,\r\nwhich was commanded by the Duke of Perth. The Duke of Perth’s men and\r\nthe Macgregors composed the centre; while the left wing, commanded by\r\nLord George Murray, was formed of the Camerons under Lochiel, their\r\nchief, and the Stewarts of Appin commanded by Stewart of Ardshiel.\r\nThe second line, which was to serve as a reserve, consisted of the\r\nAthole-men, the Robertsons of Strowan, and the Maclauchlans. This\r\nbody was placed under the command of Lord Nairne.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cope received intelligence of the advance of the\r\nHighlanders, he gave orders to change his front to the east. Some\r\nconfusion took place in carrying these orders into execution, from\r\nthe advanced guards belonging to the foot not being able to find\r\nout the regiments to which they belonged, and who, in consequence,\r\nstationed themselves on the right of Lee’s five companies, and\r\nthereby prevented the two squadrons of Gardiner’s dragoons, which\r\nhad been posted on the right of the line, from forming properly. For\r\nwant of room the squadron under Colonel Gardiner drew up behind that\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-colonel Whitney. In all other respects the\r\ndisposition of each regiment was the same; but the artillery, which\r\nbefore the change had been on the left, and close to that wing, was\r\nnow on the right somewhat farther from the line, and in front of\r\nWhitney’s squadron.[928]\r\n\r\nThere was now no longer any impediment to prevent the armies from\r\ncoming into collision; and if Cope had had the choice he could not\r\nhave selected ground more favourable for the operations of cavalry\r\nthan that which lay between the two armies. It was a level field of\r\nconsiderable extent without bush or tree, and had just been cleared\r\nof its crop of grain. But unfortunately for the English general, the\r\ncelerity with which the Highlanders commenced the attack prevented\r\nhim from availing himself of this local advantage.\r\n\r\nAfter both lines of the Highland army had formed, Charles addressed\r\nhis army in these words:--“Follow me, gentlemen; and by the\r\nassistance of God I will, this day, make you a free and happy\r\npeople.”[929] He then went up to the right wing and spent a little\r\ntime in earnest conversation with the Duke of Perth and Clanranald,\r\nand, having given his last instructions to them, returned to the\r\nstation which, in compliance with the wish of his council, he had\r\ntaken between the lines, where, surrounded by his guard, he waited\r\nthe signal to advance. If, as alleged by Chevalier Johnstone, Charles\r\nexhibited symptoms of alarm when he fell on crossing the ditch, he\r\nnow certainly showed that fear had no longer a place in his mind.\r\nThe coolness and self-possession which he displayed when giving his\r\norders would have done honour to the most experienced general; but\r\nthese qualities are to be still more valued in a young man playing\r\nthe important and dangerous game that Charles had undertaken.\r\nThe officer to whose tuition Charles had been indebted for the\r\nlittle knowledge he had acquired of Gaelic, mentions an occurrence\r\nindicative of the prince’s firmness on this occasion. In returning\r\nfrom the right wing to his guard after giving his orders to the Duke\r\nof Perth and Clanranald, he saw the officer alluded to passing near\r\nhim, and with a smile, said to him in Gaelic,--“Gres-ort, gres-ort!”\r\nthat is, “Make haste, make haste!”[930]\r\n\r\nBy the time the arrangements for commencing the attack were\r\ncompleted, the morning had fully dawned, and the beams of the rising\r\nsun were beginning to illuminate the horizon; but the mist which\r\nstill hovered over the corn fields prevented the two armies from\r\nseeing each other. Every thing being now in readiness for advancing,\r\nthe Highlanders took off their bonnets, and, placing themselves in an\r\nattitude of devotion, with upraised eyes uttered a short prayer.[931]\r\nAs the Highlanders had advanced considerably beyond the main ditch,\r\nLord George Murray was apprehensive that Cope might turn the left\r\nflank, and to guard against such a contingency, he desired Lochiel,\r\nwho was on the extreme left, to order his men in advancing to incline\r\nto the left.[932]\r\n\r\nLord George Murray now ordered the left wing to advance, and sent an\r\naide-de-camp to the Duke of Perth to request him to put the right in\r\nmotion. The Highlanders moved with such rapidity that their ranks\r\nbroke; to recover which, they halted once or twice before closing\r\nwith the enemy. When Cope, at daybreak, observed the first line of\r\nthe Highland army formed in order of battle, at the distance of two\r\nhundred paces from his position, he mistook it for bushes; but before\r\nit had advanced half way, the rays of the rising sun bursting through\r\nthe retiring mist showed the armies to each other. The army of Cope\r\nat this time made a formidable appearance; and some of Charles’s\r\nofficers were heard afterwards to declare, that when they first saw\r\nit, and compared the gallant appearance of the horse and foot, with\r\ntheir well-polished arms glittering in the sunbeams, with their own\r\nline broken into irregular clusters, they expected that the Highland\r\narmy would be instantly defeated, and swept from the field.[933]\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders continued to advance in profound silence. As the\r\nright wing marched straight forward without attending to the oblique\r\nmovement of the Camerons to the left, a gap took place in the centre\r\nof the line. An attempt was made to fill it up with the second line,\r\nwhich was about fifty paces behind the first, but before this could\r\nbe accomplished, the left wing, being the first to move, had advanced\r\nbeyond the right of the line, and was now engaged with the enemy. By\r\ninclining to the left, the Camerons gained half the ground originally\r\nbetween them and the main ditch; but this movement brought them up\r\ndirectly opposite to Cope’s cannon. On approaching the cannon the\r\nHighlanders fired a few shots at the artillery guard, which alarmed\r\nan old gunner, who had charge of the cannon, and his assistants to\r\nsuch a degree that they fled, carrying the powder flasks along with\r\nthem. To check the advance of the Highlanders, Colonel Whiteford\r\nfired off five of the field pieces with his own hand; but though\r\ntheir left seemed to recoil, they instantly resumed the rapid pace\r\nthey had set out with. The artillery guard next fired a volley\r\nwith as little effect. Observing the squadron of dragoons under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Whitney advancing to charge them, the Camerons\r\nset up a loud shout, rushed past the cannon, and after discharging a\r\nfew shots at the dragoons, which killed several men, and wounded the\r\nlieutenant-colonel, flew upon them sword in hand. When assailed, the\r\nsquadron was reeling to and fro from the fire; and the Highlanders\r\nfollowing an order they had received, to strike at the noses of the\r\nhorses without minding the riders, completed the disorder. In a\r\nmoment the dragoons wheeled about, rode over the artillery guard,\r\nand fled followed by the guard. The Highlanders continuing to push\r\nforward without stopping to take prisoners, Colonel Gardiner was\r\nordered to advance with his squadron, and charge the enemy. He\r\naccordingly went forward, encouraging his men to stand firm; but\r\nthis squadron, before it had advanced many paces, experienced such\r\na reception, that it followed the example which the other had just\r\nset.[934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Battle of Prestonpans.]\r\n\r\nAfter the flight of the dragoons, the Highlanders advanced upon the\r\ninfantry, who opened a fire from right to left, which went down the\r\nline as far as Murray’s regiment. They received this volley with a\r\nloud huzza, and throwing away their muskets, drew their swords and\r\nrushed upon the foot before the latter had time to reload their\r\npieces. Confounded by the flight of the dragoons, and the furious\r\nonset of the Highlanders, the astonished infantry threw down their\r\narms and took to their heels. Hamilton’s dragoons, who were stationed\r\non Cope’s left, displayed even greater pusillanimity than their\r\ncompanions; for no sooner did they observe the squadrons on the\r\nright give way, than they turned their backs and fled without firing\r\na single shot, or drawing a sword.[935] Murray’s regiment being\r\nthus left alone on the field, fired upon the Macdonalds who were\r\nadvancing, and also fled. Thus, within a very few minutes after the\r\naction had commenced, the whole army of Cope was put to flight. With\r\nthe exception of their fire, not the slightest resistance was made by\r\nhorse or foot, and not a single bayonet was stained with blood. Such\r\nwere the impetuosity and rapidity with which the first line of the\r\nHighlanders broke through Cope’s ranks, that they left numbers of his\r\nmen in their rear who attempted to rally behind them; but on seeing\r\nthe second line coming up they endeavoured to make their escape.[936]\r\nThough the second line was not more than fifty paces behind the\r\nfirst, and was always running as fast as it could to overtake the\r\nfirst line, and near enough never to lose sight of it, yet such was\r\nthe rapidity with which the battle was gained, that, according to the\r\nChevalier Johnstone,[937] who stood by the side of the prince in the\r\nsecond line, he could see no other enemy on the field of battle than\r\nthose who were lying on the ground killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the royal infantry, the walls of the inclosures\r\nabout the village of Preston, which formed their great security\r\non their right, now that these were in their rear, operated as a\r\nbarrier to their flight. Having disencumbered themselves of their\r\narms to facilitate their escape, they had deprived themselves of\r\ntheir only means of defence, and driven as they were upon the walls\r\nof the inclosures, they would have all perished under the swords\r\nof the Highlanders, had not Charles and his officers strenuously\r\nexerted themselves to preserve the lives of their discomfited foes.\r\nThe impetuosity of the attack, however, and the sudden flight of the\r\nroyal army, allowed little leisure for the exercise of humanity,\r\nand before the carnage ceased several hundreds had fallen under\r\nthe claymores of the Highlanders, and the ruthless scythes of the\r\nMacgregors. Armed with these deadly weapons, which were sharpened\r\nand fixed to poles from seven to eight feet long, to supply the\r\nplace of other arms, this party mowed down the affrighted enemy,\r\ncut off the legs of the horses, and severed, it is said, the bodies\r\nof their riders in twain. Captain James Drummond, alias Macgregor,\r\nson of the celebrated Rob Roy, who commanded this company, fell at\r\nthe commencement of the action. When advancing to the charge he\r\nreceived five wounds. Two bullets went through his body, and laid him\r\nprostrate on the ground. That his men might not be discouraged by his\r\nfall, this intrepid officer resting his head upon his hand, called\r\nout to them, “My lads, I am not dead!--by God, I shall see if any\r\nof you does not do his duty!” This singular address had the desired\r\neffect, and the Macgregors instantly fell on the flank of the English\r\ninfantry, which, being left uncovered and exposed by the flight of\r\nthe cavalry, immediately gave way.[938]\r\n\r\nOf the infantry of the royal army, only about 170 escaped.[939] From\r\na report made by their own sergeants and corporals, by order of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, between 1,600 and 1,700 prisoners, foot and cavalry,\r\nfell into the hands of the Highlanders, including about 70 officers.\r\nIn this number were comprehended the baggage-guard, stationed at\r\nCockenzie, which amounted to 300 men, who, on learning the fate\r\nof the main body and the loss of their cannon, surrendered to the\r\nCamerons.[940] The cannon and all the baggage of the royal army,\r\ntogether with the military chest, containing £4,000, fell into the\r\nhands of the victors. The greater part of the dragoons escaped by the\r\ntwo roads at the extremities of the park wall, one of which passed by\r\nColonel Gardiner’s house in the rear on their right, and the other\r\non their left, to the north of Preston-house. In retiring towards\r\nthese outlets, the dragoons, at the entreaties of their officers,\r\nhalted once or twice, and faced about to meet the enemy; but as soon\r\nas the Highlanders came up and fired at them, they wheeled about\r\nand fled. Cope, who was by no means deficient in personal courage,\r\nassisted by the Earls of Home and Loudon, collected about 450 of the\r\npanic-struck dragoons on the west side of the village of Preston, and\r\nattempted to lead them back to the charge; but no entreaties could\r\ninduce these cowards to advance, and the whistling of a few bullets\r\ndischarged by some Highlanders near the village, so alarmed them,\r\nthat they instantly scampered off in a southerly direction, screening\r\ntheir heads behind their horses’ necks to avoid the bullets of the\r\nHighlanders. The general had no alternative but to gallop off with\r\nhis men.[941] He reached Coldstream, a town about forty miles from\r\nthe field of battle, that night; and entered Berwick next day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonel James Gardiner, aged 40. From the painting by\r\nVan Deest (1727).]\r\n\r\nAmong six of Cope’s officers who were killed, was Colonel Gardiner,\r\na veteran soldier who had served under the Duke of Marlborough, and\r\nwhose character combined a strong religious feeling with the most\r\nundaunted courage. He had been decidedly opposed to the _defensive_\r\nsystem of Cope on the preceding evening, and had counselled the\r\ngeneral not to lose a moment in attacking the Highlanders; but his\r\nadvice was disregarded. Anticipating the fate which awaited him, he\r\nspent the greater part of the night in devotion, and resolved at all\r\nhazards to perform his duty. He was wounded at the first onset at the\r\nhead of his dragoons; but disdaining to follow them in their retreat,\r\nhe joined a small body of foot, which attempted to rally near the\r\nwall of his own garden, and while fighting at their head was cut\r\ndown by the murderous scythe of a Macgregor, within a few yards of\r\nhis own house. He was carried by a friend to the manse of Tranent in\r\nan almost lifeless state, where he expired within a few hours, and\r\nwas interred in the north-west corner of the church of Tranent.[942]\r\nCaptain Brymer of Lee’s regiment, who appears to have participated\r\nin Gardiner’s opinion as to attacking the Highlanders, met a similar\r\nfate. Having been at the battle of Sheriffmuir, he was satisfied of\r\nthe capability of the Highlanders to contend with regular troops, and\r\ndreaded the result of an encounter if assailed by the Highlanders.\r\nWhen encamped at Haddington, his brother officers were in high\r\nspirits, and making light of the enemy; but Brymer viewed matters\r\nin a very different light. While reading one night in his tent he\r\nwas accosted by Mr. Congalton of Congalton, his brother-in-law, who,\r\nobserving him look pensive and grave, when all the other officers\r\nappeared so cheerful, inquired the reason. Brymer answered that\r\nthe Highlanders were not to be despised, and that he was afraid\r\nhis brother officers would soon find that they had mistaken the\r\ncharacter of the Highlanders, who would, to a certainty, attack the\r\nroyal army, with a boldness which those only who had witnessed their\r\nprowess could have any idea of. These gloomy forebodings were not the\r\nresult of an innate cowardice--for this officer was, as he showed, a\r\nbrave man--but from a well-founded conviction that Cope’s men could\r\nnot stand the onset of such a body of Highlanders as Charles had\r\nassembled. Brymer was killed, with his face to the enemy, disdaining\r\nto turn his back when that part of the line where he was stationed\r\nwas broken in upon by the Highlanders.[943]\r\n\r\nThe loss on the side of the Highlanders was trifling. Four\r\nofficers,[944] and between 30 and 40 privates, were killed; and 5 or\r\n6 officers, and between 70 and 80 privates, wounded.[945]\r\n\r\nAfter the termination of the fight, the field of battle presented an\r\nappalling spectacle, rarely exhibited in the most bloody conflicts.\r\nAs almost all the slain were cut down by the broadsword and the\r\nscythe, the ground was strewed with legs, arms, hands, noses, and\r\nmutilated bodies, while, from the deep gashes inflicted by these\r\ndreadful weapons, the field was literally soaked with gore. An\r\ninstance of the almost resistless power of the broadsword occurred\r\nwhen a Highland gentleman, who led a division, broke through Mackay’s\r\nregiment: a grenadier, having attempted to parry off with his hand a\r\nblow made at him by the gentleman alluded to, had his hand lopped off\r\nand his skull cut above an inch deep. He expired on the spot.[946]\r\n\r\nIt was a most fortunate circumstance that the Highlanders, having\r\nno revengeful feeling to gratify on the present occasion, were\r\neasily induced to listen to the dictates of humanity. After the\r\nfury of their onset was abated, they not only readily gave, but\r\neven offered quarter; and when the action was over, appear to have\r\ndisplayed an unwonted sympathy for the wounded. A Highland officer\r\nthus exultingly notices the conduct of his companions in arms.\r\n“Now, whatever notions or sentiments the low country people may\r\nentertain of our Highlanders, this day there were many proofs to a\r\ndiligent spectator, amidst all the bloodshed, (which at the first\r\nshock was unavoidable,) of their humanity and mercy; for I can,\r\nwith the strictest truth and sincerity, declare, that I often heard\r\nour people call out to the soldiers if they wanted quarter; and\r\nwe, the officers, exerted our utmost pains to protect the soldiers\r\nfrom their first fury, when either through their stubbornness or\r\nwant of language they did not cry for quarters, and I observed some\r\nof our private men run to Port Seton for ale and other liquors to\r\nsupport the wounded. And as one proof for all, to my own particular\r\nobservation, I saw a Highlander supporting a poor wounded soldier\r\nand carry him on his back into his house, and left him a sixpence at\r\nparting.”[947]\r\n\r\nIn their attentions to the wounded, the Highlanders had a good\r\nexample in Charles himself, who not only issued orders for taking\r\ncare of the wounded, but also remained on the field of battle till\r\nmid-day to see that his orders were fulfilled. Finding the few\r\nsurgeons he had carried along with him inadequate to meet the demands\r\nof the wounded, he despatched one of his officers to Edinburgh to\r\nbring out all the surgeons, who accordingly instantly repaired to\r\nthe field of battle. As the Highlanders felt an aversion to bury the\r\ndead, and as the country people could not be prevailed upon to assist\r\nin the care of the wounded,[948] Charles experienced great obstacles\r\nin carrying through his humane intentions. Writing to his father,\r\non the evening of the battle, he thus alludes to them: “Tis hard my\r\nvictory should put me under new difficulties which I did not feel\r\nbefore, and yet this is the case. I am charged both with the care of\r\nmy friends and enemies. Those who should bury the dead are run away,\r\nas if it were no business of theirs. My Highlanders think it beneath\r\nthem to do it, and the country people are fled away. However, I am\r\ndetermined to try if I can get people for money to undertake it, for\r\nI cannot bear the thought of suffering Englishmen to rot above the\r\nground. I am in great difficulties how I shall dispose of my wounded\r\nprisoners. If I make a hospital of the church, it will be lookt upon\r\nas a great profanation, and of having violated my manifesto, in which\r\nI promised to violate no man’s property. If the magistrates would\r\nact, they would help me out of this difficulty. Come what will, I am\r\nresolved not to let the poor wounded men lye in the streets, and if I\r\ncan do no better, I will make a hospital of the palace and leave it\r\nto them.”[949]\r\n\r\nWhen congratulating themselves on the victory they had obtained,\r\nthe Highlanders related to each other what they had done or seen.\r\nInstances were given of individual prowess which might appear\r\nincredible, were it not well-known that when fear seizes an army all\r\nconfidence in themselves or their numbers is completely destroyed.\r\nOn this occasion “the panic-terror of the English surpassed all\r\nimagination. They threw down their arms that they might run with\r\nmore speed, thus depriving themselves by their fears of the only\r\nmeans of arresting the vengeance of the Highlanders. Of so many, in\r\na condition from their numbers to preserve order in their retreat,\r\nnot one thought of defending himself. Terror had taken entire\r\npossession of their minds.”[950] Of the cases mentioned, one was\r\nthat of a young Highlander about fourteen years of age, scarcely\r\nformed, who was presented to the prince as a prodigy, having, it was\r\nsaid, killed fourteen of the enemy. Charles asking him if this was\r\ntrue, he replied, “I do not know if I killed them, but I brought\r\nfourteen soldiers to the ground with my sword.” Another instance was\r\nthat of a Highlander, who brought ten soldiers, whom he had made\r\nprisoners, to the prince, driving them before him like a flock of\r\nsheep. With unexampled rashness, he had pursued a party of Cope’s men\r\nto some distance from the field of battle, along a road between two\r\ninclosures, and striking down the hindermost man of the party with\r\na blow of his sword, called aloud at the same time, “Down with your\r\narms.” The soldiers, terror-struck, complied with the order without\r\nlooking behind them; and the Highlander, with a pistol in one hand\r\nand a sword in the other, made them do as he pleased. Yet, as the\r\nChevalier Johnstone observes, these were “the same English soldiers\r\nwho had distinguished themselves at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and who\r\nmight justly he ranked amongst the bravest troops of Europe.”[951]\r\n\r\nAfter doing every thing in his power for the relief of the wounded of\r\nboth armies, and giving directions for the disposal of his prisoners,\r\nCharles partook of a small repast upon the field of battle, and\r\nthereafter proceeded to Pinkie House, a seat of the Marquis of\r\nTweeddale, where he passed the night.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[879] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[880] Sixty of these Macdonalds had previously joined at Perth.\r\n\r\n[881] The Gartmore MS. quoted in the appendix to Burt’s Letters makes\r\nthe number only forty; but Home gives it as above.\r\n\r\n[882] Nimmo’s _History of Stirlingshire_, edited by the Rev.\r\nMacgregor Stirling, p. 564.\r\n\r\n[883] Dougal Graham’s _Metrical History_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[884] Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. p. 487.\r\n\r\n[885] Dougal Graham, in his _Metrical History_ of the insurrection,\r\nas quoted by Chambers, thus alludes to the conduct of the Highlanders\r\non the present occasion:--\r\n\r\n      “Here for a space they took a rest,\r\n      And had refreshment of the best\r\n      The country round them could afford,\r\n      Though many found but empty board,\r\n      As sheep and cattle were drove away,\r\n      Yet hungry men sought for their prey;\r\n      Took milk and butter, kirn and cheese,\r\n      On all kinds of eatables they seize;\r\n      And he who could not get a share,\r\n      Sprang to the hills like dogs for hare:\r\n      There shot the sheep and made them fall.\r\n      Whirled off the skin, and that was all;\r\n      Struck up fire and boiled the flesh,\r\n      With salt and pepper did not fash:[886]\r\n      This did enrage the Cameron’s chief,\r\n      To see his men so play the thief;\r\n      And finding one into the act,\r\n      He fired and shot him through the back;\r\n      Then to the rest himself addressed,\r\n      ‘This is your lot I do protest,--\r\n      Whoe’er amongst you wrongs a man;\r\n      Pay what you get, I tell you plain;\r\n      For yet we know not friend or foe,\r\n      Nor how all things may chance to go.’”\r\n\r\n[886] _Anglicé_,--trouble themselves.\r\n\r\n[887] Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. p. 445.--_Forbes Papers_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[888] Idem.\r\n\r\n[889] Home, p. 79.--Mr. Home says that several of these volunteers,\r\nof which he was one, were not inhabitants of the city, and were\r\nignorant of the municipal cabals,--that they had little deference for\r\nthe opinion either of Guest or Drummond; but being satisfied that\r\nthe walls were untenable, and dreading the consequences to the city\r\nif taken by storm, they considered the proposal of marching out with\r\nthe dragoons preferable to keeping within the walls, as, with their\r\nassistance, the dragoons might be able to break the force of the\r\nHighland army, and leave to the Highlanders, if victorious, a bloody\r\nand fatal victory.\r\n\r\n[890] Home, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[891] “A True Account of the Behaviour and Conduct of Archibald\r\nStewart, Esq., late Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in a letter to a\r\nfriend.

The author of the pamphlet on the conduct of\r\nProvost Stewart, already quoted, gives a somewhat different account\r\nof the flight of the dragoons, but with circumstances equally\r\nludicrous:--“Before the rebels,” he observes, “came within sight\r\nof our king’s forces, before they came within three miles distance\r\nof them, orders were issued to the dragoons to wheel, which they\r\nimmediately did with the greatest order and regularity imaginable.\r\nAs it is known that nothing is more beautiful than the evolutions\r\nand movements of cavalry, the spectators stood in expectation\r\nof what fine manœuvre they might terminate in: when new orders\r\nwere immediately issued to retreat, they immediately obeyed, and\r\nbegan to march in the usual pace of cavalry. Orders were repeated\r\nevery furlong to quicken their pace, and both precept and example\r\nconcurring, they quickened it so well, that, before they reached\r\nEdinburgh, they quickened to a very smart gallop. They passed in\r\ninexpressible hurry and confusion through the narrow lanes at\r\nBarefoot’s Parks, in the sight of all the north part of the town\r\n(Edinburgh,) to the infinite joy of the disaffected, and equal grief\r\nand consternation of all the other inhabitants. They rushed like a\r\ntorrent down to Leith, where they endeavoured to draw breath; but\r\nsome unlucky boy, (I suppose a Jacobite in his heart,) calling to\r\nthem that the Highlanders were approaching, they immediately took\r\nto their heels again, and galloped to Prestonpans, about six miles\r\nfarther. There, in a literal sense, _timor addidit alas_,--their\r\nfear added wings, I mean to the rebels. For otherwise they could\r\nnot possibly have imagined that these formidable enemies could be\r\nwithin several miles of them. But at Prestonpans the same alarm was\r\nrepeated. The Philistines be upon thee Sampson! They galloped to\r\nNorth Berwick, and being now about twenty miles to the other side\r\nof Edinburgh, they thought they might safely dismount from their\r\nhorses and look out for victuals. Accordingly, like the ancient\r\nGrecian heroes, each began to kill and dress his provisions: _egit\r\namor dapis atque pugnæ_; they were actuated by the desire of supper\r\nand of battle. The sheep and turkies of North Berwick paid for this\r\nwarlike disposition. But behold the uncertainty of human happiness!\r\nWhen the mutton was just ready to be put upon the table, they heard,\r\nor thought they heard, the same cry of the Highlanders. Their fear\r\nproved stronger than their hunger; they again got on horseback, but\r\nwere informed time enough of the falseness of the alarm, to prevent\r\nthe spoiling of their meal. By such rudiments as these, the dragoons\r\nwere so thoroughly initiated in the art of running, till at last they\r\nbecame so perfect at their lesson, that at the battle of Preston they\r\ncould practise it of themselves, though even there the same good\r\nexample was not wanting. I have seen an Italian opera called _Cesaro\r\nin Egitto_, or Cæsar in Egypt, where, in the first scene, Cæsar is\r\nintroduced in a great hurry, giving orders to his soldiers, _fugge,\r\nfugge, a’elo scampo_,--fly, fly, to your heels! This is a proof that\r\nthe commander at the Coltbridge is not the first hero that gave such\r\norders to his troops.”\r\n\r\n[911] Home, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[912] _Quarterly Review_, vol. xxxvi. p. 177.\r\n\r\n[913] Home, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[914] Account of the battle of Prestonpans, published in the\r\nCaledonian Mercury of 23d September, 1745.\r\n\r\n[915] Lord George Murray’s Narrative, _Jacobite Memoirs_, p.\r\n36.--Home, 109.\r\n\r\n[916] Home, 111.--Lord George Murray’s Narrative in _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[917] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[918] Idem, p. 38.--Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. p. 449. The accounts\r\ngiven by Home and the Chevalier Johnstone differ in some respects\r\nfrom that of Lord George Murray. Home says, that Mr. Robert Anderson\r\n(son of Anderson of Whitbrough in East Lothian, who had been engaged\r\nin the rebellion of 1715) had confirmed Ker of Gradon’s account\r\nof the ground after his survey, on being consulted by Lord George\r\nMurray,--that he was present at the council of war, but did not give\r\nany opinion; but that after Charles and his officers had separated,\r\nAnderson told Hepburn of Keith that he knew the ground perfectly,\r\nand was certain there was a better way to come at the king’s army\r\nthan that which the council had resolved to follow,--that he would\r\nundertake to show them a place where they might easily pass the\r\nmorass without being seen by the enemy, and without being exposed to\r\ntheir fire,--that Hepburn listened attentively to this information,\r\nand expressed his opinion of it in such terms that Anderson desired\r\nhe would carry him to Lord George Murray,--that Hepburn advised him\r\nto go himself to Lord George, who knew him, and would like better to\r\nreceive information from him alone than when introduced by another\r\nperson,--that when Anderson came to Lord George Murray he found\r\nhim asleep in a field of cut pease with several of the chiefs near\r\nhim,--that on awakening his Lordship, he repeated what he had said to\r\nMr. Hepburn, and offered to lead the men through the morass,--that\r\nLord George considering this information important, awoke Charles,\r\nwho was lying near him with a sheaf of pease for his pillow, and who,\r\npleased with Anderson’s information, ordered Lochiel and the other\r\nchiefs to be called, all of whom approved of the plan of attack. The\r\nChevalier Johnstone says that the officers of the army were perplexed\r\nhow to act, from the apparent impossibility of making a successful\r\nattack, but that Anderson came to the prince in the evening very _a\r\npropos_, and relieved them from their embarrassment by informing\r\nthem that there was a place in the marsh which could be crossed with\r\nsafety, and that upon examining it Anderson’s information was found\r\nto be correct. Lord George’s own account appears, however, to give\r\nthe real _res gestæ_. From it he appears to have communicated with\r\nAnderson and Hepburn _before_ the council of war had assembled. As\r\nhis Lordship says that “at midnight the principal officers were\r\ncalled again,” it is probable he alludes to the scene described\r\nby Home, when the prince himself and the chiefs were awakened by\r\nAnderson; but as Anderson was present in the council, and as Lord\r\nGeorge says, that, after this midnight call “all was ordered as was\r\nat first proposed,” it is very likely that Anderson was anxious to\r\nafford some additional information which he had formerly omitted to\r\ngive.\r\n\r\n[919] Home, p. 112.\r\n\r\n[920] A party of 200 Munroes followed Cope to Aberdeen, but refused\r\nto embark as harvest-time was at hand.\r\n\r\n[921] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 489.\r\n\r\n[922] Home, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[923] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 39.--Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. p.\r\n449.--Home, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[924] Idem.\r\n\r\n[925] _Memoirs_, 3d edition, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[926] Lockhart, vol. ii. p. 491.\r\n\r\n[927] Home puts the Macdonalds of Glencoe on the left of the second\r\nline; but the author of the Journal and Memoirs, (Lockhart _Papers_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 491,) an officer in the Highland army who was in the\r\nbattle, says that the Macdonalds of Glencoe were on the right of\r\nthe first line.

Mounted on his “old cropt galloway,” he posted himself\r\nby break of day about a musket shot in the rear of Hamilton’s\r\ndragoons, and had not taken his ground above three minutes when “the\r\nscuffle” began. He says it lasted about four minutes. After “all was\r\nin route,” Wightman remained in his station, “calm and fearless,”\r\naccording to his own account, till he saw all the dragoons out of the\r\nfield, and the foot surrounded on all sides. Ex-provost Drummond,\r\n“who (says Wightman) would needs fight among the dragoons,” was\r\nalso present, mounted on an old dragoon horse, which one Mathie\r\nhad purchased for £4, and had used as a cart horse. Not being able\r\nto reach Gardiner’s dragoons before the battle began, Drummond\r\njoined the squadrons under Hamilton; but “to his great luck,” and\r\nto the “great comfort,” of his friend Wightman, he was swept away\r\nout of the field by the cowardly dragoons, and accompanied Cope to\r\nBerwick.--_Culloden Papers_, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[936] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[937] _Memoirs_, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[938] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 36.--In the account of the battle\r\npublished by the Highland army, Captain Macgregor is stated to have\r\nbeen mortally wounded; but he lived several years thereafter, and\r\nretired to France in 1753. On his arrival he addressed the following\r\nletter to Edgar, secretary to the Chevalier de St. George. The\r\noriginal is thus quoted in Edgar’s hand-writing, “Rob Roy’s son, May\r\n22d, 1753:”--\r\n\r\n  BOULOGNE-SUR-MER,\r\n  _May 22d, 1753_.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--I use the freedom to beg of you to lay before his Majesty\r\n  my following unhappy case. What I am his Majesty will see by\r\n  the inclosed certificate, and whatever little my venity might\r\n  make me imagine I have to his Majesty’s protection, all I expect\r\n  or desire at present is, that assistance which is absolutely\r\n  necessary for the support of a man who has always shown the\r\n  strongest attachment to his Majesty’s person and cause. As long\r\n  as I could stay in Scotland I never thought to have added to his\r\n  Majesty a trouble or expense; but upon Dr. Cameron, Lochiel’s\r\n  brother, being taken up, a strict search was made over all, that\r\n  I had no way of avoiding being taken but comming to this country,\r\n  where I am in a situation so uneasy, that I am forced to applay\r\n  to the generosity of the best of kings. I flater myself that it\r\n  is in my power to acquaint his Majesty with something of the\r\n  greatest consequence to his cause and our country. But I think\r\n  it would be improper, unless I had the honor of being presented\r\n  to him. The general character you, Sir, have for being ready to\r\n  serve any body in distress, leaves me no room to doubt of your\r\n  interesting yourself in my behalf, which I dare say will be of\r\n  the greatest use to me, and I am sure will be conferring the\r\n  highest obligation upon, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n  JAS. DRUMMOND.\r\n\r\n  May I request the honor of an answer to the care of Lord\r\n  Strathallan.\r\n\r\nThe following is the certificate referred to:--\r\n\r\n  BOULOGNE-SUR-MER,\r\n  _May ye 22d, 1753_.\r\n\r\n  We the underwritten certify that it consists with our knowledge,\r\n  that James Drummond, son to the late Rob Roy, was imploy’d in the\r\n  Prince Regent’s affairs by James, Duke of Perth, before his Royal\r\n  Highness’s arrival in Scotland, and that afterwards he behaved\r\n  with great bravery in several battles, in which he received many\r\n  dangerous wounds.\r\n\r\n  STRATHALLAN.\r\n  CHARLES BOYD.\r\n  WILL^M. DRUMMOND.\r\n\r\nTo relieve his necessities, James ordered his banker at Paris to pay\r\nMacgregor 300 livres, in reference to which Lord Strathallan thus\r\nwrites to Edgar, from Boulogne-sur-Mer, on 6th Sept., 1753:--“I had\r\nthe honor of yours some time ago, and deferred writing you until I\r\nheard about the 300 livres for Mr. Drummond, (Macgregor); but I have\r\nnever heard any more of it. I immediately acquainted Mr. D. with the\r\ncontents of your letter. The attestation I signed was only as to his\r\ncourage and personal bravery, for as to any thing else, I would be\r\nsorry to answer for him, as he has but an indifferent character as to\r\nreal honesty.”--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[939] According to the Chevalier Johnstone, (_Memoirs_, p. 38,)\r\n1,300 of Cope’s men were killed; but Home states the number as not\r\nexceeding 200. He says, however, in a note, that some accounts of the\r\nbattle written by officers in the rebel army, make the number killed\r\nto have been 400 or 500. These last seem to be nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[940] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[941] Report of Cope’s examination. The story told by the Chevalier\r\nJohnstone, of Cope’s having effected his escape through the midst of\r\nthe Highlanders by mounting a white cockade, seems improbable, as\r\nCope does not appear to have been in a situation to have rendered\r\nsuch a step necessary. If any officer made his escape in the way\r\ndescribed, it is likely Colonel Lascelles was the man. He fell\r\ninto the hands of the Highlanders; but in the hurry they were in,\r\ncontrived to make his escape eastward, and arrived safe at Berwick.\r\nAmid the confusion which prevailed, he might easily have snatched a\r\ncockade from a dead or wounded Highlander, or procured one for a sum\r\nof money.\r\n\r\n[942] Doddridge’s _Life of Colonel Gardiner_.\r\n\r\n[943] Home, p. 121.\r\n\r\n[944] These were Captain Robert Stewart of Ardshiel’s battalion;\r\nCaptain Archibald Macdonald of Keppoch’s; Lieutenant Allan Cameron of\r\nLindevra; and Ensign James Cameron of Lochiel’s regiment.\r\n\r\n[945] Account published by the Highland army.--Kirkconnel MS.\r\n\r\n[946] _Caledonian Mercury_, 25th September 1745.\r\n\r\n[947] Lockhart _Papers_, vol. ii. p. 491.\r\n\r\n[948] Lord George Murray says, that when traversing the field\r\nof battle in the afternoon he observed that some of Cope’s men,\r\n“who were the worst wounded, had not been carried to houses to be\r\ndressed; and though there were several of the country people of that\r\nneighbourhood looking at them, I could not prevail with them to carry\r\nthem to houses, but got some of our people to do it.”--_Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[949] All the wounded privates of both armies were carried to the\r\ndifferent villages adjoining the field of battle. Those of Cope’s\r\nofficers who were dangerously wounded were lodged in Colonel\r\nGardiner’s house, where surgeons attended them. In the evening, the\r\nremainder, (who had given their parole,) accompanied by Lord George\r\nMurray, went to Musselburgh, where a house had been provided for\r\ntheir reception. Some of them walked, but others, who were unable\r\nto do so, had horses provided for them by his lordship. The house\r\ninto which they were put was newly finished, and had neither table,\r\nbed, chair, nor grate in it. Lord George caused some new thrashed\r\nstraw to be purchased for beds, and the officers on their arrival\r\npartook of a tolerable meal of cold provisions and some liquor, which\r\nhis lordship had carried along with him. When about to retire, the\r\nofficers entreated him not to leave them, as being without a guard,\r\nthey were afraid that some of the Highlanders, who were in liquor,\r\nmight come in and insult or plunder them. Lord George consented,\r\nand lay on a floor by them all night. Some of the officers, who\r\nwere valetudinary, slept that night in the house of the minister.\r\nNext day, after the departure of the prince for Edinburgh, the\r\nofficers had quarters provided for them in Pinkie-house. The other\r\nprisoners, privates, were quartered in Musselburgh and the gardens\r\nof Pinkie for two nights, and were afterwards removed, along with\r\nthe officers, to Edinburgh. The latter were confined for a few\r\ndays in Queensberry-house, when they were released on parole, and\r\nallowed to reside in the city, on condition that they should hold\r\nno communication with the castle. The privates were confined in the\r\nchurch and jail of the Canongate. Such of the wounded as could be\r\nremoved were put into the Royal Infirmary, where great care was taken\r\nof them. One of the officers having broke his parole by going into\r\nthe castle, the others were sent to Perth. The privates were removed\r\nto Logierait in Athole; and the wounded were dismissed as they\r\nrecovered, on taking an oath that they should not carry arms against\r\nthe prince before the 1st of January, 1747.--_Jacobite Memoirs_, p.\r\n42. _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 451. _Caledonian Mercury._\r\n\r\n[950] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[951] Idem, p. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1715.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  Charles returns to Holyrood--State of public feeling--Charles\r\n  resolves to remain at Edinburgh--Measures taken to increase\r\n  the army--Charles’s proceedings at Edinburgh--Blockade of the\r\n  Castle--Disorder in the city--Blockade removed--Exertions\r\n  of Lord President Forbes--Arrival of reinforcements at\r\n  Edinburgh--Charles issues a second manifesto--Arrival of supplies\r\n  from France and detachment from the north--Charles resolves\r\n  to invade England--Preparations--Deportment of Charles at\r\n  Holyrood--Declaration of the Highland army--Preparations of the\r\n  government--Riot at Perth on the King’s birth-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Sunday the 22d of September, the day after the\r\nbattle of Preston or Gladsmuir, as that affair is named by the\r\nHighlanders, Charles returned to Holyrood House, and was received by\r\na large concourse of the inhabitants, who had assembled round the\r\npalace, with the loudest acclamations. His return to the capital had\r\nbeen preceded by a large portion of his army, which, it is said, made\r\na considerable display as it marched up the long line of street,\r\nleading from the Watergate to the castle, amid the din of a number of\r\nbagpipes, and carrying along with it the enemy’s standards, and other\r\ntrophies of victory which it had taken upon the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonel Gardiner’s House, near Prestonpans.]\r\n\r\nApprehensive that the alarm, which Cope’s disaster would excite\r\nin the city, might obstruct the public worship on the Sunday,\r\nCharles had sent messengers on the evening of the battle, to the\r\ndwelling-houses of the different ministers, desiring them to continue\r\ntheir ministrations as usual; but although the church bells were\r\ntolled at the customary hour next morning, and the congregations\r\nassembled, one only of the city clergymen appeared, all the rest\r\nhaving retired to the country. The minister who thus distinguished\r\nhimself among his brethren on this occasion was a Mr. Hog, morning\r\nlecturer in the Tron church. The two clergymen of the neighbouring\r\nparish of St. Cuthbert’s, Messrs. Macvicar and Pitcairn, also\r\ncontinued to preach as usual, and many inhabitants of the city\r\nwent to hear them. No way dismayed by the presence of the Highland\r\narmy, they continued to pray as usual for King George; and Mr.\r\nMacvicar even went so far in his prayers, as to express a hope that\r\nGod would take Charles to himself, and that instead of an earthly\r\ncrown, he would “give him a crown of glory.” Charles is said to have\r\nlaughed heartily on being informed of Mr. Macvicar’s concern for his\r\nspiritual welfare. To induce the ministers to return to their duty,\r\nthe prince issued a proclamation on Monday, repeating the assurances\r\nhe had so often given them, that no interruption should be given to\r\npublic worship; but that, on the contrary, all concerned should be\r\nprotected. This intimation, however, had no effect upon the fugitive\r\nministers, who, to the great scandal of their flocks, deserted their\r\ncharges during the whole time the Highlanders occupied the city.\r\n\r\nIn the first moments of victory, Charles felt a gleam of joy, which\r\nfor a time excluded reflection; but when, after retiring from the\r\nbattle-field, he began to ruminate over the events of the day, and\r\nto consider that it was British blood that had been spilt, if we can\r\ntrust his own words, his spirit sunk within him. “If I had obtained\r\nthis victory,” says he to his father, in the letter already quoted,\r\n“over foreigners, my joy would have been complete; but as it is over\r\nEnglishmen, it has thrown a damp upon it that I little imagined. The\r\nmen I have defeated were your majesty’s enemies, it is true, but they\r\nmight have become your friends and dutiful subjects when they had got\r\ntheir eyes opened to see the true interest of their country, which\r\nyou mean to save, not to destroy.” For these reasons he was unwilling\r\nthat the victory should be celebrated by any public manifestation,\r\nand on being informed that many of the inhabitants of Edinburgh\r\nintended to testify their joy on the occasion by some public act,\r\nthe prince, in the same proclamation which enjoined the clergymen to\r\nreturn to their charges, prohibited “any outward demonstrations of\r\npublic joy.”\r\n\r\nThe news of the prince’s victory was received every where, by the\r\nJacobites, with the most unbounded delight. Unable any longer to\r\nconceal their real sentiments, they now publicly avowed them, and\r\nlike their predecessors, the cavaliers, indulged in deep potations\r\nto the health of “the king” and the prince. But this enthusiasm was\r\nnot confined to the Jacobites alone. Many persons whose political\r\ncreed was formerly doubtful, now declared unequivocally in favour\r\nof the cause of the prince; whilst others, whose sentiments were\r\nformerly in favour of the government, openly declared themselves\r\nconverts to an order of things which they now considered inevitable.\r\nIn short, throughout the whole of Scotland the tide of public opinion\r\nwas completely changed in favour of the Stuarts. The fair sex,\r\nespecially, displayed an ardent attachment to the person and cause of\r\nthe prince, and contributed not a little to bring about the change\r\nin public feeling alluded to. Duncan Forbes has well described this\r\nstrong revolution in public feeling. “All Jacobites, how prudent\r\nsoever, became mad; all doubtful people became Jacobites; and all\r\nbankrupts became heroes, and talked of nothing but hereditary rights\r\nand victory; and what was more grievous to men of gallantry, and if\r\nyou will believe me, much more mischievous to the public, all the\r\nfine ladies, if you will except one or two, became passionately fond\r\nof the young Adventurer, and used all their arts and industry for him\r\nin the most intemperate manner.”[952]\r\n\r\nIn England the news of the prince’s victory created a panic,\r\ncausing a run upon the bank, which would have been fatal to that\r\nestablishment, had not the principal merchants entered into an\r\nassociation to support public credit by receiving the notes of\r\nthe bank in payment.[953] Scotchmen were everywhere looked upon\r\nwith distrust by their southern neighbours, and the most severe\r\nreflections were indulged in against the Scottish nation. Sir Andrew\r\nMitchell, writing to President Forbes, notices with deep regret this\r\nfeeling against his countrymen: “The ruin of my country, and the\r\ndisgrace and shame to which it is, and will continue to be, exposed,\r\nhave affected me to that degree, that I am hardly master of myself.\r\nAlready every man of our country is looked on as a traitor, as one\r\nsecretly inclined to the Pretender, and waiting but an opportunity\r\nto declare. The guilty and the innocent are confounded together,\r\nand the crimes of a few imputed to the whole nation.”[954] Again,\r\n“I need not describe to you the effects the surrender of Edinburgh,\r\nand the progress the rebels made, had upon this country. I wish I\r\ncould say that they were confined to the lower sort of people; but\r\nI must fairly own that their betters were as much touched as they.\r\nThe reflections were national; and it was too publicly said that\r\nall Scotland were Jacobites; the numbers of the rebels and their\r\nadherents were magnified for this purpose; and he that in the least\r\ndiminished them was called a _secret Jacobite_.”[955]\r\n\r\nElated by the news of the victory of Preston, a party of armed\r\nHighlanders entered Aberdeen on the 25th of September, seized the\r\nprovost, and carrying him to the cross, held their drawn swords over\r\nhis head, till they proclaimed the Chevalier de St. George. They then\r\nrequested him to drink the health of “the king,” but having refused\r\nto do so, they threw a glass of wine into his breast. Not wishing to\r\nhave his loyalty put a second time to such a severe test, the provost\r\nleft the city, not thinking himself safe, as he observes, “in the way\r\nof those who had used him in so unreasonable and odd a manner.”[956]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling, and a\r\nfew insignificant forts, the whole of Scotland may be said to have\r\nbeen now in possession of the victor. Having no longer an enemy\r\nto combat in North Britain, Charles turned his eyes to England;\r\nbut against the design which he appears to have contemplated,\r\nof an immediate march into that kingdom, several very serious\r\nobjections occurred. If the prince could have calculated on a\r\ngeneral rising in England in his favour, his advance into that\r\nkingdom with a victorious army, before the government recovered\r\nfrom the consternation into which it had been thrown by the recent\r\nvictory, would have been a wise course of policy; but it would have\r\nbeen extremely rash, without an absolute assurance of extensive\r\nsupport from the friends of the cause in England, to have entered\r\nthat kingdom with the small army which fought at Gladsmuir, and\r\nwhich, instead of increasing, was daily diminishing, by the return\r\nof some of the Highlanders to their homes, according to custom,\r\nwith the spoils they had collected. There were indeed, among the\r\nmore enthusiastic of the prince’s advisers, some who advocated an\r\nimmediate incursion into England; but by far the greater part thought\r\nthe army too small for such an undertaking. These urged that although\r\nthe success which had attended their arms would certainly engage a\r\nnumber of friends, who either had not hitherto had an opportunity\r\nof joining, or had delayed doing so, because they saw little or no\r\nappearance of success, yet it was prudent to wait for such aid,--that\r\nFrench succours might now be depended upon, since the prince had\r\ngiven convincing proofs of his having a party in Scotland,--that, at\r\nany rate, it was better to remain some little time at Edinburgh,\r\ntill they saw what prospects there were of success, and that in\r\nthe mean time the army would be getting stronger by reinforcements\r\nwhich were expected from the north, and would be better modelled and\r\naccoutred. The latter opinion prevailed, and Charles resolved to make\r\nsome stay in Edinburgh.[957]\r\n\r\nAlluding to this resolution, Mr. Maxwell observes, “Those who judge\r\nof things only by the event, will condemn this measure, and decide\r\npositively that if the prince had marched on from the field of\r\nbattle, he would have carried all before him. As the prince’s affairs\r\nwere ruined in the end, it is natural to wish he had done any thing\r\nelse than what he did. Things could hardly have turned out worse, and\r\nthere was a possibility of succeeding. But to judge fairly of the\r\nmatter, we must have no regard to what happened, but consider what\r\nwas the most likely to happen. The prince had but 3,000 men at the\r\nbattle, where he had 100 at least killed and wounded. He might reckon\r\nupon losing some hundreds more, who would go home with the booty they\r\nhad got, so that he could not reckon upon more than 2,500 men to\r\nfollow him into England, where he had no intelligence, nor hopes of\r\nbeing joined, nor resource in case of a misfortune. But what would\r\nthe world have said of such an attempt had it miscarried!”[958]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Chevalier Johnstone,[959] the prince was advised\r\nby his friends, that as the whole of the towns of Scotland had been\r\nobliged to recognise him as regent of the kingdom, in the absence of\r\nhis father, his chief object should be to endeavour by every possible\r\nmeans to secure himself in the government of Scotland; and to defend\r\nhimself against the English armies, which would be sent against him,\r\nwithout attempting for the present to extend his views to England.\r\nThere were others who strongly advised Charles to annul the union\r\nbetween Scotland and England, as an act made during the usurpation\r\nof Queen Anne, by a cabal of a few Scotch peers, and to summon a\r\nScottish parliament, to meet at Edinburgh, to impose taxes in a legal\r\nmanner, and obtain supplies for his army. This party assured the\r\nprince that these steps would give great pleasure to all Scotland,\r\nand that the tendency of them would be to renew the ancient discord\r\nbetween the two countries, and that the war would thereby be made\r\nnational: they informed him, that, so far from being prepared to run\r\nan immense risk, for the sake of acquiring England, they wished for\r\nnothing more than to see him seated on the throne of Scotland. As the\r\nchief object of his ambition, however, was to obtain the crown of\r\nEngland, he rejected the proposal made to him, to confine his views\r\nto Scotland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was determined to remain in Scotland till the army\r\nshould be reinforced, every measure was adopted that could tend to\r\nincrease it. Letters were despatched to the Highlands, and other\r\nparts of Scotland, containing the news of the victory, and urging\r\nimmediate aid; and messengers were sent to France to represent the\r\nstate of the prince’s affairs, and to solicit succours from that\r\ncourt. Officers were appointed to beat up for recruits, and every\r\ninducement was held out to the prisoners taken at Preston to join\r\nthe insurgents. Many of these, accordingly, enlisted in the prince’s\r\narmy, and were of considerable service in drilling recruits, but\r\nbefore the Highland army left Edinburgh, almost the whole of them\r\nhad deserted, and joined their former companions at Berwick.[960]\r\nThe principal person selected by Charles to go to the Highlands, on\r\nthe present occasion, was Mr. Alexander Macleod, a gentleman of the\r\nScottish bar, who carried along with him a paper of instructions,\r\ndated the 24th of September, and signed by secretary Murray.[961]\r\nBy these instructions, Macleod was directed forthwith to proceed to\r\nthe Isle of Skye, to assure Sir Alexander Macdonald, and the laird\r\nof Macleod, and other gentlemen of their names, that the prince did\r\nnot impute their not having hitherto joined him, to any failure of\r\nloyalty or zeal on their part, for his father’s cause; but to the\r\nprivate manner in which he had arrived in Scotland, which was from a\r\ndesire to restore his royal father without foreign assistance--that\r\nhe was ready still to receive them with the same affection he would\r\nhave welcomed them, had they joined him on his landing,--and that\r\nas they well knew the dispositions of the Highlanders, and their\r\ninclination to return home after a battle, they would be sensible\r\nhow necessary it was to recruit the army with a strong body of men\r\nfrom their country. After giving them these assurances, Macleod was\r\ndirected to require of these chiefs to repair with all possible speed\r\nwith their men to Edinburgh, where they should be furnished with\r\narms. In case they were found refractory, Macleod was directed to\r\nuse all proper means with the gentlemen of their different families,\r\nto bring them to the field with as many followers as possible,--that\r\nto encourage them to take up arms, he was to acquaint them that the\r\nprince had received undoubted assurances of support from France and\r\nSpain,--that the Earl Marischal was expected to land in Scotland\r\nwith a body of troops,--that the Duke of Ormond was also expected\r\nin England, with the Irish brigade, and a large quantity of arms,\r\nammunition, and money,--and that before passing the Forth, he had\r\nreceived letters from the Spanish ministry, and the Duke of Bouillon,\r\ncontaining positive assurances of aid. In conclusion, Macleod was\r\nordered to assure these gentlemen that the encouragement and favour\r\nwhich would be shown them, if they joined the prince’s standard,\r\nwould be in proportion to their loyalty and the backwardness of their\r\nchiefs. He was likewise directed to send for the chief of Mackinnon,\r\nand to tell him that the prince was much surprised that one who had\r\ngiven such solemn assurances, as Mackinnon had done, to join him,\r\nwith all the men he could collect, should have failed in his promise.\r\nAs Macleod of Swordland, in Glenelg, who had visited the prince in\r\nGlenfinnan, had there engaged to seize the fort of Bernera, and to\r\njoin Charles with a hundred men, whether his chief joined or not,\r\nthe messenger was instructed to ask him why he had not fulfilled his\r\nengagement. The result of this mission will be subsequently noticed.\r\n\r\nSeated in the palace of his ancestors, Charles, as Prince Regent,\r\ncontinued to discharge the functions of royalty, by exercising\r\nevery act of sovereignty, with this difference only between him and\r\nhis rival in St. James’s, that while King George could only raise\r\ntroops and levy money by act of parliament, Charles, by his own\r\nauthority, not only ordered regiments to be raised for his service,\r\nand troops of horse-guards to be levied for the defence of his\r\nperson, but also imposed taxes at pleasure. To give eclat to his\r\nproceedings, and to impress upon the minds of the people, by external\r\nacts, the appearances of royalty, he held a levee every morning in\r\nHolyrood-house, and appointed a council which met every morning at\r\nten o’clock, after the levee was over. This council comprised the\r\nDuke of Perth and Lord George Murray, the lieutenant-generals of the\r\narmy, O’Sullivan, the quarter-master-general, Lord Pitsligo, Lord\r\nElcho, Sir Thomas Sheridan, Secretary Murray, and all the Highland\r\nchiefs.[962]\r\n\r\nAs nothing could injure his cause more in the eyes of the people\r\nthan acts of oppression on the part of his troops, one of Charles’s\r\nfirst acts after his return to Edinburgh, was to issue an edict\r\ngranting protection to the inhabitants of the city and the vicinity,\r\nin their persons and properties; but farmers, living within five\r\nmiles of Edinburgh, were required, before being entitled to the\r\nprotection, to appear at the secretary’s office, in Holyrood-house,\r\nand grant bond that they should be ready, on twelve hours’ notice,\r\nto furnish the prince with horses for carrying the baggage of his\r\narmy to Berwick-upon-Tweed, or a similar distance, according to their\r\nplowgates. By another proclamation put forth the same day, viz. the\r\n23d of September, he denounced death or such other punishment as a\r\ncourt-martial should order to be inflicted on any soldier or person\r\nconnected with his army, who should be guilty of forcibly taking\r\nfrom “the good people of Edinburgh,” or of the country, any of their\r\ngoods without a fair equivalent to the satisfaction of the parties.\r\nThese orders were in general scrupulously attended to, though, in\r\nsome instances, irregularities were committed, under the pretence\r\nof searching for arms. The greater part, however, were the acts of\r\npersons who, though they wore the white cockade, did not belong to\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nBesides the clergymen of the city, a considerable number of the\r\nvolunteers had deserted their homes in dread of punishment for\r\nhaving taken up arms. To induce these, as well as the ministers of\r\nthe city, to return, Charles issued a proclamation on the 24th of\r\nSeptember, granting a full pardon to all or such of them, as should,\r\nwithin twenty days after the publication thereof, present themselves\r\nto Secretary Murray, or to any other member of the council, at\r\nHolyrood-house, or at such other place as the prince might be at the\r\ntime. A few volunteers only took advantage of this offer.\r\n\r\nWhen the Highland army first approached the city, the directors\r\nof the two banks then existing, had removed all their money and\r\nnotes to the castle, under the apprehension that the prince would\r\nappropriate them to his own use. As great inconvenience was felt in\r\nthe city by the removal of the banks, Charles issued a proclamation\r\non the 25th of September, in which, after disclaiming any intention\r\nto seize the funds belonging to the banks, he invited them to resume\r\ntheir business in the city, pledging himself to protect them. He\r\ndeclared that the money lodged in the banks should be free from any\r\nexactions on his part; and that he himself would contribute to the\r\nre-establishment of public credit, by receiving and issuing the\r\nnotes of the banks in payment. The banks, however, declined to avail\r\nthemselves of the prince’s offer; but when applied to for money in\r\nexchange for a large quantity of their notes in possession of the\r\nHighland army, the directors answered the demand.\r\n\r\nAs the wants of his army were many, the next object of the prince’s\r\nsolicitude was to provide against them. Anxious as he was to\r\nconciliate all classes of the people, he had no alternative on\r\nthe present occasion, but to assess the burghs of Scotland, in\r\nsums proportionate to the duties of excise drawn from them. He\r\naccordingly sent letters, dated the 30th of September, to all the\r\nchief magistrates of the burghs, ordering them, under pain of being\r\nconsidered rebel, to repair, upon receipt, to Holyrood-house, to get\r\nthe contributions to be paid by their respective burghs ascertained,\r\nand for payment of which, he promised to assign the duties of excise.\r\nFor immediate use, he compelled the city of Edinburgh, on pain of\r\nmilitary execution, to furnish his army with 1,000 tents, 2,000\r\ntargets, 6,000 pair of shoes, and other articles, to the value of\r\nupwards of £15,000, to liquidate which, a tax of 2s. 6d. per pound\r\nwas laid on the city, and in the Canongate and Leith. From the city\r\nof Glasgow he demanded £15,000, a sum which was compromised by a\r\nprompt payment of £5,500. The prince, at the same time, despatched\r\nletters to the collectors of the land-tax, the collectors and\r\ncomptrollers of the customs and excise, and to the factors upon the\r\nestates forfeited in the former insurrection, requiring all of them,\r\nupon receipt, to repair to Holyrood-house with their books, and to\r\npay such balances as might appear upon examination to be in their\r\nhands,--the first and last classes, under the pain of rebellion and\r\nmilitary execution, and the second class, besides the last-mentioned\r\npenalty, under the pain of high-treason. Charles, at the same time,\r\nseized all the smuggled goods in the custom-houses of Leith and\r\nother sea-ports, which being sold, yielded him £7,000. Besides the\r\nexactions from public bodies, he compelled several of the nobility\r\nand gentry in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh to supply him with\r\nconsiderable quantities of hay and oats. Parties of Highlanders were\r\nsent to the seats of the Dukes of Hamilton and Douglas, and the Earl\r\nof Hoptoun, to carry off arms and horses. From the last mentioned\r\nnoblemen they took nearly 100 horses.[963]\r\n\r\nFor some days after the Highlanders resumed possession of Edinburgh,\r\na sort of tacit understanding existed between the garrison and\r\nthem, under which the communication between the castle and the city\r\ncontinued open. A guard of Highlanders was posted at the Weigh-house,\r\nan old square building, which stood at the head of West Bow, at the\r\ndistance of a few hundred yards from the fortress. This guard allowed\r\nprovisions of every description to pass, particularly for the use\r\nof the officers; and matters might have remained for some time in\r\nthis quiescent state, to the great comfort of the inhabitants, had\r\nnot the garrison one night, most unaccountably fired off some cannon\r\nand small arms in the direction of the West Port. In consequence,\r\nit is believed, of this breach of the implied armistice, orders\r\nwere given to the guards, on the 29th of September, to block up all\r\nthe avenues leading to the castle, and allow no person to pass.\r\nOn being made acquainted with this order, General Guest sent a\r\nletter, in the evening, addressed to the Lord Provost, intimating,\r\nthat unless the communication between the castle and the city was\r\nrenewed, and the blockade removed, he would be obliged to dislodge\r\nthe Highland guards with his cannon, and bombard the city. Nothing\r\ncould be more unreasonable and absurd than this threat. Though\r\nwilling, the citizens had it not in their power, either to keep up\r\nthe communication with the castle, or to take off the blockade, and\r\nthough they were as unable to remove the Highlanders from the city\r\n“as to remove the city itself out of its seat,”[964] or prevent them\r\nfrom acting as they pleased, yet the citizens would be the only\r\nsufferers in the event of a bombardment; for the Highlanders, if the\r\ncity were destroyed, would only be obliged to change their quarters,\r\nand neither the destruction of the one, nor the removal of the other,\r\ncould be of any service to the castle. These views were represented\r\nto the governor by a deputation from the city; but Guest remained\r\ninflexible, and pleaded in his justification a peremptory order,\r\nwhich he said he had received from the king himself, and which left\r\nhim no discretion. At the earnest solicitation of the inhabitants,\r\nGuest was prevailed upon to grant a respite for one night. Next\r\nmorning, six deputies waited on the prince, at the palace, with\r\nGeneral Guest’s letter, which was in reality intended for him. After\r\nperusing the letter, Charles returned an answer immediately to the\r\ndeputies in writing, in which he expressed surprise at the barbarity\r\nof the orders from the castle, at a time when it was admitted, that\r\nthe garrison had six weeks provisions on hand,--that, in pleading,\r\nas Guest had done, the directions of “the Elector of Hanover,” as\r\nan excuse, it was evident, that the Elector did not consider the\r\ninhabitants of Edinburgh as his subjects, otherwise he would not\r\nhave made a demand upon them which they could not fulfil,--and that,\r\nshould he, the prince, out of compassion to the citizens, comply with\r\nthe extravagant demand now made, he might as well quit the city at\r\nonce, and abandon all the advantages he had obtained,--that, if any\r\nmischief should befall the city, he would take particular care to\r\nindemnify the inhabitants for their loss,--and that, in the meantime,\r\nif forced by the threatened barbarity, he would make reprisals upon\r\nthe estates of the officers in the castle, and also upon all who were\r\n“known to be open abettors of the German government.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was laid before a meeting of the inhabitants, who sent\r\ndeputies with it to General Guest. After some altercation, he agreed\r\nto suspend hostilities till the return of an express from London,\r\non condition that the Highland army should, in the mean time, make\r\nno attempt upon the castle. This condition was, however, infringed\r\nby the Highlanders, who, on the following day, discharged some\r\nmusket shots with the intention, it is supposed, of frightening\r\nsome persons who were carrying up provisions to the castle. General\r\nGuest, considering that he was no longer restrained from executing\r\nhis threat, immediately opened a fire upon the guard stationed at\r\nthe Weigh-house, by which some houses were damaged and two persons\r\nwounded. Charles retaliated by issuing a proclamation next day, in\r\nwhich he prohibited all correspondence with the castle, under pain of\r\ndeath. This proclamation was followed by an order to strengthen the\r\nblockade, by posting additional guards at several places about the\r\ncastle. To revenge this step the garrison fired at every Highlander\r\nthey could discover from the battlements, and, by this reckless\r\nproceeding, killed and wounded several of the inhabitants. A daring\r\nexploit was performed at the same time by a soldier, who slipped down\r\nfrom the castle, set fire to a house in Livingston’s yards, where a\r\nguard was posted, and after shooting one of the guards dead upon the\r\nspot, returned safe to the fortress. Shortly after this occurrence\r\na party sallied out from the castle, killed some of the guards\r\nstationed at the same place, took an officer and a few prisoners, and\r\nput the rest to flight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General Guest sent a message to the city, intimating\r\nthat he meant to demolish the houses where the guards were posted,\r\nbut that care would be taken to do as little damage as possible to\r\nthe city. Accordingly, on the 4th of October, about two o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, a cannonade was opened from the half-moon battery,\r\nnear the Castle-gate, which was kept up till the evening. When it\r\ngrew dark the garrison made a sally, and set fire to a foundry and\r\na house on the Castle-hill which had been deserted. They then dug\r\na trench fourteen feet broad, and sixteen feet deep, across the\r\nCastle-hill, about half-way between the gate and the houses on the\r\nCastle-hill, and along the parapet made by the earth taken from\r\nthe trench on the side next the castle, they posted 200 men, who\r\ndischarged some cartridge shot down the street, killing and wounding\r\nsome of the inhabitants. The bombardment was resumed next day, with\r\nmore disastrous effect. No person could with safety appear on the\r\nHigh-street, as the shots from the Castle-hill penetrated as far down\r\nas the head of the old Flesh-market close, and shattered several\r\nhouses. At first, some of the better informed among the citizens\r\nwere disposed to regard the threat of bombardment as a mere device\r\nto induce the prince to discontinue the blockade, as they could not\r\nbring themselves to believe that the government could have been\r\nguilty of issuing the barbarous order alluded to by the governor\r\nof the castle; but the inhabitants in general entertained more\r\ncorrect views, and before the cannonade commenced, the streets were\r\ncrowded with women and children running towards the gates, in great\r\nconfusion, while many of the citizens were to be seen carrying their\r\nmost valuable effects out of the city. During the two days that the\r\ncannonade lasted, viz., the 4th and 5th of October, the utmost dismay\r\nprevailed among the inhabitants, and multitudes of them left the\r\ncity, without knowing whither to flee or where to look for shelter.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to this disastrous state of affairs Charles issued\r\na proclamation on the evening of the 5th of October, removing the\r\nblockade. In this document he stated that it was with the greatest\r\nregret that he was hourly informed of the many murders which were\r\ncommitted upon the innocent inhabitants of the city, by the inhuman\r\ncommanders and garrison of the castle, a practice contrary, he\r\nobserved, to all the laws of war, to the truce granted to the\r\ncity, and even exceeding the orders which the government, it was\r\nalleged, had given upon the occasion,--that he might have, as he\r\nhad threatened, justly chastised those who had been instrumental in\r\nthe ruin of the capital, by reprisals upon the estates and fortunes\r\nof the supporters of the government; but as he thought it noways\r\nderogatory to the glory of a prince, to suspend punishment, or alter\r\na resolution, if, by such a course, he could save the lives of\r\ninnocent men, he had allowed his humanity to yield to the barbarity\r\nof the common enemy. This proclamation was followed by a cessation of\r\nthe cannonade; but the garrison still continued to fire occasionally\r\nat the Highlanders whenever they made their appearance in the\r\nneighbourhood of the castle.\r\n\r\nThe object of Guest, according to Mr. Home, in thus annoying the\r\ntown, and provoking the Highlanders, was not to secure a supply of\r\nprovisions, of which he had already an abundance, but to prevent\r\nthem from marching into England, by keeping them occupied in the\r\nsiege of the castle. To deceive Charles, he wrote in the beginning\r\nof the week following the battle of Preston, several letters to the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, one of the secretaries of state, acquainting him\r\nthat there was but a very small stock of provisions in the castle of\r\nEdinburgh,--that he would be obliged to surrender, if not immediately\r\nrelieved, and recommending that any troops sent to his relief,\r\nshould be forwarded by sea, to Berwick or Newcastle, for the sake\r\nof despatch. These letters, which were intended for the perusal of\r\nCharles, were sent so that they might fall into his hands; but lest\r\nany of them might find their way to London, Guest sent a letter to\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, by a sure conveyance, giving him an account of\r\nthe real state of the garrison, and informing him of the deception he\r\nwas endeavouring to practise upon the Highlanders.[965]\r\n\r\nWhilst the adherents of Charles in the Highlands and the northern\r\nLowlands were exerting all their energies to collect reinforcements,\r\nLord-president Forbes was using all his influence to prevent the\r\nchiefs of doubtful loyalty from committing themselves with the\r\ngovernment. To induce them to arm in its support after the success\r\nwhich had attended the prince’s arms, was what he could scarcely\r\nhave expected; but by persuasion, and by pointing out in forcible\r\nterms the ruin which would befall them and their families, should\r\nthe prince fail in his enterprise, he succeeded in making them at\r\nfirst to waver, and finally to abandon any design they may have\r\nentertained, of joining the prince. Among others who appear to\r\nhave vacillated between two opinions, and in their perplexity to\r\nhave alternately changed their minds, was Macleod of Macleod. This\r\nchief, influenced probably by the solicitations of his clansman, who\r\nhad been sent to him on the mission before alluded to, attended a\r\nmeeting of gentlemen of the name of Fraser, convened by Lord Lovat\r\nat Beaufort, or Castle Downie, as that seat of the chief of the\r\nFrasers was sometimes called, on Friday the 4th of October, and\r\nwas despatched the following day to Skye, having engaged to join\r\nthe Frasers with his men at Corriearrick on the 15th;[966] but on\r\nadvising with his friend Sir Alexander Macdonald, he resolved to stay\r\nat home.[967]\r\n\r\nIn neutralizing the efforts of the disaffected clans, and dissuading\r\nothers of doubtful loyalty from joining the ranks of the insurgents,\r\nPresident Forbes had difficulties to contend with, which few men\r\ncould have overcome, but which he finally surmounted by that\r\nfirmness, zeal, and indomitable perseverance, which distinguished\r\nhim among all his political contemporaries. At its commencement,\r\nForbes treated the insurrection very lightly. Before his departure\r\nfor the north, he considered the prospect of affairs very flattering,\r\nand that the object of his journey had no appearance of difficulty;\r\nbut the alteration in public feeling, consequent on the battle of\r\nPreston, changed the scene. Instead of finding the ready support he\r\nanticipated from the professed adherents of the government, he saw\r\nhimself, to use his own words, “almost alone, without troops, without\r\narms, without money or credit; provided with no means to prevent\r\nextreme folly, except pen and ink, a tongue and some reputation; and,\r\nif you will except Macleod, whom I sent for from the Isle of Skye,\r\nsupported by nobody of common sense or courage.”[968] The successes\r\nof the insurgents had, he observes, “blown up the spirit of mutiny\r\nto such a pitch, that nothing was heard of but caballing, and\r\ngathering together of men in the neighbourhood: every petty head of\r\na tribe, who was in any degree tinged with Jacobitism, or desperate\r\nin his circumstances, assembled his kindred, and made use of the\r\nmost mutinous, to drag the most peaceable out of their beds, and to\r\nforce others to list by threatening destruction to their cattle and\r\nother effects; whilst we were unable to give them any assistance or\r\nprotection.”[969] Exasperated at the president for the exertions he\r\nmade to obstruct the designs of the disaffected, a plan was formed\r\nfor seizing him by some of the Frasers, a party of whom, amounting\r\nto about 200 men, accordingly made an attack upon the house of\r\nCulloden during the night between the 15th and 16th of October;\r\nbut the president being upon his guard, they were repulsed.[970]\r\nThe apprehension of such an important personage would have been of\r\ngreater service to the Jacobite cause than the gaining of a battle.\r\n\r\nConfiding in the loyalty and discretion of President Forbes, the\r\nministry had, at the suggestion of the Earl of Stair, sent down to\r\nthe president, early in September, twenty commissions, for raising\r\nas many independent companies in the Highlands for the service of\r\nthe government. The names of the officers were left blank in the\r\ncommissions, that the president might distribute them among such of\r\nthe well-affected clans as he might think proper. The plan which his\r\nlordship laid down for himself, in disposing of these commissions,\r\nwas to distribute them among the clans who adhered to the government\r\nin the former insurrection, without neglecting such other clans, who,\r\nthough then opposed to the government, had, on the present occasion,\r\nshown an unwillingness to join the Jacobite standard. To raise the\r\ncompanies, which were fixed at 100 men each, as quickly as possible,\r\nthe president resolved to leave the nomination of the officers to\r\nthe chiefs of the clans, out of whom they were to be raised.[971]\r\nHe accordingly despatched letters to the Earls of Sutherland and\r\nCromarty, Lords Reay and Fortrose, Sir Alexander Macdonald, the\r\nlairds of Macleod and Grant, and other chiefs, requesting each of\r\nthem to raise a company out of their respective clans, most of whom\r\naccordingly proceeded to enrol their men; but from the want of\r\nmoney and arms, only two companies were completed before the end\r\nof October, and several months expired before the whole were fully\r\nformed and drawn together.[972]\r\n\r\nIf the majority of the people of Scotland had been favourably\r\ndisposed to the cause of the Stuarts, they had now an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying their attachment to the representative of their ancient\r\nmonarchs, by declaring for the prince; but Charles soon found that,\r\nwith the exception of the Highlands, and a few districts north of\r\nthe Tay, where catholicity and non-juring episcopacy still retained\r\na footing, the rest of Scotland was not disposed to join a contest\r\nfor legitimacy, which they might imagine would not, if successful,\r\nstrengthen the liberties of the nation, and might possibly impair\r\nthem. The regular line of hereditary succession had been departed\r\nfrom, and it did not seem wise after a trial of fifty-seven years,\r\nduring which period the political frame and texture of society had\r\nundergone a complete revolution, to place the succession on its\r\noriginal footing, by restoring the son of James II. The Jacobites,\r\nhowever, imbued with ideas of indefeasible hereditary right, were\r\ndeaf to every argument founded on expediency or the will of the\r\nnation, and contended that every departure from the direct line of\r\nsuccession was a usurpation, and contrary to the divine law. No\r\nsovereign was, therefore, held by them as legitimate, while there\r\nexisted a nearer heir to the crown in the direct line of succession;\r\nbut they did not reflect that, upon this principle, there was\r\nscarcely a legitimate sovereign in Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the Lowland Jacobites who displayed the greatest zeal on the\r\npresent occasion, was Lord Ogilvy, eldest son of the Earl of Airly,\r\nwho joined the prince at Edinburgh on the 3d of October with a\r\nregiment of 600 men, chiefly from the county of Forfar, where his\r\nfather’s estates were situated. Most of the officers of the regiment\r\nwere either of the Airly family, or bore the name of Ogilvy. Lord\r\nOgilvy was followed by old Gordon of Glenbucket, an equally zealous\r\nsupporter of the Stuarts, who arrived at Edinburgh next day with a\r\nbody of 400 men, which he had collected in Strathdon, Strathaven,\r\nGlenlivet, and Auchindoun. Glenbucket had been a major-general in\r\nMar’s army, in 1715; but he now contented himself with the colonelcy\r\nof the regiment he had just raised, of which he made his eldest\r\nson lieutenant-colonel, and his younger sons captains, while the\r\nother commissions were held by his relations or personal friends.\r\nOn the 9th of October, Lord Pitsligo also joined the prince. He was\r\naccompanied by a considerable number of gentlemen from the counties\r\nof Aberdeen and Banff, with their servants, all well armed and\r\nmounted. These formed an excellent corps of cavalry. He also brought\r\nwith him a small body of infantry. Lord Pitsligo, though possessed\r\nof a moderate fortune, had great influence with the gentlemen of the\r\ncounties above named, by whom he was beloved and greatly esteemed,\r\nand having great reliance on his judgment and discretion, they did\r\nnot hesitate, when he declared himself in favour of the prince, to\r\nput themselves under his command.\r\n\r\nHaving been informed that there were many persons, who, from\r\ninfirmity and other causes, were unable to join him, but were\r\ndisposed to assist him with money, horses, and arms, the Chevalier\r\nissued a proclamation on the 8th of October, calling upon all such\r\npersons to send such supplies to his secretary; and as an order\r\nhad been issued, summoning the parliament to meet on the 17th, he,\r\nby another proclamation dated the 9th, prohibited all peers and\r\ncommoners from paying obedience to any order or resolution that might\r\nbe published in the name of either house, in case they should meet.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October, Charles issued a second rather spirited\r\nmanifesto, justifying the step he had taken, proclaiming his father’s\r\ngracious intention to redress every grievance, including the repeal\r\nof the union, endeavouring to show that the government of the Elector\r\nof Hanover was a grievous tyranny supported by foreign mercenaries.\r\nIt concluded thus:--\r\n\r\n  “Let him send off his foreign hirelings, and put the whole upon\r\n  the issue of a battle; I will trust only to the king my father’s\r\n  subjects, who were, or shall be, engaged in mine and their country’s\r\n  cause. But notwithstanding all the opposition he can make, I still\r\n  trust in the justice of my cause, the valour of my troops, and the\r\n  assistance of the Almighty, to bring my enterprise to a glorious\r\n  issue.\r\n\r\n  “It is now time to conclude, and I shall do it with this reflection;\r\n  civil wars are ever attended with rancour and ill-will, which\r\n  party-rage never fails to produce in the minds of those whom\r\n  different interests, principles, or views, set in opposition to one\r\n  another: I therefore earnestly require it of my friends, to give\r\n  as little loose as possible to such passions: this will prove the\r\n  most effectual means to prevent the same in the enemies of our royal\r\n  cause. And this my declaration will vindicate to all posterity the\r\n  nobleness of my undertaking, and the generosity of my intentions.”\r\n\r\nDuring Charles’s stay in Edinburgh the magisterial authority was in\r\ncomplete abeyance, and thieves and robbers, no longer restrained\r\nby the arm of power, stalked about, in open day, following their\r\nvocation. Under pretence of searching for arms, predatory bands,\r\nwearing white cockades and the Highland dress, perambulated the\r\ncountry, imposing upon and robbing the people. One of the most noted\r\nof these was headed by one James Ratcliffe, the same individual who\r\nfigures so conspicuously in the Heart of Mid-Lothian, and who, having\r\nspent all his life in the commission of acts of robbery, had twice\r\nreceived sentence of death, but had contrived to effect his escape\r\nfrom jail.[973] To suppress these and other acts of violence, Charles\r\nissued several edicts, and in one or two instances the last penalty\r\nof the law was inflicted by his orders upon the culprits.\r\n\r\nEarly in October a ship from France arrived at Montrose with some\r\narms and ammunition and a small sum of money. On board this vessel\r\nwas the Marquis Boyer d’Eguille, who arrived at Holyrood house on the\r\n14th of October. The object of his journey was not exactly known, but\r\nhis arrival was represented as a matter of great importance, and he\r\nwas passed off as an ambassador from the French court. This vessel\r\nwas soon followed by two others in succession, one of which brought,\r\nin addition to a supply of arms and money, some Irish officers in\r\nthe service of France. The other had on board six field-pieces\r\nand a company of artillerymen. These succours, though small, were\r\nopportune, and were considered as an earnest of more substantial\r\nones, of which d’Eguille gave the prince the strongest assurances. To\r\nfacilitate and shorten the conveyance of arms and cannon, and of the\r\nreinforcements still expected from the north, batteries were raised\r\nat Alloa and on the immediately opposite side of the Frith of Forth,\r\nacross which these were transported without any annoyance, although\r\nthe Fox, a British man-of-war, was stationed in the Frith.\r\n\r\nThe army of the prince continued to increase by the arrival of\r\nseveral additional detachments from the north, and before the end\r\nof October he found that his forces amounted to nearly 6,000 men;\r\nbut this number was far below what Charles had expected. He had\r\nentertained hopes that by the exertions of Lord Lovat and other\r\nchiefs, whom he expected to declare in his favour, about triple\r\nthat number would have been raised; but a messenger who arrived at\r\nEdinburgh from his lordship, brought him intelligence which rendered\r\nhis expectations less sanguine. Lovat had calculated that he would\r\nbe able to raise by his own influence a force of 4,000 or 5,000 men\r\nfor the service of Charles; and, the better to conceal his design,\r\nhe opened a correspondence with President Forbes, in which, with\r\nhis characteristic duplicity and cunning, he avowed himself a warm\r\nsupporter of the government, and succeeded for a considerable time\r\nin throwing the president off his guard. By degrees, however, his\r\nreal intentions began to develop themselves, and after the battle\r\nof Preston he resolved to assemble his clan for the purpose of\r\njoining the prince. To deceive the government he compelled his\r\nson, (afterwards known as General Fraser,) a youth of eighteen who\r\nhad been pursuing his studies at the university of St. Andrews, to\r\nput himself at the head of the clan, and afterwards pretended that\r\nhis son had, by this proceeding, acted in direct opposition to his\r\norders.[974] The only force raised south of the Tay was a regiment\r\nof 450 men which Colonel Roy Stewart formed in Edinburgh during the\r\nstay of the Highland army; for, although the prince was joined at\r\nEdinburgh by the Earls of Kilmarnock and Kellie, Lord Balmerino,\r\nMaxwell of Kirkconnel, and other south-country gentlemen, they did\r\nnot bring as many men along with them as would have formed the staff\r\nof a company.\r\n\r\nHaving now spent nearly six weeks in Edinburgh, the prince considered\r\nthat he could no longer delay his intended march into England.\r\nBy postponing that measure a few days longer he might have still\r\nfarther increased his force by the return of the men who had gone\r\nhome after the battle, of whom he had received favourable accounts;\r\nby the accession of a body of Gordons which Lord Lewis, brother to\r\nthe Duke of Gordon, was raising among the followers of the family;\r\nand by other small corps from the north. But it was judged that this\r\nadvantage would be more than counterbalanced by other circumstances\r\nattendant upon delay. The long stay of the Highland army in Scotland\r\nhad enabled the government to concentrate a considerable force in\r\nthe north of England, already far superior, in point of numbers,\r\nto the prince’s troops, and this force was about to receive large\r\nadditions from the south and from the continent. Nothing but a\r\ndread of the Highlanders and ignorance of their real strength kept\r\nthe English army, already concentrated in the north, from entering\r\nScotland; but terrible as was the impression made upon the minds of\r\nthe English troops, by the reports which had been carried to England\r\nof the prowess of the Highlanders, it was not to be supposed, that,\r\nafter the arrival of large reinforcements, their commanders would\r\nremain inactive. Had the government been aware of the weakness of\r\nthe prince’s army after the battle of Gladsmuir, it would probably\r\nnot have delayed a single week in sending an army into Scotland;\r\nbut the exaggerated reports which had been every where spread,\r\nof the great strength of the Highland army, were fully credited.\r\nAttempts were made by some friends of the government, as well as\r\nby others, to ascertain their numbers; but Charles, by perpetually\r\nshifting their cantonments, and dividing them into detached bodies,\r\nnot only contrived to conceal his weakness, but to impress these\r\nprying persons with an idea that he was much stronger than he really\r\nwas.[975]\r\n\r\nAnother reason for hastening his march south was the danger that\r\nthe army might be diminished by desertion if kept in a state of\r\ninactivity. Desertions were frequent, and it was thought that\r\nnothing but an active life would put an end to a practice imputed\r\nto idleness and repose, and which allowed the men time to think on\r\ntheir families, and contemplate the hardships and dangers they were\r\nlikely to undergo in a foreign land. But the chief motive which urged\r\nCharles and his council to put the army in motion was an apprehension\r\nthat their supplies of money would be soon exhausted, in which event\r\nit would be quite impossible to keep the army together for a single\r\nday. By adhering to a declaration he had made, that he would not\r\nenforce the obnoxious malt tax; the public money, which had been\r\ncollected, and was still in course of being raised, was far from\r\nbeing adequate to support the army which Charles had collected; and\r\nthe contributions of his friends, which at first were considerable,\r\nwere now beginning to fail. The supplies which had lately been\r\nreceived from France were therefore very opportune; but without\r\nadditional and early pecuniary succours, which, though promised,\r\nmight not speedily arrive or might miscarry, it was considered that\r\nunless the exchequer was replenished in England, the abandonment\r\nof the enterprise was inevitable. For these reasons, and as the\r\nprince informed his council[976] that he had received the strongest\r\nassurances of support from numbers of the English Tories and\r\nJacobites, a unanimous resolution was entered into to march forthwith\r\ninto England.[977]\r\n\r\nUpon this resolution being adopted, the prince despatched a messenger\r\nto France with intelligence of his intentions, and to solicit the\r\nFrench court to make a descent on England. As this court had all\r\nalong given as its reason for not seconding the prince’s designs, by\r\nsending an army into England, the doubt which it had of his having\r\na considerable party in that country, the messenger was instructed\r\nto represent the situation of the prince’s affairs in the most\r\nfavourable point of view. This person, by name Alexander Gordon,\r\na Jesuit, left Edinburgh accordingly on the 28th of October. On\r\narriving in France he drew up a most flattering report, which he put\r\ninto the hands of the prince’s brother, Henry, Duke of York, then at\r\nParis, to be laid before the French king. In this report he stated,\r\nthat while the prince had about 12,000 men with him in Edinburgh\r\nand its vicinity, there were 4,000 more expected to arrive--that\r\nhe had already upwards of 1,000 cavalry, and that a great number\r\nmore were on their march to join him,--that almost all these troops\r\nwere well armed, and were amply provided with every necessary,--and\r\nthat all the inhabitants of the counties and towns where the prince\r\nhad appeared, and particularly those of Edinburgh and Glasgow, had\r\nfurnished the army with clothing, arms, and money, and, in short,\r\nwith every thing in their power. He stated, that besides the Highland\r\nchiefs and the noblemen of different counties, who had declared in\r\nfavour of the prince before the battle of Preston, a great number\r\nof persons of distinction had since joined him at Edinburgh, among\r\nwhom he particularly enumerated Lord Nithsdale and Kenmure, and\r\nMaxwell of Kirkconnel,--that besides these there were many others,\r\nwho, being unable to give their personal services, had sent the\r\nprince horses, arms, and money, and that after the prince’s father\r\nhad been proclaimed in the capital and the most considerable towns\r\nin Scotland, those who had formerly shown themselves least disposed\r\nto acknowledge him had displayed the most favourable dispositions\r\ntowards the prince, being either subdued by the charms of his\r\nmanners, or gained over by his manifestoes and proclamations. In\r\nshort, that by the astonishing victory he had achieved, many persons,\r\nwho would otherwise have still been in connexion with the court of\r\nLondon, had submitted themselves to the prince, who might be said\r\nto be now absolute master of Scotland. That with regard to England,\r\nthe people of that kingdom were ready to receive the prince with open\r\narms as soon as he should appear among them with an army supported by\r\nFrance,--that, independently of the general discontent of the nation\r\nwith the government, the prince was emboldened to enter England by\r\nupwards of a hundred invitations which he had received from the\r\nnobility of England, and by large sums of money which he had obtained\r\nfor the payment of his troops,--that the English government, alarmed\r\nat this state of things, had, as was reported, hesitated accepting\r\noffers, which some counties had made of raising bodies of militia,\r\nfor fear that this force would be employed against itself. In fine,\r\nthat such was the disposition of men’s minds throughout the whole of\r\nGreat Britain, that the fear of the prince not being supported by\r\nforeign aid, of which the court of London was in great dread, alone\r\nprevented the people from openly declaring themselves, and that every\r\nperson was persuaded, that for every thousand of foreign troops which\r\nthe prince could bring into the field, his army would receive an\r\naccession, four times as large, from the English people, who only\r\nwanted the presence of a foreign force to encourage them to take up\r\narms against the government.[978]\r\n\r\nThe last days of October were occupied in making the necessary\r\narrangements for the march of the Highland army; preparatory to\r\nwhich, orders were issued, near the end of that month, to call in\r\nthe different parties which were posted at Newhaven, Leith, and\r\nother places in the vicinity of Edinburgh. The army which, for three\r\nweeks after the battle of Preston had lain in camp at Duddingston,\r\nhad, since the middle of October, been quartered in and around the\r\ncity; but on the 26th of that month the main body left Edinburgh,\r\nand encamped on a field a little to the west of Inveresk church,\r\nwith a battery of seven or eight pieces of cannon pointing to the\r\nsouth-west.[979] Hitherto Charles, to conceal his weakness, had\r\nreviewed his army in detached portions; but he now ordered a general\r\nreview of his whole force on the 28th of October. The place appointed\r\nwas Leith links; but being warned by a few bombs which were thrown\r\nfrom the castle as the army was approaching the ground, that he might\r\nexpect some annoyance, Charles abandoned his intention, and reviewed\r\nhis army on the sands between Leith and Musselburgh.[980]\r\n\r\nOf the deportment of Charles, and the mode in which he spent his time\r\nduring his abode at Holyrood house, it may now be necessary to say a\r\nfew words. It has been already stated on the authority of an officer\r\nin his army, whose memoirs are quoted by Mr. Home, that before\r\nthe meeting of his council, Charles held a levee. The same writer\r\nadds, that after the rising of the council, which generally sat\r\nvery long, he dined in public with his principal officers, and that\r\nwhile the army lay at Duddingston he rode out there after dinner,\r\naccompanied by his life-guards.[981] The object of these visits was\r\nto keep the Highlanders together; and to show them that the change\r\nof circumstances had not altered his disposition towards them, he\r\nfrequently supped and slept in the camp.[982]\r\n\r\nAnother writer, an eye-witness,[983] says that “the prince’s court\r\nat Holyrood soon became very brilliant, and that every day from\r\nmorning to night there was a vast concourse of well-dressed people.\r\nBesides the gentlemen that had joined the prince, there was a great\r\nnumber of ladies and gentlemen who came either from affection or\r\ncuriosity. People flocked from all quarters to see the novelty of a\r\ncourt which had not been held in Scotland for sixty years, and from\r\nits splendour, and the air of satisfaction which appeared in every\r\nperson’s countenance, one would have thought the king was already\r\nrestored, and in peaceable possession of all the dominions of his\r\nancestors, and that the prince had only made a trip to Scotland to\r\nshow himself to the people, and receive their homage.” The conduct\r\nof Charles corresponded in all respects with the attentions shown\r\nhim. He professed the warmest attachment to Scotland, and was often\r\nheard to say, that should he succeed in his attempt, he would make\r\nScotland his Hanover, and Holyrood house his Herenhausen;[984] an\r\nexpression by which he not only marked his devotion to the Scotch\r\nnation, but conveyed a severe rebuke upon King George, who was justly\r\naccused of an undue predilection for his native soil.\r\n\r\nTo mark his sense of the respect shown him, and to ingratiate himself\r\nstill more with his new friends, Charles gave a series of balls and\r\nentertainments in the palace, which were attended by all the persons\r\nof rank and fashion assembled in the capital. On these occasions, the\r\nyoung Chevalier appeared sometimes in an English court-dress with the\r\nblue ribbon, star, and other insignia of the order of the garter, and\r\nat other times in a Highland dress of fine silk tartan, with crimson\r\nvelvet breeches, and the cross of St. Andrew.[985] His politeness,\r\naffability, and condescension, were the theme of universal\r\nconversation. Captivated by the charms of his conversation, the\r\ngraces of his person, and the unwearied attentions which he bestowed\r\non them, the ladies entered warmly into the prince’s views; and their\r\npartizanship became so available to his cause as to attract, as we\r\nhave seen, the especial attention of President Forbes. Indeed, so\r\nstrong was the hold which the spirit of Jacobitism had taken of the\r\nhearts of the ladies of Edinburgh, that when afterwards overawed by\r\nthe presence of an English army, they, nevertheless, continued to\r\nwear the Jacobite badge, and treated the approaches of the Duke of\r\nCumberland’s officers with supercilious indifference. As Charles was\r\nalmost wholly destitute of every household requisite, his female\r\nfriends sent plate, china, linen, and other articles of domestic use\r\nto the palace.[986]\r\n\r\nAt the present stage of this history, it seems proper to record\r\na manifesto which emanated from Charles’s army on the eve of\r\nits departure for England, which, as an historical document of\r\nconsiderable interest, shall be given entire. It was titled, “The\r\ndeclaration and admonitory letter of such of the nobility, gentry,\r\nand freeborn subjects of his majesty, as, under the auspicious\r\nconduct of his royal highness, Charles, prince of Wales, steward of\r\nScotland, &c., have taken up arms in support of the cause of their\r\nking and country.” It was addressed “unto those who have not as yet\r\ndeclared their approbation of this enterprise; and to such as have,\r\nor may hereafter, appear in arms against it.”\r\n\r\n  “COUNTRYMEN AND FELLOW-SUBJECTS,--It is with abundance of regret,\r\n  and not without indignation, that we daily hear and see this\r\n  our undertaking, which in glory and disinterestedness may vie\r\n  with any to be met with, either in ancient or modern history,\r\n  traduced, misrepresented, and reviled in those fulsome addresses\r\n  and associations made to and in favours of the Elector of\r\n  Hanover, by those very bishops of the church of England, who,\r\n  for so many years, have contributed their utmost endeavours to\r\n  abet and support every measure the most unpopular, pernicious,\r\n  and hurtful, that the worst of ministers, be he of what party he\r\n  would, could ever devise for the undoing of these nations.\r\n\r\n  “Is it from such patterns of virtue and piety that the nation\r\n  now must take the alarm? Are we by these old bugbears of popery,\r\n  slavery, and tyranny, for ever to be hindered from pursuing our\r\n  only true interest? Or, is the groundless fear of an imaginary\r\n  evil to prevent our shaking off the heavy yoke we daily feel?\r\n\r\n  “What further security, in the name of God, can a people desire\r\n  for the enjoyment of their ecclesiastical rights? Have not both\r\n  the king and prince regent sworn in the most solemn manner\r\n  to maintain the protestant religion throughout his majesty’s\r\n  dominions? Nay, more, have they not promised to pass any laws\r\n  which shall be thought necessary for the further security of\r\n  it? Are we not protestants who now address you? And is it not\r\n  by the strength of a protestant army that he must mount the\r\n  throne? Can any man, or number of men, persuade you, that we,\r\n  who are your brethren, born in the same island, and who have the\r\n  same interest, do not love ourselves, our religion, laws and\r\n  liberties, as well as you do?\r\n\r\n  “What further security can the nature of the thing admit of?\r\n  You have your prince’s promises, and here you have laid before\r\n  you the sentiments of his army; who, having thankfully accepted\r\n  of them, are determined and resolved to set their country at\r\n  liberty, by establishing that glorious plan which has been freely\r\n  offered to us by the only rightful prince of the British nations;\r\n  and this must be done before we sheath our swords.\r\n\r\n  “Our enemies have represented us as men of low birth and of\r\n  desperate fortunes. We, who are now in arms, are, for the\r\n  greatest part, of the most ancient families of this island,\r\n  whose forefathers asserted the liberties of their country, long,\r\n  long before the names of many of our declaimers were ever heard\r\n  of. Our blood is good, and that our actions shall make appear.\r\n  If our fortunes be not great, our virtue has kept them low;\r\n  and desperate we may be truly called, for we are determined to\r\n  conquer or die.\r\n\r\n  “The justice, therefore, of the cause we now appear for, the\r\n  interest of the nation which we support and pursue, and the\r\n  glorious character of our royal leader, may each by itself, or\r\n  all together, abundantly convince the nation, that now at last\r\n  there appears an happy and unforeseen opportunity of acquiring\r\n  all those blessings which a distrest nation has been so long\r\n  wishing for in vain.\r\n\r\n  “This golden opportunity we have laid hold of; and in justice to\r\n  ourselves and fellow-subjects, are obliged thus to apprize them\r\n  of the uprightness of our intentions in carrying into execution\r\n  a scheme calculated and adapted to those principles of liberty\r\n  which the true lovers of their country have been polishing and\r\n  refining for these many years past.\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps you may find fault that you were not apprized of this\r\n  undertaking. No more were we. God has conducted, the prince of\r\n  Wales has executed; and we are thereby in possession of Scotland,\r\n  and victorious over one of the Elector’s armies, which nothing\r\n  could have saved from total destruction but the authority and\r\n  mercy of a young conqueror, possest of all the shining virtues\r\n  which can adorn a throne, and who may challenge the keenest enemy\r\n  of his royal family to impute to him a vice which can blacken\r\n  the character of a prince. Compare his clemency towards all\r\n  the prisoners and wounded at the battle of Gladsmuir, with the\r\n  executions, imprisonments, and banishments, exercised by the\r\n  German family after their success at Preston in the year 1715,\r\n  and your affections will tell you who is the true father of the\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  “We have hitherto only spoke to your interests: when his royal\r\n  highness comes himself amongst you, let his appearance, his\r\n  moderation, his affability, his tenderness and affection for\r\n  those he can truly call his countrymen, speak to your passions;\r\n  then you who, at the instigation of your enemies, are now arming\r\n  for the defence, as you imagine, of your respective communities,\r\n  will be able to judge from whom you will have the best reason to\r\n  expect protection. Thus far we can take upon us to promise in his\r\n  highness’s name, that such as shall make no resistance to our\r\n  troops, though before our arrival they may have been levying war\r\n  against us, may nevertheless depend upon the most ample security\r\n  for their persons and estates, provided, by a timely surrender\r\n  of their arms, they put in our power to protect them against\r\n  the fury of the army: and how foolish will it be, after this\r\n  assurance, for any city, corporation, or county, to attempt to\r\n  make head against the combined force of a whole nation, collected\r\n  in a numerous army, and flushed with success? If any misfortune,\r\n  therefore, ensue from a disregard of this admonition, we of his\r\n  royal highness’s army declare ourselves free of all blame therein.\r\n\r\n  “It is time for you now, O countrymen! to lay aside all\r\n  animosities, all distinctions of families or names, and to\r\n  confine your thoughts only to the interest of these kingdoms,\r\n  connecting with them as you go along the sentiments you had a few\r\n  years ago.\r\n\r\n  “What transport of joy would the bulk of the British nation have\r\n  felt upon a certain remarkable and never-to-be-forgotten period\r\n  in our political history, (that great change of ministry which\r\n  happened not long ago, when the cries of a distressed people,\r\n  supported by the interest and influence of powerful, though\r\n  designing men, accomplished the ruin of a mighty minister,) how\r\n  great would have been your joy had you then had from the Elector\r\n  of Hanover such a declaration as that emitted the 10th of this\r\n  month by his royal highness, the heir and representative of our\r\n  natural and only rightful sovereign?\r\n\r\n  “Is it possible to conceive the universal satisfaction which such\r\n  a declaration would have occasioned, unless we judge of it by\r\n  our fatal disappointment?--We leave it to yourselves to make the\r\n  application. As it is not our intention here to set forth the\r\n  domestic grievances of the nation, nor the scandalous preference\r\n  showed upon all occasions to a pitiful foreign concern; for as\r\n  we address ourselves chiefly to the friends of liberty and the\r\n  constitution, we suppose you all abundantly instructed in them:\r\n  nor would it serve but to lengthen this letter, to enumerate\r\n  the many promises in the king’s and prince’s declarations\r\n  and manifestoes to his subjects upon this occasion; we have\r\n  abundantly explained our own motives for now appearing in arms,\r\n  and would willingly use a little serious expostulation with you,\r\n  gentlemen, who intend to oppose us.\r\n\r\n  “What then, in the name of God, do you propose to yourselves? Is\r\n  it also the interest of Great Britain and Ireland? Or, is it the\r\n  support of the Elector of Hanover’s family in the succession to\r\n  the crown of these realms? If your armaments proceed from the\r\n  first of these motives, tell us what a prince can do more to make\r\n  you a free and a happy people? What security can you have more\r\n  than his word and his army’s guarantee, until the nation shall\r\n  have time abundantly to secure themselves by parliament?\r\n\r\n  “If you be satisfied with the promises made you, and the security\r\n  of the performance, do you disapprove of this method of bringing\r\n  about the execution by force of arms? If you do, be so good as\r\n  suggest another equally efficacious.\r\n\r\n  “That by parliament, indeed, would have been universally the\r\n  most acceptable; but we cannot be so infatuated as to remain in\r\n  eternal bondage, unless a parliament, composed of hirelings,\r\n  should set us at liberty; nor have we any hopes that the Elector\r\n  will strip himself of that pecuniary influence by which alone he\r\n  has carried, over the bellies of the nation, every destructive\r\n  measure.\r\n\r\n  “On the other hand, if the dispute is to be whether the Stuart\r\n  or Hanoverian family shall reign over Great Britain, without\r\n  reference to the interest of the nation, we need use no other\r\n  argument than the sword with such as shall oppose us upon these\r\n  principles.\r\n\r\n  “To conclude, we desire to lay this important question before\r\n  you in a new light. Suppose, for it is only a supposition, that\r\n  this dreadful and unnatural rebellion, as you are taught to call\r\n  it, should be extinguished and quashed, and every man concerned\r\n  in it executed on a scaffold; your joy, no doubt, would be very\r\n  great upon so glorious an event; your addresses would then be\r\n  turned into thanksgivings,--your parliament would then meet and\r\n  cloath your beloved sovereign with new powers,--your standing\r\n  army, which has hitherto been looked upon as the bane of the\r\n  constitution, would then be consecrated as your deliverers; and\r\n  the reverend bishops of the church of England would be hailed\r\n  from the most distant corners of the island by the glorious\r\n  appellation of patriots and protectors of British liberty. O\r\n  happy, thrice happy nation, who have such an army and such a\r\n  bench of bishops ready upon this occasion to rescue them from\r\n  popery, and slavery, tyranny, and arbitrary power!\r\n\r\n  “When, indeed, the first transport of your joy would be\r\n  over,--for you are not to expect that these halcyon days are ever\r\n  to remain,--you might perhaps find, to your fatal experience,\r\n  that the constitution of your country was not in the least\r\n  improved; and upon the return of the unavoidable consequences\r\n  of those evils all along complained of, and which now you have\r\n  so fair an opportunity of having redressed, you would at last\r\n  be sensible that we were those who, in truth, deserved the\r\n  appellation of deliverers, patriots, and protectors of the\r\n  British liberty. But this last part of our letter is addressed\r\n  only to such as we expect to meet with in a field of battle, and\r\n  we are hopeful that those will prove but an inconsiderable part\r\n  of the nations of Great Britain and Ireland; and that you, our\r\n  countrymen and fellow-subjects, upon being advised and informed,\r\n  as you now have been, of the whole plan of this glorious\r\n  expedition, will cheerfully join issue with us, and share in the\r\n  glory of restoring our king and in setting our country free,\r\n  which, by the strength of our arm, the assistance of our allies,\r\n  and the blessing of Almighty God, we shortly expect to see\r\n  accomplished.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the prince and his partizans were thus spreading the seeds\r\nof insurrection, and endeavouring to improve the advantages they\r\nhad gained, the ministry of Great Britain, aroused to a just sense\r\nof the impending danger, took every possible measure to retard the\r\nprogress of the insurrection. King George had returned to London\r\non the 31st of August. He met with a cordial reception from the\r\nnobility and gentry in the capital, and loyal addresses were voted\r\nby all the principal cities, and towns and corporations in the\r\nkingdom. A demand was made upon the states-general for the 6,000 men\r\nstipulated by treaty, part of whom were landed at Berwick the day\r\nafter Cope’s defeat. Three battalions of guards, and seven regiments\r\nof foot, were ordered home from Flanders, and a cabinet council was\r\nheld at Kensington on the 13th of September, which directed letters\r\nto be sent to the lords-lieutenant and _custodes rotulorum_ of the\r\ncounties of England and Wales to raise the militia. Marshal Wade was\r\ndespatched to the north of England to take the command of the forces\r\nin that quarter, and two regiments, of 1,000 each, were ordered to\r\nbe transported from Dublin to Chester. A number of blank commissions\r\nwere, as has been before stated, sent to the north of Scotland to\r\nraise independent companies; the Earl of Loudon was despatched to\r\nInverness to take the command, and two ships of war were sent down\r\nwith arms to the same place.\r\n\r\nAs popery had been formerly a serviceable bugbear to alarm the people\r\nfor their religion and liberties, some of the English bishops issued\r\nmandates to their clergy, enjoining them to instil into their people\r\n“a just abhorrence of popery” and of arbitrary power, both of which\r\nthey supposed to be inseparably connected; a proceeding which formed\r\na singular contrast with the conduct of their brethren, the Scottish\r\nprotestant episcopal clergy, who to a man were zealously desirous\r\nof restoring the Stuarts. The clergy attended to the injunctions\r\nthey had received, and their admonitions were not without effect.\r\nAssociations were speedily formed in every county, city, and town\r\nin England, of any consideration, in defence of the religion and\r\nliberties of the nation, and all persons, of whatever rank or degree,\r\nseemed equally zealous to protect both.\r\n\r\nThe parliament met on the 17th of October, and was informed by his\r\nmajesty that he had been obliged to call them together sooner than he\r\nintended, in consequence of an unnatural rebellion which had broken\r\nout, and was still continued in Scotland, to suppress and extinguish\r\nwhich rebellion he craved the immediate advice and assistance of\r\nthe parliament. Both houses voted addresses, in which they gave\r\nhis majesty the strongest assurances of duty and affection to his\r\nperson and government, and promised to adopt measures commensurate\r\nwith the danger. The _habeas corpus_ act was suspended for six\r\nmonths, and several persons were apprehended on suspicion. The Duke\r\nof Cumberland, the king’s second son, arrived from the Netherlands\r\nshortly after the opening of the session, and on the 25th of October\r\na large detachment of cavalry and infantry arrived in the Thames from\r\nFlanders. The train-bands of London were reviewed by his majesty\r\non the 28th; the county regiments were completed; and the persons\r\nwho had associated themselves in different parts of the kingdom as\r\nvolunteers, were daily engaged in the exercise of arms. Apprehensive\r\nof an invasion from France, the government appointed Admiral Vernon\r\nto command a squadron in the Downs, to watch the motions of the enemy\r\nby sea. Cruisers were stationed along the French coast, particularly\r\noff Dunkirk and Boulogne, which captured several ships destined for\r\nScotland with officers, soldiers, and ammunition for the use of the\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nThe birth-day of George II., which fell on the 30th of October,\r\nwas celebrated throughout the whole of England with extraordinary\r\ndemonstrations of loyalty. Many extravagant scenes were enacted,\r\nwhich, though they may now appear ludicrous and absurd, were deemed\r\nby the actors as deeds of the purest and most exalted patriotism. In\r\nScotland, however, with one remarkable exception, the supporters of\r\ngovernment did not venture upon any public display. The exception\r\nalluded to was the town of Perth, some of whose inhabitants took\r\npossession of the church and steeple about mid-day, and rang the\r\nbells. Oliphant of Gask, who had been made deputy-governor of the\r\ntown by the young Chevalier, and had under him a small party, sent\r\nto desire those who rang the bells to desist; but they refused to\r\ncomply, and continued ringing at intervals until midnight, two hours\r\nafter the ordinary time. Mr. Oliphant, with his small guard and three\r\nor four gentlemen, posted themselves in the council-house, in order\r\nto secure about 1,400 small arms, some ammunition, &c., belonging\r\nto the Highland army, deposited there and in the adjoining jail. At\r\nnight seven north-country gentlemen, in the Jacobite interest, came\r\nto town with their servants, and immediately joined their friends in\r\nthe council-house: when it grew dark the mob made bonfires in the\r\nstreets, and ordered the inhabitants to illuminate their windows, an\r\norder which was generally obeyed, and the few that refused had their\r\nwindows broken. About nine o’clock at night a party sallied from\r\nthe council-house, and marching up the street to disperse the mob,\r\nfired upon and wounded three of them. The mob, exasperated by this\r\nattack, rushed in upon the party, and disarmed and wounded some of\r\nthem. After this rencontre the mob placed guards at all the gates of\r\nthe town, took possession of the main-guard and rung the fire-bell,\r\nby which they drew together about 200 people. They thereupon sent a\r\nmessage to Mr. Oliphant, requiring him to withdraw immediately from\r\nthe town and yield up the arms, ammunition, &c. Mr. Oliphant having\r\nrefused, they rang the fire-bell a second time, and hostilities\r\ncommenced about two o’clock in the morning, and continued about three\r\nhours. The people fired at the council-house from the heads of lanes,\r\nfrom behind stairs, and from windows, so that the party within could\r\nnot look out without the greatest hazard. About five o’clock the\r\nmob dispersed. An Irish captain in the French service was killed in\r\nthe council-house, and three or four of Mr. Oliphant’s party were\r\nwounded. Of the mob, which was without a leader, four were wounded.\r\nTo preserve order, about 60 of Lord Nairne’s men were brought into\r\nthe town next day, and these were soon thereafter joined by about 130\r\nHighlanders.[987]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[952] _Culloden Papers_, p. 250.\r\n\r\n[953] Id., p. 227.\r\n\r\n[954] Id., p. 426.\r\n\r\n[955] Id., p. 253.\r\n\r\n[956] _Culloden Papers_, p. 420.\r\n\r\n[957] Kirkconnel MS.\r\n\r\n[958] Id.\r\n\r\n[959] _Memoirs_, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[960] Home, p. 120.\r\n\r\n[961] Appendix to Home’s _Rebellion_, No. xxviii.\r\n\r\n[962] Home, p. 124.\r\n\r\n[963] Marchant’s _History of the Rebellion_, p. 113.--Boyse, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[964] Kirkconnel MS.\r\n\r\n[965] Home, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[966] Home, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[967] Lovat’s Trial, p. 138.\r\n\r\n[968] _Culloden Papers_, p. 250.\r\n\r\n[969] _Culloden Papers_, p. 246.\r\n\r\n[970] Idem.\r\n\r\n[971] Idem, p. 404.\r\n\r\n[972] The following is a list of the officers of eighteen of the\r\nindependent companies, being the whole number raised, with the dates\r\nof the delivery of their commissions on the completion of their\r\ncompanies, and of their arrival at Inverness:--\r\n\r\n    _Captains._       _Lieutenants._   _Ensigns._   _Dates of completing\r\n                                                      the companies, and\r\n                                                        of their arrival\r\n                                                          at Inverness._\r\n\r\n   1.

After stating,\r\nthat by degrees all the colonels of the army were admitted into it,\r\nhe thus proceeds:--“I must acknowledge that very few of the members\r\nof this assembly were either able statesmen or experienced officers;\r\nbut as those who knew least were generally led by the opinions of\r\nthose they thought wiser than themselves, and they in their turn had\r\nprivate conferences with the ablest of the prince’s secret friends\r\nin Edinburgh, things might have been well enough conducted had there\r\nbeen as much harmony and union as the importance of the affair\r\nrequired; but an ill-timed emulation soon crept in, and bred great\r\ndissensions and animosities. The council was insensibly divided into\r\nfactions, and came to be of little use when measures were approved\r\nof or condemned, not for themselves, but for the sake of their\r\nauthor. These dissensions, begun at Edinburgh, continued ever after,\r\nand their fatal influence was not always confined to the council:\r\nby degrees it reached the army; and though the prince’s orders\r\nwere ever respected and punctually obeyed by the army, there were,\r\nnevertheless, a certain discontent and diffidence which appeared\r\non sundry occasions, especially towards the end, and was very\r\ndetrimental to his affairs.”--_Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[977] Idem.\r\n\r\n[978] Vide the report in the _Stuart Papers_, and a letter of 26th\r\nNovember, 1745, from Gordon to the Chevalier de St. George, inclosing\r\na copy of his report.\r\n\r\n[979] Marchant, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[980] Boyse, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[981] Home, p. 139.\r\n\r\n[982] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[983] Maxwell of Kirkconnel.\r\n\r\n[984] Henderson, p. 92.\r\n\r\n[985] Boyse, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[986] Idem.\r\n\r\n[987] Adamson’s _Muses Threnodie_, Perth ed. of 1774.

After some deliberation the council advised the Prince\r\nto march straight to Berwick, of which town they thought he could\r\neasily make himself master, and thence to Newcastle and give battle\r\nto Marshal Wade, who had collected a force in the neighbourhood of\r\nthat town. If victorious, the prince was to march to London by the\r\neast coast, so as to favour the disembarkation of any troops that\r\nFrance might send over destined to land on that coast. But this\r\nplan, though unanimously approved of, was overturned by Lord George\r\nMurray, who was of a very different opinion from the rest of the\r\ncouncil. In presence of several of the principal officers of the\r\narmy he represented the plan of a march along the east coast as an\r\naffair of great difficulty, and that its advantages, if it really\r\nhad any, would be more than compensated by the loss of time it\r\nwould occasion, which at the present juncture was very precious. He\r\ntherefore proposed that the army should march into England by the\r\nwestern road, and that to conceal its route it should march in two\r\ncolumns, one by Kelso and the other column by Moffat, so that both\r\ncolumns could easily join near Carlisle, on a day to be appointed.\r\nFinding that Lord George’s arguments had prevailed with most of the\r\nofficers, Charles agreed to his scheme, though he considered the\r\nroute by Berwick as the better of the two.[988]\r\n\r\nPreparatory to their march the insurgents removed their camp to\r\na strong position to the west of Dalkeith, six miles south of\r\nEdinburgh, having that town on their left, the South Esk in front,\r\nthe North Esk in their rear, with an opening on their right towards\r\nPolton. From this camp a detachment was sent with three pieces of\r\ncannon to secure the pass of the Forth above Stirling, lest Lord\r\nLoudon should march south with the independent companies he was\r\nforming, and attempt to force the passage.[989]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Thursday the 31st of October, Prince Charles\r\nfinally left Holyrood House accompanied by his life-guards, and\r\nseveral of the clan-regiments, amid the regrets of a vast concourse\r\nof spectators, most of whom were never to see him again. He slept\r\nthat night at Pinkie House, and went next morning to Dalkeith, and\r\ntook up his quarters in Dalkeith House, the seat of the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch. On that day he was joined by the clan Pherson, under the\r\ncommand of their chief, Macpherson of Cluny, by Menzies of Shien and\r\nhis men, and some small parties of Highlanders, amounting altogether\r\nto between 900 and 1,000 men.\r\n\r\nAt this period the state of the insurgent army was as follows. Of\r\ncavalry, the first troop of horse-guards, which was commanded by\r\nLord Elcho, consisted of 62 gentlemen with their servants, under\r\n5 officers. It amounted in all to 120. The second troop, which\r\nwas commanded by the honourable Arthur Elphinstone, afterwards\r\nLord Balmerino, was not complete, and did not exceed 40 horse. A\r\nsmall squadron, called the horse-grenadiers, was commanded by the\r\nEarl of Kilmarnock, with which were incorporated some Perthshire\r\ngentlemen, in absence of Lord Strathallan their commander, who had\r\nbeen appointed governor of Perth and commander of the Jacobite forces\r\nin Scotland during the stay of the Highland army in England. These\r\nlast united, amounted to nearly 100. Lord Pitsligo was at the head\r\nof the Aberdeen and Banffshire gentlemen, who, with their servants,\r\namounted to about 120; and besides those enumerated, there was a\r\nparty of between 70 and 80 hussars, under the nominal command of\r\nSecretary Murray as colonel, but in reality under the direction of\r\none Baggot, an Irish officer, who had lately arrived from France.\r\nThe infantry, all of whom wore the Highland garb, consisted of\r\nthirteen battalions or regiments, six of which consisted of the\r\nclans, properly so called; of these six regiments, three were of the\r\nMacdonalds, and the other three were each composed of the Camerons,\r\nthe Stewarts of Appin, and the Macphersons. Three regiments of Athole\r\nmen, commonly called the Athole brigade, the regiments of the Duke of\r\nPerth, Lord Ogilvy, Glenbucket, and Roy Stewart, made up the thirteen\r\nregiments.[990] Of the infantry, which amounted to about 5,000 men,\r\nabout 4,000 were real Highlanders. Thus the total amount of the army\r\ndid not exceed 6,000 men.[991]\r\n\r\nThe clan-regiments, according to custom, were commanded by their\r\nrespective chiefs; but in some instances, in the absence of the\r\nchief, the regiment of the clan was commanded by his son, and failing\r\nboth, by the nearest kinsman of the chief. In these regiments every\r\ncompany had two captains, two lieutenants, and two ensigns, all of\r\nwhom were generally related, by ties of blood, to the chief. The\r\npay of a captain in the army was half-a-crown _per diem_; that of a\r\nlieutenant two shillings; and of an ensign one shilling and sixpence.\r\nThe front rank of each clan-regiment was composed of persons who were\r\nconsidered gentlemen by birth, though without fortune or means. The\r\npay of these was one shilling _per diem_. The gentlemen in the front\r\nrank were better armed than the men in the rear rank. All the former\r\nhad targets, which many of the latter had not. When fully armed, as\r\nwas generally the case, every gentleman of the front rank carried a\r\nmusket and broadsword, with a pair of pistols and a dirk stuck in the\r\nbelt which surrounded his body. In some rare instances another dagger\r\nwas stuck within the garter of the right leg, to be used in cases\r\nof emergency. A target, formed of wood and leather thickly studded\r\nwith nails, covered the left arm, and enabled the wearer to parry and\r\nprotect himself from the shots or blows of an assailant.\r\n\r\nThus armed, the success of a Highland army depended more upon\r\nindividual bravery than upon combined efforts, and their manner of\r\nfighting was, as the Chevalier Johnstone observes, adapted for brave\r\nbut undisciplined troops. “They advance,” says that writer, “with\r\nrapidity, discharge their pieces when within musket length of the\r\nenemy, and then, throwing them down, draw their swords, and holding\r\na dirk in their left hand with their target, they dart with fury on\r\nthe enemy through the smoke of their fire. When within reach of the\r\nenemy’s bayonets, bending their left knee, they, by their attitude,\r\ncover their bodies with their targets that receive their thrusts\r\nof the bayonets, which they contrive to parry, while at the same\r\ntime they raise their sword-arm, and strike their adversary. Having\r\nonce got within the bayonets, and into the ranks of the enemy, the\r\nsoldiers have no longer any means of defending themselves, the fate\r\nof the battle is decided in an instant, and the carnage follows; the\r\nHighlanders bringing down two men at a time, one with their dirk in\r\nthe left hand, and another with the sword. The reason assigned by the\r\nHighlanders for their custom of throwing their muskets on the ground\r\nis not without its force. They say they embarrass them in their\r\noperations, even when slung behind them, and on gaining a battle they\r\ncan pick them up along with the arms of their enemies; but if they\r\nshould be beaten, they have no occasion for muskets. They themselves\r\nproved that bravery may supply the place of discipline at times, as\r\ndiscipline supplies the place of bravery. The attack is so terrible,\r\nthat the best troops in Europe would with difficulty sustain the\r\nfirst shock of it; and if the swords of the Highlanders once come in\r\ncontact with them, their defeat is inevitable.”[992]\r\n\r\nIn entering upon such a desperate enterprise as the invasion of\r\nEngland with the handful of men he had mustered, Charles certainly\r\nmust have calculated on being supported by a large party in that\r\ncountry. Indeed, his chief reason for urging such a step was the\r\nnumerous assurances he alleged he had received from his friends in\r\nthat kingdom, that he would be joined by a very considerable body\r\nof the people; but there seems reason to believe, that, in his\r\nexpectations of support, he was guided almost solely by the reports\r\nof his agents, and that he had very little communication with any\r\nof the parties on whose support he relied.[993] In a memoir[994]\r\nwhich the prince presented to the King of France on his return from\r\nScotland, he states, that, if after the battle of Preston he had had\r\n3,000 regular troops under his command, in addition to his other\r\nforces, he could have penetrated into England, and marched to London,\r\nwithout opposition, as none of the English troops which were on the\r\ncontinent had arrived; but the case was now widely different, and\r\nwithout a general rising, it was next to impossible to succeed in\r\nthe face of a large regular army, which was assembling at different\r\npoints, supported by a numerous militia.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the plan of Lord George Murray, the advanced guard of the\r\nfirst division of the army left Dalkeith on the evening of Friday\r\nthe 1st of November, and took the road to Peebles. The main body,\r\nconsisting of the Athole brigade, the Duke of Perth’s regiment,\r\nthe regiments of Lord Ogilvy, Glenbucket, and Roy Stewart, and the\r\ngreater part of the horse followed next day. The artillery and\r\nbaggage were sent along with this column. This division was under the\r\ncommand of the Marquis of Tullibardine. The second division, which\r\nconsisted of the life-guards and the clan regiments, headed by the\r\nprince in person, marched from Dalkeith on the 3d of November in the\r\ndirection of Kelso. The guards formed the van, and the prince marched\r\non foot at the head of the clans with his target over his shoulder.\r\nIt was supposed that he would have mounted his horse after proceeding\r\na mile or two; but, to the surprise of every person, he marched on\r\nfoot the whole day, and continued the same practice during the whole\r\nof the expedition, wading through mud and snow, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that he could be prevailed upon to get on horseback, even\r\nto cross a river. The example he thus set to his men, joined to the\r\ncondescension and affability he displayed, endeared him to the army.\r\nCharles arrived at Lauder the same night, and took up his residence\r\nin Thirlstane castle, the seat of the Earl of Lauderdale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Duke of Perth.]\r\n\r\nAfter despatching part of his men by a middle course towards Selkirk\r\nand Hawick, the prince next day marched to Kelso. As Marshal Wade\r\nwas supposed to be on his way north from Newcastle, Charles sent\r\nhis life-guards across the Tweed, not so much for the purpose of\r\nreconnoitring, as for amusing the enemy. After advancing several\r\nmiles on the road to Newcastle, they halted at a village, and made\r\nsome inquiries as to quarters and accommodation for the army, which\r\nthey stated was on its march to Newcastle. Charles even sent orders\r\nto Wooler, a town on the road to Newcastle, to provide quarters for\r\nhis army. The design was to keep Wade in suspense, and draw off his\r\nattention from the movements of the Highland army upon Carlisle.\r\nWhile at Kelso, Charles sent a party of between 30 and 40 men across\r\nthe Tweed, to proclaim his father upon English ground. Having\r\nperformed the ceremony, they returned to Kelso.[995] The prince\r\nremained at Kelso till the 6th of November, on the morning of which\r\nday he crossed the Tweed. The river was scarcely fordable, but the\r\nmen were in high spirits, and when up to the middle in the water,\r\nthey expressed the ardour they felt by setting up a loud shout and\r\ndischarging their pieces.[996] After crossing the river, the prince\r\nturned to the left, and marched towards Jedburgh, where he arrived in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nAs his next route lay through a dreary waste of considerable extent,\r\nhe halted at Jedburgh for the night, to refresh his men, and departed\r\nearly next morning. Marching up Rule water, Charles led his men into\r\nLiddisdale over the _Knot o’ the Gate_, and after a fatiguing march\r\nof about twenty-five miles, arrived at Haggiehaugh upon Liddel water,\r\nwhere he slept. Charles marched down Liddel water on the following\r\nday, being Friday the 8th of November, and entered England in the\r\nevening. When crossing the border, the Highlanders drew their swords,\r\nand gave a hearty huzza; but a damp came over their spirits, on\r\nlearning that Lochiel had cut his hand in the act of unsheathing his\r\nsword, an occurrence which the Highlanders superstitiously regarded\r\nas a bad omen.[997] Charles lay at Reddings in Cumberland that\r\nnight. The division belonging to the prince’s column, consisting\r\nof horse, which had taken the middle route by Hawick and Langholm,\r\nreached Longtown the same day.\r\n\r\nWhile the eastern division was thus moving in a circuitous direction\r\nto the appointed place of rendezvous near Carlisle, the western\r\ncolumn, which started on the road to Peebles, was following a more\r\ndirect route, by Moffat and down Annandale. This division entered\r\nEngland near Longtown. On the 9th of November, Charles marched with\r\nhis division to Rowcliff, four miles below Carlisle, where he crossed\r\nthe river Eden, and quartered his men in the villages on the west\r\nside of the city. In the afternoon, Charles was joined by the greater\r\npart of the other division, under the Marquis of Tullibardine. This\r\nmarch was judiciously planned, and was executed with such precision,\r\nthat scarcely two hours elapsed between the arrival of the two main\r\ndivisions at the appointed place of rendezvous. The march, according\r\nto the Chevalier Johnstone, resembled on a small scale that of\r\nMarshal Saxe, a few years before, when he advanced to lay siege to\r\nMaestricht.\r\n\r\nThe plan for deceiving Marshal Wade succeeded so well, that that\r\ncommander, who had now an army of 11,000 men under him, had no idea\r\nthat the Highland army was marching on Carlisle, and accordingly\r\ndirected his whole attention to the protection of Newcastle. Such was\r\nthe secrecy with which the motions of the army were conducted, that,\r\nwith the exception of Charles and his principal officers, no person\r\nknew its real destination.[998] On arriving in the neighbourhood of\r\nCarlisle, desertion had diminished the prince’s army by some hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe city of Carlisle, the capital of Cumberland, had formerly been\r\na place of great strength, and had, during the wars between England\r\nand Scotland, been considered one of the keys of England on the side\r\nof the latter; but since the union of the crowns, its fortifications\r\nhad been allowed to fall into decay. It was surrounded by walls\r\nflanked with towers, and a fosse or ditch. The city was protected\r\nby a castle on the north-west, supposed to be as old as the time of\r\nWilliam Rufus, and by a citadel on the south-east, erected in the\r\nreign of Henry the Eighth. The castle, on the present occasion, was\r\nwell furnished with artillery, and was garrisoned by a company of\r\ninvalids; but, like the city, its fortifications were not in good\r\nrepair. To aid the inhabitants in defending the city, the whole\r\nmilitia of Cumberland and Westmoreland had been assembled within its\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nWhen approaching the city on the 9th, a party of the prince’s horse\r\nadvanced to Stanwix Bank, a small hill near Carlisle, to reconnoitre;\r\nbut they were forced to retire by a few shots from the castle.\r\nThe whole of the army having passed the Eden next day, Charles\r\nproceeded to invest the city on all sides. One of his parties, in\r\nmarching round from the Irish to the English gate, was fired upon\r\nboth from the castle and the town, but did not sustain any loss.\r\nHaving completed the investment, the prince, about noon, sent a\r\nletter to the mayor of the city, requiring him to open its gates, and\r\nallow the army to enter in a peaceable manner; promising, in case\r\nof compliance, to protect the city from insult, but threatening an\r\nassault in the event of a refusal. The prince stated, that should an\r\nassault be made, he might not have it in his power to prevent the\r\ndreadful consequences which usually befall a city captured in that\r\nway. An answer was required within two hours, but none was given, and\r\na discharge of cannon from the besieged announced their determination\r\nto hold out. In consequence of this reception, the trenches were\r\nopened at night, under the orders of the Duke of Perth, at the\r\ndistance of eighty yards from the walls. Mr. Grant, an Irish officer,\r\nof Lally’s regiment, who had lately arrived from France, and who\r\nwas an experienced engineer, ably availing himself of some ditches,\r\napproached close to the city without suffering from the fire of the\r\nbesieged. The artillery consisted of six Swedish field pieces, which\r\nhad been received from France, and of the pieces which had been taken\r\nat Preston.[999]\r\n\r\nHaving received intelligence that Marshal Wade was advancing from\r\nNewcastle to relieve Carlisle, and that he had already arrived at\r\nHexham, Charles resolved to meet him on some of the hilly grounds\r\nbetween Newcastle and Carlisle. Leaving, therefore, a sufficient\r\nforce to blockade Carlisle, he departed with the remainder of the\r\narmy on the morning of the 11th, and reached Warwick castle about ten\r\no’clock. He then despatched Colonel Ker with a party of horse, in the\r\ndirection of Hexham, to reconnoitre, and ordered his men to take up\r\ntheir quarters for the night. Ker having ascertained that the news of\r\nWade’s march was false, returned to Brampton, and made his report.\r\nAfter waiting two days at Brampton without hearing any thing of Wade,\r\na council of war was held, at which several opinions were offered.\r\nOne opinion, in which Charles concurred, was that the army should\r\nadvance to Newcastle, and give battle to Wade. Some of the council\r\nthought that this would be a dangerous step; for even were they to\r\ndefeat the marshal, his army might take refuge in Newcastle, which\r\nit was vain for them to think of taking, as, besides the strength of\r\nthe place, the army had lost many men upon its march. Others were for\r\nreturning to Scotland till joined by a greater body of their friends;\r\nbut Lord George Murray opposed all these views, and proposed, that\r\nwhile one part of the party should besiege and blockade Carlisle,\r\nthe other should remain at Brampton. The Duke of Perth seconded this\r\nopinion, and offered to undertake the charge of the battery, if Lord\r\nGeorge would take the command of the blockade. The council having all\r\nagreed to Lord George’s proposal, six of the Lowland regiments were\r\nsent to blockade the town, besides the Duke of Perth’s, which was to\r\nbe employed on the battery.[1000]\r\n\r\nWhilst the main body of the army was at Brampton, the party left\r\nbefore the city occupied themselves in cutting down wood in Corby\r\nand Warwick parks, with which they made scaling-ladders, fascines,\r\nand carriages. On the 13th, about noon, the regiments appointed\r\nfor the blockade and siege of the city re-appeared before it. Lord\r\nGeorge Murray took up his quarters at Harbery, and posted his men in\r\nthe villages around the city to stop all communication with it. The\r\nbesieging party broke ground in the evening within musket-shot of the\r\nwalls, about half-way between the English and Scotch gates.[1001] A\r\nconstant firing was kept up from the city; but as these operations\r\nwere carried on under cloud of night, the party in the trenches\r\nreceived no injury. Having completed their battery, the besiegers\r\nbrought up their whole cannon, consisting of thirteen pieces, to play\r\nupon the town. Next morning the fire from the garrison was renewed,\r\nbut with little effect, and the besiegers, instead of returning\r\nthe fire, held up their bonnets on the end of their spades in\r\nderision.[1002]\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the preparations of the Highlanders, and the state of\r\naffairs within the city, a meeting of the inhabitants was held, at\r\nwhich it was resolved to surrender the town. For seven days the\r\ngarrison of the city, kept in constant alarm by the Highlanders, had\r\nscarcely enjoyed an hour’s continued repose; and while many of the\r\nmen had, from illness, absolutely refused to assist any longer in the\r\ndefence of the city, numbers were hourly leaving it clandestinely\r\nby slipping over the walls; so that in several cases the officers\r\nof some companies had not more than three or four men left. In this\r\nstate of matters the only alternative was a surrender; and as a\r\ncrisis appeared to be at hand, a white flag was exhibited from the\r\nwalls, and a messenger despatched to the Duke of Perth to request\r\nterms. His Grace sent an express to Brampton to know the prince’s\r\npleasure; but his Royal Highness refused to grant any terms to the\r\ncity unless the castle surrendered at the same time. At the request\r\nof the mayor, a cessation of arms was granted till next day; but\r\nbefore the time expired, Colonel Durand, the commander of the castle,\r\nagreed to surrender the fortress along with the town. The conditions\r\nwere, that the liberties and properties of the inhabitants, and all\r\nthe privileges of the town, should be preserved inviolate;--that\r\nboth garrisons, on taking an oath not to serve against the house of\r\nStuart for one year, should be allowed to retire,--and that all the\r\narms and ammunition in the castle and the city, and all the horses\r\nbelonging to the militia, should be delivered up to the prince. This\r\ncapitulation was signed by the Duke of Perth and Colonel Durand on\r\nthe night of the 14th.[1003]\r\n\r\nNext morning at ten o’clock the Duke of Perth entered the city at\r\nthe head of his regiment, and was followed by the other regiments\r\nat one o’clock in the afternoon. The castle, however, was not given\r\nup till next morning. The Duke of Perth shook hands with the men of\r\nthe garrison, told them they were brave fellows, and offered them a\r\nlarge bounty to enlist in the service of the prince.[1004] The mayor\r\nand his attendants went to Brampton, and delivered the keys of the\r\ncity to the prince.[1005] The duke found 1,000 stand of arms in the\r\ncastle, besides those of the militia. He also found 200 good horses\r\nin the city, and a large quantity of valuable effects in the castle,\r\nwhich had been lodged there by the gentry of the neighbourhood for\r\nsafety.[1006]\r\n\r\nOn the day following the surrender, the Chevalier de St. George was\r\nproclaimed in the city with the usual formalities; and, to give\r\ngreater eclat to the ceremony, the mayor and aldermen were compelled\r\nto attend with the sword and mace carried before them. Along with the\r\nmanifestoes formerly noticed, another declaration for England, dated\r\nfrom Rome, 23d December, 1743, was also read, of much the same tenor\r\nas the others.\r\n\r\nAfter the Chevalier had been proclaimed, and the different\r\nmanifestoes read, the corporation went out to meet the prince, who\r\nentered the city under a general salute of artillery.[1007]\r\n\r\nIn many points of view the capture of Carlisle would have been of\r\ngreat importance to the prince, if he had been strong enough to\r\nhave availed himself of the state of terror which that event, and\r\nhis subsequent advance into the very heart of England, had thrown\r\nthe people of that kingdom; but his means were soon found quite\r\ninadequate to accomplish his end. Even if his resources had been much\r\ngreater than ever they were, it seems doubtful whether the jealousies\r\nand dissensions, which, at an early period, began to distract his\r\ncouncils, would not have rendered all his exertions, for obtaining\r\nthe great object of his ambition, unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe _origo mali_, the source of the discord, and all the misfortunes,\r\nas the Jacobites would say, that flowed from it, are attributed by\r\nan individual[1008] who had good opportunities of judging, and\r\nwhose narrative appears to be impartial, to “the unbounded ambition\r\nof Secretary Murray, who from the beginning aimed at nothing less\r\nthan the whole direction and management of every thing. To this\r\npassion he sacrificed what chance there was of a restoration, though\r\nthat was the foundation on which all his hopes were built. He had\r\nan opportunity of securing the prince’s favour long enough before\r\nhe could be rivalled. He was almost the only personal acquaintance\r\nthe prince found in Scotland. It was he that had engaged the prince\r\nto make this attempt upon so slight a foundation, and the wonderful\r\nsuccess that had hitherto attended it was placed to his account. The\r\nDuke of Perth, whose character indeed was well known to the prince,\r\njudging of Murray’s heart by his own, entertained the highest opinion\r\nof his integrity, went readily into all his schemes, and confirmed\r\nthe prince in the esteem he had already conceived for Murray. After\r\nMr. Kelly was gone, there was only Sir Thomas Sheridan and Mr.\r\nSullivan, of those that had come along with the prince that had any\r\nthing to say with him, and these Murray had gained entirely. Lord\r\nGeorge Murray was the man the secretary dreaded most as a rival. Lord\r\nGeorge’s birth, age, capacity, and experience, would naturally give\r\nhim great advantage over the secretary; but the secretary had got the\r\nstart of him, and was determined to stick at nothing to maintain his\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“He began by representing Lord George as a traitor to the prince.\r\nHe assured him that he had joined on purpose to have an opportunity\r\nof delivering him up to the government. It was hardly possible to\r\nguard against this imposture. The prince had the highest opinion of\r\nhis secretary’s integrity, and knew little of Lord George Murray, so\r\nthe calumny had its full effect. Lord George soon came to know the\r\nsuspicion the prince had of him, and was affected as one may easily\r\nenough imagine. To be sure, nothing could be more shocking to a man\r\nof honour, and one that was now for the third time venturing his life\r\nand fortune for the royal cause. The prince was partly undeceived by\r\nLord George’s gallant behaviour at the battle [of Preston], and had\r\nLord George improved that opportunity he might have perhaps gained\r\nthe prince’s favour, and got the better of the secretary; but his\r\nhaughty and overbearing manner prevented a thorough reconciliation,\r\nand seconded the malice and malicious insinuations of his rival.\r\nLord George did not altogether neglect making his court. Upon some\r\noccasions he was very obsequious and respectful, but had not temper\r\nto go through with it. He now and then broke out into such violent\r\nsallies, as the prince could not digest, though the situation of his\r\naffairs forced him to bear with them.\r\n\r\n“The secretary’s station and favour had attached to him such as\r\nwere confident of success, and had nothing in view but making\r\ntheir fortunes. Nevertheless, Lord George had greater weight and\r\ninfluence in the council, and generally brought the majority over\r\nto his opinion, which so irritated the ambitious secretary, that he\r\nendeavoured all he could to give the prince a bad impression of the\r\ncouncil itself, and engaged to lay it entirely aside. He had like\r\nto have prevailed at Carlisle, but the council was soon resumed,\r\nand continued ever after to be held upon extraordinary emergencies.\r\nIt was not in this particular only that Murray’s ambition was\r\ndetrimental to the prince’s affairs. Though he was more jealous of\r\nLord George Murray than of any body, Lord George was not the only\r\nperson he dreaded as a rival. There were abundance of gentlemen in\r\nthe army, in no respect inferior to Mr. Murray, but his early favour\r\ngave him an opportunity of excluding most of them from the prince’s\r\npresence and acquaintance. All those gentlemen that joined the prince\r\nafter Murray were made known under the character he thought fit to\r\ngive of them, and all employments about the prince’s person, and\r\nmany in the army, were of his nomination. These he filled with such\r\nas, he had reason to think, would never thwart his measures, but be\r\ncontent to be his tools and creatures without aspiring higher. Thus\r\nsome places of the greatest trust and importance were given to little\r\ninsignificant fellows, while there were abundance of gentlemen of\r\nfigure and merit, that had no employment at all, and who might have\r\nbeen of great use had they been properly employed.”[1009]\r\n\r\nTill the siege of Carlisle, Secretary Murray had been able to\r\ndisguise his jealousy of Lord George Murray, who, from his high\r\nmilitary attainments, had been able hitherto to rule the council;\r\nbut, on that occasion, the secretary displayed his hostility openly,\r\nand Lord George thereupon resigned his command as one of the\r\nlieutenant-generals of the army. The circumstances which led to the\r\nresignation of Lord George were these. It appears that, before the\r\nblockading party left Brampton, he desired Charles to give him some\r\nidea of the terms his royal highness would accept of from Carlisle,\r\nnot with the view of obtaining powers to conclude a capitulation, but\r\nmerely to enable him to adjust the terms according to the prince’s\r\nintentions, and thereby save a great deal of time. Charles not being\r\nable to come to any resolution before Lord George’s departure, his\r\nlordship begged of him to send his instructions after him, that\r\nhe might know how to conduct himself in the event of an offer of\r\nsurrender by the city; but the secretary interposed, and told Lord\r\nGeorge plainly, that he considered the terms of capitulation as a\r\nmatter within his province, and with which Lord George had no right\r\nto interfere.[1010] Lord George has not communicated the answer\r\nhe gave to Murray on this occasion. The part of the army destined\r\nfor the blockade, though willing to take their turn along with the\r\nrest of the army, was averse to bear the whole burden of it. Their\r\ncommander was aware of this feeling, and, in a letter written to\r\nhis brother, the Marquis of Tullibardine, from his head-quarters at\r\nHarbery, on the 14th of November, proposed a plan which he thought\r\nwould satisfy both parties. After alluding to the indefatigable\r\nexertions of the Duke of Perth, who had himself wrought in the\r\ntrenches to encourage his men to erect the battery, and the great\r\ndifficulties he had to encounter from the nature of the ground, Lord\r\nGeorge requested the marquis to represent to the prince, that the\r\nmen engaged on the blockade would not expose themselves either in\r\ntrenches or in the open air within cannon shot, or even within musket\r\nshot of the town, but by turns with the rest of the army; and he\r\nproposed that it should be decided by lot who should mount guard the\r\nfirst night, second night, and so on. To carry the views of his men\r\ninto effect, Lord George proposed the following plan, subject to the\r\napproval of a council of war, viz., that 50 men should be draughted\r\nout of each of the battalions that remained at Brampton, with proper\r\nofficers, and at least two majors out of the six battalions; and that\r\nthese should be sent to Butcherly, within a mile of the battery; and\r\nthat as 150 men might be a sufficient guard for the battery, the\r\nsix battalions would in this way furnish two guards, in addition to\r\nwhich, he proposed that two additional guards should he draughted,\r\none from the Athole brigade, and the other from General Gordon’s\r\nand Lord Ogilvy’s regiments; and, by the time these four guards had\r\nserved in rotation, he reckoned that the city would be taken, or\r\nthe blockade removed. A council of war was held at Brampton upon\r\nthis proposal, which came to the resolution, that as soon as the\r\nwhole body forming the blockade had taken their turn as guards,\r\nthe division of the army at Brampton should occupy its place, and\r\nform the blockade, but that no detachments should be sent from the\r\ndifferent corps; nor did the council think it fair to order any such,\r\nas these corps had had all the fatigue and danger of the blockade of\r\nEdinburgh.[1011]\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances which preceded the resignation of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, who, in a letter to Prince Charles dated the 15th\r\nof November, threw up his commission, assigning as his reason the\r\nlittle weight which his advice, as a general officer, had with his\r\nroyal highness. He, however, stated, that as he had ever had a firm\r\nattachment to the house of Stuart, “and in particular to the king,”\r\nhe would serve as a volunteer, and that it was his design to be that\r\nnight in the trenches. In a letter, which he wrote the same day\r\nto the Marquis of Tullibardine, he stated that he was constantly\r\nat a loss to know what was going on in the army, and that he was\r\ndetermined never again to act as an officer; but that as a volunteer,\r\nhe would show that no man wished better to the cause, and that he\r\nwould do all in his power to advance the service. At the request of\r\nthe marquis, who informed Lord George that Charles wished to see him,\r\nLord George waited upon the prince, who appears to have received him\r\ndryly. On being informed by Lord George, that he had attended in\r\nconsequence of a message from the prince, Charles denied that he had\r\nrequired his attendance, and told him that he had nothing particular\r\nto say to him. His lordship then repeated his offer to serve as a\r\nvolunteer. Charles told him he might do so, and here the conversation\r\nended. In a conversation which took place afterwards, between Lord\r\nGeorge and Sir Thomas Sheridan, the former entered into some details,\r\nto show that in his station, as lieutenant-general, he had had no\r\nauthority, and that others had usurped the office of general, by\r\nusing the name of the prince. He complained that, while he was\r\nemployed in the drudgery, every thing of moment was done without his\r\nknowledge or advice. He concluded by observing, that he had ventured\r\nhis all,--life, fortune, and family,--in short, every thing but his\r\nhonour,--that, as to the last, he had some to lose, but none to gain,\r\nin the way things were managed, and that, therefore, he had resolved\r\nupon serving in a humble capacity.[1012]\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no foundation for the statement[1013] that Lord\r\nGeorge resigned his commission from a dislike to serve under the Duke\r\nof Perth, whom he never mentions but with respect, although he was\r\nmuch inferior to Lord George in ability. He has also been accused of\r\narrogance both to those of his own rank and even to the prince. But\r\nas Burton[1014] well remarks, “men of ability like Murray, unless\r\nthey preserve a rigid restraint, are apt to let the contempt they\r\nfeel for the silly people they are embarked with become unreasonably\r\napparent, especially when they are interrupted in their plans by\r\nthose who do not understand them.” The Duke of Perth, who was a Roman\r\nCatholic, on its being represented to him that it might injure the\r\nprince’s cause to have at the head of the army one of his persuasion,\r\ncheerfully resigned his commission. On this, Lord George, with whose\r\nvaluable services the army could not dispense, was persuaded to\r\nassume his command. He thus became virtually general of the army,\r\nunder the prince; for his brother, Tullibardine, who was in a bad\r\nstate of health, took nothing upon him.[1015]\r\n\r\nAlthough Marshal Wade must have been duly apprised of the arrival of\r\nthe Highland army in England, yet it was not until he had received\r\nintelligence of their march to Brampton, and of their probable\r\nadvance upon Newcastle, that he began to move. He set out from\r\nNewcastle on the 16th of November, the day after the surrender of\r\nCarlisle; but a deep snow, which had just fallen, so retarded his\r\nmarch, that his army did not reach Ovington till eight o’clock that\r\nnight. Next day he advanced to Hexham, where the first column of his\r\narmy arrived about four o’clock in the afternoon; but the rear did\r\nnot get up till near midnight. The army, unable to proceed farther\r\non account of the snow, encamped on a moor near the town, and the\r\nmen were provided with a sufficient quantity of straw to repose upon\r\nby the inhabitants, who kindled large fires all over the ground to\r\nprotect the troops from the cold, which was unusually severe. At\r\nHexham, Wade was informed of the reduction of Carlisle. He remained\r\nthere three days in the expectation of a thaw; but the road to\r\nCarlisle continuing impassable, he returned to Newcastle, which he\r\nreached on the 22d of November.[1016] The conduct of Marshal Wade,\r\nin delaying his march from Newcastle, has been justly censured, for\r\nthere can be no doubt that had he made a movement in advance upon\r\nCarlisle about the time the insurgents marched to Brampton, that town\r\nwould have been saved.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and unexpected success which had attended Charles’s arms\r\nin England, spread a general alarm through all the northern and\r\nwestern parts of that kingdom, and extended even to the capital\r\nitself. Such was the alternation of hope and fear in the minds of\r\nthe people of all classes, that whilst the most trifling article of\r\ngood news led them to indulge in the most extravagant manifestations\r\nof joy, the smallest reverse of fortune plunged them into the most\r\nabject distress. Sir Andrew Mitchell, alluding to this circumstance\r\nin a letter to President Forbes, says, that if he had not lived\r\nlong enough in England to know the natural bravery of the people, he\r\nshould have formed a very false opinion of them from their demeanour\r\nat the period in question.[1017]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the surrender of Carlisle was known in\r\nLondon, the government resolved to assemble an army of 10,000 men in\r\nStaffordshire, under Sir John Ligonier, an officer of considerable\r\nmilitary experience. For this purpose, Sir John left London on the\r\n21st of November, taking along with him nine old battalions, two\r\nregiments of dragoons, and part of his own regiment of horse. In\r\naddition to this and the other army under Wade, a third army, to be\r\nplaced under the immediate command of his majesty, was ordered to be\r\nraised, and encamped in the vicinity of London for its protection.\r\nThe city and castle of Chester were put in a proper state of defence,\r\nand the town of Liverpool raised a regiment of 700 men, who were\r\nclothed and maintained at the expense of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhen mustered at Carlisle, the prince’s army amounted only to about\r\n4,500 men.[1018] The idea of marching to London and overturning the\r\ngovernment with such a force, in the face of three armies and a\r\nnumerous militia, amounting in all to upwards of 60,000 men, could\r\nscarcely have been entertained by any adventurer, however sanguine\r\nhis hopes may have been; but Charles was so full of his object, that\r\nhe shut his eyes to the great difficulties of the enterprise, which\r\nhe imagined would be surmounted by the tried valour of his troops,\r\nand the junction of a considerable party in England devoted to his\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nTo determine upon the course to be next pursued, Charles called a\r\ncouncil of war a few days after the capture of Carlisle, in which\r\ndifferent opinions were maintained. As there was no appearance of\r\neither an invasion from France, or an insurrection in England, some\r\nof the members proposed returning to Scotland, where a defensive\r\nwar could be carried on till such time as the prince should be in a\r\ncondition to resume offensive operations. Others were for remaining\r\nat Carlisle, and quartering the army in the neighbourhood till they\r\nsaw whether there should be any indications of a rising in England. A\r\nthird party proposed that they should march to Newcastle and engage\r\nWade’s army. A fourth, that the army should continue its route to\r\nLondon by the west or Lancashire road, in support of which opinion\r\nthey urged, that being now in possession of Carlisle, they had,\r\nat the worst, a safe retreat. This last proposal being quite in\r\naccordance with the prince’s own sentiments, he declared that his\r\nopinion of marching directly to London, in terms of the resolution\r\nentered into at Edinburgh, was in no respect altered since he entered\r\nEngland. Lord George Murray, who had hitherto remained silent,\r\nwas then desired by the prince to give his opinion. His lordship\r\nentered at some length into the question; stated the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of each of the different opinions; and concluded,\r\nby observing, that for himself he could not venture to advise his\r\nroyal highness to march far into England, without receiving more\r\nencouragement from the country than he had hitherto got; but he was\r\npersuaded, that if his royal highness was resolved to make a trial\r\nof what could be expected, and would march south, his army, though\r\nsmall, would follow him. After Lord George had done speaking, Charles\r\nimmediately said he would venture the trial. In giving his opinion,\r\nLord George says he spoke with the more caution, in consequence of\r\nthe recent circumstances which had led to his resignation.[1019]\r\n\r\nAs a considerable number of men had been collected at Perth since the\r\nprince’s departure from Scotland, and more were on their way thither\r\nfrom the north, Charles, before leaving Carlisle for the south,\r\nsent Maclauchlan of Maclauchlan to Scotland with an order to Lord\r\nStrathallan, to march with all the forces under his command, and join\r\nthe army in England; but this order was disregarded.\r\n\r\nWhilst encamped at Duddingston, the Highlanders preferred sleeping\r\nin the open air, and had with difficulty been prevailed upon to use\r\nthe tents which had been captured at Preston and those provided at\r\nEdinburgh. These tents were packed up for the campaign in England:\r\nbut the party, to whose care they were intrusted, most unaccountably\r\nleft the whole of them at Lockerby along with other baggage. The\r\nwhole, consisting of thirty cart-loads, were captured by a party of\r\ncountry people, who carried them to Dumfries. After the surrender of\r\nCarlisle, Lochiel went with a party to reclaim the baggage, failing\r\nwhich, he was ordered to exact £2,000 from the town; but before he\r\nreached Dumfries he was recalled. The army, therefore, being now\r\nwithout tents, and the season very severe, it was resolved so to\r\narrange the order of march as to get the men accommodated in the\r\ntowns. For this purpose, it was determined that one part of the army\r\nshould precede the other by a day’s march, the second division always\r\noccupying the quarters vacated by the first; but that, where the\r\ncountry would admit of it, there should be only half-a-day’s march\r\nbetwixt them.[1020]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this plan, the first division, commanded by\r\nLord George Murray, left Carlisle on the 20th of November. It\r\nconsisted, with the exception of the Duke of Perth’s regiment, which\r\nbeing appointed to guard the thirteen cannon and ammunition, was\r\nnot included in either division, of the whole of the low country\r\nregiments,[1021] six in number, with the life-guards under Lord\r\nElcho, who marched at the head of the division. Each of these\r\nregiments led the van in its turn. This division reached Penrith the\r\nsame day, having performed a march of eighteen miles. The second\r\ndivision, consisting of the clan regiments and the remainder of the\r\ncavalry, headed by the prince in person, left Carlisle next day, and\r\narrived at Penrith that night, and entered the quarters occupied by\r\nthe first division, which marched the same day to Shap, where it\r\npassed the night.[1022] In the march of the prince’s division the\r\ncavalry always marched at its head, and each of the clan regiments\r\nled the van by turns, agreeably to the plan observed by the division\r\nunder Lord George Murray. A garrison of about 200 men was left\r\nin Carlisle under the command of one Hamilton, who had been made\r\ndeputy-governor under the Duke of Perth, on whom the governorship had\r\nbeen conferred.[1023]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Penrith, Charles, for the first time, heard of the march\r\nof Wade from Newcastle, and of his arrival at Hexham. Resolved to\r\nreturn to Carlisle and give battle to Wade, should he advance upon\r\nthat city, Charles remained all the next day at Penrith, waiting\r\nfor further intelligence of the marshal’s movements; but receiving\r\ninformation from Lord Kilmarnock, who still remained with his\r\nhorse at Brampton, that the English general was on his way back to\r\nNewcastle, Charles marched to Kendal on the 23d. The van of the\r\narmy, which had arrived at Kendal on the previous day, marched on\r\nthe 23d to Lancaster, where it halted for the night. The prince\r\nresumed his march on the 25th, and reached Lancaster, on which day\r\nthe first division went to Garstang. On the 26th the whole army\r\nreached Preston, where it halted till the 27th. Recollecting the\r\nfate of the Highland army at Preston in 1715, the Highlanders had\r\nbecome possessed of the idea that they would never get beyond that\r\ntown; but Lord George Murray, on being informed of it, dispelled\r\nthis superstitious dread by crossing the bridge over the Ribble, and\r\nquartering a considerable number of his men on the other side of that\r\nriver.[1024]\r\n\r\nDuring his progress to Preston, Charles received no marks of\r\nattachment from the inhabitants of the towns and country through\r\nwhich he passed; but at Preston his arrival was hailed with\r\nacclamations and the ringing of bells. With the exception, however,\r\nof Mr. Townley, a Catholic gentleman who had been in the French\r\nservice, and two or three other gentlemen, no person of any note\r\njoined him. By dint of entreaty a few recruits were indeed raised;\r\nbut it was not with such levies that Charles could expect to\r\nstrengthen his army. At Preston Charles held a council of war, at\r\nwhich he repeated the assurances he alleged he had received from\r\nhis English partisans, and gave fresh hopes of being joined by them\r\non their arrival at Manchester. The Highland chiefs were prevailed\r\nupon to continue their march. Lord George Murray proposed to march\r\nwith his column to Liverpool, and to join the other division at\r\nMacclesfield; but this proposal was overruled.[1025]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 28th, the Highland army left Preston and marched\r\nto Wigan,[1026] where they passed the night. Next day the whole army\r\nentered Manchester, amid the acclamations of the inhabitants, who\r\nilluminated their houses, and lighted up bonfires in the evening, to\r\nexpress their joy. The same evening one Dickson, a sergeant, enlisted\r\nby the Chevalier Johnstone, from the prisoners taken at Preston,\r\npresented 180 recruits whom he had raised in the course of the day\r\nin Manchester. This young Scotsman, whom the Chevalier represents\r\nto have been “as brave and intrepid as a lion,” disappointed at\r\nhis own ill success in raising recruits at Preston, had requested\r\npermission from Johnstone, in whose company he was, to proceed to\r\nManchester--a day’s march before the army--to make sure of some\r\nrecruits before it should arrive there. The Chevalier reproved him\r\nsharply for entertaining so wild and extravagant a project, which\r\nwould expose him to the danger of being taken and hanged, and ordered\r\nhim back to his company; but Dickson, reckless of consequences,\r\nquitted Preston on the evening of the 28th, with his mistress and a\r\ndrummer, and travelling all night, entered Manchester next morning,\r\nand immediately began to beat up for recruits for “The Yellow Haired\r\nLaddie.” Conceiving that the Highland army was at hand, the populace\r\nat first did not interrupt him; but when they ascertained that the\r\narmy would not arrive till the evening, they surrounded him in a\r\ntumultuous manner, with the intention of taking him prisoner dead\r\nor alive. Dickson presented his blunderbuss, charged with slugs,\r\nthreatened to blow out the brains of those who first dared to lay\r\nhands on himself or the two who accompanied him; and by turning\r\nround continually, facing in all directions, and behaving like a\r\nlion, he soon enlarged the circle which a crowd of people had formed\r\naround him. Having contrived for some time to manœuvre in this way,\r\nthose of the inhabitants of Manchester, who were attached to the\r\nhouse of Stuart, took arms, and flew to the assistance of Dickson,\r\nto rescue him from the fury of the mob; so that he had soon 500 or\r\n600 men to aid him, who dispersed the crowd in a very short time.\r\nDickson now triumphed in his turn; and putting himself at the head\r\nof his followers, he proudly paraded undisturbed the whole day with\r\nhis drummer, enlisting all who offered themselves. That evening,\r\non presenting his recruits, it was found that the whole amount of\r\nhis expenses did not exceed three guineas. This adventure gave rise\r\nto many a joke, at the expense of the town of Manchester, from the\r\nsingular circumstance of its having been taken by a sergeant, a\r\ndrummer, and a girl.[1027]\r\n\r\nThe van of the prince’s army, consisting of 100 horse, entered\r\nManchester on the evening of the 28th of November, and, to magnify\r\ntheir numbers, ordered quarters to be prepared for 10,000 men.\r\nAnother party of cavalry entered the town at ten o’clock next\r\nmorning, and about two o’clock in the afternoon, Charles himself,\r\naccompanied by the main body, marched in on foot, surrounded by a\r\nselect body of the clans. He wore on this occasion a light tartan\r\nplaid belted with a blue sash, a grey wig, and a blue velvet bonnet\r\nwith silver lace, having a white rose in the centre of the top, by\r\nwhich latter badge he was distinguished from his general officers,\r\nwho wore their cockades on one side.[1028] Here, as in all the other\r\ntowns through which the Highlanders had passed, the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge was proclaimed. The bells of the town were rung, and in the\r\nevening an illumination was made and bonfires lighted, by order of\r\nthe prince, who also issued a proclamation requiring all persons,\r\nwho had public money in their hands, to pay it into his treasury.\r\nThe army halted a day at Manchester and beat up for recruits. They\r\nwere joined by some young men of the most respectable families in the\r\ntown, by several substantial tradesmen and farmers, and by upwards\r\nof 100 common men. These, with the recruits raised by Dickson, were\r\nformed into a corps called the Manchester regiment, the command of\r\nwhich was given to Mr. Townley, on whom the rank of Colonel was\r\nconferred. This regiment never exceeded 300 men, and were all the\r\nEnglish who ever openly declared for the prince.[1029]\r\n\r\nThough Charles’s reception at Manchester had been rather flattering,\r\nyet the countenance he received was not such as to encourage him\r\nto proceed, and a retreat now began to be talked of. One of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray’s friends ventured to hint to him that he thought\r\nthey had advanced far enough, as neither of the events they had\r\nanticipated, of an insurrection in England, or a landing from France,\r\nwere likely to take place. Lord George, who, it is understood, had\r\nalways a retreat in view, if not supported by a party in England or\r\nby succours from abroad, said that they might make a farther trial\r\nby going as far as Derby, but that if they did not receive greater\r\nencouragement than they had yet met with, he would propose a retreat\r\nto the prince.\r\n\r\nConceiving that it was the intention of Charles to march by Chester\r\ninto Wales, the bridges over the Mersey, on the road to Chester, had\r\nbeen broken down by order of the authorities; but this precaution\r\nwas quite unnecessary. After halting a day at Manchester the army\r\nproceeded to Macclesfield on the morning of the 1st of December, in\r\ntwo divisions. One took the road to Stockport, and the other that\r\nto Knottesford. The bridge near Stockport having been broken down,\r\nCharles crossed the river up to his middle in water. At Knottesford\r\nthe other division crossed the river over temporary bridges, made\r\nchiefly out of poplar trees laid length-ways with planks across.\r\nThe horse and artillery crossed at Chedle-ford. In the evening both\r\ndivisions joined at Macclesfield, where they passed the night.[1030]\r\n\r\nAt Macclesfield Charles received intelligence that the army of\r\nLigonier, of which the Duke of Cumberland had taken the chief\r\ncommand, was on its march, and was quartered at Lichfield, Coventry,\r\nStafford, and Newcastle-under-Lyme. The prince resolved to march\r\nfor Derby. To conceal their intentions from the enemy, Lord George\r\nMurray offered to go with a division of the army to Congleton, which\r\nlay on the direct road to Lichfield, by which movement he expected\r\nthat the duke would collect his army in a body at Lichfield, and\r\nthereby leave the road to Derby open.[1031] This proposal having been\r\nagreed to, Lord George went next day with his division to Congleton,\r\nwhence he despatched Colonel Ker at night with a party towards\r\nNewcastle-under-Lyme, whither the Duke of Kingston had retired with\r\nhis horse, on the approach of the Highlanders, to get intelligence of\r\nthe enemy. Ker came to a village within three miles of Newcastle, and\r\nhad almost surprised a party of dragoons, and succeeded in seizing\r\none Weir, a noted spy, who had been at Edinburgh all the time the\r\nprince was there, and who had kept hovering about the army during its\r\nmarch to give intelligence of its motions.[1032] The main body of\r\nthe royal army, which was posted at Newcastle-under-Lyme, on hearing\r\nof the march of the division of the Highland army upon Congleton,\r\nretreated towards Lichfield, and other bodies that were beyond\r\nNewcastle advanced for the purpose of concentrating near that town,\r\nby which movements the design of Lord George Murray was completely\r\nanswered. Having thus succeeded in deceiving the duke, Lord George\r\nMurray, after passing the night at Congleton, went off early next\r\nmorning with his division, and turning to the left, passed through\r\nLeek, and arrived at Ashbourne in the evening. Charles, who had\r\nhalted a day at Macclesfield, took the road to Derby by Gawsworth,\r\nand entered Leek shortly after the other division had left it. He\r\nwould have remained there till next morning; but as he considered it\r\nunsafe to keep his army divided at such a short distance from the\r\nroyal forces, who might fall upon either division, he set out from\r\nLeek about midnight, and joined the other column at Ashbourne early\r\nin the morning.[1033] The Duke of Devonshire, who had been posted\r\nin the town of Derby, with a body of 700 militia, on hearing of\r\nthe approach of the Highland army had retired from the town on the\r\npreceding evening.[1034]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December Charles put the first division of his army\r\nin motion, and at eleven o’clock in the forenoon his van-guard,\r\nconsisting of thirty horse, entered Derby and ordered quarters for\r\n9,000 men. About three o’clock in the afternoon Lord Elcho arrived\r\nwith the life-guards and some of the principal officers on horseback.\r\nThese were followed, in the course of the evening, by the main body,\r\nwhich entered in detached parties to make the army appear as numerous\r\nas represented. Charles himself did not arrive till the dusk of the\r\nevening; he entered the town on foot, and took up his quarters in\r\na house belonging to the Earl of Exeter. During the day the bells\r\nwere rung, and bonfires were lighted at night. The magistrates were\r\nordered to attend in the market-place, in their gowns, to hear the\r\nusual proclamations read; but having stated that they had sent their\r\ngowns out of town, their attendance was dispensed with, and the\r\nproclamations were made by the common crier.[1035]\r\n\r\nThe fate of the empire and his own destiny may be said to have now\r\ndepended upon the next resolution which Charles was to take. He\r\nhad, after a most triumphant career, approached within 127 miles\r\nof London, and there seemed to be only another step necessary to\r\ncomplete the chivalrous character of his adventure, and to bring\r\nhis enterprise to a successful termination. This was, to have\r\ninstantly adopted the bold and decisive measure of marching upon and\r\nendeavouring to seize the capital. The possession of the metropolis,\r\nwhere Charles had a considerable party, would have at once paralysed\r\nthe government; and the English Jacobites, no longer afraid of openly\r\ncommitting themselves, would have rallied round his standard. The\r\nconsternation which prevailed in London when the news of the arrival\r\nof the Highland army at Derby reached that capital, precludes the\r\nidea that any effectual resistance would have been offered on the\r\npart of the citizens; and it was the general opinion, that if Charles\r\nhad succeeded in beating the Duke of Cumberland, the army which\r\nhad assembled on Finchley Common would have dispersed of its own\r\naccord.[1036] Alluding, in a number of the _True Patriot_, to the\r\ndismay which pervaded the minds of the citizens of London, Fielding\r\nsays, that when the Highlanders, by “a most incredible march,” got\r\nbetween the Duke of Cumberland’s army and the metropolis, they struck\r\na terror into it, “scarce to be credited.” The Chevalier Johnstone,\r\nwho collected information on the spot shortly after the battle of\r\nCulloden, says, that when the intelligence of the capture of Derby\r\nreached London, many of the inhabitants fled to the country, carrying\r\nalong with them their most valuable effects, and that all the shops\r\nwere shut,--that there was a prodigious run upon the bank, which\r\nonly escaped bankruptcy by a stratagem,--that although payment was\r\nnot refused, the bank, in fact, retained its specie, by keeping it\r\ncontinually surrounded by agents of its own with notes, who, to gain\r\ntime, were paid in sixpences; and as a regulation had been made, that\r\nthe persons who came first should be entitled to priority of payment;\r\nand as the agents went out by one door with the specie they had\r\nreceived, and brought it back by another, the _bona fide_ holders of\r\nnotes could never get near enough to present them;--that King George\r\nhad ordered his yachts--on board of which he had put all his most\r\nprecious effects--to remain at the Tower stairs in readiness to sail\r\nat a moment’s warning,--and that the Duke of Newcastle, secretary\r\nof state for the war department, had shut himself up in his house a\r\nwhole day,[1037] deliberating with himself upon the part it would be\r\nmost prudent for him to take, doubtful even whether he should not\r\nimmediately declare for the prince.[1038]\r\n\r\nThe only obstacle to Charles’s march upon the capital was the army\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland, which was within a day’s march of Derby.\r\nFrom the relative position of the two armies, the Highlanders\r\nmight, with their accustomed rapidity, have outstripped the duke’s\r\narmy, and reached the capital at least one day before it; but to\r\nCharles it seemed unwise to leave such an army, almost double his\r\nown in point of numbers, in his rear, whilst that of Wade’s would\r\nadvance upon his left flank. Of the result of an encounter with\r\nCumberland, Charles entertained the most sanguine hopes. His army\r\nwas small, when compared to that of his antagonist; but the paucity\r\nof its numbers was fully compensated by the personal bravery of its\r\ncomponent parts, and the enthusiastic ardour which pervaded the\r\nbosom of every clansman. At no former stage of the campaign were\r\nthe Highlanders in better spirits than on their arrival at Derby.\r\nThey are represented by the Chevalier Johnstone as animated to the\r\nhighest pitch of enthusiasm, breathing nothing but a desire for the\r\ncombat; and were to be seen during the whole day waiting in crowds\r\nbefore the shops of the cutlers to get their broadswords sharpened,\r\nand even quarrelling with one another for priority in whetting those\r\nfearful weapons.[1039] It was not without reason, therefore, that\r\nCharles calculated upon defeating Cumberland; and although there\r\nwas a possibility that that bold and daring adventurer or his army,\r\nand perhaps both, might perish in the attempt to seize the capital,\r\nyet the importance of the juncture, and the probability that such a\r\nfavourable opportunity of accomplishing his object might never again\r\noccur, seem to justify Charles in his design of advancing immediately\r\nupon London. However, whatever might have been the result of the\r\nadvance of the rebel army, other counsels prevailed, and Charles\r\nreluctantly yielded to the entreaties of his friends, who advised a\r\nretreat.[1040]\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the arrival of the Highland army at Derby,\r\nCharles held a council of war to deliberate upon the course to be\r\npursued. The prince, who never for a moment entertained the least\r\nidea of a retreat, and who considered his own personal safety a\r\nminor consideration, urged every argument in his power for an\r\nimmediate advance, with all the vehemence and ardour characteristic\r\nof an enterprising and fanatic mind. He said that he did not doubt,\r\nthat, as his cause was just, it would prevail,--that he could not\r\nthink of retreating after coming so far,--and that he was hopeful\r\nthere would be a defection in the enemy’s army, and that some of\r\ntheir troops would join him. Lord George Murray, however, proposed\r\na retreat, and used a variety of arguments, which appeared to him\r\nunanswerable, in support of that measure. He represented to his\r\nroyal highness and the council, that they had advanced into England\r\ndepending upon French succours, or an insurrection in that kingdom,\r\nand that they had been disappointed in both,--that the prince’s\r\narmy, by itself, was by no means a match for the troops which the\r\ngovernment had assembled,--that besides the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\narmy, which was between 7,000 and 8,000 men strong, and which was\r\nexpected that night at Stafford, Marshal Wade was coming up by hard\r\nmarches by the east road with an army of 10,000 men, and that he\r\nwas already at Ferrybridge, which was within two or three days’\r\nmarch of the Highland army,--that in addition to these two armies,\r\nthere was a third at least equal to either of them already forming\r\nin the neighbourhood of London, consisting of guards and horse,\r\nwith troops which the government would bring from the coast, where\r\nthey were quartered; so that there would be three armies of regular\r\ntroops, amounting together to about 30,000 men, which would surround\r\nthe Highland army, which was not above a sixth of that number. That,\r\nadmitting that the prince should beat Cumberland or Wade, he might,\r\nshould he lose 1,000 or 1,500 of the best of his men, be undone by\r\nsuch a victory, as the rest would be altogether unfit to engage a\r\nfresh army, which he must expect to encounter,--that, on the other\r\nhand, should the prince be defeated, it could not be supposed that\r\nhe or any of his men could escape, as the militia, who had not\r\nhitherto appeared much against the Highland army, would, upon its\r\ndefeat, possess themselves of all the roads, and the enemy’s horse\r\nwould surround them on all sides,--that as Lord John Drummond had\r\nlately landed in Scotland with his own regiment and some Irish troops\r\nfrom France, the prince would have a better chance of success by\r\nreturning to Scotland,--that the forces under Lord John Drummond\r\nand the Highlanders assembled at Perth, would, when united, form an\r\narmy almost as numerous as that under the prince,--that since the\r\ncourt of France had begun to send troops, it was to be hoped it would\r\nsend considerable succours, and as the first had landed in Scotland,\r\nit was probable the rest would follow the same route,--that if the\r\nprince was cut off, all the succours France could send would avail\r\nnothing, and “the king’s” affairs would be ruined for ever,--that the\r\nprince had no chance of beating in succession the armies opposed to\r\nhim, unless the English troops should be seized with a panic, and run\r\naway at the sight of the Highlanders, a circumstance barely possible,\r\nbut not to be depended upon,--that the whole world would blame the\r\nprince’s counsellors as rash and foolish, for venturing an attempt\r\nwhich could not succeed,--and that the prince’s person, should he\r\nescape being killed in battle, would fall into the enemy’s hands.\r\nIn fine, that nothing short of an absolute certainty of success\r\ncould justify such a rash undertaking, but that retreat, which was\r\nstill practicable, and of which Lord George offered to undertake the\r\nconduct, would give the prince a much better chance of succeeding\r\nthan a battle under such circumstances, and would do him as much\r\nhonour as a victory.[1041]\r\n\r\nCharles still persevered in his resolution, and insisted on giving\r\nbattle next morning to the Duke of Cumberland, and advancing to\r\nLondon; but the chiefs of the clans unanimously supported the views\r\nof Lord George Murray, and represented to his royal highness, that\r\nalthough they had no doubt the Highlanders could easily beat the\r\narmy of the Duke of Cumberland, though greatly superior in point of\r\nnumbers, yet such a victory could not be obtained without loss; and\r\nthat an army of 4,500 men opposed to the whole force of England,\r\ncould not admit of the smallest diminution, especially as they would\r\nsoon have to fight another battle before entering London with the\r\narmy on Finchley Common. But supposing that by some extraordinary\r\noccurrence they should arrive at the capital without losing a man,\r\nwhat a figure would such a small body of men make amidst its immense\r\npopulation? They added, that the prince ought now to perceive clearly\r\nhow little he had to expect from his English partisans, since, after\r\ntraversing all the counties reputed as to have been most attached\r\nto his family, not a single person of distinction had declared\r\nfor him.[1042] With the exception of the Duke of Perth, who, from\r\ndeference to the prince, concurred in his opinion, all the persons\r\npresent were for a retreat; the duke himself at last also declaring\r\nfor that measure.[1043]\r\n\r\nFinding his council resolved upon a retreat, Charles proposed\r\nmarching into Wales instead of returning to Carlisle; but this\r\nproposal was also opposed by all present. His royal highness at last\r\nreluctantly yielded to the opinion of his council. In conducting the\r\nretreat, Lord George Murray offered to remain always in the rear\r\nhimself, and proposed that each regiment should take it by turns\r\ntill the army reached Carlisle; and that it should march in such\r\norder, that if Lord George was attacked he might be supported as\r\noccasion required, and without stopping the army unless assailed by\r\na great body of the enemy. He also stipulated that the cannon and\r\ncarriages, with the ammunition, should be placed in the van, and that\r\nhe should not be troubled with the charge of them.[1044]\r\n\r\nTo prevent any unpleasant feeling on the part of the army on account\r\nof the retreat, and to conceal the intelligence of their movements\r\nas long as possible from the enemy, the council agreed to keep\r\nthe resolution to retreat secret; but it was divulged to Sir John\r\nMacdonald, an Irish gentleman, and an officer in the French service,\r\nwho had come over with the prince. In the course of the afternoon,\r\nLord George Murray, Keppoch, and Lochiel, while walking together,\r\nwere accosted by this gentleman, who had just dined heartily, and\r\nmade free with his bottle, and were rallied by him a good deal about\r\nthe retreat. “What!” addressing Keppoch, “a Macdonald turn his\r\nback!” and turning to Lochiel, he continued, “For shame! A Cameron\r\nrun away from the enemy! Go forward, and I’ll lead you.” The two\r\nchiefs and Lord George endeavoured to persuade Sir John that he was\r\nlabouring under a mistake; but he insisted that he was right, as he\r\nhad received certain information of the retreat.[1045]\r\n\r\nDisappointed at the result of the deliberations of the council,\r\nCharles was exceedingly dejected. To raise his spirits, or\r\nto ingratiate themselves with him, some of the council, and\r\nparticularly Sir Thomas Sheridan and Secretary Murray, though they\r\nhad approved highly of the motion to retreat in the council, now\r\nvery inconsistently blamed it. They were, however, aware that the\r\nretreat would, notwithstanding their opposition, be put in execution,\r\nand to excuse themselves for agreeing to it, they alleged that they\r\ndid so, because they knew the army would never fight well when the\r\nofficers were opposed to its wishes. The prince was easily persuaded\r\nthat he had consented too readily to a retreat, but he would not\r\nretract the consent he had given unless he could bring over those\r\nto whom he had given it to his own sentiments, which he hoped he\r\nmight be able to do. With this view he called another meeting of the\r\ncouncil in the evening, and in the meantime sent for the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, who had been absent from the meeting in the morning, to\r\nask his opinion. The marquis finding the prince bent upon advancing,\r\ndeclared himself against a retreat; but after hearing the arguments\r\nof the advocates of that measure at the meeting in the evening, the\r\nmarquis retracted his opinion, and declared himself fully satisfied\r\nof its necessity. Having been informed of the conduct of those who\r\nhad tampered with the prince, the rest of the officers told him at\r\nmeeting, that they valued their lives as little as brave men ought to\r\ndo, and if he was resolved to march forward, they would do their duty\r\nto the last; but they requested, for their own satisfaction, that\r\nthose persons who had advised his royal highness to advance, would\r\ngive their opinion in writing. This proposal put an end to farther\r\ndiscussion, and Charles, finding the members of council inflexible in\r\ntheir opinion, gave way to the general sentiments.[1046]\r\n\r\nHitherto the French court had not come under any written engagement\r\nto support the enterprise of Charles; but after the news of the\r\ncapture of Edinburgh reached France, a treaty was entered into with\r\nthe French crown. By this treaty, which was signed at Fontainebleau,\r\non the 24th of October, by the Marquis D’Argenson, on the part of the\r\nFrench king, and by Colonel O’Bryen, on the part of Prince Charles,\r\nas regent of Scotland, the French king among other things agreed to\r\nfurnish the prince with a body of troops to be taken from the Irish\r\nregiments in the service of France, along with other troops, to serve\r\nunder his royal highness, to defend the provinces.\r\n\r\nLord John Drummond, who commanded a regiment in the French service,\r\nknown by the name of Royal Scots, was appointed to the command of the\r\ntroops destined for Scotland. Preparations were immediately made to\r\nfit out the expedition, and Lord John received written instructions,\r\ndated from Fontainebleau, October 28th, and signed by the French\r\nking, requiring him to repair immediately to Ostend, to superintend\r\nthe embarkation of the troops. By these instructions, Lord John was\r\ndirected to disembark the troops if possible upon the coast between\r\nEdinburgh and Berwick, and as soon as he had landed to give notice\r\nof his arrival to Prince Charles, and that the succours which he had\r\nbrought were entirely at the disposal of the orders of the prince, to\r\nwhich Lord John himself was directed to conform, either by joining\r\nhis army, or acting separately, according to the views of Charles.\r\nLord John was also instructed to notify his arrival to the commander\r\nof the Dutch troops lately arrived in England, and to intimate to\r\nhim to abstain from hostilities, agreeably to the capitulations\r\nof Tournay and Dendermonde. He was required to ask a prompt and\r\ncategorical answer as to how he meant to act without sending to the\r\nHague, as the states-general had declared to the Abbé de la Ville,\r\nthat they had given positive orders to the commanders of these troops\r\nnot to infringe the said capitulations; and if, notwithstanding\r\nsuch notification, the Dutch troops should commit acts of hostility\r\nagainst those of the King of France, his lordship was ordered to\r\nconfine closely such Dutch prisoners he might make, and to listen to\r\nno terms which would recognise a violation of the capitulations, or\r\ndispense the King of France from enforcing the engagement that had\r\nbeen entered into with the Dutch, as to the exchange of prisoners of\r\nwar.[1047]\r\n\r\nLord John Drummond accordingly proceeded to the coast, and having\r\ncompleted the embarkation of the troops, he set sail from Dunkirk\r\nabout the middle of November, carrying along with him his own\r\nregiment, a select detachment from each of the six Irish regiments in\r\nthe service of France, and Fitz-James’s regiment of horse, so called\r\nfrom the Duke of Berwick, natural son of James the Second, who had\r\nbeen their colonel. Along with these troops were embarked a train of\r\nartillery and a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition. The\r\nforces embarked amounted to about 1,000 men, but they did not all\r\nreach their destination, as some of the transports were taken by\r\nEnglish cruisers, and others were obliged to return to Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nFrom Montrose, where he arrived about the end of November, Lord\r\nJohn despatched part of his forces to Aberdeen to aid Lord Lewis\r\nGordon, and proceeded with the rest to Perth, where he established\r\nhis head-quarters. In terms of his instructions, he sent a messenger\r\nto England with a letter to Count Nassau, the commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Dutch auxiliaries, notifying his arrival, and requiring him to\r\nobserve a neutrality. He also carried letters to the commanders of\r\nthe royal forces. The bearer of these despatches, having obtained an\r\nescort of eight dragoons at Stirling, proceeded to Edinburgh, and\r\nhaving delivered a letter to General Guest, the commander of the\r\ncastle, went on to Newcastle, and delivered letters to the Count and\r\nMarshal Wade. The Marshal, however, refused to receive any message\r\n“from a person who was a subject of the king, and in rebellion\r\nagainst his majesty.” At the same time his lordship sent another\r\nmessenger with a letter to Lord Fortrose, announcing his arrival,\r\nand urging him to declare for the prince as the only mode he had of\r\nretrieving his character. To induce him to join, Lord John informed\r\nhis lordship that the prince had entered Wales, where he had about\r\n10,000 friends, and that “his royal highness, the Duke of York,”\r\naccompanied by Lord Marischal, would immediately join him at the head\r\nof 10,000 men.[1048]\r\n\r\nApprehensive that Lord John would cross the Forth above Stirling,\r\ntwo regiments of foot, and Hamilton’s and Gardiner’s dragoons, which\r\nhad arrived at Edinburgh from Berwick, on the 14th of November,\r\nbegan their march to Stirling, on the 7th of December, to guard the\r\npassages of the Forth, and were joined at Stirling by the Glasgow\r\nregiment of 600 men, commanded by the Earl of Home. Lord John\r\nDrummond, however, it appears, had no intention of crossing the Forth\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with Lord John Drummond’s expedition, the\r\nFrench ministers appear to have contemplated a descent upon England\r\nunder Lord Marischal, preparatory to which, Prince Henry repaired, by\r\ninvitation, to Paris. Twelve thousand men were to have been employed\r\nupon this expedition; but the retreat of Charles from Derby, and the\r\ndifficulty of transporting such a large force to England, seem to\r\nhave prevented its execution.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Derby, Charles had sent forward a party on the road to\r\nLondon to take possession of Swarkstone bridge, about six miles from\r\nDerby. Orders had been given to break down this bridge, but before\r\nthese orders could be put in execution, the Highlanders had possessed\r\nthemselves of it. The Duke of Cumberland, who, before this movement,\r\nhad left Stafford with the main body of his army for Stone, returned\r\nto the former place, on the 4th of December, on learning that the\r\nHighland army was at Derby. Apprehending that it was the intention\r\nof Charles to march to London, he resolved to retire towards\r\nNorthampton, in order to intercept him; but finding that the young\r\nChevalier remained at Derby, his royal highness halted, and encamped\r\non Meriden Common in the neighbourhood of Coventry.[1049]\r\n\r\nAgreeably to a resolution which had been entered into the previous\r\nevening, the Highland army began its retreat early on the morning of\r\nthe 6th of December, before daybreak. Scarcely any of the officers,\r\nwith the exception of those of the council, were aware of the\r\nresolution, and all the common men were entirely ignorant of the\r\nstep they were about to take. To have communicated such a resolution\r\nto the army all at once, would, in its present disposition,\r\nhave produced a mutiny. To keep the army in suspense as to its\r\ndestination, a quantity of powder and ball was distributed among the\r\nmen, as if they were going into action, and by some it was insinuated\r\nthat Wade was at hand, and that they were going to fight him; whilst\r\nby others it was said that the Duke of Cumberland’s army was the\r\nobject of their attack.[1050] At the idea of meeting the enemy, the\r\nHighlanders displayed the greatest cheerfulness; but as soon as they\r\ncould discriminate by daylight the objects around them, and could\r\ndiscover by an examination of the road, that they were retracing\r\ntheir steps, nothing was to be heard throughout the whole army, but\r\nexpressions of rage and lamentation. Had it sustained a defeat,\r\nthe grief of the army could not have been more acute. Even some of\r\nthose who were in the secret of the retreat, and thought it the only\r\nreasonable scheme that could be adopted, could scarcely be reconciled\r\nto it when about to be carried into effect.[1051]\r\n\r\nCharles himself partook deeply of the distress of his men. Overcome\r\nby the intensity of his feelings, he was unable for a time to proceed\r\nwith the army, and it was not until his men had been several hours on\r\ntheir march that he left Derby. Forced in spite of himself to give\r\na reluctant assent to a measure, which, whilst it rendered useless\r\nall the advantages he had obtained, rendered his chance of gaining\r\nthe great stake he was contending for extremely problematical;\r\nhis spirits sunk within him, and an air of melancholy marked his\r\nexterior. In marching forwards, he had always been first up in the\r\nmorning, put his men in motion before break of day, and had generally\r\nwalked on foot; but in the retreat, his conduct was totally changed.\r\nInstead of taking the lead, he allowed the army to start long before\r\nhe left his quarters, kept the rear always behind waiting for him,\r\nand when he came out, mounted his horse, and rode straight forward to\r\nhis next quarters with the van.[1052]\r\n\r\nAfter the first burst of indignation had in some degree subsided,\r\nand when the men began to speculate upon the reasons which could\r\nhave induced the retreat, a statement was given out that the\r\nreinforcements expected from Scotland were on the road, and had\r\nalready entered England,--that Wade was endeavouring to intercept\r\nthem,--that the object of the retrograde movement was to effect a\r\njunction with them,--and that as soon as these reinforcements had\r\njoined the army, the march to London would be resumed. It was hinted\r\nthat they would probably meet these reinforcements about Preston or\r\nLancaster. The prospect thus held out to them of a speedy advance\r\nupon London, tended to allay the passions of the men, but they\r\ncontinued sullen and silent during the whole of the day.[1053]\r\n\r\nThe army lay the first night at Ashbourne. It reached Leek next day;\r\nbut that town being too small to accommodate the army, Elcho’s and\r\nPitsligo’s horse, and Ogilvy’s and Roy Stuart’s regiments of foot,\r\nwent on to Macclesfield, where they passed the night. The remainder\r\nof the army came next day to Macclesfield, and the other division,\r\nwhich had passed the night there, went to Stockport. On the 9th both\r\ndivisions met on the road to Manchester, and entered that town in a\r\nbody. There had been considerable rioting and confusion in Manchester\r\non the preceding day. Imagining from the retreat that the Highland\r\narmy had sustained a reverse, a mob had collected, and, being\r\nreinforced by great numbers of country people with arms, had insulted\r\nthe Jacobite inhabitants, and seemed disposed to dispute the entrance\r\nof the Highland army into the town; but upon the first appearance of\r\nthe van, the mob quietly dispersed, and order was restored.[1054]\r\nIn the retreat some abuses were committed by stragglers, who could\r\nnot be prevented from going into houses. As Lord George Murray\r\nfound great difficulty in bringing these up, he found it necessary\r\nto appoint an expert officer out of every regiment to assist in\r\ncollecting the men belonging to their different corps who had kept\r\nbehind, a plan which he found very useful.[1055]\r\n\r\nIt was Charles’s intention to have halted a day at Manchester, and he\r\nissued orders to that effect; but on Lord George Murray representing\r\nto him that delay might be dangerous, the army left that town on the\r\nforenoon of the 10th, and reached Wigan that night. Next day the army\r\ncame to Preston, where it halted the whole of the 12th. From Preston\r\nthe Duke of Perth was despatched north with 100 horse, to bring up\r\nthe reinforcements from Perth.[1056]\r\n\r\nThe prince arrived at Lancaster late in the evening of the 13th.\r\nOn reaching his quarters, Lord George Murray found that orders had\r\nbeen given out, that the army was to halt there all the next day.\r\nOn visiting Charles’s quarters next morning, Lord George was told\r\nby the prince that he had resolved to fight the enemy, and desired\r\nhim to go along with O’Sullivan, and reconnoitre the ground in the\r\nneighbourhood for the purpose of choosing a field of battle. His\r\nlordship, contrary to the expectations of those who had advised\r\nCharles to fight, and who supposed that Lord George would have\r\nopposed that measure, offered no advice on the subject. He merely\r\nproposed that as the ground suitable for regular troops might not\r\nanswer the Highlanders, some Highland officers should also inspect\r\nthe ground, and as Lochiel was present, he requested that he would go\r\nalong with him,--a request with which he at once complied. With an\r\nescort of horse and foot, and accompanied by Lochiel and O’Sullivan,\r\nLord George returned back about two miles, where he found a very\r\nfine field upon a rising ground sufficiently large for the whole\r\narmy, and which was so situated, that from whatever quarter the enemy\r\ncould come, the army would be completely covered till the enemy were\r\nclose upon them. After surveying these grounds very narrowly, and\r\ntaking three of the enemy’s rangers prisoners, the reconnoitring\r\nparty returned to Lancaster. From the prisoners Lord George received\r\ninformation that the corps called the rangers was at Garstang, and\r\nthat a great body of Wade’s dragoons had entered Preston a few\r\nhours after he had left it. His lordship reported to the prince the\r\nresult of the survey, and told him that if the number of his men\r\nwas sufficient to meet the enemy, he could not wish a better field\r\nof battle for the Highlanders; but Charles informed him that he had\r\naltered his mind, and that he meant to proceed on his march next\r\nday.[1057]\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to notice the movements of the Duke of Cumberland\r\nand Marshal Wade. By retaining possession of Swarkstone bridge for\r\nsome time after his main body left Derby, Charles deceived Cumberland\r\nas to his motions, and the Highland army was two days’ march distant\r\nfrom the duke’s army before he was aware of its departure from Derby.\r\nAs soon, however, as he was apprised of the retreat, the duke put\r\nhimself at the head of his horse and dragoons, and 1,000 mounted\r\nvolunteers, furnished by some of the gentlemen of Warwickshire, for\r\nthe purpose of stopping the Highlanders till the royal army should\r\ncome up, or, failing in that design, of harassing them in their\r\nretreat. He marched by Uttoxeter and Cheadle; but the roads being\r\nexcessively bad, he did not arrive at Macclesfield till the night\r\nof the 10th, on which day the Highland army had reached Wigan. At\r\nMacclesfield the duke received intelligence that the Highlanders had\r\nleft Manchester that day. His royal highness thereupon sent orders to\r\nthe magistrates of Manchester to seize all stragglers belonging to\r\nthe Highland army; he directed Bligh’s regiment, then at Chester, to\r\nmarch to Macclesfield, and, at the same time, ordered the Liverpool\r\nBlues to return to Warrington, where they had been formerly posted.\r\nEarly on the 11th, he detached Major Wheatley with the dragoons in\r\npursuit of the Highlanders. Meanwhile Marshal Wade having held a\r\ncouncil of war on the 8th, at Ferrybridge, in Yorkshire, had resolved\r\nto march by Wakefield and Halifax into Lancashire, in order to\r\nintercept the insurgents in their retreat northwards. He accordingly\r\ncame to Wakefield on the 10th at night, where, learning that the\r\nvan-guard of the Highland army had reached Wigan, he concluded that\r\nhe would not be able to overtake it, and therefore resolved to return\r\nto his old post at Newcastle by easy marches. He, however, detached\r\nGeneral Oglethorpe with the horse to join the duke. This officer\r\ncrossed Blackstone Edge with such expedition, that he reached\r\nPreston on the same day that the Highlanders left it, having marched\r\nabout 100 miles in three days, over roads at any time unfavourable,\r\nbut now rendered almost impassable by frost and snow. At Preston,\r\nOglethorpe found the Georgia rangers, and was joined by a detachment\r\nof Kingston’s horse, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Mordaunt. Here\r\nthese united forces halted nearly a whole day, in consequence of\r\nan express which the Duke of Cumberland had received from London,\r\nannouncing that a French expedition from Dunkirk had put to sea, and\r\nrequiring him to hold himself in readiness to return to the capital.\r\nThis information was afterwards found to be erroneous; but it was of\r\nservice to the Highlanders, who, in consequence of the halt of the\r\nroyal forces, gained a whole day’s march a-head of their pursuers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carlisle, from Stanwix Bank--1745.]\r\n\r\nIn his retreat, the chief danger the prince had to apprehend was\r\nfrom the army of Wade, who, by marching straight across the country\r\ninto Cumberland, might have reached Penrith a day at least before\r\nthe prince; but by the information he received of the route taken\r\nby Wade’s cavalry, he saw that the danger now was that the united\r\ncavalry of both armies might fall upon his rear before he could\r\nreach Carlisle. He therefore left Lancaster on the 15th; but the rear\r\nof his army was scarcely out of the town when some of the enemy’s\r\nhorse entered it. The town bells were then rung, and the word being\r\ngiven from the rear to the front, that the enemy was approaching, the\r\nHighlanders formed in order of battle; but the alarm turning out to\r\nbe false, the army continued its march to Kendal. The enemy’s horse,\r\nhowever, followed for two or three miles, and appeared frequently in\r\nsmall parties, but attempted nothing. The army entered Kendal that\r\nnight, where they were met by the Duke of Perth and his party. In his\r\nway north, the duke had been attacked in this town by a mob, which he\r\nsoon dispersed by firing on them; but in the neighbourhood of Penrith\r\nhe met with a more serious obstruction, having been attacked by a\r\nconsiderable body of militia, both horse and foot, and being vastly\r\noutnumbered, was obliged to retreat to Kendal.[1058]\r\n\r\nAs Lord George Murray considered it impossible to transport the\r\nfour-wheeled waggons belonging to the army to Shap, he proposed\r\nto the prince to substitute two-wheeled carts for them,[1059] and\r\nas he was afraid that no provisions could be obtained at Shap, he\r\nsuggested that the men should be desired to provide themselves with a\r\nday’s provision of bread and cheese. Orders were accordingly issued\r\nagreeably to these suggestions, but that regarding the waggons seems\r\nnot to have been attended to; and by some oversight, the order about\r\nthe provisions was not communicated to many of them till they were\r\non their march next morning. The consequence was, that the men who\r\nwere unprovided returned to the town, and much confusion would have\r\nensued, had not Lord George Murray sent some detachments of the rear\r\nwith officers into the town to preserve order, and to see the men\r\nreturn to the army. This omission retarded considerably the march of\r\nthe army. The difficulties which Lord George Murray had anticipated\r\nin transporting the waggons across the hills were realised, and by\r\nthe time he had marched four miles and got among the hills, he was\r\nobliged to halt all night, and take up his quarters at a farm house\r\nabout a gun-shot off the road. The Glengarry men were in the rear\r\nthat day, and though reckoned by his lordship not the most patient of\r\nmortals, he says he “never was better pleased with men in his life,”\r\nhaving done all that was possible for men to do.[1060]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Glengarry regiment, the army passed the\r\nnight between the 16th and 17th at Shap.[1061] On the morning of the\r\n17th, Lord George received two messages from Charles, ordering him\r\nupon no account to leave the least thing, not so much as a cannon\r\nball behind, as he would rather return himself than that any thing\r\nshould be left. Though his lordship had undertaken to conduct the\r\nretreat on the condition that he should not be troubled with the\r\ncharge of the baggage, ammunition, &c., he promised to do all in his\r\npower to carry every thing along with him. To lighten the ammunition\r\nwaggons, some of which had broken down, his lordship prevailed\r\nupon the men to carry about 200 cannon balls, for which service\r\nhe gave the bearers sixpence each. With difficulty the rear-guard\r\nreached Shap that night at a late hour. Here he found most of the\r\ncannon, and some of the ammunition with Colonel Roy Stuart and his\r\nbattalion.[1062] The same night, the prince with the main body\r\narrived at Penrith. Some parties of militia appeared at intervals;\r\nbut they kept at a considerable distance, without attempting\r\nhostilities.[1063]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 18th, the rear-guard left Shap; but as\r\nsome of the small carriages were continually breaking, its march was\r\nmuch retarded. It had not proceeded far when some parties of English\r\nlight-horse were observed hovering at some distance on the eminences\r\nbehind the rear-guard. Lord George Murray notified the circumstance\r\nto the prince at Penrith; but as it was supposed that these were\r\nmilitia, the information was treated lightly. No attempt was made to\r\nattack the rear-guard, or obstruct its progress, till about mid-day,\r\nwhen a body of between 200 and 300 horse, chiefly Cumberland people,\r\nformed in front of the rear-guard, behind an eminence near Clifton\r\nHall, and seemed resolved to make a stand. Lord George Murray was\r\nabout to ascend this eminence, when the party was observed marching\r\ntwo and two abreast on the top of the hill. They suddenly disappeared\r\nto form themselves in order of battle behind the eminence, and made\r\na great noise with trumpets and kettle-drums. At this time two of\r\nthe companies of Roy Stuart’s regiment, which the Duke of Perth had\r\nattached to the artillery, were at the head of the column. The guns\r\nand ammunition waggons followed, behind the two other companies of\r\nthe same regiment. The Glengarry regiment, which marched with Lord\r\nGeorge Murray at its head, was in the rear of the column. Believing,\r\nfrom the great number of trumpets and kettle-drums, that the English\r\narmy was at hand, the rear-guard remained for a short time at the\r\nbottom of the hill, as if at a loss how to act in a conjuncture\r\nwhich appeared so desperate. It was the opinion of Colonel Brown,\r\nan officer of Lally’s regiment, who was at the head of the column,\r\nthat they should rush upon the enemy sword in hand, and either open\r\na passage to the army at Penrith, or perish in the attempt. The men\r\nof the four companies adopting this opinion, immediately ran up the\r\nhill, without informing Lord George Murray of their resolution; and\r\nhis lordship, on observing this movement, immediately ordered the\r\nGlengarry men to proceed across the inclosure, and ascend the hill\r\nfrom another quarter, as they could not conveniently pass the waggons\r\nwhich had almost blocked up the roads. The Glengarry men, throwing\r\noff their plaids, reached the summit of the hill almost as soon as\r\nthe head of the column, on gaining which, both parties were agreeably\r\nsurprised to find, that the only enemy in view was the light horse\r\nthey had observed a few minutes before, and who, alarmed at the\r\nappearance of the Highlanders, galloped off in disorder. One of the\r\nfugitives fell from his horse, and was cut to pieces in an instant by\r\nthe Highlanders.[1064]\r\n\r\nThe rear-guard resumed its march, and on reaching the village of\r\nClifton, Lord George Murray sent the artillery and heavy baggage\r\nforward to Penrith under a small escort. Being well acquainted\r\nwith all the inclosures and parks about Lowther Hall, the seat of\r\nLord Lonsdale, about the distance of a mile from Clifton, Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, at the head of the Glengary regiment and some horse,\r\nexamined these parks and inclosures in the hope of falling in with\r\nthe light horse; but, although he saw several of them, he only\r\nsucceeded in making two prisoners. By these prisoners Lord George\r\nwas informed that the duke himself, with a body of 4,000 horse,\r\nwas about a mile behind him. As Clifton was a very good post, Lord\r\nGeorge Murray resolved to remain there; and on his return to the\r\nvillage he sent Colonel Roy Stuart with the two prisoners to Penrith,\r\nto inform Charles of the near approach of the duke, and that he\r\nwould remain at Clifton till further orders. In the event of the\r\nprince approving of his intention of making a stand at Preston, his\r\nlordship requested that 1,000 men might be sent him from Penrith. On\r\nreturning to Clifton from Lowther parks, Lord George found the Duke\r\nof Perth there; and, besides Colonel Roy Stuart’s men, who amounted\r\nto about 200, he also found the Macphersons with their chief,\r\nCluny Macpherson, and the Stewarts of Appin, headed by Stewart of\r\nArdshiel.[1065]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRASER. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nBefore the return of Colonel Roy Stuart from Penrith, the enemy\r\nappeared in sight, and proceeded to form themselves into two lines\r\nupon Clifton moor, about half a mile from the village. The Duke of\r\nPerth thereupon rode back to Penrith to bring up the rest of the army\r\nto support Lord George, who he supposed would, from the strength\r\nof his position, be able to maintain himself till joined by the\r\nmain body. The duke was accompanied by an English gentleman who had\r\nattended Lord George during the retreat, and, knowing the country\r\nperfectly well, had offered to lead without discovery the main body a\r\nnear way by the left, by which movement they would be enabled to fall\r\nupon the enemy’s flank. Had Lord George received the reinforcement\r\nhe required, his design was to have sent half of his men through the\r\ninclosures on his right, so as to have flanked the duke’s army on\r\nthat side, whilst it was attacked on the other by the other half.\r\nHe expected that if he succeeded in killing but a small number of\r\nCumberland’s horse that the rest would be thrown into disorder, and\r\nthat as they would be obliged to retreat through a lane nearly a mile\r\nlong, between Lord Lonsdale’s inclosures, that they would choke up\r\nthe road, and that many of them would be unable to escape. In absence\r\nof this reinforcement, however, the Lieutenant-general was obliged\r\nto make the best dispositions he could with the force he had with\r\nhim, which amounted to about 1,000 men in all, exclusive of Lord\r\nPitsligo’s horse and hussars, who, on the appearance of the enemy,\r\nshamefully fled to Penrith.[1066]\r\n\r\nThe dispositions of Lord George were these. Within the inclosures\r\nto the right of the highway he posted the Glengarry men, and\r\nwithin those to their left he placed the Stewarts of Appin and the\r\nMacphersons. On the side of the highway, and close to the village of\r\nClifton, he placed Colonel Roy Stuart’s regiment. As some ditches\r\nat the foot stretched farther towards the moor on the right than on\r\nthe left, and as that part was also covered by Lord Lonsdale’s other\r\ninclosures, the party on the right could not easily be attacked; and\r\nthey had this advantage, that they could with their fire flank the\r\nenemy when they attacked the left. To induce the enemy to believe\r\nthat his numbers were much greater than they were, Lord George, after\r\nexhibiting the colours he had at different places, caused them to be\r\nrolled up, carried to other places, and again unfurled.[1067]\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after the Duke of Cumberland had formed his men, about\r\n500 of his dragoons dismounted and advanced forward to the foot of\r\nthe moor, in front of a ditch at the bottom of one of three small\r\ninclosures between the moor and the places where Roy Stuart’s men\r\nwere posted at the village. At this time Colonel Stuart returned\r\nfrom Penrith, and, after informing Lord George that the prince had\r\nresolved to march immediately to Carlisle, and that he had sent\r\nforward his cannon, he stated that it was his royal highness’s desire\r\nthat he should immediately retreat to Penrith. From the situation\r\nin which the Lieutenant-general was now placed, it was impossible\r\nto obey this order without great danger. The dismounted horse were\r\nalready firing upon the Highlanders, who were within musket-shot;\r\nand, if retreat was once begun, the men might get into confusion in\r\nthe dark, and become discouraged. Lord George proposed to attack the\r\ndismounted party, and stated his confidence that he would be able by\r\nattacking them briskly to dislodge them; Cluny Macpherson and Colonel\r\nStuart concurring in Lord George’s opinion, that the course he\r\nproposed was the only prudent one that could be adopted, they agreed\r\nnot to mention the message from the prince.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this determination, Lord George Murray went to the\r\nright where the Glengarry men were posted, and ordered them, as\r\nsoon as they should observe him advance on the other side, to move\r\nalso forward and keep up a smart fire till they came to the lowest\r\nditch. He observed that if they succeeded in dislodging the enemy\r\nfrom the hedges and ditches, they could give them a flank fire\r\nwithin pistol-shot; but he gave them particular injunctions not\r\nto fire across the highway, nor to follow the enemy up the moor.\r\nAfter speaking with every officer of the Glengarry regiment, his\r\nlordship returned to the left, and placed himself at the head of the\r\nMacphersons, with Cluny by his side. It was now about an hour after\r\nsunset, and the night was somewhat cloudy; but at short intervals the\r\nmoon, which was in its second quarter, broke through and afforded\r\nconsiderable light. The Highlanders had this advantage, that whilst\r\nthey could see the disposition of the enemy, their own movements\r\ncould not be observed. In taking their ground the dismounted\r\ndragoons had not only lined the bottom inclosures which ran from\r\neast to west, directly opposite the other inclosures in which the\r\nHighlanders were posted, but some of them had advanced up along two\r\nhedges that lay south and north.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders being ready to advance, the Stewarts and Macphersons\r\nmarched forward at the word of command, as did the Macdonalds on the\r\nright. The Highlanders on the right kept firing as they advanced;\r\nbut the Macphersons, who were on the left, came sooner in contact\r\nwith the dragoons, and received the whole of their fire. When the\r\nballs were whizzing about them, Cluny exclaimed, “What the devil is\r\nthis?” Lord George told him that they had no remedy but to attack\r\nthe dragoons, sword in hand, before they had time to charge again.\r\nThen drawing his sword, he cried out, “Claymore,” and Cluny doing\r\nthe same, the Macphersons rushed down to the bottom ditch of the\r\ninclosure, and clearing the diagonal hedges as they went, fell sword\r\nin hand upon the enemy, of whom a considerable number were killed at\r\nthe lower ditch. The rest fled across the moor, but received in their\r\nflight the fire of the Glengarry regiment. In this skirmish only\r\ntwelve Highlanders were killed; but the royal forces sustained a loss\r\nof about one hundred in killed and wounded, including some officers.\r\nThe only officer wounded on the side of the Highlanders was Macdonald\r\nof Lochgarry, who commanded the Glengarry men. Lord George Murray\r\nmade several narrow escapes. Old Glenbucket, who, from infirmity,\r\nremained at the end of the village on horseback, had lent him his\r\ntarget, and it was fortunate for Lord George that he had done so. By\r\nmeans of this shield, which was convex, and covered with a plate of\r\nmetal painted, his lordship protected himself from the bullets of\r\nthe dragoons, which cleared away the paint off the target in several\r\nplaces.[1068] The only prisoner taken on this occasion was a footman\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland, who stated that his master would have been\r\nkilled, if a pistol, with which a Highlander took aim at his head,\r\nhad not missed fire. This man was sent back to his royal highness by\r\nthe prince.[1069]\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a short time at Clifton after the skirmish, Lord\r\nGeorge went to Penrith, where he found the prince ready to mount\r\nfor Carlisle. His royal highness was very well pleased with the\r\nresult of the action. The men who had been engaged halted at Penrith\r\na short time to refresh themselves; and the prince, after sending\r\nClanranald’s and Keppoch’s regiments as far back as Clifton bridge,\r\nto induce the inhabitants to believe that he meant to fight the Duke\r\nof Cumberland, left Penrith for Carlisle with the main body. Next\r\nmorning the whole army reached Carlisle, where the prince found\r\nletters, though rather of an old date, from Lord John Drummond and\r\nLord Strathallan. Lord John gave him great encouragement from the\r\ncourt of France, and informed his royal highness that it was the\r\ndesire of the King of France that the prince should proceed with\r\ngreat caution, and if possible avoid a decisive action till he\r\nreceived the succours the king intended to send him, which would be\r\nsuch as to put his success beyond all doubt, and that, in the mean\r\ntime, he (Lord John) had brought over some troops and a train of\r\nartillery, sufficient to reduce all the fortresses in Scotland. Lord\r\nStrathallan gave a very favourable account of the state of the army\r\nassembled at Perth, which he represented as better than that which\r\nthe prince had with him. As nothing positive, however, was known\r\nat Carlisle of the operation of the Jacobite forces in the north,\r\nCharles resolved to continue the retreat into Scotland. Contrary\r\nto the opinion of Lord George Murray, who advised him to evacuate\r\nCarlisle, Charles resolved to leave a garrison there to facilitate\r\nhis return into England, of which at the time he had strong hopes\r\nwhen joined by the forces under Lords Strathallan and Drummond.[1070]\r\nAs Carlisle was not tenable, and as the Highland army could easily\r\nhave re-entered England independent of any obstruction from any\r\ngarrison which could be put into it, the conduct of Charles in\r\nleaving a portion of his army behind has been justly reprehended;\r\nbut there is certainly no room for the accusation which has been\r\nmade against him, of having wilfully sacrificed the unfortunate\r\ngarrison.[1071] It was not without difficulty that Charles\r\ncould make up a garrison. The Duke of Perth was unwilling to\r\nallow any of his men to remain; and appearing to complain in the\r\npresence of the prince that a certain number of the Athole men had\r\nnot been draughted for that service, Lord George Murray told him,\r\nalso in the prince’s presence, that if his royal highness would order\r\nhim, he would stay with the Athole brigade, though he knew what his\r\nfate would be.[1072] The number of men left in garrison amounted to\r\nabout 400. Mr. Hamilton was continued in the command of the castle,\r\nand Mr. Townley was made commandant of the town.\r\n\r\nThe Highland army halted the whole of the 19th in Carlisle, and\r\ndeparted next day for Scotland. The Esk, which forms part of the\r\nboundary between England and Scotland on the west, was, from an\r\nincessant rain of several days, rendered impassable by the nearest\r\nroad from Carlisle; but at the distance of about eight miles from\r\nCarlisle it was still fordable. The army reached the place, where\r\nthey intended to cross, about two o’clock in the afternoon. Before\r\ncrossing the water, the following route was fixed upon by the advice\r\nof Lord George Murray, whose opinion had been asked by Charles in\r\npresence of some of his officers, viz., that Lord George, with six\r\nbattalions, should march that night to Ecclefechan, next day to\r\nMoffat, and there halt a day; and after making a feint towards the\r\nEdinburgh road, as if he intended to march upon the capital, to turn\r\noff to Douglas, then to Hamilton and Glasgow,--that the prince should\r\ngo with the clans and most of the horse that night to Annan, next\r\nday to Dumfries, where they should rest a day; then to Drumlanrig,\r\nLeadhills, Douglas, and Hamilton, so as to be at Glasgow the day\r\nafter the arrival in that city of Lord George’s division.[1073]\r\n\r\nThough the river was usually shallow at the place fixed upon for\r\npassing, it was now swollen, by continued rains, to the depth of\r\nfour feet. The passage was not without its dangers; but as the river\r\nmight be rendered impassable by a continuation of the rain during\r\nthe night, and as it was possible that the Duke of Cumberland might\r\nreach the Esk next morning, it was resolved to cross it immediately.\r\nAfter trying the water to ascertain that the ford was good, a body\r\nof cavalry formed in the river, a few paces above the ford, to break\r\nthe force of the stream, and another body was likewise stationed in\r\nthe river below the ford to pick up such of the infantry as might be\r\ncarried away by the violence of the current. This arrangement being\r\ncompleted, the infantry entered the river a hundred men abreast,\r\neach holding one another by the neck of the coat, by which plan they\r\nsupported one another against the rapidity of the river, leaving\r\nsufficient intervals between their ranks for the passage of the\r\nwater. Lord George Murray, who was among the first to enter the water\r\nin his philibeg, says, that when nearly across, there were about\r\n2,000 men in the water at once. The appearance of the river, in the\r\ninterval between the cavalry, presented an extraordinary spectacle.\r\nAs the heads of the Highlanders were generally all that was seen\r\nabove the water, the space of water occupied in the passage looked\r\nlike a paved street. Not one man was lost in the transit; but a few\r\ngirls who had followed their lovers in their adventurous campaign,\r\nwere swept away by the current. After the army had passed, the pipes\r\nbegan to play; and the Highlanders, happy on setting their feet again\r\non Scottish ground, forgot for a time the disappointment they had\r\nsuffered at Derby, and testified their joy by dancing reels upon the\r\nnorthern bank of the Esk.[1074]\r\n\r\nThe expedition into England, though not signalised by any great\r\nmilitary achievement, will always hold a distinguished place in the\r\nannals of bold and adventurous enterprise. It was planned and carried\r\nthrough in all its details with great judgment; and if circumstances\r\nhad not delayed its execution, it might have terminated in success.\r\nFrom the consternation into which the English people were thrown by\r\nthe invasion of the Highland army,[1075] it seems certain, that\r\nwithout the aid of a regular army their militia would scarcely have\r\nventured to oppose the march of the Highlanders to the metropolis;\r\nbut after the return of the British forces from Flanders, the arrival\r\nof the Dutch auxiliaries, and the assembling of the armies under\r\nWade and Ligonier, the attempt appeared to be hopeless. It was\r\nnot, however, until the retreat from Derby that the government was\r\nrelieved from its anxiety for the safety of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland halted at Penrith on the 20th of December,\r\nand marched next day to Carlisle, which he invested the same day.\r\nAs he was under the necessity of sending to Whitehaven for heavy\r\ncannon, the fire from his batteries did not commence till the morning\r\nof the 28th. During the blockade the garrison fired repeatedly upon\r\nthe besiegers, but with little effect. A fire was kept up by the\r\nbesiegers from a battery of six eighteen-pounders, during the 28th\r\nand 29th. Another battery of three thirteen-pounders was completed\r\non the 30th; but on the first fire from the old battery that day,\r\nthe besieged hung out a white flag, and offered hostages for a\r\ncapitulation. The Duke of Cumberland, on observing this signal, sent\r\none of his aides-de-camp with a note, desiring to know its meaning;\r\nto which Governor Hamilton answered, that the object was to obtain\r\na cessation for a capitulation, and desiring to know what terms his\r\nroyal highness would grant to the garrison. The only condition the\r\nduke would grant was, that the garrison should not be put to the\r\nsword, but be reserved for the king’s pleasure; and Hamilton, seeing\r\nthe impossibility of holding out, surrendered the same day. The\r\ngarrison, including officers, consisted of 114 men of the Manchester\r\nregiment; of 274 men, also including officers, chiefly of the Scotch\r\nlow country regiments, and a few Frenchmen and Irishmen. The number\r\nof cannon in the castle was sixteen, ten of which had been left by\r\nthe Highland army on its return to Scotland. Among the prisoners were\r\nfound twelve deserters from the royal forces, who were immediately\r\nhanged. The officers were kept prisoners in the castle, but the\r\nprivates were confined in the cathedral and town-jail. The whole were\r\nafterwards dispersed in several jails through England. The Duke of\r\nCumberland, after putting Bligh’s regiment in garrison at Carlisle,\r\nreturned to London, in consequence of an order from court.[1076]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[988] _Kirkconnel MS._ Lord George Murray’s Narrative, in _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_, p. 47.\r\n\r\n[989] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[990] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[991] The Highland army about the middle of November, according to a\r\nlist then published, was thus composed:--\r\n\r\n  _Regiments._       _Colonels._                  _Men._\r\n\r\n  Lochiel,       Cameron, younger of Lochiel,       740\r\n\r\n  Appin,         Stewart of Ardshiel,               360\r\n\r\n  Athole,        Lord George Murray,              1,000\r\n\r\n  Clanranald,    Macdonald, yr. of Clanranald       200\r\n\r\n  Keppoch,       Macdonald of Keppoch,              400\r\n\r\n  Glencoe,       Macdonald of Glencoe,              200\r\n\r\n  Ogilvy,        Lord Ogilvy,                       500\r\n\r\n  Glenbucket,    Gordon of Glenbucket,              427\r\n\r\n  Perth,         { Duke of Perth (including }       750\r\n                 {  Pitsligo’s foot),       }\r\n\r\n  Robertson,     Robertson of Strowan,              200\r\n\r\n  Maclauchlan,   Maclauchlan of Maclauchlan,        260\r\n\r\n  Glencairnock,  Macgregor of Glencairnock,         300\r\n\r\n  Nairne,        Lord Nairne,                       200\r\n\r\n  Edinburgh,     John Roy Stewart,                  450\r\n\r\n  Several small corps,                            1,000\r\n\r\n  Horse,         { Lord Elcho,      }               160\r\n                 { Lord Kilmarnock, }\r\n\r\n  Horse,         Lord Pitsligo’s,                   140\r\n                                                  -----\r\n                                                  7,287\r\n\r\nThe numbers, however, are overrated.\r\n\r\n[992] _Memoirs_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[993] Letters from Moor and Smart, two of the agents of the Chevalier\r\nde St. George, will be found among the _Stuart Papers_.

James\r\nGib, his master of household, appears to have grudged Charles’s\r\nliberality, as he observes that Hymer furnished nothing, not even\r\ncoal or candle; and, moreover, that he and his wife had every day\r\ntwo dishes of meat at dinner, and as many at supper, at the cost of\r\nthe prince. But Charles’s liberality was not confined to landlords,\r\nfor Gib states, that whenever he happened to pass even a night in\r\na gentleman’s house, his ordinary custom was to give at least five\r\nguineas of ‘drink-money’ to the servants.\r\n\r\n[1023] _Kirkconnel MS._ _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[1024] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 457.\r\n\r\n[1025] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 52.\r\n\r\n[1026] At Wigan, Charles gave “a woman” ten guineas for one night\r\nfor the use of her house, her husband, “a squire, being from\r\nhome.”--_Household Book._\r\n\r\n[1027] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 63.

But the\r\nprince could not be brought to consent. He still insisted that Weir\r\nwas not, properly speaking, a spy, since he was not found in the army\r\nin disguise. I cannot tell whether the prince, on this occasion, was\r\nguided by his opinion or by his inclination.

After stating that his\r\nlordship represented to Charles the dangerous situation he might\r\nbe in if the united armies of Wade and Cumberland overtook him\r\nbefore reaching Carlisle, he says that Lord George “proposed to\r\navoid them by sacrificing the cannon and all the heavy baggage to\r\nthe safety of the men, which was now at stake. He observed that the\r\ncountry is mountainous betwixt Kendal and Penrith, and the roads,\r\nin many places, very difficult for such carriages; but the prince\r\nwas positive not to leave a single piece of his cannon. He would\r\nrather fight both their armies than give such an argument of fear\r\nand weakness. He gave peremptory orders that the march should be\r\ncontinued in the same order as hitherto, and not a single carriage to\r\nbe left at Kendal.”\r\n\r\n[1060] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[1061] In the prince’s _Household Book_, printed among the _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_, the following entries occur:--\r\n\r\n  Dec. 17th, at Shape, Tuesday.\r\n\r\n  To ale, wine, and other provisions,       £4  17\r\n  The landlady for the use of her house,     2   2\r\n\r\n  N.

It was, to be sure, much for the prince’s reputation upon\r\nleaving England, to keep one of the keys of it, and he was in hopes\r\nof returning before it could be taken; but he could not be absolutely\r\nsure of that, and the place was not tenable against a few pieces of\r\nartillery, of battering cannon, or a few mortars. It’s true he had a\r\ngood many prisoners in Scotland, and might look upon them as pledges\r\nfor the lives of those he left in garrison; but that was not enough.\r\nHe did not know what kind of people he had to deal with, and he\r\nought to be prepared against the worst that could happen. The lives\r\nof so many of his friends ought not to have been exposed without an\r\nindispensable necessity, which was not the case; for blowing up the\r\ncastle, and the gates of the town, would have equally given him an\r\nentry into England.”\r\n\r\n[1072] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[1073] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[1074] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 74.--Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[1075] “The terror of the English,” says the Chevalier Johnstone,\r\n_Memoirs_, p. 101, “was truly inconceivable, and in many cases they\r\nseemed quite bereft of their senses. One evening as Mr. Cameron of\r\nLochiel entered the lodgings assigned to him, his landlady, an old\r\nwoman, threw herself at his feet, and with uplifted hands and tears\r\nin her eyes, supplicated him to take her life, but to spare her two\r\nlittle children. He asked her if she was in her senses, and told\r\nher to explain herself; when she answered, that every body said\r\nthe Highlanders ate children, and made them their common food. Mr.\r\nCameron having assured her that they would not injure either her\r\nor her little children, or any person whatever, she looked at him\r\nfor some moments with an air of surprise, and then opened a press,\r\ncalling out with a loud voice, ‘Come out children; the gentleman\r\nwill not eat you.’ The children immediately left the press where\r\nshe had concealed them, and threw themselves at his feet. They\r\naffirmed in the newspapers of London that we had dogs in our army\r\ntrained to fight, and that we were indebted for our victory at\r\nGladsmuir to these dogs, who darted with fury on the English army.\r\nThey represented the Highlanders as monsters, with claws instead\r\nof hands. In a word, they never ceased to circulate, every day,\r\nthe most extravagant and ridiculous stories with respect to the\r\nHighlanders. The English soldiers had indeed reason to look upon us\r\nas extraordinary men, from the manner in which we had beaten them\r\nwith such inferior numbers, and they probably told these idle stories\r\nto the country people by way of palliating their own disgrace.” The\r\nable editor of Johnstone’s _Memoirs_ relates in a note to the above,\r\nthat Mr. Halkston of Rathillet, who was in the expedition, stated\r\nthat the belief was general among the people of England, that the\r\nHighlanders ate children:--“While the army lay at Carlisle he was\r\ntaken ill, and went with a few of his companions to a farmer’s house\r\nin the neighbourhood, where he remained several days. Perceiving his\r\nlandlady to be a young woman, he asked her if she had any children,\r\nand where they were. When she found that he was no cannibal, she told\r\nhim the truth was, that all the children were sent out of the way for\r\nfear the Highlanders should devour them.”\r\n\r\nA Derby gentleman, who had a party of forty men quartered in his\r\nhouse, in a letter which appeared in all the newspapers of the\r\nperiod, describes most of them as looking “like so many fiends turned\r\nout of hell to ravage the kingdom and cut throats; and under their\r\nplaids nothing but various sorts of butchering weapons were to be\r\nseen.” He complains that they had eaten up “near a side of beef,\r\neight joints of mutton, four cheeses, with abundance of white and\r\nbrown bread, (particularly white,) three couples of fowls, and would\r\nhave drams continually, as well as strong-ale, beer, tea, &c.” In\r\nthe midst of this general devastation our host was convulsed with\r\n“unavoidable laughter to see these desperadoes, from officers to the\r\ncommon men, at their several meals, first pull off their bonnets, and\r\nthen lift up their eyes in a most solemn manner, and mutter something\r\nto themselves, by way of saying grace, as if they had been so many\r\npure primitive Christians!!!” This is merely a specimen of the many\r\nridiculous stories with which the English journals of the period were\r\ncrammed.\r\n\r\n[1076] Boyse, p. 129.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1745-46.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  The Highland army returns to Scotland--Arrives at Glasgow\r\n  --Proceedings of the Jacobites in the North--Arrest\r\n  and escape of Lord Lovat--Skirmish at Inverury--Alarm\r\n  at Edinburgh--Arrival of an English army--The Prince at\r\n  Glasgow--Marches towards Stirling--Investment and surrender\r\n  of the town--Skirmishing on the Forth--Highland army\r\n  reinforced--Hawley’s army arrives at Falkirk--Preparations for\r\n  battle--Battle of Falkirk.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the plan of march fixed upon at crossing the Esk, the\r\nHighland army separated, and Lord George Murray, at the head of the\r\nlow country regiments, proceeded to Ecclefechan, where he arrived on\r\nthe night of the 20th, and marched next day to Moffat. The prince, at\r\nthe head of the clans, marched to Annan, where he passed the night of\r\nthe 20th. The horse of the prince’s division under Lord Elcho were,\r\nafter a short halt, sent to take possession of Dumfries, which they\r\naccomplished early next morning, and the prince, with the clans, came\r\nup in the evening. In no town in Scotland had there been greater\r\nopposition displayed to the restoration of the house of Stuart than\r\nin Dumfries, from the danger to which the inhabitants supposed their\r\nreligious liberties, as presbyterians, would be exposed under a\r\ncatholic sovereign. This feeling, which was strongly manifested by\r\nthem in the insurrection of 1715, had now assumed even a more hostile\r\nappearance from the existence of the new body of dissenters called\r\n“Seceders,” which had lately left the bosom of the established\r\nchurch of Scotland, and which professed principles thought to be more\r\nin accordance with the gospel than those of their parent church. A\r\nbody of these dissenters had volunteered for the defence of Edinburgh\r\nshortly after Charles had landed, and, on his march for England, a\r\nparty of them had taken up arms, and had captured and carried to\r\nDumfries thirty waggons belonging to the Highland army, which had\r\nbeen left at Lockerby by the escort appointed to protect them. To\r\npunish the inhabitants for their hostility, Charles ordered them to\r\npay £2,000 in money, and to contribute 1,000 pairs of shoes. About\r\n£1,100 only were raised; and, in security for the remainder, Mr.\r\nCrosbie, the provost, and a Mr. Walter Riddel, were carried off as\r\nhostages. The prince also levied the excise at Dumfries, and carried\r\noff some arms, horses, &c. Some outrages were committed in the town\r\nby the Highlanders, who told the inhabitants that they ought to think\r\nthemselves gently used, and be thankful that their town was not\r\nburned to ashes.\r\n\r\nAfter halting a day at Dumfries, the prince proceeded with his\r\ndivision up Nithsdale on the evening of the 23d, and passed the\r\nnight at Drumlanrig, the seat of the Duke of Queensberry. Next day\r\nhe entered Clydesdale, and halted at Douglas. The prince slept that\r\nnight in Douglas castle. He reached Hamilton on the 25th, and took\r\nup his residence in the palace of the Duke of Hamilton. Next day the\r\nChevalier occupied himself in hunting, an amusement of which he was\r\nuncommonly fond, and to which he had been accustomed from his youth.\r\nThe division under Lord George Murray, after halting a day at Moffat,\r\nwhere, being Sunday, his men heard sermon in different parts of the\r\ntown from the episcopal ministers who accompanied them, proceeded by\r\nDouglas and Hamilton, and entered Glasgow on Christmas day. On the\r\nevening of the 26th the prince also marched into Glasgow on foot at\r\nthe head of the clans. Here he resolved to halt and refresh his men\r\nfor a few days after their arduous march, and to provide them with\r\nclothing, of which they stood greatly in need. In passing through\r\nDouglas and Lesmahago, the Highlanders pillaged and burnt some\r\nhouses, in revenge for the capture of Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart,\r\nwho, in his way south from the Highlands, had been seized on\r\nBrokencross moor, near Lesmahago, by the country people, headed\r\nby a student of divinity named Linning, and carried to Edinburgh\r\ncastle.[1077]\r\n\r\nBefore noticing Charles’s proceedings at Glasgow, it is necessary to\r\ngive a short summary of those of his friends in the north, up to the\r\nperiod of his arrival in that city.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence of the Chevalier’s march into England, and his\r\nunexpected success at Carlisle was received in the north, the zeal of\r\nthe Jacobites was more and more inflamed. Whilst the Frasers, headed\r\nby the Master of Lovat, blockaded Fort Augustus, Lord Lewis Gordon\r\nwas busily employed in raising men, and levying money by force and\r\nthreats of military execution, in the shires of Banff and Aberdeen.\r\nOf two battalions which his lordship raised, one was placed under the\r\ncommand of Gordon of Abbachie, and the other under Moir of Stonywood.\r\nTo relieve Fort Augustus, the Earl of Loudon left Inverness on\r\nthe 3d of December with 600 men of the independent companies, and\r\npassing through Stratherrick during a very severe frost, reached\r\nFort Augustus without opposition, and having supplied the garrison\r\nwith every thing necessary for its defence, returned to Inverness\r\non the 8th, after notifying to the inhabitants of Stratherrick the\r\nrisk they would incur should they leave their houses and join the\r\ninsurgents.[1078]\r\n\r\nAs the future progress of the insurrection in the Highlands depended\r\nmuch upon the Frasers, Lord Loudon, in conjunction with Lord\r\nPresident Forbes, resolved to march to Castle Downie, the seat of\r\nLord Lovat, and to obtain the best satisfaction that could be got\r\nfor the peaceable behaviour of that powerful clan. For this purpose,\r\ntwo companies of the Mackenzies, which had been posted near Brahan,\r\nwere called into Inverness on the 9th of December, and after allowing\r\nthe detachment, which had been at Fort Augustus, one day’s rest,\r\nhis lordship left Inverness on the 10th, taking along with him that\r\ndetachment and the two companies, amounting together to 800 men,\r\nand proceeded to Castle Downie. The earl prevailed upon Lord Lovat\r\nto go with him to Inverness, and to live there under his own eye,\r\nuntil all the arms of which the clan were possessed, (and of which\r\nhe promised to obtain the delivery,) were brought in. But instead of\r\ndelivering the arms on the day fixed, being the 14th of December,\r\nhe made excuses and fresh promises from day to day till the 21st,\r\nwhen Lord Loudon, thinking that he was deceived, placed sentries\r\nat the door of the house where Lord Lovat resided, intending to\r\ncommit him to the castle of Inverness next morning; but his lordship\r\ncontrived to escape during the night through a back passage, and,\r\nbeing very infirm, was supposed to have been carried off on men’s\r\nshoulders.[1079]\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the keeping down of the Frasers, was the\r\nrelief of the shires of Banff and Aberdeen from the sway of Lord\r\nLewis Gordon. To put an end to the recruiting and exactions of this\r\nnobleman, the laird of Macleod was sent the same day that Lord Loudon\r\nproceeded to the seat of Lord Lovat with a body of 500 men, composed\r\nof 400 of his own kindred, and 100 of the Macleods of Assint, towards\r\nElgin, and these were to be followed by as many men as could be\r\nspared from Inverness, after adjusting matters with Lord Lovat.\r\nAccordingly, on the 13th, 200 men were detached under Captain Munro\r\nof Culcairn, to follow Macleod to Elgin and Aberdeen, and these\r\nwere again to be followed by other small bodies, and by Lord Loudon\r\nhimself, as soon as matters were finally settled with Lovat. The\r\nescape of that wily old chief, however, put an end to this part of\r\nthe plan, as it was considered dangerous to reduce the force near\r\nInverness any farther, while Lord Lovat was at large.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Macleod reached Elgin, where he received intelligence\r\nthat a party of 200 of the insurgents had taken possession of the\r\nboats on the Spey at Fochabers, and that they intended to dispute\r\nthe passage with him. Macleod advanced to the banks of the Spey on\r\nthe 15th; but the insurgents, instead of waiting for him, retired\r\non his approach, and he passed the river without molestation. On\r\nthe 16th and 17th he marched to Cullen and Banff. Meanwhile Munro of\r\nCulcairn arrived with his detachment at Keith, where he was joined\r\nby Grant of Grant at the head of 500 of his clan, and on the 18th\r\nthey proceeded, in conjunction, to Strathbogie. Next day it was\r\nagreed upon between Macleod and Culcairn, that whilst the former\r\nshould march next morning from Banff to Old Meldrum, which is twelve\r\nmiles from Aberdeen, the latter, with Grant and his men, should at\r\nthe same time proceed to Inverury, which is about the same distance\r\nfrom Aberdeen; but Grant, apprehensive that his own country would be\r\nharassed in his absence, returned home.[1080]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Lewis Gordon heard of the arrival of Macleod at Inverury,\r\nhe resolved to attack him. With his own regiment, the men whom\r\nLord John Drummond had sent, and a battalion of 300 Farquharsons,\r\ncommanded by Farquharson of Monaltry, he left Aberdeen on the 23d,\r\nand arrived near Inverury with such expedition and secrecy, that he\r\nalmost surprised Macleod in his quarters. It was late before Lord\r\nLewis reached the place, and Macleod had barely time to put his\r\nmen under arms, and to seize some advantageous posts in the town.\r\nDay-light had disappeared before the action commenced; but the light\r\nof the moon enabled the combatants to see one another. Both sides\r\ncontinued to fire for some time; but Lord John Drummond’s soldiers\r\nand the Farquharsons having advanced close upon the Macleods, the\r\nlatter fled, and never halted till they had recrossed the Spey. Very\r\nfew men were killed on either side; but the victors took forty-one\r\nprisoners, among whom were Mr. Gordon, younger of Ardoch; Forbes of\r\nEcht; Maitland of Petrichie; and John Chalmers, one of the regents of\r\nthe university of Aberdeen.[1081]\r\n\r\nShortly after this skirmish, Lord Lewis Gordon marched his men to\r\nthe general rendezvous at Perth, where, about the time of Prince\r\nCharles’s return from England, about 4,000 men were collected.\r\nThese consisted of the Mackintoshes, the Frasers, the part of the\r\nMackenzies attached to Charles, and the Farquharsons; of recruits\r\nsent from the Highlands to the clan regiments that had gone to\r\nEngland; of the forces raised by Lord Lewis Gordon, Sir James\r\nKinloch, and other gentlemen in the low country of the north; and of\r\nthe troops brought over from France by Lord John Drummond.\r\n\r\nWhile this mixed body lay at Perth, a disagreement occurred between\r\nthe Highlanders and the other troops, which might have led to\r\nserious consequences if the arrival of an order sent by the prince\r\nfrom Dumfries, requiring them to hold themselves in readiness to\r\njoin him, had not put an end to the dispute. This disagreement was\r\noccasioned by the conduct of Lord Strathallan and his council of\r\nofficers, on receiving the order which Charles had sent from Carlisle\r\nby Maclauchlan of Maclauchlan, to march with all their forces, and\r\nto follow the army into England. This order, contrary to the opinion\r\nof Maclauchlan and all the Highland officers, they had considered\r\nit inexpedient to obey. The result was, that the Highland officers\r\ncaballed together, and resolved to march; but as the Highlanders\r\nhad no money, as many of those who had come last from the Highlands\r\nwanted arms, and as Lord Strathallan was in possession of the money,\r\narms, ammunition, and stores, they could not proceed. In this dilemma\r\nthey entered into a combination to seize the money and arms, and,\r\npersisting in their resolution to march, matters were proceeding to\r\nextremities when Rollo of Powhouse arrived at Perth with the order\r\nalluded to, which at once put an end to the dispute.[1082]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Edinburgh, relieved from the presence of the\r\nHighland army, had lived for five weeks in a state of comparative\r\nsecurity. Public worship had been resumed in several of the city\r\nchurches on the 3d of November, and in all of them on the 10th. The\r\nstate officers who had retired to Berwick, did not, however, return\r\ntill the 13th, when they entered the city with an air of triumph,\r\nwhich accorded ill with their recent conduct as fugitives. On the\r\nfollowing day, Lieutenant-general Handasyde arrived, as before\r\nstated, at Edinburgh with Price’s and Ligonier’s regiments of foot,\r\nand Hamilton’s and Ligonier’s (lately Gardiner’s,) dragoons; and,\r\non the 7th of December, these troops were sent west to Stirling,\r\nwhere, in conjunction with the Glasgow and Paisley militia, amounting\r\nto nearly 700 men, commanded by the Earl of Home, they guarded\r\nthe passes of the Forth. In the mean time, exertions were made to\r\nre-embody the Edinburgh regiment; but these do not appear to have\r\nbeen attended with success. With the exception of some young men who\r\nformed themselves into a volunteer company, few of the inhabitants\r\nwere disposed to take up arms, as they were fully sensible, that\r\nwithout a sufficient force of regular troops, no effectual resistance\r\ncould be opposed to the Highlanders, should they return to the city.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of matters, the news of the Highlanders having\r\ncrossed the Esk in their retreat from England, reached Edinburgh,\r\nand threw the civil and military authorities into a state of\r\nconsternation. Ignorant of the route the Highlanders meant to\r\nfollow, they were extremely perplexed how to act. They naturally\r\napprehended another visit, and their fears seemed to be confirmed by\r\nthe return to Edinburgh of the regular troops from the west, on the\r\n23d of December, and by the arrival of the Glasgow regiment the next\r\nday, all of whom had retreated to Edinburgh on the approach of the\r\nHighlanders. A resolution was adopted by the public authorities to\r\nput the city in a proper state of defence, and, on the 29th, a paper\r\nwas read in the city churches, acquainting the inhabitants, that it\r\nhad been resolved in a council of war to defend the city. Next day a\r\nconsiderable number of men from the parishes in the neighbourhood,\r\nwho had been provided with arms from the castle, entered the city,\r\nand were drawn up in the High Street. The men of each parish\r\nmarched by themselves, and were attended in most instances by their\r\nrespective ministers.[1083] These were joined by other small corps,\r\none of the most remarkable of which was a body of Seceders, belonging\r\nto the associated congregations of Edinburgh and Dalkeith, carrying\r\na standard with the inscription, “For Religion, Covenants, King, and\r\nKingdoms.”\r\n\r\nHad the Highlanders chosen to march upon Edinburgh, the resolution\r\nto defend it would not have been carried into effect, as it was the\r\nintention of the regular troops to have retired to Berwick on their\r\napproach; but, fortunately for the reputation of the new defenders\r\nof the capital, an army under Lieutenant-general Hawley was now on\r\nits march into Scotland. This gentleman, who had just been appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief in Scotland, though described by the Duke of\r\nNewcastle as “an officer of great ability and experience,”[1084] was\r\nin fact a man of very ordinary military attainments, and in no way\r\nfitted for the important duty which had been assigned him. His whole\r\ngenius lay, as Mr. John Forbes of Culloden observed to his father,\r\nthe president, in the management of a squadron, or in prosecuting\r\nwith vigour any mortal to the gallows. He had a very sorry opinion\r\nof the prowess of the Highlanders, whom he was confident of beating,\r\nif his troops were in good condition, without regard to the numbers\r\nof their opponents;[1085] but he was destined soon to find out his\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nTo expedite the march of the English army, the gentlemen and\r\nfarmers of Teviotdale, the Merse, and the Lothians furnished\r\nhorses, by means of which the first division of the royal army,\r\nconsisting of a battalion of the Scots Royals and Battereau’s\r\nfoot, reached Edinburgh as early as the 2d of January, where they\r\nwere shortly joined by Fleming’s and Blakeney’s regiments, that of\r\nMajor-general Huske, by Hawley himself, by the regiments of Wolfe\r\n(not, as has been supposed, the immortal general of that name) and\r\nCholmondeley, Howard’s (the old Buffs) and Monro’s, and by Barrel’s\r\nand Pulteney’s. At Dunbar, Aberlady, and other places, these troops\r\nwere entertained by the proprietors in East Lothian, who allowed\r\neach soldier a pound of beef, a pound of bread, a glass of spirits,\r\nand a bottle of ale.[1086] They were also feasted at Edinburgh at\r\nthe expense of the city, where they were courteously received by the\r\nterrified inhabitants, who furnished them with blankets, and evinced\r\ngreat anxiety to make them comfortable.[1087] The citizens also\r\nilluminated their houses; and such as declined had their windows\r\nbroken by the mob, who also demolished with an unsparing hand all\r\nthe windows of such houses as were uninhabited. On his arrival in\r\nthe city, the commander-in-chief justified Mr. Forbes’s opinion by\r\ncausing one gallows to be erected in the Grassmarket, and another\r\nbetween Leith and Edinburgh, on which it is supposed he meant to hang\r\nsuch unfortunate victims as might fall into his hands.[1088]\r\n\r\nTo return to Charles. On his arrival at Glasgow, his first care\r\nwas to provide for the necessities of his men, who were in a most\r\npitiable plight from the want of clothing. He ordered the magistrates\r\nto furnish the army with 12,000 shirts, 6,000 cloth coats, 6,000\r\npairs of stockings, and 6,000 waistcoats. Enraged at the conduct of\r\nthe citizens for having subscribed to the fund for raising troops\r\nagainst him, the prince sent for Buchanan the provost, and demanded\r\nthe names of the subscribers, and threatened to hang him in case of\r\nrefusal; but the provost, undismayed, replied that he would name\r\nnobody except himself, that he had subscribed largely, as he thought\r\nhe was discharging a duty, and that he was not afraid to die in such\r\na cause. The provost had to pay a fine of £500 as the penalty of his\r\nrefusal.[1089]\r\n\r\nThe mansion which Charles occupied during his residence in Glasgow\r\nbelonged to a rich merchant named Glassford. It was the best house\r\nin the city, and stood at the western extremity of the Trongate,\r\nbut has long since disappeared. While in Glasgow he ate twice a-day\r\nin public. The table was spread in a small dining-room, at which he\r\nsat down without ceremony with a few of his officers in the Highland\r\ndress. He was waited upon on these occasions by a few Jacobite\r\nladies. Charles courted popularity, and, to attract attention,\r\ndressed more elegantly in Glasgow than at any other place;[1090]\r\nbut the citizens of Glasgow kept up a reserve, which made Charles\r\nremark, with a feeling of mortifying disappointment, that he\r\nhad never been in a place where he found fewer friends. Though\r\ndissatisfied with the people, he seemed, however, greatly to admire\r\nthe regularity and beauty of the buildings.[1091]\r\n\r\nHaving refitted his army, Charles, within a few days after his\r\narrival, reviewed it on Glasgow Green, in presence of a large\r\nconcourse of spectators, and had the satisfaction to find that,\r\nwith the exception of those he had left at Carlisle, he had not\r\nlost more than 40 men during his expedition into England. Hitherto\r\nhe had carefully concealed his weakness, but now, thinking himself\r\nsure of doubling his army in a few days, he was not unwilling to let\r\nthe world see the handful of men with which he had penetrated into\r\nthe very heart of England, and returned in the face of two powerful\r\narmies almost without loss.[1092]\r\n\r\nAbandoning, in the mean time, his project of returning to England,\r\nCharles resolved to lay siege to the castles of Stirling and\r\nEdinburgh. He depended much for success upon the artillery and\r\nengineers brought over by Lord John Drummond, and looked confidently\r\nforward for additional succours from France in terms of the repeated\r\nassurances he had received. Having determined on beginning with\r\nStirling, he sent orders to Lord Strathallan, Lord John Drummond,\r\nLord Lewis Gordon, and other commanders in the north, to join him\r\nforthwith with all their forces. To accelerate a junction with the\r\nforces at Perth, the prince marched his army from Glasgow on the\r\n4th of January, 1766, in two divisions; one of which, commanded by\r\nthe prince, took the road to Kilsyth, where it passed the night.\r\nCharles himself took up his quarters in Kilsyth house, then belonging\r\nto Mr. Campbell of Shawfield. Mr. Campbell’s steward, it is said,\r\nwas ordered to provide every thing necessary for the comfort of the\r\nprince, under a promise of payment, but was told next morning that\r\nthe bill should be allowed to his master at accounting for the rents\r\nof Kilsyth, which was a forfeited estate. Next day Charles marched\r\ntowards Stirling, and encamped his division at Denny, Bannockburn,\r\nand St. Ninians. He passed the night at Bannockburn-house, the\r\nseat of Sir Hugh Paterson, where he was received with Jacobite\r\nhospitality. The other division, consisting of six battalions of\r\nthe clans, under Lord George Murray, spent the first night at\r\nCumbernauld, and the next at Falkirk, where they fixed their quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stirling, about the beginning of the 18th\r\nCentury.--From Slezer’s _Theatrum Scotiæ_.]\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the siege of the castle, Charles resolved to reduce\r\nthe town of Stirling. The inhabitants, encouraged by General\r\nBlakeney, the governor of the castle, determined to defend the\r\ntown; and a body of about 600 volunteers, all inhabitants of the\r\ntown, was supplied by the governor with arms and ammunition from\r\nthe castle, and promised every assistance he could afford them. He\r\ntold them, at the same time, that if they should be overpowered\r\nthey could make a good retreat, as he would keep an open door for\r\nthem. Animated by the activity of the magistrates and the clergymen\r\nof the town--among whom the Rev. Ebenezer Erskine, the father of\r\nthe Secession,[1093] who commanded two companies of Seceders, was\r\nparticularly distinguished--the inhabitants proceeded to put the town\r\nin a posture of defence.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Saturday the 4th of January, the Highlanders had\r\nnearly surrounded the town; but they did not complete the investment\r\ntill next day, which was partly occupied in cutting down some trees\r\nintended for fascines, on which they meant to construct a battery.\r\nAbout eight o’clock in the evening they sent a drummer to the east\r\ngate with a message; but, being fired upon by the sentinels, he threw\r\naway his drum and fled. The insurgents fired several shots into the\r\ntown during the night, which were responded to by the volunteers, who\r\nwere all under arms, and posted in different parties at the different\r\nby-ways and paths into the town, and at such parts of the wall as\r\nwere deemed insufficient. During the night the utmost alarm prevailed\r\namong the inhabitants, and few of them went to bed. Some fled from\r\nthe town, and others retired into the castle; but the magistrates\r\nand the other principal inhabitants remained all night in the\r\ncouncil chamber in which they had assembled, to give such direction\r\nand assistance as might be necessary, in case an assault should be\r\nattempted during the night.[1094]\r\n\r\nNext morning the insurgents were discovered erecting a battery within\r\nmusket-shot of the town, almost opposite to the east gate, in a\r\nsituation where the cannon of the castle could not be brought to bear\r\nupon them. The volunteers kept up a constant fire of musketry upon\r\nthem; but, in spite of this annoyance, the Highlanders completed the\r\nbattery before noon. Charles, thereupon, sent a verbal message to the\r\nmagistrates, requiring them instantly to surrender the town; but, at\r\ntheir solicitation, they obtained till ten o’clock next day to make\r\nup their minds. The message was taken into consideration at a public\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants, and the question of surrender was long\r\nand anxiously debated. The majority having come to the resolution\r\nthat it was impossible to defend the town with the handful of men\r\nwithin, two deputies were sent to Bannockburn, the head-quarters of\r\nthe Highland army, who offered to surrender on terms; stating that,\r\nrather than surrender at discretion, as required, they would defend\r\nthe town to the last extremity. After a negotiation, which occupied\r\nthe greater part of Tuesday, the following terms of capitulation\r\nwere agreed upon: viz., that no demand should be made upon the town\r\nrevenues,--that the inhabitants should not be molested in their\r\npersons or effects,--and that the arms in the town should be returned\r\nto the castle. Pending this negotiation, the Highlanders, to terrify\r\nthe inhabitants into a speedy submission, as is supposed, discharged\r\ntwenty-seven shots from the battery into the town, which, however,\r\ndid no other damage than beating down a few chimney tops. After the\r\narms were carried into the castle, the gates were thrown open on\r\nWednesday the 8th, and the Highlanders entered the town about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon.[1095]\r\n\r\nBeing in want of battering cannon for a siege, Charles had, before\r\nhis departure from Glasgow, sent orders to Lord John Drummond, to\r\nbring up the pieces which he had brought over from France. As General\r\nBlakeney had broken down part of Stirling bridge, to prevent the\r\ninsurgents at Perth from crossing the Forth at Stirling, some of\r\nthe battering cannon were sent to the Frews, and were transported\r\nacross that ford by means of floats, while the rest were brought to\r\nAlloa as a nearer road for the purpose of being transported across\r\nthe Frith of Forth. Great difficulty was experienced in getting over\r\nthese pieces, and as there was but a small guard along with them,\r\nthey might have fallen into the hands of a party of troops sent up\r\nthe Frith by Hawley, had not Lord George Murray, on hearing of their\r\nembarkation, sent over Lochiel with his regiment, which had lately\r\nbeen augmented by recruits, and was now 700 strong.[1096]\r\n\r\nAs there were no ships at Alloa, Lord George seized a vessel lying\r\noff Airth to transport his cannon across the Frith. This was a\r\nfortunate circumstance, as two sloops of war, the Pearl and Vulture,\r\nsailed up the Frith next tide from Leith roads to seize all the\r\nvessels and boats in the neighbourhood, and otherwise to obstruct the\r\nconveyance of the cannon. General Hawley, about the same time, viz.,\r\non the 8th of January, sent up some armed boats, and a small vessel\r\nwith cannon from Leith, manned with 300 men under the command of\r\nLieutenant-colonel Leighton, to destroy all the works the Highlanders\r\nhad made to cover the passage of their cannon. The sloops of war\r\nanchored in Kincardine roads, whence, on the morning of the 8th, two\r\nlong boats well manned were sent up towards Airth, in conjunction\r\nwith the other boats and small armed vessel, to burn two vessels\r\nlying in the neighbourhood which could not be launched till the\r\nspring tides. This service they effected without the loss of a single\r\nman, though the boats were fired upon by the Highlanders who were\r\nposted in the village. Having been prevented from returning to the\r\nstation off Kincardine, by the lowness of the tide, the Highlanders\r\nopened a battery of three pieces of cannon next morning upon the\r\nflotilla, but without doing it any damage. The Highlanders are said\r\nto have had two of their cannon dismounted on this occasion by the\r\nfire from the sloop, and to have sustained a loss of several men,\r\nincluding their principal engineer.[1097]\r\n\r\nApprehensive that the flotilla would next attempt to set fire to the\r\nother vessel, Lord George Murray erected a battery of four guns at\r\nElphinstone Pans to command the river, and to keep off the sloops\r\nof war, should they attempt to come up. In addition to the troops\r\nstationed at Airth, his lordship sent a reinforcement of between 300\r\nand 400 men from Falkirk, which arrived at Elphinstone and Airth on\r\nthe 10th. At this time the vessel which had been seized at Airth was\r\nlying at Alloa, and had taken two out of seven pieces of cannon,\r\nwith some ammunition on board. To capture this vessel, a large boat,\r\nhaving 50 soldiers on board, along with the boats belonging to the\r\nsloops of war, well manned and armed, were sent up the river during\r\nthe night of the 10th, with instructions to lie all night a mile\r\nabove Alloa, in order to intercept the vessel should an attempt be\r\nmade to carry her up the river during the night. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, for this design, the boats grounded after passing the\r\ntown, and the Highlanders who were posted in the town, having, by\r\nthis accident, come to the knowledge that the enemy was at hand,\r\nimmediately beat to arms, and commenced a random fire from right to\r\nleft, which forced the boats to retreat down the river. Next morning,\r\nhowever, the two sloops of war, accompanied by some smaller vessels,\r\nwent up the river with the tide, and casting anchor opposite to, and\r\nwithin musket-shot of the battery, opened a brisk fire. Three of\r\nthe smaller vessels anchored in a convenient place to play upon the\r\nvillage of Elphinstone, and two more hovered along as if inclined to\r\nland some soldiers, with which they were crowded. The firing was kept\r\nup on both sides, for upwards of three hours, without much damage\r\non either side. The cable of one of the sloops of war having been\r\ncut asunder by a cannon shot, an accident which forced her from her\r\nstation, and the two pilots in the other having each lost a leg, the\r\nassailants abandoned the enterprise, and fell down the river with\r\nthe ebb-tide. Being now relieved from the presence of the enemy,\r\nLord George brought over the cannon and stores without further\r\nopposition.[1098]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, two days after he had taken possession of the\r\ntown, Charles broke ground before Stirling castle, between the church\r\nand a large house at the head of the town, called _Marr’s work_. Here\r\nhe raised a battery against the castle, upon which he mounted two\r\nsixteen-pounders, two pieces of eight, and three of three. The prince\r\nthereupon summoned General Blakeney to surrender, but his answer was,\r\nthat he would defend the place to the last extremity; that as honour\r\nhad hitherto been his rule through life, he would rather die than\r\nstain it by abandoning his post, and that his royal highness would\r\nassuredly have a very bad opinion of him, were he to surrender the\r\ncastle in such a cowardly manner.[1099] To prevent any intelligence\r\nof their operations being carried to the enemy, the Highlanders shut\r\nthe gates of the town, and placed guards at all the outlets. The\r\nsiege went on very slowly, and Charles soon perceived that he had\r\nchosen a bad situation for his battery, which was so exposed to the\r\nfire of the castle, that its works were speedily demolished, and the\r\ncannon dismounted.\r\n\r\nWhile the siege was going on, the forces in the north under Lord\r\nStrathallan and Lord John Drummond began to arrive at Stirling. By\r\nthese reinforcements the prince’s army was increased to 9,000 men,\r\nall in the highest spirits. The Macdonalds, the Camerons, and the\r\nStuarts, were now twice as numerous as they were when the Highland\r\narmy entered England, and Lord Ogilvy had got a second battalion,\r\nunder the command of Sir James Kinloch, as lieutenant-colonel,\r\nmuch stronger than the first. The Frasers, the Mackintoshes, and\r\nFarquharsons, were reckoned 300 men each, and in addition to these,\r\nthe Earl of Cromarty, and his son, Lord Macleod, had also brought up\r\ntheir men.[1100]\r\n\r\nConceiving himself in a sufficiently strong condition to give battle\r\nto the Highlanders, General Hawley began to put the troops he had\r\nassembled at Edinburgh in motion towards the west. His force amounted\r\nto upwards of 9,000 men, of whom 1,300 were cavalry, and he might in\r\na few days have increased it considerably by the addition of some\r\nregiments which were on their march to join him. He had also reason\r\nto expect the immediate arrival in the Frith of Forth of a body\r\nof 6,000 Hessians who had embarked at Williamstadt on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, by which accession his army would have been almost doubled.\r\nImpatient, however, to acquire a renown which had been denied to\r\nCope, his predecessor, of whose capacity he had been heard to speak\r\nvery contemptuously, Hawley resolved not to wait for his expected\r\nreinforcements, but to seize the laurels which were in imagination\r\nalready within his grasp.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morning of the 13th of January, the first\r\ndivision of the royal army, consisting of five regiments of foot,\r\ntogether with the Glasgow regiment of militia, and Hamilton’s and\r\nLigonier’s dragoons, all under the command of Major-general Huske,\r\nleft Edinburgh and marched westward to Linlithgow. Hearing that\r\npreparations had been made at Linlithgow for the reception of these\r\ntroops, and that provisions and forage had been collected in that\r\ntown for the use of Hawley’s army, Lord George Murray left Falkirk at\r\nfour o’clock the same morning for Linlithgow, with five battalions\r\nof the clans for the purpose of capturing these stores. He was\r\njoined on the road by Lord Elcho’s and Lord Pitsligo’s troops of\r\nlife-guards, whom he had ordered to meet him. Before sunrise he had\r\ncompletely surrounded the town, and as Lord George had been informed\r\nthat Huske’s division was to enter the town at night, he called his\r\nofficers together before marching into town, and having told them the\r\nobject for which they had come, he desired that they would continue\r\nready to assemble in the street on a moment’s warning, in order to\r\nmarch wherever they might be directed. After taking possession of\r\nthe town, and apprehending a few militia, Lord George sent forward\r\nsome patrols on the road to Edinburgh, to reconnoitre while the\r\nHighlanders were engaged in seizing the articles prepared for the\r\nroyal forces; but they had scarcely been an hour in town when these\r\nadvanced parties discovered a body of dragoons advancing in their\r\ndirection. Two of the patrols came back at full speed, and having\r\ngiven Lord George notice of their approach, he marched with his men\r\nout of the town. The dragoons retired as the Highlanders advanced.\r\nTheir horse, with 200 of the best foot, followed them about two\r\nmiles; but the main body returned to Linlithgow, where they dined.\r\nWith the exception of a few small reconnoitring parties, the advanced\r\nbody also returned to the town; but in less than an hour one of\r\nthese parties came in with information that the dragoons were again\r\nreturning with a large body of horse and foot. Lord George resolved\r\nto attack them when the half of them should pass the bridge, half\r\na mile west from the town, and after waiting with his men on the\r\nstreets till Huske had reached the east end of the town, he retired\r\nin the expectation that the royalist general would follow him; but\r\nHuske, who marched above the town, though he followed the Highlanders\r\nto the bridge, did not pass it. Lord George returned to Falkirk, and\r\nby orders of the prince marched next day to Bannockburn.[1101]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th other three regiments marched from Edinburgh towards\r\nBorrowstownness, to support the division under Huske, and these were\r\nfollowed next day by three additional regiments. With these forces\r\nHuske marched on the 16th to Falkirk, and encamped to the north-west\r\nof the town with his front towards Stirling. In the evening he was\r\njoined by the remainder of the army, and the artillery, consisting\r\nof ten pieces of cannon. General Hawley himself arrived at\r\nCallander House the same evening. Next morning the army was joined\r\nby Cobham’s dragoons, who had just arrived from England, and by\r\nabout 1,000 Argyleshire men, chiefly Campbells, under the command\r\nof Lieutenant-colonel Campbell, afterwards Duke of Argyle. Besides\r\nthis corps, this whig clan furnished another of 1,000 men, which was\r\nposted about Inverary, under Major-general Campbell, the colonel’s\r\nfather, to guard the passes. Along with the army was a company\r\ncalled the Yorkshire Blues, raised, maintained, and commanded, by\r\na gentleman of the name of Thornton. Several volunteers, among whom\r\nwere several clergymen, also accompanied the army on this occasion.\r\n\r\nHaving received intelligence of the advance of the royalists to\r\nFalkirk, Charles, on the evening of the 16th, ordered the different\r\ndetachments of his army to concentrate upon Plean moor, about seven\r\nmiles from that town, and two miles to the east of Bannockburn,\r\nwhere his head-quarters were. He, however, left several battalions,\r\namounting to about 1,000 men, in Stirling, under the Duke of Perth,\r\nto push on the siege of the castle. Nobody supposed that the prince,\r\nin issuing this order, had any other object in contemplation than\r\nto review his army, and of so little importance was it considered,\r\nthat although the order was immediately made known on all sides,\r\nit was near twelve o’clock next day before the different parts of\r\nthe army arrived from their quarters.[1102] After the army had been\r\ndrawn up in line of battle, Charles called a council of war, and\r\nfor the first time stated his intention of giving immediate battle\r\nto Hawley. That general had, it is believed, been informed of the\r\nprobability of an attack, but he treated the information lightly,\r\nand instead of attending to the affairs of his camp, spent the\r\nmorning at Callander House with the Countess of Kilmarnock, with\r\nwhom he breakfasted.[1103] The Torwood, once a forest of great\r\nextent, celebrated as the chief retreat of the heroic Wallace, but\r\nnow greatly decayed, lay between the two armies; and through what\r\nwas once the middle of the forest, the high road from Stirling to\r\nFalkirk, by Bannockburn, passes.\r\n\r\nFrom information which Charles had received, he supposed that Hawley\r\nwould have advanced and offered him battle; but seeing no appearance\r\nof him, he put his army in motion about mid-day, towards Falkirk.\r\nWhile the main body of the army marched in two columns along the\r\nmoor, on the west side of the Torwood, where they could not be seen\r\nfrom Hawley’s camp, a third body of horse and foot, under Lord John\r\nDrummond, appeared upon the high road which runs through the centre\r\nof the Torwood, and moved about, displaying their colours in view of\r\nthe enemy, as if they intended to attack Hawley’s camp. The object\r\nof this parade was to draw off the attention of the enemy from the\r\nmain body, which was advancing unperceived towards Falkirk, by a\r\ndifferent route. After the two columns had advanced about half a\r\nmile, Lord George Murray received an order from the prince to delay\r\npassing the water of Carron till night, as he did not think it\r\nadvisable to cross in the face of the enemy, but his lordship having\r\nsatisfied his royal highness of the impropriety of the order, he was\r\nallowed to proceed. Ignorant of the approach of the main body of the\r\nHighlanders, Hawley’s officers thought the demonstration made by the\r\nbody on the high road unworthy of attention; but they were aroused\r\nfrom their apathy by a countryman, who arrived in the camp with\r\nintelligence that the Highlanders were close upon them. Two of the\r\nofficers immediately ascended a tree, and, by means of a telescope,\r\ndescried the Highland army marching towards Falkirk, by the south\r\nside of the Torwood. This was a little before one o’clock, and the\r\nofficers having communicated the circumstance to Lieutenant-colonel\r\nHoward, their commanding officer, he went to Callander House and\r\ninformed the general of it. Instead, however, of ordering his men to\r\nget under arms, Hawley directed that they should merely put on their\r\naccoutrements. This order was obeyed, and the troops sat down to\r\ndinner, but before they had finished their repast, they were summoned\r\nto arms.\r\n\r\nWhen the Highlanders came in sight of the water of Carron, the town\r\nof Falkirk, and the enemy’s camp, also opened upon their view. It was\r\nnow between one and two o’clock, and some well-mounted scouts, who\r\nwere on the opposite side of the water, on observing the Highlanders,\r\nimmediately rode off at full gallop, and reported that the Highland\r\narmy was about to cross the Carron at Dunnipace. The alarm which this\r\nintelligence produced in the royalist camp was very great. Hawley was\r\ninstantly sent for, and the commanding officers, who were exceedingly\r\nperplexed, formed their regiments as quickly as possible upon the\r\nground in front of the camp. The general, instantly mounting his\r\nhorse, galloped to the camp, and in his haste left his hat behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn taking the circuitous route by the south side of the Torwood,\r\nCharles had a double object in view--to conceal his approach from\r\nthe enemy as long as he could, and to obtain possession of Falkirk\r\nmoor, about two miles south-west of Hawley’s camp, and which,\r\nfrom the nature of the ground, was considered well fitted for the\r\noperations of a Highland army. Suspecting that it was the prince’s\r\ndesign to secure the heights of the moor, Hawley at once determined\r\nto prevent him, if possible, and accordingly on his arrival at the\r\ncamp he ordered the three regiments of dragoons to march towards\r\nthe moor, and take possession of the high ground between them and\r\nthe insurgents. He also directed the infantry to follow them with\r\nfixed bayonets. This was a rash and inconsiderate step, as Hawley\r\nhad never examined the ground, which he found, when too late, was by\r\nno means a suitable field of battle for his troops. In ordering his\r\narmy to march up the moor, the English commander is said to have been\r\nimpressed with the idea that the Highlanders did not mean to attack\r\nhim, but to give him the slip, and march back to England, and that\r\nhis object was to intercept them and bring them to action.[1104] This\r\nexplanation, however, is by no means satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Carron at Dunnipace Steps, the main body of the\r\nHighlanders stretched along the moor in two parallel lines, about\r\ntwo hundred paces asunder. The column next the royal army consisted\r\nof the clan regiments which had been in England, and of the recruits\r\nwhich had lately arrived from the Highlands, with the Frasers, and\r\na battalion of the Farquharsons. The other column, which was to the\r\nright of the last mentioned, consisted of the Athole brigade, the\r\nMaclauchlans, the battalions of Ogilvy and Gordon, and Lord John\r\nDrummond’s regiment. After reaching the bottom of the hill, the\r\ncolumns faced to the left, and began to ascend the eminence. Almost\r\nsimultaneously with this movement, Hawley’s dragoons, proceeding\r\nalong the eastern wall of Bantaskin inclosures, rapidly ascended\r\nthe hill also, followed by the foot with fixed bayonets. At this\r\ninstant, the sky, which till then had been unusually serene, became\r\nsuddenly overcast, and before the foot had advanced far, a violent\r\nstorm of wind and rain burst from the south-west, which beat directly\r\nin the faces of the soldiers, and retarded their march up the hill.\r\nA running contest seemed now to take place between the dragoons and\r\nthe advanced divisions of the Highland columns, consisting of the\r\nMacdonalds and the Athole men, to gain the summit of the ridge of the\r\nmoor. Both parties reached the top of the hill about the same time,\r\nand possessed themselves of two eminences, within musket-shot of each\r\nother. To prevent the dragoons gaining the advantage of the ground\r\nand the wind, the Macdonalds and Athole men had advanced with such\r\nrapidity, that they had left the rear of the columns considerably\r\nbehind, and on reaching the height of the moor, they halted to give\r\ntime to the rear to come up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord George Murray, who commanded the right wing, proceeded\r\nto make the necessary arrangements for battle. In forming, the two\r\ncolumns merely faced to the left, by which simple movement the\r\neastern column at once became, as originally designed, the front\r\nline. When completed, the order of battle of the Highland army\r\nwas as follows. On the extreme right of the first line, stood the\r\nMacdonalds of Keppoch, next to these the Macdonalds of Clanranald,\r\nand in succession the regiment of Glengary, a battalion of\r\nFarquharsons under Farquharson of Bumarrel,[1105] the Mackenzies, the\r\nMackintoshes, the Macphersons under Cluny their chief, the Frasers\r\nunder the Master of Lovat, the Stuarts of Appin, and the Camerons,\r\nwho formed the extreme left of this line. The second line, which\r\nchiefly consisted of the low country regiments, was composed of\r\nthe Athole brigade, which formed the right wing, of Lord Ogilvy’s\r\nregiment of two battalions in the centre, and of the regiment of\r\nLord Lewis Gordon, also of two battalions, which formed the left of\r\nthe line. At the distance of about twenty yards in the rear of the\r\ncentre of the second line, the prince was stationed with some horse\r\nand foot, and was joined before the commencement of the action by\r\nLord John Drummond, with a large body of horse, the Irish piquets and\r\nthe other troops, with which he had made the feint, as a _corps de\r\nreserve_. Some of the horse guards under Lords Elcho and Balmerino,\r\nand also some of the hussars, who were on the right of the prince,\r\nwere sent farther to the right to protect the flank, but they were\r\nprevented from extending farther, by a morass, which covered the\r\nright wing, and were obliged to draw up behind the Athole men. At the\r\nopposite extremity on the left of the prince, Lord Pitsligo’s and\r\nKilmarnock’s horse were stationed.[1106]\r\n\r\nThe infantry of the royal army was also formed in two lines, with a\r\nbody of reserve in the rear; but the disposition of the cavalry, as\r\nwill be seen, was altogether different from that of the insurgent\r\narmy. The first line consisted of the regiments of Ligonier, Price,\r\nRoyal Scots, Pulteney, Cholmondeley, and Wolfe, and the second\r\nof those of Battereau, Barrel, Fleming, Munro, and Blakeney. The\r\nnames of the regiments are here given according to the order they\r\nstood, beginning with the right. Behind the right of the second\r\nline, Howard’s regiment was stationed as a reserve. The Glasgow\r\nregiment, and other Lowland militia, were posted as another body of\r\nreserve, near some cottages behind the left of the dragoons; and\r\nthe Argyleshire men were placed at some distance from the right of\r\nthe royal army, to watch the motions of the forces under Lord John\r\nDrummond, who seemed, before they joined the two columns on the\r\nmoor, to threaten an attack upon the camp. The left of the dragoons\r\nwas directly opposite to Keppoch’s regiment, but by keeping large\r\nintervals between their squadrons, their right extended as far down\r\nas the centre of Lord Lovat’s regiment, which stood the third from\r\nthe left of the insurgent army. In consequence of this extension\r\nof the front line of the royal army, Lochiel’s regiment, which\r\nwas upon the left extremity of the opposite line, was outflanked\r\nby three of the royal regiments. With the exception of one or two\r\nregiments in each line, which, by their proximity to the top of the\r\nmoor, had reached ground somewhat level, the rest of the king’s\r\ninfantry stood on the declivity of the hill, and so great was the\r\ninequality of the ground, that the opposite wings alone of either\r\narmy were visible to each other. Between the right of the royal\r\narmy and the left of that of the insurgents, there was a ravine,\r\nwhich, beginning on the declivity of the hill, directly opposite the\r\ncentre of the Fraser battalion, ran in a northerly direction, and\r\ngradually widened and deepened till it reached the plain. The right\r\nof the royal army was commanded by Major-general Huske, the centre by\r\nHawley himself, and the left by Brigadier Cholmondeley, but the three\r\nregiments of dragoons on the left were under the immediate command\r\nof Lieutenant-colonel Ligonier. The colonel’s own dragoon regiment,\r\nformerly Gardiner’s, was stationed on the extreme left. Hamilton’s\r\ndragoons were posted on the right, and Cobham’s in the centre.\r\n\r\nIn the action about to commence, the combatants on both sides were\r\ndeprived of the use of their artillery. The Highlanders, from the\r\nrapidity of their march, left their cannon behind them, and those\r\nbelonging to Hawley’s army, consisting of ten pieces, stuck fast in\r\na swamp at the bottom of the hill. The royal forces were greatly\r\nsuperior to the Highlanders in numbers, but the latter had the\r\nadvantage of the ground, and having the wind and the rain in their\r\nbacks, were not annoyed to the same extent as their adversaries, who\r\nreceived the wind and rain directly in their faces.[1107]\r\n\r\nThe right wing of the Highland army and Hawley’s cavalry had remained\r\nupwards of a quarter of an hour within musket-shot of each other,\r\nwaiting the coming up of the other forces, when General Hawley sent\r\nan order to Colonel Ligonier, to attack the Highlanders. At the time\r\nthis order was despatched, some of his troops destined for the centre\r\nof his second line had not reached their posts, but Hawley, impatient\r\nof delay, and led astray by a mistaken though prevalent idea, that\r\nthe Highlanders could not stand the shock of cavalry, resolved to\r\ncommence the action with the dragoons only. Ligonier, who appears\r\nto have entertained more correct notions on this subject than the\r\ngeneralissimo, was surprised at the order; but he proceeded to put it\r\nin execution.[1108]\r\n\r\nBefore advancing, Colonel Ligonier made several motions, with the\r\ndesign of drawing off the fire of the Highlanders, and riding in\r\namong them, and breaking their ranks; but they did not fire a shot.\r\nConjecturing that the dragoons were to be supported by a body\r\nof infantry in their rear, Lord George Murray, to whom no such\r\ndescription of force was discernible at the time, sent Colonel Roy\r\nStuart and Anderson, the guide at the battle of Preston, forward\r\non horseback to reconnoitre. On receiving their report that they\r\nhad not observed any foot, Lord George resolved to anticipate his\r\nopponent Ligonier, by attacking the dragoons. Accordingly he gave\r\norders to the right wing to advance slowly, and, passing along the\r\nline, desired the men to keep their ranks, and not to fire till he\r\ngave them orders. Lord George, with his sword in his hand, and his\r\ntarget on his arm, then took his station at the head of the first\r\nline, which, with the second, continued to advance in good order. The\r\ndragoons, on observing the approach of the Highlanders, also began\r\nto move forward, and were instantly at the full trot. They came up\r\nin very good order, till within pistol-shot of the first line of\r\nthe Highlanders, when Lord George Murray presented his piece as the\r\nsignal to fire. The Highlanders, thereupon, discharged a volley with\r\nsuch precision and effect, that the dragoons were entirely broken,\r\nand many of them were killed and wounded. Hamilton’s and Ligonier’s\r\nregiments instantly wheeled about, and galloped down the hill, riding\r\nover and trampling upon some of their party, and carrying along with\r\nthem a company of the Glasgow regiment. Cobham’s regiment, which had\r\njust returned from foreign service, however, stood its ground for\r\nsome time, and breaking through the first line of the Highlanders,\r\ntrampled many of them under foot. A singular combat then ensued.\r\nDeprived of the use of their broadswords, some of the Highlanders,\r\nwho lay stretched on the ground, had recourse to their dirks, which\r\nthey plunged into the bellies of the horses. Others seized the riders\r\nby their clothes, and dragging them from their horses, stabbed them\r\nwith the same weapon. In this mêlée the chief of Clanranald made a\r\nnarrow escape, having been trodden down, and before he was able to\r\nrise a horse fell dead upon him, the weight of which prevented him\r\nfrom extricating himself without assistance. While in this perilous\r\nsituation, he saw a dismounted dragoon and a Highlander struggling\r\nnear him, and for a time the issue seemed doubtful. The anxiety of\r\nthe chief, whose own preservation seemed to depend on the success\r\nof his clansman, was soon relieved, when he saw the Highlander\r\nthrow his antagonist, and instantly despatch him with his dirk. The\r\nHighlander thereupon came up to the prostrate chief, and drew him\r\nfrom under the horse. The dragoons, unable any longer to contend with\r\nthe Macdonalds, galloped off to the right between the two armies,\r\nand received the fire of the remainder of the front line of the\r\nHighlanders, as they went along, as far down as Lord Lovat’s regiment.\r\n\r\nAfraid that, after the flight of the dragoons, the Highlanders\r\nwould commence a disorderly pursuit, Lord George Murray ordered\r\nthe Macdonalds of Keppoch to keep their ranks, and sent a similar\r\norder to the two other Macdonald regiments. But notwithstanding this\r\ncommand of the lieutenant-general, and the efforts of the officers,\r\nwho, with drawn swords and cocked pistols, endeavoured to restrain\r\nthem from an immediate pursuit, a considerable number of the men of\r\nthese two regiments, along with all the regiments on their left,\r\nas far down as the head of the ravine, rushed down the hill in\r\npursuit of the enemy. They were received with a volley from some of\r\nthe regiments on the left of the first line of the royal army, and\r\nhaving returned the fire, the Highlanders threw away their muskets,\r\nand drawing their swords, rushed in upon the enemy. Unable to resist\r\nthe impetuosity of the attack, the whole of the royal army, with\r\nthe exception of Barrel’s regiment, and part of the regiments of\r\nPrice and Ligonier, gave way. At first the Highlanders supposed that\r\nthe rout was complete, and General Hawley himself, who was huddled\r\noff the field among a confused mass of horse and foot, was of the\r\nsame opinion; but the Highlanders were undeceived, when coming near\r\nthe bottom of the hill, they received a fire in flank from these\r\nregiments, which threw them into great disorder, and obliged them to\r\nretire up the hill. The Camerons and the Stuarts, who were on the\r\nopposite side of the ravine, suffered also from the fire of this\r\nbody, and were likewise obliged to fall back.[1109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Battle of Falkirk.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord George Murray, who observed the confusion in Hawley’s\r\narmy, was moving down the hill with the Athole men in good order,\r\nfor the purpose of attacking it on its retreat. He had sent orders\r\nby Colonel Ker, to the reserve to advance on the left, and having\r\nmet scattered parties of the Macdonalds returning up the hill, he\r\nendeavoured to rally them as he marched down, but without effect.\r\nBefore reaching the bottom of the hill, Lord George obtained a\r\ncomplete view of the disorder which prevailed in the enemy’s ranks.\r\nWith the exception of the three regiments of foot, and Cobham’s\r\ndragoons, which were marching rapidly towards Falkirk, and covering\r\nthe rear of the other fugitives, the remainder of the royal army was\r\nrunning off to the right and left, by forties and fifties; but as\r\nLord George had not more than 600 or 700 men with him, and as the\r\nrest of the Highland army was scattered over the face of the hill,\r\nhe resolved to halt at its foot. Here he was joined by the Irish\r\npiquets, and by Lord John Drummond, and other officers. Some of the\r\nofficers advised a retreat towards Dunipace, that the men might\r\nobtain shelter during the night from the rain, which was excessive;\r\nbut his lordship strongly advised that they should endeavour to\r\nobtain possession of Falkirk immediately, while the confusion lasted,\r\ndeclaring that he would either lie in the town or in paradise. While\r\nthis discussion was going on, the prince arrived, and approved highly\r\nof the views of his lieutenant-general. Charles was advised, in the\r\nmeantime, to retire to some house on the face of the hill, till the\r\nresult of the attempt should be known.\r\n\r\nIt was now almost dark, and as the fires of Hawley’s camp indicated\r\nan apparent intention on his part to retain possession of the town,\r\nthe officers assembled at the bottom of the hill, considered it\r\nunsafe to advance farther, till they had ascertained the state\r\nof matters. To procure intelligence, Mr. Drummond, eldest son of\r\nLord Strathallan, and Oliphant, younger of Gask, entered Falkirk,\r\ndisguised as peasants, and having ascertained that General Hawley,\r\nafter issuing orders to set fire to his tents, had abandoned the\r\ntown, and was retreating on Linlithgow, they immediately returned to\r\ntheir friends with the information. The body collected at the foot\r\nof the hill now advanced upon Falkirk, in three detachments; one\r\nof which, under Lochiel, entered the town at the west end, another\r\nunder Lord George Murray, at the centre, and the other, under Lord\r\nJohn Drummond, by a lane called the Cow wynd, at the east end. Some\r\nstragglers, who had remained behind, were taken prisoners, one of\r\nwhom fired at Lord John Drummond, when about to seize him, and\r\nwounded him slightly in the arm. Information of the occupation of the\r\ntown, by the Highlanders, was sent to the prince, who immediately\r\nrepaired thither, and took up his residence in a house which fronts\r\nthe steeple.\r\n\r\nSo great was the disorder that existed in the Highland army,\r\noccasioned by the rash and impetuous conduct of the Macdonalds,\r\nin leaving their ranks, and by the check received from the three\r\nregiments, that it was about four hours after the close of the\r\nbattle, which lasted scarcely twenty minutes, before the greater\r\npart of the army had any information of the result. The Highlanders\r\nwere dispersed in every direction over the hill, and the different\r\nclans were mingled together pell-mell. The confusion was greatly\r\nincreased by the obscurity of the night, and for several hours they\r\nwandered over the moor, uncertain whether they were to meet friends\r\nor foes. Early in the evening, many of the Highlanders had retired\r\nfrom the field of battle, either thinking it lost, or intending to\r\nseek shelter from the weather. During this disorder, the fate of\r\nthe prince himself was equally unknown. Early in the action, he\r\nhad sent one of his aides-de-camp with an order; but, on returning\r\nwith an answer, the prince was no more to be seen. The officer, in\r\nsearching for him, fell in with the prince’s own life-guards, drawn\r\nup in order of battle, near a cottage on the edge of the hill, with\r\ntheir commander, Lord Elcho, at their head; but his lordship could\r\ngive him no information respecting the prince. Lord Lewis Gordon, and\r\nseveral chiefs of the clans, ignorant even of the fate of their own\r\nregiments, met together at the seat of Mr. Primrose, at Dunipace,\r\nwhere they were joined by other officers all equally ignorant of the\r\nresult of the battle. At length, about eight o’clock in the evening,\r\nall doubt was removed from the minds of this party, by the arrival\r\nof Macdonald of Lochgarry, who announced that the Highland army\r\nhad obtained a complete victory,--that the English were flying in\r\ndisorder towards Edinburgh,--and that the prince was in possession\r\nof Falkirk, and in the quarters which had been occupied by General\r\nHawley. He added, that he had been sent to Dunipace, by the prince,\r\nwith orders to the rest of the army to repair to Falkirk next morning\r\nby break of day.[1110]\r\n\r\nPartly from the darkness of the evening, and partly from the\r\nimpossibility of collecting a sufficiently numerous body of the\r\nHighlanders together, the prince was unable to continue the pursuit.\r\nAbout 1,500 of them had entered the town, but so intent were they\r\nupon securing the spoils of the English camp, that it was with\r\ndifficulty that sufficient guards could be got for the town, and the\r\nprince’s person, during the night. Besides, the Highlanders had been\r\nupon their legs for twelve hours, without receiving any refreshment,\r\nand were completely drenched to the skin, so that even had pursuit\r\nbeen otherwise practicable, they must have speedily desisted from\r\nexcessive fatigue, and might probably have suffered from the dragoons\r\nwhich covered the rear of Hawley’s foot.\r\n\r\nIn addition to seven pieces of cannon which had been abandoned by\r\nthe captain of the train at the commencement of the action, Hawley\r\nleft behind him all his baggage, and a large quantity of military\r\nstores. Owing to the rain, very few of his tents, to which he had\r\nset fire, were consumed. Besides the _matériel_ of the royal\r\narmy, several standards and stands of colours fell into the hands\r\nof the victors. According to the official returns, the loss of\r\nthe English, in killed, wounded, and missing, was 280, including\r\na considerable number of officers; but these returns are supposed\r\nto be greatly underrated.[1111] There were sixteen officers killed\r\non the government side, viz., Colonel Sir Robert Munro of Foulis;\r\nLieutenant-colonel Whitney of Ligonier’s regiment of dragoons;\r\nLieutenant-colonel Biggar of Munro’s regiment; Lieutenant-colonel\r\nPowell of Cholmondeley’s regiment; five captains and one lieutenant\r\nof Wolfe’s; and four captains and two lieutenants of Blakeney’s\r\nregiment. Sir Robert’s regiment, which consisted chiefly of his\r\nown clan, had particularly distinguished itself at the battle of\r\nFontenoy; but on the present occasion it partook of the panic which\r\nhad seized the other regiments on the left, and fled, leaving its\r\ncolonel alone and unprotected. In this situation Sir Robert was\r\nattacked by six men of Lochiel’s regiment, and, for some time\r\ngallantly defended himself with his half-pike. He killed two of\r\nhis assailants, and would probably have despatched more, had not\r\na seventh come up and shot him in the groin with a pistol. On\r\nfalling, the Highlander struck him two blows across the face with\r\nhis broadsword, which killed him on the spot. Dr. Munro of Obsdale,\r\nhis brother, who, from fraternal affection, had attended Sir Robert\r\nto the field to afford him any medical assistance he might require,\r\nwas standing close by his brother when he fell, and shared his fate\r\nat the hands of the same Highlander, who, after firing a pistol\r\ninto his breast, cut him down with his claymore. The bodies of the\r\ntwo brothers having been recognised the next day, were honourably\r\ninterred in one grave in the churchyard of Falkirk in presence of all\r\nthe chiefs.[1112]\r\n\r\nThe loss on the side of the Highlanders amounted only to about 40\r\nmen, among whom were two or three captains, and some subaltern\r\nofficers. They had, however, nearly double that number wounded.\r\nBesides Lord John Drummond, young Lochiel and his brother, and Dr.\r\nArchibald Cameron, were slightly wounded. Hawley’s army could boast\r\nof only one prisoner, who fell into their hands by mere accident.\r\nThis was Major Macdonald of Keppoch’s regiment, cousin to the chief.\r\nHaving pursued the flying English farther than any other person,\r\nhe was in the act of returning to his corps, when in his way he\r\nobserved, in the dusk of the evening, a body of men at some distance\r\nstanding in a hollow near the bottom of the hill. Imagining this\r\nbody to be Lord John Drummond’s regiment and the French piquets, he\r\nran forward towards the party with his sword still drawn, and when\r\nnear them, cried out with a feeling of strong emotion, “Gentlemen,\r\nwhat are you doing here? Why don’t ye follow after the dogs, and\r\npursue them?” Scarcely, however, had he uttered these words, when\r\nhe discovered that the body he accosted was an English regiment,\r\n(Barrel’s,) and the cry, “Here is a rebel! here is a rebel!” at once\r\nmet his ears. Escape being impossible, the major, thinking that he\r\nwould not be discovered by the colour of his white cockade, which\r\nwas quite dirty with the rain and the smoke of the firing, pretended\r\nthat he was one of their own Campbells; but General Huske observed\r\nthat it was easy to discover what the prisoner was by his sword,\r\nthe blade of which was covered over with blood and hair. Huske gave\r\norders “to shoot the dog instantly,” and a party of musketeers\r\nimmediately presented their pieces at the major’s breast; but Lord\r\nRobert Ker generously interposed, and, beating down the muskets,\r\nsaved the major’s life. The general having refused to receive the\r\nmajor’s arms, they were accepted by Lord Robert. When pulling his\r\npistol from his belt, previously to surrendering his arms, Huske was\r\nalarmed, and exclaimed with an oath, that “the dog” was going to\r\nshoot him; but Macdonald indignantly observed, that he was more of\r\na gentleman than to do any such thing, and that he was only pulling\r\noff his pistol to deliver it up.[1113] The major was carried to\r\nEdinburgh, and committed to the castle next day, and, after a few\r\nmonths’ confinement, tried, convicted, and executed.\r\n\r\nThe victory would have been complete by the utter annihilation of the\r\nEnglish army, had the prince taken the usual precautions to preserve\r\nunity of action among the different sections of his undisciplined\r\nhost. Early in the morning, Lord George Murray had submitted a plan\r\nof the battle to his royal highness, and requested that he would name\r\nthe officers that were to command, and assign them their different\r\nstations; but with the exception of Lord George himself, who was\r\nappointed to march at the head of the army, and who consequently had\r\nthe command of the right wing, no other appointment appears to have\r\nbeen made. It seems to have been understood by Charles himself, that\r\nLord John Drummond was to have commanded the left wing; but if such\r\nwas the case, Lord John could have obtained no distinct notification\r\nthereof, as he never appeared in his place. It is maintained by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, that had there been an officer in command on the\r\nleft, to have brought up two or three battalions from the second\r\nline, or from the _corps de reserve_ so as to have extended the\r\nfirst line still farther to the left, and thus to have faced the\r\nEnglish regiments which outflanked them, the whole of Hawley’s foot\r\nmust have been taken or destroyed, and that few even of the horse\r\nwould have escaped, as the Highlanders would not have given over\r\nthe chase till they had reached Linlithgow,--and that, in short,\r\nhad the three regiments which outlined the Highlanders been faced,\r\nthe battle would not have lasted ten minutes, as these regiments,\r\ninstead of keeping their ground, pouring in part of their fire on the\r\nleft flank of the Highlanders, and compelling those who attacked the\r\nright and centre of Hawley’s foot sword in hand to retire to their\r\nformer ground, would have given way with the rest of the main body.\r\nIn the absence of Lord John Drummond, it was the duty of O’Sullivan,\r\nwho, as adjutant-general, was chiefly intrusted by the prince with\r\nthe formation of the left wing, to have brought up men for the\r\npurpose of extending the line; but instead of riding along the line\r\nas he should have done before the action, none of the officers of\r\nthe first line of the Highland army saw him till the battle was\r\nover.[1114] While Lord John Drummond could not but be sensible of the\r\nerror which had been committed on the left, he retaliated upon the\r\nlieutenant-general, by ascribing the escape of Hawley’s army to the\r\nconduct of Lord George himself, who prevented part of the right wing\r\nfrom joining in the charge upon the foot, after the flight of the\r\ndragoons.\r\n\r\nThe English imputed their defeat chiefly to the violence of the\r\nstorm, which was full in their faces during the action; but this,\r\nthough certainly a formidable difficulty, was not the only one they\r\nhad to encounter. To a combination of unfortunate circumstances, and\r\nnot to any particular incident, is to be ascribed the result which\r\nensued; but mainly to Hawley’s ignorance of the resistance which the\r\nHighlanders could oppose to cavalry. He had been major of Evans’s\r\ndragoons at the battle of Sheriffmuir, where that regiment and the\r\nScots Greys, led by the Duke of Argyle, after getting over a morass,\r\nwhich the intense frost of the preceding night had rendered passable,\r\nattacked the flank of the insurgent army, which conceived itself\r\nsecure from that quarter, and rode down, and drove off the field\r\nseveral regiments of Highlanders. Imagining from this precedent,\r\nthat the Highlanders could not withstand the charge of cavalry, he\r\nobserved one day in a company of officers in Flanders, who were\r\ntalking of the battle of Preston, that “_he_ knew the Highlanders;\r\nthey were good militia; but he was certain that they could not\r\nstand against a charge of dragoons, who attacked them well.”[1115]\r\nUnder this impression he began the battle with his dragoons, before\r\nhis infantry had been fully formed into line; but he soon saw the\r\nconsequences of his indiscretion.\r\n\r\nThough the field of battle is about twenty-six miles distant from\r\nEdinburgh, the intelligence of Hawley’s defeat was known there before\r\nnine o’clock at night, by the arrival of some spectators who had\r\nwitnessed the action, and by some of the dragoons who, impelled by\r\nfear, did not halt till they reached the capital. The English general\r\npassed the evening of the battle at Linlithgow, and marched next\r\nmorning with the mass of his army to Edinburgh, where he arrived\r\nabout four o’clock in the afternoon. A prey to disappointment and\r\nvexation, the appearance of Hawley on the morning after the battle is\r\nsaid by an observer to have been most wretched, and even worse than\r\nthat of Cope a few hours after his “scuffle,” when the same person\r\nsaw him at Fala on his retreat to Berwick.[1116]\r\n\r\nBefore the return of Hawley’s army, the greatest consternation\r\nprevailed among the friends of the government at Edinburgh from the\r\nreports of the fugitives, who brought accounts of the total rout and\r\ndispersion of the army, exaggerated by the relation of circumstances\r\nwhich had no existence, save in their own terrified imaginations;\r\nbut the arrival of the greater part of the army served to dissipate\r\ntheir fears in some measure. Since the commencement of the rebellion,\r\nhowever, to its final close, never were the apprehensions of the\r\nsupporters of the existing government more alarmingly excited than\r\non the present occasion, when they saw the veteran troops, who had\r\nfought the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, return from Falkirk\r\ndiscomfited by a body of undisciplined mountaineers whom they had\r\nbeen taught to despise. The Jacobites, on the other hand, exulted at\r\nthe victory, and gave expression to their feelings by openly deriding\r\nthe vanquished.[1117]\r\n\r\nThe prince spent the 18th, the day after the battle, at Falkirk;\r\nbut, as the rain fell in torrents during the greater part of that\r\nday, few of the officers quitted their lodgings. Notwithstanding\r\nthe unfavourable state of the weather, the slain were interred by\r\norder of the prince, and a considerable body of Highlanders marched\r\nto Linlithgow, of which they took possession. Charles now took the\r\nadvice of his friends as to the use he should make of his victory.\r\nSome were for following up the blow which had been struck, and\r\ndriving Hawley out of Scotland. Others were for marching directly to\r\nLondon before the enemy had time to recover from their consternation.\r\nThey argued that it was not to be supposed that Hawley would again\r\nface the prince and his victorious army till he should receive new\r\nreinforcements; that even then the troops which had been beaten\r\nwould communicate terror to the rest; and that the prince’s army,\r\nflushed with victory, could never fight with greater advantages on\r\ntheir side. There were others, however, who thought differently,\r\nand maintained that the capture of Stirling castle was the chief\r\nobject at present; that it had never been before heard of that an\r\narmy employed in a siege, having beaten those that came to raise it,\r\nhad made any other use of their victory than to take the fortress in\r\nthe first place; that any other conduct would argue a great deal of\r\nlevity; and that it was of the utmost importance to obtain possession\r\nof the castle, as it opened an easy and safe communication between\r\nthe prince, (wherever he might happen to be,) and his friends in\r\nthe north. This last view was supported by M. Mirabelle de Gordon,\r\na French engineer of Scotch extraction, who gave the prince the\r\nstrongest assurances that the castle would be forced to surrender in\r\na few days, and added, moreover, that if the prince went immediately\r\nupon another expedition he would be obliged to sacrifice all his\r\nheavy artillery which he could not carry with him into England.[1118]\r\nThe opinion of an individual, decorated with an order, and who was\r\nconsequently considered a person of experience and talents, had\r\ngreat weight with the prince, who, accordingly, resolved to reduce\r\nthe castle of Stirling before commencing any other operations; but\r\nCharles discovered, when too late, that Mirabelle’s knowledge as an\r\nengineer was extremely limited, and that he had neither judgment to\r\nplan nor knowledge to direct the operations of a siege. This person,\r\nwhose figure was as eccentric as his mind, was called, in derision,\r\nMr. Admirable by the Highlanders.[1119]\r\n\r\nDuring the prince’s short stay at Falkirk, a misunderstanding took\r\nplace between a party of the Camerons and Lord Kilmarnock, which\r\nhad nearly proved fatal to that nobleman. As this incident affords\r\na remarkable illustration of clanship, the particulars cannot fail\r\nto be interesting. Lord Kilmarnock, having passed the evening of\r\nthe battle in his house at Callander, came next morning to Falkirk\r\nwith a party of his men, having in their custody some Edinburgh\r\nvolunteers, who, having fallen behind Hawley’s army in its march to\r\nLinlithgow, had been taken and carried to Callander House. Leaving\r\nthe prisoners and their guard standing in the street, opposite to\r\nthe house where the prince lodged, his lordship went up stairs and\r\npresented to him a list of the prisoners, among whom was Mr. Home,\r\nthe author of the Tragedy of _Douglas_ and the _History of the\r\nRebellion_. Charles opened the window to survey the prisoners, and\r\nwhile engaged in conversation with Lord Kilmarnock about them, as\r\nis supposed, with the paper in his hand, a soldier in the uniform\r\nof the Scots Royals, carrying a musket and wearing a black cockade,\r\nappeared in the street, and approached in the direction of the\r\nprince. The volunteers who observed this man coming up the street\r\nwere extremely surprised, and, thinking that his intention in coming\r\nforward was to shoot the prince, expected every moment to see him\r\nraise his piece and fire. Observing the volunteers, who were within a\r\nfew yards of the prince, all looking in one direction, Charles also\r\nlooked the same way, and seeing the soldier approach appeared amazed,\r\nand, calling Lord Kilmarnock, pointed towards the soldier. His\r\nlordship instantly descended into the street, and finding the soldier\r\nimmediately opposite to the window where Charles stood, the earl went\r\nup to him, and striking the hat off the soldier’s head, trampled\r\nthe black cockade under his feet. At that instant a Highlander\r\nrushed from the opposite side of the street, and, laying hands on\r\nLord Kilmarnock, pushed him violently back. Kilmarnock immediately\r\npulled out a pistol, and presented it at the Highlander’s head; the\r\nHighlander in his turn drew his dirk, and held it close to the earl’s\r\nbreast. They stood in this position about half a minute, when a crowd\r\nof Highlanders rushed in and drove Lord Kilmarnock away. The man with\r\nthe dirk in his hand then took up the hat, put it on the soldier’s\r\nhead, and the Highlanders marched off with him in triumph.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary scene surprised the prisoners, and they solicited\r\nan explanation from a Highland officer who stood near them. The\r\nofficer told them that the soldier in the royal uniform was a\r\nCameron: “Yesterday,” continued he, “when your army was defeated he\r\njoined his clan; the Camerons received him with joy, and told him\r\nthat he should wear his arms, his clothes, and every thing else, till\r\nhe was provided with other clothes and other arms. The Highlander\r\nwho first interposed and drew his dirk on Lord Kilmarnock is the\r\nsoldier’s brother; the crowd who rushed in are the Camerons, many of\r\nthem his near relations; and, in my opinion,” continued the officer,\r\n“no colonel nor general in the prince’s army can take that cockade\r\nout of his hat, except Lochiel himself.”[1120]\r\n\r\nAn accident occurred about the same time, which had a most\r\nprejudicial effect in thinning the ranks of the Highland army. The\r\nHighlanders, pleased with the fire-arms they had picked up upon the\r\nfield of battle, were frequently handling and discharging them.\r\nAfraid of accidents, the officers had issued orders prohibiting this\r\nabuse, but to no purpose. One of Keppoch’s men had secured a musket\r\nwhich had been twice loaded. Not aware of this circumstance, he fired\r\noff the piece, after extracting one of the balls, in the direction of\r\nsome officers who were standing together on the street of Falkirk.\r\nThe other ball unfortunately entered the body of Æneas Macdonell,\r\nsecond son of Glengary, who commanded the Glengary regiment. He\r\nsurvived only a short time, and, satisfied of the innocence of the\r\nman that shot him, begged with his last breath that he might not\r\nsuffer. To soothe the Glengary men under their loss, the prince\r\nevinced by external acts that he participated in their feelings, and,\r\nto show his respect for the memory of this brave and estimable youth,\r\nattended his funeral as chief mourner; but nothing the prince was\r\nable to do could prevent some of the men, who felt more acutely than\r\nothers the loss of the representative of their chief, from returning\r\nto their homes.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 19th, the prince returned to Bannockburn, leaving Lord\r\nGeorge Murray with the clans at Falkirk. At Bannockburn he issued, by\r\nmeans of a printing-press which he had carried with him from Glasgow,\r\nan account of the battle of Falkirk, a modest document when compared\r\nwith that of Hawley, who gravely asserted that had it not been for\r\nthe rain his army would have continued in his camp, “being masters of\r\nthe field of battle!”\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Falkirk, the Duke of Perth again summoned the\r\ncastle of Stirling to surrender, but the governor returned the same\r\nanswer he had sent to the first message. The prince therefore resumed\r\nthe siege on his return to his former head quarters, and fixed his\r\ntroops in their previous cantonments. An able mathematician, named\r\nGrant, who had been employed many years with the celebrated Cassini,\r\nin the observatory at Paris, and who had conducted the siege of\r\nCarlisle, had at the commencement of the siege communicated to\r\nthe prince a plan of attack, by opening trenches and establishing\r\nbatteries in the church-yard. He had assured the prince that this\r\nwas the only place where they could find a parallel almost on a\r\nlevel with the batteries of the castle; and that if a breach were\r\neffected in the half-moon, which defended the entry to the castle,\r\nfrom a battery in the church-yard, the rubbish of the work would fill\r\nthe ditch, and render an assault practicable through the breach.\r\nIn consequence, however, of a remonstrance from the inhabitants,\r\nwho stated that the fire from the castle in the direction of the\r\nchurch-yard would reduce the greater part of the town to ashes, the\r\nprince abandoned this plan, and consulted M. Mirabelle, with the\r\nview of ascertaining whether there was any other practicable mode of\r\nmaking an attack on the castle with effect. To borrow an expression\r\nof the Chevalier Johnstone, in reference to the conduct of Mirabelle\r\non this occasion, that it is always the distinctive mark of ignorance\r\nto find nothing difficult, not even the things that are impossible,\r\nthis eccentric person, without the least hesitation, immediately\r\nundertook to open the trenches on the Gowling or Gowan hill, a small\r\neminence to the north of the castle, about forty feet below its\r\nlevel.[1121]\r\n\r\nAs there were not above fifteen inches depth of earth above the rock,\r\nit became necessary to supply the want of earth with bags of wool and\r\nearth, an operation which occupied several days. On breaking ground a\r\nfire was opened on the trenches from the castle, which was renewed\r\nfrom time to time during the progress of the works, and was answered\r\nfrom the trenches; but the fire from the castle was not sufficiently\r\nstrong to hinder the operations, which, from the commanding position\r\nof the castle guns, could have been easily prevented. The design of\r\nGeneral Blakeney in thus allowing the besiegers to raise their works,\r\nwas, it is understood, to create a belief among them, that the castle\r\nwould not be tenable against their batteries, and by this impression\r\nto induce the Highland army to remain before the fortress till Hawley\r\nshould be again in sufficiently strong condition to advance from\r\nEdinburgh. Having, on the evening of the 28th, completed the battery\r\non the Gowan hill, which consisted of three pieces of cannon, the\r\nrebels quickly raised another on a small rocky eminence called the\r\nLadies’ hill, on the south-east of the town. They were both unmasked\r\non the morning of the 29th, and immediately opened with a brisk fire,\r\nwhich shattered two of the embrasures of the castle. As the guns of\r\nthe batteries were pointed upwards, the balls generally went over the\r\ncastle, and the few that struck the walls produced little effect; but\r\nthe case was totally different with the besieged, who, from their\r\nelevated situation, from which they could see even the shoe-buckles\r\nof the French artillerymen behind the batteries, poured down a\r\ndestructive fire upon the besiegers from two batteries mounting\r\ntogether thirteen pieces, which dismounted the besiegers’ guns, broke\r\ntheir carriages, and forced them to retire with considerable loss.\r\nThus defeated in their attack, the rebels abandoned the siege after\r\nwasting three weeks in a fruitless attempt to obtain possession of\r\na post, which could have been of no essential service to them, and\r\nbefore which they lost some of their best men, chiefly among the\r\nFrench piquets, whom least of all they could spare.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1077] _Culloden Papers_, p. 263.\r\n\r\n[1078] Idem, p. 461.\r\n\r\n[1079] _Culloden Papers_, p. 461.\r\n\r\n[1080] _Culloden Papers_, p. 462.\r\n\r\n[1081] _Kirkconnel MS._ Home, 159.\r\n\r\n[1082] Home, p. 160.\r\n\r\n[1083] Home, p 162.\r\n\r\n[1084] _Culloden Papers_, p. 264.\r\n\r\n[1085] Idem, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[1086] _Scots Magazine_, vol. viii. p. 32.\r\n\r\n[1087] “The zeal (says General Wightman) which the inhabitants\r\nhave shown in accommodating the troops, will help to ridd us of\r\nthe suspicion of Jacobitism; but we have a pack of vermin (Qu.\r\nJacobites?) within our walls, who take unaccountable libertys, of\r\nwhom I hope we shall be for ever ridd ere long.”--_Culloden Papers_,\r\np. 470.\r\n\r\n[1088] _Culloden Papers_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n[1089] Boyse, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[1090] Household Book in _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[1091] Boyse, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[1092] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1093] Now embodied in the United Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n[1094] _History of Stirling_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[1095] _History of Stirling_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[1096] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[1097] General Hawley, alluding to this affair, in a letter to the\r\nlord-president, 12th Jan. 1745-6, says, “We have had a small brush\r\nwith them (the Highlanders) yesterday at Airth, up the Forth with\r\n300 men in boats; killed and wounded about fifty, with their chief\r\nFrench engineer; crippled two of their guns, burnt all their boats,\r\nand hindered their transporting their great cannon from Alloway for\r\nsome days.”--_Culloden Papers_, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[1098] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 78. _Kirkconnel MS._ _Scots Magazine_,\r\nvol. viii.\r\n\r\n[1099] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[1100] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1101] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 79. _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1102] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1103] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 120.\r\n\r\n[1104] Home, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[1105] There was another battalion of the Farquharsons under\r\nFarquharson of Monaltry, which, having the charge of the cannon\r\nbelonging to the insurgent army, was not in the battle.\r\n\r\n[1106] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 501. _Kirkconnel MS._ Home, p.\r\n168. _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[1107] Some accounts make Hawley’s forces of all descriptions at\r\n15,000, being nearly double the number of the Highlanders, who\r\namounted to 8,000; but these statements are exaggerated.

The duke was beloved by the\r\narmy, and enjoyed its confidence, circumstances which rendered him\r\npeculiarly fitted to supersede Hawley, who, after his return to\r\nEdinburgh, had by his severities become unpopular with the soldiers.\r\nAnother reason for putting the duke at the head of the army opposed\r\nto Prince Charles, was the favourable effect which, it was supposed,\r\nthe appearance of a prince of the blood would have upon the minds of\r\nthe people of Scotland, and which, it was expected, would neutralise\r\nthe influence of his kinsman. But apart from his rank as the son of\r\nthe king, Prince William had little to recommend him to the especial\r\nnotice of a nation, rather fastidious in its respect for princes.\r\nHis conduct while in Scotland showed that humanity, the brightest\r\nornament which can adorn the soldier hero, had no place in the\r\ncatalogue of his virtues. With a cruelty, partly the result, perhaps,\r\nof the military school in which he was trained,[1122] and which\r\nfortunately has few parallels among civilised nations, he pursued his\r\nunfortunate victims, the misguided but chivalrous adherents of the\r\nfallen dynasty, with a relentless perseverance which disgusted even\r\nhis own partisans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM DUKE OF CUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\nA. Fullarton & C^o. London & Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nHaving received his instructions, the duke lost no time in preparing\r\nfor his journey. He left London on the 25th of January, attended by\r\nLord Cathcart, Lord Bury, Colonels Conway and York his aides-de-camp,\r\nand arrived at Holyrood House on the 30th. He was waited upon by the\r\nstate-officers, the magistrates of the city, the professors of the\r\nuniversity, and the clergy, all of whom were graciously received.\r\nHis royal highness was presented with the freedom of the city in a\r\ngold box. In the afternoon he held a sort of drawing-room, which was\r\nattended by a considerable number of ladies very richly dressed.\r\nThe most conspicuous among them was a Miss Ker, who wore a busk,\r\nat the top of which was a crown done in bugles, surrounded with\r\nthis inscription, “Britain’s Hero, William, Duke of Cumberland.” To\r\ncelebrate his arrival the city was illuminated in the evening, but\r\nalthough the Jacobites, from prudential motives, concurred in this\r\ndemonstration, their windows were broken by the mob.[1124]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day the duke inspected the army. His appearance\r\nrevived the spirits of the soldiers, who, it is said, desired\r\nnothing so much as an opportunity of wiping away the disgrace of\r\ntheir late defeat. Such being the favourable disposition of the\r\ntroops, it was resolved in a council of war held in the evening to\r\nmarch next morning to the relief of Stirling castle. Accordingly,\r\nearly in the morning the army, which, by recent reinforcements, had\r\nbeen increased to fourteen battalions of foot, and four regiments\r\nof dragoons, besides the Argyleshire men, left Edinburgh in two\r\ndivisions, preceded by Hamilton’s and Ligonier’s dragoons. One of\r\nthese divisions, comprising eight battalions, at the head of which\r\nthe duke was to place himself, proceeded towards Linlithgow, and the\r\nother, consisting of six battalions under the command of Brigadier\r\nMordaunt, marched in the direction of Borrowstownness. The duke\r\nhimself left Holyrood House at nine o’clock in the morning, in\r\npresence of a large assemblage of citizens, who, from curiosity,\r\nhad collected before the palace at an early hour to witness his\r\ndeparture. He entered a splendid coach, which, with twelve beautiful\r\nhorses, had been presented to him by the Earl of Hopetoun, and was\r\naccompanied in his progress through the city by many persons of\r\ndistinction, and by a crowd of citizens. On reaching Castlebarns, a\r\nplace about a quarter of a mile from the West-port, by which he left\r\nthe city, the duke mounted his horse, and taking off his hat thanked\r\nthe people for their attentions. He told them that he was in great\r\nhaste to fulfil the object of his mission, and concluded by wishing\r\nthem farewell. This short address was received with a loud huzza. The\r\nduke then took leave of the nobility and gentry who surrounded him,\r\nand at parting said, “Shall we not have one song?” He then began to\r\nsing an old Scottish song:--\r\n\r\n      “Will ye play me fair?\r\n      Highland laddie, Highland laddie.”\r\n\r\nBut before he had finished the first stanza he stretched forth his\r\nhand, and, putting spurs to his horse, went off at full gallop to\r\njoin the army.[1125]\r\n\r\nThe duke took up his quarters for the night at Linlithgow with the\r\neight battalions, and Mordaunt stopped at Borrowstowness with the\r\nother division. The dragoons were quartered in the adjacent villages,\r\nand the Argyleshire men were posted in front towards the river Avon.\r\nEarly next morning, the duke received intelligence that the main\r\nbody of the Highland army, quartered at Falkirk, had retired to\r\nthe Torwood, where, they gave out, they intended to make a stand.\r\nDetermined that no time should be lost in following the insurgents,\r\nthe duke, after reviewing his army in the morning, advanced\r\ntowards Falkirk. Several parties of the Highlanders, who were seen\r\nhovering on the hills between Falkirk and Linlithgow, retired with\r\nprecipitation on his approach; but some stragglers were brought in\r\nby his advanced scouts, who reported that the Highlanders, afraid to\r\nrisk another battle, on account of the increase of the royal army,\r\nand the diminution of their own by desertion, were repassing the\r\nForth in great confusion. Two great explosions, like the blowing up\r\nof magazines, which were heard from a distance, seemed to confirm\r\nthis intelligence. On reaching Falkirk, the duke found that all the\r\nwounded soldiers who had been made prisoners in the late action,\r\nhad been left behind by the insurgents in their retreat. His royal\r\nhighness halted at Falkirk with the main body of his army, and\r\nimmediately detached Brigadier Mordaunt with the Argyleshire men and\r\nall the dragoons, in pursuit of the Highlanders. The duke passed\r\nthe night in the house which Charles had occupied on the evening of\r\nthe late battle, and slept in the same bed on which the prince had\r\nreposed. Next morning Prince William marched to Stirling, of which\r\nBrigadier Mordaunt had taken possession the previous evening. He\r\ncomplimented General Blakeney on his defence of the castle, and was\r\ninformed by the latter that, had the siege continued much longer,\r\nhe (Blakeney) must have surrendered for want of ammunition and\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nIn his march the duke was accompanied by several officers of the\r\nEnglish army, who had been taken prisoners at Preston, and who, under\r\nthe pretence of being forcibly released by armed parties of country\r\npeople in Angus and Fife, had broken their parole, and returned to\r\nEdinburgh. The Duke of Cumberland, who appears to have thought it by\r\nno means dishonourable to break faith with rebels, not only absolved\r\nthese officers from their parole, but sent circulars to all the other\r\nofficers, who continued prisoners of war, releasing them from the\r\nsolemn obligation they had undertaken not to serve against Prince\r\nCharles for a certain time, requiring them to join their respective\r\nregiments, and threatening with the loss of their commissions such of\r\nthem as should refuse to return immediately to the service. Only a\r\nfew officers had the virtuous courage to refuse compliance, declaring\r\ntheir sense of the insult offered to men of an honourable profession,\r\nby remarking that the duke was master of their commissions, but not\r\nof their probity and honour.[1126]\r\n\r\nIt was not without considerable reluctance that Charles had been\r\ninduced to consent to a retreat. So late as the 28th of January, on\r\nwhich day he received information at Bannockburn that the Duke of\r\nCumberland was expected at Edinburgh in a day or two, he had sent\r\nSecretary Murray to Falkirk to acquaint Lord George Murray, that it\r\nwas his intention to advance and attack the Duke of Cumberland, when\r\nhe should reach Falkirk, and to request his lordship to remain there\r\ntill the duke came to Linlithgow. Lord George did not express any\r\ndisapprobation of Charles’s design, but immediately drew up a plan\r\nof the battle in contemplation, which he carried to Bannockburn, and\r\nshowed to Charles. The prince, who was in high spirits, expressed\r\nhimself much pleased with the plan, which differed in some respects\r\nfrom that he had sketched previous to the late battle; but, to his\r\nutter astonishment, he received a packet from Lord George Murray by\r\nan aide-de-camp, containing a representation by his lordship and all\r\nthe chiefs,[1127] who were with him at Falkirk, advising a retreat to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, after stating that they considered it their duty,\r\n“in this critical juncture,” to lay their opinions in the most\r\nrespectful manner before his royal highness, they proceeded to say,\r\nthat they were certain that a vast number of his troops had gone\r\nhome since the battle of Falkirk, and that, notwithstanding all the\r\nendeavours of the commanders of the different corps, they found that\r\nthe evil was hourly increasing, and that they had it not in their\r\npower to prevent it,--that as they were afraid Stirling castle could\r\nnot be taken so soon as was expected, they could, from the inequality\r\nof their numbers to that of the enemy, anticipate nothing but utter\r\ndestruction to the few troops that might remain behind, should the\r\nenemy advance before the castle fell into Prince Charles’s hands. For\r\nthese reasons, they gave it as their opinion, that the only way to\r\nextricate his royal highness, and those who remained with him, out of\r\nthe imminent danger which threatened them, was to retire immediately\r\nto the Highlands, where the army could be usefully employed the\r\nremainder of the winter in taking the forts in the north,--that they\r\nwere morally certain they could keep as many men together as would\r\nanswer that end, and would hinder the enemy from following them to\r\nthe mountains at that season of the year,--and that, in spring, they\r\nhad no doubt that an army of 10,000 effective Highlanders could be\r\nbrought together, who would follow his royal highness wherever he\r\nmight think proper. Such a plan, they maintained, would certainly\r\ndisconcert his enemies, and could not but be approved of by his royal\r\nhighness’s friends both at home and abroad, and that if a landing\r\nshould happen in the meantime, the Highlanders would immediately\r\nrise either to join the invaders, or to make a powerful diversion\r\nelsewhere. On considering the hard marches which the army had\r\nundergone, the season of the year, and the inclemency of the weather,\r\nhis royal highness, they said, as well as his allies abroad and his\r\nadherents at home, could not fail to approve of the proposal,--that\r\nthe greatest objection to the retreat was the difficulty of saving\r\nthe artillery, particularly the heavy cannon; but that it would be\r\nbetter that some of these were thrown into the Forth, than that\r\nhis royal highness and the flower of his army should be exposed to\r\nthe risk they inevitably would, should the proposed retreat not be\r\nagreed to, and put in execution without loss of time; and that they\r\nthought that it would be the greatest imprudence to risk the whole\r\non so unequal a chance, when there were such hopes of succour from\r\nabroad, besides the resources his royal highness would have from\r\nhis adherents at home. In conclusion, they informed the prince that\r\nthey had just been apprised, that numbers of their people had gone\r\noff, and that many were sick, and not in a condition to fight. They\r\nadded, that nobody was privy to the address but the subscribers; and\r\nthey assured him that it was with great concern and reluctance they\r\nfound themselves obliged to declare their sentiments in so dangerous\r\na situation,--a declaration which nothing could have prevailed\r\nupon them to make but the unfortunate diminution of the army by\r\ndesertion.[1128]\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement made by John Hay, who occasionally acted\r\nas secretary to the prince, Charles was so transported with rage,\r\nafter reading this paper, that he struck his head against the\r\nwall of the room till he staggered, and exclaimed most violently\r\nagainst Lord George Murray. To dissuade the subscribers from their\r\nresolution, Charles sent Sir Thomas Sheridan to Falkirk, who, not\r\nsucceeding in his mission, returned to Bannockburn, accompanied\r\nby Keppoch and several other chiefs. These argued the matter with\r\nCharles himself, and ultimately prevailed upon him to consent to a\r\nretreat.[1129] This retreat was condemned by some of the prince’s\r\nflatterers; but the simple fact, stated by Patullo the muster-master\r\nof the prince’s army, that, before the retreat, the army had been\r\ndiminished by desertion to 5,000 men, fully justifies the advice\r\ngiven by Lord George Murray and the chiefs at Falkirk.[1130] Even Sir\r\nThomas Sheridan, the especial favourite of the prince, admitted the\r\nnecessity of the retreat, for reasons apart from the reduction of the\r\narmy.[1131]\r\n\r\nIn order to make the retreat with as little loss as possible, horses\r\nand carriages were ordered in from all quarters, under the pretext\r\nof carrying the field artillery and ammunition towards Edinburgh,\r\nwhither it was given out that the army was to march immediately.\r\nThe army, however, began to suspect the design, and every person,\r\nnot in the secret, looked dejected. During the 30th, a great deal of\r\nbustle took place in the country in collecting horses and carriages,\r\nbut with little effect, as the country people, who also began to\r\nconjecture that a retreat was intended, were not disposed to attend\r\nto the order.[1132] At length the design of these preparations became\r\napparent when, in consequence of a previous arrangement, Lord George\r\nMurray left Falkirk with the clans on the evening of the 31st for\r\nBannockburn, leaving behind him Elcho’s, Pitsligo’s, and Kilmarnock’s\r\nhorse, who were directed to patrol betwixt Falkirk and Linlithgow\r\ntill ten o’clock that night. Lord George continued at the prince’s\r\nquarters till after twelve o’clock at night, when it was agreed\r\nthat the army should rendezvous at nine o’clock next morning near\r\nSt. Ninians; and a message was directed to be sent to the Duke of\r\nPerth and Lord John Drummond, both of whom were at Stirling, to be\r\nready to march between nine and ten o’clock, but not to evacuate the\r\ntown without further orders. However, after Lord George had left\r\nthe prince’s quarters for his own, these orders were countermanded\r\nwithout his knowledge, and orders were sent to Stirling to evacuate\r\nit by break of day.[1133]\r\n\r\nThe appointed rendezvous at St. Ninians never took place, for the\r\nprivate men, imagining when they first heard of the retreat that the\r\ndanger was much greater and nearer than it really was, had begun at\r\nday-break to take the road to the Frews. Before the hour appointed\r\nfor assembling, many of them had arrived at that ford, so that when\r\nCharles left his quarters for St. Ninians, scarcely a vestige of his\r\narmy was to be seen. Officers were sent after some parties, who were\r\nstill visible, for the purpose of stopping them, but without effect.\r\nThe troops in Stirling, in terms of the orders they had received,\r\nafter spiking their cannon, also marched to the Frews, so that the\r\nprince and Lord George Murray found themselves almost deserted.\r\nCharles finding it impossible to recall his troops, marched off with\r\nsome of the chiefs and the few troops that remained with him.[1134]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the retreat the church of St. Ninians, in which\r\nthe insurgents had fifty barrels of gunpowder, blew up with a\r\nterrible explosion, which was heard by the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\narmy at Linlithgow. Whether it happened from accident or design, is\r\na point which cannot be ascertained. If from design, it must have\r\nbeen the act of some unknown individual, as there was no warning\r\ngiven to any person to keep out of the way. That it could not have\r\nbeen perpetrated by any person in the prince’s interest, seems very\r\nevident from the fact, that Charles himself was near enough to have\r\nsuffered injury, and that some of the Highlanders, as well as several\r\nof the inhabitants of the village, were killed.[1135] Yet, such was\r\nthe spirit of misrepresentation which prevailed at the time, that,\r\nwithout the least assignable motive, the odium of the act was thrown\r\nupon Charles.\r\n\r\nWhen this explosion took place, Lord George Murray was still at\r\nhis head quarters. He thought the castle-guns had fired a volley;\r\nand on repairing to the town about an hour after the explosion, he\r\nwas utterly amazed to find that the besiegers had disappeared. He,\r\ntherefore, sent an aide-de-camp to call off some horse he had posted\r\nnear Falkirk, and proceeded immediately, with the few troops that\r\nremained with him, to the Frews.\r\n\r\nThe Highland army was quartered that night at Doune, Dunblane, and\r\nadjacent villages, and continued to retire next day, the 2d of\r\nFebruary, in a very disorderly manner. The prince halted at Crieff,\r\nwhere he reviewed his army, and, according to the statement of one\r\nof his officers,[1136] his army was found not to have lost above\r\n1,000 men by desertion. Charles, who had consented to a retreat on\r\nthe supposition that his army had lost a third of its numbers from\r\nthis cause, is said to have been deeply affected on this occasion.\r\nLord George Murray’s enemies did not let slip the opportunity of\r\nreproaching him, and, indeed, all the chiefs who had signed the\r\nrepresentation, with deception; but the author above referred to\r\nobserves, that their mistake, if there really was a mistake, can be\r\neasily accounted for, if people will divest themselves of prejudice,\r\nand examine the circumstances impartially. He observes, that, from\r\nthe battle of Falkirk up to the time of the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\nmarch from Edinburgh, the country being absolutely secure, the\r\nHighlanders had indulged their restless disposition by roaming about\r\nall the villages in the neighbourhood of their quarters, and that\r\nnumbers of them were absent several days from their colours--that\r\ntheir principal officers knowing for certain that some had gone home,\r\nimagined that such was also the case with all who were not to be\r\nfound in their respective quarters, but that all the stragglers had\r\ngot to Crieff and appeared at the review. Without questioning such a\r\nrespectable authority as Mr. Maxwell, who may be right in the main\r\nfact, as to the number of the army at Crieff, it seems more likely\r\nthat the army had recruited its ranks on the retreat to Crieff, by\r\novertaking the deserters on their homeward route, than that 2,000 or\r\n3,000 men should have been absent on a sojourn in the neighbourhood\r\nof their camp.\r\n\r\nAfter the review, the prince held a council of war, to deliberate\r\nupon the course to be pursued. At no former meeting did heats and\r\nparty animosities break out to such an extent as at this council.\r\nLord George Murray complained greatly of the flight, and requested\r\nto know the names of the persons who had advised it; but the prince\r\ntook the whole blame on himself. After a great deal of wrangling and\r\naltercation, it was determined that the army should march north to\r\nInverness in two divisions,--that the horse and low-country regiments\r\nshould proceed along the coast road, and that the prince, at the\r\nhead of the clans, should take the Highland road.[1137] Lord George,\r\nafter other officers had refused, agreed to take the command of the\r\ncoast division, which arrived at Perth late that night. The prince\r\nremained at Crieff, and passed the night at Fairnton, a seat of Lord\r\nJohn Drummond, in the neighbourhood. Next day, being the 4th, Charles\r\nmarched from Crieff to Dunkeld, and thence to Blair Athole, where\r\nhe remained several days, till he heard of the arrival of the other\r\ndivision at Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nIt would have been quite impossible, under almost any circumstances,\r\nfor the Duke of Cumberland’s army to have overtaken the Highlanders;\r\nbut slow as the movements of such an army necessarily were, it met\r\nwith an obstruction which retarded its progress nearly three days.\r\nThis was the impassable state of Stirling bridge, one arch of which\r\nhad, as formerly mentioned, been broken down by General Blakeney\r\nto embarrass the intercourse between the Highland army when in the\r\nsouth, and its auxiliaries in the north. It was not till the morning\r\nof the 4th of February that the bridge was repaired, on which day\r\nthe English army passed over. The advanced guard, consisting of the\r\nArgyleshire Highlanders and the dragoons, went on to Crieff, and the\r\nfoot were quartered in and about Dunblane, where the duke passed the\r\nnight. Next day he proceeded to Crieff, and on the 6th arrived at\r\nPerth, of which his advanced guard had taken possession the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray marched from Perth for Aberdeen with his division\r\non the 4th. He left behind thirteen pieces of cannon, which were\r\nspiked and thrown into the Tay, a great quantity of cannon balls,\r\nand fourteen swivel guns, that formerly belonged to the Hazard\r\nsloop-of-war, which had been surprised and taken at Montrose by the\r\nHighlanders. These pieces were taken out of the river next day by the\r\nroyal troops.\r\n\r\nHaving learned at Perth the different routes taken by the Highland\r\narmy, and that it had gained two or three days’ march in advance,\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland resolved to halt a few days to refresh his\r\nmen. From Perth parties were sent out to perambulate the neighbouring\r\ncountry, who plundered the lands and carried off the effects of the\r\nprince’s adherents. The Duchess Dowager of Perth and the Viscountess\r\nof Strathallan were apprehended, carried to Edinburgh, and committed\r\nto the castle.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival at Perth, the Duke of Cumberland received\r\nan express announcing the arrival in the Frith of Forth of a force\r\nof about 5,000 Hessians, under the command of the Prince of Hesse,\r\nson-in-law of George II. These auxiliaries had been brought over from\r\nthe continent to supply the place of the Dutch troops, who had been\r\nrecalled by the states-general in consequence of the interference\r\nof the French government, which considered the treaty entered into\r\nbetween the King of Great Britain and Holland, by which the latter\r\nagreed to furnish these troops to suppress the rebellion, as a\r\nviolation of the capitulations of Tournay and Dendermonde.\r\n\r\nThe fleet which conveyed the Hessian troops anchored in Leith roads\r\non the 8th of February, having been only four days from Williamstadt.\r\nThe troops were disembarked at Leith on the 9th and the following\r\nday, and were cantoned in and about Edinburgh. On the 15th of\r\nFebruary the Duke of Cumberland paid a visit to the Prince of Hesse,\r\nhis brother-in-law, at Edinburgh. On that evening they held a council\r\nof war in Milton-house, the residence of the lord-justice-clerk. In\r\nconsequence of the sudden and disorderly retreat of the Highlanders,\r\nan opinion had begun to prevail among the friends of the government\r\nat Edinburgh, that it was the intention of the insurgents to disperse\r\nthemselves, and that Charles would follow the example set by his\r\nfather in 1716, by leaving the kingdom. Impressed with this idea, the\r\ngenerals who attended the council gave it as their unanimous opinion\r\nthat the war was at an end, and that the duke had nothing now to do\r\nbut to give orders to his officers to march into the Highlands, as\r\nsoon as the season would permit, and ferret the insurgents out of\r\ntheir strongholds, as it appeared evident to them that they would\r\nnever risk a battle with an army commanded by the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nAfter the officers had delivered their sentiments, the duke requested\r\nLord Milton to give his opinion, as he knew the Highlands and\r\nHighlanders better than any person present. His lordship at first\r\ndeclined doing so, as he was not a military man, but being pressed\r\nby the duke, he began by expressing a hope that he might be mistaken\r\nin the opinion he was about to give, but he felt himself bound to\r\ndeclare, from all he knew of the Highlands and Highlanders, that the\r\nwar was not at an end, and that as the king’s troops could not follow\r\nthe Highlanders among their fastnesses in the winter season, they\r\nwould, though now divided and scattered, unite again, and venture\r\nanother battle before giving up the war. Acquiescing in the views of\r\nLord Milton, whose opinion turned out correct, the duke returned to\r\nPerth next day to put his army in motion towards the north.[1138]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Highland army was proceeding in its march to\r\nInverness. After remaining a few days at Blair-Athole, Charles\r\nmarched to Ruthven in Badenoch, the barrack of which was taken\r\nand blown up by a party under Gordon of Glenbucket, who made the\r\nsmall garrison prisoners. He reached Moy castle, a seat of the\r\nlaird of Mackintosh, about ten miles from Inverness, on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, with an advanced guard of about 50 men. As Charles’s forces\r\nwere widely scattered, he resolved to halt at Moy till he should\r\nconcentrate a force sufficient to attack the Earl of Loudon, who was\r\nposted at Inverness with 2,000 men.\r\n\r\nHearing of Charles’s arrival at Moy castle, and that he had not\r\nabove 500 or 600 men with him, Lord Loudon formed a design to seize\r\nhim during the night while off his guard. The better to conceal his\r\nproject, his lordship, at three o’clock in the afternoon, completely\r\ninvested Inverness on all sides, posting guards and a chain of\r\nsentinels round the town, with positive orders not to suffer any\r\nperson to leave it on any pretext whatever. He ordered, at the\r\nsame time, 1,500 men to hold themselves in readiness to march at a\r\nmoment’s warning; and, having assembled them without noise, he put\r\nhimself at their head, and instantly set off, planning his march\r\nso as he might arrive at the castle of Moy about eleven o’clock at\r\nnight.[1139]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the secrecy, however, with which Lord Loudon\r\nconcocted his scheme, the plan was divulged by the imprudence or\r\nperfidy of some persons intrusted with the secret. According to one\r\naccount (for there are several), the design was communicated to Lady\r\nMackintosh, a zealous Jacobite, by Fraser of Gorthleck, in a letter\r\nwhich he sent to her, and in another letter which she received at\r\nthe same time from her mother, who, though a whig, felt a repugnance\r\nto allow Charles to be made a prisoner in her daughter’s house, in\r\nwhich he had taken up his residence as a guest.[1140] Another account\r\nis, that while some English officers were drinking in a tavern in\r\nInverness, waiting the hour of their departure, a girl of thirteen\r\nor fourteen years of age, who happened to wait on them, paid great\r\nattention to their conversation, and, from certain expressions\r\ndropped by them, discovered their design,--that she immediately left\r\nthe house, escaped from the town, notwithstanding the vigilance of\r\nthe sentinels, and immediately took the road to Moy, running as fast\r\nas she was able, without shoes or stockings, which, to accelerate\r\nher progress, she had taken off,--and that on arriving she informed\r\nLady Mackintosh of the design against the prince.[1141] The _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_, however, have furnished a third version of this affair,\r\nwhich appears to be more correct in the details. It is there stated\r\nthat Lady Mackintosh’s mother, who lived in Inverness, having\r\nreceived notice of Lord Loudon’s design, despatched a boy, about\r\nfifteen years of age, named Lauchlan Mackintosh, to Moy, to apprise\r\nthe prince thereof,--that the boy, finding he could not pass by Lord\r\nLoudon’s men without running the risk of being discovered, concealed\r\nhimself behind a wall till they had passed, when, taking a different\r\nroad, he reached Moy and gave the alarm. The prince, who was in bed,\r\nwas instantly awakened, and, jumping out, put on his clothes, left\r\nthe house with a guard of about thirty men, and disappeared in a\r\nneighbouring wood.[1142]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady Anne Mackintosh, 1745. From original painting in\r\npossession of The Mackintosh.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lady Mackintosh was informed of Lord Loudon’s design,\r\nshe sent five or six of her people, headed by a country blacksmith,\r\nnamed Fraser, to watch the advance of Loudon’s troops. This man,\r\nwith a boldness almost incredible, formed the extraordinary design\r\nof surprising the advancing party, in the expectation that they\r\nwould fall a prey to a panic. With this view, he posted his men on\r\nboth sides of the road to Inverness, about three miles from Moy,\r\nand enjoined them not to fire till he should give directions, and\r\nthen not to fire together, but one after the other, in the order he\r\npointed out. After waiting for some time, the party was apprised\r\nof the advance of Lord Loudon’s troops by the noise they made in\r\nmarching. When the head of the detachment, which consisted of 70\r\nmen under the laird of Macleod, was within hearing, the blacksmith\r\ncalled out with a loud voice, “Here come the villains who intend to\r\ncarry off our prince; fire, my lads; do not spare them; give them\r\nno quarter.” He thereupon discharged his piece in the direction of\r\nthe detachment, and his party, after following his example, ran\r\nin different directions, calling upon the Macdonalds and Camerons\r\nto advance on the right and left, and repeating aloud the names\r\nof Lochiel and Keppoch. Impressed with the belief that the whole\r\nHighland army was at hand, the advanced guard instantly turned\r\nits back, and communicating its fears to the rear, a scene of\r\nindescribable confusion ensued. The _sauve-qui-peut_ which burst\r\nforth from the discomfited legions of Napoleon on the plains of\r\nWaterloo, was not more appalling to the flying French than were the\r\nnames of the Camerons and Macdonalds to the ears of Lord Loudon’s\r\ntroops on the present occasion. In the hurry of their flight many\r\nwere thrown down and trodden upon, and so great was the panic with\r\nwhich the fugitives were seized, that the flight continued till\r\nthey got near Inverness. The Master of Ross, who accompanied the\r\nparty, and was one of those who were overwhelmed, observed to Mr.\r\nHome, that he had been in many perils, but had never found himself\r\nin such a grievous condition as that in which he was at the rout of\r\nMoy.[1143] In this affair the laird of Macleod’s piper, reputed the\r\nbest in Scotland, was shot dead on the spot. On the dispersion of\r\nLord Loudon’s party, Charles returned to the castle.\r\n\r\nHaving assembled his men next morning, Charles advanced upon\r\nInverness with the intention of attacking Lord Loudon, and taking\r\nrevenge for the attempt of the preceding night; but his lordship, not\r\nfeeling inclined to wait for the prince, retired into Ross-shire,\r\nby crossing the Moray Frith at the ferry of Kessock. Charles took\r\nimmediate possession of Inverness, and laid siege to the castle then\r\nnamed Fort George. This structure, which was situated on a hill to\r\nthe south-west of Cromwell’s fort, had been raised at the Revolution;\r\nand had cost the government, since its erection, above £50,000. The\r\ncastle was fortified in the modern manner, being a regular square\r\nwith four bastions, and it commanded the town and the bridge over the\r\nriver Ness.\r\n\r\nThis fortress had a garrison of eighty regular troops; but, on\r\nhis departure from Inverness, Lord Loudon threw into it two of the\r\nindependent companies, one of Grants, and the other of Macleods. The\r\ncastle on the present occasion mounted sixteen pieces of cannon,\r\nand was well provided with ammunition and provisions. The prince\r\nsummoned the fortress to surrender, but Grant of Rothiemurchus,\r\nthe governor, refused to comply. Though Charles had left his heavy\r\nartillery behind, he found no difficulty in reducing this fort, as\r\nthe little hill on which it was built was so contiguous to the town\r\nthat it could be easily approached on that side, without exposure to\r\nits fire. It was resolved to undermine the castle and blow it up;\r\nbut, after a siege of two days, and when the mine had been completed,\r\nthe garrison surrendered. This event took place on the 20th of\r\nFebruary. The prince, however, did not spare the fortress, which he\r\nblew up immediately after the surrender; a sergeant in the French\r\nartillery, who was charged with the operation, losing his life on the\r\noccasion.[1144]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Charles arrived at Moy, the division under Lord\r\nGeorge Murray had reached Spey side; and the day before Fort George\r\nsurrendered he had arrived with his men in the neighbourhood of\r\nInverness. In consequence of a great fall of snow, which took place\r\non the day Lord George marched from Aberdeen, his march had been most\r\nfatiguing; and the French piquets and Lord John Drummond’s regiment\r\nwere obliged to halt a day at Kintore and Inverury. After giving\r\nthe prince an account of his march, Lord George, contemplating the\r\npossibility of a retreat to the Highlands, mentioned a plan, devised\r\nby him and Lord Pitsligo, to assess the shires of Banff, Moray,\r\nand Nairn in 5,000 bolls of meal, for the use of the army; and he\r\nproposed that the greater part of it should be sent to the Highlands\r\nfor subsistence, in case of retreat thither. The prince approved of\r\nthe plan; but directed that the whole of the meal, when collected,\r\nshould be brought to Inverness.[1145]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two detachments, which took possession of Blair\r\nand Castle Menzies, the army of the Duke of Cumberland lay inactive\r\nat Perth till the 20th of February, on which day he put his army in\r\nmotion for the north, in four divisions. He sent notice to the Prince\r\nof Hesse to march to Perth, and in his way to leave two battalions at\r\nStirling. At the same time he directed the remains of Ligonier’s and\r\nHamilton’s dragoons to be cantoned at Bannockburn, and St. George’s\r\ndragoons to be posted at Bridge of Earn. With the assistance of these\r\ncavalry regiments, which were placed under the command of the Earl of\r\nCrawford, it was thought that the Prince of Hesse would be able to\r\ncheck the insurgents, and prevent their progress south, should they\r\ngive the duke the slip. In marching north, the duke’s army took the\r\nroad along the coast, as Lord George Murray had done. On the 27th of\r\nFebruary the army arrived at Aberdeen, where the duke took up his\r\nquarters, till the advance of spring should enable him to take the\r\nfield. A few days before his arrival, a vessel from France had landed\r\nat Aberdeen three troops of Fitz-James’s horse, with five officers,\r\nand a piquet of Berwick’s regiment. These troops, with a party of men\r\nunder Moir of Stonywood, left Aberdeen on the duke’s approach.\r\n\r\nCompelled by circumstances to abandon, within the short space of\r\nthree weeks, the whole tract of low country from the Avon to the Don,\r\non which he chiefly relied for the subsistence of his army, followed\r\nby a large army with powerful resources in its rear, which it could\r\nrender speedily available, and narrowly watched by the forces under\r\nLord Loudon, the situation of Charles now became very critical. The\r\nfertile province of Moray and part of the adjacent territory had, by\r\nthe expulsion of Lord Loudon from Inverness, no doubt come into his\r\npossession; but he could not expect to maintain his ground in this\r\ndistrict for any length of time without a precarious struggle. He had\r\nit in his power, whenever he pleased, to retire into the neighbouring\r\nHighlands, where his pursuers would scarcely venture to follow him;\r\nbut, without previously securing a supply of provisions from the Low\r\ncountry, he could not keep his army together in a district where the\r\nmeans of subsistence were extremely scanty. The possibility of such\r\na retreat was contemplated by Lord George Murray; but, from aversion\r\nto such a design, or from want of foresight, Charles, as just stated,\r\nover-ruled his lordship’s proposal to send a supply of provisions to\r\nthe Highlands.\r\n\r\nJudging from the slowness of the Duke of Cumberland’s motions,\r\nthat a considerable time would elapse before he would venture to\r\ncross the Spey, Charles resolved to employ the interval in carrying\r\nthrough a series of operations which he and his friends projected.\r\nThe principal of these were the reduction of Fort Augustus and\r\nFort William, and the dispersion of Lord Loudon’s army. To secure\r\nsubsistence for his army, he cantoned the greater part of the\r\ndivision which had marched by Aberdeen between that town and\r\nInverness; and, as after the retreat from Stirling he had directed\r\nany supplies that might be sent him from France to be landed to the\r\nnorth of Aberdeen, he occupied all the little towns along that coast.\r\nAs this district was generally disaffected to the government, it was\r\nan easy matter to guard it with the few troops that were dispersed\r\nover it; and no danger was to be apprehended till the English army\r\ncame up, when the various parties were directed to fall back from\r\npost to post as the duke advanced.[1146]\r\n\r\nThe first enterprise that Charles undertook, after capturing Fort\r\nGeorge, was the siege of Fort Augustus. To reduce this fortress, and\r\nwith the ulterior view of laying siege to Fort William, Brigadier\r\nStapleton was sent into Stratherrick with the French piquets and a\r\ndetachment of Lord John Drummond’s regiment, and appeared before\r\nFort Augustus about the end of February. Without waiting for his\r\nartillery, which consisted of a few pieces found at Fort George, he\r\nattacked the old barrack and carried it immediately, the garrison\r\nretiring to the fort. Mr. Grant, who had succeeded M. Mirabelle as\r\nchief engineer, since the siege of Stirling, opened a trench upon the\r\n3d of March. The garrison held out two days, when, in consequence\r\nof the explosion of the powder magazine by the falling of a shell,\r\nthe fortress surrendered, and the garrison, which consisted of three\r\ncompanies of Guise’s regiment, were made prisoners of war. Leaving\r\nLord Lewis Gordon with a few troops in command of the place, the\r\nbrigadier marched to Fort William, which he invested on the land\r\nside.[1147]\r\n\r\nPursuant to his plan of operations, the prince, in the beginning\r\nof March, sent Lord Cromarty with a detachment, consisting of his\r\nown regiment, the Mackintoshes, Macgregors, and Barrisdale’s men,\r\nto drive the forces under Lord Loudon out of Ross-shire. Finding\r\nthat his lordship was unable to accomplish the task which had been\r\nassigned him, Charles despatched Lord George Murray to his assistance\r\nwith the Macdonalds of Clanranald and a battalion of Lochiel’s\r\nregiment. He reached Dingwall the first night, where he found Lord\r\nCromarty’s detachment; but his lordship had been absent two days at\r\nhis own house with a strong guard of Mackenzies. Lord George marched\r\nnext day for Tain, where he understood Lord Loudon was posted; but on\r\nthe road he learned that his lordship had crossed the Dornoch Frith\r\nto Sutherland, and had quartered his troops in the town of Dornoch\r\nand the neighbourhood. Not having any boats to carry his men across\r\nthe frith, his lordship, after consulting his officers, returned\r\nto Dingwall, where he quartered his men. The reason of retiring a\r\nday’s march farther back was to throw Lord Loudon off his guard, as\r\nit was contemplated to bring boats along the coast and attempt the\r\npassage. There was nothing to prevent the detachment marching round\r\nthe head of the frith; but Lord Loudon having a sufficiency of boats,\r\nmight have eluded his pursuers by recrossing to Tain; and, as Lord\r\nGeorge would, by such a course, have been several days’ march from\r\nInverness, the main body of the Highland army would have been in a\r\ncritical situation, if the Duke of Cumberland’s army had reached the\r\nneighbourhood of Inverness, while the corps under Lord George Murray\r\nwas on the north side of the Frith of Dornoch.[1148] After sending\r\nnotice to Lord Cromarty of the disposition of his forces, and that\r\nthe Duke of Perth would take the command, Lord George returned to\r\nInverness the following day, to execute a design he and Macpherson\r\nof Cluny had concerted, to surprise the castle of Blair, and to\r\nbeat up the quarters of the government troops in Athole, who, from\r\ninformation he had received, had committed great excesses in that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nTo carry the enterprise against Lord Loudon into execution, all\r\nthe fishing boats that could be collected on the coast of Moray\r\nwere brought to Findhorn. A few gentlemen, to whom the charge of\r\ncollecting this small flotilla had been intrusted, had conducted\r\nthe matter with such secrecy and expedition, that no person in the\r\ngovernment interest was aware of it; but after the boats were all\r\nin readiness, a difficulty presented itself in getting them across\r\nthe Moray frith without being perceived by the English cruisers that\r\nwere continually passing along the coast. Moir of Stonywood, however,\r\nundertook to convey the boats to Tain, and he accordingly set out one\r\nnight with this little fleet, and arrived at his destination next\r\nmorning without being observed by the enemy.[1149] On the flotilla\r\nreaching Tain, the Duke of Perth divided his force into two parts;\r\nand while, with one of them, he marched about by the head of the\r\nfrith, he directed the other to cross in the boats. Under cover\r\nof a thick fog this division landed without being discovered, and\r\nthe duke, having united his forces on the north side of the frith,\r\nadvanced upon Dornoch. When near that town, he came up with a party\r\nof 200 men, who were on their march to join Lord Loudon. This party\r\ninstantly fled; but Major Mackenzie, who commanded it, with four\r\nor five officers, and sixty privates, were made prisoners. Among\r\nthe officers was a son of Mr. Macdonald of Scothouse, who was taken\r\nprisoner by his own father.[1150] The main body, under Lord Loudon,\r\nabandoned Dornoch in great consternation, and fled north towards\r\nGlenmore, pursued by the Jacobite forces. Both parties marched all\r\nnight; but the fugitives kept ahead of their pursuers. After a chase\r\nof about thirty miles, the Duke of Perth discontinued the pursuit,\r\nand halted at the head of Loch Shin. While following the enemy during\r\nthe night, great anxiety prevailed among the Macdonalds in the\r\nDuke of Perth’s detachment, lest, in the event of an engagement,\r\nthey might not be able, notwithstanding their white cockades, to\r\ndistinguish themselves from the Macdonalds of Skye, who, like\r\nthe other Macdonalds, wore heather in their bonnets.[1151] Upon\r\nreaching the head of Sutherland-shire, Lord Loudon separated his\r\narmy. Accompanied by the lord-president and the laird of Macleod, he\r\nmarched to the sea-coast with 800 of the Macdonalds and Macleods,\r\nand embarked for the Isle of Skye. Part of his own regiment, with\r\nseveral officers, took refuge in Lord Reay’s country. Finding that\r\nLord Loudon’s troops had dispersed, the Duke of Perth returned to\r\nInverness, leaving Lord Cromarty in Sutherland with a sufficient\r\nforce to keep Lord Sutherland and Lord Reay’s people in check. The\r\ndispersion of Lord Loudon’s army was considered of such importance\r\nby Charles, that he immediately despatched an officer to France with\r\nthe intelligence.[1152] In this expedition, several vessels in the\r\nFrith of Dornoch, having some valuable effects on board, fell into\r\nthe hands of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nBefore Lord George Murray set out on his expedition into Athole,\r\nMacpherson of Cluny had secured the passes between that country and\r\nBadenoch, to prevent all communication between these districts. About\r\nthe middle of March Lord George left Inverness with 400 men of the\r\nAthole brigade; and, on entering Badenoch, he was joined by Cluny\r\nwith 300 Macphersons. On the 16th of March the whole detachment set\r\nout from Dalwhinnie in the dusk of the evening, and did not halt till\r\nthey reached Dalnaspidal, about the middle of Drummochter, where the\r\nbody was divided into a number of small parties, in each of which the\r\nAthole men and the Macphersons were proportionally mixed.\r\n\r\nHitherto, with the exception of Macpherson of Cluny and Lord George,\r\nno person in the expedition knew either its destination or object.\r\nThe time was now come for Lord George to explain his design, which\r\nhe said was to surprise and attack before day-light, and as nearly\r\nas possible at the same time, all the posts in Athole occupied by\r\nthe royal forces. As an encouragement, he offered a reward of a\r\nguinea to every man who should surprise a sentinel at his post.\r\nThere were about thirty posts in all, including the different houses\r\nat which the royal troops were quartered; but the principal posts,\r\nmore especially selected for attack, were Bun-Rannoch, the house of\r\nKeynnachin, the house of Blairfettie, the house of Lude, the house\r\nof Faskally, and the inn at Blair, where, as Lord George Murray\r\nwas informed, several officers of the twenty-first regiment were\r\nquartered. After the different parties had discharged their duty by\r\nattacking the posts assigned them, they were ordered to meet at the\r\nbridge of Bruar, about two miles north from Blair, as the general\r\nrendezvous for the detachment.\r\n\r\nHaving received their instructions, the different parties set out\r\nimmediately: and so well was the scheme of attack laid, that betwixt\r\nthree and five o’clock in the morning, the whole posts, though many\r\nmiles distant from one another, were carried. At Bun-Rannoch, where\r\nthere was a late-wake held that night, the sentinel was surprised,\r\nand the whole of the party, (Argyleshire men,) while engaged in\r\nthat festivity, were taken prisoners, without a shot being fired on\r\neither side. The sentinel at Keynnachin being more upon his guard,\r\ndischarged his piece and alarmed his friends, who defended themselves\r\nfor a short time by firing from the windows, till the party broke\r\ninto the house, and killing one man, made prisoners of the rest. At\r\nBlairfettie, where there were fifty Argyleshire men stationed, the\r\nsentinel was surprised, and the party, with the proprietor of the\r\nmansion at their head, entered the house before the soldiers within\r\nknew that they were attacked. They endeavoured to defend themselves,\r\nbut were obliged to surrender. Lady Blairfettie was in bed at the\r\ntime, and knew nothing of the affair, till informed by a servant that\r\nher husband was below, and wished to see her immediately. On coming\r\ndown stairs she found the garrison disarmed, the prisoners in the\r\ndining-room, and about a dozen of her husband’s tenants and servants\r\nstanding over them with drawn swords. Blairfettie, thinking that his\r\nwife had been harshly treated, desired her to point out any of the\r\nprisoners who had used her ill; but she answered that she had no\r\nother complaint to make than this, that the prisoners had eaten all\r\nher provisions, and that she and her children were starving.[1153]\r\nThe parties at Faskally, at Lude, and the bridge of Tilt, were also\r\ntaken; but that in the inn of Blair, after some resistance, escaped\r\nto the castle. Three hundred prisoners were taken by Lord George’s\r\nparties, without the loss of a single man. While beating up the\r\ndifferent posts, a party, by order of Lord George, secured the pass\r\nof Killiecrankie.[1154]\r\n\r\nHaving been apprised, by the arrival of the party from the inn of\r\nBlair, of the presence of the enemy, Sir Andrew Agnew, who held\r\nthe castle of Blair, instantly got his men under arms, and left\r\nthe castle to ascertain who they were that had attacked his posts.\r\nInformation of this circumstance was brought about daybreak by an\r\ninhabitant of the village to Lord George Murray, who was then at\r\nthe bridge of Bruar with a party of twenty-five men only and a\r\nfew elderly gentlemen, waiting for the different parties he had\r\ndespatched the previous night. This intelligence was of the utmost\r\nimportance to Lord George and his party, all of whom would otherwise\r\nhave probably fallen into the hands of the garrison. Lord George\r\nimmediately consulted the gentlemen around him as to the course they\r\nshould pursue. Some advised an immediate retreat in the direction\r\nof Dalwhinnie, but others were for crossing the nearest hills, and\r\nretiring by roads along which it would be difficult for the garrison\r\nto follow them. His lordship, however, was opposed to both opinions,\r\nas by quitting his post he was afraid that his different parties, as\r\nthey came to the appointed place of rendezvous, would be surprised,\r\nand made prisoners. While pondering how to extricate himself from\r\nthe dilemma in which he was placed, he espied a long unfinished\r\nturf-wall which ran across a field near the bridge. An idea at once\r\noccurred to him, that by disposing the few men that were with him\r\nbehind this wall at a considerable distance from one another, and by\r\ndisplaying the colours of both regiments in front, he might deceive\r\nSir Andrew Agnew’s detachment, by inducing them to believe that they\r\nwere to be opposed by a large body of men. Having disposed his small\r\nparty in the way described, Lord George directed the pipers, (for\r\nluckily he had with him the whole pipers of his detachment,) to keep\r\ntheir eyes fixed upon the road to Blair, and the moment they saw any\r\nmilitary appear in that direction, to strike up at once with all\r\ntheir bagpipes. Just as the sun was rising above the horizon, Sir\r\nAndrew Agnew’s men appeared, and their ears were instantly saluted by\r\nthe noise of the bagpipes, when the pipers commenced playing one of\r\ntheir most noisy pibrochs. The party behind the wall then drew their\r\nswords, and, as they had been previously ordered by Lord George, kept\r\nbrandishing them above their heads. This _ruse_ succeeded completely,\r\nand Sir Andrew, alarmed by the noise and the spectacle before him,\r\nat which he took only a short glance, ordered his men to the right\r\nabout, and retired into the castle.[1155]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blair Castle as it stood in 1745-6 before being\r\ndismantled. Copied by permission from an old drawing in possession of\r\nHis Grace the Duke of Athole.]\r\n\r\nBeing now relieved from all apprehension of attack, Lord George\r\nremained at his post till joined by about 300 of his men,\r\nwhen he marched to Blair, and invested the castle. Having no\r\nbattering-cannon, and only two small field-pieces, which could make\r\nno impression on walls that were seven feet thick, he resolved to\r\nblockade the castle, which he expected would be forced to surrender\r\nin two or three weeks for want of provisions. To cut off the\r\ncommunication between the castle and the neighbouring country, Lord\r\nGeorge placed a guard of 300 men at the village of Blair, where he\r\nwas himself stationed, and another near the Mains, at some stables\r\nwhich had been recently erected. Being joined by 400 or 500 men\r\nbelonging to the district, who had been formerly in the Highland\r\narmy, Lord George detached a party to Dunkeld, where they remained\r\ntill the approach of the Hessians from Perth. This party then\r\nretreated to Pitlochrie, two miles below the pass of Killiecrankie,\r\nwhere they remained several days, during which time repeated\r\nskirmishes took place between them and the hussars, and some of St.\r\nGeorge’s dragoons. During the time the Athole men kept possession of\r\nPitlochrie, Lord George Murray went there generally twice every day\r\nto ascertain the state of matters. The Hessians showed no disposition\r\nto leave Dunkeld, where they had taken up their quarters, till the\r\n13th of March, on which day a large body of them came up as far as\r\nthe Haugh of Dalskean, about two miles from Pitlochrie. The dragoons\r\nand hussars continuing to advance, the Athole men retired to the\r\nfoot of the pass of Killiecrankie, where they halted to dispute the\r\npassage; but after remaining six hours waiting for the Hessians, they\r\nwere informed that a great part of them had returned to Dunkeld.[1156]\r\n\r\nAt this time the garrison of Blair castle was reduced to great\r\ndistress from the want of provisions, and if the blockade had\r\nbeen continued a few days longer they must have surrendered; but,\r\nfortunately for the besieged, Lord George Murray was ordered to\r\nreturn immediately to Inverness, in consequence of the expected\r\nadvance of the Duke of Cumberland. Accordingly, on the 31st of March,\r\nLord George sent off his two pieces of cannon, that he might not be\r\nimpeded in his march, and about ten o’clock at night he drew off the\r\nparty from the pass to Blair, taking his departure for Inverness,\r\nat two o’clock next morning. Finding the pass clear, Lord Crawford\r\nwent through it the same morning, but the Hessians, alarmed at the\r\ndreadful aspect which it presented, positively refused to enter the\r\npass. As, from the expresses which Lord George Murray received, he\r\nwas led to infer that the Duke of Cumberland was about to leave\r\nAberdeen, his lordship made a most rapid march, having performed\r\nthe journey in seventy hours, four only of which he devoted to\r\nsleep. Cluny’s men were left at Ruthven, to guard Badenoch from the\r\nincursions of the royal troops in Athole.[1157]\r\n\r\nTo facilitate his march to the north, and to clear as much of the low\r\ncountry as possible from the presence of the insurgents, the Duke\r\nof Cumberland sent several detachments from Aberdeen, to scour the\r\ncountry, and possess themselves of certain posts between the Don and\r\nthe Spey. One of these detachments, consisting of four battalions of\r\ninfantry, the Duke of Kingston’s horse, and Cobham’s dragoons, under\r\nthe command of General Bland, left Aberdeen on the 12th of March, and\r\ntook possession of Old Meldrum, Inverury, and Old Rayne. Bland was\r\npreceded on his march by the Argyleshire men, and 100 of the laird of\r\nGrant’s followers under the eldest son of that chief. At this time\r\nthe insurgent forces on the east of the river Spey, which had been\r\nplaced under the command of Lord John Drummond, were stationed as\r\nfollows. Lord Strathallan’s horse, which had been lately separated\r\nfrom Lord Kilmarnock’s, and the hussars, occupied Cullen; part of\r\nthe battalions of Roy Stewart and Gordon of Avochy, consisting of\r\nabout 400 men, with 50 horse, were quartered at Strathbogie, and\r\nthe remainder were cantoned in Fochabers, and the villages along the\r\nSpey.[1158]\r\n\r\nHaving received intelligence of the occupation of Strathbogie by\r\nthe Highlanders, the Duke of Cumberland sent orders on the 16th, to\r\nGeneral Bland to march thither with all the troops under his command,\r\nand endeavour to surprise the forces there assembled, and failing\r\nin that design, to attack them and drive them across the river. To\r\nsustain General Bland, should occasion require, Brigadier Mordaunt\r\nmarched by break of day next morning to Old Meldrum, with four\r\nbattalions and four pieces of cannon. About the same time General\r\nBland left Old Meldrum for Strathbogie, and almost succeeded in\r\nsurprising the insurgents, who were ignorant of his approach till he\r\ncame near the place. At the time the news of General Bland’s march\r\nreached Strathbogie some of the Highlanders were absent, having\r\nbeen sent the preceding night for the purpose of intercepting the\r\nyoung laird of Grant, who was returning to his own country with\r\na commission to raise a regiment out of his clan, and who was to\r\npass within a few miles of Strathbogie. The party, however, did not\r\nsucceed, as Mr. Grant got the start of them, and took up his quarters\r\nfor the night in a strong castle belonging to Lord Forbes, which they\r\nfound it impossible to force without artillery. This party returned\r\nto Strathbogie about one o’clock in the afternoon, greatly fatigued\r\nfrom want of rest, and found that intelligence had been received of\r\nBland’s advance. This news was fully confirmed by the arrival of some\r\nscouts, who came back at full speed with information that a large\r\nbody of horse and foot was at hand.[1159]\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the unexpected approach of the enemy, the officers at\r\nStrathbogie were at first at a loss how to act. There was danger in\r\nretreat as well as in attempting to remain. It was impossible that\r\nthe men, who were in want of sleep and refreshment, could march far\r\nwithout halting; and as they had left several stragglers behind,\r\nit appeared certain that, in the event of a retreat, these would\r\nbe picked up by Bland’s cavalry. On the other hand, from the vast\r\nnumerical superiority of the English forces, it was dreaded that the\r\nsmall party would not be able to make an effectual resistance, and\r\nthat in the event of a defeat the whole would easily fall into the\r\nenemy’s hands. In this dilemma it was resolved to remain an hour at\r\nStrathbogie, to give time to the stragglers to come up, and then\r\nto retreat. At this time the van of Bland’s detachment had begun\r\nto appear, and before the hour had elapsed the whole was in sight,\r\nand the van within a quarter of a mile of the village. The small\r\nparty of guards then marched out towards the enemy, and while they\r\nformed between the village and the bridge of Bogie, as if intending\r\nto dispute the passage of the bridge, the foot left the village.\r\nAfter they had cleared the village, and the enemy’s cavalry had\r\nbegun to file along the bridge, the small body of horse retired\r\nafter the foot, towards the river Deveron, which they crossed. They\r\nthereupon formed again on the other side of the river to stop the\r\nenemy’s horse, who had pursued them at full speed from Strathbogie\r\nto the river side, but they did not at first attempt the passage,\r\na circumstance which enabled the foot to gain the adjoining hill\r\nwithout molestation, where, from the narrowness of the road and the\r\nrockiness of the ground on each side of it, they were perfectly\r\nsafe from the attacks of cavalry. With the exception of some\r\nvolunteers among the cavalry, who followed half-way up the hill, and\r\nskirmished with a few of the guards who were left behind to observe\r\ntheir motions, the rest of the cavalry gave over the pursuit. The\r\nHighlanders, however, did not halt till they reached Fochabers. Next\r\nday they crossed the Spey, along with the other troops which had been\r\ncantoned on the east side, and took up their quarters in the villages\r\non the opposite side.[1160]\r\n\r\nFrom Strathbogie, General Bland sent forward a detachment of 70\r\nCampbells, and 30 of Kingston’s horse, to occupy Keith, but they\r\nwere not allowed to hold this post long. Major Glasgow, an Irish\r\nofficer in the service of France, having offered to the prince to\r\ncarry it with a detachment of 200 men, he was allowed to attempt the\r\nenterprise, and succeeded, the village having been invested on all\r\nsides before the enemy was aware of the attempt. On this occasion\r\nthey became the victims of a little stratagem. After recrossing the\r\nSpey, Lord John Drummond sent a body of horse and foot across every\r\nmorning. The foot remained generally all day at Fochabers, and the\r\nhorse patrolled on the road between that village and Keith. On the\r\n20th of March, a small party of Bland’s light horse having appeared\r\non the top of the hill that overlooks Fochabers, the party occupying\r\nthe village, apparently alarmed, left it in a hurry, much earlier\r\nthan usual, and repassed the river. The design in thus repairing\r\nacross the river before the usual time, was to throw the party at\r\nKeith off their guard, who, fancying themselves secure, took no\r\nprecautions against surprise. After it had grown quite dark, Glasgow\r\ncrossed the Spey with his detachment, consisting of 200 foot and 40\r\nhorse, and marching direct to Keith, arrived there unperceived about\r\none o’clock in the morning. The Campbells, who were quartered in the\r\nchurch, formed in the church-yard, and a smart fire was kept up for\r\nsome time between them and their assailants; but upon being promised\r\nquarter, if they submitted, they laid down their arms. Of the whole\r\nparty, including the horse, not above five or six escaped. Captain\r\nCampbell who commanded the detachment, a non-commissioned officer,\r\nand five privates were killed. Glasgow had twelve of his men killed\r\nor wounded.\r\n\r\nThe advantages obtained by the insurgents in their expeditions into\r\nAthole and Sutherland, and by the reduction of Fort Augustus, were\r\nin some degree balanced by the loss of the Prince Charles, formerly\r\nthe Hazard sloop of war, and the capture of some treasure and warlike\r\nstores which she had brought from France for the use of Charles’s\r\narmy; and by the abandonment of the siege of Fort William.\r\n\r\nEarly in November the Hazard, a vessel mounting sixteen guns and some\r\nswivels, with a crew of 80 men, had anchored at Ferriden, opposite\r\nMontrose. The object of her commander, in taking this station, was\r\nto prevent the insurgents from taking possession of the town. At\r\nthis time a party of Lord Ogilvy’s men, under the command of Captain\r\nDavid Ferrier, held Brechin, of which Ferrier had been appointed\r\ndeputy-governor by the prince before his march into England; and\r\nto hinder the approach of this party towards Montrose, a fire was\r\nkept up at intervals for three days and nights from the Hazard, the\r\nonly effect of which was to annoy the inhabitants exceedingly. To\r\nput an end to such a state of matters, Ferrier formed the design of\r\ncapturing the vessel by raising a battery at the entrance of the\r\nriver, and thereby to prevent her getting out to sea. In pursuance\r\nof this plan he entered Montrose one night, and possessed himself\r\nof the island on the south side of the town, opposite to where the\r\nHazard lay. Next day the Hazard attempted to dislodge the party from\r\nthe isle by her fire, but without success. In the afternoon of the\r\nfollowing day a vessel carrying French colours was observed at sea,\r\nstanding in towards the river; this turned out to be a transport from\r\nFrance, with a party of Lord John Drummond’s regiment, some Irish\r\npiquets, and six pieces of artillery. On observing this vessel, the\r\nHazard fired a gun to leeward as a decoy; but, upon a signal from the\r\nparty on the island, the commander of the French vessel ran her on\r\nshore out of reach of the Hazard’s guns. The crew then landed the six\r\nguns, and a fire was opened from them upon the Hazard next morning\r\nfrom both sides of the river, on each of which three of the pieces\r\nhad been planted. With the exception, however, of having some of her\r\nrigging cut, she sustained no damage. Before the arrival of Ferrier’s\r\nparty, Captain Hill, the commander of the Hazard, had taken four\r\nsix-pounders, and two four-pounders, belonging to the town, which\r\nhe had put on board a vessel in the harbour; but, by oversight, he\r\nleft this vessel at the quay, and the consequence was, that she fell\r\ninto the hands of the insurgents. This circumstance was fatal to the\r\nHazard; for, finding that the guns lately landed were not sufficient\r\nto force the Hazard to surrender, Captain Ferrier carried the four\r\nsix-pounders to the Dial hill, from which he fired upon her; and her\r\ncommander, seeing escape hopeless, after hoisting a flag of truce,\r\nand making an ineffectual attempt for permission to leave the river,\r\nsurrendered.[1161]\r\n\r\nThis vessel, being a first-rate sailer, was a great acquisition\r\nto the insurgents, and had made several trips to France. On the\r\npresent occasion the Prince Charles, as the Hazard was now named by\r\nthe Highlanders, was returning from France, having on board several\r\nofficers and some privates, a supply of arms and ammunition, and\r\na quantity of gold coin, amounting to between £12,000 and £13,000\r\nsterling. She was observed, on the 24th of March, off the Banffshire\r\ncoast, by the Sheerness man-of-war, which immediately gave chase.\r\nThe Prince Charles taking a north-west course, endeavoured to escape\r\nby entering the Pentland frith; but the Sheerness followed her into\r\nthat dangerous gulf; and after a running fight, in which the Prince\r\nCharles is said to have lost 36 men, the latter ran ashore on the\r\nsands of Melness, on the west side of Tongue bay, near the house of\r\nLord Reay, on the 25th of March. The officers, soldiers, and crew,\r\nimmediately landed with the treasure, which was contained in small\r\nboxes, and carried it to the house of William Mackay of Melness,\r\nwhere it remained during the night. The dispersion of Lord Loudon’s\r\nforces, an event which was considered at the time highly favourable\r\nto the interests of Charles in the north, turned out, in the present\r\ninstance, to be very prejudicial. Part of them, as has been stated,\r\nhad, upon their dispersion, retired into that wild and barren region\r\ncalled Lord Reay’s country; and when the Prince Charles arrived\r\nin Tongue bay, there was a party of these troops quartered in the\r\nneighbourhood. On receiving notice of the landing, Lord Reay sent\r\nsome persons in a boat across the bay, to ascertain the strength\r\nof the party that had disembarked; and, on being informed that it\r\nwas not numerous, it was concerted between him and some of Lord\r\nLoudon’s officers, to attack the party next morning with such forces\r\nas they could collect. Early next morning the French, conducted by\r\nGeorge Mackay, younger of Melness, who had undertaken to lead them\r\nto Inverness, left Melness; but they had not proceeded far, when\r\nthey were attacked, two hours after day-break, by a body of men,\r\nconsisting of fifty of Lord Reay’s people headed by his lordship’s\r\nsteward and a similar number of Lord Loudon’s troops. After a short\r\nresistance, during which four or six of their men were killed and\r\nas many wounded, the whole party, consisting of 20 officers and 120\r\nsoldiers and sailors, surrendered.\r\n\r\nAs Charles’s coffers were almost exhausted at this time, the loss\r\nof such a large sum of money pressed with peculiar severity upon\r\nthe army, which he had, in consequence, great difficulty in keeping\r\ntogether. Though sparing in his troops, the King of France had\r\nnot been remiss in sending Charles pecuniary supplies, nor had\r\nthe King of Spain been unmindful of him; but the remittances sent\r\nby these sovereigns did not all reach their destination, some of\r\nthem having been intercepted by British cruisers on their way.\r\nReckoning, however, the sums drawn and received from various sources,\r\nCharles must have got no inconsiderable sum; but he appears to have\r\npaid little attention to his pecuniary concerns, and a system of\r\npeculation is said to have been practised by the persons intrusted\r\nwith the management, which told heavily upon his means. His principal\r\nsteward in particular, to whom the administration of the finances was\r\ncommitted, is alleged not to have been scrupulously honest, and he\r\nis said to have contrived matters so as to prevent open detection.\r\nHis underlings did not omit the opportunity which occasion offered,\r\nof filling their pockets: a system of imposition was also practised\r\nby means of false musters.[1162] Under such circumstances the early\r\nexhaustion of Charles’s military chest is not to be wondered at. In\r\nthis situation, seeing the impossibility of recruiting his finances\r\nat Inverness, he had resolved to return to the south country; but\r\nother circumstances induced him to forego his intention.\r\n\r\nJudging from the unfortunate result of the siege of Stirling castle,\r\nneither Lord George Murray nor Brigadier Stapleton had any hopes\r\nof reducing Fort William, which, besides being a strong place, was\r\nregularly fortified; but, as Lochiel, Keppoch, and other chiefs,\r\nwhose properties lay in its neighbourhood, were very desirous to\r\nobtain possession of a fortress which perpetually annoyed them,\r\nand the garrison of which had, during the prince’s expedition into\r\nEngland, made frequent sallies, and burnt the houses of the country\r\npeople, and carried off their cattle, they did not object to the\r\nsiege.[1163]\r\n\r\nTo assist the troops under Stapleton, the Camerons and the Macdonalds\r\nof Keppoch were ordered to Fort William. Mr. Grant the engineer\r\nproposed to begin the siege by erecting a battery on a small hill,\r\ncalled the Sugar-loaf, which overlooked the fortress about 800 yards\r\noff; and as he observed that one of the bastions projected so far\r\nthat it could not be defended by the fire of the first, he proposed\r\nto arrive at it by a trench and blow it up; but, while in the act of\r\nreconnoitring, he received a violent contusion from a cannon-ball,\r\nwhich completely disabled him. Brigadier Stapleton, having no other\r\nengineer, was obliged to send to Inverness for M. Mirabelle, the\r\nsingular personage formerly alluded to. Meanwhile, the besieged\r\nheightened the parapets of the walls on the side where they dreaded\r\nan attack, and raised the two faces of the bastions seven feet\r\nhigh.[1164]\r\n\r\nFor several days a skirmishing was kept up between the garrison and\r\ntwo sloops of war stationed in the river, on the one side, and the\r\nbesiegers on the other, with varied success; but the insurgents\r\nhaving completed a battery on the Sugar-loaf on March 20th, opened\r\nthe siege that evening. On account of its distance from the\r\nfortress, and the smallness of the cannon, which consisted of six\r\nand four-pounders only, little execution was done. Next day the\r\nbesiegers erected a new battery at the foot of the Cowhill, within\r\nhalf the distance of the other, which was also opened, but with\r\nlittle better effect. On the 22d, Brigadier Stapleton sent a drummer\r\nto Captain Scott, the commanding officer, with a letter, requiring\r\nhim to surrender, but his answer was, that he would defend the place\r\nto the last extremity. The bombardment was thereupon renewed on\r\nboth sides for some hours, but at last the garrison silenced the\r\nbesiegers by beating down their principal battery. The besiegers then\r\nerected a third battery, and the bombardment continued, with little\r\nintermission, till the 31st, when the garrison made a sally, forced\r\none of the batteries erected upon a place called the Craigs, about a\r\nhundred yards from the walls, and captured several pieces of cannon\r\nand two mortars. Notwithstanding this disaster, they continued to\r\nannoy the besieged from five cannon which they had still mounted,\r\nbut with no other damage to the garrison than the destruction of the\r\nroofs of most of the houses. At length, on the 3d of April, Brigadier\r\nStapleton, in consequence of instructions he had received from the\r\nprince to join him immediately, raised the siege, and, after spiking\r\nhis heavy cannon, marched for Inverness with the piquets, taking his\r\nfield pieces along with him. He left the Highlanders behind, on the\r\nunderstanding that they were to follow him with as little delay as\r\npossible. The loss sustained on either side was trifling.[1165]\r\n\r\nAbounding as the prince’s enterprise did, in many brilliant points,\r\nthere is, unquestionably, no part of it more deserving of admiration\r\nthan that which now presents itself, near the end of his short,\r\nbut very eventful career. At Gladsmuir and at Falkirk, almost the\r\nwhole of the prince’s energies were directed to a single point, but\r\nat Inverness he projected a number of expeditions, attacks, and\r\nsieges, and conducted them with an energy and promptitude which\r\nastonished the government. The whole force he was able to collect,\r\nafter his retreat to the north, did not exceed 8,000 men; and,\r\nalthough there was no certainty that the Duke of Cumberland might\r\nnot advance immediately from Aberdeen, which is only a hundred miles\r\nfrom Inverness, yet he separated his forces, and, while with one\r\ndetachment he kept General Bland in check, he, almost at the same\r\ntime, carried on a series of operations with the isolated parts\r\nof his army in the distant territories of Athole, Lochaber, and\r\nSutherland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1122] “But the Duke was no common man. He belonged to an age when\r\nhigh command was in a great measure a royal science, which men of\r\ninferior rank had scanty opportunities of studying. He was connected\r\nwith the cluster of German princes, among whom, after the enticing\r\nexample of the house of Brandenburg, a knowledge of the art of war\r\nwas deemed a good speculation as a means of enlarging their dominions\r\nin the tangled contests created among the German states by every\r\nEuropean war. After Frederick himself, perhaps none of these princes\r\nwould have been so capable of successful appropriations of territory\r\nas the young man whose warlike pursuits were thrown into a different\r\nchannel by his connection with the British throne. Though the subject\r\nof a constitutional government, however, he retained the spirit of\r\nthe German soldier-prince. Military law was the first of all laws;\r\nand to military necessity everything must yield. He followed the\r\ncourse which, perhaps, most men brought up in his school would have\r\nfollowed, if in possession of the same power; but in a constitutional\r\ncountry it had the character of brutal severity, and after having, as\r\nhe deemed it, done his stern duty, he left behind him an execrating\r\ncountry to find that his little nephews ran away and hid themselves,\r\nin terror of his notorious cruelty.”[1123]--Burton’s _Scotland_,\r\n(1689-1748), vol. ii. p. 507.\r\n\r\n[1123] “The bravery of the Duke of Cumberland,” says the first\r\nhistorian of our day, “was such as distinguished him even among the\r\nprinces of his brave house. The indifference with which he rode about\r\namidst musket-balls and cannon-balls, was not the highest proof of\r\nhis fortitude. Hopeless maladies--horrible surgical operations--far\r\nfrom unmanning him, did not even discompose him. With courage, he had\r\nthe virtues which are akin to courage. He spoke the truth, was open\r\nin enmity and friendship, and upright in all his dealings. But his\r\nnature was hard; and what seemed to him justice, was rarely tempered\r\nwith mercy. He was therefore, during many years, one of the most\r\nunpopular men in England. The severity with which he treated the\r\nrebels after the battle of Culloden, had gained him the name of ‘the\r\nbutcher.’ His attempts to introduce into the army of England, then\r\nin a most disorderly state, the rigorous discipline of Potsdam, had\r\nexcited still stronger disgust. Nothing was too bad to be believed\r\nof him. Many honest people were so absurd as to fancy that if he\r\nwere left regent during the minority of his nephews, there would be\r\nanother smothering in the tower.”--_Macaulay’s Essays--Chatham._\r\n\r\n[1124] Marchant, p. 328.\r\n\r\n[1125] Marchant, p. 329.\r\n\r\n[1126] _Kirkconnel MS._ Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 167.

The statement given\r\nby Mr. Hume,--that Lady Mackintosh concealed Lord Loudon’s design\r\nfrom the prince, and that he knew nothing of his lordship’s march\r\ntill next morning, is certainly erroneous. He says that “without\r\nsaying a word to Charles or any of his company, she (Lady Mackintosh)\r\nordered five or six of her people, well armed, under the conduct of a\r\ncountry smith, to watch the road from Inverness, and give notice if\r\nthey should perceive any number of men coming towards Moy;” and that\r\n“Charles, for whose safety the lady had provided so effectually, knew\r\nnothing of Lord Loudon’s march till next morning; for he was up and\r\ndressed when the smith and his party came to Moy, and gave an account\r\nof their victory.” It is clear, however, that the blacksmith and his\r\nparty were sent out by Lady Mackintosh before the arrival of the boy,\r\nas Gib, the prince’s master of the household, who was sleeping in his\r\nclothes in the Castle of Moy when the boy arrived, says expressly\r\nthat the blacksmith’s adventure “happened much about the time when\r\nthe boy (Lauchlan Mackintosh) arrived at Moy to give the alarm.

As it was\r\nhis intention to proceed by the coast road, he had ordered a number\r\nof victualling ships to rendezvous at Aberdeen; and early in April,\r\nthese vessels, escorted by several ships of war provided with\r\nartillery, ammunition, and other warlike stores, had arrived at their\r\ndestination, for the purpose of following the army along the coast\r\nand affording the necessary supplies. About this time the weather had\r\nbecome favourable, and though still cold, the snow had disappeared,\r\nand a dry wind which had prevailed for some days had rendered the\r\nriver Spey, the passage of which was considered the most formidable\r\nobstacle to his march, fordable.[1166]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 8th of April the duke left Aberdeen with the\r\nlast division of his army, consisting of six battalions of foot and\r\na regiment of dragoons. The whole regular force under his command\r\namounted to about 7,200 men, comprehending fifteen regiments of foot,\r\ntwo of dragoons, and Kingston’s horse. Besides these, there were the\r\nArgyleshire men and other militia, whose united numbers may be stated\r\nat 2,000. At the time of the duke’s departure, six battalions, with\r\nKingston’s horse and Cobham’s dragoons, under Major-general Bland,\r\nwere stationed at Strathbogie, and three battalions at Old Meldrum,\r\nunder Brigadier Mordaunt. The duke quartered the first night at\r\nOld Meldrum and the next at Banff, where two spies were seized and\r\nhanged. One of them was caught while in the act of notching upon a\r\nstick the number of the duke’s forces.[1167] On the 11th the duke\r\nmarched to Cullen, and at Portsoy he was joined by the remainder of\r\nhis army, which had been stationed at Old Meldrum and Strathbogie.\r\nThe army being too numerous to obtain quarters in the town, the foot\r\nencamped for the night on some ploughed fields in the neighbourhood,\r\nand the horse were quartered in Cullen and the adjacent villages.\r\nThe Earl of Findlater, who, with his countess, had accompanied the\r\narmy on its march from Aberdeen, on arriving at his seat at Cullen,\r\nmade a present of two hundred guineas to the troops.\r\n\r\nNext day, being Saturday, the 12th of April, the duke put his army\r\nagain in motion, and, after a short march, halted on the moor of\r\nArrondel, about five or six miles from the river Spey. He then formed\r\nhis army into three divisions, each about half a mile distant from\r\nthe other, and in this order they advanced towards the Spey. The\r\nleft division, which was the largest, crossed the river by a ford\r\nnear Gormach, the centre by another close by Gordon castle, and the\r\ndivision on the right by a ford near the church of Belly. In their\r\npassage, the men were up to their waists in the water, but, with the\r\nexception of the loss of one dragoon and four women, who were carried\r\naway by the stream, no accident occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth, who happened at this time to be with the Highland\r\nforces appointed to defend the passage of the Spey, not thinking\r\nit advisable to dispute the position against such an overwhelming\r\nforce as that to which he was opposed, retired towards Elgin on the\r\napproach of the Duke of Cumberland. The conduct of the Duke of Perth,\r\nand of his brother, Lord John Drummond, has been censured for not\r\ndisputing the passage of the Spey, but without reason. The whole of\r\nthe Highland forces along the Spey did not exceed 2,500 men, being\r\nlittle more than a fourth of those under the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nNotwithstanding this great disparity, the Highlanders, aided by\r\nthe swollen state of the river, might have effectually opposed the\r\npassage of the royal army had it been attempted during the month of\r\nMarch, but a recent drought had greatly reduced the quantity of water\r\nin the river, and had rendered it fordable in several places to such\r\nan extent, that at two of them a whole battalion might have marched\r\nabreast. As some of the fords run in a zig-zag direction, some damage\r\nmight have been done to the royal army in crossing; but as the Duke\r\nof Cumberland had a good train of artillery, he could have easily\r\ncovered his passage at these places.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the Duke of Cumberland from Aberdeen was not known\r\nat Inverness till the 12th, on the morning of which day intelligence\r\nwas brought to Charles that he was in full march to the north with\r\nhis whole army. Shortly after his arrival at Inverness, Charles had\r\nformed the design, while the Duke of Cumberland lay at Aberdeen, of\r\ngiving him the slip, by marching to Perth by the Highland road, so\r\nas to induce the duke to return south, and thus leave the northern\r\ncoast clear for the landing of supplies from France. With this\r\nview, he had directed the siege of Fort William to be pushed, and,\r\ncalculating upon a speedy reduction of that fortress, had sent orders\r\nto the Macdonalds, the Camerons, and the Stewarts, who were engaged\r\nin the siege, immediately on the capture of the fort to march into\r\nArgyleshire, and, after chastising the whigs in that district,\r\nand giving an opportunity to their friends there to join them, to\r\nproceed to Perth.[1168] Charles, however, for the present, laid\r\naside the intention of marching south, and knowing that the Duke of\r\nCumberland would advance from Aberdeen early in April, he gave orders\r\nfor concentrating his forces at Inverness, and, as soon as he was\r\ninformed of the duke’s march, he renewed these orders, by sending\r\nexpresses every where to bring up his men. Those who had been at the\r\nsiege of Fort William were already on their march, but Lord Cromarty\r\nwas at a considerable distance with a large body of men, and could\r\nscarcely be expected to arrive in time if the duke was resolved on an\r\nimmediate action.[1169]\r\n\r\nBesides the men who were absent on the expeditions in Lochaber and\r\nSutherland, there were many others who had returned to their homes,\r\neither discontented with the situation in which they found themselves\r\nafter they came to Inverness, or to see their families or friends.\r\nUp to the period of their arrival there, they had received their\r\npay punctually, but at Inverness the face of affairs was completely\r\nchanged in this respect, and instead of money the troops were reduced\r\nto a weekly allowance of oatmeal. The men murmured at first at the\r\nstoppage of their pay, but their clamours were quieted by their\r\nofficers, who gave them assurances that a supply of money would soon\r\nbe received from France. This expectation would have been realised,\r\nbut for the misfortune which befell the _Prince Charles_, and in\r\nconsequence of that event, the soldiers began to murmur afresh, and\r\nsome of them seeing no pressing occasion for their attendance, and\r\nchoosing rather to enjoy a frugal repast with their friends at home\r\nthan serve without pay, left the army. These absentees, however, had\r\nno intention of abandoning the service, and were resolved to rejoin\r\ntheir colours as soon as they saw a probability of coming to action.\r\nAccordingly, many of those who had returned to their homes set out\r\nof their own accord to rejoin the army, on hearing of the Duke of\r\nCumberland’s advance, though few of them arrived in time for the\r\nbattle.[1170]\r\n\r\nReduced in numbers as the prince’s army was from the causes alluded\r\nto, they still burned with impatience to meet the enemy; and when\r\nintelligence of the Duke of Cumberland’s march from Aberdeen reached\r\nInverness, it was hailed with joy by the portion there assembled.\r\nFrom the fatigues and labours they had experienced during the\r\ncampaign, and the numerous inconveniences to which they had been\r\nsubjected from the want of pay, there was nothing the Highlanders\r\ndreaded more than another march to the south; but the near prospect\r\nthey now had of meeting the English army upon their own soil, and of\r\nputting an end to the war by one bold and decisive blow, absorbed\r\nfor a while all recollection of their past sufferings. By drawing\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland north to Inverness, it was generally supposed\r\nthat the prince could meet him on more equal terms than at Aberdeen,\r\nas he would have a better and more numerous army at Inverness, than\r\nhe could have carried south. This unquestionably would have been\r\nthe case had Charles avoided a battle till he had assembled all his\r\ntroops, but his confidence on the present occasion got the better of\r\nhis prudence.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Spey, the Duke of Cumberland halted his army on\r\nthe western bank, and encamped opposite to Fochabers, but the horse\r\nafterwards repassed the river and took up their quarters in the\r\ntown. Here, as at Cullen, every precaution was taken to prevent\r\nsurprise. Early next morning he raised his camp, and passing through\r\nElgin, encamped on the moor of Alves, nearly midway between Elgin\r\nand Forres. The Duke of Perth, who had passed the previous night at\r\nForres, retired to Nairn upon his approach. The Duke of Cumberland\r\nrenewed his march on the 14th and came to Nairn, where the Duke of\r\nPerth remained till he was within a mile of the town, and began his\r\nretreat in sight of the English army. In this retreat, Clanranald’s\r\nregiment, with the French piquets and Fitz-James’s horse, formed the\r\nrear. To harass the rear, and retard the march of the main body till\r\nsome of his foot should come up, the Duke of Cumberland sent forward\r\nhis cavalry. Several shots were exchanged between the duke’s cavalry\r\nand the French horse, and in expectation of an engagement with the\r\nduke’s advanced guard, consisting of 200 cavalry and the Argyleshire\r\nmen, the Macdonalds of Clanranald, and the Stewarts of Appin, were\r\nordered back to support the French. These regiments accordingly\r\nreturned and took ground, and Fitz-James’s horse formed on their\r\nright and left. The duke’s advanced guard thereupon halted, and\r\nformed in order of battle, but as the main body of the English army\r\nwas in full march the rear recommenced their retreat. The advanced\r\nguard continued to pursue the Highlanders several miles beyond Nairn,\r\nbut finding the chase useless, returned to the main body which was\r\npreparing to encamp on a plain to the west of Nairn.[1171]\r\n\r\nNeither at the time when Charles received intelligence of the Duke of\r\nCumberland’s march to Aberdeen, nor till the following day (Sunday),\r\nwhen news was brought to him that the English army had actually\r\ncrossed the Spey, does Charles appear to have had any intention of\r\nspeedily risking a battle. He probably expected that with the aid\r\nof the reinforcements he had sent to support the Duke of Perth, his\r\ngrace would have been able, for some time at least, to maintain a\r\nposition on the western bank of the river, and that time would be\r\nthus afforded him to collect the scattered portions of his army,\r\nbefore being compelled, by the advance of the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nto come to a general engagement. But whatever his intentions were\r\nanterior to the receipt of the intelligence of the English army\r\nhaving crossed the Spey, that circumstance alone made him determine\r\nto attack the Duke of Cumberland without waiting for the return of\r\nhis absent detachments.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morning of the 14th, Charles ordered the drums to\r\nbeat, and the pipes to play, as the signal for summoning his men to\r\narms. After those who were in the town had assembled in the streets,\r\nthe prince mounted his horse, and putting himself at their head, led\r\nthem out to Culloden, about four miles from Inverness.[1172] Leaving\r\npart of his men in the parks around Culloden house, Charles went\r\nonward with his first troop of guards and the Mackintosh regiment,\r\nand advanced within six miles of Nairn to support the Duke of Perth,\r\nbut finding him out of danger, he returned to Culloden, where he was\r\njoined by the whole of the duke’s forces in the evening. Lochiel\r\nalso arrived at the same time with his regiment. That night the\r\nHighlanders bivouacked among the furze of Culloden wood, and Charles\r\nand his principal officers lodged in Culloden house.\r\n\r\nHaving selected Drummossie moor for a field of battle, Prince Charles\r\nmarched his army thither early on the morning of the 15th, and drew\r\nhis men up in order of battle across the moor, which is about half a\r\nmile broad. His front looked towards Nairn, and he had the river of\r\nthat name on his right, and the inclosures of Culloden on his left.\r\nThis moor, which is a heathy flat of considerable extent about five\r\nmiles from Inverness and about a mile and a half to the south-east of\r\nCulloden house, forms the top of a hill which, rising at Culloden,\r\ndies gradually away in the direction of Nairn. The ascent to the moor\r\nis steep on both sides, particularly from the shore. In pitching\r\nupon this ground, Charles acted on the supposition that the Duke of\r\nCumberland would march along the moor, which was better fitted for\r\nthe free passage of his army than the common road between Nairn and\r\nInverness, which was narrow and inconvenient.\r\n\r\nIn expectation that the Duke of Cumberland would advance, Charles\r\nsent forward on the road to Nairn some parties of horse to\r\nreconnoitre, but they could observe no appearance of any movement\r\namong the royal troops. The ground on which the army was now formed\r\nhad been chosen without consulting Lord George Murray, who, on\r\narriving on the spot, objected to it, on the footing that though\r\ninterspersed with moss and some hollows, the ground was generally\r\ntoo level, and consequently not well suited for the operation of\r\nHighlanders. He therefore proposed to look out for more eligible\r\nground, and at his suggestion Brigadier Stapleton and Colonel Ker\r\nwere sent about ten o’clock to survey some hilly ground on the south\r\nside of the water of Nairn, which appeared to him to be steep and\r\nuneven, and of course more advantageous for Highlanders. After an\r\nabsence of two or three hours, these officers returned and reported\r\nthat the ground they had been appointed to examine was rugged and\r\nboggy, that no cavalry could act upon it, that the ascent on the\r\nside next the river was steep, and that there were only two or\r\nthree places, about three or four miles above, where cavalry could\r\npass; the banks of the river below being inaccessible. On receiving\r\nthis information, Lord George Murray proposed, in the event of\r\nCumberland’s forces not appearing that day, that the army should\r\ncross the water of Nairn, and draw up in line of battle next day,\r\nupon the ground which had been surveyed; and that, should the Duke\r\nof Cumberland not venture to cross after them and engage them upon\r\nthe ground in question, they might watch a favourable opportunity of\r\nattacking him with advantage. In the event of no such opportunity\r\noffering, his lordship said he would recommend that the army\r\nshould, with the view of drawing the duke after them, retire to the\r\nneighbouring mountains, where they might attack him at some pass or\r\nstrong ground. This proposal met with the general approbation of\r\nthe commanding officers; but Charles who, two days before (when a\r\nsuggestion was made to him to retire to a strong position till all\r\nhis army should assemble), had declared his resolution to attack\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland even with a thousand men only, declined to\r\naccede to it. His grounds were that such a retrograde movement\r\nmight discourage the men, by impressing them with a belief that\r\nthere existed a desire on the part of their commanders to shun the\r\nEnglish army; that Inverness, which was now in their rear, would\r\nbe exposed, and that the Duke of Cumberland might march upon that\r\ntown, and possess himself of the greater part of their baggage and\r\nammunition.[1173]\r\n\r\nConcluding from the inactivity of the Duke of Cumberland that he had\r\nno intention of marching that day, Charles held a council of war in\r\nthe afternoon, to deliberate upon the course it might be considered\r\nmost advisable to pursue in consequence of the duke’s stay at Nairn.\r\nAccording to Charles’s own statement, he had formed the bold and\r\ndesperate design of surprising the English army in their camp during\r\nthe night; but, desirous of knowing the views of his officers before\r\ndivulging his plan, he allowed all the members of the council to\r\nspeak before him. After hearing the sentiments of the chiefs, and\r\nthe other commanders who were present, Lord George Murray proposed\r\nto attack the Duke of Cumberland during the night, provided it was\r\nthe general opinion that the attack could be made before one or two\r\no’clock in the morning. Charles, overjoyed at the suggestion of his\r\nlieutenant-general, immediately embraced him, said that he approved\r\nof it, that in fact he had contemplated the measure himself, but that\r\nhe did not intend to have disclosed it till all the members of the\r\ncouncil had delivered their sentiments.\r\n\r\nHad the army been in a condition to sustain the fatigue of a\r\nnight-march of ten or twelve miles, the plan of a night attack was\r\nunquestionably the best that could have been devised under existing\r\ncircumstances. If surprised in the dark, even supposing the duke\r\nto have been on his guard, a night attack appeared to afford the\r\nonly chance of getting the better of his superiority in numbers and\r\ndiscipline, and of rendering his cavalry and cannon, in which his\r\nchief strength lay, utterly useless. But the Highland army, from\r\nsome unaccountable oversight on the part of the persons who had the\r\ncharge of the commissariat department, was in a state bordering upon\r\nstarvation, and consequently not able to perform such a fatiguing\r\nmarch. Although there was a quantity of meal in Inverness and the\r\nneighbourhood sufficient for a fortnight’s consumption, no care had\r\nbeen taken to supply the men with an allowance on leaving Inverness,\r\nand the consequence was, that during this and the preceding day very\r\nfew of them had tasted a particle of food. To appease their hunger\r\na single biscuit was distributed to each man, but this pittance\r\nonly increased the desire for more; and hunger getting the better\r\nof patience, some of the men began to leave the ranks in quest of\r\nprovisions. In spite, however, of the deprivation under which they\r\nlaboured, the army was never in higher spirits, or more desirous\r\nto meet the enemy; and it was not until all hopes of an immediate\r\nengagement were abandoned that the men thought of looking out for the\r\nmeans of subsistence.[1174]\r\n\r\nThe expediency of a night attack was admitted by all the members of\r\nthe council, but there were a few who thought that it should not\r\nbe ventured upon until the arrival of the rest of the army, which\r\nmight be expected in two or three days at farthest. Keppoch with his\r\nHighlanders had just come up and joined the army; but the Mackenzies\r\nunder Lord Cromarty, a body of the Frasers whom the Master of Lovat\r\nhad collected to complete his second battalion, the Macphersons under\r\nCluny, their chief, the Macgregors under Glengyle, a party headed by\r\nMackinnon, and a body of Glengarry’s men under Barisdale, were still\r\nat a distance, though supposed to be all on their march to Inverness.\r\nThe minority objected that, should they fail in the attempt, and be\r\nrepulsed, it would be difficult to rally the Highlanders,--that even\r\nsupposing no spy should give the Duke of Cumberland notice of their\r\napproach, he might, if alarmed by any of his patrols, have time to\r\nput his army in order in his camp, place his cannon, charged with\r\ncartouch-shot, as he pleased, and get all his horse in readiness to\r\npursue the Highlanders if beat off. Besides these objections, they\r\nurged the difficulty of making a retreat if many of their men were\r\nwounded, from the aversion of the Highlanders to leave their wounded\r\nbehind them. They, moreover, observed that they had no intelligence\r\nof the situation of the duke’s camp; and that even could a safe\r\nretreat be made, the fatigue of marching forwards and backwards\r\ntwenty miles would be too much for men to endure, who would probably\r\nhave to fight next day.[1175]\r\n\r\nAll these arguments were however thrown away upon Charles, who,\r\nsupported by the Duke of Perth, Lord George Murray, Lord John\r\nDrummond, Lochiel, and others, showed the utmost impatience for an\r\nimmediate attack. Those who supported this view were not insensible\r\nto the danger which might ensue should the attack miscarry; but,\r\nstrange to say, they were urged to it from the very cause to which\r\nthe failure was chiefly owing, the want of provisions. Apprehensive\r\nthat if the army was kept on the moor all night, many of the men\r\nwould go away to a considerable distance in search of food, and that\r\nit would be very difficult to assemble them speedily in the event of\r\na sudden alarm, they considered an immediate attack, particularly as\r\nCharles had resolved to fight without waiting for reinforcements, as\r\na less desperate course than remaining where they were.[1176]\r\n\r\nTo prevent the Duke of Cumberland from obtaining any knowledge of the\r\nadvance of the Highlanders from the spies who might be within view\r\nof his army, Charles fixed upon eight o’clock for his departure, by\r\nwhich time his motions would be concealed from observation by the\r\nobscurity of the evening. Meanwhile the commanding officers repaired\r\nto their respective regiments to put their men in readiness; but\r\nbetween six and seven o’clock an incident occurred which almost put\r\nan end to the enterprise. This was the departure of a large number\r\nof the men, who, ignorant of the intended march, went off towards\r\nInverness and adjacent places to procure provisions and quarters for\r\nthe night. Officers from the different regiments were immediately\r\ndespatched on horseback to bring them back, but no persuasion could\r\ninduce the men to return, who gave as their reason for refusing that\r\nthey were starving. They told the officers that they might shoot them\r\nif they pleased, but that they would not go back till they got some\r\nprovisions.[1177] By this defection Charles lost about 2,000 men,\r\nbeing about a third of his army.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence completely changed the aspect of affairs, and every\r\nmember of the council who had formerly advocated a night attack\r\nnow warmly opposed it. Charles, bent upon his purpose, resolutely\r\ninsisted upon the measure, and said that when the march was begun the\r\nmen who had gone off would return and follow the rest. The confidence\r\nwhich he had in the bravery of his army blinded him to every danger,\r\nand he was prompted in his determination to persist in the attempt\r\nfrom an idea that Cumberland’s army having been that day engaged\r\nin celebrating the birth-day of their commander, would after their\r\ndebauch fall an easy prey to the Highlanders.\r\n\r\nFinding the prince fully resolved to make the attempt at all hazards,\r\nthe commanding officers took their stations, waiting the order\r\nto march. The watchword was, “King James the VIII.,” and special\r\ninstructions were issued to the army, that in making the attack the\r\ntroops should not make use of their fire-arms, but confine themselves\r\nto their swords, dirks, and bayonets; and that on entering the Duke\r\nof Cumberland’s camp they should cut the tent strings and pull down\r\nthe poles, and that wherever they observed a swelling or bulge in\r\nthe fallen covering, they should strike and push vigorously with\r\ntheir swords and dirks.[1178] Before marching, directions were given\r\nto several small parties to possess all the roads, in order to\r\nprevent any intelligence of their march being carried to the Duke of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nIn giving his orders to march, Charles embraced Lord George Murray,\r\nwho immediately went off at the head of the line, about eight\r\no’clock, preceded by two officers, and about thirty men of the\r\nMackintosh regiment, who from their knowledge of the country were\r\nto act as guides. Though the whole army marched in one line, there\r\nwas an interval in the middle as if it consisted of two columns. The\r\nAthole men led the van, and next to them were the Camerons, who were\r\nfollowed by the other clans. The low country regiments, the French\r\npiquets, and the horse, formed the rear. Lord John Drummond was in\r\nthe centre, or at the head of the second column; and the Duke of\r\nPerth and Charles, who had Fitz-James’s and other horse with him,\r\nwere towards the rear. Besides the party of Mackintoshes, who served\r\nas guides in front, there were others of that clan stationed in the\r\ncentre and rear, and generally along the line, to prevent any of the\r\nmen from losing their way in the dark.[1179] The plan of attack, as\r\nlaid down by Lord George Murray, was as follows:--The army was to\r\nhave marched in a body till they passed the house of Kilraick or\r\nKilravock, which is about ten miles from Culloden, on the direct road\r\nto Nairn. The army was then to have been divided, and while Lord\r\nGeorge Murray crossed the river Nairn with the van, making about\r\none-third of the whole, and marched down by the south side of the\r\nriver, the remainder was to have continued its march along the north\r\nside till both divisions came near the duke’s camp. The van was then\r\nto have re-crossed the river, and attacked the royal army from the\r\nsouth, while the other part was to have attacked it at the same time\r\nfrom the west.[1180] With the exception of Charles, who promised upon\r\nhis honour not to divulge it to any person, and Anderson, who acted\r\nas guide at the battle of Preston, no person was made privy to the\r\nplan, as its success depended upon its secrecy.\r\n\r\nIn the outset of the march the van proceeded with considerable\r\nexpedition, but it had gone scarcely half a mile when Lord George\r\nMurray received an express ordering him to halt till joined by the\r\nrear column, which was a considerable way behind. As a halt in the\r\nvan always occasions a much longer one in the rear when the march is\r\nresumed, Lord George did not halt but slackened his pace to enable\r\nthe rear to join. This, however, was to no purpose, as the rear still\r\nkept behind, and although, in consequence of numerous expresses\r\nenjoining him to wait, Lord George marched slower and slower, the\r\nrear fell still farther behind, and before he had marched six miles\r\nhe had received at least fifty expresses ordering him either to halt\r\nor to slacken his pace. The chief cause of the stoppage was the\r\nbadness of the roads.\r\n\r\nAbout one o’clock in the morning, when the van was opposite to the\r\nhouse of Kilravock, Lord John Drummond came up and stated to Lord\r\nGeorge Murray that unless he halted or marched much slower the\r\nrear would not be able to join. The Duke of Perth having shortly\r\nthereafter also come up to the front and given a similar assurance,\r\nhis lordship halted near a small farm-house called Yellow Knowe,\r\nbelonging to Rose of Kilravock, nearly four miles from Nairn, and\r\nabout a mile from the place where it was intended the van should\r\ncross the river. In the wood of Kilravock the march of the rear was\r\ngreatly retarded by a long narrow defile occasioned partly by a stone\r\nwall; and so fatigued and faint had the men become, by the badness\r\nof the road, and want of food, that many of them, unable to proceed,\r\nlay down in the wood. This circumstance was announced to Lord George\r\nMurray by several officers who came up from the rear shortly after\r\nthe van had halted. Nearly all the principal officers, including\r\nthe Duke of Perth, Lord George Murray, Lord John Drummond, Lochiel,\r\nand General O’Sullivan, were now in the van, and having ascertained\r\nby their watches, which they looked at in a little house close by,\r\nthat it was two o’clock in the morning, they at once perceived the\r\nimpossibility of surprising the English army. The van was still\r\nupwards of three, and the rear about four miles from Nairn, and as\r\nthey had only been able to advance hitherto at a rate little more\r\nthan a mile in the hour, it was not to be expected that the army in\r\nits exhausted state would be able to accomplish the remainder of the\r\ndistance, within the time prescribed, even at a more accelerated\r\npace. By a quick march the army could not have advanced two miles\r\nbefore day-break; so that the Duke of Cumberland would have had\r\nsufficient time to put his army in fighting order before an attack\r\ncould have been made. These were sufficient reasons of themselves\r\nfor abandoning the enterprise, but when it is considered that the\r\narmy had been greatly diminished during the march, and that scarcely\r\none-half of the men that were drawn up the day before on Drummossie\r\nmoor remained, the propriety of a retreat becomes undoubted.[1181]\r\n\r\nLord George Murray,--who had never contemplated any thing but a\r\nsurprise, and whose calculation of reaching Nairn by two o’clock\r\nin the morning would have been realised had the whole line marched\r\nwith the same celerity as the first four or five regiments,--would\r\nhave been perfectly justified in the unexpected situation in which\r\nhe was placed, in at once ordering a retreat;[1182] but desirous\r\nof ascertaining the sentiments of the officers about him, he\r\nrequested them to state their views of the course they thought it\r\nmost advisable to adopt. There were several gentlemen present, who,\r\nhaving joined the Athole brigade as volunteers, had marched all\r\nnight in the front: and as the Duke of Perth, Lord John Drummond,\r\nand the other officers, seemed at a loss what to resolve upon, Lord\r\nGeorge Murray requested the volunteers to give their free opinion,\r\nas they were all equally interested in the consequences. Without\r\nhesitation all these gentlemen, eager to come to an engagement, were\r\nfor marching, but most of the officers, particularly Lochiel and his\r\nbrother, Dr. Cameron, were of a different opinion, in which they were\r\nbacked by Lord George Murray, who observed that if they could have\r\nmade the attack within the time prescribed they would certainly have\r\nsucceeded, especially if they could have surprised the enemy; but to\r\nattack in daylight an army that was nearly double their number, and\r\nwhich would be prepared to receive them, would be considered an act\r\nof madness.[1184]\r\n\r\nAmong the volunteers the most conspicuous was Mr. Hepburn of Keith.\r\nWhile arguing for an attack with Lord George Murray, the beating of\r\na drum was heard in the Duke of Cumberland’s camp. “Don’t you hear,”\r\nsaid Lord George; “the enemy are alarmed; we can’t surprise them.”\r\n“I never expected,” said Hepburn, “to find the red coats asleep;\r\nbut they will be drunk after solemnising the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\nbirth-day. It is much better to march on and attack them than to\r\nretreat, for they will most certainly follow, and oblige us to fight\r\nwhen we shall be in a much worse condition to fight them than we\r\nare now.” While this altercation was going on, Mr. John Hay, then\r\nacting as interim-secretary to the prince instead of Secretary\r\nMurray, who was unwell, came up and informed Lord George that the\r\nline had joined. Gathering from the conversation he overheard that a\r\nretreat was resolved upon, he began to argue against it, but being\r\nunsuccessful he immediately rode back to Charles, who was in the rear\r\nof the first column, and told him that unless he came to the front\r\nand ordered Lord George to go on nothing would be done. Charles, who\r\nwas on horseback, rode forward immediately towards the front, to\r\nascertain the cause of the halt, and on his way met the van in full\r\nretreat. He was no doubt surprised at this step, and in a temporary\r\nfit of irritation, is said to have remarked that Lord George Murray\r\nhad betrayed him;[1185] but Lord George immediately convinced him “of\r\nthe unavoidable necessity of retreating.”[1186]\r\n\r\nThe army marched back in two columns, by a different but more direct\r\nroute than that by which it had advanced. In returning they had a\r\nview of the fires in the Duke of Cumberland’s camp. The greater part\r\nof the army arrived at Culloden, whither it had been agreed upon to\r\nproceed, about five o’clock in the morning, and the remainder did not\r\nremain long behind. The quick return of the army suggests an idea\r\nthat had it marched in double columns towards Nairn by the shortest\r\nroute, it might have reached its destination at least an hour sooner\r\nthan the time contemplated by Lord George Murray, but there was great\r\ndanger, that, by adopting such a course, the Duke of Cumberland would\r\nhave obtained notice of the advance of the Highlanders.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Culloden, the prince gave orders to bring provisions\r\nto the field; but the calls of hunger could not brook delay, and\r\nmany of the common men as well as officers slipped off to Inverness\r\nand the neighbourhood in quest of refreshment. Others, from absolute\r\nexhaustion, lay down on the ground, and sought a momentary respite\r\nin the arms of sleep. Charles himself, with his principal officers,\r\nwent to Culloden house, where, sullen, dejected, and silent, they for\r\na time stared at one another with amazement, instead of deliberating\r\nupon the course they ought to pursue at this critical juncture.\r\nA search was made for food, but with the exception of a little\r\nbread and a small quantity of whisky, which was procured for the\r\nprince with great difficulty, no refreshment of any kind could be\r\nobtained.[1187]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Culloden House. From Original Sketch in possession\r\nof Duncan Forbes, Esq., of Culloden.]\r\n\r\nAfter a short repose the men were aroused from their slumbers by\r\ntheir officers, who informed them that the Duke of Cumberland’s army\r\nwas approaching. There were others whom hunger had kept awake,\r\nand who having seized and killed some cattle and sheep which they\r\nfound at Culloden, were preparing a repast, but few of them had\r\ntime to make any thing ready before the alarm was given.[1188] The\r\nintelligence of Cumberland’s advance was first brought to Culloden\r\nhouse about eight o’clock by one Cameron, a lieutenant in Lochiel’s\r\nregiment, who, having fallen asleep at the place where the halt was\r\nmade, had been left behind. As Fitz-James’s horse and others had gone\r\nto Inverness to refresh, and as those who remained were, from the\r\nhard duty they had performed for several days and nights, unfit for\r\npatrolling, Charles had no means of ascertaining whether the troops\r\nthat were approaching were merely an advanced party, or the whole\r\nof the English army. That nothing might be left to conjecture at\r\nsuch an important crisis, some officers were instantly despatched to\r\nInverness, to bring back the men whom hunger had driven thither, and\r\nthe Highlanders at Culloden were got ready as quickly as possible,\r\nand marched through the parks of Culloden in battalions, as they\r\nhappened to be lying, to Drummossie moor, on a part of which, about\r\nhalf a mile to the west of the place where they had been drawn up\r\nthe day before, the army halted. Lord George Murray now renewed his\r\nproposal to pass the water of Nairn, and take up a position on the\r\nground which had been surveyed the previous morning, as being much\r\nbetter fitted for Highlanders than the level on which they stood.\r\nAn additional reason for passing the Nairn was, that Macpherson of\r\nCluny, who was expected every moment with his clan, was to come on\r\nthe south side. Charles, however, again rejected this judicious\r\nadvice, for the reasons he had formerly given.[1189] By retiring\r\nbeyond Inverness, or among the fastnesses to the south of the water\r\nof Nairn, an action might have been easily avoided for several days;\r\nand, as the projected night attack had miscarried, it would certainly\r\nhave been a wise course to have shunned an engagement till the men\r\nhad recovered their strength and spirits; but Charles, over-sanguine\r\nin all his calculations, and swayed by his creatures and sycophants,\r\nwas deaf to the suggestions of wisdom. It seems strange that a\r\nretreat to Inverness was not proposed. By retiring into the town, and\r\noccupying the grounds in the neighbourhood, a delay of twenty-four\r\nhours might have been obtained, as it is not likely that the Duke of\r\nCumberland would have attempted to force the town, or a strong camp,\r\nthe same day he marched from Nairn. By postponing the engagement\r\ntill next day, a very different result might have happened, as the\r\nHighlanders, who were in a starving condition, would have had time to\r\nprocure provisions and recruit from their fatigue; and numbers, who\r\nwere not able to come up in time to Culloden, would have rejoined the\r\nranks at Inverness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland had been informed of the night march towards\r\nNairn by some Highland spies whom he had in his pay, and who had\r\nmixed with the insurgents as they marched; but the spies were\r\nignorant of the intended surprise, which was kept a profound secret\r\nfrom the Highland army. Judging from the intelligence brought by\r\nthe last person that arrived in his camp, that the Highlanders were\r\ncoming directly in his front, the duke considered himself free from\r\nsurprise, as the Argyleshire men lay on the plain to the west of his\r\ncamp, while a party of dragoons patrolled all night between Nairn and\r\nthe sea. He therefore ordered his men to take some rest, but to keep\r\ntheir arms in readiness. He appears not to have anticipated an attack\r\nduring the night, but to have imagined that Charles merely meant to\r\ntake ground during the night, and to attack him early next morning.\r\nIn expectation of a battle, the duke had formed his army by break of\r\nday, and, having ascertained that the Highland army had retreated,\r\nhe began his march towards Inverness about five o’clock.[1190] The\r\nEnglish army had, as anticipated, celebrated the birth-day of their\r\ncommander; but although they were amply supplied with bread, cheese,\r\nand brandy, at the duke’s expense, the men had not exceeded the\r\nbounds of moderation.[1191]\r\n\r\nBefore commencing the march, written instructions, which had been\r\ncommunicated to the commanders of the different regiments, were\r\nread at the head of every company in the line. These instructions\r\nwere, that if the persons to whom the charge of the train or baggage\r\nhorses was entrusted should abscond or leave them, they should be\r\npunished with immediate death; and that if any officer or soldier\r\nmisconducted himself during the engagement, he should be sentenced.\r\nThe infantry marched in three parallel divisions or columns, of five\r\nregiments each, headed by General Huske on the left, Lord Sempill\r\non the right, and General Mordaunt in the centre. The artillery and\r\nbaggage followed the first column on the right, and the dragoons and\r\nhorse, led by Generals Hawley and Bland, were on the left, forming a\r\nfourth column. Forty of Kingston’s horse and Argyleshire men formed\r\nthe van.[1192]\r\n\r\nThe charge of forming the Highland army in line of battle on this\r\nimportant occasion was intrusted to O’Sullivan, who acted in the\r\ndouble capacity of adjutant and quarter-master general. This officer,\r\nin the opinion of Lord George Murray, a high authority certainly, was\r\nexceedingly unfit for such a task, and committed gross blunders on\r\nevery occasion of moment. In the present instance, he did not even\r\nvisit the ground where the army was to be drawn up, and he committed\r\na “fatal error” by omitting to throw down some park walls upon the\r\nleft of the English army, which were afterwards taken possession\r\nof by the Duke of Cumberland, it being found afterwards impossible\r\nto break the English lines, from the destructive flank-fire which\r\nwas opened from these walls upon the right of the Highland army, as\r\nit advanced to the attack.[1193] While the Duke of Cumberland was\r\nforming his line of battle, Lord George Murray was very desirous to\r\nadvance and throw down these walls; but as such a movement would have\r\nbroken the line, the officers about him considered that the attempt\r\nwould be dangerous, and he therefore did not make it.[1194]\r\n\r\nThe Highland army was drawn up in three lines. The first, or front\r\nline, consisted of the Athole brigade, which had the right, the\r\nCamerons, Stewarts of Appin, Frasers, Macintoshes, Maclachlans,\r\nMacleans, John Roy Stewart’s regiment, and Farquharsons, united into\r\none regiment; the Macleods, Chisholms, Macdonalds of Clanranald,\r\nKeppoch, and Glengarry. The three Macdonald regiments formed the\r\nleft. Lord George Murray commanded on the right, Lord John Drummond\r\nin the centre, and the Duke of Perth on the left, of the first line.\r\nThere had been, a day or two before, a violent contention among the\r\nchiefs about precedency of rank. The Macdonalds claimed the right as\r\ntheir due, in support of which claim they stated, that as a reward\r\nfor the fidelity of Angus Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, in protecting\r\nRobert the Bruce for upwards of nine months in his dominions, that\r\nprince, at the battle of Bannockburn, conferred the post of honour,\r\nthe right, upon the Macdonalds,--that this post had ever since been\r\nenjoyed by them, unless when yielded from courtesy upon particular\r\noccasions, as was done to the chief of the Macleans at the battle of\r\nHarlaw.[1195] Lord George Murray, however, maintained that, under the\r\nMarquis of Montrose, the right had been assigned to the Athole men,\r\nand he insisted that that post should be now conferred upon them, in\r\nthe contest with the Duke of Cumberland’s army. In this unseasonable\r\ndemand, Lord George is said to have been supported by Lochiel and\r\nhis friends. Charles refused to decide a question with the merits\r\nof which he was imperfectly acquainted; but, as it was necessary to\r\nadjust the difference immediately, he prevailed upon the commanders\r\nof the Macdonald regiments to waive their pretensions in the present\r\ninstance. The Macdonalds in general were far from being satisfied\r\nwith the complaisance of their commanders, and, as they had occupied\r\nthe post of honour at Gladsmuir and Falkirk, they considered their\r\ndeprivation of it on the present occasion as ominous.[1196] The Duke\r\nof Perth, while he stood at the head of the Glengarry regiment,\r\nhearing the murmurs of the Macdonalds, said, that if they behaved\r\nwith their usual valour they would make a right of the left, and that\r\nhe would change his name to Macdonald; but these proud clansmen leant\r\na deaf ear to him.\r\n\r\nThe second line of the Highland army consisted of the Gordons\r\nunder Lord Lewis Gordon, formed in column on the right, the French\r\nRoyal Scots, the Irish piquets or brigade, Lord Kilmarnock’s foot\r\nguards,[1197] Lord John Drummond’s regiment, and Glenbucket’s\r\nregiment in column on the left, flanked on the right by Fitz-James’s\r\ndragoons, and Lord Elcho’s horse-guards, and on the left by the Perth\r\nsquadron, under Lords Strathallan and Pitsligo, and the prince’s\r\nbody-guards under Lord Balmerino. General Stapleton had the command\r\nof this line. The third line, or reserve, consisted of the Duke\r\nof Perth’s and Lord Ogilvy’s regiments, under the last-mentioned\r\nnobleman. The prince himself, surrounded by a troop of Fitz-James’s\r\nhorse, took his station on a very small eminence behind the centre of\r\nthe first line, from which he had a complete view of the whole field\r\nof battle. The extremities of the front line and the centre were each\r\nprotected by four pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nThe English army continued steadily to advance in the order already\r\ndescribed, and, after a march of eight miles, formed in order of\r\nbattle, in consequence of the advanced guard reporting that they\r\nperceived the Highland army at some distance making a motion towards\r\nthem on the left. Finding, however, that the Highlanders were still\r\nat a considerable distance, and that the whole body did not move\r\nforward, the Duke of Cumberland resumed his march as before, and\r\ncontinued to advance till within a mile of the position occupied by\r\nthe Highland army, when he ordered a halt, and, after reconnoitring\r\nthe position of the Highlanders, again formed his army for battle in\r\nthree lines, and in the following order.\r\n\r\nThe first line consisted of six regiments, viz. the Royals, (the\r\n1st,) Cholmondeley’s, (the 34th,) Price’s, (the 14th,) the Scots\r\nFusileers, (the 21st,) Monro’s, (the 37th,) and Barrel’s, (the\r\n4th). The Earl of Albemarle had the command of this line. In the\r\nintermediate spaces between each of these regiments were placed\r\ntwo pieces of cannon, making ten in all. The second line consisted\r\nof five regiments, viz. those of Pulteney, (the 13th,) Bligh, (the\r\n20th,) Sempil, (the 25th,) Ligonier, (the 48th,) and Wolfe’s, (the\r\n8th,) and was under the command of General Huske. Three pieces of\r\ncannon were placed between the exterior regiments of this line\r\nand those next them. The third line or _corps de reserve_, under\r\nBrigadier Mordaunt, consisted of four regiments, viz. Battereau’s,\r\n(the 62d,) Howard’s, (the 3d,) Fleming’s, (the 36th,) and Blakeney’s,\r\n(the 27th,) flanked by Kingston’s dragoons, (the 3d). The order in\r\nwhich the regiments of the different lines are enumerated, is that\r\nin which they stood from right to left. The flanks of the front line\r\nwere protected on the left by Kerr’s dragoons, (the 11th,) consisting\r\nof three squadrons, commanded by Lord Ancrum, and on the right by\r\nCobham’s dragoons, (the 10th,) consisting also of three squadrons,\r\nunder General Bland, with the additional security of a morass,\r\nextending towards the sea; but thinking himself quite safe on the\r\nright, the duke afterwards ordered these last to the left, to aid\r\nin an intended attack upon the right flank of the Highlanders. The\r\nArgyle men, with the exception of 140, who were upon the left of the\r\nreserve, were left in charge of the baggage.\r\n\r\nThe dispositions of both armies are considered to have been well\r\narranged; but both were better calculated for defence than for\r\nattack. The arrangement of the English army is generally considered\r\nto have been superior to that of the Highlanders; as, from the\r\nregiments in the second and third lines being placed directly behind\r\nthe vacant spaces between the regiments in the lines respectively\r\nbefore them, the Duke of Cumberland, in the event of one regiment in\r\nthe front line being broken, could immediately bring up two to supply\r\nits place. But this opinion is questionable, as the Highlanders had a\r\ncolumn on the flanks of the second line, which might have been used\r\neither for extension or echelon movement towards any point to the\r\ncentre, to support either the first or second line.\r\n\r\nIn the dispositions described, and about the distance of a mile\r\nfrom each other, did the two armies stand for some time gazing at\r\none another, each expecting that the other would advance and give\r\nbattle. Whatever may have been the feelings of Prince Charles on this\r\noccasion, those of the Duke of Cumberland appear to have been far\r\nfrom enviable. The thoughts of Preston and Falkirk could not fail\r\nto excite in him the most direful apprehensions for the result of a\r\ncombat affecting the very existence of his father’s crown; and that\r\nhe placed but a doubtful reliance upon his troops, is evident from a\r\nspeech which he now made to his army. He said that they were about\r\nto fight in defence of their king, their religion, their liberties,\r\nand property, and that if they only stood firm he had no doubt he\r\nwould lead them on to certain victory; but as he would much rather,\r\nhe said, be at the head of one thousand brave and resolute men than\r\nof ten thousand if mixed with cowards, if there were any amongst\r\nthem, who, through timidity, were diffident of their courage, or\r\nothers, who, from conscience or inclination, felt a repugnance to\r\nperform their duty, he requested them to retire immediately, and he\r\npromised them his free pardon for doing so, as by remaining they\r\nmight dispirit or disorder the other troops, and bring dishonour and\r\ndisgrace on the army under his command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of Culloden.]\r\n\r\nAs the Highlanders remained in their position, the Duke of Cumberland\r\nagain put his army in marching order, and, after it had advanced,\r\nwith fixed bayonets, within half a mile of the front line of the\r\nHighlanders, it again formed as before. In this last movement the\r\nEnglish army had to pass a piece of hollow ground, which was so soft\r\nand swampy, that the horses which drew the cannon sank; and some of\r\nthe soldiers, after slinging their firelocks and unyoking the horses,\r\nhad to drag the cannon across the bog. As by this last movement the\r\narmy advanced beyond the morass which protected the right flank, the\r\nduke immediately ordered up Kingston’s horse from the reserve, and a\r\nsmall squadron of Cobham’s dragoons, which had been patrolling, to\r\ncover it; and to extend his line, and prevent his being outflanked on\r\nthe right, he also at same time ordered up Pulteney’s regiment, (the\r\n13th,) from the second line to the right of the royals and Fleming’s,\r\n(the 36th,) Howard’s, (the 3d,) and Battereau’s, (the 62d,) to the\r\nright of Bligh’s, (the 20th,) in the second line, leaving Blakeney’s,\r\n(the 27th,) as a reserve.\r\n\r\nDuring an interval of about half an hour which elapsed before the\r\naction commenced, some manœuvring took place in attempts by both\r\narmies to outflank one another. While these manœuvres were making,\r\na heavy shower of sleet came on, which, though discouraging to the\r\nduke’s army, from the recollection of the untoward occurrence at\r\nFalkirk, was not considered very dangerous, as they had now the\r\nwind in their backs. To encourage his men, the Duke of Cumberland\r\nrode along the lines addressing himself hurriedly to every regiment\r\nas he passed. He exhorted his men to rely chiefly upon their\r\nbayonets,[1198] and to allow the Highlanders to mingle with them that\r\nthey might make them “know the men they had to deal with.” After\r\nthe changes mentioned had been executed, his royal highness took\r\nhis station behind the royals, between the first and second line,\r\nand almost in front of the left of Howard’s regiment, waiting for\r\nthe expected attack. Meanwhile, a singular occurrence took place,\r\ncharacteristic of the self-devotion which the Highlanders were ready\r\non all occasions to manifest towards the prince and his cause.\r\nConceiving that by assassinating the Duke of Cumberland he would\r\nconfer an essential service on the prince, a Highlander resolved,\r\nat the certain sacrifice of his own life, to make the attempt. With\r\nthis intention, he entered the English lines as a deserter, and being\r\ngranted quarter, was allowed to go through the ranks. He wandered\r\nabout with apparent indifference, eyeing the different officers as\r\nhe passed along, and it was not long till an opportunity occurred,\r\nas he conceived, for executing his fell purpose. The duke having\r\nordered Lord Bury, one of his aides-de-camp, to reconnoitre, his\r\nlordship crossed the path of the Highlander, who, mistaking him, from\r\nhis dress, for the duke, (the regimentals of both being similar,)\r\ninstantly seized a musket which lay on the ground, and discharged it\r\nat his lordship. He missed his aim, and a soldier, who was standing\r\nby, immediately shot him dead upon the spot.[1199]\r\n\r\nIn expectation of a battle the previous day, Charles had animated his\r\ntroops by an appeal to their feelings, and on the present occasion he\r\nrode from rank to rank encouraging his men, and exhorting them to act\r\nas they had done at Prestonpans and at Falkirk.\r\n\r\nThe advance of Lord Bury, who went forward within a hundred yards of\r\nthe insurgents to reconnoitre, appears to have been considered by the\r\nHighlanders as the proper occasion for beginning the battle. Taking\r\noff their bonnets, the Highlanders set up a loud shout, which being\r\nanswered by the royal troops with a huzza, the Highlanders about\r\none o’clock commenced a cannonade on the right, which was followed\r\nby the cannon on the left; but the fire from the latter, owing to\r\nthe want of cannoneers, was after the first round discontinued. The\r\nfirst volley from the right seemed to create some confusion on the\r\nleft of the royal army, but so badly were the cannon served and\r\npointed, that though the cannonade was continued upwards of half an\r\nhour, only one man in Bligh’s regiment, who had a leg carried off\r\nby a cannon-ball, received any injury. After the Highlanders had\r\ncontinued firing for a short time, Colonel Belford, who directed the\r\ncannon of the duke’s army, opened a fire from the cannon in the front\r\nline, which was at first chiefly aimed at the horse, probably either\r\nbecause they, from their conspicuous situation, were a better mark\r\nthan the infantry, or because it was supposed that Charles was among\r\nthem. Such was the accuracy of the aim taken by the royal artillery,\r\nthat several balls entered the ground among the horses’ legs, and\r\nbespattered the prince with the mud which they raised; and one of\r\nthem struck the horse on which he rode two inches above the knee. The\r\nanimal became so unmanageable, that Charles was obliged to change him\r\nfor another.[1200] One of his servants, who stood behind with a led\r\nhorse in his hand, was killed on the spot. Observing that the wall\r\non the right flank of the Highland army prevented him from attacking\r\nit on that point, the duke ordered Colonel Belford to continue the\r\ncannonade, with the view of provoking the Highlanders and inducing\r\nthem to advance to the attack. These, on the other hand, endeavoured\r\nto draw the royal army forward by sending down several parties by way\r\nof defiance. Some of these approached there several times within a\r\nhundred yards of the right of the royal army, firing their pistols\r\nand brandishing their swords; but with the exception of the small\r\nsquadron of horse on the right, which advanced a little, the line\r\nremained immoveable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lord George Murray, observing that a squadron of the\r\nEnglish dragoons and a party of foot, consisting of two companies\r\nof the Argyleshiremen, and one of Lord Loudon’s Highlanders, had\r\ndetached themselves from the left of the royal army, and were\r\nmarching down towards the river Nairn, and conceiving that it was\r\ntheir intention to flank the Highlanders, or to come upon their rear\r\nwhen engaged in front, he directed Gordon of Avochy to advance with\r\nhis battalion, and prevent the foot from entering the inclosure;\r\nbut before this battalion could reach them, they broke into the\r\ninclosure, and throwing down part of the east wall, and afterwards a\r\npiece of the west wall in the rear of the second line, made a free\r\npassage for the dragoons, who formed in the rear of the prince’s\r\narmy. Upon this, Lord George ordered the guards and Fitz-James’s\r\nhorse to form opposite to the dragoons to keep them in check. Each\r\nparty stood upon the opposite sides of a ravine, the ascent to\r\nwhich was so steep, that neither could venture across in presence\r\nof the other with safety. The foot remained within the inclosure,\r\nand Avochy’s battalion was ordered to watch their motions.[1201]\r\nThis movement took place about the time the Highlanders were moving\r\nforward to the attack.[1202]\r\n\r\nIt was now high time for the Highlanders to come to a close\r\nengagement. Lord George had sent Colonel Kerr to the prince, to know\r\nif he should begin the attack; the prince ordered him to do so,[1203]\r\nbut his lordship, for some reason or other, delayed advancing. It is\r\nprobable he expected that the duke would come forward, and that by\r\nremaining where he was, and retaining the wall and a small farm house\r\non his right, he would not run the risk of being flanked. Perhaps\r\nhe waited for the advance of the left wing, which, being not so far\r\nforward as the right, was directed to begin the attack, and orders\r\nhad been sent to the Duke of Perth to that effect; but the left\r\nremained motionless. Anxious for the attack, Charles sent an order by\r\nan aide-de-camp to Lord George Murray to advance, but his lordship\r\nnever received it, as the bearer was killed by a cannon-ball while\r\non his way to the right. He sent a message about the same time to\r\nLochiel, desiring him to urge upon Lord George the necessity of an\r\nimmediate attack.\r\n\r\nGalled beyond endurance by the fire of the English, which carried\r\ndestruction among the clans, the Highlanders became quite clamorous,\r\nand called aloud to be led forward without further delay. Unable any\r\nlonger to restrain their impatience, Lord George had just resolved\r\nupon an immediate advance, but before he had time to issue the order\r\nalong the line, the Mackintoshes, with a heroism worthy of that brave\r\nclan, rushed forward enveloped in the smoke of the enemy’s cannon.\r\nThe fire of the centre field-pieces, and a discharge of musketry\r\nfrom the Scotch Fusileers, forced them to incline a little to the\r\nright; but all the regiments to their right, led on by Lord George\r\nMurray in person, and the united regiment of the Maclauchlans and\r\nMacleans on their left, coming down close after them, the whole moved\r\nforward together at a pretty quick pace. When within pistol-shot of\r\nthe English line, they received a murderous fire, not only in front\r\nfrom some field-pieces, which for the first time were now loaded\r\nwith grape-shot, but in flank from a side battery supported by the\r\nCampbells, and Lord Loudon’s Highlanders. Whole ranks were literally\r\nswept away by the terrible fire of the English. Yet, notwithstanding\r\nthe dreadful carnage in their ranks, the Highlanders continued to\r\nadvance, and, after giving their fire close to the English line,\r\nwhich, from the density of the smoke, was scarcely perceptible\r\neven within pistol-shot, the right wing, consisting of the Athole\r\nHighlanders and the Camerons, rushed in sword in hand, and broke\r\nthrough Barrel’s and Monroe’s regiments, which stood on the left of\r\nthe first line. These regiments bravely defended themselves with\r\ntheir spontoons and bayonets; but such was the impetuosity of the\r\nonset, that they would have been entirely cut to pieces had they\r\nnot been immediately supported by two regiments from the second\r\nline, on the approach of which they retired behind the regiments\r\non their right, after sustaining a loss in killed and wounded of\r\nupwards of 200 men. After breaking through these two regiments, the\r\nHighlanders, passing by the two field-pieces which had annoyed them\r\nin front, hurried forward to attack the left of the second line.\r\nThey were met by a tremendous fire of grape-shot from the three\r\nfield-pieces on the left of the second line, and by a discharge of\r\nmusketry from Bligh’s and Sempill’s regiments, which carried havoc\r\nthrough their ranks, and made them at first recoil; but, maddened by\r\ndespair, and utterly regardless of their lives, they rushed upon an\r\nenemy whom they felt but could not see, amid the cloud of smoke in\r\nwhich the assailants were buried. The same kind of charge was made\r\nby the Stewarts of Appin, the Frasers, Mackintoshes, and the other\r\ncentre regiments, upon the regiments in their front, driving them\r\nback upon the second line, which they also attempted to break; but\r\nfinding themselves unable, they gave up the contest, not, however,\r\nuntil numbers had been cut down at the mouths of the cannon. While\r\nadvancing towards the second line, Lord George Murray, in attempting\r\nto dismount from his horse, which had become unmanageable, was\r\nthrown; but, recovering himself, he ran to the rear and brought up\r\ntwo or three regiments from the second line to support the first;\r\nbut, although they gave their fire, nothing could be done,--all was\r\nlost. Unable to break the second line, and being greatly cut up by\r\nthe fire of Wolfe’s regiment, and by Cobham’s and Kerr’s dragoons,\r\nwho had formed _en potence_ on their right flank, the right wing also\r\ngave up the contest, and turning about, cut their way back, sword in\r\nhand, through those who had advanced and formed on the ground they\r\nhad passed over in charging to their front.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the unwillingness of the left to advance first\r\nas directed, Lord George Murray had sent the order to attack from\r\nright to left; but, hurried by the impetuosity of the Mackintoshes,\r\nthe right and centre did not wait till the order, which required\r\nsome minutes in the delivery, had been communicated along the line.\r\nThus the right and centre had the start considerably, and quickening\r\ntheir pace as they went along, had closed with the front line of\r\nthe English army before the left had got half way over the ground\r\nthat separated the two armies. The difference between the right and\r\ncentre and the left was rendered still more considerable from the\r\ncircumstance, as noted by an eye-witness,[1204] that the two armies\r\nwere not exactly parallel to one another, the right of the prince’s\r\narmy being nearer the duke’s army than the left. Nothing could be\r\nmore unfortunate for the prince than this isolated attack, as it was\r\nonly by a general shock of the whole of the English line that he had\r\nany chance of a victory.\r\n\r\nThe clan regiments on the left of the line, apprehensive that they\r\nwould be flanked by Pulteney’s regiment and the horse which had been\r\nbrought up from the corps de reserve, did not advance sword in hand.\r\nAfter receiving the fire of the regiments opposite to them, they\r\nanswered it by a general discharge, and drew their swords for the\r\nattack; but observing that the right and centre had given way, they\r\nturned their backs and fled without striking a blow. Stung to the\r\nquick by the misconduct of the Macdonalds, the brave Keppoch, seeing\r\nhimself abandoned by his clan, advanced with his drawn sword in one\r\nhand and his pistol in the other; but he had not proceeded far, when\r\nhe was brought down to the ground by a musket-shot. He was followed\r\nby Donald Roy Macdonald, formerly a lieutenant in his own regiment,\r\nand now a captain in Clanranald’s, who, on Keppoch’s falling,\r\nentreated him not to throw away his life, assuring him that his wound\r\nwas not mortal, and that he might easily join his regiment in the\r\nretreat; but Keppoch refused to listen to the solicitations of his\r\nclansman, and, after recommending him to take care of himself, the\r\nwounded chief received another shot, and fell to rise no more.[1205]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Highlanders, the English army did not follow up\r\nthe advantages it had gained by an immediate pursuit. Kingston’s\r\nhorse at first followed the Macdonalds, some of whom were almost\r\nsurrounded by them, but the horse were kept in check by the French\r\npiquets, who brought them off. The dragoons on the left of the\r\nEnglish line were in like manner kept at bay by Ogilvy’s regiment,\r\nwhich faced about upon them several times. After these ineffectual\r\nattempts, the English cavalry on the right and left met in the\r\ncentre, and the front line having dressed its ranks, orders were\r\nissued for the whole to advance in pursuit of the Highlanders.\r\n\r\nCharles, who, from the small eminence on which he stood, had observed\r\nwith the deepest concern the defeat and flight of the clan regiments,\r\nwas about proceeding forward to rally them, contrary to the earnest\r\nentreaties of Sir Thomas Sheridan and others, who assured him that\r\nhe would not succeed. All their expostulations would, it is said,\r\nhave been in vain, had not General O’Sullivan laid hold of the bridle\r\nof Charles’s horse, and led him off the field. It was, indeed, full\r\ntime to retire, as the whole army was now in full retreat, and was\r\nfollowed by the whole of Cumberland’s forces. To protect the prince\r\nand secure his retreat, most of his horse assembled about his person;\r\nbut there was little danger, as the victors advanced very leisurely,\r\nand confined themselves to cutting down some defenceless stragglers\r\nwho fell in their way. After leaving the field, Charles put himself\r\nat the head of the right wing, which retired in such order that the\r\ncavalry sent to pursue could make no impression upon it.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the field of battle, Charles separated his\r\narmy into two parts. One of these divisions, consisting, with the\r\nexception of the Frasers, of the whole of the Highlanders and the low\r\ncountry regiments, crossed the water of Nairn, and proceeded towards\r\nBadenoch; and the other, comprising the Frasers, Lord John Drummond’s\r\nregiment, and the French piquets, took the road to Inverness. The\r\nfirst division passed within pistol-shot of the body of English\r\ncavalry, which, before the action, had formed in the rear of the\r\nHighland army, without the least interruption. An English officer,\r\nwho had the temerity to advance a few paces to seize a Highlander,\r\nwas instantly cut down by him and killed on the spot. The Highlander,\r\ninstead of running away, deliberately stooped down, and pulling out a\r\nwatch from the pocket of his victim, rejoined his companions.[1206]\r\nFrom the plainness of the ground over which it had to pass, the\r\nsmaller body of the prince’s army was less fortunate, as it suffered\r\nconsiderably from the attacks of the duke’s light horse before\r\nit reached Inverness. Numerous small parties, which had detached\r\nthemselves from the main body, fell under the sabres of the cavalry;\r\nand many of the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood, who,\r\nfrom motives of curiosity, had come out to witness the battle, were\r\nslaughtered without mercy by the ferocious soldiery, who, from the\r\nsimilarity of their dress, were perhaps unable to discriminate them\r\nfrom Charles’s troops. This indiscriminate massacre continued all\r\nthe way from the field of battle to a place called Mill-burn, within\r\na mile of Inverness. Not content with the profusion of bloodshed in\r\nthe heat of action and during the pursuit, the infuriated soldiery,\r\nprovoked by their disgraces at Preston and Falkirk, traversed the\r\nfield of battle, and massacred in cold blood the miserable wretches\r\nwho lay maimed and expiring. Even some officers, whose station in\r\nsociety, apart altogether from the feelings of humanity, to which\r\nthey were utter strangers, should have made them superior to this\r\nvulgar triumph of base and illiberal minds, joined in the work of\r\nassassination. To extenuate the atrocities committed in the battle,\r\nand the subsequent slaughters, a forged regimental order, bearing\r\nto be signed by Lord George Murray, by which the Highlanders were\r\nenjoined to refuse quarters to the royal troops, was afterwards\r\npublished, it is said, under the auspices of the Duke of Cumberland;\r\nbut the deception was easily seen through. As no such order was\r\nalluded to in the official accounts of the battle, and as, at the\r\ninterview which took place between the Earl of Kilmarnock and Lord\r\nBalmerino, on the morning of their execution, both these noblemen\r\nstated their entire ignorance of it, no doubt whatever can exist of\r\nthe forgery. The conduct of Charles and his followers, who never\r\nindulged in any triumph over their vanquished foes, but always\r\ntreated them with humanity and kindness, high as it is, stands still\r\nhigher when contrasted with that of the royal troops and their\r\ncommander.[1207]\r\n\r\nFrom the characteristic bravery of the Highlanders, and their\r\ncontempt of death, it is not improbable that some of those who\r\nperished, as well on the field after the battle as in the flight,\r\ndid not yield their lives without a desperate struggle; but history\r\nhas preserved one case of individual prowess in the person of Golice\r\nMacbane, which deserves to be recorded in every history relating to\r\nthe Highlanders. This man, who is represented to have been of the\r\ngigantic stature of six feet four inches and a quarter, was beset\r\nby a party of dragoons. When assailed, he placed his back against a\r\nwall, and though covered with wounds, he defended himself with his\r\ntarget and claymore against the onset of the dragoons, who crowded\r\nupon him. Some officers, who observed the unequal conflict, were so\r\nstruck with the desperate bravery of Macbane, that they gave orders\r\nto save him; but the dragoons, exasperated by his resistance, and the\r\ndreadful havoc he had made among their companions, thirteen of whom\r\nlay dead at his feet, would not desist till they had succeeded in\r\ncutting him down.[1208]\r\n\r\nAccording to the official accounts published by the government, the\r\nroyal army had only 50 men killed, and 259 wounded, including 18\r\nofficers, of whom 4 were killed. Lord Robert Kerr, second son of the\r\nMarquis of Lothian, and a captain of grenadiers in Barrel’s regiment,\r\nwas the only person of distinction killed; he fell covered with\r\nwounds, at the head of his company, when the Highlanders attacked\r\nBarrel’s regiment. The loss on the side of the Highlanders was never\r\nascertained with any degree of precision. The number of the slain\r\nis stated, in some publications of the period, to have amounted to\r\nupwards of 2,000 men, but these accounts are exaggerated. The loss\r\ncould not, however, be much short of 1,200 men. The Athole brigade\r\nalone lost more than the half of its officers and men, and some\r\nof the centre battalions came off with scarcely a third of their\r\nmen.[1209] The Mackintoshes, who were the first to attack, suffered\r\nmost. With the exception of three only, all the officers of this\r\nbrave regiment, including Macgillivray of Drumnaglass, its colonel,\r\nthe lieutenant-colonel, and major, were killed in the attack. All\r\nthe other centre regiments also lost several officers. Maclauchlan,\r\ncolonel of the united regiment of Maclauchlan and Maclean, was killed\r\nby a cannon ball in the beginning of the action, and Maclean of\r\nDrimmin, who, as lieutenant-colonel, succeeded to the command, met a\r\nsimilar fate from a random shot. He had three sons in the regiment,\r\none of whom fell in the attack, and, when leading off the shattered\r\nremains of his forces, he missed the other two, and, in returning to\r\nlook after them, received the fatal bullet. Charles Fraser, younger\r\nof Inverallachie, the lieutenant-colonel of the Fraser regiment,\r\nand who, in the absence of the Master of Lovat, commanded it on\r\nthis occasion, was also killed. When riding over the field after\r\nthe battle, the Duke of Cumberland observed this brave youth lying\r\nwounded. Raising himself upon his elbow, he looked at the duke, who,\r\noffended at him, thus addressed one of his officers: “Wolfe, shoot me\r\nthat Highland scoundrel who thus dares to look on us with so insolent\r\na stare.” Wolfe, horrified at the inhuman order, replied that his\r\ncommission was at his royal highness’s disposal, but that he would\r\nnever consent to become an executioner. Other officers refusing to\r\ncommit this act of butchery, a private soldier, at the command of\r\nthe duke, shot the hapless youth before his eyes.[1210] The Appin\r\nregiment had 17 officers and gentlemen slain, and 10 wounded; and\r\nthe Athole brigade, which lost fully half its men, had 19 officers\r\nkilled, and 4 wounded. The fate of the heroic Keppoch has been\r\nalready mentioned. Among the wounded, the principal was Lochiel,\r\nwho was shot in both ancles with some grape-shot, at the head of\r\nhis regiment, after discharging his pistol, and while in the act of\r\ndrawing his sword. On falling, his two brothers, between whom he\r\nwas advancing, raised him up, and carried him off the field in their\r\narms. To add to his misfortunes, Charles also lost a considerable\r\nnumber of gentlemen, his most devoted adherents, who had charged on\r\nfoot in the first rank.\r\n\r\nLord Strathallan was the only person of distinction that fell\r\namong the low country regiments. Lord Kilmarnock and Sir John\r\nWedderburn were taken prisoners. The former, in the confusion of the\r\nbattle, mistook, amidst the smoke, a party of English dragoons for\r\nFitz-James’s horse, and was taken. Having lost his hat, he was led\r\nbare-headed to the front line of the English infantry. His son, Lord\r\nBoyd, who held a commission in the English army, unable to restrain\r\nhis feelings, left the ranks, and, going up to his unfortunate\r\nparent, took off his own hat, placed it on his father’s head, and\r\nreturned to his place without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nAt other times, and under different circumstances, a battle like that\r\nof Culloden would have been regarded as an ordinary occurrence, of\r\nwhich, when all matters were duly considered, the victors could have\r\nlittle to boast. The Highland army did not exceed 5,000 fighting men;\r\nand when it is considered that the men had been two days without\r\nsleep, were exhausted by the march of the preceding night, and had\r\nscarcely tasted food for forty-eight hours, the wonder is that they\r\nfought so well as they did, against an army almost double in point of\r\nnumbers, and which laboured under none of the disadvantages to which,\r\nin a more especial manner, the overthrow of the Highlanders is to be\r\nascribed.[1211] Nevertheless, as the spirits of the great majority of\r\nthe nation had been sunk to the lowest state of despondency by the\r\nreverses of the royal arms at Preston and Falkirk, this unlooked-for\r\nevent was hailed as one of the greatest military achievements of\r\nancient or modern times; and the Duke of Cumberland, who had, in\r\nconsequence, an addition of £25,000 per annum made to his income by\r\nparliament, was regarded as the greatest hero of ancient or modern\r\ntimes. In its consequences, as entirely and for ever destructive\r\nof the claims of the unfortunate house of Stuart, the battle was\r\nperhaps one of the most important ever fought. Though vanquished, the\r\nHighlanders retired from the field with honour, and free from that\r\nfoul reproach which has fixed an indelible stain upon the memories of\r\nthe victors.\r\n\r\nAfter the carnage of the day had ceased, the brutal soldiery,\r\nwho, from the fiendish delight which they took in sprinkling one\r\nanother with the blood of the slain, “looked,” as stated by one of\r\nthemselves, “like so many butchers rather than an army of Christian\r\nsoldiers,”[1212] dined upon the field of battle. After his men had\r\nfinished their repast, the Duke of Cumberland marched forward to take\r\npossession of Inverness, and on his way received a letter, which\r\nhad been addressed to General Bland, signed by six of the French\r\nofficers in the insurgent army, offering in behalf of themselves and\r\ntheir men to surrender unconditionally to his royal highness. As he\r\nwas about to enter the town he was met by a drummer, who brought him\r\na message from General Stapleton, offering to surrender and asking\r\nquarter. On receiving this communication, the duke ordered Sir Joseph\r\nYorke, one of his officers, to alight from his horse, who with his\r\npencil wrote a note to General Stapleton, assuring him of fair\r\nquarter and honourable treatment. The town was then taken possession\r\nof by Captain Campbell, of Sempill’s regiment, with his company of\r\ngrenadiers.\r\n\r\nAfter securing his prisoners in the town, the Duke of Cumberland\r\nreleased the soldiers who had been confined in the church of\r\nInverness by the insurgents, and who, if the government accounts be\r\ncorrect, had suffered great hardships. They had indeed, about a week\r\nbefore the battle of Culloden, been almost stripped of their clothes\r\nby an officer of the Highland army, to clothe a new corps he had\r\nraised; but a complaint having been brought to Lord George Murray\r\non the subject, he obtained an order from the prince, in consequence\r\nof which the clothes were restored.[1213] The duke on the present\r\noccasion presented each of these men with a guinea, and gave orders\r\nthat they should be taken care of.\r\n\r\nBesides the military prisoners, several gentlemen supposed to\r\nbe disaffected to the government were apprehended by the duke’s\r\norders, shut up with the common prisoners, and were for some time\r\ndenied the use of bedding. Nor did the softer sex, whose Jacobite\r\npredilections had pointed them out as objects of displeasure, escape\r\nhis resentment. Several ladies, among whom were Ladies Ogilvy,\r\nKinloch, and Gordon, were seized and kept in durance in the common\r\nguard, and were limited along with the other prisoners to the\r\nmiserable pittance of half-a-pound of meal per day, with scarcely as\r\nmuch water as was necessary to prepare it for use. As the wounded\r\nprisoners were utterly neglected, many who would have recovered, if\r\nproperly treated, died of their wounds; and so much were the rites\r\nof Christian sepulture disregarded by the royal officers, that the\r\nbodies of these unfortunate victims were carried naked through\r\nthe streets by beggars, who were employed to inter them in the\r\nchurchyard.[1214]\r\n\r\nKnowing that there were several deserters from the royal army among\r\nthe insurgents, the duke ordered a strict inspection to be made of\r\nthe prisoners in order to find them out. No less than thirty-six were\r\nrecognised, and being brought to a summary trial, were convicted,\r\nand suffered the death of traitors. Among these was one Dunbar, who\r\nhad been a sergeant in Sowle’s regiment. He had taken a suit of\r\nlaced clothes from Major Lockhart at the battle of Falkirk, which\r\nbeing found in his possession, he was dressed in them, and hanged,\r\nand his body exposed for forty-eight hours on the gibbet.[1215] A\r\nyoung gentleman of the name of Forbes, a relative of Lord Forbes,\r\nis also said to have perished on this occasion. He had served as a\r\ncadet in an English regiment, but, being from principle attached to\r\nthe Jacobite interest, had joined the standard of the prince. An\r\nincident occurred after the execution of this unfortunate gentleman,\r\nwhich assumed an alarming appearance, and might have led to serious\r\nconsequences had the war been continued. Before Forbes was cut down\r\nfrom the gibbet, an English officer, with a morbidness of feeling\r\nwhich seems to have seized the officers as well as the common\r\nsoldiers of the army, plunged his sword into the body of Forbes,\r\nexclaiming, at the same time, that “all his countrymen were traitors\r\nand rebels like himself.” This exclamation being heard by a Scottish\r\nofficer who was standing hard by, the offended Scotchman immediately\r\ndrew his sword, and demanded satisfaction for the insult offered\r\nto his country. The Englishman instantly accepted the challenge,\r\nand in a short time the combat became general among the officers\r\nwho happened to be on the spot. The soldiers, seeing their officers\r\nengaged, beat to arms of their own accord, and drew up along the\r\nstreets, the Scotch on one side and the English on the other, and\r\ncommenced a warm combat with fixed bayonets. Information of this\r\naffray having been brought to the Duke of Cumberland, he hastened to\r\nthe scene of action, and by his persuasions put an end to the combat.\r\nHe found the Scotch greatly excited by the affront offered them; but\r\nhe soothed their wounded feelings by complimenting them for their\r\nfidelity, their courage, and exemplary conduct.[1216]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the massacres which were committed immediately\r\nafter the battle, a considerable number of wounded Highlanders\r\nstill survived, some of whom had taken refuge in a few cottages\r\nadjoining the field of battle, while others lay scattered among the\r\nneighbouring inclosures. Many of these men might have recovered\r\nif ordinary attention had been paid to them; but the stern duke,\r\nconsidering that those who had risen in rebellion against his father\r\nwere not entitled to the rights of humanity, entirely neglected\r\nthem.[1217] But, barbarous as such conduct was, it was only the\r\nprelude to enormities of a still more revolting description. At\r\nfirst the victors conceived that they had completed the work of\r\ndeath by killing all the wounded they could discover; but when they\r\nwere informed that some still survived, they resolved to despatch\r\nthem. A Mr. Hossack, who had filled the situation of provost of\r\nInverness, and who had, under the direction of President Forbes,\r\nperformed important services to the government, having gone to pay\r\nhis respects to the Duke of Cumberland, found Generals Hawley and\r\nHuske deliberating on this inhuman design. Observing them intent upon\r\ntheir object, and actually proceeding to make out orders for killing\r\nthe wounded Highlanders, he ventured to remonstrate against such a\r\nbarbarous step. “As his majesty’s troops have been happily successful\r\nagainst the rebels, I hope (observed Hossack) your excellencies will\r\nbe so good as to mingle mercy with judgment.” Hawley, in a rage,\r\ncried out, “D--n the puppy! does he pretend to dictate here? Carry\r\nhim away!” Another officer ordered Hossack to be kicked out, and\r\nthe order was obeyed with such instantaneous precision, that the\r\nex-provost found himself at the bottom of two flights of steps almost\r\nin a twinkling.[1218]\r\n\r\nIn terms of the cruel instructions alluded to, a party was despatched\r\nfrom Inverness the day after the battle to put to death all the\r\nwounded they might find in the inclosure adjoining the field of\r\nCulloden. These orders were fulfilled with a punctuality and\r\ndeliberation that is sickening to read of. Instead of despatching\r\ntheir unfortunate victims on the spot where they found them, the\r\nsoldiers dragged them from the places where they lay weltering in\r\ntheir gore, and, having ranged them on some spots of rising ground,\r\npoured in volleys of musketry upon them. Next day parties were sent\r\nto search all the houses in the neighbourhood of the field of battle,\r\nwith instructions to carry all the wounded Highlanders they could\r\nfind thither and despatch them. Many were in consequence murdered;\r\nand the young laird of Macleod was heard frankly to declare, that\r\non this occasion he himself saw seventy-two persons killed in cold\r\nblood. The feelings of humanity were not, however, altogether\r\nobliterated in the hearts of some of the officers, who spared a few\r\nof the wounded. In one instance the almost incredible cruelty of the\r\nsoldiery was strikingly exemplified. At a short distance from the\r\nfield of battle there stood a small hut, used for sheltering sheep\r\nand goats in cold and stormy weather, into which some of the wounded\r\nhad crawled. On discovering them the soldiers immediately secured the\r\ndoor, to prevent egress, and thereupon set fire to the hut in several\r\nplaces, and all the persons within, to the number of between thirty\r\nand forty, perished in the flames.[1219]\r\n\r\nAnother instance of fiendish cruelty occurred the same day. Almost\r\nimmediately after the battle, nineteen wounded officers of the\r\nHighland army, unable to follow their retiring companions, secreted\r\nthemselves in a small plantation near Culloden house, whence they\r\nwere afterwards carried to the court-yard of that mansion, where they\r\nremained two days in great torture weltering in their blood, and\r\nwithout the least medical aid or attention but such as they received\r\nfrom the president’s steward, who, at the hazard of his own life,\r\nalleviated the sufferings of his unhappy countrymen by several acts\r\nof kindness. These wretched sufferers were now tied with ropes by the\r\nbrutal soldiery, thrown into carts, and carried out to a park wall\r\nat a short distance from Culloden house. Being dragged out of the\r\ncarts, they were ranged in order along the wall, and were told by\r\nthe officer in command of the party to prepare for death. Such of\r\nthem as retained the use of their limbs fell down upon their knees in\r\nprayer; but they had little time allowed them to invoke mercy, for\r\nin a minute the soldiers received orders to fire, and, being posted\r\nat the distance of only two or three yards from the prisoners, the\r\nunfortunate gentlemen were almost all instantly shot dead. That the\r\nbutchery might be complete, the soldiers were ordered to club their\r\nmuskets and dash out the brains of such of their miserable victims\r\nas exhibited any symptoms of life, an order which, horrible to tell,\r\nwas actually fulfilled. A gentleman named John Fraser, who had been\r\nan officer in the Master of Lovat’s regiment, alone survived. He\r\nhad received a ball, and being observed to be still in life, was\r\nstruck on the face by a soldier with the butt end of his musket.\r\nThough one of his cheek bones and the upper part of his nose were\r\nbroken, and one of his eyes dashed out by the blow, he still lived,\r\nand the party, thinking they had killed him, left him for dead. He\r\nwould probably have expired on the spot, had not the attention of\r\nLord Boyd, son of the Earl of Kilmarnock, when riding past, been\r\nfortunately attracted by the number of dead bodies he observed\r\nlying together. Espying, at a little distance from the heap, a body\r\nin motion, his lordship went up, and having ascertained from the\r\nmouth of the sufferer who he was, he ordered his servant to carry\r\nMr. Fraser to a cottage, near at hand, which he named, where he lay\r\nconcealed for three months. He lived several years afterwards, but\r\nwas a cripple during life.[1220]\r\n\r\nBy the capture of Inverness, a considerable quantity of ordnance and\r\nmilitary stores fell into the hands of the royal army. Including\r\nthose taken on the field of battle, there were 30 pieces of cannon,\r\n2,320 firelocks, 190 broadswords, a large quantity of musket\r\ncartridges, 1,019 cannon balls, a quantity of musket shot, 37 barrels\r\nof gunpowder, and 22 ammunition carts, besides tents, cantines,\r\npistols, saddles, &c. To encourage the soldiers to collect the arms\r\nwhich the Highlanders had left on the field, they were allowed\r\nhalf-a-crown for every musket, and a shilling for every broadsword\r\nwhich they brought into the camp at Inverness. For every stand of\r\ncolours the sum of sixteen guineas was allowed, and no less than\r\nfourteen of these were captured or picked up upon the field, all of\r\nwhich were burnt on the 4th of June at the market cross of Edinburgh,\r\nby the hands of the common hangman, after being carried in mock\r\nprocession from the castle by a party of chimney-sweeps.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the battle the Earl of Cromarty, his son, Lord\r\nMacleod, several officers, and 153 private men, were landed at\r\nInverness from the Hound sloop of war, which had conveyed them from\r\nSutherland, where they had been taken prisoners by a party of Lord\r\nSutherland’s people on the preceding day, viz., the 15th of April,\r\nunder the following circumstances. Having received instructions to\r\nrejoin the main body of the Highland army at Inverness, the earl\r\nwas about proceeding to fulfil them, when a plan was formed by the\r\nMackays and the Earl of Sutherland’s people to cut him off. Uniting\r\ntheir forces, consisting of three independent companies, near\r\nGolspie, they resolved to attack the Earl of Cromarty, early in the\r\nmorning of the 15th of April, in flank and in rear. In pursuance\r\nof this resolution, Captain Macallister, who commanded the Earl of\r\nSutherland’s militia, marched with his company towards the water\r\nof Golspie, and having in his march received intelligence that\r\nCromarty’s regiment had marched towards the ferry, but that the earl\r\nhimself with the greater part of his officers was at Dunrobin castle,\r\nhe sent Ensign John Mackay, with a party of 26 men, to intercept him.\r\nThe earl left the castle with 14 officers on horseback, and a small\r\nparty of well-armed foot, to join his men, and would have fallen\r\ninto an ambuscade which Ensign Mackay had laid for him, had not some\r\nof the Mackays begun to fire too soon. Lord Cromarty immediately\r\nretraced his steps and took refuge in the castle, from the top of\r\nthe tower of which he displayed a white flag and rang a bell, as a\r\nsignal that he was attacked. The earl’s men began immediately to\r\nmarch back to his relief, upon which Mackay and his party retired to\r\nthe adjacent high grounds. Meanwhile, the two independent companies,\r\nwhich were to attack Cromarty’s men in flank, arrived at the hill of\r\nCulmaly, to the north west of Golspie, and observing the insurgents\r\nreturning from the ferry, and drawing up in order of battle on\r\na rising ground about a mile west from Golspie, they concealed\r\nthemselves on the top of the hill: Captains Gray and Sutherland,\r\nthe commanders of the two companies, then descended the hill to\r\nreconnoitre. They computed Cromarty’s force to be between 400 and 500\r\nmen; and, having resolved to attack them, they returned to their men\r\nand gave orders to that effect. To deceive the insurgents as to the\r\nextent of their numbers, they marched down the hill in open column,\r\nkeeping a distance of about twenty paces between each rank; and so\r\nwell did this _ruse_ succeed, that the insurgents, struck with a\r\npanic, fled towards the ferry, and were pursued by the two companies,\r\nwho, attacking them in flank, killed a considerable number, and\r\ntook 178 prisoners. The two companies thereupon marched to Dunrobin\r\ncastle, which they invested. The earl held out the castle till the\r\nevening, when, despairing of relief, he requested the commanders\r\nof the companies to hold a conference with him in the castle on\r\nthe subject of a surrender. While engaged in conversation, Ensign\r\nMackay, who had entered the castle along with the two captains, went\r\ndown stairs, and having informed the earl’s men below that he had\r\nsurrendered, induced them to deliver up their arms. Having secured\r\ntheir arms, he took the keys from the porter, and, opening the gates,\r\nadmitted his party. He then went up stairs with them, and, entering\r\nthe dining-room, seized the earl, Lord Macleod, and the whole\r\nofficers.[1221]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Duke of Cumberland was deliberating upon the course he\r\nshould adopt for finally suppressing the rebellion, his unfortunate\r\nkinsman, disheartened by his recent disaster, was entirely occupied\r\nwith thoughts of his own personal safety. After leaving the field,\r\nCharles, escorted by a large body of horse, crossed the river Nairn\r\nat the ford of Falie, about four miles from the field of battle.\r\nHaving halted a short time on the south side of the Nairn, during\r\nwhich he held a consultation with his friends, Charles dismissed the\r\nhorse and most of his attendants, with instructions to assemble at\r\nRuthven in Badenoch, where they were directed to wait for further\r\norders. Taking along with him Sir Thomas Sheridan, O’Sullivan,\r\nCaptain O’Neil, John Hay, and a few other persons, Charles set out\r\nfor Gortuleg, the residence of Lord Lovat’s steward, where he arrived\r\nabout sunset. There, for the first and only time, the prince met\r\nLord Lovat, who, on learning the cause of the Prince’s unexpected\r\nvisit, became, it is said, almost frantic, and, anticipating the fate\r\nwhich awaited him, called out to those around him to chop off his\r\nhead. In a little time the aged chief regained his self-possession,\r\nand entered into conversation with Charles and his followers in\r\nrelation to their future prospects. As it was not considered safe\r\nto pass the night so near the royal troops, Charles and his party,\r\nafter partaking of some supper, left Gortuleg about ten o’clock\r\nfor Invergarry, the seat of Macdonell of Glengarry. Before leaving\r\nGortuleg, the prince took the precaution to change his dress.\r\n\r\nThe prince and his party arrived at the mansion of Invergarry about\r\nfour o’clock in the morning, where Charles began to experience a\r\nforetaste of the hardships he was destined to endure. This ancient\r\ncastle, ever since its first erection, had never been in such a\r\ncheerless condition as that in which Charles now found it. Unprovided\r\nwith furniture or provisions, and inhabited by a solitary domestic,\r\nit seemed to warn the unfortunate fugitives that they were unwelcome\r\nwithin its walls, and that they must speedily look out for a more\r\nhospitable place of retreat. Overcome by fatigue, the whole party\r\nlay down upon the floor, in their clothes, and fell asleep. After\r\nreposing several hours, they rose, but had nothing to eat till Edward\r\nBurke, servant to Alexander Macleod, one of the party, observing a\r\nnet in the water of Garry, pulled it out and caught two salmon, on\r\nwhich they dined.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of O’Sullivan, O’Neil, and Edward Burke, who, from\r\nhis knowledge of the country, was selected as the prince’s guide,\r\nall the party took leave of Charles at Invergarry. Before leaving\r\nthe castle, Charles, in order the more effectually to disguise\r\nhimself, put on Burke’s coat; and at three o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nhe set out for Loch Arkaig in Lochaber, accompanied by his three\r\nattendants, and took up his quarters for the night in the house\r\nof Donald Cameron of Glenpean. Charles slept the following night,\r\nthat of Friday the 18th, at Mewboll, where he and his small party\r\nwere well entertained. From Mewboll they set out next morning for\r\nGlenboisdale. At Loch Morar they waited several hours for a boat to\r\ncarry them across; but, not finding one, they were obliged, from the\r\nroad being impracticable for horses, to abandon them and to walk on\r\nfoot to Glenboisdale, which they reached on Sunday the 20th, after\r\ngreat fatigue, having crossed two lofty ranges of mountains in their\r\nroute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord George Murray.--From the original painting by\r\npermission of His Grace the Duke of Athole.]\r\n\r\nPresuming that Charles still meant to make a stand, Lord George\r\nMurray and the other chiefs who remained with the army retired to\r\nRuthven, where, including Cluny’s men whom they met on their retreat,\r\nthey assembled a force of between 2,000 and 3,000 men. From the\r\nwant of provisions it was impossible to keep such a body together\r\nfor any length of time; and a message from Charles, two or three\r\ndays after the battle, desiring them to disperse, hastened an event\r\nwhich seemed to be inevitable. In thus resigning the contest which\r\nby his inconsiderate rashness he had provoked, Charles showed that\r\nhe was not possessed of that magnanimity which many of his followers\r\nascribed to him. Notwithstanding their recent reverse, there existed\r\nno unwillingness on the part of the brave men who had risked their\r\nall for him to continue the war. They might not have, it is true,\r\nsucceeded in vindicating the claim of an ungrateful prince in the\r\nfield; but, under his leadership, they might have made a gallant\r\nstand, and forced the government to grant them favourable terms.\r\nIn extenuation of the prince’s conduct, on the present occasion,\r\nit is but fair to add, that he was under the influence of a set of\r\ncontemptible advisers, who prejudiced him against his best friends,\r\nand instilled into his mind a conviction that he had been betrayed\r\nat Culloden. How far the conduct of Lord George Murray, after that\r\nevent, may have determined Charles to take the course he did, cannot\r\nnow be ascertained; but if Charles, in the midst of his perplexity\r\nimmediately after the battle, hesitated as to the course he should\r\npursue, his reception of the following document, under the hand of\r\nLord George Murray, was certainly not calculated to induce him to\r\ncontinue the contest.\r\n\r\n  “MAY IT PLEASE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.\r\n\r\n  “As no person in these kingdoms ventured more frankly in the\r\n  cause than myself, and as I had more at stake than almost all\r\n  the others put together, so, to be sure, I cannot but be very\r\n  deeply affected with our late loss and present situation; but I\r\n  declare, that were your royal highness’s person in safety, the\r\n  loss of the cause, and the misfortunate and unhappy situation of\r\n  my countrymen, is the only thing that grieves me, for I thank\r\n  God I have resolution to bear my own family’s ruin without a\r\n  grudge. Sir, you will, I hope, upon this occasion, pardon me, if\r\n  I mention a few truths, which all the gentlemen of our army seem\r\n  convinced of.\r\n\r\n  “It was highly wrong to have set up the royal standard without\r\n  having positive assurances from his Most Christian Majesty, that\r\n  he would assist you with all his force; and as your royal family\r\n  lost the crown of these realms upon the account of France, the\r\n  world did and had reason to expect that France would seize the\r\n  first favourable opportunity to restore your august family.\r\n\r\n  “I must also acquaint your royal highness, that we were all fully\r\n  convinced that Mr. O’Sullivan, whom your royal highness trusted\r\n  with the most essential things with regard to your operations,\r\n  was exceedingly unfit for it, and committed gross blunders on\r\n  every occasion of moment. He whose business it was, did not so\r\n  much as visit the ground where we were to be drawn up in line\r\n  of battle, and it was a fatal error to allow the enemy these\r\n  walls upon their left, which made it impossible for us to break\r\n  them, and they, with their front fire, and flanking us when we\r\n  went upon the attack, destroyed us without any possibility of\r\n  our breaking them, and our Athole men have lost a full half of\r\n  their officers and men. I wish Mr. O’Sullivan had never got any\r\n  other charge in the army than the care of the baggage, which, I\r\n  am told, he had been brought up to and understood. I never saw\r\n  him in time of action, neither at Gladsmuir, Falkirk, nor in the\r\n  last, and his orders were vastly confused.\r\n\r\n  “The want of provisions was another misfortune which had the most\r\n  fatal consequence. Mr. Hay, whom your royal highness trusted\r\n  with the principal direction of ordering provisions of late, and\r\n  without whose orders a boll of meal or farthing of money was not\r\n  to be delivered, has served your royal highness egregiously ill.\r\n  When I spoke to him, he told me the thing is ordered, it will be\r\n  got, &c.; but he neglected his duty to such a degree, that our\r\n  ruin might probably have been prevented had he done his duty.\r\n  In short, the three last days which were so critical, our army\r\n  was starved. This was the reason our night march was rendered\r\n  abortive, when we possibly might have surprised and defeated the\r\n  enemy at Nairn; but for want of provisions a third of the army\r\n  scattered to Inverness, &c., and the other who marched had not\r\n  spirits to make it so quick as was necessary, being really faint\r\n  for want of provisions.\r\n\r\n  “The next day, which was the fatal day, if we had got plenty of\r\n  provisions we might have crossed the water of Nairn, and drawn\r\n  up so advantageously, that we would have obliged the enemy to\r\n  come to us, for they were resolved to fight at all hazards at\r\n  prodigious disadvantage, and probably we would in that case have\r\n  done by them as they unhappily have done by us. In short, Mr.\r\n  O’Sullivan and Mr. Hay had rendered themselves odious to all our\r\n  army, and had disgusted them to such a degree, that they had bred\r\n  a mutiny in all ranks, that had not the battle come on, they were\r\n  to have represented their grievances to your royal highness for\r\n  a remedy. For my own part, I never had any particular discussion\r\n  with either of them; but I ever thought them uncapable and unfit\r\n  to serve in the stations they were placed in.\r\n\r\n  “Your royal highness knows I always told I had no design to\r\n  continue in the army. I would of late, when I came last from\r\n  Athole, have resigned my commission; but all my friends told me\r\n  it might be of prejudice to the cause at such a critical time. I\r\n  hope your royal highness will now accept of my demission. What\r\n  commands you have for me in any other situation, please honour\r\n  me with them.--I am, with great zeal, Sir, your royal highness’s\r\n  most dutiful and humble servant,\r\n\r\n  “GEORGE MURRAY.\r\n\r\n  “RUTHVEN, _17th April, 1746_.\r\n\r\n  “I have taken the liberty to keep 500 pieces, which shant be\r\n  disposed upon except you give leave.”[1222]\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the preceding document that Lord George Murray,\r\nwho, of all men, was the best judge of the propriety of trying\r\nanother campaign, did not in the least contemplate that Charles would\r\nabandon the enterprise. His own opinion was, that the war should be\r\ncontinued; and when he heard that Charles had resolved to depart\r\nfor France, he sent Secretary Hay to Glenboisdale with a message to\r\nCharles, to dissuade him against such a step; but Charles informed\r\nHay that his resolution was fixed. Lord George maintained that the\r\nHighlanders “could have made a summer’s campaign without the risk of\r\nany misfortune: they could have marched through the hills to places\r\nin Banffshire, Aberdeenshire, the Mearns, Perthshire, Lochaber, and\r\nArgyleshire, by ways that regular troops could not have followed;\r\nand if they (the regular troops) had ventured among the mountains,\r\nit must have been attended with great danger and difficulty: their\r\nconvoys might have been cut off, and opportunities would have offered\r\nto attack them with almost a certainty of success. And though the\r\nHighlanders had neither money nor magazines, they would not have\r\nstarved in that season of the year so long as there were sheep and\r\ncattle: they could also have separated themselves in two or three\r\ndifferent bodies, got meal for some days’ provision,--met again at a\r\nplace appointed, and might have fallen upon the enemy when they least\r\nexpected: they could have marched in three days what would have taken\r\nregular troops five: nay, had those taken the high roads as often\r\nas they would have been obliged upon account of their carriages,\r\nit would have taken them ten or twelve days. In short, they might\r\nhave been so harassed and fatigued that they must have been in the\r\ngreatest distress and difficulties, and at length probably been\r\ndestroyed, at least much might have been expected by gaining of time:\r\nperhaps the Highlanders might have been enabled to have made an\r\noffensive instead of a defensive war.”[1223]\r\n\r\nAfter receiving Charles’s orders to disperse, the officers at\r\nRuthven, to use an expression of one of themselves,[1224] “took a\r\nmelancholy leave of each other,” and went off in different directions\r\nto secure their personal safety, and the common men proceeded\r\nstraight to their respective homes.\r\n\r\nWhile Secretary Hay was at Boisdale, Charles drew up a letter to\r\nthe chiefs, stating the reasons of his departure, which he inclosed\r\nin one to Sir Thomas Sheridan,[1225] with instructions to show it\r\nto them, but to keep it as long back as he conveniently could. He\r\nstated that it was “of the last consequence” to conceal his departure\r\non some pretext or other, which he enjoined him to contrive, and to\r\nrecommend, particularly to every person to whom he showed the paper,\r\nto follow the same course. In using this precaution Charles probably\r\nwished to keep the government in ignorance of his design to leave the\r\nkingdom. The letter to the chiefs, which, though written on or before\r\nthe 23d of April, the date of the letter to Sir Thomas Sheridan, is\r\npost-dated the 28th, with the view, perhaps, of allowing Sir Thomas\r\nto withhold it for a few days, by which time Charles expected that he\r\nwould be on his way to the Long island, where he expected to find a\r\nvessel to carry him to France. The letter to the chiefs runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  “FOR THE CHIEFS,\r\n\r\n  “When I came into this country, it was my only view to do all in\r\n  my power for your good and safety. This I will always do as long\r\n  as life is in me. But alas! I see with grief I can at present do\r\n  little for you on this side the water, for the only thing that\r\n  can now be done is to defend yourselves till the French assist\r\n  you, if not to be able to make better terms. To effectuate this,\r\n  the only way is to assemble in a body as soon as possible, and\r\n  then to take measures for the best, which you that know the\r\n  country are only judges of. This makes me be of little use here;\r\n  whereas, by my going into France instantly, however dangerous it\r\n  be, I will certainly engage the French court either to assist\r\n  us effectually and powerfully, or at least to procure you such\r\n  terms as you would not obtain otherways. My presence there, I\r\n  flatter myself, will have more effect to bring this sooner to a\r\n  determination than any body else, for several reasons; one of\r\n  which I will mention here; viz. it is thought to be a politick,\r\n  (policy,) though a false one, of the French court, not to restore\r\n  our master, but to keep a continual civil war in this country,\r\n  which renders the English government less powerful, and of\r\n  consequence themselves more. This is absolutely destroyed by my\r\n  leaving the country, which nothing else but this will persuade\r\n  them that this play cannot last, and if not remedied, the Elector\r\n  will soon be as despotick as the French king, which, I should\r\n  think, will oblige them to strike the great stroke, which is\r\n  always in their power, however averse they may have been to it\r\n  for the time past. Before leaving off, I must recommend to you,\r\n  that all things should be decided by a council of all your\r\n  chiefs, or, in any of your absence, the next commander of your\r\n  several corps with the assistance of the Duke of Perth and Lord\r\n  George Murray, who, I am persuaded, will stick by you to the very\r\n  last. My departure should be kept as long private and concealed\r\n  as possible on one pretext or other which you will fall upon. May\r\n  the Almighty bless and direct you.”[1226]\r\n\r\nAt Glenboisdale Charles was joined by Clanranald, Lockhart, younger\r\nof Carnwath, Æneas Macdonald, the banker, and several other\r\nadherents, who endeavoured to dissuade him from embarking for the\r\nisles, where, from the number of cruisers which hovered among the\r\nHebrides, they considered he would run greater risk than if he\r\nremained on the mainland. Charles seemed disposed to adopt this\r\nadvice; but O’Sullivan being averse to it, and having represented\r\nthe great probability of speedily finding a ship among the isles to\r\nconvey him to France, and the great danger of staying where he was,\r\nthe prince adhered to his determination of seeking a temporary refuge\r\nin the Long island. With the intention of soliciting the protection\r\nof Sir Alexander Macdonald and the laird of Macleod, Charles sent to\r\nKinlochmoidart for one Donald Macleod, a trustworthy person whom he\r\nwished to intrust with his despatches. Macleod had been at Inverness\r\nshipping a cargo of meal for Skye when Charles entered that town,\r\nand had been employed to accompany Æneas Macdonald to the island of\r\nBarra, for the purpose of bringing over a sum of about £380, which\r\nwas lying there. They had reached Kinlochmoidart, on their way back,\r\nand were about setting out for Inverness, when Macdonald received a\r\nletter from the prince announcing his defeat, and requesting him to\r\nrepair to Borodale. On receiving this message Macleod immediately set\r\nout, and in passing through a forest in the vicinity of Glenboisdale,\r\nhe observed a solitary wanderer among the trees, who immediately\r\ncame forward and asked him if he was Donald Macleod of Gualtergill\r\nin Skye. Macleod answered that he was, and having recognised the\r\nprince in the person of his interrogator, he stated that he was\r\nat his service. “Then,” said the prince, “you see, Donald, I am in\r\ndistress. I therefore throw myself into your bosom; do with me what\r\nyou like. I hear you are an honest man, and fit to be trusted.” The\r\naged Highlander doubting his capacity to serve him, Charles stated\r\nto him the nature of the mission on which he intended to send him.\r\nMacleod, startled at the proposal, positively refused to undertake\r\nthe task; and having remonstrated with Charles upon the impropriety\r\nof asking the protection of men who had, contrary to their promise,\r\ntaken part against him, he abandoned his design.[1227]\r\n\r\nDuring the few days that Charles spent at Glenboisdale, he is said\r\nto have wavered in his plans. Though informed of the dispersion of\r\nhis troops, he had hopes that a good many might still be collected\r\nas occasion offered. He is said even to have entertained thoughts of\r\nagain assembling his scattered forces, and acting on the defensive.\r\nHe sent a few men, with whom Clanranald had supplied him, on all\r\nsides to obtain intelligence, but they learned nothing favourable;\r\nand accounts which he received from the Isle of Skye, that Lord\r\nLoudon was about to come over immediately to the coast of Arisaig,\r\njoined to a report, which, however, turned out to be false, that a\r\ndetachment of the Duke of Cumberland’s army had already reached Fort\r\nAugustus, hastened his departure from the mainland.[1228]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the evening of the 26th of April, Charles,\r\naccompanied by O’Sullivan, O’Neil, Allan Macdonald, a catholic priest\r\nof Clanranald’s family, and Edward Burke, embarked in an eight-oared\r\nboat at Borodale, in the bay of Lochnanuagh, where a few months\r\nbefore he had landed full of hope and enthusiasm. Besides the persons\r\nenumerated, and Donald Macleod who acted as pilot, there were seven\r\nboatmen. Charles sat down in the bottom of the boat at the feet of\r\nthe pilot. Macleod, who observed indications of an approaching storm,\r\nhad advised Charles to postpone his voyage till next day; but the\r\nprince was so intent upon proceeding, that he would not put off his\r\ndeparture. Four pecks of oatmeal were all the provision the whole\r\nparty carried along with them, and the only cooking utensil was a pot\r\nwhich Macleod had taken care to provide.\r\n\r\nCharles soon had occasion to repent of his obstinacy in not listening\r\nto the advice of the aged mariner; for before the boat had proceeded\r\nfar, a storm arose, which is described by Macleod as the most violent\r\nhe had ever witnessed, though he had been all his life a seafaring\r\nman. The danger was greatly increased by the darkness of the night,\r\nand to add to the distress of the party, the rain poured down in\r\ntorrents. Vivid flashes of lightning which threw a momentary gleam\r\nover the face of the troubled deep, and the crash of the thunder\r\nwhich rolled over the heads of the affrighted party, increased the\r\nhorrors of the scene. Unprovided with a compass, they were entirely\r\nignorant of the course they were steering; but they had, from the\r\nviolence of the tempest, no alternative but to go before the wind,\r\nand in the event of escaping the fury of the waves, running the risk\r\nof being driven upon Skye, where the prince might fall into the hands\r\nof the militia who were in that island. But all their apprehensions\r\nof danger on this score were removed, by discovering at day-break\r\nthat they were on the coast of the Long island. At seven o’clock in\r\nthe morning they landed with great difficulty at Rossinish, a point\r\nof land on the north-east of Benbecula, one of the islands which\r\nform the group called the Long island. Having secured their boat,\r\nCharles and his party entered an uninhabited hut, in which they\r\nkindled a fire to warm themselves and dry their clothes, which were\r\nsaturated with rain and salt-water. Charles purchased a cow, which\r\nwas immediately slaughtered; and which, with the small quantity of\r\nmeal provided by Donald Macleod, served to support the party during\r\nthe time they remained on the island.[1229]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Duke of Cumberland was using every effort to capture\r\nthe persons of the young Chevalier and his principal adherents. For\r\nthis purpose, several detachments were sent out by the duke from his\r\ncamp at Inverness in different directions, and as he was desirous\r\nthat Charles should not fall alive into his hands, his instructions\r\nto the commanders of the detachments were to make no prisoners.\r\nOne of these detachments, under Colonel Cockayne, proceeded to Moy\r\ncastle, and after shooting some fugitives who had taken refuge in\r\nthat mansion, and massacring some old men, women and children,\r\nreturned to Inverness, carrying along with them Lady Mackintosh, who,\r\non her arrival there, was committed to custody by the duke. Another\r\nparty went to castle Downie, the seat of Lord Lovat, which they burnt\r\nto the ground, having previously secured a large quantity of booty,\r\nwhich they carried to Inverness. A body of 600 Grants was sent into\r\nthe Frasers’ country to reduce and disarm that powerful clan; and the\r\nMonroes, Mackays, and Sutherlands, were scattered over the shires of\r\nRoss, Cromarty, Sutherland, and Caithness, to keep the disaffected\r\nin these counties in check. To secure the passages to the isles,\r\nLord Fortrose, son of the Earl of Seaforth, proceeded to raise the\r\nMackenzies, and orders were given along the coast to prevent any\r\nsuspicious persons from making their escape by sea. Cobham’s and Lord\r\nMack Ker’s dragoons were posted along the east coast, and bodies of\r\nmilitia were stationed at the passes leading into the Highlands to\r\nintercept all persons who might attempt to escape to the lowlands.\r\nThe pass of Stirling was also guarded by a detachment posted at the\r\nFords of the Frew, and the Edinburgh regiment was spread along the\r\nsouth side of the Frith of Forth, to apprehend such of the insurgents\r\nas might attempt to cross that arm of the sea. Besides these\r\ndifferent detachments, a body of 1,700 militia, under the Earl of\r\nLoudon, the laird of Macleod, and Sir Alexander Macdonald, the last\r\nof whom had raised his men before the battle of Culloden, and another\r\nbody of 800 Argyleshire men under General Campbell, afterwards Duke\r\nof Argyle, spread themselves over Lochaber, all eager to secure the\r\nperson of the prince. In short, no means were neglected to attain\r\nthis object; and the eager pursuers required no other stimulus to\r\nurge them on than the splendid reward of £30,000, which had been\r\noffered for the capture of the royal fugitive.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Charles from Lochnanuagh was not known at Inverness\r\ntill some days after he had sailed, and the place of his destination\r\nbecome a matter of interesting speculation. No doubt could exist\r\nthat he designed to seek refuge among the western islands, and as\r\nSt. Kilda is the most distant and the least frequented of the whole,\r\nit was supposed that Charles had repaired thither. Acting on this\r\nsupposition, General Campbell collected some sloops of war and\r\ntransports, and having embarked a considerable body of troops, set\r\nsail for St. Kilda.[1230] After touching at Barra and some other\r\nislands, and searching for the prince, he approached St. Kilda, the\r\ninhabitants of which, alarmed at the sight of the fleet, fled and\r\nconcealed themselves in the cliffs of the rocks. Landing with some\r\nof his forces, the general inquired at some of the inhabitants, whom\r\nhe discovered in their recesses, what had become of the “Pretender;”\r\nbut these people answered, with great simplicity, that they had never\r\nheard of such a person,--that they had indeed been informed that\r\ntheir laird (Macleod) had lately been at war with a woman a great\r\nway abroad, and that he had overcome her. This, they added, was all\r\nthey knew of the affairs of the world. General Campbell, however, not\r\nsatisfied with this statement, made a search over the island, but not\r\nfinding any strangers, returned to the main land after visiting South\r\nUist.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the utter ruin which awaited them and their followers,\r\nif no attempt was made to resist the meditated designs of the Duke\r\nof Cumberland, several chiefs and others[1231] held a meeting at\r\nMortlaig on the 8th of May, at which they entered into a bond for\r\ntheir mutual defence, and agreed never to lay down their arms, or\r\nmake a general peace, without the consent of the whole. They may be\r\nsupposed to have come to this resolution the more readily, as a sum\r\nof 35,000 louis d’ors had been received a few days before by two\r\nFrench frigates which had arrived on the west coast. By the bond of\r\nassociation, the chiefs agreed, and solemnly promised, with the\r\nutmost expedition, to raise in behalf of the prince and in defence\r\nof their country, as many able-bodied armed men as they could on\r\ntheir respective properties, and they further promised and agreed,\r\nthat the following clans, viz., Lochiel, Glengarry, Clanranald,\r\nStewarts of Appin, Keppoch, Barisdale, Mackinnons and Macleods,\r\nshould assemble on Thursday, the 15th of May, at Auchnacarry, in\r\nthe braes of Lochaber. To facilitate the junction of the different\r\ncorps with all possible speed, it was agreed that the Frasers of Aird\r\nand the other Jacobite clans on the north side of the river Ness,\r\nshould join the people of Glenmoriston and Glengarry, and that the\r\nFrasers of Stratherrick, the Mackintoshes and Macphersons, should\r\nassemble and meet at the most convenient place in Badenoch on the\r\nsame day;--that the Macgregors, and Menzies’ and Glenlyon’s people\r\nshould march to Rannoch and join the Rannoch and Athole men, and be\r\nkept in readiness to receive intelligence and orders to meet the\r\nmain body in the braes of Mar, or at any other place that might be\r\nconsidered convenient,--that Gordon of Glenbucket and Colonel Roy\r\nStewart should intimate the resolutions of the meeting to Lord Lewis\r\nGordon, Lords Ogilvy and Pitsligo, the Farquharsons, and the other\r\nprincipal gentlemen in the north, who were to be directed to fix a\r\nplace of rendezvous among themselves, and that Macpherson of Cluny\r\nand Colonel Roy Stewart should advertise the principal gentlemen\r\nof the Mackintoshes of the resolutions adopted by the meeting. The\r\nbetter to conceal their designs from the Duke of Cumberland, the\r\nassembled chiefs agreed not to discover or reveal to any of their men\r\nor inferior officers, the agreement they had entered into, nor the\r\nday and place of rendezvous, till they had assembled their respective\r\ncorps. It was finally agreed, that should any one engaged in the\r\nassociation make separate terms for himself, he should be looked upon\r\nas a traitor to the prince, and be treated by his associates as an\r\nenemy.[1232]\r\n\r\nThe associated chiefs had been too sanguine in their expectations,\r\nnot one of them being able, for various reasons, to meet on the day\r\nappointed. Clanranald’s people refused to leave their own country,\r\nand many of Glengarry’s had delivered up their arms. Lochgarry came\r\nwith a small party to Invermely on the 20th of May; but, after\r\nstaying one night, he crossed Loch Arkaig and did not return. Lochiel\r\nand Barisdale met at Auchnacarry, the place of rendezvous, on the\r\n21st or 22d of May, but with very few men, and they were almost\r\nsurprised by a large party of the government forces on the morning\r\nof the 23d, who took an officer and two of Lochiel’s men prisoners.\r\nThe Highlanders immediately dispersed, and Lochiel, seeing no chance\r\nof making an effectual stand under existing circumstances, wrote\r\na circular to his brother chiefs, advising them to disperse their\r\npeople; but, as great expectations were entertained that the French\r\nking would send assistance, he requested them to preserve their arms\r\nas long as possible.\r\n\r\nConceiving that the only effectual mode of suppressing the rebellion\r\nwas to march into the Highlands with the whole of his army, the Duke\r\nof Cumberland began, about the middle of May, to make preparations\r\nfor his journey. He had in the beginning of that month issued a\r\nproclamation, ordering the insurgent clans to deliver up their arms;\r\nbut little attention was paid to this mandate, and the continuance\r\nof considerable armed parties convinced him that the Highlands\r\ncould never be reduced without the presence of a considerable army\r\nstationed in a central district. Having pitched upon Fort Augustus\r\nfor his new head-quarters, the duke left Inverness, on the 23d of\r\nMay, with eleven battalions of foot and Kingston’s horse, and reached\r\nFort Augustus next day. Charles had intended to make this place a\r\nrallying point in case of a defeat; but his plan was rejected by the\r\nchiefs, and, that it might not be serviceable to the royal troops,\r\nthe buildings had been blown up. No accommodation being therefore\r\nfound for the duke’s army, a camp was formed in the neighbourhood,\r\nand a turf hut with doors and windows, and covered with green sods\r\nand boughs, was erected by Lord Loudon’s Highlanders for the use of\r\nhis royal highness.[1233]\r\n\r\nResolving to inflict a signal chastisement upon the rebels, the duke\r\nsent, from his camp at Fort Augustus, detachments of his troops in\r\nall directions, which devastated the country with fire and sword, and\r\ncommitted excesses scarcely paralleled in history, resembling, though\r\nperhaps on a minor scale, those committed by the hosts of Hyder Ali,\r\nwhen that merciless destroyer burst into the Carnatic. The seats of\r\nLochiel, Glengarry, Kinlochmoidart, Keppoch, Cluny, Glengyle, and\r\nothers, were plundered and burnt to the ground, and great numbers of\r\nthe houses of the common people shared the same fate.[1234] Major\r\nLockhart, whose name, by his cruelties on this occasion, has obtained\r\nan infamous notoriety, marched with a detachment into the country\r\nof the Macdonalds of Barisdale, and laid waste and destroyed their\r\ndwellings. Some of these poor people had obtained protections from\r\nLord Loudon; but the major disregarded them, and told the people who\r\nhad them, that not even a warrant from heaven should prevent him from\r\nexecuting his orders. Another corps, under Lord George Sackville,\r\nravaged the country about the glens of Moidart, while others carried\r\nfire and desolation through other districts. Not contented with\r\ndestroying the country, these bloodhounds either shot the men upon\r\nthe mountains, or murdered them in cold blood. The women, after\r\nwitnessing their husbands, fathers, and brothers murdered before\r\ntheir eyes, were subjected to brutal violence, and then turned out\r\nnaked, with their children, to starve on the barren heaths. A whole\r\nfamily was inclosed in a barn, and consumed to ashes. So alert were\r\nthese ministers of vengeance, that in a few days, according to the\r\ntestimony of a volunteer who served in the expedition, neither house,\r\ncottage, man, nor beast, was to be seen within the compass of fifty\r\nmiles: all was ruin, silence, and desolation. Deprived of their\r\ncattle and their small stock of provisions by the rapacious soldiery,\r\nthe hoary-headed matron and sire, the widowed mother and her helpless\r\noffspring, were to be seen dying of hunger, stretched upon the bare\r\nground, and within view of the smoking ruins of their dwellings.\r\n\r\nIt may seem surprising that the Highlanders did not avenge themselves\r\nupon their oppressors, by assassinating such stragglers as fell\r\nin their way. It cannot be supposed that men in whose bosoms the\r\nspirit of revenge must have taken deep root, would have spared their\r\nrelentless adversaries from any scruple as to the mode of despatching\r\nthem; nor can it be imagined that the Highlanders could not have\r\nselected fit occasions when they might have inflicted vengeance upon\r\nindividuals. The reason of their forbearance probably was, that such\r\na system of warfare, if adopted, would lead to acts of retaliation on\r\nthe part of the military, and thus increase their calamities. Only\r\none instance is known where an injured person attempted to avenge\r\nhimself. This was the case of a Highlander who had his house burned,\r\nhis cattle plundered, and his son killed, while defending his family,\r\nwho were turned out in the snow. Vowing revenge, he watched the\r\nofficer who was the author of this inhuman outrage, and who, he was\r\ninformed, was to be distinguished by a cloak of a particular kind.\r\nThis officer riding one day with Captain George Munro of Culcairn in\r\na shower of rain, lent him his cloak; and while marching in it with\r\na party of men along the side of Loch Arkaig, the captain was shot\r\nby the enraged Highlander, who perceived the cloak, but could not\r\ndistinguish the difference of person. The man escaped, and although\r\nhe was well known, and might have been afterwards apprehended, he was\r\nallowed to pass unpunished.[1235]\r\n\r\nOf the immense quantity of cattle carried off by Cumberland’s troops,\r\nsome idea may be formed from the fact mentioned in a journal of\r\nthe period,[1236] that there were sometimes 2,000 in one drove.\r\nIntelligence of such a vast accumulation of live stock reaching\r\nthe ears of the graziers of the south, numbers of them went to Fort\r\nAugustus well provided with money, which they laid out to great\r\nadvantage. Some of the people, impelled by starvation, repaired\r\nto the camp to solicit from the spoilers some of their flocks, to\r\npreserve an existence; but their supplications were unheeded, and\r\nthey were doomed to behold their cattle sold and driven away, while\r\nfamine stared them in the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duncan Forbes of Culloden, Lord President.\r\n\r\nFrom Original Painting at Culloden House.]\r\n\r\nThe atrocities committed by the English must have been revolting to\r\nthe humane mind of Lord President Forbes. On paying his respects to\r\nthe duke at Inverness, he hinted to his highness that the laws of\r\nthe country should be observed even by his army; but the duke, who\r\nentertained very different ideas, not relishing such an intrusion\r\nupon his authority, cut the worthy president short with this\r\nexclamation, “The laws of the country, my Lord! I’ll make a brigade\r\ngive laws, by God!” Judging farther remonstrance to be vain, Forbes\r\ndropped the subject, and was compelled to deplore in silence the\r\ncruelties which he could not prevent. He might have represented the\r\nmatter to the government; but he was perhaps unwilling to run the\r\nrisk of incurring its displeasure, and thereby deprive himself of\r\nthe chance of being afterwards useful in saving many families from\r\nruin.[1237]\r\n\r\nThe enormities of the lawless soldiery were not confined to the\r\nHighlands, but extended to all the adjoining lowland districts where\r\nthe spirit of disaffection was known to exist. The houses of the low\r\ncountry Jacobite gentry were plundered and destroyed, and the chapels\r\nof the nonjurant episcopal clergy, as well as the more humble and\r\nsecluded places of worship belonging to the Catholics, were either\r\nrazed or burnt to the ground. “Rebel-hunting” was the term adopted by\r\nthe ruffians of the British army to designate their bloody occupation.\r\n\r\nTo complete the work of extermination, the duke issued a\r\nproclamation, denouncing the punishment of death, by hanging, against\r\nevery person who should harbour the insurgents, and a similar fate\r\nwas declared to await such as should conceal arms, ammunition, or any\r\nother thing belonging to them, or should not immediately deliver up\r\nto persons authorized by the duke to receive the same, any property\r\nor effects in their possession belonging to the rebels. In compliance\r\nwith a requisition made by the duke, the General Assembly of the\r\nChurch of Scotland, about the end of May, enjoined the ministers of\r\nthe different parishes to read a proclamation from the pulpits, in\r\nwhich they themselves, and every well affected person, were ordered\r\nby his royal highness to use every exertion to discover and seize\r\nthe unfortunate fugitives; and to facilitate their discovery and\r\napprehension, the clergy were required to furnish lists of the names\r\nof all persons in their respective parishes who had had any share in\r\nthe insurrection. Many clergymen, including those of Edinburgh, with\r\nfeelings of humanity and independence which did them honour, refused\r\nto read this proclamation, or to comply with the order requiring\r\nthem to give in the names of such of their parishioners as had been\r\nengaged in the rebellion. The government, equally intent with its\r\nsanguinary general upon the destruction of the unfortunate adherents\r\nof the house of Stuart, offered rewards for apprehending such of the\r\nfugitives as might land in Ireland, and instructions were sent to the\r\nBritish ministers at foreign courts in alliance with George II., to\r\nseize all who might seek refuge in the territories of such powers.\r\n\r\nThe guilt of all these acts of bloodshed and rapine has been laid to\r\nthe charge of the Duke of Cumberland, and the single fact that he\r\nissued no orders to put an end to the enormities which were daily\r\ncommitted, almost under his own eyes, and with his perfect knowledge,\r\nseems of itself sufficient to justify the charge. But when taken in\r\nconnexion with his sanguinary order not to make prisoners, the proofs\r\nof his criminality, or rather unconstitutional severity, are evident.\r\nThough the foul stain of wanton cruelty must ever attach to the\r\nBritish army on the present occasion, from the commander down to the\r\nprivate, there were some redeeming exceptions among the officers, who\r\nalleviated the sufferings, and, in some instances, saved the lives of\r\nthe devoted Highlanders. “I think myself,” says Mr. Maxwell, “bound\r\nin justice to let the reader know that there were in the duke of\r\nCumberland’s army officers of all ranks, whom neither the prospect of\r\ningratiating themselves and making their fortunes, nor the contagion\r\nof bad example were able to corrupt. Some of those that had done the\r\ngovernment the most essential services were as conspicuous now for\r\ntheir humanity as formerly for their courage and conduct. It might be\r\nindiscreet to be particular at present; but their names, which are\r\nwritten with indelible characters in the hearts of those poor people\r\nthat owe to them the preservation of their being, will be carefully\r\nhanded down to posterity. They are already known, and even, in the\r\nworst of times, meet with the applause they deserve from all those\r\nthat have a fellow-feeling for their species.”\r\n\r\nWith the honourable exceptions here alluded to, neither the duke nor\r\nthe submissive slaves of his tyrannical will ever appear to have\r\nfelt the least compunction for the miseries they inflicted upon the\r\nunfortunate Highlanders. On the contrary, they seem to have revelled\r\namidst the ruin and desolation which they spread around; and when\r\ntheir occupation of “rebel-hunting” was gone, by the destruction of\r\ntheir victims, they endeavoured to relieve the _ennui_ of repose\r\nby ludicrous and indecent diversions. Horse and foot races were\r\ninstituted by the royal duke, who did not think it beneath his\r\ndignity to induce the women of the camp to enter the lists, and to\r\nexpose themselves in a way at which decency revolts.[1238] This\r\nspecies of amusement produced great insubordination in the army, for\r\nthe soldiers got very fond of it, and, according to a volunteer, most\r\nof them had horses, which they bought and sold with one another at\r\na low price, and on which they rode about, neglecting their duty,\r\nand consequently it became necessary to publish an order to part\r\nwith them, otherwise they were all to be shot. “I saw,” continues\r\nthe same writer, “a soldier riding on one of these horses, when,\r\nbeing met by a comrade, he asked him, ‘Tom, what hast thou given\r\nfor the Galloway?’ Tom answered, ‘Half-a-crown.’ To which the other\r\nreplied, with an oath, ‘He is too dear; I saw a better bought for\r\neighteen-pence.’ Notwithstanding the low price, the vast quantities\r\nof cattle, such as oxen, horses, sheep, and goats, taken from the\r\nrebels, and bought up by the lump by the jockies and farmers from\r\nYorkshire and the south of Scotland, came to a great deal of money,\r\nall which was divided amongst the men that brought them in, who were\r\nsent out in parties in search of the Pretender; and they frequently\r\ncame to rebels’ houses, which they had left, as their owners would\r\nnot be reduced to obedience. These our soldiers commonly plundered\r\nand burnt, so that many of them grew rich by their share of spoil.”\r\n\r\nWhen the zeal and activity of the military in pursuing the leading\r\nfugitives on the one hand, and the great care of the government to\r\nprevent their escape to the continent on the other, are considered,\r\nit is surprising that so many succeeded in their attempts to leave\r\nthe kingdom. Besides the Earls of Cromarty and Kilmarnock, and Lord\r\nMacleod, the only other Jacobite chiefs who fell into the hands of\r\nthe government were the Marquis of Tullibardine, Lords Balmerino\r\nand Lovat, and Secretary Murray. The Marquis being unable, from\r\nthe bad state of his health, to bear the fatigue of running from\r\ncovert to covert, surrendered himself, on the 27th of April, to\r\na Dumbartonshire gentleman, who committed him to the castle of\r\nDumbarton; and Lord Balmerino, by the advice of Mr. Grant, younger of\r\nRothiemurchus, most unwisely delivered himself up at Inverness, two\r\ndays after the battle of Culloden. After having the mortification of\r\nwitnessing, from the summit of a mountain, the conflagration of his\r\nseat of Castle Downie by the king’s troops, Lord Lovat took refuge in\r\nthe western parts of Inverness-shire, and finally concealed himself\r\nin the hollow of a tree which grew on a small island in Loch Morar,\r\nwhere he was apprehended early in June by a party from the Furnace\r\nsloop of war. When discovered, he was wrapt up in a blanket; and,\r\nthough he had between five and six hundred guineas in his pocket,\r\nhad been obliged to live twelve days in his miserable retreat on\r\noatmeal and water. Being unable, from his great age and infirmity, to\r\nride, he was carried in a litter to the royal camp at Fort Augustus.\r\nSecretary Murray contrived to escape from the Highlands, and sought\r\nfor safety in the house of his brother-in-law, Mr. Hunter of\r\nPolmood, in Peebles-shire; but information having been given of his\r\nretreat, he was apprehended on the morning of Saturday, the 28th of\r\nJune, by a party of St. George’s dragoons, carried to Edinburgh, and\r\ncommitted the same evening a prisoner to the castle.\r\n\r\nMacdonald of Barisdale and his son were also taken prisoners, but\r\nwere almost immediately set at liberty. That a man who had taken\r\nsuch an active part in the insurrection as Barisdale did should\r\nhave been liberated unconditionally is very improbable; and it was\r\ngenerally understood that he had entered into an engagement to\r\napprehend the prince, and deliver him up to the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nSo strong were the suspicions of Charles and his friends of\r\nBarisdale’s treachery, that when Colonel Warren arrived in the West\r\nHighlands for the purpose of transporting Charles to France, he\r\nactually seized Barisdale and his son, and carried them along with\r\nhim to that country as prisoners. A list of charges, in the shape\r\nof interrogatories, was afterwards drawn up by Charles at Paris, to\r\neach of which Barisdale was required to make a direct and particular\r\nanswer in writing; but the nature of his answers, if he made any, is\r\nnot known. There may have been no foundation for these grave charges;\r\nbut well or ill founded, an opinion long prevailed in the Highlands\r\nthat Barisdale had been unfaithful.\r\n\r\nIf Glengarry’s apprehension proceeded upon the information of the\r\ngentlemen of his own clan, they must have had better grounds for\r\ntaking the extraordinary step they are alleged to have done than\r\nthe mere assertion of Barisdale; but the charge against Glengarry\r\nseems highly improbable, as it is scarcely credible, if, as stated,\r\nthey had letters from him in their possession, advising them to take\r\nup arms in support of Charles, while he himself kept back, that he\r\nwould, by such a perfidious act, have put himself in their power.\r\nGlengarry, after his apprehension, was sent to London, and, along\r\nwith the other chief prisoners, was committed to the Tower, where he\r\nsuffered a long and tedious confinement. Young Glengarry had been\r\ntaken up some months previously and sent to the Tower, in which he\r\nwas kept a close prisoner for twenty months.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sanguinary ferocity with which Cumberland’s\r\nsoldiers hunted down the unfortunate fugitives, the lives of a\r\nconsiderable number of those who were taken or surrendered themselves\r\nwere saved from immediate destruction by the interference of a few\r\nhumane persons, who did everything in their power to put a stop to\r\nthe exterminating system of these bloodhounds. Though they thus\r\nescaped the merciless sword of the destroyer, they were nevertheless\r\ndoomed to suffer the most extraordinary privations. After having\r\nbeen cooped up in the loathsome prisons of the north, without any\r\nattention to their wants, many of them were afterwards huddled\r\ntogether in the holds of ships, where they were condemned unheeded to\r\npine away, and, amidst a mass of filth and corruption, to inhale the\r\nseeds of pestilence and death. Of 157 persons who were immured for\r\neight months in the hold of one transport, only 49 survived the cruel\r\ntreatment they received.[1239]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile several of the chiefs of the insurrection succeeded in\r\neffecting their escape to the Continent. The Duke of Perth, Lord\r\nJohn Drummond, Lords Elcho and Nairne, Maxwell of Kirkconnel, and\r\nothers, embarked at Lochnanuagh, on board one of the French ships\r\nwhich arrived on the western coast about the end of April. The Duke\r\nof Perth, who had been long in bad health, died on the voyage.\r\nAnother party of twelve or thirteen persons, including Lords Pitsligo\r\nand Ogilvy, and Hunter of Burnside, after skulking some time in\r\nBuchan, got a vessel which conveyed them to Bergen in Norway. The\r\nBritish consul applied to the governor to have them secured, but\r\nhe disregarded the application, and the party proceeded to Sweden.\r\nStewart of Ardshiel, and General O’Sullivan also succeeded in\r\nreaching France. Old Glenbucket, after being hunted from place to\r\nplace, eluded his pursuers by assuming the garb of a beggar, and\r\nallowing his beard to grow. In the month of November he escaped\r\nto Norway in a Swedish vessel. Lord George Murray remained in\r\nconcealment in Scotland till the month of December, when, after\r\npaying a private visit to his friends at Edinburgh, he took shipping\r\nat Anstruther in the Frith of Forth, and reached Holland in safety.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1166] The publication of the _Forbes Papers_ has brought to light\r\nthe meanness and rapacity of the Duke of Cumberland and General\r\nHawley. The duke lived, all the time he was at Aberdeen, in the\r\nhouse of Mr. Alexander Thomson, advocate, and, although he made use\r\nof every kind of provisions he found in the house, and of the coals\r\nand candles, he did not pay Mr. Thomson a single farthing, nor did\r\nhe even thank him. He left, however, six guineas for the servants, a\r\nboy and two women, one of whom had washed and dressed his linen. Mrs.\r\nGordon of Hallhead was induced to yield possession of her house in\r\nthe town to General Hawley, under a promise that the greatest care\r\nwould be taken of every thing in the house. Having represented that\r\nshe was unable to furnish linen and other necessaries for Hawley and\r\nhis suite, Mrs. G. was informed, that as the general would bring\r\nevery thing with him, she might lock up all she had, and that all\r\nthat was wanted was the use of two of her maid-servants to do the\r\nwork of the house. Mrs. G. accordingly secured her effects under\r\nlock and key; but Hawley had not been above a day in the house when\r\nhe sent a messenger to Mrs. G. demanding delivery of all her keys,\r\nand threatening, in case of delay, to break open all the locks.\r\nHaving received the keys, the general sent Major Wolfe, one of his\r\naides-de-camp, to Mrs. G. in the evening, who intimated to her that\r\nshe was deprived of every thing except the clothes on her back.\r\nThe poor lady then desired to have her tea, but the major told her\r\nthat it was very good, and that tea was scarce in the army. She\r\nnext asked for her chocolate, and the same answer was returned. She\r\nexpressed a wish to get other things, particularly her china, but\r\nthe gallant major told her that she had a great deal of it, that it\r\nwas very pretty, and that the general and his friends were very fond\r\nof china themselves; but perhaps she might get back some of it. Mrs.\r\nG. petitioned the Duke of Cumberland to order her property to be\r\nrestored to her. The duke, it is said, promised to grant the prayer\r\nof the petition, but no prohibitory order was issued, and General\r\nHawley proceeded to pack up every thing in the least portable, and\r\nshipped the best things off to Edinburgh a fortnight before he left\r\nAberdeen. Mrs. Gordon gives a very minute catalogue of the effects\r\ncarried off, which she values at £600. Among those abstracted were\r\nthe whole of her husband’s body-clothes, three wigs, “with several\r\nshirts and night-gowns of Bob’s,” (Mr. Gordon’s son). He carried off\r\nall the china and other crockery ware, and did not leave a single\r\nteacup or plate,--all the wine glasses and decanters,--the linens\r\nand table napery, and even the kitchen towels. He stript the beds\r\nof every thing, and left the bare posts standing. In short, he\r\ncleared the house of almost every thing,--of empty bottles, larding\r\npens, iron skewers, flutes, music books, two canes with china\r\nheads, wash-balls, &c. &c. Mrs. Gordon insinuates that the Duke of\r\nCumberland participated in the spoil. In a letter written by Thomas\r\nBowdler, Esq. of Ashley, near Bath, brother of Mrs. Gordon, to the\r\nRev. Robert Lyon, who lived in Lady Cotton’s family in London, he\r\nobserves, that a Mrs. Jackson, who knew Mrs. Gordon’s china well,\r\nrecognised part of it one day in the window of a china shop in\r\nLondon, and having the curiosity to inquire of the shopkeeper from\r\nwhom he had bought it, was informed that he had purchased it from a\r\nwoman of the town, who told him that the Duke of Cumberland had given\r\nit to her.\r\n\r\n[1167] Ray, p. 313.\r\n\r\n[1168] Home, App. No. 41.\r\n\r\n[1169] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p 120.\r\n\r\n[1170] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1171] _Kirkconnel MS._ _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 507.\r\n\r\n[1172] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 518.\r\n\r\n[1173] _A Particular Account of the Battle of Culloden._ In a letter\r\nfrom an officer (Lord George Murray) of the Highland army to his\r\nfriend in London.

My answer to this is, (waiving what Mr. O’Sullivan said\r\nfrom the Prince,[1183]) that all the officers were unanimous;--that\r\nas it could not be done by surprise, and before day-break, as had\r\nbeen proposed and undertaken with no other view, it was impossible\r\nto have success; for it was never imagined by any one that it was\r\nto be attempted but by a surprise. Whatever may be the rules in a\r\nregular army, (and it is not to be supposed I was ignorant of them,)\r\nour practice had all along been, at critical junctures, that the\r\ncommanding officers did every thing to their knowledge for the best.\r\nAt Gladsmuir (the plan of which attack I had formed,) I was the\r\nlast that passed the defile of the first line, and the first that\r\nattacked; and gained in going on a good part of the ground we had\r\nleft betwixt us and the main ditch, by the front having, on account\r\nof the darkness, marched a little too far. When I came up with the\r\nenemy’s cannon, I did not stay to take them, but went on against\r\nboth foot and dragoons, being very quickly followed by our right. I\r\nreceived no orders (nor did I wait for any, otherwise the opportunity\r\nwould have been lost,) from the time I passed the defile till the\r\nbattle was over. At Clifton, where I expected to have been supported\r\nby all our army, John Roy Stuart brought me orders from the Prince\r\nto retreat, for he had ordered the march for Carlisle, which was\r\nbegun. The officers who were with me agreed in my opinion, that to\r\nretreat when the enemy were within less than musket-shot would be\r\nvery dangerous, and we would probably be destroyed before we came up\r\nwith the rest of our army. We had nothing for it but a brisk attack;\r\nand therefore, after receiving the enemy’s fire, we went sword in\r\nhand and dislodged them; after which we made our retreat in good\r\norder. I own I disobeyed orders; but what I did was the only safe and\r\nhonourable measure I could take, and it succeeded. At the battle of\r\nFalkirk I never received an order or message from his Royal Highness\r\nafter I passed the water at Dunipace till the battle was over. I\r\ncould say much more on this subject; all I shall now add is, that\r\nat the time we returned from Kilravock there was no officer of any\r\ndistinction with the prince, (except Sir Thomas Sheridan be reckoned\r\none,) they being all in the van. Brigadier Stapleton was indeed in\r\nthe rear, but he knew nothing of the ground there, and his people\r\nwere only to have been a corps de reserve, and not in the attack.”\r\n\r\n[1183] “Mr. O’Sullivan said, (he had just come up to the front,)\r\nhe had just then come from the Prince, who was very desirous the\r\nattack should be made: but as Lord George Murray led the van, and\r\ncould judge of the time, he left it to him whether to do it or\r\nnot.”--_Particular Account_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[1184] _Particular Account_, &c. p. 12.\r\n\r\n[1185] Mr. John Hay’s account of the Retreat, No. 43 of Appendix to\r\nHome’s _Rebellion_. This statement has been hitherto supposed to rest\r\nupon the single authority of Hay; and Mr. Home has been blamed for\r\nmaking it, as it was not confirmed by others. The same statement,\r\nhowever, is also made by Mr. Maxwell of Kirkconnel, a much more\r\nrespectable authority than Hay. Mr. Home had the Kirkconnel MS. in\r\nhis possession when writing his history, but seldom refers to it.\r\nMr. Maxwell’s words are: “The prince was incensed beyond expression\r\nat a retreat, begun in direct contradiction to his inclination\r\nand express orders. In the first moments he was convinced he was\r\nbetrayed, and expressed himself to that purpose. He was confirmed\r\nin this opinion by those who never missed an opportunity of loading\r\nLord George Murray, but when he knew that this step had been taken\r\nin concert with Lochiel and others, whom he had never distrusted,\r\nhe did not know what to think or what to do: thus perplexed he\r\narrived with the army at Culloden.” See also narrative by the Rev.\r\nGeorge Innes in _Jacobite Memoirs_, who says, (p. 289,) that some\r\npersons positively said, that when the prince met the Duke of Perth’s\r\nregiment returning, he cried out, “I am betrayed; what need I give\r\norders, when my orders are disobeyed.”\r\n\r\n[1186] Answer by the Prince to Mr. Home’s query, Home’s _Rebellion_,\r\nNo. 44 of the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[1187] _Kirkconnel MS._ _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 519.\r\n_Particular Account_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[1188] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1189] _Particular Account_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[1190] Home, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[1191] Boyse, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[1192] Boyse, p. 156.

He knew that on this all depended, and that the two previous\r\ndisasters had been caused by the men not being rightly disciplined to\r\nreceive the novel mode of attack. Some writers on military tactics\r\nhad, in the meantime, proposed alterations on the complex infantry\r\nmovements of the day, for the purpose of evading the Highlander’s\r\ntarget, by directing the bayonet against his right breast. The men\r\nwere trained during the winter, in some measure, to such a change of\r\nmotion, but it appears to have rather been for the purpose of giving\r\nthem a confidence that might make them steady, than from any belief\r\nin the absolute efficacy of the change.”--Burton’s _Scotland from\r\nRevolution_, vol. ii. p. 519.\r\n\r\n[1199] Boyse, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[1200] Boswell’s _Tour to the Hebrides_, p. 228.\r\n\r\n[1201] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1202] Mr. Home says that about a hundred men were stationed in\r\nthe inclosure, who were put to the sword by the dragoons when they\r\nentered; but he is certainly mistaken. Mr. Maxwell of Kirkconnel,\r\nfrom whom Mr. Home took his description of the battle, does not\r\nmention such an occurrence. In the memoir by a Highland officer,\r\n(Colonel Ker,) printed among the _Lockhart Papers_, it is stated,\r\n(p. 520,) that to guard against any attempts that might be made to\r\nbreak down the walls of the inclosure, there were two battalions\r\nplaced facing outward, covering the right of the two lines, to\r\nobserve the motions of the English; and that “when the attack began,\r\nthe Campbells threw down a great part of the wall of the inclosure\r\nfor the dragoons on the duke’s left, to pass to the rear of the\r\nprince’s army, which they did without receiving one shot from the two\r\nbattalions that were placed to observe their motions.”--P. 521.\r\n\r\n[1203] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 521.\r\n\r\n[1204] Maxwell of Kirkconnel.\r\n\r\n[1205] In retiring from the field, Captain Roy Macdonald received a\r\nmusket bullet, which passed in at the sole of the left foot and came\r\nout at the buckle.

He was followed by some of his attendants, who\r\nobserved him in deep meditation. He laid his hand upon his breast,\r\nand with his eyes lifted up to heaven, was heard to say, _Lord, what\r\nam I! that I should be spared?_ when so many brave men lie dead\r\nupon the spot!--an expression of such deep humility towards God,\r\nand compassion towards his fellow creatures, as is truly worthy a\r\nChristian hero!!!”--_Marchant_, p. 396.\r\n\r\n[1208] Cromek’s _Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song_, p.\r\n200.--Henderson’s _History_, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[1209] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 124.\r\n\r\n[1210] Chambers’s _Rebellion_, and authorities referred to there.\r\n\r\n[1211] The ground was totally unsuited to Highland tactics. “It is\r\nimpossible to look on this waste, with the few green patches still\r\nmarking the graves where the slain were covered up in heaps, without\r\na feeling of compassion for the helplessness of a Highland army in\r\nsuch a place. It is a wide flat muir, with scarcely a curve, where\r\nthe mountaineers had nothing to aid their peculiar warfare, in high\r\nor rugged ground. A better field for steady disciplined troops could\r\nnot exist. They could see everywhere around, and it was impossible\r\neither to surprise them, or subject them, as at Killiecrankie or\r\nFalkirk, to a rush from the higher ground.”--Burton after Revolution,\r\nvol. ii. p. 518.\r\n\r\n[1212] _Scots Mag._ vol. viii. p. 192.\r\n\r\n[1213] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[1214] Idem, p. 236.\r\n\r\n[1215] Boyse, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[1216] Johnstone’s _Memoirs_, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[1217] “It is not necessary to believe all the Jacobite stories\r\ntending to show a wanton and fiendish indulgence, by the duke and\r\nhis most distinguished followers, in cruelty and any kind of bloody\r\nwork for its own sake; nor to admit that he ridiculed President\r\nForbes as the old woman who spoke about humanity and the laws. What\r\nhe did was, we may be assured from his character, not done in a\r\nspirit of wantonness, but after a sense of duty. But that duty led\r\nhim to severity. He was a soldier according to the German notions\r\nof a soldier, and a rebel province was a community to be subjected\r\nto martial law. Many of the insurgents, attempting to escape or\r\nhide themselves when detected by well-known peculiarities, were put\r\nto death by the soldiery, who, even when they made a mistake and\r\nslew the wrong man, could not easily be punished. The duke, brought\r\nup in the German military school, seems to have been unable to\r\ndistinguish between a rebellion suppressed in constitutional Britain,\r\nwhere all men are supposed to be innocent but those proved to be\r\nguilty,--and a revolted German province, where every accorded grace\r\nto the unfortunate people proceeds from the will of the conqueror.\r\nThus there was a propensity to subject all the northern districts to\r\nsomething too closely resembling military law or license.”--Burton’s\r\n_Scotland after Revolution_, v. ii. pp. 522, 523.\r\n\r\n[1218] Letter from a gentleman in London to his friend in Bath.

A turn of the road concealed him from the\r\nsoldiers at the moment, but when he came in sight with his gun,\r\nthey immediately seized him upon suspicion, and carried him to Fort\r\nWilliam. After a short confinement he was released. Colonel Grant\r\nentered the 42d as a volunteer or soldier of fortune, and afterwards\r\ngot a cadetship in India, from which he returned with a handsome\r\nfortune nearly fifty years ago.”--_Stewart’s Sketches_, vol. i. note\r\np. 280.\r\n\r\n[1236] _Scots Magazine_, vol. viii. p. 287.\r\n\r\n[1237] How far any remonstrance on the part of the president\r\nwould have been attended to may be judged from the following\r\nstatement:--“When he visited London in the end of the year, (1746,)\r\nfor the purpose of settling the accounts he had run with the loyal\r\nHighland militia, he, as usual, went to court. The king, whose ear\r\nhad been offended with repeated accounts of the conduct of the\r\nmilitary, thus addressed him:--‘My lord-president, you are the person\r\nI most wished to see. Shocking reports have been circulated of the\r\nbarbarities committed by my army in the north; your lordship is,\r\nof all men, the best able to satisfy me.’ ‘I wish to God,’ replied\r\nthe president, ‘that I could, consistently with truth, assure your\r\nmajesty that such reports are destitute of foundation.’ The king,\r\nas was his custom, turned abruptly away from the president; whose\r\naccounts, next day, were passed with difficulty; and, as report says,\r\nthe balance, which was immense, never fully paid up.”--_Antijacobin\r\nReview_, vol. xiii. _Review of Home’s History of the Rebellion_.\r\n\r\n[1238] A letter from Fort Augustus, dated June 27, 1746, which made\r\nthe round of the public journals at the time, thus describes these\r\npastimes:--“Last Wednesday the duke gave two prizes to the soldiers\r\nto run heats for on bare-backed Galloways taken from the rebels, when\r\neight started for the first, and ten for the second prize. These\r\nGalloways are little larger than a good tup, and there was excellent\r\nsport. Yesterday his royal highness gave a fine Holland smock to the\r\nsoldiers’ wives, to be run for on these Galloways, also bare-backed,\r\nand riding with their limbs on each side of the horse like men.\r\nEight started, and there were three of the finest heats ever seen.\r\nThe prize was won, with great difficulty, by one of the Old Buff’s\r\nladies. In the evening, General Hawley and Colonel Howard run a match\r\nfor twenty guineas on two of the above shelties: which General Hawley\r\nwon by about four inches.”\r\n\r\n[1239] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 300. William Jack, one of the\r\nprisoners, in a letter to his friends in Elgin (_Memoirs_, p.\r\n299), says that the sailors used to amuse themselves by hoisting\r\nthe prisoners up to the yard-arm and dropping them into the sea,\r\nand that they would tie them to the mast and flog them; that for\r\nseveral months they had no bed-clothes, and that they used to dig\r\nholes among the ship’s ballast, consisting of black earth and small\r\nstones, to keep themselves warm. John Farquharson of Aldlerg, himself\r\na prisoner, in a letter to the Rev. Mr. Forbes, published among the\r\nForbes papers, gives an appalling description of the miseries of his\r\nfellow prisoners on their voyage from Inverness to London. He says\r\nthat from hunger, bad usage, and exposure “to all weathers, they were\r\nseized with a kind of plague which carried them off by dozens;” and\r\nthat “a good many of those who would have outlived their sickness,\r\nwere wantonly murdered by the sailors, by dipping them in the sea\r\nin the crisis of their fevers.” After arriving in the Thames, the\r\ncommon prisoners were put into Tilbury Fort, and would have perished\r\nfor want had not some humane people supported them. The officers\r\nwere marched rank and file to Southwark jail, amid the hootings of a\r\ntumultuous mob, who loaded them with scornful epithets, and assailed\r\nthem with brickbats, stones, and other missiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1746.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  Charles leaves Benbecula and lands in the island of\r\n  Glass--Proceeds to Harris--Iffurt--Glass--Benbecula--Removes\r\n  to South Uist--Meets Miss Flora Macdonald--Charles proceeds\r\n  to Skye--Goes to Kingsburgh House--Portree--Proceeds to\r\n  Raasay--Returns to Skye--Goes to Ellagol--Interview with\r\n  the Laird of Mackinnon, with whom he proceeds to the\r\n  Mainland--Arrives in Loch Nevis in Moidart--Arrest of Malcolm\r\n  Macleod, Macdonald of Kingsburgh, and Flora Macdonald--Pursuit\r\n  of Charles--Proceeds to Morar--Borodale--Glen Morar--Narrow\r\n  Escapes--Reaches Glenshiel--Entertained by robbers in a\r\n  cave--Death of Roderick Mackenzie, who is mistaken for\r\n  the Prince--Charles arrives in Strathglass--Braes of\r\n  Glengarry--Cameron of Clunes--Auchnacarry--Narrow Escape of\r\n  Charles--Benalder--Cage fitted for Charles’s reception--The\r\n  Prince embarks at Borodale, and arrives safely in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm which drove Charles with such rapidity upon the distant\r\nshores of Benbecula continued for fourteen hours after he had landed.\r\nAccommodating himself to the new situation in which he was placed,\r\nhe manifested no symptoms of dejection at his reverse of fortune,\r\npartook cheerfully along with his companions of the homely fare\r\nbefore him, and with an old sail for a bed, reposed upon the floor\r\nof his lowly dwelling. In Benbecula the prince was visited by old\r\nClanranald, to whom the island belonged; and having afterwards had an\r\ninterview in South Uist with Boisdale, Clanranald’s brother, Charles\r\nwas advised by him to proceed to Stornoway, the principal seaport in\r\nthe island of Lewis, and there give out that he and his company were\r\nthe crew of a merchant ship belonging to the Orkneys, which had been\r\nwrecked on the isle of Tiree, and under the pretence of returning\r\nhome, hire a vessel for that purpose, and escape to France.[1240]\r\nAccordingly, after passing two days in Benbecula, Charles and his\r\nparty set sail for Stornoway on the 29th of April; but in consequence\r\nof a strong gale of wind from the south-west, they were obliged\r\nto put in next morning at the small isle of Scalpa or Glass, near\r\nHarris, about half way between Benbecula and Stornoway. They landed\r\nabout two hours before daybreak, and were conducted by Donald Macleod\r\nto the house of Donald Campbell, a farmer, known to Macleod, to whom\r\nthey were introduced as merchants shipwrecked on their voyage to the\r\nOrkneys. The prince and O’Sullivan took the name of Sinclair, and the\r\nlatter passed off as Charles’ father. The whole party was hospitably\r\nentertained by Campbell, who lent Macleod a boat with which he\r\nproceeded next day, the 1st of May, to Stornoway to hire a vessel,\r\nleaving Charles and his friends behind.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in hiring a small vessel of forty tons, Macleod\r\nsent an express to Charles announcing his success, and requesting\r\nhim to proceed to Stornoway. This message was received on the 3d\r\nof May, and the prince left the isle of Glass next day; but the\r\nwind proving contrary, he was obliged to land in Loch Seaforth, in\r\nthe island of Lewis, a considerable distance from Stornoway. Here\r\nAllan Macdonald took his leave. Accompanied by O’Sullivan, O’Neil,\r\nand his guide, Charles set out on foot for Stornoway, over a wild\r\nand trackless waste, in a very dark and rainy night. The guide lost\r\nhis way, and the party did not reach the neighbourhood of Stornoway\r\ntill next day at noon. This mistake, on the part of the conductor,\r\nwas a fortunate circumstance, as the advanced hour of the day\r\nprevented Charles from entering the town, where he might have been\r\nseized by the inhabitants, who having received information from the\r\nPresbyterian minister of South Uist, that the prince had landed in\r\nLewis with 500 men, with a design of burning their town, carrying off\r\ntheir cattle, and forcing a vessel to carry him to France, afterwards\r\nrose in arms to oppose him. Charles stopped at the Point of Arynish,\r\nabout half a mile from Stornoway, and sent in the guide to acquaint\r\nMacleod of his arrival, and to bring out some refreshment, as he and\r\nhis fellow-travellers had been eighteen hours without food. Donald\r\nimmediately repaired to the spot with some brandy, bread, and cheese,\r\nand found Charles and his two companions standing on a moor extremely\r\nfatigued and all wet to the skin. Donald then took them to the house\r\nof Mrs. Mackenzie of Kildun, at Arynish, where the prince went to\r\nbed. Returning to Stornoway, Macleod was quite amazed to find the\r\ntown in commotion, and above 200 men under arms. Unable to comprehend\r\nthe meaning of this sudden rising, Donald went directly into the room\r\nwhere the gentlemen who had taken upon them the rank of officers\r\nhad assembled, and inquired the cause of such a strange proceeding.\r\nHe was instantly assailed with abuse by every person present: they\r\ninformed him of the intelligence they had received from Uist of\r\nCharles’s landing, and of his alleged intentions, and they accused\r\nMacleod as the cause of the calamity with which they were threatened.\r\nUnable to deny the fact of Charles’s arrival in Lewis, Macleod at\r\nonce admitted it, and to allay their fears he informed them, that so\r\nfar from having a body of 500 men along with him, as represented, he\r\nwas attended by two companions only; “and yet,” said Donald, with an\r\nair of defiance, “let me tell you farther, gentlemen, if Seaforth\r\nhimself were here, by G-- he durst not put a hand to the prince’s\r\nbreast!”[1241] The gentlemen present then declared that they had no\r\nintention to do the prince the least harm, and the only thing they\r\nrequired of him was to leave the island. Donald offered instantly to\r\ncomply, and requested them to give him a pilot, but they refused; and\r\nalthough he offered the most liberal payment he could not obtain one.\r\nAlarmed for the consequences of being privy to the prince’s escape,\r\nthe master of the vessel which had been hired, either suspecting the\r\nobject, or let, as is supposed, into the secret by Macleod, refused\r\nto implement his bargain.[1242]\r\n\r\nReturning to the prince, Macleod informed him of these disagreeable\r\noccurrences. A proposal was made to fly to the moors; but Charles,\r\nthinking that such a step would encourage his enemies to pursue, he\r\nresolved to pass the night at Kildun. Here the party killed a cow,\r\nfor which the lady refused payment, but being pressed by Macleod she\r\nat last took the money. Edward Burke performed the duties of cook;\r\nbut the prince, on the present occasion, superintended the culinary\r\ndepartment, and with his own hands prepared a cake of oatmeal, mixed\r\nwith the brains of the cow, and baked it upon a stone before the\r\nfire. At daybreak next morning the party left the island, carrying\r\nalong with them a small stock of beef, two pecks of meal, and\r\nabundance of brandy and sugar. At this time the prince, O’Sullivan,\r\nand O’Neil had only six shirts amongst them, and being often drenched\r\nwith rain, they were frequently obliged to take off the wet ones\r\nbefore the others were half dry. Conceiving that he would be more\r\nsecure on the mainland than among the islands, Charles resolved to\r\nreturn thither, and ordered the boatmen to carry him to Bollein in\r\nKintail; but they refused on account of the length of the voyage,\r\nwhich they considered dangerous in an open boat. They, therefore,\r\nproceeded southwards along the coast; but they had not proceeded\r\nfar when they observed two large vessels at a distance sailing\r\nnorthwards, and making towards them. To avoid these ships they put\r\ninto the small isle called Euirn or Iffurt, near Harris, a little to\r\nthe northward of the island of Glass. On landing, the prince and his\r\nattendants went to the summit of a little hill to observe the ships.\r\nCharles thought they were French, but his companions considered them\r\nEnglish. He was desirous to ascertain the fact, but the boatmen\r\ncould not be prevailed upon to go out and reconnoitre them. It is\r\nprobable that these were the two frigates from Nantz, which arrived\r\nin Lochnanuagh the day after Charles’s departure from that place, and\r\nhaving landed the money, arms, and ammunition they had brought over\r\nfor his service, were returning to France.[1243]\r\n\r\nThe little island on which Charles now was, was inhabited by a few\r\nfishermen, who, imagining the prince’s boat to be a press-boat\r\nbelonging to one of the ships of war, ran away to conceal themselves,\r\nleaving their fish behind. Charles and his party fared upon some of\r\nthe fish which they found drying upon the beach. Unwilling to deprive\r\nthe poor fishermen of any part of their hard-earned spoils without\r\nan equivalent, the prince was about laying down some money on the\r\nplace from which the fish were taken; but on one of his followers\r\nrepresenting to him that by doing so the fishermen might suppose that\r\nsome person of note had visited the island, and that such an idea\r\nmight lead to bad consequences, he desisted. Charles remained in this\r\ndesolate island four days, during all which time he and his party lay\r\nin a wretched hut, resembling a hog-sty, and so wretchedly roofed\r\nthat they were obliged to spread the boat’s sail over the top of it.\r\nThey lay upon the bare floor, without any covering, and to prevent\r\nsurprise, kept watch by turns.\r\n\r\nResolving to return to Glass to pay Donald Campbell a visit,\r\nCharles left the little island of Iffurt on the 10th of May, and\r\ncoursed along the shores of the Long Island till he arrived at the\r\nisle of Glass. Understanding that Campbell had absconded, from an\r\napprehension that he would be seized for having entertained the\r\nprince,--a rumour to that effect having got abroad,--the prince\r\nleft Glass the same day. There being no wind, the boatmen were\r\nobliged to row all night; but about daybreak, the wind began to\r\nrise, and hoisting sail, they scudded along the coast of Harris.\r\nHaving no fresh water on board, they were forced, from lack of other\r\nprovisions, to use oatmeal made up with salt water, of which Charles\r\npartook heartily. This salt water _drammach_, as this extraordinary\r\npreparation was called, was qualified with a dram of brandy, which\r\nthe prince distributed from a bottle he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nIn coursing along Harris, Charles, while crossing the mouth of\r\nFinsbay, espied a ship of war, commanded by Captain Ferguson,\r\nlying in the bay, at the distance of about two musket shots, which\r\nimmediately gave them chase. The ship followed them three leagues;\r\nbut they escaped among the rocks at the point of Roudil in the\r\nHarris. They then kept close to the shore, and in passing along the\r\ncoast of North Uist were observed by another war vessel lying in\r\nLochmaddy, which also gave them chase. Charles reached Benbecula\r\nafter a very close pursuit, and had scarcely landed when a storm\r\narose, which drove the vessels that pursued him off the coast. After\r\nthis escape, Charles could not help remarking, that Providence would\r\nnot permit him to be taken at this time.\r\n\r\nIt being low water when Charles landed in Benbecula, one of the\r\nboatmen went among the rocks in quest of shell-fish, and found a\r\ncrab, which he held up to the prince with an expression of joy.\r\nTaking up a pail which lay in the boat, Charles immediately proceeded\r\nto the spot where the boatman stood, and, in conjunction with him,\r\nsoon filled the pail with crabs. The party then proceeded to a small\r\nhut which lay at the distance of two miles. Charles carried the pail,\r\nwhich Macleod insisted on relieving him of; but Charles refused to\r\npart with it, observing that he and the rest of the company might\r\ncarry the baggage. The door of the hovel was so low, that the party\r\ncould only enter by creeping in on their hands and knees; but to\r\nmake the entry easier for the prince, Burke dug away part of the\r\nground, and put heather below the prince’s knees. From this homely\r\nresidence, Charles sent a message to old Clanranald, acquainting\r\nhim of his return to Benbecula, and of the difficulties with which\r\nhe was beset. Clanranald repaired without delay to the hut, and\r\npromised Charles all the assistance in his power to enable him to\r\nleave the kingdom. Lady Clanranald, at the same time, sent Charles\r\nhalf-a-dozen of shirts, some shoes and stockings, a supply of wine\r\nand brandy, and other articles, to make his situation as comfortable\r\nas circumstances would admit of. After passing several days in this\r\nmiserable habitation, Charles, by the advice of Clanranald, removed\r\nto South Uist, and took up his abode near the hill of Coradale, in\r\nthe centre of the island, which was considered a more secure place\r\nof retreat.\r\n\r\nWhen on the eve of leaving Benbecula, Charles despatched Donald\r\nMacleod in Campbell’s boat, which he still retained, to the mainland,\r\nwith letters to Lochiel and Secretary Murray, desiring to know how\r\naffairs stood, and requesting that a supply of cash and brandy\r\nmight be sent to him. Donald met Lochiel and Murray at the head of\r\nLoch Arkaig; but Murray, from whom he was desired to obtain the\r\nmoney, informed him that he had none to spare, having only sixty\r\nlouis-d’ors, which he meant to keep for his own necessities. Donald\r\nreceived letters from Lochiel and Murray to the prince, and, having\r\nfound the means, he purchased two ankers of brandy, at a guinea each,\r\nfor the use of the prince, with which he returned after an absence of\r\neighteen days.[1244]\r\n\r\nOn his return he found the prince in a more comfortable dwelling\r\nthan that in which he had left him. He had removed to South Uist\r\non the 16th of May, and lived in the house of one of Clanranald’s\r\ntenants, situated upon Coradale. The house not being water-tight,\r\ntwo cow-hides were placed upon four sticks to prevent the rain\r\nfrom falling upon him when asleep. The house in which the prince\r\nlodged was called the Forest house of Glencoradale, and though the\r\nsituation was remote, it was the best that could be devised for\r\nsecuring a retreat either to the hills or to the sea, according to\r\ncircumstances. There being abundance of game in the island, the\r\nprince occupied himself almost daily in his favourite amusements of\r\nhunting and shooting. His dexterity in shooting birds upon the wing\r\nwas particularly remarked. To vary his recreation, he frequently\r\nwent down to the sea-shore, and going on board a small boat, caught,\r\nwith hand-lines, some small fishes, called lyths by the inhabitants.\r\nClanranald and his lady did every thing in their power to render his\r\nsituation agreeable; and Clanranald placed twelve able men at his\r\ndisposal to serve as guides through the island, and to execute any\r\norders Charles might give them.\r\n\r\nWhile Charles was thus passing his time in South Uist, his situation\r\nevery day was becoming more and more critical. The Long island,\r\nas the principal group of the Hebrides is called, was surrounded\r\non every side by cutters, sloops of war, and frigates. Upwards of\r\nfifteen hundred militia and some regular troops were landed in\r\ndifferent parts of the island, and a guard was posted at every ferry\r\nin the archipelago to prevent any person from getting out of it\r\nwithout a passport. Charles was made aware of his danger; but he\r\ndeclined to leave the Long island till he should receive some farther\r\nintelligence, which Clanranald endeavoured to obtain by crossing over\r\nto the mainland. At length the peril of Charles became so imminent,\r\nthat there appeared no possibility of an escape. He had already spent\r\nthree weeks in South Uist; and though his residence was known to\r\nupwards of a hundred persons, all of whom were probably aware of the\r\nsplendid reward which had been offered for his apprehension, yet such\r\nwas the fidelity of these poor people, that not one of them betrayed\r\ntheir trust, by giving notice to the emissaries of the government\r\nof the place of his concealment. He lived in comparative security\r\nin South Uist till about the middle of June, when, in consequence\r\nof the presence of a body of militia in the island of Eriska, which\r\nlies between Barra and South Uist, he found it absolutely necessary\r\nto shift his quarters. He accordingly left South Uist in Campbell’s\r\nboat with his four companions, on the 14th of June, and landed in the\r\nsmall isle of Wia or Fovaya, between South Uist and Benbecula, in\r\nwhich he remained four nights; and on the 18th, the prince, O’Neil,\r\nand Burke, went to Rossinish, leaving O’Sullivan and Macleod in Wia.\r\nCharles passed two nights at Rossinish; but receiving information\r\nthat some militia were approaching Benbecula, he resolved to return\r\nto Coradale. O’Sullivan and Macleod anticipated Charles’s design by\r\nbringing the boat to Rossinish during the night, and having set sail,\r\nthey encountered a violent storm, accompanied with a heavy rain,\r\nwhich forced them to land upon the rock called Achkirside-allich at\r\nUishinish Point, in a cleft of which they took up their quarters. At\r\nnight, finding their enemies within two miles of them, they sailed\r\nagain, and arrived safely at a place called Celiestiella, whence\r\nthey steered towards Loch Boisdale; but, observing a boat in their\r\nway, they returned to their former place, where they passed the\r\nnight. They proceeded to Loch Boisdale next day, where they were\r\ninformed that Boisdale had been made a prisoner, a circumstance\r\nwhich perplexed Charles exceedingly, as Boisdale, from his perfect\r\nknowledge of the different places of concealment in the Long island,\r\nwas the chief person on whom he relied for directions in his various\r\nmovements. Charles skulked some days about Loch Boisdale, where he\r\nand his attendants received occasional supplies of food from Lady\r\nBoisdale.[1245]\r\n\r\nDuring the time the prince remained in Loch Boisdale, he was kept\r\nin a perpetual state of alarm by the vessels of war which hovered\r\noff the coast of South Uist. At one time no less than fifteen sail\r\nwere in sight; and two of them having entered the Loch, Charles and\r\nhis companions abandoned the boat, and fled to the mountains. The\r\nvessels having gone out to sea, Charles and his party returned to the\r\nboat, in which they had left a small stock of provisions; and having\r\ntaken out the sails for the purpose of covering them, they lay in\r\nthe fields two nights on the south side of the Loch. Removing the\r\nthird night farther up the inlet, they passed two other nights in the\r\nsame way, suffering all the time the greatest privations. Hitherto\r\nthe military had not visited South Uist; but information was brought\r\non the last of these days to Charles, that a party, under Captain\r\nCaroline Scott, an officer celebrated, along with General Hawley,\r\nMajor Lockhart, and others, for his cruelties, had just landed at\r\nthe head of a body of 500 regulars and militia, within a mile and a\r\nhalf of the place where Charles then was. On receiving this alarming\r\nintelligence, Charles instantly resolved to separate his party; and\r\nleaving O’Sullivan, Macleod, and Burke, with the boatmen, to shift\r\nfor themselves, he and O’Neil went off to the mountains, carrying\r\nonly two shirts along with them. The faithful Macleod was so affected\r\nat parting that he shed tears.[1246]\r\n\r\nBeset with dangers on every hand, Charles and his companion directed\r\ntheir steps towards Benbecula, and, about midnight, came to a hut\r\ninto which O’Neil entered. Providentially for Charles, O’Neil here\r\nfound Miss Flora Macdonald, with whom he had got lately acquainted\r\nat Ormaclade, the seat of Clanranald, in Benbecula, when on a visit\r\nto the chief, whose kinswoman she was. This lady, whose memory will\r\never be held in esteem by posterity, for her generous and noble\r\ndisinterestedness in rescuing the prince from the imminent perils\r\nwhich surrounded him, was the daughter of Macdonald of Milton, in the\r\nisland of South Uist. Her father left her an orphan when only a year\r\nold, and her mother had married Macdonald of Armadale, in the isle\r\nof Skye, who commanded one of the militia companies raised in that\r\nisland by Sir Alexander Macdonald, and was now in South Uist at the\r\nhead of his corps. Miss Macdonald was about twenty-four years of age,\r\nof the middle size, and to the attractions of a handsome figure and\r\ngreat vivacity, she added the more estimable mental qualities of good\r\nsense, blandness of temper, and humanity. The hut in which O’Neil now\r\nmet Miss Macdonald belonged to her only brother, Angus Macdonald of\r\nMilton, in whose family she then resided.\r\n\r\nAs O’Neil recollected that Miss Macdonald had expressed, in his\r\npresence, an earnest desire to see the prince, and had offered to do\r\nany thing in her power to protect him, it occurred to O’Neil that,\r\non the present occasion, she might render an essential service to\r\nthe prince if, after dressing him in female attire, she would pass\r\nhim off as her maid-servant, and carry him to Skye. O’Neil at once\r\nproposed his plan to the young lady; but she thought it fantastical\r\nand dangerous, and at first positively refused to engage in it. As\r\nparties of the Macdonald, Macleod, and Campbell militia were roaming\r\nover the island of South Uist in quest of Charles, as no person could\r\nleave the island without a passport, and as there was a guard posted\r\nat every ferry, and the channel between Uist and Skye covered with\r\nships of war, the utter hopelessness of such an attempt appeared\r\nevident. Bent, however, upon his plan, O’Neil was resolved to try\r\nwhat effect Charles’s own presence would have upon the young lady\r\nin inducing her to yield, and he accordingly introduced her to the\r\nprince. Miss Macdonald was so strongly impressed with his critical\r\nand forlorn state, that, on seeing Charles, she almost instantly\r\nconsented to conduct him to Skye. She describes the prince at this\r\ntime as in a bad state of health; and though of a thin and weak\r\nhabit of body, and greatly worn out by fatigue, yet exhibiting a\r\ncheerfulness, magnanimity, and fortitude, which those only who saw\r\nhim could have credited.[1247]\r\n\r\nHaving thus given her consent to O’Neil’s proposal, Miss Macdonald\r\ninstantly proceeded to Clanranald’s house to procure the necessary\r\nrequisites for the intended voyage to Skye. In crossing one of\r\nthe fords on her way to Ormaclade, she and her man-servant, Neil\r\nMac Eachan,[1248] not having passports, were taken prisoners by\r\na party of militia, and, being detained till next morning, were\r\nbrought before the commanding officer, who luckily turned out to\r\nbe her own step-father, Captain Hugh Macdonald. Having stated to\r\nhim her intention of proceeding to Skye to her mother, she, without\r\ndifficulty or suspicion, procured a passport from her stepfather,\r\nfor herself, a manservant, and her maid, who, in the passport, was\r\ncalled Betty Burke, (the name the prince was to assume,) and who was\r\nrecommended by Captain Macdonald to his wife as an excellent spinner\r\nof flax, and a faithful servant.[1249] Next day at four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon, Charles received a message from Miss Macdonald,\r\nwho had reached Ormaclade, informing him that “all was well;” on\r\nreceiving which, he and O’Neil resolved to join her immediately;\r\nbut, to their great consternation, the messenger informed them\r\nthat they could not pass either of the fords that separated South\r\nUist from Benbecula as they were both guarded by the military. In\r\ntheir perplexity, an inhabitant offered to convey them in his boat\r\nto Benbecula; and they were accordingly landed on a promontory of\r\nthat island. They dismissed the boat, after having given orders\r\nto the boatmen to meet them on the opposite side of the island,\r\nand proceeded on their journey; but they had not gone far when\r\nthey observed that the land on which they stood was surrounded by\r\nwater. Thinking that the pilot had made a mistake, they hallooed\r\nafter the boat, but in vain, as it was already far from the shore.\r\nAs it was high water, Charles and his companion imagined that they\r\ncould obtain a dry passage on the subsiding of the tide; but they\r\nwere disappointed. The situation of the prince now appeared dismal.\r\nAfter escaping so many dangers, he had at present no prospect but to\r\nstarve upon a desert island. Nevertheless, he kept up his spirit;\r\nand, after a laborious search, he succeeded in finding a ford, by\r\nwhich he and his companion crossed.[1250] Charles and his companion\r\narrived at Rossinish, the place of rendezvous, about midnight, wet\r\nto the skin, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. Finding that a\r\nparty of military was stationed at a short distance, they retired\r\nto another place, about four miles from Rossinish, whence O’Neil\r\nwent to Ormaclade to ascertain the reason why Miss Macdonald had\r\nnot kept her appointment. In explanation, she informed him, that\r\nconceiving the prince would be safer in North Uist than in Skye,\r\nshe had engaged a cousin of her own in North Uist to receive him\r\ninto his house. This gentleman, however, having afterwards declined\r\nto run the risk of harbouring the prince, Miss Macdonald made the\r\nnecessary preparations for her voyage. Having hired a six-oared boat\r\nto carry her to Skye, which she ordered to be in readiness at an\r\nappointed place the following day, Miss Macdonald left Ormaclade on\r\nthe 27th of June, along with Lady Clanranald, a Mrs. Macdonald and\r\nMac Eachan, all of whom were conducted by O’Neil to the place where\r\nCharles lay concealed, about eight miles from Ormaclade. On entering\r\nthe hovel, they found Charles employed in roasting, for dinner, the\r\nheart, liver, and kidneys of a sheep upon a wooden spit. The ladies\r\nbegan to compassionate the prince upon his unfortunate situation;\r\nbut he diverted their attention from this melancholy subject by some\r\nfacetious observations. He remarked that the wretched to-day may be\r\nhappy to-morrow, and that all great men would be better by suffering\r\nas he was doing. The party dined in the hut, Miss Macdonald sitting\r\non the right, and Lady Clanranald on the left hand of the prince.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Charles put on the female attire, which had been\r\nprovided for him by the ladies. It was coarse and homely, and\r\nconsisted of a flowered linen gown, a light-coloured quilted\r\npetticoat, a white apron, and a mantle of dun camlet made after\r\nthe Irish fashion, with a hood. Whilst Charles was putting on this\r\nextraordinary dress, several jokes were passed on the singularity of\r\nthe prince’s appearance. The ladies and Neil Mac Eachan returned to\r\nOrmaclade, and in the evening again met Charles and his companion on\r\nthe sea-shore, at a mile’s distance from that house. They sat down\r\nto supper on the sea-side; but before they had finished, a messenger\r\narrived with information that General Campbell and Captain Ferguson\r\nhad arrived at Ormaclade with a large party of soldiers and marines,\r\nin quest of Charles. Lady Clanranald went immediately home, and, on\r\nreaching her house, was interrogated very strictly by these officers\r\nas to the cause of her absence; but she excused herself by saying\r\nthat she had been visiting a sick child.[1251]\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Lady Clanranald, Charles and his protectress\r\nwent down to the beach, where their boat lay afloat, so as to be in\r\nreadiness to embark in case the military should appear. They kindled\r\na fire upon a rock; but they had scarcely warmed themselves, when\r\nthey were thrown into a state of alarm by the appearance of four\r\nboats full of armed men, apparently making towards the shore. They\r\ninstantly extinguished their fire, and concealed themselves behind\r\nsome rocks. Fortunately they were not observed by the boats, which,\r\ninstead of coming to land, sailed along the shore, within a gun-shot\r\nof the spot where Charles lay concealed. Judging it unwise to put to\r\nsea during the day, Charles deferred his voyage till the evening, and\r\naccordingly embarked, at eight o’clock on the 28th of June, for Skye,\r\naccompanied by Miss Macdonald and Neil Mac Eachan. The prince was\r\nextremely sorry to part with O’Neil, his only remaining companion,\r\nand entreated Miss Macdonald to allow him to accompany them; but, as\r\nshe had only three passports, she absolutely refused to accede to the\r\nrequest.[1252]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles left the shores of Benbecula the evening was clear and\r\nserene, and a gentle and favourable breeze rippled over the bosom\r\nof the deep; but as they proceeded to sea the sky began to lower,\r\nand they had not rowed above a league when the wind rose, the sea\r\nbecame rough, and a tempest ensued which seemed to threaten them with\r\ndestruction. Miss Macdonald and the boatmen grew alarmed, but Charles\r\nshowed the greatest composure, and, to revive their drooping spirits,\r\nalternately related some amusing stories and sang several songs,\r\namong which was an old spirited air composed on the occasion of the\r\nrestoration of Charles II. In the passage Miss Macdonald fell asleep,\r\nand Charles took every precaution to prevent her being disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flora mcdonald (her signature)\r\n\r\nFrom Original Painting by I. Mackluin, 1747.]\r\n\r\nThe wind having shifted several times during the night, the boatmen\r\nhad not been able to keep a regular course, and when day-light\r\nappeared next morning, they found themselves out of sight of land\r\nwithout knowing where they were. Having no compass, they proceeded\r\nat random; but they had not sailed far when they perceived some of\r\nthe headlands of Skye. Favoured by the wind, they soon gained the\r\npoint of Waternish, on the west of the island. In passing along\r\nthis point they were fired upon by a party of Macleod militia, who\r\ncalled upon them to land; but they continued their course, and, to\r\nprevent suspicion, plied their oars very slowly. Charles told the\r\nboatmen “not to fear the villains;” but they assured him that they\r\ndid not care for themselves: their only fear was for him. “No fear\r\nof me!” was Charles’s reply. Encouraged by the undaunted bravery of\r\nthe prince, the boat’s crew applied themselves with energy to their\r\noars; on observing which the Macleods continued to fire at the boat\r\ntill it got out of reach of their shot, but did no harm. Whilst the\r\nbullets were falling about the boat, Charles, it is said, requested\r\nMiss Macdonald to lie down in the bottom of the boat in order to\r\navoid them; but she heroically declined the proposal, and declared\r\nthat, as she was endeavouring to preserve the life of her prince,\r\nshe would never degrade herself by attending to the safety of her own\r\nperson while that of her master was in jeopardy. She even solicited\r\nCharles to occupy the place he had assigned for her. The prince, as\r\nthe danger increased, became more urgent; but no entreaties could\r\nprevail upon Miss Macdonald to abandon her intrepid resolution, till\r\nCharles offered to lie down also. Both accordingly lay down in the\r\nbottom of the boat, till out of reach of the bullets of the militia.\r\n\r\nAfter escaping this danger they entered a small creek, and the\r\nparty, after taking a short rest, proceeded to Kilbride, and landed\r\nnear Mugstot or Moydhstat, the seat of Sir Alexander Macdonald,\r\nnear the northern extremity of Skye. Sir Alexander was at this time\r\nwith the Duke of Cumberland at Fort Augustus; and, as his lady was\r\nknown to be a warm friend of the prince, Flora resolved to proceed\r\nto Moydhstat and acquaint her of Charles’s arrival. Lady Margaret\r\nMacdonald had inherited the spirit of Jacobitism from her father\r\nAlexander, Earl of Eglintoun; and, as she knew that her husband was\r\na Jacobite at heart, she was less scrupulous to assist the prince\r\nin his necessities. Knowing her good intentions, Charles had, about\r\na week before his arrival in Skye, written her a letter, which was\r\nsent inclosed in one from Hugh Macdonald of Balishair, in North Uist,\r\nto his brother Donald Roy Macdonald, who was requested to deliver\r\nthe letter into her ladyship’s own hand. Balishair announced in the\r\nletter to his brother, that, as a very strict search was making\r\nin the Long island for Charles, he intended to seek refuge upon a\r\nsmall grass island, called Fladdachuan, belonging to Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald, lying to the north of Trotternish, with only one tenant\r\nupon it, and requesting him to keep a sharp look-out for the prince,\r\nto meet him upon Fladdachuan and provide him with necessaries. He\r\nwas desired to show the letter to Lady Margaret, and after she had\r\nperused it to throw it into the fire; and he also requested that her\r\nladyship should do the same with the letter sent her. The letter was\r\naccordingly delivered to Lady Margaret by Donald Roy, who burnt his\r\nown, as directed; but, on begging Lady Margaret to put hers into the\r\nfire, she rose up, and, kissing the letter, exclaimed, “No! I will\r\nnot burn it. I will preserve it for the sake of him who wrote it to\r\nme. Although King George’s forces should come to the house, I hope I\r\nshall find a way to secure the letter.”[1253]\r\n\r\nLeaving Charles in the boat, Miss Flora, accompanied by Neil Mac\r\nEachan, set out for Mugstot, to apprise Lady Margaret of her arrival.\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance that Charles was left behind, as\r\nthere was a militia officer of the name of Macleod in the house,\r\nwho, on Miss Macdonald’s entering the room where he was sitting,\r\nquestioned her very closely as to her journey; but she answered\r\nhis interrogatories so readily, and with such apparent candour and\r\nsimplicity, that he had not the least suspicion that she was any way\r\nconcerned about the prince. Charles’s arrival was not altogether\r\nunexpected, as she had been informed the day before by Mrs.\r\nMacdonald, wife of John Macdonald of Kirkebost, in North Uist, who\r\nhad come from the Long island, of the probability of his appearing\r\nspeedily in Skye. Lady Margaret, on being informed of the prince’s\r\narrival in her neighbourhood, was greatly alarmed for his safety. Her\r\nactive benevolence was ever seconded by superior talents; and, on\r\nthe present occasion, she displayed a presence of mind and readiness\r\nof invention, which corresponded with these high qualifications.\r\nMr. Macdonald of Kingsburgh, Sir Alexander’s factor, being then in\r\nthe house, she resolved to consult him in this emergency. Desirous\r\nalso to avail herself of the services of Captain Roy Macdonald, who\r\nhad visited Fladdachuan in quest of the prince, she sent an express\r\nto Trotternish, where he then resided, requesting his immediate\r\nattendance at Mugstot. Mounting his horse, he repaired to the spot,\r\nand found Lady Margaret and Kingsburgh walking together, in serious\r\nconversation. On dismounting, Lady Margaret came up to him and\r\nexclaimed, “O Donald Roy, we are ruined for ever!” After a long\r\nconsultation, Lady Margaret proposed that, as the prince could not\r\nremain long in Skye without being discovered, he should be conducted\r\nto old Raasay, who was himself concealed with some select friends,\r\nand that, in the mean time, he should take up his residence in\r\nKingsburgh house.\r\n\r\nDuring the time this consultation lasted, Charles remained upon the\r\nshore, at a short distance from the foot of the garden. Kingsburgh\r\nproposed to go and acquaint him with their determination; but, lest\r\nhe might be observed by some of the military about the house, Neil\r\nMac Eachan was sent to inform him that Kingsburgh meant to visit\r\nhim, and to request that he would retire behind a neighbouring hill\r\nto escape observation. Taking with him some wine and provisions,\r\nKingsburgh repaired to the spot where Mac Eachan had left Charles.\r\nTo his great surprise, however, Charles was not to be seen, and he\r\nin vain searched for him in the neighbourhood of the place where he\r\nexpected to meet him. Despairing of finding the prince, Kingsburgh\r\nwould have returned to Mugstot; but the bounding of a flock of sheep\r\nat a distance, indicating that some person was at hand, Kingsburgh\r\nwent forward to the place whence the sheep had fled, where he found\r\nthe prince sitting on the ground. Charles started up when he saw\r\nKingsburgh approaching. He advanced cautiously towards him, holding\r\na large knotted stick in his hand, as if intending to knock down\r\nthe stranger. “I am Macdonald of Kingsburgh, come to serve your\r\nhighness,” said the good Highlander, as he approached. “It is well,”\r\nanswered Charles, who went forward to receive his friend. They then\r\nsaluted each other, and the prince took some refreshment. Kingsburgh\r\nthen mentioned Lady Macdonald’s plan, with which Charles having\r\nexpressed himself satisfied, they both proceeded to Kingsburgh house.\r\n\r\nTill the departure of Kingsburgh to meet Charles, the uneasiness of\r\nLady Macdonald was extreme. Flora too, who had remarked her anxiety,\r\nhad her misgivings lest the prince should be discovered; but with\r\nher wonted firmness she kept up the conversation with the commander\r\nof the detachment, till dinner was announced, by which time Charles\r\nwas on his way to Kingsburgh. After dinner, Miss Macdonald rose\r\nto depart; but Lady Macdonald, in order to deceive the officer,\r\npressed her to remain, and put her in mind that she had promised\r\non a former occasion to make some stay the first time she should\r\nvisit Moydhstat. Flora, however, excused herself, on the ground that\r\nshe was anxious to be with her mother, who, in the absence of her\r\nhusband, could not but feel uneasy in such troublesome times. With\r\napparent reluctance Lady Margaret at length accepted her apology,\r\nunder the condition that she should make amends for her sudden\r\ndeparture by making a longer stay at Moydhstat on her next visit.\r\n\r\nMiss Macdonald accordingly proceeded on her journey, accompanied by\r\nNeil Mac Eachan, and by Mrs. Macdonald, the lady formerly mentioned,\r\nwho was attended by a male and female servant. The whole party, who\r\nwere on horseback, soon overtook the prince and Kingsburgh, who\r\nhad gone so far by the common road. Mrs. Macdonald, who had never\r\nseen the prince before, was desirous of obtaining a view of his\r\ncountenance, and made several attempts to look him in the face,\r\nbut Charles always turned his head aside to avoid her gaze. Mrs.\r\nMacdonald’s maid observing this, and being struck with the uncouth\r\nappearance of the prince, remarked to Miss Flora, that she had\r\nnever before seen such an impudent looking woman as the one with\r\nwhom Kingsburgh was walking, and stated her impression, that the\r\nsingular looking stranger was either an Irishwoman, or a man in\r\nwoman’s clothes. Miss Macdonald informed the girl that she was quite\r\nright in her conjecture that the extraordinary looking female was\r\nan Irishwoman, for she knew her, having seen her before. The maid\r\nthen exclaimed, “Bless me, what long strides the jade takes, and how\r\nawkwardly she manages her petticoats!” To put an end to the prying\r\ncuriosity of Mrs. Macdonald’s maid, and to prevent the servants of\r\nthat lady from observing the route which the prince and Kingsburgh\r\nwere about to take across the hills, Miss Macdonald called upon\r\nthe party to ride faster, as they had a long way to travel. They\r\naccordingly set off at the trot, and, when the party were out of\r\nsight, the two pedestrians, to avoid the militia, who were on all\r\nthe public roads, went off by an unfrequented path, and arrived at\r\nKingsburgh house about eleven o’clock at night, where they were\r\nalmost immediately joined by Miss Macdonald and Neil Mac Eachan.\r\n\r\nNot expecting her husband home at such a late hour, Mrs. Macdonald\r\nhad undressed, and was just going into bed, when one of her maid\r\nservants entered her bed-room, and informed her that Kingsburgh\r\nhad arrived, and had brought company with him, and that Miss Flora\r\nMacdonald was among the guests. Mrs. Macdonald sent down word to\r\nFlora, that being sleepy and undressed she hoped she would excuse\r\nher for not coming down stairs, but begged that she would use her\r\nfreedom, and help herself to anything she might require. Immediately\r\nupon the departure of the servant down stairs, a young girl, a\r\ndaughter of Kingsburgh, entered her mother’s apartment in a great\r\nhurry, and, with looks of surprise, informed her, that her father had\r\nbrought to the house the most “odd muckle ill-shaken-up wife she had\r\never seen, and taken her into the hall too!” Before Mrs. Macdonald\r\nhad time to form any conjecture on the subject, Kingsburgh himself\r\nentered his wife’s bed-chamber, and desired her to dress herself as\r\nfast as she could, and get some supper ready for his guests. Mrs.\r\nMacdonald asked the names of her visitors, but Kingsburgh said he had\r\nno time for explanation; and after telling her that she would know\r\nthe whole matter in time, and urging her to make haste, he returned\r\nto his friends in the hall.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with her husband’s desire, Mrs. Macdonald proceeded to\r\ndress herself, and sent her daughter down for her keys, which she had\r\nleft in the hall. The girl went, but she returned almost instantly in\r\na state of alarm, and told her mother that she was afraid to venture\r\ninto the hall, as the tall woman was walking up and down in it.\r\nMrs. Macdonald then went down herself; but on observing the prince\r\nstriding through the hall she hesitated to enter, and calling to her\r\nhusband requested him to go in and bring her the keys. Kingsburgh,\r\nhowever, refused to humour the pusillanimity of his wife, and she was\r\nat length obliged to enter.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Macdonald entered the hall, Charles, who, during the\r\naltercation between her and her husband, had taken a seat, rose up,\r\nand advancing, immediately saluted her agreeably to the Highland\r\npractice. Mrs. Macdonald, little expecting the roughness of a male\r\nchin under a female attire, began to tremble, and, without saying\r\na word to the silent and mysterious being who stood before her,\r\nshe hastened out of the hall, and going to her husband importuned\r\nhim to inform her who the stranger was. She had not the least idea\r\nthat the person who saluted her was the prince; and, imagining\r\nthat the stranger was some nobleman or gentleman in disguise, she\r\ninquired if he knew what had become of the prince. Smiling at her\r\nsimplicity, Kingsburgh said to her, “My dear, the person in the hall\r\nis the prince himself.” Alarmed at this unexpected announcement,\r\nshe exclaimed, “The prince! then we are all ruined: we will all be\r\nhanged now!” “Hout,” replied Kingsburgh, “we can die but once; and\r\nif we are hanged for this we shall die in a good cause, doing only\r\nan act of humanity and charity. But go,” continued he, “make haste\r\nwith supper; bring us eggs, butter, cheese, and whatever else can\r\nbe got quickly ready.” “Eggs, butter, and cheese!” rejoined Mrs.\r\nMacdonald, “what a supper is that for a prince!” “Oh! wife,” replied\r\nKingsburgh, “you know little how this good prince has lived of late;\r\nthis will be a feast to him. Besides, to make a formal supper would\r\nmake the servants suspect something; the less ceremony, therefore,\r\nthe better; make haste, and come to supper yourself.” Mrs. Macdonald,\r\ndoubtful of her own capabilities to conduct herself properly before\r\nroyalty, exclaimed, “_I_ come to supper! I know not how to behave\r\nbefore Majesty!” “You must come,” replied Kingsburgh, “the prince\r\nwill not eat one bit without you; and you will find it no difficult\r\nmatter to behave before him, so obliging and easy is he in his\r\nconversation.”[1254]\r\n\r\nAt supper Charles placed Miss Flora on his right hand, and Mrs.\r\nMacdonald on his left. He always conferred the above mark of\r\ndistinction on his young protectress, and whenever she came into any\r\nroom where he was sitting, he always rose up on her entry. Charles\r\nmade a hearty supper, and drank a bumper of brandy to the health\r\nand prosperity of Kingsburgh and his wife. After supper he smoked a\r\npipe, a practice which he was obliged to adopt in his wanderings, to\r\nmitigate a toothache with which he was troubled.[1255] Having drunk\r\na few glasses of wine, and finished his pipe, Charles went to bed.\r\n\r\nAfter Charles went to bed, Miss Flora, at the desire of Mrs.\r\nMacdonald, gave her a relation of the prince’s adventures, in as far\r\nas she had been personally concerned. When she finished her recital,\r\nMrs. Macdonald asked her what had become of the boatmen who brought\r\nthe prince and her to Skye. Miss Macdonald answered, that they had\r\nbeen sent directly back to South Uist. Mrs. Macdonald observed that\r\nit was wrong to have sent the boat back immediately, as in case of\r\ncapture on their return, the boatmen might disclose the business\r\nwhich brought them to Skye, and the prince’s pursuers might in\r\nconsequence overtake him before he could leave that island. Mrs.\r\nMacdonald was right in her conjecture; for the boatmen were seized\r\non their return to South Uist, and being threatened with torture,\r\nand ultimately with death, revealed all they knew, giving even a\r\nminute description of the prince’s dress. To lessen the dangers\r\nof a discovery of the prince’s route, Flora advised the prince to\r\nchange his clothes next day, a proposal which met with his cordial\r\napprobation, as he found the female attire very cumbrous.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of a good bed had not been enjoyed by Charles for\r\nmany weeks. Three, or at most four, hours’ sleep was all he had\r\ngenerally been accustomed to during his wanderings; but, on the\r\npresent occasion he slept ten hours without interruption, and might\r\nhave added a few more to the number, had he not been wakened by\r\nKingsburgh, who was prevailed upon by Miss Macdonald, contrary to\r\nhis own inclination, to rouse the prince. In talking of Charles’s\r\nintended departure, Kingsburgh, acting upon Flora’s suggestion,\r\nurged upon the prince the propriety of changing his dress, lest\r\nthe circumstance of his being in female attire might transpire,\r\nand Kingsburgh offered him a Highland dress of his own. Charles at\r\nonce assented to the proposal; but, to prevent suspicion among the\r\nservants, and to keep them in ignorance of the nature and description\r\nof the new dress in which Charles was to travel, it was arranged that\r\nhe should leave the house in the same dress he entered it, and, when\r\nout of reach of observation, assume that offered to him by his kind\r\nentertainer.\r\n\r\nHaving dressed himself, the ladies went into his chamber to pin his\r\ncap, put on his apron, and adjust the other parts of his dress.\r\nBefore Miss Macdonald put on the cap, Mrs. Macdonald requested her,\r\nin Gaelic, to ask Charles for a lock of his hair. Flora declined,\r\ndesiring her, at the same time, to make the application herself to\r\nhis Royal Highness. The prince, though unable to comprehend what\r\nthey were saying, clearly perceived that they were disputing about\r\nsomething, and, desiring to know the subject of altercation, was\r\ninformed thereof by Mrs. Macdonald. Charles then told her that her\r\nrequest was granted, and laying down his head upon Flora’s lap, he\r\ndesired her to cut off a lock. She complied, and divided the destined\r\nrelic between them. Before leaving the house Kingsburgh thought there\r\nwas an article of dress that Charles might instantly change without\r\nmuch risk. This was his shoes, which were so much worn that his toes\r\nprotruded through them. He, therefore, presented a new pair of his\r\nown to his Royal Highness, and, taking up the out-worn brogues, said\r\nto Charles, “I will faithfully keep them till you are safely in St.\r\nJames’s; I will introduce myself by shaking them at you, to put you\r\nin mind of your night’s entertainment and protection under my roof.”\r\nThe prince, amused with the quaintness of the idea, could not refrain\r\nfrom smiling, and, to humour the joke, enjoined his host to keep his\r\npromise. Kingsburgh kept the shoes as long as he lived, and after his\r\ndeath they were purchased by a zealous Jacobite gentleman, who gave\r\ntwenty guineas for them.[1256]\r\n\r\nOn being dressed, the prince partook of breakfast, and having taken\r\na kind leave of Mrs. Macdonald, left Kingsburgh house for Portree,\r\nwhere it had been concerted he should embark for the island of\r\nRaasay. He was accompanied by Miss Flora and Kingsburgh, who carried\r\nunder his arm the suit of clothes designed for the prince. When\r\nCharles left the house, Mrs. Macdonald went up stairs to the room in\r\nwhich he had slept, and, folding the sheets in which he had lain,\r\nput them carefully aside, declaring that henceforth they should\r\nnever again be washed or used till her death, when they should serve\r\nher as a winding sheet; to which use they were accordingly applied,\r\nin fulfilment of injunctions she delivered before her death.[1257]\r\nAfter walking a short distance from the house, Charles and Kingsburgh\r\nentered a wood, where the prince threw off his female attire, and put\r\non the clothes which his good friend had provided. These consisted\r\nof a tartan short coat and waistcoat, with philibeg and short hose,\r\na plaid, and a wig and bonnet. When Charles had shifted, he embraced\r\nKingsburgh, and thanked him for his valuable services, which he\r\nassured him he would never forget. Charles, conducted by a guide,\r\nthen set out on foot across the hills, and Miss Macdonald took\r\nanother and a shorter way on horseback, to obtain intelligence, and\r\nprevent a discovery.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the resolution to proceed to Raasay, Donald Roy\r\nhad been despatched from Mugstot by Kingsburgh the preceding day, in\r\nquest of John Macleod, the young laird of Raasay, to ascertain from\r\nhim the place of his father’s concealment, in order to communicate to\r\nthe latter Charles’s design of placing himself under his protection.\r\nWhen it is considered, that Macleod, the laird of Raasay, was himself\r\na fugitive for the part he had taken in the insurrection, such a\r\ndesign may appear singular; but the prince had only a choice of\r\ndifficulties before him, and the little island of Raasay, which was\r\nthen clear of troops, appeared to offer the securest retreat. Donald\r\nRoy met young Raasay at Portree, who informed him that his father\r\nwas skulking in Knoydart; but offered to send an express for him,\r\nbeing certain his father would run any risk to serve the prince in\r\nhis distress. Donald Roy then proposed that he should conduct Charles\r\nto the mainland, to the place where old Raasay was; but young Raasay\r\nsaid that such a step would be too dangerous at that time, and that\r\nit would be better to conceal the prince in the isle of Raasay till\r\nhis father should be informed of Charles’s intention to put himself\r\nunder his protection. As they could not trust a Portree crew, the\r\ndifficulty of transporting the prince to Raasay, without observation,\r\noccurred. Dr. Murdoch Macleod, a brother of young Raasay, who had\r\nbeen wounded at the battle of Culloden, being informed of this\r\ndilemma, said he would risk his life once more for the prince, and\r\nit having occurred to him that there was a little boat upon a fresh\r\nwater lake in the neighbourhood, the two brothers, with the aid of\r\nsome women, by extraordinary exertions, brought the boat to sea, over\r\na Highland mile of land, one half of which was bog, and the other a\r\nsteep precipice. The two brothers, with the assistance of a little\r\nboy, rowed the boat, which was very old and leaky, to Raasay.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Macleod, young Raasay’s cousin, who will be frequently\r\nmentioned in the sequel, was then in the island. He had been a\r\ncaptain in the prince’s service, and was considered by his cousin a\r\nproper person to accompany them on their expedition. They accordingly\r\nwaited on Malcolm, who offered to provide a boat; but he proposed,\r\nthat as his cousin, young Raasay, had not been engaged in the\r\ninsurrection, he should not run any risk by holding communication\r\nwith the prince, more particularly as Charles could be brought\r\nover without his assistance. Young Raasay declared his resolution\r\nto see the prince, if the result should be the loss both of his\r\nestate and his head; and Malcolm, seeing that any farther attempt\r\nto dissuade him would be fruitless, exclaimed, “In God’s name then\r\nlet us proceed.” Malcolm Macleod pitched upon two strong men, named\r\nJohn Mackenzie and Donald Macfriar, to row the boat; but, when they\r\ncame to the beach, they declined to leave the shore till informed\r\nof their destination. They were then sworn to secrecy, and being\r\ntold the object of their voyage, professed the utmost alacrity to go\r\nto sea. The whole party accordingly set off from Raasay on Monday\r\nevening, the 30th of June, and landed about half a mile from Portree.\r\nBy this time Miss Macdonald had arrived at the inn, where Donald\r\nRoy was in waiting to receive her and the prince. Leaving young\r\nRaasay and his brother in the boat, Malcolm Macleod, accompanied by\r\nMacfriar, went towards the inn, and in walking from the shore he\r\nobserved three persons proceeding in the direction of the inn, who\r\nhappened to be the prince, Neil Mac Eachan, and a little boy who had\r\nserved as Charles’s guide from Kingsburgh.\r\n\r\nDonald Roy Macdonald had left the inn shortly after Miss Macdonald’s\r\narrival, for the purpose of meeting Charles; but, after remaining out\r\nabout twenty minutes without seeing him, he returned to the house,\r\nafraid lest the rain, which fell in torrents, might fester a wound\r\nin his foot which he had received at the battle of Culloden, and\r\nwhich was still open. He had scarcely entered the inn, when Macnab,\r\nthe landlord, informed him that a boy wanted to see him. The boy,\r\nwhose name was Macqueen, having informed Donald Roy that a gentleman\r\nwho was waiting a little above the house wished to speak with him,\r\nhe went out and met the prince, who caught him in his arms. Donald\r\nthen conducted him into the inn. Charles was wet to the skin, and\r\nthe water poured down from his clothes. The first thing he asked for\r\nwas a dram, on taking which he proceeded to shift himself. He put on\r\na dry shirt; but before he had replaced the other habiliments which\r\nhe had thrown off, a supply of roasted fish, bread, cheese, and\r\nbutter was brought into the room, which the prince attacked with such\r\navidity that Donald Roy could not help smiling; and being observed\r\nby the prince, he remarked that he believed the prince was following\r\nthe English fashion. “What fashion do you mean?” said the prince.\r\n“Why,” replied Donald Roy, “they say the English, when they are to\r\neat heartily, throw off their clothes.” The prince smiling, said,\r\n“They are in the right, lest anything should incommode their hands\r\nwhen they are at work.” Asking for some drink, Charles was told that\r\nthere were no liquids of any sort in the house but whisky and water,\r\nnot even milk, of which he had desired a little. The only substitute\r\nin the room for a tumbler or jug was a dirty-looking bucket, which\r\nthe landlord used for throwing the water out of his boat, and the\r\nmouth of which was broken and rough from the frequent use to which\r\nit had been thus applied. Donald Roy, who had previously quaffed out\r\nof the bucket, handed it to Charles, who took it out of his hand,\r\nand after looking at it, stared Donald in the face. As the landlord\r\nwas in the room, Donald was afraid that, from the shyness of Charles\r\nto drink out of a dish to which no objection perhaps had ever before\r\nbeen stated, he might think he had a visitor of distinction in his\r\nhouse, and he therefore went up to Charles, and in a gentle whisper\r\ndesired him to drink out of the obnoxious vessel without ceremony.\r\nCharles taking the hint, put the pail to his head, and took a hearty\r\ndraught of water.[1258]\r\n\r\nMalcolm Macleod, on being informed of the prince’s arrival at the\r\ninn, had returned to the boat, and with his cousins waited anxiously\r\nfor the prince. On the landlord of the inn leaving the room, Donald\r\nRoy, who had grown impatient to get away, urged the prince to depart;\r\nbut Charles showed no inclination to leave the inn, and even proposed\r\nto remain there all night, as the rain was still heavy. Donald told\r\nhim that as the house he was in was frequented by all kinds of\r\npeople, he would incur danger by remaining; for the very appearance\r\nof a stranger would excite speculation among the country people, who\r\nwere always desirous to know who the persons were that came among\r\nthem. Charles assented to the correctness of Donald’s observations,\r\nbut called for some tobacco that he might smoke a pipe before his\r\ndeparture. There being no tobacco in the house but roll or pigtail,\r\nCharles said it would answer very well; and the landlord, at the\r\nrequest of Donald Roy, brought in a quarter of a pound in the scales\r\nin which it had been weighed. The price was fourpence halfpenny,\r\nand Charles gave the landlord a sixpence. Donald Roy desired him to\r\nbring in the difference. The prince smiled, and on the change being\r\nbrought he refused to receive it. Donald, however, insisted that he\r\nshould take the three halfpence, because he considered that in his\r\npresent situation he might find “bawbees” very useful.[1259]\r\n\r\nWhen about to leave the inn, Charles solicited Donald Roy to\r\naccompany him to Raasay, observing that he had always found himself\r\nsafe in the hands of the Macdonalds, and that as long as he had a\r\nMacdonald with him he would still think himself safe. This faithful\r\nattendant, whilst he stated his inclination to serve the prince in\r\nhis distress, represented to him the impossibility of following\r\nhim from place to place, in consequence of the wound in his left\r\nfoot, which rendered him incapable of enduring fatigue; and that\r\nas he would be obliged from his lameness to travel occasionally on\r\nhorseback, his presence would only endanger the safety of the prince.\r\nHe agreed, however, to meet Charles in Raasay in a few days, and\r\nstated that, in the mean time, he would remain in Skye, and collect\r\nfor the future guidance of the prince such information as he could,\r\nin relation to the movements and plans of his pursuers.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Portree Charles had a most painful task to perform,\r\nthat of parting with the amiable and high-minded young woman, who,\r\nduring three eventful days, had with generous sympathy, and at the\r\nimminent hazard of her own life, watched over him with the tenderest\r\nsolicitude and affection, and rescued him from the many perils\r\nwith which he had been environed. He repaid Miss Flora a small sum\r\nof money he had borrowed from her, and, presenting her with his\r\nown portrait in miniature, saluted her. He then returned her his\r\nsincere thanks for the great assistance she had afforded him, and\r\ntaking leave, expressed a hope that, notwithstanding the present\r\nunfavourable aspect of his affairs, he should yet meet her in St.\r\nJames’s. He also took farewell of Neil Mac Eachan, who certainly at\r\nthat time had no expectation that he was to be one of those who were\r\nafterwards to accompany the prince to France.\r\n\r\nCharles had brought along with him from Kingsburgh, four shirts, a\r\ncold fowl, some sugar, and a bottle of brandy. To this small stock\r\nhe added at Portree a bottle of usquebaugh. He tied this bottle to\r\nhis belt at one side, and at the other the bottle of brandy, and\r\nthe shirts and cold fowl which were put up in a handkerchief. Thus\r\nprovided, Charles left the inn, accompanied by Donald Roy, on the\r\nmorning of the 1st of July, while it was yet dark. The landlord,\r\nsurprised perhaps at the early departure of his guests, cast a look\r\nafter them as they went out at the door, which being observed by\r\nCharles’s conductor, he led the prince off in a direction opposite\r\nto that they had to go, till out of view of the landlord, and then\r\nmaking a circle they went down towards the shore, and in their way\r\nmet Malcolm Macleod, who conducted the prince to the boat. He then\r\ntook leave of Donald Roy, whom he enjoined not to mention the place\r\nof his destination to any person, not even to his fair protectress.\r\nDonald returned to the inn, and was immediately accosted by his host,\r\nwho expressed a strong desire to know the name of the gentleman\r\nwho had left his house. Donald told him, with apparent unconcern,\r\nthat the stranger who had gone away was Sir John Macdonald, an\r\nIrish gentleman, and a brother rebel, who, having got free of his\r\nenemies, had been skulking among his friends, the Macdonalds of\r\nSkye; and that, tired of remaining in one place, and afraid of being\r\ndiscovered in the island, he had set out for the mainland to seek an\r\nasylum among the other Macdonalds. The landlord, whom he enjoined to\r\nsecrecy, apparently satisfied with this explanation, said that he was\r\nstrongly impressed with an idea that the gentleman was the prince\r\nin disguise, as he observed something about him that looked very\r\nnoble.[1260]\r\n\r\nPortree, a small bay opposite the island of Raasay, from which\r\nCharles was about to depart, had derived its name, which signifies\r\nthe King’s Port, from the circumstance of King James the Fifth having\r\nlanded there during his excursion amongst the western islands.\r\nCharles left this creek after midnight, under the protection of\r\nthe enthusiastic young laird of Raasay, to whom Malcolm Macleod\r\nintroduced him when he entered the boat. As the two boatmen had\r\nserved in the prince’s army, the whole party, with the exception of\r\nyoung Raasay himself, were under the ban of the government, and the\r\nyoung laird, whose only motive in not joining the insurrection was\r\nprobably a desire to save the estate, now fearlessly put his life and\r\nfortune in jeopardy, when the risk was even greater.\r\n\r\nCharles slept a little upon the passage, and reached Raasay about\r\nday-break, a few hours after his departure from Portree. The party\r\nlanded at a place called Glam, about the distance of ten miles from\r\nthat haven. Charles, Malcolm, and Murdoch Macleod took up their\r\nabode in a wretched hut which some shepherds had lately erected.\r\nThey had no bedding of any sort, and were obliged to repose upon\r\nsome heath. On entering the hut they kindled a fire and partook of\r\nsome provisions. On this, as on other occasions, Charles, to please\r\nthe Highlanders, never tasted wheat-bread or brandy while oat-bread\r\nand whisky lasted, for, he observed, that these last were his “own\r\ncountry bread and drink.” Young Raasay had nothing to dread from\r\nhis own people; and, lest the military might revisit the island,\r\nhe placed the two boatmen upon different eminences to watch their\r\napproach. He visited Charles and his friends occasionally, and always\r\ncarried provisions along with him. Though comparatively secure,\r\nCharles was very uneasy in his new retreat; and frequent starts and\r\nexclamations in his slumbers indicated the agitated workings of his\r\nmind. Malcolm Macleod often overheard him in his sleep muttering\r\nimperfect sentences, in Italian, French, and English. One of his\r\nexpressions in English was, “O God! poor Scotland!”[1261]\r\n\r\nDuring Charles’s stay in Raasay, no person visited the island, but he\r\nand his friends were kept in a state of uneasiness by a person who\r\nprowled about without any apparent business, and who had come into\r\nthe island to sell a roll of tobacco. He had arrived about twelve\r\nor fourteen days before Charles. Having disposed of his merchandise\r\nvery speedily, it was expected that he would have departed, but\r\ncontinuing to stroll up and down the island in an idle way, he\r\nwas suspected to be a spy. Malcolm Macleod happening to see him\r\napproaching the hut one day, a council of war was held by Charles and\r\nhis friends. The three Macleods were for putting the poor tobacco\r\nvender to death, and Malcolm Macleod offered to go out immediately\r\nand shoot him through the head; but Charles indignantly reprobated\r\nthe inhuman proposal. “God forbid (said he) that we should take away\r\na man’s life who may be innocent, while we can preserve our own.”\r\nJohn Mackenzie, who sat as sentinel at the door, overhearing the\r\ndebate, said to himself in Gaelic, “Well, well: he must be shot:\r\nyou are the king, but we are the parliament, and will do what we\r\nchoose.” Observing his friends smile, Charles asked what John had\r\nsaid; and being told the man’s observation in English, the prince\r\nobserved that he was a clever fellow; and, notwithstanding his\r\nperilous situation, laughed loud and heartily.[1262] Notwithstanding\r\nCharles’s remonstrances, the stranger would have been despatched had\r\nhe entered the hut, but luckily he walked past without looking into\r\nit. It was afterwards ascertained that the stranger himself was a\r\nfugitive from the Highland army.[1263] While Charles resided in this\r\nhut, he and his companions indulged in a great deal of conversation.\r\nAlluding to passing events and his present situation, the prince\r\nobserved that his life was to be sure a very hard one; but that he\r\nwould rather live in the way he then did for ten years, than fall\r\ninto the hands of his enemies, not because he believed they would\r\ndare to take away his life publicly, but because he dreaded being\r\npoisoned or assassinated. He was very particular in his inquiries\r\nat Dr. Macleod about the wound he had received at Culloden, from a\r\nball which entered at one shoulder and went across to the other. He\r\nthrew out some reflections upon the conduct of some of his officers\r\nat Culloden, but confessed that perhaps it was rash in him to do so.\r\nTalking of the different Highland corps, the Macleods asked Charles\r\nwhich, in his opinion, were the best soldiers; but he evaded a direct\r\nanswer, said he did not like comparisons among such corps; and that\r\nthey were all best.[1264]\r\n\r\nCharles resided two days in Raasay, when becoming uneasy, and\r\nthinking the island too narrow and confined for the purpose of\r\nconcealment, he resolved to depart. Understanding that he expected\r\na French ship at Lochbroom, Malcolm Macleod offered to carry him\r\nthither, but Charles declined the proposal on account of the\r\ndanger of the voyage in a small boat. He expressed a wish to go to\r\nTrotternish in Skye, but his friends attempted to dissuade him, as\r\nthey considered him safer in Raasay. Persisting however in going, the\r\nwhole party, including the two boatmen, left Raasay on the evening\r\nof the 2d of July, in the same boat which they had used to carry\r\nthem into the island. After they had gone a little off the shore\r\nthe wind began to blow hard, and soon increased to a gale. The sea\r\nbecame so very rough, that the waves broke over the boat and almost\r\nfilled it with water. All on board begged the prince to return, but\r\nhe declined, observing, that as Providence had carried him through\r\nso many dangers, he did not doubt of the same care now as before.\r\nAbout eleven o’clock at night they landed at a place in Skye, called\r\nNicolson’s rock, near Scorobreck in Trotternish, after a very\r\nboisterous voyage of about fifteen miles. There was a large surf on\r\nthe shore, and there being no convenient landing place, they had to\r\njump out among the water. Charles was the third man who leapt into\r\nthe sea. Standing in the surf, the whole party, including Charles,\r\nlaid hold of the boat and drew it up on dry ground.\r\n\r\nOn this desolate coast, the royal wanderer could find no other\r\nresting-place than a cow-house, belonging to Mr. Nicolson of\r\nScorobreck, about two miles from that gentleman’s seat. The party\r\nentered this wretched hovel and took a little refreshment of oat\r\ncakes, which had mouldered down into very small crumbs, and some\r\ncheese. Charles being wet to the skin, Malcolm Macleod advised him to\r\nput on a dry shirt. This he declined, and continued to sit in his wet\r\nclothes. Overcome with fatigue he fell asleep; but he enjoyed little\r\nsound repose. He would frequently start in his sleep, look briskly\r\nup, and stare boldly around him, as if about to fight the persons\r\naround him. “Oh poor England! poor England!” were the exclamations\r\nhe would sometimes utter, with a deep sigh, during these disturbed\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nIn all his wanderings it was the constant practice of Charles to\r\nconceal his future movements from every person with whose services he\r\nwas about to dispense, so as to prevent any clue to his discovery.\r\nWishing to get quit of young Raasay and his brother, he despatched\r\nthe former to look out for Donald Roy, and he desired the latter to\r\ngo to a place called Cammistinawag, where he would meet him. Murdoch\r\nMacleod and the two boatmen then took leave. At parting he presented\r\nMurdoch with a case, containing a silver spoon, knife, and fork,\r\nwhich he requested him to keep till they met.\r\n\r\nThe prince and Malcolm Macleod remained in the hut till seven o’clock\r\nin the morning, when Charles, taking the little baggage in his hand,\r\nwalked out, and desired Malcolm to follow him. Macleod took the\r\nbundle out of Charles’s hand, and followed him in silence till out of\r\nsight of the cow-house, when Charles taking a direction Malcolm did\r\nnot like, this faithful adherent went up to him and asked him where\r\nhe was going, as he was afraid that he might fall into the hands of\r\none of the numerous military parties, who were dispersed over the\r\nisland. “Why, Macleod, (replied Charles,) I now throw myself entirely\r\ninto your hands, and leave you to do with me what you please;\r\nonly I want to go to Strath, Mackinnon’s country. I hope you will\r\naccompany me, if you think you can lead me safe enough into Strath.”\r\nMalcolm declared that he would go with his royal highness wherever\r\nhe pleased, and offered to bring him safe into that part of Skye\r\nwhich belonged to the chief of Mackinnon, provided he would consent\r\nto go by sea; but Macleod objected to a journey over land which he\r\nconsidered would be attended with dangers from the soldiers. Charles,\r\nhowever, insisted on going by land, and observed that they could now\r\ndo nothing without danger. The better to prevent a discovery, Charles\r\nproposed that he should act the part of Macleod’s servant, and that\r\nhe should assume the name of Lewis Caw, there being at the time a\r\nyoung surgeon of that name, who had been in the prince’s service,\r\nskulking in Skye, where he had some relations. Observing that his\r\nscarlet tartan waistcoat with gold twist buttons, was finer than\r\nthat worn by Macleod, which was of plain ordinary tartan, Charles\r\nexchanged it for Macleod’s. Then taking the bag which contained his\r\nlinen out of Malcolm’s hands, Charles threw it over his shoulder, and\r\nset out on his perilous journey, preceded by the faithful Malcolm,\r\nwho, to complete the deception, had proposed that Charles should keep\r\nup his new character of a gilly, or footman, by walking in the rear.\r\n\r\nStrath, the country of the Mackinnons, was at a considerable\r\ndistance, and the route to it which these two travellers took lay\r\nthrough one of the wildest and most mountainous districts of the\r\nisland. Though a good pedestrian, Malcolm could scarcely keep his\r\ndistance ahead of Charles, whose locomotive powers were surprising,\r\nthere being few persons who could match him at walking. Alluding to\r\nhis celerity of foot, he told Malcolm that provided he got out of\r\nmusket-shot, he had no dread of a pursuit by English soldiers, but he\r\nhad not the same confidence if chased by a party of Highland militia.\r\nHe asked Malcolm what they would do in the event of meeting any\r\nperson among the mountains, who might attempt to kill or take them.\r\n“That depends upon their numbers,” replied Malcolm; “if there should\r\nbe no more than four of them, I’ll engage to manage two.” “And I,”\r\nrejoined Charles, “will engage to manage the other two.” Malcolm, in\r\nhis turn, asked Charles what they should do if attacked by a party of\r\nEnglish soldiers, “Fight, to be sure,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nAs Malcolm expected that they would fall in with some of the country\r\npeople before they came to the end of their journey, by whom, from\r\nhis being well known in the island, he might be recognised, he\r\ndesired Charles not to evince any anxiety when he (Malcolm) should\r\nspeak to them, but remove to a short distance and sit down till the\r\nconversation ended. They met a few of these people from time to\r\ntime, on which occasion Charles not only observed the injunction of\r\nMalcolm, but superadded the customary menial duty, of touching his\r\nbonnet when addressed by his supposed master. With the exception of\r\na bottle of brandy, the two travellers appear to have had no other\r\nsustenance during their long and fatiguing journey. When reduced to\r\na single glass, Charles urged Malcolm to take it, lest he should\r\nfaint with the excessive fatigue. Malcolm refused, and insisted that\r\nthe prince himself should drink it, but Charles resolutely refused,\r\nand compelled Malcolm to drain the bottle. Malcolm then hid the\r\nbottle in a thick bush of heath, where he found it about three years\r\nthereafter. Honest Macleod long preserved it “as a curious piece,”\r\nwhich he expected would one day make a figure in Westminster.[1265]\r\n\r\nWhen opportunity offered, the prince and Malcolm relieved the\r\ntediousness of the journey, by conversing on a variety of topics.\r\nThe conversation happening to turn upon Lord George Murray, Charles\r\nobserved that his lordship, whether from ignorance or with a view to\r\nbetray him, he would not say, misconducted himself in not obeying\r\norders, and that in particular, for two or three days before the\r\nbattle of Culloden, Lord George scarcely did anything he desired\r\nhim to do. When Malcolm told him of the many atrocities committed\r\nafter that battle, he appeared amazed, and said, “Surely that man\r\nwho calls himself the duke, and pretends to be so great a general,\r\ncannot be guilty of such cruelties. I cannot believe it.” Talking of\r\nthe fatigues he was obliged to undergo, the prince said, “Do you not\r\nthink, Macleod, that God Almighty has made this person of mine for\r\ndoing some good yet? When I was in Italy, and dining at the king’s\r\n(his father’s) table, very often the sweat would have been coming\r\nthrough my coat with the heat of the climate, and now that I am in\r\na cold country, where the climate is more trying, and exposed to\r\ndifferent kinds of fatigues, I really find I agree equally with both.\r\nI have had (pointing to his kilt) this philibeg on now for some days,\r\nand I find I do as well with it as any of the best breeches I ever\r\nput on. I hope in God, Macleod, to walk the streets of London with it\r\nyet.”[1266] A man holding such sentiments as these was not likely to\r\nbe easily discouraged.\r\n\r\nWhen approaching Mackinnon’s bounds, Malcolm stated to the prince\r\nhis apprehensions, that, disguised as he was, he was afraid he would\r\nstill be recognised by some of Mackinnon’s people, who had been out\r\nin his service. He, therefore, suggested that Charles should disguise\r\nhimself still further. The prince then proposed to blacken his face\r\nwith powder; but Macleod objected to this plan, which, he said,\r\nwould tend rather to discover than to conceal him. “Then,” observed\r\nCharles, “I must be put into the greatest dishabille possible;” and\r\npulling off his wig, and putting it into his pocket, took out a dirty\r\nwhite napkin, which Malcolm, at his desire, tied about his head close\r\nto his eyebrows. He then put off his bonnet, tore the ruffles from\r\nhis shirt, and took the buckles out of his shoes, and made Macleod\r\nfasten them with strings. Charles now asked his friend if he thought\r\nhe would still be recognised, and on Malcolm answering that he\r\nthought he would, Charles said, “I have so odd a face, that no man\r\nthat ever saw me once but would know me again.” In Malcolm’s opinion,\r\nCharles, though almost a Proteus, could never disguise his majestic\r\nmien and carriage; and he declared that there was not a person who\r\nknew what the air of a noble or great man was, that would not, upon\r\nseeing the prince, however disguised he might be, at once perceive\r\nsomething about him that was not ordinary,--something of the stately\r\nand grand.[1267]\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far after this conversation, when Malcolm Macleod’s\r\nopinion was verified, for no sooner had the travellers entered\r\nStrath, than Charles was recognised by two men of Mackinnon’s clan,\r\nwho had been out in the insurrection. They stared at the prince for\r\na little, and on discovering him, lifted up their hands and wept\r\nbitterly. Malcolm begged that they would compose themselves, lest\r\nby showing so much concern they might discover the prince. After\r\ncautioning them not to mention the meeting to any one, he swore them\r\nto secrecy upon his naked dirk, and then dismissed them. They kept\r\ntheir word.\r\n\r\nBeing within two miles of the laird of Mackinnon’s house, Malcolm\r\nasked him if he wished to see the old chief; “No,” said Charles,\r\n“by no means. I know Mackinnon to be as good and as honest a man as\r\nany in the world; but he is not fit for my purpose at present. You\r\nmust conduct me to some other house, but let it be a gentleman’s\r\nhouse.” They then proceeded, at Malcolm’s suggestion, to a place\r\ncalled Ellagol, or rather Ellighiul, near Kilvory or Kilmaree, where\r\nthey arrived in the morning after a journey of twenty-four Highland\r\nmiles, being upwards of thirty English miles. At Ellagol there lived\r\none John Mackinnon, who had served as captain under the laird of\r\nMackinnon, and had married a sister of Malcolm. Being desirous to\r\nascertain the state of matters in the neighbourhood before conducting\r\nCharles into the house of his brother-in-law, Malcolm left the prince\r\nat a little distance from the house, and went forward to make the\r\nnecessary inquiries. He found that Mackinnon was from home; and\r\non informing his sister that he had come to stay a short time at\r\nEllagol, if he could do so with safety, she assured him that he would\r\nbe perfectly safe, as there were no military people about the place,\r\nand that he was very welcome. Malcolm then told her that he had\r\nnobody along with him but one Lewis Caw, son of Mr. Caw, a surgeon in\r\nCrieff, whom, being a fugitive like himself, he had engaged as his\r\nservant, but that he had fallen sick. Mrs. Mackinnon felt interested\r\nin the stranger, and requested her brother to bring him in.\r\n\r\nCharles accordingly entered with the baggage on his back, and,\r\ntaking off his bonnet, made a low bow, and sat down at a distance\r\nfrom Malcolm. Mrs. Mackinnon looked at the prince, and instantly her\r\nsympathy was excited. “Poor man!” she exclaimed, “I pity him. At the\r\nsame time, my heart warms to a man of his appearance.” Malcolm having\r\ntold his sister that he was almost famishing with hunger, she set\r\nbefore him a plentiful Highland breakfast. Charles still sitting at a\r\nrespectful distance, Malcolm invited him, as there were no strangers\r\nin the house, to draw near and share with him, there being abundance\r\nfor both. Charles appeared very backward to obey the summons to eat,\r\nand said that though in an humble station, he knew better how to\r\nconduct himself than by sitting at the same table with his master;\r\nbut Malcolm pretended to insist upon compliance, Charles rose from\r\nhis seat, made a profound bow, and advancing towards the table, sat\r\ndown, and attacked the viands without farther ceremony.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their journey, Charles and his companion had fallen\r\ninto a bog during the night, and as their feet and legs were still\r\ndirty, Malcolm desired the servant-maid in Gaelic, as she could not\r\nspeak English, to bring some water into the room, and as he was much\r\nfatigued, to wash them. Whilst in the act of washing Macleod’s feet,\r\nhe said to the girl, “You see that poor sick man there. I hope you’ll\r\nwash his feet too: it will be a great charity; for he has as much\r\nneed as I have.” “No such thing,” said she, “although I wash the\r\nmaster’s feet, I am not obliged to wash the servant’s. What! he’s\r\nbut a low country woman’s son. I will not wash his feet indeed.”\r\nMalcolm, however, with much entreaty, prevailed upon the girl to wash\r\nCharles’s feet and legs; but being rather rough in her treatment, he\r\nimplored Malcolm to desire her not to rub so hard.[1268]\r\n\r\nAfter this operation the wearied travellers went to bed; and at the\r\ndesire of Malcolm, Mrs. Mackinnon went out of the house, and sat down\r\nupon a neighbouring knoll, where she kept watch, whilst her guests\r\nremained in bed. Charles, who had thrown himself upon the bed in his\r\nclothes, slept two hours only; but Malcolm slept much longer. When\r\nMalcolm awoke, he was surprised to find Charles out of bed dandling\r\nMrs. Mackinnon’s child, singing to it, and appearing as alert as if\r\nhe had been in bed all night. He expressed a hope that the little\r\nboy--Neil Mackinnon--whom he carried in his arms, would be one day a\r\ncaptain in his service.\r\n\r\nInformed that his brother-in-law was seen approaching the house,\r\nMalcolm went out to meet him. After the usual salutations, Malcolm,\r\npointing to some ships of war that were hovering about the coast,\r\nsaid to Mackinnon, “What if the prince be on board one of them?” “God\r\nforbid,” replied Mackinnon, “I would not wish that for anything.”\r\n“What,” said Malcolm, “if he were here, John? Do you think he would\r\nbe safe enough?” “I wish we had him here,” rejoined Mackinnon,\r\n“for he would be safe enough.” Macleod, now fully assured that his\r\nbrother-in-law might be confided in, said, “Well, then, he is now\r\nin your house.” Mackinnon, transported with joy, was for running\r\ndirectly in and paying his obeisance to the prince; but Malcolm\r\nstopped him for a little, till he should recover from his surprise.\r\n“When you go in,” continued Malcolm, “you must not take any notice\r\nof him, lest the servants or others observe you. He passes for one\r\nLewis Caw, my servant.” Mackinnon promised to observe faithfully the\r\ninjunction given him, which he thought he would be able to fulfil;\r\nbut, as soon as he entered the house, he could not avoid fixing\r\nhis eyes upon Charles; and unable to repress his feelings at the\r\nspectacle he beheld, this generous and faithful Highlander, turning\r\nhis face aside, burst into tears. To prevent suspicion, Mackinnon, at\r\nMalcolm’s desire, left the room to compose himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACKINNON. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nBefore being introduced to the prince, Mackinnon sent away all\r\nhis servants from the house on different messages, and, during\r\ntheir absence, a consultation was held as to Charles’s future\r\ndestination. It was then resolved that he should proceed to the\r\nmainland immediately; and John Mackinnon was directed to go and hire\r\na boat, as if for the sole use of his brother-in-law. As the laird\r\nof Mackinnon was old and infirm, and could be of little service to\r\nCharles in his present situation, Mackinnon was enjoined not to say\r\nanything about Charles to his chief, should he fall in with him.\r\nMeeting the old chieftain, however, on his way, Mackinnon, unable or\r\nunwilling to conceal the fact of the prince’s arrival at Ellagol,\r\ndisclosed the secret, and mentioned that he was going to hire a boat\r\nto carry Charles to the mainland. Gratified with the intelligence,\r\nthe chief desired his clansman not to give himself any further\r\ntrouble about a boat, as he would provide a good one himself, and\r\nwould wait upon the prince immediately. John returned to Ellagol, and\r\nhaving informed Charles of the interview with the laird, the latter\r\nsaid that he was sorry that Mackinnon had divulged the secret; but\r\nas there was now no help for it, he would comport himself according\r\nto circumstances. In a short time the aged chief appeared, and\r\nafter doing homage to the royal wanderer, conducted the prince to a\r\nneighbouring cave, where he found Lady Mackinnon, who had laid out a\r\nrefreshment of cold meat and wine, of which the whole party partook.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of the chief, Malcolm Macleod had represented\r\nto the prince, that, being within the laird’s bounds, it would be\r\nnecessary to allow him to direct everything in relation to the\r\nvoyage, and, to prevent a difference of opinion arising between\r\nhim and the chief, he suggested the propriety of remaining behind.\r\nCharles, extremely unwilling to part with one who had rendered him\r\nsuch important services, insisted upon his going along with him\r\nto the mainland; but Malcolm insisting on the other hand that the\r\nmeasure was proper, Charles, with much reluctance, consented to part\r\nwith the faithful Macleod.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock at night the party left the cave, and proceeded\r\ntowards the place where the boat lay. In their way they observed two\r\nEnglish men-of-war standing in for the island, before the wind, under\r\na press of sail. Malcolm thereupon entreated the prince to defer his\r\nvoyage till such time, at least, as these vessels should take another\r\ncourse, more particularly as the wind was against him; but Charles\r\ndisregarded the admonition, and observed, that after so many escapes,\r\nhe had no apprehensions of being caught at that time; that Providence\r\nwould still take care of him; and that he had no doubt of obtaining\r\na favourable wind immediately. Recollecting his sham appointment with\r\nMurdoch Macleod, for not keeping which Malcolm promised to make his\r\napology, Charles thought the least thing he could do was to notify\r\nhis departure, which he accordingly did, by writing him a short note,\r\ndelivering it to Malcolm.[1269] He then desired Malcolm to light\r\nhis pipe, as he wished to enjoy a smoke with him before parting.\r\nSnapping his gun, Malcolm, by means of the flash in the pan, lighted\r\nsome tow which he held at the mouth of the pipe whilst Charles blew\r\nit. As the pipe was extremely short, Charles’s cheek was scorched\r\nwith the blaze of the tow. At parting, Charles presented him with a\r\nsilver stock-buckle, and then embracing Malcolm in his arms, saluted\r\nhim twice, and begging God to bless him, put ten guineas into his\r\nhand. Malcolm at first positively refused to accept the money, as he\r\nperceived that the prince’s purse was much exhausted; but Charles\r\ninsisted upon his taking it, and assuring him that he would get\r\nenough for all his wants upon the mainland, Malcolm yielded. Having\r\nprocured a better pipe, Charles presented the one with which he had\r\nbeen smoking to Malcolm, who preserved it with great care.[1270]\r\n\r\nBetween eight and nine o’clock in the evening of Friday, the 4th of\r\nJuly, the prince departed for the mainland, accompanied by the chief\r\nand John Mackinnon. The observation of Charles, that he would obtain\r\na fair wind after putting to sea, had made a deep impression upon\r\nthe superstitious mind of the generous Malcolm, who accordingly sat\r\ndown upon the side of a hill to watch the expected change, which,\r\naccording to him, took place very soon, for the crew had not rowed\r\nthe boat half a mile from the shore in the direction of the ships,\r\nbefore the wind chopped about, and whilst it favoured the prince,\r\ndrove the men-of-war out of sight.[1271]\r\n\r\nAfter a rough voyage, the party reached a place called Little Mallag\r\nor Malleck, on the south side of Loch Nevis between Morar and\r\nKnoydart, distant about thirty miles from the place where they had\r\nembarked. At sea they met a boat, containing some armed militia.\r\nNo attempt was made to board, and a few words were exchanged in\r\npassing. Charles’s visit to Skye soon became public, and the fact of\r\nhis having been harboured and protected by certain persons in that\r\nisland could not be disguised. Malcolm Macleod’s connexion with the\r\nprince being reported, he was apprehended a few days after Charles’s\r\ndeparture for the mainland, put on board a ship, and conveyed to\r\nLondon, where he remained a prisoner till the 1st of July, 1747, when\r\nhe was discharged without being asked a single question. Kingsburgh\r\nalso was taken up and conveyed to Fort Augustus, where, after being\r\nplundered of his shoe-buckles, garters, watch, and money, he was\r\nthrown into a dungeon, and loaded with irons. He was discharged by\r\nmistake for another person of the same name, but was brought back,\r\nand afterwards conveyed to Edinburgh, and committed to the castle, in\r\nwhich he remained till the 4th of July, in the same year.\r\n\r\nFlora Macdonald was also apprehended about the same time by a party\r\nof militia, while on her way to the house of Donald Macdonald of\r\nCastleton in Skye, who had sent her notice that Macleod of Talisker,\r\nan officer of an independent company, had requested him to send for\r\nher. She was put on board the Furnace Bomb, and afterwards removed\r\nto Commodore Smith’s sloop, and treated with great kindness and\r\nattention by him and General Campbell. She was confined a short\r\ntime in Dunstaffnage castle. After being conveyed from place to\r\nplace, she was put on board the Royal Sovereign, lying at the Nore,\r\non the 28th of November, and carried up to London on the 6th of\r\nDecember following, where she remained in confinement till July\r\nin the following year, when she was discharged, at the especial\r\nrequest--according to the tradition of her family--of Frederick,\r\nPrince of Wales, father of George III., without a single question\r\nhaving been put to her. After her liberation, Miss Macdonald was\r\ninvited to the house of Lady Primrose, a zealous Jacobite lady, where\r\nshe was visited by a number of distinguished persons, who loaded her\r\nwith presents. She and Malcolm Macleod returned to Scotland together\r\nin a post-chaise provided by Lady Primrose, and, on their way, paid\r\na visit to Dr. Burton at York, who had been previously liberated\r\nfrom jail. This gentleman having asked Malcolm his opinion of the\r\nprince, the trusty Highlander replied, that “he was the most cautious\r\nman he ever saw, not to be a coward, and the bravest, not to be\r\nrash.” Few persons, now-a-days, will be disposed to concur in this\r\neulogium, for though personally brave, Charles was extremely rash and\r\ninconsiderate.[1272]\r\n\r\nAs parties of the military were known to be stationed at a short\r\ndistance from the place where Charles and his party landed, they\r\nwere afraid to leave it, and slept three nights in the open air on\r\nthe banks of Loch Nevis. On the fourth day the old laird and one\r\nof the boatmen ventured a little way into the country in quest of\r\na place of concealment; and the prince, along with John Mackinnon\r\nand the other three boatmen, proceeded up the loch close to the\r\nshore. In turning a point, they unexpectedly came upon a boat tied\r\nto a rock, and so near as to touch her with their oars. This boat\r\nbelonged to a militia party who were seen standing on the shore, and\r\nwere at once recognised by their badge, which was a red cross on\r\ntheir bonnets. This party immediately hailed the boat, and demanded\r\nto know whence they came. The boatmen answered that they were from\r\nSleat. The militiamen then ordered the boat to come ashore; but the\r\nboatmen continuing to row, the military jumped into their boat and\r\ngave chase. Charles, who lay in the bottom of the boat with John\r\nMackinnon’s plaid spread over him, wished to get up and attempt to\r\nescape by jumping ashore, but Mackinnon would not allow him, as\r\nhe considered the experiment very dangerous. During the pursuit,\r\nCharles, who was anxious to know the relative progress of the two\r\nboats, kept up a conversation with the trusty Highlander, who\r\nassured him from time to time that the pursuers did not gain upon\r\nthem. Both parties were equal in point of numbers; and as Mackinnon\r\ncontemplated the possibility of the militiamen overtaking them, he\r\ndirected the boatmen to keep their muskets close by them, but not\r\nto fire till he should give the word of command by firing first.\r\n“Be sure, (said John,) to take an aim. Mark well, and there is no\r\nfear. We will be able to manage these rogues, if we come to engage\r\nthem.” Charles, begging that no lives might be sacrificed without\r\nan absolute necessity, Mackinnon said he would not fire if it could\r\nbe avoided; but if compelled to do so in self-defence, their own\r\npreservation required that none of the assailants should escape to\r\ntell the news of their disaster. Observing a wood at some distance\r\nwhich reached down to the water, Mackinnon directed the boatmen to\r\npull in that direction; and on reaching the shore, the prince,\r\nfollowed by Mackinnon and one of the boatmen, sprang out of the boat,\r\nand plunging into the wood, nimbly ascended the hill. The alarm into\r\nwhich they had been thrown gave place to feelings of a very different\r\ndescription, when, on reaching the summit of the hill, they perceived\r\ntheir pursuers returning from their fruitless chase.[1273]\r\n\r\nFinding himself much fatigued, Charles slept three hours on this\r\neminence, and returning down the hill, crossed the loch to a small\r\nisland near the seat of Macdonald of Scothouse. Understanding that\r\nold Clanranald was there on a visit, Charles sent Mackinnon to\r\nsolicit his protection, but the old chief positively refused to\r\nreceive him. Upon Mackinnon’s return the party repassed the loch,\r\nand returned to Mallag, where they rejoined the old laird. After\r\nrefreshing themselves, they set out for the seat of Macdonald of\r\nMorar, about eight miles distant. In crossing the promontory between\r\nLoch Nevis and Loch Morar they passed a shieling, or cottage, where\r\nthey observed some people coming down towards the road. Afraid that\r\nhe would be known, the prince made John Mackinnon fold his plaid\r\nfor him, and threw it over his shoulder with his knapsack upon it.\r\nTo disguise himself still further, he tied a handkerchief about\r\nhis head. In this attire Charles passed for Mackinnon’s servant. A\r\ngrandson of Macdonald of Scothouse, who was at the shieling, gave the\r\nparty a draught of milk. At another shieling they procured another\r\ndraught; and, as the night was dark and the road bad, they took a\r\nguide along with them to conduct them across the ford to Morar’s\r\nhouse. When they came to this ford, an amusing occurrence took place.\r\nMackinnon, desirous to keep Charles dry in crossing, desired the\r\nguide to be so good as carry “this poor sick fellow,” (pointing to\r\nthe prince,) upon his back across the ford, as it was then pretty\r\ndeep; but the guide indignantly answered, “The deil be on the back he\r\ncomes, or any fellow of a servant like him; but I’ll take _you_ on\r\nmy back, Sir, if you please, and carry you safely through the ford.”\r\n“No, by no means,” said Mackinnon, “if the lad must wade, I’ll wade\r\nalong with him, and help him, lest any harm should happen to him;”\r\non saying which, he laid hold of Charles’s arm, and they crossed the\r\nford together. Both Charles and Mackinnon were pleased to find that\r\nthe guide had no suspicion that the pretended sick person was the\r\nprince.\r\n\r\nA little before day-break the party arrived at the end of their\r\njourney, but were disappointed to find that the mansion, where they\r\nexpected to meet with a hospitable reception, had been burnt to the\r\nground, and that its proprietor had been obliged to take up his abode\r\nin a bothy or hut in the neighbourhood. Morar, who had acted as\r\nlieutenant-colonel of Clanranald’s regiment, gave the prince a hearty\r\nwelcome. Having entertained Charles and his party, he conducted them\r\nto a cave for security, and went off in quest of young Clanranald,\r\nwhom the prince was most anxious to see. After some hours’ absence\r\nMorar returned, and, reporting that he could not find Clanranald,\r\nCharles told him that as he had failed in meeting with that young\r\nchief, he would put himself under Morar’s charge. According to\r\nMackinnon’s statement, Morar declined to take such a responsibility\r\nupon him, and even declared that he did not know any person to whose\r\ncare he could commit Charles’s person. The prince, stung by the\r\naltered demeanour of Morar, thus accosted him: “This is very hard.\r\nYou were very kind yesternight, Morar! and said you could find out\r\na hiding-place, proof against all the search of the enemy’s forces;\r\nand now you say you can do nothing at all for me! You can travel to\r\nno place but what I will travel to; no eatables or drinkables can you\r\ntake but what I can take a share along with you, and be well content\r\nwith them, and even pay handsomely for them. When fortune smiled\r\nupon me and I had pay to give, I then found some people ready enough\r\nto serve me; but now that fortune frowns on me, and I have no pay\r\nto give, they forsake me in my necessity.” The chief of Mackinnon\r\nand his clansman were highly indignant at Morar, and insisted that\r\nhe must have seen young Clanranald, and that he had been advised to\r\nhis present course, but Morar resolutely denied the charge. Charles\r\nin great distress exclaimed, “O God Almighty! look down upon my\r\ncircumstances, and pity me; for I am in a most melancholy situation.\r\nSome of those who joined me at first, and appeared to be fast\r\nfriends, now turn their backs upon me in my greatest need: and some\r\nof those again who refused to join me, and stood at a distance, are\r\nnow among my best friends; for it is remarkable that those of Sir\r\nAlexander Macdonald’s following have been most faithful to me in my\r\ndistress, and contributed greatly to my preservation.” Then turning\r\nround to Mackinnon, he said, “I hope, Mr. Mackinnon, you will not\r\ndesert me too, and leave me in the lurch; but that you will do all\r\nfor my preservation you can.” The old laird, thinking that these\r\nwords were meant for him, said, with tears in his eyes, “I never will\r\nleave your royal highness in the day of danger; but will, under God,\r\ndo all I can for you, and go with you wherever you order me.”--“Oh\r\nno!” rejoined Charles, “that is too much for one of your advanced\r\nyears, Sir; I heartily thank you for your readiness to take care of\r\nme, as I am well satisfied of your zeal for me and my cause; but one\r\nof your age cannot well hold out with the fatigues and dangers I must\r\nundergo. It was to your friend John here, a stout young man, I was\r\naddressing myself.”--“Well then,” said John, “with the help of God,\r\nI will go through the wide world with your royal highness, if you\r\ndesire me.”[1274]\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his inquiries after Clanranald, and unsuccessful, if\r\nJohn Mackinnon’s statement be correct, in his application to Morar,\r\nCharles resolved to go to Borodale, and solicit the assistance of\r\n“honest old Æneas Macdonald.” Accordingly, after taking leave of\r\nthe laird of Mackinnon, Charles set off for Borodale, accompanied\r\nby John Mackinnon, under the direction of a boy, a son of Morar,\r\nas guide. The party reached Borodale, on the morning of the 10th\r\nof July, before day-break. As was the case at Morar, the house of\r\nthe proprietor had been burnt by a body of troops, under Captain\r\nFerguson, and Borodale was residing in a hut hard by the ruins of his\r\nmansion. Borodale was in bed when Charles arrived, and the door was\r\nshut. Mackinnon called upon Borodale to rise, who, knowing his voice,\r\ngot up, and throwing some blankets about him, went to the door.\r\nMackinnon asked him if he had heard any thing of the prince. “No,”\r\nreplied the old gentleman. “What would you give,” rejoined John,\r\n“for a sight of him?” “Time was,” said the warm-hearted Highlander,\r\n“that I would have given a hearty bottle to see him safe; but since\r\nI see you I expect to hear some news of him.” “Well, then,” replied\r\nMackinnon, “I have brought him here, and will commit him to your\r\ncharge. I have done my duty, do you yours.” “I am glad of it,” said\r\nBorodale, “and shall not fail to take care of him: I shall lodge him\r\nso secure that all the forces in Britain shall not find him out.”\r\nJohn Mackinnon then took his leave, and returned to Ellagol; but he\r\nhad scarcely reached his house when he was apprehended by a party of\r\nmilitia, and along with his chief, who was also captured by another\r\nparty at Morar, the morning after Charles’s departure, conveyed to\r\nLondon, and kept in confinement till July, 1747.\r\n\r\nBorodale conducted his guest to a hut in a neighbouring wood, where\r\nhe entertained him in the best manner he could for three days,\r\nand in the meantime, Charles despatched John Macdonald, junior,\r\none of Borodale’s sons, with a letter to Alexander Macdonald of\r\nGlenaladale, who had been in his service as Major of the Clanranald\r\nregiment.[1275] Receiving, shortly after this express had been sent,\r\ninformation of the laird of Mackinnon’s capture, and judging that\r\nhis residence in the wood was not safe, Borodale, accompanied by his\r\nson Ronald, who had been a lieutenant in Clanranald’s own company,\r\nconducted Charles to an almost inaccessible cave four miles eastward,\r\nin which he directed him to remain till Glenaladale should arrive.\r\n\r\nCharles’s letter was punctually delivered to Glenaladale, who, two\r\ndays after it was written, viz. on the 15th of July, met Borodale at\r\nan appointed place, and paid a visit to Charles. Next day Borodale\r\nreceived a letter from his son-in-law, Angus Mac Eachan, residing\r\nin the glen of Morar, who had served as surgeon to Glengarry’s\r\nregiment, informing him that a rumour was beginning to prevail in\r\nthe country, that the prince was in concealment about Borodale;\r\nand representing the danger Charles would be in, by remaining on\r\nBorodale’s lands any longer, he offered him a more secure asylum,\r\nin a place he had prepared for him. Before accepting this offer,\r\nRonald Macdonald was sent to reconnoitre the place. Next day, John\r\nMacdonald was despatched to view the coast, and ascertain the motions\r\nof the military; and having brought intelligence that he saw a boat\r\napproaching that part of the coast where the grotto was situated,\r\nCharles, without waiting for the return of Ronald Macdonald,\r\nimmediately left the cave, and set off for the glen of Morar, to\r\nthe place prepared for him. He was accompanied by Glenaladale,\r\nBorodale, and John Macdonald junior, son of the latter. They were\r\nmet, at a place called Corrybeine Cabir, by Borodale’s son-in-law,\r\nwho informed Charles that Clanranald was waiting a few miles off, to\r\nconduct him to a safe place of concealment he had prepared for him.\r\nCharles would have proceeded to meet Clanranald, but as the evening\r\nwas far advanced, and as he was much nearer his intended quarters in\r\nGlen Morar than the place where Clanranald was, he proceeded onward,\r\nintending to communicate with him next day.\r\n\r\nBorodale, who had proceeded to Glen Morar in advance of the party to\r\nprocure some necessaries, received information, on his arrival there,\r\nthat some men-of-war with troops on board, under General Campbell,\r\nhad anchored in Loch Nevis. He thereupon despatched two men to Loch\r\nNevis, by way of Loch Morar, to observe General Campbell’s motions,\r\nand having received farther intelligence, that Captain Scott had\r\narrived with a party in the lower part of Arisaig, he returned to\r\nCharles, and communicated to him the information he had received.\r\nBeing assured that Charles was upon one of the promontories betwixt\r\nLoch Hourn and Loch Shiel, the English commanders had formed a chain\r\nof posts across the heads of these and the intermediate arms of the\r\nsea, so as to intercept him should he attempt to escape by land\r\ninto the interior; and to catch him, should he venture to return to\r\nthe islands, cruisers and boats were stationed at the mouths of the\r\nlochs. The sentinels along this line, which extended to the length of\r\nthirty miles, were placed so near one another in the day time, that\r\nno person could pass without being seen by them, and at night fires\r\nwere lighted at every post, and the opposite sentinels passed, and\r\nrepassed one another, from fire to fire. To cross such a chain during\r\nthe day was quite impossible, nor did a passage by night appear more\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nFinding thus, that Clanranald’s country was wholly surrounded by\r\nthe government troops, and that he would not be able to join that\r\nchief, Charles resolved to leave it immediately. To lessen the risk\r\nof discovery, by reducing the number of his companions, he took leave\r\nof Borodale and his son-in-law, and attended by Glenaladale, his\r\nbrother Lieutenant John Macdonald, who had been an officer in the\r\nFrench service, and John Macdonald junior, Borodale’s son, set out in\r\nthe morning of the 18th of July, and by mid-day reached the summit\r\nof a hill called Scoorvuy, at the eastern extremity of Arisaig. Here\r\nthey rested and took some refreshment, and Glenaladale’s brother was\r\nthen despatched to Glenfinnan, to obtain intelligence, and to direct\r\ntwo men whom Glenaladale had stationed there, to join the prince\r\nabout ten o’clock at night, on the top of a hill called Swernink\r\nCorrichan, above Loch Arkaig in Lochiel’s country. After Lieutenant\r\nJohn Macdonald’s departure, Charles set out with his two remaining\r\ncompanions, and at two o’clock came to the top of a neighbouring\r\nhill, called Fruigh-vein. Observing some cattle in motion,\r\nGlenaladale went forward to ascertain the cause, and found that\r\nthese cattle belonged to some of his own tenants, who were driving\r\nthem away out of the reach of a body of 600 or 700 troops, who had\r\ncome to the head of Loch Arkaig, to hem in the prince. As Charles\r\nand his friends meant to pass in that direction, they were greatly\r\ndisconcerted at this intelligence, and resolved to alter their\r\ncourse. Glenaladale sent one of his tenants to Glenfinnan, which was\r\nonly about a mile off, to recall his brother and the two men; and\r\nat the same time he sent another messenger for Donald Cameron of\r\nGlenpean, who had removed with his effects to a neighbouring hill,\r\non the approach of the troops, that he might ascertain from him\r\nthe situation of the troops about Fort Augustus, and to obtain his\r\nassistance in conducting the prince through the chain of posts. As\r\nthey waited the return of the messengers, one of the tenants’ wives,\r\nregretting the condition of Glenaladale her landlord, and desirous\r\nof giving him some refreshment milked some of her cows, and brought\r\nthe milk to him. Observing the woman approaching, Charles covered\r\nhis head with a handkerchief, and passed for one of Glenaladale’s\r\nservants, who had got a headach. Though this refreshment, from the\r\nexcessive heat of the day, was very seasonable, yet they would have\r\ngladly dispensed with the obtrusive kindness of the warm-hearted\r\nfemale. That Charles might participate in the present, without\r\nobservation from the donor, Glenaladale prevailed upon her, though\r\nwith some difficulty, to retire, and leave her dish behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a short absence the messenger who had been despatched to\r\nGlenfinnan returned without finding Glenaladale’s brother, or the two\r\nmen who had, before his arrival there, departed for the appointed\r\nplace of rendezvous. He brought the alarming intelligence, that a\r\nhundred of the Argyleshire militia had arrived at the foot of the\r\nhill on which the prince now stood. Without waiting for the return\r\nof the other messenger, the party set out about sunset on their\r\nhazardous attempt. They travelled at a pretty quick pace till about\r\neleven o’clock at night; when passing through a hollow way between\r\ntwo hills, they observed a man coming down one of them in their\r\ndirection. Charles and young Macdonald kept behind, and Glenaladale\r\nwent forward to ascertain whether this person was friend or foe.\r\nStrange to tell, the suspected individual was Donald Cameron of\r\nGlenpean, the very person whom, of all others, Glenaladale wished to\r\nsee. He was immediately conducted to Charles, to whom he communicated\r\nsuch information as he had obtained about the government troops.\r\n\r\nUndertaking to guide the prince and his companions past the guards,\r\nCameron conducted them over roads almost impassable in day-light; and\r\nafter travelling all night, they arrived about four o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the 19th of July, on the top of a hill in the braes of\r\nLoch Arkaig, called Mamnyn-Callum, from which they could perceive the\r\nenemy’s camp about a mile distant. Being informed by their guide,\r\nthat the hill on which they now stood had been searched the previous\r\nday, they supposed there would not be a second search for some time,\r\nand they therefore resolved to remain on the hill all the day. They\r\nlay down to rest, and after sleeping two hours, the whole party, with\r\nthe exception of Charles, rose to keep watch. About ten o’clock they\r\nobserved a man at a little distance coming up the hill. As there\r\nwas a probability that Cameron, being generally acquainted with the\r\ninhabitants of that part of the country, might know this person, he\r\nwas sent forward to speak with him, and was agreeably surprised to\r\nfind that he was no other than Glenaladale’s brother, who not meeting\r\nthe prince at the place appointed, had become alarmed for his safety,\r\nand was in search of him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Arkaig.--Achnacarry, seat of Cameron of Lochiel,\r\nin middle distance.]\r\n\r\nThe whole party remained on the top of the hill all the day, and\r\nabout nine o’clock at night set out in a southern direction. About\r\none o’clock in the morning they came to a place called Corrinangaull,\r\non the confines of Knoydart and Loch Arkaig, where Cameron expected\r\nto have met some of the Loch Arkaig people, who had fled with their\r\ncattle on the approach of the soldiery. Cameron had calculated on\r\ngetting a supply of provisions from these people, as the prince and\r\nhis party had only a small quantity of butter and oatmeal, which they\r\ncould not prepare for want of fire. Perceiving some huts down the\r\nface of the hill, Glenaladale’s brother and the guide, at the risk of\r\nbeing observed by some of the sentinels who were going their rounds,\r\nventured down to them, in expectation of meeting some of the country\r\npeople, and obtaining a supply of provisions; but they found these\r\nshielings uninhabited. Judging themselves no longer safe on the top\r\nof the hill, the whole party shifted their quarters, and went to a\r\nfastness in the brow of a hill at the head of Lochnaigh, about a mile\r\ndistant from the troops. They lay down in this retreat to take some\r\nrest. With the exception of Charles, they all awoke after a short\r\nrepose; and it was resolved that, dangerous as the experiment might\r\nbe, Glenaladale’s brother and the guide should again go in quest of\r\nprovisions, of which they now stood in very great need. Leaving,\r\ntherefore, Glenaladale, and Borodale’s son to stand sentry over\r\nCharles, they set off, while it was yet dark, on their errand. The\r\nplace which the weary wanderers had chosen for their nocturnal abode\r\ncommanded a view of the lake, and when the sun rose, Charles and his\r\nfriends observed the enemy’s camp at the head of Lochnaigh. They\r\nwould have gladly removed to a greater distance, but they resolved to\r\nwait for the return of the foraging party, who arrived about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon, with two small cheeses, which were all\r\nthe provisions they could procure. They also brought the alarming\r\nintelligence, that about a hundred soldiers were marching up the\r\nopposite side of the hill to search for some of the country people,\r\nwho were supposed to have fled thither for shelter.\r\n\r\nAs it was not improbable that this party would in the course of\r\ntheir examination find out the place where Charles and his friends\r\nlay concealed, the most direful apprehensions must have seized the\r\nminds of the unhappy fugitives. Seeing no possibility of leaving\r\ntheir retreat without observation, whilst the soldiers were on the\r\nhill, they resolved to remain and abide the result. The soldiers\r\nmade a general and narrow search all around, but fortunately did not\r\ncome to the place where the wanderers lay. After the search was over\r\nthe soldiers returned to their camp; and about eight o’clock in the\r\nevening Charles and his friends left their place of concealment,\r\nand, travelling at a very quick pace till it became dark, ascended\r\na steep hill called Drimachosi, on arriving at the top of which,\r\nthey observed the fires of a camp directly in their front, which in\r\npassing onward they imagined they could scarcely avoid. Determined,\r\nhowever, to make the attempt, whatever might be the consequences,\r\nthey proceeded forward, and came so near the posts as to hear the\r\nsoldiers talking together.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the top of this mountain Charles made a very narrow\r\nescape. Down a steep and pathless descent a small stream glided, the\r\nwaters of which spreading among a mixture of grass and heath, with\r\nwhich the descent was covered, rendered it slippery, and of course\r\nvery dangerous. When about to descend, Charles’s foot slipped, and he\r\nwould have undoubtedly fallen headlong down the precipice, and been\r\ndashed to pieces, had not Cameron, who preceded him, seized him by\r\none of his arms, and held him fast with one hand, whilst, with the\r\nother, he laid hold of the heath to prevent both from tumbling down\r\ntogether. In this situation, Cameron held Charles till Glenaladale\r\ncame down, who, laying hold of the prince’s other arm, rescued him\r\nfrom his danger. Arriving at the bottom, they crept up the next hill,\r\nand, on reaching its summit, perceived the fires of another camp at\r\nthe foot of the hill, directly in the way they intended to go down.\r\n\r\nTo pass this post seemed to be an undertaking utterly hopeless, and\r\ncertain destruction appeared inevitable in the attempt; yet extremely\r\ndangerous as it was, the party resolved to make it. Unwilling,\r\nhowever, to expose the prince to such great risk, before putting\r\nthe practicability of the measure to the test, Cameron, entirely\r\nregardless of his own safety, proposed to make the experiment\r\nhimself before Charles ventured to pass. “If I succeed,” said the\r\ngenerous Highlander, “and return safe, then your royal highness\r\nmay venture, and I shall conduct you.” At this time Cameron’s nose\r\nbegan to itch,--a circumstance which was regarded by Donald as a\r\ndangerous omen. Whilst rubbing his nose, he could not avoid stating\r\nhis apprehensions to Charles; but these superstitious fears did\r\nnot divert him from his purpose. Cameron accordingly went forward,\r\nand, in a short time, returned to his companions with the agreeable\r\ninformation that he had entirely succeeded. No doubt now existing\r\nof the practicability and even the safety of the attempt, the\r\nwhole party set off about two o’clock in the morning. Turning a\r\nlittle westward, Cameron conducted them to the channel of a small\r\nbrook, through which they crept on their hands and feet to escape\r\nobservation; and watching their opportunity when the backs of the\r\nsentinels were turned towards one another, quietly passed between\r\nthem. After they were out of danger from the guards, Charles came up\r\nto Glenpean, and jocularly said to him, “Well, Donald, how does your\r\nnose do now?” “It is better now,” answered Cameron, “but it still\r\nyucks (itches) a little.” “Aye, Donald,” rejoined the prince, as if\r\ntaking the hint, “have we still more guards to go through?”\r\n\r\nHaving thus fortunately cleared the line of posts, the party\r\nproceeded in their course, and, at about the distance of two miles,\r\ncame to a place called Corriscorridill, on the Glenelg side of the\r\nhead of Loch Hourn, where they stopped, and, having chosen a secure\r\nplace, sat down and took some refreshment. They had no bread; but\r\nCharles supplied the deficiency by covering a slice of the dry cheese\r\nwith oatmeal. He partook of this coarse fare cheerfully, and washed\r\nit down with some water from a neighbouring spring. They remained in\r\nthis retreat till eight o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt being now evident that Charles could not remain with any chance\r\nof safety in the West Highlands, Glenaladale proposed, that instead\r\nof going eastward, as Charles intended, he should proceed north into\r\nRoss-shire, and seek an asylum among that part of the Mackenzies who\r\nhad not joined in the insurrection, and whose territory had not,\r\non that account, been visited by the military. Charles resolved to\r\nadopt the advice of his kind friend; and as Cameron was unacquainted\r\nwith the route, he and Glenaladale left the covert to look out for\r\na guide. Before they had gone far, however, they were astonished\r\nto find that they had passed all the day within cannon-shot of\r\ntwo little camps, and they perceived, at the same time, a company\r\nof soldiers driving some sheep into a hut, for the purpose, as\r\nthey supposed, of being slaughtered. Returning to their place of\r\nconcealment, they apprised Charles of their discovery; and as no\r\ntime was to be lost in providing for their safety, the whole party\r\nimmediately set off, and about three o’clock next morning, July the\r\n27th, reached Glenshiel, in the Earl of Seaforth’s country. As their\r\nsmall stock of provisions was exhausted, Glenaladale and Borodale’s\r\nson went forward in quest of a supply, and to find out a guide to\r\nconduct them to Pollew, where it was reported some French vessels\r\nhad been. Whilst Glenaladale was conversing with some country people\r\nabout a guide, a Glengarry man, who had been chased that morning\r\nby a party of soldiers from Glengarry, after they had killed his\r\nfather, came running up. This man, who had served in the prince’s\r\narmy, was recognised at once by Glenaladale, and as he knew him to\r\nbe trustworthy, he resolved to keep him in reserve as a guide, in\r\ncase they should be obliged to change their plan, and to remain\r\nabout Glengarry. Having procured some provisions, Glenaladale and\r\nhis companion returned to Charles, and after the whole party had\r\npartaken of the food, they retired to the face of an adjacent hill,\r\nand lay down to rest in a cave. They slept till between four and five\r\no’clock in the afternoon, when Cameron, who had acted so faithfully,\r\ntook his leave, as he was unacquainted with that part of the country.\r\nAfter Cameron’s departure, Glenaladale, observing the Glengarry man\r\nreturning to his own country, stepped out of the cave and prevailed\r\nupon him to remain in a by-place for a short time, as he said he had\r\nsomething to communicate to him. Glenaladale, on his return, stated\r\nhis plan to Charles, which was to keep the Glengarry man without\r\nexplaining to him any thing, till such time as he could ascertain\r\nwhether he could depend upon getting a guide to Pollew, failing\r\nwhich he would retain the Glengarry man. Charles approved of what\r\nGlenaladale had done. About seven o’clock, Glenaladale repaired to\r\na place where he had appointed a man, who had promised to procure\r\na guide, to meet him, and having found this person, was informed\r\nby him that he could not get one, and that the only French vessel\r\nthat had touched at Pollew had gone away. Glenaladale, therefore,\r\ndismissed this person, and returning to Charles, informed him of\r\nwhat had passed. They then gave up the idea of proceeding farther\r\ninto Ross-shire, and the Glengarry man, having been introduced to\r\nthe prince, cheerfully undertook to conduct him to Strathglass or\r\nGlenmoriston, to either of which districts he intended, according to\r\ncircumstances, to shape his course.[1276]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the whole party, accompanied by their new guide, set out\r\nthrough Glenshiel at a late hour; but they had not proceeded more\r\nthan half-a-mile, when Glenaladale stopped short, and, clapping his\r\nhand upon his side, declared that his purse, containing 40 guineas,\r\nwhich the prince had given him for defraying expenses, was gone.\r\nThinking that he had left it at their last resting place, Glenaladale\r\nproposed to go back in quest of it, and desired the prince to remain\r\nbehind an adjacent hill till he returned; but Charles was averse to\r\nthe proposal, though the purse contained his whole stock of money.\r\nGlenaladale, however, went back along with Borodale’s son, and,\r\non arriving at their last resting place, found the purse, but its\r\ncontents were gone. Recollecting that a little boy had been at the\r\nplace with a present of milk from a person whom Glenaladale had\r\nvisited, he supposed that the boy might have taken away the purse,\r\nand he and his companion proceeded to the house of Gilchrist M’Rath,\r\nthe person alluded to, and found the boy, who, as he had conjectured,\r\nhad stolen the purse of gold. By means of Gilchrist, the money was\r\nrestored to Glenaladale, with the exception of a trifle.\r\n\r\nThe temporary loss of the purse was a very fortunate occurrence\r\nfor Charles and his friends, as, during Glenaladale’s absence, an\r\nofficer and two privates passed close by the place where Charles\r\nstood, having come by the very road he and his party had intended\r\nto proceed. As they went in the direction taken by Glenaladale and\r\nhis companion, Charles grew very uneasy about his friends, lest they\r\nshould, on their return, meet with this party; but returning by a\r\ndifferent way, they rejoined the prince without interruption. Charles\r\nwas overjoyed at the return of his friend; and, with reference to his\r\nlate providential escape, observed, “Glenaladale, my hour, I see, is\r\nnot come; for I believe I should not be taken though I had a mind\r\nto it.” The party now continued their journey. In passing over the\r\nfield of Glenshiel, the Glengarry man entertained Charles with an\r\naccount of the action which happened there in 1719. Charles, it is\r\nsaid, could not help admiring the sagacity of his guide, who, though\r\nhe had not been in the battle, gave as circumstantial and accurate an\r\naccount of it as if he had been present.[1277]\r\n\r\nTravelling all night, Charles and his friends arrived on the side of\r\na hill above Strathchluaine, where, fixing upon a secure place of\r\nretreat, they reposed till near three o’clock in the afternoon of the\r\nfollowing day, viz., 28th of July. They then continued their journey\r\nalong the hill-side; but they had not travelled above a mile when\r\nthey heard the firing of small arms on the hill above them, which\r\nthey judged to proceed from some of the troops who were engaged in\r\ntheir usual occupation of shooting the people who had fled to the\r\nmountains with their cattle and effects. To avoid these bloodhounds\r\nthe party took a northern route, and ascended a high hill between\r\nthe Braes of Glenmoriston and Strathglass. They reached the summit\r\nof this mountain at a late hour, and sought repose for the night in\r\nan open cave, in which they could neither lie nor sleep. They had no\r\nfuel, and as they were wet to the skin with a heavy rain which fell\r\nduring the whole of the day, they passed a most uncomfortable night.\r\nCharles felt himself very cold, and he endeavoured to warm himself by\r\nsmoking a pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHISHOLM. (Tartan)]\r\n\r\nResolving again to go to Pollew, Glenaladale’s brother and the\r\nGlengarry man were despatched, about three o’clock in the morning\r\nof the 29th, in quest of some trusty persons to conduct the prince\r\nthither, and were appointed to meet Charles and the rest of the party\r\non the top of a neighbouring hill. Charles and his friends set off\r\nabout five o’clock, and, after a walk of two hours, reached the top\r\nof the appointed hill, where they met the guide, who stated that\r\nhe was directed by some proper persons he had found out, to desire\r\nGlenaladale to repair to a hill in the Braes of Glenmoriston, called\r\nCorambian, where they promised to come at an appointed hour with some\r\nvictuals. The persons alluded to were a party of seven men, who,\r\nhaving been engaged in the insurrection, had formed themselves into\r\na sort of predatory fraternity; intending, perhaps, to resume their\r\nformer habits of industry when the persecutions of the government\r\nceased. These had taken up their abode in a romantic cave on the side\r\nof Corambian, and seldom removed to any considerable distance from\r\ntheir rocky den, unless compelled by the necessity of providing for\r\ntheir immediate wants.\r\n\r\nAs directed, Charles and his friends proceeded to Corambian, and when\r\nthey came near the cave, Glenaladale and the guide went forward,\r\nleaving Charles and the other two Macdonalds at a little distance.\r\nAll the inmates of the den were present except one, and having killed\r\na sheep that day, had just sat down to dinner. Glenaladale said he\r\nwas glad to see them so well provided, and they invited him to sit\r\ndown and share with them. He then said he had a friend with him,\r\noutside, for whom he must beg the same favour. Being asked by them\r\nwho the friend was, he answered that it was young Clanranald, his\r\nchief. Nobody could be more welcome, they said, than the young chief;\r\nand they added, that they were willing to purchase food for him at\r\nthe point of their swords. Glenaladale then left the cave and brought\r\nin Charles, who, being immediately recognised by its residents, had\r\nevery respect shown him by these men, who fell on their knees before\r\nhim. It is almost unnecessary to add, that Charles, who had scarcely\r\ntasted food for forty-eight hours, made ample amends for his long\r\nfast. After dinner, Charles’s entertainers made up a bed for him of\r\nferns and tops of heath, on which he was soon lulled asleep by the\r\ngentle murmurs of a purling stream that ran through the grotto close\r\nto his bedside.\r\n\r\nThe dress which Charles wore at this time is thus described by Mr.\r\nHome, who obtained his information from Hugh Chisholm, one of the\r\nseven persons who were in the cave at the time Charles resided in\r\nit.[1278] Upon his head he had a wretched yellow wig and a bonnet,\r\nand about his neck a clouted handkerchief. He wore a coat of coarse,\r\ndark-coloured cloth, a Stirling tartan vest, much worn, a pretty good\r\nbelted plaid, tartan hose, and Highland brogues tied with thongs, so\r\nmuch worn that they would scarcely stick upon his feet. His shirt,\r\nthe only one he had, was of the colour of saffron. The inhabitants\r\nof the cave had no change of dress to offer their guest; but an\r\nincident occurred which enabled them to supply his wants. Hearing\r\nthat a detachment of government troops, under Lord George Sackville,\r\nwas marching from Fort-Augustus to Strathglass, and knowing that they\r\nmust pass at no great distance from their abode, the robbers resolved\r\nto make an attempt upon their baggage. For this purpose they placed\r\nthemselves between two hills, near the road to Strathglass, where,\r\nfree from observation, they awaited the detachment. It soon appeared,\r\nand after it had passed, the Highlanders fired at some officers’\r\nservants, who were a considerable distance behind, and, rushing down\r\nupon them, seized and carried off some portmanteaus, in which they\r\nfound every thing that Charles stood in need of.\r\n\r\nThe search for Charles, which had hitherto been pursued with the\r\nmost persevering assiduity, now began to slacken, in consequence\r\nof an occurrence, which, it was supposed, rendered farther search\r\nunnecessary. Among other persons who had joined Charles at Edinburgh,\r\nthere was a young man of respectable family, named Roderick\r\nMackenzie. He had served as one of the prince’s life-guards. Being\r\nabout the same age as Charles, tall and somewhat slender, like\r\nthe prince, and with features resembling, in some degree, those\r\nof Charles, he might, with ordinary observers, who had not been\r\naccustomed to see them together, have passed for the prince. As\r\nhe could not venture with safety to Edinburgh, where he had two\r\nmaiden sisters living, he fled to the Highlands after the battle of\r\nCulloden, and, while skulking among the hills of Glenmoriston, was\r\nsurprised by a party of soldiers, about the middle of July. Mackenzie\r\nendeavoured to escape; but being overtaken, he turned round upon his\r\npursuers, and, drawing his sword, bravely defended himself. He was\r\nshot by one of the soldiers, and as he fell, he exclaimed, “You have\r\nkilled your prince! you have killed your prince!” and immediately\r\nexpired. Overjoyed at their supposed good fortune, the soldiers cut\r\noff the young man’s head, and hurried to Fort-Augustus with their\r\nprize. The Duke of Cumberland, convinced that he had got the head\r\nof his relative, had it, it is said, packed up, and ordering a\r\npost-chaise, went off to London, carrying the head along with him.\r\nShortly after his arrival, however, the deception, which had been of\r\nessential service to Charles, was discovered.[1279]\r\n\r\nBeing pretty secure in Coiraghoth, as the cave was called, Charles\r\nremained three days in this retreat, during which he recruited so\r\nwell that he considered himself able to encounter any hardships.\r\nThe whole party then shifted their quarters to another hill, about\r\ntwo miles off, and took up their abode in another cave, on the\r\n2d of August. After staying four days in their new dwelling they\r\nwere again obliged to shift, in consequence of information they\r\nreceived, that one Campbell, a steward of Lord Seaforth and captain\r\nof militia, had pitched his camp at a little distance, to graze a\r\nlarge herd of cattle. Leaving one of their party behind to watch\r\nCampbell’s motions, they set off in a northerly direction, and\r\ntravelled to the heights of Strathglass. Charles was conducted to a\r\nsheep-cot, in which a bed was made up for him, consisting of turf,\r\nwith the grass-side uppermost, and a pillow of the same. He remained\r\nin this hovel three days, during which an express was sent to\r\nPollew, to ascertain whether a report which had reached him of some\r\nFrench vessels having been seen off the coast, was correct. On the\r\nsupposition that the report would turn out to be well founded, the\r\nparty followed the express, and crossing along the moor, put up at\r\nanother shieling for the night, and about twelve o’clock, next day,\r\nAugust the 10th, arrived at a place called Glencanna, and passing the\r\nday in a neighbouring wood, repaired at night to a village hard by.\r\nAbout two o’clock next morning they scrambled up a hill on the north\r\nside of Glencanna, and sending off two of their number to forage\r\nfor provisions, they waited two days in a neighbouring shieling for\r\nthe return of their messenger from Pollew. The express arrived, and\r\nbrought notice that a French ship had been upon the coast, and had\r\nlanded two gentlemen, who had gone to Lochiel’s country in quest\r\nof the prince. In expectation of meeting these gentlemen, Charles\r\nresolved to retrace his steps.\r\n\r\nUpon the 13th of August they crossed the water of Casina, and\r\npassing near the house of young Chisholm, arrived at a place called\r\nFassanacoil in Strathglass, about two o’clock in the morning.\r\nThey concealed themselves in a thick wood, and some of the party\r\nwere despatched as scouts to the Braes of Glengarry and Lochaber,\r\nto ascertain whether the search for the prince was over, and if\r\nthe troops had returned to their camp at Fort-Augustus. Having\r\nascertained on the return of their spies that the government troops\r\nhad returned to their head-quarters, the whole party left the wood,\r\nwhere they had remained three days, and, on the morning of the 17th\r\nof August, set out through an unfrequented road, and again reached\r\nthe Braes of Glenmoriston. Passing the day on the top of a hill,\r\nthey continued their journey at night; but they had gone scarcely a\r\nmile, when they received information that a strong party of military\r\nwere among the heights of Glengarry in quest of the prince. They,\r\ntherefore, stopped short in their journey till they should ascertain\r\nthe motions of the enemy, and passed the remainder of the night in a\r\nshieling.\r\n\r\nCharles being now extremely desirous of opening a communication\r\nwith his friends in Lochaber, which was by this time almost free\r\nfrom troops, despatched two messengers on the morning of the 18th\r\nof August to Loch Arkaig in quest of Cameron of Clunes, to inform\r\nhim that Glenaladale wished to meet him at a convenient place.\r\nAnother of the party was, at the same time, sent to the Braes of\r\nGlengarry to ascertain if the troops were still in that quarter.\r\nHaving ascertained, by the return of this messenger, who came\r\nback next day, that the roads were clear, Charles and his party,\r\nconsisting altogether of ten persons, set out in the afternoon of\r\nthe 19th, and passing under the favour of a fog through Glenmoriston\r\nand Glenlyne, arrived late at night in the Braes of Glengarry. The\r\nriver Garry was swollen to a great height by the heavy rains which\r\nhad fallen for some days; but some of the party having ascertained\r\nthat it was fordable, Charles and his friends waded across with the\r\nwater up to their middle. After passing the river, they proceeded\r\nonward about a mile in a very dark night, and finding no covert,\r\nremained on the side of the hill during the night, without shelter,\r\namid a torrent of rain. Next morning they continued their course\r\nover hills and moors till they reached a height near a place called\r\nAchnasalt, or Achnasual, where the messengers sent to Loch Arkaig\r\nhad been appointed to meet them. The rain having poured down without\r\nintermission all night and during the day, the situation of these\r\nforlorn wanderers had become very uncomfortable; and, to add to their\r\ndistress, their whole stock of provision was exhausted. As none of\r\nthe messengers had arrived, they were exceedingly perplexed what to\r\ndo; but they were soon relieved from their anxiety by the appearance\r\nof Peter Grant, one of the most active of the seven men, who brought\r\nnotice from Cameron of Clunes that he could not meet Glenaladale\r\nthat night, but that he would visit him at the appointed place of\r\nrendezvous next morning, and in the meantime directed him to pass\r\nthe night in a wood about two miles distant. Before setting out for\r\ntheir new quarters, of which they received a favourable report from\r\ntwo of the party, who were sent to examine the place, Glenaladale,\r\nwith the consent of the prince, sent a messenger to Lochgarry, who\r\nlay concealed a few miles off, acquainting him with their arrival\r\nat Achnasual, and requesting him to meet them in the wood. After\r\nentering the wood, fortune threw a buck in their way, which one of\r\nthe party immediately shot. Having kindled a fire, they roasted the\r\nflesh, and made a hearty meal, but without bread or salt. Lochgarry\r\njoined them the same night.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock next morning, August the 15th, Cameron of Clunes came\r\nto the wood, and conducted Charles to another forest at the foot of\r\nLoch Arkaig, in which he lay all night. With the exception of Hugh\r\nChisholm and Peter Grant, all the Glenmoriston men took their leave.\r\nCharles expressed a wish to go to Rannoch, or Badenoch, where Lochiel\r\nand Cluny were; but upon Clunes informing him that he could not pass\r\nwithout great danger, as all the ferries were strictly guarded, he\r\ngave up his design, and, early next morning, sent a messenger to\r\nLochiel, desiring his attendance. Concluding that Charles was to the\r\nnorth of the lakes, these chiefs had, about this period, sent Dr.\r\nCameron and the Rev. John Cameron by different routes, to obtain\r\ninformation respecting the prince. On arriving within a few miles of\r\nthe place where Lochiel was, Charles’s messenger met the Doctor and\r\nthe two French officers who had lately landed. As the messenger was\r\ndesired to communicate no information about Charles to any person\r\nbut Lochiel himself, he declined to answer any questions respecting\r\nthe prince; but having stated that he had business of the utmost\r\nimportance with Lochiel, the Doctor conducted him to his brother.\r\nLochiel being unable, from the state of his wounds, to travel to a\r\ndistance, then sent his brother to wait upon the prince, and to make\r\nhis apology.\r\n\r\nDr. Cameron, accompanied by two servants, arrived at the foot of Loch\r\nArkaig on the 19th of August, and when near the place of Charles’s\r\nconcealment, he met Cameron of Clunes. At this time Charles and one\r\nof Clunes’s sons were sleeping on the mountain, and Peter Grant was\r\nkeeping watch; but, nodding upon his post, Grant did not observe\r\nthe approach of the party till they were pretty near. He instantly\r\nawaked Charles and his companion. Cameron and Grant proposed that\r\nthey should flee to the top of the mountain, but Charles thought\r\ndifferently. He said he considered there was more danger in\r\nattempting to escape than in remaining where they were; and he\r\nproposed that they should take up a position behind some stones, take\r\naim, and fire upon the party when they came nearer. He said that,\r\nas Grant and he were good marksmen, they would certainly do some\r\nexecution, and that he had in reserve a brace of pocket pistols,\r\nwhich, for the first time, he produced. Fortunately, however, before\r\na single shot was fired, the person of Clunes was recognised among\r\nthe party. The joy of Charles and of young Cameron, at the narrow\r\nescape which the friends of the one and the father of the other had\r\nmade, may be easily conceived. When informed by Dr. Cameron that\r\nLochiel was well, and almost recovered of his wounds, the prince\r\nexpressed the unbounded satisfaction he felt by fervently returning\r\nthanks to God three times. The appearance of Charles at this time was\r\nsingular, and even terrific. He was bare-footed, and his beard had\r\ngrown to a great length. He wore a dirty shirt, an old black tartan\r\ncoat, a plaid, and a philibeg, carried a musket in his hand, and wore\r\na pistol and dirk by his side. Had he not had one of the best and\r\nsoundest constitutions ever enjoyed by a prince, he must ere this\r\nhave fallen a victim to the numerous privations he had suffered; but\r\nhis health remained unimpaired, and his flow of spirits continued.\r\nHis companions had killed a cow on the present occasion, and when\r\nDr. Cameron arrived a part of it was preparing for dinner. Charles\r\npartook heartily of the beef, which was seasoned by a supply of bread\r\nfrom Fort-Augustus, a commodity to which he had been for some time\r\nunaccustomed.\r\n\r\nNext day the party went to a wood called Torvuilt, opposite to\r\nAchnacarry, where they held a council. Charles now proposed to go\r\nsouth, and join Lochiel; but one of the party mentioning that he\r\nhad seen a paragraph in some newspapers, that had been brought\r\nfrom Fort-Augustus, which stated that he and Lochiel had passed\r\nCorryarrick with 30 men, he judged it advisable to defer his journey\r\nfor a few days, as a search might be made for him about that\r\nmountain. In the meantime it was agreed that Dr. Cameron should visit\r\nLochaber to procure intelligence, and that Lochgarry should go to\r\nthe east end of Loch Lochy, and remain upon the isthmus between the\r\nlakes, to watch the motions of the troops. They accordingly left\r\nCharles the same day, and Cameron and Clunes, after conducting the\r\nprince and his party to another hut in the neighbourhood, also took\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nCharles remained eight days in the neighbourhood of Achnacarry.\r\nHaving expressed a strong desire to see the French officers who\r\nhad landed at Pollew, they were brought to him. These gentlemen\r\nhad come from Dunkirk in a small vessel, with 60 others, who had\r\nformed themselves into a company of volunteers under these two\r\nofficers. Two of the volunteers landed along with the officers,\r\nand were taken prisoners. One of them, named Fitzgerald, a Spanish\r\nofficer, was hanged at Fort William, on the ground of having been a\r\nspy in Flanders, and the other, a M. de Berard, a French officer,\r\nwas afterwards exchanged upon the cartel. The officers fell in with\r\nMr. Alexander Macleod, one of Charles’s aides-de-camp, to whom\r\nthey delivered some despatches they had brought over to the French\r\nambassador, and they continued to wander in Seaforth’s country till\r\nLochgarry, hearing that they had letters to the prince, sent a\r\nCaptain Macraw and his own servant to find them out and bring them to\r\nLochiel, as the prince could not be found. When brought to Lochiel,\r\nhe suspected them to be government spies. On Charles expressing his\r\nwish to see these officers, the Rev. John Cameron, who had lately\r\njoined, told him what his brother Lochiel thought of them, and\r\nadvised him to act with great caution. The prince confessed that\r\nit appeared a very suspicious circumstance, that two men, without\r\nknowing a word of Gaelic, and being perfect strangers in the country,\r\nshould have escaped so long if they were not really spies; but as\r\nthey had told Lochiel that they had never seen the prince, he thought\r\nthat he might see them safely by a stratagem, without being known\r\nto them. He therefore wrote them a letter to this effect:--that, in\r\norder to avoid falling into his enemies’ hands, he had been under the\r\nnecessity of retiring to a distant part of the country, where he had\r\nno person with him except one Captain Drummond and a servant, and,\r\nas he could not remove from the place of his concealment without\r\ndanger, he had sent Captain Drummond with the letter; and as he\r\ncould repose entire confidence in him, he desired them to deliver\r\nany message they had to Drummond. This letter the prince proposed to\r\ndeliver himself, as Captain Drummond, and the officers being sent\r\nfor, were introduced to him under his assumed name. He delivered them\r\nthe letter, which they perused, and he then obtained from them all\r\nthe information they had to communicate, which, as his affairs then\r\nstood, was of little importance. They remained with him two days, and\r\nput many questions about the prince’s health, his manner of living,\r\n&c. Thinking the packet they had delivered to Mr. Macleod might be of\r\nuse, Charles sent for it; but as the letters were in cipher he could\r\nmake nothing of them, not having the key.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Charles made a very narrow escape, under the\r\nfollowing circumstances. Information having been sent to the camp\r\nat Fort-Augustus that Charles or some of his principal adherents\r\nwere in the neighbourhood of Loch Arkaig, a party was despatched\r\nin quest of them. One of Clunes’s sons and Cameron the minister\r\nhad gone to the strath of Clunes to obtain intelligence, and had\r\nentered a hut which Clunes had built for his family after his house\r\nhad been burnt. They had not, however, been half-an-hour within,\r\nwhen a little girl came running into the house, in great haste, and\r\nsaid that she saw some soldiers approaching. At first they thought\r\nthat the child was mistaken, as Lochgarry had promised to place a\r\nguard between Fort-Augustus and Clunes, to give intelligence of the\r\napproach of troops; but going out of the house, they found that the\r\ngirl was correct in her information. It was then about eight o’clock\r\nin the morning, and the prince, with one of Clunes’s sons and Peter\r\nGrant, was sleeping in a hut on the face of the hill on the other\r\nside of the water of Kaig, about a mile from Clunes’s hut. Whilst old\r\nCameron, therefore, remained to watch the motions of this party, one\r\nof his sons and the minister went off to arouse Charles. Crossing\r\nthe water under cover of the wood, they came within pistol-shot\r\nof the soldiers, who proceeded down into the strath. When awaked\r\nand informed of his danger, Charles, with great composure, called\r\nfor his gun, and, looking down the vale, saw a number of soldiers\r\ndemolishing Clunes’s hut and searching the adjacent woods.[1280]\r\nCharles and his attendants immediately resolved to remove to a\r\ndistance, and to conceal their flight, ascended the hill along the\r\nchannel of a torrent which the winter rains had worn in the face of\r\nthe mountain. Clearing this hill without being seen, they proceeded\r\nto another mountain, called Mullentagart, of a prodigious height, and\r\nvery steep and craggy. They remained all day on this hill without\r\na morsel of food. One of Clunes’s sons came to them about twelve\r\no’clock at night with some whisky, bread, and cheese, and told them\r\nthat his father would meet them at a certain place in the hills, at\r\na considerable distance, with provisions, and the young man returned\r\nto let his father know that he might expect them. Charles and his\r\nattendants set out for the appointed place at night, and travelled\r\nthrough most dreadful ways, amongst rocks and stumps of trees,\r\nwhich tore their clothes and limbs. Such were the difficulties they\r\nencountered, that the guides proposed to halt and rest till the\r\nmorning, but Charles, though exceedingly exhausted, insisted on going\r\non, that they might not break their appointment with Clunes. Worn\r\nout at last with fatigue and want of food, the prince was not able\r\nto proceed farther without assistance. Though almost in the same\r\nsituation themselves, the Highlanders offered him their aid, and two\r\nof them laying hold each of an arm, supported him till he arrived at\r\nthe end of this very laborious journey. They met Clunes and his son,\r\nwho had already killed a cow and dressed a part of it for their use.\r\n\r\nCharles remained in this remote place with his companions till the\r\narrival of Lochgarry and Dr. Cameron. They informed him that they had\r\nbeen with Lochiel and Cluny, and that it had been concerted among\r\nthem that the prince should come to their asylum for some time; and\r\nthey added, that Cluny would meet his Royal Highness at Auchnacarry,\r\non a certain day, in order to conduct him to Badenoch. Being also\r\ninformed by them that the passes were not so strictly guarded as\r\nformerly, Charles crossed Loch Arkaig, and took up his abode in a fir\r\nwood belonging to Lochiel, on the west side of the lake, to wait the\r\narrival of Cluny. Impatient to see two such tried friends as Lochiel\r\nand Cluny, Charles would not wait for Cluny’s coming to Auchnacarry,\r\nbut set out for Badenoch with such guides as he had. Next day\r\nCharles arrived at a place called Corinauir, in Badenoch, where he\r\npassed the night. Cluny had passed on to Auchnacarry the same day by\r\nanother way. Lochiel, who had skulked in his own country about two\r\nmonths, had sought an asylum among the Braes of Rannoch, where he was\r\nattended by Sir Stewart Thriepland, an Edinburgh physician, for the\r\ncure of the wounds he had received in his ancles. On the 20th of June\r\nthey fell in with Macpherson of Cluny, who conducted them to a more\r\nsecure retreat on Benalder, a hill of immense circumference, on his\r\nown property, on the borders of Rannoch. Lochiel, who had since that\r\ntime lived on this mountain with his friend Cluny, was now residing\r\nin a small miserable hovel on the side of the hill, at a place called\r\nMellenauir, or Millanuir, attended by Macpherson of Breakachie, Allan\r\nCameron, his principal servant, and two servants of Cluny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. Archibald Cameron, from rare print in the Burney\r\nCollection in British Museum.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th of August, Charles, accompanied by\r\nLochgarry, Dr. Cameron and two servants, set out for Mellenauir.\r\nThey were all armed, and on approaching the hut they were mistaken\r\nby Lochiel for a party of militia, who, he supposed, had been sent\r\nout in search of him from a camp a few miles off. From the lameness\r\nin his feet, Lochiel was not in a condition to attempt an escape,\r\nbut there seemed to be little danger, as both parties were equal in\r\npoint of numbers, and the party in the hut had this advantage, that\r\nthey could fire their first volley without being observed, and as\r\nthey had a considerable quantity of fire arms, they could discharge\r\nanother volley or two before the advancing party could reload their\r\npieces. The danger to which Charles and his friends were now exposed\r\nwas greater than that which Dr. Cameron and Clunes had run, as, on\r\nthe present occasion, the party in the hut, resolving to receive\r\ntheir supposed enemies with a general discharge of all the firearms,\r\nhad actually planted and levelled their pieces; but happily for\r\nCharles and his friends, they were recognised just as Lochiel and his\r\nattendants were about giving their fire. Upon making this fortunate\r\ndiscovery Lochiel left the hut, and, though very lame, went forward\r\nto meet the prince. On coming up to Charles, Lochiel was about to\r\nkneel, but Charles prevented him, and clapping him on the shoulder,\r\nsaid, “Oh no, my dear Lochiel, we do not know who may be looking\r\nfrom the top of yonder hills, and if they see any such motions they\r\nwill immediately conclude that I am here.” Charles always considered\r\nLochiel as one of his best friends, and placed the greatest\r\nconfidence in him; and the generous chief showed, by his unbounded\r\nattachment to the prince, that this confidence was not misplaced. The\r\nmeeting, therefore, of two such friends, after so many perils and\r\nescapes, was extremely joyous.\r\n\r\nAfter they had recovered from the first transports of their joy,\r\nLochiel conducted Charles into the hut, where the latter beheld a\r\nsight to which his eyes had not been accustomed for many months.\r\nBesides abundance of mutton, the hut contained an anchor of\r\nwhisky, of twenty Scotch pints, some good dried beef sausages, a\r\nlarge well-cured bacon ham, and plenty of butter and cheese. On\r\nentering the prince took a hearty dram, and drank to the health of\r\nhis friends. Some minced collops were then prepared for him with\r\nbutter in a large saucepan, which Lochiel and Cluny always carried\r\nabout with them, being the only fire-vessel they had. The pan was\r\nset before Charles with a silver spoon. He took this repast with\r\ngreat gusto, and was so delighted with this little change in his\r\ncircumstances, that he could not help exclaiming, with a cheerful\r\ncountenance, “Now, gentlemen, I live like a prince.” After dinner\r\nhe asked Lochiel if he had always fared so well during his retreat.\r\n“Yes, Sir,” answered Lochiel; “for near three months past I have been\r\nhereabout with my cousin Cluny; he has provided for me so well that\r\nI have had plenty of such as you see, and I thank Heaven your Royal\r\nHighness has got through so many dangers to take a part.” Finding,\r\non his arrival at Auchnacarry, that Charles had departed with his\r\nfriends for Badenoch, Cluny had retraced his steps, and he reached\r\nMellenauir two days after Charles’s arrival there. On entering the\r\nhut Cluny would have kneeled before Charles, but the prince prevented\r\nhim, and giving him a kiss, said, “I am sorry, Cluny, you and your\r\nregiment were not at Culloden: I did not hear till very lately that\r\nyou were so near us that day.”\r\n\r\nThe day after his return to Mellenauir, Cluny, thinking it time to\r\nremove to another retreat, conducted the prince and his attendants\r\nto a little shieling called Uiskchibra, about two miles farther into\r\nBenalder. This hut was very bad and extremely smoky; but Charles\r\naccommodated himself, as he had always done, to circumstances. After\r\npassing two nights in this miserable abode, he was conducted to a\r\nvery extraordinary and romantic habitation, called the Cage, which\r\nCluny had fitted up for Charles’s reception. From the description\r\ngiven by Cluny of this remarkable retreat, it will be seen how well\r\nadapted it was for the purpose of concealment.\r\n\r\n“It was,” says Donald Macpherson, “situated in the face of a very\r\nrough, high, and rocky mountain, called Letternilichk, still a part\r\nof Benalder, full of great stones and crevices, and some scattered\r\nwood interspersed. The habitation called the Cage, in the face of\r\nthat mountain, was within a small thick bush of wood. There were\r\nfirst some rows of trees laid down, in order to level a floor for the\r\nhabitation; and as the place was steep, this raised the lower side to\r\nan equal height with the other; and these trees, in the way of joists\r\nor planks, were levelled with earth and gravel. There were betwixt\r\nthe trees, growing naturally on their own roots, some stakes fixed in\r\nthe earth, which, with the trees, were interwoven with ropes, made\r\nof heath and birch twigs, up to the top of the Cage, it being of a\r\nround or rather oval shape; and the whole thatched and covered over\r\nwith fog. This whole fabric hung, as it were, by a large tree, which\r\nreclined from the one end all along the roof to the other, and which\r\ngave it the name of the Cage; and by chance there happened to be two\r\nstones at a small distance from one another, in the side next the\r\nprecipice, resembling the pillars of a chimney, where the fire was\r\nplaced. The smoke had its vent out here, all along the face of the\r\nrock, which was so much of the same colour, that one could discover\r\nno difference in the clearest day. The Cage was no larger than to\r\ncontain six or seven persons; four of whom were frequently employed\r\nplaying at cards, one idle looking out, one baking, and another\r\nfiring bread and cooking.”[1281]\r\n\r\nCharles’s deliverance was now nearer at hand than he or his friends\r\nprobably expected. Several small vessels had arrived on the west\r\ncoast, from time to time, to carry him off to France; but the\r\npersons in charge of these not being able to find him had returned\r\nhome. Charles knew this, and now that he was able to keep up a\r\ncommunication with his friends, he took care to provide against a\r\nsimilar recurrence. He was at a considerable distance from the coast,\r\nbut matters were so concerted that, if a French vessel appeared, he\r\ncould easily get the intelligence. There were some of his partizans\r\nskulking near the west coast, who, though they did not know where\r\nhe himself was, had instructions to convey the news to others who\r\nwere concealed in the interior, who would again communicate it to\r\npersons in the knowledge of the prince’s place of retreat. For some\r\ntime Colonel Warren, of Dillon’s regiment, had been exerting himself\r\nto induce the French government to fit out an expedition to rescue\r\nCharles from his toils. He at last succeeded in procuring two vessels\r\nof war, L’Heureux and La Princesse de Conti, with which he departed\r\nfrom St. Malo about the end of August. In the event of his bringing\r\nthe prince safe away, the Chevalier de St. George had promised to\r\nmake him a Knight Baronet, a dignity which he afterwards conferred\r\nupon him.[1282]\r\n\r\nThese vessels arrived in Lochnanuagh early in September, and Captain\r\nSheridan, a son of Sir Thomas Sheridan, and a Mr. O’Beirne, a\r\nlieutenant in the French service, immediately landed and waited upon\r\nGlenaladale, who, they were informed, knew where Charles was. This\r\nfaithful friend, happy at the prospect of escape which now offered,\r\nset off the same night for the place where he expected to find\r\nCharles, to communicate to him the agreeable intelligence; but to his\r\ngreat sorrow he found the prince gone, and he could fall in with no\r\nperson who could give him the least information of his route. Clunes,\r\nfrom whom Glenaladale expected to get tidings of Charles, had, in\r\nconsequence of the destruction of his hut, gone to another quarter,\r\nand was not to be found. Whilst ruminating over his disappointment,\r\na poor woman accidentally came to the place where he was, and he had\r\nthe good fortune to ascertain from her the place of Clunes’s retreat.\r\nHaving found him out, he and Clunes instantly despatched a messenger\r\nto Charles with the joyful intelligence; and Glenaladale then\r\nreturned to Lochnanuagh, to notify to Colonel Warren that Charles\r\nmight be speedily expected in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe messenger arrived at Benalder on the 13th of September, on which\r\nday Charles left his romantic abode, and, after taking leave of\r\nCluny, set off on his journey for the coast, accompanied by Lochiel\r\nand others. He at the same time sent off confidential messengers\r\nin different directions, to acquaint such of his friends as he\r\ncould reach, announcing the arrival of the ships, that they might\r\nhave an opportunity of joining him if inclined. As Charles and his\r\nfriends travelled only by night, they did not reach Borodale, the\r\nplace of embarkation, till the 19th. On the road Charles was joined\r\nby Lochgarry, John Roy Stewart, Dr. Cameron, and other gentlemen\r\nwho intended to accompany him to France. Besides these, many others\r\nhad left their different hiding places on hearing of the arrival of\r\nthe French vessels, and had repaired to the coast of Moidart, also\r\nwaiting for the arrival of him for whose sake they had forfeited\r\ntheir lives, intending to adopt the bitter alternative of bidding an\r\neternal adieu to their native land. The number of persons assembled\r\nwas about a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe career of Charles in the hereditary dominions of his ancestors\r\nwas now ended. Attended by seven persons only, he had, with daring\r\nhardihood, landed about fourteen months before on the spot where he\r\nwas destined to depart as a fugitive, and, with a handful of men, had\r\nraised the standard of insurrection and set the whole power of the\r\ngovernment at open defiance. The early part of his progress had been\r\nbrilliant. With a few thousand undisciplined mountaineers, he had\r\noverrun land, in the face of three hostile armies, had carried dismay\r\nto the capital. The retreat from Derby, the merit of which belongs to\r\nLord George Murray exclusively, quieted for a time the apprehensions\r\nof the government; but the defeat at Falkirk again convinced it that\r\nthe succession settlement was still in danger; and that, perhaps, at\r\nno distant day, the young and daring adventurer might place the son\r\nof James II. upon the throne from which his father had been expelled.\r\nEven after his retreat to Inverness, the supporters of the house of\r\nHanover could have no assurance that the Duke of Cumberland’s army\r\nmight not share the fate of its predecessors, in which event the\r\nnew dynasty would probably have ceased to reign; but the triumphs\r\nof Charles were at an end, and the fatal field of Culloden, after\r\nwitnessing the bravery of his troops, became the grave of his hopes.\r\nThen commenced that series of extraordinary adventures and wonderful\r\nescapes, of which some account has been given, and which could\r\nscarcely have been credited had they not been authenticated beyond\r\nthe possibility of dispute. During the brilliant part of his career\r\nCharles had displayed great moderation and forbearance; and though\r\nhis spirits sank when compelled to retreat, yet in the hour of\r\nadversity, when beset with perils and exposed to privations which few\r\nprinces could have endured, he exhibited uncommon fortitude, strength\r\nof mind, and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nIn his wanderings Charles laid down a rule to himself, to which\r\nhe scrupulously adhered, never to intrust any person from whom\r\nhe was about to depart with the secret of his route, so that,\r\nwith the exception of the few friends who were about him for the\r\ntime being, none of those to whom he had been formerly indebted\r\nfor his preservation knew the place of his retreat. This was a\r\nwise precaution, but was attended with this disadvantage, that it\r\nprevented him from acquiring early information of the arrival of the\r\nFrench vessels upon the coast. But no means he was able to take for\r\nhis own security could have saved him, had he not had a guarantee\r\nin the incorruptible fidelity of the persons into whose hands he\r\ncommitted himself. At the risk of their own destruction they extended\r\nto him the aid of their protection, and relieved his necessities.\r\nMany of these persons were of desperate fortunes, and there were\r\nothers in the lowest ranks of life; yet, among nearly 200 persons to\r\nwhom Charles must have been known during the five months he wandered\r\nas a fugitive, not one ever offered to betray him, though they knew\r\nthat a price of £30,000 was set upon his head. History nowhere\r\npresents such a splendid instance of disinterested attachment to an\r\nunfortunate family.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Lochiel, Lochgarry, John Roy Stewart, Dr. Cameron,\r\nand a considerable number of other adherents, Charles departed from\r\nLochnanuagh on the 20th of September, and had a favourable passage to\r\nthe coast of France, where he landed on Monday the 29th of September.\r\nHe immediately proceeded to Morlaix, whence he despatched Colonel\r\nWarren the same day to Paris, to announce his arrival to the French\r\ncourt. He also sent at the same time a letter to his brother Henry,\r\nto the same effect, and enclosed a similar one to his father.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1240] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p 541.\r\n\r\n[1241] Macleod’s Narrative in _Jacobite Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[1242] _Lockhart Papers_, vol. ii. p. 541. _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1243] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1244] Macleod’s Narrative.\r\n\r\n[1245] _Genuine and True Journal_, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[1246] O’Neil’s, Burke’s, and Macleod’s Narratives, in _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_. Macleod was taken prisoner a few days afterwards in\r\nBenbecula, by Lieutenant Allan Macdonald, of Knock, in Sleat, in the\r\nisland of Skye. He was put on board the Furnace, and brought down to\r\nthe cabin before General Campbell, who examined him most minutely.\r\nThe general asked him if he had been along with the Pretender?\r\n“Yes,” said Donald, “I was along with that young gentleman, and I\r\nwinna deny it.” “Do you know,” said the general, “what money was\r\nupon that gentleman’s head?--No less a sum than thirty thousand\r\npounds sterling, which would have made you and your family happy for\r\never.” “What then?” replied Donald, “what though I had gotten it? I\r\ncould not have enjoyed it for two days. Conscience would have gotten\r\nthe better of me; and although I could have gotten all England and\r\nScotland for my pains, I would not have allowed a hair of his body\r\nto be touched if I could hinder it, since he threw himself upon my\r\ncare.” Campbell observed that he could not much blame him. Donald\r\nwas sent to London, but released on the 10th of June, 1747. When\r\nhe arrived in Leith from London, on his return to Skye, he had no\r\nmoney to carry him thither; but his wants were supplied by the Rev.\r\nRobert (afterwards bishop) Forbes, an episcopal clergyman in Leith,\r\nwho set a subscription on foot in that town, and in Edinburgh, “to\r\nmake out,” as the bishop says, “for honest Palinurus, if possible, a\r\npound sterling, for every week he had served the prince in distress;\r\nand,” continues the worthy bishop, “I thank God I was so happy as to\r\naccomplish my design directly.” In acknowledgment of his fidelity,\r\nDonald was presented by Mr. John Walkinshaw of London, with a\r\nlarge silver snuff-box, handsomely chased, and doubly gilt in the\r\ninside. Upon the lid of this box there was the representation of\r\nan eight-oared boat, with Donald at the helm, and the eight rowers\r\nmaking their way through a very rough and tempestuous sea. The Long\r\nisland is seen in the distance upon one of the extremities of the\r\nlid, and the boat appears to be just steering into Rossinish, the\r\npoint of Benbecula where Charles landed after leaving Lochnanuagh.\r\nOn the other end of the lid there was a landscape of the end of the\r\nisle of Skye, as it appears opposite to the Long island, on which\r\nthe sites of Dunvegan and Gualtergill are marked. The clouds were\r\nrepresented as heavy and lowering, and the rain descending; and\r\nabove the clouds, i.e., near the hinge, the following motto was\r\nengraved:--“Olim hæc meminisse juvabit. Aprilis 26to, 1746.” Upon the\r\nbottom, and near the edge of the lid, was this inscription,--“Quid\r\nNeptune, paras? Fatis agitamur iniquis.” The following words were\r\nengraved on the bottom of the box:--“Donald Macleod of Gualtergill,\r\nin the isle of Skye, the faithful Palinurus, æt. 68, 1746.” Below\r\nwhich there was a representation of a dove with an olive branch in\r\nits bill. Donald never put any snuff into this box, and when asked\r\nthe cause by Mr. Forbes, he exclaimed, “Sneeshin in that box! Na,\r\nthe diel a pickle sneeshin shall ever go into it till the King be\r\nrestored; and then, I trust in God, I’ll go to London, and then I\r\nwill put sneeshin in the box, and go to the Prince, and say, ‘Sir,\r\nwill you take a sneeshin out o’ my box?’”--_Jacobite Memoirs._\r\n\r\nBurke, the other trust-worthy individual, who was a native of North\r\nUist, skulked about the hill of Eval, in his native island, for seven\r\nweeks, living part of the time on sea-weed and limpets. He afterwards\r\ntook refuge in a cave, and, when the troubles had subsided, went to\r\nEdinburgh, where, unheeded, he spent the remainder of his days as a\r\nsedan-carrier or chairman.\r\n\r\n[1247] Flora Macdonald’s Narrative.

On 1st November, Clanranald, and\r\nBoisdale his brother were also apprehended, and shipped for London.\r\nThey were discharged in the month of June following.\r\n\r\n[1252] A few days after parting with Charles, this trusty officer\r\nbeing betrayed by a person in whom he had confided, was taken\r\nprisoner. Being brought before Captain Ferguson, and refusing to give\r\nany information about the prince, he was stripped, ordered to be\r\nput into a rack, and to be whipt. When the last part of this order\r\nwas about to be executed, he was saved from the intended ignominy\r\nby a lieutenant of the Scotch Fusileers, who, drawing his sword,\r\nthreatened Ferguson with his vengeance if he used an officer in such\r\nan infamous manner. O’Neil says that, four days after he was taken,\r\nGeneral Campbell sent him word, upon his parole of honour, that if\r\nhe had any money or effects in the country, and would send them to\r\nhim, they should be safe; and that as he had always imagined that the\r\nword of honour was as sacredly kept in the English army as in others,\r\nhe went with a detachment for his money and gold watch, which he had\r\nhid among the rocks; that he sent to General Campbell by Captain\r\nCampbell of Skipness, 450 guineas, his gold watch, broadsword and\r\npistols; but that although he repeatedly applied to him to return him\r\nhis property, he never obtained it!--O’Neil’s Narrative in _Jacobite\r\nMemoirs_.\r\n\r\n[1253] Roy Macdonald’s Narrative among the _Forbes Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1254] _Genuine and True Journal_, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[1255] “Donald Macleod said the prince used to smoke a great deal\r\nof tobacco; and as in his wanderings from place to place the pipes\r\nbehoved to break and turn into short _cutties_, he used to take\r\nquills, and putting one into another, ‘and all,’ said Donald, ‘into\r\nthe end of the _cutty_, this served to make it long enough, and the\r\ntobacco to smoke cool.’ Donald added, that he never knew, in all his\r\nlife, any one better at finding out a shift than the prince was, when\r\nhe happened to be at a pinch, and that the prince would sometimes\r\nsing them a song to keep up their hearts.”--_Jacobite Memoirs_, p.\r\n401.\r\n\r\n[1256] Boswell’s _Tour_.\r\n\r\n[1257] When Dr. Johnson visited Kingsburgh, in company with Mr.\r\nBoswell, in 1774, he slept in the same bed that Charles had occupied\r\ntwenty-eight years before. “To see (says Boswell) Dr. Samuel Johnson\r\nin that bed, in the isle of Skye, in the house of Miss Flora\r\nMacdonald, struck me with such a group of ideas, as it is not easy\r\nfor words to describe, as they passed through the mind. He smiled\r\nand said, ‘I have had no ambitious thoughts in it.’”--_Tour to the\r\nHebrides._\r\n\r\n[1258] Donald Roy’s Narrative among the _Forbes Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1259] Donald Roy’s Narrative.\r\n\r\n[1260] Macleod’s _Narrative_.\r\n\r\n[1261] Boswell’s _Tour_.\r\n\r\n[1262] “John Mackenzie is alive (in 1774); I saw him at Raasay’s\r\nhouse. About eighteen years ago he hurt one of his legs when dancing,\r\nand being obliged to have it cut off, he now was going about with a\r\nwooden leg. The story of his being a _Member of Parliament_ is not\r\nyet forgotten. I took him out a little way from the house, gave him a\r\nshilling to drink Raasay’s health, and led him into a detail of the\r\nparticulars which I have just related. With less foundation, some\r\nwriters have traced the idea of a Parliament, and of the British\r\nConstitution in rude and early times. I was curious to know if he\r\nhad really heard or understood any thing of that subject, which, had\r\nhe been a greater man, would probably have been eagerly maintained.\r\n‘Why, John,’ said I, ‘did you think he should be controlled by a\r\nParliament?’ He answered, ‘I thought, Sir, there were many voices\r\nagainst one.’”--_Boswell._\r\n\r\n[1263] Idem, p. 227. _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n[1264] Boswell’s _Tour_.\r\n\r\n[1265] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 478.\r\n\r\n[1266] _Jacobite Memoirs_, pp. 477-8.\r\n\r\n[1267] Idem. p. 480.\r\n\r\n[1268] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 482. Boswell, in his _Tour_, gives a\r\ndifferent version of this story. “After this (breakfast) there came\r\nin an old woman, who, after the mode of ancient hospitality, brought\r\nwarm water, and washed Malcolm’s feet. He desired her to wash the\r\nfeet of the poor man who attended him. She at first seemed averse to\r\nthis from pride, as thinking him beneath her, and in the periphrastic\r\nlanguage of the Highlanders and the Irish, said warmly, ‘Though I\r\nwash your father’s son’s feet, why should I wash his father’s son’s\r\nfeet?’ She was, however, persuaded to do it.”\r\n\r\n[1269] The following is a copy of the note:--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--I thank God I am in good health, and have got off as\r\n  designed. Remember me to all friends, and thank them for the\r\n  trouble they have been at.--I am, Sir, your humble servant.\r\n\r\n  “JAMES THOMSON.”\r\n\r\n  “ELLIGHIUL, _July 4th, 1746_.”\r\n\r\n[1270] This ‘cutty,’ as a small tobacco-pipe, almost worn to the\r\nstump, is called in Scotland, was presented by Malcolm, when at\r\nLondon, to Dr. Burton of York, a fellow-prisoner, who got a fine\r\nshagreen case made for it.--_Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 487. Mr. Boswell\r\ngives the following sketch of this worthy Highlander in his Tour to\r\nthe Hebrides: “He was now (1774) sixty-two years of age, hale and\r\nwell proportioned, with a manly countenance, tanned by the weather,\r\nyet having a ruddiness in his cheeks, over a great part of which his\r\nrough beard extended. His eye was quick and lively, yet his look was\r\nnot fierce; but he appeared at once firm and good-humoured. He wore\r\na pair of brogues, tartan hose which came up nearly to his knees,\r\na purple camblet kilt, a black waistcoat, a short green cloth coat\r\nbound with gold cord, a yellow bushy wig, a large blue bonnet with a\r\ngold thread button. I never saw a figure which gave a more perfect\r\nrepresentation of a Highland gentleman. I wished much to have a\r\npicture of him just as he was. I found him frank and polite in the\r\ntrue sense of the word.”\r\n\r\n[1271] True Journal, p. 47.\r\n\r\n[1272] The subsequent history of the estimable Flora Macdonald may\r\nbe stated in a few words. After her return to Skye, she married,\r\nin 1750, young Macdonald of Kingsburgh, whom she accompanied to\r\nNorth Carolina, America, probably in 1774. Young Kingsburgh joined\r\nthe Royal Highland Emigrant Regiment, embodied in 1775, but was\r\ntaken prisoner in 1776 and committed to Halifax gaol. He afterwards\r\nserved with the regiment in Canada, holding the rank of captain,\r\nand, at the close of the war, returned to Scotland on half-pay.\r\nThe vessel in which Flora and her husband sailed was attacked by\r\na French privateer, and while Flora, with characteristic spirit,\r\nstood on deck, animating the seamen, she was thrown down and had\r\nher arm broken. The wanderers, however, arrived in Skye, and never\r\nafterwards left it. Flora died on the 4th of March 1790, aged\r\n68, and was interred in the churchyard of Kilmuir, in a spot set\r\napart for the graves of the Kingsburgh family. Kingsburgh died on\r\nthe 20th September 1795. Flora had seven children--five sons and\r\ntwo daughters; the sons all became officers in the army, and the\r\ndaughters officers’ wives. Dr. Johnson and Boswell visited Skye in\r\nthe autumn of 1773, and were entertained at Kingsburgh house by Flora\r\nand her husband. Flora, then aged about 51, is described by Johnson\r\nas a woman of middle stature, soft features, gentle manners, and\r\nelegant presence; and by Boswell as “a little woman, of a genteel\r\nappearance, and uncommonly mild and well-bred.”--See Carruthers’\r\nEdition of Boswell’s _Tour to the Hebrides_, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[1273] _Jacobite Memoirs_, pp. 488-90, 492.\r\n\r\n[1274] _Jacobite Memoirs_, p. 494.\r\n\r\n[1275] Author of the Journal and Memoirs, printed among the Lockhart\r\npapers, beginning at p. 579.\r\n\r\n[1276] Mr. Home mentions an interview with one Macraw in the Braes\r\nof Kintail, which is not even alluded to in the narrative of the\r\nprince’s escape, drawn up by Glenaladale and others, and printed\r\namong the _Lockhart Papers_. If such an interview took place, its\r\nomission can only be fairly accounted for by supposing that the\r\nwriter of that part of the narrative (Captain Alexander Macdonald, a\r\nyounger brother of the Laird of Dallely,) was not aware of it. The\r\nfollowing is Mr. Home’s account of this affair:--\r\n\r\n“After having crossed the line of posts, Glenaladale, thinking\r\nthe West Highlands a very unsafe place for Charles, resolved to\r\nconduct him to the Ross-shire Highlands, amongst those Mackenzies\r\nwho remained loyal, and therefore were not visited with troops.\r\nThese Mackenzies, Glenaladale thought, would not betray Charles;\r\nand the person whom he had pitched upon to confide in was Sir\r\nAlexander Mackenzie of Coul. Charles and his attendants, setting\r\nout for Ross-shire on foot, suffered greatly in their journey from\r\nwant of provisions; and when they came to the Braes of Kintail,\r\ninhabited by the Macraws, a barbarous people, among whom there are\r\nbut few gentlemen, necessity obliged them to call at the house of\r\none Christopher Macraw. Glenaladale, leaving Charles and the French\r\nofficer at some distance, went to Macraw’s house, and told him that\r\nhe and two of his friends were like to perish for want of food,\r\nand desired him to furnish them with some victuals, for which they\r\nwould pay. Macraw insisted upon knowing who his two friends were,\r\nwhich Glenaladale seemed unwilling to tell. Macraw still insisted,\r\nand Glenaladale told him at last that it was young Clan Ronald and\r\na relation of his. Notwithstanding the consequence of the persons,\r\nMacraw, though rich for an ordinary Highlander, made Glenaladale pay\r\nvery dear for some provisions he gave him. Having received the money,\r\nhe grew better humoured, and desired Glenaladale and the other two\r\nto pass the night in his house, which they did. In the course of the\r\nconversation they talked of the times, and Macraw exclaimed against\r\nthe Highlanders who had taken arms with Charles, and said that they\r\nand those who still protected him were fools and madmen; that they\r\nought to deliver themselves and their country from distress by giving\r\nhim up, and taking the reward which government had offered. That\r\nnight a Macdonald who had been in the rebel army came to Macraw’s\r\nhouse. At first sight he knew Charles, and took an opportunity of\r\nwarning Glenaladale to take care that Christopher should not discover\r\nthe quality of his guest.”\r\n\r\n[1277] _Kirkconnel MS._\r\n\r\n[1278] Chisholm was at Edinburgh many years after the rebellion, and\r\nwas visited by several persons out of curiosity, some of whom gave\r\nhim money. In shaking hands with his benefactors he always gave the\r\nleft hand, and excused himself for offering that hand by stating that\r\nas he had shaken hands at parting with the prince, he was resolved\r\nnever to give his right hand to any man till he saw the prince again.\r\n\r\n[1279] Chambers’s _Rebellion_. Stewart’s _Sketches_, i. 59.\r\n\r\n[1280] The party in question consisted of about two hundred of Lord\r\nLoudon’s Highlanders, under Captain Grant of Knockando, Strathspey.\r\n\r\n[1281] Appendix to Home’s Works, vol. iii. No. 46. Cluny himself\r\nhad several places of concealment on his estate. “He lived for nine\r\nyears chiefly in a cave, at a short distance from his house, which\r\nwas burnt to the ground by the king’s troops. This cave was in the\r\nfront of a woody precipice, the trees and shelving rocks completely\r\nconcealing the entrance. It was dug out by his own people, who\r\nworked by night, and conveyed the stones and rubbish into a lake in\r\nthe neighbourhood, in order that no vestige of their labour might\r\nbetray the retreat of their master. In this sanctuary he lived\r\nsecure, occasionally visiting his friends by night, or when time had\r\nslackened the rigour of the search. Upwards of one hundred persons\r\nknew where he was concealed, and a reward of £1,000 was offered to\r\nany one who should give information against him; and as it was known\r\nthat he was concealed on his estate, eighty men were constantly\r\nstationed there, besides the parties occasionally marching into the\r\ncountry to intimidate his tenantry, and induce them to disclose the\r\nplace of his concealment. But though the soldiers were animated with\r\nthe hope of the reward, and though a step of promotion to the officer\r\nwho should apprehend him was superadded, yet so true were his people,\r\nso strict to their promise of secrecy, and so dexterous in conveying\r\nto him the necessaries he required, in his long confinement, that\r\nnot a trace of him could be discovered, nor an individual found base\r\nenough to give a hint to his detriment. At length, wearied out with\r\nthis dreary and hopeless state of existence, and taught to despair of\r\npardon, he escaped to France in 1755, and died there the following\r\nyear.”--_Stewart’s Sketches_, 3d Edition, vol. i. p. 62.\r\n\r\n“The late Sir Hector Munro, then a lieutenant in the 34th regiment,\r\nand from his zeal and knowledge of the country and the people,\r\nintrusted with the command of a large party, continued two whole\r\nyears in Badenoch, for the purpose of discovering the chief’s\r\nretreat. The unwearied vigilance of the clan could alone have saved\r\nhim from the diligence of this party. At night Cluny came from his\r\nretreat to vary the monotony of his existence, by spending a few of\r\nthe dark hours convivially with his friends. On one occasion he had\r\nbeen suspected, and got out by a back window just as the military\r\nwere breaking open the door. At another time, seeing the windows of\r\na house kept close, and several persons going to visit the family\r\nafter dark, the commander broke in at the window of the suspected\r\nchamber, with two loaded pistols, and thus endangered the life of\r\na lady newly delivered of a child, on account of whose confinement\r\nthese suspicious circumstances had taken place. This shows that there\r\nwas no want of diligence on the part of the pursuers. Cluny himself\r\nbecame so cautious, while living the life of an outlaw, that on\r\nparting with his wife, or his most attached friends, he never told\r\nthem to which of his concealments he was going, or suffered any one\r\nto accompany him,--thus enabling them, when questioned, to answer,\r\nthat they knew not where he was.”--_Idem._\r\n\r\nIt may be here stated _en passant_ that Cluny did not leave Scotland\r\nfrom his “dreary and hopeless state of existence,” but in compliance\r\nwith a special request made to him by Prince Charles. See a letter\r\nfrom the prince to Cluny, of 4th Sept., 1754, among the _Stuart\r\nPapers_.\r\n\r\n[1282] Vide several letters from Colonel Warren to the Chevalier de\r\nSt. George and others, among _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1746-1747.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SOVEREIGN:--George II., 1727-1760.\r\n\r\n  Commission of _Oyer and Terminer_--Trial of prisoners--Francis\r\n  Townley--Jemmy Dawson--Lords Kilmarnock, Cromarty, and\r\n  Balmerino--Execution of these noblemen--Other executions--Trials\r\n  at Carlisle and York--Trial and execution of Mr. Ratcliffe--Trial\r\n  and execution of Lord Lovat--Act of Indemnity passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the issue of the contest remained doubtful, the government\r\ntook no steps to punish the prisoners who had fallen into their\r\nhands at Carlisle; but after the decisive affair of Culloden, when\r\nthere appeared no chance of the Jacobite party ever having it in\r\ntheir power to retaliate, the government resolved to vindicate the\r\nauthority of the law by making examples of some of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nAs it was intended to try the prisoners at different places for the\r\nsake of convenience, an act was passed empowering his majesty to try\r\nthem in any county he might select.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th and 25th of June bills of indictment were found against\r\n36 of the prisoners taken at Carlisle, and against one David Morgan,\r\na barrister, who had been apprehended in Staffordshire. The court\r\nthen adjourned till the 3d of July, on which day the prisoners\r\nwere arraigned. Three only pleaded guilty. The rest applied for a\r\npostponement of their trials on the ground that material witnesses\r\nfor their defence were at a considerable distance. The court in\r\nconsequence ruled that in cases where witnesses were in England the\r\ntrial should be put off to the 15th of July, and where they were in\r\nScotland, to the 25th of the same month.\r\n\r\nThe court accordingly met on the 15th of July, and proceeded with\r\nthe trial of Francis Townley, Esquire, before a grand jury, at\r\nthe court-house, Southwark. This unfortunate gentleman had been\r\ncolonel of the Manchester regiment. He was of a respectable family\r\nin Lancashire. Obliged to retire to France in 1728, he had obtained\r\na commission from the King of France, and had served at the siege\r\nof Philipsburgh under the Duke of Berwick, who lost his life before\r\nthe walls of that place. He continued sixteen years in the French\r\nservice; and after his return to England had received a commission\r\nto raise a regiment. A plea was set up by his council, that holding\r\na commission in the French service he was entitled to the benefit\r\nof the cartel as well as any other French officer, but this was\r\noverruled, and he was found guilty. On the next and two following\r\ndays eighteen other persons, chiefly officers in the said regiment,\r\nwere brought to trial. Five were attainted by their own confession\r\nof high treason, twelve on a verdict of high treason of levying war\r\nagainst the king, and one was acquitted. These seventeen persons,\r\nalong with Townley, were all condemned to death, and nine of them,\r\nincluding Townley, were selected for execution on the 30th. The rest\r\nwere reprieved for three weeks.\r\n\r\nKensington common was the place destined for the execution of these\r\nunfortunate men, most of whom met their fate with fortitude and\r\nresignation. The execution was accompanied with the disgusting and\r\nbarbarous details usual at that time in cases of treason.\r\n\r\nTwo singular and interesting circumstances occurred at this\r\nexecution. The one was the attendance of a younger brother of\r\nLieutenant Thomas Deacon’s, of the Manchester Regiment, and one of\r\nthose who had obtained a reprieve. At his own request he was allowed\r\nto witness the execution of his brother in a coach under the charge\r\nof a guard. The other was one of a very affecting description.\r\nHurried away by the impetuosity of youth, James Dawson, one of the\r\nsufferers, the son of a Lancashire gentleman, had abandoned his\r\nstudies at St. John’s college, Cambridge, and had joined the Jacobite\r\nstandard. He and a young lady of good family and handsome fortune\r\nwere warmly attached to each other, and had Dawson been acquitted,\r\nor, after condemnation, found mercy, the day of his enlargement was\r\nto have been that of their marriage. When all hopes of mercy were\r\nextinguished, the young lady resolved to witness the execution of her\r\nlover, and so firm was her resolution, that no persuasions of her\r\nfriends could induce her to abandon her determination. On the morning\r\nof the execution she accordingly followed the sledges to the place\r\nof execution in a hackney coach, accompanied by a gentleman nearly\r\nrelated to her, and one female friend. She got near enough to see\r\nthe fire kindled which was to consume that heart she knew was so\r\nmuch devoted to her, and to observe the other appalling preparations\r\nwithout committing any of those extravagances her friends had\r\napprehended. She had even the fortitude to restrain her feelings\r\nwhile the executioner was pulling the cap over the eyes of her lover;\r\nbut when he was thrown off she in an agony of grief drew back her\r\nhead into the coach, and, crying out, “My dear, I follow thee, I\r\nfollow thee;--sweet Jesus, receive both our souls together!” fell\r\nupon the neck of her female companion, and instantly expired.[1283]\r\n\r\nThe principal witness against Townley, Deacon, Dawson, and others,\r\nwas Samuel Maddock, an ensign in the same regiment, who, to save his\r\nown life, turned king’s evidence against his former comrades.[1284]\r\n\r\nThe individuals next proceeded against were persons of a higher\r\ngrade. The Marquis of Tullibardine escaped the fate which awaited\r\nhim, having died of a lingering indisposition in the Tower on the\r\n9th of July; but on the 23d of that month the grand jury of the\r\ncounty of Surrey found bills for high treason against the Earls\r\nof Kilmarnock, and Cromarty, and Lord Balmerino. Lord-chancellor\r\nHardwicke was appointed Lord High Steward for the trial of these\r\npeers. The indictments being certified, the house of lords fixed the\r\n28th of July for the day of trial. Accordingly, on the day appointed\r\nthe three lords proceeded from the Tower towards Westminster-hall,\r\nwhere the trial was conducted with great pomp and ceremony.\r\n\r\nAfter the indictments had been read, the Earls of Kilmarnock and\r\nCromarty pleaded “guilty,” and threw themselves entirely upon the\r\nking’s mercy. Before pleading to his indictment, Lord Balmerino\r\nstated that he was not at Carlisle at the time specified in the\r\nindictment, being eleven miles off when that city was taken, and he\r\nrequested to know from his grace if it would avail him any thing\r\nto prove that fact. Lord Hardwicke said that such a circumstance\r\nmight, or might not, be of use to him; but he informed him that it\r\nwas contrary to form to permit him to put any questions before\r\npleading to the indictment, by saying whether he was guilty or not\r\nguilty. His grace desiring his lordship to plead, the intrepid[1285]\r\nBalmerino apparently not understanding the meaning of that legal\r\nterm, exclaimed, with great animation, “Plead! Why, I am pleading as\r\nfast as I can.” The lord-high-steward having explained the import of\r\nthe phrase, the noble baron answered, “Not guilty.”\r\n\r\nThe trial then proceeded. Four witnesses were examined. One of them\r\nproved that he saw Lord Balmerino ride into Carlisle on a bay horse\r\nthe day after it was taken by the Highlanders--that he saw him\r\nafterwards ride up to the market-place with his sword drawn at the\r\nhead of his troop of horse, which was the second troop of Charles’s\r\nbody guards, and was called Elphinstone’s horse. Another witness\r\ndeponed that he saw his lordship ride into Manchester at the head\r\nof his troop, and that he was there when the young Chevalier was\r\nproclaimed regent. Two other witnesses proved that his lordship\r\nwas called colonel of his troop, that he always acted in that\r\nstation, gave orders on all occasions to his officers, and that he\r\nwas in great favour with Prince Charles. The evidence on the part\r\nof the crown having been finished, the lord-high-steward asked the\r\nprisoner if he had any thing to offer in his defence, or meant to\r\ncall any witnesses. His lordship replied that he had nothing to\r\nsay, but to make an exception to the indictment which was incorrect\r\nin charging him with being at Carlisle at the time it was taken by\r\nthe Highlanders. The peers then resolved to take the opinion of\r\nthe judges upon the point, and these were unanimously of opinion,\r\nthat, as an overt act of treason and other acts of treason had\r\nbeen proved beyond contradiction, there was no occasion to prove\r\nexplicitly every thing that was laid in the indictment; and that,\r\nof course, the prisoner’s objection was not material. The peers then\r\nunanimously found Lord Balmerino guilty of high treason, after which,\r\nthe other two lords were brought to the bar, and were informed by\r\nthe lord-high-steward, that if either of them had any thing to move\r\nin arrest of judgment, they must come prepared on the Wednesday\r\nfollowing at eleven o’clock, and state their objections, otherwise\r\nsentence of death would be awarded against them. The three lords were\r\nthen carried back to the Tower in coaches, and the axe, which was in\r\nthe coach with Lord Balmerino, had its edge pointed towards him.\r\n\r\nThe court accordingly met again on Wednesday the 30th of July, when\r\nthe lord-high-steward addressed the prisoners; and beginning with\r\nLord Kilmarnock, asked him if he had any thing to offer why judgment\r\nof death should not be passed against him. His lordship stated,\r\nthat having, from a due sense of his folly, and the heinousness of\r\nhis crimes, acknowledged his guilt, he meant to offer nothing in\r\nextenuation, but to throw himself entirely on the compassion of\r\nthe court, that it might intercede with his majesty for his royal\r\nclemency. He then, in a somewhat humble speech, urged several reasons\r\nwhy he should be treated with clemency, expressing great contrition\r\nfor having, somewhat against his own inclination, joined in the\r\n“unnatural scheme.” He concluded by stating, that if after what\r\nhe had stated their lordships did not feel themselves called upon\r\nto employ their interest with his majesty for his royal clemency,\r\nthat he would lay down his life with the utmost resignation, and\r\nthat his last moments should “be employed in fervent prayer for the\r\npreservation of the illustrious house of Hanover, and the peace and\r\nprosperity of Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cromarty began a most humiliating but pathetic appeal,\r\nby declaring that he had been guilty of an offence which merited\r\nthe highest indignation of his majesty, their lordships, and the\r\npublic; and that it was from a conviction of his guilt that he had\r\nnot presumed to trouble their lordships with any defence. “Nothing\r\nremains, my lords,” he continued, “but to throw myself, my life, and\r\nfortune, upon your lordships’ compassion; but of these, my lords,\r\nas to myself is the least part of my sufferings. I have involved an\r\naffectionate wife, with an unborn infant, as parties of my guilt, to\r\nshare its penalties; I have involved my eldest son, whose infancy\r\nand regard for his parents hurried him down the stream of rebellion.\r\nI have involved also eight innocent children, who must feel their\r\nparent’s punishment before they know his guilt. Let them, my lords,\r\nbe pledges to his majesty; let them be pledges to your lordships; let\r\nthem be pledges to my country for mercy; let the silent eloquence of\r\ntheir grief and tears; let the powerful language of innocent nature\r\nsupply my want of eloquence and persuasion; let me enjoy mercy, but\r\nno longer than I deserve it; and let me no longer enjoy life than I\r\nshall use it to deface the crime I have been guilty of. Whilst I thus\r\nintercede to his majesty through the mediation of your lordships for\r\nmercy, let my remorse for my guilt as a subject; let the sorrow of\r\nmy heart as a husband; let the anguish of my mind as a father, speak\r\nthe rest of my misery. As your lordships are men, feel as men; but\r\nmay none of you ever suffer the smallest part of my anguish. But if\r\nafter all, my lords, my safety shall be found inconsistent with that\r\nof the public, and nothing but my blood can atone for my unhappy\r\ncrime; if the sacrifice of my life, my fortune and family, is judged\r\nindispensably necessary for stopping the loud demands for public\r\njustice; and if the bitter cup is not to pass from me, not mine, but\r\nthy will, O God, be done.”\r\n\r\nWhen the lord-high-steward addressed Lord Balmerino, he produced a\r\npaper, and desired it might be read. His grace told his lordship\r\nthat he was at liberty to read it if he pleased; but his lordship\r\nreplied that his voice was too low, and that he could not read it\r\nso distinctly as he could wish. One of the clerks of parliament, by\r\norder of the lord-high-steward, then read the paper, which was to\r\nthis effect:--That although his majesty had been empowered by an\r\nact of parliament, made the last session, to appoint the trials for\r\nhigh treason to take place in any county he should appoint; yet,\r\nas the alleged act of treason was stated to have been committed at\r\nCarlisle, and prior to the passing of the said act, he ought to\r\nhave been indicted at Carlisle, and not in the county of Surrey, as\r\nthe act could not have a retrospective effect. His lordship prayed\r\nthe court to assign him counsel to argue the point. The peers, after\r\nconsideration, agreed to his petition for counsel, and at his request\r\nassigned him Messrs. Wilbraham and Forrester, and adjourned the court\r\nto the 1st of August.\r\n\r\nThe three prisoners were again brought back from the Tower. On\r\nthat day the lord-high-steward asked Lord Balmerino if he was then\r\nready by his counsel to argue the point, which he proposed to the\r\ncourt on the previous day. His lordship answered, that as his\r\ncounsel had advised him that there was nothing in the objection\r\nsufficient to found an arrest of judgment upon, he begged to withdraw\r\nthe objection, and craved their lordships’ pardon for giving\r\nthem so much trouble. The prisoners then all declaring that they\r\nsubmitted themselves to the court, Lord Hardwicke addressed them\r\nin a suitable speech, and concluded by pronouncing the following\r\nsentence:[1286]--“The judgment of the law is, and this high court\r\ndoth award, that you, William, Earl of Kilmarnock; George, Earl of\r\nCromarty; and Arthur Lord Balmerino, and every of you, return to the\r\nprison of the Tower from whence you came: from thence you must be\r\ndrawn to the place of execution: when you come there, you must be\r\nhanged by the neck, but not till you are dead; for you must be cut\r\ndown alive; then your bowels must be taken out and burnt before your\r\nfaces; then your heads must be severed from your bodies; and your\r\nbodies must be divided each into four quarters; and these must be at\r\nthe king’s disposal. And God Almighty be merciful to your souls.”\r\nThen the prisoners were removed from the bar, and after taking a cold\r\ncollation which had been prepared for them, were carried back to the\r\nTower in the same order and form as before.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kilmarnock immediately presented a petition to the king\r\nfor mercy, and also another, a copy of the first, to the Prince of\r\nWales, praying his royal highness’s intercession with his majesty\r\nin his behalf; and a third to the Duke of Cumberland for a similar\r\npurpose. In this last mentioned petition he asserted his innocence\r\nof charges which had been made against him, of having advised the\r\nputting to death of the prisoners taken by the Highland army before\r\nthe battle of Culloden, and of advising or approving of an alleged\r\norder for giving no quarter to his majesty’s troops in that battle.\r\nIn the petitions to the king and the Prince of Wales, the earl\r\ndeclared that he had surrendered himself at the battle of Culloden,\r\nat a time when he could have easily escaped; but he afterwards\r\nadmitted that the statement was untrue, and that he was induced to\r\nmake it from a strong desire for life; that he had no intention of\r\nsurrendering; and that, with the view of facilitating his escape, he\r\nhad gone towards the body of horse which made him prisoner, thinking\r\nthat it was Fitz-James’s horse, with the design of mounting behind a\r\ndragoon. These petitions were entirely disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cromarty, with better claims to mercy, also petitioned\r\nthe king. In support of this application the countess waited upon\r\nthe lords of the cabinet council, and presented a petition to each\r\nof them; and, on the Sunday following the sentence, she went to\r\nKensington-palace in deep mourning, accompanied by Lady Stair, to\r\nintercede with his majesty in behalf of her husband. She was a woman\r\nof great strength of mind, and though far advanced in pregnancy, had\r\nhitherto displayed surprising fortitude; but on the present trying\r\noccasion she gave way to grief. She took her station in the entrance\r\nthrough which the king was to pass to chapel, and when he approached\r\nshe fell upon her knees, seized him by the coat, and presented her\r\nsupplication, fainted away at his feet. The king immediately raised\r\nher up, and taking the petition, gave it in charge of the Duke of\r\nGrafton, one of his attendants. He then desired Lady Stair to conduct\r\nher to one of the apartments. The Dukes of Hamilton and Montrose,\r\nthe Earl of Stair and other courtiers, backed these petitions for\r\nthe royal mercy by a personal application to the king, who granted a\r\npardon to the earl on the 9th of August.\r\n\r\nThe high-minded Balmerino disdained to compromise his principles by\r\nsuing for pardon, and when he heard that his fellow-prisoners had\r\napplied for mercy, he sarcastically remarked, that as they must have\r\ngreat interest at court, they might have squeezed his name in with\r\ntheir own. From the time of his sentence down to his execution, he\r\nshowed no symptoms of fear. He never entertained any hopes of pardon,\r\nfor he said he considered his case desperate, as he had been once\r\npardoned before. When Lady Balmerino expressed her great concern\r\nfor the approaching fate of her Lord, he said, “Grieve not, my dear\r\nPeggy, we must all die once, and this is but a few years very likely\r\nbefore my death must have happened some other way: therefore, wipe\r\naway your tears; you may marry again, and get a better husband.”\r\nAbout a week after his sentence a gentleman went to see him, and\r\napologising for intruding upon him when he had such a short time to\r\nlive, his lordship replied, “Oh! Sir, no intrusion at all: I have\r\ndone nothing to make my conscience uneasy. I shall die with a true\r\nheart, and undaunted; for I think no man fit to live who is not fit\r\nto die; nor am I any ways concerned at what I have done.” Being asked\r\na few days before his execution in what manner he would go to the\r\nscaffold, he answered, “I will go in the regimentals which I wore\r\nwhen I was first taken, with a woollen shirt next my skin, which will\r\nserve me instead of a shroud to be buried in.” Being again asked\r\nwhy he would not have a new suit of black, he replied, “It would\r\nbe thought very imprudent in a man to repair an old house when the\r\nlease of it was near expiring; and the lease of my life expires next\r\nMonday.” The king could not but admire the high bearing and manly\r\ndemeanour of this unfortunate nobleman; and when the friends of the\r\nother prisoners were making unceasing applications to him for mercy,\r\nhe said, “Does nobody intercede for poor Balmerino? He, though a\r\nrebel, is at least an honest man.” According to Walpole, Balmerino\r\nwas “jolly with his pretty Peggy” almost to the very last.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August an order was signed in council for the\r\nexecution of the Earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino, and on the\r\n12th two writs passed the great seal, empowering the constable of\r\nthe Tower to deliver their bodies to the sheriffs of London, for\r\nexecution on Monday the 18th. The order for their execution on the\r\n18th of August having been announced to the unfortunate noblemen by\r\nMr. Foster, a dissenting clergyman, Lord Kilmarnock received the\r\nintelligence with all the composure of a man resigned to his fate,\r\nbut at the same time with a deep feeling of concern for his future\r\nstate. Balmerino, who perhaps had as strong a sense of religion as\r\nKilmarnock, received the news with the utmost unconcern. He and his\r\nlady were sitting at dinner when the warrant arrived, and, being\r\ninformed of it, her ladyship started up from the table and fainted\r\naway. His lordship raised her up, and, after she had recovered, he\r\nrequested her to resume her seat at table and finish her dinner.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday preceding the execution, General Williamson, at\r\nKilmarnock’s desire, as is supposed, gave him a minute detail of\r\nall the circumstances of solemnity and outward terror which would\r\naccompany it.\r\n\r\nBalmerino was not actuated with the same feeling of curiosity as\r\nKilmarnock was to know the circumstances which would attend his\r\nexecution, but awaited his fate with the indifference of a martyr\r\ndesirous of sealing his faith with his blood. The following letter,\r\nwritten by him on the eve of his execution, to the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge, strikingly exemplifies the cool intrepidity of the man, and\r\nthe sterling honesty with which he adhered to his principles:--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--You may remember that, in the year 1716, when your Majesty\r\n  was in Scotland, I left a company of foot, purely with a design\r\n  to serve your Majesty, and, had I not made my escape then, I\r\n  should certainly have been shot for a deserter.\r\n\r\n  “When I was abroad I lived many years at my own charges before\r\n  I ask’d any thing from you, being unwilling to trouble your\r\n  Majesty while I had any thing of my own to live upon, and when\r\n  my father wrote me that he had a remission for me, which was got\r\n  without my asking or knowledge, I did not accept of it till I\r\n  first had your Majesty’s permission. Sir, when His Royal Highness\r\n  the Prince, your son, came to Edinburgh, as it was my bounden\r\n  and indispensable duty, I joyn’d him, for which I am to-morrow\r\n  to lose my head on a scaffold, whereat I am so far from being\r\n  dismayed, that it gives me great satisfaction and peace of\r\n  mind that I die in so righteous a cause. I hope, Sir, on these\r\n  considerations, your Majesty will provide for my wife so as she\r\n  may not want bread, which otherwise she must do, my brother\r\n  having left more debt on the estate than it was worth, and having\r\n  nothing in the world to give her. I am, with the most profound\r\n  respect, Sir, your Majesty’s most faithful and devoted subject\r\n  and servant,\r\n\r\n  “BALMERINO.”[1287]\r\n\r\n  “TOWER OF LONDON, }\r\n  _17th August, 1746_.” }\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 18th of August, great preparations were made on\r\nTower-hill for the execution. At ten o’clock the block was fixed on\r\nthe stage, covered with black cloth, and several sacks of sawdust\r\nwere provided to be strewed upon the scaffold. Soon after the two\r\ncoffins were brought and placed upon the scaffold. Upon Kilmarnock’s\r\ncoffin was a plate with this inscription, “Gulielmus Comes de\r\nKilmarnock, decollatus 18º Augusti, 1746, ætat. suæ 42,” with an\r\nearl’s coronet over it, and six coronets over the six handles. The\r\nplate on Balmerino’s coffin bore this inscription, “Arthurus Dominus\r\nde Balmerino, decollatus 18º Augusti, 1746, ætat. suæ 58,” surmounted\r\nby a baron’s coronet, and with six others over the handles.\r\n\r\nThese preparations were completed about half-past ten, when the\r\nsheriffs, accompanied by their officers, went to the Tower, and,\r\nknocking at the door, demanded “The bodies of William, Earl of\r\nKilmarnock, and Arthur, Lord Balmerino.” General Williamson thereupon\r\nwent to inform the prisoners that the sheriffs were in attendance.\r\nWhen told that he was wanted, Lord Kilmarnock, who had just been\r\nengaged in prayer with Mr. Foster, betrayed no fear, but said, with\r\ngreat composure, “General, I am ready; I’ll follow you.” On leaving\r\nthe Tower, Kilmarnock and Balmerino met at the foot of the stair.\r\nThey embraced each other, and Balmerino said, “I am heartily sorry to\r\nhave your company in this expedition.” The ill-fated noblemen were\r\nthen brought to the Tower-gate, and delivered over to the sheriffs.\r\nWhen the prisoners were leaving the Tower, the deputy-lieutenant,\r\naccording to an ancient usage, cried, “God bless King George!” to\r\nwhich Kilmarnock assented by a bow, but Balmerino emphatically\r\nexclaimed, “God bless King James!” The prisoners were then conducted\r\nto the house fitted up for their reception, and, being put into\r\nseparate apartments, their friends were admitted to see them. When\r\nthe prisoners arrived at the door of the house, some persons among\r\nthe crowd were heard asking others, “Which is Lord Balmerino?” His\r\nlordship, overhearing the question, turned a little about, and, with\r\na smile, said, “I am Balmerino, gentlemen, at your service.”\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock Lord Balmerino sent a message to Lord Kilmarnock\r\nrequesting an interview, which being consented to, Balmerino was\r\nbrought into Kilmarnock’s apartment. The following dialogue, as\r\nreported by Mr. Foster, then ensued. Balmerino--“My lord, I beg leave\r\nto ask your lordship one question.” Kilmarnock--“To any question,\r\nmy lord, that you shall think proper to ask, I believe I shall see\r\nno reason to decline giving an answer.” B. “Why then, my lord, did\r\nyou ever see or know of any order signed by the prince, to give no\r\nquarter at Culloden?” K. “No, my lord.” B. “Nor I neither; and\r\ntherefore it seems to be an invention to justify their own murders.”\r\nK. “No, my lord, I do not think that inference can be drawn from it;\r\nbecause, while I was at Inverness, I was informed by several officers\r\nthat there was such an order, signed ‘George Murray;’ and that it\r\nwas in the duke’s custody.” B. “Lord George Murray! Why, then, they\r\nshould not charge it upon the prince.” After this conversation the\r\nprisoners tenderly saluted each other, and Balmerino, after bidding\r\nhis friend in affliction an eternal and happy adieu, added, with a\r\ncountenance beaming with benignity, “My dear lord, I wish I could\r\nalone pay the reckoning and suffer for us both.”\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock appeared to be most anxious to impress upon the minds\r\nof those who were with him the sincerity of his repentance for the\r\ncrime for which he was about to suffer. He declared himself fully\r\nsatisfied with the legality of King George’s title to the crown,\r\nand stated that his attachment to the reigning family, which had\r\nsuffered a slight interruption, was then as strong as ever. He spent\r\na considerable time in devotion with Mr. Foster, till he got a hint\r\nfrom the sheriffs that the time was far advanced, his rank as an earl\r\ngiving him a melancholy priority on the scaffold. After Mr. Foster\r\nhad said a short prayer, his lordship took a tender farewell of the\r\npersons who attended him, and, preceded by the sheriffs, left the\r\nroom followed by his friends. Notwithstanding the great trouble he\r\nhad taken, in accordance with the wish of Mr. Foster, to familiarise\r\nhis mind with the outward apparatus of death, he was appalled when he\r\nstepped upon the scaffold at beholding the dreadful scene around him,\r\nand, turning round about to one of the clergymen, said, “Home, this\r\nis terrible!” He was attired in a suit of black clothes, and, though\r\nhis countenance was composed, he had a melancholy air about him,\r\nwhich indicated great mental suffering. Many of the spectators near\r\nthe scaffold were so much affected by his appearance that they could\r\nnot refrain from tears, and even the executioner was so overcome that\r\nhe was obliged to drink several glasses of spirits to enable him to\r\nperform his dreadful duty.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster, who had accompanied his lordship to the scaffold,\r\nremained on it a short time in earnest conversation, and having\r\nquitted it, the executioner came forward and asked his lordship’s\r\nforgiveness in executing the very painful task he had to perform. The\r\nunhappy nobleman informed the executioner that he readily forgave\r\nhim, and presenting him a purse containing five guineas, desired\r\nhim to have courage. His lordship then took off his upper clothes,\r\nturned down the neck of his shirt under his vest, and undoing his\r\nlong dressed hair from the bag which contained it, tied it round his\r\nhead in a damask cloth in the form of a cap. He then informed the\r\nexecutioner that he would drop a handkerchief as a signal for the\r\nstroke about two minutes after he had laid his head down upon the\r\nblock. Either to support himself, or as a more convenient posture for\r\ndevotion, he laid his hands upon the block. On observing this the\r\nexecutioner begged his lordship to let his hands fall down, lest they\r\nshould be mangled or break the blow. Being told that the neck of his\r\nwaistcoat was in the way, he rose up, and with the help of Colonel\r\nCraufurd, one of his friends, had it taken off. The neck being now\r\nmade completely bare to the shoulders, the earl again knelt down as\r\nbefore. This occurrence did not in the least discompose him, and Mr.\r\nHome’s servant, who held the cloth to receive his head, heard him,\r\nafter laying down his head the second time, put the executioner in\r\nmind that in two minutes he would give the signal. He spent this\r\nshort time in fervent devotion. Then, fixing his neck upon the block,\r\nhe gave the fatal signal; his body remained without the least motion\r\ntill the stroke of the axe, which at the first blow almost severed\r\nthe head from the body. A small piece of skin which still united them\r\nwas cut through by another stroke. The head, which was received into\r\na scarlet cloth, was not exposed, in consequence, it is said, of the\r\nearl’s own request, but along with the body, was deposited in the\r\ncoffin, which was delivered to his friends, and placed by them in\r\nthe hearse. The scaffold was then strewed over with fresh sawdust,\r\nand the executioner, who was dressed in white, changed such of his\r\nclothes as were stained with blood.\r\n\r\nThe first act of this bloody tragedy being now over, the\r\nunder-sheriff went to Balmerino’s apartments to give him notice that\r\nhis time was come. “I suppose,” said his lordship on seeing this\r\nfunctionary enter, “my Lord Kilmarnock is no more.” Being answered\r\nin the affirmative, he asked the under-sheriff how the executioner\r\nhad performed his duty, and upon receiving the account, he said,\r\n“then it was well done, and now, gentlemen, (continued the inflexible\r\nBalmerino, turning to his friends,) I will detain you no longer,\r\nfor I desire not to protract my life.” During the time spent in\r\nKilmarnock’s execution Balmerino had conversed cheerfully with his\r\nfriends, and twice refreshed himself with a bit of bread and a glass\r\nof wine, desiring the company to drink him “a degree to heaven.”\r\nSaluting each of his friends in the most affectionate manner, he bade\r\nthem all adieu, and leaving them bathed in tears, he hastened to the\r\nscaffold, which he mounted with a firm step.\r\n\r\nThe strong feeling of pity with which the spectators had beheld\r\nthe handsome though emaciated figure of the gentle Kilmarnock gave\r\nplace to sensations of another kind, when they beheld the bold and\r\nstrongly-built personage who now stood on the stage before them.\r\nAttired in the same regimentals of blue turned up with red which he\r\nhad worn at the battle of Culloden, and treading the scaffold with\r\na firm step and an undaunted air, he gloried in the cause for which\r\nhe suffered, and forced the assembled multitude to pay an unwilling\r\ntribute of admiration to his greatness of soul. His friends, on\r\nbeholding the apparatus of death, expressed great concern; but his\r\nlordship reproved their anxiety. His lordship walked round the\r\nscaffold, and bowed to the people. He then went to the coffin, and\r\nreading the inscription, said it was correct. With great composure he\r\nexamined the block, which he called his “pillow of rest.” He then put\r\non his spectacles, and, pulling a paper from his pocket, read it to\r\nthe few persons about him, in which he declared his firm attachment\r\nto the house of Stuart, and stated that the only fault he had ever\r\ncommitted deserving his present fate, and for which he expressed his\r\nsincere regret, was in having served in the armies of the enemies\r\nof that house, Queen Anne and George I. He complained that he had\r\nnot been well used by the lieutenant of the Tower, but that having\r\nreceived the sacrament the day before, and read several of the Psalms\r\nof David, he had forgiven him, and said that he now died in charity\r\nwith all men.\r\n\r\nCalling at last for the executioner, that functionary stepped\r\nforward to ask his forgiveness, but Balmerino interrupted him, and\r\nsaid, “Friend, you need not ask my forgiveness; the execution of\r\nyour duty is commendable.” Then, presenting him with three guineas,\r\nhis lordship added, “Friend, I never had much money; this is all I\r\nhave, I wish it was more for your sake, and I am sorry I can add\r\nnothing else to it but my coat and waistcoat.” These he instantly\r\ntook off, and laid them down on the coffin. He then put on the\r\nflannel waistcoat which he had provided, and a tartan cap on his\r\nhead, to signify, as he said, that he died a Scotchman; and going to\r\nthe block, placed his head upon it in order to show the executioner\r\nthe signal for the blow, which was by dropping his arms. Returning\r\nthen to his friends, he took an affectionate farewell of them, and,\r\nsurveying the vast number of spectators, said, “I am afraid there are\r\nsome who may think my behaviour bold; but,” addressing a gentleman\r\nnear him, he added, “remember, Sir, what I tell you; it arises from\r\na confidence in God, and a clear conscience.”\r\n\r\nObserving at this moment the executioner with the axe in his hand,\r\nhe went up, and, taking it from him, felt the edge. On returning the\r\nfatal instrument, Balmerino showed him where to strike the blow, and\r\nencouraged him to do it with resolution, “for in that, friend,” said\r\nhe, “will consist your mercy.” His lordship, then, with a countenance\r\nbeaming with joy, knelt down at the block, and extending his arms,\r\nsaid the following prayer:--“O Lord, reward my friends, forgive my\r\nenemies, bless the prince and the duke, and receive my soul.” He then\r\ninstantly dropt his arms. The executioner, taken unawares by the\r\nsuddenness of the signal, hurriedly raised the axe, and missing his\r\naim, struck the ill-fated lord between the shoulders, a blow which,\r\nit has been said, deprived the unfortunate nobleman of sensation;\r\nbut it has been averred by some of the spectators, that Balmerino\r\nturned his head a little round upon the block, gnashed his teeth,\r\nand gave the executioner a ghastly stare. Taking immediately a\r\nbetter aim, the executioner gave a second blow, which almost severed\r\nthe head from the body, and deprived the noble victim of life. The\r\nbody having fallen from the block, it was instantly replaced, and\r\nthe executioner, once more raising the fatal weapon, finished his\r\ntask. The head was received in a piece of red cloth, and deposited\r\nalong with the body in the coffin, and being put into a hearse, was\r\ncarried to the chapel of the Tower, and buried with that of Lord\r\nKilmarnock, near the remains of Lord Tullibardine. Mr. Humphreys,\r\ncurate of the chapel, read the funeral service, and when he came to\r\nthe words, “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,” two gentlemen, friends\r\nof the deceased, took up the spades and performed the office of the\r\ngrave-diggers.\r\n\r\nFor a time the unhappy fate of the two lords almost exclusively\r\nengaged the attention of the public; and in private circles, as well\r\nas in the periodicals of the day, the conduct and bearing of the\r\nunfortunate noblemen were viewed and commented upon according to the\r\npartialities and feelings of the parties. By the whigs, and generally\r\nby all persons of a real or affected seriousness of mind, Kilmarnock\r\nwas regarded as a perfect model of the dying Christian, who, though\r\nhe had been guilty of base ingratitude to the government, and had\r\ntold a falsehood at his trial, had fully atoned for his offences by\r\nhis contrition; whilst his companion in suffering was looked upon\r\nas an incorrigible rebel, who had braved death with an unbecoming\r\nlevity. The Jacobites, however, and even some of the friends of\r\nthe revolution settlement, whilst they could not but admire the\r\ncalm resignation of Kilmarnock, heartily despised the cringing\r\npusillanimity which he displayed to soften the resentment of the\r\ngovernment. Balmerino was viewed by them in a very different light.\r\nWhilst the Jacobites looked upon him as an illustrious martyr, who\r\nhad added a lustre to their cause by his inflexible intrepidity and\r\nthe open avowal of his sentiments, the other section of his admirers\r\napplauded his courage, and paid a just tribute to his honesty. The\r\nmore dispassionate judgment of posterity has done ample justice to\r\nthe rectitude and magnanimity of this unfortunate nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe next victims to the offended laws were Donald Macdonald, of the\r\nKeppoch family, who had served as a captain in the regiment of that\r\nchief, Walter Ogilvy, a young man of good family in Banffshire, a\r\nlieutenant in Lord Lewis Gordon’s regiment, and James Nicolson, who\r\nhad kept a coffee-house in Leith. These three, with one Alexander\r\nMacgrowther, who also held a commission in the Highland army, were\r\ntaken at Carlisle. When brought to the bar of the court at St.\r\nMargaret’s-hill, the three first pleaded guilty, and begged for\r\nmercy; but Macgrowther attempted to defend himself on the ground that\r\nhe was forced into the insurrection by the Duke of Perth against his\r\nwill, having as a vassal no power to withstand the commands of his\r\nsuperior.[1288] This defence, corresponding in very many cases with\r\nreality, and which was also made by many of the Scotch prisoners, was\r\noverruled. On the 2d of August these four persons were condemned, and\r\nMacgrowther having been afterwards reprieved; the remainder suffered\r\non Kennington-common, on the 22d of the same month. Macdonald and\r\nNicolson were executed in their Highland dress. The same revolting\r\nprocess of disembowelling, &c., practised upon the bodies of Townley\r\nand his companions, was gone through; but the spectators were spared\r\nthe revolting spectacle, which was witnessed on that occasion, of\r\ncutting down the prisoners whilst alive.\r\n\r\nAt Perth, on the 19th of September, Captain Crosby, who had deserted\r\nfrom the British army in Flanders, and come to Scotland with the\r\nFrench troops, was hanged, and two deserters were shot. A singular\r\nincident happened on this occasion. To carry the sentence against\r\nCrosby into execution on the day appointed, the hangman of Perth\r\nwas secured in the town prison; but having apparently no certainty\r\nthat he would perform his painful duty, the hangman of Stirling was\r\nsent for by the magistrates, who, upon his appearance, liberated the\r\ntimorous functionary. The hangman immediately fled the place. Captain\r\nCrosby was brought to the place of execution on the appointed day,\r\nbut before the time for throwing him off arrived, the executioner\r\ndropt down dead. After remaining a considerable time at the place of\r\nexecution the guard was returning with Crosby to the prison, when\r\nan infamous criminal, who was a prisoner in the jail, offered to\r\nhang the captain for a reward of ten guineas and a free pardon. The\r\nauthorities having acceded to the demand of this ruffian, Crosby was\r\nimmediately carried back to the place of execution, and suffered with\r\ngreat fortitude.[1289]\r\n\r\nThe sittings at St. Margaret’s-hill were resumed on the 23d of\r\nAugust, and were continued from time to time for about two months.\r\nBills were found against thirty-two persons, besides Lord Macleod and\r\nSecretary Murray; but these last were not brought to trial. Of the\r\nthirty-two tried no less than twenty-two were convicted at different\r\ntimes, all of whom received sentence of death on the 15th of\r\nNovember. Of these, eight of the principal were ordered for execution\r\non the 28th of that month. Among these were Sir John Wedderburn, John\r\nHamilton, Andrew Wood, Alexander Leith, and James Bradshaw. Sir John\r\nWedderburn had acted as receiver in the counties of Perth and Angus\r\nof the ale and malt arrears raised by the Highland army; Hamilton\r\nhad been governor of Carlisle; Wood, a youth of two-and-twenty, had\r\ndistinguished himself as a volunteer in Roy Stewart’s regiment;\r\nLeith had served as a captain in the Duke of Perth’s regiment, and\r\nthough old and infirm, had been remarkable for zeal and activity; and\r\nBradshaw had shown his devotion to the cause of the Stuarts by giving\r\nup a lucrative business as a merchant in Manchester, and expending\r\nall his wealth to promote it. He entered the Manchester regiment; but\r\nthinking that he could be of more use by marching with the Highland\r\narmy into Scotland than by remaining at Carlisle, he joined Lord\r\nElcho’s corps, and was taken prisoner after the battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the execution two of the prisoners of the name of\r\nFarquharson and Watson obtained a reprieve, as also did one Lindsay,\r\njust as he was about to step into the sledge. The effect upon this\r\nman’s feelings, when his pardon was announced, was such, that his\r\nlife appeared for a time in danger. The five prisoners were then\r\ndrawn to the place of execution in two sledges, where their doom\r\nwas sealed. Bradshaw read a paper, in which he declared that he had\r\njoined “the king’s forces” from a principle of duty only, and that\r\nhe never had reason since to be convinced that he had been mistaken;\r\nbut that, on the contrary, every day’s experience had strengthened\r\nhis opinion that what he had done was right and necessary. He\r\nstated that he had had the misfortune to fall into the hands of\r\nthe most ungenerous enemy he believed ever assumed the name of a\r\nsoldier,--“the pretended duke of Cumberland, and those under his\r\ncommand,” whose inhumanity, he observed, had exceeded every thing he\r\ncould have imagined, “in a country where the name of a God is allowed\r\nof.” He expressed his firm conviction, that the order attributed to\r\nCharles to give no quarter was “a malicious, wicked report, raised by\r\nthe friends of the usurper” to excuse the cruelties committed by his\r\ntroops in Scotland. After a high eulogium upon the qualifications of\r\nthe prince, the paper concluded with a prayer for the preservation of\r\n“King James the Third, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York.”\r\n\r\nBesides the trials at Southwark, other trials took place at Carlisle\r\nand York, chiefly of prisoners taken at Culloden. No less than 382\r\nof these unfortunate beings had been brought to Carlisle; but as\r\nthe trial of such a great number of persons, with a view to capital\r\npunishment, might appear extremely harsh, and would be inconvenient,\r\na proposal was made to the common prisoners, who formed the great\r\nmass, that, with certain exceptions, only one in every twenty,\r\nchosen by lot, should be tried, and that the remainder should be\r\ntransported. This proposal was acceded to by a considerable number.\r\nBy this means the number for trial was reduced to 127, who were\r\nimmediately separated from the others, and with the exception of\r\ntwo--Sir Archibald Primrose and Captain Hay--thrust into one room in\r\nthe keep of the castle, where their miseries induced many to hatch\r\nfutile plots for escape.[1290]\r\n\r\nThe judges adjourned to the 9th of September; and, in the mean time,\r\nthey repaired to York, where the grand jury found bills against 75\r\npersons confined there. The judges resumed their sittings at Carlisle\r\nfor the trial of the prisoners there, on the 9th of September, on\r\nwhich, and the two following days, the prisoners, against whom bills\r\nhad been found, were arraigned. Bills were found against 15 more\r\non the 12th, making a total of 134. Of these, 11 pled guilty when\r\narraigned; 32 entered the same plea when brought to trial; 48 were\r\nfound guilty, of whom 11 were recommended to mercy, 36 acquitted,\r\n5 remanded to prison till further evidence should be procured, and\r\n1 obtained delay on an allegation of his being a peer. The judges\r\nresumed their sittings at York on the 2d of October, and sat till\r\nthe 7th. Of the 75 persons indicted, 2 pled guilty when arraigned,\r\n52 when brought to trial, and 16 were found guilty, 4 of whom were\r\nrecommended to mercy. All these received sentence of death. Five only\r\nwere acquitted.\r\n\r\nOf the 91 prisoners under sentence at Carlisle, 30 were ordered for\r\nexecution; 9 of whom were accordingly executed at Carlisle on the\r\n18th of October.[1291] Six were executed at Brampton on the 21st\r\nof the same month, and 7 suffered at Penrith. Seven out of the 30\r\nwere reprieved, and 1 died in prison. All those who were executed\r\nunderwent the usual process of unbowelling.\r\n\r\nAmong those who suffered at Carlisle on October 18th, were Major\r\nDonald Macdonald of Tynedrish--he who, short-sighted, unwittingly\r\nallowed himself to be made prisoner after the battle of Falkirk. He\r\nwas one of the first to join Prince Charles after his landing, and it\r\nis supposed that Sir Walter Scott had him in his mind, when he drew\r\nthe character of Fergus M’Ivor, in _Waverley_. Another was the brave\r\nand chivalrous laird of Kinloch-Moidart, described as a plain honest\r\nman, exceedingly cool-headed, and fitted for either the cabinet or\r\nthe field, but unable to resist the persuasions of his brother Æneas\r\nMacdonald, the Paris banker, who accompanied Charles to Scotland--and\r\nthe fascination which the prince seems to have exercised on those\r\nwhom he personally addressed. An acquaintance of Macdonald’s visited\r\nhim when he was confined a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, and asked\r\nhim how he came to engage in so desperate an undertaking, which\r\nnever had a probability of success? “I myself was against it,” he\r\nreplied; “but, Lord man, what could I do when the young lad came to\r\nmy house?”[1292]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November 10 of the prisoners condemned at York suffered\r\nin that city, and on the 8th of the same month, 11 others suffered\r\nthe same fate. Another prisoner suffered on the 15th November. The\r\nwork of death closed at Carlisle on the 15th of December by the\r\nimmolation of 11 more victims.\r\n\r\nOut of the 77 persons who thus suffered, it is remarkable that, with\r\nthe solitary exception of Lord Kilmarnock, they all maintained, to\r\nthe very last, the justice of the cause for which they suffered. The\r\nmore enthusiastic among them even openly declared that they would\r\ncontinue to support the claim of the exiled family to the crown if\r\nset at liberty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this useless waste of human blood, the government did\r\nnot consider the work of destruction complete till the lives of two\r\nindividuals, who lay more especially under its ban, were sacrificed,\r\nas the last atonement to public justice. These were Charles Ratcliffe\r\nand Lord Lovat. The former was a younger brother of the Earl of\r\nDerwentwater, who suffered in 1716, and whose title Mr. Ratcliffe\r\nhad assumed. He had been engaged in the former insurrection, taken\r\nat Preston, and condemned, but made his escape out of Newgate; and\r\nafter passing some years in France and Italy, married the Countess\r\nof Newburgh at Paris. He had visited England privately in 1733, and\r\nreturned again two years thereafter, when he appeared openly in\r\npublic. Soliciting his pardon without success, he returned to France,\r\nwhere he remained till November, 1745, when he was made prisoner on\r\nboard a French vessel, on her way to Scotland with supplies for\r\nPrince Charles. He was arraigned at the bar of the court of king’s\r\nbench on the 21st of November, 1746, upon his former sentence; but\r\nhe refused either to plead or to acknowledge the authority of the\r\ncourt, on the ground that he was a subject of France, where he had\r\nresided thirty years, and honoured with a commission in the service\r\nof his most Christian majesty. Being brought to the bar next day,\r\nhis former sentence being read over to him, he pleaded that he was\r\nnot the person therein mentioned; but his identity being clearly\r\nestablished, he was ordered to be executed on the 8th of December.\r\nHis aunt, Lady Petre, did every thing in her power to save him, or at\r\nleast to procure a respite till his lady should arrive from Paris,\r\nbut without success. Some demur seems, however, to have existed, as\r\nthe preparations for his execution were so long delayed, that the\r\ncarpenters were obliged to work on the scaffold on Sunday the day\r\nbefore the execution, and all the following night.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for his execution were somewhat the same as those\r\nin the cases of Kilmarnock and Balmerino. He was dressed in a suit\r\nof scarlet, faced with black velvet trimmed with gold, a gold-laced\r\nwaistcoat, and wore a white feather in his hat. When he came upon the\r\nscaffold he took a tender farewell of his friends, and after spending\r\nabout seven minutes in prayer on his knees, he rose, and pulling off\r\nhis clothes, went forward to the block, on which he placed his head\r\nto try how it fitted. He then spoke to the executioner as if giving\r\nhim directions, and kneeling down again, and fixing his head upon the\r\nblock, in about two minutes he gave the signal to the executioner,\r\nwho, as in the case of Balmerino, did not complete his work till he\r\nhad given the third blow. The head was received in a scarlet cloth.\r\nWithout the levity of Balmerino, Mr. Ratcliffe displayed the same\r\nmanly fortitude and contempt of death exhibited by that unfortunate\r\nnobleman. He died, as he had lived, a Catholic; and so warmly was\r\nhe attached to the faith of his ancestors, that when some zealous\r\nProtestant objected to him that some of the tenets of his religion\r\nwere contrary to reason, he is said to have wished, that for every\r\nsuch tenet, the belief of which was required by the church, there\r\nwere twenty, that he might have a larger field for exercising his\r\nfaith.[1293] His body was delivered over to his friends, and interred\r\nby them, on the 11th of November, at St. Giles’s-in-the-fields, near\r\nthe remains of his brother.\r\n\r\nThe last scene of this bloody tragedy ended with the trial and\r\nexecution of the aged Lord Lovat, who had been confined in the Tower\r\nsince the 15th of August. He was impeached by the House of Commons\r\non the 11th of December, and was brought to the bar of the House\r\nof Peers on the 18th, when the articles of impeachment were read\r\nto him.[1294] At his own desire, four gentlemen were assigned him\r\nfor counsel, and he was appointed to put in answers to the articles\r\nof impeachment on or before the 13th of January. The trial, which\r\nwas appointed to take place on the 23d of February, was postponed\r\nto the 5th, and afterwards to the 9th of March, on which day it\r\ncommenced. The articles of impeachment were in substance, that\r\nhe had compassed and imagined the death of the king,--that he\r\nhad corresponded with the Pretender, accepted a commission from\r\nhim to be a lieutenant-general of his forces, and another to be\r\ngeneral of the Highlanders, and that he had accepted a patent from\r\nthe Pretender creating him Duke of Fraser,--that he had met with\r\narmed traitors, and had raised great numbers of armed men for the\r\nservice of the Pretender and his son, and had traitorously levied\r\na cruel and unnatural war against his majesty,--that he had sent a\r\ntreasonable letter to the son of the Pretender when in arms within\r\nthe kingdom,--that he had also sent treasonable letters to other\r\npersons, then openly in arms against the king,--that he had assisted\r\nthe rebels in their traitorous designs, and had sent his eldest son,\r\nand many of his name, family, and dependents, to the assistance of\r\nthe Pretender’s eldest son, and had given them instructions in the\r\nprosecution of the rebellion,--and finally, that he had traitorously,\r\nboth in person and by letters, held correspondence with the eldest\r\nson of the Pretender, and with divers persons employed by him, and\r\nparticularly with Murray of Broughton, the two Lochiels, John Roy\r\nStewart, Dr. Cameron, and others. To all these charges Lord Lovat\r\ngave a pointed denial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simon, Lord Lovat.--(From Hogarth’s Picture.)]\r\n\r\nThey were, however, fully established by the strongest proofs. The\r\nwritten evidence consisted of papers found in his lordship’s strong\r\nbox, besides some letters which he had written to Prince Charles,\r\nthe last of which having come into the hands of Murray of Broughton,\r\nin his capacity of secretary to the prince, were basely delivered\r\nup by him to save his own worthless life. Lord Lovat exerted all\r\nhis ingenuity to evade the force of the evidence; but the proofs of\r\nhis criminality were too clear to admit of any doubt. His lordship\r\nobjected to the admissibility of Murray as a witness, on the ground\r\nthat he was attainted by act of parliament made in the previous\r\nsession, and that he had not surrendered himself in terms of the act.\r\nHaving stated that he had several objections against the witness, one\r\nor two of which he considered essential, a discussion ensued as to\r\nwhether all these objections should not at once be stated. As giving\r\na fair sample of the manner in which the trial was conducted, the\r\nargument on both sides, on the point alluded to, is here given:--\r\n\r\n  “MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.--My lords, I observe that the noble lord\r\n  at the bar said that he had several objections to the examining\r\n  this witness, and that one or two of them were essential; but\r\n  the noble lord has not mentioned more than one. I presume, my\r\n  lords, it would be proper that he should name all his objections\r\n  at once, that the managers may have an opportunity of answering\r\n  them all, and receiving your lordships’ judgment upon the whole;\r\n  therefore, if he has any other objections to offer, it would\r\n  be proper he should mention them now to your lordships. LORD\r\n  LOVAT.--My lords, I submit it to your lordships that that is a\r\n  very odd proposition. I give your lordships an essential one now,\r\n  and when that is answered I have another. I am not to be directed\r\n  by those who are my _persecutors_. LORD-HIGH-STEWARD.--My Lord\r\n  Lovat, you are not to be directed by your accusers, but by the\r\n  lords who are your judges; and the course of proceeding in this\r\n  and all other courts is, that a person, who objects to any\r\n  witness, should name all his objections at the same time; and\r\n  it is the more material in this court, as it tends to prevent\r\n  the trouble of making several unnecessary adjournments. LORD\r\n  L.--My lords, as this objection is very essential, I pray that\r\n  it may be answered before I make another. LORD TALBOT.--If this\r\n  is a material objection to the witness, then there will be no\r\n  occasion for any other; but if it is an immaterial one, then your\r\n  lordships may go into any other; but the way proposed by the\r\n  managers may be very detrimental to the unhappy person at the\r\n  bar. LORD H. S.--Your lordships hear what is proposed; and the\r\n  question is, whether the noble lord at the bar shall name all his\r\n  objections now, or take them up one by one. SIR WILLIAM YONGE,\r\n  (one of the managers from the commons.)--My lords, I should hope\r\n  that, in any course of proceeding, where objections of this kind\r\n  are made, they should be made all together; for if they are made\r\n  separate, we must consequently make distinct answers to them all,\r\n  which may oblige your lordships to adjourn often to the chamber\r\n  of parliament, which will create a great and unnecessary delay\r\n  of time: and my lords, there can be no objection to his naming\r\n  the whole at once, since they will all be distinctly considered\r\n  by your lordships, and undoubtedly receive distinct answers.\r\n  I therefore humbly insist, that he may be obliged to name all\r\n  his objections at once. MR. NOEL, (another manager.)--My lords,\r\n  what we are now upon is no point of law at all: it is simply,\r\n  whether the noble lord at the bar as is usual should not name all\r\n  his objections at once? When he does name them, then to such as\r\n  are clear points of law he must be heard by his counsel; but at\r\n  present, my lords, we are upon a question concerning the course\r\n  of proceeding, whether he shall name them all at once, that they\r\n  may be taken into consideration at the same time? My lords, one\r\n  thing struck me in a very extraordinary manner:--It was said by\r\n  the noble lord at the bar, that he was not to be directed by his\r\n  _persecutors_. My lords, we are no persecutors; we persecute\r\n  no man; we are intrusted by the commons, who carry on this\r\n  prosecution against the noble lord at the bar for treason, and\r\n  we prosecute for the preservation of the king’s government and\r\n  the laws of the land. LORD L.--My lords, I said I was not to be\r\n  directed by those who accused me. Your lordships cannot expect\r\n  I can say what I have to offer in an eloquent manner. My lords,\r\n  should the saving of a little time be a reason for taking away\r\n  a person’s life? I hope these will not act like the parricides\r\n  who took off the head of both kingdoms in a day by their\r\n  prosecution. I am a peer of this land, and I think no excuse of\r\n  saving time should be allowed as a reason to destroy me. LORD H.\r\n  S.--My Lord Lovat, the lords will use all the deliberation, and\r\n  give you all the time that is requisite for your defence; but I\r\n  must beg your lordship will have so much consideration as to keep\r\n  your temper, and not suffer yourself to be hurried into passion,\r\n  for that may greatly prejudice you in making your defence. Your\r\n  lordship will find the advantage in your defence by keeping your\r\n  temper. LORD L.--I give your lordship my humble thanks: and since\r\n  your lordships will not allow me counsel, I have spoke the little\r\n  nonsense I had to say; but now your lordships shall hear me say\r\n  nothing out of temper. LORD H. S.--My Lord Lovat, the question\r\n  now is, whether you shall name all your objections at once? I\r\n  must acquaint your lordship that that is the rule in the courts\r\n  below, that if several objections are made to a witness, they are\r\n  all named at once, in order to prevent unnecessary delays. LORD\r\n  L.--My lords, to show how much I desire to save time, though,\r\n  according to the course of nature, my time can be but short,\r\n  I am so far from desiring to give your lordships trouble, or\r\n  to prolong time, that I do insist upon this objection to the\r\n  witness, and rely upon it as the only material objection.”[1295]\r\n\r\nThe managers having offered to prove, by the record of the court of\r\nKing’s bench, that Mr. Murray had surrendered himself within the time\r\nprescribed, the question whether the record should be received in\r\nevidence, was argued at great length by the counsel for Lord Lovat,\r\nand the managers on the part of the prosecution. Having decided that\r\nthe record might be read and given in evidence, Lord Lovat offered to\r\nfalsify the record, by proving, in opposition to the averment therein\r\ncontained, that Mr. Murray had not surrendered himself as required by\r\nthe act of parliament. The court, however, decided that the record of\r\nthe court of King’s bench, which was, nevertheless, literally untrue,\r\ncould not be falsified by oral evidence.\r\n\r\nBeing called upon to make his defence on the sixth day of the trial,\r\nLovat gave in a long paper, in which he commented with great\r\nseverity upon the witnesses, whose testimony he maintained was not to\r\nbe credited. He designated Secretary Murray as “the most abandoned\r\nof mankind, who, forgetting his allegiance to his king and country,\r\nhad, according to his own confession, endeavoured to destroy both,\r\nlike another Catiline, to patch up a broken fortune upon the ruin\r\nand distress of his native country. To-day stealing into France to\r\nenter into engagements upon the most sacred oath of fidelity; soon\r\nafter, like a sanguinary monster, putting his hand and seal to a\r\nbloody proclamation, full of rewards for the apprehending of the\r\nsacred person of his majesty, and lest the cup of his iniquity had\r\nnot been filled, to sum up all in one, impudently appearing at their\r\nlordships’ bar to betray those very secrets which he confessed he\r\nhad drawn from the person he called his lord, his prince and master,\r\nunder the strongest confidence.” “Thus far,” he concluded, “I thought\r\nit my duty, in vindication of myself, to trouble your lordships,\r\nand without further trespassing upon your patience, freely submit\r\nmy life, my fortune, my honour, and what is dearest of all, my\r\nposterity, to your lordships.”[1296]\r\n\r\nAfter the managers for the prosecution had addressed the court, Lord\r\nLovat was withdrawn from the bar. The whole peers present--117 in\r\nnumber--unanimously found his lordship guilty. Lord Lovat was then\r\ncalled back to the bar, and informed by the lord-high-steward of\r\nthe judgment of the court. Being brought up next day to receive his\r\nsentence, he addressed the court in a long speech, in which he gave a\r\nrambling recital of his services to the house of Hanover; and after\r\nreceiving sentence, he implored their lordships and the managers of\r\nthe commons to recommend him to the mercy of his majesty. Before\r\nleaving the bar, he said, “God bless you all, and I bid you an\r\neverlasting farewell. We shall not meet all in the same place again.\r\nI am sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“The public were ravenous with curiosity about the great Leviathan\r\nthat had been at last so effectually hooked, and it was necessary\r\nto fill the ear of London with details of his previous history,\r\nas well as anecdotes of his conduct since his capture. Many of\r\nthem are fabulous, and many not worth preserving, but a few are\r\ntoo characteristic to be passed over. They may be announced by an\r\nincident not mentioned in the contemporary accounts, but preserved\r\nby tradition. On his return from the House of Lords to the Tower,\r\nan old woman not very well favoured, had pressed through the crowd\r\nand screamed in at the window of the coach, ‘You’ll get that nasty\r\nhead of yours chopped off, you ugly old Scotch dog,’ to which he\r\nanswered, ‘I believe I shall, you ugly old English b----,’ paying\r\nher back with the feminine of the masculine epithet she had applied\r\nto him. The major of the Tower coming to visit him and ask how he\r\ndid, he answered, ‘Why, I am about doing pretty well, for I am\r\npreparing myself, sir, for a place where hardly any majors, and very\r\nfew lieutenant-generals go;’ this was a more distinct hint than that\r\ngiven to the House of Lords.”[1297]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of April the sheriffs of London and Middlesex received a\r\nwarrant for his execution, which was appointed to take place on the\r\n9th. His lordship, it is said, petitioned the king that he might be\r\ndespatched by the maiden, the Scottish instrument of decapitation;\r\nbut his application was not attended to. His approaching fate did\r\nnot in the least discompose him, and though in the eightieth year of\r\nhis age, his spirits never flagged, nor was his natural vivacity in\r\nany degree diminished. He said, the day before his execution, that\r\nhe was never at any time in better spirits; and he told Dr. Clark,\r\nhis physician, that the Tower was a better recipe for upholding them\r\nthan the emetics he used to give him.[1298] Though regardless of\r\ndeath, and even occasionally facetious on the circumstances of his\r\ncoming exit, he was not indifferent to the consolations of religion,\r\nand cheerfully availed himself of the spiritual assistance of a\r\nCatholic priest. Early on the morning of the execution, 1,200 troops\r\ndrew up on Tower-hill, and all the preparations were gone through\r\nas in the former instances. About an hour before the execution, a\r\nserious accident occurred, in consequence of the fall of a large\r\nscaffolding with 400 persons, by which eighteen were killed on the\r\nspot, and many bruised and crippled. When Lovat heard of it his\r\ncool remark was,[1299] “The more mischief the better sport.” When\r\nhe arrived at the scaffold, Lovat was obliged, from infirmity, to\r\nobtain the assistance of two persons in mounting. He displayed, to\r\nthe very last, his characteristic fortitude, or rather bravado, and,\r\nwith great coolness, felt the edge of the axe, with the sharpness of\r\nwhich he declared himself satisfied. On looking round and observing\r\nthe great crowd, he said, “God save us,--why should there be such\r\na bustle about taking off an old gray head that cannot get up three\r\nsteps without two men to support it.”[1300] He gave the executioner\r\nten guineas, advised him to perform his duty firmly, and take a\r\ngood aim, and told him that if he mangled his shoulders, he would\r\nbe displeased with him. In conversation he used frequently to cite\r\npassages from the classics; and, on the present occasion, he repeated\r\nthe celebrated saying of Horace,--“_Dulce et decorum est pro patria\r\nmori_,” as peculiarly applicable to the cause for which he was about\r\nto suffer. After spending some time in devotion, this remarkable man\r\nlaid his head down upon the block with the utmost composure, and the\r\nexecutioner struck it off at a single blow. His lordship had given\r\ndirections that his body should be carried to Scotland, and his\r\nfriends had removed it to an undertaker’s in the Strand preparatory\r\nto its being sent down; but, by order of government, it was interred\r\nat St. Peter’s in the Tower, in the same grave with Lords Kilmarnock\r\nand Balmerino.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A REPRESENTATION _of the Execution of Lord Lovat._\r\n\r\n  A _The Scaffold._\r\n\r\n  B _Lord Lovat’s Head on y^e Block._\r\n\r\n  C. _Cloth to receive the Head._\r\n\r\n  D. _The Executioner with y^e Axe._\r\n\r\n  E. _The Coffin._\r\n\r\n  F. _The House from which he came on the Scaffold._\r\n\r\nPhototype _fac-simile_ from a rare contemporary print in the possession\r\nof James Drummond, Esq., R.S.A.]\r\n\r\nWhilst these executions could not fail to impress the disaffected\r\nwith a strong idea of the power and inclination of government to\r\nuphold and maintain the authority of the law, they were calculated\r\nby their number and severity rather to excite a thirst for\r\nvengeance, than to inspire that salutary fear which it is the object\r\nof punishment to promote. During these executions, a scheme was\r\nconcocted to arrest the arm of the law by seizing and carrying off\r\nthe person of the Duke of Cumberland, and retaining him as a hostage\r\nfor the lives of the prisoners. The originators of this bold design\r\nwent from London to Paris, and laid their plan before Charles shortly\r\nafter his arrival from Scotland, and offered to make the attempt; but\r\nCharles refused to sanction it, and the scheme was dropped.[1301]\r\n\r\nBy way of conciliating the offended feelings of the nation, the\r\ngovernment got an act of indemnity passed in June, 1747, granting a\r\npardon, with certain exceptions, to all persons who had been engaged\r\nin the rebellion; but these exceptions were so numerous as to divest\r\nthe act of all pretensions to the character of grace or favour.\r\nBesides all persons attainted of high treason by act of parliament\r\nor judgment, or conviction of high treason by verdict, confession,\r\nor otherwise, upwards of eighty persons were specially excepted by\r\nname.[1302]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1283] Shenstone has commemorated this melancholy event in his\r\nplaintive ballad of ‘Jemmy Dawson.’\r\n\r\n[1284] _Carlisle in ’45_, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[1285] “He is,” says Walpole, “the most natural, brave old fellow I\r\never saw: the highest intrepidity, even to indifference. At the bar\r\nhe behaved like a soldier and a man; in the intervals of form, with\r\ncarelessness and humour.... At the bar he plays with his fingers\r\nupon the axe, while he talks to the gentleman gaoler; and one day,\r\nsomebody coming up to listen, he took the blade and held it like a\r\nfan between their faces. During the trial a little boy was near him,\r\nbut not tall enough to see; he made room for the child, and placed\r\nhim near himself.”\r\n\r\n[1286] As will be seen, the more barbarous and ignominious part of\r\nthe sentence was not carried into effect; Kilmarnock and Balmerino\r\nwere put to death by simple decapitation.\r\n\r\n[1287] The original of the above letter, from which this copy was\r\ntaken, is among the _Stuart Papers_, and is written in a remarkably\r\nbold and steady hand. The Chevalier sent a copy of this letter to\r\nCharles on 20th January, 1747. “I send you,” says he, “a copy of poor\r\nLord Balmerino’s letter. I shall inquire about his widow, and send\r\nher some relief if she stands in need of it.”--_Stuart Papers._ James\r\nwas as good as his word. See Mr. Theodore Hay’s letter to Secretary\r\nEdgar, of 10th June, 1747, and Lady Balmerino’s receipt, 18th May\r\nfollowing, for £60, in the _Stuart Papers_. The letter of Lord\r\nBalmerino, and the circumstances of his death, are feelingly alluded\r\nto in a letter written by Lady Balmerino to the Chevalier, from\r\nEdinburgh, on 15th June, 1751:--“Before my dear lord’s execution,\r\nhe leaving this world, and having no other concern in time but me,\r\nwrote a letter to your Majesty, dated 17th August, 1746, recommending\r\nme and my destitute condition to your Majesty’s commiseration\r\nand bounty. You are well informed of his undaunted courage and\r\nbehaviour at his death, so that even your Majesty’s enemies and his\r\ndo unanimously confess that he died like a hero, and asserted and\r\nadded a lustre which never will be forgot to the undoubted right your\r\nMajesty has to your three realms. He had the honour to have been in\r\nyour Majesty’s domestick service in Italy, and ever preserved, before\r\nhis last appearance, an inviolable, constant attachment to your royal\r\nhouse and interest, which at last he not only confirmed by his dying\r\nwords, but sealed it with his blood, than which a greater token and\r\nproof it is not of a subject to give of his love and fidelity to his\r\nsovereign.”\r\n\r\n[1288] “The general plea and defence of the prisoners at Carlisle was\r\nthat they were _forced_ into the rebellion--_i.e._, they were put\r\nunder influences by clanship and such like, morally equivalent to\r\nforce.”--_Carlisle in ’45_, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[1289] True Copies of the Papers wrote by Arthur Lord Balmerino and\r\nothers, published in the year 1746.\r\n\r\n[1290] _Carlisle in ’45_, p. 247-50.\r\n\r\n[1291] One of them, Cappock, (created Bishop of Carlisle by Charles,)\r\nmade a long speech in support of the claims of the house of Stuart.\r\nHe prayed for “King James,” Prince Charles, and the rest of the\r\nStuart family, called King George an usurper, and when found guilty,\r\nhe thus addressed his fellow-prisoners at the bar:--“Never mind it,\r\nmy boys; for if our Saviour was here, these fellows would condemn\r\nhim.” Observing Brand extremely dejected, he said to him, “What the\r\ndevil are you afraid of? We shan’t be tried by a Cumberland jury in\r\nthe other world.”--_Scots Mag._ vol. viii. p. 498.\r\n\r\n[1292] _Carlisle in ’45_, pp. 254 and 266.\r\n\r\n[1293] Boyse, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[1294] The Laird of Macleod, in a letter to Lord-president Forbes,\r\ndated 18th December, 1746, says, “I saw unhappy Lovat to-day. Except\r\nfor the feebleness of his limbs, his looks are good. He asked me\r\nseveral general questions, and particularly about you;--said he was\r\nresigned, and ready to meet his fate, since it was God’s will;--asked\r\nafter his children, &c.” In another letter to the president, written\r\ntwo days thereafter, he again alludes to his lordship:--“Lovat\r\nbehaved well at the bar of the house of peers, and they say with\r\nspirit. Granville and Bath spoke very strongly with regard to the\r\nseizure of his estate and effects; and that matter is ordered to\r\nbe rectified, except in so far as private creditors come in the\r\nway.” Sir Andrew Mitchell, however, who was more of a courtier than\r\nMacleod, viewed matters in a different light. In a letter to the\r\npresident, 26th December, 1746, he remarks, “Your lordship will have\r\nheard an account of Lord Lovat’s behaviour; and, therefore, I shall\r\nnot trouble you with the particulars; only, I must observe, there was\r\nneither dignity nor gravity in it: he appeared quite unconcerned; and\r\nwhat he said was ludicrous and buffoonish; but his petition for the\r\nrestoration of his effects, &c., was bold and well worded; which,\r\nhowever, would have been passed over without notice, had not Lord\r\nGranville bounced, and Lord Bath vapoured, and procured an order to\r\nbe entered in the Journals, and have by that acquired to themselves\r\na sort of popularity, which you know they very much wanted. No Scots\r\nnobleman spoke on this occasion; they are prudent and cautious. God\r\nbless them!”--_Culloden Papers._\r\n\r\n[1295] Trial published by order of the House of Peers. London, 1747.\r\n\r\n[1296] He made several appeals calculated to move commiseration\r\nfor his grey hairs. “My lords,” he said, at the commencement, “I\r\nhave not had the use of my limbs these three years; I cannot see,\r\nI cannot hear; and I beg, if your lordships have a mind I should\r\nhave any chance of my life, that you will allow either my counsel\r\nor solicitors to examine my witnesses, and to cross-examine those\r\nproduced on behalf of the crown, and to take notes.” If he had been\r\ntried, on the charges brought against him, in Scotland forty-six\r\nyears earlier, he would have been allowed this privilege; but the\r\nrules of English law confined the assistance of counsel, in cases of\r\ntreason, to purely legal questions. At the conclusion of the second\r\nday he complained of the hardships of the early daily attendance\r\nto one of his infirm constitution, and said, “I must therefore beg\r\nthat your lordships will indulge me with a later hour and some\r\nrespite; otherwise I shall die at your bar,” but the request seems\r\nto have been unheeded. Another appeal of the same description, in\r\nwhich he said, “I fainted away thrice this morning before I came up\r\nto your lordships’ bar; but yet was determined to show my respect\r\nto your lordships, or die upon the spot,” produced a respite of a\r\nday.--Burton’s _Life of Lovat_, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[1297] Burton’s _Lovat_, pp. 262, 263.\r\n\r\n[1298] _Culloden Papers_, p. 302.\r\n\r\n[1299] Burton’s _Lovat_, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[1300] Burton’s _Lovat_, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[1301] Vide Letter in the _Stuart Papers_ from the Rev.

He was met near Paris on the 15th of\r\nOctober, (N. S.,[1303]) by his brother and a considerable number\r\nof the nobility, who conducted him to his appointed residence.\r\nThe meeting between the two brothers, who had not seen each other\r\nfor nearly three years, was of a most affecting description, and\r\nthe persons who were present declared that they had never before\r\nwitnessed such a moving scene. Charles at first sight did not know\r\nHenry, but the latter at once knew the prince, who is described by\r\nhis brother as not in the least altered in his appearance since\r\nhe last saw him, only that he had “grown somewhat broader and\r\nfatter.”[1304]\r\n\r\nLouis with his court was at this time residing at Fontainebleau, and\r\nas Charles was impatient to see him, he sent Colonel Warren thither\r\nwith instructions to Colonel O’Brien, the accredited minister of\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George at the court of France, to request an\r\naudience. Some difficulties were started at first by the French\r\nministers on the subject of this demand, but the king at last\r\nconsented to see Charles and his brother, but stipulated that they\r\nshould preserve a sort of incognito.[1305] Louis in fact had become\r\ntired of the war, and that he might not widen the breach between him\r\nand the court of London by appearing to recognise the pretensions\r\nof the exiled family, he had resolved not to receive the sons of\r\nthe Chevalier at his court as princes of England. James, who was\r\nfully aware of this policy of the French court, thus argues the\r\nmatter with Charles, who naturally felt indignant at the mode of his\r\nreception; “I am far from saying but that the king of France might\r\nhave done a great deal more for you; but after all, we must consider\r\nthe vast expenses he is at during the war, and the system he has\r\ncertainly laid down to himself of not treating you and your brother\r\nas princes of England, which system I own shocked me at first, and\r\nseems preposterous in the present situation of affairs; but when one\r\nconsiders the uncertainty of the events of war, and that if we are\r\nnot restored before a peace, the king of France cannot but continue\r\nto acknowledge the elector of Hanover as king of England, and by\r\nconsequence treat us no more as princes of England; we cannot but own\r\nthat it is wise in him, and in a certain sense even kind to us, not\r\nto expose himself and us to a possibility and necessity of ceasing to\r\ntreat us according to our birth, after having once done it.”[1306]\r\n\r\nIf Louis had been actuated by the motive thus charitably imputed to\r\nhim, the reasoning of James would have been plausible enough; but\r\nCharles, who had both before and during his expedition experienced\r\nthe hollowness of the French policy, could not fail to perceive that\r\nhis father had formed an erroneous idea of Louis’s intentions. As by\r\nthe treaty of Fontainebleau he had been recognised by that monarch as\r\nprince regent of Scotland, Charles had good reason to complain of the\r\nmode in which he was to be received by his most Christian majesty;\r\nbut he repressed his feelings of disappointment on the occasion, and\r\nyielded to a necessity which it was not in his power to control. He\r\nresolved, however, to neutralize the effect which his appearance at\r\ncourt as a private person might have upon the people by getting up a\r\nsplendid equipage, and proceeding to Fontainebleau in great state.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the day fixed for his reception at court, Charles\r\nleft the castle of St. Antoine, accompanied by a number of his\r\nfriends in coaches and on horseback. The _cortege_ was on the whole\r\nvery grand; but Charles himself attracted particular attention by\r\nthe superbness of his dress. His coat was of rose-coloured velvet,\r\nembroidered with silver, and lined with silver tissue. His waistcoat\r\nwas of rich gold brocade, with a spangled fringe set out in scollops.\r\nThe cockade in his hat and the buckles of his shoes were studded with\r\ndiamonds. The George at his bosom, and the order of St. Andrew, which\r\nhe wore at one of the button-holes of his waistcoat, were illustrated\r\nwith large diamonds. “In fine,” observes an enthusiastic eye-witness,\r\n“he glittered all over like the star which they tell you appeared\r\nat his nativity.” Louis received Charles with great kindness, and,\r\nembracing him, said, “My dearest Prince, I thank Heaven for the very\r\ngreat pleasure it gives me to see you returned in good health after\r\nso many fatigues and dangers. You have proved that all the great\r\nqualities of the heroes and philosophers are united in you, and I\r\nhope that you will one day receive the reward of such extraordinary\r\nmerit.” The queen, likewise, welcomed him with every demonstration\r\nof good-will and affection. He had never been at the court of France\r\nbefore, and every person was extremely desirous of seeing a prince of\r\nwhom they had heard so much. As Charles retired from the palace, the\r\nwhole court crowded about him, and complimented him so highly upon\r\nthe fame of his exploits, that they could scarcely have testified\r\ngreater joy, or expressed themselves in warmer terms, had the dauphin\r\nhimself been engaged in the same dangerous expedition, and returned\r\nfrom it in safety.[1307] Charles, it is said, afterwards returned to\r\nthe palace, and supped with the king, queen, and royal family; and\r\nall his attendants were magnificently entertained at several tables,\r\nwhich had been appointed for them according to their rank.\r\n\r\nThough the conduct of the French court towards Charles had been\r\ndeceptive, yet it is understood that Louis was not so bad as\r\nhis ministers in this respect; and besides, he appears to have\r\nentertained a warm regard for Charles personally. It is believed that\r\nLouis would have given proofs of his esteem by embarking with spirit\r\nin the cause of the exiled family; but he was controlled by his\r\nministers, who certainly never were serious in their professions. Of\r\nthe sincerity of the queen, however, there cannot be the least doubt.\r\nShe and Charles’s mother had passed many of their juvenile years\r\ntogether, and had contracted a warm attachment to each other, which\r\nhad remained unaltered during the life of the latter. In Charles she\r\nnow beheld the favourite son of her late friend, whom he strongly\r\nresembled, and she looked upon him with a maternal tenderness, which\r\nwas enhanced by the reputation of his exploits, and the knowledge of\r\nthe sufferings he had endured. Whenever he came to court, she is said\r\nto have conversed with him for whole hours together, during which she\r\nwould make him relate his adventures to herself and her ladies, all\r\nof whom were frequently bathed in tears with the affecting recital.\r\n\r\nWithin a day or two after his arrival at Fontainebleau, Charles wrote\r\nto Louis requesting the honour of a private audience on the subject\r\nof his affairs, which appears to have been granted, as three days\r\nthereafter, namely, on the 25th of October, the prince requested\r\nanother interview, for the purpose of delivering into the king’s own\r\nhands a short memoir in relation to his affairs.[1308] Unable to\r\nobtain a satisfactory answer, Charles left Fontainebleau, and took\r\nup his residence with his brother at Clichy, in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis. His company was much sought after by the fashionable circles\r\nof that gay metropolis, but he kept himself comparatively retired.\r\nHe appeared at the opera for the first time on the 30th of October,\r\nand was received by the audience with clapping of hands, which\r\ncontinued till the commencement of the opera, and was renewed at the\r\nconclusion.[1309]\r\n\r\nThough surrounded by men of integrity, who had suffered proscription\r\nfor his sake, Charles does not appear to have consulted any of them\r\nin his difficulties, nor to have honoured them with the least share\r\nof his confidence. Shortly after his return to France he wrote to\r\nhis tutor, Sir Thomas Sheridan, who, after escaping to France, had\r\nrepaired to Rome, requesting him to join him at Paris; and in the\r\nmeantime he availed himself of the equivocal services of George\r\nKelly. Sir Thomas, however, saw Charles no more, having died soon\r\nafter the receipt of his pupil’s letter. Charles then adopted Kelly\r\nas his confidant, but he appears to have been in every way unworthy\r\nof such a mark of distinction.[1310]\r\n\r\nSome time after Charles’s return to Paris, Louis removed his court\r\nfrom Fontainebleau to Versailles, where the prince and his brother\r\nmet with a cordial reception from the royal family and the persons\r\nabout the court, but Charles could not obtain any distinct pledge of\r\nsupport. This result was anticipated by his father, who had a just\r\nperception of the policy of France in his regard. “I am afraid,”\r\nsays James to the prince, “that you will have little reason to be\r\nsatisfied with the court of France, and that you will not have less\r\nneed of courage and fortitude in bearing and suffering in that\r\ncountry than you had in acting in Britain.” Apprehensive of the\r\nimpetuosity of Charles’s temper, he most earnestly recommended him\r\nto conduct himself with patience and prudence, and warned him of the\r\nconsequences which might ensue by adopting a different course. This\r\nadmonition, however, was thrown away upon Charles.\r\n\r\nResolved to put the sincerity of the French court to the test,\r\nCharles presented a memorial to Louis on the state of his affairs.\r\nIn this paper he drew the attention of the French king to Scotland,\r\nwhich he represented as on the eve of destruction; and he stated,\r\nthat as the government appeared resolved to confound the innocent\r\nwith the guilty, it was reasonable to conclude that the discontent\r\nof the nation would be general, and that if he was enabled to enter\r\nupon another enterprise the number of his adherents would be tripled.\r\nHe also stated that he would be deceiving his most Christian majesty\r\nwere he to say that he could again subdue Scotland after his friends\r\nhad been destroyed, and that if the opportunity was then lost the\r\nking of France might for ever renounce any expected aid to his arms\r\nby a revolution in that country,--that he had always had numerous\r\npartisans in Scotland, though he had never had a sufficient supply\r\neither of money, provisions, or regular troops, and that if he had\r\nbeen well provided with only one of these three helps, he would still\r\nhave been master of Scotland, and probably also of England,--that\r\nif he had had three thousand regular troops he would have penetrated\r\ninto England immediately after the battle of Preston, and as George\r\nII. was then absent from the kingdom, and the English troops in\r\nFlanders, he could have marched to London without opposition,--that\r\nhad he been supplied with provisions he could have pursued General\r\nHawley after the battle of Falkirk, and destroyed all his army,\r\nwhich was the flower of the British troops. Finally, that if he had\r\nreceived two months earlier only the half of the money which his\r\nmajesty had sent him, he would have fought the Duke of Cumberland on\r\nequal terms, and he would certainly have beaten him, since with four\r\nthousand men only he had kept victory in suspense, though opposed by\r\nan army of twelve thousand. Having thus stated the causes to which\r\nthe failure of his expedition was owing, Charles proposed that Louis\r\nshould furnish an army of eighteen or twenty thousand men, which he\r\nstated he would employ usefully for their mutual interests, which he\r\nconsidered inseparable.[1311]\r\n\r\nCharles appears to have conducted himself, hitherto, with great\r\nmoderation; but as no notice was taken of his demand for troops,\r\nhe grew violent and imperious. The French ministry had, by order\r\nof Louis, granted a sum of sixty-two thousand nine hundred livres\r\nfor the relief of such of Charles’s adherents as had arrived in\r\nFrance,[1312] and Louis himself now offered him a pension suitable to\r\nhis rank; but he refused to accept it. James, who was fully informed\r\nof the circumstances of Charles’s behaviour, thus expostulates with\r\nhim:--“The truth is, I dread your feeling severely one day the\r\nconsequence of your present conduct towards the court of France;\r\nfor although, on account of the obligations they owe you, they may,\r\nout of a certain prudence and policy dissemble for a time, yet by\r\ngaining the ill-will of those ministers, and by carrying things too\r\nhigh, you will sooner or later certainly feel the bad effects of it;\r\nwhereas, had you received what the king of France lately offered\r\nyou, it was still putting yourself in the possession of feeling the\r\neffects of his generosity, and you would have probably got much more\r\nin time in some shape or another.”[1313] Count D’Argenson also was\r\nvery complaisant to Charles; but James cautioned him not to infer\r\ntherefrom, that his conduct was approved of by that minister.\r\n\r\nWaiting upwards of two months, and receiving no answer to his\r\nmemorial, Charles addressed a letter to Louis on the 12th of January,\r\nin which, after alluding to the favours his majesty had granted to\r\nhis companions in misfortune, which he regarded as a new proof of his\r\nmajesty’s generosity towards his family, he stated that his object in\r\ncoming to the court of France was to propose a plan of an expedition,\r\nwhich would be much more advantageous for both parties than the\r\nformer;--that this object alone occupied all his thoughts, and that\r\nevery other step which had been proposed to the king of France to\r\npromote his personal interests, had been done without his sanction.\r\nHe concluded a longish letter, written in his usual loud style, by\r\ntelling Louis that as he could not appear in the way in which he was\r\npersuaded his majesty wished in his own heart to see him, he would\r\nretire to some place where his present condition would be of less\r\nconsequence, and where he would be always ready to concur with the\r\nking of France in such steps as might contribute to his glory, and\r\nthe restoration of his family to their just rights, and he trusted\r\nhis majesty would approve of his resolution. He added, that if,\r\nduring his absence, the king of France should find it convenient to\r\nthink seriously of another expedition, he would immediately return\r\nto the court on being informed of his majesty’s wish, and that, in\r\nthe meantime, he would appoint a person at Paris who had his entire\r\nconfidence to negotiate in his behalf with the king of France and his\r\nministers.[1314]\r\n\r\nAs neither Louis nor his ministers had any intention of entering\r\ninto Charles’s views, they must have been well pleased with his\r\ndetermination to retire from Paris, where his presence had become\r\nexceedingly annoying; but some of his adherents regarded such a step\r\nwith different feelings, as they thought it would be highly injurious\r\nto his interests. Among those who took an active part in opposing\r\nthis resolution, was young Lochiel. No man was more firmly bent upon\r\nanother attempt than this high-minded chief, and instead of thinking\r\nwith Charles, that no expedition should be undertaken without a large\r\nforce, he was for accepting any succours that could be obtained.\r\nSome time after his arrival at Paris, he had opened a correspondence\r\nwith the Chevalier de St. George, in which he represented to him\r\nthat the misfortunes which had befallen his cause, though great,\r\nwere not irretrievable, provided timely measures were adopted for\r\nchecking the depopulating system which the English government seemed\r\nto have adopted. He stated that the ruin of the Scottish adherents\r\nof the exiled family would dispirit their friends in England so\r\nmuch, that a restoration would become extremely difficult, if not\r\nimpracticable, and that, at best, it could only be effected by an\r\narmy superior to all the forces of the government; whereas, if ten\r\nregiments only were landed in Scotland before the Highlands were\r\ndepopulated, not the Highlanders merely, but all other Scotchmen of\r\nspirit would unite in their support, and give so much employment\r\nto the troops of the government, that the English Jacobites might,\r\nwith little assistance, be in a condition to shake off the yoke. He,\r\ntherefore, advised the Chevalier to accept of whatever succours might\r\nbe offered. Acting upon principles of the purest disinterestedness,\r\nLochiel was opposed to every proposal which might seem to imply an\r\nabandonment of the cause which he had espoused, and when informed by\r\nCharles that an application had been made to the French court for\r\na regiment to Lord Ogilvy, he told him that he disapproved of it,\r\nas such an application might make the court of France regard the\r\naffairs of the exiled family to be more desperate than they really\r\nwere, and might prevent them from granting a body of troops for a new\r\nexpedition. Charles seemed to concur in this view; but Lord Ogilvy\r\nhaving obtained a regiment, Charles proposed to ask one for Lochiel\r\nalso. He objected, however, to the application being made, and told\r\nhis royal highness that Lord Ogilvy, or others, might incline to make\r\na figure in France, but that his ambition was to serve his country,\r\nor perish with it. Charles remarked that he was doing every thing\r\nin his power to forward his cause, and persisting in his resolution\r\nto procure a regiment for his faithful friend, Lochiel consented\r\nto accept of it if obtained, from respect to the prince, though he\r\ndeclared his determination to share the fate of the people he had\r\nundone, and if they were to be sacrificed to the vengeance of the\r\ngovernment, to fall along with them.[1315] Lochiel now endeavoured\r\nto persuade Charles to remain at Paris, and represented to him the\r\nbad consequences that might ensue to his affairs by retiring; but his\r\nresolution was fixed.\r\n\r\nCharles had in fact resolved to pay a visit to the king of Spain,\r\nand his retirement to Avignon, whither he announced his intention to\r\nproceed, was a mere blind to conceal his design from the court of\r\nFrance. The Chevalier, desirous in the present posture of his affairs\r\nof paying his court to his Catholic majesty, had been, for some\r\ntime, applying for permission to send his youngest son to Spain. He\r\nannounced his intention to Charles, and stated that he considered it\r\nwould be for his interest, that while one of his sons was in France,\r\nthe other should be in Spain.[1316]\r\n\r\nWhen James felt so uneasy in reference to Charles’s deportment\r\ntowards the French ministry, as to write him repeated remonstrances\r\non the subject, it may be supposed that he would have been gratified\r\nat his resolution to retire to Avignon, more particularly as the\r\nChevalier’s agents at Paris, who had been discarded by Charles,\r\nwould have probably regained the little influence they had with the\r\nFrench court; but James was equally disappointed with the prince’s\r\nfriends at Paris at Charles’s determination. In a letter which he\r\nwrote to the prince in answer to one from the latter, dated the\r\n21st of January, stating his intention to retire to Avignon, James\r\nstated the great concern which he felt, at a step of which he could\r\nnot comprehend the meaning, and that nothing, in his opinion, could\r\njustify it but a resolution on the part of the king of France not to\r\nallow him to remain in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nCharles left Paris for Avignon about the end of January, 1747. During\r\nhis stay at Paris, he had evinced a laudable anxiety to mitigate the\r\nsufferings of his companions in misfortune by acts of kindness; but\r\nthere was one among them who met with neither sympathy nor gratitude\r\nat his hands. This was Lord George Murray, who had sacrificed more\r\nfor him than any other individual then living. Aware of this feeling\r\nof Charles towards him, Lord George did not visit Paris on his\r\narrival in Holland in December; but, after some stay, proceeded to\r\nRome to pay his respects to the Chevalier de St. George. Charles,\r\nhowever, appears to have expected him at Paris; and in the event of\r\nhis arrival there during his absence, he left written instructions\r\nwith his brother Henry, to do every thing in his power to get him\r\narrested and committed to prison.[1317]\r\n\r\nShortly after Charles’s departure his brother, Henry, received a\r\nnotification from his father, of his intention to send him to Spain.\r\nHe immediately sent a copy of the Chevalier’s letter to Charles,\r\nand stated his regret at the prospect of being removed to such a\r\ndistance from his brother; but instead of thanking him for this kind\r\nexpression of his feelings, Charles returned him a very petulant\r\nanswer. He informed him that, while in Scotland, he had formed a\r\ndesign of going to the court of Spain himself, and that he had\r\nleft Paris with that intention,--that having resolved to make the\r\njourney, he had not asked leave from his father for fear of being\r\nrefused,--and that he intended to go and return with all imaginable\r\nprivacy. He entreated Henry, by all the ties of brotherly affection,\r\nand by the regard which he had for his success of the cause, not to\r\nstart from Paris though he should get leave, until the result of\r\nCharles’s journey was known. He requested him to confide the secret\r\nof his journey to the king of France upon receipt of his next letter,\r\nand to represent to Louis that he had suddenly taken the resolution\r\nof making a journey to Spain after his arrival at Avignon. Henry,\r\nwhose character was extremely mild and conciliating, stated, in\r\nreply, that he had communicated “the king’s letter” to him as soon as\r\nhe had received it, and that his province in that, as in every thing\r\nelse, was blind obedience; but he observed, that his father could\r\nnot foresee Charles’s resolution, and that if his going to Spain\r\nwould change the system Charles seemed to have proposed to himself,\r\nhe would not make use of any leave he might obtain without receiving\r\nfarther orders, which, he was convinced, would be to remain at Paris,\r\nwhenever his father knew of Charles’s determination to proceed to\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Kelly, Dr. Cameron, and two or three domestics,\r\nCharles left Avignon early in 1747, and repaired to Madrid; but his\r\nreception appears to have been cold and formal, and he did not even\r\nsee the queen-dowager, whom he was particularly anxious to meet.\r\nAlluding to this visit, the Chevalier observes to Charles, “I am\r\nmuch more concerned than surprised you had not a better reception\r\nin Spain; but I am in hopes your going thither will be of no ill\r\nconsequence, provided you manage your matters in a proper manner on\r\nyour return to Paris.”[1318]\r\n\r\nIn a memoir which Charles presented to Caravajal on the 6th of March,\r\nto sound the intentions of the Spanish court, he requested to be\r\ninformed, in the event of the king of France agreeing to fit out\r\nan expedition in his favour, what aid his Catholic majesty would\r\ncontribute in its support. He required that 30,000 fusils and 10,000\r\nsabres should be set apart for his use in a convenient place, in\r\norder that when occasion required he might obtain them at once in a\r\nquiet manner. That two or three small ships should be got ready as\r\nsoon as possible, and loaded with grain, to be sent to Scotland under\r\nthe charge of a gentleman he would send along with them. That the\r\nking of Spain should give him commissions for three Scotch regiments,\r\nwhich, when completed, should be formed into a brigade.[1319] In\r\nanswer to these demands, Caravajal stated, that his master could\r\nspare no ships of war to assist in the expedition, as he had only\r\nseventeen in Europe, that some of these were disabled, and that the\r\nrest were employed in the Italian war; that as to arms, orders would\r\nbe given to manufacture the required number; and that arrangements\r\nwould be made for carrying his demand for a supply of grain into\r\neffect. Finally, that as to the proposal about the regiments, he\r\nbelieved his majesty would give his consent to it.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining four or five days at Madrid, Charles retired to\r\nGuadalaxara till he should obtain a definitive answer on the subject\r\nof raising the regiments. His Catholic majesty at last consented,\r\nbut stipulated that none but Scotchmen should be admitted into these\r\nregiments, a condition which, under existing circumstances, rendered\r\ntheir formation impracticable.[1320] Finding his journey thus in a\r\nmanner unavailing, Charles returned to Paris, where he arrived on the\r\n24th of March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry, Cardinal Duke of York.\r\n\r\n(From Original Painting in possession of James Drummond, Esq.,\r\nR.S.A.)]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Charles’s return to Paris was hastened by a\r\nremonstrance sent to him by Lochiel on the subject of his retirement\r\nto Avignon. This zealous chief represented to the prince that peace\r\nwas the topic of general conversation, and as there existed a\r\nuniversal desire for it in France, there was reason to believe that\r\nGeorge II. and his allies would obtain any terms they might ask in\r\nrelation to Charles. He proposed,[1321] that if Charles could not\r\nobtain from France such an embarkation of troops as would enable him\r\nto land in England and overturn the government at one blow, he should\r\nendeavour to get an embarkation for Scotland, where the disposition\r\nof the people was still so favourable, that if he could return to the\r\nHighlands with artillery, arms, and ammunition, and only four or\r\nfive battalions of foot, he believed he would not only relieve his\r\ndistressed friends, and save the remainder of the country from ruin,\r\nbut deliver all Scotland from the slavery to which he supposed it\r\nwould soon be reduced.\r\n\r\nCharles accordingly renewed his application to Louis and his\r\nministers, but did not succeed in bringing “these people to reason,”\r\nas he himself expresses it, or in other words, prevailing on them\r\nto accede to his demand. Baffled again in his attempt to induce\r\nthe French government to engage actively in his cause, Charles\r\ncontemplated a matrimonial alliance with the czarina, with the\r\nview of engaging her in his interest; but his father, to whom he\r\ncommunicated his design, considered it impracticable, and Charles\r\nappears to have immediately dropt it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the untoward appearance of his affairs, Charles\r\nwas by no means discouraged; but the promotion of his brother to\r\nthe cardinalate, which took place about three months after his\r\nreturn from Spain, damped his spirits. Henry had every reason to be\r\ndissatisfied with Charles’s conduct towards himself personally; but\r\nhe made no complaints, and it was only owing to the peevish way in\r\nwhich Charles alluded to him in his letters to his father that James\r\nbecame apprised of his dislike to his brother.[1322] Being of a pious\r\ndisposition, Henry became desirous of embracing the ecclesiastical\r\nstate, and resolved to repair to Italy to consult his father upon the\r\nsubject. As he knew that Charles would object to his departure from\r\nParis, and might possibly take measures to prevent it, he went off\r\nwithout informing him. Charles complained to his father of Henry’s\r\nleaving Paris without acquainting him; but whilst James admitted that\r\nit was certainly not according to rule that Henry should have gone\r\naway without taking leave of Charles in person, he said he could not\r\nblame him for it under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe first notice which Charles received of the intended promotion of\r\nhis brother was by a letter from his father, dated from Albano on the\r\n13th of June, 1747.[1323] Charles was both grieved and enraged when\r\nhe received this intelligence, and shut himself up for several hours\r\nto give vent to his sorrow or vexation. Hitherto Charles had drunk\r\nthe health of his father and brother every day at dinner, but he now\r\ndiscontinued that of Henry, and forbade every person about him ever\r\nto mention his name in his presence.[1324] The friends of the family\r\nregretted exceedingly this step on the part of Henry, which they\r\nconsidered a very imprudent one, so far as the expected restoration\r\nof the Stuarts was concerned, as it narrowed their prospects of\r\nsuccess; but neither Henry nor James had any ambition for a crown,\r\nand the latter intended, if the succession opened, never to assume\r\nthe diadem.[1325] Both the pope and James notified to the king of\r\nFrance the design of presenting Henry with a cardinal’s hat, and\r\nLouis in return signified his approbation of the step.\r\n\r\nAmong other subjects of uneasiness which pressed heavily upon Charles\r\nat this time, was the state of his pecuniary concerns. He still\r\nresolutely refused to receive any pension from the French court, and\r\nit was perhaps owing to this refusal that the French ministry showed\r\nno disposition to pay the allowances which had been granted to his\r\nadherents. To relieve the prince’s immediate necessities, his father\r\nhad sent him an order on Waters, his banker at Paris, for fifteen\r\nthousand livres, significantly observing, however, that as Charles\r\nhad refused the pension which Louis had offered, the Chevalier\r\npresumed that he had some other resource to supply his wants. James,\r\nhowever, had taken care that the obstinacy of his son should not\r\nstand in the way of Louis’s bounty, and he accordingly directed\r\nO’Brien his agent to draw the pension which Charles had refused, to\r\napply the third part thereof for the use of his son, Henry, whilst in\r\nFrance, and to lay out the other two-thirds in the way he should be\r\nafterwards directed.[1326] Mr. John Grahame,[1327] in a letter to the\r\nChevalier de St. George, represents the prince as having no visible\r\nmeans of subsistence, and that he could compare his “situation to\r\nnothing better than an immense labyrinth, out of which he had not\r\na bit of thread to conduct him.” Charles was too proud to ask his\r\nfather for aid; but the latter, on hearing of his difficulties,\r\nordered O’Brien to pay forty thousand livres into O’Sullivan’s hands\r\non his account, out of the sum he had drawn on account of Charles’s\r\npension. The prince, however, consistently declined the money,\r\nknowing the source whence it came.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances in which he was thus placed by his own\r\nobstinacy, Charles, who never displayed much generosity towards\r\nthose who had offended him, was not in the best possible mood to\r\nexercise the virtue of forgiveness. His father had repeatedly written\r\nhim in relation to his threatened seizure of Lord George Murray,\r\nand had strongly inculcated the propriety of forgiving a man who\r\nhad suffered so much in his cause; but Charles disregarded these\r\npaternal admonitions. Lord George was very desirous to effect a\r\nreconciliation, by making every reasonable submission that could be\r\nrequired of him, and for this purpose left Rome for Paris, where he\r\narrived on the 10th of July. Charles was then living at St. Ouen, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Paris, and Lord George having, the day after his\r\narrival, ascertained the place of his residence, intended to proceed\r\nthither early on the 12th, to pay his respects to the prince. His\r\nlordship was, however, prevented from carrying his intention into\r\neffect, by a message from Charles, who, hearing of his arrival in\r\nParis, sent Mr. Stafford, one of his household, to Lord George, to\r\ninform him that it was the prince’s wish that he should not appear\r\nat St. Ouen, but that he would do well to leave Paris as soon as he\r\ncould. Lord George requested Stafford to acquaint the prince that he\r\nhad come to France with no other design but to pay his respects to\r\nhim, and that he would punctually obey his orders by leaving France.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding frequent disputes with the French ministers, Charles\r\nalways endeavoured to keep on good terms with their master; and\r\nwhen he defeated the confederates at Laffeldt, he wrote a letter\r\nexpressive of the great joy he felt on the occasion. As every victory\r\ngained over the allies appeared favourable to his cause, he cannot\r\nbe well blamed for entertaining such a feeling; but the existence of\r\nthis document subverts the idea generally entertained, that Charles\r\nnever expressed any satisfaction at the conquests of the French\r\nin Flanders. He was no doubt solicitous that Great Britain should\r\nmaintain her honour in the field and on the ocean; but his patriotism\r\nwas not so disinterested as to make him prefer that honour to the\r\ncrown for which he was contending. It was not until he saw that he\r\ncould no longer depend upon France for aid that his patriotism was\r\nroused.\r\n\r\nMuch as Charles trusted to his personal powers for negotiation, he\r\nsoon found that it was no easy matter to bring the ministers of Louis\r\n“to reason;” and that, to be successful, it was necessary to obtain\r\nthe aid of some experienced politician. He accordingly looked about\r\nhim for one in whom he could repose his confidence, and fixed upon\r\nLord Marischal as the person most likely to answer his wishes. To\r\nthis nobleman, who was then living at Treviso, Charles despatched a\r\nletter in the month of August, in which he stated that his father had\r\nleft him entire master, to employ such persons as were most agreeable\r\nto him, and that he might easily believe his first choice would light\r\nupon him. He informed him that his desire was that his lordship\r\nshould join him with all convenient speed, and that he had too good\r\nan opinion of his loyalty and regard for his bleeding country to make\r\nhim have the least doubt of his compliance, especially since all the\r\ncauses of discontent which his lordship might heretofore have had,\r\nwere now quite removed. Highly complimentary as this letter was, Lord\r\nMarischal declined the honour intended him. He stated that he had not\r\nretired from public life till he saw how useless his services were,\r\nand must have been had they been continued; and that the broken state\r\nof his health required that he should pass the rest of his days in\r\nquiet.[1328]\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his advances to Lord Marischal, Charles gave himself\r\nup entirely to the direction of George Kelly, his secretary, who,\r\nit is alleged, was personally obnoxious to the French court. To\r\ncounteract the rising power of this new favourite, the pernicious\r\ninfluence of whose counsels some of the adherents of the exiled\r\nfamily were already beginning to feel, Sempil, one of the Chevalier’s\r\nagents at Paris, by desire of Lochiel and Drummond of Bochaldy, drew\r\nup and forwarded a representation to James in the month of June\r\n1747. The Chevalier, who was not a bad judge of mankind, foreseeing\r\nthe bad consequences that would follow if Kelly was allowed to\r\nguide the councils of the prince, had cautioned Charles against his\r\ninterference shortly after his return from Scotland; but the prince\r\nattributed his father’s dislike to Kelly to the misrepresentations\r\nof his enemies. In a letter, alluding to some complaints made by\r\nCharles against his brother, James observes, “What you now write to\r\nme is manifestly the product of Kelly’s malice ... as long as you are\r\ndirected or influenced by him, depend upon it nothing will go well\r\nwith you, and you will never have a moment’s quiet yourself.”[1329]\r\n\r\nThese admonitions, which were repeated after Drummond’s\r\ncommunication, were, however, thrown away upon Charles, who clung to\r\nhis secretary with as great pertinacity as ever. This predilection\r\nfor Kelly, if the statement of Sempil is to be credited, ruined\r\nthe prince’s negotiations with the French ministry, who, according\r\nto him, would have entertained a proposal made by the Marquis de\r\nPuyzieux, of embarking a force for Scotland on the dissolution\r\nof the British parliament; but the design was given up, because\r\nthe persons in whom Charles seemed to repose his confidence were\r\nobnoxious to the French court, and were considered unworthy of\r\ntrust.[1330]\r\n\r\nWhilst the French government evaded Charles’s demand for a supply\r\nof troops, it acceded in other respects to his wishes. A regiment\r\nwas given to Lochiel,[1331] the arrears of the gratuities granted to\r\nthe Scotch exiles were paid up, and a fixed allowance of thirty-six\r\nthousand livres per annum was granted to them, the appropriation of\r\nwhich was left entirely to the prince. Having thus provided for his\r\nfriends, the French ministry thought that Charles’s repugnance to\r\na pension might be overcome; and accordingly M. de Lally, who was\r\ndirected to communicate to him the largess granted to his adherents,\r\nwas also appointed to sound him on the subject of an allowance to\r\nhimself. Charles, writing to M. de Puyzieux, observed, that he\r\nwould accept with pleasure even the smallest favour his majesty was\r\ndisposed to grant; but he begged that nothing should be given him in\r\nname of a pension, and that he should be permitted to deny to his\r\nEnglish friends, even face to face, that he was in the receipt of\r\nit.[1332] It thus appears that Charles’s objection to a pension did\r\nnot proceed from any disinclination to receive the money, but from\r\nan apprehension that the circumstance of his becoming a pensioner of\r\nFrance would injure him with his English friends. It is not known\r\nwhether the French government acted upon Charles’s suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the French court, whilst the war lasted, to keep\r\nup appearances with the exiled family, so as to encourage the belief\r\nthat it really intended to aid in its restoration. This notion was\r\nstrengthened by the appointment of Lord Ogilvy and Lochiel to the\r\ncommand of regiments; and the fears of an invasion after Charles’s\r\nreturn to France are said to have delayed for a time the embarkation\r\nof the British troops for Flanders. This system of intimidation\r\nwould in all probability have been persevered in had not France\r\nbecome tired of a war which had exhausted her treasury, destroyed\r\nher commerce, and almost annihilated her navy. The confederates were\r\nequally weary of a war in which they had reaped neither honour nor\r\nadvantage, and they therefore gladly availed themselves of an offer\r\nof pacification made by France. The belligerent powers accordingly\r\nagreed to hold a congress, which was opened at Aix-la-Chapelle in\r\nMarch 1748.\r\n\r\nCharles now saw that all hope of an immediate restoration was at an\r\nend, and must have perceived, from the strong desire which existed in\r\nFrance for peace, and the low state to which that kingdom was reduced\r\nby the war, that his interests would form no bar in the way of a\r\ngeneral pacification.\r\n\r\nThe first public step which Charles took to mark his displeasure with\r\nthe conduct of the French government, in suing for a peace, was of\r\na very decided character. When the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle was\r\nabout to assemble, he gave instructions to the Sieur Roettier to\r\nstrike a medal with his head, and the inscription, “Carolus Walliæ\r\nPrinceps” (Charles Prince of Wales); and on the reverse the figure\r\nBritannia and a fleet of war-vessels, with the significant motto,\r\n“Amor et Spes Britanniæ” (The Love and Hope of Britain).\r\n\r\nWhen the medal appeared it created a great sensation in France, and\r\nmany of the French nobility were deeply offended at the device and\r\nmotto, which they regarded as an insult offered to the nation. The\r\nprince of Conti, in particular, who was accounted one of the proudest\r\nmen in all France, showed his chagrin on the occasion. Meeting\r\nCharles one day in the Luxembourg Gardens, Conti observed to Charles,\r\nwith an air of pleasantry, under which a sneer was observed to lurk,\r\nthat the device of his medal was not just so applicable as some\r\npersons might at first suppose, as the British navy had not shown\r\nany particular friendship for him. Charles, who at once perceived\r\nthe censure, immediately replied, “That is true, Prince! but I am,\r\nnevertheless, the friend of the navy against all its enemies; as I\r\nshall always look upon the glory of England as my own, and her glory\r\nis in her navy.” About the time the medal was struck Charles sat for\r\nhis portrait to Tocqué, the eminent painter, which was immediately\r\nengraved by Wille, the celebrated engraver, with the title “Carolus\r\nWalliæ Princeps.”\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, the preliminaries of a general peace were\r\nsigned by the ministers of Great Britain, France, and the United\r\nProvinces, the basis of which was a general restitution of the\r\nconquests which had been made during the war. A suspension of arms\r\nalmost immediately followed the signing of the preliminaries.\r\nCharles was not aware that the preliminaries had been signed till\r\nsome time after the suspension of arms, and he consoled himself with\r\nthe vain hope that peace was not so near at hand as was generally\r\nsupposed.[1333]\r\n\r\nDuring the negotiations Charles still went to court, though not so\r\nfrequently as before, and always endeavoured to avoid any personal\r\ninterviews with the king; but when informed of the signing of the\r\npreliminaries, he gave up his visits entirely. His father, and the\r\nadherents of his family, expected that he would no longer remain in a\r\nkingdom which was now again to sacrifice the interests of his house;\r\nbut instead of evincing any disposition to depart, he gave a decided\r\nindication of fixing himself in Paris, by hiring a splendid hotel\r\nupon the _Quai de Theatin_ for himself and his principal friends, in\r\norder, as he said, to be near the opera, play-house, and the other\r\nplaces of public diversion in Paris. To show how little he regarded\r\nthe proceedings at Aix-la-Chapelle, he appeared much gayer than\r\nusual, and when any person alluded, in his presence, to the congress,\r\nhe seemed not to regard the matter, and waived the subject by singing\r\nor introducing some different topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nTo show, however, that he was not indifferent to his rights, Charles\r\ndrew up a protest against any stipulation which might be entered\r\ninto by the contracting parties, contrary to these rights, of which\r\nhe sent a copy to the king of France, enclosed in a letter from\r\nhimself. The Chevalier de St George, in ignorance of Charles’s\r\nprotest, also published one in his own name, agreeably to a practice\r\nwhich he and his father, king James II., had followed, whenever any\r\ntreaty with Great Britain was entered into.\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminaries were signed, Louis took an early opportunity\r\nof intimating to Charles that he had renewed the engagements which\r\nhe and his grandfather had formerly come under to the British\r\ngovernment, in relation to the House of Stuart; but Charles, in\r\nhis protest, entirely overlooked the stipulation which regarded\r\nhis intended expulsion from the French territories. Louis probably\r\nexpected that this hint would have been sufficient to induce Charles\r\nto quit France, but, as he indicated no intention to remove, the\r\nMarquis de Puyzieux, by desire of the king, sent a requisition in\r\nwriting, to which he demanded an answer. Charles returned an evasive\r\nanswer to M. de Puyzieux’s note the same day.\r\n\r\nAfter this answer, matters appear to have remained _in statu quo_\r\ntill October, on the 7th of which month the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nwas finally concluded and signed. By this treaty the contracting\r\nparties agreed, without any limitation, to a literal insertion of the\r\nfifth article of the quadruple alliance, by which it was stipulated\r\nthat neither the “Pretender,” nor any of his descendants, should be\r\nallowed to reside within the territories belonging to any of the\r\nparties to the treaty. Meanwhile Louis was looking out for a suitable\r\nasylum for Charles Edward. Knowing that the prince had declared that\r\nhe would never return to Italy, he directed M. de Courteille, his\r\nenvoy to the Cantons of Switzerland, to ask a residence for Charles\r\nin the city of Fribourg. The regency complied with the request, but\r\nMr. Barnaby, the British minister to the Helvetic body, violently\r\nopposed the plan, and presented a remonstrance to the magistracy of\r\nFribourg, couched in such terms as to draw upon him the censure of\r\nthe regency.\r\n\r\nThe next person selected by Louis to act as negotiator with Charles\r\nwas the Cardinal de Tencin, who was supposed to have some influence\r\nwith him. The cardinal delivered the message with which he had been\r\nintrusted in the most delicate manner, and endeavoured to convince\r\nCharles, by a variety of arguments, of the regret the king felt at\r\nhaving been obliged to accede to the objectionable articles of the\r\ntreaty. To reconcile Charles to the measure, the cardinal, it is\r\nsaid, hinted that the treaty might possibly be of short endurance,\r\nand that the prince might afterwards return to France with brighter\r\nprospects, but the cardinal left Charles without obtaining any\r\nsatisfaction. Desirous of avoiding extremities, the king waited\r\nabout two weeks in expectation that Charles would depart; but being\r\ninformed that he made no preparations for his departure, he sent\r\nthe Duke de Gesvres, the governor of Paris, with a message similar\r\nto that delivered by the cardinal. The duke, however, got as little\r\nsatisfaction as the cardinal, and on a second interview, the prince\r\nabsolutely refused to quit the country, and told the duke that there\r\nwas a treaty prior to that of Aix-la-Chapelle between him and the\r\nking, from which he could not depart with honour.\r\n\r\nThe British ministry had for some time been urging the French court\r\nto fulfil that part of the treaty which related to the expulsion\r\nof the prince from the French territories; and the hostages[1334]\r\ncomplained that his being permitted to appear at all public places of\r\namusement was as an insult to their sovereign, and an infringement of\r\nthe treaty. Louis, therefore, sent the Duke de Gesvres a third time\r\nto expostulate with Charles on the 6th of November; but Charles again\r\nevaded a direct answer to the duke’s demand to quit France. Charles\r\nafterwards sent him an explicit answer in writing, in which he stated\r\nthat it was with much regret he found himself compelled in defence\r\nof his own interests to oppose the intentions of the king on this\r\noccasion, and that he had already apprised his majesty of his design\r\nby a letter which he had written to M. de Puyzieux as far back as\r\nthe 20th of August. He requested the duke to assure his majesty in\r\nthe strongest terms that he would retain towards him during his life\r\nall the sentiments of respect and attachment which he had formerly\r\nexpressed.[1335]\r\n\r\nLouis was much annoyed at Charles’s obstinacy, as he felt great\r\nrepugnance to push matters to extremities with a prince who could\r\nplead in his own justification a violation of a solemn contract which\r\nthe king of France had entered into with him three years before. As\r\nhe had, however, contracted with Charles merely in his character of\r\nprince regent, it appears to have occurred to Louis that he would\r\nsave his honour if he obtained an order from the Chevalier de St\r\nGeorge, requiring Charles to leave his dominions before having\r\nrecourse to physical force. He therefore despatched a courier to Rome\r\nwith a letter to the Chevalier, giving an account of the prince’s\r\nconduct, and requesting James to interpose his parental authority\r\nto induce Charles to leave his dominions. That James might be fully\r\nassured of the prince’s determination to remain in France contrary\r\nto his wishes, Louis also sent him Charles’s letter to the Duke de\r\nGesvres.\r\n\r\nThe messenger returned to Paris early in December with a letter from\r\nJames to the king of France, inclosing another to Charles, which,\r\nafter perusing, he was requested to despatch to the prince. After\r\ncomplaining of Charles’s conduct towards himself, James told him\r\nthat he saw him on the brink of a precipice, and that he would act\r\nthe part of an unnatural parent if he did not do everything that\r\ndepended upon him to save him from falling, and that he therefore\r\nfound himself obliged to order him as his father and king to conform\r\nhimself without delay to the wishes of the French king, by leaving\r\nhis dominions with a good grace.\r\n\r\nThis letter Louis sent by the Duke de Gesvres to Charles, the duke\r\nat the same time carrying a letter from Louis, which is said to have\r\ncontained a blank order to be filled up by the prince himself for a\r\nyearly allowance. Charles told the duke that he wanted no pecuniary\r\nfavours from his majesty, and that it was not consistent with honour\r\nto comply with his demand to leave the French territories. The\r\nduke urging Charles to reconsider his resolution, the latter grew\r\nimpatient, and told him that he would in future decline receiving\r\nany communications from any person but the king himself. The duke\r\ntold him the thing was impossible, unless indeed he expected, what he\r\ncould scarcely suppose he did, that his majesty was to come to the\r\n_Quai de Theatin_ in person. “In short, then, sir,” said Charles, “I\r\nhave nothing farther to say than what I have said already,--pardon\r\nme, I have some business.” With these words Charles left the room,\r\nleaving the duke in amazement.\r\n\r\nLong before the French public were aware of the intentions of their\r\ngovernment in relation to the prince, the fame of his exploits, in\r\nconnection with the fact of his being a descendant of _Henri Quatre_,\r\nhad endeared him to the French nation; but when they found that he\r\nwas to be sacrificed by their sovereign to state necessity, their\r\nadmiration for his person was heightened into enthusiasm, and they\r\nlooked upon the approaching struggle between Louis and his kinsman\r\nwith feelings of the deepest interest. Every person was desirous to\r\nsee a prince who had the courage to brave the grand monarch in his\r\nown capital, and whenever Charles appeared upon the public walks,\r\nhe was followed by the assembled multitudes. When he entered the\r\ntheatre, all eyes were directed towards him, and the performance was\r\nallowed to pass off unheeded by the audience. Charles alone seemed to\r\nmake light of his misfortunes, and evinced the gaiety of his spirits\r\nby talking in an easy, cheerful, and affable manner to the young\r\nnoblemen, by whom, on these occasions, he was always surrounded.[1336]\r\n\r\nAfter trying every possible means to induce Charles to quit the\r\nFrench territory without effect, the ministry pressed the king to\r\narrest him, and send him by force out of the kingdom. Louis was\r\nnaturally averse to such a strong proceeding; but as he saw he could\r\nnot fulfil the stipulation of the treaty regarding the exiled family\r\nin any other way, he reluctantly signed an order for his arrest.\r\nWhen putting his name to the warrant, he felt the extreme delicacy\r\nof the act, and pathetically exclaimed, “Poor prince! how difficult\r\nit is for a king to be a true friend!” This order, which was signed\r\nat three o’clock in the afternoon, was blazed all over Paris before\r\nevening. One of the prince’s retinue, who heard the intelligence,\r\nbrought it to him; but Charles would not believe it. “Pish! pish!”\r\nhe exclaimed, “an idle romance; they know I will obey my father.”\r\nThough no official notice was sent to Charles of the order, yet it\r\nis understood that means were taken to apprise him of his situation;\r\nand on the morning of the 10th of December, while walking in the\r\nTuilleries, he was informed by a person of distinction that he would\r\ncertainly be seized that very day if he did not prevent it by an\r\nimmediate departure; but, instead of taking the hint thus kindly\r\ngiven him, he seemed to treat the intelligence as chimerical, and\r\nturning to one of his followers, gave directions that a box should be\r\nhired for him that night at the opera-house.\r\n\r\nTo carry the warrant into effect, no less than 1200 of the guards\r\nwere in the course of the day drawn out, and posted in the court of\r\nthe Palais Royal; a great number of sergeants and grenadiers, in\r\ncuirasses and helmets, filled the passages of the opera-house; and\r\nthe police were placed in all the streets leading to it, to stop\r\nany carriages that might attempt to pass. Six intrepid sergeants of\r\nthe grenadiers were ordered to seize the prince. Two companies of\r\ngrenadiers took post in the court-yard of the kitchens, where the\r\nDuc de Biron, colonel of the French guards, disguised, waited in a\r\ncoach to see the issue of the enterprise. The Mousquetaires, a body\r\nof French horse-guards, had orders to be ready to mount on horseback;\r\ntroops were posted upon the road from the Palais Royal to Vincennes;\r\nhatchets and scaling ladders were prepared, and locksmiths directed\r\nto attend, in order to take the prince by escalade, in case he\r\nshould throw himself into some house, and there attempt to stand out\r\na siege. A physician named Vernage, and three surgeons, were also\r\nordered to be in readiness to dress such of the troops as might be\r\nwounded. These extensive preparations can only be accounted for on\r\nthe supposition that the government was apprehensive that an attempt\r\nwould be made by the Parisians to rescue the prince.\r\n\r\nCharles received several notes during the day, giving him notice of\r\nthe measures taken for securing him; but he resolved to brave the\r\ndanger. He accordingly left his hotel in his carriage, accompanied by\r\nthree gentlemen of his household, at a quarter after five o’clock,\r\nfor the opera-house, and, in passing through the street St Honoré,\r\nwas warned by a friendly voice not to proceed, as the opera-house\r\nwas beset. He proceeded onwards, however, and on entering the\r\n_cul-de-sac_, leading to the opera-house, the barriers were drawn,\r\nand the doors of the opera-house shut. On alighting from his coach,\r\nhe was instantly surrounded by the six sergeants, disguised as\r\ntradesmen, who seized his person, and, lifting him off the ground,\r\ncarried him through the _porte cochère_, at the end of the passage\r\nwhich led into the court-yard of the Palais Royal. M. de Vaudreuil,\r\nmajor of the blue guards, who, with some officers, had remained\r\nbehind the gate, then approached his Royal Highness, and said,\r\n“Monseigneur, I arrest you in the name of the king, my master.”\r\nCharles, without betraying any emotion, answered that the manner was\r\na little too violent. The sergeants, thereupon, carried him into a\r\nroom on the ground floor of the palace, possessed by a surgeon of the\r\nDuke of Orlean’s household. The major demanding his arms, Charles\r\npresented his sword, but suspecting that he had other weapons about\r\nhim, the sergeants, by De Vaudreuil’s order, searched his person, and\r\nfound a pair of pocket pistols and a penknife, of which they took\r\npossession. Charles remarked that he had carried a pair of pistols\r\nabout with him ever since he returned from Scotland. The major had\r\nprovided himself with thirty-six ells of black silk ribbon[1337] with\r\nwhich to tie the prince, and on hearing him give directions to that\r\neffect, Charles offered his parole that he would hurt neither himself\r\nnor any other person, and added that he thought so many persons\r\nwere quite sufficient to guard one unarmed man without resorting\r\nto such a step. The major consulted the Duke de Biron, who ordered\r\nthat the prince should be bound. Charles was accordingly tied in\r\nfive different places. In this situation he was put into a hired\r\ncoach, attended by the major and two captains of the blue guards, and\r\nwas driven, under a strong guard, to the castle of Vincennes, into\r\nwhich he was received by his friend M. de Chatelet, the governor,\r\nwho placed him in a small upper apartment in the Tower, and treated\r\nhim as well as his duty permitted him. The only person who remained\r\nwith him in his confinement was Neil Mac Eachan, who had attended\r\nhim in his perilous journey from Uist to Skye. Charles had borne the\r\nindignity offered him with great composure, the disgrace attending\r\nwhich, he told M. de Vaudreuil, could only affect his master;\r\nbut after he found himself shut up in the castle, his feelings\r\nwere overcome, and he is said to have clasped his hands together\r\nand to have burst into tears. “Ah! my faithful mountaineers,” he\r\npathetically exclaimed, “from _you_ I never would have received such\r\ntreatment. Would to God I were still among you!” Meanwhile the three\r\ngentlemen who had attended Charles to the opera were also seized, and\r\nfive others, who were by chance at his house, and all his servants\r\nwere sent to the Bastile; his hotel was taken possession of by the\r\nlieutenant of police.[1338] Next day all the prince’s French servants\r\nwere released.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of the prince created an extraordinary sensation in Paris;\r\nand next morning all the public places of the city were covered with\r\npasquinades, which had been put up during the night, reflecting, in\r\nvery severe terms, upon the conduct of the king and his ministers\r\nfor their treatment of the prince. One of these was in the form of\r\nan order from King George, directed to Louis of Bourbon, as his\r\nviceroy, commanding and requiring him to seize, and, if necessary, to\r\ntie the person of Charles Edward Stuart, and to conduct him out of\r\nthe kingdom of France; and that, if Louis should continue to please\r\nhis master as he had hitherto done, he should be continued, by the\r\nking of England, in the viceroyalty of his kingdom of France. These\r\nplacards were exceedingly annoying to the French court, and were torn\r\ndown by the police with as great expedition as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze Medal, Prince Charles; _reverse_, Louisa, his\r\nWife.\r\n\r\n(From Original in Antiquarian Museum, Edinburgh.)]\r\n\r\nCharles was kept in confinement till the 14th December, on which day,\r\nin consequence of a correspondence which had passed between him and\r\nthe king on that and the previous day, he was allowed to walk a few\r\nhours in the gardens. Having tendered his parole to leave the French\r\nterritories without guards, Charles was released at seven o’clock,\r\nin the morning of Sunday the 15th, and departed for Fontainebleau,\r\nin a coach, under the charge of a commandant of musketeers. Messrs.\r\nStafford and Sheridan, two gentlemen of his household, who had been\r\nset at liberty, followed him in two post-chaises. The remainder of\r\nCharles’s domestics were released a few days afterwards. On reaching\r\nFontainebleau, Charles despatched a facetious note to a M. de Boile\r\nat Paris, requesting him to inform his friends that he carried\r\nhimself well, that his head had never been off his shoulders, and\r\nthat it was still upon them. From Fontainebleau Charles proceeded,\r\nby easy stages, to Avignon, where he arrived on the morning of the\r\n27th of December, disguised in the uniform of a French officer of\r\nmusketeers. He had received a letter from his father on the road, and\r\nfour days after his arrival he despatched an answer acquainting him\r\nthat he was “in perfect good health, notwithstanding the unheard-of\r\nbarbarous and inhuman treatment” he had met with.[1339]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1303] It is to be attended to, that in alluding to Charles’s\r\nproceedings on the continent the New Style is followed.\r\n\r\n[1304] Letter among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1305] Letter from O’Bryen to the Chevalier, 17th October, 1746, in\r\nthe _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1306] Letter from the Chevalier to Charles, 6th January,\r\n1747.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[1307] _Authentic Account._ The writer of this account, who states\r\nthat he obtained his information from an eye-witness, says that when\r\nCharles arrived at Paris he could not be prevailed upon to take any\r\nrefreshment, but instantly proceeded to Versailles, to see the king,\r\nand that though Louis was at that time engaged in council on some\r\naffairs of importance, he immediately quitted it to receive him. He\r\nthen relates the interview as above stated, and says that Charles was\r\nafterwards publicly received at Fontainebleau in the character of\r\nthe Prince Regent of England, Scotland, and Ireland. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the first time that Charles met Louis after his return\r\nto France was at Fontainebleau, and it is equally certain that he was\r\nnever recognised at court as a British prince.\r\n\r\n[1308] Both these letters will be found among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1309] Letter from O’Brien to the Chevalier de St. George, 31st\r\nOctober, 1746, among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1310] Of the unlimited confidence which these two favourites enjoyed\r\nwith Charles the _Stuart Papers_ afford abundant proofs. Sheridan\r\nin fact directed every thing when Charles was in Scotland, and it\r\nwas solely owing to his aversion to a hill campaign,--the fatigue of\r\nwhich he said he could not endure,--that Lord George Murray could not\r\nprevail upon Charles to desist from engaging the Duke of Cumberland\r\nat Culloden; yet so great was the ascendency which Sir Thomas had\r\nacquired over the mind of Charles, that the ruinous result which\r\nensued did not in the least weaken it. Edgar announced Sheridan’s\r\ndeath to Charles in a letter dated 2d December, 1746, and sent along\r\nwith it all the papers found in Sir Thomas’s repositories having\r\nrelation to the Prince or his affairs, among which was a sketch of a\r\ndying speech which Sir Thomas had prepared in case he had been taken\r\nand executed. Dr. King insinuates, from the ignorance of Charles,\r\nthat Sheridan was in the pay of the English government; but it would\r\nbe doing injustice to the memory of the favourite to believe him\r\nguilty of such baseness without direct proofs of his criminality.\r\nThe Doctor’s words are: “His (Charles’s) governor was a protestant,\r\nand I am apt to believe purposely neglected his education, of\r\nwhich, it is surmised, he made a merit to the English ministry;\r\nfor he was always supposed to be their pensioner. The Chevalier\r\nRamsay, the author of Cyrus, was Prince Charles’s preceptor for\r\nabout a year; but a court faction removed him.” The illiterateness\r\nof Charles is very perceptible in his ignorance of the orthography\r\nof French and English. Both in style and orthography they contrast\r\nmost unfavourably with those of his father, whose epistolary\r\ncorrespondence cannot fail to give the reader a favourable idea of\r\nhis literary acquirements. Though James appears to have had a good\r\nopinion of Sir Thomas, yet after his death he complained bitterly to\r\nCharles, in a long and very interesting letter, (that of 3d February,\r\n1747, in the _Stuart Papers_,) of the conduct of the favourite, and\r\nin general of the other persons who obtained the Prince’s confidence.\r\nIt was James’s deliberate conviction that their object was to corrupt\r\nCharles, by withdrawing him from his “duty to God in the first place,\r\nand to him in the second!” The sequel of Charles’s unfortunate\r\nhistory seems to confirm this opinion. A most unfavourable sketch of\r\nthe character of Kelly, the new favourite, is given by Father Myles\r\nMacdonell, his own relative, for which see the Father’s letter to the\r\nChevalier de St. George, 4th May, 1747, in the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1311] There are two copies of this memoir among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\nOne of them written in the first person, and holograph of the prince,\r\nis titled, “Memoir to ye F. K. from me of 10th Nov. 1746.” The other\r\nis titled, “Ancien Project de Memoire,” and is written in the third\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n[1312] Statements showing the division of this money, will be found\r\nin the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1313] Letter from the Chevalier to Charles, 6th January,\r\n1747.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[1314] Letter from Charles to Louis, 12th January, 1747, in the\r\n_Stuart Papers_.

The\r\noriginal letter is among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\nLord George’s arrival at Rome was announced to Charles by the\r\nChevalier, in a letter dated 21st March, 1747. The following extract\r\nplaces James’s character in a very favourable point of view: “I\r\nmust tell you that I was much surprised t’other day at the arrival\r\nof Lord George Murray in this place. After having absconded many\r\nmonths in Scotland, he found means to come to Holland, and from\r\nthence by Venice here. By what Bramston, (the corresponding name\r\nof O’Sullivan,) says, I am sorry to find that you have not been\r\npleased with him, but tho’ I questioned Bramston much about him, yet\r\nI own I don’t see any motive to suspect his fidelity and loyalty.\r\nPeople may have an odd, and even a wrong way of thinking, and may\r\neven fail in something towards ourselves, but may be men of honour\r\nand honesty with all that; so that considering his birth, and the\r\nfigure he made in your service, and that you had never writ to me\r\nabout him yourself, I thought it would be very wrong in me not to\r\nreceive him with all kindness, and even distinction. I don’t know how\r\nlong he will stay here, or how he proposes to dispose of himself,\r\nbut I understand he has a mind to bring over his lady, and to live\r\nprivately with her in some retired place. He is publicly here, for\r\nhe has no measures to keep; and I must do him the justice to say\r\nthat he never speaks of you but with great respect, and even eloge.”\r\nSee also the letters among the _Stuart Papers_ from the Chevalier to\r\nCharles of 25th April, and 2d and 9th May, 1747, copied also from the\r\noriginal copies in the same collection.

On the death of George I. the\r\nChevalier de St. George had taken up his residence in this city,\r\nthat he might the better be enabled to correspond with his friends\r\nin England; but he was soon obliged to retire across the Alps, in\r\nconsequence, it is understood, of an application from the British\r\ngovernment to the court of Rome. To expel the Stuarts from the\r\nFrench territories, whilst, by a sort of geographical subtlety, they\r\nwere allowed to reside almost in the heart of France, was certainly\r\nan absurdity; and had Charles remained for any length of time at\r\nAvignon, it is probable that, as in the case of his father, he\r\nwould soon have been forced to look out for another asylum; but, to\r\nthe astonishment of all Europe, he left Avignon incognito, after a\r\nresidence of about two months, and went whither nobody could tell.\r\n\r\nAttended only by Colonel Goring, and one or two unliveried servants,\r\nCharles left Avignon in a travelling chaise, and proceeded on the\r\nroad to Lyons. The prince and Goring passed for French officers, who,\r\non the conclusion of the peace, had obtained leave to visit their\r\nfriends--Charles taking the name of the Count D’Espoir.[1340] What\r\nhis motives were for taking this step have not been ascertained;\r\nbut it is probable that one of his objects was an interview with\r\nthe Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, with whose daughter, the Princess\r\nCharlotte Louisa, he contemplated a matrimonial alliance.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through Lyons, Charles hired another chaise, and\r\nproceeded to Strasbourg. From Strasbourg it is supposed that Charles\r\nwent to Paris, as it is quite certain that, in the month of May, he\r\nvisited that capital.\r\n\r\nOf Charles’s wanderings, during the several years that he continued\r\nto roam on the continent, no satisfactory account has yet appeared;\r\nbut recent researches have thrown some light on this obscure part\r\nof his history. It has been long known that during this period he\r\nvisited Germany, spent some time privately in Paris, but resided\r\nchiefly in the dominions of his friend the Duc de Bouillon, where,\r\nsurrounded by the wide and solitary forest of Ardennes, his\r\nactive spirit sought, in the dangerous chase of wolves and bears,\r\nsome compensation for the military enterprise from which he was\r\nexcluded.[1341] Secretary Edgar, who corresponded frequently with\r\n“the dear wild man,” as he jocularly styled Charles, considered the\r\nprince’s incognito as one of the most extraordinary circumstances\r\nthat had ever occurred, so great was the secrecy with which it was\r\nfor several years preserved.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure from Paris, the first trace that can be\r\ndiscovered of him is in September 1750, when he visited London.[1342]\r\nHis object in coming over appears to have been to establish a\r\nregular correspondence with his friends in England, to ascertain the\r\nprobability of a rising in his favour, and to fix with them upon a\r\nproper place for landing arms, &c. Before his departure he applied\r\nto his father for a renewal of his powers as regent, which James\r\nreluctantly granted.[1343] If he found matters in a favourable train,\r\nhe intended to issue a declaration in which he was to offer to refer\r\nthe funds to a free parliament; and to encourage the army to join\r\nhim, he was to show the nullity of the oaths they had taken to the\r\n“Elector.”[1344] Charles arrived in London in the month of September,\r\nand went immediately to the house of Lady Primrose. Her ladyship\r\nsent a note to Dr. King, a zealous Jacobite, desiring to see him\r\nimmediately. On the doctor’s entering the house, Lady Primrose led\r\nhim into her dressing-room, and presented him to the prince. Dr. King\r\nwas surprised at seeing him, and still more astonished when informed\r\nof the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey to England\r\nat such a juncture. According to Dr. King, whose statement is fully\r\nsupported by documents among the _Stuart Papers_, the impatience of\r\nthe prince’s friends who were in exile had formed a scheme which\r\nwas impracticable; but although it had been as feasible as they had\r\nrepresented it to him, yet no preparation had been made to carry it\r\ninto execution. Charles was soon convinced that he had been deceived,\r\nand after a stay in London of only five days, returned to the\r\ncontinent.[1345]\r\n\r\nAs Charles studiously concealed from his father all his designs and\r\nmovements, the latter was entirely ignorant of his contemplated\r\nmarriage with the daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. The\r\nChevalier had suggested, in 1747, a marriage with one of the Duke\r\nof Modena’s daughters, from which family his mother had sprung; but\r\nCharles appears not to have relished the proposed match. He now urged\r\nupon him the necessity of marrying, so as to secure the succession\r\nof the family; for he could not think the prince so selfish as to\r\nconsider himself only in all he did and suffered.\r\n\r\nThough he could not but feel disappointed at the result of his\r\njourney to England, Charles did not despond, and he now resolved to\r\nsound the dispositions of the courts of Berlin and Stockholm. As Lord\r\nMarischal had resided about three years in Berlin, and was, through\r\nthe interest of Field-marshal Keith, his brother, on the best footing\r\nwith his Prussian majesty, it occurred to Charles that, by availing\r\nhimself of the services of that nobleman, whom he looked upon as\r\n“an honest man,” Frederick might be induced to espouse his cause.\r\nAccordingly he despatched Colonel Goring to Berlin, in June 1751,\r\nwith a letter to Lord Marischal. After consulting with his lordship,\r\nGoring was directed to proceed to Sweden.[1346] Of this mission\r\nnothing farther is known. An interview which took place between Lord\r\nMarischal and Goring, and another probably with the prince himself at\r\nParis, in September following, are involved in the same obscurity.\r\nAbout this time Charles received notice that one Grosert, collector\r\nof the customs at Alloa, had left Scotland with an intention to\r\nassassinate him. This information was brought to France by Robertson\r\nof Blairfetty, who had been in Scotland. Grosert is said to have been\r\nmarried to a German woman, the daughter of the milliner of George\r\nI.[1347]\r\n\r\nNo trace can be discovered of Charles’s wanderings, after his\r\nreturn from London, till the 5th of April 1752, when he was seen by\r\na gentleman of the name of Mackintosh at Campvere, in the island\r\nof Middleburg, where he remained four days.[1348] He is said to\r\nhave revisited London in the course of the following year, and to\r\nhave formally renounced the Catholic religion in a chapel in Gray’s\r\nInn Lane under his own name of Charles Edward Stuart; but for this\r\nstatement there appears to be no sufficient authority.[1349] Dr.\r\nKing, who corresponded with Charles for several years, makes no\r\nallusion to this visit, nor is there the least trace of it to be\r\nfound among the _Stuart Papers_. The story of a third visit, on\r\noccasion of the coronation of George III., at which Charles is said\r\nto have attended, rests on the authority of a letter of David Hume,\r\nwritten in 1773. As to his reported change of religion, a rumour was\r\ngenerally prevalent in 1752--a year before the date of his alleged\r\napostacy at London--that Charles had become a Protestant; but its\r\naccuracy was doubted of by some of his friends.[1350] It is certain,\r\nhowever, that Charles was not disposed to imitate the self-denial\r\nof his father and grandfather, who preferred their faith to a\r\ncrown.[1351]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the state of comparative security which the British\r\ngovernment enjoyed after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, it became less\r\nvigilant than before in watching the motions of the exiled adherents\r\nof the house of Stuart. Some of them accordingly ventured, from time\r\nto time, to revisit their native country and friends. Amongst others,\r\nDr. Cameron came over in 1749 to recover part of a large sum of money\r\nwhich had been left by Charles in charge of Macpherson of Cluny when\r\nhe quitted Scotland. He made a second journey to Britain in 1753,\r\nfor what particular purpose is not certainly known, although it is\r\nsupposed his visit had some connection with a scheme for another\r\nrising, then under the consideration of the Jacobites, but which\r\nluckily was nipped in the bud. Having been apprehended in Scotland,\r\nhe was carried to London, confined to the Tower, and his identity\r\nbeing proved in the court of king’s bench by several witnesses, he\r\nreceived sentence of death, and was barbarously executed at Tyburn.\r\nHe conducted himself with manly fortitude and decorum, and his\r\nfate was generally pitied.[1352] Some of the best wishers to the\r\nGovernment thought the sacrifice of this unfortunate gentleman a most\r\nunnecessary and wanton act at such a juncture, and at such a distance\r\nof time from the period of his attainder.[1353] It is said that King\r\nGeorge himself, as he reluctantly signed the warrant for Cameron’s\r\nexecution, exclaimed, “Surely there has been too much blood spilt\r\nupon this account already!”\r\n\r\nDown to 1754 Charles kept up a regular communication with his friends\r\nin England, several of whom visited him personally, and though they\r\nsaw many reprehensible things in his conduct, yet they were willing\r\nto make every allowance for the peculiarities of his situation. There\r\nwas one circumstance, however, which they could not overlook. When\r\nin Scotland, Charles had a mistress named Clementina Walkinshaw,\r\nwho, by all accounts, possessed no great attractions, bodily or\r\nmental. Some years after he was sent out of France he sent for this\r\nwoman, who managed to become acquainted with all his plans, and was\r\ntrusted with his most secret correspondence. As Miss Walkinshaw had\r\na sister who acted as housekeeper to Frederick, Prince of Wales, at\r\nLeicester house, all the persons of distinction in England attached\r\nto Charles grew alarmed, being apprehensive that this paramour had\r\nbeen placed in his family by the English ministers. They, therefore,\r\ndespatched a gentleman, named M’Namara, to Paris, where Charles then\r\nwas, with instructions to insist upon Miss Walkinshaw’s removal\r\nfor a certain time from his presence. Mr. M’Namara, who was a man\r\nof excellent understanding, urged the most powerful reasons, and\r\nused all the arts of persuasion to induce him to comply, but to no\r\npurpose. M’Namara then informed him that an immediate interruption\r\nof all correspondence with his most powerful friends in England, and\r\nthe ruin of his interest, would be the certain consequence of his\r\nrefusal; but Charles was inflexible. M’Namara staid some days in\r\nParis beyond the time prescribed, in hopes of ultimately prevailing;\r\nbut all his entreaties and remonstrances were ineffectual. At\r\nparting, M’Namara could not help exclaiming, with great indignation,\r\n“What has your family done, Sir, thus to draw down the vengeance\r\nof Heaven on every branch of it, through so many ages?” During his\r\nconferences with M’Namara, the prince declared that he had no violent\r\npassion, or, indeed, any particular regard for Miss Walkinshaw, and\r\nthat he could see her removed from him without any concern; but that\r\nhe would not receive directions for the regulation of his private\r\nconduct from any man alive. When M’Namara returned to London and\r\nreported Charles’s answer to the gentlemen who had sent him to Paris,\r\nmany of whom were persons of the first rank, and all of them men\r\nof fortune and distinction, they were amazed and confounded, and\r\nresolved at once to break with him.[1354]\r\n\r\nLord Marischal was then residing at Paris as ambassador from the\r\nking of Prussia to the court of Versailles, and was apprised by\r\nM’Namara of everything that passed between him and the prince. Had\r\nM’Namara’s mission been successful, his lordship, whose services\r\nCharles was anxious to obtain, meant, on the expiration of his\r\nembassy, to have entered Charles’s household; but disgusted with the\r\nconduct of the prince, who even had the ingratitude to threaten to\r\npublish the names of his English friends, he declined to take any\r\nfarther interest in his affairs, and embracing the mediation of the\r\nking of Prussia, reconciled himself to the British government.[1355]\r\n\r\nWhen, in the following year, a war with France seemed inevitable,\r\nsome of his French friends petitioned the French court to take\r\nadvantage of this favourable opportunity to make one more attempt\r\nto restore the Stuarts. Charles himself came to France, and appears\r\nto have made exertions in his own behalf, but the time was consumed\r\nin fruitless negotiations, and Charles returned to Italy and the\r\nretirement of private life. It seems to be with this attempt that\r\na document contained among the _Stuart Papers_ is connected. This\r\ndocument purports to be notes of a statement made by a deputation,\r\nsent over to Prince Charles, at a conference with him, drawn up at\r\nhis own desire; it is dated August 15, 1755. If this document is\r\nauthentic, and there seems to be no reason to believe otherwise, the\r\ndeputies must have lectured the prince on his conduct most fearlessly\r\nand outspokenly, and in a manner to which princes are mostly\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIt is not known what reception the deputation met with, or how this\r\nmessage was received by him; but, at his desire, the address was\r\ncommitted to writing, and sent to him. Charles returned an indignant\r\nanswer, informing his “friends” that reason might, and he hoped\r\nshould, always prevail with him, but his own heart deceived him if\r\nthreats or promises ever would. He despised, he said, the malice of\r\nthose who aspersed his character, and considered it below his dignity\r\nto treat them in the terms they deserved. He told them he had long\r\ndesired a churchman from his friends to attend him, but that his\r\nexpectations had been hitherto disappointed.[1356]\r\n\r\nThough Charles at first affected not to feel the indignity offered\r\nto him by the French government, yet it is certain that it left upon\r\nhim an indelible impression, soured his disposition, and tended to\r\nconfirm into a habit the propensity to tippling which he contracted\r\nduring his long and exhausting wanderings in the Highlands. Indeed,\r\nhis mind, which never was of the strongest or noblest type, appears\r\nto have been quite unhinged. During his long incognito he scarcely\r\never corresponded with his afflicted father,--a silence which he said\r\nwas not owing either to neglect or want of duty, but because his\r\nsituation was such that he could do nothing but vent “imprecations\r\nagainst the fatality of being born in such a detestable age.”[1357]\r\nLed away by his passions, and reckless of the feelings or wishes of\r\nothers, he would suffer no control; and so infatuated did he become,\r\nthat in resisting the admonitions of his friends, he thought he was\r\npursuing a course honourable to himself, and dutiful towards the\r\n“honest man,”--his father;[1358] but James was not to be misled by\r\nsuch false notions, and hinted, that though he was happy to find\r\nCharles in such sentiments, yet it was possible that what he might\r\nthink for the best might be otherwise. “Do you,” he asks the prince,\r\n“rightly understand the extensive sense of honour and duty from which\r\nyou say you will never go astray? If you can,” he continues, “keep\r\nup to that rule, you will then be really an honest man, which is the\r\nnew name you give me, and with which I am much pleased, since it\r\nis a title I value more than all those which vanity can desire, or\r\nflattery invent. It is a title we are all obliged to pretend to, and\r\nwhich we may all, without vanity, think we deserve, and unless we\r\ndeserve it, we, in reality, can neither be happy in the next world,\r\nnor even in this, because peace and tranquillity of mind is only the\r\nshare of honest men. The best wish I can therefore make you, is that\r\nyou may yourself long deserve and enjoy that title it would be the\r\nmost effectual means of drawing down God’s blessing upon you.”[1359]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prince Charles Edward Stuart.\r\n\r\nFrom an Original Drawing by Ozias Humphrey, R.A. Taken at Florence\r\n1776.]\r\n\r\nAfter the estrangement of his friends, Charles appears to have given\r\nup all thoughts of restoration, and resided chiefly at Avignon till\r\nshortly before the death of his father, on December 31, 1766, when\r\nhe returned to Italy, fixing his abode at Florence. The Chevalier\r\nhad, for several years, been in a declining state of health, and, for\r\ntwo years before his death, had been confined to his bed-chamber.\r\nHis remains were carried to the church of the parish where he had\r\nresided, and were decorated with all the insignia of royalty. Over\r\nthe bed was this inscription:--“Jacobus Magnæ Britanniæ Rex, Anno\r\nMDCCLXVI.” The body lay in state three days, during which none but\r\nthe Italian princes and British subjects were admitted into the\r\nchurch. The corpse was then removed in procession to St Peter’s\r\nchurch to be interred. By his will, the Chevalier left his real\r\nestate, which yielded about forty thousand crowns per annum,\r\nexclusive of pensions, to Prince Charles. He also left him a box of\r\njewels belonging to the crown of Poland, formerly pledged to the\r\nSobieski family, if not redeemed. The jewels belonging to his own\r\nfamily he directed to be divided between Charles and Henry.\r\n\r\nFrom the state of comparative seclusion in which the Chevalier passed\r\nthe most part of his life, his personal history is less known than\r\neither that of his father, or his son, Charles Edward. His character,\r\nto judge from his correspondence and the many acts of individual\r\nkindness he showed towards his exiled adherents, was benevolent\r\nand estimable. He seems to have been better acquainted with the\r\nprinciples of the English constitution than any of his race, and\r\nwould, had he been called to empire, have very possibly eschewed the\r\ndangerous rock of the prerogative on which his grandfather and father\r\nsplit. His boast was not merely that he was an Englishman, but that,\r\nto use an Italian phrase, there was not “a greater Englishman than\r\nhimself.”[1360]\r\n\r\nAfter his father’s death, Prince Charles retired to Albano, near\r\nRome, where he appears to have lived in great seclusion till the\r\nyear 1772, when the court of Versailles, desirous for its own\r\nselfish purposes to prevent the male line of the house of Stuart\r\nfrom becoming extinct, negotiated a marriage between him and the\r\nyoung princess Louisa Maximiliana Carolina of Stolberg-Gedern; and\r\nthe three Bourbon courts all concurring in the match, a suitable\r\nallowance was settled by them on the prince and his wife. Charles,\r\nwho, in consequence of the refusal of the court of Rome to recognise\r\nthe titles which his father had assumed, had taken that of the Count\r\nof Albany, which when a youth he had used on his travels through\r\nItaly, took up his residence upon his marriage in the neighbourhood\r\nof Florence, whither he was invited by the grand duke of Tuscany.\r\nThe marriage was unfortunate. Charles had lived too long single\r\nto enjoy connubial happiness; and his mind, soured by misfortune\r\nand degraded by dissipation, unfitted him for the discharge of the\r\ndomestic virtues.[1361] An English lady who saw Prince Charles at\r\nRome in 1770, describes him thus:--“The Pretender is naturally above\r\nthe middle size, but stoops excessively; he appears bloated and red\r\nin the face, his countenance heavy and sleepy, which is attributed\r\nto his having given in to excess of drinking, but when a young man\r\nhe must have been esteemed handsome. His complexion is of the fair\r\ntint, his eyes blue, his hair light brown, and the contour of his\r\nface a long oval; he is by no means thin, has a noble person and a\r\ngraceful manner. His dress was scarlet, laced with broad gold lace;\r\nhe wears the blue riband outside of his coat, from which depends a\r\ncameo, antique, as large as the palm of my hand, and he wears the\r\nsame garter and motto as those of the noble St George in England.\r\nUpon the whole, he has a melancholy, mortified appearance.”[1362]\r\n\r\nCharles and the princess lived together uncomfortably till 1780,\r\nCharles, it is said, often treating his youthful, beautiful,\r\naccomplished, and gentle wife with the greatest brutality. In 1777\r\nshe became acquainted with the great Italian dramatist Alfieri, and\r\nthe two immediately conceived for each other a passionate, lasting,\r\nand comparatively pure love; for while her husband lived there is\r\nevery reason to believe that she remained faithful to him. The\r\nprincess left Charles in 1780, and took up her residence with his\r\nbrother the cardinal at Rome, but shortly after removed from that to\r\nBaden and ultimately to Paris, where Alfieri joined her, and they\r\nseparated no more. On her husband’s death, it is understood that she\r\nwas privately married to Alfieri, who died in 1803, she surviving\r\nhim upwards of twenty-one years. When Tuscany fell under the dominion\r\nof Bonaparte, he ordered the princess, then living in Florence,\r\n(she having incurred his displeasure), to repair to Paris. She was\r\nafterwards allowed to return to Florence, where it is said she made\r\na left-handed marriage with a French historical painter, named\r\nFrancis Xavier Fabre, the friend of Alfieri, whom upon her death she\r\nappointed her universal executor.\r\n\r\nAbout 1785, Charles, who must have felt himself at this time a\r\nlonely, homeless, disappointed old man, took to live with him his\r\ndaughter, Charlotte, by Miss Walkinshaw, who was born about 1760.\r\nLittle is known of this lady; she, however, appears to have been of\r\na gentle disposition, and we would fain hope that her presence and\r\ncompanionship helped much to soften the misanthropy and soothe the\r\nbitter spirit of the disappointed aspirant to the British throne.\r\nShortly after his daughter came to live with him, Charles removed to\r\nRome, where in January 1788 he was prostrated by paralysis, and after\r\nan illness of three weeks died on the 31st. He was buried royally\r\nin the church of his brother at Frascati, the body, however, being\r\nafterwards removed to St Peter’s at Rome. Some time before his death,\r\nhe legitimatized his daughter, and as the last act of his shadowy\r\nsovereignty, created her Duchess of Albany, leaving her the greater\r\npart of his private property.[1363] Even down to the time of his\r\ndeath, it would seem he had not entirely relinquished the hope of\r\none day sitting on the throne of his ancestors, for, according to\r\nLord Mahon, he used to keep under his bed a strong box with 12,000\r\nsequins, ready for the expenses of his journey to England whenever he\r\nmight suddenly be called thither.[1364] His daughter, so far as is\r\nknown his sole descendant, survived him only one year.\r\n\r\nWhilst Charles’s partisans have painted him in the most glowing\r\ncolours of admiration, as the paragon of all that is noble and\r\nhigh-minded, others have represented him as a man devoid of any good\r\nand generous feeling,--as despotic, revengeful, ungrateful, and\r\navaricious,--having, in short, all the vices without one of the\r\nredeeming virtues of his race. Paradoxical as the assertion may be,\r\nthere is some truth in both delineations; but considerable abatements\r\nmust be made from the exaggerated eulogies of the one party, as\r\nwell as from the sweeping condemnation of the other. There were, in\r\nfact, as has been well observed, two Charles Edwards. The hero of\r\n1745 was a generous and high-minded youth, who, notwithstanding some\r\nconstitutional defects, merited a better destiny; but the Charles\r\nEdward of a subsequent period was a degraded man, who, dispirited\r\nby misfortune and soured by disappointment, lost all command over\r\nhimself, and became the sport of his passions. He retained, however,\r\nto the close of his existence, a vivid recollection of his early\r\nexploits, and frequently betrayed genuine emotion on hearing any\r\nallusion to Scotland and the Highlanders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medal of Henry, Cardinal Duke of York.\r\n\r\nFrom Original in Antiquarian Museum, Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles was ill in 1784, his brother the cardinal, supposing him\r\nto be on his death-bed, drew up a paper maintaining his pretensions\r\nto the British crown, which, he declared, were in no way prejudiced\r\nor renounced by his retention of the incognito title, Cardinal Duke\r\nof York. A copy of this document he sent to the pope, cardinals,\r\nand various foreign ministers. When his brother the prince did die,\r\nand Henry was left the last and sole representative of the royal\r\nStuart race, he caused a medal to be struck bearing the inscription,\r\n“Henry IX., King of England, by the grace of God, but not by the\r\nwill of men.” This, however, was all the cardinal ever did to\r\nmaintain his right divine to the throne from which his grandfather\r\nfled. He appears to have been perfectly contented with his life as\r\na Roman cardinal, to have been generous and gentle in disposition,\r\nand to have performed his duties faithfully as a minister of the\r\nCatholic Church, although in his own house he is said to have\r\ninsisted upon a strict observance of all the etiquette usual in the\r\nresidence of a reigning sovereign. He had many rich livings both in\r\nItaly and France, but of most of these and of all his wealth and\r\ntreasures, literary, antiquarian, and curious, he was despoiled by\r\nthe emissaries of the French revolution in 1798, when he took refuge\r\nin Venice infirm and destitute. His case was represented to his\r\nsuccessful relative George III., who immediately, and in as delicate\r\na manner as possible, generously settled on the cardinal a pension\r\nfor life of L.4000 a year. The cardinal returned to Rome in 1801, and\r\nresided there till his death in 1807, aged 82 years. He was buried in\r\nSt Peter’s, beside his father and brother, “and a stately monument,\r\nfrom the chisel of Canova, but at charge, as I believe, of the House\r\nof Hanover, has since arisen to the memory of JAMES THE THIRD,\r\nCHARLES THE THIRD, and HENRY THE NINTH, KINGS OF ENGLAND--names which\r\nan Englishman can scarcely read without a smile or a sigh! Often at\r\nthe present day does the British traveller turn from the sunny height\r\nof the Pincian or the carnival throngs of the Corso, to gaze in\r\nthoughtful silence on that sad mockery of human greatness, and that\r\nlast record of ruined hopes!”[1365]\r\n\r\nHenry of York, as we have said, was the last scion of the direct line\r\nof the royal house of Stuart, although he was by no means the last\r\nof the Stuarts, as the genealogy of nearly every royal and princely\r\nhouse of Europe can testify. Much valuable information on this\r\npoint is contained in Mr. Townsend’s _Descendants of the Stuarts_,\r\nwhere the reader will meet with many interesting and a few strange\r\nand startling facts. The Stuart blood, it would seem, enriches the\r\nveins of every Christian sovereign of Europe, and among the European\r\nnoble families will be found many princes who, by the now ignored\r\nand we hope never to be revived, principle of divine hereditary\r\nright, are nearer heirs to the British throne than the Prince of\r\nWales. The heir-of-line of the Stuarts is, we believe, Francis,\r\nex-Duke of Modena, the heiress presumptive being his niece, Maria\r\nTheresa, wife of Prince Louis of Bavaria. Great Britain, however,\r\nis as likely to assert her right to the allegiance of the United\r\nStates as is any of the many descendants of the Stuarts to endeavour\r\nto establish a claim to the throne of England, to the prejudice of\r\nthe reigning family. The Lady who at present occupies the throne of\r\nBritain, and in whose veins runs a large share of the ancient Stuart\r\nblood, has won her way to the hearts of all classes of her subjects,\r\nHighland and Lowland, by her true nobility of character, genuine\r\nwomanliness, and anxious interest in the welfare of her people, as\r\neffectually as did the young Chevalier by his youthful thoughtless\r\ndaring, fascinating manners, and feigned enthusiasm for all that was\r\nHighland. Still the ancient spirit is not dead, and probably never\r\nwill die, so long as Gaelic and Lowland Scotch is understood in the\r\nland, and so long as there exists such a superabundance of Jacobite\r\nsongs unmatched for pathos and humour, and set to music which cannot\r\nfail to touch the heart of the “canniest Scot” that ever tried to\r\noverreach his neighbour. This sentimental Jacobitism, initiated\r\nby Scott, appears to be getting stronger and stronger every year,\r\nand pervades all classes of society from the “queen on the throne\r\nto the meanest of her subjects;” it has, indeed, become now to a\r\ncertain extent fashionable, no doubt owing largely to the example\r\nset by the greatest lady in the land, in her love and admiration\r\nof the Highlands and Highlanders. Tartans, not very many years ago\r\nproscribed and forbidden to be worn under severe penalties, and\r\nregarded as barbarous and vulgar, have now become the rage, and are\r\nas indispensable to every Scottish family, Highland or Lowland, as\r\nits crest or its family ghost.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing entirely the Stuart family, which latterly was\r\nso intimately associated with the Highlands, it may not be out of\r\nplace to mention that only a few years ago, two young men made their\r\nappearance in Scotland, holding themselves forth as legitimate\r\ngrandsons of Prince Charles. Their story, set forth in an inflated,\r\nmisty style, after the manner of romantic novelists, will be found in\r\na work published by them in 1847, entitled, _Tales of the Century,\r\nor Sketches of the Romance of History between the years 1746 and\r\n1846_. There can be no doubt that John Sobieski and Charles Edward\r\nStuart, the names by which these gentlemen made themselves known\r\nto the public, have no connection whatever with the royal Stuarts:\r\nit is certain that Prince Charles Edward Stuart left behind him\r\nno legitimate offspring. The story told by them in the above\r\npublication, however, was to the effect that their father, instead\r\nof being a son of Admiral Allen, as was commonly supposed, was a\r\nson of Prince Charles and the Princess Louisa, whose birth was kept\r\nsecret through fear of the Hanoverian family, and who was intrusted\r\nto Admiral Allen, and passed off by him as his own son.[1366] It is\r\nnot at all improbable that they themselves believed their own story,\r\nand were, strictly speaking, no impostors; at all events, they appear\r\nto have met with considerable sympathy in the form of hospitality\r\nand subscriptions to their publications, for besides the book above\r\nmentioned and a volume of poems, they published a large and expensive\r\nwork, splendidly illustrated, entitled, _The Costume of the Clans_,\r\na copy of which was ordered at the time for her Majesty’s library.\r\nTo judge from the introduction to this last book, occupying about\r\nthe half of the work, written in a most painfully lofty style, and\r\nhaving an amusing look of learning by being crammed full of small\r\ntype notes and enigmatical references, one would be almost inclined\r\nto think that they were weak-minded enough to believe that it was\r\npossible, even in the middle of the 19th century, in the reign of\r\nQueen Victoria, to incite the loyal Highlanders to enact a second\r\n’45.[1367]\r\n\r\nJohn Sobieski Stuart generally resides in London, where he is to be\r\nmet with in good society under the title of “Count D’Albanie.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1340] “Letter from H---- G----, Esquire, one of the gentlemen of the\r\nbed-chamber to the young Chevalier, and the only person of his own\r\nretinue that attended him from Avignon, in his late journey through\r\nGermany and elsewhere, &c., to a particular friend. London, 1750.”\r\n\r\n[1341] Klose’s _Memoirs of Prince Charles_, vol. ii. p. 199.\r\n\r\n[1342] Charles alludes to this visit in a note dated 1st July, 1754,\r\nin his own hand-writing, among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1343] _Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[1344] See a curious memorandum, dated 3d May, 1750, among the\r\n_Stuart Papers_. From this document it is evident that Charles\r\nthought that the French ministry were bribed by the British\r\ngovernment to withhold assistance from him.\r\n\r\n[1345] King’s _Political and Literary Anecdotes_, p. 197:--“He came,”\r\nsays Dr. King, “one evening to my lodgings and drank tea with me.\r\nMy servant, after he was gone, said to me, ‘that he thought my new\r\nvisitor very like Prince Charles.’ ‘Why,’ said I, ‘have you ever seen\r\nPrince Charles?’ ‘No, sir,’ replied the fellow, ‘but this gentleman,\r\nwhoever he may be, exactly resembles the busts which are sold in\r\nRed Lion Street, and are said to be the busts of Prince Charles.’\r\nThe truth is, these busts were taken in plaster of Paris from his\r\nface. I never heard him,” adds the doctor--who, however, cannot be\r\nreceived as an altogether unbiassed reporter--“express any noble or\r\nbenevolent sentiment, the certain indications of a great soul and a\r\ngood heart; or discover any sorrow or compassion for the misfortunes\r\nof so many worthy men who had suffered in his cause. But the most\r\nodious part of his character was his love of money.... I have known\r\nthis gentleman with 2000 Louis d’ors in his strong-box pretend he\r\nwas in great distress, and borrow money from a lady in Paris who was\r\nnot in affluent circumstances. His most faithful servants, who had\r\nclosely attended him in all his difficulties, were ill rewarded. To\r\nthis spirit of avarice may be added his insolent manner of treating\r\nhis immediate dependants, very unbecoming a great prince, _and a sure\r\nprognostic of what might be expected from him if ever he acquired the\r\nsovereign power_.”\r\n\r\n[1346] See the letter to Earl Marischal and the instructions to\r\nGoring, both dated 21st June, 1751, among the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1347] Letter from Sir James Harrington, dated 6th August, 1751,\r\namong the _Stuart Papers_.\r\n\r\n[1348] Letter, Mr. Donald Mackintosh to Secretary Edgar, dated from\r\nCivita Vecchia, 6th February, 1754.--_Stuart Papers._\r\n\r\n[1349] He is said on this occasion to have called without previous\r\nnotice on Lady Primrose, and to have walked into the room, where she\r\nand others were playing cards, being announced by the servant under\r\nanother name. After he left it was remarked how like he was to the\r\nprince’s portrait which hung in the very room into which he entered.\r\nHe is said on this occasion to have used so little precaution that\r\nhe went abroad undisguised in daylight, walking once through St.\r\nJames’s, and taking a turn in Pall Mall. This story looks very\r\nlike another version of his visit in 1750.

Charles seems to have been desirous\r\nafter this to have none but Protestants about him. He sent an order\r\nto Avignon, in November 1753, to dismiss all his “Papist servants.”\r\nHe kept at this time a French mistress, and having quarrelled with\r\nher, he discarded her because she was “a Papist too.” The following\r\nnote, also, in the prince’s hand, appears on the back of a letter of\r\nWaters the banker, of 26th June, 1754:--“My being a Protestant I can\r\nprove to be an advantage to the Papist, and my terrible situation\r\nnot to be incapable to attempt any plan either against my honour or\r\ninterest, seeing them that are so far from my country.” At this time\r\n(June 1754) Charles was living in Paris incognito.\r\n\r\n[1351] See his answer to the deputation that waited on him in the\r\nyear 1755:--\r\n\r\n“As to his religion,” says Dr. King, “he is certainly free from\r\nall bigotry and superstition, and would readily conform to the\r\nreligion of the country. With the Catholics he is a Catholic, with\r\nthe Protestants he is a Protestant; and to convince the latter of\r\nhis sincerity, he often carried an English Common Prayer-book in\r\nhis pocket, and sent to Gordon (whom I have mentioned before), a\r\nnon-juring clergyman, to christen the first child he had by his\r\nmistress, Mrs. Walkinshaw.”\r\n\r\n[1352] Klose’s _Memoirs of Prince Charles_, vol. ii. p. 208.\r\n\r\n[1353] The French government settled a pension of 1200 livres per\r\nannum upon his widow, and granted an annual allowance of 400 livres\r\nto each of his two sons who were in its service, in addition to their\r\npay.\r\n\r\n[1354] King’s Political and Literary Anecdotes, p. 264, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1355] Several letters between Charles and Lord Marischal will be\r\nfound among the _Stuart Papers_.

Among the _Stuart Papers_ is\r\nthe following written by Charles about the time of his marriage:--“As\r\nfor men, I have studied them myself, and were I to live till\r\nfourscore, I could scarcely know them better than now, but as for\r\nwomen, I have thought it useless, they being so much more wicked and\r\nimpenetrable.” “Ungenerous and ungrateful words,” justly exclaims\r\nLord Mahon; “surely as he wrote them, the image of Flora Macdonald\r\nshould have risen in his heart and restrained his hand.”--Mahon’s\r\n_England_, v. iii., p. 527.\r\n\r\n[1362] Letters from Italy by an Englishwoman, London, 1776.

It is understood,\r\n  also, that they do not encourage much reference being made to those\r\n  claims, which they consider to amount only to the fact of their being\r\n  descended from Prince Charles, not to any ‘Divine Right’ to the\r\n  throne in virtue of that descent; that right having been forfeited,\r\n  they believe, by the fact of themselves and their ancestors having\r\n  been Roman Catholics--the nation having declared for a Protestant\r\n  succession. It looks also as if they depended on the strength of\r\n  truth, or what they believe to be truth, that they have never\r\n  answered the criticisms of the _Quarterly_ reviewer, whilst at the\r\n  same time it is understood that they maintain that they could answer\r\n  him, if they were so minded. They bore a high character during their\r\n  residence in the Highlands of Scotland, which character they still\r\n  retain. It is some time since the writer of this note has seen them,\r\n  but the resemblance which their features bore to the features of the\r\n  ancient Stuart race used to be remarked by all who knew them. This,\r\n  however, would not prove much. Even the _Quarterly_ reviewer does not\r\n  allege that they were _conscious_ or knowingly impostors.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n  Proceedings which followed Culloden, their cause and\r\n  consequences--Influence of clan-feeling--Lord Lovat and\r\n  the Frasers--Parliamentary measures--Disarming Act--Act\r\n  against the Highland dress--Abolition of Hereditary\r\n  Jurisdictions--The Scottish Episcopalians--Effect of these\r\n  measures--The Old Jacobites--The Jacobite Songs--Whig\r\n  Songs--Sir Walter Scott--Jacobitism at the present day--Queen\r\n  Victoria--Innovations, and their probable consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harsh military proceedings which followed the battle of Culloden,\r\nof which we have already endeavoured to give the reader an idea,\r\nseem to have completely crushed the spirit out of the poor, and, in\r\nmany cases, innocent Highlanders. The Duke of Cumberland and his\r\nsubordinates exercised, as we have seen, no discrimination in the\r\nselection of their victims, laying their bloody clutches on chiefs\r\nand people, him who had been “out” and him who had not; it was\r\nsufficient to bring slaughter, slavery, or ruin on a man and his\r\nfamily, if he bore upon or about him any mark of Highland origin or\r\nconnection,--wore a kilt, or could not justify himself in English.\r\nThe end which it was intended to accomplish by these cruel and\r\nsaddening measures, was no doubt in the main highly desirable; it\r\nwas well to let it be distinctly known once for all, that the divine\r\nhereditary right of ruling could be conferred only by the people, and\r\nthat these would bestow the post of king on him who could fill it\r\nbest, and who would by no caprices of his own obstruct the progress\r\nof the nation. It was assuredly right and absolutely necessary that\r\nthe Highlanders should be made clearly to understand that they\r\nlived in the middle of the 18th century, and were only a very small\r\npart of a great nation which was leading the march of the world’s\r\nprogress, and that, instead of doing their best to pull their country\r\nback a century, they should lend the aid of the many valuable and\r\nnoble qualities with which they were endowed, but which were running\r\ncomparatively waste, to enable Britain to keep her proud position in\r\nthe van of the nations, and help the world on in its glorious course\r\nof progress, to try to stop which would certainly lead to their own\r\ndestruction. It was, we say, high time that such a splendid race of\r\nmen should be roused out of self-satisfied slumber and brought to\r\ntheir senses, but surely there was some gentler method of effecting\r\nthis than by thrusting a sword into their hearts or blowing out\r\ntheir bewildered brains; their tendency to rebellion was no disease\r\nwhich required to be “stamped out,” but merely the result of much\r\nunoccupied energy, which only required proper direction in order to\r\nbecome a blessing instead of a curse to their fellow-countrymen. No\r\none, possessing ordinary human feeling, can regard the proceedings\r\nwhich followed Culloden, and which were continued for many months,\r\nwith any feelings but those of pity, sadness, and horror, combined\r\nwith loathing at those who were so inhuman as to carry out the bloody\r\nwork of wholesale butchery and ruin. We of the present day regard the\r\nHighlanders of ’45 as a chivalrous, impulsive, simple-minded race,\r\nwho really wished to do no one any harm, and perhaps we are to a\r\ncertain extent right. But, as at the time of the massacre of Glencoe,\r\ntheir southern fellow-countrymen looked upon them as a pestiferous\r\nrace of semi-barbarians, enemies to progress, “thieves and lawless\r\nlimmers,” who, like vermin, should be annihilated, or at least for\r\never incapacitated from doing harm to any but themselves. This seems\r\nespecially to have been the case with the Duke of Cumberland, who was\r\nutterly incapable of regarding the Highlanders in any other light\r\nthan as a set of barbarous villains, to whom no mercy ought to be\r\nshown. Writing, April 4, 1746, to the Duke of Newcastle, he says,\r\n“All in this country are almost to a man Jacobites, and mild measures\r\nwill not do. You will find that the whole laws of this ancient\r\nkingdom must be new modelled. Were I to enumerate the villains and\r\nvillanies this country abounds in, I should never have done.” And\r\nagain, July 17, “I am sorry to leave this country in the condition it\r\nis in; for all the good that we have done is a little blood-letting,\r\nwhich has only weakened the madness, but not at all cured it; and _I\r\ntremble for fear that this vile spot may still be the ruin of this\r\nisland and of our family_.” From a man of Cumberland’s character,\r\ncherishing such feelings as the above towards an enemy in his power,\r\nwhat other course of conduct was to be expected than that which he\r\nfollowed, more especially when it is remembered that these feelings\r\nmust have been considerably aggravated by the defeats which the\r\nroyal army had already sustained. On this last account the royal\r\nsoldiers themselves must have cherished more than usually bitter\r\nfeelings towards their opponents; for what can be more chagrining to\r\nregularly disciplined troops than to be routed by a wretchedly armed\r\nrabble of half naked, untrained men, in which light the royal army\r\nmust have regarded the Highlanders. These special causes, added to\r\nthe insatiable thirst for blood which seems to take possession of a\r\nvictorious army, sufficiently account for the inhuman, heartless,\r\nand uncalled for treatment of the Highlanders after the battle of\r\nCulloden. Good as the end was, the means was utterly unjustifiable\r\nand abhorrent.\r\n\r\nThe end, however, was accomplished. The spirit of the Highlanders was\r\ntotally broken; they were left completely prostrate, broken hearted,\r\nand bleeding, with no power left of further disturbing the peace of\r\nthe kingdom, and with little inclination, at least among the great\r\nmajority of the clansmen, to lend their aid towards another rising.\r\nIndeed, it is well known that, so far as the mass of the clansmen, as\r\ndistinguished from the chiefs and tacksmen, were concerned, they were\r\nentirely the tools of their superiors, and were ready, according as\r\ntheir chiefs ordered, either to espouse the cause of Prince Charles,\r\nor to be loyal to the existing government. There is not a better\r\ninstance of the indifference of the common Highlanders as to whom\r\nthey fought for, than the conduct of the clan Fraser in the rebellion\r\nof 1715. At the time this rebellion broke out, Lovat was in France,\r\nthe headship of the clan being assumed by Mackenzie of Fraserdale,\r\nwho favoured the cause of the Stuarts, and who had joined the Earl\r\nof Mar at Perth with 400 of the Frasers, many other members of the\r\nclan remaining neutral till the pleasure of Simon, their real chief,\r\nshould be known. Lovat returned from France, espoused the side of\r\nKing George, in which he was immediately followed by the neutral\r\nFrasers, while those who were in the camp of Marr left it to a man,\r\nand joined themselves to him whom they regarded as their rightful\r\nchief. Such was the strength of the clannish principle, and such\r\nthe indifference of the majority of the Highlanders as to which\r\nside they espoused, so long as they pleased their chief, to please\r\nwhom, they had been taught from their infancy, was the first and\r\ngreat commandment, to offend him being little better than banishment\r\nor death. To say the least, then, how utterly indiscriminating and\r\nshameful was the cruel conduct of “Butcher” Cumberland and his\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nThe cruel and unconstitutional method of punishing the Highland\r\nrebels, and crushing the sting out of them, adopted by Cumberland,\r\nwas at length put a stop to about the month of August, the Civil\r\nCourts successfully asserting their supremacy over military licence\r\nand coercion. Parliament set itself to devise and adopt such measures\r\nas it thought would be calculated to assimilate the Highlands with\r\nthe rest of the kingdom, and deprive the Highlanders of the power to\r\ncombine successfully in future against the established government. To\r\neffect these ends, Parliament, in 1746 and 1747, passed various Acts,\r\nby which it was ordained that the Highlanders should be disarmed,\r\ntheir peculiar dress laid aside, and the heritable jurisdictions and\r\nwardholding abolished.\r\n\r\nMarshal Wade, in 1725, seems really to have succeeded in confiscating\r\na very considerable number of good, useful arms, although the pawky\r\nHighlanders managed to throw a glamour over even his watchful eyes,\r\nand secrete many weapons for use when occasion should offer. Still,\r\nthat arms were scarce in the Highlands after this, is shown by\r\nthe rude and unmilitary character of the weapons possessed by the\r\nmajority of the rebel army previous to the battle of Prestonpans;\r\nthere, many of the Highlanders were able to exchange their irregular\r\nand ugly, but somewhat formidable weapons for government firelocks\r\nand bayonets. Still Culloden, and the merciless oppression which\r\nfollowed, more than annulled all that the Highlanders had gained in\r\nthis and other respects by their previous success; so that those\r\nwho had the enforcing of the disarming Act would have comparatively\r\nlittle work to do, and were not likely to meet with much opposition\r\nin performing it. Severe penalties were threatened upon any who dared\r\nto keep possession of weapons after the Act came in force; for the\r\nfirst offence the delinquent was liable to a heavy fine, to be sent\r\nto serve as a soldier in America, or, if unfit for service, to be\r\nimprisoned for six months. Seven years’ transportation followed the\r\nsecond offence.\r\n\r\nThere can, we think, be no doubt as to the wisdom and prudence of\r\nthis Act if judiciously and thoroughly carried out, although the\r\npenalties certainly do seem too severe. It seems to have accomplished\r\nits purpose: “the last law,” says Dr. Johnson,[1368] “by which the\r\nHighlanders are deprived of their arms, has operated with efficacy\r\nbeyond expectation ... the arms were collected with such rigour,\r\nthat every house was despoiled of its defence.” Not only was\r\nthis disarming of the Highlanders effectual in preventing future\r\nrebellion, but also helped considerably to soften and render less\r\ndangerous their daily intercourse with each other. Formerly it was\r\nquite a common occurrence for the least difference of opinion between\r\ntwo Highlanders--whose bristling pride is always on the rise--to\r\nbe followed by high words and an ultimate appeal to weapons, in\r\nwhich the original combatants were often joined by their respective\r\nfriends, the result being a small battle ending in one or more deaths\r\nand many wounds. The Disarming Act tended to make such occurrences\r\nextremely rare.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly great room for doubting the wisdom which prompted\r\nthe enactment that followed the above, enforcing the discontinuance\r\nof the peculiar dress of the Highlanders. By this Act, “Any person\r\nwithin Scotland, whether man or boy (excepting officers and soldiers\r\nin his majesty’s service), who should wear the plaid, philibeg,\r\ntrews, shoulder belts, or any part of the Highland garb, or\r\nshould use for great coats, tartans, or parti-coloured plaid, or\r\nstuffs, should, without the alternative of a fine, be imprisoned\r\nfor the first conviction for six months, without bail, and on the\r\nsecond conviction be transported for seven years.”[1369] Of all\r\nthe medicines administered by the government physicians to the\r\nHighlanders at this time, this was certainly the most difficult for\r\nthem to swallow, and the one least calculated to serve the purpose\r\nfor which it was intended. As to the other enactments made by\r\ngovernment to keep down rebellion, the Highlanders could not but feel\r\nthat those in power were only doing what common prudence dictated.\r\nBut this interference in a matter so personal and apparently so\r\nharmless as that of dress, this prohibition of a costume so national,\r\nancient (at least in fashion), and characteristic as that of the\r\nHighlanders, seemed to them an act of mere wanton and insulting\r\noppression, intended to degrade them, and without purpose, to outrage\r\ntheir most cherished and harmless prejudices. They seem to have felt\r\nit as keenly as any officer would feel the breaking of his sword or\r\nthe tearing off of his epaulets, or as the native troops, previous\r\nto the Indian mutiny, felt the imposition of greased cartridges. It\r\nhumbled and irritated them far more than did any of the other acts,\r\nor even than the outrages and barbarities which followed Culloden;\r\ninstead of eradicating their national spirit, and assimilating them\r\nin all respects with the Lowland population, it rather intensified\r\nthat spirit, and their determination to preserve themselves a\r\nseparate and peculiar people, besides throwing in their way an\r\nadditional and unnecessary temptation to break the laws. A multitude\r\nof prohibitory statutes is always irritating to a people, and serves\r\nonly to multiply offences and demoralize a nation; it is generally\r\na sign of weakness and great lack of wisdom in a government. This\r\nenactment as to the Highland dress was as unwise as religious\r\nintolerance, which is invariably a nurse of discord, a promoter of\r\nsectarianism. This Act surrounded the Highland dress with a sort of\r\nsacred halo, raised it into a badge of nationality, and was probably\r\nthe means of perpetuating and rendering popular the use of a habit,\r\nwhich, had it been left alone, might long ere now have died a natural\r\ndeath, and been found only in our museums, side by side with the\r\nLochaber axe, the two-handed sword, and the nail-studded shield.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious President Forbes--to whom, had the government perceived\r\nclearly the country’s true interest, they would have entirely\r\nintrusted the legislation for the Highlands--had but a poor opinion\r\nof the dress bill, as will appear from the following letter of his\r\nto the Lord Lyon, dated July 8, 1746:--“The garb is certainly very\r\nloose, and fits men inured to it to go through great fatigues, to\r\nmake very quick marches, to bear out against the inclemency of the\r\nweather, to wade through rivers, and shelter in huts, woods, and\r\nrocks upon occasion; which men dressed in the low country garb\r\ncould not possibly endure. But then it is to be considered, that,\r\nas the Highlands are circumstanced at present, it is, at least it\r\nseems to me to be, an utter impossibility, without the advantage\r\nof this dress, for the inhabitants to tend their cattle, and to go\r\nthrough the other parts of their business, without which they could\r\nnot subsist; not to speak of paying rents to their landlords. Now,\r\nbecause too many of the Highlanders have offended, to punish all the\r\nrest who have not, and who, I will venture to say, are the greatest\r\nnumber, in so severe a manner, seems to be unreasonable; especially\r\nas, in my poor apprehension, it is unnecessary, on the supposal the\r\ndisarming project be properly secured; and I must confess, that the\r\nsalvo which you speak of, of not suffering the regulation to extend\r\nto the well-affected Clans, is not to my taste; because, though\r\nit would save them from hardships, yet the making so remarkable a\r\ndistinction would be, as I take it, to list all those on whom the\r\nbill should operate for the Pretender, which ought to be avoided if\r\npossible.”[1370] General Stewart perhaps speaks too strongly when\r\nhe remarks, that had the whole Highland race been decimated, more\r\nviolent grief, indignation, and shame, could not have been excited\r\namong them, than by being deprived of this long inherited costume.\r\nHowever, it should be remembered that all this was the legislation of\r\nupwards of 120 years ago, that the difficulties which the government\r\nhad to face were serious and trying, that those who had the making\r\nof these laws were totally ignorant of the real character of the\r\nHighlanders, and of the real motives which urged them to rebellion,\r\nand that even at the present day legislative blunders do occasionally\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe means by which the Highlanders endeavoured to elude this law\r\nwithout incurring a penalty, were ingenious and amusing. Stewart\r\ntells us that, “instead of the prohibited tartan kilt, some wore\r\npieces of a blue, green, or red thin cloth, or coarse camblet,\r\nwrapped round the waist, and hanging down to the knees like the\r\nfealdag.[1371] The tight breeches were particularly obnoxious. Some,\r\nwho were fearful of offending, or wished to render obedience to the\r\nlaw, which had not specified on what part of the body the breeches\r\nwere to be worn, satisfied themselves with having in their possession\r\nthis article of legal and loyal dress, which, either as the signal\r\nof their submission, or more probably to suit their own convenience\r\nwhen on journeys, they often suspended over their shoulders upon\r\ntheir sticks; others, who were either more wary, or less submissive,\r\nsewed up the centre of the kilt with a few stitches between the\r\nthighs, which gave it something of the form of the trousers worn\r\nby Dutch skippers.” The Act at first appears to have been carried\r\nout with rigid strictness, these ingenious attempts at evading it\r\nbeing punished somewhat severely; but, if we may judge from a trial\r\nwhich took place in 1757, the administrators of the law had by that\r\ntime come to regard such breaches with a lenient eye. Although no\r\ndoubt the law in course of time became practically obsolete, it was\r\nnot till 1782 that it was erased from the statute book. Since then\r\n“tartans and kilts an’ a’, an’ a’,” have gradually increased in\r\npopularity, until now they have become “the rage” with all classes of\r\nsociety, from John o’Groats to Land’s End; tartan plaids, of patterns\r\nwhich do great credit to the ingenuity of the manufacturers, are seen\r\neverywhere adorning the graceful forms of ladies, and the not so long\r\nsince proscribed kilt being found not unfrequently displaying itself\r\nin the most fashionable London Assemblies. _Tempora mutantur._\r\n\r\nBy far the most important measure adopted by government for the\r\nimprovement of the Highlands was the abolition of the Hereditary\r\nJurisdictions, which lay at the root of many of the evils that\r\nafflicted that country, and to which, in a great degree, the\r\nrebellion owed the measure of success that attended it. Before these\r\njurisdictions were abolished, a Highland chief was as absolute a\r\npotentate over the members of his clan as any eastern pasha or\r\nAfrican chief is over his abject subjects. The power of “pit and\r\ngallows,” as it was called, which belonged to each of these petty\r\nsovereignties--for such they were practically--gave the chief\r\nabsolute command of the lives and liberty of his followers. The\r\nonly thing he lawfully could not do was to banish; but even this\r\nprohibition he managed to evade by giving his victims the alternative\r\nof “emigration”--as it was mildly called--or death. This is not\r\nthe place to enter into a minute account of the origin and working\r\nof this curious system, so utterly inconsistent with the spirit of\r\na constitutional government like that of Britain; but any one can\r\nperceive that such a power as this in the hands of a discontented\r\nchief, especially when complemented by the high notions which a\r\nHighlander had of the obedience due to the head of the clan, must\r\nhave been dangerous in the highest degree to the peace and progress\r\nof the country. There is no doubt that this coercive power was\r\nfrequently brought into play in the late rebellion; indeed, the only\r\nplea urged by a great majority of the common Highlanders, when tried\r\nat Carlisle and elsewhere, was that they were forced into rebellion\r\nagainst their wills. Of course a prudent chief would be careful not\r\nto carry his power beyond due bounds, at least so far as the members\r\nof his own clan were concerned, for there was a point in the scale\r\nof oppression which even the strong spirit of clanship could not\r\nstand. No doubt the power thus entrusted to the chiefs may at one\r\ntime have served a good purpose. When the country was in a turbulent\r\nand unsettled state, when communication between the different parts\r\nof the country was tedious, expensive, and hazardous, when it was\r\ndifficult for the strong arm of the law to reach to a remote, rugged,\r\nand inaccessible district like the Highlands, where life and the\r\nrights of property were as little regarded as they are at the present\r\nday in Ireland,--perhaps this putting of the power of a judge in\r\nthe hands of the chief men of the various districts, was the only\r\npracticable substitute for the direct administration of justice by\r\nthose to whom this duty properly belonged. In reality, the justice\r\nmeted out was of the roughest kind, and continually liable to be\r\nmodified by the interests of the administrator, or any of his many\r\nfriends. “That such a system should have been tolerated into the\r\nmiddle of the 18th century, after Somers, Hardwicke, and Forbes had\r\noccupied the bench, may seem incredible, but it is true.”[1372]\r\nIt was assuredly high time that such an anomalous state of matters\r\nshould be done away with.[1373]\r\n\r\nAn Act for the abolition of the Hereditary Jurisdictions was passed\r\nin March 1747, and came in force a year after. Of course some other\r\nplan for the administration of the laws had to be devised. “At the\r\nhead of the arrangements for carrying justice throughout the land,\r\nthe system begun in England in the reign of Henry II., for sending\r\nthe royal courts at fixed intervals through the provinces, was\r\nadopted. Nominally there had been circuits or justice-ayres, but they\r\nwere not systematically held, either at stated intervals of time,\r\nor so as to bring up before them the revisal of the administration\r\nof justice in all the districts. This, indeed, was impossible while\r\nthe hereditary jurisdictions remained, but now regular circuits were\r\nto take place biennially, and the country was so partitioned into\r\ndistricts, that the higher offences were systematically brought up\r\nfrom the most remote provinces for adjudication. The exceptional\r\nhereditary jurisdictions, such as the regalities, were abolished, and\r\nthe smaller authority exercised in baronial courts was restricted\r\nto trifling matters. The sheriff courts, locally commensurate in\r\ntheir authority with the boundaries of the counties, were taken as\r\nthe foundation of a system of local tribunals, presided over by\r\nresponsible judges. These, which were hereditary, were to be yielded\r\nto the crown; and ever since the passing of the act, the sheriff\r\nof each county has been appointed like the other judges, for life,\r\nremoveable only for misconduct.”[1374]\r\n\r\nOf course, as these jurisdictions, besides conferring influence and\r\npower, were sources of emolument[1375] to the holders of them, and as\r\nthey had been sanctioned in the treaty of Union, it was considered\r\nonly fair that some compensation should be allowed by the country to\r\nthose who profited by them; in fact, they had to be bought up. The\r\nholders of the jurisdictions appear to have been asked to send in the\r\namount of their claims to the Court of Session, which was authorised\r\nto fix the price to be paid. Of course, those who were convicted or\r\nattainted for having taken part in the late rebellion, had no claim,\r\nas their estates were forfeited to the Crown, and they themselves\r\ndeprived of all their privileges. Those who were about to part with\r\ntheir ancient powers were determined to make the most of them now\r\nthat they were no longer to be a perpetual source of emolument and\r\ninfluence. The aggregate sum asked by the proprietors from government\r\nas the price of their jurisdictions was more than three times greater\r\nthan that which the Court of Session deemed a fair price. There may\r\nbe some truth in what Mr. Fraser-Mackintosh says in his _Antiquarian\r\nNotes_[1376]:--“Of course, the amounts ultimately paid bore not the\r\nslightest proportion to the claims, but they did bear some proportion\r\nto the politics of the holders, just as these happened to be friendly\r\nto government or the reverse.” Argyll, for the Justice-Generalship\r\nof Argyll, asked £15,000, for the Sheriffdom £5000, and for various\r\nsmall regalities other £5000, making £25,000 in all; from this\r\nthe Court of Session deducted only £4000, allowing him for his\r\nvarious offices and jurisdictions what would then be considered the\r\nmunificent sum of £21,000. Besides receiving this sum, the duke was\r\nappointed, in exchange for his office of Hereditary Justiciar of\r\nScotland, Lord Justice-General, head of the Justiciary Court. The\r\nDuke of Montrose, for his various regalities, and the Sheriffdom\r\nof Dumbarton, demanded £15,000, but did not get above one third\r\nof that sum; nor did the Dukes of Buccleuch and Athole, who each\r\nmodestly valued his various offices at £17,000. The Duke of Gordon’s\r\nclaim amounted to £22,300, the Earl of Sutherland’s to £10,800,\r\nBreadalbane’s to £7000, Moray’s to £14,000, Findlater’s to £5,500.\r\nThe smallest sum claimed for a Highland jurisdiction was by Evan\r\nBaillie, of Abriachan, for the Bailliary of Lovat, which he modestly\r\nvalued at £166; Munro, Sheriff-Clerk of Inverness, claiming the same\r\nsum for that office combined with the Clerkship of the regality of\r\nLovat. The total amount claimed for the whole of the jurisdictions\r\nwas upwards of £490,000, which the Court of Session cut down to a\r\nlittle over £150,000.[1377] The sum was well spent in doing away with\r\nso many sources of petty tyranny and injustice, in the abolition of\r\na system inconsistent with the spirit of the British constitution\r\nin the middle of the 18th century, calculated materially to hinder\r\nprogress and to aid rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of these jurisdictions in the Highlands, and along\r\nwith them the power and paternal authority of the Highland chiefs,\r\neffected a complete change in the social life of that part of the\r\ncountry, led at first to considerable discontent and confusion, and\r\nwas the indirect means of bringing much suffering and hardship on\r\nthe subordinate dignitaries and commonalty of the clans. Some such\r\nconsequences were to be expected from the breaking up of a system\r\nwhich had held sway for many generations, and the substitution of\r\na state of matters to which the people were altogether unused, and\r\nwhich ran counter to all their prejudices and traditions; still,\r\nas in the case of every reformation, individual suffering was to\r\nbe looked for, and in the course of time, as will be seen, matters\r\ngradually righted themselves, and the Highlands became as progressive\r\nand prosperous as any other part of the country.\r\n\r\nAnother much needed measure adopted by government was the abolition\r\nof a remnant of feudality, the kind of tenure known as “wardholding.”\r\n“By this relic of ancient feudality, military service had remained\r\ndown to that juncture the condition under which lands were held\r\nby one subject from another. Efforts were of course made to bring\r\nland into commerce, by substituting pecuniary arrangements for such\r\nservices, but the ‘wardholding’ was so essentially the proper feudal\r\nusage, that the lawyers held it to be always understood, if some\r\nother arrangements were not very specifically settled. It had become\r\nthe means of very oppressive exactions or ‘casualties,’ arising out\r\nof those conditions--such as minority--where the military service\r\ncould not be performed. But by the act of 1746, arrangements were\r\ndevised for converting all the superior’s privileges into reasonable\r\npecuniary claims.”[1378]\r\n\r\nAnother means taken by government to extinguish the seeds of\r\nrebellion and prevent its future occurrence, was the enactment of\r\nmore stringent laws in reference to the Scottish Episcopalians, among\r\nwhom Jacobite sympathies were almost as strong and as universal as\r\namong their Roman Catholic brethren. Their partiality to the house\r\nof Stuart was no doubt in a great measure owing to their strong\r\nbelief as a class in divine right of government, both in Church and\r\nState, and to a conviction that seems to have prevailed among them\r\nthat the restoration of the Stuarts meant the restoration of the\r\nsupremacy, or at least establishment of episcopacy in Scotland. The\r\nStuarts had not more devoted adherents than the Episcopalians in\r\nthe kingdom, nor any who, amidst many petty, irritating, and even\r\nsevere enactments, continued longer to adhere to their first love.\r\nIndeed, there is good reason for believing that at the present day,\r\namong many Scottish Episcopalians, especially in the Highlands, there\r\nare still many Jacobites in sentiment and sympathy, although, as a\r\nprinciple of action, Jacobitism is undoubtedly dead and gone, never\r\nto be resuscitated.\r\n\r\nAs this party, though not numerous, was not less formidable from\r\nits rank and wealth than from the _esprit de corps_ with which it\r\nwas animated, the attention of the legislature was directed towards\r\nit, and a strong measure was resorted to, which nothing could\r\njustify but necessity. This was an act by which it was ordained\r\nthat any episcopal clergyman officiating after the 1st of September\r\n1746, without having previously taken the oaths of allegiance,\r\nabjuration, and assurance, or without praying once during the\r\nperformance of worship for the king, his heirs, and successors, and\r\nfor all the royal family, should for the first offence suffer six\r\nmonths imprisonment, for the second be transported to the American\r\nplantations for life, and, in case of returning from banishment, be\r\nsubjected to perpetual imprisonment. By another enactment it was\r\ndeclared that no peer of Scotland should be capable of being elected\r\none of the representative peers, or of voting at such election,\r\nand that no person should be capable of being elected a member of\r\nparliament for any shire or burgh, who should within the compass of\r\nany future year be twice present at divine service in an illegal\r\nepiscopal meeting-house in Scotland. Several other severe Acts were\r\npassed against Episcopalians, and these were not allowed to remain\r\na dead letter, but were acted upon in several instances.[1379] The\r\ndevoted Episcopalians bore their privations with becoming fortitude,\r\nby yielding to a necessity which they could not control, but they\r\nsubmitted only because they were unable to resist.\r\n\r\nStill there is no doubt that even at the present day there are not\r\na few hereditary adherents of the Scottish episcopal church, whose\r\nsympathies are all Jacobite, and who have never taken kindly even to\r\nthe present dynasty.\r\n\r\nAfter the death, in January 1788, of Prince Charles Edward, whose\r\nbrother the cardinal could leave no lawful descendant, the Scottish\r\nbishops felt they could conscientiously recognise the Hanoverian\r\ngovernment, and therefore issued an intimation to the clergy and\r\nlaity of their church, announcing that they had “unanimously agreed\r\nto comply with and submit to the present government of this kingdom,\r\nas vested in the person of his Majesty King George the Third.” They\r\nalso resolved “to testify this compliance by uniformly praying\r\nfor him by name in their public worship, in hopes of removing all\r\nsuspicion of disaffection, and of obtaining relief from those penal\r\nlaws under which this church has so long suffered.”[1380]\r\n\r\nThe forfeited estates were annexed to the Crown, and placed in the\r\nhands of the court of exchequer, who appointed commissioners to apply\r\ntheir produce to the improvement of the Highlands. In course of\r\ntime, as will be seen in the history of the clans, government wisely\r\nrestored to most of the unfortunate families the estates foolishly\r\nthrown away by their representatives in 1745.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all the measures above referred to was, of course,\r\nimmediately to annul all possibility of further active resistance,\r\nalthough, no doubt, they tended to intensify and perpetuate\r\nJacobitism as a sentiment, and change into a sort of living reverence\r\nor worship the feeling of loyalty towards Prince Charles which had\r\nanimated most of the Highland chiefs and incited them to rebellion.\r\nThe idea of endeavouring to repeat the experiment of ’45 seems not\r\nto have been entirely abandoned by some of the more obstinate\r\nJacobites even up to the time of Charles’s death, although after the\r\naccession of George III.,--in whose reign the stringent measures\r\nadopted after 1745 were gradually relaxed, and efforts made for the\r\nimprovement of the Highlanders,--the embodiment of many Highland\r\nregiments, the gradual dissolution practically of the old relation\r\nbetween the chief and his clan consequent on the abolition of the\r\nheritable jurisdictions, and the general progress of the country,\r\nJacobitism became, as we have said above, a matter of mere sentiment,\r\na feeling of tenderness almost akin to love, often finding expression\r\nin song in the melting language of the tender passion. Prince\r\nCharles was known to most of the Jacobites both in the Highlands and\r\nelsewhere only from the brief episode of 1745-6, in which he played\r\nthe chief part, and in which he appeared to them as the handsome,\r\nbrave, chivalrous, youthful, fair-haired, warm-hearted heir, come to\r\nrecover that inheritance from which he was most unjustly excluded by\r\na cruel usurper. His latter degraded life most of them knew nothing\r\nof, and even if they had been told of it, they most probably would\r\nhave regarded the tale as a vile calumny; their love for “Bonnie\r\nPrince Charlie” was blind as the love of an impetuous youth for his\r\nfirst mistress, and they would allow no flaw to mar the beauty of\r\nthat image which they tenderly cherished in their heart of hearts.\r\nThis sentimental Jacobitism, as we have said already, prevailed\r\nextensively among all classes of society for very many years after\r\nall idea of actively asserting it had died out of the land.[1381]\r\nThese Jacobites, who were generally of a somewhat social turn, in\r\ntheir private meetings, gave expression to their feelings in various\r\nways, known only to themselves; indeed, there appears to have been\r\na sort of freemasonry tacitly established among them, having signs,\r\nand words, and customs unknown to the great outside Whig world. One\r\nof their favourite methods, for example, of toasting Prince Charles\r\nat their feasts, was to drink to the health of “the king,” at the\r\nsame time passing the glass in their hands over the water-bottle, to\r\nsignify that they meant not King George, but him “over the water.”\r\n\r\nWhat more than anything else, perhaps, tended to nourish and keep\r\nthis feeling alive was the great body of song which was born of\r\nJacobitism, and which dates from the time of Charles I. down almost\r\nto the present day. These songs are of all kinds, tender, humorous,\r\npathetic, sarcastic, indignant, heroic, and many of them cannot be\r\nmatched as expressions of the particular feelings to which they\r\nare meant to give utterance. The strength and character of the\r\nJacobitic feeling can be well ascertained by a study of these songs,\r\nof which we believe there are some hundreds, many of them of high\r\nmerit, and some, as we have said, not to be matched by the songs of\r\nany country. Indeed, altogether, this outburst of song is one of\r\nthe most remarkable phenomena connected with Scottish Jacobitism,\r\nfor most of them are Scotch both in language and authorship, and\r\nmost of the tunes borrowed or adapted from the Gaelic, which has\r\nfurnished to Scotland some of its richest song music. These songs\r\nnot only show the intensity of the loyalty of the Jacobites towards\r\nthe Stuart family, and their hatred of the reigning dynasty and of\r\nall Whigs, but also show that all along they had felt themselves to\r\nbe the weaker party, unable to show their loyalty by their deeds,\r\nand compelled to let their energy escape in taunt and sarcasm. The\r\nWhigs have, indeed, a few, very few songs, which are artificial\r\nand cold, altogether devoid of the fire, the point, the perfect\r\n_abandon_, the touching tenderness, the thorough naturalness, which\r\ncharacterise those of their opponents. No one ever thinks of singing\r\nthose Whig songs now-a-days; few know aught of them save industrious\r\ncollectors.[1382] The Jacobite songs, on the other hand, both those\r\nwhich were written when Jacobitism was at its height, and those which\r\nare merely the outcome of modern sentiment, are, wherever Scotch\r\nsongs are sought after and appreciated, scarcely less popular than\r\nthe matchless love-songs in which the language must ever live. Who,\r\nwhen he hears some of these Jacobite gems sung, Protestant and Whig\r\nthough he be to the core, is not for the nonce a Jacobite, ready\r\nto draw his sword if he had one, to “Wha wadna fight for Charlie;”\r\nfeel delighted at the defeat of the Whig gudeman in “Hame cam’ our\r\ngudeman at e’en;” or shed a tear to the mournful verse of “Wae’s\r\nme for Prince Charlie?” With such a powerful instrument in their\r\nhands as this body of song, not only evidencing the intensity of the\r\nsentiment, but so well calculated to touch the feelings, excite the\r\ntenderness, and rouse the indignation of all who were capable of\r\nbeing influenced by music, it seems surprising that Jacobitism, as\r\na principle of action, was not more prevalent even than it was, and\r\ndid not, inspired by these songs, accomplish greater things. But the\r\nvery fact that there were so many songs, may account for this lack of\r\nimportant deeds. The muses, Burns has said, are all Jacobites, and it\r\nwould seem at any rate that all the best song writers of the country\r\nhad enlisted on the unfortunate side; and it will be found, on the\r\nother hand, in scanning the account of the last rebellion, that those\r\nwho joined in it were little given to forethought or to weighing the\r\nconsequences of their actions, little able to regulate or lead any\r\ngreat enterprise, but influenced chiefly by imagination and impulse.\r\nThere were, indeed, one or two superior to all the others in calibre,\r\nforesight, and aptitude to command, but these had little chance of\r\nbeing attended to when their power was not absolute among so many\r\nharebrained, thoughtless adventurers. In 1745, had there been at the\r\nhead of the rebels one thoroughly able, experienced, iron-willed,\r\nthoughtful general, who had absolute command of the whole expedition,\r\nmatters might have turned out very differently, especially when in\r\nthese songs he had instruments far more powerful to incite than any\r\nthreats or promises of reward. It is far from us to say that the\r\nbravery of the Jacobites evaporated in a song: their whole history\r\nwould give such a statement the lie; but we think had there been\r\nless singing and song-making and more attention to stratagem and dry\r\nmilitary business and diplomacy generally, they would have been more\r\nlikely ultimately to have placed their idol on the throne. However,\r\nas General Stewart well remarks, “when it is considered how many\r\nfeel and how few reason,” the power of this popular poetry to stir\r\nup sympathy in behalf of the cause for which it was written will be\r\neasily understood.[1383]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of these songs are in the Scottish language, a\r\nfew of them being translations from the Gaelic, but most of them\r\noriginal; the authors of very few of them are known, a feature which\r\nthey have in common with many of the oldest and richest of our Scotch\r\nsongs. Any one who may wish to form an idea of their merit and\r\nmultitude will find the best of them collected in Hogg’s two volumes\r\nof _Jacobite Relics_.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest of these songs are perhaps better known than any\r\nothers in the language; many of them, however, are known only by\r\nname, and many of them known at all but to a very few. Among those\r\ngenerally known and now commonly adapted to non-Jacobite sentiments,\r\nwe may mention “My ain country,” the song of the home-sick exile,\r\n“Here’s a health to them that’s awa’,” “Over the seas and far\r\nawa’,” “Will he no come back again,” “Charlie is my darling,”--of\r\nwhich there are an ancient and a modern set, the latter by James\r\nHogg,--“Farewell to Glen Shalloch” (from the Gaelic), “Hey Johnnie\r\nCope,” perhaps one of the most popular humorous songs in the\r\nlanguage, “The wee wee German lairdie,” full of genuine Scotch humour\r\nand irritating sarcasm, “This is no my ain house,” “O’er the water to\r\nCharlie,” “Welcome royal Charlie,” and “The bonnie house o’ Airly,”\r\nas old as the days of Montrose and Argyll. One of the most touchingly\r\npathetic and most popular of these old songs is the well-known “Will\r\nhe no come back again,” and equally popular is that, perhaps, most\r\nheroic and stirring of them all, “Wha wadna fecht for Charlie.”\r\n\r\nNot a few of the Jacobite songs, as we have said, are from the\r\nGaelic, and, as might be expected, they display little of the humour,\r\npawkiness, and rollicking sarcasm which characterise many of the\r\nScotch songs; they mostly evince a spirit of sadness and pensiveness,\r\nsome show a heroic determination to do or die in the cause of\r\nCharlie, while others are couched in the language of adoration and\r\nlove. One of the most characteristic and most poetical of these\r\nGaelic songs is _Maclean’s Welcome_, which we take the liberty of\r\nquoting here:--\r\n\r\n        “Come o’er the stream, Charlie, dear Charlie, brave Charlie,\r\n        Come o’er the stream, Charlie, and dine with Maclean;\r\n      And though you be weary, we’ll make your heart cheery,\r\n        And welcome our Charlie and his loyal train.\r\n      We’ll bring down the track deer, we’ll bring down the black steer,\r\n        The lamb from the breckan, and doe from the glen;\r\n      The salt sea we’ll harry, and bring to our Charlie,\r\n        The cream from the bothy, and curd from the pen.\r\n\r\n      Come e’er the stream, Charlie, &c.\r\n      And you shall drink freely the dews of Glen-Sheerly,\r\n        That stream in the star-light when kings do not ken;\r\n      And deep be your meed of the wine that is red,\r\n        To drink to your sire, and his friend the Maclean.\r\n\r\n      Come o’er the stream, Charlie, &c.\r\n      Our heath-bells shall trace you the maids to embrace you,\r\n        And deck your blue bonnet with flowers of the brae;\r\n      And the loveliest Mari in all Glen-M’Quarry\r\n        Shall lie in your bosom till break of the day.\r\n\r\n      Come o’er the stream, Charlie, &c.\r\n      If aught will invite you, or more will delight you,\r\n        ’Tis ready, a troop of our bold Highlandmen\r\n      Shall range on the heather with bonnet and feather,\r\n        Strong arms and broad claymores three hundred and ten.”\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and most admired of this class of Jacobite\r\nsongs is “The Lament of Flora Macdonald,” beginning, “Far over yon\r\nhills of the heather so green,” of which we here quote the last\r\nverse:--\r\n\r\n      “The target is torn from the arms of the just,\r\n        The helmet is cleft on the brow of the brave,\r\n      The claymore for ever in darkness must rust,\r\n        But red is the sword of the stranger and slave;\r\n      The hoof of the horse, and the foot of the proud\r\n        Have trod o’er the plumes on the bonnet of blue.\r\n      Why slept the red bolt in the breast of the cloud,\r\n        When tyranny revell’d in blood of the true?\r\n      Fareweel, my young hero, the gallant and good!\r\n        The crown of thy fathers is torn from thy brow.”\r\n\r\nSome of those whose titles are well enough known are “The White\r\nCockade,” of which we give a verse or two:--\r\n\r\n      “My love was born in Aberdeen,\r\n        The bonniest lad that e’er was seen;\r\n      But now he makes our hearts fu’ sad,\r\n        He’s ta’en the field wi’ his white cockade.\r\n              O he’s a ranting roving blade!\r\n              O he’s a brisk and a bonny lad!\r\n              Betide what may, my heart is glad\r\n              To see my lad wi’ his white cockade.\r\n\r\n      I’ll sell my rock, I’ll sell my reel,\r\n        My rippling-kame, and spinning-wheel,\r\n      To buy my lad a tartan plaid,\r\n        A braid sword, durk, and white cockade.\r\n              O he’s a ranting roving blade,” &c.[1384]\r\n\r\nAnother great favourite with the old Jacobites over their cups was,\r\n“The King shall enjoy his own again.”\r\n\r\nDid space permit we could quote many more, remarkable for pathos,\r\nhumour, wit, sarcasm, and heroic sentiment, but we must content\r\nourselves with the following. What can be more touching than\r\n“Carlisle Yetts”:--\r\n\r\n      “White was the rose in his gay bonnet,\r\n        As he faulded me in his broached plaidie;\r\n      His hand, whilk clasped the truth o’ luve,\r\n        O it was aye in battle readie!\r\n      His lang lang hair, in yellow hanks,\r\n        Wav’d o’er his cheeks sae sweet and ruddie;\r\n      But now they wave o’er Carlisle yetts,\r\n        In dripping ringlets clotting bloodie.\r\n\r\n      My father’s blood’s in that flower tap,\r\n        My brother’s in that harebell’s blossom;\r\n      This white rose was steeped in my luve’s blood,\r\n        And I’ll aye wear it in my bosom.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      When I came first by merrie Carlisle,\r\n        Was ne’er a town sae sweetly seeming;\r\n      The white rose flaunted owre the wall,\r\n        The thristled banners far were streaming.\r\n      When I came next by merrie Carlisle,\r\n        O sad sad seem’d the town, and eerie!\r\n      The auld auld men came out and wept:\r\n        ‘O maiden, come ye to seek your dearie?’\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      There’s ae drop o’ blood atween my breasts,\r\n        And twa in my links o’ hair sae yellow;\r\n      The tane I’ll ne’er wash, and the tither ne’er\r\n          kame,\r\n        But I’ll sit and pray aneath the willow.\r\n      Wae, wae, upon that cruel heart,\r\n        Wae, wae, upon that hand sae bloodie,\r\n      Which feasts on our richest Scottish blood,\r\n        And makes sae mony a dolefu’ widow!”\r\n\r\nHogg, however, is of opinion that this may be indebted for much of\r\nits beauty to the genius of Allan Cunningham.\r\n\r\nOf “Cumberland and Murray’s descent into Hell,” which appears to\r\nbe but little known, Hogg justly says, that “of all the songs that\r\never were written since the world began this is the first; it is\r\nboth so horrible and so irresistibly ludicrous.” It is a pity that\r\nthe author of a poem so full of fire, and hate, and lurid wit is\r\ntotally unknown; the heartiness of the hate displayed in it, as well\r\nas the wealth of unearthly fancy, ought to have recommended it to the\r\napproval of Dr. Johnson, had he known of it. Of course Cumberland is\r\nthe hero of Culloden; Murray is Secretary Murray, who turned king’s\r\nevidence against his comrades in the trials after the rebellion, and\r\nthus earned for himself the bitterest hate of all Jacobites.\r\n\r\n      “Ken ye whare Cleekie Murray’s gane?\r\n      He’s gane to dwall in his lang hame.\r\n      The beddle clapt him on the doup,\r\n      ‘O hard I’ve earned my gray groat.\r\n      Lie thou there, and sleep thou soun’;\r\n      God winna wauken sic a loon.’\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      He’s in a’ Satan’s frything-pans,\r\n      Scouth’ring the blude frae aff his han’s:\r\n      He’s washing them in brunstane lowe;\r\n      His kintra’s blude it winna thow:\r\n      The hettest soap-suds o’ perdition\r\n      Canna out thae stains be washing.\r\n\r\n      Ae devil roar’d, till hearse and roopit,\r\n      ‘He’s pyking the gowd frae Satan’s pu’pit!’\r\n      Anither roar’d, wi’ eldritch yell,\r\n      ‘He’s howking the keystane out o’ hell,\r\n      To damn us mair wi’ God’s day-light!’\r\n      And he doukit i’ the caudrons out o’ sight.\r\n\r\n      He stole auld Satan’s brunstane leister,\r\n      Till his waukit loofs were in a blister;\r\n      He stole his Whig spunks, tipt wi’ brunstane,\r\n      And stole his scalping-whittle’s whunstane;\r\n      And out o’ its red-hot kist he stole\r\n      The very charter-rights o’ hell.\r\n\r\n      Satan, tent weel the pilfering villain;\r\n      He’ll scrimp your revenue by stealing,\r\n      Th’ infernal boots in which you stand in,\r\n      With which your worship tramps the damn’d in,\r\n      He’ll wile them aff your cloven cloots,\r\n      And wade through hell fire in your boots.\r\n\r\n      Auld Satan cleekit him by the spaul,\r\n      And stappit him i’ the dub o’ hell.\r\n      The foulest fiend there doughtna bide him,\r\n      The damn’d they wadna fry beside him,\r\n      Till the bluidy duke came trysting hither,\r\n      And the ae fat butcher tried the tither.\r\n\r\n      Ae deevil sat splitting brumstane matches;\r\n      Ane roasting the Whigs like bakers’ batches;\r\n      Ane wi’ fat a Whig was basting,\r\n      Spent wi’ frequent prayer and fasting.\r\n      A’ ceas’d when thae twin butchers roar’d,\r\n      And hell’s grim hangman stopt and glowr’d.\r\n\r\n      ‘Fy, gar bake a pie in haste,\r\n      Knead it of infernal paste,’\r\n      Quo’ Satan; and in his mitten’d hand\r\n      He hynt up bluidy Cumberland,\r\n      And whittled him down like bow-kail castock,\r\n      And in his hettest furnace roasted.\r\n\r\n      Now hell’s black tableclaith was spread,\r\n      Th’ infernal grace was reverend said;\r\n      Yap stood the hungry fiends a’ owre it,\r\n      Their grim jaws gaping to devour it,\r\n      When Satan cried out, fit to scunner,\r\n      ‘Owre rank a judgment’s sic a dinner!’”\r\n\r\nNot a few of these old Jacobite songs, with little or no alteration\r\nin the words, are sung at the present day as pure love-songs, few\r\never dreaming that they were meant for anything else when first\r\ncomposed: nothing more than this shows the intensity and tenderness\r\nof the feeling entertained by the Scotch Jacobites to their hero and\r\nidol, Bonnie Prince Charlie. The well-known and apparently perfectly\r\nharmless song, “Weel may the keel row,” belongs to this class; and\r\nwho would ever smell treason in the touching strain “For the sake o’\r\nsomebody.”\r\n\r\nOne of the sweetest and tenderest of all the Jacobite songs is\r\nundoubtedly “Wae’s me for Prince Charlie,” beginning “A wee’ bird\r\ncam’ to our ha’ door,” and well known to all who have the least\r\nknowledge of Scottish song. Yet this song was written only about\r\nthirty or forty years ago by Mr. William Glen, a Glasgow merchant;\r\nand it is well known that many of the finest of Aytoun’s _Lays_ are\r\nanimated by this spirit of Jacobitism, showing how much calculated\r\nto touch the feelings and rouse the imagination of any one of an\r\nimpulsive, poetic temperament, is the story of “Bonnie Prince\r\nCharlie,” as it is popularly told in song and story.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be only fair, as a set off to the above, to give one\r\nor two of the best Whig songs:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHAUD AWA FRAE ME, DONALD.\r\n\r\n      “Haud awa, bide awa,\r\n        Haud awa frae me, Donald,\r\n      Your principles I do abhor;\r\n        No Jacobites for me, Donald.\r\n      Passive obedience I do hate,\r\n        And tyranny I flee, Donald;\r\n      Nor can I think to be a slave,\r\n        When now I can be free, Donald.\r\n\r\n      Even Highland Maggie, though she’s bred\r\n        Up under tyranny, Donald,\r\n      No sooner you her rights invade,\r\n        Than she’ll a rebel be, Donald.\r\n      For all that you can say or do,\r\n        I’ll never change my mind, Donald;\r\n      Your king takes so much of your heart,\r\n        To me you’ll ne’er be kind, Donald.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITANY.\r\n\r\n      “From the lawless dominion of mitre and crown,\r\n      Whose tyrannies now are absolute grown,\r\n      So that men become slaves to the altar and throne,\r\n      And can call neither bodies nor souls their own,\r\n                  _Libera nos, Domine_.\r\n\r\n      From a reverend bawling theological professor,\r\n      From a Protestant zealous for a Popish successor,\r\n      Who for a great benefice still leaves a lesser,\r\n      And ne’er will die martyr, nor make good confessor,\r\n                  _Libera nos, Domine_.\r\n\r\n      From deans and from chapters who live at their eases,\r\n      Whose lechery lies in renewing church-leases,\r\n      Who live in cathedrals like maggots in cheeses,\r\n      And lie like abbey-lubbers stew’d in their own greases,\r\n                  _Libera nos, Domine_.\r\n\r\n      From an altar-piece-monger who rails at Dissenters\r\n      And damns Nonconformists in the pulpit he enters,\r\n      Yet all the week long his own soul he ventures,\r\n      By being so drunk that he cutteth indentures,\r\n                  _Libera nos, Domine_.\r\n\r\n      From fools, knaves, and villains, prerogative Tories,\r\n      From church, that for the Babylon whore is,\r\n      From a pretended prince, like pear rotten at core is,\r\n      From a court that has millions, yet as old Job poor is,\r\n                  _Libera nos, Domine_.”\r\n\r\nThat the Jacobite songs tended largely to nourish and perpetuate\r\nJacobite sympathies long after all idea of endeavouring to restore\r\nthe Stuart dynasty had been abandoned, all must admit who know\r\nanything of Scotch social life during the latter part of the 18th\r\nand beginning of the 19th centuries. In the early part of the\r\nlatter century, an additional and most powerful instrument in the\r\ncause of sentimental Jacobitism came into play, in the shape of the\r\npoems, and especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott, on whose bold\r\nimagination and strong sympathy with chivalry and the days of old,\r\nthe story of the young prince and the misfortunes of the Stuarts and\r\ntheir adherents generally, appear to have taken a strong hold. The\r\nvery first of the Waverley Novels presented the history of the ’45\r\nin its most fascinating aspect, and painted its hero in the most\r\nattractive colours, as the handsome, chivalrous, high-minded, but\r\nunfortunate prince. In one or two of Scott’s other novels the same\r\nepisode is made use of, and with such bewitching power as only the\r\nWizard of the North could exercise. The influence of these matchless\r\nfictions continues unabated, and as it is from them that most people\r\nderive their knowledge of the last rebellion, and of the Stuarts\r\nand their cause, it is no wonder that even at the present day there\r\nexists a wide-spread, tender sympathy for the unfortunate race, a\r\nsort of sentimental Charlie-worship, adoring as its object the ideal\r\npresented by Scott, filled in with some of the most attractive and\r\ntouching features from the sweetest and most popular of the songs.\r\nWith perhaps no exception, this admiration of Prince Charlie and\r\nthe other heroes of ’45 is of the same nature as the unthinking\r\nadmiration of the “good old days” generally, of King Arthur and\r\nhis knights, of the days of chivalry, of Robin Hood and his merry\r\nmen, and of the bold Rob Roy; he would be looked upon as a harmless\r\nimbecile, who should ever talk of doing aught to restore any of the\r\ninstitutions of these old times, which are as likely to find active\r\npartisans as is the restoration of the Stuart dynasty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALMORAL.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHLAND RESIDENCE OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA.]\r\n\r\nHowever, that Jacobitism still runs in a few old families as\r\nsomething more than a sentiment, as something like an ideal\r\npolitico-religious creed, cherished as the remnant of the Cameronians\r\ncherish the ancient covenant, we have good reason to believe. These\r\nfamilies are, practically, perfectly loyal to the present government\r\nand the present sovereign, and would as soon dream of taking to\r\ncattle-lifting as to rebellion; but still they seem to regard the\r\nStuart dynasty as their first love, the love of their impulsive\r\nyouth, with whom a closer relation was impossible. The creed of\r\nthese modern Jacobites we may be permitted to state, in the words\r\nof one who has ample opportunities of mixing with them and knowing\r\ntheir sentiments. “As a principle of action,” he writes, quoting\r\nthe words of a noble lord, “it is dead and gone, but in sentiment\r\nand sympathy there are still lots of us.” He himself proceeds:--“I\r\nquite agree with him. We claim, with the late Professor Aytoun, to\r\nbe _White-Rose Scots_, Tories in some things but not in others--some\r\nof us Tories--some I daresay Radicals--none of us _Whigs_; all of\r\nus animated by an abhorrence of Macaulay’s History as an audacious\r\nlibel on our forefathers and their principles.” In another letter\r\nhe says:--“The question you ask, as to whether we would now stand\r\nup for any of the descendants of Prince Charles, is one I have no\r\ndifficulty in answering. We should not. I cannot say we have any\r\ngreat love for the present royal family; they cross our feelings and\r\nprejudices in many ways, by marriages in Lent, and alliances with\r\nCampbells!! But were the time of trial to come (and a contest between\r\nmonarchy and republicanism may come in this country sooner than many\r\nexpect), Queen Victoria would find none more loyal--I could almost\r\nventure to say, none _so loyal_--as those whose sympathies go with\r\nthe former enemies of her race. To us she represents ‘the powers that\r\nbe, as ordained of God,’ and we must bear a good deal at their hands.\r\nQueen Victoria herself certainly does appreciate the Highlands and\r\nHighlanders. Our loyalty is a matter of principle, not of preference,\r\nand might be found to wax the warmer, as that of others--when\r\nsubjected to a strain by the royal family running counter to\r\ntheir ideas and prejudices--waxed cold.” Indeed Jacobitism, as an\r\nactive principle, is as much a thing of the past as clan-feuds,\r\ncattle-lifting, and active religious intolerance.\r\n\r\nHer present Majesty has done more to win the hearts and command the\r\nloyalty of the Highlanders than ever did any of her predecessors, by\r\ntaking up her residence yearly in their midst, and in many other ways\r\nshowing her trust in and love for them, and her unbounded admiration\r\nfor all that is Highland. As is well known, before her widowhood,\r\nher favourite plaid was one of Stuart tartan of a special pattern.\r\nIf any section of her Majesty’s subjects is at all inclined to use\r\noccasionally expressions savouring of disloyalty, it is that of which\r\none or two Cockney newspapers are the mouthpieces, the grievance\r\nbeing that the Queen spends so much of her time in the Highlands. The\r\nloyalty and love of the Highlanders, and of all Scotchmen, have been\r\nfor ever intensified by the recent marriage of one of the Queen’s\r\ndaughters to the son and heir of one of the oldest and greatest\r\nHighland chiefs.[1385]\r\n\r\nSo far as the record of external strife or inward feud constitutes\r\nhistory, that of the Highlands may be said to end with the battle of\r\nCulloden in 1746. By many, however, the period from that date onwards\r\nwill be considered as of far more interest and importance than all\r\nthe previous centuries put together; for in the years succeeding the\r\nlast rebellion are witnessed the struggle of lawlessness with law, of\r\nsemi-barbarism with civilization, the gradual but rapid breaking-up\r\nof the old patriarcho-feudal way of ruling men and regulating\r\nproperty, on which the whole social life of the Highlands was based,\r\nand the assimilation of that district in all respects to the rest of\r\nthe kingdom of which it forms a part.\r\n\r\nThat innovations such as were of necessity forced upon the Highlands\r\nshould be adopted without a struggle, without resistance, without\r\nhardship to many, was not to be expected. No thoughtful person could\r\nexpect that there could be accomplished without many difficulties and\r\nmistakes the abolition of a system which had maintained its sway for\r\nmany centuries, and the introduction of a new one so little adapted\r\nto the character stamped on the Highlander under the former, and\r\nin every respect so contrary to the ideas and prejudices which had\r\nbeen transmitted from father to son for many generations. Any sudden\r\nchange of an old-established system, by which the every-day life of\r\nthousands of people is regulated, would in any case almost inevitably\r\nlead at first to disorder and a certain amount of hardship. It was\r\nto be looked for that, in the case of the Highlands, which in many\r\nrespects were centuries behind the rest of the country, there would\r\nbe much trouble and confusion before they could be brought up to\r\nthe stand-point of their Lowland fellow-countrymen. Such was the\r\ncase. It took very many years--indeed, the process is still going\r\non--before the various elements got settled into their places\r\naccording to the new adjustment of matters. There were, of course,\r\nmany interests to be attended to, and necessarily many collisions\r\nand misunderstandings between the various classes; often no doubt\r\nunnecessary hardness, selfishness, and want of consideration for\r\ninferiors on one side, as frequently met on the other by unreasonable\r\ndemands, and a stubborn and uninformed determination to resist the\r\ncurrent of change, and not to accommodate themselves to inevitable\r\ninnovations. The old clan-system, with the idea which it nourished\r\nof the close relation between the various grades of the clan, of the\r\nduty of the chief to support his people, and of the people to do\r\nthe will of the chief, must be abolished, and the Highlander must\r\nbe taught, each man to depend entirely upon himself and his own\r\nexertions, and to expect nothing from any man but what he could pay\r\nfor in labour or money. Of course it would be hard for a Celt to put\r\nhimself on the same footing in this respect with the low-minded,\r\ngreedy, over-reaching Saxon; but it had to be done, and, like many\r\nother things which seemed hard to face, has been done, and the\r\nprocess is still going on, and probably will go on, till there be not\r\nonly an assimilation in habits and ways of living and thinking, but\r\ntill the two races be so fused or blended together by intermarriage\r\nand otherwise, that there shall be neither Celt nor Saxon, but a\r\nmixed race superior to either, combining the best qualities of each,\r\nthe fire, the imagination, the dash, the reverence, the heart of the\r\nCelt, with the perseverance, clear-headedness, patience, fairness,\r\ncapacity for business, head of the Saxon. Ere long, no doubt, the\r\ntwo will become one flesh, and their separation and strife a tale of\r\nbygone days.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1368] Johnson’s _Journey_, ed. 1792, p. 126.\r\n\r\n[1369] _Stewart’s Sketches_, b. l. p. 116.\r\n\r\n[1370] _Culloden Papers_, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[1371] The difference between the fealdag and the philibeg is, that\r\nthe former is not plaited.\r\n\r\n[1372] Burton’s _Scotland after Revolution_, v. ii. p. 405.\r\n\r\n[1373] To give the reader a notion of the evils which flowed\r\nfrom these irregular jurisdictions, we quote the following from\r\nthe old Statistical Account of the Parish of Abernethy, in\r\nInverness-shire:--“A few instances will be enough to mention, in\r\ncase the reader should imagine that these things were lately done in\r\nTippoo Sultan’s dominions. One of them lived in this parish, named\r\nRobert Grant, commonly called Bailie More. It is said he used to hang\r\npeople for disobliging him. He seldom called juries. He hanged two\r\nbrothers on a tree within a thousand yards of this town, and buried\r\nboth in one grave, on the road side. The grave and stones above\r\nit are still visible. Another, named James Grant, commonly called\r\nBailie Roy, who lived long in this parish, hanged a man of the name\r\nof Stuart, and after hanging him, set a jury on him, and found him\r\nguilty. The particulars are too long to be inserted here. The bailie\r\nhad many reasons for being in such a hurry. The man was, unluckily\r\nfor him, wealthy, and abounded in cattle, horses, sheep, and goats,\r\nall of which were instantly driven to the bailie’s home; Stuart’s\r\nchildren set a-begging, and his wife became deranged in her mind, and\r\nwas afterward drowned in a river. It is not very long since. This\r\nsame Bailie Roy, on another occasion, hanged two notorious thieves,\r\nparboiled their heads, and set them up on spikes afterward. At\r\nanother time he drowned two men in sacks, at the bridge of Billimon,\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of this manse, and endeavoured to compel a\r\nman from Glenmore, in the barony of Kincardine, to assist him and the\r\nexecutioners he had with him in the business, which the man refusing\r\nto do, the bailie said to him, ‘If you was within my regality, I\r\nwould teach you better manners than to disobey my commands.’ This\r\nbailie bought a good estate. There was another of them, called\r\nBailie Bain, in this country, who became so odious that the country\r\npeople drowned him in Spey, near the church of Inverallan, about two\r\nmiles from hence. They took off his boots and gloves, left them on\r\nthe bank, and drove his horse through a rugged place full of large\r\nstones. The tract in the sand, boots, &c., discovered what had become\r\nof him; and when a search was made for him down the river, a man met\r\nthe party near the church of Cromdale, who asked them what they were\r\nsearching for, they answered, for the bailie’s body, upon which he\r\nsaid, ‘Turn back, turn back, perhaps he is gone up against the river,\r\nfor he was always acting against nature.’”\r\n\r\n[1374] Burton’s _Scotland after Revolution_, vol. ii. p. 535.\r\n\r\n[1375] “As their power was great, and generally abused, so many\r\nof them enriched themselves. They had many ways of making money\r\nfor themselves, such as 1. The Bailie’s Darak, as it was called,\r\nor a day’s labour in the year from every tenant on the estate.\r\n2. Confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and\r\neffects of such as suffered capitally. 3. All fines for killing\r\ngame, black-fish, or cutting green wood, were laid on by themselves,\r\nand went into their own pockets. These fines amounted to what they\r\npleased almost. 4. Another very lucrative perquisite they had was\r\nwhat was called the Herial Horse, which was, the best horse, cow, ox,\r\nor other article, which any tenant on the estate possessed at the\r\ntime of his death. This was taken from the widow and children for the\r\nbailie at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted\r\nto a great deal on a large estate.”--_Old Statistical Account of\r\nScotland_, vol. xiii. pp. 151-152.\r\n\r\n[1376] P. 243.\r\n\r\n[1377] See Fraser-Mackintosh’s _Antiquarian Notes_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[1378] Burton’s _Scotland after Revolution_, vol. ii. p. 537.\r\n\r\n[1379] Among others, the Rev. John Skinner, well known as the author\r\nof the song of “Tullochgorum,” was a sufferer: he was imprisoned for\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\n[1380] Dunbar’s _Social Life in Former Days_, 1st series, p. 390.\r\n\r\n[1381] When the Princess of Wales, mother of George III., mentioned,\r\nwith some appearance of censure, the conduct of Lady Margaret\r\nM’Donald, who harboured and concealed Prince Charles, when in the\r\nextremity of peril, he threw himself on her protection; “And would\r\nnot you, madam,” answered Prince Frederick, “have done the same, in\r\nthe same circumstances? I am sure--I hope in God you would.” Captain\r\nStuart of Invernahoyle’s singular remark was not, it seems, quite\r\nwithout foundation. A gentleman, in a large company, gibed him for\r\nholding the king’s commission, while, at the same time, he was a\r\nprofessed Jacobite. “So I well may,” answered he, “in imitation of\r\nmy master: the king himself is a Jacobite.” The gentleman shook his\r\nhead, and remarked, that the thing was impossible. “By G--,” said\r\nStuart, “but I tell you he is, and every son that he has. There is\r\nnot one of them who (if he had lived in my brave father’s days) would\r\nnot to a certainty have been hanged.”--Hogg’s _Jacobite Relics_.\r\n\r\n[1382] “We find that the whole of national song during that period\r\ninclined towards the ancient dynasty, and the whole force of the\r\nludicrous, the popular, and the pathetic, volunteered in the Jacobite\r\nservice. It is beyond question that the merit of these Jacobite\r\nsongs eclipsed, and still eclipses, every attempt at poetry on the\r\nother side, which has produced little beyond a few scraps of verses\r\nin ridicule of the bare knees, the kilts, and bad English of the\r\nHighlanders.”--Stewart’s _Sketches_, vol. i. p. 100.\r\n\r\n[1383] “These songs are a species of composition entirely by\r\nthemselves. They have no affinity with our ancient ballads of heroism\r\nand romance, and one part of them far less with the mellow strains of\r\nour pastoral and lyric muses. Their general character is that of a\r\nrude energetic humour, that bids defiance to all opposition in arms,\r\nsentiments, or rules of song-writing. They are the unmasked effusions\r\nof a bold and primitive race, who hated and despised the overturning\r\ninnovations that prevailed in church and state, and held the abettors\r\nof these as dogs, or something worse--drudges in the lowest and\r\nfoulest paths of perdition--beings too base to be spoken of with\r\nany degree of patience or forbearance. Such is their prevailing\r\nfeature; but there are amongst them specimens of sly and beautiful\r\nallegory. These last seem to have been sung openly and avowedly in\r\nmixed parties, as some of them are more generally known, while the\r\nothers had been confined to the select social meetings of confirmed\r\nJacobites, or hoarded up in the cabinets of old Catholic families,\r\nwhere to this day they have been preserved as their most precious\r\nlore.”--Hogg’s _Jacobite Relics_.\r\n\r\n[1384] The gentleman referred to in a former note appends the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n“There is also an Irish version of the ‘White Cockade.’ It has been\r\ntranslated from the Irish by J. J. Callanan. The following is the\r\nlast verse:--\r\n\r\n      ‘No more the cuckoo hails the spring,\r\n      The woods no more with the stanch-hounds ring;\r\n      The song from the glen, so sweet before,\r\n      Is hushed since Charlie left our shore.\r\n      The prince is gone, but he soon will come,\r\n      With trumpet sound, and with beat of drum:\r\n      Then up with shout, and out with blade--\r\n      We’ll stand or fall with the white cockade.’\r\n\r\nLover, commenting on this song in his _Lyrics of Ireland_, tells\r\nthe following anecdote in connection with Ireland, and its devotion\r\nto the White Rose:--“The celebrated Lord Chesterfield, who governed\r\nIreland with rare ability and liberality in 1744, when told by an\r\nalarmist that ‘the Papists were dangerous,’ replied that he had never\r\nseen but one dangerous Papist, and that was Miss ----, a particularly\r\nlovely woman. This lady, sharing in the gratitude and admiration of\r\nthe Roman Catholics, wished to show the Earl how thoroughly she could\r\novercome political prejudices, and on a public occasion at Dublin\r\nCastle wore a breast knot of Orange ribbon. The earl, pleased at the\r\nincident, requested Lord Doneraile, celebrated for his wit, to say\r\nsomething handsome to her on the occasion. The request occasioned the\r\nfollowing _impromptu_:--\r\n\r\n      ‘Say, little Tory, why this jest\r\n      Of wearing Orange on thy breast,\r\n      Since the same breast, uncover’d, shows\r\n      The whiteness of the rebel rose.’”\r\n\r\n[1385] In connection with the above subject, our Jacobite\r\ncorrespondent has communicated to us the following anecdote. He\r\ndoes not vouch for its truth, but he states that he had it on very\r\ngood authority. On one occasion, when her Majesty’s guests had been\r\nenjoying themselves, in scattered groups, in the pleasure-grounds\r\naround Balmoral, the conversation chanced to turn, amongst one of\r\nthose groups, on Jacobite songs and Jacobite music. One of the\r\nladies, known for her knowledge of Jacobite melodies, and for her\r\nskill in the execution of them, was asked to favour her companions\r\nwith a specimen. The party having retired to a distance from the\r\nrest of the company, the lady sung her song. The echoes of the music\r\nreached, it is said, the quick ears of the Queen, who went at once to\r\nthe spot whence it proceeded. And no one, it is added, enjoyed the\r\nmelody more. One of the company having ventured to express surprise\r\nthat the Queen could so enter into the spirit of a song which seemed\r\nto reflect so much on the present dynasty, her Majesty is said to\r\nhave stated, as the representative of the family of Bonnie Prince\r\nCharlie, no one could be a greater Jacobite than herself; and that\r\nshe considered all the songs in praise of “the Auld Stuarts” as songs\r\nin praise of her own ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
