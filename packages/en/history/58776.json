                      451\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of Count Bismarck has been so much misinterpreted, by interested\r\nand disinterested persons, that it is thought the present publication,\r\nwhich tells “a plain unvarnished tale,” will not be unwelcome. In these\r\ndays of universal criticism, no person is exempt from the carping mood\r\nof the envious, or the facile unreasoning of the ready-made theorist.\r\nShould we feel disposed to credit vulgar report, noble motives and heroic\r\nlives are no longer extant in our present state of society. The eyes of\r\ndetractors are everywhere curiously—too curiously—fixed upon the deeds\r\nof men of mark, and mingled feelings pull down from the pedestal of fame\r\nevery man who has ascended to the eminence awarded to the patriot and\r\nstatesman. Truly, such a condition of things bodes no good to the common\r\nweal of society, either in England, Prussia, or in any part of Europe.\r\nThe present writer can see no utility in this practice of soiling the\r\nreputations and actions of men who, by slow degrees, have worked their\r\nway into positions of merit and mark.\r\n\r\nThe evil, however, does not wholly rest with the detractors. An\r\nerroneous theory about universal equality gives the spur to this spirit\r\nof criticism. A sort of feeling arises in the mind to the effect of,\r\n“Had I been in his place, I should have acted otherwise!”—the bystander\r\nproverbially seeing more of the game than the players. It is, however,\r\na great matter of doubt whether this is universally true. It might be\r\ntrue, if every circumstance, every motive, every actuation, could be laid\r\nbare to positive vision. In the conduct of life, however, this is rarely\r\npossible, even in the crudest way; especially is it so in the intricate\r\nand tortuous paths of politics. Politicians, we all know, are many;\r\nstatesmen, unfortunately for the well-being of the world, are few.\r\n\r\nSome few years since England lost a statesman named Henry Temple,\r\nViscount Palmerston. He had the rare happiness of being popular during\r\nhis life, although it is perhaps more certain of him than of any modern\r\nstatesman, that his inflexibility as to issues was remarkable. Apparently\r\nhe would bend, but he had, upon fixed principles, determined to rule,\r\nand his happy method of conciliation, in which he was clad as in a\r\ngarment, veiled from the eyes of friend or foe that wonderful spirit of\r\ndetermination permeating all the actions characterizing his political\r\ncareer. And when Palmerston died, a wild wail of sorrow arose from all\r\nEngland, a regret which will never be abated so long as England’s history\r\nremains intelligible.\r\n\r\nOf similar materials to Palmerston, Count Bismarck is composed.\r\nOtherwise put together, it is true, in accordance with the genius of\r\nthe nation amongst which his life-destiny has cast him; but as to the\r\ngeneric likeness there can be little doubt. The policy of Palmerston was\r\n“thorough;” so is that of Bismarck. But it is not the “thorough” of a\r\nStrafford; it is rather the enlightened “thorough” of a man cast into\r\nmodern society, and intensely patriotic. Though Bismarck has consistently\r\nupheld the prerogatives of his royal master, he has not been neglectful\r\nof the interests of the nation of which he is the Minister. A spirit of\r\ncandor breathes through all his actions, and displays him in the light\r\nof an emphatically honest man. Unlike the present remarkable occupant of\r\nthe French throne, he is not tided along by public events; nor, like that\r\npotentate, does he extract fame from an adroit bowing to the exigencies\r\nof the hour. The French sovereign has eliminated a policy, and gained a\r\nkind of respect from others, in consequence of a masterly manipulation\r\nof passing occurrences. The Prussian Premier, on the other hand, has\r\nobserved fixed principles. The latter has his political regrets—he can\r\nshed a tear over the grave of the meanest soldier who died at Sadowa. The\r\nformer looks upon human life much as chess-players look upon pawns—to be\r\nruthlessly sacrificed on occasion, should it happen that a skillful flank\r\nmovement may protect the ultimate design in view. Chess-players, however,\r\nknow that the pawns constitute the real strength of the game, and that\r\nit would be worse than folly to sacrifice the humble pieces. Political\r\nsagacity is ever displayed in judicious reserve, and this quality is\r\neminently evinced in all Bismarck’s activity. Perhaps the most singular\r\ntriumph of Bismarck’s life consists in the neutralization of Luxemburg—an\r\nepisode in his career of which he has greater reason to be proud than\r\nof the battle-field of Sadowa, or the indirect countenance afforded by\r\nhim to Italy. It can scarcely be doubted that so peaceful a victory is a\r\ngreater merit than the massing together of thousands of armed men, for\r\ntrying a right by ordeal of steel and gunpowder.\r\n\r\nAstute as Napoleon may be, Bismarck certainly was wiser than he. The\r\nformer has dynastic reasons for maintaining a pre-eminence in the face of\r\nEurope; but the latter, with comparatively inadequate means, had a far\r\nmore difficult problem to solve. For Bismarck has a heart large enough to\r\nentertain feelings of kindliness towards the whole of Germany, as well as\r\ntowards that section of it known as Prussia alone. There is a generous\r\naspiration in him for German nationality, overruling petty animosity\r\ntowards his enemies.\r\n\r\nIn all his contests he has ever been ready to hold out the hand of\r\nreconciliation, although, in no instance, has he deviated from the strict\r\nline of duty pointed out by his special nationality. Indeed, it was a\r\nparamount necessity to raise Prussia in the scale of nations, ere a\r\nGerman nationality could emerge into healthy political being. Prussia’s\r\nrise, therefore, comprehended within it the elements of German political\r\nexistence. Geographically, the consolidation of a great kingdom in the\r\nnorth was a necessity; and considering how well and prudently Prussia\r\nhas used its great position, no one can regret the result of the events\r\nof 1866. Prussia, as a Protestant country, as a land of education and\r\nintellectual refinement, has no equal on the face of the globe. But that\r\nsingle position depends on the race-character of the nation evinced in\r\nits utilitarian spirit. Bismarck will perpetuate his policy in time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“Great acts,” says the old dramatist, “thrive when reason guides the\r\nwill.” This application of reason, so continuously, consistently, and\r\nquietly exercised, predicates a great national future. That future\r\nis bound up with the fame of this great loyal statesman and dutiful\r\nsubject, who has had insight enough to see how far the prerogative\r\nof the crown of Prussia was consistent with the happiness of its\r\npeople, foresight enough to rationally contend for such prerogative,\r\nand faithful courage adequate to the fearless execution of a grand\r\ndesign, comprehending within itself elements of consolidation and\r\nenduring strength. What Germany owes to Bismarck can as yet be scarcely\r\ncalculated, but very few years need elapse ere the sum will become\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, necessary to descend from generalities into particulars;\r\nto discuss, as briefly as may be, some objections that have been urged,\r\nand to expose the fallacy of certain historical parallels, sought to\r\nbe drawn in reference to Bismarck’s position towards his king and his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe have not to contrast Bismarck with any hero or statesman of antiquity.\r\nSociety, although not human nature, has so changed, that what our\r\nmodern men do for the common weal changes with the circumstances and\r\nthe extension of the circle of population. One man could then address\r\na nation—now the nation must rely upon Camarillas. Democracy, in these\r\ndays, either vaguely advocates desperate political experiments, or, stung\r\nto madness by real or fancied wrongs, determines them—as hot-headed\r\nnon-thinkers usually determine—by violence.\r\n\r\nOur modern Cleons use the press, which, truth to be spoken, is not\r\nunwilling to be used; and hence any thing not to be twisted before the\r\nlaw-courts into libel, represents the license and not the freedom of the\r\npress. But the man of antiquity at least had to exercise the courage of\r\nmeeting his fellow-citizens, and thus either swayed them or was lost.\r\nAssent or dissent was given by acclamation. Bismarck presents rather a\r\ncontrast than a likeness to Greek or Roman statesmen—they sought the\r\nAgora or the Forum; he has no time for claptrap.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn to the political doctrine, partly known as that of divine\r\nright, for which Bismarck has been thought to fight.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of a divine right of possession to the Crown of Prussia\r\nis one not readily comprehensible to an English subject, under the\r\ncircumstances of the modern constitution of the United Kingdom, for the\r\nreason that modern society has accustomed itself to look upon the results\r\nof the revolutions of 1649 and 1688 as final, and settled by events, and\r\nthe contract entered into between the parliament, or representative\r\nbody, on the one hand, and the constitutional sovereign on the other. We\r\nmay recur to an earlier period, when the crown was devisable by will in\r\nEngland, or when at least the succession was settled in accordance with\r\nthe desires of a dying sovereign, for some kind of parallel. Although\r\nthis absolute right of leaving the crown by will has not often been\r\nexercised, it has found its defenders; for instance, in the case of Queen\r\nJane, a minority held that Edward was justified in devising his crown;\r\ntherefore, while the theory was not actually substantiated by the right\r\nof peaceable possession, it was not regarded as wholly illusory. If Henry\r\nVIII. might by his prerogative bar certain members of his family from the\r\nsuccession, the crown advisers of that day must have been justified in\r\nsupporting such a prerogative, and could not have regarded the sovereign\r\nas _ultra vires_ in the matter of a transmission of the crown. It is\r\ncertainly, from the logic of facts, an impossibility to effect any such\r\nchange in the order of succession now, and in itself would be as fatal\r\na step as any political theorists could attempt; and if so fatal in a\r\ncountry where feudalism is a mere historical eidolon, how far more unwise\r\nin a country such as Prussia, where feudalism has still a practical,\r\nthough not an avowed, existence? In the very nature of things, the\r\nsovereigns of Prussia hold their crown upon a principle of divine right,\r\nas proprietors of the fee-simple of the soil, which divine right has ever\r\nbeen construed to impose certain obligations towards their vassals, the\r\nholders of the usufruct, and their subjects, agents, and traders—which\r\nobligations, to their honor be it spoken, the sovereigns of Prussia have\r\never attempted to fulfill. This divine right differs in its nature and\r\nmode of action from the mere arbitrary will of a tyrant. There, as here—\r\n\r\n        “Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,\r\n    But Harry, Harry.”\r\n\r\nTheir divine right to the soil, which they swear to defend, and seek to\r\nimprove, for the benefit of all, differs essentially from the divine\r\nright as understood by a Charles Stuart. Fiscal arrangements are again of\r\na widely different character, and a vassal like Bismarck, who maintains\r\nthe prerogative of his sovereign liege, is merely carrying the legitimate\r\nconsequences of an enduring and progressive system, akin to, but not\r\nidentical with, ancient feudal theories, into action. It is clearly\r\nfalse to seek a parallel in Charles and Strafford; the parallel would\r\nbe more just if drawn between Henry and Wolsey. But parallels are ever\r\nsuspicious, as the course of historical sequence is not identical, and\r\npresents only delusive points of contact.\r\n\r\nAny adequate explanation must be sought in another direction, and that\r\ndirection is best pointed out by the very essential features of Prussian\r\nhistory itself. From this cause, a prominence, by no means undeserved,\r\nhas been assigned to the early history of the family whence Bismarck\r\nsprang. In the brief sketch given in the first book, it may be plainly\r\nseen that impulses of duty guided, and a kind of hierarchy of rank\r\nsustained, the active energy in the vassal on behalf of the sovereign,\r\nand that in fighting for the supremacy of the Prussian crown, Bismarck\r\nwas at the same moment upholding the real solidarity and ultimate rights\r\nof the subjects of that crown. Surely by maintaining the rights of the\r\nfather against all comers—those rights held by the father in trust—the\r\ninterests of the children are best consulted.\r\n\r\nFor there is a mesne power between absolutism and republicanism, tyranny\r\nand democracy; this is not constitutionalism. This is honor, higher than\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“The divinity that doth hedge a king,” from which a true king’s impulses\r\nflow, must be founded on a higher instinct, and derived from a higher\r\nplane. True kingship is very rare, often falls short of its standard in\r\nthe very best of men—for humanity has always its faults; but rightly\r\nguided, it is possible, nay, probable, that the office of kingship\r\nmay be justly and nobly exercised. A constitutional monarch, although\r\nirremovable, save by the process of revolution, can only be governed by\r\nthe impulses of the man himself, while an absolute sovereign may arrest,\r\ncorrect, and mitigate much that is evil in the State. In civil affairs,\r\nwe require such an ultimate personage, one whose honor and self-respect\r\nwill be a sufficient safeguard against abuses. Any king not evidencing\r\nthat honor in his private life as well as public acts, is liable,\r\nand justly so, to deposition; every king who faithfully performs the\r\ndifficult and delicate duties of his position, has a right to expect the\r\ntrue and loving submission of his subjects. The combination of an honest\r\nminister with a noble-minded king, however, is rare. In Frederick the\r\nSecond of Prussia, as to some extent in the first Napoleon, there was a\r\nwill to be honest; but where the latter failed in his task, the former\r\nprevailed in the hearts of his people, and the admiration of the world.\r\nHave we not the exquisite book of Mr. Carlyle as evidence of it? Real\r\nstatesmen know how infinitely difficult the problem of administration\r\nmust be, and hence it is that so many real wrongs are accidentally\r\ncommitted, when the right is sought through the agency of unscrupulous\r\nministers. The axiom that the king can do no wrong, simply means that\r\nif he inadvertently do a wrong, he is bound to repair it so soon as he\r\nis possessed of the truth of the wrong. On this fact—and no polity is\r\nbuilt up with safety without resting on facts—is based the right of\r\npetition, as well in oriental as in occidental countries. Now, here is\r\nthe political lever, nor is the stand-point far off. The king is bound\r\nto do justice, because his position, being founded on divine right,\r\nrelies upon divine protection. In any country where God, under whatever\r\nform, is honored, no king, conscious of his deep obligations for his\r\nposition, can hesitate to throw himself fearlessly into the midst of his\r\nsubjects, always regarding such monarch, as is the case in Prussia, as\r\nthe steward of the Unseen Governor of all. Legally and politically, the\r\nking represents the ultimate court of appeal, and honestly fulfilling the\r\nduties imposed upon him, no sovereign need fear, as in Prussia would be\r\nabsurd, the hand of the assassin. It is the everlasting curse entailed\r\nupon large States, that for petty motives there exists an alarming\r\nsystem of bureaucracy, in which the voices of the honest servants are\r\ndrowned in the din of the general throng for distinction, wealth,\r\nease, and enjoyment. Hence public servants, of whatever degree, fear\r\nto speak; hence the public fumes, hence stoppage of trade, discredit\r\nby capitalists, ultimate want of employment, lassitude of patriotism,\r\nconspiracy, crime—with its load of expense—famine, and the fall of States\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nNow, a practical king, conscious of his office, and ablebodied enough\r\nto undergo the exertion, can be the greatest of philanthropists, if\r\nsupported by an honest ministry, fearless enough to repress undue\r\nexpenditure, either by his sovereign or the lieges. Wary to draw the\r\nsword, eager to substitute the ploughshare, should such a monarch be;\r\nand such a monarch we find in Prussia, and have found before. Fearless\r\nand honorable should be his minister; and such a minister we find,\r\nfortunately not without parallels, in Count Bismarck.\r\n\r\nBismarck had not only this abstract duty, as some may like to call it,\r\nto perform towards his own sovereign. There was another duty of no less\r\nimportance and delicacy to fulfill as a German—as a member of the body\r\ncorporate of the Teutonic nation. Had Austria continued in its peculiar\r\nposition of pre-eminence, derived from an association of its rulers with\r\nthe extinct Holy Roman Empire, the real power of self-government would\r\nhave passed from the German nations to that mixture of Slavs and Czechs,\r\nHuns, Magyars, and Poles, making up so large a proportion of Austrian\r\nsubjects; and could Prussia, emphatically German in all its regions, have\r\npermitted a supremacy so at variance with—I will not say common sense—but\r\nethnical affinity? Is it not more in conformity with natural sympathy\r\nthat the German kindred races of the north should be consolidated in a\r\ntruly German national sense, than remain a loosely-constructed federation\r\nof petty princedoms, under the guidance of a power whose main strength\r\nlay in races alien, and even hostile, if we are to trust present events,\r\nin their interests, instincts, and sympathies?\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, underlying all this, the cardinal fact of a\r\ndifference of religious sympathies. So eminently Roman Catholic, ruling\r\nover nations outwardly, and perhaps sincerely, attached to the Papal\r\nforms of ecclesiastical government and doctrine, Austria could not\r\nhold out a faithful hand of fellowship to Protestant Prussia, with its\r\nstern Calvinistic self-assertion: so attached to all that is ancient in\r\nreference to birth, family tradition, and historical fame, Austria could\r\nnot but be jealous of a nation which had robbed it of its warlike glory,\r\nand set up a new nobility in opposition to its ancient semi-oriental\r\nprincely families: so wedded to all that was archaic and statuesque in\r\nform and stationary in its character, how was it possible to tolerate\r\na neighbor whose spirit is remarkable for its restless activity and\r\nlove of innovation; so practical in science and utilitarian in its\r\naims? A contest between two such powers, and in such a cause, and as a\r\nconsequence of such various processes of development, was inevitable,\r\nwhile the ultimation of the strife could scarcely be doubtful. The\r\nimperial nation, so proud, profuse, and old-fashioned, must receive a\r\nlesson, intended in the utmost spirit of candor, from the patient,\r\npractical, and untiring nation of North Germany, who looked upon its\r\nsovereign and institutions with kindly affection, as the outcome of the\r\nlabors of their immediate fathers, and to the fruits of which those\r\nsubjects were honestly entitled. Nor, as having resided in both Prussia\r\nand Austria, am I disposed to think that Prussian tendencies do not\r\nreceive hearty approval in the German sections of the Austrian people.\r\nLet the events accompanying the siege of Vienna, in 1848, be properly\r\nvalued, and the fact is patent. The cowardice of Ferdinand is the key to\r\nthe history of that siege, as well as its justification.\r\n\r\nWe have not here, however, so much to do with the policy of the Prussian\r\npeople, and their relations towards Austria, as with a consideration of\r\nthe effects wrought upon Bismarck’s mind by his position, education,\r\npersonal character, and the events of his era. We here rather want to get\r\nan intelligible picture of Bismarck himself—to learn why Bismarck is the\r\nactual Bismarck he is, and not another Bismarck, as it were, altogether.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore glance at his early life, and see how his strong,\r\ndaring, and somewhat headlong youth has gradually moulded him into the\r\nastute, unbending, and progressive statesman we now see him to be in the\r\nlatter days of his remarkable life.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us must be his opportunities of birth and of\r\nlineage. Education, it can not be doubted, is materially influenced by\r\nthese two considerations. An indulgent father and an ambitious mother may\r\nhelp a lad along. Next comes the necessary process of estrangement; that\r\nemergence into actual life from which so few come forth proudly; and,\r\nfinally, the attainment of self-consciousness, but without direction and\r\nwithout an aim. This usually results, as with Bismarck, in an appreciable\r\namount of obloquy, from which the strong spirit desires emancipation.\r\nIn the case now in point, his aspirations of the better sort had the\r\nmastery. Application to his distressed fortunes led him to think of\r\nothers, and while he tested other men he applied the same stern acid to\r\nhis own soul.\r\n\r\nThe empty affection of dissolutism assailed him, and he fled from it\r\nwith the disgust of a noble mind: he longed for a more exquisite grace\r\nof beauty and dignity, and attained it. From that time forward he could\r\napply; the serious element in his nature obtained the upper hand, and he\r\nperceived that life was not intended as a mere puppet scene. Patriotism,\r\none of the grandest impulses of human nature, led him to a recognition\r\nof his duties as a man, and comforted in his domestic relations, he\r\nstood for his king. He became the king’s man—to that fealty he vowed\r\nhimself, and that fealty he has nobly accomplished. He saw at once he\r\nwas the king’s man, but policy he had none. Policy, of whatever sort\r\nit might prove to be, was yet to come; but the historical guide-line\r\nof a relation between the highest post of dignity and his own rank,\r\nfashioned it into a policy into which perforce the idea of aristocracy\r\nnecessarily entered. Had Bismarck not been so vehemently attacked at the\r\nonset of his political and representative career, it is very probable\r\nthat the stout resistance he made would not have proved so strenuous.\r\nBut the attack was one which roused the dormant elements of his nature.\r\nVery proud, like most of the Pomeranian and Brandenburg Junkers, he\r\nresolved upon showing that his pride was not false, and was not so\r\ngreatly leavened with personal ambition as some tauntingly averred. But\r\nit must be confessed that there is a vast difference between his early\r\nspeeches and his later policy—in itself a proof that his career was not\r\nthat of a political adventurer, resolved for notoriety at any price. The\r\ncrudeness of his earlier speeches has formed an absolute boon to his\r\nopponents, who scarcely anticipated that a man who honestly cared for\r\nthe point at issue, rather than the airing of a more or less inflated\r\neloquence—seasoned with a philosophy of a very unpractical kind—was about\r\nto enter into the political arena. Looking at Bismarck in his earliest\r\nstages of development as a statesman, the present writer can not say\r\nthere was much beyond a general adhesion to the Prussian traditions to\r\nrecommend him. It is for this reason that certain documents have been\r\nreprinted in the latter pages of this book, not furnished by the German\r\ncompiler. In these documents, appealing as they do to his family pride\r\nas a liegeman, may be found the key of Bismarck’s subsequent violent\r\ndeclaration on the side of the monarchy. “That a king should voluntarily\r\npropose to set aside what, in my contract, inherent in my birth, with\r\nthat king, contravenes my family pride, makes me sorry for that king, but\r\nvehement against his advisers. But being sorry, I must fight for him, or\r\nhis successors.”\r\n\r\nPrussia was, like a nation or two more in Europe, in a “parlous state”\r\nin 1848. But these days of March were a natural result of facts pressing\r\non the people: they passed, however. In those events, misunderstood even\r\nat the present time—misunderstood as all revolutions must be—Bismarck\r\ntook no part save that of thinking that a replacement of the army by an\r\nununiformed corps was another insult to Prussia—and her lieges.\r\n\r\nHis political education had advanced to a point when it would either\r\nresolve itself into a total abnegation of political activity, or an\r\naspiration towards some ameliorations of the matter in hand. This\r\nsignified itself, not by individual actions after a time, but rather\r\nby the centralization of a party existing in fortuitous atoms into\r\nclubs—adding the printing-press as a powerful aid.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the ambassadorial post at Frankfurt was offered him.\r\nLight-hearted and willing—to all appearance—he accepted it. The world\r\nhas yet to be made acquainted with the positive result of this Frankfurt\r\nmission. That his instructions were accurate there can be little doubt,\r\nand that all his energies were bent upon the humiliation of Austria as\r\nthe powerful rival of Prussia, is equally true. That his diplomatic\r\nfacility had at this time acquired any great amount of strength is\r\ndoubtful. He was an excellent host, and a sincere adviser; but it is\r\ndue to him rather again to cast away any delusion as to the diplomatic\r\ngrandeur of his actions—unless, which may be the case, honesty pure and\r\nsimple is diplomacy.\r\n\r\nHe therefore remained a good friend, a good host, a kind master, a most\r\nloving husband and brother. Perhaps nothing in connection with the man\r\nwho has been thought so harsh, is so interesting as his care, his love,\r\nnot only for his own family, but for his humbler dependents. In his\r\ncorrespondence, which really forms the feature of this volume, we find\r\nthe careful and truthful expression of a mind seeking to set itself\r\nright with the world and its duties, and consistently adopting utter\r\nstraightforwardness as the efficient means to this end. In times of\r\ntrouble he sympathizes deeply with the bereaved; in seasons when most\r\naspersed he shows a firm reliance on the goodness of his cause, and his\r\ninnate sense of right; and he ever displays a confidence in the ultimate\r\nrealization of the object held in view.\r\n\r\nThe various letters written during seasons of holiday travel display a\r\nkeen delight in natural objects, and are written with a simple eloquence\r\ndenoting frankness and candor.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this Preface, already somewhat lengthy, it is perhaps not\r\nout of place to refer to a recent review of the two first German sections\r\nof this book, in the October number of the _Edinburgh Review_. The\r\nreviewer will perceive that the blemishes to which he alludes have been\r\nremoved, so far as may be, from the text. Any one, acquainted with German\r\nliterature, is aware that its genius admits of the expression of many\r\nsimple _naïvetés_, very far from consonant with the dignity and spirit of\r\nthe English language. For these reasons a rearrangement and compression\r\nof the earlier parts of the book has been effected, and notes have been\r\nadded of interest to the English reader, whose acquaintance with some\r\nof the personages named would necessarily be limited. Nothing, however,\r\ntending to illustrate the character and purposes of the chief personage,\r\nhas been omitted. So far as the materials could serve, a faithful picture\r\nof Count Bismarck is here presented, and it is anticipated that the\r\nPrussian premier will be seen to far greater advantage than through the\r\nmedium of the Edinburgh reviewer. That gentleman will perhaps forgive\r\nthe writer for differing from him in his general estimate of Bismarck’s\r\ncharacter. The estimate taken by the critic is very severe, and scarcely\r\njust. It is also so curious that the writer can not refrain from\r\ntranscribing it here, that the reader may have both sides of the picture\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n“To govern,” says the critic,[1] “is, according to his ideas, to command,\r\nand parliamentary government is to command with a flourish of speeches\r\nand debates, which should always end in a happy subserviency with the\r\nruling minister. This arbitrary disposition is, of course, strengthened\r\nby his success of 1866; but he will be grievously deceived in believing\r\nthat only stubborn resolution is wanted to triumph again. He is a man\r\nof the type of Richelieu and Pombal; but this style of statesmanship is\r\nrather out of place in our century, at least for obtaining a lasting\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“We can not, therefore, consider him as a really great statesman,\r\nthough he has certainly gifts of the highest order. He is a first rate\r\ndiplomatist and negotiator. No man can captivate more adroitly those\r\nhe wants to win; nobody knows better to strike at the right moment, or\r\nto wait when the tide is running in his favor. His personal courage is\r\ngreat, physically as well as morally; he shrinks from nothing conducive\r\nto his end. He is not naturally eloquent; but his speeches are generally\r\nimpressive, and full of terse argument. He is a capital companion in\r\nsociety—witty, genial, sparkling in his conversation. His private life\r\nis pure; nobody has accused him of having used his high position for his\r\npecuniary advantage. It is natural that such qualities, backed by an\r\nindomitable will, a strong belief in himself, and an originally robust\r\nconstitution, should achieve much. But by the side of these virtues the\r\ndarker shades are not wanting. We will not reproach him with ambition;\r\nit is natural that such a man should be ambitious. But his ambition\r\ngoes far to identify the interests of his country with his own personal\r\npower. Every thing is personal with him; _he never forgets a slight, and\r\npersecutes people who have offended him with the most unworthy malice_.\r\nHis strong will degenerates frequently into absurd obstinacy; he is\r\nfeared by his subordinates, but we never heard _that any body loved\r\nhim_. Driven into a strait, his courage becomes the reckless daring\r\nof the gambler, who stakes every thing on one card. _He can tell the\r\nvery reverse of the truth with an amazing coolness_; still oftener he\r\nwill tell the plain truth when he knows that he will not be believed.\r\nHe is a great comedian, performing admirably the part he chooses to\r\nplay. He knows how to flatter his interlocutors, by assuming an air of\r\ngenuine admiration for their talents; they leave him charmed by his\r\ncondescension, _whilst he laughs at the fools who took his fine words for\r\nsolid cash. His contempt of men is profound_; he dislikes independence,\r\nthough he probably respects it. _There is not a single man of character\r\nleft in the ministry or the more important places of the civil\r\nservice(!)._ Few things or persons exist at which he would not venture a\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n“At present he has chosen to retire, for an indefinite period, from a\r\nperplexing situation which he has himself created. Nobody can tell in\r\nwhat direction he is going to steer his vessel. He likes to strike the\r\nimagination of the public by sudden resolutions. Nobody can prophesy what\r\nwill be the final result of the great political experiment upon which he\r\nhas entered, for it depends on the working of so many different factors,\r\nthat even the boldest will scarcely venture to calculate the issue.”\r\n\r\nThose passages italicized above form a specimen of the kind of attacks,\r\nby no means honorably or reasonably made, upon Count Bismarck, and it is\r\nsomewhat lamentable to read, in the pages of so important a Review, views\r\nquite incompatible with truth, and so calculated to sway the minds of\r\nmany who have little leisure to analyze historical phenomena.\r\n\r\nTime has triumphantly cleared up much that seemed vaguely ominous in\r\nBismarck’s policy, and the progress of events will doubtless throw clear\r\nlight on that which still remains dark and unintelligible to those who\r\ncare little for light.\r\n\r\n                                                 KENNETH R.

MARTIN’S PLACE, TRAFALGAR SQUARE,\r\n          _6th December, 1869_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the First.\r\n\r\nTHE BISMARCKS OF OLDEN TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nNAME AND ORIGIN.\r\n\r\n    Bismarck on the Biese.—The Bismarck Louse.—Derivation of the\r\n    Name Bismarck.—Wendic Origin Untenable.—The Bismarcks in\r\n    Priegnitz and Ruppin.—Riedel’s Erroneous Theory.—The Bismarcks\r\n    of Stendal.—Members of City Guilds.—Claus von Bismarck of\r\n    Stendal.—Rise of the Family into the Highest Rank in the\r\n    Fourteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Alt Mark, belonging to the circle of Stendal, lies the small town\r\nof Bismarck on the Biese. It is an old and famous place, for south of\r\nthe town stands an ancient tower, known as the Bismarck Louse. Tradition\r\nstates that the tower received its name from a gigantic louse which\r\ninhabited it, and that the peasants of the district had every day to\r\nprovide huge quantities of meat for the monster’s food. In this legend\r\nwe can trace the popular spirit of the sober Alt Mark—it laughs at\r\nthe pilgrimages which were made in the thirteenth century to Bismarck\r\nin honor of a holy cross, said to have fallen from heaven. These\r\npilgrimages, at first greatly encouraged by the lords of the soil, as\r\nthey found in them a rich source of income, soon came to a sanguinary\r\nend, from the severe strife occasioned by these very revenues.\r\n\r\nBismarck does not, as some assert, derive its name from the Biese,\r\nbecause in the year 1203, when it is first mentioned in the records,\r\nit is called Biscopesmarck, or Bishopsmark, afterwards corrupted into\r\nBismarck. It belonged to the Bishops of Havelberg, who erected a fort\r\nhere as a defense of their Mark, on the frontiers of the Sprengels of\r\nHalberstadt. From the little town the noble family of Bismarck has its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIt is a tradition of later times, by no means historically confirmed,\r\nthat the Bismarcks were a noble family of Bohemia, settled by Charlemagne\r\nin the Alt Mark, and the founders of the town of Bismarck, which received\r\nits name from them. It is further erroneously asserted, that the\r\nBismarcks, after the decease of the very powerful Count von Osterburg,\r\nhad shared the county with the family of Alvensleben; and thus the town\r\nof Bismarck passed into the possession of the Alvenslebens.[2] This last\r\nis only stated to account for the circumstance of the holding of Bismarck\r\nin the fourteenth century as a fief by the Alvenslebens; it being\r\nforgotten that in those days the title went with the office, and that a\r\ncounty could not therefore be in the possession of two families.\r\n\r\nAs groundless is the tradition of the Wendic descent of the Bismarcks.\r\nAccording to this, the actual name of this noble family should be\r\nBij-smarku, in Wendic, “Beware of the Christ-thorn.” Not very happily has\r\nthe double trefoil in the arms of the Bismarcks been identified with the\r\nChrist-thorn—as a proof of their Wendic descent.\r\n\r\nThe Bismarcks are rather, as are all the families of knightly rank in\r\nthe Alt Mark, the descendants of German warriors who, under the Guelph,\r\nthe Ascanian, or other princes, had conquered the Slavic lands on both\r\nbanks of the Elbe for Christianity and German civilization, and had then\r\nsettled themselves on those lands as fief-holders. The Bismarcks belonged\r\nto the warrior family of Biscopesmarck-Bishopsmark-Bismarck, and when\r\nsurnames came into use, called themselves after their dwelling-place—von\r\nBismarck. Of course, they retained the name after the loss or cession of\r\ntheir original seat.\r\n\r\nLike many other knightly families of the Alt Mark, the Bismarcks\r\ngradually spread towards the East, conquering greater space for German\r\nChristian culture, subduing the Wends or driving them back towards the\r\nOder. Thus the Bismarcks also appear, at the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, as warrior knights in Priegnitz and the region of Ruppin.\r\n\r\nWe can not understand how a historian of such general intelligence as\r\nRiedel, can object to this course of development, presenting so many\r\nanalogies in the series of other races of nobility in the Alt Mark.\r\nAccording to this writer, it appears “credible and plausible” that the\r\nchivalric race of Bismarck, found at the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury in the region of Priegnitz and Ruppin, should have descended\r\nfrom the Castellans at Bismarck, who were provided with some territorial\r\nfiefs on the downfall of the episcopal castle. “On the other hand,” says\r\nRiedel, “those citizen families to be found in the cities of the Mark and\r\nin Stendal, bearing the name of Bismarck, whence that branch arose, the\r\nenergy of which not only equalized the Von Bismarcks with the highest\r\nnobility of the Mark, but has surpassed all of them, by the principles of\r\nunprejudiced historical inquiry are proved to be self-distinguished, and\r\nthe descendants of plain citizens of the little town Bismarck, which had\r\nflourished so well under episcopal protection.”\r\n\r\nThis is, however, an assertion supported by nothing, except, perhaps,\r\nby an accidental negative—the circumstance that up to the present\r\ntime no seal has been found of the undoubtedly chivalric Bismarcks\r\nin Priegnitz and Ruppin; for the identity of armorial bearings would\r\nnecessarily establish the common origin of the knightly Bismarcks, and\r\nthose of Stendal, beyond all question. But we do not understand Riedel’s\r\nobjection, as he does not deny that the Bismarcks entered the first rank\r\nof the aristocracy of the Alt Mark in the same fourteenth century. It\r\nwould be almost puerile, by means of fantastic explanations respecting\r\nthe races bearing the name of Bismarck, to deprive the Minister of the\r\nrank of Junker,[3] and thus claim him as a plebeian.\r\n\r\nFor if the Bismarcks of Stendal appear in the character of citizens\r\nsince the thirteenth century, it proves nothing as to their chivalric\r\ndescent, but may almost be used as an argument in favor of it. It is well\r\nknown and unquestioned that a whole series of knightly families have\r\nsettled themselves in towns, and taken part in municipal government, in\r\nall places at first more or less patrician in character. Thus it fared\r\nwith the Bismarcks in Stendal, and not with them only, but with the\r\nSchadewachts and other Alt Mark knightly races, members of which took\r\ntheir places in the municipal government of Stendal. The Bismarcks were\r\nthen attached to the most distinguished, honorable, and influential\r\nGuild of Tailors (cloth-merchants), because every inhabitant of a town\r\nwas obliged to belong to some guild. But to infer from this that the\r\nBismarcks were of citizen birth, would be as absurd as to deny the\r\nnobility of the Iron Duke, the victor of Waterloo, because the Worshipful\r\nCompany of Merchant Tailors in London, as recognizing his fame, made him\r\nfree of their guild. It is in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, in\r\nfact, and especially in the towns of the Marks, that we find the noblest\r\nfamilies—even the Margrave himself—associated with citizen guilds. At the\r\nsame time it mattered not at all whether such members occupied themselves\r\nwith the trade; for we are not, in this place, speaking of position, but\r\ndescent. And if the practice of handicrafts and commerce were not then,\r\nas later, held to be incompatible with noble birth—although, in general,\r\nthe practice was uncommon—the descendants of noble houses, on leaving\r\nthe towns, naturally re-entered their own rank of territorial lords.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, explicable that Claus von Bismarck, Freeman of the\r\nGuild of Tailors in Stendal, could step from that position into the first\r\nrank of the Alt Mark nobility.\r\n\r\nRiedel is also the only historian who, in contradiction to earlier and\r\nlater authorities, asserts the descent of the Bismarcks from a citizen\r\nfamily in Stendal, instead of from the Castellans of the episcopal\r\ncastle of that name. Even, however, had he been able to determine this\r\nbeyond a doubt, it would not have proved the plebeian descent of the\r\nMinister-President, but only that the nobility of his family reaches\r\nno higher than the fourteenth century—in itself a sufficiently long\r\npedigree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCASTELLANS AT BURGSTALL CASTLE.\r\n\r\n[1270-1550.]\r\n\r\n    Rulo von Bismarck, 1309-1338.—Excommunicated.—Claus von\r\n    Bismarck.—His Policy.—Created Castellan of Burgstall,\r\n    1345.—Castellans.—Reconciliation with Stendal, 1350.—Councillor\r\n    to the Margrave, 1353.—Dietrich Kogelwiet, 1361.—His White\r\n    Hood.—Claus in his Service, while Archbishop of Magdeburg.—The\r\n    Emperor Charles IV.—The Independence of Brandenburg\r\n    threatened.—Chamberlain to the Margrave, 1368.—Subjection\r\n    of the Marks to Bohemia, 1373.—Claus retires into Private\r\n    Life.—Death about 1377.—Claus II., 1403.—Claus III. and\r\n    Henning.—Friedrich I. appoints Henning a Judge.—Ludolf.—His\r\n    Sons.—Pantaleon.—Henning III. _obiit circâ_ 1528.—Claus\r\n    Electoral Ranger, 1512.—Ludolf von Bismarck.—Electoral Sheriff\r\n    of Boetzow, 1513.—His Descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the ancestor of the race of Bismarck, we find among the Bismarcks in\r\nStendal, where they had been known since 1270, a certain Rule or Rulo,\r\notherwise Rudolf von Bismarck, whose name appears in the records from\r\n1309 to 1338. This personage was a respected member of the Guild of\r\nTailors, often its guide and master, as also a member of the Town Council\r\nof Stendal.\r\n\r\nIn the sparse notices contained in the records concerning him, it appears\r\nthat Rule von Bismarck was held in high esteem for his prudence and\r\nwealth. He represented Stendal in the most important negotiations with\r\nprincely courts, carried out political arrangements of every kind, and\r\nin every position maintained a high status among his fellow-townspeople.\r\nHe is also to be regarded as one of the founders of the town schools in\r\nStendal, and met heavy opposition from the Nicholas Cathedral foundation,\r\nwhich claimed the establishment of schools as its sole privilege.\r\nBut under his direction the Council maintained its plans as to the\r\nestablishment of city schools, and realized these despite of the ban\r\nof the Church; probably this, the first Bismarck of whom we have any\r\nknowledge, died an excommunicated man, for his long dispute with the\r\nauthorities was only accommodated at a much later period by his son. Rule\r\nleft behind him four sons, Nicholas I., commonly called Claus, Rulo II.,\r\nknown during his father’s life (and so called in the records) as Rulekin\r\n(the little Rule); the others were John and Christian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BISMARCKS OF OLD.]\r\n\r\nThe younger brothers soon fell into the background. Claus von Bismarck\r\nwas an individual of remarkable character, which, based upon the\r\nhonored name of the family, and the wealth he had inherited, aided him\r\nin extending the sphere of his influence far beyond that of his town\r\ncircle. In testimony of respect to the memory of his father, he was\r\nimmediately assigned the councillor’s seat, vacant by his father’s\r\ndeath. Claus, acting with great moderation, next distinguished himself\r\nin settling the internal differences of the town, and reconciled the\r\nChurch with the memory of his father by large donations, and by the\r\nestablishment of a memorial festival. Very early in his career, however,\r\nhe occupied a singular and duplex political attitude. In the town,\r\nwith animation and wisdom, he headed the patrician element against the\r\ndemocratic innovations of the lower guilds, and stood at the front of\r\nthe aristocratic conservative party in Stendal. But in the country he\r\nsided more and more with the Margrave, at that time of Bavarian origin,\r\nand gradually became one of the leaders of that patriotic Brandenburg\r\nassociation, which sought to reunite the Marks, separated by the death of\r\nWaldemar the Great, under one government.\r\n\r\nThe political activity of Claus von Bismarck in the fourteenth century,\r\noffers many points of similarity to that of his descendant Otto von\r\nBismarck in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn his contest with the democratic party in Stendal, Claus von\r\nBismarck was not very successful. After a long and obstinate fight, the\r\naristocratic Guild of Tailors was worsted. The members of it, and among\r\nthem Claus von Bismarck, were driven out and banished. He now returned\r\nto the country, where he possessed numerous estates, inherited from his\r\nfather; but he did not remain quiet. We see him in continued activity on\r\nbehalf of the Margrave Ludwig, for whom he conducted the most intricate\r\nnegotiations, and to whom he lent considerable sums of money.\r\n\r\nThe reward of his political assiduity was proportionate to its\r\nimportance. On the 15th of June, 1345, the Margrave granted the Castle of\r\nBurgstall, one of the strongholds of the country, protecting the southern\r\nfrontier of the Alt Mark towards Magdeburg, to Claus von Bismarck and his\r\ndescendants, and their brothers, as a fief. Thus the Bismarcks entered\r\nthe first rank of the nobility of the Alt Mark, as Castellans.[4]\r\n\r\nThese Castellan families in the Alt Mark, although they could not claim\r\nany right to a higher rank, formed a privileged class of the chivalric\r\nnobility, which maintained itself by the possession of castles—then of\r\ngreat importance for the defense of the country. The Castellans under the\r\nLuxemburg dynasty, like the members of the Bohemian nobility, were called\r\n_nobiles_, while other classes of the nobility were only denominated\r\n“worshipful,” or _strenui_. They had ingress and precedence at the Diets\r\nbefore the others, were not summoned to those assemblies by proclamation,\r\nbut by writ, and were immediately under the jurisdiction of the Land\r\nCaptain, while ordinary knights were subject to the Courts of Justice\r\nof the province. Although the Castellans maintained a portion of these\r\nrights to very recent times, they were never any thing more than Alt Mark\r\nJunkers, whose families possessed some privileges beyond the rest.\r\n\r\nAmong the Castellans of the fourteenth century were the Von der\r\nSchulenburgs, the Von Alvenslebens, the Von Bartenslebens, the Von\r\nJagows, the Von Knesebecks,[5] and the Von Bismarcks of Burgstall.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the terrible storm which accompanied the appearance\r\nof the pretender Waldemar—whose claims have, however, not yet been\r\ndisproved—Claus von Bismarck prudently withdrew himself, and awaited the\r\nconclusion of these troubles at the Castle of Burgstall. It was the only\r\nthing he could do, for, in the position of circumstances, he could afford\r\nno assistance to the Bavarian Margrave, with whom he was intimately\r\nconnected, and on the general question he could give no decision, as the\r\nperson of Waldemar the Great had never been known to him.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, 1350, a reconciliation took place between the banished\r\naristocratic party and the town of Stendal. Some of the members returned\r\nthither, but Claus von Bismarck, as may be supposed, remained at\r\nBurgstall; but it would appear that from that time forward he stood on\r\nfriendly terms with his native city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853, he became still more closely connected with the\r\nMargrave, in the capacity of Privy Councillor; and in this post, which\r\ncarried no emolument with it whatever, he exhibited energy of such a\r\nwise character that Bismarck’s government, despite of the wretched and\r\nsorrowful state of things at the time, bore rich fruits, not only for the\r\nAlt Mark, but for miserable Brandenburg in general.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1361, Claus quitted the service of Brandenburg for that\r\nof the Archbishop of Magdeburg, in consequence of his near relative,\r\nDietrich von Portitz, known as Kagelwiet or Kogelwiet—_i.e._, White Kogel\r\nor hood—having ascended the archiepiscopal throne of St. Moritz.[6]\r\n\r\nDietrich von Portitz, whose relationship to Claus is unquestionable, but\r\nwhose precise affinity is not clear, was a native of Stendal. He had\r\nembraced the ecclesiastical profession, and had shown such a genius for\r\ngovernment, even as a monk at Lehnin, that the Bishop of Brandenburg,\r\nLudwig von Neiendorff, intrusted him with the administration of his\r\ndiocese, much to his own advantage. The Emperor, Charles IV., early\r\nrecognized the importance of this man; created him Bishop of Sarepta\r\nand Chancellor of Bohemia, subsequently procured him the Bishopric of\r\nMinden, and finally the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. The cognomen of\r\nKagelwiet or Kogelwiet this distinguished person received from a castle\r\nof this name in Bohemia, but according to some, from the white hood\r\nwhich he had assumed in orders at Lehnin. A tradition asserts that the\r\nBohemian magnates, envious of the eminence of the Chancellor, accused\r\nhim of fraud, and referred the Emperor to the iron chest which stood in\r\nDietrich’s private chamber. When Charles IV. had this chest opened by\r\nDietrich, there was only found within it the monk’s frock, the white hood\r\nof Brother Dietrich of Lehnin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to the relationship between the Archbishop Dietrich Kogelwiet and\r\nClaus Bismarck, it must be admitted that it has not been clearly\r\nestablished by the records. But we think we do not err in assuming\r\nthat Dietrich Kogelwiet was also one of the Bismarcks of Stendal of\r\nthe same family as Claus von Bismarck. He certainly is called Dietrich\r\nvon Portitz, but we must not consider this singular in an age when\r\nbrothers even existed with different surnames; and, on the other hand,\r\nan identical name by no means establishes any relationship, or places it\r\nbeyond doubt.\r\n\r\nCommon armorial bearings were a much surer index to family affinity\r\nbetween their wearers than identical names. We can not, as before stated,\r\nabsolutely prove from the records that the Archbishop Dietrich Kogelwiet\r\nwas a Bismarck: it may be decided by later researches, but there are\r\nseveral reasons for considering this to be the case. There was no family\r\nof Portitz at Stendal, to claim the Archbishop, as a scion of their\r\nhouse—an important fact, as the birthplace of Dietrich is ascertained to\r\nhave been Stendal.\r\n\r\nWhen Dietrich Kogelwiet entered on the government of the Archbishopric\r\nof Magdeburg, he immediately summoned his relative, Claus Bismarck, to\r\nassist in his administration. Such an invitation might have been the\r\nmore welcome, in consequence of the hopeless condition of the Margrave’s\r\naffairs. It must not be forgotten that Claus was not only a vassal to\r\nBrandenburg, but to Magdeburg, and was connected by blood and friendship\r\nwith many members of the Cathedral community.\r\n\r\nThus Claus von Bismarck, in conjunction with the knight Meinecke von\r\nSchierstaedt, became General Commandant of Magdeburg. The duties were\r\nso shared between them that Von Schierstaedt fulfilled the office of\r\nMinister of War, while Von Bismarck was Minister of the Interior and of\r\nFinance. Foreign affairs, and especially those relating to Brandenburg,\r\nthe Archbishop had reserved for himself—why, we shall presently see.\r\nWe must not, however, regard the various duties in those days as so\r\nclearly defined as in a modern government; the distinctions were less\r\nobvious, and thus we see Claus von Bismarck in many a battle-field,\r\nfighting bravely beside Schierstaedt. Dietrich Kogelwiet and his two\r\nchief servants, in fact, carried on a really model government. In the\r\ncourse of a few years the very considerable debts of the Archbishopric\r\nwere liquidated, estates pawned or wholly alienated were redeemed, and\r\nthe security of the subjects of the See fixed in a manner rarely known\r\nin Germany at that era. Bismarck’s constant care was devoted to the\r\nprotection of the peasantry against the frequent outbreaks, usually\r\nending in the plunder or destruction of property; for his clear insight\r\nhad perceived that the safety of the life and property of the subject was\r\nbound up with that of the liege lord’s income—apparently a secret to most\r\nrulers of that time.\r\n\r\nThus this six years’ administration of the See by Bismarck became a great\r\nblessing to it, and Dietrich Kogelwiet recognized the fact by implicit\r\nconfidence, although—a very remarkable circumstance, impossible at the\r\npresent day—he was opposed to Bismarck in his foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe politic Emperor Charles IV. had especially seated his Bohemian\r\nChancellor upon the archiepiscopal throne of St. Moritz, with the\r\nabsolute intention of securing in him an efficient co-operator in his\r\nextensive plans. Dietrich Kogelwiet was to aid in the conquest of the\r\nMark of Brandenburg for the great Bohemian empire which Charles IV.\r\nsought to erect from Lübeck to the coast of the Adriatic for the house\r\nof Lützelburg. Dietrich Kogelwiet had from of old been a chief supporter\r\nof these aims, and, as Archbishop of Magdeburg, he succeeded only too\r\nwell, considering the weakness and poverty of the Bavarian Margrave,\r\nin ensnaring him and bringing him into relations which rendered him an\r\nunconditional and very abject dependent of the Emperor. At the death\r\nof the Archbishop, after a reign of six years, the independence of\r\nBrandenburg was lost, and the councillors of the Margrave consisted of\r\nimperial servants alien to Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nClaus von Bismarck held utterly aloof from this policy of his chief, for\r\nhis Brandenburg patriotism desired the maintenance of the independence of\r\nthe Marks. He saw no safety in the division of his native land, and its\r\nfinal subjection to the crown of Bohemia. Despite of these differences,\r\nthe Archbishop held fast to his “dear uncle”—a designation applied in\r\nthose days as cousin is now—bequeathed to him the greater part of his\r\nwealth, appointed him his executor, and a member of the interregnum\r\nprovided to exist until the enthronement of his successor in the See.\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck had acquitted himself of his duties towards the Church\r\nof Magdeburg, and had overcome the many obstacles towards a settlement\r\nof the inheritance of Dietrich Kogelwiet, he did what he had probably\r\nlong since designed. He returned to the service of the Margrave of\r\nBrandenburg. This step can only be explained by the high patriotism which\r\nactuated this excellent man. For himself he had nothing to gain by such a\r\nstep, and he must have been aware of the sacrifice he was making, for the\r\naffairs of the Margrave at that time were in the utmost confusion, and\r\nin a ruinous condition. The national income had long been anticipated,\r\nmoney was rare, and the partially justified concurrent government of the\r\nimperial councillors seemed to render it impossible to save the autonomy\r\nof Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Charles, to whom Bismarck’s conduct was sufficiently\r\nintelligible, sought with great pains to win him to his party, but in\r\nvain. The faithful Alt Mark Junker, in 1368, became administrator of the\r\nMargrave’s government in the capacity of Chamberlain, and conducted his\r\npatriotic labor with such energy and wisdom, that by the October of that\r\nyear the imperial councillors placed about the Margrave were dismissed,\r\nand their posts entirely filled by Brandenburgers of Bismarck’s party.\r\nIn this new Council there sat Dietrich von der Schulenburg, Bishop of\r\nBrandenburg, the noblest prelate in the land; Count Albert von Lindau,\r\nLord of Ruppin, the chief vassal of the Margrave; Bismarck himself was\r\nChamberlain for the Alt Mark; Marshal Sir Lippold von Bredow for the\r\nMiddle Mark; and Justice Otto von Moerner represented the New Mark.\r\n\r\nBismarck and his friends now actively promoted the safety of Brandenburg\r\nindependence by every means in their power during a period of five years.\r\nBismarck was the soul of this patriotic struggle against the policy and\r\nrapacity of the mighty Emperor. His wisdom and energy were visible in\r\nevery department of the State; his immense wealth he freely sacrificed in\r\nevery direction; and the results were so important that they forced the\r\ndisconcerted Emperor to a measure which even Bismarck had not been able\r\nto foresee as a wholly unexpected proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe politic Charles, who had never speculated upon an appeal to arms, and\r\nwho depended on the cunning, of which he was so great a master, before\r\ndisplayed in his counsels, suddenly seized the sword. He perceived that\r\nhe was unable to outwit Bismarck, and was compelled to emerge from his\r\nlair and break up the independence of Brandenburg by force. Bismarck\r\ncould not oppose his mighty army, and thus by the treaty of Fürstenwald\r\nthe independence of Brandenburg was lost, on the 13th of August, 1373;\r\nthe Marks fell into the hands of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nAfter this destruction of his patriotic plans, Claus von Bismarck retired\r\ninto private life, most probably to Burgstall; but the proximity of the\r\ngreat Emperor, who held his court at Tangermünde, forced him to retreat\r\nfrom the former place. Neither Claus nor his sons ever served the house\r\nof Lützelburg. He then retired to his native city of Stendal, and\r\noccupied himself with religious duties and the affairs of the Hospital\r\nof St. Gertrude, which he had founded at the Uengling Gate of Stendal\r\nin 1370. Probably this foundation again embroiled the aged man with the\r\necclesiastical authorities during his closing years, and he seems to have\r\ndied in excommunication, like his father. We do not know either the year\r\nof the birth or death of this illustrious and patriotic man. He appears\r\nfirst in the records in the year 1328, and we lose sight of him in 1377.\r\nHe is buried at Burgstall, with the simple inscription, “_Nicolaus de\r\nBismarck miles_” on the tomb. He bequeathed to his sons a fortune of\r\ngreat amount in those days—consisting of lands, treasures, and ready\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThese sons, Rule, Claus II., and John, with the patriotic spirit of\r\ntheir father, held aloof from the Emperor Charles IV., despite of all\r\nthe efforts he made to draw the rich and illustrious possessors of\r\nBurgstall to the Court at Tangermünde. Claus became a knight, and is\r\nthence mentioned in precedence of his elder brother Rule in the records,\r\nfrom the year 1376. Rule died without heirs; the knight Claus alone\r\nleft any family, and died in 1403. The third brother, John, became an\r\necclesiastic, and was still living in 1431.\r\n\r\nThe sons of the knight Claus were respectively named Claus III., and\r\nHenning. They inhabited Burgstall in common, but in consequence of a\r\ndispute with the Chapter of the Cathedral of St. Nicholas, in Stendal,\r\nthey were excommunicated; but they do not appear to have suffered much in\r\nconsequence, as public opinion had long since declared against the abuse\r\nof excommunication common with the Churchmen. Claus and Henning were\r\nbrave but peaceable individuals, who had a most difficult position to\r\nmaintain during the bloody feuds and endless fighting of that convulsed\r\nage. The brethren Bismarck were the first among the nobility of the Alt\r\nMark to take the part of the Burgrave Frederick von Nürnberg, regarding\r\nthat great prince as the saviour and deliverer of the Marks.\r\n\r\nFrederick I. seems also to have had confidence in the Bismarcks, for in\r\n1414 he appointed Henning one of the judges in the great suit of felony\r\nagainst Werner von Holzendorff,[7] who occupied, in the capacity of the\r\nMargrave’s captain, the castle Boetzow—now Oranienburg—and had betrayed\r\nthis castle to Dietrich von Quitzow.[8] Claus on his part served the\r\nelectoral prince in pecuniary matters, but he died in 1437, and his\r\nbrother Henning had preceded him to the grave by ten years.\r\n\r\nAs Henning’s only son Ruloff had died in his youth without issue, the\r\nsons of Claus alone succeeded to the property. Their names were Ludolf,\r\nHeide (Heidrich), and Henning. They inherited that love for country life\r\nand the pleasures of the chase peculiar to the Bismarcks. These brothers\r\nimproved and increased the condition of the house, which seems to have\r\nsuffered amidst the strife of the evil days of previous generations. The\r\ntime of Ludolf’s death is unknown; Heide was living in 1489; Henning died\r\nin 1505—his wife was Sabine von Alvensleben.\r\n\r\nThe male heirs of Ludolf and Henning divided the property of their\r\nfathers, but preserved much in common—the residence of Burgstall Castle\r\namong the rest.\r\n\r\nThe four sons of Ludolf were Günther, Ludolf, George, and Pantaleon.\r\nThey were ennobled, together with their cousins, in 1499, by the Elector\r\nJoachim I., but the two elder brothers soon died without male heirs,\r\nand the third brother, George, was childless; it does not appear that\r\nhe was ever married. Pantaleon alone left a son, Henning III., by his\r\nwife Ottilien von Bredow, who died before 1528, leaving four sons\r\nbehind him—Henry, Levin, Frederick, and Laurence. Levin and Laurence\r\nsoon disappear from the records, and Henry, married to Ilse from the\r\nKattenwinkel, and Frederick, wedded to Anna von Wenckstern, appear as\r\nthe representatives of the elder stock of Ludolf. All these Bismarcks\r\nlived in peaceful retirement, on the best terms, at Burgstall, with their\r\ncousins of the younger Henning-branch of the family.\r\n\r\nHenning II. and his wife Sabine von Alvensleben had as sons, Busso,\r\nClaus, Dietrich, and Ludolf. Dietrich and Busso dying in early youth,\r\nClaus became in 1512 the Electoral Ranger of the great estate of\r\nGardelegen (the forests of Jävenitz and Letzling). The rangers were in\r\nthose days high officials (chief foresters); the title, however, they did\r\nnot obtain until the time of King Frederick William I., with considerable\r\nprivileges. The foresters were then literally called heath-runners\r\n(_Haide-läufer_)—rangers, in fact.\r\n\r\nLudolf von Bismarck in 1513 became Electoral Sheriff of Boetzow, the\r\npresent Oranienburg. His activity appears to have been applied to the\r\nprotection of the Electoral game preserves. Ludolf was reckoned one of\r\nthe best horsemen and warriors of his era, although we do not learn any\r\nthing respecting his prowess. He seems to have been very active in the\r\nestablishment of the militia of the Alt Mark, and died in 1534. His wife,\r\nHedwig von Doeberitz, long survived him. In the year 1543, the Elector\r\nJoachim owed her a thousand thalers, and she was still alive in 1562.\r\nLudolf’s sons were Jobst, Joachim, and George.\r\n\r\nJoachim was killed at the siege of Magdeburg, at which he was present\r\nwith his brothers. Jobst married Emerentia Schenk von Lützendorf. George\r\nmarried Armengard von Alvensleben.\r\n\r\nWe thus see the castle of Burgstall in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury inhabited by two pairs of brothers, with four households; Henry\r\nand Frederick representing the elder or Ludolf branch of the Bismarcks,\r\nand Jobst and George the younger one through Henning. Ludolf’s widow also\r\nresided at Burgstall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PERMUTATION.\r\n\r\n[1550-1563.]\r\n\r\n    Changes.—The Electoral Prince John George and\r\n    Burgstall.—Forest-rights.—The Exchange of Burgstall for\r\n    Crevese.—Schönhausen and Fischbeck.—The Permutation completed,\r\n    1563.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoomed to a sorrowful termination was the peaceful life of the family of\r\nthe Bismarcks at Burgstall. All the Bismarcks were eager sportsmen, and\r\nthere was no spot in the whole of the Brandenburg country better adapted\r\nfor sport than their castle, situated in the midst of the great preserve\r\nof Gardelegen, the woods of the Tanger, and of the Ohre.\r\n\r\nThese preserves were not only the most considerable, but also the most\r\nwell-stocked in the Marks; and although only a small portion belonged\r\nto the Bismarcks, they enjoyed forest privileges conjointly with their\r\nneighbors to the fullest extent. It was not remarkable, therefore, to\r\nfind the Castellans of Burgstall “mighty hunters;” but a still mightier\r\nhunter was destined to overwhelm them, and compel them to give up their\r\nprivileges in forest and moor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvery one of the descendants of the great Frankish prince, the Burgrave\r\nFrederick von Nürnberg—all the powerful Electors and noble Margraves of\r\nBrandenburg—were considerable sportsmen. They had early perceived that\r\nno place was more convenient than Burgstall Castle, when they desired to\r\nhunt near the Tanger, through the forest of Gardelegen, the Drömling, and\r\nother preserves of the Ohre. They often visited their trusty vassals at\r\nBurgstall, and for weeks together were welcome guests of the Bismarcks,\r\nwhose wealth could well maintain the expensive hospitality of princely\r\nguests. The Electors John Cicero and Joachim Nestor were frequently at\r\nBurgstall. We know that the Bismarcks were one of the first families\r\nof the country, allied to the new Frank rulers; even at a later time\r\nthe Bismarcks were proud of their loyalty to their liege lords; but the\r\nintimate personal relations which the Bismarcks maintained with the\r\nElectors John Cicero, Joachim Nestor, Joachim Hector, and the Electoral\r\nPrince and Margrave John George, engendered feelings of personal\r\naffection and respect, far surpassing the ordinary loyalty of vassals.\r\n\r\nThis has to be remembered when it is sought to understand the events\r\nwhich took place in 1562 among the Bismarcks in their right light.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunt-loving Electoral Prince, the Margrave John George,\r\nbecame administrator in the year 1553 for his youthful son, the\r\npostulated Bishop of the See of Havelberg, he followed the chase more\r\nenthusiastically than ever, and founded the hunting-box in Netzlingen,\r\npurchased from the Alvenslebens in 1555, known as Letzlingen. In order\r\nto establish wider preserves for the new edifice, he everywhere attacked\r\nthe privileges of the Bismarcks; and his object was to abridge or to\r\nabrogate their forest rights in all directions. The Bismarcks, known to\r\nus as zealous sportsmen, did not wish to dispose of their forest rights;\r\ntheir position at Burgstall did not admit of pecuniary compensation; but\r\nthey, nevertheless, from a feeling of respect for the Electoral Prince,\r\nconsented to a treaty which considerably circumscribed their privileges,\r\nmuch to their disadvantage. This treaty was signed at Zechlin, on the 1st\r\nJuly, 1555, in person, the Prince residing at that place. They asked for\r\nno compensation from the Prince, but allowed him to fix it as he pleased,\r\naccepting without a murmur a deed acknowledging a debt of three thousand\r\n_gulden_, a sum by no means representing the amount of their loss. By\r\nthis sacrifice they purchased peace, however, for but a very short time;\r\nfor while the differences continued between the Margrave’s huntsmen and\r\nthose of Bismarck, the Electoral Prince could not but perceive that\r\nthe Castellanship of Burgstall stuck like a wedge in the centre of his\r\npreserves. He desired to have the entire control from Letzlingen, where\r\nJohn George habitually held his court, to the castle of Tangermünde;\r\nhence it was necessary to dispossess the Bismarcks of Burgstall.\r\n\r\nThis honorable and faithful family suffered deeply, when, in the\r\nbeginning of the year 1562, the Electoral Prince proposed to them to\r\nexchange Burgstall for other lands. He first offered them the convent of\r\nArendsee; but the Bismarcks, who could not, at first, contemplate the\r\nresignation of their ancient family-seat, declined to this procedure.\r\nThe affair was of such an unusual character that it created the greatest\r\nexcitement. Even the Chapter at Magdeburg, to whom the Bismarcks were\r\nlieges for several possessions at Burgstall, was set in commotion. They\r\ndreaded an enlargement of the boundary of Brandenburg, beyond this\r\npurchase of Burgstall, to the detriment of the archiepiscopate. The\r\nArchbishop of Magdeburg, the Margrave Sigismund, and brother of the\r\nElectoral Prince, also wrote, apparently at the instance of his Chapter,\r\nto him, “that he hoped he would desist from his intention, and leave the\r\nBismarcks in peaceful possession of their lands, and allow other folks to\r\nhave a hare, a buck, or a stag.”\r\n\r\nJohn George, however, was not the man to be so easily dissuaded from his\r\npurpose. He continued to ply the Bismarcks with propositions of exchange,\r\nwhich they as steadily rejected, being unwilling to resign Burgstall. But\r\ntheir rejection was of no advantage to them, for their loyal principles\r\nwere outraged at this difference with their liege lord; and, besides, it\r\nbecame very evident to them that the Electoral Prince had no intention\r\nof abandoning his plans. If the brothers and cousins Von Bismarck had\r\npossessed a spark of speculation, they might, under the circumstances,\r\nhave obtained compensation of such magnitude as to have formed an\r\nenormous revenue for their house; but such thoughts were remote from\r\nthese loyal and simple-minded country Junkers.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Prince, who knew his men, employed measures which he saw\r\nmust lead to his object without fail. On the 12th of October, 1562, he\r\nwrote, from Letzlingen, a letter in very ungracious terms, in which he\r\ngave up his project of exchange in the greatest anger, but allowed a\r\nwhole series of minor difficulties to become apparent for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Bismarcks replied in a highly respectful manner, and reminded the\r\nElectoral Prince, in almost touching accents, “that their ancestors and\r\nthemselves had for a long time sat worthily under the Electoral Princes,\r\nhad served them with blood and substance willingly, and testified\r\nthemselves to be honest, upright, and true subjects, and would willingly\r\nhave met the estimable Elector and Prince, the Margrave of Brandenburg,\r\nin these very matters; although they might be forgiven for hesitating at\r\nan exchange which would transport their ancient race to other places,\r\nand they would prefer to remain in their ancestral seat, granted them by\r\nAlmighty God, rather than idly to depart therefrom.”\r\n\r\nThis letter, however, was the limit of the powers of the Bismarcks.\r\nThe Electoral Prince had taken his measures only too well. There now\r\nensued very active and weighty negotiations as to the compensation to\r\nbe given for Burgstall. This was not easily to be found, and these\r\nnegotiations prove, as also their final result, that the Bismarcks agreed\r\nto the surrender of Burgstall out of respect to the Prince, and from an\r\napprehension of setting themselves in actual hostility to the authorities\r\nas the result of any further refusal.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the elder race—Henry and Frederick—first\r\nassented, and took for their shares in Burgstall the Abbey of Crevese, a\r\nfoundation of Benedictine nuns. The income of this property, with all its\r\nappurtenances, did not amount by far to those enjoyed by the brothers in\r\nBurgstall; but no better estate could be found, and the Prince therefore\r\ncommanded the payment of considerable sums in satisfaction—not, however,\r\nexceeding the moderate amount of two thousand _thalers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the house of Bismarck seemed even more disconsolate at the\r\nloss of Burgstall than the men. To terminate their lamentations, the\r\nPrince allowed each of them the sum of one hundred _gulden_.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the younger branch—Jobst and George von\r\nBismarck—were still more unfortunate. They hesitated longer than their\r\ncousins, not from want of will, but because the proffered compensation\r\nwas still more incommensurate with what they lost. But at last, moved\r\nby the instances and promises of the Prince, they agreed to accept\r\nSchönhausen and Fischbeck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th December of the year 1562, all the Bismarcks had met together\r\nat Letzlingen with the Prince, and the agreements were here executed\r\nby which they surrendered Burgstall for Crevese and Schönhausen. The\r\ngrandchildren of the first Claus von Bismarck might well be sorry\r\nat this surrender. The exchange expressly excluded the Hospital of\r\nSt. Gertrude at Stendal, as well as their possessions at Wolmirstädt,\r\nBurg, and other remote places in the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. The\r\nPermutation, as it was called, did not alter the vassaldom of the\r\nBismarcks; they continued to be lieges of Magdeburg for the fiefs\r\nabandoned with Burgstall, and vassals of Brandenburg, as before,\r\nbelonging to the Alt Mark nobility in respect of Schönhausen and\r\nFischbeck.\r\n\r\nThe Bismarcks still remained a very considerable family after the\r\npermutation, but their original position was lost by the cession of\r\nBurgstall, and their former wealth much decreased. That the permutation\r\nalso had its effect in manifold ways on the character of the family can\r\nnot be denied. It was a great sacrifice to bring to the governing house,\r\nalthough the Bismarcks very likely under-estimated the magnitude of their\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nBy the Easter of 1563 the Bismarcks had quitted Burgstall, and taken\r\npossession of Crevese. The Electoral Prince had hurried their departure\r\nin consequence of the breeding season of the game and the advance of\r\nspring. On the third day after Easter he granted them Schönhausen, in the\r\nname of his son, the Bishop of Havelberg, having obtained the consent of\r\nthe Chapter on the previous day.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BISMARCKS OF SCHÖNHAUSEN.\r\n\r\n[1563-1800.]\r\n\r\n    Further Genealogy of the Bismarcks.—Captain Ludolf von\r\n    Bismarck.—Ludolf August von Bismarck.—His remarkable\r\n    Career.—Dies in the Russian Service 1750.—Frederick William\r\n    von Bismarck.—Created Count by the King of Würtemberg.—Charles\r\n    Alexander von Bismarck, 1727.—His Memorial to his Wife.—His\r\n    Descendants.—Charles William Ferdinand, Father of Count Otto\r\n    von Bismarck.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four families of the race of Bismarck, who quitted Burgstall at\r\nthe Easter of 1563, three had perished in the male line in the first\r\ngeneration; the youngest branch had completely died out with Jobst and\r\nGeorge; and in the elder, Henry had left behind his only daughter, Anna\r\nOttilie, who married Fritz von der Schulenburg at Uetz. Frederick alone\r\nperpetuated the race, and all the property of the elder and younger\r\nbranches at Crevese and Schönhausen fell to his line. He was known in\r\nearly days as the Permutator. Perhaps he had represented his family in\r\nthe negotiations with the Electoral Prince respecting Burgstall; we have\r\nseen that the two brothers of the elder line preceded the younger ones\r\nin conceding the property. But the designation is unfitting, as he was\r\nrather permutated (bartered) than a permutator.\r\n\r\nOn his death in 1589, he left behind him, by his marriage with Anna von\r\nWenckstern, three sons and a daughter. The race of the youngest son,\r\nAbraham, and of his wife Anna Schenck von Flechtingen, perished in the\r\nnext generation. The second son, Pantaleon, married to Anna von der\r\nSchulenburg, is the ancestor of the flourishing and numerous branches of\r\nthe Bismarcks of Crevese.\r\n\r\nThe Schönhausen branch was continued by Frederick’s eldest son, the\r\nCaptain Ludolf von Bismarck. In 1560 he joined in a campaign against the\r\nTurks under the command of Wolff Gleissenthaler, who commanded a troop of\r\n1,300 horse in the name of the Elector of Saxony, in the imperial army.\r\nLudolf married Sophie von Alvensleben in 1579, and died in 1598. He was\r\nsucceeded in the possession of Schönhausen by his only son Valentine,\r\nwho married Bertha von der Asseburg[10] in 1607, and died on the 12th\r\nof April, 1620. His second son, August von Bismarck, succeeded him at\r\nSchönhausen. He was born on the 13th of February, 1611, and died the\r\n2d of February, 1670, a Colonel in the Elector of Brandenburg’s army,\r\nand Commandant of the fortress of Peitz. Having entered the army in his\r\nearliest youth, he took service under the Rhinegrave in 1631. After the\r\nbattle of Nördlingen, in 1634, he served in the army of Duke Bernhard of\r\nWeimar; served also till 1640 in Lothringen, Burgundy, and France, but\r\nthen passed over into the service of Brandenburg. He was thrice married,\r\nfirst to Helene Elizabeth von Kottwitz, then to Dorothea Elizabeth von\r\nKatte,[11] and lastly to Frederica Sophia von Möllendorff.[12]\r\n\r\nA young brother of this August was Valentine Busso; born 1622, died 18th\r\nof May, 1679; had issue by his wife, a Von Bardeleben,[13] the General\r\nFrederick Christopher von Bismarck, who died in command of Küstrin in\r\n1704. The second son of the first marriage of Christopher Frederick\r\nwith Louise Margarethe von der Asseburg, was Ludolf August, the only\r\nadventurous member of the family of the Bismarcks of Schönhausen.\r\n\r\nLudolf August von Bismarck was born on the 21st of March, 1683, entered\r\nthe army at an early age, and as a valiant soldier, a handsome person, of\r\nrare intellect, he made a great figure. Something uneasy and adventurous\r\nwas early observed in his character. On the 22d of November, 1704, he\r\nmarried Johanna Margarethe von der Asseburg, who died in 1719, only\r\nleaving him a daughter, Albertine Louise, and who married, in 1738 or\r\n1739, a Prussian officer, named Frederick William von der Alben. When\r\na lieutenant-colonel in garrison at Magdeburg, Ludolf August had the\r\nmisfortune to kill a footman, either in anger or when intoxicated. He\r\nconcealed the corpse under the bed, and fled. Nevertheless, he obtained\r\na pardon through his great patron General Field-Marshal Gneomar Dubislaw\r\nvon Natzmer,[14] who possessed great influence with King Frederick\r\nWilliam I., and had won great fame in battle against the Swedes, Turks,\r\nand French, and was also distinguished for exemplary piety. He was the\r\nstepbrother of Count Zinzendorf, the founder of the Moravians, through\r\nhis second wife, born a Von Gersdorf. Bismarck was pardoned for his\r\ndesertion, and reinstated; but promotion did not ensue. Bismarck was\r\nthrice passed over on regimental changes; for the King entertained some\r\nanger against him, despite of his experience. Bismarck did not bear this\r\nlong; he sold his estate of Skatiken in Prussian Lithuania, quitted the\r\narmy, and entered the Russian service in 1732. In the next year, on the\r\n26th of May, 1733, he married a Mademoiselle Trotte von Treyden, whose\r\nsister was the wife of Biron,[15] the favorite of the Empress Anna, and\r\nafterwards Duke of Courland. He combined his fortunes with those of\r\nthat remarkable personage; but shared his disgrace, and was banished\r\nto Siberia. But by means of his considerable talents he seemed to have\r\nmade friends outside of the Biron party, for he was soon recalled, and\r\nappointed a General. Bismarck governed several districts with ability,\r\nand fulfilled some diplomatic missions, especially at the court of\r\nLondon, to the perfect satisfaction of all, and seems to have conducted\r\nhimself with peculiar tact, so as to come into collision with no party;\r\nand he succeeded in maintaining the position he had earned in the service\r\nof the State. He finally became General in the Ukraine, and died in\r\nOctober, 1750, at Pultawa. He left no issue by his second marriage, with\r\nthe sister of the Duchess Biron of Courland.\r\n\r\nA century after Ludolf August, a second Bismarck of Schönhausen visited\r\nRussia, under specially honorable circumstances. This was Frederick\r\nWilliam von Bismarck, the famous Cavalry General of Würtemberg, also\r\nknown as an esteemed military author. He was born on the 28th of July,\r\n1783, at Windheim on the Weser, and joined the Brunswick service in\r\n1797. He afterwards served in England, and finally in Würtemberg, where\r\nhe very greatly distinguished himself, and rose to the rank of General.\r\nHe was the Würtemberg ambassador to Berlin, Dresden, Hanover, and\r\nCarlsruhe. He aided in the reconstruction of the Danish army in 1826, and\r\nwas esteemed so high an authority on cavalry matters, that the Emperor\r\nNicholas summoned him, in 1835, to Russia, to inspect his cavalry. In\r\n1818, Bismarck was created a Count by the King of Würtemberg, which\r\ntitle he transmitted after his marriage with the Princess Augusta Amalia\r\nof Nassau-Usingen (born 30th December, 1778; died 16th July, 1846, the\r\nlast of the line Nassau-Usingen),[16] on her bringing him no issue, to\r\nthe descendants of his deceased elder brother, John Henry Ludwig. On the\r\n3d of April, 1848, he again married Amalia Julie Thibaut, and died on\r\nthe 18th of June, 1860. His descendants by this marriage, a son and a\r\ndaughter, form the second lines of the Count Bismarcks of Würtemberg, the\r\nother line existing in the family of his deceased brother.\r\n\r\nThe third Bismarck of Schönhausen, who went to Russia as the\r\nrepresentative of His Majesty the King of Prussia, is our\r\nMinister-President.\r\n\r\nColonel August von Bismarck was succeeded in Schönhausen by his second\r\nson, also named August;—born the 15th of May, 1666; married the 24th of\r\nApril, 1694, to Dorothea Sophie von Katte; died the 18th of June, 1732.\r\nHe was Councillor and Land Commissioner to the Elector of Brandenburg,\r\nthe builder or restorer of the present mansion of Schönhausen. He was\r\nsucceeded by the eldest of his seven sons, August Frederick—born the 2d\r\nof April, 1695—who met a hero’s death as Colonel and Commandant of the\r\nregiment of Anspach-Baireuth Dragoons in the year 1742, at the battle\r\nof Chotusitz.[17] It is said that the Minister-President in person is\r\nextremely like this Bismarck, his great-grandfather, who was an excellent\r\nsoldier, and high in favor with Frederick the Great. August Frederick\r\nwas twice married, first to Stephanie von Dewitz, and then to Frederica\r\nCharlotte von Tresckow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES ALEXANDER VON BISMARCK.]\r\n\r\nThe second son of the first marriage of this brave soldier was the\r\nintellectual Charles Alexander von Bismarck, born in 1727. He was about\r\nto accompany his maternal uncle, one of the Von Dewitz family, to his\r\npost, which was that of Prussian Ambassador to Vienna, when Frederick the\r\nGreat appointed his future to be otherwise. Charles Alexander entered\r\nthe royal chamber an attaché of the embassy, but quitted it as a cavalry\r\nofficer. He was averse to the military art, and soon obtained his\r\ndischarge as a captain. On the 5th of March, 1762, he married Christine\r\nCharlotte Gottliebe von Schönfeld—born the 25th of December, 1741;\r\ndeceased on the 22d of October, 1772—her mother having been a sister of\r\nhis mother, one of the Dewitz family. An elegant French composition, by\r\nCharles Alexander, is preserved; a spirited and touching memorial of his\r\ndeparted wife, in the inflated style of those days. The title of this\r\ncomposition—of greater merit than usually the case with such writings—is\r\nas follows: “Eloge ou Monument érigé à la Mémoire de C. C. G. de\r\nBismarck, née de Schoenfeld, par Charles Alexandre de Bismarck. Berlin,\r\n1774.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTINE VON BISMARCK.]\r\n\r\nWe select a few passages therefrom:—\r\n\r\n“My friend lost her mother (Sophie Eleonore von Dewitz) in her earliest\r\nchildhood, and her maternal grandmother (Louise Emilie von Dewitz, born\r\na Von Zeethen of the family of Trebnitz) took her to live with her at\r\nHoffelde. She was there nurtured in retirement and innocence, and already\r\nwon my heart by her filial gentleness. There I found her once more,\r\nafter years of war and life in a distant garrison, in perfect innocence,\r\nthe charming picture of a blushing rose. O! that ye could return, ye\r\nhours of rapture! when the society of this sweet creature, who in her\r\nsolitude had received nothing from art, but every thing from the hand\r\nof nature, filled my soul with such celestial joy, that in possessing\r\nher I forgot, not alone every evil of life, but even every minor grief!\r\nReturn at least for an instant to my remembrance, ye sweetest of hours,\r\nfor alas! the pang of sorrow will needs drive you away too soon! Above\r\nall, return, thou memory of yon magnificent spring night, upon which I\r\nwandered, between my best-beloved and her dear sister, in the outskirts\r\nof a majestic and peaceful forest, under the silvery moonlight, while the\r\nbrooks trilled and the nightingale raised her sorrowing tones. My heart\r\nwas instinct with love, and attuned to the enchanting prospect. I felt\r\nthe beauty of the earth, and the still greater loveliness of innocence,\r\nindwelling those hearts so full of affection for me! But, no! this\r\nreminiscence is now too powerful for my feelings, and my tear-bedewed\r\neye is too weak to bear the dazzling glory of joy! No other evening is\r\ndestined for me on earth such as that was! She exists no longer who made\r\nthat evening more charming to me than all the beauties of nature. She\r\nhas left me forever! Soon afterwards our society was interrupted, our\r\nsupposed felicity was bitterly destroyed. Our grandmother, the refuge of\r\nher grandchildren, the sustainer of all the poor of her neighborhood,\r\ndied. My friend and I were parted, and the sorrow which succeeds all\r\nevanescent joy became our portion.\r\n\r\n“Still it was not that terrible misery which now oppresses my heart.\r\nWell-founded hopes comforted and the tenderest affection aided us. My\r\nhopes were not in vain. The slight cloud which had veiled the morning\r\nsun—which gave me life—passed away, and his ray soon shone forth with\r\naccustomed glory. With anxious unrest I yearned to associate myself\r\nwith my friend to the brink of the grave. Could I but have done so for\r\neternity! Our compact, however, is not yet broken, and will endure as\r\nlong as my tears can flow, and the soul of my beloved was too beautiful\r\nto prevent their flowing forever. Her excellent father, who might have\r\nbestowed her on a better and a richer man, gave her to me because my\r\nbeloved would not have a better or richer man, nor any man save myself.\r\nWhat words, my father, could express my thanks for this favor, unless\r\nthey could to some extent mark the value of your daughter, and stand in\r\nsome relation to my lost happiness and my present grief! The silent\r\ntears that overflow my cheeks are more eloquent than words. You can not\r\nsee my tears, but perchance God beholds them, and your daughter also. A\r\ntear is the only gratitude I can offer. May the conviction cheer you that\r\nyou could not have given your virtuous daughter to any one who loved her\r\nmore affectionately, faithfully, and unselfishly than I did!\r\n\r\n“You then gave her to me, my father. The 5th of March, 1762, was the\r\nhappiest day of my life. I still hear the words which my tender bride\r\nselected for herself: ‘_Intreat me not to leave thee or to return from\r\nfollowing after thee, for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou\r\nlodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.\r\nWhere thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so\r\nto me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me_’ (Ruth i. 16,\r\n17). I cherish the hope, the only hope now animating me, that even death\r\ndoes not part us.\r\n\r\n“With what delight, my friend and my father, did I then receive her\r\nfrom your hand. Alas! that I had left her with thee! I declare with the\r\nsincerity of one who is comfortless that I should have done so, had I\r\nknown that death would so soon have withdrawn her from my arms!\r\n\r\n“I should then have lost eleven years of a life such as angels only lead;\r\nbut I would willingly have sacrificed these happiest years of my earthly\r\nlife. Then I felt as secure from such thoughts of death as if I were to\r\nretain her forever! but she left thee and her relatives in tears, and\r\nher peerless heart impelled her to ask my pardon for these very tears.\r\nOf this nature were all her imperfections. What happiness did I not\r\nanticipate in the future on the revelation of such tender sentiments; and\r\nthe realization was still greater than my expectation. Our days passed\r\naway in happiness and peace. Could this state of things last forever? It\r\nwas heaven upon earth, for me at least; for what can be preferred to this\r\nintimate association with a charming, joyous, tender, intelligent, and\r\nvirtuous woman? Exclusively to love! exclusively to be beloved!\r\n\r\n“Nature had endowed my friend with beauties of person and mind, by which\r\nshe could not fail to please. The first would immediately fascinate the\r\neye, the second preserved that fascination forever. Perhaps I ought\r\nonly to dwell upon the last as the fountains of her virtues. But it\r\nwould be ungrateful to be silent respecting the once visible half of\r\nthe charming whole, by which alone we learn to know the other invisible\r\nportion, causing virtuous thoughts to grow into virtuous deeds, and\r\nwithout which I can not even realize any picture of my beloved friend.\r\nShe was of noble form, pleasant and well formed. Her expression was\r\nexactly equivalent to its necessary power of pleasing. Her hair of dark\r\nyellow tint. Her forehead was prominent, which she herself regretted,\r\nbut which made her more beautiful in the eyes of others. Her brow never\r\nbetrayed pride or passion. Her eyes were bluish-gray—their expression\r\nwas attentive and watchful, but joyous. Her heart was light, mild, and\r\never open, and ever performed what her eye promised. Her nose was very\r\nhandsome, somewhat high in the centre, but not to the extent visible in\r\nambitious or passionate women. Her cheeks were breathed upon by the happy\r\nbloom of health, and the still more lovely blush of shame readily rose.\r\nHer mouth, which never gave an untrue kiss, which never uttered a word of\r\nvanity, of slander, or of lust, displayed handsome, well-arranged teeth,\r\nand balmy lips. The gentle smile of this mouth, the seat of innocence,\r\nhow soon, alas! was it to pass away! The outlines of the lower part of\r\nthe face were soft, the chin well formed. The profile was artistic,\r\nand so excellent that a famous Berlin painter desired to sketch it for\r\nthat alone. Her manners manifested a noble freedom, neatness, and good\r\ntaste.”[18]\r\n\r\nThus does Bismarck’s grandfather depict his wife. There certainly is much\r\nof the sentimentality of the times in these characteristic sentences, but\r\nthere is more—true affection and a cultivated sense. It evinces a well of\r\npoesy in the individual, that we grieve to find these thoughts clothed in\r\nthe choicest French. The poet in him is then first justified when these\r\nperiods are re-translated into German, for that they were thought in\r\nGerman is not to be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe four sons of Charles Alexander are:—Ernst Frederick Alexander, born\r\nthe 14th of February, 1763; died a Colonel and Brigadier in 1813; his\r\neldest son by a marriage with Louise von Miltitz is Theodore Alexander\r\nFrederick Philip von Bismarck, created Count Bismarck-Bohlen, the 21st\r\nof February, 1818. He is the second Bismarck of Schönhausen who gained\r\nthe rank of Count; for the General Frederick von Bismarck, who obtained\r\na similar dignity in the same year and month (the 17th February, 1818),\r\nfrom the King of Würtemberg, was also a Schönhausen. His line still\r\nendures in one son, while the title was also ceded to the descendants of\r\nhis elder brother, the present Count von Bismarck-Schierstein.\r\n\r\nThe second son of Charles Alexander was Frederick Adolf Ludwig, born the\r\n1st of August, 1766; he died in 1831, a retired Lieut.-General. In 1813\r\nhe was Commandant of Leipzig, in 1814 of Stettin, and owned the knight’s\r\nfee and estate of Templin, near Potsdam.\r\n\r\nThe third was Philip Ludwig Leopold Frederick, born the 21st February,\r\n1770, a Major in the Mecklenburg Hussar Regiment; he died on the 25th\r\nOctober, 1813, at Halle on the Saale, of his wounds received at the\r\nbattle of Möckern.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last, Charles William Ferdinand, was the father of the\r\npresent Minister-President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nARMORIAL BEARINGS.\r\n\r\n    Up with the banner in the morning air!\r\n    Raise high the ancestral shield up there!\r\n    For these loved symbols bid us know\r\n    That joyfully we van-ward go!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe shield of the Bismarcks exhibits a device, which, although it has not\r\nmaterially changed in the course of centuries, has at different times\r\nbeen variously blazoned. It displays a double trefoil, or, more exactly\r\nspeaking, a round-leafed trefoil, flanked in its corners by three long\r\nleaves. The centre device has altered in the seals of various times,\r\nsometimes resembling a rose leaf, sometimes a clover leaf; finally it has\r\nremained a clover leaf. The other trefoil has been treated in the same\r\nway, the leaf being sharply serrated and shorter, or sometimes longer and\r\nbut slightly serrated, finally becoming an oak leaf. The colors have also\r\nonly been decided in later years. The shield is thus described:—\r\n\r\n“In a field azure a golden clover leaf supported in the three angles\r\nby three silver oak leaves.” As to the crest, the arms of Ludolf von\r\nBismarck exhibit two stags’ antlers on the helmet, evidently alluding\r\nto his official position as Ranger to the Margrave, for the buffalo\r\nhorns now in use also often appear at a very early period. The present\r\nemblazoning of the crest is thus given:—“On a coronetted helmet displayed\r\ntwo buffalo horns proper in azure and argent crosswise—the helmet is\r\nazure and argent.”\r\n\r\nThe small gold coronet, which, contrary to every rule of good heraldry,\r\nis represented hovering between the horns, is a more recent addition. We\r\nare unable to decide when and how this coronet became part of the crest.\r\nBrüggemann, in his description of Pomerania, describes it as a Count’s\r\ncoronet—for what reason we do not perceive.\r\n\r\nOn inspection of the earliest seals it is evident that the round trefoil\r\nwas unquestionably the peculiar and original device, the elongated\r\nleaves having been subsequently added, disputing precedence with the\r\nclover leaf. Thus it is that afterwards we find the oak leaves small and\r\nthe centre trefoil large—and contrariwise. If the clover be regarded\r\nas the principal device, it would be more heraldically true, as it is\r\nalways emblazoned in gold, to blazon the horns in azure and or. Indeed,\r\nthe heraldic ensigns of the Prussian Monarchy (Vol. I. p. 19) give the\r\ncorrect crest of the Bismarcks in the Armorial Bearings of the Counts of\r\nBismarck-Bohlen.\r\n\r\nThe seal of the first Nicholas von Bismarck (1365) displays the device\r\nin a neat border, with a string of pearls within the inscription.\r\nThis inscription, no longer very legible, is _S. (Sigillum) Nicolay\r\nde Bismark_. This border disappears on the seals of his three sons:\r\nthe shield lies within a string of pearls on a field strewn with small\r\ncrosses. In all these seals the trefoil is prominent, but in the seals\r\nof succeeding generations it becomes very small, the long leaves being\r\nprominent, until by lapse of time they assumed proportionate dimensions.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle and unheraldic to endeavor to identify symbols deriving\r\ntheir names from the botanical world, hence it would be useless to\r\ndefine the long leaves in the Bismarck arms as those of the Wegedorn,\r\nChrist-thorn, or White Bramble. This has, however, been done in support\r\nof the extraction of the Bismarcks from the Slavonic race—to identify it\r\nwith _Bij smarku_ (Beware of the Bramble), an idea which we must dismiss\r\nas entirely erroneous. The legends only recognize the clover leaf, and\r\ncall the long leaves those of the nettle. In popular tradition these two\r\nideas have become intermingled, as a proverb shows which was engraven on\r\nthe blade of a sword of honor presented to Count Bismarck some years ago.\r\nThis proverb is:—\r\n\r\n    Der Wegekraut sollst stehen lah’n—\r\n    Hüt dich, Junge, sind Nesseln d’ran.\r\n\r\nAnglicé.[19]\r\n\r\n    The bramble thou shouldst let ’a be;\r\n    The nettle, boy, beneath you’ll see.\r\n\r\nThe round leaves were here supposed to be bramble (_plantago_); the\r\nserrated long leaves, leaves of the nettle.\r\n\r\nWe find the legend of the arms in the third volume of the _Berlin Review_\r\nof 1856, afterwards reprinted in Hesekiel’s _Wappen Sagen_, Berlin, 1865,\r\nas follows:[20]—\r\n\r\n    The leaf so green and goodly,\r\n      The wanderer’s delight,\r\n    In purest gold so shiny,\r\n      The Bismarck’s coat bedight—\r\n    The cloven leaf lights golden\r\n      All on an azure field,\r\n    With nettle leaves so olden,\r\n      Sharp shown upon the shield.\r\n    In ancient days departed,\r\n      There was a dainty maid,\r\n    By whom the nettle signet\r\n      Was on this shield displayed.\r\n    For damsel Gertrude many\r\n      A suitor came to woo,\r\n    But her father not with any\r\n      Save her cousin willed to do.\r\n    A Wendic chief so princely\r\n      Came down from northern sea;\r\n    A hundred horses with him\r\n      Pranced pricking o’er the lea.\r\n    Young Gertrude he demanded,\r\n      But Gertrude, all politely,\r\n    Made little courtesy candid—\r\n      Despite his carriage knightly,\r\n    She would have naught of he.\r\n\r\n    The Prince, incensèd highly,\r\n      Upraised his golden wand;\r\n    He called his knaves assembled,\r\n      Around him they did stand.\r\n    In angry tones he shouted—\r\n      “The trefoil bruised shall be;\r\n    Not thus will I be flouted!\r\n      The nettle fain I’d see.\r\n    ’Twere merry to be breaking\r\n      The trefoil green or gold,\r\n    And havoc to be making\r\n      Amidst these halls so old!”\r\n    And in that self-same hour,\r\n      This Prince of Wendic race\r\n    Assaulted Gertrude’s bower,\r\n      The trefoil to displace.\r\n    The castellan, o’erpowered,\r\n      Sank silent in the moat;\r\n    The chieftain so o’er froward\r\n      His way then onward smote.\r\n\r\n    Rejoicing in his valor\r\n      The Prince came clanking in,\r\n    But Gertrude showed no pallor,\r\n      Despite the battle’s din.\r\n    “I’ll cull the trefoil golden\r\n      That hath no nettle’s sting,\r\n    The trefoil quaint and olden—”\r\n      “Thou shalt not do this thing!”\r\n    He to his arms would take her,\r\n      And lovingly embrace;\r\n    No courage did forsake her:\r\n      He quickly shouted “Grace!”\r\n    Down in his blood before her,\r\n      He sank in sudden death—\r\n    Proud as the race that bore her,\r\n      She stabbed with bated breath;\r\n    And once and twice she smote him,\r\n      And buried deep the steel.\r\n    ’Twas thus she could devote him\r\n      The nettle’s sting to feel—\r\n    “Who dares to cull the trefoil\r\n      The nettle’s sting shall feel!”\r\n\r\n    And since young Gertrude’s hour,\r\n      On Bismarck’s shield displayed,\r\n    The nettle’s stinging power\r\n      Round trefoil is arrayed.\r\n    With steel of keenest temper,\r\n      Their virtue is upheld,\r\n    Since early days of Gertrude,\r\n      Those early days of eld!\r\n\r\nAccording to another and still more simple legend, the Bismarcks added\r\nthe oak leaves to their arms on the occasion of one of their race\r\nconquering a Wendic chief, whose device contained such a leaf, or three\r\nsuch leaves. We do not lay any stress, and with justice, on the presumed\r\nimportance of such traditions, so common in the last century; still\r\nwe should not like to see them altogether thrown aside as trifling.\r\nEvery legend contains some kernel of truth, however small. Thus it does\r\nnot seem unimportant that the Bismarcks are continually represented\r\nas combatting the heathen Wends. There is certainly nothing proved by\r\nit, but it would never have arisen had not this family belonged to the\r\nfollowers of some German prince, who had established himself in the\r\nfrontier Marks on the Elbe, and waged unceasing war thence against the\r\nSlavonic tribes existing between that river and the Oder.\r\n\r\nThrice in this century has the dignity of Count been conferred on the\r\nBismarcks of Schönhausen; we now therefore possess Prussian Counts\r\nof Bismarck-Bohlen, Würtemberg Counts of Bismarck, the first line of\r\nwhich call themselves Counts of Bismarck-Schierstein, and the second\r\nline only Counts von Bismarck; finally, we have Prussian Counts of\r\nBismarck-Schönhausen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK’S FATHER.\r\n\r\n(Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck.)]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Prussian Counts of Bismarck-Bohlen are thus given:—The\r\nshield is bordered or and quartered, the first and fourth fields azure,\r\ndisplaying a trefoil or surrounded by three oak leaves argent (Bismarck);\r\nin the second and third field a griffin gules on a roof-tree formed of\r\nfive stones gules in steps (Bohlen). The Bismarck crest is crowned and\r\nsurmounted by two buffalo horns emblazoned azure and or crosswise, with\r\na small gold crown between the horns; the helmet trappings are azure and\r\nor. The centre (Bohlen) crest is crowned and supported by two uncrowned\r\ngriffins gules regardant on a trunk of a tree; the helmet trappings are\r\nazure and gules. The crowned crest to the left displays three ostrich\r\nfeathers, the centre one sable, the others white; each ostrich feather\r\nbears a diamond argent (perhaps for Schiverni); the helmet trappings\r\ngules and argent. Between the shield and crest is the Count’s coronet.\r\nSupporters, two crowned griffins gules regardant.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Würtemberg Counts of Bismarck-Schierstein (called the\r\nfirst or Nassau line, their family estate of Schierstein lying in Nassau)\r\nare as follows:—The quartered shield displays, in the first and fourth\r\nfields, azure a trefoil or, with three oak leaves argent at the corners;\r\nin the second field, gules a lion or passant; in the third, gules a horse\r\nargent fresnée. On the crest, coronetted, two buffalo horns of azure and\r\nargent crosswise, between which is a coronet or. The helmet trappings to\r\nthe right are azure and or, to the left azure and argent. Supporters,\r\nto the right a horse argent, to the left a lion or. Motto, “Einig und\r\ntreu”—“United and true.”\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Würtemberg Counts of Bismarck of the second line\r\n(described according to the Gotha Calendar) are as follows:—The quartered\r\nshield displays in the first and fourth fields, azure a trefoil argent;\r\nin the second field, also azure (? gules) a horse argent fresnée; in the\r\nthird field azure (? gules) a lion or rampant. The crest, coronetted,\r\ndisplays a pair of horns argent and azure, between which is placed a\r\ntrefoil (? argent). The helmet trappings to the right are azure and\r\nargent, to the left azure and or. Supporters, to the right a horse\r\nargent, to the left a lion or.\r\n\r\nIf this blazon be correct, the shield no longer displays the ancient\r\ndevice of the Bismarcks—the double trefoil. Either there has been some\r\nerror in the raising of the armorial bearings, or the original symbol has\r\nbeen advisedly adopted.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Prussian Counts von Bismarck-Schönhausen (the\r\nMinister-President and his heirs) are thus blazoned:—The shield,\r\nbordered or, displays on a field azure a trefoil or, surrounded with oak\r\nleaves argent; on the coronetted helm two buffalo horns of azure and\r\nargent crosswise, with a coronet argent between them. The simple family\r\narms of the Bismarcks have thus been retained on his elevation to the\r\nrank of Count, the shield under the crest having been surmounted by the\r\nCount’s coronet. The arms are improved by two eagles as supporters, the\r\none sable and crowned being the Prussian royal eagle, the left gules,\r\nwith the electoral cap, the eagle of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nAnother addition is that of the motto, “In Trinitate Robur”—“My strength\r\nin the Trinity.” This is a motto devised upon correct rules, as it should\r\nalways bear a double meaning—one referring to the double trinity of the\r\ntrefoils, the other allied to the higher signification of the Trinity of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BISMARCK’S BIRTHPLACE.\r\n\r\n    Genthin.—The Plotho Family.—Jerichow.—Fischbeck.—The\r\n    Kaiserburg.—The Emperor Charles IV.—The Elector\r\n    Joachim Nestor.—Frederick I.—General Fransecky “to the\r\n    Front.”—Tangermünde.—Town-hall.—Count Bismarck.—His Uniform,\r\n    and the South German Deputy.—Departure for Schönhausen.\r\n\r\n[The translator has abridged the following chapters and transferred\r\nthem to a place apparently better fitted for them than that they\r\noccupy in the German edition, but nothing of importance is omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenthin is an ancient place, owing its foundation during the twelfth\r\ncentury to the noble Lords of Plotho, whose ancestral mansion,\r\nAlten-Plotho, lies close to the town. At the present time the head of\r\nthis family, who is invested with the dignity of Hereditary Chamberlain\r\nof the Duchy of Magdeburg, resides at the Castle of Parey, on the Elbe.\r\nThe noble family of Plotho shares with that of the Gänse of Putlitz the\r\ndistinction of being the only race still flourishing, the origin of\r\nwhich can be traced to the Wendic princes and family chieftains. It is\r\nprobable that they were early converted to Christianity, and thence were\r\nenabled to retain some attributes of their Wendic nobility, and assert\r\nsome few privileges in the presence of the Teutonic knightly aristocracy,\r\ngradually thronging forward into the Marks with their feudal retainers.\r\nThe Plothos and the Putlitzs hence are called noblemen (_Edle Herrn_,\r\n_nobiles viri_), at a time when the designation was usually only applied\r\nto dynasties. In early records they are always named in precedence of the\r\nmembers of the ancient chivalric races. They had vassals of noble blood,\r\nand, up to the most recent period, held their own court at the Manor of\r\nParey. The features of that Freiherr von Plotho who so energetically\r\nrepelled the Imperial Ban, in his capacity as Electoral Brandenburg\r\nAmbassador, at the Imperial Diet in Ratisbon, which the Imperial notary,\r\nDoctor April, endeavored to force upon him against Frederick the Great,\r\nare well known and popular. The best portrait of this remarkable\r\npersonage has been drawn by Goethe, in his “Fiction and Truth.”[21] It\r\nis not so generally known that a branch of this Wendic family has also\r\nestablished itself in Belgium. The enormous possessions of the Barony of\r\nEngelsmünster, in Flanders, were first alienated from that family amidst\r\nthe storms of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of a somewhat chilly June day that we drove\r\ninto the green pastures of Jerichow. The fragrance of lime-blossoms and\r\nhay saluted our nostrils. The eye was gratified by well-kept fields,\r\npleasantly alternating with plough-land and meadow; the heath, with its\r\nthorn bushes, chiefly surrounded by strips of brushwood, smiled before us.\r\n\r\nThe first place at which we arrived was Redekin, with the simple mansion\r\nof the Alvensleben family—its tall poplars, and its neighboring venerable\r\nchurch with the bronze figure of Christ. Next came Jerichow, the small\r\ncity which gives its name to two counties. This pretty little town has\r\ntwo churches, and welcomed us cheerfully with its group of fine old\r\nelms and fragrant rose-trees. The church at the entrance has nothing\r\nremarkable about it, but the other at the end of the town is very\r\ncurious, as one of the earliest specimens of pure Gothic style in these\r\nparts. This possesses a crypt.\r\n\r\nClose behind Jerichow on the left, a landmark, the handsome Kaiser-house\r\nof Tangermünde, is visible.\r\n\r\nAt our next stage, the fine village of Fischbeck, we were already upon\r\nancient Bismarckian soil; we did not, however, drive farther in the\r\ndirection of Schönhausen, close by, but turned to the left towards the\r\nElbe, on the other bank of which Tangermünde, with its imperial castle,\r\ntall towers, walls, and turrets, forming a well-preserved piece of\r\nmediæval architecture, presented itself to our view in the last golden\r\nrays of the evening sun.\r\n\r\nWe slowly crossed the broad expanse of the Elbe in a ponderous\r\nferry-boat, and went up to the castle built by the Emperor Charles\r\nIV., that acute and politic King of Bohemia, as a metropolis for the\r\ngreat realm which extended from the North Sea and the Baltic as far as\r\nHungary, and in which he designed to found the power of his family—a\r\nrealm destined to fall to pieces under his sons.\r\n\r\nAt the castle we did not, of course, find the old lime-tree of justice,\r\nat which appeals used to be made from the gate of the old Brandenburg\r\nbridge. The gate and the tree have both disappeared, but on entering the\r\ncastle-yard by the massive gate-tower, we had the venerable ruins of the\r\nancient pile before us; on the left the tower, on the right the chapel,\r\nsmothered in festoons of blooming roses. The castle itself, in which the\r\npowerful emperor once lived—where the magnificent Elector Joachim Nestor\r\nheld his joyous wedding-feast with the beautiful Princess Elizabeth of\r\nDenmark, and where he breathed out the last breath of his noble life,\r\nafter many bitter disappointments—exists no longer. The sheriff’s office,\r\nwhich stands on the site of the castle, was built by King Frederick I.\r\nbefore he was king. His F., with the electoral cap and the Roman numerals\r\nIII., is still to be seen on the ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe old Kaiserburg is now inhabited by a retired officer of cavalry,\r\nwho was then entertaining a visitor, General von Fransecky, known since\r\nthe battle of Sadowa as “Fransecky Vor”—“Fransecky to the Front.” This\r\nhero of the fight had come thither to inspect the fourth squadron of the\r\nWestphalian Dragoons, lying in garrison at Tangermünde; hence on this\r\nevening the old castle was full of gay feminine toilettes and brilliant\r\nuniforms. Charles IV., educated at the French court and in Italy, here\r\nat one time instructed the rude squires of the Mark in his courtly and\r\nchivalrous code of manners towards ladies. The first assemblies in which\r\nboth sexes intermingled took place at Tangermünde. Until that time in\r\nthese regions men and women had sought their amusements separately, and\r\nhence knew nothing of real society.\r\n\r\nThe old Emperor would certainly have enjoyed the pleasant picture of\r\ncheerful sociability presented this evening in the lovely gardens between\r\nhis chapel and tower.\r\n\r\nNext morning we visited the remarkable town-hall and the handsome church\r\nof the ancient city. Such town-halls and churches no communities or\r\ncities as large as Tangermünde build at the present day. We are wanting\r\nin that sense of public spirit, and prefer small separate houses, and\r\ndevote no proud and extensive structures to the use of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun was shining brightly on the old city, and the Sunday\r\nbells were tolling as we passed back across the Elbe. A group of children\r\nbathing enlivened the strand below the gray tower. Two officers brought\r\ntheir fine horses across in the ferry-boat; one of these belonged to the\r\nWestphalian Dragoons, the other wore the yellow collar and cap-stripe\r\nof the Seventh Heavy Militia Cavalry, the colonel of which is General\r\nCount Bismarck. It is well known that Count Bismarck habitually wears\r\nthe uniform of his regiment, and a South German Deputy to the Diet did\r\nnot omit to stigmatize the yellow token of the uniform of the Chancellor\r\nof the Diet as very ominous. The excellent and reverend gentleman saw in\r\nthe sulphurous collar of Bismarck a piece of the uniform of a prince as\r\ndifferent from our noble King William as could possibly be.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the landing-place, we took a long last look at Tangermünde,\r\nbefore entering the carriage which was to convey us to Schönhausen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSCHÖNHAUSEN.\r\n\r\n    The Kattenwinkel.—Wust.—Lieutenant Von Katte.—Schönhausen.—Its\r\n    History.—The Church.—Bishop Siegobodo.—Bismarck’s\r\n    Mansion.—Interior.—Bismarck’s Mother.—Bismarck’s\r\n    Birth-Chamber.—The Library.—Bismarck’s Youthful\r\n    Studies.—Bismarck’s Maternal Grandmother.—The Countess with the\r\n    Dowry.—Ghost Stories.—Anecdote of a Ghost.—The Cellar Door.—The\r\n    French at Schönhausen.—The Templars.—The Park.—The Wounded\r\n    Hercules.—The Pavilion.—Two Graves.—The Orangery.—The Knight’s\r\n    Demesne.—Departure from Schönhausen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Fischbeck for Schönhausen there is on the right the\r\nKattenwinkel, or Kattenland. By this we are not reminded of the old\r\nTeutonic tribe of the Catte, of whose relations towards the Cherusci\r\nwe know very little, but of the old and chivalrous race of Katte,\r\nestablished in this region for the last five hundred years. Almost all\r\nthe villages whose church spires we see or do not see, in the corner\r\nbetween the Havel and the Elbe, belonged or still belong to the family\r\nVon Katte.\r\n\r\nAmong these villages is Wust. In the church of that place are buried the\r\nremains of that Katte, whose friendship for Frederick the Great ended\r\nin the tragedy of Küstrin.[22] There is something fantastic, and at\r\nthe same time touching, in the fact, that, as well as the skull of the\r\nexecuted John Hermann von Katte, the periwig trimmed with blue lace, and\r\nworn by him, has been preserved in the family vault at Wust. The Katte\r\nfamily[23] was very numerous, and in this district there is scarcely\r\na church or family mansion which does not bear its canting heraldic\r\ncoat of arms. By marriages, also, the azure shield, with the white cat\r\nbearing the mouse in its mouth, has spread in all directions. It is\r\nimpossible to contemplate the armorial bearings of the Kattes without\r\nthinking of the beheaded friend of the great Frederick. Just as the cat,\r\nin the coat of arms, plays cruelly with the mouse, did the furious King\r\nFrederick William play with him. It is a milder trait in the tragedy of\r\nKüstrin, that the angry King endeavored in his peculiar way to comfort\r\nJohn Hermann’s father, as well as his grandfather, Field-Marshal Count\r\nWartensleben, for the terrible fate of their son and grandson. Frederick\r\nWilliam I. was an angry and almost coarsely-severe monarch, but there\r\nwas nothing of the Oriental despot about him, and, to do him justice,\r\nhis native benevolence and Christian conscientiousness must not be\r\noverlooked. Oriental despots were not, however, then confined to the\r\nOrient. The general character of King Frederick William the Severe bears\r\na favorable contrast with those of the other rulers of his time.\r\n\r\nAs we drove into Schönhausen, the church bell was ringing; but it did not\r\ngive a clear sound, but appeared dull. The bell of the prettiest village\r\nchurch between the Havel and the Elbe is cracked, and will probably soon\r\nbe recast; but we can not deny that the very dullness of its sound,\r\namidst the sunlight and blossoms of the well-wooded roadway, had a\r\npeculiar effect upon the mind.\r\n\r\nSchönhausen is an ancient place, and, like all this portion of the\r\ncircle of Jerichow, was originally ecclesiastical property. It formed\r\npart of the endowment granted in 946 by Emperor Otto I. to the bishopric\r\nof Havelberg, founded by him. This grant of Otto’s, in course of time,\r\nwas considerably divided; Schönhausen and Fischbeck, however, remained\r\nattached to the cathedral of Havelberg as maintenance of the bishopric.\r\nUntil the fifteenth century Schönhausen was an ordinary village, governed\r\nby a bailiff. But during the bishopric of John von Schlabrendorf, who\r\noccupied the episcopal throne during the peaceful period between 1501 and\r\n1520, the place greatly improved, and made some progress towards becoming\r\na township. In an acknowledgment, still extant, of the year 1547, the\r\nreceipt runs thus: “Received of the worshipful magistrates and sheriffs\r\nof the borough of Schönhausen.” The place had therefore become a\r\nborough. The bounds of this borough were very considerable, for, besides\r\nthe forest-land, they comprehended more than 20,000 acres of arable land.\r\nHence it ensued that Schönhausen, down to recent times, always reckoned\r\nmore inhabitants than the neighboring township of Jerichow. As, however,\r\nthere no longer existed any bishops of Havelberg as its protectors,\r\nSchönhausen was unable to maintain its rank as a borough, although time\r\nhas not effaced all similarity in the place to a town or market-place.\r\nSchönhausen suffered greatly in the Thirty Years’ War, alternately from\r\nthe Swedes and the Imperial forces; and of forty-eight farms only one\r\nremained. In 1642 the manor-house was plundered and burnt; and in 1651\r\nthe whole district was visited by a severe inundation. For many years\r\nthere was no pastor attached to the church, until the Bismarcks summoned,\r\nin 1650, the Rev. Adam Winkler from Grosswulkow.\r\n\r\nThe church and the manor-house are situated close together upon an\r\neminence, and from the churchyard there is a fine view. This venerable\r\nsanctuary was consecrated on the 7th of November, 1212, and built by\r\nBishop Siegobodo of Havelberg, at the beginning of his episcopate, he\r\nbeing one of the first spiritual shepherds who busied himself in the\r\nestablishment of Christianity in this neighborhood. Its patron saints\r\nwere the Virgin and the martyr Willebrod. In order to increase the\r\nsanctity of this church, which, from the rarity of churches at that\r\ntime, was frequented by the inhabitants of an extensive district, a\r\nrich collection of relics was established there. Among these were\r\nrelics of the holy martyr of Thebes, of the martyr Sebastian, of Bishop\r\nConstantine, of the Abbot Ægidius, of St. Alban, and others. These were\r\ndiscovered on the repair of the altar in 1712, contained in a sealed\r\ncasket, together with an original record by Bishop Siegobodo as to the\r\nconsecration of the church and the deposit of the relics. The church\r\nof Schönhausen is the largest, handsomest, and most perfect village\r\nchurch in the whole district—its shape in grand simplicity is that of a\r\ntri-naved basilica. Its origin from the Havelberg bishops is also shown\r\nby the broad tower transept, the cathedral of Havelberg having been the\r\npattern of all churches in the vicinity. The Landrath August von Bismarck\r\nespecially promoted the interior decorations of the church; he also,\r\nin great measure, restored the manor-house. He presented the handsomely\r\ncarved pulpit and staircase in the centre, as well as the splendid and\r\nrichly carved oak dais opposite the pulpit. He also set up the altar and\r\naltar-piece. To his parents he erected a memorial with oval portraits;\r\nthe costume of the pictures is that of the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. His own mural inscription, erected by his son, is at a little\r\ndistance, but it is far inferior in execution. Under these memorial\r\ntablets is placed, in a style of the utmost simplicity, that of the\r\nmother of our Minister-President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mansion of the Bismarcks is close to the church. It is entered by\r\na gateway with walled railings, having to its left the farm building,\r\nand in front of it a tall and handsome lime-tree, which, as it were,\r\nmarks the boundary between the offices and the special courtyard of the\r\nmansion. At a few paces from the lime stands a sandstone vase, and we\r\nthen find ourselves in front of the house where Bismarck was born.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is a plain, massive, quadrangular building of the last few years of\r\nthe seventeenth century, the enormous foundation-walls of which date from\r\nthe early castle first inhabited by the Bismarcks: this was ravaged and\r\nburnt during the Thirty Years’ War. The house is in two stories, with\r\na high roof. On the right a wing is built out, extending as far as a\r\nsandstone vase. The park begins on the left with magnificent alleys of\r\nchestnuts and limes.\r\n\r\nThe doorway is as simple as the house, without steps or porch. The shield\r\nabove it bears on the right the arms of the Bismarcks, and on the left\r\nthose of the Kattes—the cat with the mouse. The inscription to the right\r\nis August von Bismarck, that on the left is Dorothea Sophia Katte, anno\r\n1700.\r\n\r\nRound the corner, by a door leading to the garden, the house can be\r\nentered through a handsome and spacious garden saloon. The ceiling of\r\nthis room is decorated with the armorial bearings.\r\n\r\nThis ground-floor leads into a large hall, whence there is a heavy,\r\nbroad, and dark staircase to the upper rooms. The next room is the\r\ncomparatively low-ceilinged dining-room, hung with white tapestry; and\r\nhere we also found the ceiling borders and the two fireplaces richly\r\nornamented with carving. On the side-tables stand busts of Frederick\r\nWilliam III. and Frederick William IV., the latter as Crown Prince. The\r\nfurniture is plain.\r\n\r\nFrom the dining-room the door to the left leads into two handsome\r\nreception-rooms, the one ornamented with oil paintings, the other\r\ndecorated in the Japanese style. Here are, in the corners, casts of\r\nKiss’s Amazon, and Rauch’s Walburga riding on the stag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo the right of the dining-room is situated the sitting-room of Countess\r\nBismarck, tapestried in green. The pictures and lithographs are of\r\nthe time of Frederick William III., and over the chimney-piece is the\r\nmedallion portrait of a woman, probably an antique beauty. The principal\r\nobject in this room is the portrait of the Minister-President’s mother.\r\n\r\nFarther on again to the right we enter the bed-chamber; in yonder\r\nalcove, now divided from the room by a red curtain, Otto von Bismarck was\r\nborn, on the 1st of April, 1815. In this alcove his cradle stood, but it\r\nis now only occupied by the bed in which his father died.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple apartment, presenting a comfortable and cosy aspect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third door in the background of the green sitting-room leads to the\r\nlibrary, a spacious chamber painted red, having in the centre a ponderous\r\nand broad table. The books are contained in two bookcases. The collection\r\nis not inconsiderable in number, but their arrangement is confused.\r\n\r\nIt was worth while to cast a glance into the book-shelves, and see what\r\nbooks were studied by Count Bismarck in his youth. In one of the cases we\r\nfound honest old Zedler’s voluminous Universal Lexicon of the Sciences\r\nand Arts; next to it the extensive collection, “Theatrum Europæum,” still\r\nan indispensable companion; a General History of Germany, a Universal\r\nHistory, both written in the pedantic tone of the last century; Gledow’s\r\n“History of the Empire;” a historical Labyrinth of Time, and Ludwig\r\nGottfried’s “Historical Chronicle of the Four Monarchies.” Theology was\r\nrepresented by Dr. Martin Luther’s German writings. Next to a collection\r\nof old travels, stood a Political and News Lexicon, with Busching’s\r\n“Geography.” The other bookcase, in its upper shelves, appears dedicated\r\nto the Belles Lettres. Voltaire and the Letters of Count von Bussy stood\r\npeacefully beside Frederick von Schlegel’s works and Leopold Schefer’s\r\n“Lay Breviary;” next to Basedow’s “Introduction” was lying Herschel’s\r\n“Popular Astronomy.”\r\n\r\nTurning from the books to the pictures, we find them of special interest,\r\nas they chiefly depict members of the family. A couple of portraits of\r\nBismarck’s only sister when very young, evidence some remote likeness to\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo portrait of the Minister-President himself anywhere exists in the\r\nhouse. There was, however, one of his brother, the Royal Chamberlain,\r\nBernhard von Bismarck, of Külz, Provincial Councillor in the circle of\r\nNaugard—a youthful face, not much like the Minister-President. Count\r\nBismarck is also personally unlike his mother, although we can scarcely\r\ndoubt her influence over his mental qualities. We may mention among the\r\npictures a very interesting one of his maternal grandmother, and also one\r\nof his uncle General von Bismarck.\r\n\r\nBy chance we noticed, half-concealed by the enormous stove, the portrait\r\nof a lady. The original had scarcely been a beauty; her features were\r\nhard and unformed, though this might partly have been the painter’s\r\nfault. This picture had its little history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK’S ARMORIAL BEARINGS.]\r\n\r\nMadame Bellin, the housekeeper, told us that during the absence of\r\nBismarck’s father on a journey, she had found it in a loft, cleaned it,\r\nand brought it down to the library. She asked her master on his return\r\nwhose portrait it was, and learned that it was that of a young countess\r\nwho had in his youth been suggested to him as a wife, with a dowry of one\r\nhundred thousand thalers.[24] We could readily understand that Herr von\r\nBismarck found few charms in the picture, but the housekeeper, who was\r\nstruck with the dowry, exclaimed, “Ah! _gnädiger Herr_, I should have had\r\nher if she had possessed a hundred thousand thalers!” Bismarck’s father\r\nreplied, with a smile, “Well, you can have her yourself, if you like her\r\nso much.”\r\n\r\nIn those days people had a great deal of respect for a hundred thousand\r\nthalers, and such a sum of money was then respectfully called a ton of\r\nmoney. In our times a hundred thousand thalers form no great amount of\r\nwealth, although one does not instinctively put one’s hand in one’s\r\npocket to give the poor possessor a trifle by way of charity. At least,\r\nsuch was the expression of a well-known young nobleman lately, on\r\nspeaking of the difference in the times. However, the portrait of the\r\nyoung countess with the hundred thousand thalers has hung in the library\r\nbehind the stove at Schönhausen ever since.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the paternal mansion of Bismarck consists in its\r\nquadrangular form, its thick walls, its massive heavy staircase, the\r\ndepth and low pitch of its rooms, and the almost extravagant use of\r\nstucco on the ceilings, friezes, stoves, and panels. But the whole\r\nmansion impresses you with an air of comfort and homely solidity; there\r\nis a historical air of noble simplicity throughout the whole of the\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nSchönhausen would of course not be a correct dwelling-house for an\r\nancient family, if proper ghost stories did not pertain to it; and\r\nthe ancient structure does not look as if these were deficient. On\r\nthe contrary, there never was a house more like a haunted house than\r\nthis cradle of Bismarck’s. Those, indeed, who were able to tell of the\r\nghosts which flitted about the mansion are long since buried, and we\r\nwere obliged to content ourselves with a very poor remainder of these\r\ntraditions; but what is still preserved was quite sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe charm of terror in the ladies, at times guests at the mansion, if\r\nnot to arouse terror of a real kind, without any delightful sensation.\r\nThe library was especially “uncanny;” a faithful servant, who slept\r\nthere when the family was from home, often woke up in the night with a\r\ncold breath to disturb him; he perceived that there was a “something”\r\nunpleasantly close to him, and his usually fearless spirit was seized\r\nwith icy horror. It was by no means so unpleasant when the “something”\r\nevinced its presence in some more definite manner, as, for instance, when\r\nit came tramping up the oak staircase outside, or banged itself down with\r\na dull thud. The man who related this was not at all wanting in courage;\r\nhe knew that he was quite alone in the house; he always concluded it to\r\nbe thieves, but if he put out his hands they encountered nothing, and if\r\nhe went out from the room he found no one there. It is very easy to laugh\r\nat these things, but that is all of no use; the unexplained always has\r\nits terrors until some false or true solution of the enigma is found.\r\n\r\nOne night, Bismarck, before he was Minister, occupied the bedroom in\r\nwhich he was born; he had guests in the mansion—among others a certain\r\nHerr von Dewitz. The next day a hunting party was to take place, and\r\na servant had been instructed to awaken his master at an early hour.\r\nSuddenly Bismarck awoke; he heard the door of the library in the adjacent\r\nchamber open, and thought he perceived soft footsteps. He concluded\r\nit was the servant coming to awaken him. At that moment he heard Herr\r\nvon Dewitz exclaim, “Who’s there?” He sprang from the bed, the clock\r\nstruck twelve, and there was nobody to be seen. He had felt or heard\r\nsomething, as other persons had before him, which was susceptible of no\r\nexplanation. Another of the Bismarcks had also seen something; if we\r\nare not mistaken this was an uncle of the Minister’s, the General von\r\nBismarck, who died in 1881. He saw, certainly only in a dream, a fleeting\r\nwhite form that beckoned to him; he followed, and it led him down into\r\nthe cellar, the most ancient part of the building, and there showed him\r\na door in which there was cut an opening in the form of a heart. He\r\nthought from the motions of the apparition that it signified to him the\r\nexistence of a concealed treasure. This was, as already stated, all a\r\ndream, but the dream was so vivid, it made such an impression on him,\r\nthat on the next morning he examined the cellar closely; he found, hidden\r\nbehind rubbish and lumber, a little door with a heart-shaped opening in\r\nit, the existence of which was quite unsuspected by any of the members\r\nof the family. The door had now been found, but alas! no treasure was\r\ndiscovered, for the door only concealed a hidden passage leading into the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn the library door there are three deep cracks, commemorating the\r\npresence of evil spirits of any thing but a ghostly nature; they were\r\nFrench soldiers, who in 1806 pursued the young and lovely lady of the\r\nmansion, and endeavored to break down the door with their bayonets, when\r\nthe fugitive had locked it behind her. Bismarck’s father sheltered his\r\nwife from the attentions of the children of the “_grande nation_” in\r\nthe forest, but his ready money, among which was a considerable sum in\r\nlouis-d’ors, he buried under the solitary pavilion in the park island.\r\nHis astonishment was great, when, on his return, he found his treasure\r\ndisturbed, but not stolen, though the louis-d’ors were scattered about.\r\nNot the French, but the dogs, had discovered it, had scratched up the\r\nearth, and thrown the gold pieces contemptuously aside.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that Schönhausen had ever been in the possession of the\r\nSoldiers of the Holy Virgin—the Order of the Temple; but in the ghostly\r\nchronicles of the mansion the Knights Templars play a considerable part.\r\nTheir long white mantles with the red cross are certainly particularly\r\nadapted for this; but it is a sign of the deep impression made by\r\nthe sudden destruction of the mighty Order, upon the people of these\r\ndistricts, that in all mysterious narratives, all secret subterranean\r\npassages, treasure hoards, and similar circumstances, we find the\r\nTemplars with their long white cloaks occupying a conspicuous place. At\r\nthe same time, there is much avarice mingled with this, for the most\r\nextravagant traditions found credence as to the wealth of the Templars.\r\nBuried treasures of the Order were suspected everywhere, and the poor\r\nTemplars were doomed to guard the riches which they had accumulated\r\nduring their lives, as ghosts, forever.\r\n\r\nFrom the mansion we passed on to the upper terrace of the park, and\r\nwandered down the cool shady alley of limes, the branches of which bent\r\nto the ground, forming a verdant arbor of singular beauty. In this\r\nmagnificent spot the lord of the mansion often had the table spread for\r\nhimself and friends. The park is remarkably distinguished for fine rows\r\nof trees, both old and new, and the lime-tree seems ever to have been\r\nthe favorite tree of the Bismarcks of Schönhausen.\r\n\r\nOn the wall, separating the terrace from the park itself, there is\r\ngrowing a very handsome birch-tree, which appears to have been self-sown.\r\nIt has rooted itself deep into the stone, breaking down a portion of the\r\nwall, and now grows up amidst ruins and wreaths of roses, like the green\r\nflag of a victor.\r\n\r\nThe park is laid out according to the antique French style, with straight\r\nhedges, basins, and statues; but Nature has long since overcome the\r\ngarden shears of Lenotre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive from the lower park itself that the lord of\r\nthe manor is no longer present, and that the farm is leased. Between\r\nthe tall noble avenues and picturesque foliage, broad patches planted\r\nwith vegetables may be observed. This gives a homely, but scarcely a\r\nneglected, appearance to the place, as it does not destroy the general\r\nbeauty of the view.\r\n\r\nBy an avenue, adorned with really splendid limes, we reach a small\r\nbridge, leading across the mantled pool which divides the park from the\r\nfields. On this side is the cool shade of the limes; yonder in the\r\nsunshine is Indian corn and beet-root. By this bridge stands a statue\r\nof Hercules with its hand on its back, cut in sandstone, on the north\r\nside of which the Junker Otto Bismarck once fired off his rifle—the\r\nmarks of which musketry are still visible—and he ever afterwards used\r\nto assure his friends that Hercules put his hand there because the shot\r\nstill pained him! On one thigh, evidently by a later hand, some person\r\nhas written “Adam.” This person, obviously somewhat wanting in his\r\nknowledge of mythology, no doubt was led to the explanation by the very\r\nprimitive style of costume. But so long as the country side contents\r\nitself with such explanations, there is not much to be said against it.\r\nIt is somewhat more reprehensible to decapitate the gods, to provide a\r\nwhetstone for the scythe. This fate, however, a somewhat massive Flora\r\nhas had to undergo; and there it stands behind a thicket, apparently\r\nmourning the loss of its curly head.\r\n\r\nUpon a small artificial island in the park stands a lonesome pavilion in\r\nthe style of the Regent, half hidden by trees and overgrown with moss.\r\nThe poet might select it for the scene of the catastrophe of a romance.\r\nWe did not cross the wooden bridge, because our friendly guide warned us\r\nagainst the gnats which for a long time, in many sorts and sizes, have\r\nenjoyed their innocent lives in that locality.\r\n\r\nWe did, however, visit two solemn places in the park—two graves. In a\r\ndark shrubbery, grown quite wild, lies an elder brother of Bismarck,\r\ndeceased as a child. The cast-iron cross has evidently been erected over\r\nthe grave at a later time.\r\n\r\nAt the very remotest corner of the park, close by the sedgy shore, we\r\nfound the second grave. Here Captain von Bismarck, a cousin of the\r\nMinister, reposes. Above the last resting-place of the wearied soldier\r\nis another iron cross. This was the favorite spot of the old gentleman\r\nduring his lifetime; beneath the trees, on the banks which now watch\r\nover his grave, he used in summer time to muse every day over his quiet\r\nfishing-rod, or gaze dreamily across into the blooming meadows beyond the\r\nwater. At his express desire he was buried in this spot.\r\n\r\nBesides the six-and-twenty farms and subsidiary patches, there is also\r\nat Schönhausen a knight’s demesne (_Rittergut_), formerly likewise the\r\nproperty of the Bismarcks, but which had to be sold in time of need. It\r\nnow belongs to Dyke Captain Gaertner. It is related that the Minister\r\nwished to repurchase it, but Captain Gaertner, who did not wish to part\r\nwith the property, asked 150,000 thalers more than the value, upon which\r\nBismarck observed, “I would have given 50,000 thalers more than it was\r\nworth, but I can not agree to a larger sum.” This is only a popular tale,\r\nfor the truth of which we can not vouch.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of Schönhausen, we may be allowed to say that, in the\r\ngeneral picture of the place, we seem to recognize individual traits of\r\nthe man there born—or, rather, that the sight of Schönhausen has shown\r\nus features which point to cognate and similar facts in the outward\r\nappearance of Bismarck. It is difficult to express this in words, but the\r\nsentiment remains; and in this we need not appeal to posterity, as is the\r\ncustom of authors when they feel assured that they will be unintelligible\r\nto their readers, but rather to all those alike familiar with Bismarck\r\nand his estate of Schönhausen.\r\n\r\n    Be health and blessings ever near\r\n      The mansion old by woods surrounded,\r\n    The cradle, so to Prussia dear,\r\n      Of him who Germany refounded.\r\n    By strength of thought and weapon’s might\r\n    He conquered, striving for the right;\r\n    Peace to the house and hail the star\r\n    That Prussia’s glory beams afar!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Second.\r\n\r\nYOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL AND COLLEGE DAYS.\r\n\r\n    Bismarck’s Parents.—Brothers and Sisters.—Bismarck\r\n    Born.—Kniephof, Jarchelin, and Külz.—The Plamann\r\n    Institute.—The Frederick William Institute.—Residence in\r\n    Berlin.—Bismarck’s Father and Mother.—Letter of Count Bismarck\r\n    to his Sister.—Confirmation.—Dr. Bonnell.—Severity of the\r\n    Plamanns.—Holiday Time.—Colonel August Frederick von Bismarck\r\n    and the Wooden Donkey at Ihna Bridge.—School-life with Dr.\r\n    Bonnell.—The Cholera of 1831.—The Youthful Character and\r\n    Appearance of Bismarck.—Early Friends.—Proverbs.—“Far from\r\n    Sufficient!” quoth Bismarck.\r\n\r\n\r\nKarl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck, of Schönhausen, born on the 13th\r\nNovember, 1771, once belonging to the Body Guard (No. 11 in the old\r\nlist), who quitted the service as Captain, was married on the 7th of\r\nJuly, 1806, to Louise Wilhelmina Menken, born on the 24th of February,\r\n1790; died the 1st of January, 1889, at Berlin.\r\n\r\nFrau von Bismarck was an orphan daughter of the well-known Privy\r\nCouncillor, Anastatius Ludwig Menken, who had served with distinction\r\nunder three sovereigns of Prussia and possessed great influence during\r\nthe first years of the reign of Frederick William III. He was born\r\nat Helmstadt on the 2d of August, 1752, and was a member of a family\r\ndistinguished for its literary attainments. To a certain extent he was a\r\npupil of the Minister Count Herzberg,[25] by whose means he was appointed\r\nto a post in the Privy Chancery. Frederick the Great held him in great\r\nesteem, he having rendered an important service to his sister, the Queen\r\nLouise Ulrike, in Stockholm; and he employed him from the year 1782 in\r\nthe capacity of Secretary to the Cabinet for Foreign Affairs. From 1786\r\nhe became Privy Councillor to Frederick William II., and in that office\r\nwas again intrusted with the administration of foreign affairs, but after\r\nthe war with France was supplanted by General von Bischofswerder,[26]\r\nand retired into private life. Menken was the only adviser of King\r\nFrederick William II., who was recalled and reappointed at the accession\r\nof Frederick William III. He was the author of the well-known Cabinet\r\nOrder issued by Frederick William III., which insured the young King\r\nthe confidence of his subjects. Menken was no revolutionist, as\r\nBischofswerder and his partisans asserted, but to a certain extent he\r\nagreed with the principles of the first French National Convention. He\r\nis portrayed as a gentle, liberal, prudent, and experienced man, but of\r\ndelicate health; and he died on the 5th August, 1801, in consequence\r\nof illness brought on by a life of unintermitting labor. According to\r\nthe opinion of Stein, Menken was a person of generous sentiments, well\r\neducated, of fine feeling and benevolent disposition, with noble aims and\r\nprinciples. He desired the good of his native land, which he sought to\r\npromote by the diffusion of knowledge, the improvement of the condition\r\nof all classes, and the application of philanthropic ideas; but his\r\nindisposition for war at an important juncture was adverse to his fame;\r\nhis too eloquent and humane edict, and his singular gentleness of mind,\r\ninvested the Government with an appearance of weakness.\r\n\r\nHis orphan daughter became the mother of Count Bismarck. It is\r\ninteresting to note that a hundred years before a daughter of the same\r\nfamily, Christine Sybille Menken, deceased in 1750, as the wife of the\r\nImperial Equerry Peter Hohmann von Hohenthal, was the ancestress of the\r\nCount von Hohenthal of the elder line.\r\n\r\nThe brothers and sisters of Count Bismarck were:—\r\n\r\nI. Alexander Frederick Ferdinand, born 13th April, 1807; died 13th\r\nDecember, 1809.\r\n\r\nII. Louise Johanne, born 3d November, 1808; died 19th March, 1813.\r\n\r\nIII. Bernhard, born 24th June, 1810, Royal Chamberlain and Privy\r\nCouncillor, and Chief Justice of the Circle of Naugard, near Külz and\r\nJarchelin, in Pomerania.\r\n\r\nIV. Francis, born 20th June, 1819; died 10th September, 1822.\r\n\r\nV. Franziska Angelika Malwina, born the 29th June, 1827; wedded at\r\nSchönhausen on the 30th October, 1844, to Ernst Frederick Abraham Henry\r\nCharles Oscar von Arnim, of Kröchlendorff, Royal Chamberlain and a member\r\nof the Upper House.\r\n\r\nThe Minister-President himself, Otto Edward Leopold, was born at\r\nSchönhausen on the 1st April, 1815.\r\n\r\nHis earliest youth, however, was not passed at his ancestral estate in\r\nthe Alt Mark, but in Pomerania, whither his parents had removed in the\r\nyear 1816. By the decease of a cousin they had succeeded to the knightly\r\nestates of Kniephof, Jarchelin, and Külz, in the circle of Naugard. At\r\nKniephof, where his parents took up their residence, Bismarck passed\r\nthe first six years of his life, and to Kniephof he returned in his\r\nholidays from Berlin, so that this Pomeranian estate of his parents may\r\nbe regarded as the scene of his earliest sports.\r\n\r\nThese estates were held in fee from the Dewitz family, in the circle of\r\nPomerania, then known as the Daber and Dewitz circle, and were ceded\r\nwith the feudal rights to the Colonel August Frederick von Bismarck,\r\nthe great-grandfather of the Minister-President, on his marriage with\r\nStephanie von Dewitz. After the death of the Colonel, his three sons,\r\nBernd August, Charles Alexander (the Minister’s grandfather), and Ernst\r\nFrederick (Royal Conservator of Palaces) possessed these estates in\r\ncommon, until, on the partition of 12th August, 1747, they were handed\r\nover to Captain Bernd August alone. He bequeathed them to his son, the\r\nDeputy of the Daber-Naugard circle, and to Captain August Frederick von\r\nBismarck and his sister Charlotte Henrietta, who was married to Captain\r\nJaroslav Ulrich Frederick von Schwerin. By a deed dated the 7th of\r\nAugust, 1777, August Frederick became the sole possessor, and bequeathed\r\nthem to Charles William Frederick von Bismarck, the father of the\r\nMinister-President.\r\n\r\nThe knightly estate of Kniephof is about a (German) mile from Naugard to\r\nthe eastward; its situation is pleasant, being surrounded by woods and\r\nmeadows, close to the little river Zampel. Even in the last century the\r\nbeautiful gardens and carp-lake were famous.\r\n\r\nJarchelin, formerly called Grecholin, some quarter of a mile distant from\r\nKniephof, which is incorporated with the parish of the former place. A\r\nsmall stream runs through this village.\r\n\r\nKülz is nearer to Naugard; the church there was originally a dependency\r\nof Farbezin; formerly it possessed oak and pine forests, and the hamlet\r\nof Stowinkel was planted with oaks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1838, Captain von Bismarck ceded these estates to his two\r\nsons, who farmed them for three years in common, but then divided\r\nthem so that the elder, Bernhard, retained Külz, while the younger,\r\nthe Minister-President, took for his share Kniephof and Jarchelin.\r\nWhen, after his father’s decease in 1845, the Minister-President took\r\nSchönhausen, Jarchelin was surrendered to the elder brother. Kniephof\r\nwas retained by Count Bismarck until 1868, when, after the purchase of\r\nVarzin, it passed into the possession of his eldest nephew, Lieutenant\r\nPhilip von Bismarck.\r\n\r\nAs the possessor of Kniephof, the Minister sat till 1868 for the ancient\r\nand established fief of the Dukedom Stettin in the Upper Chamber. On its\r\ncession the King created him a member of that chamber for life. In the\r\nadjacent estate of Zimmerhausen, belonging to the Von Blanckenburgs,\r\nOtto von Bismarck was then and afterwards a frequent guest. The\r\nyouthful friendship which he then contracted with the present General\r\nCounty Councillor Moritz von Blanckenburg, a well-known leader of the\r\nConservative party in the Chamber of Deputies and at the Diet, remains\r\nunshaken to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRADLE.]\r\n\r\nAbout the Easter of 1821, Otto von Bismarck entered the then renowned\r\nschool of Professor Plamann, in Berlin (Wilhelmstrasse 130), where his\r\nonly surviving elder brother Bernhard then was. Bismarck remained in this\r\nplace till 1827, when he left it to pursue his more classical studies at\r\nthe Frederick William Gymnasium. He was there received into the lower\r\nthird class—his elder brother having by that time reached the second\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nHis parents were accustomed to pass the winter months in Berlin, and\r\nduring those times received both their sons at home, so that the boys\r\never retained feelings of relationship to the home circle, although not\r\nalways there.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1827 both brothers became chiefly residents at the Berlin\r\nestablishment of their parents, and were committed to the care of a\r\nfaithful servant, Trine Neumann, from Schönhausen, who still lives at the\r\nGesund-Brunnen, at Berlin, though she no longer wears the black and red\r\npetticoat of her native spot. Well qualified masters attended, especially\r\nduring the absence of the parents in the summer time. By their aid they\r\nbecame acquainted with several of the modern languages. Among these\r\ntutors, the first was M. Hagens in 1827, then a young Genevese, named\r\nGallot, and in the year 1829, a certain Dr. Winckelmann, unquestionably a\r\nclever philologist, but a man of no principle, who vanished one morning\r\nwith the cash-box, and left his charges behind with Trine Neumann. This\r\noccurred at the residence of the parents in Behrenstrasse No. 39; they\r\nafterwards resided at No. 52, in the same street, and subsequently on the\r\nDönhofsplatz. At this time Otto von Bismarck laid the foundation of his\r\nprowess in English and French, which he ulteriorly brought to perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that labor, care, or expense were not spared by the\r\nparents to foster the talents of these gifted children. This was,\r\nindeed, a special duty with their mother, a lady of great education, who\r\ncombined with many accomplishments the sentimental religious feeling of\r\nher period, and had inherited the liberal views of her father. Madame\r\nvon Bismarck was no doubt a distinguished woman, not only esteemed\r\nfor her beauty in society, but exercising considerable influence in\r\nsociety. Her activity, which zealously espoused modern ideas, was\r\nprobably less wanting in insight than in persistency, but from that\r\nvery cause operated unfavorably in the management of the estates. The\r\nconduct of agriculture suffered under numerous and costly institutions\r\nand experiments, reducing the family income to a considerable extent,\r\nespecially as the brilliant winter establishment in Berlin, and the\r\nsummer visits to watering-places, demanded extensive resources. She\r\nevidently sought at a very early age to awaken ambition in her sons; it\r\nwas particularly her desire that the younger son, Otto, should devote\r\nhimself to a diplomatic career, for which she considered him especially\r\nfitted, while the elder brother was from the first destined for the\r\ncommission of Provincial Councillor (_Landrath_). Both these aspirations\r\nwere fulfilled, but not in their mother’s lifetime; she had long died\r\nwhen her younger son entered on diplomatic life, but her maternal\r\ninstinct is honored by her early perception of the path by which Bismarck\r\nwas to attain the highest distinction. How often must Bismarck have\r\nthought of his mother’s heartfelt wish, in his position as ambassador in\r\nFrankfort, Petersburg, and Paris! How frequently his earliest friends\r\nmust have exclaimed, “Bismarck! had your mother only survived to see\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to the wise, ambitious, but somewhat haughty mother,\r\nhis father, a handsome, personable, and cheerful man, full of humor and\r\nwit, rather represented the heart and mind, without very great claims to\r\nstrong intellect, or even knowledge. Strangely enough, the cultivated and\r\nliterary Charles Alexander von Bismarck, transformed from a diplomatist\r\ninto a cavalry officer by the command of the Great Frederick, educated\r\nhis four sons for the army.\r\n\r\nThis cavalier, of French sentiments, who subscribed to Parisian journals,\r\nstill preserved at Schönhausen—a custom not usual with the aristocracy\r\nof the Marks—and who lived with great simplicity, but drank wine, and\r\nate off silver plate—brought up his sons like centaurs, and his greatest\r\npride was in the excellence of their horsemanship.\r\n\r\nBismarck’s father entered the Body-guard (white and blue), the commander\r\nof which was also a Bismarck, and, as he often told his sons in later\r\ntimes, “measured out the corn every morning at four o’clock to the men\r\nfor five long years.” He loved a country life, grew wearied in Berlin,\r\nespecially when he had grown somewhat deaf, but, with chivalrous\r\ndevotion to his lady wife, conformed to her wishes on this point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMadame von Bismarck, besides esteeming the company of talented persons\r\nand scholars, was devoted to chess, of which she was a complete mistress;\r\nbut her husband’s amusement was the chase to the end of his life. How\r\nstrangely the old gentleman pursued this pastime we learn from a letter\r\nof Bismarck’s to his newly-married sister, in the latter part of 1844;\r\nvery characteristic of the relations maintained by the son and brother.\r\n\r\n    Now you have departed, I have naturally found the house very\r\n    lonely. I have sat by the stove smoking and contemplating\r\n    how unnatural and selfish it is in girls who have brothers,\r\n    and those bachelors, to go and recklessly marry, and act as\r\n    if they only were in the world to follow their own sweet\r\n    wills; a selfish principle from which I feel that our family,\r\n    and myself in proper person, are fortunately free. After\r\n    perceiving the fruitlessness of these reflections, I arose from\r\n    the green leather chair in which you used to sit kissing and\r\n    whispering with Miss and Oscar, and plunged wildly into the\r\n    elections, which convinced me that five votes were mine for\r\n    life or death, and two had somewhat lukewarmly supported me;\r\n    while Krug received four, sixteen to eighteen voted for Arnim,\r\n    and twelve to fifteen for Alvensleben. I therefore thought it\r\n    best to retire altogether. Since then I have lived here with\r\n    father; reading, smoking, walking, helping him to eat lampreys,\r\n    and joining in a farce called fox-hunting. We go out in the\r\n    pouring rain, or at six degrees of frost, accompanied by Ihle,\r\n    Bellin, and Charles, surround an old bush in a sportsmanlike\r\n    way, silent as the grave, as the wind blows through the cover,\r\n    where we are all fully convinced—even perhaps my father—that\r\n    the only game consists of a few old women gathering faggots—and\r\n    not another living thing. Then Ihle, Charles, and a couple\r\n    of hounds, making the strangest and most prodigious noise,\r\n    particularly Ihle, burst into the thicket, my father standing\r\n    perfectly stock still, with his rifle just as if he fully\r\n    expected some beast, until Ihle comes out, shouting “hu! la!\r\n    la! fuss! hey! hey!” in the queerest shrieks. Then my father\r\n    asks me, in the coolest manner, if I have not seen something;\r\n    and I reply, with most natural air of astonishment, nothing in\r\n    the world! Then, growling at the rain, we start for another\r\n    bush, where Ihle is sure we shall find, and play the farce\r\n    over again. This goes on for three or four hours, without my\r\n    father, Ihle, and Fingal exhibiting the least symptom of being\r\n    tired. Besides this, we visit the orangery twice a day, and the\r\n    sheep-pens once, consult the four thermometers in the parlor\r\n    every hour, mark the weather-glass, and since bright weather\r\n    has set in have brought all the clocks so exactly with the sun,\r\n    that the clock in the library is only one stroke behind all\r\n    the rest. Charles V. was a silly fellow! You can understand\r\n    that, with such a multitude of things to do, we have no time\r\n    to visit parsons; as they have no votes at the elections, I\r\n    did not go at all—impossible. Bellin has been for these three\r\n    days full of a journey to Stendal he made, and about the coach\r\n    which he did not catch. The Elbe is frozen, wind S. E. E.,\r\n    the last new thermometer from Berlin marks 8° (27° Fahr.)\r\n    barometer rising 28.8 in. I just mention this to show you how\r\n    you might write more homely particulars to father in your\r\n    letters, as they amuse him hugely—who has been to see you and\r\n    Curts, whom you visit, what you have had for dinner, how the\r\n    horses are, and the servants quarrel, whether the doors crack,\r\n    and the windows are tight—in short, trifles, facts! Mark me,\r\n    too, that he detests the name papa—_avis au lecteur!_ Antonie\r\n    wrote him a very pretty letter on his birthday, and sent him\r\n    a green purse, at which papa was deeply moved, and replied in\r\n    two pages! The Rohrs have lately passed through here without\r\n    showing themselves; they baited at the Inn at Hohen-Göhren\r\n    for two hours, and sat, wife and children and all, with ten\r\n    smoking countrymen, in the taproom! Bellin declared they were\r\n    angry with us; this is very sad and deeply affects me! Our\r\n    father sends best love, and will soon follow me to Pomerania—he\r\n    thinks about Christmas. There is a _café dansant_ to-morrow at\r\n    Genthin; I shall look in, to fire away at the old Landrath, and\r\n    take my leave of the circle for at least four months. I have\r\n    seen Miss ——; she has moments when she is exceedingly pretty,\r\n    but she will lose her complexion very soon. I was in love with\r\n    her for twenty-four hours. Greet Oscar heartily from me, and\r\n    farewell, my angel; don’t hang up your bride’s rank by the\r\n    tail, and remember me to Curts. If you are not at A. by the\r\n    eighth—I’ll!—but enough of that. Entirely your own “forever,”\r\n\r\n                                                        BISMARCK.\r\n\r\nOtto von Bismarck, on his sixteenth birthday, as his brother had\r\nbeen before him, was confirmed at Berlin, in the Trinity Church by\r\nSchleiermacher, at the Easter of 1830. The same year he went to board\r\nwith Professor Prévost, the father of Hofrath Prévost, now an official\r\nin the Foreign Office under Bismarck; and as the house was very remote\r\nfrom the Frederick William Gymnasium in the Königs Strasse, he quitted\r\nit for the Berlin Gymnasium, Zum Grauen Kloster. Bismarck, after a year,\r\npassed from Professor Prévost to Dr. Bonnell, afterwards director of the\r\nFrederick-Werder Gymnasium, then at the Grauen Kloster, but who had not\r\nlong before been Bismarck’s teacher at the Frederick William. Bismarck\r\nremained with him until, at Easter, 1832, he quitted the Kloster after\r\nhis examination, to study law.\r\n\r\nThis is an outline of Bismarck’s life in his boyhood and school-days;\r\nlet us endeavor to form some picture of the lad and youth, from the\r\nreports of his tutors and contemporaries.\r\n\r\nWe see Junker Otto leaving his father’s house at a very early age, as\r\ndid his brother. The reasons for this we can not assign, but no doubt\r\nthey were well meant, although scarcely wise. Bismarck used subsequently\r\nhimself to say that his early departure from the paternal roof was any\r\nthing but advantageous to him. Perhaps his mother was afraid he might get\r\ntoo early spoilt; for with his gay nature and constant friendliness, the\r\nlittle boy early won all hearts. He was especially spoilt by his father,\r\nand by Lotte Schmeling, his mother’s maid, and his own nurse.\r\n\r\nAt the boarding-school of Plamann in Berlin, whither he was next brought,\r\nhe did not get on at all well. This then very renowned institution had\r\nadopted the thorough system of old Jahn, and carried out the theory of\r\n“hardening up,” then fashionable, by starving, exposure, and so forth—not\r\nwithout carrying it to extremes in practice. Bismarck, who had always\r\nsubmitted meekly to all his masters, could not, in later days, refrain\r\nfrom complaining bitterly of the severity with which he was treated in\r\nthis institution. He was very miserable there, and longed for home so\r\nmuch, that when they were out walking, he could not help weeping whenever\r\nhe saw a plough at work. The masters were especially obnoxious to him\r\non account of the strictness with which they insisted on gymnastics\r\nand athletic sports, from the hatred of the French they methodically\r\npreached, and by the tough German usage they exercised towards the little\r\nscion of nobility. In his paternal house, Bismarck had not been educated\r\nin class-hatred, as it is called; on the contrary, his mother was very\r\nliberal, and had no sympathy with the nobility. Marriages between nobles\r\nand citizens were then much more unfrequent; Madame von Bismarck had\r\nvery likely encountered some slights from the proud families of the Alt\r\nMark and of Pomerania, and caste feeling could scarcely have been felt\r\nby Bismarck in his childhood. It was not any want of sympathy with his\r\nschool-fellows, but the democratic doctrines of some of the masters,\r\nwhich roused the Junker in the bosom of the proud lad. We shall see that\r\nin later years it was the incapacity of two masters at the Graue Kloster\r\nwhich caused them to handle him ungently, because of his noble birth,\r\nand thus impelled him to resistance.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that Otto von Bismarck, as long as he stayed at\r\nthe hateful Plamann Institute, and at the Gymnasium, longed ardently for\r\nthe holidays, for these times are the bright stars in the heaven of every\r\nschoolboy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd how was the holiday journey performed in those days from Berlin\r\nto Kniephof in the Circle Naugard? The stagecoach of Nagler—then the\r\npride of Prussia—set off in the evening from Berlin, and arrived at\r\nStettin at noon the next day. There were not over-good roads at that\r\ntime from Berlin to the capital of Pomerania. From Stettin young\r\nBismarck proceeded, with horses sent by his parents, to Gollnow, where\r\nhis grandfather was born, and where proverbially there was a fire once\r\na fortnight. In Gollnow he slept at the house of an aged widow named\r\nDalmer, who held some relation to the family. This aged lady used to tell\r\nthe eager lad stories of his great grandfather the Colonel von Bismarck,\r\nwho fell at Czaslau, and who once lay in garrison at Gollnow with his\r\nregiment of dragoons—the Schulenburg Regiment, afterwards the Anspach\r\nBayreuth. After almost a century, the memory of the famous warrior and\r\nhuntsman remained alive. Stories were told of the Colonel’s fine dogs\r\nand horses. When he gave a banquet, not only did the sound of trumpet\r\naccompany each toast, but the dragoons fired off volleys in the hall, to\r\nheighten the noise. Then the Colonel would march with the whole mess,\r\npreceded by the band and followed by the whole regiment, to the bridge\r\nof Ihna, where the Wooden Donkey stood. This terrible instrument of\r\npunishment—riding the Donkey was like riding the rail—was then cast into\r\nthe Ihna, amidst execrations and applause. “All offenders are forgiven,\r\nand the Donkey shall die!” But the applause of the dragoons could not\r\nhave been very sincere, for they knew very well that the Provost would\r\nset up the Donkey in all its terrors the very next morning; therefore\r\nthey only huzzaed to please their facetious Colonel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of garrison life under King Frederick William I. There\r\nstill exists a hunting register belonging to this old worthy, which\r\nreports that the old soldier in one year had shot a hundred stags—an\r\nunlikely event nowadays. One of the first sportsmen of the present\r\nday—H.R.H. Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia—shot three hundred head\r\nof game between the 18th of September, 1848, and the 18th of September,\r\n1868, pronounced “worthy of fire.” A correspondence of the old Colonel’s\r\nis still extant, which evinces a highly eccentric stanchness; in this\r\nhis cousin, the cunning diplomatist Von Dewitz, afterwards Ambassador\r\nto Vienna, is severely enough handled. It was doubtless from these\r\nstatements of the acute colonel of cavalry that the Great Frederick did\r\nnot allow his son, Charles Alexander, to accompany him to Vienna in the\r\nEmbassy, but ordered him to become a cornet, with some very unflattering\r\nexpressions concerning the diplomatist.\r\n\r\nThe next day young Otto von Bismarck used to leave Gollnow, and thus\r\non the third day he reached Kniephof, where for three weeks he led a\r\nglorious life, troubled only by a few holiday tasks. Among the most\r\npleasant events of holiday time were visits to Zimmerhausen, to the\r\nBlanckenburgs, which possessed an additional charm from a sort of\r\ncheese-cake prepared in this locality.\r\n\r\nFrom Plamann’s school, Bismarck passed to the Frederick William\r\nGymnasium; and here he immediately attracted the attention of a master\r\nwith whom he was afterwards to be more closely associated, and of whom\r\nmention will afterwards be made in this work. This gentleman (the\r\nDirector, Dr. Bonnell) relates:—“My attention was drawn to Bismarck on\r\nthe very day of his entry, on which occasion the new boys sat in the\r\nschoolroom on rows of benches in order that the masters could overlook\r\nthe new comers with attention, during the inauguration. Otto von Bismarck\r\nsat—as I still distinctly remember, and often have related—with visible\r\neagerness, a clear and pleasant boyish face and bright eyes, in a gay and\r\nlightsome mood among his comrades, so that it caused me to think, ‘That’s\r\na nice boy; I’ll keep my eye upon him.’ He became my pupil first when he\r\nentered the upper third. I was transferred at Michaelmas, 1829, from the\r\nBerlin Gymnasium to the Graue Kloster, to which Bismarck also came in the\r\nfollowing year. He became an inmate of my house at Easter, 1831, where he\r\nbehaved himself in my modest household, then numbering only my wife and\r\nmy infant son, in a friendly and confiding manner. In every respect he\r\nwas most charming; he seldom quitted us of an evening; if I was sometimes\r\nabsent, he conversed in a friendly and innocent manner with my wife, and\r\nevinced a strong inclination for domestic life. He won our hearts and\r\nwe met his advances with affection and care—so that his father, when he\r\nquitted us, declared that his son had never been so happy as with us.”\r\n\r\nBismarck to this day has preserved the most grateful intimacy with Dr.\r\nBonnell and his wife; even as Minister-President he loved to cast a\r\npassing glance at the window of the small chamber he had occupied in\r\nKönigsgraben No. 18, while he resided with Dr. Bonnell. The window is now\r\nbuilt up. The powerful minister and great statesman ever remained the\r\nfriendly and kindly Otto von Bismarck towards his old teacher. He sought\r\nhis counsel in the selection of a tutor for his sons, and afterwards sent\r\nthem to the Werder Gymnasium, that still flourishes under the thoroughly\r\nexcellent guidance of Bonnell.\r\n\r\nAmong the favorite masters of Bismarck at the Frederick William\r\nGymnasium, he distinguished Professor Siebenhaar, an excellent man,\r\nwho subsequently unfortunately died by his own hand. He found himself\r\nwelcomed at the Graue Kloster by Koepke with great friendship—his youth\r\nalone prevented his being placed in the first class. Besides Bonnell,\r\nhe here found a great friend in Dr. Wendt; Bollermann, however, and the\r\nmathematician Fischer, raised the Junker in him in an unwise manner. He\r\nalso got into many disputes with the French Professor, and learnt English\r\nin an incredibly short space of time, in order not to be submitted to the\r\ntest of the French Professor; as it was allowed to the pupils to choose\r\neither English or French for a prize theme.\r\n\r\nAs a pupil, in general, Bismarck’s conduct preserved him almost entirely\r\nfrom punishment, and seldom was he amenable to censure. He exhibited\r\nsuch powers of understanding, and his talents were so considerable,\r\nthat he was able to perform his required tasks without great exertion.\r\nHe even at that time exhibited a marked preference for historical\r\nstudies—especially that of his native Brandenburg, Prussia, and Germany.\r\nHe laid the foundations of his eminent historical attainments, afterwards\r\nso formidable to his opponents in parliamentary discussion, in these\r\nyouthful years. The style of his Latin essays was always clear and\r\nelegant, although perhaps not, in a grammatical sense, always correct.\r\nThe decision on his prize essay of Easter, 1832, was, _Oratio est lucida\r\nac latina, sed non satis castigata_. (The language is clear and Latin,\r\nbut not sufficiently polished.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn his departure for the University, Bismarck was not seventeen years\r\nof age, and possessed none of the broad imposing presence he later\r\nattained; his stature was thin and graceful. His countenance possessed\r\nthe brightness of youthful liberality, and his eyes beamed with goodness.\r\nHis eldest son Herbert now recalls in his likeness the vivid image of his\r\nfather in those last days of his pupilage. Bismarck has inherited his\r\ntall stature from his father, who, with his fine presence and cultured\r\nmanners, had been a personage of most aristocratic appearance. But in\r\ngeneral the elder son, Bernhard, was more like his father than the\r\nyounger brother.\r\n\r\nWhen the cholera broke out in Berlin, in 1831, in the general cholera\r\nmania, Bismarck was desired by his father to return home so soon as the\r\nfirst case had declared itself in that city. Like a true schoolboy,\r\nit was utterly impossible for him to receive the news too soon. He\r\nhired a horse, and several times rode to the “Frederick’s field,”\r\nfrom which district the cholera was expected. He, however, fell with\r\nthe horse by the new Guard House, and was carried into his dwelling\r\nwith a sprained leg. To his greatest annoyance he was now obliged to\r\nremain for a considerable time in bed, and endure the approach of the\r\ncholera to Berlin, before he could leave. But he never lost his gayety\r\nand good humor on this account. Bonnell, as might be expected, was\r\ngreatly alarmed, when, on returning home, he learnt that Bismarck had\r\ntumbled from the horse and had been carried to his room; but he was\r\nsoon comforted by the good temper with which the patient recounted the\r\nparticulars of the accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBismarck awaited his convalescence with patient resignation, and when he\r\nwas finally able to enter upon his journey to Kniephof, an event took\r\nplace owing to the strange cholera measures caused by the cholera mania.\r\nTravellers by stage, for instance, might not alight at such places as\r\nBernau or Werneuchen on any account, but the coaches drove side by side\r\nuntil their doors touched and then the exchanges were effected, while\r\nthe local guard paraded with spears in a manner almost Falstaffian. In\r\nanother place, Bismarck was allowed to alight, but he could enter no\r\nhouse; there was a table spread in the open street, where tea and bread\r\nand butter were provided for travellers, and the latter breakfasted,\r\nwhile the inhabitants retired to look upon them in abject terror. When\r\nBismarck called to a waitress to pay her, she fled shrieking, and he was\r\nobliged to leave the price of his breakfast on the table. The saddest\r\ncase was that of a lady traveller, who was proceeding as governess to\r\nCount Borck’s mansion, in Stargard. This poor girl dreaded travelling,\r\nand got into the condition which so outwardly resembles an attack of\r\ncholera. The doctors of Stargard were in an uproar, so the poor governess\r\nwas put into quarantine in the town jail. Bismarck himself went into\r\nquarantine, and was first locked up in the police office at Naugard,\r\nand afterwards at his native place. His mother, it should be mentioned,\r\nhad taken every precaution then in fashion, and had engaged a retired\r\nmilitary surgeon, named Geppert, who had seen much of the cholera during\r\nhis residence in Russia, as a cholera doctor, for her immediate service.\r\nWith this doctor Bismarck was used to hold arguments, for though his\r\nconversation was rude and desultory, he could tell the story of his\r\nvoyages in a practical and animated manner. Madame von Bismarck would\r\nhave been very angry had she had an idea of the carelessness with which\r\nher son observed the severe quarantine rules. However, despite all the\r\npains which the wise lady took, cholera showed itself on her estate,\r\nwhile all the neighbors were free from it. At Jarchelin Mill two boys\r\nhad bathed, against the regulations; they had eaten fruit and drunk\r\nwater—they were sacrificed to the disease. It can be easily understood\r\nwhat a nuisance the quarantine, even in its mildest form, must have been\r\nfor Bismarck, who never believed in the infectious nature of cholera. In\r\nlater times, when the two brothers farmed the estates, there was a case\r\nof cholera in Külz; no one dared to enter the house; the two Bismarcks\r\nwent in, and declared that they themselves would not quit it until they\r\nwere properly relieved. This shamed every one, and proper medical aid was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAs a boy and youth Bismarck was not usually very animated. There was\r\nrather a quiet and observant carriage in him, especially evinced by\r\nthe “blank”, eyes, as they were once very aptly called by a lady;\r\nthese qualities were soon accompanied by determination and endurance\r\nin no insignificant degree. He was obliging and thoughtful in social\r\nintercourse, and soon acquired the reputation of being “good company,”\r\nwithout having transgressed, in the ways so common among social persons.\r\nHe never allowed himself to be approached without politeness, and\r\nseverely censured intruders. His mental qualifications very early showed\r\nthemselves to be considerable; memory and comprehensiveness aided him\r\nremarkably in his study of modern languages. He exhibited a love for\r\n“dumb” animals even as a child; he went to much expense in fine horses\r\nand dogs; his magnificent Danish dog, so faithful to him, long continued\r\na distinguished personage in the whole neighborhood of Kniephof. Riding\r\nand hunting were his favorite pastimes. He has always been an intrepid\r\nand elegant horseman, without being exactly a “riding-master.” To this he\r\nadded the accomplishment of swimming; he was a good fencer and dancer,\r\nbut averse to athletic sports. The gymnastic ground of the Plamann\r\nInstitution had caused him to regard that branch of culture with profound\r\ndislike. As a boy and youth he had grown tall, but he was slim and thin;\r\nhis frame did not develop itself laterally until a later time; his face\r\nwas pale, but his health was always good, and he was, from his youth\r\nup, a hearty eater. A certain proportion of daring was to be noticed in\r\nhis carriage, but expressed in a kindly way; his whole gait was frank\r\nand free, but with some reticence. Thus we do not find that he retained\r\nmany friends of his boyhood and pupilage, a time usually so rife in\r\nfriendships for most men. But such friendships as he did form, continued\r\nfor life. Among Bismarck’s friends of the Gymnasium period, were, besides\r\nMoritz von Blanckenburg, Oscar von Arnim, afterwards his brother-in-law,\r\nWilliam von Schenk, afterwards the possessor of Schloss Mansfeld and\r\nMember of the Chamber of Deputies, and Hans von Dewitz, of Gross Milzow\r\nin Mecklenburg. At the University he added to these Count Kayserlingk of\r\nCourland, the American Lothrop Motley,[27] Oldekop of Hanover, afterwards\r\nCouncillor of War, and Lauenstein, subsequently pastor of Altenwerder on\r\nthe Elbe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we should not omit to say that he from youth preserved\r\na proper attitude towards his domestics; they almost all loved him,\r\nalthough his demands were heavy on them at times. Afterwards, while\r\nadministering the Pomeranian estates with his brother, he censured one of\r\nhis Junior inspectors very severely. The inspector sought to turn aside\r\nthe reproaches by pleading his own dislike to farming, that he had been\r\nforced to it, and so forth.\r\n\r\n“I have long attested myself,” the young man concluded.\r\n\r\n“Far from sufficient!” replied Bismarck, dryly.\r\n\r\nThis reply brought the inspector to his senses; since that time he has\r\nbecome an excellent agriculturist, and to this day thinks gratefully of\r\nBismarck’s “Far from sufficient!”\r\n\r\nThis “Far from sufficient!” is associated in the Alt Mark with the name\r\nof Bismarck from olden time; in the country speech of the district it is\r\nproverbial.\r\n\r\n“Noch lange nicht genug! (Far from sufficient!) quoth Bismarck.”\r\n\r\n“Ueber und über! (Over and over!) quoth Schulenburg.”\r\n\r\n“Grade aus! (Straight forward!) quoth Itzenplitz (Lüderitz?).”\r\n\r\n“Meinetwegen! (I care not!) quoth Alvensleben.”\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to trace the origin of these peasant proverbs.\r\nThe Alvenslebens since early times were reputed “mild;” they are the\r\n_Gens Valeria_ (_Valerius Poblicola_) of the Alt Mark. The Schulenburgs\r\nare “severe,” the _Gens Marcia_ (_Marcius Rex_) of that country; and\r\ncertainly we can perceive some affinity between these qualities and the\r\nproverbs; but what may the “Noch lange nicht genug! sagt Bismarck!” mean?\r\nPerhaps the energetic striving, the essential characteristic of the whole\r\nfamily in a greater or lesser degree: an element of progress which ever,\r\nin their own and others’ action, exclaims, “Far from sufficient!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY AND MILITARY LIFE.\r\n\r\n[1832-1844.]\r\n\r\n    Göttingen.—The Danish Dog and the\r\n    Professor.—Duels.—Berlin.—Appointed Examiner.—Anecdotes\r\n    of his Legal Life.—Bismarck and his Boots.—Meeting\r\n    with Prince, now King, William.—Helene von Kessel.—Aix\r\n    la Chapelle.—Greifswald.—Undertaking the Pomeranian\r\n    Estates.—Kniephof.—“Mad Bismarck.”—His Studies.—Marriage of\r\n    his Sister.—Letters to her.—Norderney.—Saves his Servant\r\n    Hildebrand’s Life—“The Golden Dog.”—A Dinner Party at the\r\n    Blanckenburgs.—Von Blanckenburg.—Major, now General, Von\r\n    Roon.—Dr. Beutner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtto von Bismarck was anxious to enter himself at Heidelberg, but his\r\nmother objected to it, because she was afraid that at this University\r\nher son would contract the habit, to her detestable, of drinking beer;\r\nand she therefore chose, at the advice of a relative—the Geh. Finanzrath\r\nKerl, who was a great authority with her in matters of learning—the\r\nUniversity of Göttingen, where Kerl had himself studied. Bismarck\r\nagreed to the change; he longed for the joys of academic freedom, the\r\nmore delightful to him from the strictness with which his education\r\nhad hitherto been conducted, as well as from his little knowledge of\r\nstudent life. In Berlin student life was somewhat tame, obtruding itself\r\nnowhere; and Bismarck had also been withheld from all contact with it. He\r\nentered into possession of his new liberty with enthusiasm, not easily\r\ncomprehensible to the students of the present day. With the entire\r\nrecklessness of a sturdy constitution he plunged into its every enjoyment.\r\n\r\nEven before entering at Göttingen he had fought his first duel at Berlin.\r\nHis opponent was a brave lad of the Hebrew persuasion, named Wolf. It is\r\ntrue he fought, but, like the ancient Parthians, he fought flying. The\r\narrangements must have been somewhat unscientific, in fact quite out of\r\nform, for Bismarck was wounded in the leg, while he cut off his Jewish\r\nopponent’s spectacles!\r\n\r\nIn the didactic epic “Bismarckias,” by Dr. G. Schwetschke, of which\r\nseveral editions have appeared at Halle, containing many a good joke, the\r\nfollowing aptly alludes to the present period of the hero’s life:—\r\n\r\n    From his boot soles now is shaken\r\n    All the school dust: higher wavelets\r\n    Bear the ship of the aspirant;\r\n    Weighed on deck is every anchor,\r\n    And spread out is every canvass,\r\n    While the youthful flag of freedom,\r\n    Gaily fluttering in the breezes,\r\n    Bears, “Nitimur in vetitum!”\r\n\r\n    Jolly days of wild enjoyment!\r\n    Votaries now gay assemble\r\n    Of the nine Castalian sisters;\r\n    Crowd together in new temples;\r\n    Crowd around the fragrant altars\r\n    Of old Bacchus and Gambrinus:\r\n    And the neophyte so gayly\r\n    Brings the liquid sacrifices.\r\n\r\n    While the battle-loving Mavors\r\n    Opes the clanging doors of combat;\r\n    Dost thou hear the clash of weapons?\r\n    Dost thou mark the shouts of contest?\r\n    Ha! how gleam the flashing sword-blades;\r\n    With the tierce and carte resounding:\r\n    As the hewer hews so fiercely,\r\n    Hews, and his fellow-fighter heweth!\r\n\r\n    E’en then sped a slender red line\r\n    (A red line of blood and iron),\r\n    Through the life of our young hero\r\n    Göttingen, Berlin, and Greifswald\r\n    Echo deeds of noble daring,\r\n    Done in years that now have fleeted;\r\n    “Days departed, days all silent.”\r\n    As old Ossian once out carolled.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck came to Göttingen, as we have said, he had not the\r\nremotest notion of student life; its customs were all unknown to him,\r\nnor did he learn any thing of them immediately, as he there found no\r\nfriend of any degree of intimacy. By a certain Herr von Drenckhahn, whom\r\nhe had formerly seen for a short time, he was introduced to a circle\r\nof Mecklenburgers, who belonged to no academical body, but passed a\r\ntolerably jolly life. With these he travelled into the Harz, and on\r\nhis return it was agreed that the glories of real student life should\r\nbe opened to him. Bismarck gave his fellow-travellers a breakfast in\r\ncelebration of the journey, and here matters went on somewhat madly.\r\nAt length somebody threw a bottle out of the window. Next morning the\r\nDominus de Bismarck was cited to the Deanery, and, obedient to his\r\nacademical superiors, he set forth on the way. He came in a tall hat, a\r\ngay Berlin dressing-gown, and riding-boots, accompanied by his enormous\r\ndog. The Dean stared at this fantastic garb, and only dared to pass\r\nthe huge creature when Bismarck had called him in. On account of this\r\nillegal dog, his fortunate possessor was at once fined five thalers—then\r\ncame a painful investigation into the bottle-throwing matter. The former\r\nofficial was not satisfied with the simple explanation of Bismarck, that\r\nthe bottle had been thrown out of the window; it must have flown out.\r\nHe was determined to know how this had happened, and was not content\r\nuntil the culprit had clearly shown him how he had held the bottle, and\r\nby proper muscular action had given it the necessary impetus. Somewhat\r\nannoyed by this inquiry, he set forth on his way home, and was greatly\r\nincensed at the laughter with which he was encountered by four young\r\nstudents of the corps of Hanover—although it was impossible not to\r\nlaugh at his dress. “Are you laughing at me?” inquired Bismarck of the\r\nforemost of the party, and received as a reply, “Hm! that you must very\r\nwell see!” In his inexperience Bismarck hardly knew how to proceed;\r\nhe felt that he was in the right way to encounter a duel, but he knew\r\nnothing of the proper form. He was afraid of exposing himself, when\r\nsuddenly—happy thought!—the “dummer Junge” (foolish fellow) occurred to\r\nhim. He “growled,” and felt exceedingly proud when he was challenged by\r\nthe four Hanoverians. He then took the necessary steps, and obtained\r\nweapons from the corps of Brunswickers. But not one of these four duels\r\nwas destined to be fought; for a sly agent of the Hanoverians, who lived\r\nin the same house with Bismarck, had seen that he was made of the stuff\r\nof which good student-chums are formed, and induced his four companions\r\nto revoke or receive suitable apologies—in short, the Fuchs (freshman)\r\nBismarck “sprang,” _i.e._, joined the Hanoverians, and became a member\r\nof their union. At this there was great rage among the Brunswickers,\r\nfor it was contrary to etiquette to obtain weapons from one corps and\r\nthen join another; but of this Bismarck knew nothing. The Consenior of\r\nthe Brunswickers challenged the Fuchs; they at once engaged, and Mr.\r\nConsenior was led off with a slash across the face, after he had roused\r\nBismarck’s wrath by several flat sword-strokes of a very ungentle\r\nkind. To this duel there succeeded during the first three terms some\r\ntwenty duels more. Bismarck fought them all with success, and was only\r\nwounded in one instance by the fracture of his adversary’s sword-blade.\r\nThe scar is still to be seen on the Minister-President’s cheek. After a\r\nduello-dispute, this “blood” was held not to be “good,” as it was caused\r\nby accident, to the great annoyance of his opponent. The latter still\r\nasserts that it was “good;” at least, being now the Deputy Biederwig, he\r\nheld an animated controversy with the Minister-President on the question\r\nvery recently in the White Saloon.\r\n\r\nAmidst the stormy career pursued by Bismarck in Göttingen, it is only\r\nnatural that he had no leisure to attend the classes; nevertheless he\r\nreceived very good testimonials as to his industry; but old Hugo remarked\r\nthat he had never seen Herr von Bismarck at lecture. He believed that the\r\nlectures of the celebrated jurist would be so well attended that he might\r\nsafely omit to attend; unfortunately, the old gentleman had only had\r\nthree hearers, and had observed the absence of Bismarck with pain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnce Bismarck went home in the vacation, but in his velvet coat, and with\r\nthe student’s manner; he found little approbation at the hands of his\r\nmother, who did not find his whole appearance in harmony with the picture\r\nof the diplomatist she fondly expected to see.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, too, whither Bismarck returned in the autumn of 1833, he\r\nfound the license of student life far too sweet to enable him to sever\r\nhimself from it. When the examination was threatening him like a terrible\r\nspectre, he summoned up determination, and went to lecture for the first\r\ntime; he went a second, and the last time; he saw that, even under\r\nSavigny, he could not profit as much from jurisprudence as he required\r\nfor his examination, in the short time remaining to him. He never\r\nreappeared at lecture. But he passed his examination with credit at the\r\nappointed time, with the aid of his own industry, his great gifts, and by\r\na clever _memoria technica_.\r\n\r\nDuring his Berlin student life he resided with Count Kayserlingk, of\r\nCourland, who afterwards became Curator of the University of Dorpat; he\r\nlearnt from him to set a value on music, and often heard him perform;\r\nhe was especially fond of Beethoven. After Kayserlingk, an American\r\nnamed Lothrop Motley became his companion. This gentleman won himself\r\nfame as the author of a History of the Rise of the Dutch Republic, and\r\nother works, was sent as United States Ambassador to Vienna, and is now\r\nAmbassador to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck became sworn, after his examination about Easter, 1885, in\r\nthe capacity of Auscultator (Examiner) he again occupied apartments in\r\nthe Behrenstrasse, jointly with his brother Bernhard, who, about that\r\ntime, after having served four years in the Dragoon Regiment of Guards,\r\nexchanged the sword for the pen, passed his examination in the following\r\nyear, and became Referendary in the government at Potsdam. During\r\nBismarck’s service as clerk in the City Police, he exhibited his sense\r\nof humor by many pranks, of which we could give an account were we able\r\nto vouch for their authenticity—these are, however, so numerous, that\r\nwe are sure many are ascribed to Bismarck, properly the acts of others.\r\nThe following anecdote we know to be genuine: The Auscultator was taking\r\nthe protocol of a true Berliner, who finally so tried the patience of\r\nBismarck by his impudence, that he jumped up, and exclaimed, “Sir, behave\r\nbetter, or I’ll have you kicked out!” The magistrate present patted the\r\nzealous official in a friendly way upon the shoulder, and said quietly,\r\n“Herr Auscultator, the kicking out is _my_ business.” They proceeded\r\nin taking evidence, but very soon Bismarck again sprang to his feet,\r\nthundering out, “Sir, behave yourself better, or the magistrate shall\r\nkick you out!” The face of the Court may be imagined.\r\n\r\nBismarck had a great deal to do in divorce cases, which were then treated\r\nin a manner in Prussia—with a thoughtlessness still sadly remembered,\r\nalthough long since receiving a more solemn and worthier attention. The\r\nyoung jurist was deeply impressed by a lady with whom he had to arrange\r\na divorce, when she decisively refused to attest it. She had determined\r\notherwise. Bismarck, who had never met with such a refusal, was\r\ndisconcerted, and at last went and consulted with the senior jurist, and\r\nrequested his aid. Arrogantly shrugging his shoulders at the inexperience\r\nof his young colleague, he entered into the matter, and endeavored with\r\nall his wisdom and authority to induce the poor woman to consent to the\r\ndivorce. She, however, continued her refusal; the matter ended without\r\nany result. Bismarck never forgot this circumstance.\r\n\r\nTo the more amusing events of that time belongs the history of how\r\nBismarck taught a boot-maker in the Kronenstrasse punctuality. This man,\r\nafter many express promises, had neglected him on several occasions.\r\nWhen this again occurred, the shoemaker was roused at six o’clock the\r\nnext morning by a messenger with the simple question: “Are Herr von\r\nBismarck’s boots ready yet?” When the maker said, “No,” he retired,\r\nbut in ten minutes another arrived. Loud rang the bell. “Are Herr von\r\nBismarck’s boots ready yet?” “No;” and so it went on every ten minutes\r\nuntil the boots were ready in the evening. The shoemaker no doubt never\r\ndisappointed him again.\r\n\r\nTo the social circles in which the brothers Bernhard and Otto von\r\nBismarck then moved, there belonged the intimately related house of\r\nMadame General von Kessel. She was a sister of Bismarck’s mother and\r\nresided in Berlin, possessing many daughters. Here he found pleasant\r\nand amiable society, and the affection of a relative. Another house\r\nhe was very fond of visiting was that of his cousin, the Count von\r\nBismarck-Bohlen, who was also accustomed to pass the winter in\r\nBerlin with his family. During the winter of 1835-’6, Bismarck was\r\nalso introduced to the Court festivities, and took part in the usual\r\namusements.\r\n\r\nAt a Court ball he first met the Prince William, son of H.M. the King\r\nFrederick William III., as His Royal Highness was then called, to\r\ndistinguish him from the Prince William, brother of H.M. the King.\r\nBismarck was introduced to the Royal Prince at the same time as a\r\ncertain Herr von Schenk; the latter was as tall as Bismarck, and also a\r\nlegal official. Looking at the two stately forms of these youths, Prince\r\nWilliam said merrily, “Well! Justice seeks her young advocates according\r\nto the standard of the Guards.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis was the first meeting between the King William, afterwards to be,\r\nand his Bismarck; the first scarcely expected ever to wear a crown, but\r\nBismarck most certainly never thought that he should be that King’s\r\npowerful Premier and most faithful servant.\r\n\r\nOne evening Bismarck appeared in the saloons of Madame von Kessel, quiet,\r\nin low spirits, his hair, smoothly combed down, a melancholy mode of\r\n“Frisur,” wearing a long waistcoat of woollen stuff, in trowsers of large\r\npattern, checked blue and green; in short, his plight was one of the\r\nmost comical kind. In a gentle conciliatory way he accepted all the jokes\r\nit created, and patiently allowed a sketch of himself to be taken in this\r\ncostume. This caricature is still in the possession of the family, and\r\nis highly characteristic. About a year afterwards, his cousin, Helene\r\nvon Kessel, herself a skillful artist, painted a portrait of him; this\r\nvery excellent likeness displays his bountiful head of hair, and forms\r\na striking contrast to the “Three Hairs,” with which the Berlin Punch,\r\n“Kladderadatsch,” usually endows the Premier. This cousin, Helene von\r\nKessel, at present a canoness at Lindow, remained during her whole life\r\non the most intimate terms with the Minister-President. Once, on taking\r\na journey for some weeks into Pomerania, his cousin begged him to take a\r\nletter for her and deliver it. He took it; but when he returned, and she\r\nasked him about it, he looked in his pockets; he happened to have the\r\nsame coat on, and brought out the letter, but, with great presence of\r\nmind, declared that he had not delivered it in order to entirely cure his\r\ncousin of the habit of intrusting him with letters. Among the surprises\r\nhe delighted to prepare, some were very curious. Thus, on one occasion,\r\nat Kniephof, he was in deep conversation with his cousins, when the door\r\nsuddenly opened, and four young foxes dashed into the room, and in their\r\nterror they jumped upon the sofas and chairs till they tore them to rags.\r\nThe company, after their first surprise, could not help bursting into a\r\nscream of laughter.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, Referendarius von Bismarck left the Department of\r\nJustice for that of Administration. As a future diplomatist, it was\r\nnecessary to serve in that; therefore he went to Aachen (Aix la Chapelle)\r\nto the Crown Court. Count Arnim-Boytzenburg was at that time President;\r\nhe possessed a great reputation, and Bismarck hoped that he should be\r\nable to effect a conjunction with this rising star, and follow in his\r\ncourse. He was received by the Arnim family with great kindness, and\r\nat first was very industrious; but he soon was carried into the vortex\r\nof society which existed during the season at the celebrated baths of\r\nthe Imperial city. He associated much with Englishmen, Frenchmen, and\r\nBelgians, and in their company made several excursions to Belgium,\r\nFrance, and the Rhine province. He was especially the favorite of the\r\nEnglish, as they were delighted to find in him an amiable gentleman,\r\npossessing a perfect mastery over their language. These connections,\r\nhowever, got him into many scrapes.\r\n\r\nHe, in consequence, quitted “het ryk van Aaken” (the realm of Aachen),\r\nand, in the autumn of 1837, had himself transferred to the Crown Office\r\nat Potsdam. About the same time, in 1838, he entered the Jäger Guard, to\r\nfulfill his military duties. But the merry mess-room life did not last\r\nlong, and in the same year he exchanged into the second battalion of\r\nJäger, at Greifswald, hoping to attend the lectures of the Agricultural\r\nAcademy of Eldena.\r\n\r\nTo such studies he was compelled by the sad state into which the\r\nadministration of the paternal estates in Pomerania had fallen, and\r\nwhich threatened total ruin. On this account the sons proposed to their\r\nfather to grant them the Pomeranian estates, as the only way in which\r\nthe estates could be saved. His parents acceded to the proposition, and\r\nretired to Schönhausen, under the faithful care of Bellin, to there pass\r\nthe evening of their lives. His father continued to reside there until\r\n1845; but his mother, long an invalid, sought better medical attendance\r\nin Berlin, and died in that city on the 1st of November, 1839.\r\n\r\nAt first, the elder brother, Bernhard von Bismarck, undertook the sole\r\nadministration of the estates, Otto remaining until the end of his year\r\nof service, until Easter, 1839, at Greifswald, but he soon perceived\r\nthat it was impossible to combine the military service with agricultural\r\nstudies. He soon fell into wild student ways again, there being nothing\r\nbetter to do in that place.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1839 Bismarck entered on the administration of the\r\nPomeranian estates, and carried it on, in conjunction with his brother,\r\nuntil the summer of 1841. At this time the elder brother was elected\r\nLandrath of the circle of Naugard, married, and settled in the chief\r\ntown. By this the common household of Kniephof was broken up; and they\r\ndivided the estates in such a manner that the elder brother retained\r\nKülz, the younger receiving Kniephof and Jarchelin.\r\n\r\nThe younger brother had already desired to divide the estates, as he\r\nspent more than his elder brother, and the income of the common treasury\r\ntherefore fell short. Until his marriage, Bernhard would not consent\r\nto this, the brotherly affection between them having always been very\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\nBismarck became Deputy to the circle in his brother’s place, and in\r\nthat capacity conducted the management of Naugard, and was chosen\r\nrepresentative in the Provincial Pomeranian Diet; but, after the first\r\nsession, wearied by the unimportant duties assigned to him, he resigned\r\nhis functions; his place was filled by his brother.\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck, at the age of twenty-three, in the most pressing\r\ncircumstances, without credit or capital, undertook the conduct of the\r\nwasted estates, he evinced prudence and activity, and, as long as bitter\r\nwant pressed upon him, he found solace in agricultural activity; but\r\nwhen, by his means, the estates began to rise in value, and every thing\r\nwent on smoothly, and he was able to rely upon able subordinates, the\r\nadministration gave him less satisfaction, and he felt the circle in\r\nwhich he moved too contracted for him. In his youthful fancy, he had\r\nformed a certain ideal of a country Junker; hence he had no carriage,\r\nperformed all his journeys on horseback, and astonished the neighborhood\r\nby riding six to ten miles[29] to evening assemblies in Polzin. Despite\r\nof his wild life and actions, he felt a continually increasing sense of\r\nloneliness; and the same Bismarck who gave himself to jolly carouses\r\namong the officers of the neighboring garrisons, sank, when alone, into\r\nthe bitterest and most desolate state of reflection. He suffered from\r\nthat disgust of life common to the boldest officers at certain times,\r\nand which has been called “first lieutenant’s melancholy.” The less real\r\npleasure he had in his wild career, the madder it became; and he earned\r\nhimself a fearful reputation among the elder ladies and gentlemen, who\r\npredicted the moral and pecuniary ruin of “Mad Bismarck.”\r\n\r\nThe mansion of Kniephof is pleasantly situated, but was built in a very\r\nsimple style by its first possessor, the brave Cavalry Colonel Frederick\r\nAugust, who lay in garrison at that time at Gollnow, hard by, and who\r\npersonally superintended its construction. The whole arrangements of the\r\ndwelling—little changed to this day—are of the sober simplicity of the\r\nera of Frederick William I. The then Major von Bismarck had purchased\r\nthese estates chiefly to gratify his passion for the chase, for game\r\nthen abounded on it, especially deer, very few of which remained when\r\nhis grandson, Otto, came to reside there.\r\n\r\nKniephof did not then behold stag huntings with horses and mastiffs, as\r\nin the previous century. But strange scenes occurred when the youthful\r\nowner, tortured by dark thoughts, dashed restlessly, to kill time,\r\nthrough the fields, sometimes in solitude, and sometimes in the company\r\nof gay companions and guests; so that Kniephof became a Kneiphof far and\r\nwide in the land.[30] Strange stories were current about their nocturnal\r\ncarouses, at which none could equal “Mad Bismarck” in emptying the great\r\nbeaker filled with porter and champagne. Tales of a wild character were\r\nwhispered in the circles of shuddering ladies—the power of imagination\r\nbeing rife in dear old Pomerania. At each mad adventure, each wild burst\r\nof humor, a dozen myths started up, sometimes of a comical, sometimes a\r\nterrible character, until the little mansion of Kniephof or “Kneiphof”\r\nwas looked upon as haunted. But the ghosts must have had tolerably\r\nstrong nerves, for the guests, slumbering with nightcaps of porter and\r\nchampagne, were often roused by pistol-shots, the bullets whistling over\r\ntheir heads, and the lime from their ceilings tumbling into their faces.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the guests at this time relate that they were “miserably”\r\nbored at Bismarck’s nocturnal political discussions with his intimate\r\nfriends, Dewitz of Mesow and Bülow of Hoffelde—so different in character,\r\nbut so inseparable from him. Young gentlemen in those days were not\r\nso accustomed to political discussions as the youth of our time, and\r\npolitical parties were then nearly unknown. It should be stated,\r\nhowever, that Otto von Bismarck, despite his wild life, stood in high\r\nconsideration, and he was heard with avidity, though the affair might be\r\n“miserably” tedious. “He made an impression on all of us—and I think at\r\nthat time he was somewhat of a liberal!” a companion of those days told\r\nus, who complained of being “wretchedly bored” amongst the rest. The\r\nestimation in which Bismarck was held was in nowise confined to youth;\r\ngrave men of position, in a greater or less degree, felt that from this\r\nfermenting mass would be formed an excellent and strong wine. Many of\r\nthe electors desired to nominate him for the Landrath, but Bismarck,\r\ndecidedly enough, refused this.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came a day, on which the furious revelry of “Kneiphof”\r\nwas silent; the old mansion, as if by enchantment, grew quiet and\r\nrespectable, so that the world was first astonished and then whispered,\r\n“A lady will become mistress of Kniephof!”\r\n\r\nBut no lady appeared at Kniephof—it was a mistake, perhaps a\r\ndisappointment. It was then said, “Bismarck is going to India!” He did\r\nnot go, though, perhaps, he for a time desired to do so.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it must be said that Bismarck fought chivalrously with the\r\ndemons around him. He read much, and continually received parcels of\r\nbooks from his bookseller, chiefly historical works, but also theological\r\nand philosophical works. Spinoza he studied deeply. The melancholy he\r\nhad contracted by the events which befell him on the Rhine, he strove to\r\ndissipate by travelling. About this time he visited France and England;\r\nhe even resumed the position of Referendarius under the Crown at Potsdam,\r\nand was very industrious; his friends, among whom were Baron Senfft\r\nvon Pilsach, afterwards Chief President of Pomerania, and his brother,\r\nconsidering him remarkably adapted for the services of the State,\r\nalthough at that time he assumed a very surly attitude in reference to\r\nthe bureaucracy. It was probably about this time, at a party, where\r\nhis President somewhat slighted him, as he was inferior to him as an\r\nofficial, that he begged the President in a friendly way to consider that\r\nin society Herr von Bismarck was as good as Herr von Anybody Else—which\r\nscarcely pleased the President. Another of his chiefs once pretended not\r\nto notice the presence of Bismarck, went to the window and began drumming\r\nwith his fingers, whereupon Bismarck went to the window and stood beside\r\nhim, drumming the Dessau March. It was very likely the same official who\r\nallowed Bismarck to wait in the antechamber for an hour, and received the\r\nanswer to his short question “What do you want?”—“I came here to beg for\r\nleave of absence, and now demand leave to resign.” To about this time may\r\nbe referred a report of Bismarck’s as to certain expropriations, which\r\nattained much celebrity. He might have been appointed Landrath in Posen\r\nor Prussia Proper, had he been willing to go. In this report Bismarck\r\nfreely and faithfully spoke his opinion as to the injustice of many\r\nexpropriations, and his friends still quote the classical phrase, “You\r\ncould not pay it me in cash, if you were to turn the park of my father\r\ninto a carp lake, or the grave of my deceased aunt into an eel swamp!”\r\n\r\nHe decided in the end to go to Schönhausen, and become Landrath in the\r\noriginal seat of his race. His father was ready to resign Schönhausen\r\nto him, but this plan also failed. In the autumn of 1844, on the 30th\r\nof October, he had the delight, after his return from a longer journey,\r\nto betroth his only sister Malwina, to whom he was ever affectionately\r\nattached, to the friend of his youth, the Landrath of Angermünde, Oscar\r\nvon Arnim. The affection of the brother and sister, people proverbially\r\ncompared to that of a bridegroom to a bride.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father, which took place in November, 1845, the\r\nsons so divided the property, that the elder retained Külz and received\r\nJarchelin, the younger retaining Kniephof and adding to it Schönhausen.\r\nFrom that time Bismarck resided in Schönhausen, became Dyke Captain\r\nthere, and afterwards Knight’s Deputy in the circle of Jerichow in the\r\nSaxon Provincial Diet at Merseburg. In that capacity he attended the\r\nfirst meeting of the United Diets in 1847, on which occasion he first\r\nattracted the notice of the public to himself in more extended circles.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give some letters written by Bismarck to his sister at this\r\ntroubled time, as they afford an insight into his peculiarities. We\r\ncalled this a troubled time, as the management of Kniephof and Jarchelin\r\nafforded him no satisfaction, for we find him continually flitting about\r\nbetween Pomerania, Schönhausen, and Berlin. In Berlin itself he changed\r\nhis residence very often. On the morning of such removal he used to\r\nsay abruptly to his servant, “Bring all my things to No. so-and-so, in\r\nso-and-so Street; I shall be there by bed-time.” The things were placed\r\non tables, chairs, and sofa, spread out; for Bismarck loved, as he said,\r\nto hold a review of his worldly possessions.\r\n\r\nWe must add that the disquiet he then suffered had a particular reason,\r\nand we shall find some allusions to this in his letters.\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    MADEMOISELLE,—I have just received your boots from Glaser,\r\n    and while they are being packed up I write to say that I am\r\n    fairly amused here, and hope you enjoy your quadrille as much.\r\n    I was pleasantly surprised to hear you danced with ——. If the\r\n    boots are not properly made I am sorry, for you did not write\r\n    any thing to me on the subject, so I had them made like the\r\n    old ones. To-morrow I go with Arnim to Schönhausen, where we\r\n    propose to have a hunting-party. Father has given permission\r\n    to us to kill a stag, but it is almost a pity at the present\r\n    time of year. It has been freezing since yesterday. Among you\r\n    Samoyeds the snow ought to be as high as the house. There are\r\n    no news here—all is mourning—the King of Sweden also is dead. I\r\n    feel ever more how alone I am in the world. To your quadrille\r\n    you will probably only see —— from here. I have been able to\r\n    excite jealousy. Take care that ice is brought in at Kniephof,\r\n    and as much as possible, or you will have to drink lukewarm\r\n    champagne in summer. Greet every one, especially father.\r\n\r\n                                                                 B.\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Wednesday, 1844.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MALDEWINE,—Only because it is yourself, I will depart from\r\n    one of my principles, by writing a letter of congratulation\r\n    _purement pour féliciter_. I can not come myself to your\r\n    birthday, because my viceroy is not here to relieve me; but I\r\n    would risk the assertion, that according to your incredulous\r\n    bridegroom’s view, you would be convinced that I came to you on\r\n    business, and not for your own sake. Looking at it carefully, I\r\n    don’t know what I can wish you, for you can remain as you are;\r\n    but I could wish that you had two more sisters-in-law; one who\r\n    is gone, and one who will not arrive. Good-bye, my heart—greet\r\n    my father, Arnim, Antonie, etc.; in about a fortnight I hope to\r\n    see you. Count the days till then, and kiss your affectionate\r\n    brother,\r\n\r\n                                                           BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    Kniephof, 27th June, 1844.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    DEAR LITTLE ONE,—Being too much engaged in packing to attend\r\n    the Landwehr drill, I will only just write a couple of lines,\r\n    as I shall have no time to do so after this, just now. Very\r\n    shortly after the wool-market I represented our vagabond of a\r\n    Landrath, have had many fires, many sessions in the burning\r\n    heats, and much travelling through sandy bramble moors, so\r\n    that I am completely tired of playing the Landrath, and so are\r\n    my horses. I am hardly at rest for a week, and now I must go\r\n    serve my country as a soldier! You see[31] “how men of merit\r\n    are sought after, the undeserver may,” etc. I am sorry to\r\n    say I have had to buy another horse, as mine is not adapted\r\n    for evolutions; however, I must try it, with Grosvenor for\r\n    a reserve. The latter pulls the carriage like an old coach\r\n    horse; I must therefore pay for it, you can tell Oscar (as soon\r\n    as the rape harvest is current), which I had firmly resolved\r\n    not to do—if he did not draw well. [Here a blot.] Forgive the\r\n    preceding Arabic; I have not a moment’s time to write this\r\n    billet over again, for I must set out in an hour, and much\r\n    packing has yet to be done. We shall remain for fourteen days\r\n    in garrison at Crüssow, by Stargard, afterwards near Fiddichow\r\n    and Bahn, opposite Schwedt. If you write to me, address me at\r\n    Stargard, Poste Restante; I shall make no apologies for my long\r\n    silence, and, if the case arise, regard you in the same way.\r\n    Good-bye—my portmanteau is yawning at me in expectation of\r\n    being packed, and it looks very blue and white and military all\r\n    around me.\r\n\r\n    When we reach Fiddichow, Oscar can visit me at Bahn. I will let\r\n    him know. Your faithful brother,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    Kniephof, the 21st.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n                                        Norderney, 9th Sept., 1844.\r\n\r\n    DARLING LITTLE ONE,—A fortnight ago I intended to write to\r\n    you, without being able, amidst the throng of business and\r\n    pleasure, to do so. If you are curious to know the nature of\r\n    the business, I am really unable, with the sparseness of my\r\n    time and paper, to give you a complete picture, as its series\r\n    and nature, according to the change of ebb and flood, every\r\n    day produces the most manifold variety. Bathing, for instance,\r\n    only takes place at flood tide, the waves being then strongest;\r\n    this happens between six in the morning and six in the evening,\r\n    every day one hour later, and is enjoyed with the advantages of\r\n    a breezy, rainy, summer morning, sometimes in God’s beautiful\r\n    nature with the glorious impressions of land and water,\r\n    sometimes in my landlord’s _Mousse Omne Fimmen_ bed, five feet\r\n    long, with the delightful ideas inspired by a seaweed mattress.\r\n    In the same way, the _table d’hôte_ changes its times between\r\n    one and five o’clock, its component parts varying between\r\n    shell-fish, beans, and mutton on the odd days, and soles, peas,\r\n    and veal on the even days of the month, in which case sweet\r\n    porridge with fruit sauce accompanies the former, and currant\r\n    pudding the latter. That the eye may not envy the palate, a\r\n    lady from Denmark sits beside me, whose appearance fills me\r\n    with sorrow and longings for home, for she reminds me of the\r\n    pepper at Kniephof, when it is very thin. Her mind must be\r\n    heavenly, or Fate was very much unjust to her, for she offers\r\n    me, in a sweet voice, two helpings from every dish before her.\r\n    Opposite sits the old minister ——, one of those beings we only\r\n    behold in dreams, when we are somnolently ill; a fat frog\r\n    without legs, who opens his mouth before every morsel like a\r\n    carpet-bag, right up to his shoulders, so that I am obliged\r\n    to hold on to the table for giddiness. My other neighbor is a\r\n    Russian officer; a good fellow, built like a bootjack, with a\r\n    long slender body, and short crooked legs. Most of the people\r\n    have left, and our dinner company has melted from two or three\r\n    hundred down to twelve or fifteen. My holiday at the baths is\r\n    now over, and I shall leave by the next steamboat, expected\r\n    the day after to-morrow (the 11th) for Heligoland, and then\r\n    by Hamburg to Schönhausen. I can not, however, fix the day\r\n    of my arrival, because it is uncertain that the steamer will\r\n    arrive the day after to-morrow; the notices say so, but they\r\n    often retard the later passages if there are not sufficient\r\n    passengers to bear the expense. The Bremen steamships have\r\n    long since stopped, and I do not like travelling by land, the\r\n    roads being so bad that it is only possible to reach Hanover\r\n    by the third day, and the post-coaches are abominable. If,\r\n    therefore, the steamer does not come the day after to-morrow, I\r\n    propose to go by sailing vessel to Heligoland; thence there is\r\n    a twice-a-week boat to Hamburg, but I do not know on what days.\r\n    Father wrote me word that you would go to Berlin on the 15th;\r\n    if I therefore find, on reaching Hamburg, that I can not reach\r\n    you per steamer by the 15th, I shall try and get the Potsdam\r\n    boat, and go direct to Berlin, to talk about art and industrial\r\n    matters with you. If you receive this letter in time, which,\r\n    considering the slowness of the post here, I scarcely think you\r\n    will, you might send me a couple of lines to Hamburg—Old Stadt\r\n    London Hotel—to say whether father has changed his travelling\r\n    plans. The bathing here pleases me, and I should not mind\r\n    stopping a few days longer. The shore is splendid—very flat,\r\n    even, soft sand, without any stones, and a surf such as I have\r\n    neither seen in the Baltic nor at Dieppe. Even when I am only\r\n    knee-high in the water, a wave comes as high as a house (but\r\n    the houses here are not so high as the palace at Berlin),\r\n    turns me over ten times, and throws me on the sand some twenty\r\n    paces off—a simple amusement which I daily enjoy, _con amore_,\r\n    as long as the medical men advise. I have made great friends\r\n    with the lake; every day I sail for some hours, fish, and\r\n    shoot at seals. I only killed one of the last; such a gentle\r\n    dog’s face, with large, handsome eyes; I was really sorry. A\r\n    fortnight ago we had heavy storms; some twenty ships, of all\r\n    nations, came ashore here, and for several days the shore was\r\n    covered with innumerable fragments of wreck, utensils, goods in\r\n    casks, bodies, clothes, and papers. I have, myself, had some\r\n    sample of what a storm is. With a piscatorial friend, Tonke\r\n    Hams, I had sailed in four hours to the island of Wangeroge; on\r\n    our return we were tossed about for twenty-four hours in the\r\n    little boat, and in the first hour had not a dry thread on us,\r\n    although I lay in an apology for a cabin; fortunately, we were\r\n    well provided with ham and port wine, or the voyage would have\r\n    been very distressing. Hearty greetings to father, and thanks\r\n    for his letter; the same to Antonie and Arnim. Farewell, my\r\n    treasure, my heart. Your loving brother,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    MADAME,—It is only with great difficulty that I withstand my\r\n    desire to fill a whole letter with agricultural complaints,\r\n    about night-frosts, sick cattle, bad rape and bad roads,\r\n    dead lambs, hungry sheep, scarcity of straw, fodder, money,\r\n    potatoes, and manure; in addition to that, John outside is, as\r\n    continually as badly, whistling a wretched Schottische, and I\r\n    have not the cruelty to forbid him, as music may perhaps soothe\r\n    his despair in love. The ideal of his dreams, at her parents’\r\n    desire, has lately refused him, and married a frame-maker. Just\r\n    my case, except the frame-maker, who is rasping away in the\r\n    bosom of the future. I _must_, the Devil take me! get married,\r\n    I can again see, plainly; since, after my father’s departure,\r\n    I feel lonely and forsaken, and this mild, damp weather makes\r\n    me melancholy, and longingly prone to love. I can not help it,\r\n    in the end I must marry ——; every body will have it so, and\r\n    nothing seems more natural, as we have both remained behind.\r\n    She is somewhat cold to me, but that is the way with them all;\r\n    it is pretty not to be able to change one’s affections like\r\n    one’s shirt, however seldom the last event may occur. That\r\n    on the 1st I bore the visit of several ladies with polite\r\n    urbanity, our father will have informed you. When I came from\r\n    Angermünde, I was cut off from Kniephof by the floods of the\r\n    Hampel, and as no one would let me have horses, I was obliged\r\n    to remain for the night at Naugard, with many merchants and\r\n    other travellers who also awaited the subsidence of the waters.\r\n    Afterwards the bridges over the Hampel were carried away, so\r\n    that Knobelsdorf and I, the Regents of two mighty Circles, were\r\n    surrounded here on a little patch by the waters, and there was\r\n    an anarchical interregnum from Schievelbein to Damm. About\r\n    one o’clock one of my wagons with three casks of spirits was\r\n    carried away by the flood, and in my little river the Hampel,\r\n    I pride myself to say, a man driving a pitch-cart was carried\r\n    away by the flood and drowned.[32] Besides this, several houses\r\n    in Gollnow fell in, a criminal in the jail hanged himself for\r\n    being flogged, and my neighbor, the proprietor ——, in ——, shot\r\n    himself on account of the want of fodder; three widows and an\r\n    infant mourn in tearless sorrow beside the bloody coffin of the\r\n    suicide. An eventful time! It is to be expected that several of\r\n    our acquaintance will quit the scene, as this year, with its\r\n    bad harvest, low prices, and the long winter, is difficult to\r\n    be encountered by embarrassed proprietors. To-morrow I expect\r\n    Bernhard to return, and am glad to be quit of the District\r\n    business, very agreeable in summer, but very unpleasant during\r\n    this weather and rain. Then I shall, should Oscar not write\r\n    otherwise, come to Kröchelndorf and thence to you.\r\n\r\n    I have nothing new to tell you from hence, except that I am\r\n    still satisfied with Bellin—the thermometer now at 10 P.M.\r\n    marks +10° (50° Fahr.). Odin still continues lame of his right\r\n    fore paw, and enjoys the society of his Rebecca with touching\r\n    affection all day, and I was obliged to chain her up for\r\n    domestic misbehavior. Good-night, _m’amie, je t’embrasse_.\r\n    Thine, etc., etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    Kniephof, 9th April, 1845.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    VI.\r\n\r\n    MOST DEAR CREUSA,—I have not taken the smallest key with me,\r\n    and can assure you from experience that it never leads to\r\n    the slightest result to look for keys; for which reason, in\r\n    such circumstances—very rare with me, with my love of order—I\r\n    at once turn to the locksmith to have a new one made. With\r\n    important ones, such as safes, one has the choice of altering\r\n    the wards and all the keys in use. I can see that I shall soon\r\n    end my letter; not from malice, because you only wrote a page\r\n    to me—it would be terrible to think that you would consider\r\n    me so wretchedly revengeful; but from sleepiness. I have been\r\n    riding and walking all day in the sun—saw a dance in Plathe\r\n    yesterday, and drank a good deal of Montebello; the one gives\r\n    me bile, the other the cramp. Add to this, in swallowing, a\r\n    painful swelling of the uvula, a slight headache, cramped legs,\r\n    and sun-burn, and you can understand that neither my thoughts\r\n    of you, my angel, nor the melancholy howling of a shepherd dog,\r\n    locked up for too great a passion for hunting, can keep me\r\n    longer awake. I will only tell you that the Kränzchen (club) is\r\n    not very much visited; a very pretty little Miss ——, sister of\r\n    ——, was there, and that most of the young and old ladies are\r\n    lying in childbed, except Frau von ——, the little one who wore\r\n    the light blue satin; and that I go to-morrow to an æsthetic\r\n    tea in ——. Sleep well, my idolized one—it is eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    K., 27th April, 1845.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    VII.\r\n\r\n    MA SŒUR,—_Je t’écris pour t’annoncer_ that I shall be with you\r\n    at Angermünde at the latest by the 3d March, if you do not\r\n    write to me before that you will not have me. I think then,\r\n    after I have enjoyed a sight of you for three or four days, to\r\n    carry off your husband to attend a meeting of the Society for\r\n    the Improvement of the Working Classes, on the 7th March, at\r\n    Potsdam. My journey, previously intended, has been delayed by\r\n    all sorts of Dyke suits, and Game cases, so that I shall leave\r\n    here by the 28th at earliest. I am to be invested here with the\r\n    important office of Dyke Captain, and I have also considerable\r\n    chance of being elected to the Saxon (not the Dresden) Diet.\r\n    The acceptance of the first office would be decisive as to the\r\n    settlement of my residence—that is, here! There is no salary,\r\n    but the administration of the position is of importance to\r\n    Schönhausen and the other estates, inasmuch as it very much\r\n    depends upon this whether we may occasionally get under water\r\n    again or no. On the other hand, my friend ——, who is determined\r\n    to send me to East Prussia, pushes me hard to accept the office\r\n    there of H. M. Commissioner for Improvements. Bernhard urges\r\n    me, contrary to my expectation, to go to Prussia. I should like\r\n    to know what he thinks himself about it. He declares that by\r\n    taste and education I am made for Government service, and must\r\n    enter it, sooner or later. Greet Oscar, Detlev, Miss ——, and\r\n    the other children heartily, from your devoted brother,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    Schönhausen, 25th February, 1846.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    VIII.\r\n\r\n    _Dear Arnimen_,—I have within the few last days been obliged to\r\n    write so many letters, that I have only left by me one sheet,\r\n    stained with coffee, which I will not, however, deprive you of.\r\n    My existence here has not been the most agreeable. To make\r\n    inventories is tedious, particularly when the rascally valuer\r\n    has left one three times in the lurch for nothing, and one has\r\n    to wait in vain for several days. Besides this, I have lost a\r\n    considerable amount of corn by hail, on the 17th, and finally\r\n    I am suffering from a very annoying cough, although I have\r\n    drunk no wine since Angermünde, and have taken every precaution\r\n    against catching cold, can not complain of want of appetite,\r\n    and sleep like a badger. At the same time every one laughs at\r\n    me for my healthy looks, when I declare I am suffering from\r\n    the chest. To-morrow, at noon, I will visit Redekin, the next\r\n    day go to Magdeburg, and then, after a day or two’s sojourn,\r\n    throw myself immediately into your arms. I can not tell you of\r\n    any further news here, except that the grass was fourteen days\r\n    in advance, in comparison with Angermünde, and the crops, take\r\n    them altogether, very middling. The results of the inundation\r\n    are very annoyingly visible, I am sorry to say, in the garden.\r\n    Besides the many trees I took during the winter from the\r\n    plantation as useless, it now appears that all the other\r\n    acacias and the ashes are dried up, so that little remains;\r\n    seventeen of the limes at the lower end of the great avenue\r\n    are either dead or appear dying visibly. I shall have those\r\n    showing a leaf anywhere topped, and see whether this operation\r\n    will save them. In fruit trees, and especially plums, there has\r\n    been a considerable loss. In the fields, and more particularly\r\n    in the meadows, there are many places in which the grass has\r\n    not grown, because the upper vegetative soil has been washed\r\n    away. The Bellins and the rest of the Schönhausers send their\r\n    respects; the former suffer much from to-day’s heat. Sultan not\r\n    less. Thermometer 21° (68° Fahr.) in the shade. Many greetings\r\n    to Oscar. Your consumptive brother,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n    Schönhausen, 22d July, 1846.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this year Bismarck obtained his first decoration, for\r\nmany years the only one which graced his breast, but which he wears to\r\nthis day beside the stars of the highest Orders of Christendom. In the\r\nsummer of 1842, he was on duty as Cavalry Officer with the Stargard\r\nLandwehr Squadron of Uhlans, in exercise at Lippehne, in the Neumark, and\r\none afternoon was standing with other officers on the bridge over the\r\nlake, when his groom Hildebrand, the son of the forester on his estate,\r\nrode one of the horses to water and for a bath in the lake, close by the\r\nbridge. Suddenly the horse lost footing, and as the terrified horseman\r\nclung tight to the bridle, it fell, and Hildebrand disappeared in the\r\nwater. A terrible cry of horror resounded; Bismarck threw off his sword\r\nin an instant, tore off his uniform, and dashed headlong into the lake to\r\nsave his servant. By great good fortune he seized him, but the man clung\r\nto him so fast in his death agony, that he had to dive before he could\r\nloose himself from him. The crowd stood in horror on the shore; master\r\nand servant were both given up for lost—bubbles rose to the surface,\r\nbut the powerful swimmer had succeeded in releasing himself from the\r\ndeadly embrace of the drowning man; he rose to the surface, raising his\r\nservant with him. He also brought him safely to land, of course in an\r\ninanimate condition; but Hildebrand soon recovered, and the following\r\nday was well. This little town, some of the inhabitants of which had\r\nwitnessed the brave rescue, was in great commotion; they expressed their\r\nfeelings by the Superintendent meeting the noble rescuer in full official\r\ndress, and wishing him happiness for the mercy of the Almighty. Hence he\r\nobtained the simple medallion “for rescue from danger,” the well-known\r\nPrussian Safety Medal, which may be seen beside so many exalted stars on\r\nthe breast of the Minister-President. Bismarck is proud of this mark of\r\nhonor, and when on one occasion a noble diplomatist, perhaps not without\r\na tinge of satire, asked him the meaning of this modest decoration, then\r\nhis only one, he at once replied: “I am in the habit sometimes of saving\r\na man’s life!” The diplomatist abased his eyes before the stern look\r\nwhich accompanied the lightly spoken words of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1843, Lieutenant von Bismarck sought and obtained\r\npermission from the Landwehr Battalion of Stargard to enter the 4th\r\nUhlans (now the 1st Pomeranian Regiment, Uhlans, No. 4), then in garrison\r\nat Treptow and Greiffenberg, and do some months’ duty. Bismarck certainly\r\naimed, when he entered this regiment, to serve as an officer in the\r\nactive army, and to become acquainted with the regular routine of duty,\r\nalthough he did not say so, and allowed the officers of Uhlans to believe\r\nthat he had only been induced by their agreeable society to join them.\r\nIt is true he lived with them as a comrade, and often entertained them,\r\nalmost every Saturday, as his guests at Kniephof; but they had frequently\r\nbeen his guests before, and afterwards they became so constantly.\r\nThe Regimental Commandant, at that time, of the 4th Uhlans, was\r\nLieutenant-Colonel von Plehwe, who fell in a duel as General, a person\r\nwell known in many circles, and of a very distinguished character. Plehwe\r\nwas one of the few important men, without an idea of what there was “in”\r\nthe wild Landwehr Lieutenant, who joined his regiment in so strange\r\na manner, for he did not know how to deal with Bismarck in any way.\r\nHalf-way between Treptow, where the staff of the regiment was quartered,\r\nand Greiffenberg, where Bismarck lay, was a rendezvous known as “The\r\nGolden Dog” (_Zum Goldenen Mops_); to this place the severe Regimental\r\nCommandant was accustomed to summon the officers of Greiffenberg when\r\nhe wanted to treat them to—compliments, or rather the very opposite to\r\ncompliments. Oh! how often did Lieutenant von Bismarck ride to “The\r\nGolden Dog” upon his Caleb!\r\n\r\nCaleb was Bismarck’s favorite charger; a dark chestnut, not very\r\nhandsome, but a good hunter; the warmer the work the more furious his\r\npace. Caleb has carried his master at such speed impossible to relate\r\nwithout being supposed guilty of fabulation; but these rides were\r\nnevertheless true, according to the most credible witnesses. It was Caleb\r\nwho bore Bismarck on that wild ride when the stirrup flew up to the\r\nepaulet. How it happened, who can tell?—but the fact is sure.\r\n\r\nAlthough Von Plehwe may have summoned Lieutenant von Bismarck a few\r\ntimes too often to “The Golden Dog,” although he may have been commanded\r\nto appear in full regimentals on more occasions than was necessary,\r\nBismarck even now tells his former comrades in the 4th Uhlans, “I spent\r\na very pleasant time with you!” He still chuckles with satisfaction\r\nat the little practical joke when, in company with other officers, he\r\nseated himself, smoking a cigar, on the bench before the Burgomaster of\r\nTreptow’s house. This official was an enemy of tobacco, and officers\r\nwere even then forbidden to smoke in the streets. It was in vain that\r\nthe Burgomaster, who in other things was a very excellent man, informed\r\nthem that it was no hotel, but the Burgomaster’s house; Bismarck remained\r\nimmovable, until the severe Commandant appeared in full uniform, and\r\nraised the tobacco blockade.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1844, there was a dinner-party at the\r\nhouse of the youthful Frau von Blanckenburg, at Cardemin in Pomerania.\r\nThis pious and intellectual lady—born a Von Thadden-Triglaff—had great\r\ninfluence over Bismarck, and had confirmed the ancient family friendship\r\nbetween the Blanckenburgs and the Bismarcks. After dinner four gentlemen\r\nsat in the Red Saloon under the lamp, who were to meet again after many\r\nyears, although in different positions, but still fighting on the same\r\nside. Next to the host, the retired Examiner, Moritz von Blanckenburg,\r\nsat Otto von Bismarck, then in the same official position; beside the\r\nlatter, Major von Roon, whose cradle was also in Pomerania; and, last,\r\nDr. Theodor Beutner, since 1855 editor-in-chief of the “New Prussian\r\nGazette,” popularly known as the _Kreuzzeitung_, from the cross on the\r\ntitle-leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBETROTHAL AND MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n[1847.]\r\n\r\n    Falls in Love.—Johanna von Putkammer.—Marriage.—Meets King\r\n    Frederick William IV.—Birth of his First Child.—Schönhausen and\r\n    Kniephof with a New Mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the society and at the house of his friend and neighbor, Moritz von\r\nBlanckenburg, Bismarck had often seen a friend of his noble hostess, who\r\ngreatly interested him. But he first became more intimately acquainted\r\nwith Fräulein Johanna von Putkammer on a trip which both of them made\r\nin company with the Blanckenburgs. Bismarck soon became aware of the\r\naffection he felt for the young lady, but he naturally found many\r\nobstacles in learning—as may be readily understood—whether his affection\r\nwas returned by her. This would easily explain the inquietude of his\r\nbehavior, for even when assured of his attachment being returned, there\r\nwere still many difficulties to be surmounted.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the reputation which “Mad Bismarck” had won\r\nfor himself among the elder ladies and gentlemen in Pomerania. The\r\nconsternation and horror may easily be imagined, in which the quiet\r\nChristian house of Herr von Putkammer was plunged, on the receipt of a\r\nletter in which Bismarck directly and frankly asked for the hand of his\r\ndaughter. But how much greater must have been his horror when the gentle\r\ndaughter of the house, in a modest but firm manner, acknowledged her\r\naffection! “It seemed as if I had been felled with an axe!” old Herr von\r\nPutkammer said, in describing his feelings at that time, in a drastic\r\ntone. Even the story of the wolf, which always devours the meekest lambs,\r\ndid not console him. However, he was far removed from playing the tyrant\r\nfather, and he gave his consent, although with a heavy heart—a consent he\r\nhas never had reason to regret. Her mother, of a more spirited nature,\r\nprotested until Bismarck appeared in person at Reinfeld, and before her\r\neyes clasped his bride to his heart. With a flood of passionate tears,\r\nshe then consented to their union, and from that moment became the\r\nwarmest and most zealous friend of the man to whom she gave her beloved\r\ndaughter after so severe a struggle. Under the motto “All right,”[33]\r\nBismarck announces the fact to his sister, his “Arnimen.”\r\n\r\nBetween this betrothal and his marriage falls Bismarck’s first appearance\r\nat the first United Diet.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, 1847, Otto von Bismarck-Schönhausen married Johanna\r\nFrederica Charlotte Dorothea Eleonore von Putkammer, born on the 11th of\r\nApril, 1824, the only daughter of Herr Henry Ernst Jacob von Putkammer,\r\nof Kartlum, and the Lady Luitgarde, born Von Glasenapp of Reinfeld.\r\n\r\nOn the journey which Bismarck took after the wedding with his young wife\r\nthrough Switzerland and Italy, he accidentally met his King Frederick\r\nWilliam IV., at Venice. He was at once commanded to attend at the\r\nroyal dinner-table, and his royal master conversed with him for a long\r\ntime in a gracious manner, particularly concerning German politics, a\r\nconversation not, perhaps, without its influence on the subsequent and\r\nvery sudden appointment of Bismarck to the post of Ambassador to the\r\nFederation; but it unquestionably laid the foundation for the favor with\r\nwhich King Frederick William IV. always regarded Bismarck. For the rest,\r\nhe was so unprepared to meet his king and master at Venice, that he had\r\nnot even had time to take with him a court suit, and was obliged to\r\nappear before his sovereign in borrowed clothes, which, considering his\r\nstature, must have fitted him very badly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBismarck now set up his domestic hearth at the old stone mansion of\r\nSchönhausen. There, where his cradle once stood, in the following year\r\nstood that of his eldest child, his daughter Marie; and though his actual\r\nresidence in Schönhausen only lasted a few years, he took with him his\r\ndomestic happiness thence to Berlin, Frankfurt, and St. Petersburg.\r\nNominally Schönhausen continued to be his residence until he became\r\nMinister-President; and though he now prefers to live on his Pomeranian\r\nestates to those in the Alt Mark, during his days of retirement, this\r\ndoes not occur from any want of affection for his old home, but from a\r\nfeeling of delicacy towards his father-in-law, now a venerable man almost\r\neighty years of age, but still fresh and hale, who lives in the vicinity\r\nof Varzin, and also because he finds in Pomerania three things for which\r\nhe would seek in vain at Schönhausen. The forest is not at Schönhausen\r\nclose round the house, as at Varzin, for at Schönhausen he has an hour’s\r\nride to reach the wood, and the forest he loves as an old friend. The\r\ngame about Schönhausen is also almost entirely destroyed, and the heavy\r\nwheat soil there is either flat and hard, or cloddy, and therefore little\r\nfitted for riding. Bismarck, as he ever was, remains a great horseman and\r\na zealous sportsman.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Bismarck has been blessed with three children—Mary\r\nElizabeth Johanna, born the 21st August, 1848, at Schönhausen; Nicolas\r\nFerdinand Herbert, born the 28th December, 1849, at Berlin; William Otto\r\nAlbert, born the 1st August, 1852, at Frankfurt-on-the-Maine.\r\n\r\nAmidst the severe battles of a time so rife in immeasurable\r\ncontradictions, Bismarck commenced his family life in a simple but\r\nsubstantial manner, as befitting a nobleman of the Alt Mark or Pomerania;\r\nand so he has been able to maintain himself even at the elevation at\r\nwhich God the Almighty has placed him for the good of his native country.\r\nThat he may ever maintain it is the aspiration of every patriot, for in\r\nhim the fountain ever freshly runs, whence he draws continual renovation\r\nfor the service of his King and country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Third.\r\n\r\nLEARNING THE BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEARNING THE BUSINESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n“UT SCIAT REGNARE.”\r\n\r\n    Bismarck’s Policy.—Its Gradual Growth and Political\r\n    Character.—Contrast with Lucchesini.—Bismarck’s Open\r\n    Honesty.—Vassal and Liege.—Liberalism a Danger.—Democracy a\r\n    Danger.—The Relative Positions of Prussia and Austria in the\r\n    Federation.—Gerlach’s Ideal Conservatism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck has now to be politically tested, and amidst all the strange\r\neventualities in the remarkable history of Prussia, we perceive, first\r\nas a counsellor, then as an actor, and finally as a guide, that the one\r\nman emerges, a man ever the same, yet ever appearing to change. Otto von\r\nBismarck is best to be compared to a tree, which continues the same,\r\nalthough gaining in height and strength by growth; whose lofty top, with\r\nits wide-spreading leaves, alters its appearance at each new spring, to\r\na greater or lesser degree; it remains the same, even if the wind bends\r\nthe trunk, despite its toughest power of resistance, slightly aside; an\r\nimperfect twig may be broken off by the storm, or a heavy rain-fall may\r\nbare one of the deep roots, and abandon the growing power a prize to the\r\neffects of the breeze and the sun.\r\n\r\nThe altered appearance which Bismarck at different times has presented,\r\nhas blinded many eyes; many thought he had grown into another man, as he\r\npresented himself ever stronger, mightier, and of greater stature! Of\r\ncourse, he has long since become too great, too strong, and too mighty\r\nfor his opponents, and some have found, in a manner not so entirely\r\nagreeable, the influence of the wide-spreading tree with its potent\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nThere have certainly been alterations in the man, but none of them\r\ninconsistent with the growth of the tree. The simile may not be accurate,\r\nbut it indicates the truth. Bismarck has himself pointed out the changes\r\nwhich he has undergone very much better by the modest sentence, “I have\r\nlearnt something!” Perhaps he did not always learn the best, but he has\r\nlearnt more than many who now turn maliciously from him, because they\r\ncould not keep step with him; some others, also, because they would not.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Guizot the expression of the same thought, so moderately\r\nphrased by Bismarck, in the pointed French remark, “_L’homme absurde seul\r\nne change pas!_” The word, however, is somewhat suspicious in the mouth\r\nof the French statesman, for its utterance is _pro domo_, as an excuse\r\nfor various political apostasies.\r\n\r\nNow, in Bismarck there is no trace of apostasy throughout his political\r\nlife, and perhaps in no statesman can an enduring political principle\r\nbe more easily discovered, and followed into detail—if we only\r\nadhere to facts, and do not allow ourselves to be diverted by absurd\r\nmisinterpretations of his words, the diatribes of political opposition,\r\nor the hollow declamation of foolish party babblers.\r\n\r\nThis is the more easy, as Bismarck is precisely the opposite of one of\r\nhis predecessors in the Foreign Office of Prussia. The cunning of the\r\nMarquis of Lucchesini,[34] a predecessor of Bismarck, had become so\r\nwell known, so proverbial, that none of his negotiations ever led to any\r\nthing, because whoever was representing the other side always commenced\r\nwith the conviction that Lucchesini would, in the end, outwit him. A\r\ncertain degree of confidence, however inconsiderable, is necessary on\r\nboth sides, if political arrangements are to end in results. Bismarck,\r\non the other hand, is a thoroughly honest politician—honest to such a\r\ndegree that his political adversary is sometimes puzzled, and suspects\r\nsome snare in his very openness. Bismarck is a thoroughly honest man, who\r\nscorns every intentional deception on the part of his opponents.\r\n\r\nWe are well aware that this assertion will be met in many circles\r\nwith scornful contradiction; but it is nevertheless true, and we will\r\ndemonstrate the proposition. But they also err, who may perhaps believe\r\nthat we are of opinion that we have, in this, said something flattering\r\nto the Minister-President; we merely acknowledge that this honesty has\r\nbeen implanted in the nature of Bismarck by the Almighty, that it could\r\nnot but develop itself and become a sustaining principle; but such\r\nacknowledgment does not constitute flattery.\r\n\r\nBismarck rode into the political lists in 1847 as a courageous, sensible,\r\nand honorable man, and has held his place in the arena for more than\r\ntwenty years as a loyal champion of the King, both in single combat and\r\ngeneral battle. He has made mistakes in his innumerable contests, but he\r\nhas learnt from them, has gallantly paid in person, and never concealed\r\nor denied his colors or insignia.\r\n\r\nEven the most furious opponents of these colors and insignia can not deny\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWe have not used the simile of the knightly tournament unadvisedly, for\r\nthe whole political faith of Bismarck is founded on a chivalric idea,\r\nin the deep immovable conviction of his personal position towards the\r\nPrussian sovereignty. The ultimate foundation of Bismarck’s political\r\naction consists in his personal position as an Alt Mark vassal and\r\nnobleman to his liege lord, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the King of\r\nPrussia. It will be understood that this position is the ultimate, but\r\nnot precisely the only one; it is only the least, but also the inmost\r\ncircle, whence the other principles around him have evolved themselves,\r\naccording to his consciousness. As the liegeman stood in personal\r\nrelation to his lord, so the deputy stood to the King, and the relation\r\nto the Regent was analogous to the relation of the Minister-President\r\nand Chancellor of the Diet to the King and Chief of the North German\r\nFederation. From this strong consciousness of the moral connection of\r\nhis own person with that of the sovereign, his liege, Bismarck’s whole\r\npolitical acts arise and may be discerned.\r\n\r\nKing William is, however, aware of the construction which Bismarck places\r\nupon their inter-relations, and in this, on the one hand, lies the\r\nstrength, on the other the weakness, of the position held by Bismarck, as\r\nchief counsellor of the King. This hint may here suffice.\r\n\r\nAnd if we now contemplate, from this point of view, the whole political\r\nlife of Bismarck—his speeches, his letters, his dispatches and\r\nordinances, the result of his exertions everywhere, from the beginning\r\nuntil now—what do we find? The same loyal Brandenburg statesman,\r\nwho, in chivalrous and liege faith, has grown greater in courage and\r\nself-sacrifice; learning more how to perform his functions as year by\r\nyear has passed away; with greater self-possession and good-humor before\r\nthe throne of his monarch; before that throne, in his conception, the\r\nbulwark of Prussia and Germany, and defended by him with equal zeal\r\nagainst inward detractors and outward foes.\r\n\r\nAt the first United Diet, in the year 1847, he was impressed with the\r\nidea that liberalism might endanger the throne of his liege; it was not a\r\nperfect conviction, but the daring phrase roused him; he supposed he saw\r\ndanger, and he instantly showed a firm front to it.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was but little acquainted with the use of parliamentary\r\nweapons; his opponents were far more experienced in eloquence than\r\nhimself, and he stood, as it were, almost alone before a multitude; for\r\nthose of his own opinions, with the exception of the two Manteuffels,\r\nperhaps, were still less experienced speakers than he; but the bravery\r\nwith which he encountered the word “liberal” deserved all praise. The\r\nbold attitude with which he entered the arena revealed to his opponents\r\nthat the unknown Dyke Captain from the banks of the Elbe was not a man to\r\nbe undervalued by them; this they did not do; and the fierce irony with\r\nwhich they, with more or less talent, overwhelmed him, betrayed the fact\r\nthat in this Junker the Crown had found a mighty defender.\r\n\r\nWhen the second United Diet took place, the enemy of the kingdom was no\r\nlonger liberalism, but democracy, and Bismarck met this foe with the\r\nmost unhesitating conviction. But the nobleman who honors in the King of\r\nPrussia his liege lord, is by no means the Aga, or Pasha, of an Oriental\r\nSultan, blindly obedient and adoring. The manly words of Bismarck were a\r\nrebuke, not only to the low, but the high.\r\n\r\nIn 1849-’51 Bismarck occupied a position in the Diet, as one of the chief\r\nleaders of the Conservative party against democracy. He entered into\r\nthe strife with ardor, both at Berlin and Erfurt; wherever he saw the\r\nsovereignty of Prussia assailed, he sprang to the breach with decision.\r\nHe seemed to have a fine intuition for every thing hostile to his beloved\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nWhen Ambassador at Frankfurt to the Federation, he at once recognized\r\nthe impending ruin of Prussia to consist in the false position she there\r\noccupied, and he arrived at the conviction that the jealousy of Austria\r\nwould strive to retain Prussia in this position, and not only that, but\r\nwould employ itself in active measures, by which it should end in the\r\nfinal destruction of Germany. He therefore resolved upon opposition to\r\nAustria. This was not a very easy task; the compact between Prussia and\r\nAustria had descended to him from his fathers as a sacred tradition. He\r\nwould readily have held out his hand, he would have desired earnestly to\r\nremain true to tradition; nor did he remit in attempts and offers, until\r\nhe knew that there was a change coming over the policy of Austria not\r\ntending to the good of Prussia and Germany. He then changed with military\r\nprecision. The vassal approached with full front before the throne of\r\nhis liege, even against Austria. He did not do it secretly, but openly\r\nand honestly; every one might be able to tell how it fared with him\r\neverywhere. He defined his position in writing from Frankfurt, from St.\r\nPetersburg, from Paris, both by his own hand and by that of others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd when, in 1862, he entered upon the conflict inherited by him from the\r\nnew era, the result of the thorny fight, at the head of the government,\r\nit was the mightiness of the kingdom, the position of his liege lord, for\r\nwhich he fought for years with body and soul against the pretensions of\r\nthe parliamentary spirit, with glorious devotion and tough Brandenburg\r\ntenacity.\r\n\r\nThe interior defense of the Prussian monarchy, in its inherent integrity,\r\nthe rehabilitation of the liberty of Germany, so important for its own\r\nsafety, and a dignified attitude towards foreign nations, constitute the\r\nunity of the policy of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nLiberalism, democracy, the inimical jealousy of Austria, the envy\r\nof foreign nations, with its train of parliamentary spirit and\r\nspecialisms—such are the enemies of the Prussian sovereignty; and\r\nBismarck has, with equal courage and firmness, with as much insight as\r\nsuccess, fought openly and honestly against these. And if all outward\r\nsymptoms do not deceive us, he is now powerfully preparing against\r\nanother great foe of real sovereignty—that is, bureaucracy, still lying\r\narmed to the teeth behind the Table of Green Cloth as its stronghold.\r\n\r\nIn these different contests it is quite possible that Bismarck may often\r\nhave erred; he may not immediately have found the right weapons, and he\r\nmay also not have employed them in the proper localities. It is certain\r\nthere is much to blame, much to deplore; but accept him in all that is\r\ngreat and real, then most persons will voluntarily bow before the man,\r\nwho, for twenty years, has fought so great a battle, with visor down,\r\nwithout false deceit or any kind of malice. Nor has the man earned his\r\nhard victories without having had to pay for them.\r\n\r\nBismarck has not destroyed the enemies of the Prussian monarchy; this\r\nis in the power of no man—nor perhaps was it within the sphere of his\r\nintentions; but he has subdued them, and in greater or lesser proportion\r\nmade them serviceable to the interests of the Crown.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief difficulties in his political action is, on the one\r\nhand to discipline these elements which so very unwillingly serve the\r\nPrussian monarchy, and on the other to spare the perfectly intelligible\r\nsensitiveness of ancient fidelity, and to conquer the readily understood\r\nwant of confidence of his own old coadjutors in the gay ranks of his new\r\nallies. He is thus met with the idealistic conservatism of Gerlach, whose\r\norgan was the “Neue Preussische Zeitung” for so many years. Gerlach’s\r\nprincipal service consisted in the actual formation of a political\r\nconservative party in Prussia—an idealism long revered by Bismarck, but\r\ncertainly not to be contained within its own bounds when opposed to those\r\ndemands which are made on a guiding statesman by the hard necessities\r\nof daily life. The old conservative party of Prussia has made great\r\nsacrifices, and is making them daily; but she makes them to the glorious\r\nkingdom of Prussia, and it is a high honor to be the regnant party when a\r\nBismarck is the King’s first councillor. And, indeed, is it possible for\r\nthe conservative party to be otherwise than the reigning party in Prussia?\r\n\r\nThe tried Prussian patriotism of the conservatives will not allow\r\nitself to be disconnected by details from the great statesman who has\r\nemerged from their ranks; they know that Bismarck not only is frequently\r\ncompelled to pour his new wine into old bottles, but also to pour his old\r\nwine into new bottles. The good is not always the enemy of the better,\r\nbut sometimes the bridge to the best and highest. The lightning does\r\nnot pursue the course where it finds the best conductor, but that in\r\nwhich the sum of conduction is the most powerful. Bismarck’s real policy\r\nconsists in forcing parties unwilling to do so, to work and strive for\r\nthe monarchy. In royal Prussia no party can any longer exist with the\r\nobject of weakening the royal power. There will always continue to be a\r\nnumber of those whose efforts are more or less openly directed to such an\r\nend; but no party dare, as such, to acknowledge such an aim.\r\n\r\nIf we, then, see the unity of Bismarck’s policy to consist in the defense\r\nof the sovereignty, it might almost seem as if this policy were of a\r\nnegative character; but this is only apparent, for such a defense leads\r\nto positive creations, although at first sight they may appear as mighty\r\nbeginnings—such as the North German Confederation—and are not all so\r\nevident to the eye, as may be seen on the map of the kingdom of Prussia\r\nsince 1866.\r\n\r\nWe shall now accompany Bismarck to the Assembly of the Three Estates of\r\nthe first United Diet, then from battle-field to battle-field at Berlin,\r\nat Erfurt, and at Frankfurt, until those of Königgrätz and Nicolsburg,\r\nand still farther, for the great contest is not yet fought out—the last\r\nvictory is not won. The statesman whom God will yet awaken to enter upon\r\nthe inheritance of Bismarck, and continue his work, will find new and\r\nmighty armor, the creation of King William and Bismarck, in which to\r\nencounter the enemy with the ancient Prussian war-cry, “_Mit Gott für\r\nKönig und Vaterland!_”—“With God for King and Country!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLY OF THE THREE ESTATES.\r\n\r\n[1847.]\r\n\r\n    The February Constitution.—Merseberg.—First Appearance of\r\n    Bismarck in the White Saloon.—Von Saucken.—Bismarck’s First\r\n    Speech.—Conservatives and Liberals.—The First of June.—Jewish\r\n    Emancipation.—Illusions Destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen King Frederick William IV. issued the February manifesto, in\r\n1847,[35] and summoned the United Diet with the Chambers, he thought in\r\nhis royal great-heartedness to have accorded to his people a free gift of\r\nhis affection and his confidence, and to have anticipated many wishes;\r\nbut close behind the rejoicings which welcomed the patent of February,\r\nthere lay the bitterest disenchantment for the noble King.\r\n\r\nThe honorable old royalists of Prussia, who had been educated and had\r\ngrown up in the honest Prussian absolutism of Frederick William III.,\r\nfirst looked with suspicion at this new royal gift; they could not at\r\nall understand why their own King of Prussia should have thought it\r\nnecessary to summon a Parliament somewhat on the model of England, and\r\nthey foresaw all sorts of evils in the future, as they thoughtfully\r\nshook their gray and honored heads. To these men, who at that time were\r\nstill very numerous, and whose influence was considerable, succeeded\r\nthose who certainly felt that the abuses of bureaucracy were no longer\r\ncurable by patriarchal absolutism, but who still thought that the King,\r\nby this measure, had conceded the very utmost possible in that direction.\r\nThey saw in the patent the last fortress of the monarchy which must be\r\nheld against liberalism at any cost. In opposition to these royalists,\r\nthe host of liberals unfolded their gay banner in different columns.\r\nThey only could see in the February patent the starting-point of a\r\nfurther movement, which, founded on the patent, might transform the\r\nabsolute state into a modern constitutional monarchy. There existed even\r\nindividuals who perceived that the patent would prove an obstacle to\r\ntheir revolutionary tendencies, and desired to refuse its acceptance.\r\n\r\nWe will not criticise these parties, but it is certain that none of them\r\nregarded the patent in the spirit of the royal donor—unless perhaps some\r\nwho had understood that the King, basing his action on the existing\r\nProvincial Assemblies, proposed in a similar manner to erect a peculiar\r\nPrussian Representative Monarchy. They beheld the February patent to be\r\nno final measure, but the beginning of States Government, which could\r\nonly develop itself under specially favorable circumstances, and in\r\ncourse of time.\r\n\r\nBismarck was one of the men who, although without absolutely expressing\r\nthe opinion, regarded the patent as the starting-point of a new order\r\nof things, in common with the liberals, but not in the sense of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy, but comprehended it, as the King did, as a step\r\ntowards a peculiar and specifically Prussian State Government.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon Provincial Diet at Merseburg had chosen the Dyke Captain\r\nand First Lieutenant von Brauchitsch of Scharteuke, in the Circle of\r\nJerichow, as Deputy at the United Diet, and had selected Dyke Captain von\r\nBismarck of Schönhausen as his representative. As Herr von Brauchitsch\r\nwas very ill, his representative was summoned.\r\n\r\nBismarck appeared in the White Saloon of the Royal Palace at Cölln on\r\nthe Spree, where the Three Estates’ Assembly held its Sessions, as a\r\nrepresentative of the Knight’s Estate of Jerichow, and a vassal and\r\nchivalric servitor of the King. He was at that time, however, as liberal\r\nas most of his associates; liberalism then floated in the air and was\r\ninhaled; it was impossible to avoid it. Against many abuses it was also\r\njustifiable; hence its mighty influence.\r\n\r\nA conservative party, in the sense in which we wish it to be understood,\r\ndid not then exist; nor did the general confusion of opinions at the\r\ntime allow of the formation of true parties. It is true that Bismarck\r\nmet many men in the White Saloon, whose opinions were well known to him;\r\nof these were his brother, the Landrath, his cousins, the Counts von\r\nBismarck-Bohlen and von Bismarck-Briest, his future father-in-law, Herr\r\nvon Putkammer, von Thadden, von Wedell, and many others—but unfortunately\r\nthese gentlemen in general, as Herr von Thadden once bluntly said of\r\nhimself, were not even bad orators, but no orators at all. Nor could the\r\ntwo Freiherrs von Manteuffel contend in eloquence with the brilliant\r\nrhetoricians of the liberals, such as Freiherr von Vincke, Camphausen,\r\nMevissen, Beckerath, and others.\r\n\r\nVery few persons now exist who can read those speeches of the First\r\nUnited Diet, once so celebrated, without a melancholy or satirical smile:\r\nthose were the blossom-days of liberal phraseology, causing an enthusiasm\r\nof which we can not now form any adequate idea.\r\n\r\nThey acted with such an influence upon Bismarck, but he was soon sobered,\r\nwhen he attained the conviction that these great speakers, moved by their\r\nconstruction of the patent of February, advocated an end not contemplated\r\nby the spirit of the patent. To him it did not seem honest to contend for\r\nmodern constitutionalism upon the judicial merits of the February patent,\r\nagainst its sense and spirit.\r\n\r\nAn inimical inspiration acted on him in liberal phraseology, and the more\r\nmagnificent the oratory, the more repugnant it became to him, especially\r\nwhere he saw untruth clearly in view. He employed some time in making\r\nit evident to himself that the liberal idea was the very fact under the\r\ngovernment of which men, otherwise of great honor, in the very best\r\nof faith, brought forward matters in themselves quite false; and the\r\ndeepest want of confidence then made itself master of his mind. He began\r\nto understand how dangerous a power so intangible might become to the\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nAt the sitting of the Three Estates on the 17th May, the Deputy von\r\nSaucken made one of those wordy enthusiastic speeches at that time so\r\npopular, and declared that the Prussian people had risen in the year 1813\r\nfor the sole end of obtaining a constitution. This had previously been\r\nasserted by Beckerath and others on several occasions.\r\n\r\nAfter the liberal speaker had descended amidst the plaudits of the\r\nAssembly, the Deputy Bismarck, for the first time, appeared upon the\r\ntribune. His stature was great, his plentiful hair was cut short, his\r\nhealthily ruddy countenance was fringed by a strong blond beard, his\r\nshining eyes were somewhat prominent, _à fleur de tête_, as the French\r\nidiom has it—such was his aspect. He gazed upon the assembly for a\r\nmoment, and then spoke simply, but with some hesitation, in a strong,\r\nsometimes shrill voice, with not altogether pleasing emphasis:—“For me it\r\nis difficult—after a speech replete with such noble enthusiasm—to address\r\nyou, in order to bring before you a plain re-statement.” He then glanced\r\nat some length at the real merits of a previous vote, and continued in\r\nthe following words:—\r\n\r\n“To discuss the remaining points of the speech, I prefer to choose a time\r\nwhen it will be necessary to enter upon questions of policy; at present\r\nI am compelled to contradict what is stated from this tribune, as well\r\nas what is so loudly and so frequently asserted outside this hall, in\r\nreference to the necessity for a constitution, as if the movements of our\r\nnation in 1813 should be ascribed to other causes and motives than those\r\nof the tyranny exercised by the foreigner in our land.”\r\n\r\nHere the speaker was assailed with such loud marks of disapprobation,\r\nhisses, and outcries, that he could no longer make himself\r\nintelligible. He quietly drew a newspaper from his pocket—it was the\r\n“Spenersche Zeitung”—and read it, leaning in an easy attitude, until\r\nthe President-Marshal had restored order; he then concluded, still\r\ninterrupted by hisses, with these words:—“In my opinion it is doing\r\nsorry service to the national honor, to conclude that ill-treatment and\r\nhumiliation suffered by Prussia at the hands of a foreign ruler would not\r\nbe enough to rouse Prussian blood, and cause all other feelings to be\r\nabsorbed by the hatred of foreigners.”\r\n\r\nAmidst great commotion Bismarck left the tribune, ten or twelve voices\r\nbeing clamorous to be heard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bismarck in 1847-1848.]\r\n\r\nIt is not intelligible to us at the present day, how the casual\r\nstatement of a simple opinion, which, even had it been untrue, need have\r\noffended no one, could raise such a storm. Nor had Bismarck personally\r\noffended any one, but he had protested against liberalism, and at once\r\nthe Mamelukes of this most evil despot pounced upon him—upon this\r\nunfortunate member of the chivalry of the province of Saxony. The elder\r\ngentlemen were especially offended, who had voluntarily taken the field\r\nin 1813, and had now attributed the motive they thought then actuated\r\nthem, and perhaps they really entertained, to the nation. It was curious,\r\ntoo, that they flatly denied the right of criticism to this member, on\r\nthe ground that he was not in existence in those great days. When, with\r\nloud clamor, these gentlemen had given vent to their moral indignation,\r\nBismarck again ascended the tribune; but the anger of the liberals was\r\nso great that the Marshal had to use all his authority to protect him\r\nduring his speech.\r\n\r\nBismarck now spoke fluently, in the manner since so familiar to us, but\r\ncoldly and sarcastically: “I can certainly not deny that I did not as yet\r\nexist in those days, and I am truly sorry not to have been permitted to\r\ntake part in that movement; my regret for this is certainly diminished\r\nby the explanations I have received just now upon the movements of that\r\nepoch. I always thought the servitude against which the sword was then\r\nused was a foreign servitude; I now learn that it lay at home. For this\r\ncorrection I am not by any means grateful!”\r\n\r\nThe hisses of the liberals were now met by many voices with “Hear, hear!”\r\nFrom this moment the hatred of the press was concentrated upon Bismarck;\r\nbeing without exception in the hands of the liberals, it governed public\r\nopinion entirely, and it assailed Bismarck even more unscrupulously and\r\nunconscientiously than it had attacked Von Thadden and Von Manteuffel.\r\nAs contradiction was impossible, the world probably thought Bismarck\r\nwas still one of the wild Junkers who, armed to the teeth in steel,\r\nconsidered village tyranny and dissoluteness to be the best kind of\r\nconstitution, and in deep political ignorance was still standing at about\r\nthe mental mark of Dietrich von Quitzow,[36] or at the most of one of the\r\nJunkers of the time of Frederick I. The liberal press certainly succeeded\r\nin producing a caricature of Bismarck, composed of a kind of a black bogy\r\nand a ridiculous bugbear; the latter they were speedily obliged to drop,\r\nbut the bogy they have the more firmly retained, and frightened political\r\nbabies with it until very recent days.\r\n\r\nNo one has any idea at the present time how the liberal press of those\r\ndays assailed men who were obnoxious to them. In the year 1849, two\r\ngentlemen were introduced to each other in society; as ordinarily\r\nhappens, they mistook their several names on a hurried introduction.\r\nThe elder gentleman spoke in an intellectual, remarkable, exhaustive,\r\nand instructive manner concerning the affairs of Hungary, whence he\r\nhad recently returned, and showed himself to be a person of thought,\r\ninformation, and politeness. His interlocutor for a long time could\r\nnot believe that this was Herr von Thadden-Triglaff; the ridiculous\r\ncaricature the liberal press had sent broadcast into society of this\r\neminent and singular man was so firmly fixed in his convictions.\r\n\r\nWe have laid some emphasis on this point, as it forms an explanation of\r\nthe obstinate suspicion with which, for many after years, Bismarck was\r\nregarded by a section of the public. It is also plainly evident that the\r\nyoung politician often defended himself against this “world of scorn”\r\nwith equal and biting scorn, and covered himself with the shield of\r\ncontempt against mockery he did not deserve. He was continually assailed,\r\nsometimes in the rudest manner, and sometimes with poisonous acumen; and\r\nhe could not have been Bismarck had he borne it with patience.\r\n\r\nThus it befell that he soon found himself in full battle array against\r\nliberalism, and his speeches at the time show that he took a serious\r\nview of the matter. He gave utterance to his convictions and opinions\r\nin conformity with his natural fearless nature; he adhered closely to\r\nthe matter at issue, but the form in which he did so was that of the\r\nmost cutting attack, whetted in general by a cloud of contempt for his\r\nopponent, or of bitter ridicule.\r\n\r\nIn the debate of the Three Estates of the 1st of June, 1847, known as the\r\nPeriodicity Debate, Bismarck spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I will not take the trouble to examine the solidity of the various\r\ngrounds of right, on which each of us presumes himself to stand; but,\r\nI believe, it has become certain, from the debate and from every\r\nthing which I have gathered from the discussion of the question, that\r\na different construction and interpretation of the older estates\r\nlegislation was possible and practically existent—not among laymen only,\r\nbut also among weighty jurists—and that it would be very doubtful what\r\na court of justice, if such a question were before it, would decree\r\nconcerning it. Under such circumstances, the declaration would, according\r\nto general principles of law, afford a solution. This declaration has\r\nbecome implicit upon us, implicit by the patent of the 3d of February\r\nof this year; by this the King has declared that the general promises\r\nof former laws have been no other than those fulfilled by the present\r\nlaw. It appears that this declaration has been regarded by a portion\r\nof this Assembly as inaccurate, but such is a fate to which every\r\ndeclaration is equally subject. Every declaration is considered by\r\nthose whose opinions it does not confirm, to be wrong, or the previous\r\nconviction could not have been sincere. The question really is, in whom\r\nthe right resides to issue an authentic and legally binding declaration.\r\nIn my opinion, the King alone; and this conviction, I believe, lies in\r\nthe conscience of the people. For when yesterday an Honorable Deputy\r\nfrom Königsberg asserted that there was a dull dissatisfaction among\r\nthe people on the proclamation of the patent of the 3d of February, I\r\nmust reply, on the contrary, that I do not find the majority of the\r\nPrussian nation represented in the meetings which take place in the\r\nBöttchershöfchen. (Murmurs.) In inarticulate sounds I really can not\r\ndiscover any refutation of what I have said, nor do I find it in the\r\ngoose-quills of the newspaper correspondents; no! not even in a fraction\r\nof the population of some of the large provincial towns. It is difficult\r\nto ascertain public opinion; I think I find it in some of the middle\r\nprovinces, and it is the old Prussian conviction that a royal word is\r\nworth more than all the constructions and quirks applied to the letter\r\nof the law. (Some voices: Bravo!) Yesterday a parallel was drawn between\r\nthe method employed by the English people in 1688, after the abdication\r\nof James II., for the preservation of its rights, and that by which\r\nthe Prussian nation should now attain a similar end. There is always\r\nsomething suspicious in parallels with foreign countries. Russia had\r\nbeen held up to us as a model of religious toleration; the French and\r\nDanish exchequers have been recommended as examples of proper finances.\r\nTo return to the year 1688 in England, I must really beg this august\r\nassembly, and especially an honorable deputy from Silesia, to pardon me\r\nif I again speak of a circumstance which I did not personally perceive.\r\nThe English people was then in a different position to that of the\r\nPrussian people now; a century of revolution and civil war had invested\r\nit with the right to dispose of a crown, and bind up with it conditions\r\naccepted by William of Orange. On the other hand, the Prussian sovereigns\r\nwere in possession of a crown, not by grace of the people, but by God’s\r\ngrace; an actually unconditional crown, some of the rights of which\r\nthey voluntarily conceded to the people—an example rare in history. I\r\nwill leave the question of right, and proceed to that concerning the\r\nutility and desirability of asking or suggesting any change in the\r\nlegislation as it actually now exists. I adhere to the conviction, which\r\nI assume to be that of the majority of the Assembly, that periodicity is\r\nnecessary to a real vitality of this Assembly; but it is another matter\r\nwhether we should seek this by way of petition. Since the emanation\r\nof the patent of the 3d of February, I do not believe that it would\r\nbe consonant with the royal pleasure, or that it is inherent with the\r\nposition of ourselves as estates, to approach His Majesty already with a\r\npetition for an amendment of it. At any rate let us allow the grass of\r\nthis summer to grow over it. The King has repeatedly said, that he did\r\nnot wish to be coerced and driven; but I ask the Assembly what should\r\nwe be doing otherwise than coercing and driving him, if we already\r\napproached the throne with requests for changes in the legislation?\r\nTo the gravity of this view I ask permission of the Assembly to add\r\nanother reason. It is certainly well known how many sad predictions have\r\nbeen made by the opponents of our polity connected with the fact that\r\nthe Government would find itself forced by the estates into a position\r\nwhich it would not have willingly taken up. But although I do not assume\r\nthe Government would allow itself to be coerced, I still think that it\r\nis in the interests of the Government to avoid the slightest trace of\r\nunwillingness as to concessions, and that it is in all our interests not\r\nto concede to the enemies of Prussia the delight of witnessing the fact\r\nthat, by a petition—a vote—presented by us as the representatives of\r\nsixteen millions of subjects, we should throw a shade of unwillingness\r\nupon such a concession. It has been said that His Majesty the King and\r\nthe Commissioner of the Diet have themselves pointed out this path. For\r\n_myself_, I could not otherwise understand this than that, as the King\r\nhas done, so also the Commissioner of the Diet indicated this as the\r\nlegal way we should pursue in case we found ourselves aggrieved; but that\r\nit would be acceptable to His Majesty the King and the Government that\r\nwe should make use of this right, I have not been able to perceive. If,\r\nhowever, we did so, it would be believed that urgent grounds existed for\r\nit—that there was immediate danger in the future; but of this I can not\r\nconvince myself. The next session of the Assembly is assured; the Crown,\r\nalso, is thereby in the advantageous position, that within four years, or\r\neven a shorter period, it can with perfect voluntariness, and without\r\nasking, take the initiative as to that which is now desired. Now, I ask,\r\nis not the edifice of our State firmer towards foreign countries?—will\r\nnot the feeling of satisfaction be greater at home, if the continuation\r\nof our national polity be inaugurated by the initiative of the Crown,\r\nthan by petition from ourselves? Should the Crown not find it good to\r\ntake the initiative, no time is lost. The third Diet will not follow so\r\nrapidly upon the second, that the King would have no time to reply to a\r\npetition presented under such circumstances by the second. Yesterday a\r\ndeputy from Prussia—I think from the circle of Neustadt—uttered a speech\r\nwhich I could only comprehend as meaning that it was our interest to pull\r\nup the flower of confidence as a weed preventing us from seeing the bare\r\nground, and cast it out. I say with pride that I can not agree with such\r\nan opinion. If I look back for ten years, and compare that which was\r\nwritten and said in the year 1837 with that which is proclaimed from the\r\nsteps of the throne to the whole nation, I believe we have great reason\r\nto have confidence in the intentions of His Majesty. In this confidence\r\nI beg to recommend this august assembly to adopt the amendment of the\r\nHonorable Deputy from Westphalia—not that of the Honorable Deputy from\r\nthe county of Mark—but that of Herr von Lilien.”\r\n\r\nThis speech is certainly a Prussian-Royalist confession of faith as\r\nopposed to the constitutional doctrine, and was so accepted at times\r\nwith cheers, at other times with murmurs, and, finally with a flood of\r\npersonal opposition.\r\n\r\nThe political side of Bismarck’s attitude is clear enough from this\r\nspeech. We will signalize another aspect of it by the following passages\r\nfrom a speech delivered by Bismarck on the occasion of that debate known\r\nas the Jews’ Debate, on the 15th of June.\r\n\r\n“On ascending this place to-day, it is with greater hesitation than\r\nusual, as I am sensible that by what I am about to utter, some few\r\nremarks of the speakers of yesterday, of no very flattering tone, will\r\nhave in a certain sense to be reviewed. I must openly confess that I am\r\nattached to a certain tendency, yesterday characterized by the Honorable\r\nDeputy from Crefeld as dark and mediæval; this tendency which again\r\ndares to oppose the freer development of Christianity in the way the\r\nDeputy from Crefeld regards as the only true one. Nor can I further\r\ndeny that I belong to that great mass, which, as was remarked by the\r\nHonorable Deputy from Posen, stands in opposition to the more intelligent\r\nportion of the nation, and, if my memory do not betray me, was held in\r\nconsiderable scorn by that intelligent section—the great mass that still\r\nclings to the convictions imbibed at the breast,—the great mass to which\r\na Christianity superior to the State is too elevated. If I find myself\r\nin the line of fire of such sharp sarcasms without a murmur, I believe\r\nI may throw myself upon the indulgence of the Honorable Assembly, if I\r\nconfess, with the same frankness which distinguished my opponents, that\r\nyesterday, at times of inattention, it did not quite appear certain\r\nto me whether I was in an assembly for which the law had provided, in\r\nreference to its election, the condition of communion with some one of\r\nthe Christian churches. I will pass at once to the question itself. Most\r\nof the speakers have spoken less upon the bill than upon emancipation\r\nin general. I will follow their example. I am no enemy to the Jews, and\r\nif they are enemies to me, I forgive them. Under certain circumstances\r\nI even love them. I would grant them every right, save that of holding\r\nsuperior official posts in Christian countries.\r\n\r\n“We have heard from the Minister of Finance, and from other gentlemen on\r\nthe ministerial bench, sentiments as to the definition of a Christian\r\nState, to which I almost entirely subscribe; but, on the other hand,\r\nwe were yesterday told that Christian supremacy is an idle fiction, an\r\ninvention of recent State philosophers. I am of opinion that the idea of\r\nChristian supremacy is as ancient as the _ci-devant_ Holy Roman Empire—as\r\nancient as the great family of European States; that it is, in fact, the\r\nvery soil in which these states have taken root, and that every state\r\nwhich wishes to have its existence enduring, if it desires to point to\r\nany justification for that existence, when called in question, must be\r\nconstituted on a religious basis. For me, the words ‘by the grace of God’\r\naffixed by Christian rulers to their names form no empty sound; but I see\r\nin the phrase the acknowledgment that princes desire to sway the sceptres\r\nintrusted to them by the Almighty according to God’s will on earth. I,\r\nhowever, can only recognize as the will of God that which is contained\r\nin the Christian Gospels, and I believe I am within my right when I\r\ncall such a State Christian, whose problem is to realize and verify the\r\ndoctrine of Christianity. That our State does not in all ways succeed in\r\nthis, the Honorable Deputy from the county of Mark yesterday demonstrated\r\nin a parallel he drew between the truths of the Gospel and the paragraphs\r\nof national jurisprudence, in a way rather clever than consonant with\r\nmy religious feelings. But although the solution of the problem is not\r\nalways successful, I am still convinced that the aim of the State is the\r\nrealization of Christian doctrine; however, I do _not_ think we shall\r\napproach this aim more closely with the aid of the Jews. If the religious\r\nbasis of the State be acknowledged, I am sure that among ourselves the\r\nbasis can only be that of Christianity. If we withdraw from the State\r\nthis religious basis, our State becomes nothing more than a fortuitous\r\naggregation of rights, a sort of bulwark against the universal war of\r\neach against all, such as an elder philosophy instituted. Its legislation\r\nthen would no longer recreate itself from the original fountain of\r\neternal truth, but only from the vague and mutable ideas of humanity\r\ntaking shape only from the conceptions formed in the brains of those who\r\noccupy the apex. How such states could deny the right of the practical\r\napplication of such ideas—as, for instance, those of the communists\r\non the immorality of property, the high moral value of theft, as an\r\nexperiment for the rehabilitation of the native rights of man—is not\r\nclear to me; for these very ideas are entertained by their advocates as\r\nhumane, and, indeed, as constituting the very flower of humanitarianism.\r\nTherefore, gentlemen, let us not diminish the Christianity of the\r\npeople by showing that it is superfluous to the legislature; let us not\r\ndeprive the people of the belief that our legislation is derived from\r\nthe fountain of Christianity, and that the State seeks to promote the\r\nrealization of Christianity, though that end may not always be attained.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n“Besides this, several speakers, as in almost every question, have\r\nreferred to the examples of England and France as models worthy of\r\nimitation. This question is of much less consequence there, because the\r\nJews are so much less numerous than here. But I would recommend to the\r\ngentlemen who are so fond of seeking their ideas beyond the Vosges, a\r\nguide-line distinguishing the English and the French. That consists\r\nin the proud feeling of national honor, which does not so easily and\r\ncommonly seek for models worthy of imitation and wonderful patterns, as\r\nwe do here, in foreign lands.”\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that this speech was much criticised; but it\r\nbecame a regular armory for his opponents; it was taken for granted that\r\nBismarck himself had stated that he stood in “the dark ages,” that he had\r\n“imbibed reactionary ideas with his mother’s milk,” and other similar\r\nthings, although he was only ridiculing the ideas of his opponents; there\r\nwas seldom an opportunity lost, when he was twitted with “the dark ages”\r\nand the “prejudices imbibed at the breast.” Bismarck possessed humor\r\nenough to laugh at this pitiful trick, and once exclaimed very well:\r\n“Deputy Krause rode in the lists against me on a horse, in front the dark\r\nages, behind mother’s milk!” What a picture Herr Krause, the Burgomaster\r\nof Elbing (if we are not misinformed), would make upon such a fabulous\r\nsteed!\r\n\r\nBismarck left the United Diet with a thorn in his breast. He had lost\r\nmany of the youthful illusions he had carried thither; the Prussia he\r\nfound in the White Saloon was as remote as heaven from the Prussia he had\r\nhitherto believed in, and his patriotic heart was sorrowful. He perceived\r\nthat the sovereignty of Prussia was about to encounter severe contests;\r\nthat his duty lay with the monarch’s idea, and that his native land must\r\nbe rescued from the insolent pretensions of the modern parliamentary\r\nspirit, from the most dangerous of all paper governments. In short,\r\nhe arrived with hazy, but somewhat liberal, views, and he returned a\r\npolitician thoroughly acquainted with his duty and his work, which\r\nconsisted in aiding the King to restore the Estates’ Monarchy. It was a\r\ngift, but he received it with a sigh. His youth was at an end.\r\n\r\nBismarck has ever remained true to his patriotic duties, everywhere in\r\nearnestness, and at no time has he withdrawn his hand from the plough; he\r\nwent bravely on, when so many cast their weapons away and fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DAYS OF MARCH.\r\n\r\n[1848.]\r\n\r\n    Rest at Home.—Contemplation.—The Revolution in Paris,\r\n    February, 1848.—Progress of the Revolutionary Spirit.—The\r\n    March Days of Berlin.—The Citizen Guard.—Opening of the\r\n    Second Session of the United Diet, 2d April, 1848.—Prince\r\n    Solms-Hohen-Solms-Lich.—Fr.

The\r\nancient family traits of the Bismarcks, after a silent activity in\r\nfield and forest, became more strongly marked in him than in many other\r\nbranches of his race, and his wife also retained a charming reminiscence\r\nof these peaceful days in Schönhausen. She still preserves grateful\r\nrecollections of that happy time. The outward honors, the universal fame\r\nof her illustrious husband, have brought no accession of domestic joy;\r\nshe loves the time in which she was only Frau von Bismarck, without the\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNTESS VON BISMARCK-SCHÖNHAUSEN.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that Bismarck, in the happiness of his\r\nyouthful marriage, had not forgotten his native land; that he still\r\npursued the course of political events with keen appreciation, and could\r\nnot omit to join in its most serious eventualities. Whether he sat in\r\nhis library amidst his books and maps, roved as a solitary sportsman\r\nthrough his preserves in field or wood, turned to agricultural pursuits\r\nwith the eye of a proprietor, or visited his neighbors in Jerichow or\r\nKattenwinkel, he felt an intuitive perception of some great and decisive\r\nevent about to come. Men so politically eminent as Bismarck even then\r\nwas—although he had not, as yet, evinced it in public—bear within them a\r\ncertain foreshadowing of coming events not to be under-estimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the first news arrived of the revolution of February in Paris,\r\nBismarck knew for a fact that the signal for a struggle with the Prussian\r\nMonarchy had there been given; he perceived that the wave of revolution\r\nwould pass over the Rhine, and dash against the throne of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nHe determined upon manly resistance, and his virile courage was not\r\nbroken when the terrible truth more than fulfilled his anticipations;\r\nwhen the waves of revolution shot with lightning speed through all\r\nGermany; when a want of presence of mind and irresolute counsels, and at\r\ntimes crass cowardice, rather than ill-will or treason, in almost every\r\ndirection, lamed or broke down the power of resistance.\r\n\r\nHe saw, sinking and destroyed, bulwarks and dykes he had held to be\r\nunassailable; his heart palpitated with patriotic ardor and manly sorrow,\r\nbut he lost neither courage nor clear insight, like a true dykesman.\r\nIt had hitherto been his office to protect the Elbe dykes against the\r\nfloods, and in a similar character it was his duty to act against the\r\nfloods of revolution. Nor has the valiant man unfaithfully acquitted\r\nhimself of his severe duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe March-days of Berlin pressed hard upon the heart of the sturdy\r\nMarch-squire, and there ensued a long series of days of grief; for\r\nhe felt as a personal insult every thing spoken, written, or enacted\r\nagainst his royal master. He passed as in a feverish dream through the\r\nstreets of the capital of his King, filled with threatening forms.[37]\r\nHe saw flags displayed and colors fluttering unknown to him; Polish\r\nstandards, tricolors of black, red, and gold, but nowhere the ancient\r\nhonored flag of Prussia. Even on the palace of his deceased lord and\r\nking the three colors flaunted, ever the battle-standard of the enemies\r\nof Prussia, never those of the ancient German realm. In place of the\r\nproud regiments of Guards, he only beheld citizen-soldiers watching in\r\na half-ludicrous, half-dispirited manner. Men had ceased to speak; all\r\nthe world speechified and declaimed; vain folly and ignominious treason\r\ngrasped each other with dirty hands in an alliance against royalty, and\r\nthose who ought to have been defending the crown, and indeed desired to\r\ndo so, found themselves caught in the spider-webs of liberal doctrines:\r\ntrammelled themselves in the sere bonds of political theories, scornfully\r\nrent asunder by the rude hands of revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was sufficient to bring the burning tear to Bismarck’s eye, and his\r\nsoul struggled in unspeakable torment; but he manfully wrestled insult\r\nand vexation down. With a pale but impassible countenance he took his\r\nplace, on the 2d of April, 1848, in the first session of the Second\r\nUnited Diet.\r\n\r\nThe White Saloon still existed, but the bright days were gone in which\r\nVincke had sought to polish diamonds with diamond-dust; true, the same\r\nmen were present, but it was a vastly different assembly. In those former\r\ndays, certain of victory and intoxicated with power, this assembly now\r\nmeditated suicide; it could scarcely be quick enough in transferring its\r\nlegislative functions to the new creation, the first-born of revolution,\r\nstanding impatiently watching at the door.\r\n\r\nThe President was still the Marshal of the Guild of Nobles, the Serene\r\nPrince of Solms-Hohen-Solms-Lich; but the Royal Commissioner was no\r\nlonger the Freiherr von Bodelschwingh-Velmede; his place was occupied by\r\nthe new Minister of State, Ludolf Camphausen—one of the chiefs of the\r\nRhine-land liberal party.\r\n\r\nSome weeks before, a liberal, F. Foerster, at the volunteer anniversary,\r\nhad saluted the Minister von Bodelschwingh with the compliment that\r\ntime did not fly with _Eagle’s wings_, but _Bodelswings_; but this very\r\nBodelschwingh, the most faithful subject of the King, was now despised by\r\nthe revolutionary party as an obscure reactionary. There was reason for\r\nlaughter, had not the crisis been so terribly grave.\r\n\r\nCamphausen read the well-known Royal Decree of proposition, after\r\nbetraying, in his introductory oration, that liberalism no longer\r\nfelt itself entirely secure; in fact these liberal ministers, such as\r\nHansemann, Auerswald, Schwerin, and Bornemann, were not the men able to\r\nsteer the royal vessel with safety during this severe westerly storm.\r\n\r\nPrince Felix Lichnowsky moved the replicatory address. The Marshal\r\ndeclared the proposition to be carried unanimously, as he perceived the\r\nmajority to be of his opinion.\r\n\r\n“It is not unanimous. I protest against it!” exclaimed Herr von\r\nThadden-Triglaff.\r\n\r\n“Carried by an almost unanimous majority!” proclaimed the Marshal.\r\n\r\nThe next proceeding was to frame the address at once, and to accept the\r\nplenum at the same session. Most unseemly and discreditable haste!\r\n\r\nUpon this the Deputy von Bismarck-Schönhausen rose and said:—\r\n\r\n“It is my opinion that we owe to the dignity, ever upheld in this\r\nAssembly, due discretion in the conduct of all its deliberations; that we\r\nowe it to all the simplest rules of expediency—especially on an occasion\r\nwhen we meet for the last time—by no means to deviate from our fixed\r\ncustoms. Heretofore every law, however simple, has been referred to a\r\ncommittee, which has considered it with deliberation, and submitted it\r\non the following day to the Chamber. I believe at so serious a moment as\r\nthis, that on the expression of the sentiments of this Assembly, still\r\nhaving the honor to represent the Prussian people, it is a sufficiently\r\nimportant procedure not to admit of such a hasty consideration of the\r\naddress—so far removed from the rules of expediency according to my\r\nindividual feelings.”\r\n\r\nBismarck spoke with more than usual hesitation; his features appeared\r\nsharper than usual to his friends, his countenance was pale, his white\r\nteeth were more visible and prominent, his manner was stolid; he\r\npresented the appearance of a man combating a critical hour.\r\n\r\nYes—to him it was indeed a critical hour. He was unable to arrest the\r\nprogress of events, but he was determined to do his duty. The tumult of\r\nthe streets might rage, the whirlpool of thronging events might carry\r\naway with them men usually of the utmost courage; but Bismarck was not to\r\nbe carried away as well. He was unable to stem the rapidity with which\r\nthe address was draughted, considered, and accepted. Milde and company\r\npressed forward, and the Second United Diet could not be in sufficient\r\nhurry to transfer its functions to the convention to be assembled for the\r\nconsolidation of the constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pursue the progress of this session without pain; it\r\npassed over the ruins and fragments of all the royal hopes which but a\r\nfew months before had existed in all their pride and glory, and appeared\r\nso instinct with happiness and founded on such secure grounds.\r\n\r\nIn this debate on the address it would have been impossible for Bismarck\r\nto speak, had not his political opponents, Von Saucken-Tarputschen and\r\nMilde, with much difficulty obtained a hearing for him; so madly was the\r\nAssembly determined upon self-destruction.\r\n\r\nRevolution was knocking at the portals of the White Saloon.\r\n\r\nBismarck, however, said:—“I am one of the few who would vote against\r\nthe address, and I have only requested permission to speak, in order\r\nto explain this disapproval, and to declare to you that I accept the\r\naddress, in the sense of a programme of the future, at once; but for\r\nthe sole reason that I am powerless to do otherwise. (Laughter.) Not\r\nvoluntarily, but by stress of circumstances; for I have not changed\r\nmy opinions during these six months; I would rather believe that this\r\nministry is the only one able to conduct us from our actual position into\r\nan orderly and constitutional condition, and for that reason I shall give\r\nit my inconsiderable support in every case within my power. But the cause\r\nof my voting against the address consists in the expressions of joy and\r\ngratitude made use of for the events of recent days; the past is buried,\r\nand I mourn it with greater pain than many among you, because no human\r\npower can reawaken it—when the Crown itself has scattered ashes upon the\r\ncoffin. But if I accept this from the force of circumstances, I can not\r\nretire from my functions in this Diet with the lie in my mouth that I\r\nshall give thanks and rejoice at what I must in any sense hold to be an\r\nerroneous path. If it be indeed possible to attain to a united German\r\nFatherland by the new path now pursued, to arrive at a happy or even\r\nlegally well-ordered condition of things, the moment will have come when\r\nI can tender my thanks to the originator of the new state of things; but\r\nat present this is beyond my power.”\r\n\r\nThis was the earnest language of a true statesman, and it was not without\r\nits impression even then. When Bismarck ended, no one dared to laugh. He\r\naccepted the situation because he had no other course open to him; but\r\nhe could not return thanks for that which appeared likely to militate\r\nagainst his reverence for his King. He knew that the past was beyond\r\nrecall, now that the Crown had itself cast ashes upon its coffin—nor,\r\nindeed, was it at all within the thoughts of Bismarck ever to reawaken\r\nthe past. He could mourn over the past, and this with considerable\r\naffliction; but he began to arm himself for the future; that future he\r\nresolved to conquer for the monarchy.\r\n\r\nSuch were the events of the 2d of April, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe immediate necessity was to strive against revolution, which continued\r\nto advance with bloody feet and shameless countenance. First, conferences\r\nwere held with friends and allies of equal rank and similar opinions;\r\narrangements were made in all directions. He exhibited a restless\r\nactivity, at first apparently without any hope, and which seemed to\r\nlead to no results for weeks, though it were destined in the end to\r\nbear fruit. Such was the policy pursued by the faithful royalist in\r\nthe terrible spring and summer of 1848, passed by him alternately at\r\nSchönhausen, Berlin, Potsdam, Reinfeld, and (on the occasion of the\r\npresence of the Prince of Prussia) at Stettin.\r\n\r\nBismarck was one of those who labored most assiduously and successfully\r\ntowards the erection of a barrier against revolution even at the twelfth\r\nhour. A royal or conservative party could not be conjured up out of the\r\nearth, but the elements for such a party, existing in great multitude,\r\nwere assembled in clubs, united by ties, gradually organized, and finally\r\ndisciplined.\r\n\r\nNor did Bismarck ever falter in courage, for he trusted in the Divine\r\nmercy and the kingdom of Prussia, but not in the well-known prophecy\r\nof Lehnin, as the liberal historian, Adolf Schmidt, asserted,[38] no\r\nmatter whether the librarian La Croze in 1697 really saw a copy of this\r\ndocument in the hands of a Von Schönhausen at Berlin or no. The Herr von\r\nSchönhausen in question could scarcely have been a Bismarck, as Professor\r\nSchmidt would seem to infer, and our Bismarck was, in any case,\r\nsufficiently informed to know for what purpose the so-called _Vaticinium\r\nLehninense_ had been forged, and possessed other sources whence to draw\r\nconfidence and trust. The revolution had to be combated by clubs and by\r\nthe press—both so dangerous to the monarchy. No one was more active in\r\nthe organization of these than Bismarck; he entered with confidence on\r\nthe ground whither events had driven him. Thus arose the Prussian clubs,\r\nthe patriotic societies, and many others, and at last the club which\r\nbore as its motto, “Mit Gott für König und Vaterland”—(With God for\r\nKing and Country). The _New Prussian Gazette_, with Bismarck’s aid, was\r\nfounded, as well as many smaller periodicals. There was also the _New\r\nPrussian Sunday News_, which, sent in thousands to the smaller towns and\r\nprovinces, became a powerful weapon.\r\n\r\nBismarck at the same time kept a vigilant eye upon the “Vereinbarungs”\r\nSociety in Berlin, and the Parliament at Frankfurt, but he never joined\r\nthe meetings in the Church of St. Paul, nor the Academy of Music, nor\r\nthose in the Concert Room of the Royal Theatre in Berlin. We do not know\r\nwhether it would then have been possible for him to have succeeded in\r\ngetting elected for Berlin or Frankfurt; at any rate, he never thought\r\nof doing so, for he was firmly convinced that nothing stable would be\r\ncreated in either place.\r\n\r\nWe will here give a highly characteristic example of the manner in which\r\nBismarck so powerfully and openly attacked the malicious and silly\r\naspersions upon the Junkers, then the order of the day, showing with\r\nwhat acuteness and ability he could encounter the hollow declamations of\r\nunconscientious sophists. At the end of August he published the following\r\naddress, in the form then greatly in vogue, of a _communiqué_:—\r\n\r\n    “The Deputy for the Belgard Circle, Herr Jänsch, asserted in\r\n    the debate of the 16th instant that the Pomeranian laborers\r\n    only obtained from 2½ to 4 silber groschen per day, and in\r\n    addition to this had to give 190 days’ labor for nothing. If\r\n    so, the 52 Sundays being subtracted, the earnings of a laborer\r\n    in the other 123 days, calculated at an average of 3½ sgr.,\r\n    would represent 13 thlr. 9 sgr. 9 pf.[39] That no man can live\r\n    upon that every one must see—even Herr Jänsch, if he takes the\r\n    trouble to think further about it. I should therefore have\r\n    characterized the statement of this gentleman as a deliberate\r\n    lie in his official capacity as a national representative, had\r\n    not the demand for a uniform wage of 6 sgr. proved that Herr\r\n    Jänsch has either not been able, or not had leisure, to make\r\n    himself acquainted with the condition of the most numerous\r\n    class of the electors he represents. For with a wage of 6 sgr.\r\n    the Pomeranian laborer would be worse off than he is now. The\r\n    laborers on the estate of Kniephof, Circle Stargard, for the\r\n    last eight years, during my residence at that place, were\r\n    living under the following conditions, which are the same, with\r\n    very slight differences, common to the whole district—indeed,\r\n    I could prove that in other places, such as Zimmerhausen and\r\n    Trieglaff, they are even better off. The daily wage certainly\r\n    is, in summer, 4 sgr. per man, 3 sgr. per woman, and in winter\r\n    1 sgr. less in each case; and they have to give 156 man’s days’\r\n    work and 26 woman’s days’ work in the year without pay. But\r\n    each working family received from the proprietor the following\r\n    advantages free:—\r\n\r\n    “1. House, consisting of parlor, bedroom, kitchen, cellar,\r\n    and loft, stabling for their cattle of every kind, and the\r\n    necessary barn accommodation, which is all maintained by the\r\n    proprietor.\r\n\r\n    “2. Three morgen (acres) plough-land, one for winter corn, one\r\n    for summer, one for potatoes, for which the laborer finds the\r\n    seed, but the estate furnishes the appointments, inclusive of\r\n    manure; add to this one-half morgen (acre) of garden ground,\r\n    near the house, and one-half morgen (acre) for flax; the whole\r\n    profit of this superficies belongs to the laborer.\r\n\r\n    “3. Pasture for two cows, six sheep, and two geese with their\r\n    broods; hay for one cow during the winter.\r\n\r\n    “4. Firing, consisting of turf, and the right of gathering wood\r\n    through three morgen of forest.\r\n\r\n    “5. Corn from the proprietor’s land, five scheffel (sacks) rye,\r\n    one of barley.\r\n\r\n    “6. On an average each laborer gets fifteen scheffel (sacks)\r\n    corn of each kind for threshing.\r\n\r\n    “7. Medical attendance and medicines free.\r\n\r\n    “8. If the husband dies the widow receives, until her children\r\n    are grown up, dwelling-room, one morgen of potatoes, one-half\r\n    morgen of garden, one-quarter morgen of flax, and one cow,\r\n    which feeds and pastures with the proprietor’s herd, without\r\n    any kind of return on her part.\r\n\r\n    “Every day-laborer—those who have not grown-up daughters—keeps\r\n    one servant-girl, with wages of, say 10 thalers (£1 10_s._) per\r\n    annum, who, on account of the laborer, performs services to the\r\n    proprietor, which the laborer’s wife never does, but takes care\r\n    of the children, and cooks.\r\n\r\n    “The pay in cash, which such a family, with servant, according\r\n    to the foregoing tariff, after deducting the produce, much\r\n    of which remains for sale, is ascertained, according to the\r\n    number of children able to assist in the work, to be about\r\n    34 to 50 thalers per annum.[40] A family without children\r\n    receives, after deducting the 190 non-paid days (including 60\r\n    days for threshing) and the 52 Sundays = 242 days (inclusive\r\n    of market-days and the like), annually, in cash-paid days for\r\n    man and maid—some of these days being semi-labor days, and so\r\n    justifying the apparent difference—52 days at 4 sgr., 178 days\r\n    at 3 sgr., and 150 days at 2 sgr., in all 34 thalers 22 sgr.\r\n    If this be added to the above-named produce, it will not be\r\n    astonishing that the Pomeranian laborers would not be disposed\r\n    to exchange their present condition for the poor 6 sgr. per day\r\n    which Herr Jänsch in his ignorance would obtain for them.[41] I\r\n    will not boast, but only state, as a matter of fact, that the\r\n    greater number of the proprietors have hitherto voluntarily\r\n    adopted the usual practice of supporting the inhabitants during\r\n    calamity, cattle murrain, and years of famine—many to a degree\r\n    of which the babbling philanthropists who declaim against the\r\n    Junkers have no idea whatever. In the past year of famine, in\r\n    which the Deputy Master Butcher Jänsch made a disturbance in\r\n    Belgard, which, if I mistake not, obtained some notice from\r\n    the Court of Justice, the large class of proprietors he has\r\n    attacked by erroneous or fictitious statements made great\r\n    sacrifices to give the inhabitants of their estates no reason\r\n    to increase the class of the dissatisfied, at the head of whom\r\n    Deputy Herr Jänsch now fights to attain tumultuary laurels. I\r\n    have added this personal remark in order to draw the attention\r\n    of Herr Jänsch to the rest of the article, and thus afford him\r\n    the opportunity of learning something of the condition of the\r\n    class he asserts himself to represent; a condition of which\r\n    he ought to have known, before he talked about them in the\r\n    National Assembly.\r\n\r\n                                                         “Bismarck.\r\n\r\n    “Schönhausen, the 21st August, 1848.”\r\n\r\nThe then Deputy for Belgard has never attempted to obtain any advantage\r\nby a reply!\r\n\r\nImmediately after the days of March, Bismarck, impelled by his Prussian\r\nheart, addressed a letter to His Majesty; not a political letter, full\r\nof counsels and plans, but an outpouring of the feelings produced by the\r\nmoment. Throughout the whole of that summer this letter lay upon King\r\nFrederick William’s writing-table, as a precious token of unchangeable\r\nPrussian fidelity. During that summer, so fraught with weighty events,\r\nBismarck was often called to Sans-Souci, and the King took his advice in\r\nmany important affairs.\r\n\r\nStolpe, on the Baltic, was the residence of Bismarck for some weeks\r\nof the summer. An incident of his life is furnished by a spectator.\r\nAfter one of the concerts denominated “Navy Concerts”—for in those days\r\nan opinion was entertained that a fleet could be built by means of\r\nbeer-drinking, concert-pence, and such similar “miserabilities” of good\r\nintentions—Bismarck, drawing himself up to his full height, majestically\r\naddressed one of the gentlemen who had been active in the concert,\r\ngreeting him as an acquaintance, and added: “You have taken pains to make\r\nthe work somewhat hotter for us!” It was one of the hottest days of the\r\nyear. An anxious smile played upon his lips, but bright daring spoke in\r\nthe firm contour of the bearded face. His hat alone bore the Prussian\r\ncolors. It was indeed refreshing to see such a man in those days.\r\n\r\nAnd when the “winter of discontent” came for democracy, when the question\r\nof saving the construction of a ministry was prominent, it was Bismarck\r\nwho took the initiative concerning the introduction of the elder Von\r\nManteuffel, his partisan at the United Diet, and thus drew the eyes of\r\nthe people upon the man who promptly restored order. He had discovered\r\nthe right man for the situation as it then existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP.\r\n\r\n[1849-1851.]\r\n\r\n    The Second Chamber.—The Sword and the Throne.—Acceptance of\r\n    the Frankfurt Project.—The New Electoral Law.—Bismarck’s\r\n    Speeches.—The King and the Stag.—Birth of Herbert von\r\n    Bismarck.—“What does this Broken Glass Cost?”—The Kreuzzeitung\r\n    Letters.—The Prussian Nobility.—“I am Proud to be a Prussian\r\n    Junker!”—Close of the Session.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the publication of the December constitution of\r\n1848, Bismarck was, in the same month, elected in Brandenburg the\r\nrepresentative of West-Havelland, as a member of the Second Chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Diet was opened on the 26th of February, 1849; and Bismarck was among\r\nthe first members to repair to the solemnity in the White Saloon. How\r\nmany reminiscences were associated in Bismarck’s mind with the White\r\nSaloon! How many more were to arise! Memorials and landmarks still remain!\r\n\r\nWithout any special object, most probably, Bismarck took the same\r\nseat in the Assembly he had formerly occupied as representative of the\r\nKnight’s Estate of Jerichow, in the United Diet; and here he held, as it\r\nwere, as member for the electoral metropolis of Brandenburg, a sort of\r\ncourt. It was at least something of a court, for not only was he received\r\nby his former associates, such as Count Arnim-Boytzenburg, the minister\r\nVon Manteuffel, and many others, but his opponents also addressed\r\nhim—those who had been his opponents, and were to become so again. Among\r\nthese were Auerswald, Vincke, and Grabow; at that time they all stood\r\nwith Bismarck on the right, in the terrible crisis of the country.\r\nBismarck received them with the perfect confidence of a great-hearted\r\ngentleman, in that gracious manner of which he was so perfect a master,\r\nbut which he could, at any moment, for the sake of a joke, frankly and\r\nfreely abandon, without in the least imperilling his position. On that\r\nday his face remained serious, despite the anecdote related by Freiherr\r\nvon Vincke, who recounted in a humorous way that on alighting from\r\nhis carriage he had been hissed at the palace gate by the Berlin mob,\r\nwhile plaudits were made to Temmes and D’Esters. Bismarck did not allow\r\nhimself any illusions as to the difficulty of the position, although\r\nthe royalists were in ecstasies at the result of the elections. Parties\r\nwere at the time about equal in numbers, if those were counted to the\r\nroyalist side that had not formally sided with the democrats. It was a\r\nvery beggarly account, and yet this was to be regarded, after the events\r\nof the spring, as a considerable gain—a gain greatly to be ascribed to\r\nthe endeavors of Bismarck and his immediate friends.\r\n\r\nA conservative deputy from Pomerania, addressing the member for\r\nWest-Havelland, said: “We have conquered!”\r\n\r\n“Not so!” replied Bismarck, coolly. “We have not conquered, but we have\r\nmade an attack, which is the principal thing. Victory is yet to come, but\r\nit will come.”\r\n\r\nThese words accurately and truly convey the nature of the situation,\r\nBismarck being a master of short phrases in which situations are rendered\r\nin a perfectly intelligible manner. Very frequently his expressions\r\nappear as if a curtain had been suddenly withdrawn to allow brilliant\r\nlight to dissipate gloom. He is the very opposite to those diplomatists\r\nwho make use of language only to conceal their thoughts. His clear\r\nperceptions are ever conveyed openly in definite language. Not only in\r\npolitics is this true, but in ordinary conversation. On one occasion\r\nthe relative positions of the Pomeranian Circles were under discussion.\r\nBismarck said, “The Principality of Cammin hangs like a pair of breeches\r\nover Belgard!” Of course his geographical studies aided him to this, but\r\nhis expressions are equally applicable under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nTwo of the deputies, on the occasion of this solemnity, displayed the\r\ncynicism of street democracy with childish vanity; one of them strutted\r\nabout in a green frock-coat, and the other attempted to draw attention to\r\nhimself by continually fanning himself with his gray hat. These were not,\r\nhowever, the worst enemies of the Prussian monarchy in the White Saloon\r\non that day; under many a well-brushed black coat worse emotions were on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nBy accident the sabre of one of the officers of the Guards fell from its\r\nscabbard on his suddenly turning; the naked weapon lay before the throne\r\nof Prussia, a circumstance which could only be regarded by many, on both\r\nsides, as portending that the sword alone could now save the throne.\r\n\r\nAt the sessions immediately succeeding the opening of the Second\r\nChamber, Bismarck now found himself placed in the position of defending\r\nthe constitution—although it did not fulfill his aspirations,\r\nopinions, and convictions—against the attacks of democracy. He had\r\naccepted constitutionalism, from necessity, and was bound to defend\r\nthe sovereignty upon this basis. This he did bravely and openly, but\r\nin a spirit of self-consciousness and dignity, which often drove his\r\nantagonists to despair, and frequently aroused a storm of disapprobation.\r\n\r\n“No word,” he once exclaimed, “has been more wrongly used in the past\r\nyear than the word ‘people.’ Every body has held it to signify just what\r\nsuited his own view, usually as a crowd of individuals, whom it was\r\nnecessary to persuade.”\r\n\r\nTo throw this phrase into the face of democracy, meant far more in those\r\ndays than at the present time.\r\n\r\nHe declared against a fresh amnesty with manly vigor and deep insight;\r\nhe straightforwardly said the King, on the 18th March, 1848, had\r\npardoned rebels, but such an act ought not to be repeated, because it\r\nwould have the effect of spreading an opinion among the people that\r\nthe whole political rights of the State depended upon the will of the\r\npopulation, as if any one who armed a certain number of individuals,\r\nor assembled them in unarmed crowds, to overawe a weak government,\r\npossessed the right to overturn any law obnoxious to him. “There is no\r\naccommodation possible with this battle of principles, which has shaken\r\nEurope to its foundations; these principles are founded on contradictory\r\ngrounds, opposed from the very commencement. One apparently seeks its\r\njustification in the national will, but really in the brute force\r\nof the barricades; the other is founded in a sovereignty granted by\r\nHeaven, upon the supremacy of divine right, and endeavors to accomplish\r\nits development by organically allying itself with constitutional\r\njurisprudence and law. One of these principles regards agitators of\r\nevery kind as heroic combatants for truth, freedom, and right; the\r\nother classes them as rebels. These principles can not be decided by\r\nparliamentary debates; ere long the Almighty, who is the arbiter of\r\nbattles, will throw the dice and so determine the controversy.”\r\n\r\nThe Second Chamber adopted the Frankfurt Imperial Constitution by a vote\r\nof 179 against 159. Bismarck spoke energetically against it, because it\r\nbore the broad impress of national sovereignty, this being evident, as\r\nthe Emperor retained nothing more than a right of a veto of suspension.\r\nThe Radicals, he said, would approach the new Emperor with the imperial\r\narms, and ask,—\r\n\r\n“Think you that this eagle is given you merely as a present?”\r\n\r\n“The Frankfurt crown,” he continued, “may be very brilliant, but the\r\ngold, which lends truth to its splendor, must be added by melting into\r\nits composition the Prussian crown; and I can not believe that this\r\nrecasting is possible by means of the proposed constitution.”\r\n\r\nThe course of the discussions in the Second Chamber gradually showed\r\nan increase in the power of the democrats, and they would render a\r\nmonarchical government impossible. They insisted on the abolition of the\r\nstate of siege in Berlin, as this materially impeded their projects; and\r\nwhen they had finally succeeded in effecting this, the Government could\r\ndo no otherwise than dissolve the Second Chamber and prorogue the First.\r\nIt seemed at one time that this dissolution would be the signal for\r\nanother insurrection, but the democratic mob was taken aback when the\r\nGovernment showed the necessary severity. It was a terrible exaggeration\r\nfor a Paris newspaper to announce, “_Le canon gronde à Berlin_.” One\r\nvolley in the Dönhofsplatz, and then, “Arms—to the right,” and a cavalry\r\ncharge in the Leipziger-Strasse, were enough thoroughly to deprive the\r\ndemocrats of all taste for another rising.\r\n\r\nBismarck was then residing at Wilhelms-Strasse, No. 71; in the summer he\r\nwent to Pomerania, and thence, in August, proceeded to Brandenburg for\r\nthe election, and finally to Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe new electoral law for the Second Chamber, and a decree summoning both\r\nChambers for the 7th of August, had already been published, on the 30th\r\nof May. This new Chamber, which had grown clearer as to the position\r\nof parties, was employed with the revision of the Customs Constitution\r\nand with the German policy of Prussia—in fact, with the plans for union\r\nproposed by Herr von Radowitz.\r\n\r\nBismarck, who now appeared more and more as one of the leaders of the\r\nconservative party, declared against the projects of union and the triple\r\nalliance, because it was founded at the cost of Prussia’s specific\r\ninterests, and, if successful, would, in the end ruin her. On the 6th of\r\nSeptember, 1849, Bismarck spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n“I am of opinion that the motive principles of the year 1848 were far\r\nmore social than national. National action would have confined itself to\r\na few, but prominent, persons, in more contracted circles, if the ground\r\nhad not been shaken under our feet, drawing in the social element, by\r\nfalse representations as to the ambition of the proletariat to acquire\r\nthe property of others. The envy the poor had of the rich was excited\r\nin proportion to the continued feeding of a spirit of license from high\r\nquarters, which destroyed the moral elements of resistance in the minds\r\nof men. I do not believe that these evils would be averted by democratic\r\nconcessions, or by projects of German unity; the seat of the disease\r\nis deeper; but I deny that any desire has ever existed in the Prussian\r\npeople towards a national regeneration on the model of the theories of\r\nFrankfurt. The policy of Frederick the Great has been frequently alluded\r\nto; and it has even been identified with the proposition for union. I\r\nrather am of opinion that Frederick II. would have turned to the most\r\nprominent peculiarity of Prussian nationality, to her warlike element,\r\nand not without a result. He would have known that to-day, as in the era\r\nof our fathers, the sound of the trumpet which called to the standard\r\nof the father of the country, has lost no charm for the Prussian ear,\r\nwhether the question concern the defense of the frontier or the fame\r\nand greatness of Prussia. He would have had the alternative, after the\r\nrupture with Frankfurt, to ally himself with our ancient ally, Austria,\r\nand then assume the brilliant part enacted by the Emperor of Russia, in\r\nalliance with Austria, to destroy the common enemy—Revolution; or he\r\nwould have been free, with the same justification he possessed for the\r\nconquest of Silesia, after declining the Frankfurt imperial crown, to\r\ndecide what the nature of the German constitution should be, at the risk\r\nof casting the sword into the balance. This would have been a national\r\nPrussian policy! In this way Prussia, in union with Austria or alone,\r\nwould have been able to arrive at the proper position that would have\r\nendowed Germany with the power it should possess in Europe. The plan of a\r\nconstitutional union, however, destroys the Prussian specific character.”\r\n\r\nWe must draw especial attention to the reply which Bismarck made to the\r\nargument of Herr von Radowitz, that the Frankfurt Assembly had shielded\r\nPrussia against some dangers.\r\n\r\n“I am not in the least aware,” said Bismarck, “of such a thing. I\r\nonly know that the 38th Prussian Regiment, on the 18th of September,\r\n1848, preserved us from that which the Frankfurt Parliament, with its\r\npredecessor, had conjured up. The specific character of Prussia actually\r\naccomplished this. This was the remains of the heretic Prussiadom which\r\nhad survived the Revolution; the Prussian army, the Prussian treasury,\r\nthe fruits of Prussian administration accumulated through many years,\r\nand the animated reaction exerted by King and people on each other in\r\nPrussia. It consisted in the attachment of the Prussian population to the\r\nestablished dynasty; it consisted in the old Prussian virtues of honor,\r\nfidelity, obedience, and bravery, which inspire every Prussian soldier\r\nfrom the backbone—from the officers to the youngest recruit. The army has\r\nno enthusiasm for the tricolor; in it, as in the rest of the people, will\r\nbe found no longing for national regeneration. The name of Prussia is\r\nall-sufficient for it. These hosts follow the banner of black and white,\r\nand not the tricolor: under the black and white they joyfully die for\r\ntheir country. The tricolor has been, since the 18th March, recognized as\r\nthe attribute of their opponents. The accents of the Prussian National\r\nAnthem, the strains of the Dessau and Hohenfriedberg March, are well\r\nknown and beloved among them: but I have never yet heard a Prussian\r\nsoldier sing, ‘What is the German fatherland?’ The nation whence this\r\narmy has sprung, and of which the army is the truest representative,\r\nin the happy and accurate words of the President of the First Chamber,\r\nRudolf von Auerswald, does not need to see the Prussian monarchy melt\r\naway in the filthy ferment of South German immorality. We are Prussians,\r\nand Prussians we desire to remain. I know that in these words I utter\r\nthe creed of the Prussian army, the creed of the majority of my\r\nfellow-countrymen, and I hope to God that we shall continue Prussians,\r\nwhen this bit of paper is forgotten like the withered leaf of autumn!”\r\n\r\nThis love for the Prussian army, this enthusiasm for it, is a red\r\nline which runs through the whole political life of Bismarck. In it\r\nhe recognizes the especial representative of the Prussian nation, the\r\npillar of the State; and this was quite in the style of Frederick; for\r\ndid not the great monarch say, “that the sky did not rest more firmly\r\non the shoulders of Atlas, than the Prussian State on the regiments of\r\nthe army.” The German policy of Herr von Radowitz had no more conscious\r\nand energetic opponent than Herr von Bismarck, unless in the excellent\r\nGeneral von Rauch, the Royal Adjutant-General, a remarkable and highly\r\ngifted statesman, who opposed him on every opportunity in his powerful\r\nway, even in the royal presence. Radowitz, on one occasion, in his\r\nemphatic style, conjured the King, like Cæsar, to cross the Rubicon.\r\nGeneral von Rauch replied, with a twang of the Berlin dialect, “I do not\r\nknow that fellow Cæsar, nor that fellow the Rubicon, but the man can not\r\nbe a true Prussian who counsels His Majesty thus!” Herr von Radowitz, it\r\nis known, was not a born Prussian.\r\n\r\nAs to the revision of the constitution, Herr von Bismarck and his\r\nassociates strove actively to endow it with such a shape that it would be\r\npossible for the King actually to govern with it. Much was accomplished,\r\nbut “Far from sufficient!” said Bismarck. Nor was it the fault of\r\nBismarck that much more was not done.\r\n\r\nHe was particularly zealous against the power of granting taxation by\r\nthe Diet. “The centre of gravity, the whole power of the State, departs\r\nfrom the Crown to the Chambers, or their majorities, and nothing then\r\nwill remain to the Crown but the power of carrying out the votes of\r\nthe majority. It is true the Government can dissolve the Chambers, and\r\nproceed to new elections, but the new Chambers might choose to pursue\r\nthe way of the old, and thus the conflict would become insoluble and\r\neternal; there is no way of avoiding this. This would be overturning\r\nthe Prussian State Prerogative, he perceived, the effects of which very\r\neasily would be of a more enduring nature than those of the so-called\r\nMarch Revolution!”\r\n\r\nThe orator of 1849 seemed to have a perception of the conflicts which the\r\nPremier of 1862 would have to pass through: he then did not see how he\r\nshould emerge from such a state of things, but in 1866 he found the way\r\nthe _via triumphalis_.\r\n\r\nBismarck had been forced to accept constitutionalism, but he did not\r\nunconditionally do so: it was at least to be a Prussian constitution, or\r\nmodelled on Prussian principles, not directly inimical to the Kingship.\r\n\r\nPrussia, said he, must be distinguishable from other countries. The\r\ndownfall of German States kept tolerable pace with the concessions\r\nmade by their Governments to the people. A reference to England was\r\na mistake. “Give us every thing English that we do not possess; give\r\nus English piety, and English respect for the law; give the entire\r\nEnglish constitution, but with this the entire relations of the English\r\nlandlords, English wealth, and English common-sense—then it will be\r\npossible to govern in a similar manner. The Prussian Crown must not be\r\nforced into the powerless position of the English Crown, which appears\r\nmore like an elegant ornament at the apex of the edifice of the State. In\r\nours I recognize the supporting pillar.”\r\n\r\nEngland, he added, had given itself the leading principles of the\r\nconstitution of 1688, only after having been, for more than a century,\r\nunder the curatorship of an omnipotent aristocracy, consisting of a very\r\nfew families. Parliamentary Reform had now, it was true, broken the power\r\nof the aristocracy, but it was yet to be seen whether it would endure\r\nlike the influence of the aristocracy. “We are deficient in the very\r\nclass which controls politics in England, the class of wealthy and thence\r\nconservative gentlemen, independent of material interests, whose whole\r\neducation is directed to becoming statesmen.”\r\n\r\nBismarck’s words were no longer hesitating, as at the United Diet,\r\nalthough there was always some slight impediment until his language began\r\nto flow more readily. But, as now, we perceive in his speeches that he\r\nhad always to contend with the too rapidly advancing flood of thought. In\r\nhis outward appearance his aspect was the picture of manly perfection;\r\nthe tall, strong-boned frame was erect, but light and unconstrained;\r\nhis attitude was somewhat daring, but the blue-gray eye glanced forth\r\nearnestly and sharply, when it was not animated with the light of sincere\r\nfriendship. It was not the contemplative eye of the thinker, but the\r\nstraightforward look of the man of action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the last days of autumn, Bismarck was commanded to the royal\r\nhunting-parties at Letzlingen, as he afterwards always continued to be,\r\nif not too far away. Frederick William IV. treated him with especial\r\nfavor on this occasion; it was also with peculiar pleasure that he hunted\r\non the moors and among the forests, centuries before the proud heritage\r\nof his race; a heritage his ancestors had surrendered only under the\r\ninfluence of affection for their princes, and reverence for their liege\r\nlord. These old Bismarckian preserves are the richest in Prussia:\r\nthe red deer and bucks are counted by thousands, and the royal hunts,\r\nwhich take place every winter since the restoration of the mansion of\r\nLetzlingen by Frederick William IV., at the beginning of his reign, are\r\namong the best in Europe. Frederick William IV., although familiar with\r\nthe chase, was not at all times a keen sportsman. Once he leaned his\r\ngun against a tree, drew a volume of Shakspeare from his pocket, seated\r\nhimself on a stump, and was so absorbed in the poetry, that he never\r\nnoticed that an inquisitive stag, who wished to know what the King was\r\nreading, crept up behind him and looked into the book over his shoulder.\r\nThis pretty scene was witnessed by several sportsmen, and among these\r\nBismarck, from a distance.\r\n\r\nIn this winter of 1849-50 Bismarck established his family in Berlin,\r\nalthough he retained his seat at Schönhausen; his household lived on\r\nthe first floor on Dorotheen-Strasse, No. 37; here his second child and\r\neldest son Herbert was born.\r\n\r\nHe was christened on the 13th February, 1850, by the well-known and\r\nso highly esteemed preacher, Gossner. In the spring of 1868 the\r\nheirs of Gossner, with other manuscripts, presented the letter of\r\nBismarck, in which he asked Gossner to christen his son, to a bazar for\r\nmissionary purposes. A cousin of the Minister-President—General Count\r\nBismarck-Bohlen, the Commandant of Berlin—purchased the letter, and\r\npresented it to Count Herbert. This letter is as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                       Berlin, 11th February, 1850.\r\n\r\n    REVEREND SIR,—Although I have not the honor to be personally\r\n    known to you, I venture to hope, as we have friends in common,\r\n    that you will not refuse to baptize my first-born son; and\r\n    I beg respectfully to ask whether it will be agreeable to\r\n    your engagements to perform this holy office on the day after\r\n    to-morrow, Wednesday, the 13th current, at about half-past\r\n    eleven, at my residence, Dorotheen-Strasse, No. 37, and for\r\n    this purpose would honor me with a visit. In case of your\r\n    consent, I trust you will make an appointment for to-morrow\r\n    afternoon or evening, when I can visit you and make the further\r\n    necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\n    With great respect, reverend sir, I remain faithfully,\r\n\r\n                            VON BISMARCK-SCHÖNHAUSEN, _M. Sec. Ch._\r\n\r\nAmong the friends who about that time visited Bismarck’s hospitable\r\nthough simple household in the Dorotheen-Strasse (afterwards in the\r\nBehren-Strasse, No. 60), we may name Von Savigny, André, and Von\r\nKleist-Retzow.\r\n\r\nBismarck’s life in those days was almost entirely absorbed by politics:\r\nsessions of the Chambers, commissions, committees, clubs, and\r\nappointments of all kinds occupied him, and politics formed the theme of\r\nthe conversations he held in the evening in the beer-saloon of Schwarz\r\n(corner of Friedichs and Leipziger Strassen), when he went in to drink a\r\nglass of Grünthaler beer. This beer-saloon—it is still existent, although\r\nin another locality and under other management—was a principal centre of\r\nthe conservatives; it was jestingly said, that even the landlord’s little\r\ndog was so conservative that he barked at every democrat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt another establishment, not that of Schwarz, Bismarck had a little\r\nadventure. He had just taken a seat, when a particularly offensive\r\nexpression was used at the next table concerning a member of the Royal\r\nFamily. Bismarck immediately rose to his full height, turned to the\r\nspeaker, and thundered forth:—“Out of the house! If you are not off when\r\nI have drunk this beer, I will break this glass on your head!” At this\r\nthere ensued a fierce commotion, and threatening outcries resounded\r\nin all directions. Without the slightest notice Bismarck finished his\r\ndraught, and then brought it down upon the offender’s pate with such\r\neffect that the glass flew into fragments, and the man fell down, howling\r\nwith anguish. There was a deep silence, during which Bismarck’s voice\r\nwas heard to say, in the quietest tone, as if nothing whatever had\r\ntaken place:—“Waiter, what is to pay for this broken glass?” At this\r\nexclamations were heard, but not against Bismarck; every one rejoiced and\r\ncried:—“That was right! That is the proper thing to do! The wretch richly\r\ndeserved it!” This deed had its intended effect, and Bismarck went on his\r\nway unmolested.\r\n\r\nThere was something indescribably commanding in his firm countenance,\r\nwith its close beard, and the cold glance which lay in his eyes, in his\r\nform and whole bearing, at this time. This a certain Herr Nelke (Pink)\r\nor Stengel (Stalk)—we are not certain of the name—one day learnt to\r\nhis cost. Bismarck was returning from Potsdam with the venerable and\r\nworthy Lieutenant-Colonel von Wolden, who is still remembered in certain\r\ncircles. In the coupé a silly bagman or something of that kind was making\r\na violent political speech, and at last ventured to ridicule and libel\r\nthe grizzly Lieutenant-Colonel to his face. Bismarck looked at the man,\r\nwho was continuing his insults, for a time, until the train stopped at\r\nthe station in Berlin. Bismarck paced along the platform at his full\r\nheight, and advanced in the firmest attitude to the chattering gentleman,\r\nso that he involuntarily receded a step with alarm. Silently Bismarck\r\napproached and drove him to the wall, and then simply asked him,\r\n\r\n“What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Nelke, my name is Nelke!” stammered the person addressed, with a pale\r\nand anxious face.\r\n\r\n“Then take care, you Nelke (Pink) you—or I shall have to pluck you!”\r\n\r\nHe then turned and left the poor Pink in a crushed state—but richer by a\r\ngolden lesson—leaning against the wall.\r\n\r\nBismarck wore a long yellowish-gray overcoat, which to this day is called\r\nin his house the “dyke coat,” as he was accustomed to put it on when\r\nhe visited the dyke, for which purpose it had done long and faithful\r\nservice. In Fritz Reuter’s “Journey to Constantinople” the Commerce\r\nCouncillor Schwofel says:—“In all Eisenach there are only three white\r\nhats; His Royal Highness wears one when he is there; Mr. O’Kelly wears\r\nthe second; and I wear the third. Certainly there are plenty more white\r\nhats in the place, but these are the most important.” We might say\r\nhere that Berlin in those days only contained three yellow overcoats;\r\nBismarck wore one of these; the immortal Baron von Hertefeld wore the\r\nsecond, until he died, the last of his memorable race, as Hereditary\r\nGrand Huntsman, at Cleve, in 1867; and the author of this book the third.\r\nThere might be many more yellow coats in Berlin, but these were the most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nBismarck very often, as did many members of the conservative\r\nparty, visited the office of the _New Prussian Gazette_, in the\r\nDessauer-Strasse, No. 5, to learn the news. He was one of those,\r\nhowever, who always brought more than he carried away. Bismarck is an\r\nadmirable narrator, especially of anecdotes, which he used to point\r\nwith epigrammatic skill; the under-current of little traits of malice\r\nare generally invested with a dose of good humor, so that the subject\r\nof the stories were obliged to laugh themselves. The Napoleonist Duc de\r\nPersigny would no doubt have laughed had he heard Bismarck in those days.\r\nFialin de Persigny at that time was intrusted with a political mission in\r\nBerlin, which he no doubt carried through to the greatest satisfaction of\r\nthe higher powers; but he exhibited such _disinvolture_ in the circles\r\nof the court society, and so naïve an admiration for female beauty, that\r\na number of tales passed current at his expense. Bismarck’s mode of\r\nnarration was only tinged with good humor in the majority of cases, not\r\nin all; he could be exceedingly peppery, and could give vent to severe\r\nsarcasms, and shoot off arrows which pierced through and through.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, not only a teller of anecdotes in the editorial room of\r\nthe _New Prussian Gazette_; he supported the paper he had contributed\r\nto found with original articles. These were mostly written at the great\r\nround table where so many distinguished men have taken their seats,\r\nfrom Von Radowitz and Bethmann-Hollweg to Count Arnim, Pernice, Stahl,\r\nVon Gerlach, and Huber; and he wrote in his peculiar firm, but high and\r\ncompact style. Sometimes he rushed into the room with hasty greeting, and\r\nstood at the high desk, retaining his hat and gloves in his left hand,\r\nand threw some lines swiftly on to paper. “Put the national motto to\r\nthese,” he would exclaim to the editor-in-chief, and ran off with another\r\nsalutation. He was always full of life and activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter the close of this session, on the 25th of February, 1850, he\r\nreturned for a short time to Schönhausen, and in the following April we\r\ndiscover him again in Erfurt, at the Union Parliament. He had, as we\r\nknow, been opposed from the very beginning to these attempts at union;\r\nthey were not, in his firm opinion, fraught with any fortunate omen to\r\nPrussia. The very next few months proved that his acute insight and his\r\nPrussian patriotism had not erred. We need not therefore be astonished\r\nthat he gave vent to his patriotic sorrow at the Erfurt project, and the\r\nhumiliations contemplated to Prussia thereby, in unmeasured language. He\r\nclosed one of his speeches of that time with the following sentences:—\r\n\r\n“It has been a painful feeling for me to see here Prussians, and not\r\nnominal Prussians only, who advocate this constitution, who have defended\r\nit with ardor. It would have been a humiliating feeling to me, and so\r\nit would have been to thousands and thousands of my fellow-countrymen,\r\nto see the representatives of princes whom I honor in their own sphere,\r\nbut who are not my liege-lords, clothed with supreme power; a feeling\r\nthe bitterness of which could not be diminished by seeing the seats we\r\noccupy decked with colors—never those of the German empire—but which for\r\ntwo years have been the colors of rebellion and of the barricades, colors\r\nworn in my native land by the democrat alone, except when in sorrowful\r\nobedience by the soldier. Gentlemen! If you make no more concessions\r\nthan are contained in this constitution to the Prussian—ancient Prussian\r\nspirit—call it obstinate Prussian feeling if you choose—I do not believe\r\nit will be realized; and if you endeavor to force this constitution on\r\nthis Prussian spirit, you will find it to be a Bucephalus, who bears\r\nhis accustomed lord and rider with daring joy, but who will cast the\r\nunwelcome Sunday rider with his black-red-gold harness to the earth. I\r\nfind one comfort against these eventualities in the firm conviction that\r\nno long time will elapse ere the parties to this constitution will stand,\r\nas, in the fable of Lafontaine, the two doctors stood by the patient\r\nwhose corpse they were abandoning. The one said, ‘He is dead, I said so\r\nfrom the beginning!’—the other, ‘Had he followed my advice, he would have\r\nbeen alive now.’”\r\n\r\nThe further debates of the Erfurt Parliament gave him leisure enough,\r\nbut this leisure brought no vigor with it, for the impression of a great\r\npolitical blunder sat heavy on the souls of Bismarck and his political\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nBismarck wished to reinvigorate himself by a thorough hunting-party;\r\nhe conferred with the Privy Councillor Oppermann, one of the “mighty\r\nhunters” of Prussia; this gentleman joined him with enthusiasm, and they\r\ncommunicated through the Oberforstmeister von Wedell, in Schleusingen,\r\nto obtain a woodcock foray with the famous shot Oberförster Klingner.\r\nBismarck and Oppermann left Erfurt one morning together. At the first\r\nstage the travellers refreshed themselves at Arnstadt, as keen sportsmen,\r\nthinking nothing of the caddish opinions of the day, by a plentiful\r\nbreakfast at eight o’clock, of delicate groundlings, and drank 1811\r\nBocksbeutel therewith. At the succeeding stations they whetted their\r\nappetites with trout, and drank beer with them, as the nectar of 1811\r\nwould allow no other wines to attract the palate. On their arrival in\r\nSchleusingen at 3 P.M., they had more trout and beer, then an interview\r\nand arrangements with the Oberförster, and in the evening more trout,\r\nwhich Oppermann ate with wine sauce, Bismarck remaining true to beer\r\ndespite of urgent dissuasions. At night, about 12 o’clock, the\r\nOberförster made his appearance with a keeper, to take the gentlemen off\r\nto the forest. Bismarck, however, was in a very lamentable plight; the\r\nmixture of fish and beer did not suit his constitution, and he was in a\r\nfeverish state. He was advised to have some peppermint and stop in bed,\r\nbut it was in vain; the keen sportsman was not afraid of stomach-ache; he\r\nwas soon dressed, and away they went. Oppermann fired and killed a bird,\r\nbut Bismarck returned home with nothing. He had put up two woodcocks,\r\nbut at the decisive moment he fired both times at the wrong instant.\r\nThe keeper showed him another woodcock, but Bismarck was unfit for any\r\nfurther exertion; he returned to Schleusingen and went to bed. By eleven\r\no’clock the mischief was ended by some strong grog, and the sportsmen\r\nthen went by the express coach over the hills, and arrived very merrily\r\nin Erfurt by the evening. Bismarck, however, has never taken beer upon\r\ntrout since.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Erfurt, Dr. Stahl was presented with an album by his\r\nadmirers. On its eleventh page, the album (which was afterwards printed)\r\ncontains the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n    “Our watchword therefore is not ‘A United State at any price,’\r\n    but, ‘The independence of the Prussian Crown at every price.’\r\n\r\n                                             “BISMARCK-SCHÖNHAUSEN,\r\n                                          _Deputy for Brandenburg_.\r\n\r\n    “Erfurt, 24th April, 1850.”\r\n\r\nThis expression, if we are not mistaken, was a quotation from a speech\r\nmade by Stahl, at that time in Erfurt. Evidently it came from Bismarck’s\r\ninmost soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Erfurt, Bismarck dedicated some weeks to his\r\nbusiness in Schönhausen, and then travelled into Pomerania with his\r\nfamily. It is this journey of which such humorous mention is made in the\r\ntwo following letters to his sister:\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO FRAU VON ARNIM.\r\n\r\n                                      Schönhausen, 28th June, 1850.\r\n\r\n    I write you a solemn letter of congratulation on the occasion\r\n    (I think) of your twenty-fourth birthday. (I won’t tell any\r\n    body of this.) You are now really a major, or, rather, would\r\n    have been so, had you not had the misfortune to belong to the\r\n    female sex, whose limbs, in the eyes of jurists, can never\r\n    emerge from minority—not even when they are the mothers of the\r\n    lustiest of Jacks. Why this apparent injustice is a very wise\r\n    arrangement I will instruct you, when, I hope some fortnight\r\n    hence, I have you _à la portée de la voix humaine_ before me.\r\n    Johanna—who at the present time is in the arms of Lieutenant\r\n    Morpheus—will have written to you what is in prospect for\r\n    me. The boy bellowing in a major key, the girl in minor, two\r\n    singing nurse-girls, wet napkins and milk-bottles, myself in\r\n    the character of an affectionate Paterfamilias. I resisted a\r\n    long time, but as all the mothers and aunts were unanimous that\r\n    poor little Molly could only be cured by sea-water and air,\r\n    I should, if I resisted any longer, have my avarice and my\r\n    paternal barbarity paraded before me on the occasion of every\r\n    cold the child will catch till it is seventy, with the words:\r\n    “Don’t you see! Ah! if the poor child could but have gone to\r\n    the seaside!” The little being is suffering from the eyes,\r\n    which are tearful and sticky. Perhaps this arises from the salt\r\n    baths, perhaps from eye-teeth. Johanna is dreadfully excited\r\n    about it, and for her satisfaction I have sent to-day for Dr.\r\n    Bünger, at Stendal, who is the Fanninger of the Alt Mark. We\r\n    take it for granted that you will be at home next month, and\r\n    do not contemplate an excursion yourselves, in which event we\r\n    would defer our visit until our return. But we write in order\r\n    to settle time and place. I have very unwillingly decided to\r\n    abandon my country laziness here, but now that it is settled, I\r\n    see rose-colored hues in the affair, and am heartily delighted\r\n    to seek you in the cavern, which I only know to be situated\r\n    some ten feet above the earth, and hope to seize the herring\r\n    myself in the depths of the Baltic. Johanna is still asleep,\r\n    or she would certainly send many greetings. For reasons of\r\n    health I now rise at six o’clock. Hoping soon to see you, I\r\n    invoke God’s blessing on you and yours, for this year and all\r\n    those to come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                       Schönhausen, 8th July, 1850.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday a letter arrived from Oscar, according to which he\r\n    will also be in Berlin to-morrow, but will not return until\r\n    Thursday. I am very sorry your horses will be kept at work\r\n    for two days together, but Oscar will not be able to set out\r\n    on Wednesday, and it would be inconvenient for us to remain\r\n    a day and a half in Berlin without any business whatever, or\r\n    any other motive. The children and servants, Oscar, Johanna,\r\n    and I, could not go in one carriage. I therefore remain, and\r\n    my principal reason for writing to you is in relation to my\r\n    former letter, according to which we should reach Angermünde\r\n    on Wednesday and find horses at Gerswalde, unless you have\r\n    arranged it yourselves differently—in which case Oscar will let\r\n    me know, and it will be all right. I do not wish to propose\r\n    any other route, or it will bring the horses into confusion,\r\n    from the little time before us. This journey I perceive will\r\n    give me an introduction to the new Lunatic Asylum, or at least\r\n    the Second Chamber, for life. I already see myself on the\r\n    platform at Genthin with the children; then both of us in the\r\n    carriage with all sort of infantine requirements, businesses\r\n    at which one turns up one’s nose—Johanna does not like to\r\n    give the boy the breast, and he roars himself blue—then come\r\n    official crowds, the inn, with both howlers in the Stettin\r\n    railway-yard—at Angermünde, we shall have to wait an hour for\r\n    the horses, and pack ourselves up again. How shall we get from\r\n    Kröchlendorf to Külz? If we have to remain a night in Stettin\r\n    it will be horrible. Last year I had to undergo all this with\r\n    Marie and her screaming. Yesterday I got so despairing as to\r\n    all these things that I positively determined to give the whole\r\n    journey up, and so went to bed, determined at least to coach\r\n    it right through or stop somewhere. But what do we not do for\r\n    domestic peace? “The young cousins ought to know each other,\r\n    and who can tell when Johanna will see you again?” In the night\r\n    she attacked me with the boy in her arms, and with the arts\r\n    that lost us Paradise she naturally succeeded, and every thing\r\n    remains as before. But I feel that I am myself the victim of\r\n    a terrible wrong; next year I shall be forced to travel about\r\n    with three cradles, nurses, sheets, and all the rest. I wake\r\n    at six o’clock in a mild rage, and can sleep no more, from the\r\n    pictures of travel which my fancy paints me in the blackest\r\n    hues—down to the picnics in the sandhills of Stolpmünde. And\r\n    even were one’s expenses paid! But to throw away the ruins of\r\n    a once brilliant fortune by travelling about with suckling\r\n    children! I am very unhappy!\r\n\r\n    Therefore, on Wednesday we reach Gerswalde. Perhaps I had in\r\n    the end better have gone by way of Passow, and you would not\r\n    have had to send so far to Prenzlau as to G. However, it is a\r\n    _fait accompli_; and the misery of choice is succeeded by the\r\n    rest of resignation. Johanna greets you and packs. We shall\r\n    send some of our things per freight; Johanna is therefore in\r\n    some anxiety about her toilette, in case you Boitzenbürgers\r\n    have company.\r\n\r\nThe period till the latter autumn of 1850 was very instructive to\r\nBismarck as a politician; he continued to observe—we should, had not his\r\nPrussian heart been in the task, have said with scientific attention\r\nand curiosity—the effort made by Radowitz to save the Union; he was\r\nastonished at the dexterity of this statesman, but he also saw clearly\r\nthat all this dexterity would fail, for want of real pressure. Bismarck\r\nlearnt that it was as impossible to create a German Unity as any\r\nother form of state, if one is wanting in courage or power to exert a\r\nsufficient pressure upon that which opposes. While Austria opposed, union\r\nwas not possible without war, nor did Bismarck forget this truth.\r\n\r\nThe triple alliance collapsed, war was forbidden by the political facts\r\nof the time—the union was abandoned, Herr von Radowitz resigned, and Herr\r\nvon Manteuffel, who then entered upon his office as Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, went to Olmütz.\r\n\r\nWhat a terrible outcry was raised as to this visit to Olmütz at the time,\r\nand how greatly Herr von Manteuffel was censured on the subject! Prussian\r\nfeeling was deeply wounded, and was worthy of much respect; it was a\r\nsevere transposition—but from Erfurt to Olmütz was a necessity, if it\r\nwere not resolved to break the opposition of Austria by the sword. Herr\r\nvon Manteuffel, however, who entered upon this severe task in patriotic\r\ndevotion to his country, certainly did not deserve the flood of abuse\r\nwhich was heaped upon his head for many years. He, at least, had not led\r\nPrussia to Erfurt.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d December, 1850, Bismarck in a long speech defended the policy\r\nof the Ministry respecting the negotiations at Olmütz. He emphasized the\r\ncommunity of interests existing between Prussia and Austria in reference\r\nto revolution, on the community of action of both States in German\r\naffairs. He censured war, by which Prussia would have set her existence\r\nupon the hazard of the die, in view of the threatening attitude abroad,\r\nand would have done so, not for herself, but for the lurking democracy.\r\nIt will be understood that much of the so-called disgrace of Olmütz was\r\ncast upon Bismarck, and he was bitterly censured until the year 1866 for\r\nhaving defended those negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session Bismarck had an opportunity of pronouncing a\r\nbrilliant defense of the Prussian nobility, then assailed with unequalled\r\nlicense and malice. His words were these:—\r\n\r\n“You ought not to undervalue in these latter days the services of that\r\nclass, whether as officers of the army, or in such positions where landed\r\nproperty enables it to fight against anarchy and for the salvation of\r\nPrussia. The nobility of Prussia has in these affairs been spinning\r\nno silk, take it as a whole; it will be remembered that its immediate\r\nancestry conquered the Westphalian Land Tax in the Rhine Province, and\r\nthat its grandfathers paid for the Patow Promemoria with their blood in\r\nSilesia. In like manner, you will find the sons of this class ever among\r\nthe truest servants of the country. It is true the Prussian nobility have\r\nhad their Jena; in common with the political associates of those who now\r\nattack it, they have had their Second United Diet. If, however, I survey\r\ntheir history as a great whole, I believe there exist no reasons for\r\nsuch attacks as we hear in this place, and I do not think it necessary\r\nto despair of discovering within this class worthy members of a Prussian\r\npeerage.”\r\n\r\nTo the continually reiterated taunt concerning Junkerdom and the Junker\r\nparty, he fearlessly replied:—\r\n\r\n“I am proud to be a Prussian Junker, and feel honored, by the\r\nappellation. Whigs and Tories were terms which once also had a very mean\r\nsignification; and be assured, gentlemen, that we shall on our part bring\r\nJunkerdom to be regarded with honor and respect.”\r\n\r\nWe here take leave of Bismarck’s activity as a conservative party leader\r\nin the Second Chamber. This volcanic earth in the Hardenberg Palace,\r\non the Dönhoffsplatz, he only re-entered eleven years afterwards as a\r\nMinister, although in the winter of 1851-’2 he several times came from\r\nFrankfurt to Berlin, and also appeared in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Fourth.\r\n\r\nON THE VOYAGE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE VOYAGE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nON THE VOYAGE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n[1851-1859.]\r\n\r\n    Ambassador.—Interview with the King.—Lieut.-General von\r\n    Rochow.—Anecdotes.—Frankfurt.—Reception of the Prince of\r\n    Prussia.—Society at Frankfurt.—The King’s Birthday.—Position of\r\n    Prussia.—Correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt some resting-place on a journey into Pomerania which Bismarck\r\nundertook in the early spring of 1851, he heard from several persons of\r\nhis appointment as Ambassador to the Diet in Frankfurt-on-the Maine,\r\nwhere the Diet was just then re-assembling. That this was not true he\r\nknew, but that he was very likely intended for the post he considered far\r\nfrom impossible. He thought deeply over the matter; the reflection was a\r\nnovel one, but by no means unwelcome; to him a parliamentary career had\r\nbecome the less pleasing the longer he had followed it—he was not vain\r\nenough for that: his manly self-confidence, however, was considerable,\r\nand perhaps he thought of his mother’s predictions. On his return to\r\nBerlin, after minute self-examination, he determined to accept the\r\nposition of Ambassador to the Diet, should it be offered him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether the idea of intrusting Bismarck with this\r\noffice—unquestionably the most important which Prussia at that time had\r\nto fill—first occurred to Frederick William IV. himself, or whether\r\nit was the thought of the Minister von Manteuffel; at any rate it was\r\nfounded on the assumption that Bismarck would be a _persona grata_ to\r\nAustria, as it was then Prussia’s problem to treat of German politics\r\nwith the best understanding towards Austria. It was the custom of\r\nFrederick William IV., who more than proved how dear every thing that\r\nconcerned Germany was to his heart, to select his Ambassador to the Diet\r\nwith the utmost care; and the delicate circumstances of the time rendered\r\nthe necessity for caution all the greater. Yet, it will be said, on this\r\noccasion his choice fell upon a man who had hitherto never served in\r\ndiplomatic matters. We certainly know from the mouth of a Minister of\r\nState, on very confidential terms with the King, that the latter “was\r\nmuch attached to Bismarck, and expected great things at his hands.”\r\n\r\nBismarck paid a visit to Herr von Manteuffel; the latter soon told\r\nhim that His Majesty the King desired to speak with him, and then,\r\nwithout any circumlocution, asked him in what his views concerning\r\nthe ambassadorship consisted. The cautious Minister was not a little\r\nsurprised when Bismarck, in so many words, declared himself prepared\r\nto undertake it. He was evidently not without hesitation at so rapid\r\na decision; desiring him, however, to wait upon His Majesty the King\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nBismarck was received by his King, at Sans-Souci, with that favor and\r\ngrace which he ever evinced towards him; but the King was even perhaps\r\nmore astonished than his Prime Minister, when Bismarck frankly and\r\nhonestly declared—“If your Majesty is desirous of trying the experiment,\r\nI am ready to fulfill your wishes!”\r\n\r\nFrederick William IV. perhaps thought there was a certain degree of\r\ntemerity in the rapid decision of Bismarck, and drew his attention to the\r\nsignificance and difficulty of the position.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty can surely try me,” replied Bismarck; “if it prove a\r\nfailure, I can be recalled in six months, or even sooner than that!”\r\n\r\nDespite all the doubts and hesitation which arose in his mind, the King\r\nremained firm to his intention, and in May, 1851, Bismarck was appointed\r\nto the post of First Secretary of the Embassy to the Diet, with the title\r\nof Privy Councillor.\r\n\r\nHe immediately departed for his post. He here found himself on new,\r\nand, to him, entirely strange ground, and his duty was certainly not\r\nrendered easy for him. Lieut.-General Theodor Rochus von Rochow, who\r\nwas to introduce him to his new position, kept him at a distance from\r\nactual business, with the well-known and intelligible jealousy which\r\nmost men entertain towards their successors in office. Herr von Gruner\r\nwas a liberal and an opponent of Bismarck’s, but the other German\r\nrepresentatives felt a sort of virtuous shudder at the famous reactionary\r\nJunker. Perhaps the Presiding Deputy, Count von Thun-Hohenstein, who\r\nthought to see in Bismarck the thorough partisan of Austria, was the\r\nonly person who bid him welcome, at the same time with the intention of\r\ncausing him to see what marked influence Austria possessed. This was a\r\nrather strong diplomatic blunder, for Bismarck knew precisely how to take\r\nand retain his proper position.\r\n\r\nA pretty anecdote was related at the time, for which certainly we can not\r\nabsolutely vouch, but if not true, it might have been. Bismarck one day\r\npaid the Presiding Deputy a visit. Count Thun received him with a sort of\r\nbrusque familiarity, went on coolly smoking his cigar, and did not even\r\nask Bismarck to take a chair. The latter simply took out his cigar-case,\r\npulled out a cigar, and said, in an easy tone, “May I beg a light,\r\nExcellency?” Excellency, astonished to the greatest degree, supplied the\r\ndesired light. Bismarck got a good blaze up and then took the unoffered\r\nseat in the coolest way in the world, and led the way to a conversation.\r\n\r\nBismarck never allowed any liberties with himself, but still less would\r\nhe tolerate them when they were offered to him as the representative of\r\nhis Sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn the August of the same year he received the rank of Ambassador.\r\nThe Councillors at the Embassy consisted of the Legations—Rath Otto\r\nWentzel, and as Attachés, the Count Lynar, and Count Theodor of\r\nStolberg-Wernigerode.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Rochow continued his jealous behavior to the end. On the day\r\nof his departure he pretended to send Bismarck the current papers in a\r\ngreen portfolio; but Bismarck found it empty. Bismarck immediately went\r\nto the station, which Rochow had not expected, and was accordingly much\r\nembarrassed. In the choicest expressions, Bismarck thanked him for all\r\nthe delicate kindnesses he had experienced from him, and added, that he\r\npresumed to ascribe it to the friendship that Rochow had entertained for\r\nhis deceased father. These few moments could scarcely have been very\r\npleasant to the poor General.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring this first visit to Frankfurt, Bismarck resided with his friend\r\nCount Lynar (who subsequently died at Paris), in the house of M. Krug,\r\na merchant, in the Hoch-Strasse, whose wife was a native of Berlin.\r\nHe was unable to work much at the Bills of the Bund, and General von\r\nRochow, famous for his wit, jested not a little at Bismarck’s late habits\r\nof rising, although he was far more industrious than was generally\r\napparent, being engaged in an active correspondence with his political\r\nfriends in Berlin, especially with the Actual Privy Councillor, Freiherr\r\nvon Manteuffel II. Before dinner he usually rode out, and, in order to\r\nfeel his ground, visited the neighboring Courts of Darmstadt, Biebrich,\r\nand Karlsruhe, where his old friend Von Savigny was then Prussian Envoy.\r\nAn acute, sometimes a severe, judge of character, as well as an observer\r\nof passing events; Bismarck had, at the desire, or, at any rate, with\r\nthe consent of Rochow, undertaken an immediate part in the press. The\r\narticles contributed or suggested by him created much attention; they\r\npossessed wit and point, often destroying the arguments of his opponents;\r\nthis became his peculiar province. At other times, as a new man in\r\ndiplomacy, he assisted at the discussions in the society of Herr von\r\nRochow, in order to become familiar with the course of business and the\r\nexterior formalities of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July, 1851, the then Prince of Prussia (now King) visited\r\nFrankfurt, and was received by the body corporate of the Bund, and the\r\ngeneral staff. The Prince was graciously inclined towards Bismarck,\r\nbut made some observations during his passage to the terminus to Herr\r\nvon Rochow, on the anomaly of this militia-lieutenant—for Bismarck had\r\nappeared in uniform, being a Deputy of the Bund. General von Rochow,\r\nhowever, who was wise enough not to undervalue Bismarck’s importance,\r\nalthough he did not always testify the liveliest friendship towards\r\nhim, replied, “The selection is worthy, novel, and vigorous; your Royal\r\nHighness will certainly find all your requirements fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Prince could reply nothing to this, and, in fact, he certainly\r\nentertained the most favorable opinion of this still somewhat youthful\r\nchampion of the justice and the honor of Prussia.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” General von Rochow said at the time, “he only wished\r\nhim to have possessed gray hair and a few additional years; but it is\r\nquestionable whether the plans of the Prince would be much nearer their\r\nfulfillment for those.”\r\n\r\nThis is all very characteristic, considering the relation destined at\r\na future time to subsist between King William and Bismarck. Personal\r\ngood-will in the highest degree he entertained for him, but want of\r\nconfidence in his youth and inexperience.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Prussia frequently alluded to this view, but Rochow found\r\nmeans of quieting his fears. Otherwise he was fond of having Bismarck\r\nabout him, conversed with him freely, drove about, and soon went to the\r\ntheatre with him. The Prince exhibited real friendship for Bismarck, and,\r\non the occasion of the birth of a son, in the following year (2d August,\r\n1852), became its sponsor. Bismarck’s younger son is named William after\r\nhis royal godfather, although his usual name has continued to be “Bill.”\r\nGeneral von Rochow also, on his return to his post at St. Petersburg,\r\nfreely stated his anticipation of great things from the talents and\r\ndecision of character of his successor at Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck became Envoy to the Bund, on the 18th August, 1851, he\r\nrented a villa of the younger Rothschild of Naples, distant some quarter\r\nof an hour from the city gate on the Bockenheimer Chaussée, close to the\r\nfrontier of Hesse; the same dwelling previously inhabited by the Archduke\r\nJohn in his official capacity as Imperial Curator. In the garden, as upon\r\nthe flight of steps, the most magnificent flowers were arranged; it is\r\nsaid there were more than one thousand camellias. Bismarck’s house, after\r\nthe arrival of Madame von Bismarck with her children, became the most\r\nprominently hospitable house in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nHe soon became intimate with the Austrian Ambassador. Count Thun was a\r\nnoble cavalier, and his very handsome wife, born a Countess Lamberg, knew\r\nhow to invest his house with great attractions. Bismarck also managed\r\nto keep on terms with Count Thun’s successor, the well-known Freiherr\r\nProkesch von Osten, whose hatred of Prussia was so little a secret that\r\nhis nomination to the office was regarded as a demonstration against\r\nPrussia; and this Bismarck did without in the least lowering the dignity\r\nof Prussia—a problem somewhat difficult, considering the reputation of\r\nthis entirely Eastern diplomatist. Of a much more friendly character were\r\nhis relations to Count Rechberg, who replaced Prokesch.\r\n\r\nThe other representatives with whom Bismarck came into more intimate\r\ncontact were, Von Scherff, who represented the King of the Netherlands\r\nas Grand-duke of Luxemburg, Von Fritsch (Grand-duke of Saxony), Von\r\nBülow (King of Denmark as Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg), Von Oertzen\r\n(Mecklenburg), and Von Eisendecher (Oldenburg). Bismarck farmed some\r\nsporting in conjunction with the English Ambassador, Sir Alexander Malet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBesides enjoying the society of the diplomatists, Bismarck liked to\r\nmingle with the Prussian and foreign higher military officers; to\r\nhis dinners, soirées, and balls, he also invited musicians, authors,\r\nand artists—a fact not of very frequent occurrence among the chief\r\ndiplomatists in Frankfurt, and one which created some notice. His\r\nintercourse with these circles was principally conducted by the highly\r\nesteemed artist Professor Becker, who, with his wife and handsome\r\ndaughters, belonged to the most intimate society of his house. The\r\nexcellent portrait of Bismarck which hangs in the room of the Countess at\r\nBerlin, is by Professor Becker.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable than this intercourse with painters and sculptors\r\nwere certain domestic festivals, of which the people of Frankfurt had\r\nnever even dreamt before, and in which he was imitated by no one. He used\r\nto give a feast to the domestics of his Pomeranian and Alt Mark property\r\non Twelfth Night, in the old Pomeranian style—about which there was much\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant festival of the year was that of the 15th October,\r\non the birthday of the King. In the morning there was solemn service in\r\nthe large Reformed Church in the Corn-market, at which Bismarck attended\r\nwith the whole suite of the Embassy in full gala dress. Then followed\r\na magnificent dinner, and in the evening he was accustomed to visit\r\nthe Prussian soldiers, who lay in garrison in Frankfurt, amidst their\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBismarck will never be forgotten by the Prussian soldiers who were in\r\nFrankfurt during his days; they all knew him, for at every solemnity he\r\nappeared in his uniform as Landwehr Lieutenant, with the “Safety” Medal,\r\nto witness the parades and exercises.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers always called him “His Excellency Herr Lieutenant von\r\nBismarck;” they loved him sincerely, because they felt that he loved\r\nevery Prussian soldier.\r\n\r\nThe “Safety” Medal was no longer solitary upon his breast; the time had\r\narrived when stars and grand crosses were sent to him from every side.\r\n\r\nPrussian travellers on their journey were hospitably received at his\r\nhouse, and many of those who were returning from the Rhenish Baths, he\r\nnot only invited to dinner, but, in the discreetest manner, aided with\r\nloans, often of the greatest necessity to them. In short, Bismarck not\r\nonly represented his Sovereign in the most brilliant but the wisest\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWhen with considerable rapidity he had familiarized himself with the\r\nduties of his office, he began to work with assiduity and continuity.\r\nAfter tea, at ten o’clock, he often dictated for three or four hours, and\r\nso well, that there was seldom any necessity for altering a word, so that\r\ndispatches could be forwarded to Berlin by half-past six.\r\n\r\nAfter business and receptions, which latter often rendered quiet\r\nnecessary, his recreations consisted of hunting and riding. He often had\r\nhis horse saddled at four in the morning, and rode for miles into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe more brilliant the social position of Bismarck had become, the more\r\ndifficult and thorny the political position remained. He was conscious—we\r\nmay say, to his great sorrow—from the very beginning, that the equal\r\nrights of Prussia which he had always assumed, in speaking of going\r\nhand-in-hand with Austria, as to German affairs, were not recognized\r\nby Austria, but, on the contrary, she endeavored, with suspicious and\r\ninimical feelings, to increase the difficulties which Prussia had to\r\nfight against with all her might. Bismarck, by his personal influence,\r\nhad now obtained a few advantages, and worked decisively through the\r\npress, on which he not only fixed his attention, but to which he devoted\r\nhis personal activity. In the matters of the Zollverein, he had a severe\r\nand especial battle to fight, against the machinations of Austrian\r\npolitics. The _Hanover Zeitung_ published angry articles against the\r\nratification of the treaty of 7th September, 1851, just concluded with\r\nPrussia. It was the personal influence of Bismarck alone upon the\r\nHanoverian Ambassador, Von Schele, that caused the opposition against the\r\nratification of this treaty to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn the Diet itself, Bismarck was successful in establishing such an\r\norder of business, to some extent limiting the arbitrary action of the\r\nPresident, and finally led to some method in the debates of the Diet. It\r\nmight even be said that he soon attained a leading power in the Diet,\r\nand thereby worked blessings for Prussia; but even all this could not\r\nalter the unfortunate position of Prussian Germany, founded as it was\r\nupon the principles of the Diet and the Zollverein. Had Austria given its\r\ngood-will, all this might have been effected, but in the teeth of its\r\nill-will, the whole negotiations could only terminate in ruin or in a\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nThe position of Prussia consisted in the fact, that the constitution\r\nof the Diet had only become possible through the policy of Prince\r\nMetternich. This policy, which advocated a probable segregation of\r\nAustria from Germany, and at least left Prussia free room to act in North\r\nGermany, ever moved in the most limited grooves. As Prince Schwarzenberg\r\nadopted a policy diametrically opposed to this, which consciously and\r\ndeliberately determined upon the humiliation of Prussia, in order\r\nafterwards to destroy it, and violated every form with the uttermost\r\ncarelessness, the conflict could only be a matter of time.\r\n\r\nBismarck was therefore necessarily made an antagonist of Austria by\r\nthe Schwarzenberg policy, continued by Count Buol Schauenstein; and\r\nopposition against the anti-Prussian policy of the Vienna Cabinet became\r\nthe watchword for his political activity. This was soon very apparent,\r\nnor did he conceal it the less, as his vigorous patriotism impelled him\r\nto bring his opposition actually to bear; his frankness also rendered any\r\nequivocation impossible. In such a course he could hardly depend upon any\r\nco-operation from the King and the Prime Minister, Von Manteuffel, who\r\nboth hoped, discouraged by the failure of the Union negotiations, that\r\nAustria might still revert to the earlier pro-Prussian policy of Prince\r\nMetternich. Bismarck himself, although he could scarcely hope this,\r\nardently desired it. A position worthy of the Prussian kingdom in Germany\r\nwas that for which he had to strive—a position it ought to occupy, if it\r\nwere to worthily maintain its place in Europe; and desired to secure to\r\nthe German people those advantages, to be resigned by no people unless\r\nat the peril of political death. Bismarck was determined to devote his\r\nlife to aiding the Prussian Crown in the attainment of this position.\r\nHe would rather have gone hand-in-hand with Austria; if this were an\r\nimpossibility, then without Austria; but should it prove necessary, then\r\nantagonism to Austria. It must not be overlooked how, in the sequel,\r\nBismarck in every political struggle attempted to accomplish it in union\r\nwith Austria, in which he was sometimes successful, and how, when it\r\nwas impossible, he continued the effort without Austria, and finally in\r\nopposition to Austria. It were superfluous here to pursue Bismarck’s\r\npolitical career in the details of his German policy.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence (rearranged by the translator in their\r\nproper chronological order) passed during these years.\r\n\r\n                                          Frankfurt, 18th May, ’51.\r\n\r\n    Frankfurt is wretchedly wearisome; I am so spoilt with having\r\n    so much affection about me, and a great deal to do; and I now\r\n    first perceive how unthankful I have been towards many people\r\n    in Berlin—for I will not take you and yours into the question.\r\n    Even the coolness of fellow-countrymen and party associates\r\n    I had in Berlin is an intimate connection compared with the\r\n    relations one makes here; being, in fact, nothing more than\r\n    mutual suspicious espionage. If one had any thing indeed\r\n    to detect or to conceal! The people here worry themselves\r\n    about the merest trifles; and these diplomatists, with their\r\n    important nothings, already appear more ridiculous to me than\r\n    a Deputy of the Second Chamber in his full-blown dignity.\r\n    Unless outward events take place—and those we clever members\r\n    of the Diet can neither guide nor predetermine—I now know\r\n    accurately what we shall have done in one, two, or five years,\r\n    and could bring it about in twenty-four hours, if the others\r\n    would for a single day be reasonable and truthful. I never\r\n    doubted that they all made soup with water; but such a simple,\r\n    thin water-gruel, in which you can’t see a globule of fat,\r\n    astonishes me! Send me Justice X. or Herr von Sarsky hither\r\n    from the toll-gate, when they are washed and combed, and I will\r\n    lord it in diplomacy with them. I am making enormous progress\r\n    in the art of saying nothing in a great many words. I write\r\n    reports of many sheets, which read as tersely and roundly as\r\n    leading articles; and if Manteuffel can say what there is in\r\n    them, after he has read them, he can do more than I can.\r\n\r\n    Each of us pretends to believe of his neighbor that he is\r\n    full of thoughts and plans, if he would only tell; and at the\r\n    same time we none of us know an atom more of what is going\r\n    to happen to Germany than of next year’s snow. Nobody, not\r\n    even the most malicious skeptic of a democrat, believes what\r\n    quackery and self-importance there is in this diplomatizing.\r\n    Well, I have railed long enough, and now I will tell you that\r\n    I am very well. Yesterday I was in Mainz: the neighborhood is\r\n    lovely. The rye is in full ear, although it is infamously cold\r\n    all night and in the mornings. Excursions by railroad are the\r\n    best here. One can reach Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Odenwald,\r\n    Homburg, Soden, Wiesbaden, Bingen, Rüdesheim, and Niederwald\r\n    comfortably in one day, stop five or six hours, and return\r\n    here in the evening. Until now I have not gone much about, but\r\n    shall do so, that I may take you about when you come. Rochow\r\n    started yesterday for Warsaw—he went off at nine o’clock in the\r\n    evening; the day after to-morrow he will be there, and probably\r\n    back in a week. As to politics and people, I can not write\r\n    much, as most of the letters are opened here. When they know\r\n    your address on mine, and your handwriting on your letters,\r\n    they will very likely find out they have no time to read family\r\n    letters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Frankfurt, 3d July, 1851.\r\n\r\n    The day before yesterday I thankfully received your letter and\r\n    the news that you were all well. But do not forget, when you\r\n    write to me, that the letters are not only read by myself,\r\n    but by all sorts of postal spies; and do not inveigh against\r\n    certain persons in them, for that is all set down to the\r\n    husband—to my account; besides, you do the people injustice.\r\n    As to my appointment or non-appointment, I know no more than\r\n    was told me at my departure: all other things are possibilities\r\n    and conjectures. What is irregular in the matter is the silence\r\n    of the Government towards me, as it would be as well to let\r\n    me know for certain, and indeed officially, whether I am to\r\n    live here or in Pomerania with wife and child next month. Be\r\n    prudent in all you say to people, then, without exception—not\r\n    only against ——, particularly in opinions of persons, for you\r\n    can not conceive what one has to endure if one once becomes an\r\n    object of observation; be assured that whatever you say in the\r\n    —— or the bathing-machine is served up with sauce either here\r\n    or at Sans-Souci. Forgive me for scolding you so, but after\r\n    your last letter I must take up the diplomatic hedge-knife. If\r\n    —— and others could sow distrust in our diplomatic camp, they\r\n    would thereby attain one of the chief ends of their letter\r\n    robberies. I went the day before yesterday to Wiesbaden to ——,\r\n    and, with a mixture of sadness and wisdom, we went to see the\r\n    scene of former folly. Would it might please God to fill this\r\n    vessel with his clear and strong wine, in which formerly the\r\n    champagne of twenty-one years of youth foamed uselessly, and\r\n    left nothing but loathing behind. Where now are —— and Miss ——?\r\n    How many are buried with whom I then flirted, drank, and diced?\r\n    How many transformations have taken place in my views of the\r\n    world in these fourteen years, among which I have ever looked\r\n    upon the actually Present as the True? How little are some\r\n    things to me that then appeared great? How much is venerable\r\n    to me now, that I then ridiculed? How much foliage may bud,\r\n    grow green, give shadow, rustle, and worthlessly fade within\r\n    the next fourteen years, till 1865, if we live to see it? I\r\n    can not understand how a man who considers his own nature, and\r\n    yet knows nothing of God, and will know nothing, can endure\r\n    his existence from contempt and wearisomeness. I know not how\r\n    I could formerly support it; were I to live as then, without\r\n    God, without you, without my children! I should not, indeed,\r\n    know whether I had not better abandon life like a dirty shirt;\r\n    and yet most of my acquaintances are in that state, and live\r\n    on! If I ask of an individual, what object he has in living\r\n    on, in laboring and growing angry, in intriguing and spying,\r\n    I obtain no answer. Do not conclude from this _tirade_ that\r\n    my mood is dark; on the contrary, I feel like a person who\r\n    looks, on a fine September morning, on the yellowing foliage;\r\n    I am healthy and cheerful, but I feel some melancholy, some\r\n    longing for home, a desire for forests, ocean, wilderness, for\r\n    you and my children, mingled with the impressions of sunset\r\n    and of Beethoven. Instead of which I have to pay dreary visits\r\n    to —— and read endless ciphers about German steam corvettes\r\n    and cannon-balls, rusting and eating up money in Bremerhaven.\r\n    I should like to have a horse, but I could not ride alone—it\r\n    is too wearisome; and the society with whom one rides is also\r\n    wearisome. And now I must go to Rochow, and to all sorts of-ins\r\n    and-offs, who are here with the Archduchess Olga.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Frankfurt, 8th July, 1851.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday and to-day I have been anxious to write to you,\r\n    but in the whirl of business could not get so far until the\r\n    evening late, on my return from a walk during which I blew\r\n    away the dust of business with the summer night’s breeze,\r\n    moonlight, and the rustle of poplar foliage. On Saturday\r\n    afternoon I went with Rochow and Lynar to Rüdesheim. I there\r\n    took a boat, went out on the Rhine, and swam in the moonlight,\r\n    eyes and nose only above the tepid water, to the Rat Tower,\r\n    near Bingen, where the bad bishop met his end. There is\r\n    something strangely dreamy to lie in the water on a still\r\n    night, slowly driven by the stream, seeing the heavens, with\r\n    moon and stars, above, and on either hand the wood-capped\r\n    mountains and city spires in the moonlight, without hearing any\r\n    thing but one’s own gentle splashing. I should like to swim\r\n    like that every night. I then drank some very decent wine, and\r\n    sat for a long time smoking with Lynar on the balcony, the\r\n    Rhine below us. My small Testament and the starry night led to\r\n    some conversation on Christianity; and I shook earnestly at the\r\n    Rousseau-like virtue of his soul, only reducing him to silence.\r\n    As a child he has been ill-treated by nurses and tutors,\r\n    without really knowing his parents, and has emerged from his\r\n    youth with similar ideas, founded on a similar education, to\r\n    my own, but bears them with more content than ever has been my\r\n    case. Next day we went in the steamer to Coblenz, breakfasted\r\n    there for an hour, and returned in the same way to Frankfurt,\r\n    where we arrived in the evening. I undertook the journey\r\n    with the object of visiting old Metternich, at Johannisberg,\r\n    at his invitation; but the Rhine delighted me so much, that\r\n    I preferred a trip to Coblenz, and postponed the visit. We\r\n    saw the river, on our immediate journey to the Alps, in the\r\n    finest weather; on this fresh summer morning, and after the\r\n    dusty weariness in Frankfurt, it rises much in my esteem. I\r\n    look forward with real delight to spending a couple of days\r\n    with you, at Rüdesheim; the place is so calm and rural, the\r\n    people pleasant, and nothing dear. We would then take a small\r\n    rowing-boat, and go quietly down, climb the Niederwald, and\r\n    this and the other castle, and return by the steamer. One can\r\n    leave here in the morning early, stay eight hours at Rüdesheim,\r\n    Bingen, Rheinstein, and so forth, and return hither by the\r\n    evening. My appointment here seems now to be certain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Frankfurt, 13th August, 1851.\r\n\r\n    I worked very hard to-day and yesterday about the King’s\r\n    journey, and a multitude of petty details concerning the minor\r\n    Courts, and I am now in hourly expectation of a tiresome\r\n    ambassadorial visit; so that this letter must be very short,\r\n    and yet serve as a love-token. Who has started this nonsense\r\n    about St. Petersburg? I heard the very first of it from your\r\n    letters. Will you not go to Nicolai? I should not think one\r\n    winter there at all disagreeable; but I am tired of these\r\n    separations, and the climate might not suit you and the babies.\r\n    I yesterday took a long and solitary walk into the mountains,\r\n    deep into the wonderful night. I had been at work from eight\r\n    o’clock till five, then dined, and luxuriated in the fresh\r\n    evening mountain air of the Taunus, after leaving this dusty\r\n    hole, by half an hour’s railway to Soden, some two miles behind\r\n    me. The King passes through here on the 19th, and returns, by\r\n    way of Ischl and Prague, to Berlin about the 7th of September.\r\n    I shall meet him at Coblenz, as I have much to say to ——. If he\r\n    brings my appointment, as I expect, I shall immediately hire\r\n    quarters, and then we can talk of your coming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Frankfurt, 23d August, 1851.\r\n\r\n    In the midst of my business post time has arrived, and I will\r\n    rather write you a hasty note than not at all. Since Monday\r\n    I have been still going on. First, there was a great State\r\n    dinner here to the Emperor of Austria—twenty-thousand thalers’\r\n    worth of uniforms at table; then I went to Mainz to receive\r\n    the King; he was very gracious to me, for the first time after\r\n    a long interval harmless and merry. Next came a grand supper,\r\n    then work with Manteuffel till two; then a cigar with dear\r\n    old Stolberg; at half-past six parade, and a great theatrical\r\n    representation. I went on as far as Darmstadt; there we dined.\r\n    The King then went to Baden, and after three weary hours I\r\n    reached this place in the evening with ——. On Wednesday I\r\n    was summoned from my bed to the Duke of Nassau at Bieberich,\r\n    and there dined. Late in the evening I returned, to be waked\r\n    very early next morning by the President G. and I., who took\r\n    possession of me and led me off to Heidelberg, where I remained\r\n    the night, and enjoyed some delightful hours with them at\r\n    Castle Wolfsbrunn and Neckarsteinach and last night returned\r\n    from this excess. G. was pleasanter than ever, did not dispute,\r\n    grew enthusiastic, poetical, and generous. At the Castle we\r\n    saw a sunset the day before yesterday like that one at Rigi.\r\n    We breakfasted up there, walked to Wolfsbrunn, where I drank\r\n    some beer at the same table I did with you; then boated up the\r\n    Neckar to Steinach, and parted in the evening at Heidelberg. G.\r\n    goes to-day to Coblenz, I. to Italy.\r\n\r\nBismarck was so often summoned to Berlin during his residence at\r\nFrankfurt, that it would be wearisome to relate all these journeys\r\nhere. In one year, we do not exactly remember which, he travelled\r\nbetween Berlin and Frankfurt no less than 2600 miles. His counsel was\r\noften required by the highest authority, and very often Bismarck was\r\nvery nearly becoming a Minister, even then; nor was it the powerful\r\ninfluence of both sides which conclusively prevented his entry into the\r\nMinistry, but his own aversion to become a Minister so soon. He declared\r\nto an acquaintance in those days that he would prefer to be first an\r\nambassador for ten years, and then a Minister for ten years more, that\r\nhe might close his days as a country nobleman thereafter in peace. King\r\nFrederick William IV., who regarded it as necessary for Bismarck’s\r\npolitical education that he should go to Vienna, intrusted him in the\r\nMay of 1852 with an important mission thither; but above this was his\r\ndesire to restore a complete understanding between Austria and Prussia.\r\nWe already know that in this Bismarck was likely to become wrecked upon\r\nthe Schwarzenberg policy. In a personal sense, however, on following the\r\nImperial Court into Hungary, Bismarck received very pleasing impressions,\r\nas to which he speaks in the following letters to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                          Halle, 7th January, 1852.\r\n\r\n    I have never, as well as I can recollect, ever written to you\r\n    from hence, and I hope that it will not happen again. I have\r\n    really been thinking whether, after all, yesterday was not\r\n    Friday, on which I set out; it was certainly a _dies nefastus_\r\n    (N. N. will tell you what this means). In Giessen I got a room\r\n    as cold as ice, with three windows that wouldn’t shut; a bed\r\n    too short and too narrow; it was dirty, with bugs; infamous\r\n    coffee—never knew it so bad. At Guntershausen ladies came into\r\n    the first class; there was an end of smoking. A high lady of\r\n    commerce (N. N. will tell you what that is), with two lady’s\r\n    maids; sable furs; they spoke alternately with a Russian and\r\n    English accent in German, French very well, a little English,\r\n    but in my opinion they came from the Reezen Alley in Berlin,\r\n    and one of the lady’s maids was her mother, or elder lady of\r\n    commerce (N. N., etc.). Between Guntershausen and Gerstungen a\r\n    tube in the engine burst, so gently! The water all ran away;\r\n    so there we sat for an hour and a half in the open—very pretty\r\n    neighborhood, and a warm sunlight. I got into the second class\r\n    to smoke, and fell into the hands of a Berlinese Chamber and\r\n    Privy Council colleague, who had been drinking Homburg waters\r\n    for a fortnight, and asked me a lot of questions before a\r\n    number of Jews coming from the fair, until, in despair, I\r\n    took refuge with the Princess from the Reezen Alley. By this\r\n    stoppage we reached Halle three hours too late; the Berlin\r\n    train was gone a long time. Here I must sleep, and travel with\r\n    the luggage-train at half-past one to arrive at two. In the\r\n    station-yard there are two hotels; by accident I’m in the wrong\r\n    one; a gend’arme walked up and down the saloon, and seemed very\r\n    thoughtful about my beard, while I ate a tough beefsteak. I am\r\n    very unhappy, but will finish my bit of goose, drink some port\r\n    wine, and then to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                             Berlin, 1st May, 1852.\r\n\r\n    I have just returned from an infinitely tedious dinner at Le\r\n    Coq’s, where I sat between L. G. and the younger M.—two persons\r\n    widely different in nature. I tried in vain to settle some\r\n    dispute about what is now agitating the King and the Chamber.\r\n    The one was dry, wise, and practical; the other delightful,\r\n    enthusiastic, and theoretical; he might really have forgotten\r\n    the world and its government, in his own views about them,\r\n    but the air of the Chambers has stimulated this impractical\r\n    direction in him, and in this gymnastic exercise of soul and\r\n    tongue he forgets, or holds cheap, what is necessary to be\r\n    done. There is really something quite demoralizing in the\r\n    atmosphere of the Chambers—the best people grow vain without\r\n    perceiving it, and get accustomed to the tribune as to a\r\n    toilet-table, by means of which they exhibit themselves to the\r\n    public. Forgive this political avalanche.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                              Berlin, 3d May, 1852.\r\n\r\n    I am really tired of being here, and long for the day\r\n    of departure. Chamber intrigues I find terribly shallow\r\n    and undignified; if one lives always amongst them, one\r\n    deceives one’s self, and they seem wonders. When I come\r\n    straightforwardly from Frankfurt I feel like a sober man who\r\n    has suddenly fallen amongst tipplers, I wish they would send me\r\n    to Constantinople; it would not be necessary to be returning\r\n    here every minute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           Vienna, 11th June, 1852.\r\n\r\n    “’S g’fällt mer hier gar net” (I don’t like this place at all)\r\n    as Schrenck says, although it was so pleasant with you, anno\r\n    ’47; but I not only miss you, but I find myself not wanted,\r\n    and that is worse than I can make plain to your unpolitical\r\n    mind. If I were here, as I was there, for amusement, I could\r\n    not grumble: all those whom I have become acquainted with\r\n    are remarkably charming people, and the town is rather hot\r\n    with narrow streets, but still a splendid town. In business,\r\n    however, there prevails great _nonchalance_; either the people\r\n    don’t want to arrange with us, or they think we look upon\r\n    it as more important than appears to them. I fear that the\r\n    opportunity of coming to an understanding is gone, which will\r\n    prove a bad result for us; for it was thought that a very great\r\n    step towards reconciliation was taken in sending me, and they\r\n    will not soon send another here so desirous of coming to an\r\n    understanding, and who at the time can deal so freely. Forgive\r\n    me for writing polities to you, but when the heart is full,\r\n    etc. I am really drying up in this mishmash, and I am afraid I\r\n    shall begin to take an interest in it. I have just come from\r\n    the opera with old Westmoreland; Don Giovanni, played by a good\r\n    Italian Opera troop, in hearing which I felt the wretchedness\r\n    of the Frankfurt theatre doubly. Yesterday I went to\r\n    Schönbrunn, and thought of our romantic moonlight expedition,\r\n    as I looked at the tall hedges and the white statues in the\r\n    green thickets, peeped also at the private garden which we\r\n    first got into—quite forbidden ground—so, that the Jäger\r\n    sentinel, who was at his post, would not allow its even being\r\n    looked into.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                               Ofen, 23d June, ’52.\r\n\r\n    I have just come from the steamboat, and do not know how to\r\n    employ the interval until Hildebrand follows with my luggage,\r\n    better than in giving you some account of this very eastward\r\n    but very beautiful world. The Emperor graciously assigned me\r\n    quarters in his palace, and I am seated at an open window in\r\n    a spacious vaulted hall, listening to the evening bells of\r\n    Pesth. The view is charming. The castle stands high; beneath\r\n    me flows the Danube, spanned by the suspension bridge; beyond\r\n    is Pesth, and in the far distance is an endless plain melting\r\n    away into the purple twilight. Next to Pesth, on the left, I\r\n    see the upper course of the Danube; far, very far off from\r\n    me, viz., on the right bank, the river is fringed by the town\r\n    of Ofen; behind this are mountains, blue and bluer, and then\r\n    tinged with brownish-red in the evening, heaven glowing behind\r\n    them. In the midst of the two cities the broad sheet of water\r\n    lies, like Linz, broken only by the suspension bridge and a\r\n    woody island. The passage hither, at least from Gran to Pesth,\r\n    would have delighted you. Think of the Odenwald and the Taunus\r\n    brought close together, and the interval filled with the waters\r\n    of the Danube. The shady side of the voyage was the sunny side,\r\n    for the sun burnt us as if Tokay were to grow on the ship, and\r\n    the number of travellers was very great; but only fancy, not a\r\n    single Englishman amongst them—they can hardly have discovered\r\n    Hungary as yet. Otherwise these were queer folks—from every\r\n    oriental and occidental nation—greasy and washed. My chief\r\n    travelling companion was a very delightful General, with whom\r\n    I sat for the most part on the paddle-box and smoked. I am\r\n    getting somewhat impatient as to where Hildebrand can be; I am\r\n    lying in the window, half enthusiastic at the moonlight, half\r\n    waiting for him, as for one’s beloved—for I feel a marvellous\r\n    disposition for a clean shirt. If you could be here for a\r\n    moment, and could see the silvery stream of the Danube, the\r\n    dark mountains on a pale red ground, and the lights twinkling\r\n    up from Pesth, Vienna would sink in your estimation as compared\r\n    with Buda-Pesth, as the Hungarian calls it; you see I am also\r\n    an enthusiast for nature. I will now calm my excited blood\r\n    with a cup of tea, as Hildebrand has really arrived, and then\r\n    soon go to bed.\r\n\r\n    Last night I only had four hours’ sleep, and the Court is very\r\n    early here. The young Duke rises at five; I should then be a\r\n    very bad courtier if I thought of sleeping longer. Therefore,\r\n    with a glance at a gigantic tea-urn, and a seductive dish\r\n    containing ices, amongst other things, as I see, I waft you a\r\n    good-night from afar. What can that song be which has haunted\r\n    me all day long?\r\n\r\n      “Over the blue mountain, over the white sea foam,\r\n      Come, thou beloved one, come to thy lonely home!”\r\n\r\n    I can not tell who it was who sang this to me in “Old lang\r\n    syne.”\r\n\r\n    _The 24th June._—After a good night’s rest although upon a\r\n    flinty bed, I wish you a good morning. The entire landscape\r\n    before me swims in bright burning sunshine, so that I can\r\n    not look out without being dazzled. Until it is time to\r\n    begin my visits, I am sitting here alone at breakfast and\r\n    smoking in a very spacious apartment, four rooms—all vaulted\r\n    massively—two about the size of our dining-room, thick walls\r\n    like Schönhausen, giant walnut-wood cabinets, furniture of blue\r\n    silk, on the floor a number of yard-wide black stains, that\r\n    a more excited imagination than mine would take for blood,\r\n    but which I, _décidément_, declare to be ink. An incredibly\r\n    unskillful writer must have lived here, or another Luther\r\n    must several times have thrown very large inkstands at the\r\n    Adversary. A very obliging old servant in a bright yellow\r\n    livery shares the duties of the household with Hildebrand;\r\n    indeed they are all very obliging. In honor of the King’s\r\n    representative, the steamer yesterday hoisted the great\r\n    Prussian standard, and, thanks to the telegraph, a royal\r\n    carriage was in waiting at the landing-place. Don’t tell N. N.,\r\n    or he will write articles about it. Below, on long rafts, are\r\n    floating the queerest brown broad-hatted and broad-breeched\r\n    figures along the Danube. I am sorry that I am not an artist;\r\n    I should like to have introduced you to these wild faces, with\r\n    heavy mustaches and long hair, flashing black eyes, and their\r\n    picturesque draperies, as I beheld them yesterday. I must now\r\n    make an end and begin my visits. I do not know when you will\r\n    receive these lines; perhaps I shall send a courier to-morrow\r\n    or next day to Berlin, who can take them with him.\r\n\r\n    _Evening._—I have not had any opportunity as yet of forwarding\r\n    this. The lights again are twinkling up from Pesth; towards\r\n    the horizon, near the Theiss, there is lightning; above us\r\n    the heavens are full of stars. I have been in uniform the\r\n    greater part of the day, in private audience; I handed my\r\n    credentials to the youthful ruler of this land, and have been\r\n    agreeably impressed. After dinner the whole Court made an\r\n    excursion into the mountains, to the “pretty shepherdess;” who\r\n    is long since dead; some centuries ago King Matthew Corvinus\r\n    loved her. Thence there is a prospect of Ofen, its mountains\r\n    and plains, over woody Neckar-like rocks. A national feast\r\n    had brought thousands forth, thronging around the Emperor,\r\n    who mingled freely with them; with resounding _eljen evviva_\r\n    they danced Csardas, waltzed, sang, played music, climbed the\r\n    trees, and crowded round the Court. Upon a grass slope there\r\n    was a supper-table laid out for some twenty people—only on\r\n    one side, the other being left free for a view of the forest,\r\n    castle, city, and country; above us were tall beeches with\r\n    climbing Hungarians on the branches; behind us dense crowds\r\n    of people thronged together and pushing each other about; in\r\n    the distance wind instruments mingled with song, wild gypsy\r\n    music. Illuminations, moonshine, and the rosy twilight, torches\r\n    flitting through the forest—the whole might have figured\r\n    unchanged as a great scene of effect in a romantic opera. Next\r\n    to me sat the venerable Archbishop of Gran, the Primate of\r\n    Hungary, in a black silk talar with a red cape; on the other\r\n    a very charming and elegant cavalry general. You see that\r\n    the picture was a variegated one, rich in contrasts. Then we\r\n    drove home in the moonshine by torchlight. Tell Frau von V.\r\n    that her brother was a most delightful man, as I could not\r\n    but expect from her two sisters whom I already knew. I had\r\n    just received a telegraphic dispatch from Berlin; it contained\r\n    only four letters—_Nein_ (No!). A word full of significance.\r\n    I was told to-day of the storm of the castle three years ago\r\n    by the insurgents; at this the brave General Hentzi and the\r\n    whole garrison, after a wonderfully courageous resistance,\r\n    were cut down. The black stains upon my floor are partly the\r\n    result of fire, and where I am writing bursting grenades were\r\n    then dancing, and the fight went on over smoking ruins. It\r\n    has only been restored a few weeks ago, before the arrival\r\n    of the Emperor. It is very quiet and peaceful up here now.\r\n    I hear nothing but the ticking of a clock, and the sound of\r\n    distant carriage-wheels below. May angels watch over thee—a\r\n    bearskin-capped grenadier does so with me—I can see six inches\r\n    of his bayonet at a couple of arms’ length from me above the\r\n    window-sill, and the reflection of a foot. He stands on the\r\n    terrace by the Danube, and is probably thinking of his Nanny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK’S ONLY SISTER.\r\n\r\n(Frau von Arnim.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Szolnok, 27th June, 1852.\r\n\r\n    In your atlases you will find a map of Hungary, and on this\r\n    a river Theiss, and, if you follow up the source towards\r\n    Szegedin, a place named Szolnok. Yesterday I went by railway\r\n    from Pesth to Alberti-Josa, where a Prince W. lies in garrison.\r\n    He is married to a Princess M. I paid him a visit in order\r\n    to inform —— of the state of his health. This place lies on\r\n    the edge of the Hungarian steppes between the Danube and the\r\n    Theiss, which I desired to see by way of a joke. I was not\r\n    allowed to ride without an escort, as the district is overrun\r\n    by cavalry robber bands, here called Betyars, and is therefore\r\n    unsafe. After a comfortable breakfast under the shade of a\r\n    Schönhausen lime, I got upon a low wagon with sacks of straw\r\n    and three horses; the Uhlans loaded their carbines, mounted,\r\n    and away they went at full gallop. Hildebrand and a Hungarian\r\n    servant occupied the front seat, and our coachman was a dark\r\n    brown peasant, with a mustache, a broad-brimmed hat, long\r\n    hair shining with fat, a shirt only reaching to the stomach,\r\n    leaving a broad band of dark brown skin visible, to where the\r\n    white trowsers begin, each leg of which would make a woman’s\r\n    gown, and reach to the knee, where boots and spurs complete the\r\n    costume. Only think of firm grass plat, as level as a table, on\r\n    which nothing can be seen for miles towards the horizon, except\r\n    the tall naked beams of the wells dug for the half-wild horses\r\n    and oxen; thousands of whity-brown oxen, with long horns, as\r\n    timorous as deer; rough, disreputable-looking horses, watched\r\n    by half-naked shepherds on horseback, with lances; endless\r\n    herds of swine, among which you see a donkey carrying the\r\n    fur-cloak (_bunda_) of the herdsman, and sometimes himself;\r\n    huge swarms of bustards, hares, rabbits, and other small deer;\r\n    near a salt-water pool, wild geese, ducks, and lapwings; such\r\n    were the objects we flew by, and which flew by us during our\r\n    three hours’ journey of seven miles to Ketskemet, with a slight\r\n    halt at a csarda (inn). Ketskemet is a village, the streets\r\n    of which, if the inhabitants are left out, reminds one of the\r\n    small end of Schönhausen. It has, however, forty-five thousand\r\n    inhabitants, unpaved streets, low houses, closed on the eastern\r\n    side against the sun, with huge cattle-yards. A foreign\r\n    ambassador was such an unusual sight there—and my Magyar\r\n    servant rattled out the “excellency” to such a degree—that I\r\n    immediately obtained a guard of honor, the village authorities\r\n    announced themselves, and a change of horses was required.\r\n    I spent the evening with a delightful set of officers, who\r\n    insisted upon my taking an additional escort, and entertained\r\n    me with a number of robber stories. In the very neighborhood\r\n    into which I was going the worst robber-nests exist; on the\r\n    Theiss, the morasses and wilds render their destruction almost\r\n    impossible. They are splendidly horsed and armed, these\r\n    Betyars; they attack travellers and farms in bands of fifteen\r\n    or twenty strong, and next day are twenty miles away. They are\r\n    polite to respectable people. I had left the greater part of\r\n    my ready money with Prince W., and only had some linen with\r\n    me, and really felt a desire to make the nearer acquaintance\r\n    of these mounted brigands, in their great fur dresses, with\r\n    double-barrelled guns and pistols in their girdles. Their\r\n    captains wear black masks, and sometimes belong to the small\r\n    country gentry. Some days ago the gens-d’armes had a skirmish\r\n    with them, and some were killed; two robbers, however, were\r\n    caught, and shot, with all the honors, in Ketskemet. We don’t\r\n    hear of such things in our tiresome districts. About the time\r\n    you woke this morning, you little thought that I was flying\r\n    over the steppes of Cumania, in the neighborhood of Felegyhaza\r\n    and Csonygrad, with Hildebrand at full gallop, a delightful\r\n    sunburnt Uhlan officer by my side, loaded pistols lying in the\r\n    hay before us, and a squadron of Uhlans with ready carbines in\r\n    their hands wildly dashing after us. Three swift horses drew\r\n    us, called Rosa, Csillak (star), and Betyar (vagabond). The\r\n    driver unintermittingly called them by name, in a piteous tone,\r\n    until he got his whip handle well over their heads, and with\r\n    a cry of “_mega! mega!_” (hold on!) the gallop changed into a\r\n    wild career. A delightful sensation! We saw no robbers; as my\r\n    light-brown lieutenant told me, they knew before daylight that\r\n    I was travelling under protection; certainly some of them were\r\n    among those worthy-looking and dignified peasants who gazed\r\n    seriously at us at the stations, in their sleeveless sheepskin\r\n    cloaks reaching to the ground, and greeted us with an honorable\r\n    “_istem adiamek_” (praised be God!) The sun’s heat was\r\n    scorching all day—I am as red as a crab in the face. We made\r\n    eighteen miles in twelve hours, to which must be reckoned two\r\n    or three hours, if not more, in putting-to and waiting, as the\r\n    twelve horses I required had first to be caught for myself and\r\n    escort. A third of the distance was shifting sands and downs,\r\n    like those of Stolpmünde.\r\n\r\n    At five I reached this place, the streets of which are animated\r\n    by a gay crowd of Hungarians, Slowaks, and Wallachians,\r\n    who fill my chamber with a din of the wildest and maddest\r\n    gypsy melodies. (Szolnok is a village of some six thousand\r\n    inhabitants, but there is a railway and steamboat station on\r\n    the Theiss.) At times they sing through the nose, with gaping\r\n    mouths, in a weak minor discord, histories of black eyes, and\r\n    of the brave death of some robber, in sounds that remind one\r\n    of the wind howling Lettish songs down a chimney. The women\r\n    are generally well grown, a few remarkably handsome; they all\r\n    have raven hair, bound in tresses behind with red ribbons. The\r\n    married women wear either bright green and red cloths, or red\r\n    velvet caps on their heads; about their shoulders and bosoms\r\n    a handsome yellow silk shawl; black or pure blue short gowns,\r\n    and red Turkey leather shoes, reaching up under the petticoats.\r\n    Their faces have a yellowish brown hue, with lustrous black\r\n    eyes; a group of these women present a play of colors that\r\n    would please you; every color is as distinctly expressed as\r\n    possible. Since my arrival at five I have been swimming in the\r\n    Theiss, while expecting dinner. I have seen Csardas danced; it\r\n    vexes me that I can not draw, to bring these fairy-tale forms\r\n    on paper for you. I then had _paprika_, _stürl_ (fish), and\r\n    _tick_ for dinner, drank a good deal of Hungarian, and now\r\n    shall go to bed, if the gypsy music will let me sleep. Good\r\n    night. _Istem adiamek._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                   Pesth, the 28th.\r\n\r\n    Again I see the mountains of Ofen, this time from the Pesth\r\n    side, from below. From the plains I have just left, the dim\r\n    outlines of blue Carpathian ridges, distant some twelve or\r\n    fifteen miles, are in some places, when the air is very clear,\r\n    barely distinguishable. To the south and east the plain was\r\n    fathomless; in the first direction it stretches far away into\r\n    Turkey, in the second towards Siebenbürgen. The heat to-day\r\n    was again scorching, and has peeled all the skin from my face.\r\n    A heat-storm is now raging, driving so fiercely over the\r\n    steppes that the houses tremble. I swam in the Danube, saw the\r\n    magnificent suspension bridge from beneath, paid visits, heard\r\n    very good gypsy music on the parade, and shall soon go to bed.\r\n    The parts on the edge of the Pusta, where it is beginning to\r\n    be cultivated, remind me of Pomerania, in the neighborhoods of\r\n    Rommelow, Romahn, and Coseger. The gypsies have grayish-black\r\n    complexions. Their costume is fabulous; the children quite\r\n    naked, except a string of glass pearls about their necks.\r\n    Two women had handsome, regular features, and were cleaner\r\n    and more ornamented than the men. When the Hungarians want\r\n    a dance over again, they shout in a surprised tone, “_Hody\r\n    wol? Hody?_” (“What was it? What?”), and look at each other\r\n    interrogatively, as if they had not understood, although they\r\n    know the music by heart. It is, indeed, a singular people, but\r\n    pleases me very well. It was just as well I had the escort of\r\n    Uhlans. At about the same time I left Ketskemet for the south,\r\n    sixty-three wagons went off in a northerly direction towards\r\n    Körös. Two hours later they were stopped and plundered. A\r\n    colonel, who was by accident driving before this wagon-train,\r\n    had some shots sent after him, as he would not halt. One\r\n    horse was shot through the neck, but not enough to bring it\r\n    down, and as he returned the fire, with his two servants,\r\n    flying at full gallop, they preferred to be satisfied with\r\n    the other travellers. They did no other harm to any one, and\r\n    only plundered some individuals, or rather ransomed them, for\r\n    they do not take all a person has, but only in proportion to\r\n    property, and according to their own needs; for instance, they\r\n    will quietly receive forty florins out of a thousand, without\r\n    touching the remainder. Thieves with whom one can talk!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                  Vienna, the 30th.\r\n\r\n    Here I am again at the “Roman Emperor.” While you were looking\r\n    from the Castle of Coblenz on the Rhine in attendance on our\r\n    King and Lord, I was looking from the Castle of Ofen upon the\r\n    Danube, and had an after-dinner conversation with the young\r\n    Emperor upon the Prussian military system; and, oddly enough,\r\n    on the same afternoon on which you visited Ehrenbreitstein\r\n    and Stolzenfels, I took a drive through the Citadel above the\r\n    palace, and into the forest district of Ofen. The view from\r\n    the first is admirable. It reminds one of Prague, only there\r\n    is more background and distance, therefore rather resembles\r\n    Ehrenbreitstein, and the Danube is grander than the Moldau. I\r\n    reached here last night, per the Pesth train, about half-past\r\n    six.\r\n\r\nBismarck, as usual, was invited to the royal hunting-party in the autumn,\r\nas we perceive by the following letter to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                       Blankenburg, 1st Nov., 1852.\r\n\r\n    A very unusual early rising, caused by the circumstance that my\r\n    room is a passage for some Court servants still asleep, gives\r\n    me time for these lines. Our Queen is also here, and is just\r\n    being awakened by soft music of horns. I have not had such\r\n    good sport in Letzlingen this time as three years ago; it was\r\n    on Friday. Only three stags, _voilà tout_; one of them I hope\r\n    will reach you. Eat the wild boar devoutly, and pickle some of\r\n    it. His Majesty shot it with his own gracious hand. Otherwise,\r\n    things went off very well; and, as I found N. N. there, I need\r\n    not go to Berlin, and hope to reach you by the evening after\r\n    to-morrow, of which please inform ——, as well as that his\r\n    appointment for Berlin at our Court may be regarded as certain.\r\n\r\n                                                                 B.\r\n\r\n    The band is still playing very well from the Freischütz,—“_Ob\r\n    auch die Wolke sie verhülle_” (If the cloud still doth surround\r\n    her); very apt in this doubtful weather.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he received many visits from the Duke of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, for whom he was engaged\r\nat the time, at the instance of the King’s Government, in obtaining a\r\npecuniary settlement of the Duke’s claims with Denmark. Bismarck was\r\nable, with great difficulty, to extract from very unwilling Denmark\r\na handsome compensation. At this the Duke was so rejoiced, that he\r\ndevoted himself and followers, with the entire gratitude of the House of\r\nAugustenburg, to the policy of Bismarck, as is well known.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1853 Bismarck first visited Ostend and Holland, then\r\nWestphalia and Nordeney. He then had a mission to Hanover, of which he\r\nrendered an account at Potsdam. In the autumn he spent a considerable\r\ntime with his family in Switzerland, at Villeneuve, on the Lake of\r\nGeneva, and thence visited Upper Italy, especially Aosta and Genoa. In\r\nOctober he was summoned to Potsdam by His Majesty the King; was present\r\nat the hunting-parties of Letzlingen, and then returned for the winter to\r\nFrankfurt; some time, however, he spent in Berlin.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer trip, which Bismarck made alone, he wrote the following\r\nletters to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                         Ostend, 19th August, 1853.\r\n\r\n    Up to the present time, besides the one of to day, I have taken\r\n    three baths, with which I have been well pleased; there is a\r\n    strong sea and soft bottom. Most people bathe close under the\r\n    pier forming the parade, ladies and gentlemen all together; the\r\n    first in very unbecoming long gowns of dark woollen, the last\r\n    in a tricot, being jacket and trowsers in one piece, so that\r\n    the arms above and the legs beneath are almost free. Only the\r\n    consciousness of possessing a perfectly well-proportioned form\r\n    can allow one of us to produce himself in ladies’ society thus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Brussels, 21st August, 1853.\r\n\r\n    I have left Ostend with sorrow, and really wish myself back\r\n    again: I found an old sweetheart of mine there, and as\r\n    unchanged and charming as on our first acquaintance. I really\r\n    feel the sorrow of separation deeply at this moment, and look\r\n    forward impatiently to the instant when I shall cast myself\r\n    on her heaving bosom at Nordeney. I can hardly understand why\r\n    people can not always live by the sea, and why I have been\r\n    cajoled into passing two days in this parallelogrammatic stone\r\n    heap, to see bull-fights, Waterloo, and pompous processions. If\r\n    I had not to keep that most unlucky appointment with N. N., I\r\n    should stay several weeks longer in Ostend, and give N. N. up.\r\n    I shall only remain till noon to-morrow, and then start, or\r\n    early the next morning, for Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam;\r\n    thence by steamer to Harlingen, and through Friesland to\r\n    Nordeney. I am afraid N. N. will soon disturb me there, and if\r\n    I once get to Bremen with him, I hardly know whether I ever\r\n    shall accomplish the tiresome journey to N. again, but shall\r\n    make my way by Hanover, Hamm, Kassel, and Frankfurt to the\r\n    place you inhabit. If you write to me, direct to Nordeney.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Amsterdam, 24th August, 1853.\r\n\r\n    In Brussels and Antwerp I have never had a quiet minute on\r\n    account of feasts and sight-seeing. I have passed a detestable\r\n    night on a camp-stool, in a crowded boat from Antwerp, starting\r\n    at one in the morning. By an angular labyrinth of arms of the\r\n    Scheldt and Maas, and the Rhine, I reached Rotterdam early,\r\n    about eleven, and about four arrived here. That is a singular\r\n    town: many streets are like Venice, some with water right up\r\n    to the walls, others like canals with a towing path, and with\r\n    narrow walks planted with limes before the houses. The latter\r\n    have fantastic gables, strange and smoky, almost ghostly—the\r\n    chimneys like men standing on their heads and stretching\r\n    out their legs. That which does not savor of Venice is the\r\n    busy life, and the massive handsome shops—one window close\r\n    to the other, and more magnificently than I remember those\r\n    of Paris or London. When I listen to the bells, and, with a\r\n    long clay pipe in my mouth, look through the forest of masts,\r\n    across the canals into the twilight towards the romantically\r\n    confused gables and chimneys, all the Dutch ghost stories of\r\n    my childhood come back to me, of Dolph Heylinger, and Rip van\r\n    Winkle, and the Flying Dutchman. To-morrow morning I go by\r\n    steamer to Harlingen on the Zuyder Zee, and to-morrow evening I\r\n    hope to be in Nordeney, the farthest point from you I propose\r\n    to touch; and then the time will not be far off when I hope\r\n    to encounter you unexpectedly on a glacier. I have nothing\r\n    from Berlin since I left Ostend, and therefore conclude that\r\n    the storms are all laid, and the waters returned into the old\r\n    bed—the pleasantest event that could happen for us. I am very\r\n    glad I have seen Holland; from Rotterdam to this place there is\r\n    one continual verdant and level meadow, upon which there are\r\n    many bushes, much grazing cattle, and some old cities cut out\r\n    of picture-books; no arable land anywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Norderney, 27th Aug., 1853.\r\n\r\n    Last evening I arrived here on a stout Dutch sloop, amidst\r\n    thunder, lightning, and rain—have, after an abstinence of\r\n    a week, taken another glorious sea-bath, and sitting in a\r\n    fishing hut with a feeling of great loneliness and longing for\r\n    you—partly heightened by the clamor of mine host’s children,\r\n    partly by the piping scream of the storm against the roof and\r\n    flagstaff. It is really tiresome here, and that suits me, as I\r\n    have a long piece of work to finish. I wrote to you last from\r\n    Amsterdam, previously from Brussels. Since then I have seen\r\n    a charming little country—West Friesland; quite flat, but so\r\n    bushy green, hedgy, every farm-house surrounded by its little\r\n    wood, that one seems to envy the peaceful independence reigning\r\n    there. —— will probably ascribe this satisfaction to the\r\n    circumstance that, as at Linz and Gmunden, all the girls are\r\n    pictures of beauty, only taller and more slender, fair, colors\r\n    like milk and roses, and a very becoming helmet-like golden\r\n    head-dress.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1854 we find Bismarck at Potsdam, in the summer at\r\nMunich and Stuttgart. On the 28th of June he wrote to his sister from\r\nFrankfurt, thus:\r\n\r\n    I should have liked under all circumstances to have brought\r\n    you my good wishes in person, particularly as I know my roving\r\n    wife is with you. But unfortunately we seem too important to\r\n    ourselves here, to deprive confused Europe of the light of our\r\n    wisdom. Whoever speaks of holidays now is regarded as a traitor\r\n    to the world-important problem of the Germanic Confederation. I\r\n    long deeply for the country, the forest and laziness, with the\r\n    _obligato_ addition of affectionate wives and well-conducted\r\n    clean children. If I hear one of these hopefuls crying in\r\n    the street, my heart is filled with parental feelings and\r\n    educational maxims. How do our descendants agree, and are mine\r\n    good? I have been obliged to write these few lines at three\r\n    intervals, because N. N. and N. N. East and West disturbed me\r\n    during the time, and Z. is just announced: he won’t go for\r\n    an hour, so I say farewell. I want to go fishing with the\r\n    Englishman to-day, but it rains too much, so instead I am a\r\n    victim of visitors. Farewell, and live long. Your faithful\r\n    brother.\r\n\r\nBismarck then accompanied the King, who grew continually more attached to\r\nhim, to the island of Rügen; by Pomerania, Berlin, and Baden he returned\r\nto Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1855 he visited the Exhibition at Paris, residing\r\nwith the Prussian Ambassador, Count Hatzfeld, and was introduced to\r\nthe Emperor of the French. Afterwards he went to Stuttgart and Munich,\r\nand then visited the King and Queen at Stolzenfels. The year 1856 was\r\ncomparatively quiet, and he passed his summer at Stolpmünde.\r\n\r\n                          Reinfeld, in Pomerania, 11th Sept., 1856.\r\n\r\n    The Diet will, I think, in November, devote its sessions to\r\n    the Holstein question with greater good-will than results.\r\n    Outwardly all the governments will appear united in this\r\n    matter. Austria will, however, secretly remain an adherent of\r\n    the Danes; its press will teem with German phrases, and Prussia\r\n    will be saddled with the error of inaction. The centre of\r\n    gravity of the affair actually does not lie at Frankfurt, but\r\n    in the question whether Denmark is secure from the assaults\r\n    of one or more of the extra German States. If she be, then\r\n    she will look upon the decision of the Diet as a sufficient\r\n    settlement.\r\n\r\nFrom Courland Bismarck returned to Berlin and Potsdam, and thence went\r\nto Baden; afterwards he was at Hohendorf in East Prussia, and Reinfeld\r\nin Pomerania. These were certainly years of apprenticeship, but still\r\nmore years of journey. In the following years he was frequently summoned\r\nto the Prince of Prussia in Baden-Baden; he then went to Stolpmünde,\r\nand remained in Berlin throughout October and November. During these\r\nyears the following letters were written to Frau von Arnim, the two\r\nlast containing some notices of the Ministry of the so-called “new\r\nera”—Bismarck speaking in a very intelligible way as to his own position.\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO FRAU VON ARNIM.\r\n\r\n                                      Reinfeld, 15th October, 1856.\r\n\r\n    It looks as if I never was to reach Kröchlendorf. Harry will no\r\n    doubt have told you how I intended to do so. I should already\r\n    have been with you, but last week my poor little Marie was\r\n    seized with some kind of chicken-pox, and so I could not well\r\n    leave Johanna until the symptoms were declared. She is still\r\n    as variegated as a trout, but decidedly better. I wanted to\r\n    set off to-day for Passow direct, but yesterday had a letter\r\n    from ——, by which he lets me know that he wants to see me by\r\n    the 18th at ——. As a diplomatist I can not refuse to meet\r\n    our trustiest companion, and one of the Olympian deities of\r\n    our Frankfurt Pantheon. If I receive no letter from Berlin\r\n    in between, I hope to rest in your sororal arms by the 19th.\r\n    Should I be able to get away from —— on the evening of the\r\n    18th, I shall leave by the early train from Stettin. If I\r\n    can not do this, I still hope to reach Stettin by the twelve\r\n    o’clock train, if the postillions can be got to a trot. But do\r\n    not wait dinner for me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                        Frankfurt, 26th Nov., 1856.\r\n\r\n    Bernhard will have told you by what unexpected chain of\r\n    infantine disease and royal mandates I have been deranged in\r\n    my chronological calculations, and how ——, who has claims\r\n    upon my ideas of the service, also abridged my lecture, so\r\n    that it happened, a few hours before we were about to set out\r\n    for Kröchlendorf, all together, that I had to announce to the\r\n    male as well as the female Bernhard that I could only escort\r\n    them as far as Passow. At that frontier of the Uckermark I\r\n    met ——, and in Angermünde we were joined by ——, so that I was\r\n    gradually prepared, by ministerial conferences and three hours\r\n    of smokelessness, for my Berlin strait-waistcoat. It seemed as\r\n    if I was never to get to Kröchlendorf. I had plenty of time and\r\n    desire to do so, after the terminations of the Berlin marriage\r\n    festivities, and only after a conference with —— did I decide\r\n    first to go to Reinfeld, and on my return, to you, in order to\r\n    stop a week with him there; because he only got his holiday in\r\n    October, and our arrangement was that I should come hither\r\n    with him about the 15th, and return to Berlin about the 22d.\r\n    On the 11th my child was taken ill, at first severely; then\r\n    I had to attend to official parade. Then I was summoned to\r\n    his Majesty at Berlin, where, on the 25th of October, I found\r\n    myself early enough. And now I am here, have only seen the sun\r\n    twice in the last month, and every day I say to myself that it\r\n    is impossible in November to live without wife and children.\r\n    From sheer ennui I give dinner parties. In the evening one\r\n    rout succeeds another, and I shall soon begin to gamble if\r\n    Johanna and the children do not occupy this vacuum. She thought\r\n    of starting from Reinfeld on Saturday the 22d, but on the\r\n    20th wrote me a plaintive letter about cold and snow, which\r\n    I received on the 23d. Since then I have no idea whether she\r\n    is on the other side of the Gollenberg or this side of the\r\n    Randow. I begged her generally to inform you of her confinement\r\n    in Berlin beforehand, and to let you know from Cöslin by\r\n    telegraph when she would actually arrive there. The last time\r\n    I lived in —— very fairly, but it appeared to me this youthful\r\n    undertaking must either not have taken place, or already been\r\n    “over.” If Johanna should by accident be in Berlin, greet her\r\n    from me. Perhaps I shall get there by Saturday. I am summoned\r\n    to the Upper Chamber, but the contents do not assure me whether\r\n    His Majesty wishes me to be there myself personally, or only\r\n    desires to see his most humble servant en bloc. In the latter\r\n    case, I should not consider myself called to leave my important\r\n    business, and the stove in the red study, to sit up to the\r\n    neck in snow at Halle, and next heighten the effect of the\r\n    White Saloon by a flying costume under the rubric of “People,\r\n    nobility, detectives, and priests.” I expect an answer from\r\n    Berlin about this, as to whether I am wanted as an ornament or\r\n    a coadjutor. In the latter case I should reach Berlin early on\r\n    Saturday. I should be very glad on that occasion to see you,\r\n    as some recompense for Kröchlendorf; otherwise, I am glad to\r\n    remain away from Berlin, and receive my own folks here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    TO FRAU VON ARNIM.\r\n\r\n                                          Frankfurt (without date.)\r\n\r\n    While I was forced to hear an almost incredibly long speech by\r\n    a highly esteemed colleague on the anarchical condition of\r\n    things in Upper Lippe, I thought how I could use the time,\r\n    and the most prominent want of my heart seemed to be a desire\r\n    to pour forth fraternal feelings. A very highly respectable\r\n    but slightly amusing company surrounds me, at a green-covered\r\n    circular table, some twenty feet in diameter, in the ground\r\n    floor of the Prince of Tour and Taxis’s palace, with a view of\r\n    the garden. The average appearance of these folks is somewhat\r\n    that of N. N. and Z. in Berlin—they have quite a Federal Diet\r\n    cut!\r\n\r\n    I go out shooting pretty regularly, when a single individual\r\n    shoots some six to fifteen hares and a few pheasants—very\r\n    seldom a roe or a fox—and a head of red deer is sometimes seen\r\n    in the far distance. Time for this I have been able to spare\r\n    from being far more lazy, as my industry in Berlin led to no\r\n    results.\r\n\r\n    N. N. is by no means as charming as he used to be; he listens\r\n    to all kinds of lying stories, and allows himself to be\r\n    persuaded that I am anxious for his heritage, although I am\r\n    glad to be left where I am. I am getting accustomed, in the\r\n    consciousness of yawning innocence, to submit to all symptoms\r\n    of coldness, and permit a spirit of entire indolence to possess\r\n    me, after having, I flatter myself, gradually brought the Diet\r\n    to a knowledge of its piercing nihilism. The well-known song\r\n    of Heine, “_O Bund, du Hund, du bist nicht gesund_” (O Diet,\r\n    you dog, you are not well), will soon be unanimously adopted by\r\n    resolution as the national anthem of the Germans.\r\n\r\n    Nobody troubles themselves about the East here. The Russians\r\n    or the Turks may put what they like in the newspapers; nobody\r\n    believes either in land or sea fights, and doubts the existence\r\n    of Sinope, Kalafat, and Schefketel.\r\n\r\n    Darmstadt has at last stopped reading—and I fall, full of\r\n    emotion, into your arms, and wish you a pleasant feast. Many\r\n    greetings to Oscar. Your faithful brother,\r\n\r\n                                                                 B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                         From Paris, Hotel de Douvres, April, 1857.\r\n\r\n    I have five stoves, and am freezing—five clocks, and never know\r\n    how late it is—eleven great looking-glasses, and my necktie is\r\n    always awry. I shall probably have to remain here until Tuesday\r\n    evening, although I am anxious to be at home. Since November\r\n    I have not emerged from this Bohemianism—since November, and\r\n    I have not had a sensation of regular and lasting domesticity\r\n    since you went last summer with Johanna to Schwalbach. Now\r\n    they want to summon me to Berlin about the salt tax; if I had\r\n    the time, I could not take part in this debate. I can not,\r\n    according to my conviction, vote for the Government; but, if I\r\n    vote for the Opposition, it is hardly proper to ask for leave\r\n    of absence on such an account; and, considering the rumors as\r\n    to my eventual entry into the Ministry, of which Johanna, on\r\n    account of your statements, writes despairingly, one could\r\n    think I had some ideas of joining in the swindle. Hearty\r\n    greetings to Oscar.\r\n\r\n                                                                 B.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1857 we again find Bismarck in Paris, and it was then\r\nthat he had his first special political conference with the Emperor\r\nNapoleon. In the summer he made a journey to the North—went to Denmark\r\nand Sweden, ending by field-sports in Courland; on his return he found\r\nhis family at Stolpmünde.\r\n\r\nWhile on this journey he wrote the following letter to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                      Copenhagen, 6th August, 1857.\r\n\r\n    This morning at seven I safely arrived here, after a very\r\n    pleasant passage; mild air, a red moon, the chalk cliffs\r\n    lighted by tar-barrels; two storms at sea, and a little wind;\r\n    what more can one want? The night prevented my sleeping, and\r\n    when the rain drove me from the deck about two o’clock, it was\r\n    so hot and reeking of humanity below, that about three I went\r\n    on deck with cloak and cigar. I have now taken a sea-bath,\r\n    eaten some lobster, and about half-past one I must attend at\r\n    the Court—so now I will sleep a couple of hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Räsbyholm, 9th August, 1857.\r\n\r\n    You will have already received the few lines I wrote directly\r\n    I reached Copenhagen. Since then I have been occupied for two\r\n    days with museums and politics, yesterday was ferried over to\r\n    Malmö, and driven some eight miles to the north-eastward, and\r\n    am at the above-named place, in a white castle situated very\r\n    high on a peninsula surrounded by a large lake. Through the\r\n    window and the thicket of ivy, that admit of some view of the\r\n    water and hills beyond, I perceive that the sun is shining and\r\n    flies are buzzing. Behind me sits ——; he is reading and dozing;\r\n    broad Swedish is spoken under the window, and from the kitchen\r\n    I can hear a pestle grinding away like a saw. That is all I can\r\n    tell you of the present. Yesterday we stalked roebucks, one was\r\n    killed, but I did not shoot; we got thoroughly drenched; then\r\n    we took hot wine, and slept soundly for nine hours. Roebucks\r\n    are more plentiful than I have ever seen anywhere, and the\r\n    neighborhood is prettier than I thought. Magnificent beech\r\n    forests, and walnut-trees the size of a man’s body, in the\r\n    garden. We have just visited the pheasantry; after dinner we\r\n    are going on the lake, and may perhaps shoot a duck, unless\r\n    we fear to disturb the Sunday rest of this lovely solitude\r\n    by a shot; to-morrow we are to have a regular day, next day\r\n    we return to Copenhagen, and from there to N. N., and a\r\n    stag-hunt on Wednesday; Thursday by Copenhagen to Helsingborg,\r\n    some twenty miles into Sweden. We shall seek woodcocks and\r\n    moorfowl in the wilderness; we shall lodge in farm-houses; our\r\n    provisions we take with us. This will last for about a week,\r\n    and then I hardly know what I shall do; either proceed by\r\n    way of Jönkeping, at the south end of Lake Wetter, and so to\r\n    Stockholm, or by Götheborg and Lake Wener, or to Christiania,\r\n    abandoning Stockholm, or perhaps _viâ_ Memel to Courland. This\r\n    depends on a letter I expect from —— in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Tomsjönas, 16th Aug., 1857.\r\n\r\n    I again employ the quiet of Sunday to give you some sign of\r\n    life, although I do not yet know on what day we shall find an\r\n    opportunity of reaching the post from this wilderness. For\r\n    some fifteen miles have I driven into the depths of the woods\r\n    to reach this place, and before me lie some twenty-five miles\r\n    ere we shall get to cultivated provinces. There is no town, no\r\n    village, far or near—only isolated settlers and plank-huts,\r\n    with a little barley and potatoes, strewn irregularly between\r\n    dead trees, rocks, and thickets, over a few rods of ploughed\r\n    land. Think of the wildest region near Viartlum,[42] for some\r\n    hundred of square miles, tall heather, varied by short grass\r\n    and moorland, beset with birch, juniper, pines, beech, oaks,\r\n    and alders, sometimes impassably thick and sometimes very\r\n    sparse, the whole sown with innumerable stones to the size of\r\n    houses, smelling of wild rosemary and firs; and between them\r\n    strangely formed lakes, surrounded by sand and forest—and you\r\n    will see Smaland; where I now am. Really the land of my dreams,\r\n    not to be reached by dispatches, colleagues, and N. N., but\r\n    unhappily also for you; I should like to have a hunting-box\r\n    on one of these quiet lakes, and people it for a few months\r\n    with all the dear ones I now fancy are assembled at Reinfeld.\r\n    It would be impossible to winter it out here, particularly\r\n    amidst the dirt of the rain. Yesterday we started about five,\r\n    and hunted in the burning heat, up hill and down dale, through\r\n    bog and bush, until eleven; but found nothing at all. It is\r\n    very tiring to walk through moors and impassable thickets\r\n    of juniper, over great stones and underwood. We slept in a\r\n    hay barn till two, drank a great deal of milk, and continued\r\n    the chase till sunset, killing twenty-five woodcocks and two\r\n    snipes. We then dined at the lodge—a wonderful structure of\r\n    wood—on a peninsula by the lake. My room, with its three\r\n    stools, two tables, and bedstead, presents the same uniform\r\n    tint of rough pine planks, as does the whole house and its\r\n    walls. The bed is very hard, but after all this exertion one\r\n    sleeps without rocking. From my window I see a knoll with\r\n    birch-trees, whose branches rustle in the breeze; between these\r\n    the mirror of the lake, and beyond it fir forests. Beside the\r\n    house is a tent for huntsman, driver, servants, and peasants;\r\n    then the carriage-house and a little dog of a village of some\r\n    eighteen or twenty huts, on both sides of a little street, and\r\n    from each of these a tired beater is looking out. I propose to\r\n    remain in this oasis till Wednesday or Thursday, then leave for\r\n    another expedition on the shore, and return this day week to\r\n    Copenhagen, on account of miserable politics. What next, I do\r\n    not know as yet.\r\n\r\n    _The 17th._—This morning early six wolves have been here and\r\n    have torn up a poor bullock; we found their fresh traces,\r\n    but personally we did not see them. From four in the morning\r\n    till eight in the evening we have been in motion, have shot\r\n    four woodcocks, slept for two hours on mown heather, and now,\r\n    dog-tired, to bed.\r\n\r\n    _The 19th._—It is impossible to send a letter to the post\r\n    from here, without sending a messenger twelve miles; I shall\r\n    therefore take this to the coast myself to-morrow. Yesterday,\r\n    when the dog pointed, and I was looking more at him than at\r\n    the ground I was treading on, I fell and hurt my left shin.\r\n    Yesterday we had a very tired day’s sport, long and rocky; it\r\n    produced me a woodcock; but has tamed me so completely, that\r\n    to-day I am sitting at home with bandages, so that I should\r\n    be ready to travel to-morrow and shoot the next day. I really\r\n    am astonished at myself for stopping at home alone in such\r\n    charming weather, and can scarcely refrain from the abominable\r\n    wish that the others will shoot nothing. It is a little too\r\n    late in the year, the birds are shy, or sport would be more\r\n    plentiful. We shot through a charming place yesterday; great\r\n    lakes, with islands and shores, mountain torrents, over rocks,\r\n    plains for miles without houses or plough-land; every thing\r\n    just as God created it, forest, field, heath, morass, and lake.\r\n    I shall certainly return hither some day.\r\n\r\n    Two gentlemen of the Danish Chambers are already back; it was\r\n    too hot for them, and they have gone to sleep. It is about\r\n    half-past five; the others will only arrive about eight. I\r\n    have been amusing myself all day in learning Danish from the\r\n    doctor who applied the bandages. We brought him with us from\r\n    Copenhagen, for there are no doctors here. Since a report\r\n    has been spread of the presence of a physician in the woods,\r\n    every day some twenty or thirty inhabitants of the huts come\r\n    streaming in to take his advice. On Sunday evening we gave a\r\n    very amusing dance to the inhabitants of the five square miles\r\n    of forest; the music was played and sung by turns. Then they\r\n    heard of the “wise man,” and now cripples of twenty years’\r\n    standing come and hope to be cured by him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Königsberg, 12th Sept., 1857.\r\n\r\n    I found to my great joy your four letters at Polangen (which,\r\n    by-the-by, is not in Prussia but Russia), and find from them\r\n    that you and the children are well. I got on very well; the\r\n    Courlanders were all touchingly kind to me, in a way seldom\r\n    found by a foreigner. Besides several roebucks and stags, I\r\n    shot five elks, one a very fine stag, measuring roughly six\r\n    feet eight, without his colossal head. He fell like a hare, but\r\n    as he was still alive, I mercifully gave him my second barrel;\r\n    scarcely had I done so ere a second came up, still taller,\r\n    so close to me that Engel, my loader, had to jump behind a\r\n    tree to avoid being run over. I was obliged to look at him\r\n    in a friendly way, as I had no other shot. I can not get rid\r\n    of this disappointment, and must complain to you about it. I\r\n    shot at another—no doubt he will be found—but one I missed\r\n    entirely. I might, therefore, have killed three more. The\r\n    night before last we left Dondangen, and in twenty-nine hours\r\n    made forty miles without a road, through the forest and desert\r\n    to Memel, in an open carriage, over stock and stone; we were\r\n    obliged to hold on, so that we should not be thrown out. After\r\n    three hours’ sleep at Memel, we started this morning in the\r\n    steamboat for this place, whence we leave for Berlin to-night\r\n    and arrive to-morrow. “We” means Behr and myself. I can not\r\n    stop in Hohendorf; I ought to have been in Berlin to-morrow, my\r\n    furlough being up. I should, however, have been obliged to give\r\n    up my best sport at Dondangen, with the enormous stags, or, as\r\n    they call them there, _bolls_; nor should I have seen how the\r\n    axle of a great wagon broke under the enormous creature. On\r\n    Monday the Emperor arrives at Berlin, therefore I am obliged to\r\n    be there “some days” before. I hope to return from Berlin to\r\n    Hohendorf and Reinfeld; but if the King goes to Frankfurt, this\r\n    is unlikely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                    Frankfurt, 19th December, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Your true sisterly heart has offered in so friendly a manner\r\n    to look after Christmas exigencies, that I will not apologize\r\n    if I now allow you to carry out the seductions of Gerson and\r\n    other rascals once more, and ask you _sans phrase_ to make the\r\n    following purchases for Johanna:—\r\n\r\n    1. Jewelry: she wishes to have an opal heart, like yours, and\r\n    “the mind of man his kingdom is.” I am willing to pay some two\r\n    hundred _thalers_ for it. If for that price it is possible\r\n    to obtain a pair of earrings, each consisting of one clear\r\n    brilliant, I should think it more tasteful. You have some like\r\n    it, but they are much dearer, and should you think the opal\r\n    heart preferable, I will try later to find a pair of fitting\r\n    earrings founded upon pearls.\r\n\r\n    2. One dress, at about one hundred _thalers_—not more. She\r\n    wants to see herself “very light and bright,” _à deux passes,\r\n    moirée antique_, or something of that kind: she requires ten\r\n    _rods_—about twenty ells.\r\n\r\n    3. Should you discover a valuable and pretty gilt fan, rustling\r\n    a great deal, buy it also. Ten _thalers_ are quite enough. I\r\n    can’t bear the things.\r\n\r\n    4. A large warm rug to lay over the feet in the carriage, with\r\n    designs of tigers, glass eyes in their heads; might be a fox or\r\n    a hippopotamus—any ferocious animal. I have seen one at ——’s,\r\n    of very soft wool; won’t cost ten _thalers_. If you want to\r\n    remain a charming sister, buy me all this, and send at once by\r\n    _express luggage train_; address, Hofrath ——, Prussian Embassy.\r\n\r\n    I have so much to write about Holstein, Mainz, the bridge of\r\n    Kehl, and all sorts of things in Berlin, that I have been\r\n    obliged to decline two capital days of sport, to-day and\r\n    to-morrow, after red deer. Johanna and the children are well,\r\n    and the former would send love if she knew I wrote; but do not\r\n    let her know any thing about it, my heart, and so farewell.\r\n    Greetings to Oscar. The money I will send through Fritz, the\r\n    receiver, by the new year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Frankfurt o. t. M., 2d April, 1858.\r\n\r\n    I quite agree with you that our position in the Zollverein\r\n    is blundered. I go further than this, being firmly convinced\r\n    that we must give notice to the whole of the Zollverein, as\r\n    soon as the term has arrived. The reasons for this conviction\r\n    are far too stratified to be developed here, and they are too\r\n    closely connected to be named one by one. We must terminate the\r\n    treaty in view of the danger of remaining alone with Dessau\r\n    and Sondershausen. It is, however, not to be _desired_ that\r\n    this last should be the case, or that such a state of things\r\n    should long subsist; therefore we must render it agreeable—if\r\n    possible, an unavoidable necessity—to the other states of the\r\n    Zollverein, during the period yet to run, that after proper\r\n    notice has been given they should seek adherence to _our_\r\n    conditions. One portion of this system would be to allow them\r\n    to draw higher nett revenues than they could obtain by frontier\r\n    customs without Prussia. Another thing is, that they must not\r\n    be allowed to think that the continuance of a Zollverein with\r\n    Prussia is impossible in fact; this would, however, be the\r\n    case if, besides the twenty-eight governments, some fifty class\r\n    corporations, guided by particular interests, should be able\r\n    to exercise a _liberum veto_. If the Prussian Chambers begin\r\n    with this, the equality vertigo of the German governments will\r\n    not allow the rest to remain behind; they will desire to make\r\n    themselves also of importance.\r\n\r\n    In order to avoid these rocks in a Zollverein to be\r\n    reconstituted by Prussia, after 1865, for the exercise of\r\n    corporation electoral rights, I think we shall have to adopt\r\n    one feature of the Union project of 1849, and erect a sort\r\n    of Customs Parliament, with conditions for _itio in partes_,\r\n    if the others demand it. The Governments will object gravely\r\n    to such a course; but if we are daring and consequent we\r\n    could effect much. The idea expressed in your letter, to make\r\n    the Prussian Chambers a means, by their representation of\r\n    all German taxpayers, to found a hegemony, is from the same\r\n    point of view. The most powerful aids of our foreign policy\r\n    might consist in the Chambers and the Press. In the present\r\n    state of things, which may be confirmed by the vote, the\r\n    Zollverein policy, the evil of the Verein for Prussia, would\r\n    render the necessity for the termination a matter for the most\r\n    circumstantial and closest debate, that a recognition of it\r\n    should take place; your letter ought to appear as an article\r\n    in the _Kreuzzeitung_, instead of lying upon my table here.\r\n    The German Custom policy should be broadly and unreservedly\r\n    discussed from the Prussian stand-point by the Chambers and the\r\n    Press—then the flagging attention of Germany would be drawn\r\n    to it, and our Chambers would become a power for Prussia in\r\n    Germany. I should like to see the Zollverein and the Bund,\r\n    with Prussia’s relations to both, subjected to the scalpel\r\n    of the acutest criticism in our Chambers. This would only be\r\n    an advantage to the King, his Ministers, and their policy,\r\n    presuming them to know their business. At the same time, I\r\n    could wish, as the result of such a discussion, that the\r\n    proposition should be _adopted_ by a small majority. For the\r\n    Zollverein desires at the present moment rather to fetter the\r\n    German governments to their flesh-pots, than for them to win\r\n    the sympathies of their subjects. The latter are powerless, as,\r\n    so far as they are concerned, a powerful, business-like, and\r\n    honorable debate would do the same as the chance of the results\r\n    of a vote.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Frankfurt, 12th Nov., 1858.\r\n\r\n    Your letter was an unexpected pleasure: the address looked just\r\n    like one of Johanna’s, and I wondered how she could have got to\r\n    the Uckermark. I have not been able to answer before: business,\r\n    a cold, hunting, has partly taken up all my time, nor did I\r\n    quite know what to write to you about the new phenomenon in the\r\n    political heaven, that I could not have written as well about\r\n    the comet—an interesting phenomenon wholly unexpected by me,\r\n    the object and nature of which is yet unknown to me. The orbit\r\n    of the comet our astronomers are pretty well able to calculate,\r\n    but it would be difficult for them to do the same by this new\r\n    political septasterism. Johanna reached here safely with the\r\n    children this morning; God be praised, they are well, but not\r\n    in good spirits. She is upset by all the political terrors\r\n    they have filled her with in Pomerania and Berlin, and I try\r\n    in vain to render her more light-hearted. The natural distress\r\n    of the lady of a house also influences her, when it becomes\r\n    doubtful whether one remains in a new house set up with care\r\n    and expense. She came hither with the idea that I was about to\r\n    take my leave. I do not know whether my resignation will be\r\n    forced on me without my own will, or whether I must seek it for\r\n    decency’s sake. Before I do it voluntarily, I shall wait to see\r\n    what the ministerial colors are.\r\n\r\n    If the Upper Chamber retain their feelings for the conservative\r\n    party, and sincerely strive for a good understanding and peace\r\n    _at home_, they may rely upon a healthy state in our _foreign_\r\n    affairs, and that is of great importance to me, for “we had\r\n    fallen, and did not know how.” That is what I especially felt.\r\n    I think that the Prince has been especially placed at the head\r\n    to secure a guarantee against party government, and against\r\n    any concessions to the Left. If I am mistaken in this, or if\r\n    they wish to dispose of me as an office-seeker, I shall retire\r\n    behind the cannon of Schönhausen, and observe how Prussia can\r\n    be governed by majorities of the Left, and also endeavor to\r\n    do my duty to the Upper Chamber. Change is the soul of life,\r\n    and I shall feel myself ten years younger if I find myself in\r\n    the same attitude as in 1848-’9. Should I not find the parts\r\n    of gentleman and diplomatist consistent, the pleasure or the\r\n    burden of fulfilling a prominent position will not cause me\r\n    to err for a moment in my choice. I have enough to live upon\r\n    according to my wants, and if God keeps my wife and children\r\n    healthy, as they have been, I say, “_vogue la galère_,” no\r\n    matter what water we swim in. It will be very unimportant to\r\n    _me_, after thirty years, whether I play the diplomatist or the\r\n    country Junker; and hitherto the prospect of an honest contest,\r\n    without being confined by any official trammels—particularly\r\n    in political swimming-baths—has almost as much charm for me\r\n    as the prospect of a _régime_ of truffles, dispatches, and\r\n    grand crosses. “After nine, all is over,” says the player. I\r\n    can not tell you more than these personal opinions—the enigma\r\n    stands before me unsolved. I have one great satisfaction here\r\n    at the Diet. All those gentlemen who six months ago demanded\r\n    my recall as a necessity for German unity, now tremble at the\r\n    thought of losing me. To —— the phantom of 1848 is a terror;\r\n    and they are all like pigeons who see the hawk—afraid of\r\n    democracy, barricades, Parliament, and ... —— sinks into my\r\n    arms touchingly, and says, with a cramped shake of the hand,\r\n    “We are again forced into _one_ field.” The French naturally,\r\n    but the English also, look upon us as firebrands, and the\r\n    Russians fear that the Emperor will be led astray by our plans\r\n    of reform. I say to every one naturally, “Only be calm, and all\r\n    will come right;” and they answer, “Yes, if you were going to\r\n    stay, then we should have a guarantee, but ...” If he doesn’t\r\n    feel Frankfurt singing in his ears, he has no ear-drums. In a\r\n    week he has been degraded from a worthy liberal conservative\r\n    in the imaginations of his eventual colleagues, to a scarlet\r\n    tiger—helper’s helper of Kinkel and D’Ester. The Bamberg\r\n    diplomatist talks of a continental assurance against Prussian\r\n    firebrandism, growls of a tri-Imperial alliance against us—a\r\n    new Olmütz with effectual operations. In short, the political\r\n    world is getting less tiresome. My children cry, “Pietsch\r\n    comes!” in the joy at my having a servant of that name at\r\n    Schönhausen; and it would seem that the arrival of this Pietsch\r\n    and the comet are not without significance. Heartily farewell,\r\n    my very dear one, and greet Oscar. He must not hang down his\r\n    head—it’s all gammon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Frankfurt, 10th Dec., 1858.\r\n\r\n    You had rightly guessed in your letter to Johanna, that\r\n    your kindness would be asked for a Christmas commission. I\r\n    should like to give Johanna a bracelet. The kind of thing\r\n    flitting before me is broad, smooth, mailed, bending, made of\r\n    chessboard-patterned little four-cornered gold pieces—_without_\r\n    jewels—pure gold, as far as two hundred _thalers_ will go.\r\n    If you find something that pleases you better, I have every\r\n    confidence in your taste. The exact thing in the fashion is\r\n    not, _therefore_, pleasing to me—such things last longer\r\n    than the fashion. Be so good, and have it directed to “Privy\r\n    Councillor ——, Prussian Embassy,” with an inclosed letter for\r\n    _me_, or the old gentleman may think it a delicate attention\r\n    for _himself_.\r\n\r\n    Johanna will have written you as to the child complaints we\r\n    have had, and how I have suffered from colds and coughs. I\r\n    do not know whether much or little sleep, diet or excess,\r\n    housekeeping or hunting, improves or hurts, but I turn from\r\n    one to the other, from ideas of health. As to my transfer or\r\n    recall, all is still again; for a time, Petersburg seemed very\r\n    certain, and I had grown so accustomed to the idea, that I\r\n    felt quite disappointed when the rumor went forth that I was\r\n    to remain here. There will be some bad political weather here,\r\n    which I should be very glad to weather out in bear-furs, with\r\n    caviar and elk-shooting. Our new Cabinet is still looked upon\r\n    abroad with suspicion; Austria alone, with cunning calculation,\r\n    gives it a meed of praise; while ——, behind his hand, warns\r\n    us; and so do his colleagues, at all the courts. The cat won’t\r\n    let the mice alone. But, in the end, the ministers must show a\r\n    policy; merely cursing the Kreuzzeitung will not last forever.\r\n    I shall hardly come to Berlin in the winter; it would be very\r\n    agreeable if you would visit us here before I am “put out in\r\n    the cold” on the Neva.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                    St. Petersburg, 12th May, 1859.\r\n\r\n    I have become convinced, by the experience of the eight years\r\n    of my official life in Frankfurt, that the settlement by the\r\n    Diet, made in those days, forms a pressing, and, in critical\r\n    times, a vitally dangerous fetter for Prussia, without giving,\r\n    in return, such equivalents, enjoyed by Austria, under an\r\n    unequally large mass of free self-action. The two greater\r\n    Powers do not attain an equal measurement from the Princes\r\n    and Governments of the smaller States; the construction of\r\n    the object and the law of the Diet is modified according to\r\n    the requirements of Austrian policy. I need not, considering\r\n    your knowledge, enter upon more circumstantial arguments\r\n    respecting the history of the policy of the Diet since 1850,\r\n    and hence confine myself by naming the paragraphs concerning\r\n    the restoration of the Diet, the question of the German Navy,\r\n    Customs disputes, the laws respecting commerce, the press, and\r\n    the Constitution, the Diet fortresses of Rastatt and Mainz, and\r\n    the questions of Neuenburg and the East. _We have always found\r\n    ourselves face to face with the same compact majority, with\r\n    the same demand for concessions from Prussia._ In the Eastern\r\n    question, the power of Austria has ever proved so superior to\r\n    ours, that even the identity of the wishes and aspirations\r\n    of the Diet governments, with the efforts of Prussia, have\r\n    presented for her an ever-receding obstacle. With scarcely\r\n    any exception, our associates in the Diet have given us to\r\n    understand, or have even openly declared, that they were\r\n    unable to maintain the Diet with us, should Austria pursue her\r\n    own course; although it is unquestionable that federal law\r\n    and real German interests were side by side with our peace\r\n    policy; this, at least, was then the opinion of almost all\r\n    the Princes. Would the latter have ever brought their own\r\n    interests and wishes as a sacrifice to the wants, or even\r\n    the safety, of Prussia? Certainly not: for their attachment\r\n    to Austria is founded on outbalancing false interests, which\r\n    prescribe to both a coalition against Prussia, a repression of\r\n    all further development of the influence and power of Prussia,\r\n    as a foundation for their common policy. A development of\r\n    federal relations, under Austrian leadership, is the natural\r\n    end of the policy of the German Princes and their Ministers;\r\n    according to their opinions, this can only be accomplished at\r\n    the expense of Prussia, and is necessarily directed against\r\n    Prussia, so long as Prussia will not confine herself to the\r\n    useful problem of providing for her equally entitled associates\r\n    in the Diet an assurance against the preponderance of Austria,\r\n    and is willing to bear the disproportion of her duties towards\r\n    her rights in the Diet, being resigned to the wishes of the\r\n    majority with untiring complacency. This tendency of the policy\r\n    of the Central States will reappear with the constancy of\r\n    the magnetic needle after every evanescent variation, because\r\n    it represents no arbitrary product of individual events or\r\n    persons, but is, in fact, a natural and necessary result of\r\n    federal relations for the smaller States. There are no existing\r\n    means by which we can maintain the actual federal treaties in\r\n    an intimate manner.\r\n\r\n    Since our associates in the Diet, some years ago, began,\r\n    under the guidance of Austria, to bring to light, from the\r\n    hitherto neglected arsenal of the constitution of the Diet, the\r\n    principles that would give prominence to their system—since\r\n    it has been endeavored, in a partial way, to stifle the\r\n    policy of Prussia by propositions which could only possess\r\n    one signification in the sense of their proposers, in so far\r\n    as they apply to the unanimity of Prussia and Austria—we have\r\n    been obliged to endure the stress of the situation that the\r\n    Diet and its whole historical development has forced upon us.\r\n    We could say to ourselves, that in peaceful and orderly times\r\n    we could weaken the evil in its results by skillful treatment,\r\n    but we should be powerless to effect a cure; it is only too\r\n    natural that in dangerous times, such as the present, the\r\n    other side, in possession of all the advantages of the Diet\r\n    settlement, should willingly confess that much has taken place\r\n    of an improper nature, but should at the same time declare, in\r\n    the “general interests,” that the present juncture is highly\r\n    inapplicable for the discussion of past matters and “internal”\r\n    disputes. But such an opportunity, if we do not make use of it\r\n    at once, may not so speedily recur; and in the future we shall\r\n    be forced to our normal resignation, which allows of no changes\r\n    in the condition of things in orderly times.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness the Prince Regent has taken up a position\r\n    commanding the unqualified approval of all those who are\r\n    entitled to form any judgment of Prussian politics, and who\r\n    thence have not allowed themselves to be disturbed by party\r\n    feeling. Some of our associates in the Diet seek to blind us,\r\n    by thoughtless and fanatical efforts, as to this attitude. If\r\n    the statesmen of Bamberg are so frivolously ready to follow\r\n    the first war outcry of an uncritical and mutable public\r\n    opinion, if it does not take place probably quite without a\r\n    comforting after-thought of the easiness with which a small\r\n    state can change its colors in case of need; but if, in order\r\n    to send a power like Prussia under fire, they desire to make\r\n    use of the treaties of the Diet; if it be supposed that we\r\n    shall substitute property and blood for political wisdom, and\r\n    the thirst for action on the part of governments, to whom our\r\n    defense is absolutely necessary for their existence; if these\r\n    States think they are to dictate the guiding impulse, and\r\n    regard _theories concerning the rights of the Diet_ as means to\r\n    such an end, then _with such recognition all Prussian political\r\n    autonomy would be over_; then, in my opinion, it would be time\r\n    for us to remember that the guides, who imagine we should\r\n    follow them, serve other interests than those of Prussia, and\r\n    that they understand the interests of Germany they talk so much\r\n    about as non-identical with the interests of Prussia, if we\r\n    decline to accede to their desires.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps I am going too far when I express it as my opinion,\r\n    that we should seize every justifiable opportunity, presented\r\n    by our associates in the Diet, to arrive at the revision\r\n    of our mutual relations, necessary to Prussia, by which\r\n    she can exist in defined relations to the smaller German\r\n    States. I think we should willingly take up the gauntlet,\r\n    and regard it as no misfortune, but as real progress, a\r\n    crisis leading to improvement, if a majority at Frankfurt\r\n    should decide upon such a vote, which we could look upon as\r\n    a transgression of competency, an arbitrary change in the\r\n    object of the confederation, a violation of its treaties. _The\r\n    more unmistakable this violation the better._ We shall not\r\n    easily find conditions of such a favorable nature in Austria,\r\n    France, and Russia, by which we can alter our own position\r\n    towards Germany for the better. Our allies are on the high\r\n    road towards giving us perfectly justifiable motives for such\r\n    a course, without our stimulating their insolence. Even the\r\n    _Kreuzzeitung_, as I see by the number of last Sunday, is\r\n    becoming somewhat startled at the thought that a Frankfurt\r\n    majority could immediately dispose of the Prussian army. _Not\r\n    in this newspaper alone_ have I hitherto perceived with sorrow\r\n    how Austria has established an autocracy over the German press\r\n    by the skillfully laid net of her influence, and how well\r\n    she knows to use the weapon. Without this, so-called public\r\n    opinion could scarcely have risen to this height; I designate\r\n    it so-called, for the real mass of the population is never\r\n    inclined for war, unless the demonstrable suffering of real\r\n    oppression has aroused it. To such a pitch has it risen, that\r\n    even under the cloak of general German opinion, any Prussian\r\n    newspaper can hardly declare itself in favor of Prussian\r\n    patriotism. General Twiddle-twaddle plays a great part in this,\r\n    nor must we omit the Zwanzigers (cash) that never fail Austria\r\n    for this aim. Most newspaper correspondents write for their\r\n    bread and cheese, most newspapers look to their incomes, and\r\n    an experienced reader may easily see, by our newspapers and\r\n    others, whether they have received, or speedily anticipate, or\r\n    wish by threatening pantomime to force, a subsidy from Austria.\r\n\r\n    I think we should produce an admirable revulsion in public\r\n    opinion if we were to sound the chords of independent Prussian\r\n    policy in the press, in opposition to the exaggerations of our\r\n    German allies. Perhaps things may happen at Frankfurt which may\r\n    give us full reason to do so.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances the wisdom of our military\r\n    precautions might be extended in other directions, and impart\r\n    significance to our attitude; then Prussian self-respect would\r\n    speak perhaps with a more conclusive tone than the Diet. _I\r\n    should only then care to see the word “German” in place of\r\n    “Prussian” inscribed upon our standard, when we should have\r\n    become more intimately and effectually bound up with our German\r\n    fellow-countrymen than we have hitherto been_; the word loses\r\n    its charm in proximity to the ideas of the Diet.\r\n\r\n    I fear that your Excellency will interrupt me in this\r\n    epistolary digression into the field of my former activity,\r\n    with the cry, “_Ne sutor ultra crepidam_;” nor was it my\r\n    intention to hold an official oration; I desired only to\r\n    present the testimony of an experienced person against the\r\n    Diet. _I see in our position in the Diet, a defect of Prussia,\r\n    which we shall have sooner or later to heal, ferro et igni_,\r\n    unless we adopt in time, and at a proper season of the year,\r\n    measures for a cure. Were the Confederation abolished this very\r\n    day, without substituting something in its place, I believe\r\n    that this negative acquisition would soon form better and more\r\n    natural relations between Prussia and her German neighbors,\r\n    than have hitherto existed.\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BALL AT BISMARCK’S.]\r\n\r\n    TO A PRUSSIAN DIPLOMATIST.\r\n\r\n                                        Petersburg, 1st July, 1859.\r\n\r\n    I thank you for your letter, and hope you will not allow the\r\n    first to be the last. Among the matters which interest me, the\r\n    Frankfurt negotiations, next to immediate necessities, occupy\r\n    the first place with me, and I am very much obliged for any\r\n    news from thence. I regard our policy, up till now, as correct;\r\n    but I look mournfully into the future. We have armed ourselves\r\n    too soon and too strongly, and the heavy load which we have\r\n    assumed is dragging us down an inclined plane. There will be\r\n    intervention in order to occupy the Landwehr, as people do not\r\n    like simply to send them back home. We then shall not even\r\n    be Austria’s reserve, but shall sacrifice ourselves directly\r\n    for Austria, and relieve her of the stress of war. The first\r\n    shot on the Rhine brings with it a German war as the chief\r\n    circumstance, from its threatening Paris. Austria will get\r\n    breathing time; and will she make use of her freedom to aid us\r\n    in playing a brilliant part? Will her efforts not rather be\r\n    directed so to shape the measure and form of our success as\r\n    it may serve specific Austrian interests? If we are worsted,\r\n    the Federal States will all desert us, like faded plums in the\r\n    wind; and each State, the capital of which receives a French\r\n    garrison, will save itself in a patriotic way on the raft of\r\n    a new Rhenish Confederation. Perhaps it will be possible to\r\n    attain a combination of measures on the part of the three\r\n    great neutral Powers. We are too expensively armed to be able\r\n    to wait the result as patiently as England and Russia, and\r\n    our intervention will scarcely bring to light that quadrature\r\n    of the circle—a peace basis agreeable to France and Austria.\r\n    The public voice in Vienna is said to be very bitter against\r\n    their own Government, and is stated to have reached the pitch\r\n    of hissing their national hymn. Our enthusiasm for war seems\r\n    also to be only of a moderate character, and it will be\r\n    difficult to convince the nation that war and its evils are an\r\n    unavoidable necessity. The proof of this is too artificial for\r\n    the comprehension of a Landwehr man.\r\n\r\n    In a business point of view, my position here is very pleasant;\r\n    but there is a great deal to do to manage forty thousand\r\n    Prussians, for whom one has to be police, advocate, judge,\r\n    assistant, and councillor—every day there are twenty to fifty\r\n    signatures, without passports. I am still, as it were, in camp,\r\n    with a few beds, towels, and caps, bought in a hurry; without\r\n    cook and kitchen, as all utensils are wanting—and, in all\r\n    this heat, without summer clothing! My house is large enough,\r\n    and handsomely situated on the Newa; three great saloons, two\r\n    of them larger than those at Seufferheld’s; I have had the\r\n    Chancery placed in one, with a good flooring, looking-glass\r\n    doors, and silver chandeliers. All that I have as yet received\r\n    from Frankfurt are my weapons, unfortunately packed under\r\n    some crown chandeliers in such a way that three guns were\r\n    quite broken to pieces, and the barrels ruined. I wonder what\r\n    wiseacre packed them! If the rest of the things have been\r\n    packed so, I may perhaps congratulate myself if they have been\r\n    lost. The insurance is small, if the plate is with it; the\r\n    premium high, because the fool has insured against “war risk!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Hohendorf, 3d February, 1860.\r\n\r\n    I still hear with pleasure, and with a sort of longing for\r\n    home, all intelligence concerning the state of things and\r\n    persons at Frankfurt; and when I read the papers, I often feel\r\n    a desire to hurry into the midst of battles at the sessions.\r\n    The campaign over the war constitution was capital. Let them\r\n    proceed openly and daringly to urge our demands; they are\r\n    too just not finally to be, although slowly, recognized. The\r\n    Sovereign States, by grace of the Rhenish Confederation and the\r\n    Diet, can not rely upon their particularity for any duration\r\n    against the stream of events. As in my recovery, there may\r\n    occur a time of standing-still and relapse occasionally; but\r\n    it still will go forward, when we courageously _dare_ and are\r\n    not ashamed of our daring any more, but openly proclaim in the\r\n    Diet, in the press, and, above all, in our Chambers, that which\r\n    we desire to represent in Germany, and what the Federation has\r\n    hitherto been for Prussia—an Alp and a noose about our necks,\r\n    with the end of it in the hands of the enemy, that only waits\r\n    the proper moment to run it tight. But enough of politics.\r\n\r\n    I hope soon to be in trim for my journey—am perhaps already\r\n    so. My wife and the physicians conjure me to go south—to\r\n    Heidelberg or Switzerland. I long for Petersburg, that I may at\r\n    last live quietly in my own house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Petersburg, 16th June, 1860.\r\n\r\n    We are pretty well at present, and I am much better than if I\r\n    were in Germany without being wanted. Rest and the comforts of\r\n    domestic life are doing their best. It is 24° in the shade,[43]\r\n    but always cool nights. Business proceeds, thanks to so\r\n    delightful a Minister as Gortschakoff, without annoyance—in\r\n    short, _cela va bien, pourvu que cela dure_. Our relations here\r\n    are excellent, no matter what the newspapers may fable about it.\r\n\r\n    The Augsburger people and Company are still afraid lest I\r\n    should become Minister, and think they can prevent it by\r\n    abusing me and my Franco-Russian ideas. It is a great honor to\r\n    be dreaded by the enemies of Prussia. My political flirtations\r\n    in the spring, at the Court, and with the Ministry, have,\r\n    furthermore, been so accurately sifted that they are well aware\r\n    of what the state of the case is, and how I am believed to find\r\n    precisely in the national aspirations powers of resistance and\r\n    strength. If I _am_ written down a devil, it is a Teutonic\r\n    one, and no Gallic fiend. ——’s lie factory might attack me\r\n    much more to the purpose on other grounds than on Bonapartism,\r\n    if they wish to make an impression at our Court, as among the\r\n    Augsburgers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  St. Petersburg, 22d August, 1860.\r\n\r\n    I am quite excluded from home politics, for with the exception\r\n    of newspapers, I only receive official statements, which do not\r\n    give me the groundwork of things. According to these, we have\r\n    promised nothing definite at Teplitz, but have made our support\r\n    of Austria dependent upon that _practical_ demonstration of\r\n    her good-will towards us in German politics; when this has\r\n    been done, she may reckon on our gratitude. I should be very\r\n    content with this; and if we only see the Vienna soap in a\r\n    lather, we should be glad to return the service. Certainly\r\n    the indirect accounts we receive from other courts sound\r\n    otherwise. According to these, if true, though we have not\r\n    concluded any guarantee treaty, we have, at any rate, bound\r\n    ourselves verbally to assist Austria, under all circumstances,\r\n    should she be _attacked_ by _France_ in Italy. Should Austria\r\n    find it necessary to act on the offensive, our consent would\r\n    be requisite, if our co-operation is to be anticipated. This\r\n    version appears more unprejudiced than it would, in fact, be.\r\n    Austria having security that we should fight for Venice, she\r\n    will know how to provoke the _attack_ of France—it has been\r\n    asserted that since Teplitz, Austria has come out boldly and\r\n    defiantly in Italy. Viennese politics, since the Garibaldian\r\n    expedition, desire to make things in Italy as bad as they can\r\n    be, in order that if Napoleon himself should find it necessary\r\n    to declare against the Italian Revolution, movements should\r\n    commence on all sides and former conditions be assimilatively\r\n    restored. This reckoning with and upon Napoleon may be very\r\n    deceptive, and it would seem as if, since Teplitz, it has\r\n    been given up, and there were hopes of attaining results by\r\n    _opposing_ Napoleon. The restless, passionate character of\r\n    Austrian politics endangers peace in both ways. What will the\r\n    Chamber say to Teplitz—to the organization of the army? All\r\n    sensible men will naturally agree with Government as to the\r\n    latter. But the influence of foreign politics can first be\r\n    estimated, when it is known _what the meaning of Teplitz really\r\n    is_. A well-informed but somewhat Bonapartist correspondent\r\n    writes to me from Berlin, “We were prettily taken in at Teplitz\r\n    by Viennese good-humor; sold, for nothing, not even a mess of\r\n    pottage.” God grant that he errs in this! In speaking of the\r\n    Bonapartists, it occurs to me that some kind of general rumors\r\n    reach me, that the press, _National Verein_, _Magdeburger_,\r\n    _Ostpreussische Zeitung_, carry on a systematic war of calumny\r\n    against me. I am said to have openly supported Russo-French\r\n    pretensions respecting a cession of the Rhine province, on the\r\n    condition of compensation nearer home; I am a second Borries,\r\n    and so on. I will pay a thousand Fredericks-d’or to the person\r\n    who will prove to me that any such Russo-French propositions\r\n    have ever been brought to my knowledge by any one. In the whole\r\n    period of my German residence I never advised any thing else\r\n    than that we should rely on our _own_ strength, and in the case\r\n    of war, upon the aid of the national forces of Germany. These\r\n    foolish geese of the German press do not see that in attacking\r\n    me they are losing the better part of their own efforts. I am\r\n    informed that the fountain-head of these attacks was the Court\r\n    of Coburg, in a writer who has personal spite against me.\r\n    Were I an Austrian statesman, or a German Prince and Austrian\r\n    reactionist, like the Duke of Meiningen, our _Kreuzzeitung_\r\n    would have protected me as it has him; the mendacity of these\r\n    assaults is unknown to some of our political friends. As I am,\r\n    however, an old member of their party, entertaining particular\r\n    ideas upon certain points, well known to him to his misfortune,\r\n    I may be slandered to their hearts’ content. I hear of the\r\n    whole affair principally from the _officious_ advocacy of the\r\n    _Elberfeld Zeitung_, which is sent to me. There is nothing\r\n    like inquisitors among themselves, and friends, who long have\r\n    partaken of the same cup, are more unjust than foes. I am\r\n    satisfied. One ought not to rely on men, and I am thankful for\r\n    every breath which draws me inward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Stolpmünde, 18th Sept., 1861.\r\n\r\n    In reference to the Conservative programme, I fully subscribe\r\n    to your observations. The _negative_ construction prevailing\r\n    throughout of the propositions should have been avoided from\r\n    the first. A political party can never stand, much less conquer\r\n    position and adherents, by a mere languid defensive policy.\r\n    Every party professes to abhor the dirt of the German Republic,\r\n    and the Opposition now forming give themselves honest trouble\r\n    not to have it—that is, the dirt. A figure of speech so much\r\n    wider than the requirements of the time, either means nothing,\r\n    or conceals what people do not desire to say. I myself am\r\n    in doubt whether the authors of the programme do not really\r\n    stand at the pure Würzburg point of view. Among our best\r\n    friends, we have so many doctrinaires who ask from Prussia an\r\n    identical duty of protecting foreign princes and countries as\r\n    she protects her own subjects. The system of the solidarity of\r\n    the conservative interests of all countries, is a dangerous\r\n    fiction as long as the fullest and most honest reciprocity does\r\n    not exist between the rulers of all countries. Were Prussia to\r\n    carry it out in isolation, it would become Quixotism, which\r\n    would only weaken our King and his Government in the solution\r\n    of the most important question, viz., that defense of Prussia\r\n    confided to the Crown of Prussia by the Almighty, against\r\n    injustice coming from within or without. We are gradually\r\n    making the whole unhistorical, ungodly, and illegal sovereignty\r\n    swindle of _those_ German princes who use the Confederation as\r\n    a pedestal whence to play at being European powers, into the\r\n    nurse-child of the Conservative party of Prussia. Internally\r\n    our Prussian _Government_ is liberal; abroad it is legitimist.\r\n    We respect foreign crown rights with greater constancy than\r\n    we do our own, and become enthusiastic about those lesser\r\n    sovereignties created by Napoleon and sanctioned by Metternich,\r\n    to blindness against all the perils with which the independence\r\n    of Prussia and Germany is threatened in the future, as long as\r\n    the nonsense of the _present_ Confederation endures, which is\r\n    nothing more than a hothouse of dangerous and revolutionary\r\n    efforts. I could have wished that, instead of vague expressions\r\n    against the German Republic, it had been openly stated in\r\n    the programme what we desire to see changed and restored in\r\n    Germany, whether by justly directed efforts towards alterations\r\n    in the constitution of the Confederation, such as definite\r\n    associations like the Customs Union, and the Military Treaty\r\n    of Coburg. We have the double task of giving evidence that the\r\n    existing Confederation is not our _ideal_, but that we purpose\r\n    to attempt the necessary alterations openly in a legal way,\r\n    and that we do not intend to go _beyond_ these in confirming\r\n    security and prosperity. To us the necessity of a firmer\r\n    consolidation of our defensive powers is as patent as that of\r\n    daily bread; we require a new and plastic system of customs,\r\n    and a number of institutions in common, to defend material\r\n    interests against the evils resulting from the unnatural\r\n    interior configuration of German frontiers. There should be no\r\n    doubt as to the sincerity and earnestness with which we ask for\r\n    these objects. Nor do I see, moreover, _why we should recoil\r\n    so prudishly from the idea of popular representation, whether\r\n    in the Diet, or in any customs, or associative parliament_.\r\n    Surely we can not combat an institution as revolutionary which\r\n    is legally established in every German State, and which we\r\n    Conservatives even would not wish to see abolished, even in\r\n    Prussia. In national matters we have hitherto regarded very\r\n    moderate concessions as valuable. A thoroughly conservative\r\n    national representation might be created, and yet receive the\r\n    gratitude of the liberals.\r\n\r\n    I am interrupted by the sounds of packing. In case you still\r\n    have an opportunity of conferring with our friends on the\r\n    subject, I enclose you the sketch I read to you with the\r\n    request, however, that it shall not become public, as I am\r\n    unaware whether the King would like that this hasty memorandum\r\n    of the conversation I had with His Majesty, and which I\r\n    committed to writing at his command, should become known, as I\r\n    hear several discussions have taken place about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Berlin, the 2d Oct., 1861.\r\n\r\n    In Koblenz and here I have been active for German politics,\r\n    and in the present state of things not quite without results.\r\n    I wrote about the 19th of last month from Stolpmünde to your\r\n    residence here, and enclosed in my letter the draught of the\r\n    short sketch I had presented to the King. I am to carry this\r\n    matter into greater detail. If, therefore, the letter and\r\n    enclosure, as I hope, has reached your hands, I beg of you to\r\n    send it me to Reinfeld, that I may work it up more completely\r\n    there. I am really home-sick for my household on the English\r\n    Quay, with the tranquil view of the Neva ice. On the 13th, it\r\n    will be necessary to meet at Königsberg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Berlin, the 16th May, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I can understand your hesitation against the address, which,\r\n    however, in my opinion, at the present time seizes the\r\n    diplomatic position with useful pressure. I may certainly be\r\n    mistaken in this, for the longer I act in political affairs\r\n    the less is my confidence in human calculation; and if you\r\n    feel an inward opposition to it, I speak the less of it, as\r\n    I would rather be able to declare with a good conscience\r\n    that the Government has not inspired the idea mirrored in\r\n    it. The actual state of things, however, is such, that it\r\n    appears very necessary to let loose all the dogs willing to\r\n    give tongue (forgive this sporting simile) against Denmark\r\n    at the conference; the general cry of the pack will effect a\r\n    conviction on the part of alien Powers that the subjection of\r\n    the Duchies to Denmark is an impossibility, and the latter will\r\n    be obliged to consider projects which the Prussian Government\r\n    can not present to them. Among alien Powers in this last\r\n    category I class the Holsteiners themselves, together with the\r\n    _Augustenburg_, and all the eternally ignoble down to Königsau.\r\n    The Duchies have hitherto played the part of the birthday\r\n    child in the German family, and have accustomed themselves to\r\n    think that we are willing to bring every sacrifice to the\r\n    altar of their particular interests, and are willing to risk\r\n    the existence of Prussia for every individual German in the\r\n    north of Schleswig. The address will especially counteract this\r\n    frenzy; I do not fear that it will have so strong an effect as\r\n    to bring us into any difficulty. If Prussian ambition were to\r\n    rise to such a height among the nation, so that the Government,\r\n    instead of stimulating, would have to moderate the feeling, I\r\n    should not at all regret such a condition.\r\n\r\n    You will perceive from this how I comprehend the matter from a\r\n    human point of view. As to the rest, my impression of gratitude\r\n    for God’s assistance till now rises into a conviction that the\r\n    Lord knows how to turn even our errors to our benefit. I daily\r\n    observe this with salutary humility.\r\n\r\n    To clear up the situation I will conclude by saying that to me\r\n    Prussian annexation is _not_ the chief and necessary end, but\r\n    probably the most agreeable result.\r\n\r\n    With hearty salutation to your honored household, I am yours,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\nThat Bismarck not only followed the German policy of Austria, but also\r\nher whole political action, with the lynx eyes of an opponent, is a\r\nmatter of course, and he soon perceived on what a dangerous error this\r\nwas based. Relying upon the apparent power which Prince Schwarzenberg’s\r\ndaring moves, and Radetzky’s victories over Sardinia had obtained,\r\nAustria desired to attain to a European hegemony for herself by\r\ndiplomatic trickery. By amity with France she wished to keep Italy down;\r\nby amity with England to overawe Turkey: by the alliance of both, as well\r\nas by the pressure she thought to exert over Prussia and the other German\r\nStates, to humble and lame Russia, in whom she saw the sole antagonist of\r\nher visionary hegemony. This plan, however, which explains the attitude\r\nof Austria during the Eastern war, was condemned to failure, as the\r\nmassive power of Russia, under the most favorable circumstances, could\r\nonly be transitorily shaken by the temporary alliance of England and\r\nFrance; was condemned, as France certainly did not remain quiet in the\r\nwest, out of pure friendship for Austria, after measuring swords with\r\nRussia in the East; was condemned because England scarcely would do any\r\nthing for Austria after attaining her ends in the East; finally it was\r\nmost certainly condemned, as Austria undervalued the power of Prussia to\r\nan almost incomprehensible degree. Bismarck foresaw this failure, and, in\r\nhis opinion, Prussia ought to make use of the crisis which had arrived\r\nto save herself and Germany from Austria. Hence at Berlin he continually\r\nurged the uttermost possible increase in the strength of the army. Nor\r\nwere his warnings neglected, but, to his deep sorrow, circumstances\r\ntook such a form that when the crisis actually came Prussia made no use\r\nof the situation. When the Italian war broke out, when Prussia did not\r\ndeclare against Austria, the Ministry thought the presence of Bismarck\r\nin Frankfurt had become an impossibility, and he was recalled. It was\r\nreserved for Bismarck himself, eight years afterwards, to carry through\r\nhis German policy, by which Prussia was alone to accomplish her proper\r\nposition, although at that time it was in alliance with France. Bismarck,\r\nin 1858, left the scene of his activity in Frankfurt with a heavy heart.\r\nHe was convinced it was only there, where he was so accurately acquainted\r\nwith the ground, that he could render his King and country important\r\nservices. He departed with patriotic indignation at the contempt which\r\nAustria openly showed towards Prussia, but he also knew that a time of\r\nretribution would arrive.\r\n\r\nHis position at Frankfurt gave Bismarck an advantage not lightly esteemed\r\nby the statesman. Frankfurt lies like a great hotel on the road into\r\nwhich the great European travelling guild especially loves to call in\r\nthe summer time. Not only did the representative of Prussia entertain\r\nprincely guests, related or friendly to the Royal House of Prussia, but\r\ngradually became acquainted with a great number of the ministers and\r\ndiplomatists of all European States. Among the princely personages whom\r\nhe received in Frankfurt, and to whom he afterwards paid his respects\r\nin the watering-places close at hand, we should especially name the\r\nGrand-Duchess Helena of Russia, a born Princess of Würtemberg and widow\r\nof the Grand-Duke Michael Paulowitsch, a lady of extraordinary abilities,\r\nand well informed in political matters, whose influence is said to be\r\nvery great, and that not alone in Russia.\r\n\r\nAmong the statesmen whose acquaintance Bismarck made upon the Rhine,\r\nwe must first name the venerable Prince Metternich, to whom he paid a\r\nvisit, shortly after his arrival in Frankfurt in the summer of 1851, at\r\nthe Castle of Johannisberg. He had many conversations with the man who\r\nhad so long conducted the policy of Austria, in more than one respect,\r\nin so masterly a manner, and, in contradistinction to Schwarzenberg, had\r\never evinced a statesmanlike amenity towards Prussia, and continued to do\r\nthis in a very distinct manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMetternich and Bismarck seated together at the Johannisberg! The one\r\nvenerable with age, who had been every thing; the other a man who\r\nwas to become every thing. The representative of the past, and the\r\nrepresentative of the future; the past had been allotted to Austria,\r\nthe future was to be the heritage of Prussia. The present and the\r\nJohannisberg constituted the neutral ground where the last remains of\r\nAustrian good-will towards Prussia, and the last fragments of traditional\r\nreverence for Austria in Bismarck’s patriotic heart, were to meet. The\r\ntwo statesmen parted from each other with mutual respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK ON THE NEVA.\r\n\r\n[1859-1862.]\r\n\r\n    Ambassador to St. Petersburg.—Illness.—Journey.—Hunting.—The\r\n    Coronation of William I.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that Bismarck would have preferred to remain at\r\nFrankfurt, because he hoped to be useful to Prussia; and he personally\r\ncomplained to the Prince Regent of his transference. The Prince Regent,\r\non the other hand, demonstrated to him that such an official position\r\nin St. Petersburg was one of the first in the diplomacy of Prussia, and\r\nthat he ought to regard his mission there as a distinction. It was,\r\nperhaps, fortunate for Bismarck that thus placed in a remote position\r\nfrom the party spirit of those days, he was able as from an observatory\r\nto watch the course of political events, both inwardly and outwardly,\r\nand allow his views to assume distinctness, his plans to ripen. To his\r\nmany journeys was also due the preservation of personal interests. The\r\npeculiar good-will with which he was received by the Czar, and especially\r\nby the Empress-Mother at that time, he knew how to preserve, at the same\r\ntime winning the respect of the Russian statesmen. Of his life in these\r\ndays, his letters, which we shall presently communicate, addressed to his\r\nwife and sister, afford us most characteristic traits. From this time\r\nforward, sadly enough, several attacks of indisposition appear, which\r\ndull the picture of manly strength and health we have hitherto beheld\r\nin him. In March he set forward on his journey to St. Petersburg, and\r\nassumed his new office on his birthday, the 1st of April, 1859; in May he\r\nwent to Moscow, but upon his return he became seriously ill, and suffered\r\ngreatly from a rheumatic attack in the left leg, which was very painful\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe there placed himself in the hands of his physicians. One evening a\r\nblister was applied to the calf of the leg, and Bismarck went to sleep,\r\nbut soon awoke in raging tortures, which increased to such a degree that\r\nhe tore away the blister, and with it some portion of the flesh. Perhaps\r\nin the end this proved his salvation, but such remarkable symptoms of\r\nillness appeared that it was necessary for him to ask permission for\r\nleave of absence in Berlin. The Emperor was terrified at the alteration\r\nin Bismarck, when he came to present his letters of recall. After a\r\nmiserable journey Bismarck arrived in Berlin, but in a pitiable state.\r\nHe remained there at the Hotel d’Angleterre in a hopeless condition;\r\nthe physicians treated with him iodine, without, however, any result,\r\nand in this condition he was found by his wife, whom he summoned from\r\nPomerania. Madame von Bismarck, in every thing touching her husband,\r\npossesses the greatest energy and affection; herself instructed in the\r\nhealing art, she had all the iodine bottles thrown away, and devoted\r\nherself to the sick-bed. From this time the condition of Bismarck visibly\r\nimproved, and although much still remained ere he could regard himself\r\nas fully convalescent, he was at any rate enabled to seek further\r\nhealth and strength at Wiesbaden and Nauheim. The cure, however, was\r\nvery incomplete, and it cost him a great effort to perform the duty of\r\nreceiving the Emperor Alexander at Warsaw, and attending him to Berlin.\r\nAfter this he sought retirement for a while with his family at Reinfeld,\r\nwhence he proposed to return to his post in St. Petersburg in November.\r\n\r\nReinfeld has been so often mentioned in these pages, and that spot\r\nof ground has so much significance for Bismarck, that some few notes\r\nconcerning it can not be unwelcome to the reader. Reinfeld lies in the\r\nundulating hill country slanting from the Baltic land-ridge towards the\r\nEastern Ocean, close to the left bank of the Stolpe, in a very pleasant\r\npart of Pomerania. The mansion of Reinfeld presents that peculiar type\r\nof Christian amiability,[44] which, in its unaffectation, produces so\r\npleasant an effect on the visitor. There is nothing artificial about it.\r\nIn the courtyard no oaths are heard, but in place of these the venerable\r\nHerr von Putkammer raises his velvet skull-cap, and from his lips come\r\nthe peaceful words, “Let us all return our thanks unto the Lord,” etc.,\r\nwhen at harvest-home the reapers enter with the corn-wreath of increase.\r\n\r\nBismarck had often fled to these fragrant Hinder Pomerania thorn-thickets\r\nfor rest and refreshment in the summer-time, from busy official life and\r\nthe social saloon of office. Hitherward he bent his steps cheerfully\r\nfrom Berlin and Paris, from Frankfurt and St. Petersburg. Here, with\r\nheartfelt contentment, he greeted his ancient friend, the forest; and in\r\nthe neighborhood of Reinfeld there are many select localities remaining\r\nas proofs of his never-resting spirit of enterprise—as green trophies of\r\nhis creative power. Frau von Bismarck, too, had grown up in Reinfeld.\r\nThere she lived, at the service of all, with words of comfort and active\r\naid, as well as with medical counsel, prudent enough to amaze many an\r\nexperienced physician. Nor has Frau von Bismarck denied herself such a\r\nsphere of helpful activity in her town life. Like a true woman, she has\r\nforgotten her own sorrows to take care of the humblest persons around\r\nher, and thus she has ever been a true helpmate for her consort in heavy\r\nlabors and in dark hours. Frau von Bismarck possesses a fine ear for\r\nmusic. Her passionate performance has often delighted and soothed her\r\nhusband amidst his cares, when the storms of life assailed him, and the\r\nwaves ran high. How often has he sat still at night and listened to her\r\nmelody, receiving the mighty influence of music into his heart of hearts!\r\n\r\nOn his journey from Reinfeld to St. Petersburg, in the November of 1859,\r\nBismarck was taken dangerously ill at the house of his friend Alexander\r\nvon Below, a Member of the Upper House, at Hohendorf in Prussia,\r\nbeyond Elbing. The next station on the Eastern Railroad is Güldenboden\r\n(Goldbottom), which gives some conclusion as to the prolificacy of the\r\nHohendorf district and agricultural system. After his illness there was\r\na long period of reconvalescence, but Bismarck was comforted by having\r\nall his dear ones at hand. Herr von Below and his excellent sister,\r\nMademoiselle Jeannette von Below, evinced princely hospitality. Besides\r\nBismarck, his wife and children, his father and mother-in-law, Herr and\r\nFrau von Putkammer, remained for weeks at Hohendorf, together with Miss\r\nFatio, the friendly home-spirit of the Bismarck family, and the boy’s\r\ntutor, Candidate Braune, now preacher at Strausberg-on-the-Barnim.\r\n\r\nOn the recovery of his health, Bismarck went, in March, 1860, to Berlin,\r\nwhere he took part in the Sessions of the Upper House; in May he returned\r\nto Hohendorf, whence he conducted his family to St. Petersburg. They\r\nstarted for Königsberg on the 30th May, slept at Marienpol on the 31st,\r\nat Wilkomierz on the 1st June, on the 2d at Dünaburg, on the 3d at\r\nBegitza, and on the morning of the 5th the travellers arrived in St.\r\nPetersburg. The railway was not completed at the time, so that some\r\nportion of the journey between the frontier and Dünaburg was performed in\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nBismarck had hired the house of Countess Stenbock, on the English Quay,\r\nwith a fine view of the Neva, the quarter of Wassili Ostrov, and the\r\nNicholas Bridge. When Bismarck had his family about him, he felt at home\r\non the Neva. He also took a special master, in order to learn the Russian\r\nlanguage; and it is said to have very much pleased and astonished the\r\nEmperor Alexander when Bismarck first answered him in Russian. It is\r\nno trifling task to learn Russian; we know persons who have frequently\r\nattempted to do so, but have always abandoned the task in despair.\r\nBismarck was much in society, at the Court of the witty Archduchess\r\nHelena. There was no lack of sporting parties; he hunted the elk, the\r\nbear, and the wolf. At Varzin, as at Berlin, may be seen many trophies of\r\nhis skill from the North. These bear-hunts were very contributive to his\r\nconvalescence, and he warded off many a cold on these expeditions, in the\r\nbitter weather. Bismarck, who was always a friend to dumb animals, had\r\nmuch amusement in some young cubs he kept in the house, until they grew\r\ninto the ornaments of the Zoological Gardens at Frankfurt and Cologne, at\r\na later age. Mischka (such is the Russian name of the young bear) often\r\nmade his appearance, as did the foxes at Kniephof, to the great amusement\r\nof the guests at the dinner-table; and walked about among the plates and\r\nglasses on the cloth, nipped the servant in the calf of the leg, or slid\r\nabout on the slide in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nDuring this Petersburg time, Bismarck was able to devote himself more\r\nfully to the education of his children. Every Saturday they appeared\r\nbefore their father with their exercise-books, and reported what progress\r\nthey had made during the week. Then followed a short examination, which\r\nevinced his minute accuracy in scholastic teaching, and even the tutor\r\nwho was present learned something—the method of education. In later years\r\nBismarck has been unable to spare time for such examinations, the duties\r\nof his office having entirely absorbed him.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen who then frequented the house of Bismarck, we will\r\nmention, the then Royal Prussian Commissioner, Freiherr von Loën (now\r\nGeneral); Captain von Erkert (now Colonel); the historian Legation\r\nCouncillor von Schloezer; the Prince von Croy and his old friend, Count\r\nvon Kaiserling; Baron Nolde; and Count Yxkull. In the aristocratic\r\ncircles of Russian society Bismarck was very greatly prized and esteemed,\r\nand this not alone on account of the favor accorded to him and his wife\r\nby the Imperial family. The Chancellor, Prince Gortschakoff, at all\r\ntimes regarded him with the greatest interest, and stood in continued\r\nand agreeable relations with him. Bismarck’s sporting skill and fortune\r\nbecame almost proverbial in the Court circles of Petersburg. From an\r\nauthentic, although Suabian, source, the following anecdote was related\r\nto us, how Bismarck and seven others went a bear-hunting:—“On their\r\nreturn, one of the seven was asked, ‘How did things go?’ and he replied,\r\n‘Very ill for us, father. The first bear trotted in; the Prussian fired,\r\nand down fell the bear. Then came the second, and I fired, missed, and\r\nBismarck shot him dead at my very feet. Then came the third bear; Colonel\r\nM. fired twice and missed twice; then the Prussian knocked him over with\r\none barrel. So Bismarck shot all three, and we could get no more. It went\r\nvery ill for us, father!’” Bismarck, in his Russian hunting-coat, high\r\nboots, and big brown juff’s leather cloak, was a magically imposing sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1861, Bismarck spent the most of the summer in\r\nPomerania, and part of it in Baden-Baden, where he was considerably\r\nconsulted by King William in political affairs. In the large coronation\r\npainting by Menzel, he forms a conspicuous and significative object. From\r\nKönigsberg he returned to his post at Petersburg.\r\n\r\nHis outward appearance had much changed: he looked much more like\r\nwhat we see him now. His once rich hair has grown somewhat thin, which\r\nmakes the forehead very prominent; his enormous beard had disappeared\r\nin Frankfurt; the features are very marked, but a humorous smile still\r\nplays about his lips; his eyes retain their fire, and his firm bearing is\r\nstill preserved. In his letters the old hearty spirit still is evident in\r\nall its freshness, nor is good-humor wanting; but sometimes there is a\r\nfeeling of mournfulness, which, although slightly toned, still shows that\r\nhe had not come unwounded from the fierce contest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following letters belong to this period of his career:—\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                           Pskow, 28th March, 1859.\r\n\r\n    Russia lengthened herself out under our wheels, and at each\r\n    station the versts gave birth to young; but we have now run\r\n    into the haven of the railway. From Königsberg we travelled\r\n    for ninety-six hours without intermission; at Kowno we slept\r\n    four hours, and three in Egypt (a station near Dünaberg), I\r\n    think, the day before yesterday. I am now very well, but my\r\n    skin is still burning, as I was outside almost all night, and\r\n    we changed from 1 to 12 degrees of cold, R. The snow was so\r\n    deep that we literally remained sticking with six to eight\r\n    horses, and had to descend. The slippery hills were worse,\r\n    particularly in going down; it took us an hour to go twenty\r\n    paces; the horses fell down four times, and all eight got the\r\n    harness complicated together. Add to this night and wind—a real\r\n    winter journey. It was impossible to sleep in consequence of\r\n    the cold; yet it was better to be in the air. Sleep I shall\r\n    recover. The Niemen was free; but the Wilna, a river you\r\n    scarcely would know, as broad as the Maine—the stream like a\r\n    torrent, with blocks of ice. The Düna was only fordable at one\r\n    place, where we were able to cross, with four hours’ waiting\r\n    and three hours’ labor. The whole region resembles Hither\r\n    Pomerania, without villages, chiefly like the district of\r\n    Bütow and Bohren; some good forests, but the majority like the\r\n    coast of New-Kolpizlow. Many birch woods, morasses for miles,\r\n    the road straight as a line; a post-station at from every 14\r\n    to 22 versts, like Hornskrug, very well arranged, every thing\r\n    to be had, and plenty of warmth—every body very civil, and\r\n    the service punctual. Beyond Dünaberg there was a want of\r\n    horses; at one station near Kowno we waited three hours, and\r\n    then only obtained tired animals. Where the road was good they\r\n    went excellently—at half-mile pace, with our heavy, ponderous\r\n    carriage; but through the heavy parts they could not draw,\r\n    skillful fellows as the postilions were. The common class of\r\n    man pleases me at first sight. It is now six—we have just\r\n    dined. Opposite to me, as I write on the table-cloth, —— is\r\n    sitting, meditatively smoking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                   Petersburg, 19 (31) March, 1859.\r\n\r\n    Since early the day before yesterday, I have been warmly and\r\n    dryly lodged here, in the Hotel Demidoff; but I did not get\r\n    here without great exertion. Scarcely had I left Königsberg,\r\n    eight days ago, than a lively snow storm began, and since then\r\n    I have not seen the natural color of the earth’s surface. At\r\n    Insterburg we began only to make a mile an hour with couriers’\r\n    horses. At Wirballen I found a mail-post carriage, the interior\r\n    of which proved too narrow for my stature; I therefore changed\r\n    places with Engel, and made the whole journey on the outer\r\n    seat, open in front: a narrow bench, with an acute-angled back,\r\n    so that it was impossible to sleep at night, without reckoning\r\n    the temperature, which reached 1.2°. In this condition I\r\n    remained from Wednesday morning early until Monday evening,\r\n    and, except during the first and last nights of railroad, I\r\n    have only slept once for three hours, and once for two hours\r\n    on the post-station sofa. The skin of my face peeled off when\r\n    I arrived. The journey was so long, in consequence of the deep\r\n    snow, which had newly fallen, and the want of a sledge-road;\r\n    several times we were obliged to get out and walk, eight\r\n    horses being unable to drag the carriage forward. The Düna was\r\n    frozen, but about half a mile farther up there was free water,\r\n    by which we passed; the Wilna drifted with ice, the Niemen\r\n    was open. Horses, however, were scarce, as each post required\r\n    eight and ten instead of the usual three and four. I have never\r\n    had less than six, although the carriage was not heavy. The\r\n    guard, postilions, and outriders did their utmost, so that I\r\n    set my face against horse-slaughtering. The icy hills, were the\r\n    greatest obstacle; the four hindmost horses, on one occasion,\r\n    all tumbled over into a tangle—but the outriders on the right\r\n    of the two foremost never stumbled—and hardly had they arisen\r\n    than they went forward, in full career, with the fully-laden\r\n    carriage, down hill and over bridges, at the top of their wind,\r\n    amidst shouting and whipcord. They fell, only at step; but had\r\n    they stumbled amidst the verst-long gallops on any declivity,\r\n    we should have been the real —— of Prince ——! Well! it is over,\r\n    and I enjoy the fun of having passed through it. The Neva here\r\n    is like granite; but since yesterday there has been sunshine\r\n    and thaw. It is well known that the town is handsome; but\r\n    were I to abandon myself to the sentiment of wonder, it would\r\n    arise from the extraordinary animation of the streets; despite\r\n    their width, it requires good drivers to wind their way at a\r\n    proper pace, carriages are so numerous; the sledges disappeared\r\n    yesterday. My commissions were completed the day before\r\n    yesterday; my address for —— was written down the Chancery, as\r\n    I had arrived unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n    _1st April._—On writing this date, it occurs to me that to-day\r\n    is my birthday, the first I ever spent amidst a rattling\r\n    frost—for that has again set in—and, for twelve years, without\r\n    Johanna. Yesterday I had a long audience of the Empress-Mother,\r\n    and was delighted with the aristocratic nobility of the\r\n    venerable lady. To-day I saw the Czar; so that on my birthday\r\n    I enter upon my new functions. The day before yesterday the\r\n    Emperor shot two bears. Unfortunately, it is now all over with\r\n    Petz; he will not allow himself to be attacked, or rarely. The\r\n    new snow has been, as it were, swept away by three days of\r\n    thaw; the whole country is said to be free. Business is just\r\n    beginning. Loving letters to-day from Johanna and the children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                            Moscow, 6th June, 1859.\r\n\r\n    I will try to give you a sign of life, at least, hence, while\r\n    I am awaiting the samovar (tea-urn), and behind me a young\r\n    Russian, red-shirted, is troubling himself with entirely\r\n    fruitless attempts to heat the stove; he sneezes and sighs,\r\n    but it won’t burn. After having recently complained so much of\r\n    the scorching heat, I woke up this morning, between Twer and\r\n    here, and thought I was dreaming when I saw the country, with\r\n    its fresh verdure, covered, far and near, with snow! I never\r\n    wonder at any thing now; so, when I had satisfied myself that\r\n    there was no doubt about it, I turned quickly on the other\r\n    side to sleep and roll on, although the play of colors, green\r\n    and white, was not without their charm in the redness of the\r\n    dawn. I do not know whether it has melted away at Twer, but\r\n    _here_ it is gone, and cold drizzling rain is rattling on the\r\n    green leads of the roofs. Green, truly, is the body-color of\r\n    the Russian. I slept some forty miles out of the hundred to\r\n    this place; but the other sixty miles showed me nothing but\r\n    every shade of green. I did not notice cities and villages, or\r\n    even houses, excepting at the stations; thick-set woods and\r\n    birches cover morass and hill; some fine grass crop between,\r\n    and long meadows. Thus it is for ten—twenty—forty miles. I do\r\n    not remember to have noticed the bramble, and no sand; but\r\n    lonely cows or horses grazing raised an idea that men were\r\n    not far off. Moscow, from above, looks like a sown field—the\r\n    soldiers green, the cupolas green, and I do not doubt that\r\n    the eggs before me were laid by green hens. You probably know\r\n    why I am here; I have asked myself, and immediately received\r\n    the reply that change is the soul of life. The truth of this\r\n    profound remark becomes remarkably intelligible after living\r\n    ten weeks in a sunny hotel apartment, with the aspect of\r\n    paving-stones. Besides, the joys of changing apparel, when\r\n    they repeat themselves frequently, become somewhat deadened;\r\n    I therefore determined to deny them to myself, gave all the\r\n    papers to ——, to Engel my keys, declared that I would return in\r\n    a week to the Stenbock house, and drove to the Moscow terminus.\r\n    This occurred yesterday at noon, and at eight this morning I\r\n    descended at the Hotel de France. I will now visit a pleasant\r\n    friend of earlier days, living some twenty versts off in the\r\n    country; to-morrow evening I shall be here again; Wednesday\r\n    and Thursday I shall devote to the Kremlin and such matters;\r\n    and Friday or Saturday shall sleep in the beds which Engel\r\n    will purchase in the mean time. To harness slowly, and drive\r\n    rapidly, lies in the character of this people; I ordered the\r\n    carriage two hours ago; to every inquiry I have had put at ten\r\n    minutes’ interval, for the last hour and a half, the reply is,\r\n    “Directly!” with stolid, friendly quietness; and so it remains.\r\n    You know my pattern-like patience in waiting, but every thing\r\n    has its bounds: presently we shall dash along, so that carriage\r\n    and horses will break down in these bad roads, and we shall end\r\n    our journey on foot. In the interval I have had three glasses\r\n    of tea, destroyed several eggs, and the requirements of fuel\r\n    have been so fully answered that I feel a desire for fresh air.\r\n    Had I a looking-glass, I should shave from very impatience.\r\n    This city is very spacious, and very strange, with its churches\r\n    with green roofs and innumerable cupolas; far different from\r\n    Amsterdam, although both are the most original cities I have\r\n    ever seen. The amount of luggage brought here in the coupée\r\n    no German conductor could divine. No Russian travels without\r\n    two pillows, children in baskets, and masses of provisions of\r\n    every kind. From politeness, I was complimented with a sleeping\r\n    coupée, where I was worse situated than in my arm-chair. I am\r\n    really astonished at making a journey under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Archangelski, late in the evening.\r\n\r\n    A year ago this very day I never even dreamt that I should\r\n    be sitting here. On the river by which Moscow stands, some\r\n    three miles away, amidst spacious gardens, lies a mansion\r\n    in the Italian style. In front there is a broad, terraced,\r\n    sloping lawn, surrounded by hedges like those of Schönbrunn,\r\n    to the river side, and to the left of it a pavilion, in the\r\n    six rooms of which I wander alone. On the other side of the\r\n    water is a broad moonlit plain; here, grass-plats, hedges,\r\n    and orangeries. The wind howls, and the flame flickers in\r\n    the stove; old pictures look in a ghostly manner at me from\r\n    the walls, and white marble statues from without. I return\r\n    to-morrow, with my host, to Moscow; the day after to-morrow,\r\n    by way of St. Petersburg, to Berlin. I shall remain, if it be\r\n    the will of God, until Friday, to “see what is to be seen.” My\r\n    pen is very bad. I shall go to bed, though it looks broad and\r\n    cold. Good-night. God be with you, and all those sheltered by\r\n    Reinfeld!\r\n\r\n    _The 7th._—Despite the broad cold bed, I slept well—had a\r\n    capital fire made up, and am looking over the steaming tea-urn\r\n    out to the somewhat clearer, but still grayish, horizon, and\r\n    into the entirely green surroundings of my pavilion. It is a\r\n    pleasant spot of earth, and I have the comfortable feeling\r\n    that I am beyond the reach of telegraphs. My servant, like\r\n    a true Russian, has, as I perceive, slept in my antechamber\r\n    on a silken divan, and this would seem to be a domestic\r\n    arrangement, servants not being provided with special sleeping\r\n    accommodation. My pavilion has an orangery, now empty, attached\r\n    to it, about 150 feet long, at the least—the winter inhabitants\r\n    of which are at present planted out in the hedges in stately\r\n    grandeur. The whole with its appurtenances is something like\r\n    a very magnified —— with rococo appendices in the way of\r\n    furniture, hedges, terraces, and statues. I am now going out\r\n    walking.\r\n\r\n    _Moscow, 8th June._—The city, as a city, is certainly the\r\n    handsomest and most original in existence; the environs are\r\n    friendly, neither pretty nor ugly; but the prospect above from\r\n    the Kremlin, over the surrounding houses, with green roofs,\r\n    gardens, churches, towers of the most extraordinary shapes\r\n    and colors—most of them green, red, or bright blue, usually\r\n    crowned by a gigantic golden ball, many with five or more on a\r\n    church, unquestionably a thousand towers—something so curiously\r\n    beautiful, as it appears in the setting sun, can not be seen\r\n    elsewhere. The weather is again clear, and I should remain\r\n    here some days longer, had there not arisen rumors of a great\r\n    battle in Italy which may lead to diplomatic work; so I will\r\n    make haste to be at my post. The house in which I write is very\r\n    remarkable, as being one of the few remaining from 1812, with\r\n    ancient thick walls like those of Schönhausen, of Oriental\r\n    architecture—great Moorish courts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                         Peterhof, 28th June, 1859.\r\n\r\n    By the preceding date, you can see I am again up. I drove\r\n    here early, to take leave of the Empress-Mother, who sails\r\n    to-morrow. Her charming sincerity has truly for me something\r\n    of a character of maternity, and I can explain myself to her\r\n    as if I had known her from a child. She conversed with me\r\n    to-day for a long time on many subjects; she was lying in a\r\n    _chaise-longue_, dressed in black, knitting at a white and red\r\n    woollen shawl with long needles, on the balcony looking to the\r\n    country. I could have listened to her deep voice and honest\r\n    laugh and scolding for many an hour longer, I felt so at home.\r\n    I had only come for two hours in undress; but as she finally\r\n    said she did not wish to say farewell, but that I must have a\r\n    great deal to do, I assured her nothing at all, and then she\r\n    said, “You had better remain till to-morrow, when I leave.”\r\n    I accepted the invitation joyfully as a command, for here it\r\n    is delightful, and in Petersburg so stony. Only imagine the\r\n    heights of Oliva and Zoppot all laid out as parks; with a dozen\r\n    palaces having terraces, fountains, and lakes between, with\r\n    shady walks and lawns down to the sea-line, blue sky, and warm\r\n    sun with white clouds, and beyond the green ocean of foliage,\r\n    the real blue sea with ships and seagulls. I have not enjoyed\r\n    any thing so much for a long time. In a few hours the Emperor\r\n    and Gortschakow will be here, and then some business will\r\n    penetrate the idyl; but, God be thanked, the world seems more\r\n    peaceful despite our mobilization, and I need make myself less\r\n    anxious at certain conclusions. I am sorry for the Austrian\r\n    soldiers; how can they be commanded, that they are always\r\n    beaten? On the twenty-fourth again. It is a lesson for the\r\n    ministers, which, in their stupidity, they will still not take\r\n    to heart. I should fear France rather than Austria from the\r\n    moment we took up arms.\r\n\r\n    _28th, Evening._—After a drive for three hours in an open\r\n    carriage through the gardens, and having seen all their\r\n    beauties _seriatim_, I am drinking tea and looking at the\r\n    golden evening sky and green woods. The Imperial family desired\r\n    last night to be alone, for which I can not blame them, and\r\n    as a reconvalescent I sought solitude, and quite enough of\r\n    it for this trip. I smoke my cigar in peace, drink excellent\r\n    tea, and through the smoke of both gaze at a sunset of rare\r\n    magnificence. The inclosed jasmine I send you as a proof that\r\n    it really does grow in the open air and blossoms here. On the\r\n    other hand, I must confess that I was shown the common chestnut\r\n    in espalier as a rare plant, wrapped up in the winter. But\r\n    there are very fine oaks, ashes, limes, poplars, and birches as\r\n    thick as oaks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                         Peterhof, 29th June, 1859.\r\n\r\n    I wished to send you my good wishes in a pair of slippers by\r\n    the steamer of the 25th, so that you would have received them\r\n    this very day, but I could not even do it the week before,\r\n    I lay so exhausted on my back. Since January in Berlin I\r\n    have never been quite well, and anxiety, climate, and colds\r\n    increased my originally unimportant rheumatism to such a pitch\r\n    some ten days since, that I could not breathe without very\r\n    great pain. The complaint, rheumatico-gastric-nervous, had\r\n    settled in the liver, and was attacked by large cupping-glasses\r\n    like saucers, and cantharides and mustard everywhere, until\r\n    I succeeded, after having been half won for a better world,\r\n    in convincing the physicians that my nerves, by eight years\r\n    of uninterrupted anxiety and continual excitement, had been\r\n    weakened, and that more tapping of blood would lead to typhus\r\n    or idiocy. A week ago yesterday was the worst, but my good\r\n    constitution soon came to my rescue, after moderate quantities\r\n    of canary were ordered. I came hither yesterday—my first\r\n    trip—to take leave of the Empress-Mother, who is goodness\r\n    itself towards me, and at her desire I have remained here\r\n    till her departure, which takes place to-day about noon, to\r\n    enjoy myself with green and sea and country air after all my\r\n    sufferings. Do not write to Johanna about these details of\r\n    sickness; I will tell her myself; I have till now only told her\r\n    of ordinary witchcraft. As soon as I am at rest I will write\r\n    especially to Oscar; I was deeply touched by his long letter,\r\n    and should have replied long since, but before my illness I was\r\n    for a week in the neighborhood of Moscow, and the conduct of\r\n    much business is doubly difficult by the presence of the Court\r\n    and Ministers in Zarskoe-Selo. I hope to obtain my furlough\r\n    in the first third of July, and shall then go to Berlin, and I\r\n    hope by Kröchlendorf to Pomerania.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                         Petersburg, 2d July, 1859.\r\n\r\n    Half an hour ago a courier awakened me with tidings of war and\r\n    peace. Our politics are sliding more and more into the Austrian\r\n    groove, and if we fire one shot on the Rhine the Italo-Austrian\r\n    war is over; and in place of it we shall see a Prusso-French\r\n    war, in which Austria, after we have taken the load from her\r\n    shoulders, will assist, or assist so far as her own interests\r\n    are concerned. That we should play a very victorious part is\r\n    scarcely to be conceded. Be it as God wills! it is here below\r\n    always a question of time; nations and men, folly and wisdom,\r\n    war and peace, they come like waves and so depart, while the\r\n    ocean remains! On this earth there is nothing but hypocrisy\r\n    and jugglery, and whether this mask of flesh is to be torn\r\n    off by fever or a cartridge, it must fall at last, and then\r\n    the difference between a Prussian and an Austrian, if of the\r\n    same stature, will be so small that it will be difficult to\r\n    distinguish between them. Fools and wise men, as skeletons,\r\n    look very much like one another; specific patriotism we thus\r\n    lose, but it would be desperate if we carried it into eternity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                              Saturday, Petersburg.\r\n\r\n    Until half-past three this morning I was engaged in writing.\r\n    The sun then rose, and I went to bed, and have been at the\r\n    ink-bottle from before nine again; in half an hour the steamer\r\n    starts; —— is behind me. For three days together I have been\r\n    obliged to go to Zarskoe-Selo, always taking up the whole\r\n    day. I dined with the Emperor recently, in the clothes of\r\n    four different people, not being prepared for dress; I must\r\n    have looked very odd. Here people are very good to me; but in\r\n    Berlin, Austria and all our dear allies are intriguing to get\r\n    me away; and yet I am such a well-behaved person! Be it as God\r\n    wills! I had as lief live in the country as not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                          Berlin, 14th Sept., 1859.\r\n\r\n    Forgive me for not answering your letter as yet. I thought\r\n    I should be able to stay a few days longer at Reinfeld, but\r\n    was yesterday suddenly telegraphed for. Formerly it took\r\n    twenty-eight hours to reach here, but since the railway has\r\n    been opened it takes thirty-two, and one has to get up at\r\n    four o’clock. I have just arrived here at six o’clock, have\r\n    satisfied my appetite, and now propose to sleep. I am to\r\n    receive the Regent very early to-morrow morning at the station;\r\n    thence probably to Potsdam, to receive letters and commissions;\r\n    to-morrow evening off to Warsaw. I shall very likely return\r\n    with the Emperor to Breslau, and thence come back here; perhaps\r\n    we shall then be able to see each other for one day at last. A\r\n    fourteen-seated carriage arrives at Tauroggen for me to-day;\r\n    how long it will remain there Heaven knows—this vagabondizing\r\n    in the autumn chills ending in the goal of winter is far from\r\n    amusing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                          Berlin, 24th Sept., 1859.\r\n\r\n    After I learnt from —— that you had passed through Berlin,\r\n    and had probably reached Kröchlendorf again, I made enormous\r\n    exertions to be free by six to-morrow morning and reach\r\n    Stettin to-morrow night by way of Kröchlendorf. After having\r\n    talked myself hoarse with mechanics and statesmen, I have\r\n    become almost idiotic with anxiety, hunger, and business. I\r\n    now at eleven o’clock do not know how to write either a short\r\n    or simple letter to —— on the business of the day; to rise\r\n    to-morrow at half-past five, and commit some financial and\r\n    legal matters to paper. _Je suis au bout de mes forces_ and\r\n    must sleep, painful as it is to me to be compelled to dispense\r\n    with my intended surprise for you to-morrow. I have already\r\n    torn up two letters to Baden I had commenced. I can not keep my\r\n    thoughts fixed to the political cothurnus, and must defer my\r\n    journey to Stettin till to-morrow night. There I shall sleep.\r\n    The day after to-morrow I have to meet Bernhard at Freienwalde;\r\n    he will accompany me as far as Labes, where the trains join; at\r\n    night I shall sleep at Reddentin, and early on the 27th I start\r\n    for Reinfeld, or Johanna will scratch my eyes out. It is her\r\n    father’s birthday, and horses are already ordered. If I thought\r\n    this letter would reach you in time, I should try to persuade\r\n    you to go to Reinfeld at the same time, but you would be worn\r\n    out with the journey. I have greatly recovered, particularly\r\n    during the fortnight at Baden. My left leg is still weak and\r\n    swollen from walking, my nerves not yet recovered from the\r\n    iodine. I still sleep badly, and after the many people and\r\n    things I have seen and spoken to to-day, I am tired and angry;\r\n    I do not know what at, but I have very different ideas to those\r\n    of six weeks ago, when I cared little for living longer, and\r\n    the people who then saw me here say that they did not believe\r\n    to have had that pleasure to-day. Every Prussian ambassador\r\n    dies or goes mad, says ——, with a look which vouches for the\r\n    truth of his words. Other people, however, do the same. I hope\r\n    to remain a fortnight at Reinfeld, and then leave for the\r\n    North. It is possible that I may be called back here after the\r\n    Regent’s return, and my journey may be delayed by that of the\r\n    Emperor. In any case it will be a winter journey; in Petersburg\r\n    there is already snow and two degrees of frost. I can not even\r\n    wish for another post, as according to medical advice I am to\r\n    be lazy—and that is only possible at Petersburg—unless I desire\r\n    to resign altogether. I shall wrap myself in bear-skins and be\r\n    snowed up, and see what remains of me and mine next May in the\r\n    thaw. If there are too few I shall return to agriculture and\r\n    close with politics, as Gischberg does in his fourth picture.\r\n    It would be very pleasant, however, if we could see each other\r\n    before the winter sleep; should I return in a fortnight this\r\n    would be easy, otherwise we must seek other means, visit Danzig\r\n    or the Gollenberg together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                         Lazienki, 17th Oct., 1859.\r\n\r\n    So far have they got me! Early this morning I sought in the\r\n    first Polish station for the ticket-office to take my place as\r\n    far as here, when suddenly a benevolent Fate, in the shape of a\r\n    white-bearded Russian General, seized me; this angel is named\r\n    P., and before I recovered consciousness, my pass was recovered\r\n    from the police, my luggage from the custom-house officer,\r\n    and I was transplanted from the luggage-train to the express,\r\n    seated in one of the Imperial saloon carriages, over a cigar,\r\n    with this agreeable gentleman, and, after a good dinner at\r\n    Petorkan, arrived at the station here, where I was parted\r\n    from Alexander and luggage by the golden throng. My carriage\r\n    was ready, and my questions, shouted in various languages, as\r\n    to where I was to stay, were lost in the carriage roll, with\r\n    which two fine horses galloped me into the night. For some\r\n    half an hour I was rolling in mad haste through the darkness,\r\n    and now am sitting here in uniform with my orders on, which\r\n    we all donned at the last station. Tea is beside me, a mirror\r\n    before me, and I know no more than that I am in the Pavilion of\r\n    Stanislaus August in Lazienki, but not where it is situated,\r\n    and I live in hopes that Alexander will soon find traces of me\r\n    in more comfortable attire. By the noise there should be tall\r\n    trees or a fountain in front of the windows; except many people\r\n    in Court liveries, I do not discover any one. The Emperor\r\n    reaches Breslau early on the 23d, remains there a week, and\r\n    then, after two days, I shall be with you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                         Lazienki, 19th Oct., 1859.\r\n\r\n    I can only tell you in so many words that I am well. Yesterday\r\n    I was the whole day _en grandeur_; breakfasted with the\r\n    Emperor, then an audience, was very graciously and kindly\r\n    received; dinner with H. I. M.; theatre in the evening, a very\r\n    good ballet, and the boxes filled with handsome ladies. I have\r\n    slept excellently; tea is on the table, and when I have taken\r\n    it I am going to drive out. The Emperor reaches Breslau early\r\n    on the 23d; on the morning of the 25th we shall probably start\r\n    for Berlin. The tea I mentioned consisted not only of tea,\r\n    but of coffee, six eggs, three kinds of meat, biscuits, and a\r\n    bottle of Bordeaux; and from the breach I made this morning you\r\n    would see that the journey has not hurt me. The wind is rushing\r\n    over the Vistula, and rages among the chestnuts and limes\r\n    surrounding me, whirling the yellow leaves against the windows;\r\n    but here inside, with double windows, tea, and thoughts of\r\n    you and the children, I smoke my cigar in great comfort.\r\n    Unfortunately all comfort in this world has its bounds, and\r\n    I am only awaiting the end of the breakfast of those in the\r\n    antechamber (I hear Alexander’s voice calling out loudly for\r\n    a corkscrew!) to jump into the carriage, and first drive to\r\n    several castles and mansions, and then into the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                         Lazienki, 21st Oct., 1859.\r\n\r\n    I shall only just give you a sign of life this morning, for\r\n    I have slept too long. Yesterday there was a grand dinner, a\r\n    water and forest illumination which transcended every thing I\r\n    had ever seen of the kind, and a ballet with mazurka. Whatever\r\n    can be done is done, and for gay people this is Abraham’s\r\n    bosom. I should enjoy this more had I any news of you. You\r\n    have, no doubt, in the uncertainty of my journey, not ventured\r\n    to write to me here, or the letter is delayed. To-morrow\r\n    about nine we go to Skianiawicze, where there is to be a\r\n    hunting-party in the park; in the evening on to Breslau. With\r\n    God’s assistance this day week I shall be in Reinfeld, and\r\n    shall, I hope, find you and the little ones in good health,\r\n    and ready to travel. I long for the moment when we shall sit\r\n    quietly at the tea-table in our winter quarters, be the Neva as\r\n    frozen as it may.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                     Skianiawicze, 22d Oct., 9 P.M.\r\n\r\n    For five hours I have shot deer, hunted four hares, rode for\r\n    three hours—every thing went off well. We are just getting into\r\n    the coupé for Breslau, where we shall be early to-morrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                   Peterhof, 1st (13th) July, 1860.\r\n\r\n    As in former times, during the sessions of the Diet, I can find\r\n    no pleasanter employment for a leisure moment than to write\r\n    you a line as to the state of my health. Under the impression\r\n    that at eight o’clock a steamer left for Petersburg, I remained\r\n    at table till half-past six—just long enough to be detained\r\n    till ten. The plan is altered to-day; instead of eight, they\r\n    start at half-past six and ten. But it is very pleasant here.\r\n    There is charming weather to day; a fine view of the green and\r\n    the sea from a well-arranged corner room of the palace; music\r\n    in honor of the birthday of the Empress-Mother; and a good\r\n    carriage, in which I shall take a drive for an hour. Peterhof\r\n    is the jewel of this neighborhood, and delightful also for a\r\n    west European, both as a park and landscape—something like the\r\n    neighborhood of Danzig and Zoppot, of which you naturally know\r\n    nothing, nor of Rügen; the latter is in the same style, but\r\n    prettier. My health is unexpectedly good since I have lived in\r\n    my own house. Your kindness in Berlin to some extent replaced\r\n    this want; but the green hotel saloon, and the provisional\r\n    character of my existence, still somewhat oppresses my memory.\r\n    I feel like an old pensioner who has done with the business\r\n    of this world, or like a formerly ambitious soldier, who has\r\n    reached the haven of a comfortable command; and I feel that\r\n    I could travel towards my end through long contented years.\r\n    Till twelve I am employed with the Carlsbaders, walking,\r\n    breakfast, dressing; from then till five official life gives\r\n    me just enough regular work to feel that I am not superfluous\r\n    in the world. Dinner I enjoy perfectly, particularly such\r\n    things as I ought not to eat. From eight to ten I ride, also\r\n    _par ordonnance du médecin_, and then read the newspapers and\r\n    dispatches—enjoying some peaches the while—till twelve. I shall\r\n    be able to endure this for a long time, provided I succeed in\r\n    retaining the position of an observant natural philosopher in\r\n    our politics. Yesterday Johanna made her first appearance in\r\n    society. As I had to be in bed by twelve, and no one comes till\r\n    eleven, it did not last long. My health is a welcome excuse\r\n    for keeping out of all company. I dined here to-day. Such are\r\n    the only irregularities that have taken place since my first\r\n    reception at Court. The Emperor was very hearty on seeing me\r\n    again, embraced me, and evinced an unquestionably sincere\r\n    pleasure at my return. Johanna finds the life far pleasanter\r\n    than she expected. Some slight cold somewhat upset her a few\r\n    days since, but thank God all is right again, as with your\r\n    Marie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                      Zarskoe-Selo, 4th Oct., 1860.\r\n\r\n    I must be withdrawn from the clock-work of business, and by\r\n    imperial command obtain an hour of leisure, to take thought\r\n    and write to you. My daily life is taken up from the hour of\r\n    breakfast until four without rest—work of all kinds, on paper\r\n    and among men. I then ride till six; but after dinner, by\r\n    order of the physician, I approach the ink-bottle with caution,\r\n    and only under extreme necessity. On the other hand, I read\r\n    every thing which has arrived in dispatches and newspapers, and\r\n    retire to rest about midnight, generally in good spirits, and\r\n    in a contemplative mood as to the singular demands the Prussian\r\n    in Russia makes upon his ambassador. Before sinking to sleep,\r\n    I think of the best of sisters; but to write to this angel\r\n    is only possible when I am sent for to an audience at one,\r\n    and I have to take the railway for that purpose about nine.\r\n    I thus have two hours remaining, during which I am quartered\r\n    in the vacant rooms of the handsomest of all grandmothers,\r\n    the Princess ——, where I write to you and smoke paper cigars\r\n    until a visit or breakfast disturbs me. I look from the table,\r\n    down hill, over birches and planes, where red and yellow are\r\n    already predominating over green leaves. Behind them are the\r\n    grass-green roofs of the village, over which, to the left, a\r\n    church stands, with five golden towers in the shape of onions;\r\n    and the whole is framed in on the horizon by the endless\r\n    bushes, meadows, and forest plains, behind whose brown-grayish\r\n    blue shadows a telescope would show the Isaac’s Church in\r\n    Petersburg. A characteristic landscape, but under the cold gray\r\n    sky more than autumnal—at any rate, a very northern autumn\r\n    landscape. Yesterday the young Archduke Paul was born, and in\r\n    a week the long delayed journey to Warsaw will be commenced. I\r\n    hope to remain here; at least, I have written that I did not\r\n    consider the custom of a reception on the frontier necessary,\r\n    and should only come if specially commanded. I feel, thank God,\r\n    much better than in the spring; but I do not trust in my health\r\n    so entirely, and the Court life there, with diurnal balls until\r\n    three o’clock, and all its restlessness, will be a severe trial\r\n    even for people in perfect health. After my many journeys since\r\n    the beginning of 1859, the feeling of really living anywhere\r\n    with my own family is so beneficial that I am loath to tear\r\n    myself away from domesticity. I should like to remain, like\r\n    the badger, in my lair, at least until summer returns. Johanna\r\n    and the children, thank God, are well, although Bill gave us\r\n    some anxiety for a time, as Johanna will have informed you. The\r\n    tutor and Josephine, the nurse, are, however, in bed. Quite\r\n    without sickness we never are, and the doctor is a daily\r\n    guest. God grant that all sufferings are at an end in your\r\n    house! The Chamberlain is just announced, and I do not know\r\n    whether I shall be able to finish these lines here, or the day\r\n    after to-morrow in Petersburg, when the Eagle sails, having\r\n    many dispatches to write till then.\r\n\r\n    _Petersburg, 12th Oct._—On taking up my letter-case, among my\r\n    preparations for departure I found the foregoing, of which I\r\n    was guilty at Zarskoe-Selo, and will not withhold it from you.\r\n    Since then I have been ordered to go to Warsaw, and obey with\r\n    somewhat of a heavy heart, after having somewhat evasively\r\n    declined an invitation of the Emperor’s to that place. I am\r\n    well enough for business, but not for pleasure. When you read\r\n    this, probably on Wednesday, I shall, if God will, already be\r\n    in Berlin. On Thursday I leave for Warsaw, and thence, by way\r\n    of Wilna, hither. I shall not therefore have the pleasure of\r\n    seeing you, unless by chance you should be in Berlin. I hope to\r\n    do so next summer. The sea voyage will not be comfortable, but\r\n    the land journey is too monotonous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                        Petersburg, 9th Dec., 1860.\r\n\r\n    I take it for granted that you are already in Berlin, as\r\n    I do not know what you could do in the long evenings at\r\n    Kröchlendorf, although they are not so long as here, where\r\n    lights are now brought punctually at three o’clock, to see\r\n    to read and write. On some of our foggy days it is hardly\r\n    possible, despite of the double windows and distance from the\r\n    cold, to enter upon such pursuits after noon. But I can not say\r\n    that my evenings or nights are too long; my anger at the swift\r\n    progress of time is as great in the evening when I go to bed,\r\n    or in the morning when I rise. I have just now a great deal to\r\n    do; we are not at all social—my means do not permit it. I catch\r\n    cold in other people’s houses, and generally an ambassador with\r\n    30,000 thalers salary is condemned to great economy. I receive\r\n    visitors at dinner, _i.e._, I give them according to _fortune\r\n    de pot_, but no evening parties. Evening parties, theatres, and\r\n    so forth, are interdicted by the mourning carriages; coachmen,\r\n    jägers, are all dressed in black. I have been out hunting once,\r\n    but found the wolves wiser than the huntsmen; I was glad,\r\n    however, to be able to do so once more. The cold is not very\r\n    intense; three, five, seven, seldom eleven degrees of frost;\r\n    there has been good sledging for some weeks.\r\n\r\n    I am in the midst of Christmas plagues, and find nothing for\r\n    Johanna that is not too dear. Please buy her some twelve or\r\n    twenty pearls at Friedberg’s, suitable for her necklace, _i.e._\r\n    for the largest; say about 300 thalers. I should also like some\r\n    picture-books, in Schneider’s Library; if you are unable to get\r\n    them, ask —— to do so. I should like “Düsseldorf Magazines”\r\n    of last year, “Düsseldorf Art Albums” of last and this year,\r\n    München _Fliegender Blätter_ of last year, and München\r\n    _Bilderbogen_ of this year and the last; also Kladderdatsch\r\n    Almanac, and such nonsense.\r\n\r\n    Please get all this as soon as you can, and send it me by the\r\n    aid of Harry with the next dispatch-bag—also the pearls, so\r\n    that they may be here by Christmas; a courier will probably\r\n    start before then. Put a few boxes of confections with them,\r\n    but not too many, for the children are in a customary state of\r\n    digestion without them.\r\n\r\n    The death of old Bellin makes a breach at Schönhausen, and\r\n    puts me into some doubt as to my arrangements there. I do not\r\n    know whether the widow will remain in the mansion, or whether\r\n    she will prefer her little cottage—the ice-house—which the old\r\n    man arranged for her. The garden I shall have to resign to the\r\n    farmer, but will reserve a right of resumption by a notice from\r\n    year to year, should I return thither. The accounts I must give\r\n    to my attorney; I do not know any one there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                   Petersburg, 26 (14) March, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I first congratulate you on my birthday; this disinterested\r\n    step, however, is not the only reason of the unusual appearance\r\n    of an autograph letter from me. You know that on the 11th\r\n    April the basis of my domestic bliss was born; it is not,\r\n    however, as well known to you that I signified my delight at\r\n    the return of this day last year by the present of a pair of\r\n    earrings, brilliants, purchased of Wagner Unter von Linden,\r\n    and that they have recently disappeared from the possession\r\n    of the charming owner, and have probably been stolen. In\r\n    order to soften the sorrow of this loss, I should be glad\r\n    to receive by the 11th—there is sure to be a courier or some\r\n    other traveller before that time—a pair of similar decorations\r\n    of the conjugal earshells. Wagner will know about what they\r\n    were and cost; if possible I should like them similar; a\r\n    simple setting like your own, and they may be a little dearer\r\n    than those of last year. The equality of my budget can not be\r\n    maintained, whether the deficit be a hundred thalers more or\r\n    less. I must await the restoration of my finances, when I take\r\n    wife and children to Pomerania, and send the horses to grass\r\n    in Ingermanland in the summer. Experience alone can tell how\r\n    great the saving will be by such an operation. Should it prove\r\n    insufficient, I shall next year leave my very pleasant house,\r\n    and put myself on a Saxo-Bavaro-Würtemberg footing, until my\r\n    salary is raised, or the leisure of private life is restored\r\n    me. Otherwise I have grown friendly with the existence here,\r\n    do not find the winter so bad as I thought, and require no\r\n    change in my position, until, if it be God’s will, I can sit\r\n    down in peace at Schönhausen or Reinfeld, to have my coffin\r\n    made without undue haste. The ambition to be a minister dies\r\n    away nowadays from a multitude of causes, not all fitted for\r\n    epistolary communication; in Paris or in London I should live\r\n    less pleasantly than here, and have no more to say; and a\r\n    removal is half a death. The protection of two hundred thousand\r\n    vagabondizing Prussians, one-third of whom live in Russia,\r\n    and two-thirds of whom visit it annually, gives me enough to\r\n    do not to get bored. My wife and children endure the climate\r\n    very well; there is a certain number of people with whom I\r\n    associate; now and then I shoot a bear or an elk, the latter\r\n    some two hundred versts hence; there is charming sledging; high\r\n    society—whose daily visits are without the slightest advantage\r\n    for the royal service—I avoid, because I can not sleep if I go\r\n    to bed so late. It is impossible to appear much before eleven;\r\n    most people come after twelve, and about two go to a second\r\n    soirée of supper-eating folks. This I am unable yet to endure,\r\n    and perhaps never shall again, and I am not angry at it, as\r\n    the ennui of a rout is more intense here than anywhere else,\r\n    because one has too few circumstances of life and interests in\r\n    common. Johanna goes out often, and answers without annoyance\r\n    all questions about my health, as the necessary manure on\r\n    the unfertile soil of conversation. I wish Johanna, for\r\n    economical reasons, would go to Germany as soon as possible,\r\n    but she will not! I mean to Pomerania, and I would follow\r\n    her as soon and for as long as I can get leave of absence.\r\n    I will take the waters somewhere, and then above all take a\r\n    sea-bath, to get rid again of this intolerable tenderness of\r\n    skin. There is nothing heard from and seen of ——; couriers\r\n    seem to have left off travelling. For months I have had no\r\n    express dispatches from the Ministry, and what come by post are\r\n    tiresome. Farewell, dear heart; greet Oscar. The Neva still\r\n    bears carriages of every kind, although we have had a thaw for\r\n    weeks, so that no sledges can pass in the city, and carriages\r\n    are daily broken in the deep fissures in the ice which covers\r\n    the pavements; it is like driving over a frozen ploughed field.\r\n    You, no doubt, have green leaves about you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO OSCAR VON ARNIM.\r\n\r\n                                       Reinfeld, 16th August, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I have just received the news of the terrible misfortune which\r\n    has befallen you and Malwine. My first thought was to come\r\n    to you instanter, but I had overestimated my strength. The\r\n    cure has commenced, and the thought to break it off suddenly\r\n    was so definitely contradicted, that I determined to let\r\n    Johanna travel alone. Such a blow is beyond the power of human\r\n    consolation; and yet it is a natural desire to be near those\r\n    whom one loves, in sorrow, and to join in their lamentations.\r\n    It is all we can do. A greater sorrow could scarcely have\r\n    befallen you—to lose so charming and joyfully growing child\r\n    in this way, and with it to bury all the hopes which were to\r\n    become the joys of your old age. As to this, mourning can not\r\n    depart from you as long as you live in this world. This I feel\r\n    with you in deeply painful sympathy. We are without counsel,\r\n    and helpless in the mighty hand of God—in so far as He will\r\n    not help us—and can do nothing but bow in humility under His\r\n    behest. He can take away from us all that He gave us, and leave\r\n    us entirely desolate; and our mourning over this would be the\r\n    more bitter the more we rise against the Omnipotent will in\r\n    anger and opposition. Do not mingle bitterness and murmuring\r\n    with your just sorrow, but remember that you still have a son\r\n    and daughter left you, and that you must regard yourself as\r\n    blest with them, and even with the feeling of having possessed\r\n    a beloved child for fifteen years, in comparison with the\r\n    many who have never had children and known paternal joys. I\r\n    will not burden you with weak grounds for comfort, but assure\r\n    you in these lines that as a friend and brother I feel your\r\n    sorrow as my own, and am cut to the heart by it. How do all the\r\n    little cares and troubles which beset our daily lives vanish\r\n    beside the iron advent of real misfortunes! And I feel the\r\n    recollections of all complaints and desires, by which I have\r\n    forgotten how many blessings God gives us, and how much danger\r\n    surrounds us without touching us, as so many reproofs. We\r\n    should not depend on this world, and come to regard it as our\r\n    home. Another twenty or thirty years, under the most favorable\r\n    circumstances, and we shall both have passed from the sorrows\r\n    of this world; our children will have arrived at our present\r\n    position, and will find with astonishment that the life so\r\n    freshly begun is going down hill. Were it all over with us\r\n    so, it would not be worth while dressing and undressing. Do\r\n    not you remember the words of a Stolpmünder fellow-traveller?\r\n    The thought that death is but the passage to another life\r\n    may perhaps diminish your sorrow but little, but you might\r\n    believe that your beloved son would have been a faithful and\r\n    true companion for the time you have yet to live here, and\r\n    would have continued your memory. The circle of those whom we\r\n    love grows narrower and receives no increase until we have\r\n    grandchildren. At our years we make no new connections which\r\n    can replace those who have died away. Let us therefore hold\r\n    each other closer in affection, until death parts us also, as\r\n    your son is now parted from us. Who can tell how soon! Will you\r\n    not come with Malle to Stolpmünde, and live quietly with us for\r\n    a few weeks or days? In any case I shall come in three or four\r\n    weeks to you to Kröchlendorf, or wherever you may be. I greet\r\n    my beloved Malle from my heart. May God grant her, as also\r\n    yourself, strength to endure and patient resignation!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                     Petersburg, 17 (5) Jan., 1862.\r\n\r\n    I wished last night to go shooting some fifteen miles hence on\r\n    the road to ——, where some wild quadrupeds, already purchased\r\n    by me, are awaiting me. I therefore wrote in great haste all\r\n    that to-day’s courier was to take with him. Brotherly love\r\n    in this case, however, would have suffered. Then it grew so\r\n    cold again that the nocturnal sledging would have put my\r\n    nose in a dilemma, and the chase would have been cruel for\r\n    the beaters. I therefore gave it up, and won a little time\r\n    to write you a few loving words—especially to thank you for\r\n    your excellent purchases and letters. The dress is everywhere\r\n    admired; and in the little brooch also your good taste has\r\n    evinced itself. Christmas, with God’s grace, has passed\r\n    away from us in quietness and content, and Marie is making\r\n    satisfactory progress. It would, therefore, be unthankful to\r\n    complain of the cold, which has remained fixed at 18° to 28°\r\n    with a persistency remarkable even for Russia, which would\r\n    give 22° to 32° for the little hills to the south-west, where\r\n    I usually shoot. For fourteen days the temperature has never\r\n    been less than 18°. Usually, it is seldom longer than thirty\r\n    hours consecutively over 20°. The houses are so frozen that no\r\n    fires are of any use. To-day it is 24° at the window in the\r\n    sun; a bright sun and blue sky. You write in your last letter\r\n    of imprudent words spoken by ——, in Berlin. Tact he has not,\r\n    and never will have; but that he is intentionally my enemy I\r\n    do not consider. Nor does any thing take place here that every\r\n    body might not know. If I were disposed to continue my career,\r\n    it might perhaps be the very best thing if a great deal were\r\n    heard to my disadvantage, for then I should, at least, get\r\n    back to Frankfurt; or if I were very idle and pretentious for\r\n    eight years, that would do. This is far too late a thing for\r\n    me; I shall therefore continue to do my duty. Since my illness\r\n    I have become so mentally weak, that the energy for exciting\r\n    circumstances is deficient. Three years ago, I might still have\r\n    been a useful minister, but now I regard myself, mentally, as\r\n    a sick circus-rider. I must remain in the service some years,\r\n    if ever I am to see it. In three years the Kniephof lease\r\n    will be out, in four years that of Schönhausen: until then\r\n    I should not know exactly where to live, if I resigned. The\r\n    present revision of posts leaves me out in the cold. I have\r\n    a superstitious dread of expressing any wish about it, and\r\n    afterwards to regret it by experience. I should go to Paris\r\n    or London without sorrow, without joy, or remain here, as God\r\n    and His Majesty please; the cabbage will grow no fatter for\r\n    our policy, nor for me, whichever should happen. Johanna\r\n    wishes for Paris, because she thinks the climate would suit\r\n    the children better. Sickness happens everywhere, and so does\r\n    misfortune; with God’s help, one gets over them, or one bends\r\n    in resignation to His will; locality has nothing to do with\r\n    it. To —— I concede any post; he has the material. I should be\r\n    ungrateful to God and man, were I to declare I am badly off\r\n    here, and anxious for a change; but for the Ministry I have\r\n    an absolute fear, as against a cold bath. I would rather go\r\n    to one of those vacant posts, or back to Frankfurt, even to\r\n    Berne, where I lived very well. If I am to leave here, I should\r\n    like to hear of it soon. On the 1 (13) February I must declare\r\n    whether I retain my house, must, _en cas que si_, stipulate\r\n    for buildings and repairs; expensive horses and other matters\r\n    would have to be purchased, which requires months here, and\r\n    causes a loss or saving of thousands. To move in winter is\r\n    scarcely possible. After some interruptions, I read my letter\r\n    again, and it makes a melancholy impression; unjustly so, for I\r\n    am neither discontented nor tired of life, and, after careful\r\n    consideration, have discovered no wish unfulfilled, except\r\n    that it should be 10° less cold, and that I should have paid\r\n    some fifty visits which press upon me. Modest wishes! I hear\r\n    that I am expected in the winter to the Diet. I do not think\r\n    of coming to Berlin without special orders from the King,\r\n    unless in summer, upon leave. Johanna and the children will,\r\n    I think, go to Germany in about four months. I shall follow,\r\n    if God will, in some four or six weeks, and shall return about\r\n    as much sooner. By reason of the cold, the children have not\r\n    been out of the house for nearly three weeks. All Russian\r\n    mothers observe this rule so soon as it is more than 10°; it\r\n    must therefore be a matter of experience, although I go to 15°,\r\n    but no farther. Despite this want of air, they look very well,\r\n    notwithstanding matters of diet—which is constitutional—and\r\n    their Christmas feastings. Marie has become a sensible little\r\n    person, but is still quite a child, which I am glad to see.\r\n    By my side lies Varnhagen’s Diary. I can not understand the\r\n    expenditure of moral indignation with which this needy mirror\r\n    of the times, from 1836 to 1845, has been condemned. There are\r\n    vulgarities enough in it, but people conversed in that manner\r\n    in those days, and worse; it is drawn from life. V. is vain\r\n    and malicious, but who is not? It is merely a question how\r\n    life has ripened the nature of one or another with worm-holes,\r\n    sunshine or wet weather, bitter, sweet, or rotten. During the\r\n    whole time at my command, there has been humbug of all sorts;\r\n    so I have written away up to two o’clock, and at three the\r\n    messenger must be on the railway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                       Petersburg, 7th March, 1862.\r\n\r\n    I make use of an English courier to send you a greeting of a\r\n    few lines; a groan at all the illness with which God afflicts\r\n    us. We have had scarcely a day all this winter on which we were\r\n    all well in the house. Johanna has a cough just now, which\r\n    quite exhausts her, so that she must not go out; Bill is in bed\r\n    with fever, pains in body and throat—the physician can not tell\r\n    us yet what will come of it; our new governess scarcely hopes\r\n    to see Germany again. She has been lying prostrate for weeks,\r\n    daily weaker and more helpless; the doctor thinks probably\r\n    galloping consumption will be the end of it. I am only well\r\n    when out shooting; directly I enter a ball-room or a theatre I\r\n    catch cold, and neither eat nor sleep. As soon as the climate\r\n    is milder I shall send them, stock, block, and barrel, to\r\n    Reinfeld. The indifference with which I contemplate a transfer\r\n    is much diminished by these facts: I should scarcely have the\r\n    courage to face next winter here. Johanna will scarcely be\r\n    persuaded to allow me to return hither by myself. If I am not\r\n    transferred I shall perhaps seek a longer leave of absence. I\r\n    have recently had a letter from ——; he believes he is intended\r\n    to be sent here, but would rather go to Paris; he thinks me\r\n    intended for London, and I have somewhat familiarized myself\r\n    with the thought. Letters from the Prince spoke of ——’s\r\n    resignation and my succession; I do not think this is the\r\n    intention, but should decline were it so. Independently of\r\n    political exigencies, I do not feel myself well enough for so\r\n    much excitement and labor. This feeling also causes me some\r\n    thought; if I were offered Paris, London is quieter; were it\r\n    not for climate and my children’s health, I should doubtless\r\n    prefer to remain here. Berne is also a fixed idea of mine;\r\n    tiresome places in pretty neighborhoods suit old people, but\r\n    there is no sporting there, as I do not care for climbing after\r\n    chamois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK ON THE SEINE.\r\n\r\n[1862.]\r\n\r\n    The Premiership ahead.—Ambassador to Paris.—Unveiling\r\n    of the Brandenburg Statue.—Uncertainty.—Delivers his\r\n    Credentials to Napoleon III.—Description of the Embassy\r\n    House at Paris, and of Prussia House, London.—Journey to\r\n    the South of France.—Trouville.—Bordeaux.—Bayonne.—San\r\n    Sebastian.—Biarritz.—Luchon.—Toulouse.—End of his Journeyman\r\n    Days.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK AS CHANCELLOR.]\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at the last section in Bismarck’s political\r\napprenticeship and journeymanship—to his embassy in Paris. This only\r\ncomprises a period of a few weeks, but it has become very important, by\r\nreason of the distinguished acquaintances that Bismarck then made, by\r\nthe more accurate knowledge he then obtained of French relations, which\r\ngrew more extensive subsequently, on his later journeys to the waters of\r\nBiarritz. We know from one of the letters already given that Bismarck had\r\nalready received an intimation at St. Petersburg that his King intended\r\nto appoint him Minister-President, and put him at the head of the\r\nGovernment. This intimation was probably not the only one; the relations\r\nbetween the King and himself had for a long time been very intimate.\r\nThe events of those days are too near to us to admit of the veil being\r\nentirely drawn aside; probably it was King William’s intention to have\r\nappointed him Minister-President in the spring of 1862 at once. We do\r\nnot know what hindered the appointment at that time; the result showed\r\nthat it was a fortunate circumstance in several respects that Bismarck\r\nwas first Ambassador in Paris before becoming head of the Government.\r\nWhether Bismarck had misgivings about assuming so great a responsibility,\r\nwho can tell? He would have ripely tested himself, but certainly he would\r\nnot have hesitated for an instant to respond to the call of his King\r\nwith patriotic zeal, for he saw the reorganization of the army threatened\r\nby the liberal opposition, and in that for him was the sole hope of\r\nobtaining for Prussia at the right hour her just position, and the future\r\nof Germany. He certainly knew that severe struggles were before him,\r\nbut he also knew they had to be fought through—that Parliamentarianism\r\nshould be rendered innoxious to the kingdom of Prussia, and that the\r\nblack-and-white standard should float from unassaulted battlements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the 23d May, 1862, Bismarck was appointed Ambassador to Paris, and\r\nset out thither. He had previously remained a few weeks at Berlin, where\r\nit is certain several conferences took place as to his acceptance of the\r\noffice of Minister-President; a passage in a letter to his wife below\r\nalludes to this.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th May the statue of the Count of Brandenburg was dedicated on\r\nthe Leipziger Platz, in the presence of King William. At that time, as\r\nit may be said, the Ministry of Bismarck was in the air. Bismarck was\r\npresent. When the cover of the statue had fallen, amidst the strains of\r\nthe Hohenfriedberg March, H. R. H. the Prince Carl advanced to him, and\r\nshook him by the hand, with a “Good-morning, Bismarck!”\r\n\r\n“Salute the new Minister-President!” said a member of the former Ministry\r\nof Manteuffel, in a very animated manner, to a representative of the new\r\nera.\r\n\r\nThe acclamations for the King, and the trumpet-call of the trumpeters of\r\nthe Cuirassiers, accompanied the prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe three following letters to his wife show that he felt himself\r\npainfully oppressed by the uncertainty of his then position:\r\n\r\n                                            Berlin, 17th May, 1862.\r\n\r\n    Our future is still as obscure as in Petersburg. Berlin is\r\n    more in the foreground. I do nothing for or against it,\r\n    but shall drink a good drop when I have my credentials to\r\n    Paris in my pocket. Nothing at all is said about London just\r\n    now, but things may change again. I go to the dedication of\r\n    Brandenburg, and then to ——, at ——, to dinner. I have not been\r\n    able to detach myself all day from Ministerial conversations,\r\n    and do not find these gentlemen at all more united than their\r\n    predecessors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                             Berlin, 23d May, 1862.\r\n\r\n    From the newspapers you will already have seen that I am\r\n    appointed to Paris. I am very glad of it, but the shadow\r\n    remains in the background. I was already as good as taken\r\n    prisoner for the Ministry. I shall start for Paris as soon as\r\n    I can get loose, to-morrow or next day; but I can not direct\r\n    our “uncertain” things to that place as yet, for I can not\r\n    but expect that in a few months or weeks they may recall me\r\n    and keep me here. I do not come to you first, as I wish to\r\n    take possession in Paris first; perhaps they will find another\r\n    Minister-President, when I am out of their sight. I will not\r\n    go to Schönhausen for the same reason, that I may not again\r\n    be seized. Yesterday I rode about for four hours in a major’s\r\n    uniform, and received my credentials for Paris in the saddle.\r\n    The roan mare is here, and has been my joy and refreshment in\r\n    the Thiergarten; I shall take her with me. The bears went off\r\n    to Frankfurt yesterday. I have my hands full in order to render\r\n    my journey possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                            Berlin, 25th May, 1862.\r\n\r\n    You write very seldom, and no doubt have more time for it than\r\n    I have. Since I have been here I have not had time to sleep\r\n    one night through. Yesterday I went out about eight o’clock\r\n    in the morning, came home five times to change my dress in a\r\n    hurry; at eight again I went to Potsdam to Prince Frederick\r\n    Charles, and returned at eleven. Now, at four, I have my first\r\n    free moment, and use it for heaping fiery coals upon your black\r\n    head. I think of leaving to-morrow—at latest on Tuesday—for\r\n    Paris; whether for long, God only knows—perhaps only for months\r\n    or weeks. They have all conspired to keep me here, and I shall\r\n    be very glad when I have found a point of rest on the Seine,\r\n    and a porter at the door who will let nobody see me for some\r\n    days. I do not know, indeed, whether to send our furniture\r\n    to Paris at all, for it is possible that I may be recalled\r\n    before they arrived. I am rather seeking a Hegira than a new\r\n    dwelling-place. I have been obliged to be very firm, to get rid\r\n    of the hotel life of waiting here. I am ready for every thing\r\n    that God sends, and only regret that I am separated from you,\r\n    without being able to say when we shall meet again. If I find\r\n    a prospect of remaining in Paris till the winter, I think you\r\n    will soon follow me, and we will settle, if it be only for a\r\n    short time. The course of June will decide whether I return\r\n    hither before the end of the session of the Diet, or remain\r\n    in Paris longer, and long enough to send for you. I shall do\r\n    what I can towards the latter result, and in any case I should\r\n    like you to come to Paris, were it only for a short time, and\r\n    without a regular residence, in order that you might see it.\r\n    Yesterday there was a grand military dinner, where I appeared\r\n    as a major. First there was a parade. The mare is my daily\r\n    delight in the Thiergarten, but not quiet enough for military\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to his residence in Paris, the following letters give the best account:\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                             Paris, 31st May, 1862.\r\n\r\n    Just a few lines amidst the throng of business, to tell you\r\n    I am well; but I feel somewhat lonely with the prospect of\r\n    green, with dull rainy weather, the humming of bees, and\r\n    twittering of sparrows. To-morrow I have a grand audience. It\r\n    is annoying that I have to buy linen—napkins, table-cloths,\r\n    and sheets. Do not have the “uncertain” things sent as yet from\r\n    Petersburg; those for Schönhausen and Reinfeld send to Stettin,\r\n    both to Bernhard’s exporter, D. Witte’s successor, to whom I\r\n    have written. Those for Reinfeld go by ship from Stettin to\r\n    Stolpmünde. My stay here is not certain, until the Ministry has\r\n    another President in place of Hohenlohe, and London is filled\r\n    up. Farewell! I greet you heartily. Pray write.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n                                             Paris, 1st June, 1862.\r\n\r\n    To-day I was received by the Emperor, and delivered my\r\n    credentials. He received me in a friendly manner, looks well,\r\n    has become somewhat stronger, but by no means fat and aged, as\r\n    he is caricatured. The Empress is still one of the handsomest\r\n    women I know, despite Petersburg; she has even grown handsomer\r\n    within these five years. The whole affair was official and\r\n    solemn. I was fetched in an imperial carriage by the Master\r\n    of the Ceremonies, and shall probably soon have a private\r\n    audience. I am anxious for work, because I do not know what\r\n    to do. To-day I dined alone; the young gentlemen were out.\r\n    The whole evening there was rain, and I was alone at home. To\r\n    whom could I go? I am more lonely in the midst of great Paris\r\n    than you are at Reinfeld, and sit here like a rat in an empty\r\n    house. My only amusement was to send away the cook for cheating\r\n    me in the accounts. You know how narrowly I look after such\r\n    things; but —— was a child in this respect. I shall dine for\r\n    the present at a café. How long this is to last, God knows! In\r\n    from eight to ten days I shall probably receive a telegraphic\r\n    summons to Berlin, and then dance and song is over. If my\r\n    opponents only knew what a benefit they would confer upon me\r\n    personally by their victory, and how sincerely I wish them\r\n    success, —— would then, perhaps, from malice, do all he could\r\n    to bring me to Berlin. You can not detest the Wilhelm Strasse\r\n    more than I do, and if I am not convinced that it _must_ be,\r\n    I will not go. To leave the King in a dilemma during illness,\r\n    I regard as cowardice and infidelity. If it is not to be, God\r\n    will raise up, for those who seek, some —— who will consent\r\n    to be a saucepan-lid. If it is to be, then forward! as our\r\n    coachmen said when they took the reins. Next summer we shall\r\n    then probably live at Schönhausen. _Hurero!_ I shall get into\r\n    my canopy bed, as broad as it is long—the only living being\r\n    in the whole house, for I do not think any body lives in the\r\n    parterre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BISMARCK TO HIS SISTER.\r\n\r\n                                            Paris, 16th June, 1862.\r\n\r\n    If all has happened according to the programme, you will to-day\r\n    have reached Landeck, where I wish you happy and healthy days.\r\n    On the completion of your twenty-ninth year I hope to present\r\n    myself with good wishes, although I do not accurately know in\r\n    how short a time the post goes between here and Landeck. The\r\n    barometer is always at changeable, as during the past year, and\r\n    will long continue so, whether I live here or in Berlin. There\r\n    is rest in the grave—at least I hope so. Since my departure\r\n    from Berlin I have not heard a word from any body about the\r\n    Ministerial question. ——’s leave of absence is out, and he\r\n    does not again enter on his duties; this I knew before. The\r\n    end of June I wait quietly for; if I do not then know what\r\n    is to become of me, I will urgently ask for certainty, so as\r\n    to settle myself here. If I seem likely to remain here till\r\n    January, I think I shall fetch Johanna in September, although\r\n    a domestic establishment of four months is very provisional\r\n    and uncomfortable. In packing and unpacking, a small fortune\r\n    is broken up in glass and china. Besides my wife and children,\r\n    the mare is what I chiefly want. I have tried some hired\r\n    horses, but I would rather never ride again. The house is\r\n    well situated, but is dark, damp, and cold. The sunny side is\r\n    spoilt with staircases and _non-valeurs_; every thing lies to\r\n    the north, and smells musty and cloacic. There is not a single\r\n    piece of furniture one can sit upon, nor a single corner in\r\n    which one can sit; three-quarters of the house is shut up as\r\n    “state rooms,” covered up, and, without a great change in\r\n    arrangements, not suitable for daily use. The nurses would live\r\n    on the third-floor, the children on the second. The principal\r\n    staircase (first-floor) only leads to a bed-chamber, with a\r\n    large bed, also an old-fashioned saloon (style of 1818) next\r\n    to it, many staircases and anterooms. Actual living room is on\r\n    the ground-floor northward towards the garden, where I warm\r\n    myself, when the sun shines, for some hours, at most three\r\n    times a week. You will see it in the margin: 1. Dressing-room,\r\n    spongy and uninhabitable, damp; 2. Study, dark, stinking; 3.\r\n    Reception-room; 4. A view from the house to the garden, with\r\n    bookcases; 5. Dining-room; 6. My bedroom; 7. Office; 8. Garden,\r\n    where the lines are, Quai D’Orsay and the Seine; 9 and 10.\r\n    Chancery; 11. Hall; 12. Staircase. Add to this, on the first\r\n    floor one bedroom, and no more, and all the domestic offices\r\n    two stories high; narrow, dark, steep stairs, which I can not\r\n    mount upright, on account of the breadth of my shoulders, and\r\n    without crinoline. The principal staircase only goes to the\r\n    first-floor, but there are three ladder-stairs at both ends\r\n    to the upper rooms. Hatzfeld and Pourtales existed thus their\r\n    whole time, but died over it in the prime of life; and if I\r\n    stay in the house, I shall die sooner than I wish. I would not\r\n    live in it for nothing, on account of the smell.\r\n\r\n        +---+  +---+\r\n        | 8 |  |   |\r\n        +---+  | 1 |\r\n        | 9 |  +---+\r\n        +---+  | 2 |\r\n        +------+---+\r\n        | 10   | 3 |\r\n        +------+---+\r\n        | 11   | 4 |\r\n        +------+---+\r\n               | 5 |\r\n               +---+\r\n          12   | 6 |\r\n               +---+\r\n               | 7 |\r\n               +---+\r\n\r\n    Please send Johanna the address where you had such good cakes\r\n    (Baumkuchen) made two years ago, for the birthday. I promised\r\n    one to the Archduchess Marie. Or rather, send me the address,\r\n    and I will order the cake by letter from here, and will inclose\r\n    a letter for ——, which the confectioner can send with the thing\r\n    by ship from Stettin. I am somewhat afraid if we stay here that\r\n    Johanna will be but little pleased. In a few days I am to go\r\n    to Fontainebleau. The Empress is a little stronger, and thus\r\n    handsomer than ever, and always very delightful and cheerful.\r\n    Afterwards I shall go to London for a few days. A number of\r\n    agreeable Russian ladies who were here have mostly disappeared.\r\n    Who has got my mare, if I want it here?\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, Bismarck took a short trip to the Exhibition in\r\nLondon, and returned to Paris on the 5th of July. On the 14th he wrote to\r\nhis wife:—\r\n\r\n    From your letter of the 9th of this month I have learnt with\r\n    joy that you are well, and I hope to read the same again\r\n    to-morrow morning. To-day the courier at last arrived, on whose\r\n    account I left London more than a week ago. I should like to\r\n    have remained there some days longer—I saw so many pretty faces\r\n    and fine horses. But the Embassy is a horror; well furnished,\r\n    but on the ground-floor, besides the staircase, there are\r\n    only three apartments, one a chancery, another a dining-room,\r\n    and between both, serving as a common rendezvous for dinner,\r\n    without a corner in which to take off a dressing-gown, the\r\n    study of His Excellency. If wash-hand basins, etc., are wanted\r\n    there, it is necessary to mount the high, tall stairway, and\r\n    pass through the principal bedroom into a little dog-hole of a\r\n    living-room. On the first-floor is one great saloon, a small\r\n    ball-room; next to it the afore-mentioned sleeping-room and\r\n    dog-hole; that is the whole of the living-room. Two stairs\r\n    higher there are two rooms for the secretary, and five small\r\n    places for children, tutor, governess, etc. On the third-floor,\r\n    under the roof, room for the servants, the kitchen in the\r\n    basement. I get quite miserable at the idea of being cooped\r\n    up in such a place. On my application for leave of absence, I\r\n    have to-day received a reply from Berlin, that the King could\r\n    not yet determine whether he could give me leave, because the\r\n    question whether I should accept the Presidency would be held\r\n    in suspense for six weeks, and I might write whether I thought\r\n    it necessary to enter the present session of the Chambers, and\r\n    when, and whether before the commencement of my leave I would\r\n    come to Berlin. The latter I shall endeavor to avoid—shall\r\n    propose that I be left here in peace till the winter, and\r\n    during the interval, say the day after to-morrow or Thursday,\r\n    go to Trouville, west from Havre-on-the-Sea, and there await\r\n    the winter. I can always get here from that place in five\r\n    hours. Since yesterday we have had fine weather; until then it\r\n    was miserably cold, with endless rain. Yesterday I employed in\r\n    dining at St. Germain, a fine wood, two versts long, a terrace\r\n    above the Seine, with a charming view over forests, hills,\r\n    towns, and villages, all green up to Paris. I have just driven\r\n    through the Bois de Boulogne in the mildest moonlight—thousands\r\n    of carriages in a Corso file, water-surfaces with gay lights,\r\n    an open-air concert; and now to bed. Our carriages have reached\r\n    Stettin; I shall have them housed there or in Külz. All my\r\n    colleagues are gone, and the only acquaintance with whom I have\r\n    any intercourse is old ——, which neither of us dreamt of twenty\r\n    years ago. My servants are Lemburg, a Russian, an Italian\r\n    Fazzi, who was footman to Stolberg in Morocco, three Frenchmen\r\n    (chancery-servant, coachman, and cook), and an Electoral\r\n    Hessian, with a Belgian wife, as porters.\r\n\r\nBismarck went first to Trouville, as he announces; but he was so\r\nuncomfortable there that he left in a very few days. On the 25th of\r\nJuly he entered upon that beautiful journey to the south-west of France\r\ninto Spain, where he found strength for the important problem which\r\nfell, two months later, to his lot—that great task he did not seek,\r\nbut did not refuse. He enjoyed the pleasure of this refreshment with\r\nkeen appreciation, for he well knew what was before him. He enjoyed\r\nthe sea-baths of San Sebastian and Biarritz particularly; he was all\r\n“sea-salt and sun;” he lived “as in Stolpmünde, only without sack.”\r\nHe climbed the Pyrenees, and delighted in the mulberries, olives, and\r\nred grapes of Avignon, and was so industrious a correspondent towards\r\nhis wife, that the blue envelopes, in which his letters flew from the\r\nSpanish frontier to Farther Pomerania, did not last. How many of these\r\nletters were written in the open air, upon a rock, upon the grass, with a\r\nnewspaper underneath them! Some of these may find their place here.\r\n\r\n                                         Bordeaux, 27th July, 1862.\r\n\r\n    You can not refuse me the testimonial of being an industrious\r\n    correspondent; this morning I wrote to your birthday child from\r\n    Chenonceaux, and this evening I write from the city of red\r\n    wine. These lines, however, will arrive a day later than those,\r\n    the mail only going at noon to-morrow. I have only left Paris\r\n    the day before yesterday, but it seems to me a week. I have\r\n    seen some very beautiful castles. Chambord, of which the plans\r\n    torn from a book give a very imperfect idea, in its desolation\r\n    corresponds to the fate of its possessor. In the spacious halls\r\n    and magnificent saloons, where kings and their mistresses held\r\n    their court amidst hunting scenes, the childish playthings of\r\n    the Duke of Bordeaux are the only furniture. The guide thought\r\n    I was a French legitimist, and repressed a tear when she showed\r\n    me the little cannon of her master. I paid for the tears,\r\n    according to tariff, with an extra franc, although I have no\r\n    calling to subvent Carlism. The castle courts were as quiet in\r\n    the sun as deserted churchyards. From the towers there is an\r\n    expansive prospect; but on all sides there are silent woods\r\n    and broom to the utmost horizon—no town, no village, no farm\r\n    either near the castle or around it. From the inclosed examples\r\n    of broom you will hardly recognize how purple these plants, so\r\n    beloved by me, grow there—the only flower in the royal gardens,\r\n    and swallows almost the only living tenants of the castle.\r\n    It is too lonely for sparrows. The old castle of Amboise is\r\n    magnificently situated; one can see from the top six miles\r\n    either way down the Loire. Thence one gradually passes into the\r\n    south. Wheat disappears, and gives place to maize; in between\r\n    rank woods of vines and chestnuts, castles and forts, with many\r\n    towers, chimneys, and gables, quite white, with high pointed\r\n    slate roofs. The heat was glowing, and I was glad to have half\r\n    a coupé to myself. In the evening, splendid sheet lightning\r\n    in the east, and now a pleasant coolness, which, in our own\r\n    land, we should think somewhat sultry. The sun sets at 7.35. In\r\n    Petersburg one would be able to see now, about eleven, without\r\n    lights. Till now, no letter has arrived for me; perhaps I shall\r\n    find one at Bayonne. I shall stop here some two days, to see\r\n    where our wines grow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                              Bordeaux, Wednesday, 29th July, 1862.\r\n\r\n    Your letter of the 23d yesterday reached me safely, and I thank\r\n    God you are well. Yesterday, with our Consul and a General, I\r\n    made a charming tour through Médoc. I drank Lafitte, Mouton,\r\n    Pichon, Laroze, Latour, Margaux St. Julien, Branne, Armeillac,\r\n    and other wines in their original names, in the cellar.\r\n    Thermometer 30° in the shade, 55° in the sun; but with good\r\n    wine inside this is not felt at all. I am just starting for\r\n    Bayonne, and will write thence more quietly than now, in the\r\n    custody of the railway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Bayonne, 29th July, 1862.\r\n\r\n    I employ the time in which my things are coming from the\r\n    railway station to perfect my short epistle of this morning\r\n    from Bordeaux. The country I have just passed through\r\n    transports me at first sight most vividly into the Government\r\n    Pskow, or Petersburg. From Bordeaux to this place there are\r\n    uninterrupted pine forests, broom, and moorland, sometimes like\r\n    Pomerania—as in the Strandwald behind the downs—sometimes\r\n    Russia. But when I used my glass the illusion vanished;\r\n    instead of the Scotch fir, it is the long-haired sea-pine,\r\n    and the apparent mixture of juniper, raspberries, and such\r\n    plants covering the ground is dissolved into all sorts of\r\n    foreign-looking shrubs, with leaves resembling myrtle and\r\n    cypress. The magnificence with which the broom develops\r\n    its violet-purple blossoms here is astonishing; in between\r\n    there grows a very yellow furze with broad leaves, the whole\r\n    forming a gay carpet. The river Adour, on which Bayonne\r\n    lies, is the frontier of this B flat of heath, which, in its\r\n    softer idealization of a northern landscape, sharpened my\r\n    homesickness. From St. Vincent the view stretches over the\r\n    moor and pine-trees to the blue outlines of the Pyrenees, a\r\n    sort of giant Taunus, but more bold and jagged in profile. The\r\n    post-office is closed during the hot time of day, until four\r\n    o’clock, so that I can only receive your letter in an hour,\r\n    and should be doubly impatient had I not yesterday received\r\n    your letter of the 23d; and the one lying here is older. I\r\n    think of driving to Biarritz towards evening, and bathing there\r\n    to-morrow, and then continuing my journey to the frontier. In\r\n    Fuent Arabia I await intelligence as to whether G. is in St.\r\n    Sebastian, then I shall visit him; but if he has returned to\r\n    Madrid I shall content myself with having crossed the Bidassoa,\r\n    shall return hither, and then proceed along the mountains to\r\n    Pau; thence I shall turn to the right among the mountains,\r\n    first to Eaux Bonnes and Eaux Chaudes, and next to Cauterets,\r\n    St. Sauveur, Luz, Barrèges, and Bagnères de Luchon. I can not\r\n    say that I am bored; a number of new impressions rise up within\r\n    me, but I feel like a banished man, and in thought am rather on\r\n    the Kamenz than the Adour. German newspapers I have not seen\r\n    for six days, nor do I miss them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                     San Sebastian, 1st Aug., 1862.\r\n\r\n    The road from Bayonne to this place is magnificent. To the left\r\n    are the Pyrenees, something like Dent du Midi and Moleson;\r\n    here, however, called Pic and Port, a changing Alp panorama. To\r\n    the right the sea, a shore like Genoa. The transition to Spain\r\n    is surprising. In Behobie, the last French place, one could\r\n    believe that one was still on the Loire. In Fuent Arabia is a\r\n    steep lane twelve feet wide; every window has its balcony and\r\n    curtain, every balcony its black eyes and mantillas, beauty and\r\n    dirt. On the market-place drums and fifes, and some hundreds of\r\n    women, old and young, dancing among themselves, while the men\r\n    stand by smoking and draped. The neighborhood up to this place\r\n    is extraordinarily beautiful; green valleys and woody slopes,\r\n    above them fantastic lines of forts, row after row. Bights\r\n    of the sea with very small inlets, which, like the Salzburg\r\n    Lakes in Bergkesseln, cut deep into the land. From my window I\r\n    am looking at one of these, cut away from the sea by a rocky\r\n    islet, steeply fringed by mountains, with forest and houses to\r\n    the left, below the town and harbor. At about ten I bathed,\r\n    and after breakfast we walked or slouched through the heat to\r\n    the mount of the citadel, and sat for a long time on a bank.\r\n    Some hundred feet beneath us was the sea; next to us a heavy\r\n    fort battery, with a singing sentinel. This mountain or rock\r\n    would be an island, did not a low isthmus connect it with the\r\n    mainland. The isthmus divides two arms of the sea from each\r\n    other, and thus from the citadel towards the north there is a\r\n    fine view of the sea. To the east and west are the two arms,\r\n    like two Swiss lakes; to the south is the isthmus, with the\r\n    town on it, and behind towards the land, mountains stretching\r\n    skyward. I should like to have a picture painted of it for you,\r\n    and were we fifteen years younger we would both come hither.\r\n    To-morrow or next day I return to Bayonne, but shall remain a\r\n    few days at Biarritz, where the shore is not so beautiful as\r\n    here, but still prettier than I had thought, and the life is\r\n    somewhat more civilized. To my great content, I hear nothing\r\n    from Berlin and Paris. I am very much sunburnt, and should have\r\n    liked to lie in the sea for an hour. The water buoys me up like\r\n    a piece of wood, and it is just cool enough to be pleasant. One\r\n    is almost dry by the time one reaches the dressing-hut; then I\r\n    put my hat on and take a walk _en peignoir_. Fifty paces off\r\n    the ladies bathe, after the custom of the country. The customs\r\n    and passport business are infinite, and the tolls incredible,\r\n    or I should remain here longer, instead of bathing at Biarritz,\r\n    where it is necessary to assume a costume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Biarritz, 4th Aug., 1862.\r\n\r\n    I fear that I have made some confusion in our correspondence,\r\n    as I have led you to write too early to places where I am not.\r\n    It will be better to write to Paris, just as if I were there;\r\n    the Embassy will then forward them, and I can give quicker\r\n    information then as to any change in my travelling plans. Last\r\n    evening I reached Bayonne from St. Sebastian, where I slept for\r\n    the night, and am now sitting in a corner room of the Hotel de\r\n    l’Europe, with a charming view of the blue sea, which drives\r\n    its foam between wonderful cliffs against the lighthouse.\r\n    My conscience reproves me for seeing so much that is lovely\r\n    without you. Could I bring you here through the air, we would\r\n    immediately return to St. Sebastian. Think of the Siebengebirge\r\n    with the Drachenfels placed on the sea-shore; next to it\r\n    Ehrenbreitstein, and between both an arm of the sea, somewhat\r\n    broader than the Rhine, stretching into the land, forming a\r\n    round cove behind the mountains. Here one bathes in transparent\r\n    clear water, so heavy and salt that one floats, and can look\r\n    through the broad rock entrance into the ocean, or landward,\r\n    where the mountain chains rise ever higher and more azure. The\r\n    women of the middle and lower classes are remarkably pretty,\r\n    some of them handsome: the men are surly and uncivil; and the\r\n    conveniences of life to which we are accustomed are wanting.\r\n    The heat here is not worse than there, and I think nothing of\r\n    it—on the contrary, thank God, I am very well. Yesterday there\r\n    was a storm, the like of which I have never seen. On a stair\r\n    of four steps on the harbor dam I had to try to mount thrice\r\n    before I could get up; pieces of stone and halves of trees were\r\n    flying through the air. Unfortunately, this led me to retract\r\n    my place on a sailing vessel to Bayonne, little thinking that\r\n    in four hours all would be quiet and serene. I thus lost a\r\n    charming sea passage along the coast, remained another day in\r\n    St. Sebastian, and yesterday left in the diligence, somewhat\r\n    uncomfortably packed between dainty little Spanish women,\r\n    with whom I could not interchange a word. They understood\r\n    enough Italian, however, for me to make it clear to them that\r\n    I was pleased with their outward appearance. I looked over\r\n    a travelling plan this morning, how I could get from here,\r\n    _i.e._, Toulouse, by railway, through Marseilles to Nizza, then\r\n    by ship to Genoa, thence by Venice, Trieste, Vienna, Breslau,\r\n    Posen, Stargard to Cöslin!—if Berlin were only passable. Just\r\n    now I can not well get by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                       Luchon, 9th September, 1862.\r\n\r\n    The day before yesterday we ascended the Col de Venasque from\r\n    this place; first two hours through magnificent beech woods,\r\n    full of ivy, rocks, and waterfalls; then to a hospice, then\r\n    two hours of steep riding on horseback in the snow, with great\r\n    views, quiet deep lakes between snow and cliffs, and at a\r\n    height of 7500 feet a narrow portal opened in the sharp comb of\r\n    the Pyrenees by which Spain is entered. The land of chestnuts\r\n    and palms here shows itself as a rocky basin, surrounded by\r\n    the Maladetta, which lay before us, Pic de Suavegarde, and Pic\r\n    de Picade; to the right rushed the waters to the Ebro, to the\r\n    left to the Garonne, and towards the horizon one glacier and\r\n    snow-cap after another stared at us, far into Catalonia and\r\n    Aragon. There we breakfasted, pressed closely to the rocks—red\r\n    partridges without salt and water; and then rode down again\r\n    upon giddy declivities, but with splendid weather. Yesterday\r\n    we had a similar expedition to Superbagnères and to the gates\r\n    of hell (_le gouffre d’enfer_), into the abysses of which a\r\n    magnificent waterfall precipitated itself between beeches,\r\n    oaks, chestnuts, and ashes. The waterfalls of the Pyrenees are\r\n    certainly superior to those of the Alps, although the latter\r\n    are decidedly more imposing. To-day we saw the Lake of Oo, a\r\n    rock basin like the Obersee, near Berchtesgaden, but animated\r\n    by a tremendous waterfall which tumbles into it. We rowed\r\n    upon it, singing French _chansonnettes_, alternately with\r\n    Mendelssohn—_i.e._, I listened. We then rode home in a pouring\r\n    rain, and are now dry again and hungry. No day passes without\r\n    being six or eight hours on horseback. To-morrow the jest is\r\n    over, and “How so soon it vanishes,” etc., was the order of the\r\n    day. To-morrow evening we shall be in Toulouse, where I hope\r\n    to find letters from you, _viâ_ Paris. The last I received was\r\n    yours of the 29th, sent to me by R. It is my fault, as I had\r\n    appointed that they were only to send on from Paris from the\r\n    4th, and then to Toulouse. I thought I should have left Luchon\r\n    on the 6th, and arrived at T. I know nothing from Berlin; have\r\n    not read a newspaper for a fortnight, and my leave is up. I\r\n    expect a letter from —— in Toulouse, and that I shall be sent\r\n    for to Berlin, without definitive conclusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                    Toulouse, 12th September, 1862.\r\n\r\n    By some blunder of my own, and post-office pedantry, I somehow\r\n    got into a mess with your letters, and I am very rejoiced and\r\n    thankful to receive here your dear letter of the 4th, with\r\n    good news. I also anticipated a letter from ——, with some\r\n    clear indications of the future, but only got one from ——. I\r\n    had no notion of the King’s journey to Doberan and Carlsruhe;\r\n    in happy forgetfulness of the world have I ranged mountains\r\n    and forests, and am somewhat upset at finding myself, after\r\n    six weeks, for the first time in a large city. I am going in\r\n    the first instance with —— to Montpellier, and must reflect\r\n    whether I shall proceed thence to Paris to make purchases, or\r\n    whether I shall accompany —— to Geneva, and thence make direct\r\n    for Berlin. My leave is up; —— writes that the King would be\r\n    in Carlsruhe on the 9th, but according to your letter it is\r\n    the 13th. The best thing would be, if I requested extension of\r\n    leave from here for further—weeks to Pomerania, and await the\r\n    answer in Paris, as well as the return of the King to Berlin,\r\n    before I set out, for certainty is now a necessity, or I shall\r\n    send in my resignation. At this moment I am not in a state\r\n    to decide; I will first take a walk, and perhaps I shall get\r\n    an idea what to do. I wonder my letters have not reached you\r\n    regularly. The longest interval I have ever allowed was four\r\n    days between my last letter from Luchon and the last but one\r\n    from Bayonne, because we were riding every day from morning\r\n    till night, eating or sleeping, and paper was not always at\r\n    hand. Yesterday was a rainy day, fitted for railway travelling,\r\n    bringing us from Montrejeau to this place—new and bad, a flat\r\n    country with vines and meadows. I am now writing to —— and ——.\r\n    If possible, I shall remain in Paris.\r\n\r\nWith these letters the Apprentice and Journeyman years of Bismarck are at\r\nan end; the next few days conducted him from Avignon to Berlin, to prove\r\nhis Mastership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Fifth.\r\n\r\nMINISTER-PRESIDENT AND COUNT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ministerpräsident und Graf.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS.\r\n\r\n    The Crisis of 1862.—Bismarck Premier.—The Party of\r\n    Progress.—The Liberals.—The Conservatives.—Bismarck’s\r\n    Determination.—“_Voilà mon Médecin!_”—Anecdotes.—Attitude\r\n    of the Government.—Refusal of the Budget.—Prudence of the\r\n    Minister-President.—Official Presentation of Letters of Recall\r\n    at Saint Cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwin-born with the active, restless life and labor so typical of our\r\nmodern days, with the rapid course of political events, we note the\r\nnatural sisterhood of swift forgetfulness. Most of us would have some\r\ndifficulty in forming any thing like a clear picture of the decidedly\r\ninvolved situation in which Prussia stood in the autumn of 1862. It is\r\nbeside our purpose to attempt any definition of this situation here,\r\nwithout taking into consideration the difficulties surrounding the\r\nsolution of such a problem at that time; we must, therefore, content\r\nourselves with cursory hints and indications.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Ministry, which had just resigned, had left the conflict with\r\nthe Electoral Chamber of the Diet as an inheritance to the Conservative\r\nGovernment now in power.\r\n\r\nKing William did not desire a _coup d’état_; he therefore unweariedly\r\nstrove to bring about a good understanding, and found his efforts\r\nseconded throughout this stormy crisis by the loyal zeal and devotion of\r\nthe Conservatives as well as the Liberals—especially by his ever-faithful\r\nWar Minister General von Roon; but all endeavors, to the deepest sorrow\r\nof the paternal-hearted monarch, proved unavailing.\r\n\r\nIt was at last necessary to find some guiding Minister, sufficiently\r\npossessed of devotion, energy, daring, and circumspection, to carry on\r\nthe business of the State, despite of the crisis, until, in the course of\r\ntime, the action of history should have reconciled these fiery opponents.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the King fell upon his then representative at Paris—upon\r\nBismarck, who was summoned by telegraph from the Pyrenees to Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt was well known to King William that the selection of this statesman,\r\nat any rate for the moment, would tend to heighten the sharpness of\r\nthe strife; for, in the eyes of his opponents, Bismarck then was, and\r\nlong remained, the Hotspur of the Junker party—the fiery and energetic\r\nConservative party leader. Very few knew to what a statesman Bismarck\r\nhad ripened in Frankfurt, where he had thoroughly learnt to know the\r\nfox-trap, so dangerous for Prussia, of German small-statism, with its\r\ninnumerable corners and windings; as also in St. Petersburg, where he had\r\nstudied under a politician of the first rank, Prince Gortschakoff; and\r\nfinally in the hot atmosphere of Paris.\r\n\r\n“Bismarck! that is the _coup d’état_!” a democratic organ exclaimed; and\r\nthis was re-echoed in an undertone by many Conservatives, who, perhaps,\r\nonly saw safety in a _coup d’état_. But Bismarck was by no means a\r\n_coup d’état_, but a statesman; and a statesman in whom the King reposed\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nAfter long and well-considered deliberation, the King came to this\r\ndifficult determination. The appointment of Bismarck, under existing\r\ncircumstances, was doubly and trebly difficult, for, though Bismarck was\r\nintelligible enough to him, the majority of the nation did not understand\r\nhim, and in every direction, in all circles, and under every political\r\nform, opposition arose, with wild cries of resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd when he had actually been summoned, the question presented itself on\r\nthe other side—What conditions would Bismarck impose? With what programme\r\nwould he enter upon the situation?\r\n\r\nOn this, General von Roon, whom Bismarck had known as a boy, and whom he\r\nhad accompanied in surveys through Pomerania, with his little gun, was\r\nsent to meet him. And lo! all this hesitation was perfectly unnecessary;\r\nfor the Brandenburg liege faith of Bismarck responded to the appeal of\r\nhis feudatory lord with the simple answer: “Here I am!”\r\n\r\nBismarck imposed no conditions, came forward with no programme; the\r\nfaithful vassal of Electoral Brandenburg placed himself simply at his\r\nKing’s disposal, with that chivalric devotion which contemplates the most\r\ndifficult position as self-intelligible. The beloved kingdom of Prussia\r\nhad to be upheld against the parliamentary spirit; the new organization\r\nof the army, on which the future of Prussia and Germany depended, had to\r\nbe saved; such was the task imposed upon Bismarck.\r\n\r\nWhen Bismarck arrived in Berlin, about the middle of September, 1862, he\r\nfound opposite himself the party of progress, almost certain of victory,\r\nclashing onward like a charger with heavy spurs and sword, trampling upon\r\nevery thing that came in its path, setting up new scandals every day,\r\nand acting in such a manner that the wiser chiefs of that very party\r\nshook their heads. Besides the party of progress, and partially governed\r\nand towed along by it, was the Liberal party, in the greatest confusion\r\nafter their recent amazing catastrophe, but possessed, with the exception\r\nof a minority, of an almost still greater dislike for Bismarck than was\r\nentertained by the Progressists: very easily might this be understood, as\r\nit was this party more than any other that Bismarck had opposed since the\r\nfirst United Diet.\r\n\r\nBismarck had only the Conservative party in his own favor, but, during\r\nthe new era, this had fallen away to an almost vanishing fraction in\r\nthe Electoral Chamber; its political activity was maintained only by\r\nthe Upper House and by the _Neue Preussische Zeitung_, together with a\r\nportion of the provincial press, and was just then once more beginning\r\nto express its views in a louder tone by the revival of the conservative\r\nassociative principle. The new era had shown Conservative politicians\r\nthat a Conservative party in Prussia, although possessing perfect\r\nindividuality upon single questions, could only as a great whole be a\r\nGovernment party. “With the Government in courage, without the Government\r\nin sorrow, if needs be against the Government with humility; such is\r\nthe path of the Conservative party!” Such was once the fine and proud\r\naxiom of the Conservatives, but only true so far as it concerns special\r\nquestions. Conservative Prussia can only go hand in hand with the Royal\r\nGovernment; but, on the other hand, it is equally certain that a truly\r\nRoyal Government in Prussia can only be a Conservative Government.\r\nThe proofs to the contrary imported from France or England are not\r\napplicable to the peculiar circumstances of Prussia, and hence act in a\r\nmanner productive of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe support which the Conservative party could then give to Bismarck\r\nwas, as it were, that of a vanquished army, and its ranks required\r\nreorganization ere it could be led against the foe. But Conservative\r\nsupport was tendered voluntarily, and with perfect devotion, even by that\r\nfraction of the party which was piqued with Bismarck since he had, at\r\nFrankfurt, shown a front against Austria, which, indeed, was almost in\r\nopen hostility towards him, since he had proposed more friendly relations\r\nwith France, had supported the unpopular doctrine of international\r\ninterests, and had declared himself for Italy. The acute men of\r\nHochkirchen, the intelligent representatives of conservative idealism,\r\nthe firm pillars of the policy of the Holy Alliance, the enthusiastic\r\ndefenders of all legitimacy, from whose ranks Bismarck himself had\r\nemerged, had partly become his antagonists; but at the ominous hour when\r\nhe assumed the head of the Government, they did not deny themselves to\r\nhim, and “our azure blues,” as the late Baron von Hertefeld used to call\r\nthem, in his peculiar tone of admiration and malice, have honestly stood\r\nby Bismarck through difficult years, in the good fight he had fought for\r\nthe Prussian monarchy.\r\n\r\nWhat a battle, however, this was may be judged from the fact that many\r\nof the best fellow-soldiers of Bismarck no longer contended for victory,\r\nbut, so to speak, sought only a chivalric death. In all Conservative\r\ncircles it was everywhere said that the fight was only continued from\r\na sense of duty: the victory of progress and parliamentarianism over\r\nthe old Prussian monarchy was now only a question of time, but it was\r\nnecessary to die standing. The last advocates of the Prussian monarchy\r\nat least desired to win the respect of their antagonists. Such was the\r\nphrase of those days; most of them have probably long since forgotten\r\nit, but it is fitting that they should sometimes be reminded of it. In\r\nthe year 1863, one of the most zealous personal partisans of Bismarck\r\ndetermined to accept an important mission offered by him, with the\r\ncertain conviction that in so doing he was preparing for an honorable\r\nfall. Certainly there also existed in those days fresh undejected minds\r\nwho stood to their imperishable belief in the Prussian monarchy as in an\r\nimpregnable fortress, and flung the flag of hope merrily to the breeze;\r\nbut of these the number was very small.\r\n\r\nDid Bismarck belong to these? Yes. He believed in his Prussian monarchy,\r\nhad faith in the future of Prussia and Germany; but he was also perfectly\r\nconscious that he was engaged in a mortal conflict.\r\n\r\nHe has not publicly expressed himself on this, but several isolated\r\nremarks which he has, in his characteristic manner, let drop to various\r\nfriends, place this beyond a doubt. Several times he said—\r\n\r\n“Death on the scaffold, under certain circumstances, is as honorable as\r\ndeath on the battle-field!” and, “I can imagine worse modes of death than\r\nthe axe!”\r\n\r\nOnly six years lie between that time, in which such words were fraught\r\nwith such terrible significance, and to-day, when that time seems to us\r\nlike a frightful dream; but that it wears such an aspect to us, is due,\r\nunder God’s mercy and the valor of King William, to the faithful devotion\r\nand energetic policy of Count Bismarck.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Bismarck entered upon office with strong confidence; he\r\nreally hoped at first to arrive at some solution of the crisis. All those\r\nwho saw or spoke to him in those September or October days, remember the\r\nunwearied bearing and joyful assurance with which he went to work. “He\r\nlooks thin, healthy, and sunbrowned, like a man who has traversed the\r\ndesert on a dromedary!” was the description given of him by a friend at\r\nthe time. At first he thought it not impossible to win over the hostile\r\nparty leaders, and he conferred with many of them: whether they were\r\nLiberals or Progressists, in the end they were, at any rate, Prussians.\r\nHe appealed to their Prussian patriotism; they could not fail, although\r\nthey sought it by different ways to himself, to have their country’s fame\r\nand glory as a common goal. But if they desired the well-being of Prussia\r\nand Germany, they could not but also desire the means to that end—the\r\nnewly organized army. No doubt that many of those with whom Bismarck\r\nnegotiated, or who were negotiated with by others at his instance,\r\nfelt their hearts beating loudly at this appeal; but he succeeded only\r\nin winning a very few. With the majority, the rigid party doctrine\r\nprevailed as an insurmountable barrier; with others, every attempt at\r\nan understanding was rendered unsuccessful by unvanquishable suspicion;\r\nmany well understood the hints—and more than hints it was impossible for\r\nBismarck to give—but they did nothing more. He thus finally attained to\r\na summation of undeceptions, which did not discourage him, although this\r\ngradually filled his patriotic heart with the deepest sorrow.\r\n\r\nBut at first, as we have said, he came forward fresh and full of hope;\r\nnor did his first failures and undeceptions disconcert him in any way.\r\nHis tone towards his opponents was that of reconciliation. For his\r\nsovereign’s sake he took many a step towards conciliation with sad\r\nreluctance, although without desistance.\r\n\r\nHis wife, who was residing in Pomerania with her parents, he could\r\nfurnish with meagre reports. The lovely season of the “blue” was past,\r\nand the fullness of labor began to increase with rapidity. On the 7th\r\nof October he wrote to her at a session of the House of Deputies in\r\nthe following terms:—“I am sitting at the table of the Chamber, with\r\na speaker, who talks nonsense to me, on the tribune just before me,\r\nand between one explanation just given, and another one I shall have\r\nto give, I write to you to say I am well. Plenty of work—somewhat\r\ntired—not sleep enough—the beginning of all things is difficult. With\r\nGod’s help things will go better, and it is very well so, only it is\r\nsomewhat uncomfortable, this life on a tray! I dine every day with our\r\ngood-natured Roon, who will be a real support for you. I see I have\r\ncommenced on the wrong side; I hope it is not a bad omen.” [The letter is\r\nwritten on the inner side of the paper.] “If I had not R. and the mare I\r\nshould feel very lonely, although I am never alone.”\r\n\r\nBismarck was provisionally living at the Ministry of State, in the\r\n“Auerswaldhöhle,” and only moved to the Foreign Office when the family\r\nhad returned from Pomerania.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was also written during those days to his sister.\r\nThe Bismarckian humor is likewise to be traced in it:—\r\n\r\n                                           Berlin, 18th Oct., 1862.\r\n\r\n    Such good black-pudding I never ate, and seldom such good\r\n    liver; may your slaughtering be blessed: for three days I have\r\n    been breakfasting upon the results of it. The cook, Rimpe,\r\n    has arrived, and I dine at home alone when I am not at His\r\n    Majesty’s table. I got along very well at Paris. At Letzlingen\r\n    I shot one stag, one sow, one badger, five brockets, four\r\n    head of deer, and blundered tolerably, if, perhaps, not as\r\n    much as my neighbors. But the amount of work here is growing\r\n    daily. To-day, from eight to eleven, diplomacy; from eleven\r\n    to half-past two, various Ministerial squabble conferences;\r\n    then, till four, report to the King; from a quarter past to\r\n    three-quarters, a gallop in the rain to the Hippodrome; five\r\n    o’clock, dinner; from seven till now, ten, work of all sorts.\r\n    But health and sound sleep—tremendous thirst!\r\n\r\nIt ought not, and could not, remain so long. The strong\r\nself-consciousness and feeling of victory with which the Progressist\r\nparty advanced—and that in a manner the most abrupt, and sometimes even\r\npersonally insulting—could not fail to convince Bismarck, that he would\r\nnot succeed in solving the crisis. He had now to resolve to leave—in\r\naccordance with the King’s will—time to solve matters, but, despite of\r\nthis, to continue, within the constitution, to conduct the Government.\r\nWith a firm step he pursued this difficult path, and he was able to\r\ninspire others with his confidence. Yes; even King William, whose gentle\r\nheart suffered severely in this arena of contention, refreshed himself\r\nat his Minister’s sure bearing—so much so, that on one occasion, when a\r\nlovely Russian princess was congratulating him on his healthy appearance,\r\nhe pointed to Bismarck, and replied, “_Voilà mon médecin_!”\r\n\r\nAn old acquaintance, who met Bismarck at this time, and asked him how\r\nhe was, received for reply, “How should I be? You know how I love to be\r\nlazy, and how I have to work!”\r\n\r\nThe chief of one of the numerous deputations of those days, at which\r\nopponents mocked so much as loyalty deputations, although they were of\r\nno little significance, was introduced to Bismarck. He summed up the\r\npersonal impression which the Minister-President made upon him, in his\r\nsinging Saxon dialect, in the admiring phrase:—“D’ye hear! one can’t talk\r\nnonsense when one meets that man!”\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose you’ve never been in the Chamber?” the Berlin friends of\r\nthe worthy inhabitant of Wettin, or Löbejühn, observed in reply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is certainly evidence in favor of Bismarck’s conciliating tendency,\r\nthat at a session of the Commission he took a twig from his pocket-book\r\nand showed it to his antagonists, merrily adding, in a chatty way,\r\nthat he had plucked this olive-branch at Avignon to present it to the\r\nProgressist party in token of peace; but he unfortunately had been forced\r\nto learn there that the time for that had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th September, 1862, he announced the withdrawal of the budget\r\nfor 1863, “because the Government considered it their duty not to allow\r\nthe obstacles towards a settlement to increase in volume.” He then\r\nannounced his intentions, his aims, as clearly as he dared. “The conflict\r\nhas been too tragically understood,” he said, “and too tragically\r\nrepresented by the press; the Government sought no contest. If the crisis\r\ncould be honorably surmounted, the Government would gladly lend a hand.\r\nIt was owing to the great obstinacy of individuals that it was difficult\r\nto govern with the constitution in Prussia. A constitutional crisis was\r\nno disgrace, it was an honor. We are, perhaps, too cultured to endorse\r\na constitution; we are too critical. Public opinion changed; the press\r\nwas not public opinion; it was well known how the press was upheld. The\r\nDeputies had the task of determining its opinions, and to stand above it.\r\nGermany does not contemplate the Liberalism of Prussia, but her power.\r\nBavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden might indulge Liberalism; but they are\r\nnot therefore called upon to play the part of Prussia. Prussia must hold\r\nher power together for the favorable opportunity which has already been\r\nsometimes neglected; the frontiers of Prussia were not favorable to a\r\ngood State constitution. The great questions of the day were not to be\r\ndecided by speeches and majorities—this had been the error of 1848 and\r\n1849—but by iron and blood!”\r\n\r\nBut the Opposition understood this frank language so little, that there\r\nwas nothing more than plenty of jesting about the iron-and-blood policy,\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chamber answered these conciliating steps with the\r\nresolutions of the 7th October, by which all expenditure was declared\r\nunconstitutional if declined by the national representatives, Bismarck\r\nreplied with this cutting declaration:—\r\n\r\n“According to this resolution, the Royal Government can not for the\r\npresent anticipate any result from the continuance of its attempts to\r\narrive at some settlement, but rather expect from any renewal of the\r\nnegotiation a heightening of party differences, which would render any\r\nunderstanding in the future more difficult.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the 8th of October, 1862, Bismarck, who had been named\r\nMinister of State and President of the Ministry, _ad interim_, on the 23d\r\nSeptember, was appointed President of the Ministry of State and Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of October the session of the Diet was closed, and on this\r\noccasion Bismarck again took an opportunity of expressing his views\r\non his position with great moderation and gentleness. He said:—“The\r\nGovernment is perfectly aware of the responsibility which has arisen from\r\nthis lamentable crisis; but, at the same time, it is also observant of\r\nthe duties it owes to the country, and in this finds itself strengthened\r\nto press for the supplies—until the State is settled—necessary for\r\nexisting State institutions and the furtherance of the common weal,\r\nbeing assured that, at the proper time, they will receive the subsequent\r\nsanction of the Diet.”\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the loudly-assailed “budgetless” Government;\r\nat the present day, no one will deny that this was precisely the mildest\r\nform of opposition. A budget had certainly not come into existence,\r\nbut the Government was conscientiously carried on according to the\r\nprinciples of the constitution, as the King desired. It was a severe and\r\nendless battle which now ensued—a strife wearying both body and soul; but\r\nthe Government never appealed to physical force; it was a war of opinions\r\nand convictions, a war of intellectual weapons, such as had never been\r\nseen in the political region of the world’s history, and such as was\r\nreally only possible in Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the most fitting place to draw attention to one point of\r\nBismarck’s policy, that to us does not seem to have been sufficiently\r\nvalued in general, but which at the same time is highly characteristic\r\nof Bismarck’s method; we allude to the great prudence with which he ever\r\nupheld the Sovereignty itself above the conflict. Certainly he fought\r\nfor the Prussian monarchy, on which depended the future of Prussia and\r\nGermany; but the conflict was between him, between the State Government\r\nand the Chamber of Deputies, not between the Crown and the Diet, still\r\nless between the King and the people. If the King could have dispensed\r\nwith the reorganization, it was only necessary to dismiss Bismarck, and\r\nthe crisis existed no longer. Bismarck was personally identified with the\r\ncrisis; in this he might fall, but the Crown remained perfectly secure.\r\nBut in such devotion the constitutional fiction of the irresponsibility\r\nof the King had no part whatever; it was the Brandenburg vassal’s lealty\r\nwhich covered the feudatory lord with its knightly shield. At the end\r\nof October, Bismarck again went to Paris, to take an official leave\r\nat the Tuileries; on the 1st of November he had his farewell audience\r\nof the Emperor Napoleon at Saint Cloud. It could scarcely have failed\r\nthat the conversation turned upon the great task, the accomplishment of\r\nwhich Bismarck had so courageously undertaken. Napoleon had then but\r\nlittle belief in success, and probably pointed to the fate of Prince\r\nPolignac. Bismarck, however, was fully aware of the difference between\r\nthe situations of 1830 in France, and 1862 in Prussia.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the audience he returned to Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN AT THE HELM.\r\n\r\n    Negotiations with Austria.—Circular of the 24th of January,\r\n    1863.—Conversation with Count Karolyi.—Prusso-Russian\r\n    Convention.—The Party of Progress.—Congress of\r\n    Princes.—Conditions of Prussia.—War in the Distance.—The\r\n    Danish Campaign.—Treaty of Gastein, 14th August,\r\n    1865.—Bismarck elevated to the Rank of Count.—Bismarck and\r\n    Pauline Lucca.—Correspondence with his Family.—Hunting at\r\n    Schönbrunn.—Biarritz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe action of history would not fail to solve the conflict, but this\r\nwas only possible if Prussia entered energetically on this action; and\r\nthus we see Bismarck, the man at the helm, steering the Prussian vessel\r\nof State, undismayed by the daily attacks of the Progressists, through\r\nshallows and rocks, firmly and safely towards open water, on which,\r\ndriven by the breath of God into history, it was to fly in full sail\r\ntowards the sunrise of victory.\r\n\r\nImmediately after assuming the Ministry, in December, 1862, Bismarck\r\nentered upon negotiations with Austria. If Austria could decide upon\r\nthe dismissal of that enemy of Prussian policy, Schwarzenberg, and give\r\nPrussia her proper position in Germany and thus insure the same to\r\nGermany as her right. Bismarck was prepared to enter into a coalition\r\nwith Austria; but if Austria could not rise to such a policy, Prussia was\r\ndetermined alone to give the _coup de grace_ to the unhealthy, troubled\r\nstate of things which lay like an Alp on German life, thus terminate\r\nthe unnatural hesitation, and create for Germany a new and healthy body\r\ncorporate.\r\n\r\nWith perfect frankness, as was his peculiar wont, Bismarck explained\r\nhimself to Austria. The latter was at this time engaged with the project\r\nof the so-called delegations to the Bund, i.e., with a reform which was\r\nno reform, but an entirely meaningless absurdity, not even an apparent\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nIn the famous circular dispatch of the 24th of January, 1863, Bismarck\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n“In order to bring about a better understanding of the two Courts, I took\r\nthe initiative in the form of negotiations with Count Karolyi, in which\r\nI brought the following considerations under the notice of the Imperial\r\nAmbassador. According to my convictions, our relations to Austria _must\r\nunavoidably change for the better or the worse_. It is the sincere wish\r\nof the Royal Government that the former alternative should arise; but if\r\nwe should not be met by the Imperial Cabinet with the necessary advances\r\nas we could desire, it will be _necessary for us to contemplate the other\r\nalternative, and prepare for it accordingly_.\r\n\r\n“I have reminded Count Karolyi that, during the decennial period\r\npreceding the events of 1848, there had been a tacit understanding\r\nbetween the two high Powers, by virtue of which Austria was insured the\r\nsupport of Prussia on European questions, and, on the other hand, allowed\r\nus to exercise an influence in Germany, unfettered by the opposition of\r\nAustria, as manifested by the formation of the Customs Union. By these\r\narrangements the German Diet rejoiced in a degree of internal unity\r\nand outward dignity, which has not since then been reached. I have not\r\nalluded to the question as to whose error it was that analogous relations\r\nwere not re-established on the reconstitution of the Diet, as I was\r\nconcerned, not with recriminations for the past, but with a practical\r\ndevelopment of the present time. In the latter we find, in those very\r\nStates with which Prussia, by her geographical position, is interested in\r\nmaintaining special friendly relations, an opposing influence, promoted\r\nby the Imperial Cabinet, with signal results. I put it strongly to Count\r\nKarolyi, that Austria in this manner might, perhaps, win the sympathies\r\nof the governments of those States, but would estrange from herself those\r\nof Prussia, to the detriment of the common interests of the Diet. The\r\nImperial Ambassador consoled himself with the certainty that, in the\r\nevent of any war dangerous to Austria, the two greater powers would,\r\nunder any circumstances, be found together again as allies.\r\n\r\n“_In this assumption_, according to my view, there exists a _dangerous\r\nerror_, which may, perhaps, not become apparent until the decisive\r\nmoment, with a fatal clearness for both Cabinets, and I therefore\r\nbesought Count Karolyi _urgently_ to use all his powers to contradict\r\nthis in Vienna. I pointed out that already, in the last Italian war, the\r\nalliance had not been so valuable to Austria as it might have been if\r\nthe two powers had not, during the preceding eight years, contended with\r\neach other in the field of German politics, in a manner only conclusively\r\nadvantageous to a third party, and so undermined all mutual confidence.\r\nNevertheless, the fact that Prussia did not seek for any advantage in\r\nconsequence of the difficulties of Austria in 1859, but rather armed to\r\nassist Austria in need, clearly shows the results of the _former more\r\nintimate_ relations. But should these last not be renewed and revivified,\r\n_Prussia would, under similar circumstances, be as little debarred\r\nfrom contracting an alliance with an antagonist of Austria_, as, under\r\nopposite circumstances, from forming a faithful and firm alliance with\r\nAustria, against common enemies. _I, at least_, as I did not conceal from\r\nCount Karolyi, _under such circumstances could never advise my gracious\r\nSovereign to neutrality_. Austria is free to choose whether she prefers\r\nto continue her present anti-Prussian policy, with the leverage of the\r\ncoalition of the Central States, or would seek an honest union with\r\nPrussia. That the latter may be the result, is my most sincere desire.\r\nThis can, however, only be obtained by the abandonment of Austria’s\r\ninimical policy at the German Courts.\r\n\r\n“Count Karolyi replied that the Imperial House could not relinquish\r\nher traditional influences on the German Governments. I denied the\r\nexistence of any such tradition by pointing out that _Hanover_ and\r\n_Hesse_ had, for a hundred years—from the commencement of the Seven\r\nYears’ War—been principally guided by Prussian influences; and that, at\r\nthe epoch of Prince Metternich, the same States had also been guided from\r\nVienna, specially in the interest of the understanding between Prussia\r\nand Austria; consequently that the assumed tradition of the Austrian\r\nImperial House _dated only from the time of Prince Schwarzenberg_, and\r\nthe system to which it pertained has not hitherto shown itself conducive\r\nto the consolidation of the German Confederation. I laid stress upon the\r\nfact that, on my arrival in Frankfurt, in 1851, after circumstantial\r\nconversations with Prince Metternich, then residing at Johannisberg, I\r\nhad anticipated that Austria herself would see the wisdom of a policy\r\nwhich would obtain us a position in the German Confederation, consonant\r\nwith the interest of Prussia to throw all her strength into the common\r\ncause. Instead of that, Austria has striven to embitter and impede our\r\nposition in the German Confederation, and, in point of fact, to force us\r\nto seek for allies in other directions. The whole treatment of Prussia\r\non the part of the Vienna Cabinet seems to rest upon the assumption that\r\nwe, more than any other State, are fully exposed to _foreign attacks_,\r\nagainst which we need _foreign assistance_, and that hence we are bound\r\nto put up with _contemptuous treatment_ from those States from whom we\r\nexpect aid. The task of a Prussian Government, having the interests\r\nof the Royal House and of the country at heart, would therefore be,\r\n_to prove the erroneousness of this assumption by deeds_, if words and\r\naspirations are neglected.\r\n\r\n“Our dissatisfaction with the condition of things in the Confederation\r\nhas received fresh aliment during the last few months, from the obstinacy\r\nwith which the German Governments more closely allied with Austria have\r\n_offensively stood out against Prussia_ on the delegate question. Before\r\n1848 it had been unheard of that questions of any magnitude should\r\nhave been introduced in the Confederation, without the concurrence of\r\nthe two great Powers previously being secured. Even in cases where the\r\nopposition had come from the less powerful States, as in the matter of\r\nthe South German fortresses, it had been preferred to allow objects of\r\nsuch importance and urgency to remain unfulfilled for years, rather than\r\nseek to overcome opposition by means of a _majority_. At the present day,\r\nhowever, the _opposition of Prussia_, not only to a proposal in itself,\r\nbut in reference to its _unconstitutionality_, is treated as _an incident\r\nundeserving of notice_, by which no one should be prevented from pursuing\r\na given progress in a deliberately chosen course. I urged upon Count\r\nKarolyi to communicate the contents of the preceding conference to Count\r\nRechberg with the utmost accuracy, although in a confidential sense,\r\nexpressing at the same time my conviction that the wounds sustained by\r\nour mutual relations _can only be healed by unreserved sincerity_.\r\n\r\n“The second conversation took place on the 13th of December of last year,\r\na few days after the former, in consequence of a dispatch of the Royal\r\nAmbassador at the Federal Diet. I visited Count Karolyi in order _to draw\r\nhis attention to the serious state of things at the Diet_, and did not\r\nconceal from him that the further advance of the majority in a course\r\nregarded by us as _unconstitutional_, would bring us into a position\r\n_we could not accept_, and that in the consequences of it we _foresaw\r\nthe violation of the Confederation_; that Herr von Usedom had left the\r\nFreiherr von Kübeck and Baron von der Pfordten in scarcely any doubt as\r\nto the construction which we placed upon the matter, but had received\r\nreplies to his intimations whence we could draw no inferences as to any\r\nwish for a compromise, as Freiherr von der Pfordten pressed strenuously\r\nfor a speedy delivery of our minority vote.\r\n\r\n“Upon this I objected that, under such circumstances, a feeling of our\r\nown dignity would not admit of our _evading_ any longer the conflict\r\ninduced by the other side, and that I had therefore telegraphed the\r\nRoyal Ambassador to deposit his minority vote. I indicated that _passing\r\nover the border of legitimate competency by resolutions of the majority,\r\nwould be regarded by us as a breach of the federal treaties_, and that\r\n_we should mark our sense of the fact_ by the _withdrawal_ of the Royal\r\nAmbassador to the Diet, without nominating any successor; and I drew\r\nattention to the _practical_ consequences likely to ensue upon such a\r\nsituation in a _comparatively short time_, as it would naturally occur\r\nthat the _activity of an assembly_, in which, from just causes, we no\r\nlonger took part, would be regarded by us as inauthoritative on the whole\r\nbusiness sphere of the Diet.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n“A few days after this I was confidentially informed that the Imperial\r\nAustrian Ambassador at St. Petersburg (Count Thun) was about to return\r\nto his post by way of Berlin, and would confer with me upon the pending\r\nquestion. When he arrived, I did not hesitate, despite the recently named\r\nlamentable experiences of an endeavor to meet his communications—made for\r\nthe purpose of some understanding—in the most straightforward manner. I\r\ntherefore declared myself ready to enter upon different projects, agreed\r\nbetween us, for the settlement of the Frankfurt difficulties.... On this\r\nCount Thun proposed to me that an interview between Count Rechberg and\r\nmyself should be arranged, with a view of a further discussion of the\r\nmatter. I declared myself ready to meet him, but in the next few days\r\nreceived from Count Karolyi confidential communications, according to\r\nwhich, Count Rechberg anticipated, before our interview, the declaration\r\nof my adhesion to the reform project in the Diet, regarding which, in my\r\nopinion, it was necessary to have longer and more minute negotiations. As\r\nthe time extending up to the 22d of December was too short for these, I\r\npresumed that it was only possible to employ the proposed conference for\r\nthe consideration of previous and binding treaties.... As Count Rechberg\r\nhereupon declared that Austria could not give up the further negotiation\r\nof the project in reference to the assembly of delegates without some\r\nassured equivalent, the interview until this time has not taken place.”\r\n\r\nClearly as it is here stated, so it happened with all negotiations.\r\nPrussia ever sought to go hand-in-hand with Austria, but Austria\r\never evaded the opportunity. She alleged that it was her intention\r\nto pursue her German policy alone, in her solitary path—the way of\r\nSchwarzenberg—which was to lead, over the entire insignificance of\r\nGermany, to the humiliation and oppression of Prussia. Of course Prussia\r\nthen had no other alternative than to follow its own mission its own\r\nway. To this period belongs the conclusion of the Prusso-Russian treaty\r\non the common measures to be pursued for the suppression of the Polish\r\ninsurrection. This Convention, by which the friendly relations of Prussia\r\nand Russia were confirmed, has been frequently and unintentionally\r\nmisinterpreted. The internal meaning of this, and its reaction, require\r\nsome further explanation which it is not desirable at present to give.[45]\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic campaign, which the other Powers commenced at the instance\r\nof the Convention, it is well known, had no result, and was lost in the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nBut the saddest figure in this business was played by the party of\r\nprogress, who, in their blind zeal, had seized upon the Convention,\r\non the plea that Prussia by this would become nothing higher than an\r\noutpost of Russia. The idea of such a baseless absurdity—had it been\r\nso—would have been laughable, if it had not been too sad to see that the\r\nopposition to Prussia abroad had again been instigated by an allied party\r\nin the actual Prussian camp. This, however, unfortunately was doomed to\r\nbe frequently repeated on later occasions.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1863 Bismarck had accompanied his King to Carlsbad,\r\nand thence to Gastein, when Austria emerged with her new and useless\r\nprojects of reorganization, in which there was a tinge and tendency of\r\nthe inoperative Federal principle, as opposed to Prussian Unionistic\r\nefforts. King William received the invitation to the Congress of Princes\r\nat Gastein, and the Emperor Francis Joseph himself personally handed him\r\na minute memorial on these projects of reform. This contained, although\r\nof course it was not acknowledged by Austria, very little more than the\r\nproject of delegates long since opposed by Prussia, and which in no way\r\ncould content the pretensions of Prussia or the wants of the German\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nKing William, who had gone with his Premier from Gastein, by way of\r\nMunich and Stuttgart, to Baden-Baden, declined to attend the Princes’\r\nCongress at Frankfurt, which was then put up upon the scene with skill\r\nworthy of recognition, even with taste, but had not the slightest\r\nresult, although the princes present at it had accepted the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Austrian project.\r\n\r\nAnd how came it that this illustrious princely congress should have\r\ndeparted to Orcus without any lamentation, so that in only a few weeks no\r\none ever mentioned it again? Simply because Prussia had taken no part in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna it had been thought that Prussia would have been carried\r\naway by it. When that proved unsuccessful, withdrawal was thought\r\nundesirable, and every one had to learn, by bitter experience, that\r\nnothing was possible in Germany without Prussia. Prussia, as usual, had\r\nbeen undervalued, and thus it was revenged; but, nevertheless, Prussia\r\ncontinued to be slightly esteemed, and the vengeance was to be still\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the simplest eyes can see that the rivalry of\r\nPrussia and Austria was now first coming into public sight, ere it was\r\npossible to think of any reconstruction of Germany. Austria had declined\r\nall the propositions of Prussia, which aimed essentially at a peaceable\r\nseparation of Austria from the German Federation, and led to a federal\r\nunion of the newly constructed union, under the leadership of Prussia,\r\nwith Austria, but had replied with the Reform Act, containing within\r\nitself a nullification of Prussia. Austria, and the Central States allied\r\nwith her, had given Prussia the alternatives of unconditional submission,\r\nimmediate nullification, or the exclusion of herself from the new\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\nPrussia, with quiet dignity, perfected this act of self-exclusion; and,\r\nlo! matters did not go on, and the Viennese Reform Act was a blank.\r\n\r\nIn his report to the King’s Majesty of the 15th of September, 1863, and\r\nin the Royal reply to the members of the Princes’ Congress on the 22d of\r\nthe same month, Bismarck promulgated a series of “preliminary conditions”\r\nas to the part Prussia might take in further negotiations.\r\n\r\nHe demanded—1. The “veto of Prussia and Austria at least upon every\r\nfederal war _not undertaken in resistance of an attack_ upon _federal\r\nterritory_;” 2. The “entire _equality_ of Prussia with Austria in the\r\npresidency and government of federal concerns;” and 3. “A national\r\nrepresentation, not to consist of delegates, but of _directly chosen\r\nrepresentatives_, in the ratio of the populations of single States,\r\n_the powers of which, in resolution_, should, _in any case, be more\r\nextensive_ than those in the project for the Frankfurt Reform Act.”\r\nAs a plea for this condition he especially insisted, in his report to\r\nthe King, that “the interests and requirements of the Prussian people\r\nwere essentially and indissolubly identical with those of the _German\r\npeople, wherever this element attained its true construction and value;\r\nPrussia never need fear_ to be drawn into any policy adverse to her\r\nown interests.” Besides these three points, he also maintained that\r\nthe “German sovereigns” were bound either “to learn the opinion of the\r\n_nation itself_ by the _means of chosen representatives_, or to adduce\r\nthe _constitutional sanction of the Diets of each individual State_.”\r\n\r\nBut that Bismarck had fully understood the final and actual ends of the\r\nAustro-Central policy, may be seen from the following sentence of his\r\nreport to the King’s Majesty:—\r\n\r\n“In the entirely remarkable attitude observed by Austria in this\r\ntransaction, it is impossible to avoid the impression that apparently the\r\nImperial Austrian Cabinet _from the commencement contemplated, not the\r\nco-operation of Prussia_ in the common enterprise, but the _realization\r\nof a separate federation as an end_, already visible in the first\r\npropositions of the 3d of August, _in case_ that Prussia would not _join\r\nin_ the Austrian plans.”\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Bismarck, by his firm attitude towards the\r\nCongress of Princes and the Austro-Central policy, has not only saved\r\nthe future of Prussia, but also that of Germany. At that time people\r\nwere so confused and dazzled that it was not at all seen. The small\r\nfights in the Chamber had robbed people of any understanding of the great\r\nthings there accomplished. Bismarck was plainly of opinion that war was\r\nimminent, as may be clearly read from the report on which he founded the\r\ndissolution of the Electoral Chamber of the Diet. It is here said:—“On\r\nthe basis of the German Federal Constitution _attempts_ have come to\r\nlight, the _unmistakable object_ of which is to set down such a power of\r\nthe Prussian State in Germany and in Europe, which forms a well-earned\r\nheritage of the glorious history of our fathers, and which the _Prussian\r\npeople has not at any time resolved to allow to be alienated from it_.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it will be a necessity for his Majesty’s\r\nsubjects at the same time to give _expression to the fact_, at the\r\nforthcoming elections, that no _political difference of opinion_ is so\r\ndeeply rooted in our country that, _in the face of an attempt to bring\r\ndown the independence and dignity of Prussia_, the unity of the nation\r\nand its unalterable fidelity to the governing house can be shaken.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps they in the camp of Austria and its allies reckoned on—decidedly\r\nthey believed in—war; and war certainly came at the time, but in\r\na remarkable way, not between Prussia and Austria, but, to the\r\ninexpressible surprise of the world, Prussia and Austria, hand-in-hand as\r\nallies, took the field against Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly impossible clearly to state how Bismarck succeeded in\r\ninducing Austria to enter upon this war, how he managed to get their old\r\nrival to draw the sword for Prussia’s interest, in exact contradiction to\r\nher entire previous policy. It is quite true to say that the energetic\r\ninitiative of Bismarck carried away Austria with him, but the matter does\r\nnot grow at all clearer for that. It is also not inexact, most certainly,\r\nto affirm that Austrian diplomacy might assert that she was obliged to\r\njoin, in order to watch over Prussia and bridle her; but it was by no\r\nmeans false when the Viennese exclaimed, “That Bismarck drags us by the\r\nhalter!” when Austria went into Holstein, to Schleswig, to Jütland, in\r\nthe interest of Prussia and Germany. No doubt the magic of Austria’s\r\nburning desire to retrieve the Imperial army’s lost prestige, after the\r\nmisfortune of 1859, contributed to this political wonder—the desire of\r\nhanging fresh laurels on the black and yellow standard. Such a crown\r\nthe warriors of Austria honestly won there in the North. Perhaps the\r\ncircumstance that the Emperor of Austria always felt a friendly feeling\r\ntowards Bismarck personally, had additional influence; and there might be\r\na not altogether groundless feeling in existence that the conservative\r\npolicy of Bismarck was not unlikely in some way to exert a favorable\r\ninfluence in Austria. It is said that on one occasion the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph involuntarily exclaimed, when Bismarck was severely blamed in his\r\npresence, “Ah! if _I_ but had him!”\r\n\r\nIf, however, Bismarck thus led Austria to the North as the ally of\r\nPrussia, and thus prevented interferences from other quarters, he also\r\ncreated new difficulties for himself in the sequence of events, which\r\nwere to assume far higher proportions than they usually assumed. He knew\r\nvery well that, after the victory over Denmark, the old quarrel with\r\nAustria would break out again—must break out again; nor could he have\r\nomitted to see that a victorious war, carried on in conjunction with\r\nAustria, could not fail mightily to increase all kinds of sympathies\r\npossessed by Austria in the army, and in conservative Prussia. The deep\r\nabhorrence against any rupture with Austria which Bismarck had to combat\r\nin his own camp, emerged still more into light after the war in a more\r\nanimated way, and rendered his position more difficult from day to day.\r\nAll the traditions of glorious alliance of the great period of the War\r\nof Freedom had become revivified in the hut as in the palace, and they\r\npossessed real power; for it is an unquestionable fact that Austria would\r\nbe the best ally for Prussia from that moment when it determines to allow\r\nPrussia to take her proper position in Germany without malice or envy. It\r\nwas the destiny of Germany that Austria could not resolve to give Prussia\r\nwhat was Prussia’s right; Bismarck’s great political task, however, was\r\nto compel the surrender from Austria of that which is the meed of Prussia\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nThat, however, to which we have alluded, could only become of value\r\nafter victory. In the beginning of the Danish campaign it passed only as\r\na fresh breeze through the sultry political atmosphere of Prussia. The\r\nProgressist party certainly continued in their inimical position, but the\r\npeople themselves began to see daylight; those minds not entirely blinded\r\nby political passion gradually obtained some glimpse of the meaning of\r\nBismarck. The cannon storm of Missunde had awakened Prussian patriotism;\r\nPrussia had never been deaf when the royal trumpet sounded to battle, and\r\nthe Prussian heart has ever stirred when the eagle standards have been\r\nunfolded. This should, however, be attributed to the advantage of the\r\nMinister whose policy led to the battle-field and the victory.[46]\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Frederick Charles had planted Prussia’s standard victoriously\r\non the walls of Düppel in April, 1864, King William himself went to the\r\nNorth to honor his brave warriors. On this triumphant progress Bismarck\r\naccompanied him, and there he might have learnt that he was no longer the\r\nuniversally hated Minister-President, but that this victory had greatly\r\nincreased the number of those who honored him.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the same year he accompanied his royal master to\r\nCarlsbad, and at this time he put the new companionship of Austria to a\r\nsevere trial. Saxon and Hanoverian troops then held the Duchy of Holstein\r\nin the name of the German Confederation. It is fortunate for us that we\r\nneed not enter any farther upon the terrible Schleswig-Holstein question.\r\nBismarck considered it necessary to remove the Saxons and Hanoverians\r\nfrom the Duchies, which Prussia and Austria had won with the sword, and\r\nthat at the peace of Vienna had been ceded to Prussia and Austria by\r\nDenmark. By the removal of the troops of the Central States the matter\r\nwas much simplified, and the question brought a step nearer to solution.\r\nIt was to be expected that Austria, considering her secret treaties\r\nwith the Central States, would receive this step with very evil grace;\r\nbut Bismarck put it into execution, and on the Austrian side it was\r\nallowed to be carried out, although the press was enraged at it—of which\r\nBismarck, who went from Carlsbad through Prague to Vienna, and then to\r\nGastein, was well aware on his journey.\r\n\r\nFrom Gastein Bismarck returned in the King’s train, at the invitation of\r\nthe Emperor of Austria, to Vienna, where he took a share in the great\r\nhunting-parties in the wild park, and had reason to congratulate himself\r\non his skill. On this visit he was received with great distinction by the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph, and received from him the Exalted Order of St.\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna he accompanied the King to Baden, and then went to his\r\npeaceful Reinfeld in Pomerania, but returned again to Baden before going\r\nto Biarritz, where he took sea-baths up till November. After a short stay\r\nin Paris he returned to Berlin. Here he resumed his old battle with the\r\nparty of progress, whose hatred against the Minister-President, as may be\r\nvery readily understood, grew more intense as he showed himself the more\r\ndistinguished and greater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK’S ESTATE IN FARTHER POMERANIA.]\r\n\r\nAfter this “elegantly” conducted war—which was at once an experiment\r\non the newly reorganized army and the needle-gun, and had roused the\r\npatriotically warlike, _i.e._, the real, spirit of Prussia, the King\r\ninvested his Minister-President with the highest mark of honor Prussia\r\ncan bestow—the Exalted Order of the Black Eagle. Among those who felt\r\nobliged epistolarily to congratulate Bismarck on this well-earned\r\ndistinction, was his former preceptor, the Director, Dr. Bonnell. One\r\nevening Bismarck called on him personally to thank him; he sat pleasantly\r\nchatting with Bonnell’s family at the tea-table. In his decisive manner\r\nhe related a great deal about Biarritz, where he had enjoyed himself\r\nthoroughly; lightly alluded to the numerous threatening letters and\r\nwarnings of assassination with which he had been incommoded, but which\r\nhe despised, as no political party had ever yet received any benefit\r\nfrom murder. He then related a dream which he had had in Biarritz. In\r\nthis dream he thought he ascended a mountain path which continually grew\r\nnarrower, until he found himself before a wall of rock, and beside him a\r\ndeep abyss. For an instant he paused, thinking whether he should retrace\r\nhis steps; but he then made up his mind and struck the wall with his\r\ncane, on which it immediately disappeared, and his road was free again.\r\nAfter talking of many things in old and new times, he rose and said, “I\r\nmust go now, or my wife will be uneasy again.”\r\n\r\n“Dreams are seems,” says the proverb, but perhaps not always, and at the\r\npresent time every one knows what the wall was which vanished before\r\nBismarck’s blow.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1865, arrived. By the Vienna peace of the 30th\r\nOctober, 1864, the Duchies of Holstein and Schleswig were ceded to\r\nPrussia and Austria—that is to say, they had returned whither they\r\nbelonged, to Germany. This was, however, especially the result of\r\nthe daring and skillful policy of Bismarck, for such a conquest was\r\nquite against the intention and desire of Austria. It was necessary\r\nnow to deal with this acquisition, and it soon appeared that Austria\r\nwas about to substitute, in place of the great national policy of\r\nBismarck, the ultimate end of which was very openly expressed—to have\r\na German Confederation under the leadership of Prussia—the wretched\r\ndetail of a new Schleswig-Holstein minor state. No doubt that in such\r\na policy Austria only thought of contravening Bismarck’s German\r\npolicy—of rendering the realization of the Bismarck thought of union\r\nan impossibility. Nor was it remarkable that the Central States did\r\nnot support the policy of Bismarck, as they would certainly have to\r\nsacrifice a part of that sovereignty they had so recently acquired to the\r\nnation, if Bismarck’s policy should prove victorious. These sovereigns\r\ncould not determine to recede to the position they had so long held as\r\nGerman Princes of the Empire; they desired to assert their apparent\r\nsovereignty, and they were unable to perceive, that in case Austria\r\nshould prevail, they would become Austria’s vassals at the expense of\r\nthe German nation—at the price of Germany’s future. It was in vain that\r\nBismarck exerted himself at the Federation, as well as at the German\r\nCourts, to introduce more healthy opinions—he could not get forward; and\r\nthe continually abrupter forms in which Austria acted in the conquered\r\nDuchies, admitted of no doubt on his part that the Viennese politicians,\r\nwith the whole of their partisans in Germany, were determined to force\r\nPrussia to submission; to the abandonment of her saving union policy, to\r\nthe acceptance of the Austrian Federation—in fact, to her humiliation and\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nIt was sad enough that Austria, in her inimical action, also reckoned\r\nupon the internal conflict in Prussia, which was the more zealously\r\nstimulated, in proportion as it became clear to the party of progress\r\nthat the heart of the nation was more and more turning to the statesman\r\nwho fought his victories, to the greater fame of Prussia and happiness\r\nof Germany, upon a field whither they were unable to follow him—upon the\r\nfield of honor and of deeds. Of what use in the end was it, that they\r\nsucceeded in victoriously maintaining, by their high-spiced speeches, a\r\nmajority in the Chamber against the Ministry—that they embittered the\r\ndaily life of Bismarck and the other Ministers—and rendered their labors\r\nmore disagreeable, if this Ministry, despite of all, went victoriously on\r\nin the world’s history?—and that Bismarck, though he might not get the\r\nvotes of the majority, won the hearts of the people?\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that Bismarck, in the summer of 1865, already believed\r\nthe hour of the great battle between Prussia and Austria to have arrived,\r\nand that he was determined to stand up manfully for his sound policy,\r\nand with this conviction we arrive at a great riddle—the episode of\r\nGastein.\r\n\r\nBismarck had accompanied the King, in the summer of 1865, to Carlsbad,\r\nthence to Gastein and Salzburg, and so to the Emperor of Austria at Ischl.\r\n\r\nThe deepest veil of secrecy still covers the events which there took\r\nplace; it is true the historian, A. Schmidt,[47] assures us that\r\nalready, on the 15th of July, Bismarck, at Carlsbad, had said to the\r\nFrench Ambassador at the Court of Vienna, the Duc de Grammont, that he\r\nconsidered war between Prussia and Austria to be unavoidable—even that\r\nit had become a necessity. But this is unquestionably untrue—as untrue\r\nas the further statement of the same historian, that Bismarck, on the\r\n23d July, said openly to the Prime Minister of the King of Bavaria, the\r\nFreiherr von der Pfordten, that “in his firm opinion war between Prussia\r\nand Austria was _very likely and close at hand_. It was a question, as\r\nthe matter appeared to him, of a _duel_ between Austria and Prussia only.\r\nThe rest of Germany might stand by and contemplate this duel as _passive\r\nspectators_. Prussia had never contemplated, _and even now did not think\r\nof extending its power beyond the line of the Maine_. The _settlement of\r\nthe controversy_ would not long have to be awaited. _One blow—one pitched\r\nbattle—and Prussia would be in the position to dictate conditions._\r\nThe most urgent need of the Central States was to range themselves on\r\nher side. _Neutrality_, even that of Saxon soil, would be observed by\r\nPrussia. A localization of the war, and that localization confined\r\nto Silesia, was not only determined, but, according to the already\r\nascertained opinions of the most competent military authorities, it was\r\npossible. The Central States, in addition to this, by the proclamation of\r\nneutrality, were an additional means towards securing this centralization\r\nof the war. Bavaria ought, however, to weigh well the fact that she was\r\nthe natural heir of the position of Austria in South Germany.”\r\n\r\nWhat Bismarck really might have said to Freiherr von der Pfordten is not\r\nrecognizable in this acceptation at all.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of August the treaty of Gastein was concluded, which divided\r\nthe co-domination of Prussia and Austria in Holstein and Schleswig. This\r\ntreaty compelled Austria to leave the Central States a second time in an\r\nambiguous position; the Central States might have learned from the fact\r\nhow little really was cared for them at Vienna. This knowledge they had\r\ndearly to pay for a year later!\r\n\r\nWhat could have induced Bismarck to conclude this truce—for the treaty\r\nof Gastein was nothing else? Who can positively say? To the present time\r\nit is an enigma not yet solved. Did military exigencies influence the\r\nmatter? was the season too far advanced? did European politics stand in\r\nthe way? or the unconcluded negotiations with Italy? was there a threat\r\nof intervention on the other side? had the old sympathies for Austria\r\nin Prussia, so greatly stimulated by the recent common campaign, to be\r\nrespected? did King William follow up the old traditional partiality for\r\nAustria? did the King and his Minister wish to give Austria a last term\r\nof grace, hoping that Viennese politics might change at the twelfth hour?\r\nor did the purchase of the Duchy of Lauenburg afford any loophole of\r\nescape?\r\n\r\nPerhaps all these questions should be answered in the affirmative. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the treaty became a last experiment, as to whether it\r\nwas possible for Prussia to go hand-in-hand with Austria. It must not,\r\nhowever, be forgotten that this much-deprecated treaty was very favorable\r\nto Prussia. Despite the co-domination, Prussia already, by geographical\r\nposition, remained master in the Duchies, and was always stronger.\r\n\r\nFrom Austria, Bismarck went with the King, by way of Munich and\r\nFrankfurt, to the Rhine, visited Baden-Baden and Homburg, attended the\r\ngreat review in the province of Saxony, near Merseburg, and then set out\r\nfor the Duchy of Lauenburg, the special Minister of which he is, and\r\nfinally sought for recreation at Biarritz.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th September, 1865, he was raised to the rank of a Prussian\r\nCount.\r\n\r\nA short time after he had returned to Berlin by way of Paris he was taken\r\nill, and remained an invalid throughout the winter, although he carried\r\non business during the whole time with his accustomed energy.\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs a little episode, which we should not mention\r\nat all, did it not show very thoroughly how idle it is to trust rumor,\r\nand had, on the other hand, given Bismarck an opportunity to write a\r\nletter to his old friend André von Roman, which soon appeared in the\r\nBerlin newspapers. A photographer at Gastein had issued a picture of\r\nCount Bismarck, and beside him the royal singer, Pauline Lucca. At this\r\nconjunction many friends of Bismarck were very angry; all sorts of\r\nnonsense was talked on the matter, and at last M. André felt himself\r\ncompelled to write to Bismarck about it. Bismarck thus replied:—\r\n\r\n                                       Berlin, 26th December, 1865.\r\n\r\n    DEAR ANDRÉ,—Although my time is very much taken up, I can\r\n    not refrain from replying to an interpellation made by an\r\n    honest heart, in the name of Christ. I am very sorry if I\r\n    offend believing Christians, but I am certain that this is\r\n    unavoidable for me in my vocation. I will not say that in the\r\n    camps politically opposed to me there are doubtless numerous\r\n    Christians far in advance of me in the way of grace, and with\r\n    whom, by reason of what is terrestrial to us in common, I am\r\n    obliged to live at war; I will only refer to what you yourself\r\n    say.\r\n\r\n      “In wider circles nought of deeds or idleness remains concealed.”\r\n\r\n    What man breathes who in such a position must not give offense,\r\n    justly or unjustly? I will even admit more, for your expression\r\n    as to concealment is not accurate. I would to God that, besides\r\n    what is known to the world, I had not other sins upon my soul,\r\n    for which I can only hope for forgiveness in a confidence upon\r\n    the blood of Christ! As a statesman, I am not sufficiently\r\n    disinterested; in my own mind I am rather cowardly, and that\r\n    because it is not easy always to get that clearness on the\r\n    questions coming before me, which grows upon the soil of divine\r\n    confidence. Whoever calls me an unconscientious politician does\r\n    me injustice; he should try his own conscience first himself\r\n    upon this arena. As to the Virchow business, I am beyond the\r\n    years in which any one takes counsel in such matters from flesh\r\n    and blood; if I set my life on any matter, I do it in the\r\n    same faith in which I have, by long and severe strife, but in\r\n    honest and humble prayer to God, strengthened myself, and in\r\n    which no human words, even if spoken by a friend in the Lord\r\n    and a servant of His Church, can alter me. As to attendance at\r\n    church, it is untrue that I never visit the house of God. For\r\n    seven months I have been either absent or ill; who therefore\r\n    can have observed me? I admit freely that it might take place\r\n    more frequently, but it is not owing so much to want of time,\r\n    as from a care for my health, especially in winter; and to\r\n    those who feel themselves justified to be my judges in this, I\r\n    will render an account—they will believe, even without medical\r\n    details. As to the Lucca photograph, you would probably be less\r\n    severe in your censure, if you knew to what accident it owes\r\n    its existence. The present Frau von Radden (Mdlle. Lucca),\r\n    although a singer, is a lady of whom, as much as myself, there\r\n    has never been any reason to say at any time such unpermitted\r\n    things. Notwithstanding this, I should, had I in a quiet moment\r\n    thought of the offense which this joke has given to many\r\n    and faithful friends, have withdrawn myself from the field\r\n    of the glass pointed at us. You perceive, from the detailed\r\n    manner in which I reply to you, that I regard your letter\r\n    as well-intentioned, and by no means place myself above the\r\n    judgment of those with whom I share a common faith. But, from\r\n    your friendship and your own Christian feeling, I anticipate\r\n    that you will recommend to my judges prudence and clemency in\r\n    similar matters for the future—of this we all stand in need.\r\n    If among the multitude of sinners who are in need of the glory\r\n    of God, I hope that His grace will not deprive me of the\r\n    staff of humble faith in the midst of the dangers and doubts\r\n    of my calling, by which I endeavor to find out my path. This\r\n    confidence shall neither find me deaf to censorious words of\r\n    friendly reproof, nor angry with loveless and proud criticism.\r\n    In haste, yours,\r\n\r\n                                                          BISMARCK.\r\n\r\nAlthough this letter may have become public by an indiscretion which,\r\nunder other circumstances, we should have deplored, we openly declare\r\nhere that we do not regret the publication; and our readers will be of\r\nour opinion, without its being necessary to say more on the subject, or\r\nto qualify the contents of the letter.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter with some letters of Bismarck, written by him\r\nin his summer journeys of 1863, ’4, and ’5, when chiefly in attendance on\r\nthe King, to his family, and generally to his wife.\r\n\r\n                                          Carlsbad, 7th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    —— has my warmest sympathy; to lose children is worse than\r\n    dying, it is so against the order of things. But however long\r\n    it may last, one follows them. I have to-day had a very sunny\r\n    walk, from twelve to two, along the Schweitzerthal, behind the\r\n    Military Hospital, upward, and by Donitz on the Eger, above\r\n    Carlsbad and the hills; then to the King, who, thank God, is\r\n    getting on well, with three glasses of the waters. I am now\r\n    living at the “Schild,” right opposite the Hirschen Sprung, and\r\n    from my back windows I can see Otto’s Höhe, Drei Kreuzberg,\r\n    etc. It is very fine, and I am very well, but sometimes have\r\n    a longing for home; to be with you in Reinfeld, and leave the\r\n    whole Minister-world behind me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Carlsbad, 13th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I think I shall to-morrow go to Schwarzenberg, and thence to\r\n    the dusty Wilhelm Strasse, and remain there two days, and then\r\n    meet the King either at Ratisbon or Salzburg, and go with him\r\n    to Gastein. How long I shall remain there we shall see. I\r\n    shall often long to be here again, amidst Aberg, Esterhazyweg,\r\n    Hammer, Kehrwiederweg, and Aich, and I always knew how to get\r\n    comfortably rid of acquaintances, or, when I met any, to hide\r\n    myself in the bushes. To-day I have been at work nearly all day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           Berlin, 17th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Since the evening, of the day before yesterday I have been\r\n    vegetating in our empty halls, smothered under the avalanche\r\n    of papers and visits which tumbled in upon me as soon as my\r\n    arrival was known. I am now going into the garden for half an\r\n    hour, and just give you this sign of life. Yesterday I had a\r\n    Russian dinner, to-day a French one. To-morrow I leave by way\r\n    of Dresden, Prague, and Pilsen, for Ratisbon, back to the King,\r\n    and stay with him at Gastein.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Nürnberg, 19th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether I shall send this thick paper off from\r\n    here, but I happen to have an unemployed moment, which I use\r\n    to tell you that I am well. I yesterday went from Berlin\r\n    to Dresden, have visited B. and R., who desire their best\r\n    remembrances (Countess R. also); I then slept at Leipzig for\r\n    three hours only, but very well, and after five o’clock came on\r\n    here, where I must await a train which is to bring me, about\r\n    eleven at night, to the King at Ratisbon. N. N. has desired the\r\n    presence of all sorts of people here, with whom I wish to have\r\n    nothing to do, and for this purpose he has engaged the best\r\n    hotel. I therefore selected another, which, as yet, has made\r\n    no very favorable impression on me; better paper than this it\r\n    does not possess. Add to this, that Engel has not a clean shirt\r\n    in the bag, and my things are at the station, so that I sit\r\n    here in railway dust and discomfort, waiting for a dinner, most\r\n    probably bad of its kind.\r\n\r\n    Travelling agrees with me admirably; but it is very annoying to\r\n    be stared at like a Japanese at every station. Incognito and\r\n    its comforts have passed away, until some day, like others,\r\n    I shall have had my day, and somebody else has the advantage\r\n    of being the object of general ill-will. I should have been\r\n    very glad to go viâ Vienna to Salzburg, where the King will be\r\n    to-morrow. I could have lived our wedding-tour over again, but\r\n    political reasons dissuaded me; people would have attributed\r\n    God knows what plans to me, if I had reached there at the same\r\n    time as ——. I shall, no doubt, see R. by chance at Gastein or\r\n    Salzburg. I must finish this although my soup has not yet come;\r\n    but I can not get on upon this paper, with a steel pen besides,\r\n    or I shall get cramp in the fingers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Salzburg, 22d July, 6 A.M.\r\n\r\n    From this charming little town I must write you the date\r\n    at least, in the moment of my departure. The Roons are all\r\n    below, waiting to say good-bye. Yesterday we were at Königsee,\r\n    Edelweiss, and Bartholomäus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Gastein, 24th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I wanted to send you Edelweiss herewith, but it is mislaid.\r\n    Salzachofen I thought more imposing ten years ago. The weather\r\n    was too fine. The road hither, which you did not see, is\r\n    pretty, but not imposing. I here live opposite the King at the\r\n    Waterfall—a child to that at Golling. I only saw two finer in\r\n    the Pyrenees, but none greater. I have taken two baths, very\r\n    pleasant, but tiring afterwards, unfitting one for work. From\r\n    to-morrow I shall bathe only at mid-day, and write before.\r\n    The air is charming, but the neighborhood rather imposing than\r\n    friendly. The King is well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Gastein, 28th July, 1863.\r\n\r\n    As this day sixteen years ago brought sunshine into my wild\r\n    bachelor life, so to-day it has rejoiced this valley, and I\r\n    have seen it on a morning walk for the first time in all its\r\n    beauty. Moritz would call it a giant dish full of cabbage,\r\n    narrow and deep, the edges set round with white eggs. Steep\r\n    sides, some thousand feet high, covered with furze and\r\n    meadow-green, and huts of thatch, strewed here and there up to\r\n    the snow-line, the whole surrounded by a wreath of white peaks\r\n    and bands, richly powdered with snow during five rainy days,\r\n    and the lower frontier of which the sun is causing gradually\r\n    to grow higher. Dozens of silver threads run through the green\r\n    from above—little water streams, tumbling down hastily, as if\r\n    they were too late for the great fall which they make with\r\n    the Ache close before my dwelling. The Ache is a river with\r\n    somewhat more water than the Stolpe has near Strellin, and\r\n    waltzes swiftly through all Gastein, falling down at different\r\n    levels some hundreds of feet between rocks.\r\n\r\n    It is possible to live here in such weather, but I should\r\n    prefer to have nothing to do, only to walk about on the\r\n    heights, and sit down upon sunny banks, smoke, and look at the\r\n    rocky snow-peaks through the telescope. There is little society\r\n    here. I only mix with the retinue of the King, with whom\r\n    dinner and tea bring me in daily contact. The rest of the time\r\n    scarcely suffices for work, sleeping, bathing, and walking.\r\n    I yesterday evening visited old —— with the Emperor, who is\r\n    expected on the second. N. N. will come, and will complain to\r\n    me that lying is the curse of this world. I have just heard\r\n    that the King (who is very well, only he has hurt his ankle,\r\n    and must sit still) keeps the courier till to-morrow, and this\r\n    letter will not reach by post any sooner, as it would lose a\r\n    day by being opened. I shall therefore leave it. Good Prince\r\n    Frederick was yesterday released from his sufferings: the King\r\n    was much overcome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                            Gastein, 2d Aug., 1863.\r\n\r\n    Bill’s day was kept by me in fine weather, and the King was\r\n    informed; he asked how old he was, and how industrious his\r\n    godson might be. To-day the Emperor is coming, flags and\r\n    garlands are the order of the day, the sun is shining, and\r\n    I have not yet been out of my room; have been writing for\r\n    three hours, therefore no more than hearty greetings. If I\r\n    do not write by way of Berlin, I fall into the hands of the\r\n    post-office here—certainly I write no secrets, but it is very\r\n    unpleasant. The mare is in Berlin again. I bathe every day; it\r\n    is agreeable, but tiring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Gastein, 12th Aug., 1863.\r\n\r\n    I am very well, but the couriers are in terror in all\r\n    directions. Yesterday I shot two chamois at an elevation of\r\n    seven thousand feet—quite cooked, despite the height. On the\r\n    15th we leave here for Salzburg—the 16th, Stuttgart—17th,\r\n    Baden. On account of the Frankfurt nonsense I can not leave the\r\n    King.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          Gastein, 14th Aug., 1863.\r\n\r\n    In order that you may see whether it is really quicker, I send\r\n    this letter by the post, the courier starting at the same time.\r\n    I have been writing for four hours, and have got so tired that\r\n    I can hardly hold my pen. There has been a hot sun for a week,\r\n    in the evenings storm. The King is well, but the baths have\r\n    shaken him; he bathes daily, and works as if he were in Berlin;\r\n    there is no saying any thing to him. God grant it may go well\r\n    with him! To-day I take my last bath—twenty or twenty-one in\r\n    all, in twenty-six days. I am very well, but worked to death. I\r\n    am so engaged that I can see very few people. To-morrow evening\r\n    we sleep at Salzburg—on the 16th, probably at Munich—the 17th,\r\n    at Stuttgart, Constance, or Baden; it is uncertain. Write to\r\n    Baden, where I shall probably stay a few days. A letter came\r\n    from —— at Spa; perhaps I shall visit her there, but who knows\r\n    _ce qu’on devient_ in a week? Perhaps every thing will be\r\n    different.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                            Baden, 28th Aug., 1863.\r\n\r\n    I really long to spend a lazy day among you; here, on the most\r\n    charming days, I never get away from ink. Yesterday I went\r\n    for a walk till midnight, in the loveliest moonlight, through\r\n    the fields, but can not get business out of my head; society\r\n    also gives no rest. N. N. is charming to see, but talks too\r\n    much politics to me; —— naturally is always full of rumors;\r\n    ——, who is usually so delightful to me, has people about her\r\n    who disturb my satisfaction; and new acquaintances are very\r\n    troublesome. A. is especially pleasant. With him and E., who\r\n    is here for two days, I yesterday dined in my apartment. The\r\n    King is well, but besieged by intrigue. To-day I dine with Her\r\n    Majesty the Queen. Schleinitz is here, Hohenzollern expected,\r\n    Goltz gone to Paris. I think the King will not leave here till\r\n    Sunday; a few days later I must be in Berlin; perhaps I shall\r\n    have time in between for a trip to Spa, where I shall find O.\r\n    Perhaps I shall have to go to the Queen of England, whom the\r\n    King proposes to visit at Rosenau, near Coburg. In any case,\r\n    I hope to have a few days free in September for Pomerania. I\r\n    wish that some intrigue would necessitate another Ministry, so\r\n    that I might honorably turn my back upon this ewer of ink, and\r\n    live quietly in the country. The restlessness of this existence\r\n    is unbearable; for ten weeks I have had secretary’s work at an\r\n    inn, and again at Berlin. It is no life for an honest country\r\n    nobleman, and I regard every one as a benefactor who seeks\r\n    to bring about my fall. With this the flies are humming and\r\n    tickling and stinging all over the room, so that I really want\r\n    a change in my position, which in a few minutes the Berlin\r\n    train will certainly bring me, by a courier with fifty empty\r\n    dispatches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Berlin, 4th September, 1863.\r\n\r\n    At last I find a moment to write to you. I had hoped to have a\r\n    few days of recreation at Kröchlendorff, but it is all the old\r\n    treadmill over again; last night work till one o’clock, and I\r\n    then poured the ink over it instead of sand, so that it ran\r\n    down over my knees. To-day the Ministers were here at nine,\r\n    and for the second time at one, and with them the King. The\r\n    question for discussion was the dissolution of the Chamber, for\r\n    which I had no heart. But it could not be otherwise; God knows\r\n    what the use of it is. Now we shall have the Electoral swindle!\r\n    With God’s help I am well through it all; but an humble\r\n    reliance on God is required, not to despair of the future of\r\n    our country. May He, above all, grant our King good health! It\r\n    is not very pleasant in this empty house, but I do not notice\r\n    it on account of work. The horses have arrived to-day in much\r\n    better condition. The trouble about the mare was groundless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Bukow, 21st September, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I wished to-day, on the last day of summer, to write you a\r\n    very comfortable and reasonable letter, and full of this idea\r\n    lay down on the sofa three hours ago, but only woke a quarter\r\n    of an hour before dinner, which is about six. At seven I had\r\n    gone out to ride until half-past one, in the capacity of “Herr\r\n    Oberstwachtmeister,” to see our brave soldiers burn powder\r\n    and form attacks. I first joined Fritz, who commanded three\r\n    regiments of cavalry, then went over to the Garde du Corps,\r\n    stormed like a man over stock and block, and for a long time\r\n    have had no pleasanter day. I am living next to the King, and\r\n    two adjutants in a nice old house of Count Hemming’s; it is\r\n    a pretty neighborhood, with hillocks, lakes, and woods, and,\r\n    above all, there is nothing to do, after finishing my business\r\n    with —— yesterday. To-morrow, I am sorry to say, I must go on\r\n    the treadmill again: and now to dinner, having slept myself\r\n    quite stupid, and wrenched my neck on the steep sofa. We\r\n    had twenty persons at table, all sorts of foreign officers,\r\n    Englishmen, Russians, besides the whole Federation in the\r\n    house. I have no mufti clothes with me, so for forty-eight\r\n    hours am wholly a major.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Berlin, 29th September, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I was so far ready on Saturday that I had only an interview\r\n    with the King before me, and hoped to be with you on Sunday\r\n    at noon. But the interview led to my having four hours of\r\n    autograph work, and the necessity of seeing the King before\r\n    his departure for Baden. There was just time for one day at\r\n    Kröchlendorff, whither I repaired on Saturday evening, after\r\n    writing myself crooked and lame, to reach there at midnight.\r\n    Yesterday morning drove to Passow, reached the King by five,\r\n    and at a quarter to eight attended him to the railroad.\r\n    To-day I accompany Moritz and Roon to Freienwalde, must see\r\n    Bernhard about Kniephof, and hope to come to you the day after\r\n    to-morrow, if there should remain time enough to make it worth\r\n    while. I am to follow the King to Baden; the “when” will be\r\n    first known from our correspondence and the business in hand.\r\n    If there should be time enough for me to remain two or three\r\n    days at Reinfeld, I will come; if not, the harness-makers will\r\n    preponderate over my rest, and I shall see you again here in\r\n    Berlin. On the 17th I then shall probably return with the King\r\n    from Cologne. M. is sitting opposite, and is working out at my\r\n    table a joint matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Berlin, 27th October, 1863.\r\n\r\n    It is bitterly cold, but I am quite well. Are you also making\r\n    fires up at Reinfeld? I hope so; we have been doing so here\r\n    for more than a week. Yesterday, after dinner, I sat with K.\r\n    in the blue saloon, and he was playing when I received your\r\n    letter of Sunday. Indeed, the letter you wrote was written in\r\n    quite a holiday humor. Believe in God, my heart, and on the\r\n    proverb that barking dogs do not bite. I did not accompany the\r\n    King to Stralsund, it being a tiring journey, and would retard\r\n    my work for two days. This evening His Majesty has returned:\r\n    the threats against his life are far more menacing than those\r\n    directed against me; but this, too, is in the hands of God. Do\r\n    not allow the last few fine days to be dimmed by care; and if\r\n    you are coming, send some feminine being in advance to arrange\r\n    every thing as you wish it. I must go to work. Farewell! This\r\n    morning, at nine, only three degrees,[48] and a hot sun. The\r\n    inclosed[49] I have twice received this morning from two\r\n    different quarters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                    Babelsberg, 1st November, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I employ a moment in which I am awaiting the King, who is\r\n    dining at Sans-Souci, to write a line as if from Zarskoe or\r\n    Peterhof, only to say that I am well, and am heartily rejoiced\r\n    that I shall soon see you ruling again in the empty apartments\r\n    at Berlin. On the 9th comes the Diet, with all its worry; but I\r\n    think, on the day of the opening, I shall go with His Majesty\r\n    to Letzlingen, and pass two days in the woods. During that time\r\n    you will, I hope, have done with the hammering and dragging,\r\n    the necessary accompaniment of your beloved advent, and on my\r\n    return I shall then find every thing in the right place.\r\n\r\n    For the last few days I have been living alone, and\r\n    industrious, have generally dined alone, and, except for a\r\n    ride, have not left the house; have been quiet and bored;\r\n    occasionally there has been a Council of Ministers. This week\r\n    we shall probably have them daily in the matter of our dear\r\n    Chambers; and as the King has been a week in Stralsund and\r\n    Blankenburg, plenty of work has accumulated. I just hear his\r\n    carriage-wheels, and close with hearty greetings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           Carlsbad, Tuesday, 1864.\r\n\r\n    God be thanked that you are all well; so am I, but more than\r\n    ever engaged. At Zwickau on the Perron I met Rechberg; we came\r\n    on together in one coupé and carriage to this place; thus we\r\n    talked politics for six hours, and for the first time here.\r\n    Yesterday evening at tea with the Grand Duchess, King Otho,\r\n    Archduke Charles Frederick, many diplomatists, and much work\r\n    with R.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Carlsbad, 20th July, 1864.\r\n\r\n    The King has just set out for Marienbad, through espaliers of\r\n    beautiful ladies, with giant bouquets, which more than filled\r\n    his carriage. R. with “_Vivats_,” “hurrah!” great excitement.\r\n    For me there is now some leisure, all my acquaintances being\r\n    gone. To-morrow morning early for Vienna; we shall sleep at\r\n    Prague. Perhaps in a week we shall have peace with the Danes;\r\n    perhaps this winter again war. I shall make my stay in Vienna\r\n    as short as possible, to lose as few baths as possible at\r\n    Gastein. After that, I shall probably accompany the King again\r\n    to Vienna, then to Baden; then the Emperor of Russia is coming\r\n    to Berlin in the beginning of September. Before that time there\r\n    is no prospect of rest—if then.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                            Vienna, 22d July, 1864.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday morning I came with —— and —— and two others, who\r\n    lend me their calligraphic aid, from Carlsbad, in a carriage as\r\n    far as Prague; thence by railway hither to-day; unfortunately\r\n    this time not to go by water to Linz, especially to worry\r\n    myself and others. I am living with —— for the present; have\r\n    seen nobody but R. I was rain-bound for two hours in the\r\n    Volksgarten, and listened to music. Stared at by the people\r\n    as if I was a new hippopotamus for the Zoological Gardens, for\r\n    which I consoled myself with some very good beer. How long\r\n    I shall remain here I can not tell; to-morrow I have many\r\n    visits to pay; dine with R. in the country; then, if possible,\r\n    conclude peace with Denmark, and fly as swiftly as possible, to\r\n    the mountain in Gastein. I wish it were all over. The two days\r\n    of journeying have somewhat mentally rested me, but in body I\r\n    am very tired, and say good-night to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           Vienna, 27th July, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I have received one letter from you here, and long for the\r\n    second. I lead an industrious life—four hours a day with tough\r\n    Danes, and am not at the end yet. By Sunday it must be settled\r\n    whether we are to have peace or war. Yesterday I dined with\r\n    M——; a very agreeable wife, and pretty daughters. We drank a\r\n    good deal, were very merry, which is not often the case in\r\n    their sorrow, of which you are aware. He has grown gray and\r\n    has cut his hair short. Yesterday, after the conference, I\r\n    dined with the Emperor at Schönbrunn, took a walk with R—— and\r\n    W——, and thought of our moonlight expedition. I have just been\r\n    for an hour in the Volksgarten, unfortunately not incognito,\r\n    as I was seventeen years ago—stared at by all the world. This\r\n    existence on the stage is very unpleasant when one wishes to\r\n    drink a glass of beer in peace. On Saturday I hope to leave for\r\n    Gastein, whether it is peace or no. It is too hot for me here,\r\n    particularly at night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Gastein, 6th August, 1864.\r\n\r\n    Work gets continually worse; and here, where I can do nothing\r\n    in the morning after the bath, I do not know when to get time\r\n    for any thing. Since my arrival on the 2d, in a storm with\r\n    hailstones as hard as bullets, I have just been able, in\r\n    magnificent weather, for the first time, to go out by rule. On\r\n    my return, I wish to employ the half-hour at my disposal in\r\n    writing to you. A—— was, however, here immediately, with plans\r\n    and telegrams, and I must be off to the King. I am, however,\r\n    by the blessing of God, quite well. I have had four baths, but\r\n    shall hardly get more than eleven, as the King sets out on the\r\n    15th. Since yesterday I have been very comfortably lodged, as\r\n    a large cool corner room, with a magnificent landscape, was\r\n    vacant; until then I had-been living in a sun-blinding oven,\r\n    at least by day. The nights are pleasantly fresh. The King\r\n    probably goes hence to Vienna in short day journeys, by way\r\n    of Ischl, and thence to Baden. Whether I shall accompany him\r\n    to the latter place is uncertain. I still hope to get away\r\n    for a few days to my quiet Pomerania; but what is the use of\r\n    plans?—something always comes in between. I have not a gun with\r\n    me, and every day there is a chamois-hunt; certainly, I have\r\n    also had no time. To-day seventeen were shot, and I was not\r\n    there; it is a life like that of Leporello:—\r\n\r\n      “Neither rest by day or night,\r\n      Naught to make my comfort right.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                        7th August.\r\n\r\n    Just now I had the whole room full of ladies, flying from the\r\n    rain, which relieves guard with the sun to-day. Fr—— from R——,\r\n    with, two cousins, Frau von P——, a Norwegian. I have long since\r\n    heard no feminine voice, not since Carlsbad. Farewell!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                     Schönbrunn, 20th August, 1864.\r\n\r\n    It is too strange that I should be living in the rooms on the\r\n    ground-floor, abutting on the private reserved garden where,\r\n    very nearly seventeen years ago, we intruded in the moonlight.\r\n    If I look over my right shoulder I can see, through a glass\r\n    door, the dark beech clump-hedge by which we wandered, in\r\n    the secret delight of the forbidden, up to the glass window\r\n    behind which I am living. It was then inhabited by the\r\n    Empress, and I now repeat our walk by moonlight at greater\r\n    ease. The day before the day before yesterday I left Gastein;\r\n    slept at Radstedt. The day before yesterday went, in misty\r\n    weather, to Aussee—a charmingly situated place; a beautiful\r\n    lake, half Traunsee and half Königssee; at sunset reached the\r\n    Hallstädtersee; thence, by boat, in the night, to Hallstadt,\r\n    where we slept. Next morning was pleasant and sunny; at noon we\r\n    reached the King at Ischl, and so, with His Majesty, over the\r\n    Traunsee to Gmunden, where we passed the night, and I thought a\r\n    great deal of L——, H——, and B——, and all those times. To-day,\r\n    by steamer, hither, arriving about six, passing two hours\r\n    with R——, after convincing myself that —— is one of the most\r\n    beautiful women, of whom all pictures give a false idea. We\r\n    stay here three days; what follows, whether Baden or Pomerania,\r\n    I cam not yet foresee. I am now heartily tired, so wish you and\r\n    all of ours good-night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                              Schönbrunn, Thursday.\r\n\r\n    The King went early this morning to Salzburg; I follow him\r\n    to-morrow. This morning I killed fifty-three pheasants, fifteen\r\n    hares, and one karinckel; and yesterday eight stags and two\r\n    moufflons. I am quite lame in hand and cheek from shooting.\r\n    To-morrow evening it will be decided whether I am to go to\r\n    Baden, but now I go to bed. Good-night all, for I am very tired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Baden, 1st September, 1864.\r\n\r\n    The King arrived this morning from Mainau, well and cheerful,\r\n    having been through the rain with the Queen to the races.\r\n    A.’s busy hand continually shakes over me new blessings of\r\n    projects, as soon as I have worked through the old ones. I do\r\n    not know whence I wrote to you last; I have hardly come to my\r\n    senses since Vienna; slept one night in Salzburg, the second\r\n    at Munich; conferred much and lengthily with N. N., who has\r\n    grown thin. I then slept at Augsburg, and thence came, by way\r\n    of Stuttgart, to this place, in the hope of passing two days\r\n    in lazy rest, but only had two hours’ intermission in the\r\n    forest yesterday morning. Couriers, ink, audiences, and visits,\r\n    constantly buzz round me without interruption. —— is also here.\r\n    I dare not show myself on the promenade; no one leaves me at\r\n    peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                   Frankfurt, 11th September, 1864.\r\n\r\n    It is long since I have written to you hence, and never from\r\n    the Zeil. We alighted at the Russian Embassy; the King has\r\n    driven to the Emperor Alexander at Jugenheim; thence he visits\r\n    the Empress Eugénie at Schwalbach, and I have got myself free\r\n    for a day, which I spend with K. at Heidelberg. I accompany\r\n    her to Heidelberg, shall be back here about two or three—time\r\n    enough to devote myself to the Diet; to-morrow morning early to\r\n    Berlin, whence, after the necessary cavilling, I shall start\r\n    for Pomerania.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Bordeaux, 6th October, 1864.\r\n\r\n    Excuse this scrawl, but I have no paper at hand, and only\r\n    wish to apprise you that I have reached this place safely. It\r\n    seems almost like a dream to be here again. Yesterday morning\r\n    I started from Baden, slept very well at Paris, set out this\r\n    morning about eleven, and now at eleven P.M. am here. I think\r\n    of leaving for Bayonne to-morrow morning at eight, to reach\r\n    Biarritz by two. In Paris it was still cold; in Baden yesterday\r\n    there was an early frost; on this side of the Loire things grew\r\n    better; here it is decidedly warm—warmer than any night this\r\n    year. I am, in fact, already quite well, and would be _quite_\r\n    cheerful if I only knew that all was well with you. At Paris I\r\n    felt very much inclined to live there again; he had arranged\r\n    the house there very well, and the life I lead in Berlin is\r\n    a kind of penal servitude when I think of my independent life\r\n    abroad. If it agree with me, I think I shall take about fifteen\r\n    baths, so that on the 21st or 22d I shall set out on my return\r\n    journey; if God wills, you will then be—or perhaps somewhat\r\n    earlier—at Berlin. In his care, Engel has locked me in; there\r\n    is no bell, and this letter will lose a day, as it can not be\r\n    sent to the post to-night. It is so warm that I have the window\r\n    open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                       Biarritz, 9th October, 1864.\r\n\r\n    When I remember how assiduously we lighted fires in Baden, and\r\n    even in Paris, and that here the sun graciously requests me\r\n    to take off my paletot and drawers, that we sat till ten by\r\n    the sea in the moonlight, and this morning breakfast in the\r\n    open air, and that I am writing to you at the open window,\r\n    looking at the blue and sunny sea, and on bathing folks who are\r\n    wandering about in very slight costumes, paddling with naked\r\n    feet in the water, I can not help saying that southern nations\r\n    possess a peculiar grace of God in their climate. I shall not\r\n    yet bathe more than once, but shall soon venture upon two, if\r\n    not, _à la_ ——, upon more. The only comfort I require is to\r\n    hear from you. If we were free people, I should propose to you\r\n    to come with child and baggage to this place, and remain here\r\n    the whole winter, as many of the English do, from reasons of\r\n    economy, which prevails here in the winter season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Biarritz, 12th October, 1864.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SISTER,—I am so delightfully disengaged that I can\r\n    send a few lines in the direction of my thoughts! I am well,\r\n    particularly since I have yesterday and to-day at last received\r\n    news of Johanna’s gradual recovery. I reached here on the\r\n    forenoon of the 7th—in Paris we still had fires, from Bordeaux\r\n    an agreeable temperature, and here heat so that summer clothing\r\n    was necessary. Since yesterday there has been a north wind,\r\n    and it is cooler, but still warmer than I have felt it all\r\n    the summer. A very light summer coat was too hot for me on\r\n    my evening’s walk by the shore. Until now I have taken seven\r\n    baths, and now proceed with two _per diem_. I am writing to you\r\n    by the open window, with flickering lights, and the moonlit sea\r\n    before me, the plash of which is accompanied by the carriage\r\n    bells on the road to Bayonne. The lighthouse in front of me\r\n    changes its light from red to white, and I am looking with some\r\n    appetite at the clock, to see whether the dinner hour of seven\r\n    has not arrived. I have not for a long time found myself in\r\n    such comfortable climatic and business conditions, and yet the\r\n    evil habit of work has rooted itself so deeply in my nature\r\n    that I feel some disquiet of conscience at my laziness—almost\r\n    long for the Wilhelm Strasse, at least if my dear ones were\r\n    there. “_Monsieur, le diner est servi_,” is the announcement.\r\n\r\n    _The 13th._—I could not yesterday write any further. After\r\n    dinner we took a moonlight walk on the southern shore, from\r\n    which we returned, very tired, at about eleven o’clock. I\r\n    slept till nine; about ten bathed in water of 14° warmer[50]\r\n    than ever I had found the North Sea in August; and now we are\r\n    going together to Fuent Arabia, beyond the frontier; shall dine\r\n    on our way back at St. Jean de Luz. The weather is heavenly\r\n    to-day, the sea quiet and blue; it is almost too hot to walk in\r\n    the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Izazu, 17th October, 1864.\r\n\r\n    Although I have this morning sent you a letter by the courier,\r\n    _pour la rareté du fait_, I must write to you from this\r\n    remarkable place. We breakfasted here, three miles to the east\r\n    of Biarritz, in the mountains, and are seated in charming\r\n    summer weather at the edge of a rushing stream, the name of\r\n    which we can not learn, as nobody speaks French—nothing but\r\n    Basque. There are high narrow rocks before and behind us, with\r\n    heather, ferns, and chestnuts all around. The valley is called\r\n    Le Pas de Roland, and is the west end of the Pyrenees. Before\r\n    we went off we took our baths—the water cold, the air like\r\n    July. The courier dispatched, we had a charming drive through\r\n    mountains, forests, and meadows. After eating and drinking,\r\n    and climbing ourselves tired, our party of five are sitting\r\n    down reading to each other, and I am writing myself on the lid\r\n    of the box in which were the grapes and figs we brought with\r\n    us. At five we shall return with the sunset and moonlight to\r\n    Biarritz, and dine about eight. It is too pleasant a life to\r\n    last. The 20th, the evening before last, we went to Pau. It was\r\n    heavy and sultry there, and at night storm and rain; we were\r\n    in the railway, but came from Bayonne hither by carriage; the\r\n    sea magnificent. After it had been as smooth as a duck-pond\r\n    for some days with the land winds, it now looks like a boiling\r\n    caldron, and the wind is warm and moist with it; the sun\r\n    alternates with rain—very Atlantic weather.\r\n\r\n    To-day I take my fourteenth bath; I shall hardly get more than\r\n    fifteen, for it seems I must to-morrow leave this warm shore.\r\n    I am still striving between duty and taste; but I fear the\r\n    first will conquer. I will first take my bath, and then decide\r\n    whether it shall be the penultimate one. Anyhow, the fourteen\r\n    days I have spent here have done me good, and I only wish I\r\n    could transport you, without travelling discomfort, hither or\r\n    to Pau.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Paris, 25th October, 1864.\r\n\r\n    Before going to bed, after a tiring day, I will announce to you\r\n    my fortunate arrival here. Yesterday noon I left dear Biarritz;\r\n    they were making hay in the meadows when I started in the hot\r\n    sun. Friends accompanied me as far as Bayonne; at about 6 A.M.\r\n    I arrived here. Plenty of politics, audience at St. Cloud, a\r\n    dinner at Drouyn de Lhuys’s, and now I am going to bed tired\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Carlsbad, 12th July, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I am ashamed that I did not write to you on your birthday; but\r\n    there is so much of “must” in my life that I scarcely ever get\r\n    to “will.” The treadwheel goes on from day to day, and I seem\r\n    as if I were the tired horse in it, pushing it along without\r\n    getting any forwarder. One day after the other a courier\r\n    arrives, one day after the other another departs—between whiles\r\n    come others from Vienna, Munich, or Rome; the burden of papers\r\n    increases, ministers are all at odds, and from this centre I am\r\n    obliged to write to each of them singly.\r\n\r\n    The review I hope to stop; as far as I know, the actual return\r\n    has not yet reached the King; but I have brought the matter\r\n    forward, and His Majesty has promised to examine into the\r\n    provision question for man and horse. To-morrow I will inquire\r\n    in the military cabinet as to how far the writing has got.\r\n\r\n                                     Late in the evening, the 13th.\r\n\r\n    The whole day I have been writing, dictating, reading, going\r\n    down and up the mountain as to the report to the King. The\r\n    courier’s bag and my letter are both closing. Across the table\r\n    I see the Erzgebirge, along the Tepl by the evening twilight,\r\n    very beautiful; but I feel leathery and old. The King starts\r\n    from here on the 19th, five days off, for Gastein, whither the\r\n    Emperor designs to come. On the road I will see —— somewhere\r\n    in Bavaria. “Neither rest by day nor night.” It looks ugly for\r\n    peace—it must be settled at Gastein.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         Gastein, 4th August, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I begin to count the days I shall have to sit through in this\r\n    fog-chamber. As to what the sun looks like, we have only\r\n    dark reminiscences from a better past. Since this morning it\r\n    has at least been cold; until then sultry moist heat, with a\r\n    change only in the form of rain, and continued uncertainty as\r\n    to whether one gets wet with rain or perspiration, when one\r\n    stumps up and down the esplanade steps in the mud. How people\r\n    with nothing to do can endure it I do not understand. What\r\n    with bathing, work, dinner, reports, and tea at His Majesty’s,\r\n    I have scarcely time to realize the horrors of the situation.\r\n    These last three days there has been a theatre of comedians\r\n    here; but one is almost ashamed to go, and most people avoid\r\n    the passage through the rain. I am very well through it all,\r\n    particularly since we have had Kaltenhäuser beer. —— and ——\r\n    are dreadfully cast down from not knowing what to drink. The\r\n    landlord gives them bad beer in order to force them to drink\r\n    worse wine. Other news than this there is none from this\r\n    steam-kitchen, unless I talk politics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                        Gastein, 14th August, 1865.\r\n\r\n    For some days I have had no time to send you any news. Count\r\n    Blome is here again, and we are zealously laboring at the\r\n    maintenance of peace, and the repair of the fissures in the\r\n    buildings. The day before yesterday I devoted a day to the\r\n    chase. I think I wrote you word how fruitless the first\r\n    was. This time I have at least shot a young chamois, but\r\n    saw no others in the three hours during which I abandoned\r\n    my motionless self to the experiments of the most various\r\n    insects; and the prattling activity of the waterfall beneath\r\n    me convinced me of the deep-rooted feeling which caused some\r\n    one before my time to express the wish, “Streamlet, let thy\r\n    rushing be!” In my room, also, this wish is justified both by\r\n    day and by night—one breathes on reaching any place where the\r\n    brutal noise of the waterfall can not be heard. In the end,\r\n    however, it was a very pretty shot, right across the chasm;\r\n    killed first fire, and the brute fell headlong into the brook,\r\n    some church-steeple’s height beneath me. My health is good,\r\n    and I feel myself much stronger. We start on the 19th—that is\r\n    Saturday—for Salzburg. The Emperor will probably make his visit\r\n    there, and one or two days will be spent besides at Ischl.\r\n    The King then goes to Hohenschwangau. I go to Munich, and\r\n    join His Majesty again at Baden. What next may follow depends\r\n    upon politics. If you are in Homburg long enough, I hope to\r\n    take a trip over to you from Baden—to enjoy the comforts of\r\n    domesticity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Baden, 1st September, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I reached this place the day before yesterday morning, slept\r\n    till half-past twelve, then had much hard work; dinner with\r\n    the King—long audience. In the evening a quartette at Count\r\n    Flemming’s with Joachim, who really performs on his violin in\r\n    a most wonderful way. There were many acquaintances of mine on\r\n    the race-course yesterday whom I did not very well remember.\r\n\r\n    September begins rainy. Two-thirds of the year are gone just\r\n    when one has grown accustomed to write 1865. Many princes are\r\n    here. At four —— wants to see me; she is said to have grown\r\n    very beautiful. The King leaves at five—it is undecided whether\r\n    to Coblenz or Coburg, on account of Queen Victoria, whom he\r\n    desires to meet. I hope in any case to pass by way of Frankfurt\r\n    on the 5th or 6th. Whether, or how long, I can be in Homburg,\r\n    will soon be seen—longer than one day in no case, as I must be\r\n    with the King in Berlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                     Baden, Sunday.\r\n\r\n    That you may see what a husband you have, I send you the route.\r\n    We go to-morrow morning, at six o’clock, to Coburg, to the\r\n    Queen of England. I must go too, and I am sorry to say Spa is\r\n    all over for me; but it can not be otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT YEAR 1866.\r\n\r\n    Disputes with Austria.—The Central States.—Mobilization\r\n    of the Army.—Bismarck shot at by Kohn-Blind, 7th May,\r\n    1866.—Excitement in Berlin.—War Imminent.—Declaration.—The\r\n    King sets out on the Campaign.—Sichrow.—Litschen.—Battle\r\n    of Sadowa, 3d July, 1866.—Bismarck with His Majesty on\r\n    the Battle-field.—Negotiations of Nicolsburg.—Treaty\r\n    of Prague.—Illness of Bismarck.—Consolidation of\r\n    Prussia.—Triumphant Entry of the Army into Berlin.—Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEre the year 1865 was at an end, Bismarck had become firmly convinced\r\nthat Austria had lapsed from the Treaty of Gastein and had returned\r\nto the Central State policy, the advocate of which was the Freiherr\r\nvon Beust. This policy, which could only ultimate in eternizing the\r\nold vacillating system at the Federation between Prussia and Austria,\r\nas this was the only way in which the existence of the Central State\r\nsovereignties could be prolonged, was skillfully guarded by the Freiherr\r\nvon Beust, and always presented the seductive appearance of moderation,\r\nas it neither conceded any thing to Prussia nor Austria, but kept the\r\none constantly in check against the other. That Germany was certainly\r\nbeing imperilled by it, politicians entirely overlooked. At the moment\r\nPrussia had the preponderance, not only actually, as Bismarck in fact and\r\ntruth pursued a national policy, but also formally, as it had separated\r\nAustria by the Treaty of Gastein from the Central States. According to\r\nthe principles of the Central States, Prussia had now to be depressed,\r\nand Austria elevated. Here was the point at which Bismarck awaited his\r\ndiplomatic opponents. Had they been the German patriots for which they\r\nwere so anxious to pass—and perhaps they quite honestly deemed themselves\r\nsuch—they would have come to the material point, and demanded more from\r\nAustria for Germany than Prussia had offered. Austria was in the position\r\nto accede to the German princes—perhaps to the German people—more than\r\nPrussia could do, whose whole position was much more awkward. Austria did\r\nnot imperil her entire autonomy as Prussia did. Bismarck, however, knew\r\nhis Pappenheimers—the Central State policy did not go upon the material,\r\nbut the formal point—and only used their federation with Austria to force\r\nPrussia to the acceptance of a new Augustenburg minor State north of the\r\nElbe.\r\n\r\nSo little a policy necessarily would come to destruction in face of the\r\nenergy with which Bismarck clung to his national programme. This also\r\nbecame very ominous for Austria, for she saw herself obliged to give\r\nbattle upon a basis which tottered under her. Faithful to the traditions\r\nof her old policy, Austria sought to win the Courts by promises, and\r\nshe succeeded; but she knew very well that little or nothing was gained\r\nthereby. The result has shown how little worth Austria set upon the\r\nGerman Confederation. Prussia, while she asked, promised nothing.\r\nBismarck adhered to his policy, which only demanded sacrifices on the\r\npart of the princes—sacrifices for Germany, not for Prussia, who was\r\nready to bring far greater ones than any minor State.\r\n\r\nThus approached the hour of decision—a decision whether in future the\r\nGerman people, under the leadership of Prussia, should assume its proper\r\nplace in Europe, or whether it should coalesce into a weak federation of\r\nimpuissant territories, under Austrian satraps, and be blindly obedient\r\nto every signal from Vienna.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made in every direction; but it was certain that\r\nin Vienna, in a scarcely credible misapprehension of Prussia, the\r\nauthorities had armed for a long time only because it was believed that\r\nPrussia was to be terrified by such armaments. At Vienna, the peaceable\r\ndisposition of the venerable King William, who, to the last moment, hoped\r\nfor a peaceful termination, which was indeed possible until the firing\r\nof the first cannon-shot, was looked upon as fear. Was it impossible for\r\nAustria, without any stain upon her honor, to concede to Prussia and\r\nGermany in May all that which she had solemnly acknowledged at Prague in\r\nAugust?\r\n\r\nIt would be far beyond the limits of this book to enter upon the\r\nfomented quarrels in the Elbe Duchies and at the Diet on the diplomatic\r\nrecriminations concerning the earlier or later armaments. We conceive\r\nthat we have already sufficiently set forth Bismarck’s policy; for our\r\npurpose it is quite unimportant whether Austria really desired war, or\r\nwhether her object was to terrorize. King William did _not_ wish for\r\nwar; but he wished to be free from Austria, for the present and future,\r\nin the interests of Prussia and Germany. Prussia had seriously armed;\r\nfor whoever desires to attain an end must have the means to attain it,\r\nand Bismarck had not forgotten what had caused the fall of the Radowitz\r\npolicy. But Radowitz had not been wrecked upon the insufficiency of the\r\nPrussian military system of his day, but on the actual course of foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORY!]\r\n\r\nHow had this changed since the days of Erfurt and Olmütz?\r\n\r\nIn judging of the rupture with the Diet, it must be here again borne in\r\nmind, what had become of it since 1851, what position it had assumed\r\ntowards Prussia. Count Bismarck, on the re-establishment of the Diet in\r\n1851, had been sent to Frankfurt as a friend of Austria. Prussia desires\r\nto co-operate openly and freely with Austria, and that this was also the\r\nendeavor of Count Bismarck, his whole political behavior had testified\r\nat the very time, in the most unequivocal manner, when Austria, weakened\r\nby internal revolution, was obliged to resort to foreign assistance.\r\nHe soon perceived, however, that such co-operation was impossible. The\r\nnecessary condition of it was the equalization of Prussia with Austria,\r\nand this had also been promised at Olmütz. Count Bismarck could not allow\r\nPrussia to be the _second_ German power. He used to say that as Austria\r\nwas “one,” so also Prussia was “one;” nor could he interpret the treaties\r\nin any other way than as they were understood until 1848; that Prussia,\r\nno more than Austria, could subordinate herself to resolutions of the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nBut this principal condition Austria allowed only to herself: a hegemony\r\nover Germany was the policy of Prince Schwarzenberg, and his successors\r\nadhered to this word. Count Bismarck soon convinced himself that all\r\nfederal complaisance only called forth further demands, that gratitude\r\nand sympathy in the policy of the empire were as little thought of as\r\nnational feelings and German interests.\r\n\r\nAustria did not desire any nearer approach to Prussia; she would come\r\nto any understanding. She began by securing to herself an obedient\r\nmajority at the Diet, and believed that she could dispense with extending\r\nthe competency and sphere of action of the Federation, after making\r\nthe Diet, by the institution of the influence of the majorities, and\r\nthe suppression of the right of protest in the minority, a serviceable\r\ninstrument of Viennese policy, and thus gradually do away with the right\r\nof protest and the independence of the individual States, and thus also\r\nthat of Prussia. The Austrian Ministers went so far as to assert that\r\nAustria alone in the Federation had any right to a foreign policy; and\r\nthis Austrian policy should be endowed with the semblance of legality\r\nby the resolution of the servile majority in the Diet. In such an\r\naspiration Austria found from the Central States an only too willing\r\nsympathy. To the ambition and thirst for action of the Ministers of the\r\nlatter, the territorial dimensions of their own country and the circle\r\nof activity assigned to them seemed not important or distinguished\r\nenough. It flattered them to be engaged in questions of European policy.\r\nThis, indeed, they could enter upon without danger or a necessity for\r\nreciprocity; and they speedily found a natural consequence of the\r\nprinciple of federal law in the fact, that the members of the Federation\r\nneed follow no foreign policy of their own, but would only have to follow\r\nsuch as might be dictated by the majority.\r\n\r\nBut the mediatization of the foreign policy of Prussia was not the only\r\nobject held in view. If the course of European politics admitted of it,\r\nit was proposed as a further consequence to declare as an undoubted issue\r\nof federal jurisprudence, that the constitution and laws of Prussia\r\nshould be subject to the determination of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe Central States saw themselves placed on an equality with Prussia\r\nwith the highest satisfaction. They were ready to make any sacrifice\r\notherwise so obstinately refused, except independence, if Prussia were\r\nonly subjected to the same. They could not forgive Prussia her greatness\r\nand high position, and therefore they experienced an especial delight\r\nin making Prussia feel the importance of the Federation. The securer\r\nthey felt of the majority, the less concealed and bold were their\r\npretensions, and every demand of Austria on Prussia, however unjust,\r\nfound ready support from the Central States, especially if the question\r\nwere to combat the estimation and influence of Prussia in Germany.\r\nThe majority was always to decide, even as to the question of their\r\nown right of decision, and there was no hesitation in doing violence\r\nto words and sound common sense to prove a united vote as to such a\r\nproceeding. They endeavored to deceive the world and themselves by the\r\nfallacy that “Federal Diet” and “Germany” were identical ideas, and the\r\nopinions of Prussia were stigmatized as being non-German, while Prussia\r\nwas accused of stirring up strife in the Federation, when she declined\r\nunconditionally to submit to the arbitrary decisions of the majority in\r\nthe Diet, while Austria allowed herself to be praised to the skies in\r\nher paid press as the exclusive representative of Germany and German\r\ninterests. But even at that time did many believe this? Had not Austria\r\nbetrayed her real views and intentions in the secret dispatch of the\r\n14th of January, 1855, in a most unequivocal manner? Openly and without\r\nany reticence she had declared in that document that she would have no\r\nhesitation in destroying the Federation to carry through her policy. She\r\nhad invited the Federal Governments, in contravention of the articles\r\nof federation, to enter into a warlike alliance with her and place her\r\ntroops at the disposition of the Emperor of Austria, and promised them\r\nadvantages at the expense of those who refused such an alliance—that is,\r\nby way of territorial aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nThe political life of Count Bismarck in Frankfurt was an uninterrupted\r\nfight against such a system as above described. He was never weary in\r\npointing out and warning them that the elements ruling at the Diet were\r\ntending towards conditions which Prussia could not accept as permanent.\r\nHe had also predicted at Frankfurt that the plan took a direction towards\r\nplacing Prussia, as soon as the fruit was believed to be ripe, in the\r\nposition that it would have to reject a resolution of the majority, then\r\nto commit a breach of the Federation, which should be ascribed to Prussia.\r\n\r\nSo also was the event. Prussia remained faithful to the Federation till\r\nit was violated by others, and when they had done, they blamed Prussia\r\nwith the breach of the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe spring of the great year 1866 was the most difficult in Bismarck’s\r\nlife. The terrible load of responsibility pressed heavier and heavier\r\nupon him. Serious and well-intentioned, as well as perfidious, attempts\r\nat peace, lamed and impeded his activity. Intrigues of all kinds hovered\r\nabout his person. His position was now openly assailed, now secretly\r\nundermined. More than once he felt the ground trembling beneath him—he\r\ncould not get forward; and in addition to this he was corporeally ill;\r\nrheumatic pains increasing in an alarming way. Doubt very often, it\r\nis probable, assailed the strong mind of Bismarck, the ghastly ray of\r\nsuspicion fell upon his courageous heart. The man who had to fight for\r\nhis King and country, with all the powers, the traditions of ancient\r\nbrotherhood in arms, the ties of princely relationship, the intrigues of\r\ndiplomatists, the falling away of old friends, with the wrong-headedness,\r\ncowardice, low-mindedness of others, down to the pacific overtures of his\r\nopponents, in so superhuman a manner, now gradually grew into a more and\r\nmore intensified battle with himself. On this the Almighty, the Lord of\r\nhim and of Prussia, had mercy on him. He gave him a great sign.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May, 1866, at five in the afternoon, Count Bismarck was\r\nwalking abroad for the first time after his severe illness, returning\r\nfrom an interview with the King, and proceeding up the centre allée of\r\nthe Unter den Linden. Almost opposite the Hotel of the Imperial Russian\r\nEmbassy, he heard two rapidly following reports behind him. As it was\r\nafterwards found, one bullet had just grazed his side. Count Bismarck\r\nturned swiftly round, and saw a young man before him, who was raising\r\nhis revolver to fire a third time. Bismarck met the man quickly, and\r\nseized him by the arm and by the throat; but before he reached him the\r\nman fired the third shot. It was a glance shot on the right shoulder,\r\nwhich Bismarck felt for a long time afterwards. Then the wretch passed\r\nthe revolver, as quick as lightning, from the right to the left hand,\r\nand close to him fired two other shots at the Minister-President. One\r\nshot missed him in consequence of a quick turn, only burning his coat;\r\nbut the other struck him, and at this moment Count Bismarck believed\r\nhimself mortally wounded, for he felt that one of the bullets had\r\nstruck him right on the rib. The rib probably feathered, as they say\r\nin deer-shooting—_i.e._, it bent elastically. Count Bismarck at once\r\nmastered the sensation of weakness which had come over him by the\r\nconcussion of the vertebræ through the rib for an instant. He handed over\r\nthe criminal—whom he had held with an iron grasp—to the officers and men\r\nof the first battalion of the Second Foot Guard Regiment, who were just\r\nmarching down the street, and walked on in the direction of his house\r\nin the Wilhelms-Strasse, where he safely arrived before the news of the\r\nattempt was known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period preceding the war there was nothing extraordinary\r\nin the Minister-President’s being with the King longer than usual, so\r\nthat the dinner usually fixed for five was often half an hour late,\r\nor even longer. Nobody, therefore, was surprised at the Count’s late\r\nappearance on this occasion. No one in the house had even an idea of\r\nthe terrible attempt at murder on the Unter den Linden—of the wonderful\r\npreservation of the master of the house. There was some company assembled\r\nin the salon of the Countess, awaiting the Minister-President; at last\r\nhe entered. Nobody noticed any disquietude or excitement in his manner;\r\nit only seemed to some as if his greeting were heartier than usual.\r\nSaying, “Ah! what a pleasant party!” he went to his study, where it was\r\nhis habit to remain for a few moments before sitting down to table. He\r\nthis day made a short report of the event to His Majesty the King. Then\r\nhe returned to the dinner-party, and said, as he very often did when he\r\ncame late, in a merry scolding tone to his wife, “Why _don’t_ we eat our\r\ndinners to-day?” He approached a lady to lead her to the dining-table,\r\nand then, as they went out of the salon, he went up to his wife, kissed\r\nher on the forehead, and said, “My child, they have shot at me, but there\r\nis no harm done!”\r\n\r\nTenderly and prudently as this was said, terror naturally displayed\r\nitself on all countenances. Everyone crowded round the honored gentleman\r\nin trembling joy at his wonderful escape. He, however, would not delay,\r\nentered the dining-room, and, after a short grace, sat down to his soup,\r\nwhich no doubt tasted all the better to him the less that he, in all\r\nhuman probability, seemed likely to have any right to it again half an\r\nhour before. The surgeon who was called in said afterwards, when all\r\nsorts of theories were attempted to account for the non-success of the\r\nattempt, with great justice:—“Gentlemen! there is but one explanation.\r\nGod’s hand was between them!”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the dinner on that day was frequently interrupted; nobody ate\r\nany dinner at all except Bismarck himself. Before six o’clock, only\r\nhalf an hour after the crime, the King himself arrived, having risen\r\nfrom his own dinner to congratulate his Minister. Bismarck received his\r\nroyal master on the stairs, and remained alone with him for a short\r\ntime. No doubt it was a touching meeting for both of them; for the dear\r\nLord who still could press his tried servant by the still warm hand,\r\nas for the Minister, ready at any moment to die for his King, be it on\r\nthe battle-field or in the street! There was very little ceremony at the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs that day. Scarcely had the King departed ere,\r\none after the other, the Princes of the Royal House who happened to be\r\nin Berlin appeared, and sat down at the family table, drinking a glass\r\nof wine to Bismarck’s safety. The company increased as the news of the\r\ncriminal deed grew known farther off; the venerable Field-Marshal Count\r\nWrangel was one of the first who hastened to express sympathy. Generals,\r\nministers, ambassadors, friends, and all who respected him, even\r\npolitical opponents, thronged round the precious personage so wonderfully\r\npreserved to his native land. At the threshold of the door crowds of\r\npersons of all conditions were assembled, who inscribed their names in\r\nlists prepared for the purpose, in token of their sympathy. Supplements\r\nof the _Gazettes_ then appeared, telling in brief periods what had\r\ntaken place; and rejoicing multitudes thronged the Wilhelms-Platz and\r\nWilhelms-Strasse till far into the evening. Conservative clubs serenaded\r\nhim, and, for the first time in his life, Bismarck addressed from the\r\nwindow the people of Berlin.\r\n\r\nFrom that day all vacillation in Bismarck was at an end. The Lord God,\r\nin his wonderful salvation, had vouchsafed him a sign, and he again felt\r\nthe full and strong conscience of his historical mission; he knew that he\r\nwas the sentinel whom God had placed at a post, from which alone He could\r\nrelieve him. Nor was this a Divine signal to Bismarck alone.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the political enthusiast who attempted the murder, the\r\nstep-son of a democratic fugitive named Blind, whose name he had assumed,\r\nended his career by suicide before any examination could take place.\r\nThere were traces of a conspiracy certainly discovered, but they were not\r\npursued; the attempt at assassination therefore can not be regarded as\r\nthe crime of an individual. It was sad enough to see that the fanatical\r\nhatred of Bismarck went so far in Austria and South Germany; that\r\nvoices were raised, trying to elevate the murderer into a martyr. The\r\nAustrian press dishonored itself by the publication of an advertisement\r\nin which an obscure advocate set a price on Bismarck’s head. It was\r\nvery silly that the _Ritter von Geist_ in Vienna endeavored to account\r\nfor Bismarck’s wonderful escape by changing his shirt into a suit of\r\nchain mail, and then with wonderful wit declared that the Prussian\r\nMinister-President bought his linen from the ironmonger!\r\n\r\nThe times were growing more serious; minds began to feel that stillness\r\nwhich precedes the storm.\r\n\r\n“_Mit Gott für König und Vaterland!_”—“With God for King and\r\nFatherland!”—the ancient royal battle-cry of olden time, first crept\r\nsoftly and then louder and louder from heart to heart, from mouth to\r\nmouth, until at last it thundered in the roaring of a thousand cannon\r\nthroughout the trembling world. It seems sad that in those very days a\r\nvaliant archduke in Italy, most infelicitously altering our old dear\r\nPrussian cry, closed an order of the day with the words: “For God with\r\nEmperor and Fatherland!”\r\n\r\nIt was just during these days of omen that Bismarck, although very\r\nserious, was more gentle and kind than ever to his relatives and friends.\r\nThere was expectation, often expectation to the greatest tension, but no\r\nvacillation, no doubt in him; he was a brave man from head to foot. In\r\nthe later hours of evening he was often in the beautiful garden of the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, of which garden he was very fond; under its\r\nold trees he used to take counsel with Moltke, with Roon, and others;\r\nthere he often walked up and down restlessly for hours, in deep thought,\r\nwaiting for a royal message. There, too, the eventful thought flashed\r\nupon him, in the night of Thursday to Friday, from the 14th to the 15th\r\nof June, to set the Prussian columns in motion twenty-four hours sooner\r\nthan had been intended. Immediately General von Moltke was sent for, and\r\nthe telegraph was at work.\r\n\r\nIn the enthusiasm at the first results, and in the restless activity\r\nof those days, Bismarck seemed to have lost every trace of illness. An\r\nold partisan of his, who was invited to dinner by him in those days,\r\nfound him fresher and more vigorous than ever. During the most animated\r\nconversation, the news came in that telegraphic communication with Italy\r\nwas broken off. Bismarck turned to Legations Councillor von Keudell\r\nand said, “Dear Keudell, please give directions that telegrams be sent\r\nviâ London,” and continued his conversation. Immediately after dinner\r\nGeneral von Moltke was announced. Bismarck went out, but returned in\r\nten minutes, quite at ease, and invited his guest to accompany him\r\ninto the garden, although no doubt those ten minutes had been spent\r\nin a conference of the most important eventful character. General von\r\nWerder was announced. Another conference, and then Bismarck related, in\r\nstrolling about the garden, how on that forenoon, worn out by continued\r\nexertion to the greatest extent, and waiting in the antechamber of\r\nthe King, he had fallen asleep on a sofa. He delighted in his garden,\r\nand got on the ice-house, from which he could overlook the whole of\r\nthe green thickets of the fine large garden behind the palace in the\r\nWilhelms-Strasse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA few days later, on Friday, the 29th of June, the first news of victory\r\narrived. No one, no one will ever forget that day! As if by enchantment,\r\nthe whole of Berlin was dressed in black-and-white flags; in every street\r\nresounded, in joy, “_Ich bin ein Preusse, kennt ihr meine Farben?_”—“I\r\nam a Prussian; do you know my colors?”[51] In thousands the multitude\r\npressed to the palace of the King, who greeted his faithful people from\r\nthe window, while the General-Intendant von Hülsen read the victorious\r\nnews from the balcony. There was no end to the rejoicings bursting\r\njoyfully from full hearts. It was indeed a Prussian day!\r\n\r\nWhen Count Bismarck, at about 2 P.M., left the royal palace, he was\r\nbesieged on all sides. Every one wanted to shake hands; on that day, in\r\nthat hour, every one felt and knew what Count Bismarck was to Prussia;\r\nsome have already forgotten it, and there are others who would fain have\r\nit forgotten.\r\n\r\nBismarck was visibly in deep emotion, but he maintained his serious\r\ncarriage. The first victories did not intoxicate him; his prudence,\r\nindeed, had apparently increased in power. In this hour he thought of the\r\nsacrifice, and was humble in his heart.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the multitude returned to the palace of the King, and\r\nsang Luther’s hymn—“_Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott_”—“A fortress firm is\r\nour God.” The King returned thanks. Only the few persons, close to him\r\ncould hear the words—the roaring ocean of human voices drowned them—and\r\nyet every man knew what the King had said. Prussia’s King could only\r\nexpress what every Prussian felt and thought at this moment. Thence the\r\nmultitude rushed to the Crown Prince’s palace, and greeted with hoch\r\nand hurrah the victorious leader of the second army, which had stood\r\nso well against the enemy; thence to the palace of Prince Charles, the\r\neldest Prince of the royal house, whose son, Prince Frederick Charles,\r\nhad penetrated so gloriously into Bohemia with the first army, and had\r\nwon “first blood” for Prussia in this war. Next the mass stood head to\r\nhead in the Wilhelms-Strasse, before Bismarck’s hotel; the never-ending\r\ncry of triumph forced the Minister-President to the window. He raised\r\nhis hand in token that he would speak; all were silent beneath; from the\r\ndistance on both sides the muffled roaring of the shores of this popular\r\nmass toned along. For the second time Count Bismarck addressed the people\r\nof Berlin, in powerful but proudly moderate words; he ended with a salute\r\nto the King and his army. At the moment a tremendous peal of thunder\r\nreverberated over the royal city, a flash of forked lightning illuminated\r\nthe scene, and, with a strongly ringing voice, Bismarck shouted above the\r\nmultitude, “The heavens fire a salute!”\r\n\r\nNo one will ever forget it who heard that peal of thunder. The reply was\r\nreturned as with one voice; then the rejoicing mass got again into motion\r\nto greet “old Roon,” the faithful warrior, at the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June Bismarck left Berlin in the suite of the King, with\r\nGenerals von Roon and von Moltke. The King was also accompanied by the\r\nGeneral Feld Zeugmeister, Prince Charles of Prussia, Herrenmeister of\r\nBalley Brandenburg, for the seat of war. The carriages rolled by the\r\nstatues of the Great Frederick, the heroes of the War of Freedom, and the\r\ngreat Elector on the Long Bridge. Bismarck was serious and firm, looking\r\nlike an iron statue, and more taciturn than ever. The first night’s\r\nquarters the King passed at the Castle of Reichenberg—a few days before\r\nthe head-quarters of his victorious nephew, Prince Frederick Charles,\r\nwho had already penetrated far into Bohemia, and was encamped in the\r\nfields, where Prussian hearts were throbbing to the Almighty, and their\r\narms smiting the foe, according to the brave phrase of the Maccabees,\r\nwhich the Prince had used in General Orders, but which contradictory\r\nignorance could not find, and still prates enough about it to this day,\r\nas a Prussian “Bible forgery.”[52] Count Bismarck, at the first night’s\r\nlodging at Reichenberg—and, it is said, not without reason—evinced great\r\nanxiety as to the safety of his royal master. Of himself he thought much\r\nless; perhaps he does not know, to this moment, that it was only towards\r\nthe morning it was found possible to disembark his horses and bring\r\nthem up. We have heard that a surprise of the royal head-quarters by a\r\nstrong body of cavalry advance was not beyond the bounds of possibility.\r\nSufficient reason for Bismarck’s anxiety! From Sichrow and Jitschen,\r\nBismarck wrote the following letters to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                           Sichrow, 1st July, 1866.\r\n\r\n    To-day we have started from Reichenberg, and have just reached\r\n    this place. It is uncertain whether we shall remain here\r\n    or proceed to Turnau. The whole journey was dangerous. The\r\n    Austrians, yesterday, had they sent cavalry from Leitmeritz,\r\n    might have caught the King and all the rest of us. Charles,\r\n    the coachman, has had a severe fall with the mare, which ran\r\n    away with him. At first he was thought dead; he is lying in\r\n    the hospital here, near Sichrow, in the next village. Kurt had\r\n    better come for him.\r\n\r\n    Everywhere we meet prisoners; according to the returns there\r\n    are already above fifteen thousand. Jitschin was yesterday\r\n    taken by us at the point of the bayonet by the Frankfurt\r\n    Division; General Tümpling was severely wounded in the hip, but\r\n    not mortally. The heat is terrible. The carriage of provisions\r\n    is difficult. Our troops suffer from weariness and hunger.\r\n    There are not many traces of war here, except the down-trodden\r\n    cornfields. The people are not afraid of the soldiers; they\r\n    stand in their Sunday clothes at their doors, with wife and\r\n    children, in astonishment. At Trautenau the inhabitants\r\n    murdered twenty defenseless oboists of ours, who had remained\r\n    behind the front after the passage of their regiments. The\r\n    criminals are at Glogau, before court-martial. At Münchengrätz\r\n    a brewer enticed twenty-six of our soldiers into the spirit\r\n    vault, made them drunk, and set it on fire. The distillery\r\n    belongs to a convent. Except such things, we learn little\r\n    more here than you do in Berlin. This castle, which is very\r\n    splendid, belongs to Prince Rohan, whom I saw every year at\r\n    Gastein.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           Jitschen, _not_ Gitschin, 2d July, 1866.\r\n\r\n    We have just arrived from Sichrow; the battle-field here was\r\n    still full of corpses, horses, and arms. Our victories are\r\n    much greater than we thought; it seems we have already more\r\n    than fifteen thousand prisoners, and with dead and wounded\r\n    the Austrian loss is stated at a higher figure—about twenty\r\n    thousand men. Two of their corps are completely dispersed, some\r\n    regiments destroyed to the last man. Till now I have seen more\r\n    Austrian prisoners than Prussian soldiers. Send me cigars by\r\n    the courier every time—a thousand at a time, if they can be\r\n    had, price twenty dollars, for the hospitals. All the wounded\r\n    beg them of me. Then by clubs, or our own resources, subscribe\r\n    for some dozens of Kreuzzeitungs for the hospitals—for\r\n    instance, the one at Reichenberg; the other places can be\r\n    learnt at the Ministry of War. What is Clermont-Tonnere\r\n    about? is he not coming? I have no news by the post. Send me\r\n    a revolver of wide calibre, a saddle-pistol. Charles, the\r\n    coachman, is better; he will not suffer permanently, but for\r\n    some time will not be fit for service. Charles B. is much to\r\n    be praised; he is the active principle of our travelling\r\n    household. I greet you heartily. Send me a French novel to\r\n    read, but only one at a time. God keep you.\r\n\r\n    Your letter with the Homburg inclosure has just arrived; a\r\n    thousand thanks. I can understand how you feel the quiet of\r\n    our departure. In our hurry here one feels nothing of the\r\n    position—perhaps a little in bed at night.\r\n\r\nOn the road to Jitschen, on the battle-field, Prince Frederick Charles\r\ncame to meet his royal uncle. What a meeting! The Prince drove into\r\nJitschen with the King about 2 P.M., where the King alighted at the\r\nGolden Lion. The guard of honor here consisted of Pomeranian Grenadiers\r\nof the regiment of the late King.\r\n\r\nWe are not here writing a history of the famous campaign; we will\r\nonly observe that on the 2d July no battle was expected at the royal\r\nhead-quarters for the next day; the King visited the wounded, and\r\nBismarck accompanied him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 o’clock P.M. the chief of the staff of Prince Frederick Charles,\r\nGeneral von Voigts-Rheetz, arrived in Jitschen from Kamenitz, the\r\nhead-quarters of the Prince, bringing with him the plans and positions of\r\nbattle, settled by the Prince in consequence of the daring reconnoissance\r\nof an officer on his staff, Major von Unger, which plans were submitted\r\nto the King. Immediately upon the arrival of General von Voigts-Rheetz\r\nthe Council of War was summoned to the King, the battle dispositions\r\nof the Prince were entirely accepted, all arrangements made, and Count\r\nFinck von Finckenstein rode off on his historical ride to the army of the\r\nCrown Prince, to summon it up. The plan was exceedingly simple. Prince\r\nFrederick Charles was to throw himself on the front of the enemy, seize\r\nit, and if possible overcome it, until the Crown Prince arrived with the\r\nsecond army, to give the _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\nVery simple—alas! how much looks simple upon paper!\r\n\r\nOn the 3d July, amidst fog and rain, Prince Frederick Charles set out to\r\nbattle against the overwhelming force of the enemy: in the first dawn of\r\nthe day his troops were in their assigned position. At eight the Prince\r\nbegan the battle. “Too early!” critical voices have said; but military\r\nauthorities have said, “at the right moment!” for any longer delay would\r\nhave allowed General Benedek to take up a much stronger position. The\r\nPrince bravely took the enormous responsibility on himself, and commenced\r\nthe battle. At nine a ringing shout of joy announced the arrival of the\r\nKing on the battle-field, and with him came Count Bismarck, the great\r\nMajor of Landwehr.\r\n\r\nCertainly it created a fine impression, to see the faithful First\r\nCouncillor on the mare Veranda—since that time known as “Sadowa”—on the\r\nfield of honor, “where the bullet whistles, and the lance is couched,\r\nand death is rushing round in every shape”—behind the venerable King.\r\nWhoever had seen Bismarck only under the cross-fire of the disdainful\r\nspeech of a political opposition in the debates of the Chamber, firm,\r\nhalf-contemptuous, and mighty, had never seen him as a whole; he was seen\r\nto best advantage amidst the bullets of Sadowa. There he sat, his high\r\nform upright in the saddle, upon a very tall roan, with a plain paletot\r\nover his uniform, while his piercing eyes scanned each movement from\r\nbeneath his helmet. And thus he sat and rode for hours, for momentous\r\nhours, behind his royal master, in thunder and in smoke. Behind him again\r\nthe musical and gallant Legations Rath von Keudell, also an officer in\r\nthe Landwehr cavalry. Noon arrived, but no decisive news from the Crown\r\nPrince. The battle went burning on, and many a brave heart feared at\r\nthat time for beloved Prussia. Dark were the looks in the neighborhood\r\nof the King; old Roon, and Moltke of the bright face, sat there like\r\ntwo statues of bronze. It was whispered that the Prince would have to\r\nloose his Brandenburgers—his own beloved third corps, whom he had till\r\nnow held in reserve; his stormers of Düppel—against the foe, which meant\r\nthat he would have to set his last hazard on the die to gain the victory.\r\nSuddenly Bismarck lowered the glass through which he had been observing\r\nthe country in the direction from which the Crown Prince was approaching,\r\nand drew the attention of his neighbors to certain lines in the far\r\ndistance. All telescopes were pointed thitherward, but the lines were\r\npronounced to be ploughed fields. There was a deep silence, and then the\r\nMinister-President lowered his glass again and said, decidedly, “Those\r\nare not plough furrows; the spaces are not equal; they are marching\r\nlines!” Bismarck had been the first to discover the advance of the second\r\narmy. In a little while the adjutants and intelligence flew about in\r\nevery direction—the Crown Prince and victory were at hand!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPrince Frederick Charles sent forward his major, Von Unger-Manstein, and\r\nthe Brandenburg brigade of Düppel marched forward, playing, “_Heil dir im\r\nSiegerkranz!_”[53]\r\n\r\nThe rest need not be told here. Bismarck followed his King in the battle.\r\nThe warlike monarch dashed into the grenade fire of the enemy, on which\r\nBismarck made him pause, and said, “As a major I have no right to counsel\r\nyour Majesty on the battle-field, but as Minister-President it is my duty\r\nto beg your Majesty not to seek evident danger!” With a friendly smile,\r\nthe royal hero replied, “How can I ride off when my army is under fire?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the evening Bismarck reached Horitz; there he thought to pass\r\nthe night on the open road; and had already laid himself down under\r\nan open colonnade, when the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, who heard of\r\nthe circumstance, sent for him to his quarters. Who could tell, even\r\nremotely, what were the feelings and thoughts of Bismarck that took\r\ntheir course through his heart and head on that eventful night? And on\r\nthe following day he rode behind his victorious monarch, deeper and\r\never deeper into the land of the vanquished enemy, from Bohemia into\r\nMoravia. Certainly Bismarck was grateful for the great victory; but a\r\ndeep seriousness sat upon his countenance, for he knew that he was riding\r\ntowards the silent battle-field where _he_ was commander-in-chief, and\r\nwhere _he_ had to be the victor.\r\n\r\nOn his road he wrote the following letters to his wife:—\r\n\r\n                                Hohenmauth, Monday, 9th July, 1866.\r\n\r\n    Do you remember, my heart, how, nineteen years ago, we passed\r\n    through here on the road from Prague to Vienna? No mirror\r\n    showed the future—not even when I passed over this railway,\r\n    in 1852, with the kind Lynar. We are all well. If we do not\r\n    become extravagant in our demands, and do not imagine that\r\n    we have conquered _the world_, we shall obtain a peace worth\r\n    the having. But we are as easily intoxicated as cast down,\r\n    and I have the unthankful office of pouring water into this\r\n    foaming wine, and to cause it to be understood that we do not\r\n    inhabit Europe alone, but with three neighbors. The Austrians\r\n    are encamped in Moravia, and we are already so daring as to\r\n    affirm that our head-quarters will to-morrow be where theirs\r\n    are to-day. Prisoners are still arriving, and cannon since\r\n    the 3d to the number of one hundred and eighty. If they bring\r\n    up their southern army, with God’s gracious assistance, we\r\n    will beat that also. Confidence is general. Our people are\r\n    worthy to be kissed; every man is brave to the death, quiet,\r\n    obedient, moralized, with empty stomachs, wet clothes, little\r\n    sleep, boot-soles falling off—friendly towards every one, no\r\n    plundering and burning, paying what they are able, and eating\r\n    mouldy bread. There must exist a depth of piety in our common\r\n    soldier, or all this could not be. It is difficult to obtain\r\n    any news of friends. We lie miles away from each other; no one\r\n    knows where the other may be, and there is no one to send—that\r\n    is to say, plenty of men, but no horses. For four days I have\r\n    been seeking for Philip,[54] who has been slightly wounded in\r\n    the head by a lance-thrust, as G. wrote me word, but I can not\r\n    discover where he lies, and now we have proceeded eight miles\r\n    farther. The King exposed himself very greatly on the 3d, and\r\n    it was well that I was with him, for all the warnings of others\r\n    were in vain, and no one else would have dared to have spoken\r\n    as I did on the last occasion, when I succeeded, after a knot\r\n    of ten cuirassiers and fifteen horses of the 6th Cuirassier\r\n    Regiment were rolling around in their blood, and bombs were\r\n    flying about in very unpleasant proximity to our Sovereign.\r\n    The worst of them, fortunately, did not explode. Yet I would\r\n    rather have it so than that he should be over-prudent. He was\r\n    full of enthusiasm at his troops, and justly; so that he never\r\n    remarked the noise and fighting around him, and sat quiet and\r\n    comfortably, as if at Kreuzberg, continually coming across\r\n    battalions whom he had to thank and say “Good-night” to, until\r\n    we had got under fire again. He had to listen to so much on the\r\n    subject, however, that he will let it alone for the future,\r\n    and you may rest quite tranquil. I hardly believe in another\r\n    _real_ battle.\r\n\r\n    If you receive no news from any one, you may be assured that\r\n    he is alive and well, for any wounds to friends we hear of\r\n    in less than twenty-four hours. We have not as yet come into\r\n    contact with Herwarth and Steinmetz; therefore I have also not\r\n    seen Sch., but I know that both are well. G. leads his squadron\r\n    quietly forward with his arm in a sling. Farewell. I must go to\r\n    duty. Your most faithful\r\n\r\n                                                              V. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                               Zwittau in Moravia, 11th July, 1866.\r\n\r\n    I am in want of an inkstand, all being in use; otherwise I am\r\n    well, after sleeping well on a field-bed and air-mattress, and\r\n    awakening at eight to find a letter from you. I had gone to bed\r\n    at eleven. At Königsgrätz I rode the tall roan; was thirteen\r\n    hours in the saddle without fodder. He behaved very well, was\r\n    frightened neither at the firing nor the corpses, ate corn-tops\r\n    and plum-leaves with satisfaction at the most difficult\r\n    moments, and went thoroughly well to the end, when I seemed\r\n    more tired than the horse. My first bed for the night was on\r\n    the roadway of Horic, without straw, with the aid of a carriage\r\n    cushion. Every place was full of the wounded; the Grand Duke\r\n    of Mecklenburg found me, and then shared his chamber with me,\r\n    R., and two adjutants—which, on account of the rain, was very\r\n    welcome to me. As to the King and the bombs, I have already\r\n    informed you. The generals all were full of the superstition\r\n    that, as soldiers, they dared not speak to the King of danger,\r\n    and always sent me to him, although I am a major. The rising\r\n    trigger of the revolver covers the sight point, and the notch\r\n    in the top of the cock does not show in the line of sight. Tell\r\n    T. of this. Good-bye, my dearest; I must go to S. Your faithful\r\n\r\n                                                              V. B.\r\n\r\nNicolsburg! It was there that Bismarck fought his quiet battle, there\r\nhe accomplished his Sadowa, and chivalrously strove for victory and\r\npeace, not alone against the diplomacy of his antagonists, but against\r\nthe proud daring of triumph in his own camp, which encircled him in so\r\nheart-warming and so seductive a manner. Perhaps Bismarck never showed\r\nhimself a greater statesman than in those days; the billows of victory\r\ncould not overthrow him, mightily as they dashed over him; he stood\r\nlike a tower in the torrent of rancor, anger, even of most malicious\r\nsuspicion, which rose up against him. But he perceived the hollow-eyed\r\nghost of pest silently creeping through the armies, and pitilessly\r\nstrangling out the life of the victors; he knew what the climate of\r\nHungary was in August, and he looked boldly at the cloud which was\r\nrising, pregnant with calamity, in the far west. Hail to the faithful and\r\nbrave hearts who in so terrible an hour clung firmly to Bismarck!\r\n\r\nIt was a strange coincidence that the magnificent castle of Nicolsburg\r\nhad passed through the female line from the inheritance of the\r\ngreat house of the Princes of Dietrichstein to General Count von\r\nMensdorff-Ponilly, of Lothringian descent, like the Austrian Imperial\r\nHouse itself, so that peace was actually negotiated in the very mansion\r\nof the Imperial Minister for Foreign Affairs himself. Has not the Count\r\nMensdorff-Ponilly, as the heir of the Dietrichsteins through his wife,\r\nbeen recently raised to princely rank under the title of Nicolsburg?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs Napoleon the First resided here after the battle of Austerlitz,\r\nso did William I. reside here after the battle of Sadowa; the castle\r\nhas historical recollections enough. Count Bismarck contemplated the\r\nmagnificent pile on his arrival intently, and then said with grave mirth\r\nto his companions: “My old mansion of Schönhausen is certainly very\r\ninsignificant in comparison with this splendid building, therefore I am\r\nbetter pleased that we should be here at Count Mensdorff’s, than that he\r\nshould now be at my house!”\r\n\r\nIn these final days of July the preliminaries of Nicolsburg were\r\ncompleted, which resulted in the peace of Prague.\r\n\r\nThe battle was over, victory had been attained; then weakness and illness\r\nassailed Bismarck, worse than ever. The old pains of nervous rheumatism\r\ncame more terribly than before; but he kept himself up by the power of\r\nthe will, for his King was still in want of him.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of August Bismarck wrote to his wife, on his return from\r\nPrague—“that fated city, where heroes sicken”—as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                           Prague, 3d August, 1866.\r\n\r\n    I have stolen away from the railway station, and am waiting\r\n    here alone, and without luggage, until the King arrives, and\r\n    after him my packages. This moment of compulsory inactivity I\r\n    employ in greeting you from hence, and telling you that I am\r\n    well, and hope to be in Berlin to-morrow night. The King is in\r\n    excellent health. The multitudes between here and the station\r\n    are so packed that I fear there will be accidents.\r\n\r\n    _Evening._—The King came quicker than I expected, and since\r\n    then we have had business of all kinds, and then dinner. I\r\n    have just returned from a drive with His Majesty through\r\n    Hradschin, the Belvedere, etc., and have seen all the beauties\r\n    of the Prague neighborhood. In a few days it will be just\r\n    nineteen years since we saw all these things together. How many\r\n    wonders had to take place ere I should find myself to-day in\r\n    the same place, without B. _Hei cerstwa!_ I had remembered to\r\n    my coachman’s great satisfaction. To-morrow we hope to be in\r\n    Berlin. There is great controversy as to the speech from the\r\n    throne. The little people have all of them not enough to do;\r\n    they see no farther than their own noses, and exercise their\r\n    powers of natation on the stormy waves of eloquence. One can\r\n    manage to settle with one’s enemies—but alas for one’s friends!\r\n    They have all got blinkers on, and only see a spot of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis reference to the speech from the throne in the letter probably\r\ntouches especially on the question of indemnity.\r\n\r\nThere was something peculiar about this indemnity which Bismarck demanded\r\nand obtained from the Diet which was immediately summoned after the war.\r\nThe word sounded very harsh to the ears of the victors; and there are\r\nmany honorable men at the present day who still painfully feel that\r\nBismarck considered it necessary then to obtain this indemnity. Certainly\r\nthe wearied statesman did not fight this new fight for the indemnity from\r\nany affection for the doctrine of Constitutionalism.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August Bismarck returned, in the suite of the King, to\r\nBerlin, amidst the nameless rejoicings of the nation. On the next day\r\ncame the solemn opening of the Diet, and a torrent of work overwhelmed\r\nthe Minister-President. Then ensued the peace-treaties with individual\r\nStates, the consolidation of the conquered provinces, the formation of\r\nthe North German Confederation, cares as to envious malice; and through\r\nall this the suffering man held himself up, pale, but firm, sustained by\r\nhis high sense of duty, by the consciousness of his supreme mission. For\r\ndays and hours the powers of Bismarck, stretched to their utmost tension,\r\ngave way, but he always recovered himself, presenting an undaunted front\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was necessary; for the victorious war had brought him no\r\nrest. The relations towards the West were growing more and more menacing;\r\nthe cloud he had perceived from Nicolsburg was assuming form. It could no\r\nlonger be compared at will to a weasel or a camel. Had the cloud obtained\r\na name, a new war on the Rhine was almost unavoidable, a war in which\r\nPrussia would unquestionably have to shed her blood only for the laurels,\r\nwithout winning the fruits, of victory. Such a war, however, Bismarck\r\ndesired—was indeed forced—to avoid from a sense of duty. Let us allow a\r\nFrenchman to relate in what manner he accomplished this task.\r\n\r\nA long essay was published in the _Revue Moderne_ of Paris, by J.\r\nVilbort, under the title of “Germany since Sadowa.” Contained in this is\r\nthe speech on territorial compensations, demanded by France in August,\r\n1866, at the very time when the rejoicings in Prussia were at their\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n“On the 7th of August,” says M. Vilbort, “we took our leave of M. de\r\nBismarck, from whom we had received, before, during, and after the war,\r\na consistently kind reception, for which we are bound to express our\r\nliveliest acknowledgments. About 10 P.M. we were in the study of the\r\nPremier, when M. Benedette, the French ambassador, was announced. ‘Will\r\nyou take a cup of tea in the salon?’ M. de Bismarck said to me. ‘I\r\nwill be yours in a moment.’ Two hours passed away; midnight struck; one\r\no’clock. Some twenty persons, his family and intimate friends, awaited\r\ntheir host. At last he appeared, with a cheerful face and a smile upon\r\nhis lips. Tea was taken; there was smoking and beer, in German fashion.\r\nConversation turned, pleasantly or seriously, on Germany, Italy, and\r\nFrance. Rumors of a war with France were then current for the tenth time\r\nin Berlin. At the moment of my departure, I said:—‘M. le Ministre, will\r\nyou pardon me a very indiscreet question? Do I take war or peace with me\r\nback to Paris?’ M. de Bismarck replied, with animation, ‘Friendship, a\r\nlasting friendship with France! I entertain the firmest hope that France\r\nand Prussia, in the future, will represent the dualism of intelligence\r\nand progress.’ Nevertheless, it seemed to us that at these words we\r\nsurprised a singular smile on the lips of a man who is destined to play\r\na distinguished part in Prussian politics, the Privy Councillor Baron\r\nvon ——. We visited him the next morning, and admitted to him how much\r\nreflection this smile had caused us. ‘You leave for France to-night,’ he\r\nreplied; ‘well, give me your word of honor to preserve the secret I am\r\nabout to confide to you until you reach Paris. Ere a fortnight is past\r\nwe shall have war on the Rhine, if France insists upon her territorial\r\ndemands. She asks of us what we neither will nor can give. Prussia\r\nwill not cede an inch of German soil; we can not do so without raising\r\nthe whole of Germany against us, and, if it be necessary, let it rise\r\nagainst France rather than ourselves.’ This step of the Cabinet of the\r\nTuileries, especially impolitic and unskillful at such a moment, served\r\nM. de Bismarck, on the other hand, in all his German undertakings. He\r\nfound in it an irresistible argument to prove the necessity of great\r\narmaments against France, while, at the same time, his refusal to give up\r\nthe smallest portion of German territory elevated the dignity of Prussia\r\nin the eyes of all patriots; nor did it benefit the Minister less, who\r\nthus upheld the national standard high and firmly in the sight of the\r\nforeigner. Thus it happened that, after half a century, the Napoleonistic\r\npolicy for the second time divided two great nations, who, by their\r\nintellectual, moral, and material development, by all their interests and\r\naspirations, are destined to form a fraternal alliance, and thus insure\r\nthe freedom and peace of Europe on an infrangible basis.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of September, 1866, Bismarck, after a short rest, was able to\r\nassume the place of honor which was his due in the memorable triumphant\r\nentry of the troops to Berlin, as Major-General and Chief of the Seventh\r\nHeavy Landwehr Regiment of Horse, to which his grateful Sovereign had\r\nappointed him. Immediately before the King there rode, in one rank,\r\nCount Bismarck, the War Minister General von Roon, General von Moltke,\r\nthe Chief of the General Staff, General von Voigts-Rheetz as Chief of\r\nthe General Staff of the First Army, and General von Blumenthal as Chief\r\nof the General Staff of the Second; while the King was immediately\r\nfollowed by the Royal Princes and other commanders. There was a great and\r\nintelligent recognition in this Royal order of arrangement.\r\n\r\nAs may be understood, the loud rejoicings on the occasion of this\r\nmagnificent festival of victory were in honor of the Army and its Royal\r\nCommander-in-Chief; but many an eye followed, with grateful admiration\r\nand emotion, the powerful form of the Minister-President, in the white\r\nuniform, with the yellow collar and accoutrements of his regiment,\r\nwearing the orange sash of the Exalted Order of the Black Eagle on his\r\nbroad chest, his flashing helmet being deeply pressed over his forehead,\r\nastride of his tall horse, riding along in so stately a manner, and\r\noccasionally saluting a friend, here and there, in a courteous way.\r\nScarcely one of the multitude whose acclamations met his ear even\r\nsuspected that the mighty man, in intolerable pain, could scarcely keep\r\nhimself upright in the saddle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNor could Bismarck altogether withdraw himself from the patriotic\r\nfestivals which accompanied and followed the triumphant entry of the\r\narmy. Too much was wanting where he was absent. We then saw him at\r\nthe monster dinner which was given in honor of him, and to Generals\r\nVon Roon and Von Moltke, by an enthusiastic assembly, formed of men\r\nof all parties. Zealous democrats then applauded the great statesman,\r\nand whoever was present on that occasion would have believed that\r\nBismarck was also popular, in the ordinary sense of the word. When the\r\nMinister-President, in the pithy speech in which he acknowledged the\r\ntoast pledged in his honor, said that the Berlin people, as this war\r\nhad shown, had their hearts, words, and hands in the right place, the\r\nenthusiasm knew no bounds, and the guests rushed from all quarters\r\nto pledge him again. When the storm had become somewhat allayed, the\r\nDirector, Dr. Bonnell, of the Friedrich’s Werder Gymnasium, was seen to\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBismarck seized his early teacher by both hands, and thanked him\r\nheartily for a poetic greeting with which he had presented him on his\r\nreturn, merrily regretting that he had not been able to reply in Alcaic\r\nverse. The Chief Burgomaster, sitting opposite him, asked whether the\r\nMinister-President sent his sons to the same institution. “Certainly,”\r\nanswered Bismarck; “and I myself was also a scholar of Bonnell!” And so\r\nintroduced his old teacher in the heartiest manner.\r\n\r\nAfter this festival, Bismarck’s last strength failed him. He went\r\ninto the country to Patbus, when he fell very ill, and only gradually\r\nrecovered after a long time, and then not wholly, but just enough to\r\nadmit of his return to business at Berlin in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL AND CHANCELLOR OF THE FEDERATION.\r\n\r\n    Conversation with M. de Vilbort.—Appearance as Chancellor.—M.\r\n    Bamberger’s Views.—Bismarck as an Orator.—The Luxemburg\r\n    Question.—Fall from his Horse.—Citizenship of Bülow.—Visit to\r\n    Holstein.—Speech to a Torchlight Procession.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Paris journal, _Le Siècle_, we extract the following report of a\r\nconversation which Count Bismarck had with a Parisian journalist on the\r\n10th of June, 1866:\r\n\r\n“On my arrival at Berlin, I was informed that M. de Bismarck was quite\r\ninaccessible. I was told, ‘Do not attempt to see him; you will only lose\r\ntime. He receives no one, but lives in the recesses of his cabinet, shut\r\nin with treble-locked doors. He only leaves it to wait upon the King, and\r\nhis closest advisers can scarcely obtain access to him.’ Nevertheless,\r\nI ventured to request an audience of the Prime Minister of the King of\r\nPrussia. M. de Bismarck immediately sent word that he would receive me in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n“When I entered that study—where the peace of Europe, as it were, was\r\nhanging by a thread, but which I found was only guarded by a bolt—I saw\r\nbefore me a man of tall stature, and of animated countenance. On his\r\nbroad, high, and smooth forehead, I perceived with some surprise the\r\npresence of much benevolence, mingled with persistency. Monsieur de\r\nBismarck is fair and somewhat bald; he wears a military mustache, and\r\nspeaks rather with soldier-like brevity than with diplomatic caution. His\r\nair is that of the aristocrat and courtier, improved by all the charm of\r\nthe most polished courtesy. He advanced to receive me, took me by the\r\nhand, led me to a seat, and offered me a cigar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL AND CHANCELLOR OF THE CONFEDERATION.]\r\n\r\n“‘Monsieur le Ministre,’ I said to him after a little preliminary\r\nconversation, ‘I, like many of my countrymen, am most anxious to be\r\nthoroughly enlightened on the true interests of the German nation.\r\nPermit me, therefore, to express myself with entire frankness. I am glad\r\nto confess that, in her foreign policy, Prussia seems, at the present\r\ntime, to be pursuing objects with which the French nation sympathizes\r\nin no ordinary manner, such as the complete emancipation of Italy from\r\nAustrian influence, and the establishment of an united Germany, based on\r\nuniversal suffrage. But is there not a flat contradiction between your\r\nPrussian and German policies? You declare a national parliament to be the\r\nonly fountain in which Germany can find rejuvenescence, the only form\r\nof supreme authority by which she can realize her future destiny. Yet,\r\nat the same time, you treat the Second Chamber at Berlin in the manner\r\nof Louis XIV., when he entered the Houses of Parliament whip in hand.\r\nIn France we do not admit the possibility of any association between\r\nabsolutism and democracy; and, to speak the whole truth, allow me to\r\nstate to you that in Paris your plan of a national parliament has not\r\nbeen considered as a serious one. It has been looked upon as an acutely\r\nconstructed engine of war, and it is generally believed that you are\r\nquite the man to break it up when it has served your purpose, the moment\r\nit seems to have become inconvenient or useless.’\r\n\r\n“‘_A la bonne heure_, you go at once to the root of things,’ replied\r\nM. de Bismarck. ‘In France, I know, I am as unpopular as in Germany.\r\nEverywhere I am held responsible for a state of things I did not create,\r\nbut which has been forced upon me as upon every one else. I am the\r\nscapegoat of public opinion; but that does not much trouble me. I follow\r\nout a plan, with a perfectly calm conscience, which I consider useful to\r\nmy country and to Germany.\r\n\r\n“‘As to the means to this end, I have used those within my reach,\r\nfor want of others. Much might be said as to the internal condition\r\nof Prussia. To judge of it impartially, it is necessary to study the\r\npeculiar character of the people of this country in the most thorough\r\nway. France and Italy are now compact social polities, each animated\r\nby one spirit and one sentiment; while, on the contrary, Germany is\r\ngiven up to individualism. Here, every one lives apart in his own\r\nnarrow corner, with his own opinions; his wife and children round him;\r\never suspicious of the Government, as of his neighbor; judging every\r\nthing from his personal point of view, and never from general grounds.\r\nThe sentiment of individualism and the necessity for contradiction are\r\ndeveloped to an inconceivable degree in the German. Show him an open\r\ndoor, and, rather than pass through it, he will insist on breaking a\r\nhole in the wall at its side. No government however it may act, will be\r\npopular in Prussia; the majority in the country will always be opposed to\r\nit; simply from its being the Government, and holding authority over the\r\nindividual, it is condemned to be constantly opposed by the moderates,\r\nand decried and despised by the ultras. This has been the common fate of\r\nall successive governments since the beginning of the dynasty. Neither\r\nliberal ministers, nor reactionary ministers, have found favor with our\r\npoliticians.’\r\n\r\n“And while thus passing in review the various governments and forms of\r\nrule which have existed since the foundation of the monarchy, M. de\r\nBismarck strove to prove to me, in brilliant, graphic language, sparkling\r\nwith wit, that the Auerswalds and the Manteuffels had shared the same\r\nfate as himself, and that Frederick William III., surnamed the Just, had\r\nsucceeded as little as Frederick William IV. in satisfying the Prussian\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n“‘They shouted,’ he added, ‘at the victories of Frederick the Great, but\r\nat his death they rubbed their hands at the thought of being delivered\r\nfrom the tyrant. Despite this antagonism, there exists a deep attachment\r\nto the royal house. No sovereign or minister, no government, can win the\r\nfavor of Prussian individualism. Yet all cry from the depths of their\r\nhearts, “God save the King!” And they obey when the King commands.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yet some say, M. le Ministre, that this discontent might grow into\r\nrebellion.’\r\n\r\n“‘The Government does not believe this need be feared, and does not fear\r\nit. Our revolutionists are not formidable. Their hostility exhausts\r\nitself in invectives against the Prime Minister, but they respect the\r\nKing. It is I who have done all the evil, and it is with me alone that\r\nthey are angry. Were they a little more impartial, perhaps they might\r\nsee that I have not acted otherwise, simply because I could not. In\r\nPrussia’s present position in Germany, and with Austria opposed to her,\r\nan army was an imperative necessity. In Prussia it is the only force\r\ncapable of discipline. I do not know if that is a French word?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly, M. le Ministre, and in France can also be applied.’\r\n\r\n“‘A Prussian who got his arm broken in a barricade,’ continued M. de\r\nBismarck, ‘would go home crestfallen, and his wife would look upon him as\r\na madman; but in the army he is an admirable soldier, and fights like a\r\nlion for the honor of his country. A party opposed to the Government has\r\nnot chosen to recognize the necessity imposed on us by circumstances of\r\nmaintaining a large military force, evident as that necessity has been.\r\nBut I could not hesitate, for my own part; by family, by education, I\r\nam the King’s man; and the King adhered to the idea of this military\r\norganization as firmly as to his crown, being convinced, heart and soul,\r\nof its indispensability. No one could make him yield or compromise the\r\npoint. At his age—he is seventy—and with his traditions, people persist\r\nin an idea; above all, if they feel it to be good. On the subject of the\r\narmy, I should add, I entirely agree with his view.\r\n\r\n“‘Sixteen years ago I was living as a country gentleman, when the\r\nKing appointed me the Envoy of Prussia at the Frankfurt Diet. I had\r\nbeen brought up in the admiration, I might almost say the worship, of\r\nAustrian policy. Much time, however, was not needed to dispel my youthful\r\nillusions with regard to Austria, and I became her declared opponent.\r\n\r\n“‘The humiliation of my country; Germany sacrificed to the interests\r\nof a foreign nation; a crafty and perfidious line of policy—these were\r\nnot things calculated to give me satisfaction. I was not aware that the\r\nfuture would call upon me to take any part in public events, but from\r\nthat period I conceived the idea, which at the present day I am still\r\npursuing, the idea of snatching Germany from Austrian oppression, or at\r\nleast that part of Germany whose tone of thought, religion, manners, and\r\ninterests, identify her destinies with Prussia—Northern Germany. In the\r\nplan which I brought forward, there has been no question of overthrowing\r\nthrones, of taking a duchy from one ruler, or some petty domain from\r\nanother; nor would the King have consented to such schemes. And then\r\nthere are all the interests of family relationship and concessions, a\r\nhost of antagonistic influences, against which I have had to sustain an\r\nhourly warfare.\r\n\r\n“‘But neither all this, nor the opposition with which I have had to\r\ncontend in Prussia, could prevent my devoting myself, heart and soul, to\r\nthe idea of a Northern Germany, constituted in her logical and natural\r\nform, under the ægis of Prussia. To attain this end I would brave all\r\ndangers, exile, the scaffold itself! I said to the Crown Prince, whose\r\neducation and natural tendencies incline him rather to the side of\r\nparliamentary government, what matter if they hang me, provided the rope\r\nby which I am hung bind this new Germany firmly to your throne?’\r\n\r\n“‘May I also ask, M. le Ministre, how you reconcile the principle of\r\nfreedom, embodied in the existence of a national parliament, with the\r\ndespotic treatment to which the Berlin Chamber has had to submit? How,\r\nabove all, have you been able to induce the King, the representative of\r\nthe principle of divine right, to accept universal suffrage, which is\r\n_par excellence_ the principle of democracy?’\r\n\r\n“M. de Bismarck answered with animation: ‘That is a victory achieved\r\nafter four years of struggle. When the King sent for me, four years ago,\r\nthe situation of affairs was most critical. His Majesty laid before me\r\na long list of liberal concessions, but not one of these concerned the\r\nmilitary question. I said to the King, “I accept; and the more liberal\r\nthe Government can prove itself the stronger it will be.” The Chamber has\r\nbeen obdurate on one side, and the Crown on the other. In the conflict\r\nI have remained by the King. My respect for him, all my antecedents,\r\nall the traditions of my family, made it my duty to do so. But that\r\nI am, either by nature or from principle, an adversary of national\r\nrepresentation, a born enemy of parliamentary government, is a perfectly\r\ngratuitous supposition.\r\n\r\n“‘During those discussions, when the Chamber of Berlin set itself in\r\nopposition to a line of policy imposed on Prussia by circumstances of\r\nmost pressing necessity, I would not separate myself from the King.\r\nBut no one has a right to insult me by the supposition that I am only\r\nmystifying Germany in bringing forward my project of a parliament. Should\r\nthe day come when, my task being accomplished, I find it impossible to\r\nreconcile my duties to my Sovereign with my duties as a statesman, I\r\nshall know how to retire without denying the work I have done.’\r\n\r\n“Such are substantially,” says M. Vilbort in conclusion, “the political\r\nopinions expressed to me by M. de Bismarck. His thoughts conveyed by my\r\npen, in another form, may have lost to some extent their emphasis; but I\r\nhave anxiously endeavored faithfully to reproduce them.”\r\n\r\nWe have placed this report of the intellectual Frenchman here on purpose,\r\nbecause Count Bismarck, independently of other interesting remarks, has\r\ngiven indications as to the course of his future policy not easily to\r\nbe misunderstood; for it may readily be conceived that we do not feel\r\ncalled upon to enlarge upon Bismarck’s policy in the last three years.\r\nWhat he has done in this period, and how he has done it, is vivid before\r\nthe eyes of every one, and fresh in every one’s memory, and there is\r\nscarcely time yet to incorporate it with history. Our readers will have\r\nconvinced themselves, that in contradistinction to others, we do not find\r\nthe last deeds and speeches of Bismarck inconsistent with his earlier\r\nacts and speeches; and we think we have demonstrated that the Bismarck\r\nof to-day has developed consequently from the Bismarck of 1847—that the\r\ngreat aristocratic statesman is still the “King’s man,” as he then was\r\nthe “Junker Hotspur,” or conservative party leader. The demand for the\r\nso-called indemnity, the amnesty, the direct elections, and all those\r\nthings which are sometimes praised and sometimes blamed and designated\r\n“Bismarck’s contradictions,” are only apparent contradictions, at once\r\nto be explained if thoroughly examined. It is very easy to hold very\r\ndifferent opinions on many points from those of Bismarck, and warmly as\r\nwe admire him, we do not regard him as infallible; but we think that it\r\nis necessary to be very careful in censuring his individual political\r\nacts, even where such unpleasant surprises occur, for actually a quite\r\nincomparable political instinct has fitted him for leadership, and has\r\ncaused him to discover ways and means not existing in any programme,\r\nsometimes coming into severe collision with theory, but in practice\r\neither have or will have great blessings in them for the Prussian kingdom\r\nand the German people.\r\n\r\nWe have depicted Bismarck in person at various ages; of latter years\r\nhe has altered but little at first sight. Those who have only seen\r\nhim in the distance at the Chamber or the Diet, looking round with his\r\neye-glass, looking through papers, or playing with his pencil, will only\r\nhave seen the tall form in the King’s plain blue uniform, with a single\r\nOrder—a cross hanging from the neck. It is necessary to draw nearer to\r\nobserve that time has done more than pass with a friendly greeting by the\r\nChancellor of the Diet. Such years of service as those of Bismarck, in\r\nthis period of his life, count double, like soldiers’ years. Bismarck,\r\naccording to this calculation, is more than fifty-four years of age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs an orator, too, the Chancellor of the Diet is almost the same as\r\nof old, only he has grown quieter. A member of the Diet, Herr L.\r\nBamberger, describes him in his book as follows:[55]—“Count Bismarck is\r\ncertainly no orator in the usual sense of the word, yet, in spite of\r\nmany defects in his delivery, he commands the attention of his audience\r\nby the evident force with which his thoughts work within him. It seems,\r\nbesides, as if the habit of speaking in public, and especially the\r\ncertainty which is so requisite, and which he now possesses of obtaining\r\nthe ear of his audience, has materially contributed of late years to\r\nthe development of his parliamentary faculty. Yet in the year 1866, one\r\nof his admirers, who had attended a sitting of the Reichstag, drew his\r\nportrait in the following terms:—‘No oratorical ornamentation, no choice\r\nof words, nothing which carries the audience away. His voice, although\r\nclear and audible, is dry and unsympathetic, the tone monotonous; he\r\ninterrupts himself, and stops frequently; sometimes even he stutters,\r\nas if his recalcitrant tongue refused obedience, and as if he had\r\ndifficulty in finding words in which to express his thoughts. His uneasy\r\nmovements, somewhat lolling and negligent, in no wise aid the effect\r\nof his delivery. Still, the longer he speaks, the more he overcomes\r\nthese defects; he attains more precision of expression, and often ends\r\nwith a well-delivered, vigorous—sometimes, as every one is aware, too\r\nvigorous—peroration.’” “It should be added,” observes Herr Bamberger,[56]\r\n“that his style, although unstudied, is often not wanting in imagery. His\r\nbright and clear intellect does not despise coloring, any more than his\r\nstrong constitution is free from nervous irritability.”\r\n\r\nThe same author says at another part of his book,[57] “To an opponent he\r\ncan be provoking, malicious, even malignant; but he is not treacherous;\r\nhe offends against morality and justice, but against good taste, by\r\npathetic appeals, never. He is not of the tribe of paragraph writers\r\nwho imagine that the world is governed by fine phrases, and that public\r\nevils are to be mastered by wrapping them up in pompous commonplaces. On\r\nthe contrary, he is one of those who delight in heightening a contrast\r\nby exaggeration, and who thus overshoot their mark. What induced him\r\nto confess his principle of blood and iron at that committee meeting?”\r\nThe instance is very unhappily chosen, without considering that by a\r\nblunder the so-called blood-and-iron theory is written, _Principe du fer\r\net du feu_,[58] for Bismarck never proclaimed this theory, with which\r\nPhilisters are made to shudder, at all. In an actually peaceable sense\r\nthere was a reference at that committee meeting of the 1st September,\r\n1862, as to sparing the effusion of blood and the use of iron. But it\r\nis useless to say this, and to reiterate it; Bismarck has been credited\r\nwith the blood-and-iron theory, and his it will remain, for it has been\r\nproverbial as a “winged word.”[59]\r\n\r\nAnother description of Bismarck as an orator (by Glagau) we extract from\r\nthe _Daheim_.\r\n\r\n“The chivalrous personality of Count Bismarck, his easy carriage, and,\r\nabove all, his universal fame as a diplomatist and statesman, lead us\r\nto expect him also to be a brilliant speaker; either one who could\r\nbring forth a deeply meditated, well arranged speech without hesitation\r\nor trouble, in an elegant flow, or, still more, a speaker of natural\r\neloquence, whose thoughts and figures arise in the soul during his\r\nspeech, the play of whose words and rhetorical figures, born of the\r\nmoment, leap in winged dance from the lips, who poetizes in his speech\r\nlike an improvisatore, whose lightning thoughts and catchwords hit the\r\nmark, moving, and burning the hearts of his auditors. Neither of these.\r\nCertainly, a few moments before, with a swift pen, he has written a few\r\nnotes on a narrow slip of paper, which looks like a recipe, over which\r\nhe, while turning his thumbs one over the other, balancing the upper\r\npart of his body backwards and forwards, and speaking to the House,\r\noccasionally casts a glance; but, nevertheless, he stops, and hesitates,\r\neven sometimes stammers and repeats himself; he appears to struggle with\r\nhis thoughts, and the words clamber over his lips in a half-reluctant\r\nway. After two or three words he continually pauses, and one seems\r\nto hear an inarticulate sob. He speaks without gestures, pathos, and\r\nintonation, without laying a stress on any particular word; sometimes he\r\naccentuates the final syllable or the halting verb in a manner totally\r\nwrong. Can this be the man who has now a parliamentary career of twenty\r\nyears behind him?—who already belonged in the Diet of 1847, as Deputy of\r\nthe Saxon chivalry, to the leaders and promptest speakers of the then\r\nexceeding extreme right; who set the liberal majority into excitement\r\nand rage in 1849 and 1850, as a member of the Second Chamber and of\r\nthe Erfurt Union Parliament; who, finally, has, almost singly, opposed\r\na closed phalanx of progressists, as Minister-President, since 1862,\r\nrepaying their emotional speeches, full of self-confidence and security,\r\nin almost the same coin, replying to their mocking and malicious attacks\r\nupon him on the spot, and with flashing presence of mind even exciting\r\nthem to the combat by witty impromptus and cutting sarcasms, often\r\nwounding them to the soul?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is the same man; and, when requisite, he is as acute and biting\r\nas of yore, although, since his great victories, he has adopted more\r\nof statesmanlike earnestness, quiet objectivity, and a conciliating\r\ncarriage, corresponding to his present universally admitted greatness.\r\nGradually his speech begins to flow and to warm, and soon unfolds its\r\nespecial charm—that original and fresh, free and straightforward mode of\r\nexpression to which we, in our commonplace days, were quite unaccustomed.\r\nHence it has been called by his opponents ‘paradoxical,’ ‘frivolous,’\r\nand ‘scholastic.’ We are indebted to them for a whole vocabulary of\r\nsentences, such as ‘Cataline existences,’ ‘People who have missed their\r\nvocation,’ ‘Blood and iron,’ ‘Austria should transfer her centre of\r\ngravity to Ofen,’ ‘This conflict must not be taken too tragically,’ and\r\nwhich soon became proverbially current, and, in the mean time, have\r\nrevealed their deep truth and apposite precision. How true and exact,\r\nand, at the same time, how colored and tangible, is his definition of the\r\nnational character of the Germans, on the occasion of the introduction of\r\nthe Bill for the Constitution of the Confederation, which has hitherto\r\nprevented the attainment of a great united fatherland. ‘It is, as it\r\nseems to me,’ says Count Bismarck, ‘a certain superfluity in the feelings\r\nof manly self-consciousness which in Germany causes the individual, the\r\ncommunity, the race, to depend more upon their own powers than upon those\r\nof the totality. It is the deficiency of that readiness of the individual\r\nand the race to merge itself in favor of the commonwealth, that readiness\r\nwhich has enabled our neighbor nations to secure, at an earlier period,\r\nthose benefits after which we are striving.’ And when the orator, at the\r\nend of his speech, exhorts the House to fulfill their task as soon and as\r\nperfectly as possible, he continues:—‘For the German nation, gentlemen,\r\nhas a right to expect from us that we should preclude the possibility\r\nof a recurrence of such a catastrophe (_i.e._, a German war); and I am\r\nconvinced that you, together with the allied government, have nothing\r\nso nearly at heart as to fulfill this just anticipation of the German\r\nnation.’ With this beautiful exhortation, simply, but worthily and\r\nwarmly, uttered, like the greatest of orators, he electrified the whole\r\nassembly, for tumultuous applause resounded from all the benches.”\r\n\r\nNext to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation, the Luxemburg\r\nquestion, in the year 1867, principally drew attention to Bismarck.\r\nProbably many of those who in the pride of recent victory then demanded\r\nwar for the former Federal fortress, have become convinced that\r\nBismarck’s measured attitude was full of high political wisdom. At\r\nBismarck’s dinner-table, a short time after Luxemburg had been declared\r\nneutral, a learned man gave it as his opinion that Prussia ought to\r\nhave made it a _casus belli_ with France. Bismarck answered very\r\nseriously:—“My dear Professor, such a war would have cost us at least\r\nthirty thousand brave soldiers, and in the best event would have brought\r\nus no gain. Whoever has once looked into the breaking eye of a dying\r\nwarrior on the battle-field, will pause ere he begins a war.” And, after\r\ndinner, when he was walking in the garden with some guests, he stopped\r\non a lawn, and related how he had paced to and fro upon this place in\r\ndisquiet and deep emotion in those momentous days of June. He awaited the\r\nroyal decision in an anguish of fear. When he came indoors again, his\r\nwife asked what had happened that he looked so overcome. “I am excited\r\nfor the very reason that nothing has happened,” he replied, and went into\r\nhis study. A few minutes later, shortly before midnight, he received the\r\nroyal decision—the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nFrom the 5th to the 14th of June, 1867, Count Bismarck remained at Paris\r\nin the suite of the King, where he became an object of general attention.\r\nThe Parisians could not picture our Minister-President in any other way\r\nthan in his white uniform of Cuirassiers. A regular flood of generally\r\nhorribly bad pictures of him were sold at a sou per copy—the white\r\nuniform alone showing that Bismarck was the subject.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of June to the beginning of August he visited his family at\r\nVarzin, an estate in Farther Pomerania, which he had bought in the spring.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1867, he was appointed Chancellor of the North\r\nGerman Confederation, went in the beginning of August to the King at\r\nEms, and on the 15th of August opened the session of the Council of the\r\nFederation at Berlin. On the 15th of November the Diet was opened, and\r\non the 29th of February, 1868, it was closed. On the 23d of March the\r\nReichstag of the North German Confederation was opened, and to this the\r\nCustoms Parliament was added; it was no wonder, therefore, that under\r\nthe gigantic load of work the strength of the Minister-President at last\r\ngave way altogether. In the June of 1868 he was taken seriously ill, and\r\nit was only at the end of the month that he was able to go to Varzin,\r\nwhere, in complete retirement and entire abstinence from all regular\r\nbusiness, he very slowly mended; but was not able to regain his strength,\r\nin consequence of nervous sleeplessness. He seemed to feel the obstacles\r\nto his activity even more than all his illness. “Send me no secretary\r\nhither, or I shall go to work again!” he was heard querulously to\r\nexclaim. Despite of all public notifications, a flood of letters pursued\r\nhim to Varzin; the whole correspondence, as might be naturally supposed,\r\nhad to be returned unopened to Berlin, where it was estimated that during\r\nthis stay at Varzin the Minister-President had been solicited for aid to\r\nthe extent of not less than a million and a half of thalers.[60]\r\n\r\nWhen at last he had grown somewhat better, Bismarck had the misfortune,\r\non the 21st of August, to have a dangerous fall from his horse. He\r\nhad gone out riding with his friends, Moritz von Blankenburg and the\r\nLegation’s Rath von Keudell, on a meadow near Puddiger, one of his farms,\r\na German mile and a quarter from Varzin; his horse put his foot into a\r\nhole, fell, and fell with all its weight upon his body. So severe a fall\r\nmight have had still sadder results, but such as they were they were\r\nsad enough, and weeks of severe pain again had to be endured, often not\r\nunmixed with many fears. At the very time when the foreign newspapers\r\nwere picturing the most secret and wonderful activity in the Chancellor,\r\nhe was lying prostrate in the most dangerous state. It need hardly be\r\nsaid that most anxious looks were directed towards Varzin—that general\r\nexcitement eagerly anticipated news from thence, and that many hearts\r\nbreathed lightly again when better intelligence arrived. The news was\r\nbetter than, properly speaking, it had any right to have been, but,\r\nfortunately, it has been justified by time.\r\n\r\nThe delight at the good news from Varzin was shown in the most various\r\nways, especially in presents of remedies against sleeplessness. Bismarck\r\nwas particularly amused with an old soldier, who advised him to smoke a\r\npound of Porto Rico tobacco every day: he sent the old warrior a pipe\r\nand a quantity of tobacco, with the request that he would be so good as\r\nto smoke for him.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October the Burgomaster of Bülow arrived, with a deputation\r\nof the magistracy and town council, and brought the Minister-President\r\nthe honorary diploma of the citizenship of the town. Bismarck received\r\nthe gentlemen from Bülow with special friendliness, and said, among other\r\nthings, that he accepted the diploma with the greater satisfaction, as\r\nBülow had ever shown itself a patriotic and loyal city. After dinner, he\r\noffered the deputation the hospitality of his house for the night. But\r\nthe respectable citizens declared that they had promised their careful\r\nand inquisitive wives to return before midnight, and that they must,\r\ntherefore, keep their words. On this the Countess turned merrily to her\r\nhusband and said: “As you are now also a citizen of Bülow, I should be\r\nvery glad if you would, from this time, follow the good example of your\r\ncolleagues of Bülow!” Bismarck laughed and shrugged his shoulders, but\r\nreturned no answer.\r\n\r\nThe fresh and vigorous manner with which Bismarck has since returned\r\nto his duties, allows us to hope that his long and severe illness is\r\nquite at an end. He has certainly never thought of sparing himself when\r\nduty called; but he takes part freely in hunting parties, for the free\r\nair of the forest is his best medicine, and in the month of December he\r\nwas present at several parties in the Province of Saxony, in the Mark,\r\nand even in Holstein. In Holstein, at Ahrensburg, where he hunted for\r\ntwo days with Count Schimmelmann, a brilliant torchlight procession was\r\nformed in his honor.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of December, shortly before the Count’s departure, a long\r\ntrain of several hundred people, young and old, with two hundred\r\nflaming pitch torches, appeared in the castle-yard, preceded by a\r\nband, and followed by sixty mounted yeomanry. After the leader of the\r\nprocession had announced that they had come to pay their respects to the\r\nMinister-President, Count Bismarck approached the window, before the\r\ncrowd, and spoke to the following effect:—\r\n\r\n“I am rejoiced that you thus salute me as a fellow-countryman, and I\r\nthank you for the honor you do me. I see in it a proof that the feeling\r\nof solidarity has also grown stronger and stronger with you; and of this\r\nI shall joyfully inform the King. We have always belonged to each other\r\nas Germans—we have ever been brothers—but we were unconscious of it. In\r\nthis country, too, there were different races: Schleswigers, Holsteiners,\r\nand Lauenburgers; as, also, Mecklenburgers, Hanoverians, Lübeckers, and\r\nHamburgers exist, _and they are all free to remain what they are_, in the\r\nknowledge that _they are Germans_—that they are brothers. And here in the\r\nnorth we should be doubly aware of it, with our Platt Deutsch language,\r\nwhich stretches from Holland to the Polish frontier: we _were_ also\r\nconscious of it, but have not proclaimed it until now. But that we have\r\nagain so joyfully and vividly been able to recognize our German descent\r\nand solidarity—for that we must thank the man whose wisdom and energy\r\nhave rendered this consciousness a truth and a fact, in bringing our King\r\nand Lord a hearty cheer. Long live His Majesty, our most gracious King\r\nand Sovereign, William the First!”\r\n\r\nA threefold cheer was heard throughout the castle-yard. The torch-bearers\r\nand pedestrians then accompanied the honored man to the railway station\r\nhard by, where the farmers, who had led the procession on horseback, were\r\nintroduced to the Count, and were greeted by him in friendly accents. A\r\nhurrah of many hundreds of voices followed the train as it glided away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA BALL AT BISMARCK’S.\r\n\r\n            Beauty and might,\r\n            With honor bedight,\r\n            Assembled by night,\r\n            Shining so bright:\r\n    And what was not flower a plant would be—\r\n    Come not for dancing, but just to see.\r\n\r\n    Interior of Bismarck’s House at Berlin.—Arrival of Guests.—The\r\n    King.—The Queen.—The Royal Princes.—The Generals.—Committee of\r\n    Story-tellers in the Refreshment Room.—Supper.—The Ball.—Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have entitled this chapter, “A Ball at Bismarck’s,” for reasons\r\nof brevity and alliteration, for in truth, at these great evening\r\nassemblies, with supper after midnight, the ball is a secondary object\r\nfor the majority of the guests. This arrangement, entirely imported from\r\nEngland, pleases us as little as the English expression “rout,” for the\r\nprincipal peculiarity of it is that double the number of guests are\r\ninvited than can find room in the apartments, and such a system is very\r\nmuch at variance with our old-fashioned notions of German hospitality.\r\nThe institution of a “rout” is only tolerable when the greater number\r\nof the guests only come for a quarter of an hour, and then disappear\r\nto attend another “rout.” The continual arrival of fresh individuals,\r\nthe continual variation in the faces, may then possess a charm of\r\nits own. But this does not take place at Bismarck’s, for when the\r\n“Minister-President and the Countess of Bismarck-Schönhausen” send out\r\ntheir invitations, no house in Berlin has the courage to vie with them\r\nand open its door on the same evening. The consequence of this is, that\r\nall the guests arrive early and stop as long as ever they can. Now, as we\r\nhave already said, the apartments at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are\r\nexceedingly small, and thus there is a crush of which it is impossible\r\nto form any idea unless one has seen it. Add to this the temperature of\r\nthe dog-days in the brilliantly lighted saloons, and the impossibility\r\nof sitting down; an enjoyment only appreciated to its full extent by the\r\nmembers of the Reichstag and Deputies of the Diet, who here find ample\r\nopportunity, after their long plenary and committee sittings, to stand.\r\n\r\nThe guest reaches the first saloon by the stairs, through a forest\r\nof tropical plants and orange-groves, with livery servants sprinkled\r\nin, to the place where the Minister-President, in his white uniform,\r\nwith the star and collar of his Order, aided by his wife, receives the\r\nguests, interchanging a few friendly expressions with them, and then\r\nthey enter. But after this the guest literally founders in the ocean of\r\ndazzling light and crowds of people; it is only after a considerable\r\ninterval that a person, unless accustomed for years to these parties,\r\nrecovers his self-possession. At first he hears single words in the noise\r\naround him; gradually he learns to understand them; and then come long\r\nsentences which he is able to comprehend. Next comes the second stage;\r\nhe observes that he is swimming between rosy red and pale blue, clouds\r\nof garments of various textures; he recognizes with absolute ecstasy the\r\ngolden threads which pass through these clouds; the soft sounds of the\r\nyielding substances are varied by the sharp rustling of silk and the\r\nbrilliant gleam of crackling satin; then he perceives rounded shoulders,\r\nshining necks, wavy locks, smiling faces—the happy man sees them all,\r\nfor he is walking towards a group of ladies. He walks? No, he rather\r\ncreeps, or pushes himself forward without lifting his feet. Beautiful\r\nMother Nature in her wisdom has instinctively taught him that he must\r\nnecessarily tread upon some lady’s train if he raise his foot a quarter\r\nof a line from the floor. Thus he shoves himself along on the left flank\r\nof the battalion, whence beautiful eyes are flashing in competition\r\nwith gold and jewels. This danger he can encounter, for all this fire\r\nis not directed at him, the worn-out man of fifty. He is looking round\r\nin astonishment, and then comes a sudden block, for it is impossible to\r\nbreak through the new group standing right in front. Court gala uniforms,\r\nblack coats with broad bands of various orders, civil uniforms with\r\ngolden embroidery, and officers with silver—every place is taken up, and\r\nthe wearers are standing shoulder to shoulder in humming conversation.\r\nNothing but strange faces! Suddenly a very large hand, but of course in\r\na delicate glove, certainly specially made for this great, good hand, is\r\nlaid upon the arm of the anxious undecided one, a well-known face greets\r\nhim in a friendly way, and a well-known voice says, “Good-evening, dear\r\nold fellow!” But he scarcely recognizes his tried patron and friend, for\r\nhe had never seen him in full uniform with the orange and white sash.\r\nWhen, however, he sees who it is, a great feeling of satisfaction comes\r\nover him—he is no longer alone, and he is safe. Other acquaintances\r\nappear, remarks are interchanged, there is even recreation, but under\r\ndifficulties. People push here and there, and are pushed in return;\r\nit is impossible to penetrate to the ball-room, but the music of the\r\nCuirassier Guard Regiment can be heard very well, and sometimes a servant\r\nwith a tray full of ices is captured by the more daring—a real grace in\r\nthis heat. It is very comical to hear every one complaining of want of\r\nroom and heat, and yet none of the complainants seem to have any idea of\r\ngetting rid of these disagreeables in the simplest manner in the world,\r\nby going away!\r\n\r\nSuddenly all the heads, decked with feathers, flowers, and jewels, bow\r\nslowly and then rise again; it is as if the evening breeze passed gently\r\nover the meadow, the flowers all bending up and down, hither and thither.\r\n\r\nKing William is entering, conducted by the Minister-President. The\r\nstately royal man bows with chivalrous politeness, now to this lady,\r\nnow to that; he pronounces kind words, which are really more kind and\r\nfewer in number than is usually the case. Here he shakes hands with one\r\ngeneral, there he nods to another gentleman—the path by which the King\r\nhas passed is marked by proud and happy faces. Those who feel disposed to\r\njeer, can not in the least know how a Prussian feels when the King’s hand\r\ntouches his own, and the King’s eye looks so grandly and mildly into his.\r\n\r\nBut to enjoy a really heart-warming sight, King William and Bismarck must\r\nbe seen together. The great hero, Prince Eugene, or Eugenio von Savoye,\r\nas he wrote it in Italian, German, and French, once said of the three\r\nEmperors whom he had served—“Leopold was my father, Joseph my friend,\r\nCarl is my sovereign!” In Bismarck’s conduct towards the King may be seen\r\nthe reverence for a father, the attachment of a friend, and the fullest\r\nrespect for a sovereign. An unique spectacle, this!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow the Queen passes through the brilliant throng, dressed with royal\r\nsimplicity; she speaks with several of the members of the Reichstag.\r\nWhen the sailing boat passes through the waves of the sea, when the swan\r\nglides over the shining mirror, a silver line marks the passage they have\r\ntaken. Such a line denotes the path which the Queen had followed through\r\nthe throng.\r\n\r\nThe whole Royal House is present.\r\n\r\nThe tall stately man yonder, with the brave handsome countenance, who\r\nlooks still taller in his light blue dragoon uniform with the yellow\r\ncollar, in which he is not often seen, is the Crown Prince. He is engaged\r\nin animated conversation with a foreign diplomatist, in a golden full\r\ndress, and is evidently in the best of tempers. Prince Albrecht, the\r\nKing’s younger brother, passes swiftly in a frank military manner,\r\nshaking one or the other person cordially by the hand. His elder brother,\r\nPrince Carl, the Commander-in-Chief, is a singular contrast to him.\r\nHe stands erect and proudly in the middle of a circle, but without\r\nstiffness. A mocking smile plays over his features; there is a remarkable\r\nintermixture in his eyes of sharp observation and indifference. How he\r\nbrings first this person and then that to his side, without raising his\r\nhand! This is the reproachless manner of a _grand seigneur_ of days\r\ngone by; one can not but feel that Prince Carl still retains whole and\r\nundivided the princely consciousness of former times. In his eyes every\r\none—not of princely rank—stands on the same level. Rank, titles, honors,\r\nhave no distinction in his eyes. He is as gracious to the ministers and\r\nhigh dignitaries, as to the author whom he has just summoned to him. He\r\nalone really exercises the _métier de prince_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYonder stalwart form, with the good brave countenance, in the admiral’s\r\nuniform, is Prince Adalbert, a cousin of the King; he is talking with\r\nHerr von Selchow, the Minister of Agriculture, who at a distance looks\r\nlike an officer in the cavalry. All the princes of the Royal House, wear\r\nthe Cross of the Order _pour le mérite_, and therefore have all been\r\nunder fire.\r\n\r\nPrince Frederick Carl yonder is talking with Count Eulenburg, who has\r\nmade his way through typhoons and Japan to the Ministry of the Interior.\r\nThe Prince, with his high forehead, firm bearded countenance, large eyes\r\nwith their lonely quiet expression, and spare form, in the red jacket of\r\nthe Ziethen Hussars, is the hero of Düppel and Sadowa, also a member of\r\nthe North German Reichstag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll the faces in yonder group are well known, for their portraits hang in\r\nevery window; they have written their names in the book of history with\r\nthe sword. At every step here one may greet a hero. Certainly, designed\r\nand undesigned mistakes sometimes happen, as, for instance, that pretty\r\nyoung lady can not sufficiently wonder that the valiant old Steinmetz,\r\nthe famous hero of Nachod and Skalitz, is still so young, and dresses\r\nin private clothes. They had pointed her out a Reichstag Deputy from\r\nPomerania as the famous General, and left her in the error.\r\n\r\nThrough the brilliant throng and excitement, in the dazzling\r\nilluminations and heat, children wise in their generation, and lucky dogs\r\nwho know every thing, have discovered the way to obtain a thorough course\r\nof refreshments, which is hidden in a dark thicket yonder, and slyly wins\r\nin semi-concealment. In noble silver vases there is cool—deliciously\r\ncool—beer. All the thirsty souls who drink at this fount sing the praises\r\nof Bismarck, for he has introduced this innovation. Bismarck first made\r\nbeer fashionable in Berlin _salons_. And so readily has it been received\r\nwithin a short time, that even tender ladies and high princes no longer\r\nhesitate to pay their court openly to King Gambrinus.\r\n\r\nThere is lively conversation over the beer. A wit has spread a rumor\r\nthat the delicious drink has come from Schwechat, and is a present from\r\nthe Austrian Imperial Chancellor to the Chancellor of the North German\r\nConfederation. Some give a friendly assent to this, others kindly add,\r\nthat Bismarck has already, in return, sent some Neunaugen and Flunder\r\nfrom Pomerania, to his colleague in Vienna; and why should it not be\r\nbelieved? Formerly, at any rate, the most friendly and social relations\r\nexisted between Bismarck and Beust.\r\n\r\nAn old Colonel D—— mutters something like “_timeo Danaos_,” but swallows\r\nthe rest of the words, as he can not immediately find the Latin\r\nterminations in the lumber-room of his memory, but instead, enjoys\r\nanother goblet of the supposed gift. He is almost frightened when his\r\nneighbor remarks, that Beust as well as Bismarck is a descendant of an\r\nAlt Mark family; Büste, the family seat of the Beust family, is only\r\ndistant a few miles from Bismarck; certainly, the family had not lived\r\nthere for a long time. Colonel D—— begins to have a better opinion of the\r\nAustrian Chancellor, and drinks up his beer in comfort.\r\n\r\nAnother is telling how Bismarck laughingly said, that “his colleague, the\r\nMinister of Finance, would to-day convince himself that this dwelling\r\nwas much too small for the Minister-President, and would think of how he\r\ncould get him out of the difficulty.” Thus the little circle got happily\r\ninto the downward way of telling anecdotes, whence there is no return.\r\n\r\nTo a somewhat complaining deputation from the new provinces, Bismarck\r\ngood-humoredly explained that Prussia was like a woollen jacket, very\r\nunpleasant at first, but when people got accustomed to it they found it\r\nvery comfortable, and at last came to think it a great benefit.\r\n\r\nBismarck allowed another deputation to whine for a long time about\r\nuniversal military service and the weight of taxation; he then said, very\r\nseriously and in a tone of the greatest astonishment, “Dear me, these\r\ngentlemen probably thought they could become Prussians for nothing!”\r\n\r\nA well-known politician promulgated a very paradoxical statement at\r\nBismarck’s dinner-table; some one present started forward to refute it.\r\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself,” exclaimed Bismarck; “if you will only\r\nhave patience for two minutes, the learned Herr Professor will at once\r\ncontradict himself in the most brilliant manner!”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1848 there was a great deal rumored about a falling away of\r\nthe Rhine Provinces. “Where are they going to fall to?” asked Bismarck.\r\n\r\n“And in France they no longer say, ‘_travailler pour le roi de Prusse_’\r\nto indicate a lost labor of love, but ‘_travailler pour le maître de M.\r\nde Bismarck_!’” whispered a fat diplomatist cautiously to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n“How is it,” King William merrily once asked the Minister-President and\r\nhis cousin Herr von Bismarck-Briest, “that the Bismarcks of Schönhausen\r\nare all such tall, strapping fellows, and those of Briest the contrary?”\r\nCount Bismarck replied, “Because my ancestors all served the King as\r\nsoldiers in battle, while my cousins were engaged in civil affairs!” Herr\r\nvon Bismarck-Briest added, with presence of mind, “That is why I have put\r\nmy seven sons into the army.”\r\n\r\nIt was true that six Bismarck-Briests fought in the last war under the\r\nKing’s standard; a pity that the seventh was not there, but as a Landrath\r\nhe was “exempt.”\r\n\r\n“But,” whispered a pale assessor, who has been guilty of innumerable\r\nverses, “Bismarck is deficient in æsthetic culture; I have heard from the\r\nbest authority, that once at Frankfurt, when Goethe’s pearl, ‘Happy he\r\nwho closes up his door without hatred of the world!’ was performed on the\r\npiano, Bismarck burst out with, ‘What a tailor’s soul this Goethe had!’”\r\n\r\nThe pale assessor looked as if such barbarism froze him; some laughed,\r\nothers shrugged their shoulders.\r\n\r\n“The ideas of the moment were confused with opinions or meaning!” said a\r\nProvincial Government Councillor, who knew how to combine his reverence\r\nfor Bismarck with his æsthetic aspirations; for in fact he only knew\r\nBismarck and Goethe.\r\n\r\n“I remember you in my boyish days very well,” said Bismarck, in 1864,\r\nto the Body-Physician of Prince Albrecht, the Privy-Councillor Dr. von\r\nArnim; “you then enormously struck me with your energy.”\r\n\r\n“This is completely altered now,” replied Arnim, quietly; “you now strike\r\nme enormously with yours.”\r\n\r\nThe negroes in America are very fond of assuming fine names of famous\r\nmen, such as Cæsar, Scipio, Hannibal, Aurelius, Washington, King James,\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and so forth. One of these black gentlemen got very\r\ndrunk, and shouted like a madman; he was seized and put into prison,\r\nbut brought sober before the magistrate the next morning. “What is your\r\nname?” The negro answered, with great dignity, “Count Bismarck.” There\r\nwas Homeric laughter. The magistrate said, “You are discharged; one must\r\noverlook a little from any one bearing so great a name; but for the\r\nfuture take care to do your illustrious god-cousin in Berlin more credit!”\r\n\r\nThere was no end to this. Anecdote succeeded anecdote, one joke the\r\nother; each departing story-teller leaving another in his place, until\r\nthe circle round the altar of Gambrinus was broken up by the news that\r\ntheir Majesties and the Court, after having partaken of supper in the\r\nCountess’s salon, had taken their departure. This was the signal for\r\nsupper for the rest of the guests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA buffet supper is the saddest conclusion of a “rout”—it is almost\r\nsomewhat humiliating to stand with one’s hat under one’s arm and the\r\nplate in one’s hand, after having had great difficulty to procure knife,\r\nfork, and all the other utensils employed in civilized nations for the\r\nbusiness of eating! But humanity can even support this, and with a little\r\ncare and patience it is possible gradually to get a complete supper, from\r\na cup of soup to a fruit-ice. Modest minds content themselves certainly\r\nby absorbing a gigantic portion of ham-pie with a spoon—or whatever the\r\nfortune of war has favored their plates with—ask for nothing more—but\r\n“go in” for the wine, which is foaming in any quantity.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the dance music is beginning again, and with it the\r\nactual period of enjoyment for dancers, and the terrible hour for\r\nchaperonizing mothers and aunts, who sit out the last cotillon with a\r\nheroism brave unto death.\r\n\r\nThe non-dancing guests now really begin to enjoy themselves—the crowd\r\nbeing no longer so thick, there is more room, as the saloons reserved\r\nfor the Court are now open, and there are plenty of seats. Presently\r\na smoking-room suddenly opens—a smoking-room with noble cigars, iced\r\nchampagne, and hot coffee. Everywhere one sees the Minister-President\r\nbusy among his guests, conversing in the most agreeable tone, seeing\r\nthat there is nothing wanting, inviting every one to drink, and himself\r\nrejoicing in the gayety he disperses. And whoever departs at about five\r\nin the morning, with a hearty shake of the hand from Bismarck, will\r\ncertainly carry away with him the impression that the First Minister of\r\nPrussia is also the most delightful host in Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK’S HOUSE AT BERLIN.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis but a hut or little more,\r\n    The threshold narrow, slim the door—\r\n    And yet within this space so wee,\r\n    Proudly uprears the laurel-tree.\r\n\r\n    Bismarck’s House in ordinary Costume.—Its History.—“Sultan\r\n    Uilem and Grand Vizier Bi-Smarck.”—“Bismarck, _grand homme_,\r\n    Bakschisch!”—The Cuckoo Clock.—Daily Habits.—Sunday at\r\n    Bismarck’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that portion of the Wilhelms-Strasse at Berlin, which has remained\r\ncomparatively quiet, although it is bounded on one side by the animated\r\nand famous street Unter den Linden, and on the other by the noisy and\r\nbusy Leipziger-Strasse, one of the arteries of Berlin circulation, not\r\nfar from the Wilhelms-Platz, stands a plain one-storied house, with\r\ntwelve windows in the front—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs—since 1862\r\nthe official residence of Count Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIt is the most modest ministerial residence in Berlin; in no large State\r\nof Europe does the Foreign Minister live so quietly as Count Bismarck\r\ndoes here. To the right of the Minister-President is the Hotel of\r\nPrince Radziwill—_entre cour et jardin_—with its railings and stately\r\nfront court; to the left is the building of the Royal Privy Court\r\nPrinting-office of Messrs. Von Decker; opposite the former Palace of the\r\nOrder of St. John of Balley Brandenburg, so magnificently restored by\r\nSchinckel, and now the property of Prince Carl of Prussia. One advantage\r\nBismarck’s dwelling enjoys, with all the aristocratic houses of the\r\nWilhelms-Strasse—it has a large garden with fine old trees in it, which\r\nextends as far as the Königsgrätzer-Strasse.\r\n\r\nThe whole extent of the Wilhelms-Strasse, from the Linden to the\r\nLeipziger-Strasse, formerly belonged to the Thurgarten—the freehold\r\nbeing the King’s. On the enlargement of the city by Frederick William\r\nI., this site was given to the generals and higher officials as free\r\nbuilding-ground, and was supported by the King with his well-known\r\nenergy by building materials and other subventions. The present site\r\nof Wilhelms-Strasse and Königsgrätzer-Strasse, by the privilege of the\r\n21st of September, 1736, was covered by a free house, respecting the\r\nbuilder of which there is still some question. It was unquestionably the\r\nwork of one General von Pannewitz; probably Wolf Adolf von Pannewitz,\r\nborn the 13th March, 1679, at Great-Gaglov, in Lower Lausitz, who had\r\nbeen Page and Equerry to King Frederick I., and had joined the regiment\r\nof Gensdarmes in 1714, from the disbanded Garde du Corps. He became\r\nlieutenant-colonel of this regiment in 1719, in 1725 commander, and in\r\n1728, after the death of Field-Marshal General von Natzmer, its Chief.\r\nPannewitz had gained renown on the Rhine, in Italy, and Brabant, and had\r\nso distinguished himself in the first Silesian war, that the great King\r\nallowed him to retire from the service on account of bodily illness, very\r\nhonorably, with a pension of three thousand thalers. How the ownership\r\nof this old hero, who had honestly served three Kings of Prussia, passed\r\nto the well-known Countess Barbara Campanini, the married Presidentess\r\nvon Cocceji, we can not tell; but according to the register she sold the\r\nhouse on the 10th April, 1756, to the Actual Privy State and Directing\r\nWar Minister and Grand Master of the Robes, Herr Count von Eickstedt.\r\nAfter the death of this nobleman it became the property of his widow,\r\nthe Countess von Eickstedt-Peterswaldt, Caroline-Friedrike, born von\r\nGrumbkow; then that of her daughter, the widowed Obermarshallin von\r\nWangenheim, Philippine Juliane, born Countess von Eickstedt-Peterswaldt.\r\nThis lady was, however, Bismarck’s grand-aunt, having been married\r\nfirst to the Royal Captain Ernst Friedrich von Bismarck, at Schönhausen\r\n(born 1729, died 1775), a grand-uncle of the Minister-President—so that\r\nin the last century a Bismarck lived both at Schönhausen and in the\r\nWilhelms-Strasse. In the year 1804 the Hanoverian Councillor of Finance,\r\nJohann Crelinger, bought the house, but soon sold it to the wife of the\r\nRussian Imperial Minister and Ambassador at the Royal Prussian Court,\r\nHerr Maximilian von Alopeus, Luise Charlotte Auguste Friedrike, born a\r\nVon Veltheim. From her it passed into the possession, in 1815, of her\r\nhusband, Baron Alopeus, who sold it in 1819 to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe family of Alopeus, originally derived from a learned family of\r\nFinland, have long played a great part in Berlin society. Baron\r\nMaximilian was thrice Russian Ambassador for several years in 1790,\r\n1802, and 1813 at Berlin, and was succeeded in the post by his younger\r\nbrother, who has been raised to the rank of Count—Daniel Alopeus, who\r\ndied here in 1831. Public attention has been very recently drawn to this\r\nyounger Alopeus by a book which has passed through dozens of editions in\r\nFrance, and has been translated into almost all languages. The principal\r\npersonage of this specifically Roman Catholic book is Alexandrina,\r\nCountess Albert de Laferronays, the only daughter of Daniel Alopeus and\r\nthe lovely Johanna von Wenckstern, who married for the second time the\r\nPrince Paul Lapuchin, of Korsie in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Fiscal Board bought the house originally for the then Minister\r\nof State, Count von Bernstorff, together with all its furniture and\r\nfittings. Since that time all the Foreign Ministers of Prussia have\r\nresided there, with the exception of Ancillon, who remained in a private\r\nhouse, Unter den Linden.\r\n\r\nIt has been long known that the apartments are not sufficient for the\r\nrequirements of the service. The Ministerial bureaux, grown too unwieldy\r\nfor the ground-floor, had to be transferred to another building, scarcely\r\nsaving much trouble in the transaction of business. The apartments form\r\na very fitting dwelling-place for a nobleman in private life, but are by\r\nno means suitable for the Prussian Prime Minister and Chancellor of the\r\nNorth German Federation. Bismarck has naturally felt this inconvenience\r\nmore than any one else; but, as far as we know, he has taken no steps\r\ntowards any alteration, but usually contents himself with a good-humored\r\njoke about it.\r\n\r\nTo the left, on the first floor, are two spacious saloons, having a view\r\nof the court and garden. These are very convenient, and are decorated\r\nwith old family portraits, some of which we have mentioned in our\r\nprevious chapter on Schönhausen. It is not usual to decorate official\r\nresidences with ancestral portraits; but, as every thing of the kind\r\nwas wanting, Bismarck had his portraits brought from Schönhausen. In\r\nthe second saloon stands the Countess’s piano, and here there is an\r\nexcellent likeness of Bismarck’s sister, Frau von Arnim, as a child.\r\nNext to this is the sitting-room of the Countess, with a good picture\r\nof Bismarck in the Frankfurt period. From the first saloon one passes\r\nto the right into a large reception-room, where the ministerial council\r\nis also held. This is very simply decorated by a portrait of the King,\r\nand a gigantic porcelain vase, presented by the King to Bismarck. To the\r\nright of this saloon is Bismarck’s dining-room, with its old carpet, of\r\nwhich so much has been said in Berlin, although we really can not say\r\nwhy. Next to this is a ball-room, over the hall, where the very large\r\ndinners also are served. To the left, next to the ministerial saloon,\r\nis the comfortable but simple study of Bismarck. A double writing-table\r\nwith a low-backed chair on either side, is the principal object. In the\r\ncorner, by the stove, is a _chaise-longue_, with a lion’s skin over it.\r\nThis lion’s skin was brought to the Minister-President by the celebrated\r\ntraveller Rohlfs, from Africa. We are indebted to him also for the\r\nfollowing anecdote:—Rohlfs was on board an Egyptian ship, and was obliged\r\nto tell the officers a great deal about “Sultan Uilem” and his Grand\r\nVizier “Bi-Smarck,” which seemed like a new edition of Haroun-ar-Reschid\r\nand the Vizier Djaffar to the Orientals. The name Bismarck pleased them\r\nwonderfully, as Bi-Smarck in Arabic signifies “Swift Fire,” “Rapid\r\nAction.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Wochenblatt der Johanniter Ordens-Balley-Brandenburg,” another\r\ntraveller thus relates his ride from Cairo to the Pyramids—we there\r\nread: “Every one who has been in the East or has read a book of travels\r\nknows the events of the next hour. The visitor to the Pyramids is seized\r\nlike an irresponsible being by four brown shapes, each clad in a single\r\ngarment; two of them drag him up the irregular steps of the Pyramid of\r\nCheops, while the two others assist by shoving and pushing. It is of no\r\nuse to beg and pray—always forward, forward! The eye roves giddily on the\r\ndepths, and anxiously glances up the uneven steps, the worn and slippery\r\nblocks of stone—upward, upward, until one falls exhausted on the little\r\nplatform, and without any power of assembling moral courage. The guides\r\nthen dance round with the customary cry of ‘Bakschisch! bakschisch!’\r\n(Money! money!) Dark traditions concerning an Englishman who declined to\r\npay, and was precipitated into the depths, do not make the situation\r\nany the pleasanter; and had I not understood the Arab people, having\r\nleft my companions far behind, I should have felt very uncomfortable.\r\nBut I alleged weariness, and would bind myself to nothing. But when all\r\nappeals in German, Arabic, English, and Italian had failed (for these\r\nfellows smatter all languages), the tallest fellow, who had guessed my\r\nnationality, placed himself before me, and, holding up his forefinger,\r\npathetically exclaimed, “_Signor! Bismarck grand homme! Bakschisch!_” At\r\nthis appeal to my patriotic feelings, laughter got the upper hand, and I\r\ndivided my copper money among these gentlemen, just as the heads of my\r\ncompanions became visible at the edge of the topmost stone ridge.”\r\n\r\nIn this study hang pictures of the Great Elector and the Great King, with\r\nsome other portraits of King William. Otherwise the room is quite without\r\ndecoration. A side door leads into the boudoir of the Countess, another\r\ninto Bismarck’s bedroom, and the dressing-room beyond.\r\n\r\nBeside the door leading from the study to the bedroom, is a cuckoo clock,\r\nwhich every quarter of an hour reminds those whom Bismarck receives here,\r\nin an appealing and unmistakable manner, that they are not to forget they\r\nare in the presence of a man whose precious time belongs to his King and\r\ncountry. With some this warning is unnecessary, but in other cases it is\r\nvery useful, and should any one neglect its appeals, the possessor of\r\nthe cuckoo clock is quite the man to support them in the politest manner\r\nin the world. Softly and cautiously various stories are whispered of the\r\nimportant influence this cuckoo clock has exercised on the fates of many.\r\n\r\nSuch are the apartments inhabited by Prussia’s Premier; his children live\r\nin a wing of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen at Berlin, Bismarck is accustomed to breakfast, entirely dressed in\r\na blue uniform overcoat, about ten o’clock. At this time he opens all the\r\nletters which have come in, runs through the telegraphic dispatches and\r\nthe latest news of the morning papers, and then receives his councillors\r\nin the study, rides for an hour, and then proceeds to the royal presence.\r\nAt his return from the palace, about five, the family dines; but it is\r\na rare circumstance not to find friends present. Bismarck has always an\r\nexcellent appetite, and prefers the red wine of Bordeaux, which he once\r\non the tribune of the Second Chamber called “the natural drink of the\r\nNorth German,” to Rhenish wine. The greatest punctuality prevails at his\r\ntable. He especially delighted in exhorting his sons, while they were\r\nyoung, to sit upright; and a person who for a long time had the honor of\r\nbeing Bismarck’s table companion, asserts in full seriousness, that owing\r\nto the continual directions Bismarck gave his sons on this point, which\r\nhe also profited by himself, he had, according to his own calculation,\r\nhimself grown two inches taller in the time. Conversation is sparkling,\r\nopen, and almost always illustrated by the humorous manner of the host\r\nand the witty animation of the Countess. The language employed is always\r\nGerman, very seldom a little French or English. Bismarck’s family table\r\nhas an especial charm at Christmas time, when a great tree stretches its\r\nbranches over the guests. After dinner the Minister-President stays for\r\na short time in his wife’s salon, where he drinks a cup of coffee and\r\nsmokes, during which time he runs through the _Kreuzzeitung_ and the\r\n_Norddeutsche Allgemeine_. He then retires to his study and receives the\r\nAmbassadors, or a Council of Ministers is held, and after that he works\r\nby himself. About midnight he returns into the salon to his wife, and\r\nis pleased if he finds any company there. This rarely fails, especially\r\nwhen the Diet or Reichstag is assembled. It may be very well understood\r\nthat this arrangement is often altered, according to circumstances: the\r\nCouncil of Ministers often sits in the morning, and then the Count can\r\nscarcely find time, after his audience of the King, to get his accustomed\r\nride in the Thiergarten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the warmer seasons of the year he often goes into the garden after\r\ndinner, where the trees are; he was very commonly here every day with\r\nRoon and Moltke, before the war of 1866. The trees could tell some\r\nstrange mysteries, but of course they are “sworn,” as is proper with\r\nministerial trees. Sometimes Bismarck mounts the ice-house; there he\r\ngets a “view”—it certainly is not very extensive, but still green and\r\npleasant—over the large neighboring gardens. The Minister-President\r\nattends divine service with his family in the Holy Trinity Church, in\r\nwhich he was once confirmed. The Communion he receives at the hands of\r\nthe Consistorial Councillor Souchon, who has also confirmed his children.\r\nIf Bismarck, from personal illness, is unable to attend public worship,\r\nhe likes to have a private service read for him and his by some young\r\ndivine. But it is a rule to receive no one in the morning—for it is\r\nSunday in Bismarck’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nVARZIN.\r\n\r\n    Purchase of Varzin.—The Verandah.—The Park.—The name of\r\n    Bismarck famous.—House Inscriptions.—Popularity of Bismarck.—In\r\n    an Ambush of School-girls.—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the April of 1867 Count Bismarck went to see the Estates of Varzin\r\n(consisting of Varzin, Wussow, Puddiger, Misdow, and Chomitz), near\r\nSchlawe, in Farther Pomerania, and soon afterwards purchased them. In\r\nthe autumn of that year, as we have said, he spent some weeks at Varzin,\r\nbut in the following year he remained there, unfortunately in great\r\nillness, from June to December. He soon made himself at home there, and\r\nis fond of Varzin, as may be readily understood from its being close to\r\nthe birthplace of his wife—beloved Reinfeld. Nothing is wanting there to\r\nhis enjoyment—there are trees, and plenty of good riding and hunting.\r\nHe converses with every one who meets him, in forest and field, in a\r\nfriendly manner, and is fond of talking “platt” with the country people.\r\nRecently he said to an old laborer known to him, who had been ill: “_Nu\r\nseid Ihr wohl wieder ganz auf dem Tüge?_” (You’re all right on the main\r\nagain?) “_I ja_,” replied the old man, “_Sie sollten man ok hie blieven,\r\ndenn würden Sie noch mal so frisch!_”. (Ay! oh, you’d a vast deal better\r\nztop ’ere; yow’d be eer zo mooch vresher!) Bismarck laughed. “Yes—if one\r\ncould be as you are, and always stop in Varzin, I believe you!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARK AT VARZIN.]\r\n\r\nIf one turn south on the Cöslin-Danzig road, by the large village of\r\nCarwitz—recently marked as a station on the railway from Cöslin to\r\nDanzig—after a short drive on a good road, some three German miles, one\r\nreaches the Bismarck estates with great ease. It is a very pleasant\r\nneighborhood, alternating with wooded hillocks, meadows and waters, wood\r\nand plough-land. There is nothing very magnificent about it, nothing very\r\npretentious; but it is a pleasant spot, and the Countess Bismarck once\r\nmerrily called it, very appropriately, “a pretty little humpy countrykin.”\r\n\r\nVarzin can not be seen from the distance; it is hidden by woods.\r\nThe descending road divides the mansion, to the right, from the\r\nfarm-buildings on the left, forming a long parallelogram.\r\n\r\nVarzin does not look nearly so aristocratic as Schönhausen, which\r\nBismarck calls his “old stone-heap.” A building of one story, with two\r\nwings, all painted pale yellow, surrounds a somewhat roomy courtyard,\r\nopen to the road. On the principal building, on the gable, are the arms\r\nof Blumenthal. The steps of the stairway are occupied by orange-trees,\r\nmyrtles, and laurels. We saw a young donkey running about, who was eating\r\nthe fallen laurel-leaves with a very good appetite. The possessor of\r\nVarzin must feel very much flattered that laurels abound so much in his\r\nhouse that there are enough to feed donkeys!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn this open staircase, or rather verandah, Bismarck receives his guests,\r\nlike a simple country nobleman, in a green coat, white waistcoat, and\r\nyellow neckcloth, and with a hearty shake of the hand makes them free of\r\nthe hospitality of his house. On this verandah the Countess stands with\r\nher daughter, and looks with beaming eyes and happy face after the three\r\nsportsmen who are proceeding towards the forest and wave their hands\r\nin greeting back to her. And for others—for every one—it is a pleasant\r\nsight to see Count Bismarck walking between his sons, his rifle over\r\nhis shoulder, or riding on horseback. On this verandah also the last\r\nfarewell takes place between mother and sons. After the longest possible\r\nholiday, they return to school at Berlin, while Bismarck himself orders\r\nthe postillion to make haste, that he may not lose the mid-day train at\r\nCöslin. The honest Pomeranian, with the well-fed face above his orange\r\ncollar, has no idea that there exists an intimate bond between himself\r\nand the great Minister—that in his capacity, as Chancellor of the North\r\nGerman Confederation, he is his highest representative.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the mansion of Varzin is habitable and comfortable, but\r\nthere is nothing otherwise remarkable about it. To the right of the\r\nhall on which you enter, is the dining-room, which is connected with\r\nthe kitchen and servants’ rooms in the left wing; to the left is the\r\nCount’s room, the large centre-table of which is covered with maps. Maps,\r\nespecially those of a minute kind, are an old hobby of Bismarck’s; if\r\na trip is projected, or guests are departing, the road is accurately\r\nmeasured off beforehand on the map. This zealous study of maps has always\r\nseemed to us very characteristic of Bismarck’s whole nature; he always\r\ndesires to know the road he is travelling in the most accurate manner;\r\nhe considers the advantages, and weighs them against the annoyance. The\r\nwindows of this apartment look out on the courtyard. To the right again\r\nis the Countess’s room, the windows opening on the park, and thence there\r\nis a really magnificent view: in the bright summer moonlight nights, one\r\nwould think that one had, by enchantment, some fragment of early French\r\ncourt life, from Meudon or Rambouillet. On the other side of a prattling\r\nlittle brook, crossed by a pretty little bridge, the park, with its fine\r\nold trees—oaks and beeches—rises in terraces up the hill-side, and the\r\nwhite statues contrast well with the green foliage. At such a sight, one\r\nthinks of the “Enchanted Night” of Tieck; and indeed there is somewhat of\r\nthe “wondrous world of faërie” in the whole aspect of the scene—in its\r\nantique but eternally youthful splendor.\r\n\r\nOur readers know, from the letters we have given, how passionately\r\nBismarck loves such scenery. There is a great deal more of the romantic\r\npoet and sentimental German in the great statesman, than would appear at\r\nfirst sight. He sometimes recognizes this himself with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe park of Varzin by moonlight has indeed a peculiar old-fashioned\r\nappearance; very little imagination is necessary to people it with\r\ngentlemen in court uniforms and swords, hats under their arms, and ladies\r\nwith towering head-dresses, hoops, and high shoes. On these terraces,\r\nover the pretty flower-banks, and round the white statues, there breathes\r\nthe whole inspiration of a life which, for a long time, was unjustly\r\ncontemned, and afterwards was properly derided, when fashion became its\r\ndistinguishing trait, after the _petit maître_ style—a life we can not\r\nwish back again, but which we can not but love, it having been that of\r\nour grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and containing in it, with many\r\ntraits of insignificance, some great and admirable features. We may laugh\r\nat it, but it contains some pretty ideas!\r\n\r\nTo return to our description. Next to the Countess’s drawing-room are the\r\nbedrooms, and to the right of these again is a hall, where an enormous\r\nblack-oak staircase, reminding one of the other staircase at Schönhausen,\r\nleads to the upper story. In this hall, and in the antechamber, one sees\r\nthe horns of two immense moufflons, two tremendous stag-antlers, and\r\nsome others of different ages. These all belong to Bismarck’s hunting\r\nexpedition in the park at Schönbrunn, when he hunted there after the\r\nDanish war, with his royal master, as the guest of the Emperor of\r\nAustria. The Emperor Francis Joseph at that time very graciously sent\r\nthese trophies to Bismarck at Berlin.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of this hall, by way of a small room, one passes\r\nbehind the dining-room into a large garden saloon and conservatory,\r\nwith a pretty pavilion. In one of the guest-chambers of the right wing,\r\non the ground-floor, there is a picture ghastly to look upon, of the\r\nmaster of the house, in life-size, which, as Friedrich Gerstäcker, the\r\nunwearied traveller, informs us, is sold in great numbers in Venezuela.\r\nA worthy transatlantic Correggio, the name not yet known to fame, has\r\ndepicted the Count in a sky-blue miller’s coat and bright green trowsers,\r\nred neckerchief, and rosy red gloves, such as the dandies of Caraccas\r\nprobably wear, after a photograph. There is not a trace of likeness in\r\nthe face, and yet there is something so characteristic in the attitude,\r\nthat one immediately knows who one has before one—something so like that\r\nthe very dogs bark at it. Bismarck, it is well known, is an especial\r\nfavorite among the Germans in America. Several new cities have been named\r\nafter him; there is a Bismarck on the Conchos in Texas, and a Bismarck\r\nin Missouri; the locality of a third we do not recollect. A considerable\r\ntrans-oceanic trade is carried on in terribly bad photographs of the\r\nMinister-President, and a German cutler has made himself a little\r\nfortune by his Bismarck knives; these knives are distinguished by a very\r\nsharp and strong blade. Nor has the old world remained behind the new\r\nin its admiration. German vessels bear Bismarck’s name and likeness,\r\nunder the black and white and red flag, to the farthest shores. Acute\r\nchampagne-makers compete with Veuve Clicquot and the Duc de Montebello\r\nunder the designation of Bismarck-Schönhausen, and from Cannes, in\r\nSouthern France, to Rügenwaldermünde, in Farther Pomerania, speculative\r\nhotel-keepers announce that “Rooms have just been engaged here for\r\nCount Bismarck.” After the English style, the name of Bismarck has been\r\nbestowed as a baptismal name; we ourselves know a little Fräulein von X.,\r\nnamed Wilhelmine Bismarck Sadowa, born the 3d of July, 1866. In Spain the\r\nlucifer-match boxes significantly bear the portraits of Bismarck and his\r\nroyal master.\r\n\r\nWe have been especially pleased at finding Bismarck’s name in the true\r\nGerman household phrases. Thus, a dear and lately deceased friend, the\r\nPrivy Councillor Dr. von Arnim, wrote over his door:—\r\n\r\n    Lang lebe und blühe König Wilhelm, mein Held;\r\n    Mit ihm soll behalten Graf Bismarck das Feld!\r\n\r\n    Long live and flourish King William, my hero; with him shall\r\n    Count Bismarck keep the field.\r\n\r\nSeveral house proprietors in Berlin have adopted this sentence; but still\r\nmore apposite is the following inscription on the house of a master\r\nweaver:—\r\n\r\n    Als Wilhelm wirkt und Bismarck spann,\r\n    Gott hatte seine Freude dran. 1866.\r\n\r\n    As William worked and Bismarck spon,\r\n    God had his joy thereon. 1866.\r\n\r\nGardeners have started a Bismarck rose, and a giant Bismarck strawberry,\r\nand the fashionable world attires itself in Bismarck brown. At our\r\nrequest, the management of the Bazar, the most competent house for such\r\nthings, has kindly shown us fourteen shades of this color in silk,\r\nand informed us at the same time that there are many more of such\r\nBismarck shades; that Bismarck _foncé_ is not nearly so dark as Bismarck\r\n_courroucé_. This color originally was called _hanneton_ (May beetle),\r\nand soon drove the _Vert Metternich_ from the field; while in Austria\r\na small cake (_semmel_), strewn with a little poppy-seed, shaped like\r\na pigtail, holds its sway with the Radetzky Köpfel. On the Paraná\r\nand Paraguay the steamer Count Bismarck runs up and down the river.\r\nAt Alexandria the passage Bismarck is full of brown and black forms.\r\nAt Blumberg, in the South Australian colony of Adelaide, the Germans\r\nassemble in the Bismarck Hall, and to keep up their national enthusiasm\r\nover a drink, they smoke cigars “Conde de Bismarck.” These are considered\r\nhighly elegant, but cost one hundred and thirty dollars a pound, although\r\nthere is a cheaper medium Bismarck cigar.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Duchy of Posen, by a Cabinet Order of the King, the\r\nfour places Karsy, Bobry, Budy, and Zwierzchoslaw, in the circle of\r\nPleschen, have been, at the desire of the inhabitants, incorporated as\r\nBismarcksdorf.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin the Bismarck-Strasse unites the Roon-Strasse with the\r\nMoltke-Strasse; while in 1865 the malice of the Berlin wits wanted to\r\nchange the name of the Wasserthor-Strasse, when the terrible fall of the\r\nhouses took place there, into Bismarck-Strasse.\r\n\r\nIn South Germany the belief that Bismarck does every thing and can do\r\nevery thing, down to the Spanish Revolution, and perhaps even directs\r\nthe weather, is continually spreading. Oddly enough, the Ultramontane\r\nenemies of Bismarck especially take care to spread the name of the\r\nMinister-President. They certainly paint black over black, but they make\r\nthe nation familiar with his fame, and though they may ever depict him as\r\na sort of devil, truth will break through at last.\r\n\r\nIs Bismarck really popular? This may be a curious question to ask, but\r\nit may still be legitimately put, for in the ordinary sense of the word\r\nBismarck is not popular, despite his worldwide fame. For instance, he is\r\nnot popular as in our days Cavour and Garibaldi have been. He has not the\r\npopularity of the ruling party opinion and that of the day, but, in place\r\nof it, his is the historical popularity which will preserve his memory\r\nto a grateful posterity. A correspondent of the liberal Paris paper,\r\n_Le Temps_, very excellently expresses our meaning in the following\r\nremarks:—“The Chancellor of the North German Confederation is not what\r\nwe can call a popular man; the Prussians, or at least the Berlinese,\r\nentertain for him a similar feeling to that entertained by the other\r\nGermans for Prussia. They do not love him; they love to exercise their\r\nwit upon him, and you know how biting and salted the Berlin wit is; but\r\nthey acknowledge him and wonder at him, showing him tolerance. They look\r\nupon him as the greatest statesman of the present day; are proud of him,\r\nalthough he often presses hard upon them. M. de Bismarck has for the\r\nPrussians an incomparable magic, particularly since he opposed the policy\r\nof Napoleon. Since 1866, a change has taken place which has surprised me,\r\nalthough there is nothing very surprising in it. Before 1866, the Premier\r\nin every thing he did had the world pretty much against him—to-day every\r\nimpulse is expected from him, and if he gives it, almost every one is at\r\nhis back.”\r\n\r\nThe question of popularity, as far as the great world is concerned,\r\nmay well be left here; but in Varzin and the neighboring districts it\r\nhas long since been determined. Only ask his farmers and laborers! And\r\nwith the daring blacksmith—(or was it a miller?)—who secretly poaches\r\non Bismarck’s preserves, the Minister-President is, perhaps, the most\r\npopular of any.\r\n\r\nIt is a real pleasure to see Bismarck at Varzin among his trees; not\r\nduring those restless nocturnal wanderings in the park, to which his\r\nsleepless illness only too frequently impels him, but when he is\r\npleasantly pointing out his favorites to his guests. It was an event when\r\nthe North German Chancellor, the summer before last, discovered three\r\nmagnificent beeches in the midst of a thicket.\r\n\r\nOn a declivity with a beautiful view, there is a rich deer preserve.\r\nBismarck might even erect a falconry, and hunt with hawks—there are\r\nplenty in the Netherlands still. But this Imperial and Royal amusement is\r\nfor him too—reactionary.\r\n\r\nOne day Bismarck thought, as he was riding to the Crangener frontier,\r\nwhither he had sent his gamekeeper, that he caught a glimpse of a\r\npeculiar blue animal which fled before him. But when he came up with\r\nit, it proved to be a blue parasol, and he himself had fallen into an\r\nambuscade, for he found himself suddenly surrounded by a crowd of young\r\nladies, who received him with songs. The pastor in Crangen kept a young\r\nladies’ school, who, having heard that Bismarck was coming, thus paid\r\ntheir respects to him in so unexpected a way, and left him, delighted\r\nwith his amiability. Crangen, an ancient hunting castle of the Dukes of\r\nPomerania, standing picturesquely, with its four stately towers and high\r\ngables, between three lakes and high mountains, is, without doubt, the\r\nmost beautiful spot in this neighborhood. It belongs to the Royal Major\r\nRetired Rank Freiherr Hugo von Loën, who is Bismarck’s nearest neighbor\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nThe long residence of Bismarck at Varzin during the summer before last\r\nhas directed the eyes of all Europe on this modest seat in Farther\r\nPomerania. Varzin was an old fief of the family of Von Zitzewitz, who\r\npossessed many estates in this neighborhood. It is said that it came\r\n_per fas et nefas_ into the possession of the very powerful Privy\r\nMinister of State and War and Principal President of Pomerania, Caspar\r\nOtto von Massow, who then sold it to Major General Adam Joachim, Count\r\nof Podewils. Count Podewils and his brothers received a renewal of the\r\nfief, and it was a heritage in their family, until in this century it\r\npassed through an heiress to a Von Blumenthal, Werner Constantine von\r\nBlumenthal, who was raised to a Countship in 1840. Bismarck purchased\r\nthe Varzin estates from the younger sons of this Blumenthal. They form,\r\nwith Varzin, Wussow—where the church is situated, Puddiger, Misdow,\r\nChomitz, and Charlottenthal, a considerable property. The soil is not\r\nequal throughout; the forests are very fine and stately; the wood in good\r\ncondition. The game is very plentiful—few stags, but plenty of roes,\r\nhares, and smaller game. The Wipper, which falls into the Baltic at\r\nRügenwaldermünde, five German miles from Varzin, serpentines through the\r\nforests of the Bismarck property, and in part forms the boundary of the\r\nestate, and is very useful for the transportation of the timber.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were considerable glass factories in Misdow and Chomitz,\r\nbut they are no longer worked, nor is any spirit distilled there; but a\r\nwood factory it is said is in use—certainly a profitable business in this\r\nneighborhood, so full of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Edinburgh Review_, vol. cxxx., pp. 457, 458.\r\n\r\n[2] _Alvensleben._ This family was of noble origin in the Alt Mark, and\r\nhas been partly elevated to the rank of Count. Its annals extend to 1163.\r\nThe original seat of the family was Alvensleben on the Bever; the lines\r\nconsisted of three—red, black, and white. Of these the red line died out\r\nin 1534 and 1553, at Erxleben and Kalvörden. The white line, divided into\r\nthree, through Joachim Valentine, at Isernschnippe, Eimersleben, and\r\nErxleben—the first expired in 1680, the second in 1734—the third, founded\r\nby Gebhard Christoph, still flourishes. The black line was always the\r\nmost extensive. It divided into two branches, that of Ludolf and that\r\nof Joachim. Only a portion of this family exists at the present day. Of\r\nthe branch of Ludolf, there existed Philip Karl (born 1745, 16th Dec.),\r\nwho became a Prussian diplomatist and was a favorite of Friedrich II.\r\nand Minister of Foreign Affairs. He died a Count, 21st Oct., 1802, at\r\nBerlin, unmarried. Johann Aug. Ernst was born at Erxleben, 6th Aug.,\r\n1758; he was Minister for Brandenburg and Privy Councillor of Prussia;\r\ndied 27th Sept., 1827, a Prussian Count. The black line died out with his\r\nson, the Prussian Minister Albrecht v. A. The white, or Gardelegen line,\r\nwas elevated to the rank of Count in the persons of Fried. Wilh. Aug.\r\n(born 31st May, 1798; died 2d Dec., 1853), and Ferd. Friedr. Ludolf (born\r\n23d Jan., 1803), at the ascension of Fried. Wilh. IV., 15th Oct., 1840.\r\nAlbrecht, the representative of the black line, was distinguished for his\r\ndevotion to his king, much as Bismarck has been. He died 2d May, 1858;\r\nhis large property went to his sister and her children.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[3] This rank in Germany, and especially in North Germany, is held\r\nto be noble. We have no corresponding title in English; it is higher\r\nthan esquire, but not exactly that of a knight or baronet. Perhaps it\r\ncorresponds to “honorable.”—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[4] In the original, _Schlossgesessen_, literally “seized of or seated at\r\na castle.”—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[5] _Knesebeck._ Of this family one was celebrated as Prussian\r\nField-Marshal (born 5th May, 1768, at Carwe, near New Ruppin, of an\r\nancient Brandenburg family). He fought with distinction in 1792-’94, and\r\nwas placed on the staff by the Duke of Brunswick. He fulfilled a singular\r\ndiplomatic mission to Petersburg in 1811-’12, which had for its real\r\nmotives an incitement to the Russian emperor to withstand Napoleon to the\r\nutmost, and to decoy him into the interior of Russia. The world knows the\r\nrest. He was an enthusiast in poetry, as well as war. Many poems of his\r\nhave been privately printed—the chief of these is one in praise of war\r\n(_Lob des Kriegs_). Think of a Tyrtæus in a Prussian general’s uniform!\r\nHe died 12th Jan., 1848.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[6] The Archbishopric of Magdeburg took its rise from a Benedictine\r\nconvent in honor of St. Maurice, founded by Emperor Otto I. in 937; and\r\nin 967 it was made an archbishopric, and the primacy of Germany was given\r\nby Pope John XIII., with Havelberg, among others, as a dependency.—K. R.\r\nH. M.\r\n\r\n[7] _Holzendorff._ This family still exists, and has numbered among its\r\nprominent members, gallant soldiers and eminent jurists. Karl Friedr. von\r\nH. was a distinguished general of artillery, born the 17th Aug., 1764,\r\nand the son of a famous artillery general, under Friedrich II. (died 10th\r\nDec., 1785). After a brilliant career, during which he commanded the\r\nartillery of the army of Blücher (1815), when he was wounded at Ligny,\r\nhe died at Berlin, 29th Sept., 1828. There is still living a member\r\nof this family, Franz von Holzendorff—an eminent writer on criminal\r\njurisprudence—born at Vietmannsdorf in the Uckermarck, 14th Oct., 1829.\r\nHe is editor of a newspaper connected with the subject he has treated of\r\nin so many works.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[8] _Quitzow._ A very ancient and important family, still existing at\r\nthe village of the same name, near Peoleberg, in the Priegnitz. During\r\nthe Bavarian and Luxemburg regency, this family attained formidable\r\nproportions. Hans von Quitzow was nominated administrator by Jobst von\r\nMähren in 1400, but shortly dismissed, for undue severity and ambition.\r\nFriedrich I. of Hohenzollern, first governor under Emperor Sigismund, and\r\nthen elector as feoffee of the Marks, had as his opponents the brothers\r\nHans and Dietrich von Quitzow, sons of Sir Kuno—born at Quitzhöfel, near\r\nHavelberg. They were repressed, but still the authority of the governor\r\ncould not be established until after their death in 1414. One Dietrich\r\nvon Quitzow was a field-marshal in the Brandenburg service, in 1606.—K.\r\nR. H. M.\r\n\r\n[9] Briest was also included in the permutation.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[10] _Asseburg._ This family is noble and well-endowed in Prussia Proper\r\nand Anhalt. The name is derived from Asseburg in Brunswick, a noble\r\nstructure of considerable antiquity. It was finally sacked in 1492, and\r\ndestroyed altogether in the Brunswick troubles. The present family hold\r\nthe lesser countyship of Falkenstein in the Mansfeld district and the\r\nknight’s fee of Eggenstadt.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[11] _Katte._ This remarkable family needs scarcely any thing at my\r\nhands. It is ancient and aristocratic, and has continued to exist\r\ndespite all kinds of mutations till now. There was in the line of Wust,\r\nJohn Henry von Katte, whose unfortunate son was beheaded for undue zeal\r\ntowards Frederick the Great: of him some account is presented—the date\r\nof his murder being 6th November, 1730. Other members of the family have\r\ndistinguished themselves to recent days.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[12] _Möllendorff._ One of the Möllendorffs was a Prussian field-marshal,\r\nRichard Joachim Henry von M. (born 1725; died 1816). He was with “_der\r\nolle Fritz_” and was even respected by his enemies. Napoleon gave him the\r\nGrand Cross of the Legion of Honor.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[13] _Bardeleben._ This family exists in the best condition, and has done\r\ngood service to the Prussian state. The most distinguished member of this\r\nfamily is Kurt von Bardeleben, jurist and judge at Minden.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[14] Gneomar Dubislaw von Natzmer was a field-marshal in the time of King\r\nFrederick William I., and frustrated the flight of the Crown Prince,\r\nafterwards Frederick II. Among his proximate descendants, through the\r\nmother, was a distinguished Prussian general, Oltwig Ant. Leop. v.\r\nNatzmer, born 18th April, 1782, at Villin, in Pomerania. He took part\r\nin the many illustrious struggles of the growing kingdom of Prussia—was\r\npresent at the battle of Auerstädt, 1806; taken prisoner at Prenzlau and\r\nexchanged in 1807. He received promotion to the staff after the peace of\r\nTilsit, accompanied the King to the conference of princes at Dresden,\r\nand was sent on a secret mission to Russia. He was also in action at the\r\nbattles of Gross-görschen (1813), Hainau (1813), Bautzen, and others\r\ndown to Leipzig. He was also in the campaign of 1815, in high command.\r\nAfter a life of devotion to his sovereign, he died 1st Nov., 1861. It may\r\nbe as well to state here that my object in these notes is to show how\r\nentirely devoted the military officials of Prussia are to the house of\r\nHohenzollern, and that these side-illustrations throw a light upon the\r\ncentral figure of this book, Count Bismarck himself, and the motives of\r\nhis steady, although apparently inconsistent, patriotism.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[15] Biron (Ernst Johann von), Duke of Courland, was born in 1687, the\r\nson of a landed proprietor named Bühren. He was the favorite of the\r\nDuchess of Courland, Anna Iwanowna, niece of Peter the Great, from his\r\nelegant manners and attainments. She ascended the Russian throne in\r\n1730, and though it had been expressly stipulated that Biron should not\r\nbe allowed to come to Russia, he soon made his appearance at the court.\r\nAssuming the arms of the French Dukes of Biron, he governed Russia,\r\nthrough Anna. His life was stormy until near its close, when he returned\r\nto his Duchy of Courland, which he governed wisely. In 1769 he abdicated\r\nin favor of his son Peter, and died 28th December, 1772. This son Peter\r\ngoverned till 28th March, 1795, then resigning Courland to the Czarina\r\nCatherine, but retaining all his sovereign rights. He then passed\r\nhis time alternately at Berlin and his estates of Sagan and Nachod,\r\ndying 12th Jan., 1800, at Gellenau in Silesia. One of the collateral\r\ndescendants of Biron, Prince Gustav Calixt von Biron, born 29th Jan.,\r\n1780, died in the Prussian service, a Lieut. General and Governor of the\r\nfortress of Glatz, 20th June, 1821. He had three sons. The second, Calixt\r\nGustav, born 3d Jan., 1817, is alive, having married, 1845, the Princess\r\nHelene Meschtscherskii, by whom he has issue Gustav Peter Jon, born 17th\r\nOct., 1859.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[16] Nassau-Usingen, Princess Augusta Amalia, was married 2d Aug., 1804,\r\nto Louis William, Landgrave of Hesse-Hombourg (died 19th Jan., 1839);\r\nseparated 1805. She was the daughter of Duke Frederick Augustus (died\r\n24th March, 1816, the last of his house) and of Louise, born Princess of\r\nWaldeck (died 17th Nov., 1816). The Almanach de Gotha does not recognize\r\nthe subsequent marriage with Count Bismarck.\r\n\r\n[17] The battle of Chotusitz was fought the 17th May, 1742, by Frederick\r\nII., when he obtained a victory over the Austrians under Prince Karl\r\nof Lorraine. The place has some 1200 inhabitants, and is situated near\r\nCzaslau in Bohemia. This decided the cession of almost the whole of\r\nSilesia.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[18] This rhapsody will convey a good idea of what was thought fine\r\nwriting in those days, but it is fulsome to the last degree.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[19] From Platt, or low German.—K. R.

H. M.\r\n\r\n[22] For the most eloquent account of this sad affair, the reader is\r\nrequested to refer to Mr. Carlyle’s “Frederick the Great,” Book vii.\r\nchap. ix.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[23] _Katte._ This illustrious family has been historically famous\r\nfor its liege adherence to the Prussian-Brandenburg house. John Henry\r\nvon Katte (born 16th Oct., 1681; died 31st May, 1741), of Wust, was a\r\nField-Marshal General and Count. His son was the unfortunate friend of\r\nFrederick the Crown Prince, beheaded at Küstrin, 6th Nov., 1740. Several\r\nothers of this family have distinguished themselves, despite the cruelty\r\nof the kings, in the Prussian service.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[24] About £13,300 sterling.\r\n\r\n[25] Herzberg, Ewald Fred. (Count von), a distinguished Prussian\r\ndiplomatist, born at Lotten, near New Stettin, in 1725. He published many\r\nmost valuable diplomatic, historical, and juridical works, and died on\r\nthe 27th May, 1795, after having been somewhat harshly treated by those\r\nin power.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[26] Bischofswerder (John Rud. von), General and Minister of Frederick\r\nWilliam II., born at Dresden, 1737, of an old Saxon family. He entered\r\nthe Prussian service, 1760, and was a Major in 1779. The confidence\r\nthe King, first as Crown Prince, had in him, was unlimited; and he was\r\nemployed in important diplomatic matters at Szistowe and at Pilnitz. He\r\nwas ambassador to Paris in 1793. He died in October, 1803.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[27] Now (1869) American Ambassador to St. James’s.\r\n\r\n[28] It is again necessary to explain that the translation is as close as\r\nthe translator can make, without violating sense and metre. The reader\r\nwill find the original of this, and other interjected poems in the\r\nAppendices.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[29] In English miles about eighteen and thirty.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[30] This requires explanation, the pun not being susceptible of\r\ntranslation. The derivation of Kniephof is uncertain; _Knie_ is, however,\r\n_Knee_, and it might have come from its being granted for knee-service.\r\n_Kneipe_ is a _pot-house_: _Hof_, a court.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[31] The passage is written by Bismarck in English. I have put inverted\r\ncommas.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[32] It is obvious that this pride arose from the smallness of the river,\r\nnot the loss of the man and horse.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[33] So in Bismarck’s letter.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[34] Lucchesini, Girolamo, Marchese, was born at Lucca in 1752 of a\r\npatrician family, and presented by the Abbé Fontana to King Frederick\r\nII., by whom he was appointed librarian and reader with the title of\r\nChamberlain. He was sent to Rome in 1787 to obtain certain ratifications\r\nfrom the Pope, and thence to Warsaw, where he succeeded in 1790 in\r\nbringing Poland and Prussia into a treaty of amity. He attended the\r\ncongress of Reichenbach as Minister Plenipotentiary in 1791. In 1792 he\r\nwent to Warsaw and destroyed the very treaty he had himself negotiated\r\nbetween Prussia and Poland. Hence the above strictures on him. He was\r\nAmbassador to Vienna in 1793, but was generally with the King. In\r\nSeptember, 1802, he was sent to Paris as Ambassador Extraordinary,\r\nand followed Napoleon to Milan. He was present at the battle of Jena,\r\nand signed the truce at Charlottenburg with Napoleon. This not being\r\nsanctioned by the King, he resigned. He then became Chamberlain to\r\nNapoleon’s sister, the Duchess of Lucca, and died the 19th October,\r\n1825, at Florence. He was the author of some political works on the\r\nRhenish Confederation and the like. He seems to have been a shifty and\r\nunprincipled politician. His younger brother, Cesare Lucchesini, was a\r\ndistinguished author and antiquary.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[35] This Constitution is given in the Appendix, being an important state\r\ndocument.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[36] An account of this family has been given at p. 47 in a note.\r\nThose who wish to pursue further details may consult Klöden’s history,\r\npublished in 1828.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[37] A short anecdote of the venerable Alexander von Humboldt, as\r\nillustrative of the popular spirit, deserves preservation here. During\r\nthe eventful days of March, when barricades were the order of the day, a\r\nmob came rushing into the Oranienburger-Strasse, where Humboldt resided.\r\nMaterials for a barricade were required, and every door was besieged\r\nfor the purpose. One of these opened, and a venerable-looking man\r\npresented himself and begged the excited mass not to disturb him. Such\r\na request was not to be borne by the sovereign people, and he was asked\r\nmenacingly who he was, that he should use such language. “I am Alexander\r\nvon Humboldt,” was the quiet reply. In a moment every hat was off, and\r\nwith reverent greetings the multitude swept forward and left the scholar\r\nand philosopher at peace. It is only right to record such a fact, as\r\nit may serve to show that the fierce revolutionists at least knew how\r\nto restrain themselves, even in the midst of their enthusiastic fury.\r\nI give the anecdote on the authority of the admirable German newspaper\r\n_Hermann_, of the 11th September, 1869.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[38] “Preussen’s Deutsche Politik”—“Prussia’s German Policy,” 3d edition\r\n(Leipzig, 1867, p. 236).\r\n\r\n[39] About £2 sterling per annum.—K. R. H.

I really must here join issue with a writer who assumes too\r\nmuch, and hides his own very small personality, possessing no personal\r\ncourtesy, behind weighty cloudiness and the permission to copy Bismarck’s\r\ncorrespondence.—K. R. H. M.\r\n\r\n[46] The Austro-Prussian Campaign in Denmark receives so little notice\r\non the part of Bismarck’s biographer, that I shrewdly suspect he does\r\nnot approve of it as a just act on the part of the hero of this book.\r\nOpinions are much divided on the merits of this annexation; in any case,\r\nthe limit of aggression seems to be too great, as the German party has\r\nnot dared to appeal for justification to any _plébiscite_. In the end,\r\nwhen animosities are healed, it must be confessed that substantial\r\nbenefit may accrue to the new subjects of Prussia. It is worth while in\r\nthis place to preserve a political squib, extensively posted in the towns\r\nof the Duchies during the war; probably rather an instigation of the\r\nAustrians, whom it indirectly compliments, than a spontaneous outburst of\r\nDanish satire. All the walls were covered with it one fine morning, thus:\r\n\r\n    “Es giebt nur eine Kaiserstadt,\r\n      Und die heisst Wien;\r\n    Es giebt nur ein Räubernest,\r\n      Und das ist Berlin!”\r\n\r\n    “There is but one Emperor’s town, that is called Wien;\r\n    There is but one robbers’ nest, and that is Berlin!”\r\n\r\nBut perhaps annexation was better than such a kinglet as the Prince of\r\nAugustenburg.—K.

The proportions seem thus to have been: for the Prussians,\r\n1/23; for the Austrians 1/7; average loss on both sides 1/11. In the\r\nbattle of Malplaquet (1709) proportion of losses, 1/5; at Rossbach (1757)\r\n1/25; at Leuthen (1758) 1/11; at Zorndorf (1758) 3/8; at Austerlitz\r\n(1805) 1/4; at Eylau (1807) 1/4; at Wagram (1809) 1/8; at Borodino (1812)\r\n1/3; at Leipzig (1813) 1/5; at Belle Alliance (1815) 1/3; at Solferino\r\n(1859) 1/8. The three greatest battles were those of Leipzig (460,000\r\nmen); Königsgrätz (430,000 men); and Wagram (320,000 men).

At the present day they can not fail to be read with\r\ninterest, inasmuch as they illustrate in a remarkable degree the impolicy\r\nof hasty concessions. The Prussia and Germany of 1847 was hardly prepared\r\nby political education and enlightenment for such concessions, and the\r\nimmediate effect, which the English editor of these pages personally\r\nwitnessed, was a stimulant to the ultra party to demand more and more at\r\nthe hands of the King. The text amply illustrates the excited state of\r\npublic opinion at the time, which culminated in the days of March, 1848,\r\nand has required the steady and fearless hand of Count Bismarck to rein\r\nin. Political students can make their own comments.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of a decree dated Berlin, February 3d,\r\n1847:—\r\n\r\nWe, Frederick William, by the grace of God, King of Prussia, etc., give\r\nnotice, and herewith ordain to be known:—\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of our government we have constantly applied\r\nparticular care to the development of the relations of the States of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe recognize in this matter one of the weightiest problems of the kingly\r\ncalling bestowed on us by God, in the solution of which a twofold aim\r\nis marked out for us—namely, to transmit the rights, the dignity, and\r\nthe power of the Crown, inherited from our ancestors of glorious memory,\r\nintact to our successors on the throne; but at the same time to grant, to\r\nthe faithful States of our monarchy that co-operation which, in unison\r\nwith those rights, and the peculiar relations of our monarchy, is fitted\r\nto secure a prosperous future to our country.\r\n\r\nIn respect whereof, continuing to build on the laws given by His late\r\nMajesty our Royal Father, now resting with God, particularly on the\r\nOrdinance respecting the national debt of the 17th of January, 1820, and\r\non the law respecting the regulation of the Provincial Diets of the 5th\r\nof June, 1828, we decree as follows:—\r\n\r\n1.—As often as the wants of the State may require either fresh loans, or\r\nthe introduction of new taxes, or the increase of those already existing,\r\nwe will call together around us the Provincial Diets of the monarchy in\r\nan United Diet, in order, firstly, to call into play that co-operation\r\nof the Diets provided by the Ordinance respecting the national debt; and\r\nsecondly, to assure us of their consent.\r\n\r\n2.—We will for the future call together at periodical times the Committee\r\nof the United Diet.\r\n\r\n3.—To the United Diet, and, as its representative, to the Committee of\r\nthe United Diet, we intrust—\r\n\r\n(a.) In reference to counsel of the Diet in legislation, the same\r\nco-operation which was assigned to the Provincial Diets by the law of\r\nJune 5th, 1823, Sec. 3, No. 2, so long as no general assemblies of the\r\nDiet take place.\r\n\r\n(b.) The co-operation of the Diets in paying the interest on, and\r\nliquidation of, the State debts, provided, by the law of January 17th,\r\n1820, in so far as such business is not confided to the Deputation of the\r\nDiet for the national debt.\r\n\r\n(c.) The right of petition upon internal, though not merely provincial,\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nAll the above, as is more closely defined in our Ordinances of this day\r\nrespecting the formation of an United Diet, the periodical assembling of\r\nthe committee of the United Diet and its functions, and the formation of\r\na deputation of the Diet for the national debt.\r\n\r\nWhile we thus far refer to the promises of that Gracious Sovereign\r\nour Royal Father, on the raising of new loans, as well as the increase\r\nof existing taxes, which are founded on that system of the German\r\nConstitution, bound up with the assent of the States, and in thereby\r\ngiving to our subjects a special proof of our royal confidence; so we\r\nexpect in return the like confidence from their often-proved fidelity and\r\nhonor, as was shown when we ascended the throne of our father, and also\r\nwe expect that they will support us and our efforts directed solely to\r\nthe welfare of the country, on which efforts success under God’s gracious\r\nassistance can not fail to await.\r\n\r\nOfficially authenticated by our own subscription, and sealed with our\r\nroyal seal.\r\n\r\n                                                       FREDERICK WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n    Given at Berlin, Feb. 3d, 1847.\r\n    (L.S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDINANCE OF THE THIRD OF FEBRUARY, 1847, FOR THE FORMATION OF THE UNITED\r\nDIET.\r\n\r\nWe, Frederick William, by the grace of God, King of Prussia, etc.,\r\nhaving taken the opinion of our Ministers of State, make the following\r\nOrdinance, in pursuance of our letters patent of this day, in the matter\r\nof the affairs of the Diets, respecting the formation of an United Diet:—\r\n\r\nSection 1.—We shall unite the eight Provincial Diets of our monarchy in\r\none Diet, as often as is necessary, according to the tenor of our letters\r\npatent of this day, or on any other occasion when we think it needful on\r\naccount of urgent matters of State.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the place of assembly, and the continuance of the Session\r\nof this United Diet, as well as with regard to its opening and close, we\r\nwill make a special determination in each particular case.\r\n\r\nSection 2.—We grant to the Princes of our Royal House, as soon as,\r\naccording to the prescriptions of law, they have attained majority,\r\nthe right of sitting and voting in the Estate of Princes, Counts, and\r\nLords, at the United Diet. The Estate of Nobles in this Diet is composed,\r\nbesides, of the Princes and Counts of the old Imperial Constitution, who\r\nhave seats in the Provincial Diets, as well as of the Silesian Princes\r\nand noblemen, and all other founders, Princes, Counts, and Lords of the\r\neight Provincial Diets who are entitled either to a single or collective\r\nvote in those Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe Princes of our House may, under our sanction, in case of hindrance,\r\nintrust some other Prince of our House with the disposal of their votes.\r\n\r\nSingle members of the Estate of Nobles, who are invested with full powers\r\nin the Provincial Diet, retain this privilege in like manner for the\r\nUnited Diet.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the organization and enlargement of the Estate of Nobles,\r\nwe reserve to ourselves the right of further regulations.\r\n\r\nSection 3.—The Deputies of the Estate of Knighthood, and the Commoners of\r\nthe eight Provinces of our monarchy, are to appear in the United Diet in\r\nthe same numbers as in the Provincial Diets.\r\n\r\nSection 4.—To the United Diet we intrust the co-operation reserved\r\nto the Provincial Diets in case of State loans by Article 2 of the\r\nOrdinance relative to the national debt, dated January 17th, 1820; and,\r\naccordingly, no new loans, for which the collective property of the State\r\nmay be assigned as security (Article 3 of the Ordinance of January 17th,\r\n1820), shall be contracted without the concurrence and guaranty of the\r\nUnited Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 5.—If new loans, of the nature mentioned in Section 4, are\r\nrequired for covering the expenses of the State in time of peace, we will\r\nnot contract them without the consent of the United Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 6.—If, however, in the event of expected war, or war already\r\nbroken out, the funds in our Treasury, and other reserve funds, are\r\ninsufficient for the requisite purpose, extraordinary supplies and loans\r\nmust therefore be raised; and if urgent political circumstances should\r\nnot admit of our appeal to the United Diet, the said loan shall be raised\r\nwith the concurrence of the deputation for the national debt, which\r\nconcurrence shall stand in lieu of the co-operation of the States. Loans\r\nfor the above-mentioned objects, contracted with the concurrence of the\r\ndeputation, will be raised on the same security as that which, in Article\r\n3 of the Ordinance of January 17th, 1820, is assigned for the national\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nSection 7.—Should a loan be raised in the manner mentioned in Section 6,\r\nwe will, on the removal of the obstacles which prevented an appeal to the\r\nUnited Diet, call it together, and explain the object and application of\r\nthe loan.\r\n\r\nSection 8.—Moreover, the United Diet, conformably with Article 9 of\r\nthe Ordinance of January 17th, 1820, must propose to us the candidates\r\nfor vacant posts in the chief department for the administration of the\r\nnational debt; and, conformably with Article 13 of the said Ordinance,\r\nthe accounts for the administration of the national debt, drawn up by the\r\ndeputation, must be carefully examined by the United Diet, and submitted\r\nto us for discharge in separate resolutions.\r\n\r\nWhen the United Diet is not sitting, this business must be transacted by\r\nthe Committee of the United Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 9.—Without the consent of the United Diet, we will not introduce\r\nany new imposts, nor increase the amount of the existing taxes, either\r\ngenerally or in any particular province.\r\n\r\nThis condition does not, however, extend to import, export, and transit\r\nduties, nor to those indirect taxes, the specification, levying, or\r\nadministration of which may be the subjects of an understanding with\r\nother Powers; neither does that condition refer to domains or royal\r\nproperty (whether the arrangements relate to income or to substance), or\r\nto taxes for objects relating to provinces, circles, or communes.\r\n\r\nSection 10.—In the event of a war, we reserve to ourselves the right of\r\nlevying extraordinary taxes without the assent of the United Diet, when\r\nurgent political circumstances do not permit us to call it together. In\r\nsuch cases, however, we will, as soon as circumstances permit, or at\r\nlatest on the termination of the war, make known to the United Diet the\r\nobject and application of the extraordinary taxes which may have been\r\nlevied.\r\n\r\nSection 11.—Should the Diet be called together on any of the occasions\r\nspecified in Sections 4-10, copies of the finance estimates and the\r\naccounts of the State for the intervals between the sittings of the\r\nAssembly shall be submitted to the members for their information.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of the finance estimates, as well as determining the\r\nemployment of the State revenue, and the application of the surplus to\r\nthe wants and welfare of the State, remains an exclusive privilege of the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nSection 12.—Conformably with a law of the 5th of January, 1823, we\r\nreserve to ourselves the right of demanding extraordinary counsel from\r\nthe United Diet in framing laws relating to alterations in the rights\r\nof persons and property, or on other matters than those alluded to in\r\nSection 9, which have for their object alterations in the taxes, whether\r\nthose laws concern the whole monarchy or several provinces. The Diet is\r\nauthorized to give the required counsel, with full lawful effect.\r\n\r\nShould we deem it necessary to seek counsel of the Diet concerning\r\nchanges in the constitution of the Diet—changes which, not being limited\r\nto any particular province, are not to be arranged by the Diet of that\r\nprovince—we shall demand an opinion from the United Diet, for whose\r\nconsideration changes in such matters of State are exclusively reserved.\r\n\r\nSection 13.—To the United Diet belongs the right of laying before us\r\npetitions and complaints relating to the internal affairs of the whole\r\nkingdom, or of several provinces; on the other hand, petitions and\r\ncomplaints which concern merely the interests of particular provinces\r\nmust be referred to the provincial Diets.\r\n\r\nSection 14.—When the United Diet has determined on raising new State\r\nloans (Section 5), or the introduction of new taxes, or increasing the\r\nexisting rate of taxes (Section 9), the Estate of the Nobles must take\r\npart with the other estates in the discussion and decision. In all other\r\ncases the deliberations and votes of the Estate of the Nobles in the\r\nUnited Diet are to take place in a separate assembly.\r\n\r\nSection 15.—Every member of the Estate of the Nobles is entitled to a\r\nfull vote in the United Diet, but when (as mentioned in Section 14) the\r\nEstate of the Nobles is united with the other estates in one Assembly,\r\nthe members of that Estate, taking part in the discussions of the United\r\nDiet, have only that number of votes which belongs to them in the\r\nProvincial Diets.\r\n\r\nSection 16.—Resolutions are to be carried by the majority of votes.\r\n\r\nPetitions and complaints are only to be brought under our cognizance\r\nwhen they have been deliberated on in both Assemblies (that is, in the\r\nAssembly of the Estate of Nobles, and in the Assembly of Deputies of\r\nthe Knighthood and Commoners), and when in each of these Assemblies at\r\nleast two-thirds of the votes have been in favor of such petitions or\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nWhen the two above-named Assemblies, or one of them, after the discussion\r\nof a law, or of certain articles of a law, shall decide against that law\r\nby a majority less than that above-named, the views of the minority shall\r\nbe submitted to our consideration.\r\n\r\nSection 17.—If on a subject in respect to which the interests of two\r\ndifferent estates or provinces may be at variance with each other,\r\na particular estate or province should have reason to complain of\r\na resolution according to the terms of Section 16, a separation of\r\nthe Assembly into its component parts takes place, if a majority of\r\ntwo-thirds of the said estate or province be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn such case the estate or province must discuss the matter separately,\r\nor pass a separate vote, and the various views entertained on the subject\r\nwill afterwards be submitted to our decision.\r\n\r\nAlso, in other cases, we reserve to ourselves the privilege of requiring,\r\nwhen we think fit so to do, a separate opinion from each of the estates\r\nand provinces.\r\n\r\nSection 18.—For the Estate of Nobles of the Assembled Diet, as well\r\nas for the Assembly of the Knighthood and Commoners, we will appoint\r\na Marshal to conduct the business and to act as president. The places\r\nof both these Marshals may, in the event of their being disabled from\r\nattending, be supplied by Vice-Marshals.\r\n\r\nWhen, as mentioned in Section 14, the Estate of Nobles and the other\r\nestates unite together, the Presidency of the Assembly devolves on the\r\nMarshal or Vice-Marshal of the Estate of Nobles.\r\n\r\nSection 19.—The United Diet is not connected in its functions with\r\nthose of circles, communes, or corporations; its functions are likewise\r\nindependent of the classes or persons which it represents; and these are\r\nnot allowed to give to the Deputies either instructions or commissions.\r\n\r\nSection 20.—Petitions or complaints must not be presented or delivered by\r\nany except the members of the United Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 21.—Petitions and complaints which we have once rejected must not\r\nagain be presented to us by the said Assembly, and must only be renewed\r\nwhen new causes give occasion for them.\r\n\r\nSection 22.—In all deliberations of the United Diet, or of single estates\r\nor provinces of the same (Sections 14 to 17), our Ministers of State, and\r\nalso such of our high officers as we appoint to attend during the whole\r\nsitting, or for particular occasions, shall be present, and shall take\r\npart in the discussions when they think necessary. They are not, however,\r\nto vote, except when they are authorized to do so as members of the Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 23.—The business of the United Diet is to be regulated according\r\nto rules approved by us.\r\n\r\nGiven under our autograph signature and royal seal.\r\n\r\n                                                       FREDERICK WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Feb. 3d, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDINANCE OF THE THIRD OF FEBRUARY, 1847, RESPECTING THE PERIODICAL\r\nASSEMBLING OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE UNITED DIET AND ITS PRIVILEGES.\r\n\r\nWe, Frederick William, by the grace of God, King of Prussia, etc., after\r\nhaving taken the opinion of our Ministers of State, make the following\r\nOrdinance, in pursuance of our letters patent of this day, in the matters\r\nof the affairs of the Diet, respecting the periodical assembling of the\r\nCommittee of the United Diet and its functions:—\r\n\r\nSection 1.—The Committees of the Provincial Diets are to be convened\r\nto form the Committee of the United Diet, according to the regulation\r\nlaid down by the Ordinances of June 21st, 1842. The former Princes of\r\nthe Empire in the province of Westphalia, as well as those in the Rhine\r\nProvince, are to be entitled to depute from amongst themselves two\r\nmembers each to the Committee of the United Diet, who may participate\r\nin its proceedings either in person or through plenipotentiaries from\r\nthe members of the Estate of Nobles of the United Diet. Besides this,\r\na Deputy is to proceed to the Committee of the United Diet from each\r\nof the provinces of Prussia, Brandenburgh, Pomerania, and Posen, to be\r\nelected by and from the members of the First Estate entitled to single\r\nor collective votes. As regards the province of Pomerania, the Prince\r\nof Putbus is to assume this post without election, so long as he\r\nremains the only nobleman in the province possessed of the qualification\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nThe election of the other members of the Committee is to take place at\r\nthe United Diet, in accordance with the Ordinances of the 21st of June,\r\n1842, through the representatives of the several provinces; but in the\r\ninterval between one United Diet and another as hitherto, viz., at each\r\nProvincial Diet.\r\n\r\nSection 2.—The Committee of the United Diet will be convened by us as\r\noften as a necessity arises therefor, but, at the farthest, four years\r\nafter the close of the last assembly of the same; or, if a United Diet\r\nhas been held in the mean time, within the same lapse of time after the\r\nclose of the latter.\r\n\r\nWe shall require, as a general rule, from the Committee of the United\r\nDiet, requisite advice, according to the general law of the 5th of June,\r\n1823, respecting the laws which have for their object alterations in\r\nthe rights of persons and property, or others than the alterations in\r\ntaxation designated in Section 9 of the Ordinance of this day, upon the\r\nformation of the United Diet, if these laws concern the whole monarchy or\r\nseveral provinces; and we hereby confer upon it the privilege of giving\r\nsuch advice, with full legal effect. The regulation in Article 3, No. 2,\r\nof the above-mentioned law is annulled by the present regulation.\r\n\r\nAs, however, we have already reserved to ourselves, in the Ordinance\r\nconcerning the formation of the United Diet, the right to acquire from it\r\nopinions of the same kind, in appropriate cases, we will equally reserve\r\nto ourselves the right to submit laws of the above-mentioned description\r\nwhich concern the whole monarchy or several provinces, in exceptional\r\ncases, for the opinion of the Provincial Diets, if this should appear\r\nadvisable for particular reasons—for example, for the sake of dispatch.\r\n\r\nSection 4.—The Committee of the United Diet, as the representative of\r\nthe United Diet, is to attend to business relating to the State debts,\r\npointed out in our Ordinance of this day, on the formation of the United\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\nSection 5.—The right of petition appertains to the Committee of the\r\nUnited Diet to the same extent as to the United Diet itself. Herefrom are\r\nexcepted, however, all proposals having alterations of the constitution\r\nof the Diet in view.\r\n\r\nSection 6.—Should we find ourselves induced to make communications\r\nto the said Committee of the United Diet upon the State finances, the\r\nregulations of the 11th Section of the Ordinance on the formation of the\r\nUnited Diet are to come into full operation.\r\n\r\nSection 7.—The conduct of business and the presidency of the Committee of\r\nthe United Diet is to be assumed by a Marshal, to be appointed by us, who\r\nwill be represented, in case of need, by a Vice-Marshal, to be similarly\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nSection 8.—The Committee of the United Diet is to deliberate as an\r\nundivided assembly. Its resolutions are, as a general rule, to be adopted\r\nby a simple majority of votes.\r\n\r\nPetitions and complaints are only to be laid before us if they have been\r\nvoted by at least two-thirds of the members.\r\n\r\nIf the Committee of the United Diet declares itself, on the deliberation\r\nof a law, against the law, or some of the provisions of the same, by a\r\nless majority than that above mentioned, the views of the minority are\r\nalso to be laid before us.\r\n\r\nSection 9.—The Provincial Diets are to communicate to their several\r\nCommittees no instructions or proposals for the Committee of the United\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\nSection 10.—The regulations of the 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22d, and 23d\r\nSections of the Ordinance of this day, on the formation of the United\r\nDiet, are also to come into full operation in the Committee of the United\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\nGiven under our royal hand and seal, at Berlin, February 3d, 1847.\r\n\r\n                                                       FREDERICK WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDINANCE FOR THE FORMATION OF A DEPUTATION OF THE DIET FOR THE AFFAIRS\r\nOF THE STATE DEBTS.\r\n\r\nWe, Frederick William, etc., ordain as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. In the execution of the co-operation proposed in the 6th Section of\r\nthe Ordinance of this day, relative to the formation of the United Diet,\r\nin the contraction of State loans in times of war, and for the current\r\nco-operation of the Diet in the reduction and extinction of the State\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nA deputation of the Diet shall be formed for the affairs of the State\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\n2. This deputation to consist of eight members, of whom one is to be\r\nchosen in each of the eight provinces, by the States of the province, for\r\na period of six years.\r\n\r\nThe election to take place at the United Diet, but in the interval\r\nbetween one Diet and another, at the Provincial Diets, according to the\r\nregulation relative to the proceedings in election of Diets of the 22d\r\nJune, 1842. The election must only fall on persons who are members of the\r\nDiet in question. If one of the elected members loses the qualification\r\nbefore the lapse of the sexennial period, he is also to secede from the\r\ndeputation. If, however, his secession is caused by his not having been\r\nre-elected as a Deputy of the Diet, he is to remain a member of the\r\ndeputation till the next Diet.\r\n\r\nTo each member of the deputation two _locum tenentes_ are to be chosen,\r\nof whom one is to replace him in case of emergency, as well as in the\r\nevent of a vacancy occurring in the interval between one Diet and\r\nanother. The choice of these _locum tenentes_ is to be made conformably\r\nwith the regulations respecting the actual members.\r\n\r\n3. The members of the deputation are to be sworn to the fulfillment of\r\ntheir duties in their summons.\r\n\r\nSection 4.—To the province of the deputation appertain the following\r\nduties, exclusively of the co-operation in the contraction of war loans\r\nconferred by the six sections already mentioned.\r\n\r\n1. The deputation is to take charge of the redeemed State debt documents,\r\naccording to the regulation of Article 14 of the Ordinance of 17th\r\nJanuary, 1820, and to effect their deposit in the Judicial Chamber.\r\n\r\n2. It is to audit the annual accounts of the interest and extinction\r\nof the State debts, after they have been previously revised by the\r\nupper chamber of accounts, and to cause them to be presented to us for\r\nour approval by the United Diet, or the Committee thereof, on its next\r\nassembly, according to the 14th Article of the Ordinance of January 17th,\r\n1820.\r\n\r\n3. It is authorized to undertake extraordinary revisions of the fund for\r\nthe extinction of the State debts and the control of the State papers, on\r\nthe occasion of its meeting.\r\n\r\nThe deputation for the affairs of the State debt will regularly meet once\r\na year, and besides this, as often as occasion demands; the summons to be\r\nmade by the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\n6. The deputation is to elect a President at each meeting, who must be\r\npresented to the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe presence of at least five members will be requisite to constitute a\r\nvalid act of the deputation.\r\n\r\nGiven under our hand, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                       FREDERICK WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Feb. 3, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE PRUSSIAN DIET.\r\n\r\nTHE KING’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1847.\r\n\r\n    [King Frederick William IV., on opening the Diet, made the\r\n    following speech, of sufficient importance to be added here,\r\n    when the circumstances of the grant of the Constitution are\r\n    considered.]\r\n\r\nIllustrious noble Princes, Counts, and Lords, my dear and trusty Orders\r\nof Nobles, Burghers, and Commons, I bid you from the depth of my heart\r\nwelcome on the day of the fulfillment of a great work of my father,\r\nresting in God, never to be forgotten, King William III., of glorious\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe noble edifice of representative freedom, the eight mighty pillars\r\nof which the King of blessed memory founded deep and unshakably in the\r\npeculiar organization of his provinces, is to-day perfected in your\r\nAssembly. It has received its protecting roof. The King wished to have\r\nfinished his work himself, but his views were shipwrecked in the utter\r\nimpracticability of the plans laid before him. Therefrom arose evils\r\nwhich his clear eye detected with grief, and, before all, the uncertainty\r\nwhich made many a noble soil susceptible of weeds. Let us bless, however,\r\nto-day the conscientiousness of the true beloved King, who despised his\r\nown earlier triumph in order to guard his folk from later ruin, and let\r\nus honor his memory by not perilling the existence of his completed work\r\nby the impatient haste of beginners.\r\n\r\nI give up beforehand all co-operation thereto. Let us suffer time, and,\r\nabove all, experience, to have their way; and let us commit the work, as\r\nis fitting, to the furthering and forming hands of Divine Providence.\r\nSince the commencement of the operation of the Provincial Diets, I have\r\nperceived the defects of individual portions of our representative life,\r\nand proposed to myself conscientiously the grave question, how they were\r\nto be remedied? My resolutions on this point have long since arrived\r\nat maturity. Immediately on my accession I made the first step towards\r\nrealizing them by forming the Committees of the Provincial Diets, and by\r\ncalling them together soon after.\r\n\r\nYou are aware, Lords and Gentlemen, that I have now made the days for\r\nthe meeting of those Committees periodical, and that I have confided to\r\nthem the free working of the Provincial Diets. For the ordinary run of\r\naffairs their deliberations will satisfactorily represent the desired\r\npoint of union. But the law of January 17th, 1820, respecting the State\r\ndebts, gives, in that portion of it not as yet carried out, rights and\r\nprivileges to the Orders which can be exercised neither by the Provincial\r\nAssemblies nor by the Committees.\r\n\r\nAs the heir of an unweakened crown, which I must and will hand down\r\nunweakened to my descendants, I know that I am perfectly free from all\r\nand every pledge with respect to what has not been carried out, and,\r\nabove all, with respect to that from the execution of which his own true\r\npaternal conscience preserved my illustrious predecessor. The law is,\r\nhowever, carried out in all its essential parts; an edifice of justice\r\nhas been built upon it, oaths have been sworn on it, and it has, all\r\nunfinished as it is, maintained itself as a wise law for seven-and-twenty\r\nyears. Therefore have I proceeded, with a cheerful heart indeed, but\r\nwith all the freedom of my kingly prerogative, to its final completion.\r\nI am, however, the irreconcilable enemy of all arbitrary proceedings,\r\nand must have been a foe, above all, to the idea of bringing together an\r\nartificial arbitrary assembly of the Orders, which should deprive the\r\nnoble creation of the King, my dear father—I mean the Provincial Diets—of\r\ntheir value. It has been, therefore, for many years my firm determination\r\nonly to form this Assembly, ordained by law, or by the fusion together\r\nof the Provincial Diets. It is formed; I have recognized your claim to\r\nall the rights flowing from that law; and, far beyond—yes, far beyond—all\r\nthe promises of the King of blessed memory, I have granted you, within\r\ncertain necessary limits, the right of granting taxes—a right, gentlemen,\r\nthe responsibility of which weighs far more heavily than the honor which\r\naccompanies it. This august Assembly will now denote important periods in\r\nthe existence of our State, which are treated of in my patent of February\r\n3d. As soon as those periods occur, I will assemble the Diets on each\r\nseparate occasion round my throne, in order to deliberate with them for\r\nthe welfare of my country, and to afford them an opportunity for the\r\nexercise of their rights. I have, however, reserved the express right\r\nof calling together these great Assemblies on extraordinary occasions,\r\nwhen I deem it good and profitable; and I will do this willingly and at\r\nmore frequent intervals, if this Diet gives me proof that I may act thus\r\nwithout prejudice to higher sovereign duties.\r\n\r\nMy trusty and free subjects have received all the laws which I and my\r\nfather have granted them for the protection of their highest interests,\r\nand especially the laws of the 3d of February, with warm gratitude, and\r\nwoe to him who shall dare to dash their thankfulness with care, or to\r\nturn it into ingratitude.\r\n\r\nEvery Prussian knows that for twenty-four years past all laws which\r\nconcern his freedom and property have been first discussed by the Orders,\r\nbut from this time forward let every one in my kingdom know that I, with\r\nthe sole necessary exception of the occurrence of the calamity of war,\r\nwill contract no State loan, levy no new taxes, nor increase existing\r\nones, without the free consent of all Orders.\r\n\r\nNoble Lords and trusty Orders, I know that with these rights I intrust\r\na costly jewel of freedom to your hands, and that you will employ\r\nit faithfully. But I know, as certainly, that many will mistake and\r\ndespise this jewel—that to many it is not enough. A portion of the\r\npress, for instance, demands outright from me and my Government a\r\nrevolution in Church and State, and from you, gentlemen, acts of\r\nimportunate ingratitude, of illegality—nay, of disobedience. Many also,\r\nand among them very worthy men, look for our safety in the conversion\r\nof the natural relation between Prince and people into a conventional\r\nexistence, granted by charters and ratified by oaths.\r\n\r\nMay, however, the example of the one happy country, whose constitution\r\ncenturies and a hereditary wisdom without a parallel, but no sheets of\r\npaper, have made, not be lost upon us, but find the respect which it\r\ndeserves. If other countries find their happiness in another way than\r\nthat people and ourselves, namely, in the way of “manufactured and\r\ngranted” constitutions, we must and will praise their happiness in an\r\nupright and brotherly manner. We will, with the justest admiration,\r\nconsider the sublime example, when a strong will of iron consequence\r\nand high intelligence succeeds in delaying, in mastering, and allaying\r\nevery crisis of serious importance; and above all, when this tends to\r\nthe welfare of Germany, and the maintenance of the peace of Europe. But\r\nPrussia, gentlemen, Prussia can not bear such a state of things. Do you\r\nask why? I answer, cast your eyes at the map of Europe, at the position\r\nof our country, at its component parts; follow the line of our borders,\r\nweigh the power of our neighbors, throw before all an enlightened glance\r\non our history. It has pleased God to make Prussia strong by the sword of\r\nwar from without, and by the sword of intellect from within; not, surely,\r\nby the negative intellect of the age, but by the spirit of moderation and\r\norder. I speak out boldly, gentlemen. As in the camp, unless in cases\r\nof the most urgent danger or grossest folly, the command can only be\r\nrested in the will of one, so can the destinies of this country, unless\r\nit is to fall instantly from its height, only be guided by one will; and\r\nif the King of Prussia would commit an abomination, were he to demand\r\nfrom his subjects the subserviency of a slave, so would he commit a far\r\ngreater abomination were he not to demand from them the crowning virtue\r\nof freemen—I mean obedience for the sake of God and conscience. Whoever\r\nis alarmed at the tenor of these words, him I refer to the development of\r\nour laws for a century back, to the edicts of the Orders, and finally, to\r\nthis Assembly and its rights; there he may find consolation if he will.\r\n\r\nNoble Lords and trusty Orders, I am forced to the solemn declaration,\r\nthat no power on earth will ever succeed in moving me to change the\r\nnatural—and, in our own case, so imperatively necessary—relation between\r\nPrince and people, into something merely conventional or constitutional;\r\nand that, once for all, I will never suffer a written sheet of paper to\r\nforce itself in, as it were a second providence, between our Lord God in\r\nHeaven and this people, in order to rule us with its paragraphs, and to\r\nreplace by them our ancient and time-hallowed trusty reliance on each\r\nother. Between us be truth. From _one_ weakness I feel myself entirely\r\nfree—I strive not for idle popular favor; who could do so if he has read\r\nhistory aright? I strive alone to fulfill my duty, so as to satisfy my\r\nunderstanding and my conscience, and to deserve the thanks of my people,\r\neven though it be never my lot to obtain it.\r\n\r\nNoble Lords and trusty Orders, it has often caused me care and impatience\r\nduring the first years of my reign, that I could not remove hinderances\r\nwhich opposed an earlier convocation of your Assembly. I was wrong. On\r\nboth sides we should have been poorer by many experiences, poorer by\r\nexperiences in part of a costly nature; but all of them, if not always\r\ngood, yet for us of priceless worth. We have now lying open before us the\r\nexperiences of seven years, and, by God’s good pleasure, not in vain. The\r\nworking of parties on one side, and the temper of my people on the other,\r\nare now clear and indubitable. It is a splendid privilege of the kingly\r\noffice, that it can on all occasions call things by their right names\r\nwithout fear. I will do this to-day before you, as a duty which I have to\r\nfulfill. I beg you now to follow me a moment, while with a sharp eye we\r\nconsider the state of things at home.\r\n\r\nThe dearth which has visited Europe of latter years, has also penetrated\r\nto us, if with less severity than in other countries. It has, however,\r\nfound us well prepared, and I can give my Government the honorable\r\ntestimonial that it has honestly done its part towards alleviating the\r\ncalamity. There are, also, means further to resist it, if God spares us\r\nfrom new failures in the crops. Here I must mention private benevolence,\r\nwhich, in these times, has manifested itself anew so nobly, so\r\ncheeringly; and I pay it here, before you, the tribute of my admiration\r\nand my gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the national debt is progressing. The taxes are\r\ndiminished, the finances are put in order. I have to-day the happiness\r\nto offer the provinces, for the use of their treasuries, a donation of\r\n2,000,000 rix-dollars.\r\n\r\nThe management of affairs, and the administration of justice, are with\r\nus in a purer condition than almost in any other country; publicity is\r\nestablished in our Courts; roads, canals, all kinds of improvements of\r\nthe land are proceeding to an extent before unknown; science and art are\r\nin the most flourishing condition; the national prosperity is increasing;\r\ntrade and industry, if, alas! not protected against their European\r\nvicissitudes, are comparatively satisfactory; paternal care and good-will\r\nare certainly nowhere to be mistaken; the press is as free as the laws of\r\nthe Confederation permit; the freedom of confession is associated with\r\nanimating power to our old liberty of faith and conscience; and our just\r\npride and strong shield, my army of the line and militia, may be called\r\nincomparable.\r\n\r\nWith our neighbors and with the Powers on this and the other side of the\r\nocean we stand on the best terms, and our relation to our allies, in\r\ncombination with whom we once freed Germany, and from the happy concord\r\nof whom depends the maintenance of a thirty-two years’ peace in a great\r\npart of Europe, is firmer and closer than ever.\r\n\r\nI could add much which would be calculated to bend our knees in thanks\r\ntowards God, but this will suffice. For it is quite sufficient to\r\nfound this gratitude, and a state of contentment, which in an honest\r\ncomparison, in spite of many just wishes, appears quite natural.\r\nBefore all, one would think that the press must diffuse gratitude and\r\ncontentment on all sides, for I venture to say that it is the press\r\nwhich, to a particular extent, owes me thanks. Noble Lords and faithful\r\nStates, I require your German hearts to grant me those thanks. While\r\nrecognizing the honorable endeavor to elevate the press by a noble and\r\nconscientious spirit, it is yet unquestionable that in a portion of it a\r\ndark spirit of destruction prevails, a spirit that entices to revolution,\r\nand that deals in the most audacious falsehood, disgraceful to German\r\nfidelity and Prussian honor. I know that the genuine sense of the people\r\nremains firm, but we do not deceive ourselves as to the evil fruits of\r\nthe evil tree, which meet us in the shape of dissatisfaction and want of\r\nconfidence, attended by still worse facts, such as open disobedience,\r\nsecret conspiracy, a declared revolt from all which is sacred to good\r\nmen, and attempted regicide. Even in our churches are seen those fruits,\r\ntogether with the twofold death in indifference and fanaticism. But\r\necclesiastical matters do not belong to the States. They have their\r\nlegitimate organs in the two confessions. One confession of faith I am,\r\non this day, unable to suppress, bearing in mind the frightful attempt to\r\ndefraud my people of its holiest jewel—its faith in the Redeemer, Lord\r\nand King of itself and of us all. This avowal is as follows. [Here his\r\nmajesty arose, and spoke the word standing, and with right hand uplifted]\r\n“I and my house, we will serve the Lord.”\r\n\r\nI turn my troubled glance from the aberrations of a few to the whole of\r\nmy people. Then does it grow bright with tears of joy; there, my lords,\r\namid all the heavy troubles of government, is my consolation. My people\r\nis still the old Christian people—the honest, true, valiant people—which\r\nhas fought the battles of my fathers, and the honorable qualities of\r\nwhich have only grown with the greatness and fame of their country,\r\nwhich once, like no other, in the days of trouble, bound itself to its\r\npaternal King, and bore him, as it were, upon its shoulders from victory\r\nto victory,—a people, my lords, often tempted by the arts of seduction,\r\nbut always found proof against them. Even out of the strongest of these\r\ntrials it will come forth pure. Already is the impious sport with\r\nChristianity, the abuse of religion as a means of distinction, recognized\r\nin its true form as sacrilege, and is dying away. My firm reliance upon\r\nthe fidelity of my people, as the surest means of extinguishing the\r\nconflagration, has been ever nobly rewarded both by the older and the\r\nyounger sons of our Prussian country, even where another language than\r\nours is spoken.\r\n\r\nTherefore, hear this well, Lords and faithful States, and may all the\r\ncountry hear it through you. From all the indignities to which I and my\r\nGovernment have been exposed for some years, I appeal to my people! From\r\nall evils which perhaps are still in reserve for me, I appeal beforehand\r\nto my people! My people knows my heart, my faith and love to it, and\r\nadheres in love and faith to me. My people does not wish the association\r\nof representatives in the Government, the weakening of rank, the division\r\nof sovereignty, the breaking up of the authority of its kings, who have\r\nfounded its history, its freedom, its prosperity, and who alone can\r\nprotect its dearest acquisitions, and will protect them, God willing, as\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\nKnow, my lords, I do not read the feelings of my people in the green\r\narches and huzzahs of festivity; still less in the praise and blame of\r\nthe press, or in the doubtful, sometimes criminal, demands of certain\r\naddresses which are sent to the Throne, and States, or elsewhere. I have\r\nread them with my own eyes in the touching thanks of men for benefits\r\nscarcely promised, scarcely begun; here, where broad districts of land\r\nstood under water; there, where men scarcely recovered from hunger. In\r\ntheir grateful joy, in their wet eyes, did I read their feelings three\r\nyears ago, when the lives of myself and the Queen were so wonderfully\r\npreserved. This is truth—and in my words is truth, when I say, that it is\r\na noble people; and I feel entirely the happiness of presiding over such\r\na people. And your hearts will understand me and accord with me, when in\r\nthis great hour I urgently call upon you—“Be worthy of this people!”\r\n\r\nIllustrious Princes, Counts, and Lords, you will have recognized in\r\nthe position assigned to you by law in this United Diet, my intention\r\nthat that position should be a dignified one, at once answering to the\r\nconception of a German order of nobles, and also beneficial to the whole\r\ncommunity. I rely upon your deeply feeling at this hour, and in these\r\ntimes, what is meant by being the first of a nation, and also what is\r\nrequired at your hands. You will repay my confidence.\r\n\r\nYou, my Lords of the nobility, and my faithful Burghers and Commons,\r\nare, I am firmly persuaded, impressed with this truth, that on this day,\r\nand in this hour, you are the first of your respective Orders; but,\r\ntherefore, also the protectors of your ancient renown. Look at this\r\nthrone! Your fathers and mine—many princes of your race, and of mine,\r\nand myself—have fought for the preservation, the deliverance, and the\r\nhonor of that throne, and for the existence of our native land. God was\r\nwith us! There is now a new battle to be fought on behalf of the same\r\nglorious possessions—a peaceful one, indeed, but its combats are not\r\na whit less important than those of the field of war. And God will be\r\nwith us yet again, for the battle is against the evil tendencies of the\r\nage. Your unanimity with me, the prompt expression of your wish to aid\r\nme in improving the domain of rights (that true field for the labor of\r\nkings), will make this Diet a pitched battle gained against every evil\r\nand lawless influence that troubles and dishonors Germany; and the work\r\nwill be to your renown and that of the country, and the contentment and\r\nsatisfaction of the people.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the Nobles, be now and for the future, as of old, the\r\nfirst to follow the banner of the Hohenzollerns, that for three centuries\r\nhas led you on to honor. And you, Burghers, give to the whole world a\r\nliving testimony that the intelligence—the great mass of which you are\r\nproud to represent—is, among us, that right and true one which ennobles\r\nby the development of religion and morality, and by the love of your King\r\nand country. And you, representatives of the Commons, you and your Order\r\nare never the last when your country and your King call on you, whether\r\nit be in peace or in war. Hear the voice of your King, that tells you\r\nthey require you again!\r\n\r\nIn my kingdom, neither of the three Orders ranks above or beneath the\r\nother. They stand beside each other on an equality of rights and honor,\r\nbut each within its limits, each with its own province. This is a\r\npracticable and reasonable equality. This is freedom.\r\n\r\nNoble Lords and trusty Orders, a word more on the question—yes, the\r\nquestion of existence between the Throne and the different Orders. The\r\nlate King, after mature consideration, called them into existence,\r\naccording to the German and historical idea of them; and in this idea\r\nalone have I continued his work. Impress yourselves, I entreat you, with\r\nthe spirit of this definition. You are German Orders, in the anciently\r\nreceived sense of the word—that is, you are truly, and before all,\r\n“representatives and defenders of your own rights,” the rights of those\r\nOrders whose confidence has sent here the far greater portion of this\r\nAssembly. But after that you are to exercise those rights which the Crown\r\nhas recognized as yours; you have, further, conscientiously to give the\r\nCrown that advice it requires of you. Finally, you are free to bring\r\npetitions and complaints, after mature deliberation, to the foot of the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nThose are the rights, those the duties, of German Orders; this is your\r\nglorious vocation. But it is not your province to represent opinions,\r\nor bring opinions of the day, or of this or that school, into practical\r\noperation. That is wholly un-German, and, besides, completely useless\r\nfor the good of the community, for it would lead necessarily to\r\ninextricable embarrassments with the Crown, which must govern according\r\nto the law of God and the land, and its own free, unbiased resolution,\r\nbut which can not and dares not govern according to the will of the\r\nmajority, if “Prussia” would not soon become an empty sound in Europe.\r\nClearly recognizing my office and your vocation, and firmly resolved\r\nto treat that recognition faithfully under all circumstances, I have\r\nappeared among you, and addressed you with royal freedom. With the same\r\nopenness, and as the highest proof of my confidence in you, I here\r\ngive you my royal word that I should not have called you together had\r\nI had the smallest suspicion that you would otherwise understand your\r\nduties, or that you had any desire to play the part of what are called\r\nrepresentatives of the people. I should not have called you together\r\nfor that purpose, because, according to my deepest and most heartfelt\r\nconviction, the Throne and State would be endangered by it, and because\r\nI recognize it as my first duty, under all circumstances and events, to\r\npreserve the Throne, the State, and my Government, as they at present\r\nexist. I remember the axiom of a royal friend, “Confidence awakens\r\nconfidence.” That is this day my brightest hope. That my confidence\r\nin you is great, I have proved by my words, and sealed by my act. And\r\nfrom you, gentlemen, I expect a proof of confidence in return, and\r\nan answer in the same manner—by your acts. God is my witness, I have\r\nsummoned you as your truest, best, and most faithful friend; and I firmly\r\nbelieve that, among the hundreds before me, there is not one who is not\r\nresolved, at this moment, to preserve that friendship. Many of you were\r\nat Königsberg on the 10th of September, 1840; and I can even now hear\r\nthe thunder of your voices as you pronounced the oath of fidelity, that\r\nthen penetrated my soul. Many of you, on the day on which I received\r\nthe homage of my hereditary estates, joined with thousands in the still\r\nechoing “Yes!” with which you replied to my demand whether you would, “in\r\nword and deed, in heart and spirit, in truth and love, help and assist\r\nme to preserve Prussia as it is, and as it must remain, if it would not\r\nperish: that you would not let or hinder me in the path of considerate\r\nbut vigorous progress, but endure with me through good days and through\r\nevil.” Now redeem your word—now fulfill that vow!\r\n\r\nYou can do it by the exercise of one of your most important\r\nduties—namely, by choosing from among you faithful and upright friends\r\nof the Throne and of our good purpose for your Committees—men who have\r\ncomprehended that at this time it is the first duty of the Orders\r\nto encourage and support the good disposition and fidelity of the\r\ncountry by their own example, and, on the contrary, to strike down and\r\ndiscountenance every kind of many-headed faithlessness—men who, enemies\r\nof every kind of slavery, are, above all, enemies of that shameful\r\nyoke which a misguiding opinion (branding the name of freedom of\r\nthought) would lay upon your necks. This selection is a very critical\r\nact—one pregnant with consequences. Weigh it in your hearts, and choose\r\nconscientiously.\r\n\r\nRemember, also, that the day of uncertainty as to the form which the\r\nactivity of the Orders is to take is passed. Many things, which, under\r\nthis uncertainty, forbearance could excuse, have henceforth no excuse\r\nremaining. The 3d of February of this year, like the 3d of February,\r\n1818, has opened to the real children of our fatherland that path they\r\nhave now to pursue: and the same unspeakable happiness which then fell\r\nto the lot of my glorious father is now also mine—mine in this moment. I\r\nspeak, as he did, to the hearts of German-of Prussian men!\r\n\r\nGo, then, illustrious Princes, Counts, and Lords—dear and faithful Orders\r\nof Nobles, Burghers, and Commons—proceed, with God’s help to your task.\r\nYou will, I am certain, in this moment, when all Europe is gazing on you,\r\nand through all the future labors of the Diet, prove yourselves true\r\nPrussians; and that one thing, believe me, will not be absent—namely,\r\nGod’s blessing, on which all things depend. Out of our unanimity it will\r\ndescend on the present and future generations, and, I hope, on all our\r\nglorious German fatherland, in one broad stream, beside which we may\r\ndwell in peace and safety, as by the shores of the blessing-bringing\r\nrivers that water the earth. And now, once more, and out of the fullness\r\nof my heart,—welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n(Page 394.)\r\n\r\n\r\nICH BIN EIN PREUSSE!\r\n\r\n    Ich bin ein Preusse, kennt ihr meine Farben?\r\n      Die Fahne schwebt mir weiss und schwarz voran;\r\n    Dass für die Freiheit meine Vater starben,\r\n      Das deuten, merkt es, meine Farben an;\r\n    Nie werd’ ich bang verzagen; wie jene will ich’s wagen;\r\n        Sei’s trüber Tag, sei’s heitrer Sonnenschein:\r\n        Ich bin ein Preusse, will ein Preusse sein!\r\n\r\n    Mit Lieb’ und Treue nah’ ich mich dem Throne,\r\n      Von welchem mild zu mir ein Vater spricht;\r\n    Und wie der Vater treu mit seinem Sohne,\r\n      So steh’ ich treu mit ihm und wanke nicht.\r\n    Fest sind der Liebe Bande: Heil meinem Vaterlande!\r\n        Des König’s Ruf dringt in das Herz mir ein;\r\n        Ich bin ein Preusse, will ein Preusse sein!\r\n\r\n    Nicht jeder Tag kann glühn im Sonnenlichte,\r\n      Ein Wölkchen und ein Schauer kommt zur Zeit;\r\n    Drum lese Keiner mir es im Gesichte\r\n      Dass nicht der Wünsche jeder mir gedeiht.\r\n    Wohl tauschten nah’ und ferne mit mir gar Viele gerne.\r\n        Ihr Glück ist Trug, und ihre Freiheit Schein;\r\n        Ich bin ein Preusse, will ein Preusse sein!\r\n\r\n    Und wenn der böse Sturm mich einst umsauset,\r\n      Die Nacht entbrennet in des Blitzes Gluth;\r\n    Hat’s doch schon ärger in der Welt gebrauset,\r\n      Und was nicht bebte, war des Preussen Muth.\r\n    Mag Fels und Eiche splittern, ich werde nicht erzittern;\r\n        Es stürm und krach; es blitze wild darein!\r\n        Ich bin ein Preusse, will ein Preusse sein!\r\n\r\n    Wo Lieb’ und Treu’ sich so dem König weihen,\r\n      Wo Fürst und Volk sich reichen so die Hand:\r\n    Da muss des Volkes wahres Glück gedeihen,\r\n      Da blüht und wächst das schöne Vaterland.\r\n    So schwören wir auf’s Neue dem König Lieb und Treue!\r\n        Fest sei der Bund!

The air to which it is sung is\r\nwild and martial; derived undoubtedly from an ancient Polish hymn, to\r\nwhich it bears a striking affinity, and of which it may be regarded as a\r\nmusical synonym. The present editor offers a version which is tolerably\r\nclose, although he can not hope to preserve the actual tone of the\r\noriginal author.\r\n\r\n\r\nI AM A PRUSSIAN.\r\n\r\n    I am a Prussian! see my colors gleaming—\r\n      The black-white standard floats before me free;\r\n    For Freedom’s rights, my fathers’ heart-blood streaming,\r\n      Such, mark ye, mean the black and white to me!\r\n    Shall I then prove a coward?
