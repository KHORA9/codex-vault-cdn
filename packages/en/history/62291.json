Reasons of space make it impossible to\r\ninclude the siege of Burgos and the retreat which followed. I had\r\nwritten the narrative of them, but found it impossible to add six long\r\nchapters to the 620 pages already in print. The fact is that, from\r\nthe point of view of Wellington’s army, the year 1812 was much more\r\ntightly packed with military events than any which had gone before. In\r\n1809 there was nothing important to chronicle after August: in 1810\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese did not come into the forefront of the war till\r\nJuly, when Masséna had crossed the frontier and laid siege to Almeida.\r\nIn 1811 the year opened with a deadlock, which was only ended by the\r\ncommencement of Masséna’s retreat on March 9th, and concluded with\r\na similar deadlock which endured from July to December--interrupted\r\nonly by the short campaign of El Bodon and Aldea da Ponte, and this\r\ncovered only a week [Sept. 22-9]. In 1812 the great strategical\r\noperations began on the first day of the year with the concentration\r\nfor the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, and did not end till the last week of\r\nNovember--which saw Wellington once more encamped under the walls of\r\nthat fortress. For eleven months on end he had been on the move, with\r\nonly a brief rest in cantonments between April 24th, the day when he\r\ngave up his pursuit of Marmont in Northern Portugal, and the end of\r\nMay, when his divisions began to assemble again for the projected march\r\non Salamanca. But for this short break his operations were continuous,\r\nand the narrative of them must of necessity be lengthy.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1812 cannot be called the greatest exhibition of\r\nmilitary genius in Wellington’s career: that distinction must be given\r\nto the campaign of 1813. But it included the battle of Salamanca, the\r\nmost skilfully fought and the most decisive of all his victories,\r\n‘the beating of forty thousand men in forty minutes.’ And its earlier\r\nepisodes, the two sudden strokes which ended in the storming of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and of Badajoz, deserve the closest attention, as showing a\r\nmarvellous power of utilizing opportunities, and solving time-problems\r\nof the most complicated sort. We shall see how Wellington, in face\r\nof an enemy whose whole force was far superior to his own, so\r\nconducted his operations that he had success in his hands before the\r\nFrench armies could concentrate to overwhelm him. He would have been\r\nvictorious in 1812 even without the assistance that was given him\r\nduring the early months of the year by Napoleon’s misguided orders from\r\nParis, and in the summer by Soult’s repeated and deliberate refusal to\r\nco-operate with King Joseph and Marmont for the general welfare of the\r\nFrench cause in Spain. The limits of his success were largely extended\r\nby those adventitious circumstances, but even without them he must\r\nhave achieved great things by force of the combinations which he had\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find that I have devoted a good deal of space to the\r\nprecise working out of the effect of Napoleon’s successive dispatches\r\nto Marmont, with reference to the time at which each was received, and\r\nthe influence which it had on the Marshal’s movements. I am bound to\r\nsay that careful study has convinced me that Marmont’s justification\r\nof his own actions from January to May, written in the fourth volume\r\nof his _Mémoires_, is in the main fair and sensible, and that his\r\ncriticism of his master’s orders is as sound as it is lucid. Napier\r\nheld the reverse opinion, but his arguments in support of it are\r\nunconvincing: he is set on proving his idol infallible at all costs, in\r\nthis as in so many other cases.\r\n\r\nI find myself equally at variance with Napier’s estimate of the\r\nrelative share of responsibility that falls on Soult upon the one\r\nside and King Joseph and Jourdan on the other, for the disasters\r\nof the summer of 1812. Jourdan’s plan of campaign, set out in\r\nhis ‘May _Mémoire_’ [see pp. 303-11], is a most clear-headed and\r\npracticable scheme; the adoption of it would have reduced the effect\r\nof Wellington’s strategy, and have set a limit to his successes.\r\nSoult wrecked the whole scheme by wilful disobedience, which sinned\r\nas much against military discipline as against common sense. The\r\ncounter-projects which he kept sending to Jourdan and the King were\r\nfounded on his own personal desires, not on a consideration of the\r\ngeneral situation in the Peninsula. Soult had been kind and courteous\r\nto Napier while the historian was working at the French archives, and\r\nhad placed his own private papers at his disposition. I think that the\r\nobligation was repaid by the mildness of the censures passed on the\r\nMarshal’s strange behaviour in the summer of 1812.\r\n\r\nA smaller proportion of the pages of this volume than of its\r\npredecessors is occupied by the tale of those campaigns in the\r\nPeninsula in which the British took no part. The year 1812 commences\r\nwith the surrender of Blake and the occupation of Valencia by the\r\nFrench. When that great city and the army that had been driven into\r\nit succumbed before Suchet’s attack, there was no longer any large\r\nSpanish force in the field, and the operations of Lacy, Ballasteros,\r\nand the Galicians are of only secondary importance and require no\r\ngreat attention. Indeed the most effective service done against the\r\nFrench in 1812 was that of the guerrilleros of Aragon, Cantabria, and\r\nNavarre, whose obstinate resistance immobilized such a large portion of\r\nthe 230,000 imperial troops that lay in Spain. It will be noted that I\r\nhave had to devote a considerable number of pages to a much-neglected\r\nepisode of the summer of 1812--the campaigns against Caffarelli of the\r\nirregular bands of the North, assisted by the fleet of Sir Home Popham.\r\nIt cannot be too often repeated that by immobilizing the 35,000 men of\r\nthe French Army of the North, they co-operated in the most effective\r\nway with Wellington, and had their share in making the Salamanca\r\ncampaign a success for the allies.\r\n\r\nI trust that I may have succeeded in making the topographical details\r\nclear at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and more especially Salamanca, all of\r\nwhich I have visited. I spent many hours going over the ground at the\r\nArapiles, and found that no mere map could have enabled one to grasp\r\nthe situation in a satisfactory fashion.\r\n\r\nI have once more to express my indebtedness to the owners of two\r\ngreat files of Peninsular War documents, who were good enough to\r\nplace them at my disposition and to allow me to bring them to Oxford.\r\nThe D’Urban papers, lent to me by Mr. W. S. M. D’Urban, of Newport\r\nHouse, near Exeter, the grandson of Sir Benjamin D’Urban, Beresford’s\r\nChief-of-the-Staff, continue to be of immense value all through 1812.\r\nIn the first half of the year Sir Benjamin was still at the Portuguese\r\nhead-quarters, and his diary and correspondence give the views of those\r\nwho had the best opportunity of knowing Wellington’s plans from the\r\ninside. In June he was appointed to another post, that of commanding\r\nthe detached Portuguese cavalry brigade which covered Wellington’s left\r\nflank in the Salamanca campaign; his notes as to his operations are\r\nof extreme interest throughout June, July, and August; the narratives\r\nwhich he drew up concerning his own fortunes at the battle of\r\nSalamanca, and at the unfortunate combat of Majalahonda, have cleared\r\nup several obscure problems, which no published material could have\r\nenabled me to solve.\r\n\r\nThe papers of Sir George Scovell, lent me by his great-nephew, Mr. G.\r\nScovell, of Hove, had already begun to be of use to me in the chronicle\r\nof 1811. But in 1812 they are of far greater importance, since it was\r\nearly in that year that Scovell was placed by Wellington in charge\r\nof the toilsome duty of studying and decoding all French captured\r\ndispatches written in cipher. The originals were left in his hands,\r\nand only the interpretations, written out in full, were made over to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief. These originals, often scraps of the smallest\r\ndimensions made to be concealed in secret places about the person of\r\nthe bearer, are historical antiquities of the highest interest. Their\r\nimportance is so great that I have thought it necessary to give in\r\nAppendix XV a detailed account of them, of the characteristics of the\r\n‘Great Paris Cipher’--as Scovell called it--and of the contents of each\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nI must mention, as in previous volumes, much kind help given to me\r\nfrom abroad. The authorities of the Paris War Office have continued to\r\nfacilitate my researches among their bulky _cartons_. I have to notice\r\nwith sincere regret the death of my old friend, M. Martinien, who did\r\nso much for me while I was compiling volumes III and IV of this work. I\r\nmuch missed his guidance while working over the material of 1812 during\r\nthe last two autumns. Colonel Juan Arzadun, of the Madrid Artillery\r\nMuseum, has continued to send me occasional information, and I am\r\nspecially obliged to Don Rafael Farias for procuring for me, and making\r\nme a present of, that very rare document the 1822 ‘Estados de los\r\nejércitos españoles durante la guerra contra Bonaparte,’ a collection\r\nof morning-states and tables of organization on which I had in vain\r\ntried to lay hands during three successive visits to Madrid. Another\r\ngift of the highest value was the complete set of Beresford’s _Ordens\r\ndo Dia_ for the Portuguese army, ranging over the whole war. This most\r\nuseful series was presented to me by my friend Mr. Rafael Reynolds,\r\nthe companion of my last Portuguese tour, who found a copy of this\r\nalmost unprocurable file at Lisbon. I owe the two views of the field\r\nof Salamanca to the camera of Mr. C. J. Armstrong, who sent them to me\r\nalong with many other interesting Peninsular photographs.\r\n\r\nThree friends in England have continued to give me help of the most\r\ninvaluable kind. Mr. C. T. Atkinson, Fellow of Exeter College,\r\nhas looked through the whole of my proofs, and furnished me with\r\ninnumerable notes, which enabled me to add to the accuracy of my\r\nnarrative. He has also written me an appendix, No. XIV, concerning the\r\nEnglish troops which in 1812 operated on the East coast of Spain--and\r\nthe others which formed the garrisons of Gibraltar, Cadiz, and Tarifa.\r\nThe Hon. John Fortescue, the historian of the British army, has not\r\nonly answered at length my queries on many obscure problems, but has\r\nlent me the file of his transcripts of French dispatches for 1812, a\r\ngood many of which, and those of high importance, were unknown to me.\r\nThey were especially valuable for Soult’s operations. Our narratives of\r\nthe campaigns of 1812 will appear almost simultaneously, and I think it\r\nwill be found that all our main opinions are in agreement. Major J. H.\r\nLeslie, R.A., has once more contributed to this volume an ‘Artillery\r\nAppendix’ on the same lines as those for 1810 and 1811 in vols. III and\r\nIV. His researches have always proved exhaustive and invaluable for the\r\nhistory of his old Corps.\r\n\r\nLastly, the compiler of the Index, a task executed this summer under\r\nvery trying conditions, must receive, for the fifth time, my heartfelt\r\nthanks for her labour of love.\r\n\r\nAs in previous volumes, the critic may find some slight discrepancies\r\nbetween the figures given with regard to strengths of regiments or\r\nlosses in action in the text and in the Appendices. This results from\r\nthe fact that many official documents contain incorrect arithmetic,\r\nwhich was only discovered by the indefatigable proof-readers of the\r\nClarendon Press, who have tested all the figures, and found not\r\ninfrequent (if minute) errors. The text was printed off before the\r\nAppendices were finally dealt with: where the numbers differ those\r\nin the Appendices are, of course, to be preferred. But the worst\r\ndiscrepancies do not get beyond units and tens.\r\n\r\n  C. OMAN.\r\n\r\nOXFORD:\r\n  _July 27, 1914_.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--When every page of the text, appendices, and index of this\r\nvolume has been printed off, and the final proofs of the preface are\r\npassing through my hands, comes the news that Great Britain is most\r\nunexpectedly involved in a war to which there can be no parallel named\r\nsave the struggle that ended just a hundred years ago. May her strength\r\nbe used as effectively against military despotism in the twentieth as\r\nit was in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n  _Aug. 5, 1914._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION XXX\r\n\r\n  SUCHET’S CONQUEST OF VALENCIA, SEPTEMBER 1811-JANUARY 1812\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER      PAGE\r\n\r\n  I.

SEPTEMBER 1811-JANUARY 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE INVASION OF VALENCIA. SIEGE OF SAGUNTUM. SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1811\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last volume of this work the chronicle of all the campaigns of\r\n1811 was completed, save in one corner of Spain, where, on the eastern\r\ncoast, the fortunes of the French armies have only been pursued down\r\nto the recall of Marshal Macdonald to Paris on October 28th. Already,\r\nbefore the Duke of Tarentum had been added to the list of the generals\r\nwho had been withdrawn and superseded for failure in Catalonia, another\r\nseries of operations had been begun in the East, which was destined\r\nto lead directly to one more Spanish disaster, but indirectly to the\r\nruin of the French cause in Spain. For, as has already been pointed out\r\nin the last pages of the last volume[1], it was to be the diversion\r\nby Napoleon’s orders of French divisions eastward, from the borders\r\nof Portugal to those of Valencia, that was to give Wellington his\r\nlong-desired opportunity of opening a successful offensive campaign\r\nagainst his immediate opponents in the West. The fall of Valencia was\r\nto lead to the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812.\r\n\r\n  [1] vol. iv. pp. 587-91.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Emperor’s ambitious schemes for the\r\nconquest of the kingdom of Valencia, the last district of eastern\r\nSpain where he had as yet secured no solid foothold, had been deferred\r\nperforce till Figueras fell, on August 19, 1811. As long as that great\r\nfortress, which lies only a few miles from the French frontier, and\r\nblocks the main road from Perpignan to Barcelona, had been maintained\r\nagainst Macdonald by the resolute Martinez, it was impossible to\r\ntake up a new offensive campaign: all the disposable French troops in\r\nCatalonia were immobilized around the stubborn garrison. At length the\r\nremnant of the starving miqueletes had laid down their arms, and the\r\ntroops which had been for so long blockading them became disposable for\r\nthe assistance of Suchet, whose ‘Army of Aragon’ was to deliver the\r\nmain blow against Valencia.\r\n\r\nSix days after the surrender of Figueras the news that the obstacle\r\nto advance had been at last removed reached Paris, on August 25, and\r\non the same evening Berthier wrote, by his master’s orders, to bid\r\nSuchet move forward: ‘Everything leads us to believe that Valencia is\r\nin a state of panic, and that, when Murviedro has been taken and a\r\nbattle in the open field has been won, that city will surrender. If\r\nyou judge otherwise, and think that you must wait to bring up your\r\nsiege artillery for the attack on the place, or that you must wait\r\nfor a better season [i. e. early autumn] to commence the operation, I\r\nmust inform you that, in every case, it is the imperative order of the\r\nEmperor that your head-quarters are to be on Valencian territory on or\r\nabout September 15th, and as far forward towards the city as possible.’\r\n\r\nThe orders were feasible, and (as we shall see) were duly executed:\r\nbut Napoleon had committed his usual mistake of undervaluing the\r\ntenacity of the Spanish enemy, whom he so deeply despised. Suchet set\r\nhis troops in motion on September 15th; he took Murviedro--but only\r\nafter a desperate siege of two months--he beat the army of Valencia in\r\na very decisive pitched battle, but the city by no means fulfilled the\r\nEmperor’s prophecy by a prompt surrender. Fighting round its walls went\r\non for five weeks after Murviedro fell: and it was not till troops had\r\nbeen brought to aid Suchet from very remote provinces, that he at last\r\ncompelled the capitulation of Valencia after the New Year of 1812 had\r\npassed. Before the city yielded Wellington was on the move, far away\r\non the Portuguese frontier, and it was not many days after Suchet’s\r\naide-de-camp brought the glorious news of the capitulation of Valencia,\r\nthat Marmont’s aide-de-camp followed, with the wholly unexpected and\r\nunwelcome tidings that the British had stormed Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nthat the hold of the French army on Leon and Castile had been shaken.\r\nThe one piece of information was the complement and consequence of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s invasion of Valencia, in short, was a much harder and more\r\nventuresome enterprise than his master had calculated. It was true that\r\nthe Spanish forces in front of him seemed in September wholly incapable\r\nof holding him back. The Army of Catalonia had been reduced by a series\r\nof disasters, culminating in the falls of Tarragona and Figueras, to a\r\nmere remnant of 8,000 men, lurking in the high hills of the interior.\r\nThe Army of Valencia had made a miserable exhibition of itself during\r\nthe last year: it had brought no effective help to the Catalans, and\r\nwhenever any of its detachments came into contact with the French, they\r\nhad invariably suffered discreditable defeats, even when their numbers\r\nwere far greater than those of the invaders. Of all the armies of Spain\r\nthis was undoubtedly the one with the worst fighting reputation. It\r\nwas to small profit that the Captain-General was raising yet newer\r\nand rawer battalions than those which already existed, to swell the\r\nnumbers, but not the efficiency, of his command. In July the nominal\r\ntotal of the Valencian army, including the irregulars of the ‘flying\r\ncolumn’ of the Empecinado, had been just 30,000 men. By October there\r\nwere 36,000 under arms, including the new ‘Reserve Division[2],’ whose\r\nsix battalions of recruits had only 135 officers to 6,000 men--an\r\nallowance of one officer to 45 men, not much more than half of the\r\nproportion that is necessary even among good veteran troops. But in\r\ntruth the only valuable fighting force that was present in the kingdom\r\nin September was the infantry of the two weak divisions of the old\r\nAlbuera army, under Zayas and Lardizabal, whom Blake had brought round\r\nfrom Cadiz with him, when he assumed command of the Eastern provinces.\r\nThey did not between them muster more than 6,000 bayonets, but were\r\ngood old troops, who were to distinguish themselves in the oncoming\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n  [2] ‘The Reserve Division’ consisted of a 3rd battalion from some\r\n  of the old regiments of the Valencian army, viz. 1st of Savoya,\r\n  Avila, Don Carlos, Volunteers of Castile, Cazadores de Valencia,\r\n  Orihuela. They were each about 1,000 strong, but averaged only 22\r\n  officers per battalion.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it was possible that Valencia might be able to draw a\r\nfew thousand men to her aid from the depleted army of Murcia, which\r\nhad suffered so severely at Soult’s hands during the short campaign of\r\nthe previous August[3]. But such assistance was purely problematical;\r\nif Soult should stir again from the side of Andalusia, it would be\r\nimpossible for General Mahy to bring a single Murcian battalion to the\r\nsuccour of Blake. If, by good fortune, he should not, only a fraction\r\nof Mahy’s small army would be free, since the greater part of it would\r\nbe required to watch the Andalusian frontier, and to protect the great\r\nnaval arsenal and fortress of Cartagena.\r\n\r\n  [3] See vol. iv. pp. 475-83.\r\n\r\nIf the regular troops only in eastern Spain had to be counted, it\r\nwas certain that Suchet could dispose of numbers superior to his\r\nadversaries. The gross total of the French Army of Catalonia, where\r\nGeneral Decaen had now taken Macdonald’s place, was 30,000 men. That\r\nof Suchet’s own ‘Army of Aragon’ was nearly 50,000, if garrisons,\r\nsick, and drafts on the march are reckoned in it. With these deducted,\r\nit could still supply about 31,000 men of all arms for the field.\r\nBut these were not the only resources available. On the upper Ebro,\r\nin Navarre and western Aragon, were the two newly arrived divisions\r\nof Reille and Severoli, which had entered Spain during the summer,\r\nand had hitherto had no occupation save a little hunting of Mina’s\r\nguerrilleros. These two divisions counted 15,000 fresh troops of good\r\nquality, and Suchet reckoned on their assistance to cover his rear,\r\nwhen he should begin his march on Valencia. Technically they belonged\r\nto Dorsenne’s ‘Army of the North,’ but Severoli’s Italians had been\r\npromised as a reinforcement for Aragon already, and when Suchet asked\r\nfor the grant of Reille’s division also it was not denied him. There\r\nwere 70,000 men in all to be taken into consideration when the attack\r\non Valencia was planned out.\r\n\r\nNo such force, of course, could be set aside for the actual invasion.\r\nThe reason why not half so many thousands could be utilized for the\r\nprojected stroke was that the Spanish War, as we have already had\r\nto point out on many occasions, was not a normal struggle between\r\nregular armies. The French had not only to conquer but to occupy every\r\nprovince that they overrun. Wherever an adequate garrison was not left,\r\nthe guerrilleros and miqueletes inundated the country-side, cut all\r\ncommunications, and blockaded such small detachments as had been left\r\nfar apart from the main army. Suchet’s 70,000 men had to hold down\r\nAragon and Catalonia, at the same time that they undertook the further\r\nextension of their master’s power on the Valencian side.\r\n\r\nDecaen in Catalonia had 23,000 men fit for service, not including\r\nsick and drafts on the march. Lacy’s little army was not more than\r\n8,000 strong in September: yet Suchet dared not take away a man from\r\nCatalonia. The large garrison of Barcelona, a whole division, and the\r\nsmaller garrisons of Gerona, Rosas, and Mont Louis absorbed nearly half\r\nthe effective total. The remainder were, as it turned out, not strong\r\nenough to keep the Catalans in check, much less to prosecute active\r\noffensive operations against them. It was in October, after Suchet had\r\nstarted against Valencia, that Lacy carried out the series of small\r\nsuccessful raids against Igualada, Cervera, and Montserrat, which have\r\nbeen spoken of in an earlier chapter[4]. We need not wonder, then, that\r\nnot a Frenchman was drawn from Catalonia: they were all wanted on the\r\nspot to keep a tight hold on the turbulent principality. The example\r\nof the surprise of Figueras in the last spring was sufficient to prove\r\nthe necessity of keeping every point strongly garrisoned, on pain of\r\npossible disaster.\r\n\r\n  [4] See vol. iv. pp. 540-1.\r\n\r\nAs to the Army of Aragon, it was far stronger than the Army of\r\nCatalonia, but on the other hand it had even more fortresses to\r\ngarrison. Saragossa, Tortosa, Tarragona, Lerida, were large places,\r\neach absorbing several battalions. In addition there were the smaller\r\nstrongholds of Jaca, Mequinenza, Monzon, Morella, requiring care. All\r\nthese were regular fortresses, but they did not exhaust the list of\r\npoints that must be firmly held, if the communications of Suchet’s\r\nfield-force with its distant base were to be kept free and unhampered.\r\nSouthern Aragon and the mountain-ganglion where the borders of that\r\nkingdom and of Valencia and New Castile meet, in the roughest country\r\nof the whole Spanish peninsula, had to be guarded. For in this\r\nregion lay the chosen hunting-ground of the guerrillero bands of the\r\nEmpecinado, Duran, and many other lesser chiefs: and Mina himself,\r\nfrom his usual haunts in Navarre, not unfrequently led a raid far to\r\nthe south of the Ebro. Suchet had therefore to place garrisons in\r\nTeruel, Daroca, Alcañiz, Calatayud, and Molina, none of which possessed\r\nmodern fortifications. The detachments left to hold them had to utilize\r\na large convent, a mediaeval castle, or some such post of defence, in\r\ncase they were attacked by the roving hordes of the enemy. Able to\r\nprotect themselves with ease against small parties, and to keep the\r\nroads open under ordinary circumstances, they were exposed to serious\r\ndanger if the guerrilleros should mass themselves in force against any\r\none garrison--more especially if the bands should have been lent a few\r\ncannon and gunners from the regular Spanish armies. For convents or old\r\ncastles could not resist artillery fire.\r\n\r\nTo cover his rear Suchet was forced to set aside one whole division,\r\nthat of Frère, thirteen battalions strong[5], and mustering over 7,000\r\nmen, and immense detachments of the three other French divisions of\r\nthe Army of Aragon. The units told off for the field army left no less\r\nthan 6,800 able-bodied men (besides sick and convalescents) behind\r\nthem, while they took 22,000 to the front. Frère’s division remained\r\non the side of Western Catalonia, holding Lerida and Tortosa in force,\r\nand the intermediate places with small posts. The detachments from\r\nMusnier’s, Harispe’s, and Habert’s French, and from Palombini’s Italian\r\ndivisions, took charge of Southern Aragon, leaving a company here and a\r\nbattalion there. But the Marshal selected with great care the men who\r\nwere to march on the Valencian expedition: each regiment drafted its\r\nmost effective soldiers into the marching units, and left the recruits\r\nand the old or sickly men in the garrisons. Thus the battalions used\r\nin the oncoming campaign were rather weak, averaging not much over\r\n450 men, but were composed entirely of selected veterans. The only\r\ndoubtful element taken forward was the so-called ‘Neapolitan Division’\r\nof General Compère, which was only 1,500 strong--in reality a weak\r\nbrigade--and had no great reputation. But what was left of this corps\r\nwas its best part--the numerous men who wanted to desert had already\r\ndone so, and its weaklings were dead by this time. Of his cavalry\r\nSuchet took forward almost the whole, leaving behind only two squadrons\r\nof the 4th Hussars for the service between the garrisons, and of the\r\nother regiments only the weakly men and horses[6]. Practically all his\r\nhorse and field artillery also went forward with him.\r\n\r\n  [5] Composed at this time of the 14th and 42nd and 115th Line,\r\n  and the 1st Léger, the first two and last each three battalions\r\n  strong, the other (115th) with four.\r\n\r\n  [6] The 24th Dragoons left about 140 men behind, the 13th\r\n  Cuirassiers 50 only, the Italian ‘Dragoons of Napoleon’ 124, but\r\n  the 4th Hussars about 500, much more than half their force.\r\n\r\nOf his own Army of Aragon, Suchet, as we have thus seen, left nearly\r\n14,000 men ‘present under arms’ to cover his rear. But this was not\r\nenough to make matters wholly secure, so untameable were the Aragonese\r\nand Catalans with whom he had to deal. Indeed, if this force only had\r\nbeen left to discharge the appointed task, it is clear, from subsequent\r\nhappenings, that he would have suffered a disaster during his absence\r\nin Valencia. He asked from the Emperor the loan of half Reille’s\r\ndivision from Navarre, as well as the prompt sending to the front of\r\nSeveroli’s Italians, who had been promised him as a reinforcement when\r\nfirst they entered Spain. The petition was granted, and these troops\r\nentered northern Aragon, and took charge of the places along the Ebro,\r\nwhile the expeditionary army was on its way to Valencia. Most of them\r\nwere ultimately brought forward to the siege of the great city, and\r\nwithout them neither could Aragon have been maintained nor Valencia\r\ncaptured. Practically we may say that Suchet, at his original start,\r\ntook 26,000 men to beat the Valencians and capture their city, but\r\nthat he left nearly 30,000 more behind him, to hold down the provinces\r\nalready conquered and to deal with the guerrilleros.\r\n\r\nTwo main roads lead from the north to Valencia: the one, coming from\r\nTortosa and Catalonia, hugs the coast of the Mediterranean, from which\r\nit is never more than a few miles distant. The other, far inland, and\r\nstarting from Saragossa, follows the valley of the Xiloca among the\r\nhills of Southern Aragon, crosses the watershed beyond Teruel, and\r\ndescends to the sea near Murviedro, where it joins the coast-road only\r\na few miles north of Valencia. There is a third, and much inferior,\r\nroute between these two, which starts from Mequinenza on the Lower\r\nEbro, crosses the mountainous Valencian frontier near Morella, and\r\ncomes down to the coast at Castellon de la Plana, twenty miles north of\r\nMurviedro. Of these roads the first was as good as any in Spain, and\r\nwas suitable for all manner of traffic: but it had the disadvantage\r\nof being flanked at a distance of only two miles by the small but\r\nimpregnable fortress of Peniscola, which lies on a rocky headland\r\nthirty miles beyond Tortosa, and of being absolutely blocked by the\r\nlittle town of Oropesa, twenty miles further south. Oropesa was no more\r\nthan a ruinous mediaeval place, with two castles hastily repaired,\r\nwithout any modern works: but since the road passed through it, no\r\nheavy guns or wagons starting from Tortosa could get further south till\r\nits forts had been captured.\r\n\r\nThe second road, that from Aragon by Teruel and Murviedro, is marked\r\non contemporary maps as a post-route fit for all vehicles: but it\r\npassed through a very mountainous country, and was much inferior as a\r\nline of advance to the coast-road. It was not blocked by any fortress\r\nin the hands of the Spaniards, but between Teruel and Segorbe it was\r\ncrossed by many ridges and ravines highly suitable for defence. The\r\nthird track, that by Morella, was unsuitable for wheeled traffic, and\r\ncould only be used by infantry and cavalry. Its one advantage was that\r\nMorella, its central point, had been already for some time in French\r\nhands, and contained a garrison and stores, which made it a good\r\nstarting-point for a marching column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCHET’S CAMPAIGNS 1811-12 IN VALENCIA]\r\n\r\nSuchet determined to use all three of these roads, though such a plan\r\nwould have been most hazardous against a wary and vigorous enemy: for\r\nthough they all converge in the end on the same point, Murviedro,\r\nthey are separated from each other by long stretches of mountain,\r\nand have no cross-communications. In especial, the road by Teruel\r\nwas very distant from the other two, and any isolated column taking\r\nit might find itself opposed by immensely superior forces, during\r\nthe last days of its march; since Valencia, the enemy’s base and\r\nheadquarters, where he would naturally concentrate, lies quite close to\r\nthe concluding stages of the route Teruel-Murviedro. It must have been\r\nin sheer contempt for his opponent--a contempt which turned out to be\r\njustified--that the Marshal sent a detachment of eleven battalions by\r\nthis road, for such a force of 5,000 men might have been beset by\r\nthe whole Valencian army, 30,000 strong, and the other columns could\r\nnot have helped it.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s arrangements were governed by a single fact--his siege\r\nartillery and heavy stores were parked at Tortosa, and from thence,\r\ntherefore, along the coast road, must be his main line of advance,\r\nthough it would be necessary to mask Peniscola and to capture Oropesa,\r\nbefore he could get forward to his objective--the city of Valencia.\r\nIt might have seemed rational to move the whole field army by this\r\nroute: but some of the troops destined for it were coming from distant\r\npoints, and to march them down the Ebro bank to Tortosa would have\r\ntaken much time. Moreover if the whole force concentrated there, it\r\nwould all have to be fed from the magazines at Tortosa, and those lying\r\nin Aragon would be of no use. The Marshal started himself from this\r\npoint, on September 15, with the division of Habert, and an infantry\r\nreserve formed of Robert’s brigade of the division of Musnier, together\r\nwith the whole of the cavalry and field artillery of the army. The\r\nsiege-train guarded by the other brigade of Musnier’s division--that\r\nof Ficatier--followed: but Musnier himself did not accompany the\r\nexpedition, having been left in general charge of the detachments\r\nplaced in garrison on the Ebro and in Upper Aragon. The whole column\r\nmade up about 11,000 combatants.\r\n\r\nThe second column, consisting of the two auxiliary\r\ndivisions--Palombini’s eleven Italian battalions and Compère’s 1,500\r\nNeapolitans--took (without any artillery to hamper them) the mountain\r\nroad by Alcañiz and Morella: they were slightly over 7,000 strong, and,\r\nif all went well, were destined to unite with the main body somewhere\r\nnear Oropesa or Castellon de la Plana. It was not likely that this\r\ncolumn would meet with much opposition.\r\n\r\nBut the third detachment, Harispe’s 5,000 men from Upper Aragon, who\r\nwere to take the inland and western road by Teruel, were essaying a\r\nvery dangerous task, if the enemy should prove active and enterprising,\r\nmore especially as they had no artillery and hardly any cavalry with\r\nthem. Blake might have taken the offensive with 20,000 men against\r\nthem, while still leaving something to contain--or at least to\r\nobserve--Suchet’s main column.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Commander-in-Chief, however, did nothing of the sort,\r\nand met the invasion with a tame and spiritless defensive on all its\r\npoints. When Suchet’s advance was reported, Blake had his forces in a\r\nvery scattered situation. Of the 36,000 men of whom he could nominally\r\ndispose, the Empecinado’s ‘flying column’ was as usual detached in\r\nthe mountains of Molina and Guadalajara, harassing small French\r\ngarrisons. Zayas’s division had been left far to the south at Villena,\r\nnear Alicante, to work off the contagion of yellow fever which it had\r\ncontracted while passing by Cartagena. For in that port the disease was\r\nraging terribly at the time. Obispo’s division was in the high hills on\r\nthe borders of Aragon. In the neighbourhood of Valencia were only the\r\ntroops of Lardizabal and Miranda, with the main body of the cavalry.\r\nThe Army of Murcia, which was destined to send succour if it should not\r\nfind itself beset by Soult on the other side, was lying cantoned at\r\nvarious points in that province. As the French were at this time making\r\nno demonstration from the side of Granada, it now became clear that it\r\nwould be able to send certain succours to Blake. But they were not yet\r\ndesignated for marching, much less assembled, and it was clear that\r\nthey would come up very late.\r\n\r\nThis dispersion of the available troops did not, in the end, make much\r\ndifference to the fate of the campaign, for Blake had from the first\r\nmade up his mind to accept the defensive, to draw in his outlying\r\ndetachments, and to stand at bay in the neighbourhood of Valencia,\r\nwithout attempting to make any serious resistance on the frontier.\r\nSince his arrival he had been urging on the construction of a line of\r\nearthworks, forming fortified camps, around the provincial capital.\r\nThe ancient walls of Valencia itself were incapable of any serious\r\nresistance to modern artillery, but outside them, all along the banks\r\nof the Guadalaviar river, for some miles inland to the West, and as\r\nfar as the sea on the East, batteries, _têtes-de-pont_, trenches, and\r\neven closed works of considerable size had been constructed. It was\r\nby holding them in force and with great numbers that Blake intended\r\nto check the invasion. In front of his chosen position, at a distance\r\nof twenty miles, there was a great advanced work--a newly restored\r\nfortress of crucial importance--the fastness of Saguntum, or ‘San\r\nFernando de Sagunto’ as it had just been re-christened. This was the\r\nacropolis of one of the most ancient towns of Spain, the Saguntum which\r\nhad detained Hannibal so long before its walls at the opening of the\r\nThird Punic War. In the age of the Iberians, the Carthaginians, and\r\nthe Romans, and even down to the days of the Ommeyad califs, there had\r\nbeen a large and flourishing city on this site. But in the later middle\r\nages Saguntum had declined in prosperity and population, and the modern\r\ntown--which had changed its name to Murviedro (_muri veteres_) had\r\nshrunk down to the foot of the hill. It was now a small open place of\r\n6,000 souls, quite indefensible. But above it towered the steep line of\r\nrock which had formed the citadel in ancient days: its narrow summit\r\nwas crowned with many ruins of various ages--from cyclopean foundations\r\nof walls, going back to the time of the ancient Iberians, to Moorish\r\nwatch-towers and palaces. The empty space of steep slope, from the\r\nacropolis down to the modern town, was also sprinkled with decaying\r\nwalls and substructures of all sorts, among which were cisterns and\r\nbroken roadways, besides the remains of a large Roman theatre, partly\r\nhewn out of the live rock.\r\n\r\nThere had been no fortifications by Murviedro when Suchet last\r\npassed near Valencia, in his abortive raid of March 1810[7]. On that\r\noccasion he had scaled the citadel to enjoy the view and to take a\r\ncasual survey of the picturesque ruins upon it[8]. But since then a\r\ngreat change had taken place. On the advice, as it is said, of the\r\nEnglish general, Charles Doyle[9], Blake had determined to restore the\r\ncitadel as a place of strength. This was when he last held command\r\nin Valencia, and before he joined the Cadiz Regency. But his idea\r\nhad been carried out after his departure by the Valencian Junta and\r\nthe successive Captains-General who had come after him. By means of\r\nmore than a year’s work the citadel had been made a tenable fortress,\r\nthough one of an irregular and unscientific sort. The old Iberian and\r\nMoorish walls had been repaired and run together in a new _enceinte_,\r\nwith material taken from the other ruins all around. In especial the\r\nRoman theatre, hitherto one of the most perfect in Southern Europe,\r\nhad been completely gutted, and its big blocks had proved most\r\nuseful for building the foundations of weak points of the circuit of\r\nfortification. This was strong at some points, from the toughness and\r\nheight of the old ramparts, but very sketchy at others. Where the slope\r\nwas absolutely precipitous, a rough wall of dry stone without mortar\r\nalone had been carried along the edge of the cliff. The narrow summit\r\nof the rock formed a most irregular enclosure, varying much in height\r\nfrom one point to another. It was divided into four separate sections\r\ncut off from each other by cross-walls. The westernmost and lowest,\r\nfacing the only point from which there is a comparatively gentle ascent\r\nto the summit, was crowned by a new battery called by the name of _Dos\r\nde Mayo_, to commemorate the Madrid Insurrection of 1808. Rising high\r\nin the centre of this work was an ancient bastion named the Tower of\r\nSan Pedro. Much higher, on the extreme peak of the summit, was the\r\ncitadel tower, called San Fernando, where the governor’s flag flew, and\r\nfrom whence the whole fortress could be best surveyed. From this point\r\nthe rock descended rapidly, and its long irregular eastern crest was\r\nsurrounded by weakly-repaired walls, ending in two batteries called\r\nby the names of Menacho, the gallant governor of Badajoz[10], and\r\nDoyle, the English general who had suggested the fortification of the\r\nplace. But the greater part of this eastern end of the works lay above\r\nslopes so precipitous that it seemed unlikely that they would ever be\r\nattacked. The western end, by the Dos Mayo battery, was the obvious\r\npoint of assault by an enemy who intended to use regular methods.\r\n\r\n  [7] See vol. iii. pp. 284-6.\r\n\r\n  [8] Suchet’s _Mémoires_, ii. p. 156.\r\n\r\n  [9] See Arteche, xi. p. 123.\r\n\r\n  [10] See vol. iv. p. 56.\r\n\r\nThe construction was by no means finished when Suchet’s expedition\r\nbegan: many parts of the new walls were only carried up to half their\r\nintended height, and no regular shelter for the garrison had been\r\ncontrived. Instead of proper barracks and casemates there were only\r\nrough ‘leans-to,’ contrived against old walls, or cover made by roofing\r\nin with beams old broken towers, and bastions. The hospital was the\r\nonly spacious and regular building in the whole _enceinte_: the powder\r\nmagazine was placed deep down in the cellars of the fort San Fernando.\r\nThe armament of the place was by no means complete: the guns were being\r\nsent up just as Suchet started. Only seventeen were ready, and of\r\nthese no more than three were 12-pounders: the rest were only of the\r\ncalibre of field artillery (4- and 8-pounders) or howitzers. A fortress\r\nwhich has only seventeen guns for an _enceinte_ of 3,000 yards, and\r\npossesses no heavy guns to reply to the 18- or 24-pounders of a\r\nsiege-train, is in a state of desperate danger.\r\n\r\nBlake had thrown into the place a brigade under the command of Colonel\r\nLuis Andriani, consisting of five battalions, two each of the regiments\r\nof Savoya and Don Carlos, one of the Cazadores de Orihuela. Of these\r\ntwo were new ‘third battalions[11]’ from the recently raised ‘Division\r\nof Reserve,’ incomplete in officers, only half drilled, and not yet\r\nfully provided with uniforms. The total force came to 2,663 officers\r\nand men, including about 150 artillerymen and sappers. It is probable\r\nthat these troops would have made no better show in the open field\r\nthan did the rest of the Valencian army, a few weeks later: but they\r\nshowed behind walls the same capacity for unexpected resistance which\r\nhad surprised the French on other occasions at Ciudad Rodrigo, Gerona,\r\nand Figueras. Andriani, the governor, seems to have made an honourable\r\nattempt to do his duty at the head of the doubtfully efficient garrison\r\nplaced at his disposal.\r\n\r\n  [11] The battalions were the 2nd and 3rd of Savoya (the last a\r\n  new levy) the 1st and 2nd of Don Carlos, and the 3rd of Orihuela,\r\n  this last raw and newly raised like the 3rd of Savoya.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Saguntum Blake held two outlying posts in his front,\r\nPeniscola on its lofty headland, garrisoned by about 1,000 men under\r\nGeneral Garcia Navarro, and the half-ruined Oropesa, which he had\r\nresolved to hold, because it blocked the sea-coast road so effectively.\r\nBut its only tenable points were two mediaeval towers, one in the town\r\ncommanding the high-road, the other by the shore of the Mediterranean.\r\nTheir joint garrisons did not amount to 500 men, and it was obvious\r\nthat they could not hold out many days against modern artillery. But\r\nthe gain of a day or two might conceivably be very valuable in the\r\ncampaign that was about to begin. It is clear, however, that his main\r\nhope of resistance lay in the line of entrenched camps and batteries\r\nalong the Guadalaviar, in front of Valencia: here he intended to make\r\nhis real stand, and he hoped that Saguntum, so little distant from\r\nthis line, would prove a serious hindrance to the enemy when he came up\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s three columns all started, as Napoleon had ordered, on\r\nSeptember 15th. The Marshal’s own main body, coming from Tortosa,\r\nreached Benicarlo, the first town across the Valencian frontier, next\r\nday, and on the 17th came level with Peniscola, whose garrison kept\r\nquiet within the limits of its isthmus. The Marshal left a battalion\r\nand a few hussars to observe it, and to see that it did not make\r\nsallies against his line of communication. On the 19th the head of\r\nthe marching column reached Torreblanca, quite close to Oropesa. A\r\nreconnaissance found that the place was held, and came into contact\r\nwith some Spanish horse, who were easily driven off. This was the first\r\ntouch with Blake’s field army that had been obtained. But the enemy was\r\nevidently not in force, and the garrison of Oropesa hastily retired\r\ninto the two towers which formed its only tenable positions. On a close\r\ninspection it was found that the tower in the town completely commanded\r\nthe high-road, wherefore the Marshal took a slight circuit by suburban\r\nlanes round the place, with his main body and guns, and continued his\r\nadvance, after leaving a few companies to blockade the towers. On\r\nthe same evening he was joined by Palombini’s column from Morella,\r\nconsisting of the two Italian divisions. They had accomplished their\r\nmarch without meeting any resistance, though the road from Morella by\r\nSan Matteo and Cabanes was rough and easily defensible. The united\r\nforce, now 16,000 strong, proceeded on its march next day, and the\r\nMarshal was agreeably surprised when, on the morning of the 20th, the\r\ncavalry scouts on his right flank announced to him that they had come\r\nin touch with Harispe’s column from Teruel, which had appeared at the\r\nvillage of Villafanes a few miles from the main road. Thus the whole\r\narmy of invasion was happily united.\r\n\r\nHarispe, as it turned out, had left Teruel on the 15th, in obedience to\r\nhis orders, by the post-road to Segorbe and the coast. But hearing on\r\nthe second day that a large Valencian force was holding the defile of\r\nLas Barracas, where the road crosses the watershed, he had turned off\r\nby a bad side-path to Ruvielos in the upper valley of the Mijares, in\r\nthe hope of joining his chief without being forced to storm a difficult\r\nposition. Blake, as a matter of fact, much alarmed at the approach of\r\na flanking column on the Teruel side, and ignorant of its strength,\r\nhad sent the division of Obispo and some other detachments to hold the\r\npass. But no enemy came this way--Harispe had diverged down the course\r\nof the Villahermosa river, by a country road only practicable for a\r\nforce without guns or wheeled transport, and got down by rapid marches\r\nto the coast-plain beyond Alcora, without having seen any enemy save\r\nsome scattered guerrillero bands. He had thoroughly distracted Blake’s\r\nattention and had run no danger, because he took an unexpected and\r\ndifficult route, in a direction quite different from that by which the\r\nSpaniards expected him to appear[12].\r\n\r\n  [12] Vacani says that the Teruel column was intended by Suchet\r\n  as a mere demonstration, and was never intended to follow the\r\n  high-road Teruel-Segorbe, but to take a cross-route over the\r\n  hills, such as was actually used by it. But Suchet, in his\r\n  _Mémoires_, makes no such statement (ii. p. 152), and speaks as\r\n  if Harispe had taken the Ruvielos route on his own responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe whole army was now concentrated near Villafanes on September 21,\r\nsave the detachments left to block Peniscola and Oropesa, and the\r\nbrigade of Ficatier, which, escorting the siege-train, had been left\r\nat Tortosa, to await orders for starting when there should be no enemy\r\nleft in northern Valencia to molest it. The heavy guns were to come\r\nforward down the coast-road, first to breach the towers of Oropesa, and\r\nwhen the way past them was clear, to play their part, if necessary, in\r\nthe more serious task of battering Saguntum.\r\n\r\nOn advancing from Castellon de la Plana on September 22 the French army\r\nfound a very small Spanish rearguard--500 or 600 men--covering the\r\nbridge of Villareal over the Mijares. They gave way before the first\r\nattack, which was a very simple affair, since the river was nearly dry\r\nand everywhere fordable. No more was seen of the enemy next day, and\r\non the 23rd Suchet found himself on the banks of the Palancia stream,\r\nwhich flows under the foot of the rock of Saguntum. The Spaniards had\r\nretired still further towards Valencia, leaving the fortress to its\r\nown resources. These were unknown to Suchet, who was aware that the\r\nruinous citadel had been rebuilt, but could not tell without further\r\nreconnaissance what was its strength. In order to invest the place, and\r\nto make closer investigation possible, Harispe’s division crossed the\r\nPalancia to the right of Saguntum, Habert’s to the left. The latter\r\nsent six companies into the town of Murviedro, and drove up some\r\nSpanish pickets from it into the fortress which towered above. The\r\ntwo divisions then joined hands to the south of Saguntum, completing\r\nits investment, while Palombini’s Italians took post at Petres and\r\nGillet on the road to Segorbe--to the north-west--in case Blake might\r\nhave placed some of his troops on this side-route, with the object of\r\ntroubling the siege by attacks from the rear. The cavalry went forward\r\ndown the high-road to Valencia, and sent back news that they had\r\nexplored as far as Albalete, only six miles from the capital, and had\r\nmet no enemy. The division of Lardizabal and the cavalry of San Juan,\r\nwhich had been the observing force in front of Suchet, had retired\r\nbeyond the Guadalaviar river, and had shut themselves up (along with\r\nthe rest of Blake’s army) in the entrenchments behind that stream. The\r\nSpanish general was evidently acting on the strictest principles of\r\npassive defence.\r\n\r\nThe French marshal determined not to seek his enemy on his chosen\r\nground, till he should have taken Saguntum and brought up his\r\nsiege-train to the front. The former condition he thought would not\r\nprove difficult to accomplish. A survey of the fortress revealed\r\nits extremely irregular and incomplete state of defence. Though the\r\ncliffs were in all parts steep and in some places inaccessible, many\r\nsections of the works above them were obviously unfinished and very\r\nweak. After a close reconnaissance by his engineer officers had been\r\nmade, Suchet determined that it would be worth while to try an attempt\r\nat escalade on some of the most defective points, without waiting for\r\nthe arrival of the siege-train. He set his sappers and carpenters to\r\nwork to make sixty ladders, which were ready in full number on the\r\nthird day. The front chosen for the assault was in the _enceinte_\r\nimmediately overhanging the town of Murviedro, where two ancient gaps\r\nin the wall were clearly visible; the new work was not half finished,\r\nand a low structure, roughly completed with beams laid above the\r\nregular foundations, was all that blocked the openings. The masons of\r\nthe garrison were heard at night, working hard to raise the height of\r\nthe stone wall which was to replace the temporary wooden parapets.\r\nThere being no artillery available, they could not be hindered in their\r\nbuilding: but it did not seem to advance very rapidly.\r\n\r\nSuchet set apart for the actual escalade two columns, each composed of\r\n300 volunteers from Habert’s division: they were to be supported by a\r\nreserve of similar strength under Colonel Gudin, which was formed up,\r\ncompletely under cover, within the streets of Murviedro. At midnight\r\non September 27th-28th the stormers pushed forward under cover of the\r\ndarkness, and in small successive parties, into a large Roman cistern\r\nabove the ruined theatre, which was ‘dead ground,’ and not exposed to\r\nfire from any part of the ramparts. Here they were only 120 yards from\r\nthe two breaches. Meanwhile, as a diversion, six Italian companies from\r\nPalombini’s division were ordered to make a noisy demonstration against\r\nthe distant part of the defences which lay under the tower of San\r\nPedro[13]. General Habert was to have 2,000 men more under arms, ready\r\nto support the assailing column.\r\n\r\n  [13] The complete orders for the attack may be read in the first\r\n  _Pièce justificative_ in Belmas’s history of the siege, pp.\r\n  115-17 of vol. iv of his elaborate work.\r\n\r\nThe stormers reached their appointed place apparently undiscovered,\r\nand the attack would have been delivered--according to Suchet’s\r\ndispatch--without any preliminary firing, but for an accident. The\r\nMarshal says that the Spaniards had pushed an exploring patrol down the\r\nhillside, which fell in with the French pickets and drew their fire.\r\nThereupon the assaulting columns in the cistern, thinking themselves\r\ndiscovered, let off a few shots and charged uphill, a little ahead of\r\nthe appointed time, and before the Italian demonstration had begun[14].\r\nThe governor, Andriani, in his dispatch, makes no mention of this, but\r\nmerely says that about 2 a.m. his sentinels thought that they detected\r\nmovements on the slopes, and that a short time afterwards a fierce\r\nattack was delivered. At any rate the garrison was not surprised as\r\nSuchet had hoped.\r\n\r\n  [14] Vacani (v. p. 381) contradicts Suchet, saying that there\r\n  was no Spanish patrol, and that the French pickets fired from\r\n  nervousness at an imaginary foe.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lowness, however, of the walls blocking the two old\r\nbreaches, the assailants had, in their first rush, a fair chance of\r\nbreaking in. Many ladders were successfully planted, and repeatedly\r\nsmall parties of the French got a footing on the wooden parapets. If\r\nthe garrison had flinched, the storm might have succeeded: but far\r\nfrom flinching, they offered a desperate resistance, overthrew the\r\nladders, slew all who had gained the top of the _enceinte_, and kept\r\nup a furious musketry fire, which laid low many of the soldiers who\r\nkept pressing forward to the breaches. It was to no purpose that the\r\ndemonstration by the Italians below San Pedro now began: the Spaniards\r\nfired hard and fast in this direction also, but did not withdraw any\r\nmen from the real point of attack, where they maintained themselves\r\nvery courageously. It was in vain that Colonel Gudin brought up his\r\nreserve: it could make no head, and the survivors threw themselves down\r\namong the rocks and ruins in front of the wall--unwilling to recede,\r\nbut quite unable to advance. Seeing his attack a hopeless failure,\r\nSuchet ordered the stormers back just before daylight began to appear.\r\nThey had lost 247 killed and wounded out of 900 men engaged: the\r\ngarrison only 15 killed and less than 30 wounded[15].\r\n\r\n  [15] Vacani makes the losses 360 instead of 247, and it is\r\n  possible that Suchet has given only the casualties at the main\r\n  assault, and not those in the distant demonstrations. Vacani says\r\n  that the Italians lost 52 men in their false attack.\r\n\r\nThe escalade having come to this disappointing conclusion, the Marshal\r\nsaw that the siege of Saguntum would be anything but a quick business.\r\nIt would be necessary to bring up the siege-train to the front: orders\r\nwere sent back to Ficatier to start it at once from Tortosa; but it had\r\nto batter and take Oropesa before it could even reach Murviedro. There\r\nwere some weeks of delay before him, and meanwhile Blake might at last\r\nbegin to show some signs of life. Suchet therefore disposed his army so\r\nas to provide both a blockading force and a covering force, to see that\r\nthe blockade was not interfered with from without. It being evident\r\nthat many days would elapse before the siege artillery arrived, the\r\nFrench engineer officers got leave to employ many detachments in\r\npreparing roads fit to bear heavy guns up the western slopes of the\r\nhill of Saguntum, from which alone the regular attack on the fortress\r\ncould be conducted. Several emplacements for batteries were also\r\nchosen, and work upon them was begun.\r\n\r\nFrom September 23rd, the day of Suchet’s arrival before Saguntum,\r\ndown to October 16, when the heavy guns at last arrived, the French\r\narmy was practically ‘marking time’: the idea which the Emperor had\r\nconceived, and which his lieutenant had adopted, that Valencia could be\r\nconquered by a sudden rush, had been proved false. Apparently Suchet\r\nhad gained no more by his rapid advance to the foot of the hill of\r\nSaguntum than he would have obtained by marching in more leisurely\r\nfashion, with his siege artillery in company, and taking Oropesa on the\r\nway. The reduction of that place indeed was (as it turned out) only a\r\nsingle day’s task for heavy guns: and if the Marshal had captured it\r\non his march, he might have presented himself before Saguntum with his\r\nsiege-train, and have begun an active attack on that fortress, some\r\nweeks before he was actually able to get to serious work. In fact he\r\nmight have been battering Saguntum on October 1, instead of having to\r\nwait till October 16th. But this is ‘wisdom after the event’: Napoleon\r\nthought that Valencia could be ‘rushed,’ and Suchet was bound to make\r\nthe experiment that his master ordered.\r\n\r\nBlake meanwhile, finding, on September 23rd, that the enemy was not\r\nabout to advance against his lines, and learning soon after that the\r\nFrench army had settled down before Saguntum, had to revise his plans,\r\nsince it was clear that he was not to be attacked in his entrenchments\r\nas he had supposed. Three courses were now open to him: either he might\r\ncollect every man for a decisive battle in the open, and try to raise\r\nthe siege; or he might attempt to open up attacks on Suchet’s line of\r\ncommunications and on his base in Aragon, so as to force him to retire\r\nby indirect operations; or he might remain passive behind the lines of\r\nthe Guadalaviar. The last was an almost unthinkable alternative--it\r\nwould have ruined his reputation for ever to sit quiet and do nothing,\r\nas Wellington had done during the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1810.\r\nOnly a general with an established reputation for courage and ability\r\ncould have dared to take such a course; and Blake’s record was a long\r\nseries of disasters, while he was detested by the Valencians one and\r\nall--by the army, to whom he rightly preferred his own excellent\r\ntroops, no less than by the Captain-General Palacios, and the Junta,\r\nwhom he had sent out of the city to sit at Alcira, when they showed a\r\ntendency to hamper his operations. Practically he was forced by his\r\nsituation to take some definite offensive move against Suchet.\r\n\r\nHe chose that of indirect operations, having a well-rooted distrust\r\nof the fighting powers of a great part of the troops that were at\r\nhis disposition. The record of the Valencian army he knew: the state\r\nof the Murcian army, on which he could draw for reinforcements, was\r\nrepresented to him in the most gloomy colours by Mahy, who had recently\r\nreplaced Freire in command. On September 12th Mahy had written to him,\r\nto warn him that the spirit of his troops was detestable: ‘the Army of\r\nMurcia was little better than a phantom: there were only four or five\r\nofficers for whom the rank and file had any respect or esteem, the\r\nrest were regarded as timid or incapable: the men had no confidence in\r\nthemselves or their chiefs. The best thing to do would be to break up\r\nthe whole army, and incorporate it into the “Expeditionary Divisions,”\r\nwhose commanders were known as good soldiers, and whose battalions were\r\ntrustworthy[16].’\r\n\r\n  [16] See Mahy’s letter to Blake on pp. 109-12 of vol. xi of\r\n  Arteche. The General is writing very carefully so as not to speak\r\n  too ill of his army: but his views are clear.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts Blake resolved to threaten Suchet’s flanks with\r\ndemonstrations, which he had no intention of turning into attacks, but\r\nto endeavour to dislodge him from his forward position by turning loose\r\nthe guerrilleros of Aragon on to his rear. With the former purpose he\r\nsent out two detachments from the Valencian lines, Obispo’s division\r\nto Segorbe,--where it cut the French communication with Teruel and\r\nsouthern Aragon,--Charles O’Donnell with Villacampa’s infantry and San\r\nJuan’s horse to Benaguacil, a point in the plains fifteen miles west\r\nof Saguntum, where his force formed a link between Obispo and the main\r\nbody of the Valencian army, which still remained entrenched in the\r\nlines of the Guadalaviar[17]. These two detachments threatened Suchet’s\r\nflank, and even his rear, but there was no intention of turning the\r\nthreat into a reality.\r\n\r\n  [17] Blake kept under his own hand in the lines the divisions of\r\n  Zayas, Lardizabal, Miranda, and the Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe real movement on which Blake relied for the discomfiture of the\r\ninvaders of Valencia was that of the guerrillero bands of Aragon and\r\nthe neighbouring parts of Castile, to whom he had appealed for help\r\nthe moment that Suchet commenced his march. He believed that the 6,000\r\nor 7,000 men which Suchet had left scattered in small garrisons under\r\nGeneral Musnier might be so beset and worried by the _partidas_, that\r\nthe Marshal might be compelled to turn back to their aid. Even Mina\r\nfrom his distant haunts in Navarre had been asked to co-operate. This\r\nwas an excellent move, and might have succeeded, if Musnier alone\r\nhad remained to hold down Aragon. But Blake had forgotten in his\r\ncalculations the 15,000 men of Reille and Severoli, cantoned in Navarre\r\nand along the Upper Ebro, who were available to strengthen the small\r\nforce which lay in the garrisons under Musnier’s charge.\r\n\r\nThe diversion of the guerrilleros, however, was effected with\r\nconsiderable energy. On September 26th the Empecinado and Duran\r\nappeared in front of Calatayud, the most important of the French\r\ngarrisons in the mountains of western Aragon. They had with them 5,000\r\nfoot and 500 horse--not their full strength, for a large band of the\r\nEmpecinado’s men beset at the same time the remote castle of Molina,\r\nthe most outlying and isolated of all Suchet’s posts. Calatayud was\r\nheld by a few companies of French, to which an Italian flying column of\r\na battalion had just joined itself. The guerrilleros, coming in with a\r\nrush, drove the garrison out of the town into their fortified post, the\r\nlarge convent of La Merced, taking many prisoners in the streets. Duran\r\nthen beleaguered the main body in the convent, while the Empecinado\r\ntook post at the defile of El Frasno on the Saragossa road, to hold off\r\nany succour that Musnier might send up from the Aragonese capital. This\r\nprecaution was justified--a column of 1,000 men came out of Saragossa,\r\nbut was far too weak to force the pass and had to retire, with the\r\nloss of its commander, Colonel Gillot, and many men. Meanwhile Duran\r\npressed the besieged in the convent with mines, having no artillery of\r\nsufficient calibre to batter its walls. After blowing down a corner\r\nof its chapel with one mine, and killing many of the defenders, the\r\nguerrillero chief exploded a second on October 3, which made such a\r\nvast breach that the garrison surrendered, still 560 strong, on the\r\nfollowing day[18].\r\n\r\n  [18] Vacani gives a long and interesting account of the siege (v.\r\n  pp. 404-13) and attributes the weak defence to quarrels between\r\n  the commander of the Italians and the French governor, Müller.\r\n\r\nThis success would have gone far to shake the hold of the French\r\non Aragon, but for the intervention of Reille from Navarre. At the\r\nfirst news of the blockade of Calatayud, he had dispatched a column,\r\nconsisting of the whole brigade of Bourke, 3,500 strong, which would\r\nhave saved the garrison if it had had a less distance to march. But it\r\narrived on the 5th to find the convent blown up, while the Spaniards\r\nhad vanished with their prisoners. Bourke thereupon returned to Tudela,\r\nand the guerrilleros reoccupied Calatayud on his departure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the whole Italian division of Severoli, over\r\n7,000 strong, marched down the Ebro to reinforce the small garrison\r\nof Saragossa. This large reinforcement restored the confidence of\r\nthe French. Musnier himself took charge of it and marched at its\r\nhead against Duran and the Empecinado. They wisely refused to fight,\r\ngave way, evacuated Calatayud, and took refuge in the hills (October\r\n12). While the main field-force of the enemy was drawn off in this\r\ndirection, Mina took up the game on the other side of the Ebro.\r\nEntering Aragon with 4,000 men he besieged the small garrison of Exea,\r\nwhich abandoned its post, and cut its way through the guerrilleros,\r\ntill it met a column of 800 Italian infantry[19] sent out from\r\nSaragossa to bring it off. Colonel Ceccopieri, the leader of this\r\nsmall force, underrating the strength of his enemy, then marched to\r\nrelieve the garrison of Ayerbe. He was surprised on the way by Mina’s\r\nwhole force, and in a long running fight between Ayerbe and Huesca was\r\nsurrounded and slain. The column was exterminated, two hundred Italians\r\nwere killed, six hundred (including many wounded) were taken prisoners\r\n(October 16th).\r\n\r\n  [19] Belonging to the 7th Line of Severoli’s division.\r\n\r\nMusnier returned in haste from Calatayud at the news of this disaster,\r\nbut left the bulk of Severoli’s division to occupy western Aragon.\r\nHe then set himself, with the help of Reille, to hunt down Mina. But\r\nthe latter, marching with ease between the columns that pursued him,\r\nfor the peasantry kept him informed day by day of every movement of\r\nthe enemy, retreated westward. Easily eluding the French, he made an\r\nextraordinary excursion, right across Navarre, Alava, and Biscay, down\r\nto the sea coast at Motrico, where he handed over his prisoners to\r\nthe captain of the British frigate _Isis_, and then returned unharmed\r\nto his familiar haunts. Of such a delusive nature was the hold of the\r\nFrench on Northern Spain, that a column of 5,000 men could march for\r\n200 miles across it without being intercepted or destroyed.\r\n\r\nAll these exploits of the guerrilleros were daring and well planned,\r\nbut though they had given Musnier much trouble, and cost the French\r\nmany a weary hour of march and countermarch, they had not cleared\r\nAragon of the enemy, nor shaken Suchet’s position. Indeed, on October\r\n20, the general condition of affairs in Aragon was more favourable for\r\nthe invaders than on September 20, for two fresh divisions had been\r\ndrawn down into that province, and there were 20,000 French and Italian\r\ntroops in it instead of 6,000. The petty disasters at Calatayud and\r\nAyerbe were irritating rather than important. Suchet never for a moment\r\nfelt inclined to relax his hold upon Valencia: that western Aragon was\r\nin an uproar affected him little, when his communication with his two\r\nmain dépôts of stores at Tortosa and Morella was not interrupted.\r\n\r\nBlake, it may be mentioned, did not content himself with setting the\r\nEmpecinado and Duran in motion, he tried another division in another\r\nquarter with even less result. Rumours had reached him that King\r\nJoseph’s Army of the Centre was about to co-operate with Suchet, by\r\nsending a column across the mountains to Cuenca and Requeña. The news\r\nwas false, for though Napoleon had ordered the King to do what he\r\ncould to help in the invasion of Valencia, Joseph had replied that\r\nhe had not even one brigade to spare for a serious demonstration,\r\nand had not moved--the guerrilleros gave sufficient occupation to\r\nhis much-scattered army, of which a large portion was composed of\r\nuntrustworthy Spanish _Juramentados_. But, listening to vain reports,\r\nBlake ordered Mahy to collect the best of his Murcian troops and\r\nto march on Cuenca to meet the supposed invaders. His subordinate,\r\nleaving Freire in command in Murcia, took seven selected battalions\r\nof foot under Creagh and the Marquis of Montijo, with 800 horse and\r\none battery, and moved from his camp at Mula by Hellin and Chinchilla\r\nnorthward. The distance to be covered was great, the roads after\r\nChinchilla very bad. Mahy arrived in front of Cuenca on October 15th,\r\nto find that there was only one battalion and two squadrons of Joseph’s\r\narmy there. This little force evacuated the high-lying city in haste,\r\nand fled towards Madrid the moment that the Murcians showed themselves.\r\nNo other French force could be heard of in any direction. At Cuenca\r\nMahy received a dispatch from Blake (who had apparently discovered his\r\nmistake about the Army of the Centre), telling him to descend from the\r\nmountains by Moya and Liria, and to join the wing of the main army,\r\nwhich lay under Obispo at Segorbe. It was only on the 23rd October\r\nthat he came in: his troops, the pick of the Murcian army, had been\r\ncompletely wasted for some twenty days in a circular march against a\r\nnon-existent enemy. Meanwhile every man had been wanted in Valencia.\r\n\r\nSuchet, when once he had settled down to the siege of Saguntum, had\r\nnot failed to notice Blake’s weak demonstration against his flank by\r\nmeans of the divisions of Obispo and Charles O’Donnell. He did not\r\nintend to tolerate it, and on September 30 had sent Palombini with his\r\nown Italian division and Robert’s French brigade to beat up Obispo’s\r\nquarters at Segorbe. The Spanish division made a poor attempt to defend\r\nitself on a position in front of that town, but was easily beaten and\r\nretired into the mountains. It was then the turn of Charles O’Donnell;\r\nwhen Palombini had come back to the camp, Suchet took Harispe’s\r\ndivision, with Robert’s brigade, and two regiments of cavalry, to evict\r\nthe Spanish division from Benaguacil. O’Donnell made a slightly better\r\nfight than Obispo had done, and deployed Villacampa’s infantry behind\r\nan irrigation canal, with San Juan’s cavalry on his flanks. But the\r\nFrench were superior in numbers as well as in confidence: one fierce\r\ncharge broke O’Donnell’s line, and he had to retreat in haste to the\r\nhills behind him, losing 400 men, cut up in the pursuit by Suchet’s\r\ncavalry, while the French casualties barely reached three officers and\r\nsixty men (October 2nd). Blake, who had been quite close enough to\r\nsuccour O’Donnell if he had chosen, made no attempt to aid him, and\r\nkept quiet behind his lines on the Guadalaviar. There the routed troops\r\njoined him next day.\r\n\r\nSuchet, having thus cleared his flanks, settled down to the siege\r\nof Saguntum, where his heavy artillery was now much needed. The\r\nbesieging army had to content itself for another fortnight with making\r\npreparations for the expected train--levelling roads and constructing\r\napproaches on the ground which was destined for the front of attack, at\r\nthe west end of the hill of Saguntum.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the siege-train was lumbering down from Tortosa by the\r\ncoast-road. On October 6th Suchet started to meet it, taking with him\r\nthe 1,500 Neapolitans of Compère. On the 8th he reached Oropesa, where\r\nhe found the small Spanish garrison still holding the two towers which\r\nhave before been mentioned. The first guns that came up were turned\r\nagainst the tower by the high-road; it was easily breached, and on\r\nthe 10th surrendered: 215 men and four guns were captured. Next day\r\ncame the turn of the other tower, that by the sea; but before the\r\nsiege-battery had opened on it, the British 74 _Magnificent_ and a\r\nsquadron of Spanish gunboats ran inshore, and took off the garrison of\r\n150 men in their boats, under the ineffective fire of the French.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the tower which blocked the high-road had fallen, and\r\nbefore that on the shore had been evacuated, Suchet began to push the\r\nhead of his precious convoy of heavy artillery southward. It made such\r\na good pace that the first guns arrived at the camp before Saguntum\r\nas early as the night of October 12th. Meanwhile the Marshal himself\r\nreturned thither, escorted by Compère’s Neapolitans: the brigade of\r\nFicatier, which had escorted the train hitherto, was dispersed to cover\r\nthe line of communications, placing its five battalions at Oropesa,\r\nAlmenara, and Segorbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF SAGUNTUM. OCTOBER 1811\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Charles O’Donnell and Obispo had been driven away from the\r\nthreatening position upon Suchet’s flank, Blake found himself during\r\nthe early days of October in a very unpleasant dilemma. It was\r\nclear that his own feeble efforts to molest the French army were\r\na complete failure. Presently the message reached him that Mahy’s\r\nunlucky expedition to Cuenca had been absolutely useless. But the most\r\ndisheartening news was that the attempt to overrun Aragon by means\r\nof the guerrilleros had failed; its initial success, the capture of\r\nCalatayud on October 3, had only led to the inundation of the whole\r\ncountryside in that direction by the numerous battalions of Reille and\r\nSeveroli.\r\n\r\nAs the days wore on, Blake found himself obliged to confess that the\r\nidea of dislodging Suchet by operations in his rear was hopeless. The\r\nonly remaining alternative for him was to endeavour to call together\r\nevery available man, and to try to beat the French army in a great\r\npitched battle. Considering the well-known disrepute of both the\r\nMurcian and the Valencian troops, the prospect was not one that the\r\nSpanish general could view with much confidence. But political reasons\r\nforced him to fight--his policy of passive resistance had made him so\r\nunpopular with the Valencians of all ranks, from the members of the\r\nexiled Junta down to the private soldiers, that if he had held back any\r\nlonger it is probable that he might have been deposed or murdered by a\r\nconspiracy. Saguntum was holding out most gallantly, and the ignominy\r\nof leaving it to fall, without making any effort for its succour, was\r\nsufficiently evident. He made up his mind about the middle of October\r\nthat he must advance and fight. But, being very properly determined\r\nto fight with all available resources, he had to await the descent of\r\nMahy and the Murcians from Cuenca, and by his own fault that important\r\ncolumn could not be drawn in to the main army before the 23rd. It was\r\nonly on that day that an advance in force became possible: for a week\r\nand more Blake anxiously awaited the junction, and until it took place\r\nhe would not move.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Suchet, entirely unmolested, was pressing the siege of\r\nSaguntum with all possible expedition. The first siege-guns from\r\nTortosa reached his camp, as has been already mentioned, on October\r\n12th. But it was not till four days later that the actual battering\r\nof the place began. Though paths had been traced out, and the\r\nemplacements of batteries settled, long ere the siege-train came up,\r\nthe actual getting of the guns into position proved a very tiresome\r\nbusiness, on account of the steep and rocky slopes over which they\r\nhad to be dragged. And the construction of approaches and parallels\r\nupon the hillside progressed very slowly, because of the absence of\r\nearth--at last it was found that soil to bind the loose stones of\r\nthe ground together would have, for the most part, to be carried up\r\nin sandbags from the valley below, for hardly any could be scraped\r\ntogether on the spot. The engineer officer who wrote the diary of the\r\nsiege confesses that if the Spanish garrison had only been provided\r\nwith heavy artillery, the approach-building would have proved almost\r\nimpossible[20]. But, as has been already noted, there were but\r\nseventeen guns mounted in the whole fortress, and of these only three\r\nwere 12-pounders--the rest being small field-pieces, too weak to batter\r\ndown parapets of even modest thickness. Moreover the very steepness of\r\nthe slope over which the siege-works were being advanced made much of\r\nit ‘dead ground,’ which guns above could not properly sweep or search\r\nout.\r\n\r\n  [20] Belmas, iv. p. 97.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of October the two generals, Vallée and Rogniat, who\r\nhad regularly commanded Suchet’s artillery and engineers during his\r\nprevious sieges, arrived from the rear--both had been in France on\r\nleave, and they had come forward with the train from Tortosa to\r\nOropesa. Their arrival added confidence to the subordinates who had\r\nhitherto worked without them, for the reputation of each for success\r\nwas very great. Rogniat immediately on his arrival made several\r\nimportant modifications in the projected batteries, and showed how\r\nthe approaches might be pushed forward to within seventy yards of the\r\nfortress, by taking advantage of favourable dips and rocky outcrops in\r\nthe hillside.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, five batteries were armed with the guns which had come up,\r\nand fire was opened upon the projecting western angle of the fortress,\r\nthe tower of San Pedro. It proved to be made of ancient Moorish stone\r\nand mortar, almost as hard as iron, and crumbled very slowly. But the\r\nmodern works below it, which were only a few months old, owned no such\r\nresisting power, and within two days showed signs of serious damage.\r\nThe Spanish counter-fire was insignificant--there were very few guns\r\navailable, and it was only when the approaches got within easy musket\r\nshot of the walls that the besiegers began to suffer appreciable\r\ncasualties. For the Spanish infantry, disregarding the cannonade, kept\r\nup a furious fire against the heads of the saps all day and night.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 18th the engineer and artillery officers\r\nreported to Suchet that they had made a sufficient breach in the\r\ncurtain of the work called the Dos Mayo battery, just where it joined\r\non the tower of San Pedro, and that they regarded it as practicable\r\nfor assault. The Marshal ordered that the storm should be fixed for\r\nthe same evening, lest the Spaniards should succeed in repairing the\r\nbreach during the hours of darkness. The column of assault consisted\r\nof 400 men, picked from Habert’s division, supported by a reserve of\r\nPalombini’s Italians. The fire of the siege artillery was kept up to\r\nthe last moment, and did much harm to the garrison, who were very\r\nclearly seen piling gabions, sandbags, and stones on the ruinous lip of\r\nthe breach, in disregard of the steady fire that kept pounding it down\r\n[21].\r\n\r\n  [21] See narrative of Vacani, an eye-witness (vol. v. p. 399).\r\n\r\nThe assault was duly delivered at five o’clock, and proved a complete\r\nfailure. The stormers found the breach most difficult to climb, as\r\nits face was entirely formed of big blocks of stone without earth\r\nor débris. The column won its way half up the ascent, and isolated\r\nofficers and men got further, and were bayoneted or shot at close\r\nquarters by the defenders, who clustered very thickly at the top. But\r\nno general rush of men could reach the summit, where (it is said) the\r\nactual gap in the parapet was not more than six or seven feet broad.\r\nAfter several ineffective attempts to mount, the assailants came to\r\na stand on the lower part of the slope, and opened a scattering fire\r\non the Spaniards above them. Whereupon, seeing the opportunity lost,\r\nGeneral Habert, who had been given charge of the operations, ordered\r\nthe men to fall back to the trenches, and to abandon the assault.\r\n\r\nThis was a most creditable feat of arms for the garrison, who had\r\nhardly a cannon to help them, and held their own almost entirely by\r\nmusketry fire, though they rolled some live shells, beams, and large\r\nstones down the breach at intervals. Their casualties were heavy, but\r\nthose of the assailants, as was natural, much greater. Suchet lost at\r\nleast 300 men, though in his dispatch to the Emperor[22] he gave an\r\nelaborate table of casualties showing a total of only 173. But his\r\n‘returns,’ even the most specious looking of them, should never be\r\ntrusted--as will be seen when we are dealing with the second battle of\r\nCastalla in a later volume. This excellent officer was as untrustworthy\r\nas Soult or Masséna in the figures which he sent to his master[23].\r\n\r\n  [22] To be found in print in Belmas, iv. pp. 124-8.\r\n\r\n  [23] This indictment of Suchet must be supported by details. In\r\n  his elaborate table of casualties by corps at the end of his\r\n  dispatch of Oct. 20, he only allows for 3 officers killed and\r\n  8 wounded, 40 men killed and 122 wounded--total 173. But the\r\n  lists of officers’ casualties in Martinien show, on the other\r\n  hand, _five_ officers killed (Coutanceau, Saint Hilaire, Turno,\r\n  Giardini, Cuny), and at least _ten_ wounded (Mathis, Durand,\r\n  Gauchet, D’Autane, Adhémar, Gattinara, Lamezan, D’Esclaibes,\r\n  Maillard, Laplane), and probably three more.\r\n\r\n  Oddly enough, in his _Mémoires_ (ii. p. 173) Suchet gives _by\r\n  name_ four officers killed at the breach (out of the five), while\r\n  in his official report he had stated that there were only three\r\n  killed altogether. We must trust rather Vacani, an eye-witness\r\n  and a man much interested in statistics and casualties, when he\r\n  gives the total of 300 for the losses, than Suchet’s table.\r\n\r\nAfter this Suchet resolved to make no more attempts to storm Saguntum.\r\n‘When even the best of soldiers,’ remarks Belmas, ‘have made every\r\neffort to carry a place and have failed, they imagine that the place\r\nis impregnable. And if an attempt is made to lead them once more to an\r\nassault, they will not again act with the confidence which is needed\r\nto secure victory.’ Wellington was to find this out at Burgos, a year\r\nlater. Indeed in their early stages the sieges of Saguntum and Burgos\r\nshow a rather notable parallelism, though their ends were dissimilar.\r\nGeneral Rogniat easily persuaded the Marshal to drop the heroic method\r\nwhich had gained so little success, and to fall back on the systematic\r\nwork which is slow but certain[24].’ Suchet gave permission to the\r\nengineers to establish more batteries, and to defer all further\r\nattempts to storm till the approaches should have been carried up to\r\nthe very foot of the walls, and the whole curtain of the Dos Mayo\r\nredoubt should have been battered down.\r\n\r\n  [24] Belmas, iv. p. 96.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, much encouraged by their successful effort of the 18th,\r\ncontinued to make an obstinate resistance: as the enemy sapped uphill\r\ntowards them, they kept up such a careful and deadly fire that the\r\ncasualties in the trenches amounted every day to 15 or 20 men. For the\r\nnext six days nothing decisive happened, though the works continued to\r\ncreep slowly forward: they had to be built with parapets consisting\r\nentirely of earth brought from below, and made very high, since the\r\nnearer they got to the works, the more did the plunging fire from above\r\nsearch them out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Blake was preparing, though with no great self-confidence,\r\nto make an attack on Suchet’s siege-lines, and was only awaiting the\r\narrival of Mahy and the Murcians before striking. He began by trying\r\na feeble diversion on the flank, sending back Obispo’s division once\r\nmore to Segorbe, and getting some of the Empecinado’s bands to threaten\r\nTeruel, the southernmost of the garrisons in Aragon. This so far\r\nannoyed the French marshal that on the 20th of October he sent off\r\nPalombini, with one French and one Italian brigade and 400 horse, to\r\ndrive Obispo out of Segorbe, and to open the road to Teruel. By so\r\ndoing he placed himself in a dangerous position, for he had detached\r\n4,500 men on an excursion which could not take less than four days,\r\nand if Blake had refused to wait for Mahy, and had let Obispo amuse\r\nPalombini, he could have marched against the siege-lines with 20,000\r\nmen, including all his best troops, and would have found only 12,000,\r\nbesides the gunners of the siege artillery, left in the French camp.\r\nIf Suchet had left any detachments to maintain the blockade, as he\r\nprobably would have done, he could only have fought with odds of less\r\nthan one to two. If he had brought up all his battalions, the garrison\r\nwould have sallied forth and destroyed his siege-works.\r\n\r\nBut Blake did not take his chance--whatever it may have been worth: he\r\nwaited for Mahy, who was only due on the 23rd. Meanwhile Palombini made\r\na rapid raid upon Segorbe: but Obispo, leaving two battalions only to\r\nmake a show of resistance, crossed the hills by by-paths and drew in\r\nto Liria, on the flank of the main army, and in close touch with it.\r\nHe could have been used for a battle, if Blake had chosen to deliver\r\none upon the 22nd or 23rd. But the unlucky Spanish general did not so\r\nchoose: and Palombini--finding nothing serious in front of him, and\r\nhearing that Teruel had been already relieved by Severoli--rightly\r\nreturned by forced marches to Saguntum, which he reached on the\r\nafternoon of the 24th of October.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the long-expected Mahy arrived at Liria on the night of the\r\n23rd, and found Obispo already lying there. The two forces united, and\r\nmarched on the 24th to Betera, but there again divided, the Murcians\r\ngoing on to join Blake’s main body, while the Valencian division\r\nreceived orders from the Commander-in-Chief to move as an independent\r\nflanking column, and from Naquera to fall upon the flank or right rear\r\nof Suchet’s position in front of Saguntum.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Blake himself broke out of the lines behind the\r\nGuadalaviar, and after issuing a well-worded proclamation, in which he\r\nsaid that Andriani’s gallant garrison must not perish unassisted, and\r\ndeclared a confidence which he must have been far from feeling in the\r\nresolution of his troops, advanced for some miles along the high-road,\r\nso as to place himself at nightfall within striking distance of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nHis plan of operations, which was clearly set forth in his directions\r\nto Mahy[25], was ambitious in the highest degree, and aimed at the\r\ncomplete destruction of his enemy. Expecting to find Suchet drawn up to\r\nmeet him in the plain south of Saguntum, it appears that he intended\r\nto fight a battle in which an immensely strong left wing was to turn\r\nand break down Suchet’s right, while a weaker right wing (composed,\r\nhowever, of his best troops) was to attack him frontally, and hold\r\nhis main body ‘contained,’ while the turning movement was delivered.\r\nThe left wing contained 26 battalions and nearly 20 squadrons, making\r\nnearly 16,000 bayonets and 1,700 sabres[26]. The detached division of\r\nObispo, from Naquera, was to fall on the extreme French right from\r\nthe rear; the two other Valencian infantry divisions (Miranda and\r\nVillacampa), led by Charles O’Donnell, were to tackle it in front.\r\nMahy’s Murcians were to support O’Donnell, at the same time reaching\r\nout a hand towards Obispo--in order to do this Mahy was directed to\r\nsend out two battalions (under a Colonel O’Ronan) to Cabezbort, a\r\nhillside intermediate between the point where Obispo was expected\r\nand the left of the two other Valencian divisions. The left wing had\r\nallotted to it the whole of the Murcian horse, 800 sabres, and one of\r\nthe two Valencian cavalry brigades, under General San Juan, which was\r\nof about the same strength. It had also 18 guns.\r\n\r\n  [25] Which may be read in full in Arteche, xi. pp. 157-9.\r\n\r\n  [26] We are luckily in possession of the exact ‘morning state’\r\n  of Blake’s army, which is printed in the rare Spanish government\r\n  publication of 1822, _Estados de la Organizacion y Fuerza de\r\n  los Ejércitos Españoles_, pp. 184-7. Obispo had 3,400 men,\r\n  Miranda 4,000, Villacampa 3,350, Mahy 4,600 infantry, under\r\n  Montijo and Creagh, and 830 horse. This wing had 2 horse- and 2\r\n  field-batteries, 18 guns.\r\n\r\nSo much for the left wing. The right wing, conducted by Blake in\r\nperson, which had advanced up the high-road from Valencia towards\r\nMurviedro, consisted of the two ‘Expeditionary Divisions’ of Zayas\r\nand Lardizabal, both very weak because of the losses which they\r\nhad suffered in the campaign around Baza in August--each was eight\r\nbattalions strong; but the former had only 2,500, the latter 3,000 men,\r\nso that the units averaged well under 400 bayonets. But these were good\r\nold troops, which had greatly distinguished themselves at Albuera: they\r\nwere the only part of Blake’s army in which any real confidence could\r\nbe placed. In support of these veterans the Commander-in-Chief brought\r\nup the Valencian ‘Division of Reserve,’ which consisted entirely of the\r\nnewly raised 3rd battalions of the regiments serving with Villacampa\r\nand Miranda. They had only been under arms a few months, were not\r\nfully equipped or clothed, and were dreadfully under-officered; for\r\nfive strong battalions, of over 700 bayonets each, there were only\r\n75 officers in all--fifteen per battalion, where there should have\r\nbeen thirty, and these were the mere leavings of the older units of\r\neach regiment, or else newly gazetted ensigns. As a fighting force\r\nthese 3,500 men were nearly useless--and Blake put them where they\r\nwere least likely to get into trouble. They were divided into two\r\nbrigades: Brigadier-General Velasco seems to have been in command,\r\n_vice_ Acuña, who had the division during the autumn. The right column\r\nwas accompanied by the handful of horse belonging to the ‘Expeditionary\r\nForce’--300 sabres under General Loy--and by the second Valencian\r\nCavalry Brigade under General Caro, some 800 mounted men more. It was\r\naccompanied, like the other wing, by three batteries. Thus, counting\r\nits gunners and sappers, the right wing had under 10,500 men, while the\r\nimmensely strong left had over 17,000. But it is quality rather than\r\nmere numbers which counts in war--the weak wing fought a good battle\r\nagainst equal strength, and looked for a moment as if it might win. The\r\nstrong wing disgraced itself, and was routed by a fourth of its own\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nSuchet had been somewhat troubled by the first news of Blake’s sudden\r\nsally from Valencia, for though he desired a battle, wherein success\r\nwould probably win him the immediate surrender of the hard-pressed\r\ngarrison of Saguntum, yet he did not wish that matters should be forced\r\nto a crisis in Palombini’s absence. It was only after the well-timed\r\nreturn of that general to his camp, that he welcomed the approach of a\r\ndecisive action. But with Palombini at his disposition again, he was\r\neager to fight.\r\n\r\nHe had at this moment with him, in the lines before Saguntum, 35\r\nbattalions of foot (of which the three Neapolitan units under Compère\r\nwere mere skeletons, with little over a thousand men between them),\r\nwith 15 squadrons of horse and 36 field-guns. He left behind him, to\r\nmaintain the siege-works before the fortress, two battalions of the\r\n117th line from Habert’s division, and Balathier’s Italian brigade,\r\nmaking four battalions more. The weak Neapolitan brigade of Compère,\r\nonly 1,400 men, even with its cavalry included, was placed in support\r\nof the blockading force, at Gillet and Petres, to watch the road from\r\nSegorbe, by which some outlying Spanish detachment might possibly\r\nattempt to communicate with the garrison of Saguntum. This left for the\r\nline of battle 26 battalions--six of Habert’s, eleven of Harispe’s,\r\nfour of Palombini’s Italians, and five of Robert’s reserve brigade.\r\nThe total amounted to about 12,000 infantry, while the whole of the\r\ncavalry, except the two Neapolitan squadrons, was put in the field\r\nto the amount of some 1,800 sabres. Counting the gunners of the six\r\nbatteries of artillery, Suchet’s fighting force was not much over\r\n14,000 men. He had left 4,000, besides the gunners of the siege-train\r\nand the sappers, to deal with the garrison of Saguntum. This was little\r\nmore than half of Blake’s numbers, for the Spanish general--as we have\r\nseen--was marching forward with 27,000 men in line. That Suchet gladly\r\ntook the risk sufficiently shows his opinion of the quality of the\r\ngreater part of the Valencian army. It seems, we must confess, rather\r\nhazardous to have left 4,000 men in the blockading corps, when forces\r\nwere so unequal. In a similar case Beresford at Albuera took every\r\nman out of the trenches, and fought with his whole army. Andriani’s\r\ngarrison was not numerous enough to execute any really dangerous sally\r\nin the rear, and was so constricted, in its precipitous fastness, that\r\nit could not easily come down or deploy itself. Perhaps Suchet may have\r\nfeared, however, that it would take the opportunity of absconding by\r\nsome postern, if it were not shut in upon all sides. But there were to\r\nbe moments during the battle when the Marshal would gladly have had the\r\nassistance of two or three more battalions of steady troops.\r\n\r\nSuchet had chosen for his fighting-ground the narrow plain south of\r\nSaguntum, extending from the sea to the foot of the hills of the Sancti\r\nEspiritus range--a space of less than three miles in very flat ground.\r\nIt was open for the most part, but sprinkled in certain sections with\r\nolives and carob-trees, and contained one or two slight eminences or\r\nmounds, which rose above the general surface, though only by a score\r\nor two of feet, so that they had a certain command over the adjoining\r\nflats. The left of the line, nearest to the sea, was formed of Habert’s\r\nimperfect division, which, having detached two battalions for the\r\nblockade of Saguntum, had only six left--2,500 bayonets--in line.\r\nThe right consisted of Harispe’s division, which was stronger than\r\nHabert’s, as it had nine battalions in line, even after setting aside\r\none regiment (the 44th) for a flank-guard. Its force was about 3,600\r\nbayonets. This division lay to the right of the road from Murviedro to\r\nValencia. The reserve consisted of the Italian brigade (that of Saint\r\nPaul), which had not been told off for the siege, and of the three\r\nFrench cavalry regiments, in all 2,000 bayonets and 1,300 sabres.\r\nIt was drawn up half a mile in rear of Habert and Harispe, ready to\r\nsupport either of them. The batteries, horse and foot, accompanied\r\ntheir respective divisions.\r\n\r\nWe have thus accounted for 10,000 men. The remainder of Suchet’s\r\nfighting force constituted a flank-guard, to prevent his line from\r\nbeing turned on its right, the side of the hills. It originally\r\nconsisted of Robert’s ‘reserve brigade,’ five battalions, or 2,500\r\nbayonets, and of one cavalry regiment, Schiazzetti’s Italian\r\ndragoons--450 sabres--with one battery. These troops were drawn up on\r\nthe higher slopes of the Sancti Espiritus hills, covering the pass of\r\nthe same name and the country road which goes over it. To these Suchet\r\nadded, at the last moment, one regiment from Harispe’s division, the\r\n44th, under the Brigadier Chlopiski, who, being senior to Robert,\r\ntook command of the whole flank-guard. These two battalions--1,200\r\nmen--took post on the hill-slopes to the left of Robert, half-way\r\nbetween his position and that of Harispe’s right. The whole force,\r\nincluding the dragoons and the artillery, made about 4,300 men.\r\nCompère’s Neapolitans were too far to their left rear to be reckoned an\r\nappreciable support, and had their own separate task, though they were\r\nnever called upon to discharge it. The ground occupied by Chlopiski’s\r\n4,300 men was exceedingly strong, and the Marshal hoped that they might\r\nbe relied upon to hold off the turning movement, which he was aware\r\nwas to be made against his inland flank. For he knew that Charles\r\nO’Donnell was advancing from the direction of Betera, which could\r\nonly mean a projected attack on his own right. Had he realized that\r\nnot only O’Donnell, but also Obispo and Mahy’s Murcians, in all some\r\n17,000 men, were about to operate against Chlopiski, he must surely\r\nhave strengthened his covering force, for the odds would have been\r\nimpossible if the Valencians had made any fight at all. But they did\r\nnot!\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 25th of October Suchet was ready to receive the\r\nattack which was impending. He could make out the general dispositions\r\nof the enemy, and the concentric advance of Obispo’s, O’Donnell’s, and\r\nBlake’s own men was duly reported to him. It was on receiving notice of\r\nthe heavy appearance of the second, or central, hostile column that he\r\ndetached Chlopiski’s two battalions to strengthen Robert’s flank-guard.\r\nPresently, about 7 o’clock, the Spaniards came within touch; the left,\r\nit would seem, somewhat before the right[27], the first shots being\r\ninterchanged between the two battalions which Mahy had sent towards\r\nCabezbort and Robert’s troops. This was only a trifling skirmish, the\r\nSpaniards being completely checked. But soon after a serious attack was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n  [27] There are terrible difficulties as to the timing of the\r\n  battle of Saguntum. Suchet says that the first engagement was\r\n  between Obispo’s flanking division, coming over the hills on\r\n  the west, and Robert. Schepeler says that Obispo arrived too\r\n  late altogether, and was practically not in the fight (p. 472).\r\n  I think that the explanation is that Suchet took O’Ronan’s two\r\n  battalions for Obispo, because they came from the direction\r\n  where he was expected. I follow, in my timing of the battle,\r\n  the very clear narrative of Vacani (v. pp. 440-1), who seems\r\n  to make it clear that the main fighting on the French right\r\n  was well over before that in the centre, and long before that\r\n  on the left. Schepeler (who rode with Blake that day) also\r\n  makes it certain that Lardizabal and Zayas were fighting long\r\n  after Miranda, Villacampa, and Mahy had been disposed of. But\r\n  difficulties remain, which could only be cleared up if we had a\r\n  report by Obispo. General Arteche thinks that the action began\r\n  fairly simultaneously all along the line, and follows Schepeler\r\n  in saying that Obispo was late (xi. p. 174), the very reverse of\r\n  Suchet’s statement that he came, and was beaten, too early.\r\n\r\nThe next advance was that of the two Valencian divisions under Charles\r\nO’Donnell, who were a long way ahead of the main body of Mahy’s\r\nMurcians, their destined reserve. Blake’s intention was apparently\r\nto strike with his left wing first, and to force in the French right\r\nbefore his own column delivered its blow. Everything depended on the\r\nsuccessful action of the mass of Valencian and Murcian infantry against\r\nthe small hostile force posted on the slopes of the Sancti Espiritus\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of Miranda and Villacampa duly descended from the lower\r\nopposite heights of the Germanels, crossed the bottom, and began to\r\nmount the opposing slope, Villacampa on the left, somewhat in advance,\r\nMiranda a little to his right rear: behind them in support marched San\r\nJuan’s Valencian cavalry. Beyond the latter there was a considerable\r\ngap to the nearest troops of Blake’s own column, which had not yet\r\ncome into action. Mahy, whose orders definitely said that he was to\r\nact as a reserve, and to protect O’Donnell’s flank if the latter were\r\nchecked, occupied the Germanels, when the Valencians had gone on, and\r\nwas still at the top of his own slope, having to his left front the\r\ntwo detached battalions at Cabezbort under O’Ronan, when the clash\r\ncame. Waiting till the two Valencian divisions and the cavalry in\r\nsupport were some little way up the hill, and had begun to drive in\r\nhis skirmishers, Chlopiski moved down upon them with the whole of his\r\nmodest force--Robert’s five battalions in front, to the right of the\r\npass and the road, his own two battalions of the 44th to its left and\r\nsomewhat on the flank. Meanwhile Schiazzetti’s regiment of Italian\r\ndragoons charged down the gap between the two bodies of infantry. As\r\nVillacampa was somewhat ahead of Miranda, the first crash fell upon\r\nhim. Robert’s infantry drove him without any difficulty right downhill,\r\nwhile the Italian dragoons rode at Miranda’s battalions on his right.\r\nVillacampa’s men fell into hopeless confusion, but what was worse was\r\nthat Miranda’s division, seeing their comrades break, gave way before\r\nthe cavalry without making any resistance whatever, apparently before\r\nthe French 44th had even got into touch with them on the flank. This\r\nwas a disgraceful business: the 7,000 Valencian infantry, and the\r\n1,700 cavalry in support, were routed in ten minutes by half their own\r\nnumbers--one good cavalry regiment of 450 sabres sufficed to upset a\r\nwhole division of seven battalions--if a single one of them had formed\r\na steady square, the Italian horse ought to have been driven off with\r\nease!\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of the affair. San Juan’s horse were close\r\nbehind the routed divisions--O’Donnell ordered them up to save the\r\nwrecks of his infantry: at the same time Mahy hurried forward two\r\nbattalions of his Murcians[28] to support San Juan, and began to\r\nadvance with the rest of his division down the slope of the Germanels\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n  [28] Burgos and Tiradores de Cadiz.\r\n\r\nAfter making havoc of the Valencian foot, Chlopiski had halted his\r\ntroops for a moment, wishing to be sure that matters were going well\r\nwith the French main body before he committed himself to any further\r\nenterprise. But the temptation to go on was too great, for the routed\r\nSpanish troops and their supports were weltering together in confusion\r\nat the bottom of the hill. It is said that the dragoon colonel,\r\nSchiazzetti, settled the matter for his superior, by charging at San\r\nJuan’s horse the moment that he had got his squadrons re-formed. The\r\nValencian cavalry, though it outnumbered the Italians by two to one,\r\nturned tail at once and bolted, riding over the two battalions of\r\nMurcian infantry which were in its immediate rear, and carrying them\r\naway in its panic. Chlopiski then led on his seven battalions against\r\nthe disordered mass in front of him, and swept the whole before him. It\r\ngave way and fled uphill, horse and foot, the Murcian cavalry brigade\r\nin reserve going off on the same panic-stricken way as the Valencian.\r\nIt was some time before Mahy could get a single regiment to stand--but\r\nat last he found a sort of rearguard of two battalions (one of his\r\nown, one of Villacampa’s[29]) which had kept together and were still\r\ncapable of obeying orders. The French were now exhausted; the infantry\r\ncould not follow in regular formation so fast as their enemy fled; the\r\nhandful of cavalry was dispersed, driving in prisoners on every side.\r\nSo Mahy and O’Donnell ultimately got off, with their men in a horde\r\nscattered over the country-side--the cavalry leading the stampede and\r\nthe two rallied battalions bringing up the rear[30]. The Spanish left\r\nwing lost over 2,000 prisoners, mainly from Miranda’s division, but\r\nonly some 400 killed and wounded; several guns from the divisional\r\nbatteries were of course lost. All this was over so early in the day\r\nthat the fighting on Blake’s right wing was at its hottest just when\r\nthe wrecks of his left were disappearing over the hills. Obispo, who\r\ncame up too late to help,[31] and the two detached battalions under\r\nO’Ronan got off separately, more towards the north, retiring on Naquera.\r\n\r\n  [29] Cuenca and Molina.\r\n\r\n  [30] O’Ronan’s two battalions went off in a separate direction,\r\n  unpursued, and joined Obispo, not being in the rout.\r\n\r\n  [31] See above, page 36.\r\n\r\nThe tale of this part of the battle of Saguntum is lamentable.\r\nThere is no record so bad in the whole war: even the Gebora was a\r\nwell-contested fight compared with this--and at Belchite the army that\r\nfled so easily gave way before numbers equal or superior to its own,\r\nnot inferior in the proportion of one to three. The fact was that the\r\nValencian troops had a long record of disasters behind them, were\r\nthoroughly demoralized, and could not be trusted for one moment, and\r\nthat the Murcians (as Mahy confessed) were not much better. The defeat\r\nwas rendered more shameful by the fact that the smaller half of Blake’s\r\nArmy, the ‘Expeditionary Force,’ was at the same moment making head\r\nin good style against numbers rather larger than its own, and seemed\r\nfor a moment about to achieve a splendid success. If the Spanish left,\r\n17,000 strong, could have ‘contained’ half its own strength, if it\r\ncould have kept 8,000 instead of 4,000 French employed for one hour,\r\nBlake might have relieved Saguntum and driven off Suchet. But the story\r\nis disgraceful. Mahy wrote next morning to Blake, ‘I must tell you,\r\nwith my usual bluntness, that you had better sell the horses of this\r\ncavalry, and draft the men into the infantry. I could not have believed\r\nin the possibility of such conduct, if I had not seen it with my own\r\neyes take place and cost us so much[32].’ Blake actually gave orders\r\nfor one hussar regiment (a Murcian one) to be deprived of its horses\r\nand drafted out. But did the infantry behave much better?\r\n\r\n  [32] Quoted in Arteche, xi. p. 178.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to a less depressing narrative, the story of the\r\noperations of Blake’s own wing. The Commander-in-Chief, as it will\r\nbe remembered, had with him the ‘Expeditionary Divisions,’ the\r\nValencian Reserve Division, and Loy’s and Caro’s 1,100 cavalry. He took\r\npost himself on the height called El Puig, with one brigade of the\r\nValencians, to the south of the ravine of the Picador, which crosses\r\nthe plain in a diagonal direction. The rest of the troops went forward\r\nin two columns: Zayas formed the right near the sea; his flank was\r\ncovered by a squadron of gunboats, which advanced parallel with him,\r\nas near the shore as their draught permitted. He was ordered to push\r\non and get, if possible, round Suchet’s flank, where Habert’s line\r\nwas ‘refused,’ because of the guns of the flotilla, whose fire the\r\nFrench wished to avoid. If successful Zayas was to try to communicate\r\nwith the garrison of Saguntum. Further inland Lardizabal’s division,\r\naccompanied by the 1,100 cavalry, and followed by the other brigade\r\nof the Valencian reserve, crossed the Picador at the bridge on the\r\n_chaussée_, and deployed in the plain, directly opposite Harispe’s\r\ndivision. The whole force was about equal to the French opposed to it.\r\n\r\nThe two ‘Expeditionary Divisions’ went forward in good order and with\r\ngreat confidence: Suchet remarks in his _Mémoires_ that in all his\r\nprevious campaigns he had never seen Spanish troops advance with such\r\nresolution or in such good order[33]. Zayas, on the sea-flank, became\r\nimmediately engaged with Habert, before the village of Puzzol, in a\r\nheavy fight, with exactly equal numbers--each had about 2,500 men.\r\nBoth sides lost heavily, and neither had any advantage: Suchet had\r\nordered Habert not to take the offensive till matters were settled in\r\nthe centre, but the defensive proved costly, and the Spaniards pushed\r\non--these were the same battalions which had behaved so well on the\r\nhill of Albuera--Irlanda, Patria, and the Spanish and Walloon Guards.\r\n\r\n  [33] _Mémoires_, ii. p. 182.\r\n\r\nFurther to the left Lardizabal had deployed, after crossing the ravine,\r\nwith his two weak brigades in line; the Valencian reserve remained\r\nbehind near the bridge, but Loy’s and Caro’s cavalry came forward on\r\nthe right in support. Opposite the front brigade (Prieto’s) was a long\r\nlow mound, the last outlying spur of the Sancti Espiritus range. This\r\nwas soon seen by both sides to be a point of vantage--the army that\r\ncould occupy it would have a good artillery position commanding the\r\nhostile line. Suchet ordered up Harispe’s right battalions to seize\r\nit, and galloped thither in person at the head of his escort of fifty\r\nhussars. But the Spaniards had also marked it, and the Marshal had\r\nhardly reached its top when he found Prieto’s skirmishers swarming up\r\nthe slope. He had to retire, and rode back to bring up his infantry;\r\nbut, by the time that they had come forward, the enemy had formed a\r\nhasty line of battle along the mound, with a battery in its centre.\r\nSuchet had therefore to attack--which he did in full force, the four\r\nbattalions of the 7th Line forming a heavy column in the centre, while\r\nthose of the 116th and the 3rd of the Vistula deployed on each side\r\nsomewhat to the rear--a clear instance of the use of the _ordre mixte_\r\nwhich Napoleon loved. The left flank was covered by two squadrons of\r\nthe 4th Hussars and one of the 13th Cuirassiers, brought out from the\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThis was bringing 3,600 bayonets to bear against 1,500, for Prieto’s\r\nbrigade counted no more upon the mound. The attack was successful, but\r\nnot without severe loss: General Paris, leading on the 7th regiment,\r\nwas wounded, as were both his aides-de-camp, and Harispe’s horse was\r\nkilled under him; the Spanish artillery fire had been deadly. When\r\nthe mound was stormed, the Spanish infantry were forced back, but by\r\nno means in disorder. They formed up again not far from its foot,\r\nand Lardizabal brought up his second brigade to support his first,\r\nplaced two batteries in line, and stood to fight again. Suchet, having\r\nre-formed Harispe’s men, found that he had before him a second combat\r\non the flat ground. The infantry on both sides were heavily engaged,\r\nand six French guns had been brought forward to enfilade Lardizabal’s\r\nright, when a new turn was given to the battle. The Spanish general\r\nordered Loy’s and Caro’s 1,100 cavalry to charge in mass upon the three\r\nsquadrons of hussars and cuirassiers which covered Harispe’s left.\r\nThe move was an unexpected one, and was concealed for some time by\r\nscattered carob-trees: the attack was well delivered, and the French\r\nhorse, outnumbered by more than two to one, were completely routed and\r\nfled in disorder. Loy then wheeled in upon the French flank, captured\r\nthree guns of the battery there placed, and nearly broke the 116th of\r\nthe Line, which had only just time to fall back and form itself _en\r\npotence_ to the rest of the division. The remainder of the Spanish\r\ncavalry pursued the retreating hussars.\r\n\r\nThe moment looked black for the Marshal: he himself confesses in his\r\n_Mémoires_ that if Harispe’s infantry had given way the battle might\r\nhave been lost[34]. But he had still a reserve: he sent back orders to\r\nPalombini to bring up Saint Paul’s four Italian battalions into the\r\ngap, and rode himself to the two squadrons of the 13th Cuirassiers\r\nwhich had not yet advanced into the fight. They were only 350 sabres,\r\nbut the regiment was a fine one, and had won, at Margalef and other\r\nfields, a great confidence in its ability to face long odds. They were\r\nlaunched straight at the victorious Spanish cavalry, whose main body\r\nwas advancing in great disorder, and with its line broken by the groves\r\nof carob-trees, while the remainder had turned inward against the\r\nFrench infantry. The cuirassiers went straight through the squadrons\r\nopposed to them, and swept them away: whereupon even those units of the\r\nSpanish horse which had not been attacked wheeled round, and retreated\r\nhastily toward the Picador ravine and its bridge. The cuirassiers\r\nfollowed, upsetting everything in their front, and only halted on\r\nthe edge of the ravine, where they were checked by the fire of the\r\nbattery attached to the Valencian reserve, and the skirmishers of that\r\nbody, who had lined the farther edge of the depression[35]. Both the\r\nSpanish brigadiers, Loy and Caro, had behaved very gallantly; both were\r\nseverely wounded, while trying to rally their men, and were left on the\r\nfield as prisoners.\r\n\r\n  [34] _Mémoires_, ii. p. 185.\r\n\r\n  [35] This account of the charge of the cuirassiers comes from\r\n  the _Mémoires_ of Colonel de Gonneville, who commanded their\r\n  leading squadron. There is a curious point to be settled here.\r\n  Marshal Suchet says (_Mémoires_, ii. p. 185) that he rode in\r\n  person to the head of the regiment, and harangued it shortly on\r\n  Margalef and other ancient glories, before bidding it charge.\r\n  While speaking he was struck by a spent ball on the shoulder.\r\n  But de Gonneville (who had read Suchet’s book, as he quotes\r\n  it in other places) says distinctly (p. 208 of his _Souvenirs\r\n  militaires_) that he received no orders, and charged on his own\r\n  responsibility. ‘N’ayant là d’ordre à recevoir de personne,\r\n  mais comprenant la nécessité d’arrêter cette masse de cavalerie\r\n  qui arrivait à nous, &c. ... je donnai le signal.’ Was Suchet\r\n  romancing about his little speech? Or was de Gonneville, who\r\n  wrote his _Mémoires_ forty years later, oblivious? Either\r\n  hypothesis is difficult.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Spanish horse settled the day, which had for a moment\r\nlooked doubtful. At the sight of the French hussars breaking, and the\r\nadvance of their own line, the garrison of Saguntum, who had the whole\r\nfield in view from their lofty perch, had lined their walls, cheering\r\nand waving their shakos in the air--despite of the shells from the\r\nsiege-batteries which continued to play upon them. The cheers died down\r\nas the changed fortunes of the day became visible, and hearts sank in\r\nthe fortress. But the fighting was not yet concluded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGUNTUM]\r\n\r\nThe rout of Loy’s and Caro’s horse had not directly affected\r\nLardizabal’s infantry, for the victorious cuirassiers had galloped\r\nstraight before them after the fugitives, though they had also ridden\r\nover and captured a Spanish battery on the right of the line of\r\ndeployed battalions. The decisive blow in this quarter was given by\r\nSaint Paul’s Italians, who, issuing from olive groves behind Harispe’s\r\nleft, came in upon the unprotected flank of Lardizabal’s troops, which\r\nthey rolled up, driving away at the same time a few squadrons which\r\nhad not been affected by the charge of the cuirassiers. These last\r\nrode in among their own infantry, which was already hotly engaged\r\nwith Harispe’s battalions, and carried confusion down the line. The\r\ndivision, which had hitherto fought most gallantly, gave way, and\r\nretired in confusion towards the bridge over the Picador, and the\r\nCartuja where Lardizabal hoped to sustain himself by means of the\r\nbattery and the Valencian reserve battalions which he left there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Blake, from the summit of the knoll of El Puig, had witnessed\r\nwith impotent grief the rout of his right centre. He had placed himself\r\nso far to the rear that no orders which he sent reached Lardizabal in\r\ntime, and the reserve which he had kept under his own hand, three raw\r\nValencian battalions and a battery, would have been too weak to save\r\nthe day, even if it had not been so far--two miles--from the central\r\nfocus of the fight as to make its arrival in time quite impossible.\r\nThe General, from the moment that he had given the original order to\r\nadvance, exercised no influence whatever on the operations; one of his\r\nstaff says that he sat on his horse in blank and stupid amazement at\r\nthe rout, and that some of those who watched him thought him wanting in\r\npersonal courage no less than in decision[36]. But at last he roused\r\nhimself to issue orders for the retreat of his broken left and centre\r\ntowards Valencia, and for the instant withdrawal of his still intact\r\nright wing.\r\n\r\n  [36] Schepeler, p. 473.\r\n\r\nHere Zayas’s division stood in a most difficult place, for though\r\nit had been contending on equal terms with Habert’s in front of the\r\nvillage of Puzzol, it is one thing to keep up a standing fight, and\r\nanother to withdraw from it with a victorious enemy pushing in upon the\r\nflank. However, Zayas ordered his battalions back, and though pressed\r\nby Habert, brought them in good order across the ravine and back to\r\nthe height of El Puig, where Blake stood waiting him with his small\r\nreserve. Only one corps, the Walloon Guards, had thrown itself into\r\nthe houses of Puzzol, could not be extracted from them in time, and\r\nwas surrounded and captured. But this small disaster did much to save\r\nthe rest of the division, for so many of the French closed in upon the\r\nvillage, where the Walloons made a good stand, that the pursuit was not\r\nso hotly pushed as it might have been. If Suchet could have pressed\r\nin upon Blake before Zayas joined him, the whole Spanish right column\r\nmight have been completely cut off from its retreat. But the Marshal\r\nrequired some leisure to rearrange his line, after routing Lardizabal;\r\nand by the time that he had sent off the rallied 4th Hussars to help\r\nChlopiski gather in prisoners, and had turned the Italians aside to\r\nmarch against Blake, with Harispe in support, nearly two hours had gone\r\nby, and the Spanish right, molested only by Habert, was drawing off\r\ntowards safety. Following the road along the sea-shore, it reached the\r\nsuburbs of Valencia without any further loss.\r\n\r\nNot so the unfortunate remnant of Lardizabal’s troops. They had halted\r\nat the Cartuja, behind the Picador, while their general strove to\r\nrally them on the reserve there left. This delay, though soldier-like\r\nand proper, enabled Suchet to catch them up: he charged them with his\r\nlast fresh regiment, the 24th Dragoons, which had been kept in hand,\r\napparently behind Habert’s position, till the retreat of the Spanish\r\nright began. Then, attacking along the high-road, these squadrons broke\r\nin upon the half-rallied troops, swept them away, and captured two\r\nguns put in battery across the _chaussée_, and badly supported by the\r\nValencian reserve battalions. Lardizabal’s column went off in great\r\ndisorder, and was hunted as far as the Caraixet stream, losing many\r\nprisoners to the dragoons, as well as four flags.\r\n\r\nSo ended the day; the loss of the Spaniards was not very heavy in\r\nkilled and wounded--about 1,000 it is said, mainly in Lardizabal’s\r\nand Zayas’s divisions--for the others did not stand to fight. But\r\nof prisoners they lost 4,641, including 230 officers and the two\r\nwounded cavalry brigadiers. Miranda’s division contributed the\r\nlargest proportion to the captives, though Zayas lost 400 men of the\r\nWalloon battalion, and Lardizabal a still greater number out of his\r\nweak division of 3,000 bayonets[37]. Twelve guns were left behind,\r\nseven captured in the hard fighting in the right centre, five from\r\nO’Donnell’s easily-routed divisions. The French casualties are given by\r\nSuchet at about 130 killed and 590 wounded--probably an understatement,\r\nas the regimental returns show 55 officers hit, which at the ordinary\r\nrate of casualties should imply over 1,000 rank and file disabled.\r\nAs a commentary on the fighting, it may be remarked that Chlopiski\r\nand Robert, in dealing with Obispo, O’Donnell, and Mahy, had only 7\r\nofficers _hors de combat_, while Harispe and Habert lost 41 in the real\r\nfight with Zayas and Lardizabal[38].\r\n\r\n  [37] 2nd of Badajoz (two battalions) was almost exterminated,\r\n  losing 17 officers, 21 sergeants, and 500 men, ‘mostly\r\n  prisoners,’ out of 800 present. See its history in the Conde de\r\n  Clonard’s great work on the Spanish army.\r\n\r\n  [38] The 16th Line (three battalions) alone, in fighting Zayas,\r\n  lost just double as many officers as the seven battalions of\r\n  Chlopiski and Robert in their engagement with Mahy, Miranda, and\r\n  Villacampa!\r\n\r\nThe actual losses in action were not the worst part of the battle\r\nof Saguntum--the real disaster was the plain demonstration that the\r\nValencian troops could not stand even against very inferior numbers.\r\nIt was to no purpose that the two gallant ‘Expeditionary Divisions’\r\nhad sacrificed themselves, and lost one man in three out of their\r\nsmall force of 5,500 men in hard fighting. They had been betrayed by\r\ntheir worthless associates on the left. Blake’s generalship had not\r\nbeen good--he dispersed his columns in the most reckless way, and kept\r\nno sufficient reserves--but with the odds in his favour of 27,000\r\nmen to 14,000, he ought yet to have won, if the larger half of his\r\narmy had consented to fight. They did not: with such troops no more\r\ncould be hoped from further battles in the open field--whatever the\r\nnumerical odds might be. They could at most be utilized behind walls\r\nand entrenchments, for purely passive defence. And this, as we shall\r\nsee, was the deduction that their general made from the unhappy events\r\nof October 25.\r\n\r\nNext morning Suchet sent in a summons to the garrison of Saguntum, and\r\nthe governor, Andriani, after short haggling for terms, surrendered.\r\nHe is not to be blamed: his garrison had seen the rout of Blake’s army\r\nwith their own eyes, and knew that there was no more hope for them.\r\nThey were, as we have seen, mainly raw troops, and their good bearing\r\nup to this moment, rather than their demoralization after the battle,\r\nshould provoke notice. The French approaches were by this time within\r\na few yards of the Dos Mayo redoubt and its hastily patched breaches.\r\nThe artillery fire of the besiegers was rapidly levelling the whole\r\nwork, and the next storm, made on a wide front of shattered curtain,\r\nmust have succeeded. It is true that a governor of the type of Alvarez\r\nof Gerona would then have held out for some time in the castle of San\r\nFernando. But Andriani’s troops were not like those of Alvarez, and he\r\nhimself was a good soldier, but not a fanatical genius. Two thousand\r\nthree hundred prisoners marched out on the 26th, leaving not quite 200\r\nmen in hospital behind them. The 17 guns of the fortress were many of\r\nthem damaged, and the store of shot and shell was very low, though\r\nthere were plenty of infantry cartridges left[39].\r\n\r\n  [39] For details see Belmas, iv. pp. 140-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF VALENCIA AND OF BLAKE’S ARMY. NOVEMBER 1811-JANUARY 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the result of the disastrous battle of Saguntum Blake had lost the\r\nfortress which had served him so well as an outwork: while his field\r\narmy was much decreased in numbers, and still more in self-confidence.\r\nIt was obviously impossible that he should ever again attempt to take\r\nthe offensive with it. But he was still in possession of Valencia\r\nand all its resources, and his carefully fortified lines along the\r\nGuadalaviar were so strong that even a defeated army could make some\r\nstand behind them. He had still, after all his losses, more than 22,000\r\nmen under arms[40]. Yet it is doubtful whether a resolute push on the\r\npart of the enemy would not have dislodged him, for more than half his\r\narmy was in a state of complete demoralization.\r\n\r\n  [40] A battalion or two left in Valencia, when the rest of the\r\n  army went out to deliver Saguntum, must be added to the 20,000\r\n  men who came back from the battle. These corps were 2nd of Leon\r\n  of Lardizabal’s division, and one battalion of Savoya belonging\r\n  to Miranda.\r\n\r\nSuchet, however, had made up his mind not to strike at once; and when a\r\nfew days had passed, and the Spaniards had been granted time to settle\r\ndown into the lines, it would undoubtedly have been hazardous to attack\r\nthem with the very modest numbers that the Army of Aragon had still\r\nin line. The chance would have been to press the pursuit hard, on the\r\nvery day after the battle. But when the Marshal had counted up his\r\nlosses in the trenches and the field, had deducted a small garrison\r\nfor Saguntum, and had detached a brigade to escort to Tortosa his\r\nnumerous prisoners, he thought himself too weak for a decisive blow.\r\nHe would not have had 15,000 men in hand, unless he should call up\r\nFicatier’s brigade from Segorbe and Oropesa, and this he did not want\r\nto do, as he was entirely dependent for food and stores on the line of\r\ncommunication which Ficatier was guarding. Accordingly he resolved to\r\ndefer his next blow at Blake, till he should have summoned from Aragon\r\nSeveroli’s division, and Reille’s too, if the Emperor would give him\r\nleave to requisition that force. He could not utilize Reille without\r\nthat leave; but Severoli’s troops belonged to his own army, and were at\r\nhis disposition, if he should judge it possible to draw them southward\r\nwithout endangering the safety of Aragon. This he was prepared to do,\r\nif a sufficient garrison for that province could be provided from\r\nanother source. And the only obvious source was the Army of the North:\r\nif the Emperor would consent to order Dorsenne to find troops to make\r\nSaragossa and the line of the Ebro secure, it would not be over rash to\r\nborrow both Severoli and Reille for operations against Valencia. But it\r\nwas clear that it would take some weeks for the permission to be sent\r\nfrom Paris, and for the troops of the Army of the North to be moved,\r\nwhen and if the permission was granted. We shall see, as a matter of\r\nfact, that it was not till the end of December, two full months after\r\nthe battle of Saguntum, that the two divisions were collected on the\r\ndesired ground, and the final blow against Blake was delivered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Suchet could do no more than place his divisions in the\r\nmost favourable position for making the advance that would only be\r\npossible when Severoli, and perhaps Reille also, should arrive. With\r\nthis object he pushed them forward on November 3 to the line of the\r\nGuadalaviar, close in front of Blake’s long series of entrenchments.\r\nHarispe on the right advanced to Paterna, Habert on the left to the\r\nclose neighbourhood of Valencia. He drove the Spanish outposts from\r\nthe outlying suburb of Serranos, which lay beyond the lines and on\r\nthe north side of the river, and also from the Grao, or port and mole\r\nwhich forms the outlet of Valencia to the sea. It was most unlucky for\r\nBlake, in the end, that his natural line of communication with the\r\nMediterranean and the English fleet lay north of the Guadalaviar, and\r\noutside his line of fortifications. Indeed it looks as if there was a\r\ncardinal fault in the planning of the defences when the Grao was left\r\noutside them, for though rather remote from the city (two miles) it\r\nwould be of inestimable importance, supposing that the French were\r\nto succeed in crossing the Guadalaviar and investing Valencia. With\r\nthe port safe, the defenders could receive succour and supplies to\r\nany extent, and if finally reduced to extremity could retreat by sea.\r\nSome of the energy which had been expended in throwing up the immense\r\nfortified camp which embraced all the southern suburbs, and in lining\r\nthe river westward with batteries, might well have been diverted to\r\nthe fortification of the Grao and its connexion with the works of the\r\ncity. But probably Blake, in his looking forward to the possible events\r\nof the future, did not contemplate among the contingencies to be faced\r\nthat of his being shut up with the greater part of his army within the\r\nwalls of Valencia. If he were forced from the lines of the Guadalaviar,\r\nhe must have intended to fall back inland or southward, and not to\r\nallow himself to be surrounded in the capital. Otherwise it would\r\nhave been absolutely insane for him to leave unfortified, and abandon\r\nwithout a struggle, Valencia’s sole outlet to the sea.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile finding himself for week after week unassailed in his lines,\r\nBlake had to take stock of his position, and see if there was anything\r\nthat he could do to avert the attack which must come one day, and\r\nwhich would obviously be formidable. For it had become known to him,\r\nere long, that Severoli’s division, and probably other troops, were\r\nworking in towards Valencia, and would certainly join Suchet before\r\nthe winter was over. The only expedients of which Blake made use were\r\nto keep masses of men continuously at work strengthening his lines,\r\nand to renew the attempt, which he had made fruitlessly in September,\r\nfor loosing Suchet’s hold on Valencia by launching against his rear\r\nthe irregulars of Aragon--the bands of the Empecinado, Duran, and the\r\nminor chiefs. To add some solidity to their hordes he detached from\r\nhis army the Conde de Montijo, with one of the two brigades which Mahy\r\nhad brought from Murcia. This turbulent nobleman, more noted for his\r\nintrigues than for his fighting power, was given a general command\r\nover all the bands, and marched to join them with three battalions[41]\r\nand a few guns--the latter provision was intended to obviate the\r\ndifficulty which the irregulars had experienced in October from their\r\nwant of artillery. Blake intended to call up Freire from Murcia with\r\nanother draft from the depleted ‘Third Army,’ whose best troops Mahy\r\nhad already led to Valencia. But, as we shall see, this detachment\r\nwas presently distracted to another quarter, and never joined the\r\nmain force. The nominal strength of the mass of troops along the\r\nGuadalaviar was, however, increased by degrees, owing to the filling\r\nof the ranks of the divisions cut up at Saguntum by men from the\r\nhalf-trained reserve and dépôts. Miranda’s division in particular,\r\nwhich had lost so many prisoners in the battle, was completed to more\r\nthan its original strength by absorbing three raw ‘third battalions’\r\nfrom the ‘Reserve Division,’ besides other drafts[42]. Blake also\r\nendeavoured to make use of ‘urban guards’ and other levies of irregular\r\norganization and more than doubtful value: the population in the north\r\nof the kingdom, behind Suchet’s lines, were invited to form guerrillero\r\nbands: but the Valencians never showed the zeal or energy of the\r\nCatalans and Aragonese. The bands that appeared were few in numbers,\r\nand accomplished nothing of note. Indeed, it appears that the patriotic\r\nspirit of the province had run low. Mahy, in a letter to Blake of\r\nthis month, complains bitterly that the peasantry refuse to convey\r\nletters for him, or even to give him information as to the position\r\nand movements of the French, while he knew that hundreds of them were\r\nvisiting Suchet’s camps daily in friendly fashion[43]. It appears that\r\nthe people were sick of the war, and discontented with Blake, whose\r\nconduct to the local authorities was even more injurious to him than\r\nthe uniform failure of all his military operations.\r\n\r\n  [41] One battalion each of Badajoz, Burgos, and Tiradores de\r\n  Cuenca--under 2,000 men in all.\r\n\r\n  [42] Four thousand strong at Saguntum, it surrendered on January\r\n  8th, 5,513 strong. Of its quality, the less said the better.\r\n\r\n  [43] Mahy to Blake quoted at length in Arteche, xi. p. 196,\r\n  footnote.\r\n\r\nThe diversion to be conducted by Montijo and the irregulars in Aragon\r\nconstituted the only real hope of salvation for Blake and the city of\r\nValencia. But it was, we may say, doomed from the first to failure,\r\nunless some favourable chance should intervene. A couple of thousand\r\nregulars, with the aid of guerrillero bands, hard to assemble, and not\r\nmustering at any time more than 6,000 or 7,000 men collected on one\r\nspot, were sent to paralyse the movements of more than 20,000 French.\r\nFor to that figure Reille’s and Severoli’s divisions, together with\r\nthe original garrison left in Aragon under Musnier, most certainly\r\namounted. It cannot be denied that the diversion gave much trouble to\r\nthe enemy, but it never prevented him from executing any operation of\r\nprimary importance. On October 27th the Italian general, Mazzuchelli,\r\nwith one of Severoli’s brigades, drove off the Empecinado, and relieved\r\nthe long-besieged garrison of Molina, which he brought off, abandoning\r\nthe castle. But as he was returning to his chief, who then lay at\r\nDaroca, the Empecinado fell on his marching column in the Pass of\r\nCubillejo, and inflicted severe damage upon it[44]. Severoli then sent\r\nout a second column of 800 men, to relieve Almunia, on the road to\r\nSaragossa, another outlying garrison. But Duran surprised and scattered\r\nthis party just as it reached its destination, and then captured the\r\nfort with its garrison of 140 men (October 31). This provoked the enemy\r\nto march against him in force, whereupon, after fighting an obstinate\r\nengagement with Mazzuchelli near Almunia, in which the Italians lost\r\n220 men, he turned sideways, and descended upon Daroca, which his\r\nadversary had left weakly manned; he stormed the town and laid siege to\r\nthe fort. This brought down upon him Pannetier, with one of Reille’s\r\nbrigades: thereupon, wisely refusing to fight, Duran went up into the\r\nmountains of Molina (November 1811).\r\n\r\n  [44] For details see Vacani, v. pp. 470-1.\r\n\r\nHere he was joined some weeks later by the regular brigade under the\r\nConde de Montijo, which Blake had sent up from Valencia. This little\r\ndetachment had threaded its way among Reille’s columns, and had\r\nnarrowly escaped destruction near Albarracin. The Conde, assuming chief\r\ncommand at the high-lying village of Mulmarcos, informed the Aragonese\r\nguerrilleros that something desperate must be done, to relieve the\r\npressure on Valencia; and after sending for the Empecinado, who was\r\nnow beyond the mountains, in the province of Guadalajara, marched on\r\nCalatayud. Unfortunately the Partida chiefs, accustomed to conduct\r\ntheir expeditions on their own responsibility, viewed the advent of\r\nMontijo, a stranger of no great military reputation, with jealousy\r\nand dislike. Duran and the Conde having reached Ateca near Calatayud,\r\ncommitted themselves to a serious combat with a column of 2,000 men\r\nfrom its garrison, having every expectation of being succoured by the\r\nEmpecinado, who had reached their neighbourhood. He did not appear,\r\nhowever, and they were repulsed. Thereupon the Spaniards parted, the\r\nConde and the regulars retiring to Torrehermosa, Duran to Deza, in the\r\nprovince of Soria. The Empecinado, when all was over, sent in a letter\r\nin which he explained that he had held off ‘because his officers and\r\nsoldiers had no confidence save in their own chief:’ but it was clear\r\nthat he himself wrecked the expedition out of self-willed indiscipline.\r\n\r\nThe month of December was now far advanced, and nothing effective\r\nhad been done to help Blake. The Aragonese bands had cost Reille and\r\nSeveroli many toilsome marches, and had inflicted on them appreciable\r\nlosses--Severoli’s division was now 2,000 men weaker than it had\r\nbeen in September. But they had failed entirely to stop the larger\r\nmovements of the enemy, who was able to move wherever he pleased with\r\na column of 3,000 men, though any lesser force was always in danger of\r\nbeing harried or even destroyed. When Suchet determined that he would\r\nagain risk trouble in his rear, and would bring both the divisions\r\nfrom the Ebro down to Valencia, no one could prevent him from doing\r\nso. It is true that Severoli and Reille were leaving behind them a\r\ncountry-side still infested by an active and obstinate enemy. But if\r\ntheir generalissimo judged that he was prepared to take this risk, and\r\nwas determined to crush Blake before he completed the subjugation of\r\nUpper Aragon, there was nothing that could hinder him from carrying out\r\nhis intention. By the middle of December Severoli was on his way to\r\nthe Guadalaviar by way of Teruel, and Reille followed not far behind,\r\nthough one of his brigades (Bourke’s) had been distracted, by being\r\nordered to conduct the prisoners from Saguntum to the French frontier,\r\nand the other (Pannetier’s) had been drawn so far northward in hunting\r\nMontijo and Duran that it was several marches behind the leading\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, Reille and Severoli alone who were set in motion\r\nfor the ruin of Blake and Valencia. Nor was Suchet’s mind the final\r\ncontrolling force of the operations which were to spread all over\r\neastern Spain in the months of December 1811 and January 1812. The\r\nEmperor, when he hurried the Army of Aragon forward in September, had\r\nexplained that this was the crucial point of the war, and repeated in\r\nNovember that ‘l’important, dans ce moment, est la prise de Valence.’\r\nPortugal could wait--Wellington, with 18,000 men sick, and forced to\r\nremain on the defensive,--was a negligible quantity during the winter:\r\nhe should be dealt with in the spring by a general combination of\r\nall the French armies[45]. Acting on this comfortable but erroneous\r\nhypothesis, Napoleon determined to shift eastward and southward not\r\nonly Reille and Severoli, but other troops from the armies which were\r\ndirectly or indirectly opposed to Wellington, so as to alter for a\r\ntime the general balance of forces on the Portuguese side of the\r\nPeninsula. On October 18th, before the battle of Saguntum had been\r\nfought and won, Berthier had been directed to write to Marmont that,\r\nfor the support of the invasion of Valencia, King Joseph and the Army\r\nof the Centre would be ordered to send troops to Cuenca, to take Blake\r\nin the rear. In consequence the Army of Portugal must ‘facilitate the\r\ntask of the King,’ i. e. find detachments to occupy those parts of New\r\nCastile from which Joseph would have to withdraw the normal garrison\r\nfor his expedition to Cuenca. But presently it became evident that the\r\nArmy of the Centre would have great difficulty in providing a column\r\nstrong enough to make this diversion, even if it were relieved in La\r\nMancha, or the province of Toledo, by units belonging to Marmont.\r\nNapoleon then made the all-important determination to borrow troops\r\nfrom the Army of Portugal for the Valencian expedition. By this time\r\nhe knew of the battle of Saguntum, and had received Suchet’s appeals\r\nfor reinforcements. His dispatch to Marmont of November 20th informs\r\nthe Marshal that he must provide a division of 6,000 men of all arms,\r\nto join the disposable force which King Joseph can spare for the\r\nassistance of Suchet. The still more important dispatch of the next day\r\nvaried the orders in an essential detail, by saying that the Marshal\r\nmust send not ‘a detachment of 6,000 men’ but _such a force as, united\r\nto the column supplied by King Joseph, would provide a total of 12,000\r\nmen for the diversion_.’ And it was added that, in addition, the Army\r\nof Portugal would have to find 3,000 or 4,000 men more, to keep up the\r\ncommunications of the expeditionary force with its base in New Castile.\r\nThe detachment might be made without any fear of adverse consequences,\r\nsince Wellington had 20,000 men in hospital, and barely as many in\r\na state to take the field, so no risk would be run in depleting the\r\nforce opposed to him [46]. Napoleon, conveniently ignoring the exact\r\nwording of his own dispatch, reproached Marmont (when evil results had\r\nfollowed) for having detached ‘an army corps and thirty guns’ for the\r\ndiversion, instead of ‘a light flying column.[47]’ But it will be seen\r\nthat the Marshal was literally obeying the orders given him when he\r\nmoved 12,000 men towards Valencia. For the Army of the Centre provided\r\nnot much more than 3,000 men under General d’Armagnac for the Cuenca\r\nexpedition[48], and Marmont had, therefore, to find 9,000 men to bring\r\nit up to the strength which the Emperor prescribed, as well as the\r\n3,000-4,000 men to cover the line of communications.\r\n\r\n  [45] _Correspondance de Napoléon_, 18,267, and cf. pp. 590-2 of\r\n  vol. iv of this work.\r\n\r\n  [46] See these dispatches printed in full in Marmont’s\r\n  _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 256-8. This wording is most important and\r\n  should be studied with care. Note that Wellington’s sick have\r\n  gone up from 18,000 to 20,000 in twenty-four hours, to oblige the\r\n  Emperor.\r\n\r\n  [47] Berthier to Marmont, January 23, 1812. Printed in the\r\n  latter’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 297-9.\r\n\r\n  [48] Though King Joseph had said that if Marmont took over the\r\n  whole of La Mancha, he could then reinforce d’Armagnac up to\r\n  8,000 men. This he never really accomplished (Joseph to Berthier,\r\n  Nov. 26).\r\n\r\nAll these dispatches reached Marmont’s head-quarters at Plasencia with\r\nthe tardiness that was normal in Spain, where officers bearing orders\r\nhad to be escorted by detachments many hundreds strong, supposing\r\nthat their certain arrival at their destination was desired. If they\r\ntravelled rapidly and unescorted, they became the inevitable prey of\r\nthe guerrilleros. The dispatch of October 18th, saying that Marmont\r\nmust replace King Joseph’s garrisons in La Mancha, came to hand on\r\nNovember 11, and the Marshal accordingly directed Foy’s division, then\r\nat Toledo, to break itself up and occupy the various posts which the\r\nGerman division of the Army of the Centre had been holding. Foy set out\r\nto fulfil these orders on November 22.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s second and third dispatches, those of November 20-21st,\r\nturned up on December 13th[49], and Marmont found himself under orders\r\nto find 9,000 men for the Cuenca expedition,--since d’Armagnac had\r\nonly 3,000 men to contribute--and in addition 3,000-4,000 more for\r\nthe line of communications. Now the Marshal was as fully convinced\r\nas his master that Wellington was not in a condition to move, or to\r\ndo any serious harm, and under this impression, and being probably\r\nstirred (as Napoleon afterwards remarked)[50] by the desire to increase\r\nhis own reputation by a dashing feat of arms, he resolved to take\r\ncharge of the expedition in person. He ordered that the divisions\r\nof Foy and Sarrut--both weak units, the one of eight, the other of\r\nnine battalions[51]--and Montbrun’s light cavalry should prepare to\r\nmarch under his own charge to join d’Armagnac, and move on Valencia.\r\nAnother division should come into La Mancha to take up the cantonments\r\nevacuated by Foy, and keep over the line of communications. Clausel\r\nshould be left in charge of the remainder of the army, and observe\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\n  [49] Date fixed by Marmont’s letter to Berthier of Feb. 6.\r\n\r\n  [50] ‘Sa Majesté (writes Berthier) pense que, dans cette\r\n  circonstance, vous avez plus calculé votre gloire personnelle que\r\n  le bien de son service,’ Jan. 23, letter quoted above on the last\r\n  page.\r\n\r\n  [51] Each division had about 4,000 or 4,500 men: the light\r\n  cavalry about 1,700, so the whole would have made about 10,000\r\n  sabres and bayonets.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was never carried out, for on December 20 Marmont received\r\nanother dispatch, ordering him to transfer his head-quarters to\r\nValladolid, and to move a large part of his army into Old Castile. Of\r\nthis more hereafter. But being thus prevented (for his own good fortune\r\nas it turned out) from going on the expedition, he gave over Foy’s and\r\nSarrut’s divisions to Montbrun, and bade him execute the diversion. He\r\nhimself went, as ordered, to Valladolid. If he had received the last\r\ndispatch a little later, or had started a little earlier, he would have\r\nbeen put in the ignominious position of being absent from his own point\r\nof danger, when Wellington suddenly struck at Ciudad Rodrigo in the\r\nearly days of January.\r\n\r\nMontbrun, his substitute, had drawn together his forces in La Mancha by\r\nthe 29th of December, but receiving from d’Armagnac, who was already\r\non the move with 3,000 men, the assurance that the road from Cuenca to\r\nValencia was practically impassable at midwinter, and that he could\r\ncertainly get no guns along it, he resolved to take another route\r\ntowards the scene of active operations. Accordingly he set out to march\r\nby the road San Clemente, Chinchilla, Almanza, which runs across the\r\nupland plain of La Mancha and Northern Murcia, and does not cross rough\r\nground till it nears the descent to the sea-coast on the borders of\r\nValencia. The column did not leave San Clemente and El Probencio till\r\nJanuary 2, and (as we shall see) was too late to help Suchet, who had\r\nbrought matters to a head long before it drew near him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile d’Armagnac, though his force was trifling[52], had been of\r\nfar greater use. He had reoccupied Cuenca, but finding (as he had\r\ninformed Montbrun) that the roads in that direction were impracticable,\r\nhad swerved southward, avoiding the mountains, and getting to Tarazona\r\nin La Mancha, marched towards the passes of the Cabriel River, and the\r\nroad on to Valencia by way of Requeña. His approach being reported to\r\nBlake, who had no troops in this direction save two battalions under\r\nBassecourt, the Captain-General was seized with a natural disquietude\r\nas to his rear, for he had no accurate knowledge of the French\r\nstrength. Wherefore he directed General Freire, with the succours which\r\nhe had been intending to draw up from Murcia, to abandon the idea of\r\nreinforcing the main army, and to throw himself between d’Armagnac and\r\nValencia [November 20]. The French general, beating the country on\r\nall sides, and thrusting before him Bassecourt’s small force and the\r\nlocal guerrilleros, marched as far as Yniesta, and forced the passage\r\nof the Cabriel at Valdecañas, but finding that he had got far away\r\nfrom Montbrun, who did not march till many days after he himself had\r\nstarted, and being informed that Freire, with a very large force, was\r\ncoming in upon his rear, he stopped before reaching Requeña and turned\r\nback towards La Mancha[53]. He had succeeded, however, in preventing\r\nFreire from reinforcing Valencia, and the Murcian succours never got\r\nnear to Blake. He even for a time distracted troops from the main\r\nSpanish army, for Zayas was sent for some days to Requeña, and only\r\nreturned just in time for the operations that began on December 25th.\r\nThe net outcome, therefore, of Montbrun’s and d’Armagnac’s operations\r\nwas simply to distract Freire’s division from Valencia at the critical\r\nmoment--an appreciable but not a decisive result.\r\n\r\n  [52] Apparently four or five battalions of the German division\r\n  gathered from La Mancha, and a brigade of dragoons. Joseph calls\r\n  it in his _Correspondance_ 3,000 men, when describing this\r\n  operation (Joseph to Berthier, Nov. 12, 1811).\r\n\r\n  [53] D’Armagnac’s obscure campaign will be found chronicled\r\n  in detail in the narrative of the Baden officer, Riegel, iii.\r\n  pp. 357-60, who shared in it along with the rest of the German\r\n  division from La Mancha.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Suchet found himself able to deliver his decisive blow on the\r\nGuadalaviar. By his orders Severoli and Reille had drawn southward by\r\nway of Teruel, deliberately abandoning most of Aragon to the mercy of\r\nthe insurgent bands; for though Caffarelli had moved some battalions\r\nof the Army of the North to Saragossa and the posts along the Ebro,\r\nthe rest of the province was left most inadequately guarded by the\r\nsmall force that had originally been committed to Musnier’s charge,\r\nwhen first Suchet marched on Valencia. Musnier himself accompanied\r\nSeveroli’s division, leaving his detachments under Caffarelli’s orders,\r\nfor he had been directed to come to the front and assume the command\r\nof his old brigades, those of Ficatier and Robert, both now with the\r\nmain army. When Reille and the Italians marched south, Aragon was\r\nexposed to the inroads of Montijo, Duran, the Empecinado, and Mina,\r\nall of whom had been harried, but by no means crushed, by the late\r\nmarches and countermarches of the French. That trouble would ensue both\r\nNapoleon and Suchet were well aware. But the Emperor had made up his\r\nmind that all other considerations were to be postponed to the capture\r\nof Valencia and the destruction of Blake’s army. When these ends were\r\nachieved, not only Reille and Severoli, but other troops as well,\r\nshould be drawn northwards, to complete the pacification of Aragon, and\r\nto make an end of the lingering war in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nSeveroli had reached Teruel on November 30, but was ordered to await\r\nthe junction of Reille’s troops, and these were still far off. Indeed\r\nReille himself only started from Saragossa with Bourke’s brigade on\r\nDecember 10th, and Pannetier’s brigade (which had been hunting Duran in\r\nthe mountains) was two long marches farther behind. Without waiting for\r\nits junction, Severoli and Reille marched from Teruel on December 20th,\r\nand reached Segorbe unopposed on the 24th. Here they were in close\r\ntouch with Suchet, and received orders to make a forced march to join\r\nhim, as he intended to attack the lines of the Guadalaviar on the 26th.\r\nTo them was allotted the most important move in the game, for they were\r\nto cross the Guadalaviar high up, beyond the westernmost of Blake’s\r\nlong string of batteries and earthworks, and to turn his flank and get\r\nin his rear, while the Army of Aragon assailed his front, and held him\r\nnailed to his positions by a series of vigorous attacks. The point on\r\nwhich Reille and Severoli were to march was Ribaroja, fifteen miles\r\nup-stream from Valencia.\r\n\r\nWhen the two divisions from Aragon should have arrived, Suchet could\r\ncount on 33,000 men in line, but as Pannetier was still labouring up\r\ntwo marches in the rear, it was really with 30,000 only that he struck\r\nhis blow--a force exceeding that which Blake possessed by not more\r\nthan 6,000 or 7,000 bayonets. Considering the strength of the Spanish\r\nfortifications the task looked hazardous: but Suchet was convinced,\r\nand rightly, that the greater part of the Army of Valencia was still\r\nso much demoralized that much might be dared against it: and the event\r\nproved him wise.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 25th all the divisions of the Army of Aragon\r\nhad abandoned their cantonments, and advanced towards the Spanish\r\nlines--Habert on the left next the sea; Palombini to the west of\r\nValencia, opposite the village of Mislata; Harispe and Musnier farther\r\nup-stream, opposite Quarte. The cavalry accompanied this last column.\r\nReille and Severoli, on their arrival, were to form the extreme\r\nright of the line, and would extend far beyond the last Spanish\r\nentrenchments. The weak Neapolitan division alone (now not much over\r\n1,000 strong) was to keep quiet, occupying the entrenched position in\r\nthe suburb of Serranos, which faced the city of Valencia. Its only duty\r\nwas to hold on to its works, in case Blake should try a sortie at this\r\nspot, with the purpose of breaking the French line in two. That such\r\na weak force was left to discharge such an important function, is a\r\nsufficient proof of Suchet’s belief in Blake’s incapacity to take the\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nThe lines which the French were about to assail were rather long than\r\nstrong, despite of the immense amount of labour that had been lavished\r\non them during the last three months. Their extreme right, on the side\r\nof the sea, and by the mouth of the Guadalaviar was a redoubt (named\r\nafter the Lazaretto hard by) commanding the estuary: from thence a\r\nlong line of earthworks continued the defences as far as the slight\r\nhill of Monte Oliveto, which guarded the right flank of the great\r\nentrenched camp of which the city formed the nucleus. Here there was\r\na fort outside the walls, and connected with them by a ditch and a\r\nbastioned line of earthworks, reaching as far as the citadel at the\r\nnorth-east corner of the town. From thence the line of resistance\r\nfor some way was formed of the mediaeval wall of Valencia itself,\r\nthirty feet high and ten thick. It was destitute of a parapet broad\r\nenough to bear guns: but the Spaniards had built up against its back,\r\nat irregular distances, scaffolding of heavy beams, and terraces of\r\nearth, on which a certain amount of cannon were mounted. The gates were\r\nprotected by small advanced works, mounting artillery. Blake had made\r\nValencia and its three outlying southern and western suburbs of Ruzafa,\r\nSan Vincente, and Quarte into a single place of defence, by building\r\naround those suburbs a great line of earthworks and batteries. It was\r\nan immense work consisting of bastioned entrenchments provided with\r\na ditch eighteen feet deep, and filled in some sections with water.\r\nFrom the city the line of defence along the river continued as far\r\nas the village of Manises, with an unbroken series of earthworks and\r\nbatteries. The Guadalaviar itself formed an outer obstacle, being a\r\nstream running through low and marshy ground, and diverted into many\r\nwater-cuts for purposes of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe continuous line of defences from the sea as far as Manises was\r\nabout eight miles long. It possessed some outworks on the farther bank\r\nof the Guadalaviar, three of the five bridges which lead from Valencia\r\nnorthward having been left standing by Blake, with good _têtes-de-pont_\r\nto protect them from Suchet’s attacks. Thus the Spaniards had the\r\npower to debouch on to the French side of the river at any time that\r\nthey pleased. This fact added difficulties to the projected attack\r\nwhich the Marshal was planning.\r\n\r\nThe troops behind the lines of the Guadalaviar consisted of some\r\n23,000 regulars, with a certain amount of local urban guards and\r\narmed peasantry whose number it is impossible to estimate with any\r\nprecision--probably they gave some 3,000 muskets more, but their\r\nfighting value was almost negligible. The right of the line, near\r\nthe sea, was entirely made over to these levies of doubtful value.\r\nMiranda’s division manned the fort of Monte Oliveto and the whole north\r\nfront of the city. Lardizabal garrisoned the earthworks from the end of\r\nthe town wall as far as the village of Mislata. This last place and its\r\nworks fell to the charge of Zayas. Creagh’s Murcians were on Zayas’s\r\nleft at Quarte: finally the western wing of the army was formed by\r\nthe Valencian divisions of Obispo and Villacampa; holding San Onofre\r\nand Manises, where the fortifications ended. The whole of the cavalry\r\nwas placed so as to cover the left rear of the lines, at Aldaya and\r\nTorrente. A few battalions of the raw ‘Reserve Division’ were held in\r\nthe city as a central reserve. The arrangements of Blake seem liable\r\nto grave criticism, since he placed his two good and solid divisions,\r\nthose of Lardizabal and Zayas, in the strongest works in the centre of\r\nhis line, but entrusted his left flank, where a turning movement by\r\nthe French might most easily take place, to the demoralized battalions\r\nof Villacampa and Obispo, who had a consistent record of rout and\r\ndisaster behind them. It is clear that lines, however long, can always\r\nbe turned, unless their ends rest, as did those of Torres Vedras, on\r\nan impassable obstacle such as the sea. If the French should refuse\r\nto attack the works in front, and should march up the Guadalaviar to\r\nfar beyond the last battery, it would be impossible to prevent them\r\nfrom crossing, all the more so because, after Manises, the network of\r\ncanals and water-cuts, which makes the passage difficult in the lower\r\ncourse of the river, comes to an end, and the only obstacle exposed to\r\nthe invader is a single stream of no great depth. Blake, therefore,\r\nshould have seen that the critical point was the extreme west end of\r\nhis lines, and should have placed there his best troops instead of his\r\nworst. Moreover he appears to have had no proper system of outposts\r\nof either cavalry or infantry along the upper stream, for (as we\r\nshall see) the first passage of the French was made not only without\r\nopposition, but without any alarm being given. Yet there were 2,000\r\nSpanish cavalry only a few miles away, at Torrente and Aldaya.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s plan of attack, which he carried out the moment that Reille\r\njoined him, and even before the latter’s rearmost brigade had got up\r\ninto line, was a very ambitious one, aiming not merely at the forcing\r\nof the Guadalaviar or the investment of Valencia, but at the trapping\r\nof the whole Spanish army. It was conducted on such a broad front, and\r\nwith such a dispersion of the forces into isolated columns, that it\r\nargued a supreme contempt for Blake and his generalship. Used against\r\nsuch a general as Wellington it would have led to dreadful disaster.\r\nBut Suchet knew his adversary.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the plan was the circumventing of the Spanish lines by two\r\ncolumns which, starting one above and the other below Valencia, were\r\nto cross the river and join hands to the south of the city. Meanwhile\r\nthe main front of the works was to be threatened (and if circumstances\r\nfavoured, attacked) by a very small fraction of the French army. Near\r\nthe sea Habert’s division was to force the comparatively weak line of\r\nworks at the estuary, and then to cut the road which runs from Valencia\r\nbetween the Mediterranean and the great lagoon of the Albufera. Far\r\ninland the main striking force of the army, composed of the divisions\r\nof Harispe and Musnier, with all the cavalry, and with Reille’s three\r\nbrigades following close behind, was to pass the Guadalaviar at\r\nRibaroja, three or four miles above Manises, and from thence to extend\r\nalong the south front of the Spanish lines, take them in the rear, and\r\npush on so as to get into touch with Habert. Compère’s weak Neapolitan\r\nbrigade was to block the bridge-heads out of which Blake might make\r\na sally northward. Palombini’s Italians were to press close up to\r\nMislata, which Suchet judged to be the weakest point in the Spanish\r\nlines, and to deliver against it an attack which was to be pushed more\r\nor less home as circumstances might dictate. The whole force employed\r\n(not counting Pannetier’s brigade, which had not yet joined Reille)\r\nwas just 30,000 men. Of these 25,000 were employed in the flanking\r\nmovements; less than 5,000 were left to demonstrate against Blake’s\r\nfront along the lines of the Guadalaviar.\r\n\r\nThe main and decisive blow was of course to be delivered by Harispe,\r\nMusnier, and Reille, who were to cross the river at a point where the\r\nSpaniards were unlikely to make any serious opposition, since it was\r\noutside their chosen ground of defence, and was clearly watched rather\r\nthan held. If 20,000 men crossed here, and succeeded in establishing\r\nthemselves south of Valencia by a rapid march, Blake would find his\r\nlines useless, and would be forced to fight in the open, in order to\r\nsecure a retreat southward, or else to shut himself and his whole force\r\nup in the entrenched camp around the city. Suchet could accept either\r\nalternative with equanimity: a battle, as he judged, meant a victory,\r\nthe breaking up of the Spanish army and the capture of Valencia. If,\r\non the other hand, Blake refused to fight a general engagement, and\r\nretired within his camp, it would lead to his being surrounded, and\r\nthe desired end would only be deferred for a few days. There were only\r\ntwo dangers--one was that the Spanish general might abscond southward\r\nwith the bulk of his army, without fighting, the moment that he heard\r\nthat his enemy was across the Guadalaviar. The second was that, waiting\r\ntill the French main body was committed to its flank march, he might\r\nbreak out northward by the three bridges in his hands, overwhelm the\r\nNeapolitans, and escape towards Liria and Segorbe into the mountains.\r\nSuchet judged that his enemy would try neither of these courses; he\r\nwould not be timid enough to retreat on the instant that he learnt that\r\nhis left wing was beginning to be turned; nor would he be resourceful\r\nenough to strike away northward, as soon as he saw that the turning\r\nmovement was formidable and certain of success. Herein Suchet judged\r\naright.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall on the 25th-26th of December two hundred hussars, each\r\ncarrying a voltigeur behind him, forded the Guadalaviar at Ribaroja,\r\nand threw out a chain of posts which brushed off a few Spanish cavalry\r\nvedettes. The moment that the farther bank was clear, the whole force\r\nof Suchet’s engineers set to work to build two trestle-bridges for\r\ninfantry, and to lay a solid pontoon bridge higher up for guns and\r\ncavalry. A few hours later Harispe’s division began to pass--then\r\nMusnier’s, lastly Boussard’s cavalry. The defile took a long time,\r\nand even by dawn Reille’s three brigades had not arrived or begun to\r\npass. But by that time ten thousand French were over the river. The\r\nSpanish vedettes had reported, both to their cavalry generals at Aldaya\r\nand to Blake at Valencia, that the enemy was busy at Ribaroja, but\r\nhad not been able to judge of his force, or to make out that he was\r\nconstructing bridges. Their commanders resolved that nothing could\r\nbe done in the dark, and that the morning light would determine the\r\ncharacter of the movement[54].\r\n\r\n  [54] So Suchet’s narrative (_Mémoires_, ii. pp. 214-15). Belmas\r\n  says that only one bridge was finished when Harispe and Musnier\r\n  passed--the others after dawn only.\r\n\r\nThe late December sun soon showed the situation. Harispe’s division\r\nwas marching on Torrente, to cut the high-road to Murcia. The cavalry\r\nand one brigade of Musnier were preparing to follow: the other brigade\r\nof the second division (Robert’s) was standing fast by the bridges, to\r\ncover them till Reille should appear and cross. But while this was the\r\nmost weighty news brought to Blake, he was distracted by intelligence\r\nfrom two other quarters. Habert was clearly seen coming down by the\r\nseaside, to attack at the estuary; and Palombini was also approaching\r\nin the centre, in front of Mislata. The daylight was the signal for the\r\ncommencement of skirmishing on each of the three far-separated points.\r\nBlake, strange as it may appear, made up his mind at first that the\r\nreal danger lay on the side next the sea, and that Habert’s column was\r\nthe main striking force[55]. But when it became clear that this wing\r\nof the French army was not very strong, and was coming on slowly, he\r\nturned his attention to Palombini, whose attack on Mislata was made\r\nearly, and was conducted in a vigorous style. It was to this point that\r\nhe finally rode out from the city, and he took up his position behind\r\nZayas, entirely neglecting the turning movement on his left--apparently\r\nbecause it was out of sight, and he could not make the right deduction\r\nfrom the reports which his cavalry had brought him.\r\n\r\n  [55] For Blake’s opinions and actions see the record of his\r\n  staff-officer, Schepeler (pp. 502-3).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Harispe’s column, pushing forward with the object of\r\nreaching the high-road from Valencia to Murcia, the natural route\r\nfor Blake’s army to take, if it should attempt to escape southward,\r\nran into the main body of the Spanish horse, which was assembling in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the village of Aldaya. The French infantry were\r\npreceded by a squadron of hussars, who were accompanied by General\r\nBoussard, the commander of Suchet’s cavalry division. This small force\r\nwas suddenly encompassed and cut up by several regiments of Martin\r\nCarrera’s brigade. Boussard was overthrown and left for dead--his sword\r\nand decorations were stripped from his body. But more French squadrons\r\nbegan to come up, and Harispe’s infantry opened fire on the Spaniards,\r\nwho were soon forced to retire hurriedly--they rode off southward\r\ntowards the Xucar river. They were soon completely out of touch with\r\nthe rest of Blake’s army.\r\n\r\nHarispe’s column then continued its way, sweeping eastward towards the\r\nMurcian _chaussée_ in the manner that Suchet had designed; but the rest\r\nof the operations of the French right wing were not so decisive as its\r\ncommander had hoped. Mahy, learning of the movement of the encircling\r\ncolumn, and seeing Robert’s brigade massed opposite the extreme flank\r\nof his position at Manises, while some notice of Reille’s near approach\r\nalso came to hand, suddenly resolved that he would not be surrounded,\r\nand abandoned all his lines before they were seriously attacked. He\r\nhad the choice of directing Villacampa and Obispo to retire towards\r\nValencia and join Blake for a serious battle in the open, or of bidding\r\nthem strike off southward and eastward, and escape towards the Xucar,\r\nabandoning the main body of the army. He chose the second alternative,\r\nand marched off parallel with Harispe’s threatening column, directing\r\neach brigade to get away as best it could. His force at once broke up\r\ninto several fractions, for the cross-roads were many and perplexing.\r\nSome regiments reached the Murcian _chaussée_ before Harispe, and\r\nescaped in front of him, pursued by the French cavalry. Others, coming\r\ntoo late, were forced to forgo this obvious line of retreat, and to\r\nstruggle still farther eastward, only turning south when they got\r\nto the marshy borders of the lagoon of Albufera. Obispo, with 2,000\r\nof his men, was so closely hunted by the hostile cavalry that he\r\nbarely found safety by striking along the narrow strip of soft ground\r\nbetween the lagoon and the sea. On the morning of the 27th he struggled\r\nthrough to Cullera near the mouth of the Xucar: Mahy, with the greater\r\npart of Villacampa’s division and some of Obispo’s and Creagh’s,\r\narrived somewhat earlier at Alcira, higher up the same stream, where\r\nhe found the fugitive cavalry already established. The divisions were\r\nmuch disorganized, but they had lost very few killed or wounded, and\r\nnot more than 500 prisoners. Mahy rallied some 4,000 or 5,000 men at\r\nAlcira, and Obispo a couple of thousand at Cullera, but they were a\r\n‘spent force,’ not fit for action. Many of the raw troops had disbanded\r\nthemselves and gone home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VALENCIA The Siege (Dec 1811-Jan 1812)]\r\n\r\nThus three-sevenths of Blake’s army were separated from Valencia\r\nand their Commander-in-Chief without having made any appreciable\r\nresistance. But it seems doubtful whether Mahy should be blamed--if he\r\nhad waited an hour longer in his positions his whole corps might have\r\nbeen captured. If he had retired towards Valencia he would have been,\r\nin all probability, forced to surrender with the rest of the army a\r\nfew days later. And in separating himself from his chief he had the\r\nexcuse that he knew that Blake’s intention had been to retire towards\r\nthe Xucar if beaten, not to shut himself up in Valencia. He may have\r\nexpected that the rest of the army would follow him southward, and\r\nBlake (as we shall see) probably had the chance of executing that\r\nmovement, though he did not seize it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the progress of the engagement in other quarters must be\r\ndetailed. Palombini made a serious attempt to break through the left\r\ncentre of the Spanish lines at Mislata. His task was hard, not so\r\nmuch because of the entrenchments, or of the difficulty of crossing\r\nthe Guadalaviar, which was fordable for infantry, but from the many\r\nmuddy canals and water-cuts with which the ground in front of him\r\nabounded. These, though not impassable for infantry, prevented guns\r\nfrom getting to the front till bridges should have been made for\r\nthem. The Italians waded through the first canal, and then through\r\nthe river, but were brought to a stand by the second canal, that of\r\nFabara, behind which the Spanish entrenchments lay. After a furious\r\nfire-contest they had to retire as far as the river, under whose bank\r\nmany sought refuge--some plunged in and waded back to the farther side.\r\nPalombini rallied them and delivered a second attack; but at only one\r\npoint, to the left of Mislata, did the assault break into the Spanish\r\nline. Zayas, aided by a battalion or two which Mahy had sent up from\r\nQuarte, vindicated his position, and repulsed the attack with heavy\r\nloss. But when the news came from the left that Harispe had turned the\r\nlines, and when Mahy’s troops were seen evacuating all their positions\r\nand hurrying off, Zayas found himself with his left flank completely\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nBlake made some attempt to form a line _en potence_ to Zayas’s\r\nentrenchments, directing two or three of Creagh’s battalions from\r\nQuarte and some of his reserve from the city to make a stand at the\r\nvillage of Chirivella. But the front was never formed--attacked by some\r\nof Musnier’s troops these detachments broke up, Creagh’s men flying to\r\nfollow Mahy, and the others retiring to the entrenched camp.\r\n\r\nThereupon Blake ordered Zayas and Lardizabal, who lay to his right, to\r\nretreat into Valencia before they should be turned by the approaching\r\nFrench. The movement was accomplished in order and at leisure, and all\r\nthe guns in and about the Mislata entrenchments were brought away.\r\nPalombini had been too hardly handled to attempt to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe General-in-Chief seemed stunned by the suddenness of the disaster.\r\n‘He looked like a man of stone,’ says Schepeler, who rode at his side,\r\n‘when any observation was made to him he made no reply, and he could\r\ncome to no decision. He would not allow Zayas to fight, and when a\r\ncolonel (the author of this work) suggested at the commencement of\r\nthe retreat that it would be well to burn certain houses which lay\r\ndangerously close to the entrenched camp, he kept silence. Whereupon\r\nZayas observed in bitter rage to this officer: “Truly you are dull,\r\nmy German friend; do you not see that you cannot wake the man up?”’\r\nAccording to the narratives of several contemporaries there would still\r\nhave been time at this moment to direct the retreating column southward\r\nand escape, as Obispo did, along the Albufera. For Habert (as we shall\r\nsee) had been much slower than Harispe in his turning movement by the\r\nside of the Mediterranean. Some, among them Schepeler, suggest that\r\nthe whole garrison might have broken out by the northern bridges and\r\ngot away. For Palombini was not in a condition to hinder them, and the\r\nNeapolitans in front of the bridge-heads were but a handful of 1,200\r\nmen. But the General, still apparently unconscious of what was going on\r\nabout him, drew back into the entrenched camp, and did no more.\r\n\r\nHabert, meanwhile, finally completed his movement, and joined hands\r\nwith Harispe at last. His lateness was to be accounted for not by the\r\nstrength of the opposition made by the irregular troops in front of\r\nhim, but by the fact that his advance had been much hindered by the\r\nfire of the flotilla lying off the mouth of the Guadalaviar. Here\r\nthere was a swarm of gunboats supported by a British 74 and a frigate.\r\nHabert would not commence his passage till he had driven them away, by\r\nplacing a battery of sixteen siege-guns on the shore near the Grao.\r\nAfter much firing the squadron sheered off[56], and about midday the\r\nFrench division crossed the Guadalaviar, partly by fording, partly\r\non a hastily constructed bridge, and attacked the line of scattered\r\nworks defended by irregulars which lay behind. The Spaniards were\r\nsuccessively evicted from all of them, as far as the fort of Monte\r\nOliveto. Miranda’s division kept within the entrenched camp, and gave\r\nno assistance to the bands without; but it was late afternoon before\r\nHabert had accomplished his task, and finally got into touch with\r\nHarispe.\r\n\r\n  [56] Napier says (iv. p. 30) that the gunboats fled without\r\n  firing a shot. Suchet and Schepeler speak of much firing, as does\r\n  Arteche.\r\n\r\nBlake was thus shut up in Valencia with the divisions of Miranda,\r\nZayas, and Lardizabal, and what was left of his raw reserve battalions:\r\naltogether some 17,000 fighting-men remained with him. The loss in\r\nactual fighting had been very small--about 500 killed and wounded\r\nand as many prisoners. The French captured a good many guns in the\r\nevacuated works and a single standard. Suchet returned his total\r\ncasualties at 521 officers and men, of whom no less than 50 killed\r\nand 355 wounded were among Palombini’s Italians--the only corps which\r\ncan be said to have done any serious fighting[57]. The Marshal’s\r\nstrategical combination would have been successful almost without\r\nbloodshed, if only Palombini had not pressed his attack so hard, and\r\nwith so little necessity. But the Spanish army, which was drawn out on\r\na long front of nine miles, without any appreciable central reserve,\r\nand with no protection for its exposed flank, was doomed to ruin the\r\nmoment that the enemy appeared in overwhelming force, beyond and behind\r\nits extreme left wing. Blake’s only chance was to have watched every\r\nford with great vigilance, and to have had a strong flying column of\r\nhis best troops ready in some central position, from which it could be\r\nmoved out to dispute Suchet’s passage without a moment’s delay. Far\r\nfrom doing this, he tied down his two veteran divisions to the defence\r\nof the strongest part of his lines, watched the fords with nothing but\r\ncavalry vedettes, and kept no central reserve at all, save 2,000 or\r\n3,000 men of his untrustworthy ‘Reserve Division.’ In face of these\r\ndispositions the French were almost bound to be successful. A disaster\r\nwas inevitable, but Blake might have made it somewhat less ruinous if\r\nhe had recognized his real position promptly, and had ordered a general\r\nretreat, when Harispe’s successful turning movement became evident. In\r\nthis case he would have lost Valencia, but not his army.\r\n\r\n  [57] No less than three of the Italian colonels were hit, and\r\n  thirty-four officers in all.\r\n\r\nAs it was, a week more saw the miserable end of the campaign. Suchet’s\r\nfirst precaution was to ascertain whether there was any danger from\r\nthe fraction of the Spanish army which Mahy and Obispo had carried\r\noff. He was uncertain how strong they were, and whether they were\r\nprepared to attack him in the rear, supposing that he should sit down\r\nto the siege of Valencia. Accordingly he sent out at dawn on the 26th\r\nDecember two light columns of cavalry and voltigeurs against Alcira\r\nand Cullera, whither he knew that the refugees had retired. These two\r\nreconnaissances in force discovered the enemy in position, but the\r\nmoment that they were descried Mahy retreated towards Alcoy, and Obispo\r\ntowards Alicante--both in such haste and disorder that it was evident\r\nthat they had no fighting spirit left in them.\r\n\r\nSuchet, therefore, was soon relieved of any fear of danger from this\r\nside, and could make his arrangements for the siege. He sent back to\r\nthe north bank of the Guadalaviar the whole division of Musnier, which\r\nwas there joined three days later by Reille’s belated brigade, that of\r\nPannetier. Harispe, Habert, Severoli, and Reille’s other French brigade\r\n(that of Bourke) formed the investment on the southern bank. Palombini\r\nlay astride of the river near Mislata, with one brigade on each bank.\r\nThe whole force of 33,000 men was sufficient for the task before it.\r\nThe decisive blow would have to be given by the siege artillery; the\r\nwhole train which had captured Saguntum had long been ready for its\r\nwork. And it had before it not regular fortifications of modern type,\r\nbut, in part of the circumference of Blake’s position, mediaeval walls\r\nnot built to resist artillery, in the rest the ditch and bank of the\r\nentrenched camp, which, though strong as a field-work, could not be\r\nconsidered capable of resisting a formal attack by a strong siege-train.\r\n\r\nBlake was as well aware of this as Suchet, and he also knew (what\r\nSuchet could not) that the population of 100,000 souls under his charge\r\nhad only 10 days’ provision of flour and 19 or 20 of rice and salt\r\nfish. The city, like the army, had been living on daily convoys from\r\nthe south, and had no great central reserves of food. If he should sit\r\ndown, like Palafox at Saragossa, to make an obstinate defence behind\r\nimprovised works, he would be on the edge of starvation in less than\r\nthree weeks. But such a defence was impossible in face of the spirit\r\nof the people, who looked upon Blake as the author of all their woes,\r\nregarded him as a tyrant as well as an imbecile, and were as likely to\r\nrise against him as to turn their energies to resisting the French.\r\nPalafox at Saragossa accomplished what he did because the spirit of the\r\ncitizens was with him: Blake was despised as well as detested.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered his composure he called a council of war, which voted\r\nalmost unanimously[58] that the city was indefensible, and that the\r\narmy must try to cut its way out on the north side of the Guadalaviar.\r\nIf the sally had been made on the 27th it might have succeeded, for\r\nit was not till late on that day that Suchet’s arrangements for the\r\nblockade of the north bank were complete. But the investing line had\r\nbeen linked up by the night of the 28th-29th, when Blake made his last\r\nstroke for safety. At six in the evening the field army issued from\r\nthe gate of St. José and began to cross the bridge opposite it, the\r\nwesternmost of the three of which the Spaniards were in possession.\r\nThis led not to the great _chaussée_ to Saguntum and Tortosa, which\r\nwas known to have been cut and entrenched by the enemy, but to the\r\nby-road to Liria and the mountains. Lardizabal headed the march, Zayas\r\nfollowed, escorting the artillery and a considerable train, Miranda\r\nbrought up the rear. Charles O’Donnell was left to man the walls with\r\nthe urban guards and the ‘Reserve Division,’ and was given permission\r\nto capitulate whenever he should be attacked.\r\n\r\n  [58] Only Miranda voted against a sortie, and thought that\r\n  nothing could be done, except to hold out for a while in the\r\n  walls and then surrender. Arteche, xi. p. 241.\r\n\r\nLardizabal’s vanguard, under a Colonel Michelena, swerved from the\r\nLiria road soon after passing the Guadalaviar, in order to avoid French\r\nposts, and successfully got as far as the canal of Mestalla before it\r\nwas discovered or checked. The canal was too broad to be passed by\r\nmeans of some beams and planks which had been brought up. But Michelena\r\ngot his men across, partly by fording and partly over a mill-dam, and\r\npresently got to the village of Burjasort, where the artillery of\r\nPalombini’s division were quartered. These troops, surprised in the\r\ndark, could not stop him, and he pushed on through them and escaped\r\nto the hills with his little force--one squadron, one battalion, and\r\nsome companies of Cazadores--some 500 or 600 men[59]. Lardizabal, who\r\nshould have followed him without delay, halted at the canal, trying\r\nto build a bridge, till the French all along the line were alarmed by\r\nthe firing at Burjasort and began to press in upon him. He opened fire\r\ninstead of pushing on at all costs, and presently found himself opposed\r\nby forces of growing strength. Blake thereupon made up his mind that\r\nthe sally had failed, and gave orders for the whole column to turn back\r\nand re-enter Valencia. It seems probable that at least a great part of\r\nthe army might have got away, if an attempt had been made to push on\r\nin Michelena’s wake, for the blockading line was thin here, and only\r\none French regiment seems to have been engaged in checking Lardizabal’s\r\nexit.\r\n\r\n  [59] Not 5,000 as Napier (probably by a misprint) says on page 31\r\n  of his 4th vol. Apparently a misprint in the original edition has\r\n  been copied in all the later fourteen!\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the sortie had failed, and Blake was faced by\r\ncomplete ruin, being driven back with a disheartened army into a city\r\nincapable of defence against a regular siege, and short of provisions.\r\nNext morning the despair of the garrison was shown by the arrival of\r\nmany deserters in the French camp. The inevitable end was delayed for\r\nonly eleven days more. On January 1, most of the siege-guns having\r\nbeen brought across the Guadalaviar, Suchet opened trenches against\r\ntwo fronts of the entrenched camp, the fort of Monte Oliveto and the\r\nsouthern point of the suburb of San Vincente, both salient angles\r\ncapable of being battered from both flanks. Seven batteries were built\r\nopposite them by January 4th, and the advanced works in front were\r\npushed up to within fifty yards of the Spanish works. Thereupon Blake,\r\nbefore the siege-guns had actually opened, abandoned the whole of his\r\nentrenched camp on the next day, without any attempt at defence. The\r\nFrench discovering the evacuation, entered, and found eighty-one guns\r\nspiked in the batteries, and a considerable quantity of munitions.\r\n\r\nBlake was now shut up in the narrow space of the city, whose walls\r\nwere very unsuited for defence, and were easily approachable in many\r\nplaces under shelter of houses left undemolished, which gave cover only\r\nfifty yards from the ramparts. For no attempt had been made to clear\r\na free space round the inner _enceinte_, in case the outer circuit of\r\nthe camp should be lost. While fresh batteries were being built in\r\nthe newly-captured ground, to breach the city wall, Suchet set all\r\nthe mortars in his original works to throw bombs into Valencia. He\r\ngathered that the population was demoralized and probably the garrison\r\nalso, and thought that a general bombardment of the place might bring\r\nabout a surrender without further trouble. About a thousand shells\r\nwere dropped into the city within twenty-four hours, and Suchet then\r\n(January 6th) sent a _parlementaire_ to invite Blake to capitulate.\r\nThe Captain-General replied magniloquently that ‘although yesterday\r\nmorning he might have consented to treat for terms allowing his army\r\nto quit Valencia, in order to spare the inhabitants the horrors of a\r\nbombardment, now, after a day’s firing, he had learnt that he could\r\nrely on the magnanimity and resignation of the people. The Marshal\r\nmight continue his operations if he pleased, and would bear the\r\nresponsibility for so maltreating the place.’\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the bombardment had been very effective, numerous\r\nnon-combatants had perished, and the spirit of the population was\r\nbroken. Many openly pressed for a surrender, and only a few fanatical\r\nmonks went round the streets exhorting the citizens to resistance.\r\nThe bombardment continued on the 7th and 8th, and at the same time\r\nSuchet pushed approaches close to the walls, and in several places\r\nset his miners to work to tunnel under them. Actual assault was never\r\nnecessary, for on the 8th Blake held a council of war, which voted for\r\nentering into negotiation with the enemy. The report of this meeting\r\nsets forth that ‘it had taken into consideration the sufferings of the\r\npeople under these days of bombardment; the cry of the populace was\r\nthat an end must be put to its misery; it was impossible to prolong the\r\ndefence with any profit, without exposing the city to the horrors of an\r\nassault, in which the besiegers would probably succeed, considering the\r\ndepressed condition of the garrison, and the feebleness of the walls.\r\nThe citizens had not only failed to aid in the defence and to second\r\nthe efforts of the regular troops, but were panic-stricken and demanded\r\na surrender. The army itself did not seem disposed to do its duty, and\r\nafter hearing the evidence of the commanders of different corps, the\r\ncouncil decided in favour of negotiating to get honourable terms. If\r\nthese were refused it might be necessary to continue a hopeless defence\r\nand die honourably among the ruins of Valencia[60].\r\n\r\n  [60] See the long _procès verbal_ of the Council’s proceedings\r\n  translated in Belmas, iv. pp. 203-6.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Blake would really have accepted any terms offered\r\nhim as ‘honourable,’ for he assented to all that Suchet dictated to\r\nhim. A feeble attempt to stipulate for a free departure for the field\r\narmy, on condition that the city and all its armaments and resources\r\nwere handed over intact, met with the curt refusal that it deserved. A\r\nsimple capitulation with the honours of war was granted: one clause,\r\nhowever, was looked upon by Blake as somewhat of a concession, though\r\nit really was entirely to Suchet’s benefit. He offered to grant an\r\nexchange to so many of the garrison as should be equivalent man for\r\nman, to French prisoners from the dépôts in Majorca and Cabrera, where\r\nthe unfortunate remnants of Dupont’s army were still in confinement.\r\nAs this was not conceded by the Spanish government, the clause had no\r\nreal effect in mitigating the fate of Blake’s army[61]. Other clauses\r\nin the capitulation declared that private property should be respected,\r\nand that no inquiry should be made after the surrender into the past\r\nconduct of persons who had taken an active part in the revolution of\r\n1808, or the subsequent defence of the kingdom of Valencia: also that\r\nsuch civilians as chose might have three months in which to transport\r\nthemselves, their families, and their goods to such destination as they\r\npleased. These clauses, as we shall see, were violated by Suchet with\r\nthe most shocking callousness and shameless want of respect for his\r\nwritten word.\r\n\r\n  [61] The proposal of exchange came first to Mahy at Alicante; he\r\n  called a council of generals, which resolved that the release of\r\n  so many French would profit Suchet overmuch, because many of them\r\n  had been imprisoned at Alicante and Cartagena, and had worked on\r\n  the fortifications there. They could give the Marshal valuable\r\n  information, which he had better be denied. The proposal must\r\n  therefore be sent on to the Regency at Cadiz. That government,\r\n  after much debate, refused to ratify the proposal, considering it\r\n  more profitable to the enemy than to themselves.\r\n\r\nOn January 9 the citadel and the gate adjacent were handed over to the\r\nFrench; Blake (at his own request) was sent away straight to France,\r\nand did not remain to take part in the formal surrender of his troops\r\nand of the city. It would seem that he could not face the rage of the\r\nValencians, and was only anxious to avoid even twenty-four hours of\r\nsojourn among them after the disaster. Napoleon affected to regard him\r\nas a traitor, though he had never done even a moment’s homage to Joseph\r\nBonaparte in 1808, and shut him up in close captivity in the donjon of\r\nVincennes, where he remained very uncomfortably lodged till the events\r\nof April 1814 set him free[62].\r\n\r\n  [62] Some notes about his captivity may be found in the\r\n  _Mémoires_ of Baron Kolli, the would-be deliverer of King\r\n  Ferdinand, who was shut up in another tower of the castle.\r\n\r\nThe total number of prisoners yielded up by Valencia was 16,270 regular\r\ntroops, of whom some 1,500 were sick or wounded in the hospitals. The\r\nurban guards and armed peasants, who were supposed to be civilians\r\ncovered by the amnesty article in the capitulation, are not counted in\r\nthe total. The regulars marched out of the Serranos gate on January\r\n10, and after laying down their arms and colours were sent prisoners\r\nto France, marching in two columns, under the escort of Pannetier’s\r\nbrigade, to Saragossa. Twenty-one colours and no less than 374 cannon\r\n(mostly heavy guns in the defences) were given over, as also a very\r\nlarge store of ammunition and military effects, but very little food,\r\nwhich was already beginning to fail in the city when Blake surrendered.\r\n\r\nTo prevent unlicensed plunder Suchet did not allow his own troops to\r\nenter Valencia till January 14th, giving the civil authorities four\r\ndays in which to make preparations for the coming in of the new régime.\r\nHe was better received than might have been expected--apparently\r\nBlake’s maladroit dictatorship had thoroughly disgusted the people.\r\nMany of the magistrates bowed to the conqueror and took the oath of\r\nhomage to King Joseph, and the aged archbishop emerged from the village\r\nwhere he had hidden himself for some time, and ‘showed himself animated\r\nby an excellent spirit’ according to the Marshal’s dispatch.\r\n\r\nThis prompt and tame submission did not save Valencia from dreadful\r\ntreatment at the victor’s hands. Not only did he levy on the city and\r\ndistrict a vast fine of 53,000,000 francs (over £2,120,000), of which\r\n3,000,000 were sent to Madrid and the rest devoted to the profit of the\r\nArmy of Aragon, but he proceeded to carry out a series of atrocities,\r\nwhich have been so little spoken of by historians that it would be\r\ndifficult to credit them, if they were not avowed with pride in his own\r\ndispatches to Berthier and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe second article of Blake’s capitulation, already cited above,\r\nhad granted a complete amnesty for past actions on the part of the\r\nValencians--‘Il ne sera fait aucune recherche pour le passé contre ceux\r\nqui auraient pris une part active à la guerre ou à la révolution,’ to\r\nquote the exact term. In his dispatch of January 12 to Berthier, Suchet\r\nis shameless enough to write: ‘I have disarmed the local militia: all\r\nguilty chiefs will be arrested, and all assassins punished; _for in\r\nconsenting to Article II of the Capitulation my only aim was to get\r\nthe matter over quickly_[63].’ ‘Guilty chiefs’ turned out to mean all\r\ncivilians who had taken a prominent part in the defence of Valencia:\r\n‘assassins’ was interpreted to cover guerrilleros of all sorts, not\r\n(as might perhaps have been expected) merely those persons who had\r\ntaken part in the bloody riots against the French commercial community\r\nin 1808[64]. In his second dispatch of January 17 Suchet proceeds to\r\nexplain that he has arrested 480 persons as ‘suspects,’ that a large\r\nnumber of guerrillero leaders have been found among them, who have\r\nbeen sent to the citadel and have been already shot, or will be in\r\na few days. He has also arrested every monk in Valencia; 500 have\r\nbeen sent prisoners to France: five of the most guilty, convicted of\r\nhaving carried round the streets a so-called ‘banner of the faith,’\r\nand of having preached against capitulation, and excited the people\r\nto resistance, have been already executed. Inquiries were still in\r\nprogress. They resulted in the shooting of two more friars[65]. But\r\nthe most astonishing clause in the dispatch is that ‘all those who\r\ntook part in the murders of the French [in 1808] will be sought\r\nout and punished. Already _six hundred_ have been executed by the\r\nfirmness of the Spanish judge Marescot, whom I am expecting soon to\r\nmeet[66].’ It was a trifling addition to the catalogue of Suchet’s\r\ndoings that 350 students of the university, who had volunteered to aid\r\nthe regular artillery during the late siege, had all been arrested\r\nand sent off to France like the monks. Two hundred sick or footsore\r\nprisoners who straggled from the marching column directed on Teruel\r\nand Saragossa are said to have been shot by the wayside[67]. It is\r\nprobable that innumerable prisoners were put to death in cold blood\r\nafter the capitulation of Valencia, in spite of Suchet’s guarantee\r\nthat ‘no research should be made as to the past.’ Of this Napier says\r\nno word[68], though he quotes other parts of Suchet’s dispatches, and\r\npraises him for his ‘vigorous and prudent’ conduct, and his ‘care not\r\nto offend the citizens by violating their customs or shocking their\r\nreligious feelings.’\r\n\r\n  [63] See the dispatches printed in full in Belmas, Appendix, vol.\r\n  iv, pp. 218-20, and 226-7 of his great work.\r\n\r\n  [64] For which see vol. i. p. 68.\r\n\r\n  [65] The names of all seven friars are given by Toreno and\r\n  Schepeler.\r\n\r\n  [66] Can the frightful figure of 600 be a mistake for 60?\r\n\r\n  [67] See Toreno, iii. p. 28.\r\n\r\n  [68] See his pages, iv. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSUCHET’S CONQUEST OF VALENCIA: SIDE-ISSUES AND CONSEQUENCES.\r\nJANUARY-MARCH 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen once Suchet’s long-deferred movements began, on December 26, 1812,\r\nhis operations were so rapid and successful that the whole campaign\r\nwas finished in fourteen days. The unexpected swiftness of his triumph\r\nhad the result of rendering unnecessary the subsidiary operations\r\nwhich Napoleon had directed the Armies of Portugal, the Centre, and\r\nAndalusia, to carry out.\r\n\r\nD’Armagnac, with his 3,000 men of the Army of the Centre, still lay\r\nat Cuenca when Suchet’s advance began, hindered from further movement\r\nby the badness of the roads and the weather. Opposite him were lying\r\nBassecourt’s small force at Requeña--not 2,000 men--and the larger\r\ndetachment of the Murcian army under Freire, which Blake had originally\r\nintended to draw down to join his main body. This seems to have\r\nconsisted of some 4,000 foot and 1,000 horse[69] about the time of the\r\nNew Year.\r\n\r\n  [69] On February 1st Freire’s infantry division, though it had\r\n  suffered much from desertion in the meanwhile, still numbered\r\n  3,300 men present, and his cavalry 850 sabres. See tables in _Los\r\n  Ejércitos españoles_, pp. 149-50.\r\n\r\nFar more important was the force under Montbrun, detached from the Army\r\nof Portugal, which had moved (all too tardily) from La Mancha and the\r\nbanks of the Tagus, by Napoleon’s orders. Assembled, as we have already\r\nshown[70], only on December 29th, it had started from San Clemente on\r\nJanuary 2 to march against Blake’s rear by the route of Almanza, the\r\nonly one practicable for artillery at midwinter. Thus the expedition\r\nwas only just getting under way when Suchet had already beaten Blake\r\nand thrust him into Valencia. It consisted of the infantry divisions\r\nof Foy and Sarrut, of the whole of the light cavalry of the Army of\r\nPortugal, and of five batteries of artillery, in all about 10,000 men.\r\nOf the succour which had been promised from d’Armagnac’s division,\r\nto raise the force to the figures of 12,000 men, few if any came to\r\nhand[71].\r\n\r\n  [70] See above, p. 56.\r\n\r\n  [71] According to Joseph’s letter to Montbrun (_Correspondence of\r\n  King Joseph_, viii. p. 294) a battalion or two may have joined\r\n  Montbrun, as he tells that general that he is glad to know that\r\n  the troops of his army have given satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMontbrun marched with Sarrut and the cavalry by Albacete and\r\nChinchilla, leaving Foy as a reserve échelon, to follow by slower\r\nstages and keep up the communication with La Mancha. Between Chinchilla\r\nand Almanza the advanced cavalry fell in with Freire’s Spanish\r\ndivision, marching across its front. For on the news of Suchet’s\r\npassage of the Guadalaviar on December 26, Freire had moved southward\r\nfrom his position on the Cabriel river, with the intention of joining\r\nMahy, and so of building up a force strong enough to do something to\r\nsuccour Blake and the beleaguered garrison of Valencia. On January 6th\r\nMontbrun’s horse came upon one of Freire’s detachments, dispersed it,\r\nand took some prisoners. But the greater part of the Murcians succeeded\r\nin getting past, and in reaching Mahy at Alicante (January 9th).\r\n\r\nSo cowed was the country-side by the disasters about Valencia that\r\nMontbrun at Almanza succeeded in getting a letter carried by one of\r\nhis staff to Valencia in two days[72]. It announced to Suchet his\r\narrival on the rear of the Spanish army, and his intention of pressing\r\non eastward so as to drive away Freire and Mahy and completely cut off\r\nthe retreat of Blake towards Murcia. But when the dispatch was received\r\nBlake was already a prisoner, and his army had laid down its arms on\r\nthe preceding day. Suchet, therefore, wrote a reply to Montbrun to\r\nthank him for his co-operation, to inform him that it was no longer\r\nnecessary, and to advise him to return as quickly as possible toward\r\nthe Army of Portugal and the Tagus, where his presence was now much\r\nmore needed than on the coast of the Mediterranean. The Army of Aragon\r\nwas strong enough to deal in due course with Mahy and Freire, and to\r\ntake Alicante.\r\n\r\n  [72] Suchet, _Mémoires_, ii. p. 234, for dates.\r\n\r\nMontbrun, however, refused to accept this advice. He was probably,\r\nas his chief Marmont remarks, desirous of distinguishing himself by\r\ncarrying out some brilliant enterprise as an independent commander[73].\r\nKnowing that Mahy’s and Freire’s troops were in a very demoralized\r\ncondition, and underrating the strength of the fortress of Alicante,\r\nhe resolved to march against that place, which he thought would make\r\nlittle or no resistance. Accordingly he called forward Foy to Albacete\r\nand Chinchilla, left the main part of his guns in his charge, and\r\nmarched on Alicante with the cavalry and Sarrut’s division, having only\r\none battery of horse artillery with him.\r\n\r\n  [73] Marmont accuses Montbrun exactly as Napoleon accuses Marmont!\r\n\r\nAt the news of his approach Mahy, who had been at Alcoy since he\r\nabandoned the line of the Nucar on December 27th, retired into Alicante\r\nwith Creagh’s and Obispo’s infantry. Bassecourt also joined him there,\r\nwhile Freire with his own column, Villacampa’s division, and all the\r\nMurcian and Valencian cavalry, occupied Elche and other places in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Over 6,000 regular infantry were within the walls\r\nof Alicante by January 15th. Montbrun on the following day drove\r\nFreire out of Elche westward, and presented himself in front of the\r\nnew fortification of Alicante, which had been much improved during\r\nthe last year, and included a new line of bastioned wall outside the\r\nold mediaeval _enceinte_ and the rocky citadel. It is probable that\r\nMontbrun had no knowledge of the recent improvements to the fortress,\r\nand relied on old reports of its weakness. After advancing into the\r\nsuburbs, and throwing a few useless shells into the place, whose\r\nartillery returned a heavy fire, he retreated by Elche and Hellin to\r\nAlbacete[74]. As he went he laid waste the country-side in the most\r\nreckless fashion, and raised heavy requisitions of money in Elche,\r\nHellin, and other places. This involved him in an angry correspondence\r\nwith Suchet, who insisted that no commander but himself had a right\r\nto extort contributions in the region that fell into his sphere of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n  [74] On his first appearance he sent to summon Alicante, and\r\n  received the proper negative answer. But Schepeler, who was in\r\n  the place, says that the governor, General de la Cruz, showed\r\n  signs of yielding. Fortunately the other generals did not. It\r\n  would have been absurd to treat seriously a force of 4,000\r\n  infantry and 1,500 horse with only six light guns! (Schepeler, p.\r\n  520.)\r\n\r\nMontbrun’s raid was clearly a misguided operation. Alicante was far too\r\nstrong to be taken by escalade, when it was properly garrisoned: the\r\nonly chance was that the garrison might flinch. They refused to do so,\r\nand the French general was left in an absurd position, demonstrating\r\nwithout siege-guns against a regular fortress. His action had two\r\nill-effects--the first was that it concluded the Valencian campaign\r\nwith a fiasco--a definite repulse which put heart into the Spaniards.\r\nThe second (and more important) was that it separated him from Marmont\r\nand the Army of Portugal for ten days longer than was necessary. His\r\nchief had given him orders to be back on the Tagus by the 15th-20th of\r\nJanuary, as his absence left the main body too weak. Owing to his late\r\nstart he would in any case have overpassed these dates, even if he had\r\nstarted back from Almanza on January 13th, after receiving the news\r\nof the fall of Valencia. But by devoting nine days to an advance from\r\nAlmanza to Alicante and then a retreat from Alicante to Albacete, he\r\ndeferred his return to Castile by that space of time. He only reached\r\nToledo on January 31st with his main column. Foy’s division, sent on\r\nahead, arrived there on the 29th. Montbrun’s last marches were executed\r\nwith wild speed, for he had received on the way letters of the most\r\nalarming kind from Marmont, informing him that Wellington had crossed\r\nthe Agueda with his whole army and laid siege to Ciudad Rodrigo. The\r\nArmy of Portugal must concentrate without delay. But by the time that\r\nMontbrun reached Toledo, Rodrigo had already been twelve days in the\r\nhands of the British general, and further haste was useless. The troops\r\nwere absolutely worn out, and received with relief the order to halt\r\nand wait further directions, since they were too late to save the\r\nfallen fortress. It is fair to Montbrun to remark that, even if he had\r\nnever made his raid on Alicante, he would still have been unable to\r\nhelp his chief. If he had turned back from Almanza on January 13th, he\r\nwould have been at Toledo only on the 22nd--and that city is nearly 200\r\nmiles by road from Ciudad Rodrigo, which had fallen on the 19th. The\r\ndisaster on the Agueda was attributable not to Montbrun’s presumptuous\r\naction, but to the Emperor’s orders that the Army of Portugal should\r\nmake a great detachment for the Valencian campaign. Even if the\r\nraiding column had started earlier, as Napoleon intended, it could not\r\nhave turned back till it got news of the capitulation of Blake, which\r\nonly took place on January 8th. And whatever might then have been its\r\nexact position, it could not have been back in time to join Marmont\r\nin checking the operations of Wellington, which (as we have already\r\nstated) came to a successful end on January 19th. Wherefore, though\r\nMontbrun must receive blame, the responsibility for the fall of Rodrigo\r\nlay neither with him nor with Marmont, but with their great master.\r\n\r\nAnother diversion made by Napoleon’s orders for the purpose of\r\naiding Suchet was quite as futile--though less from the fault of the\r\noriginal direction, and more from an unforeseen set of circumstances.\r\nLike Marmont and King Joseph, Soult had also been ordered to lend\r\nSuchet assistance against Valencia, by demonstrating from the side of\r\nGranada against Murcia and its army. This order, issued apparently\r\nabout November 19, 1811[75]. and repeated on December 6th, reached\r\nthe Duke of Dalmatia just when he had assembled all his disposable\r\nfield-forces for the siege of Tarifa, an operation where preparations\r\nbegan on December 8th and which did not end till January 5th.\r\nHaving concentrated 13,000 men in the extreme southern point of his\r\nviceroyalty, Soult had not a battalion to spare for a sally from its\r\nextreme eastern point. He could not give up a great enterprise already\r\nbegun; and it was only when it had failed, and the troops from Tarifa\r\nwere returning--in a sufficiently melancholy plight--that Soult could\r\ndo anything. But by this time it was too late to help Suchet, who had\r\nfinished his business without requiring assistance from without.\r\n\r\n  [75] It is alluded to in a dispatch of the Emperor to Berthier on\r\n  that day. ‘Le duc de Dalmatie a l’ordre d’envoyer une colonne en\r\n  Murcie pour faire une diversion.’ St. Cloud, Nov. 19.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Marshal Suchet, Duke of Albufera_\r\n\r\n_from the portrait by Charpentier_]\r\n\r\nWhether Soult was already aware of the surrender of Valencia or not,\r\nwhen January 20th had arrived, he had before that day issued orders\r\nto his brother, the cavalry general, Pierre Soult, to take the light\r\nhorse of the 4th Corps from Granada, and to execute with them a raid\r\nagainst Murcia, with the object of drawing off the attention of any\r\nSpanish troops left in that direction from Suchet. The General, with\r\nabout 800 sabres, pushing on by Velez Rubio and Lorca, arrived\r\nbefore the gates of Murcia quite unopposed on January 25th. Freire had\r\nleft no troops whatever to watch the borders of Granada, and had drawn\r\noff everything, save the garrison of Cartagena, toward the Valencian\r\nfrontiers. Pierre Soult summoned the defenceless city, received its\r\nsurrender, and imposed on it a ransom of 60,000 dollars. He entered\r\nnext day, and established himself in the archbishop’s palace; having\r\nneither met nor heard of any enemy he was quite at his ease, and was\r\nsitting down to dine, when a wild rush of Spanish cavalry came sweeping\r\ndown the street and cutting up his dispersed and dismounted troopers.\r\nThis was General Martin La Carrera, whose brigade was the nearest force\r\nto Murcia when Soult arrived. Hearing that the French were guarding\r\nthemselves ill, he had resolved to attempt a surprise, and, dividing\r\nhis 800 men into three columns, assailed Murcia by three different\r\ngates. His own detachment cut its way in with success, did much damage,\r\nand nearly captured the French general. But neither of the other\r\nparties showed such resolution; they got bickering with the French at\r\nthe entries of the city, failed to push home, and finally retired with\r\nsmall loss. The gallant and unfortunate La Carrera, charging up and\r\ndown the streets in vain search for his reinforcements, was finally\r\nsurrounded by superior numbers, and died fighting gallantly.\r\n\r\nHis enterprise warned Soult that Spanish troops were collecting in\r\nfront of him, and indeed Villacampa’s infantry was not far off.\r\nWherefore he evacuated Murcia next day, after raising so much of the\r\ncontribution as he could, and plundering many private houses. The\r\nSpaniards reoccupied the place, and Joseph O’Donnell, now placed in\r\ncommand of the Murcian army in succession to Mahy, gave La Carrera’s\r\ncorpse a splendid funeral. Soult retreated hastily to the Granadan\r\nfrontier, pillaging Alcantarilla and Lorca by the way. This was the\r\nonly part taken by the French Army of Andalusia in the January campaign\r\nof 1812. The siege of Tarifa had absorbed all its energies.\r\n\r\nMontbrun’s and Pierre Soult’s enterprises had little effect on the\r\ngeneral course of events in eastern Spain. It was Suchet’s own\r\noperations which, in the estimation of every observer from the Emperor\r\ndownwards, were to be considered decisive. When Valencia had fallen,\r\nevery one on the French side supposed that the war was practically\r\nat an end in this region, and that the dispersion of the remnants of\r\nMahy’s and Freire’s troops and the capture of Peniscola, Alicante, and\r\nCartagena,--the three fortresses still in Spanish hands,--were mere\r\nmatters of detail. No one could have foreseen that the region south\r\nof the Xucar was destined to remain permanently in the hands of the\r\npatriots, and that Suchet’s occupation of Valencia was to last for\r\nno more than eighteen months. Two causes, neither of them depending\r\non Suchet’s own responsibility, were destined to save the kingdom of\r\nMurcia and the southern region of Valencia from conquest. The first was\r\nNapoleon’s redistribution of his troops in eastern Spain, consequent\r\non the approach of his war with Russia. The second was the sudden\r\nvictorious onslaught of Wellington on the French in the western parts\r\nof the Peninsula. How the former of these causes worked must at once\r\nbe shown--the effect of the latter cause did not become evident till a\r\nlittle later.\r\n\r\nOf the 33,000 men with whom Suchet had conquered Valencia and captured\r\nBlake, no less than 13,000 under Reille had been lent him from the\r\nArmy of the North, and were under orders to return to the Ebro as\r\nsoon as possible. Indeed, till they should get back, Aragon, very\r\ninsufficiently garrisoned by Caffarelli’s division, was out of hand,\r\nand almost as much in the power of the Empecinado, Duran, and Montijo,\r\nas of the French. Moreover, so long as Caffarelli was at Saragossa,\r\nand his troops dispersed in the surrounding region, both Navarre and\r\nOld Castile were undermanned, and the Army of the North was reduced to\r\nlittle more than Dorsenne’s two divisions of the Young Guard. To secure\r\nthe troops for the great push against Valencia, so many divisions\r\nhad shifted eastward, that Marmont and Dorsenne between them had, as\r\nthe Emperor must have seen, barely troops enough in hand to maintain\r\ntheir position, if Wellington should make some unexpected move--though\r\nNapoleon had persuaded himself that such a move was improbable. In\r\nspite of this, he was anxious to draw back Reille’s and Caffarelli’s,\r\nno less than Montbrun’s, men to more central positions.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all: in December the Emperor’s dispatches begin\r\nto show that he regarded war with Russia in the spring of 1812 as\r\ndecidedly probable, and that for this reason he was about to withdraw\r\nall the Imperial Guard from Spain. On December 15th a note to Berthier\r\nordered all the light and heavy cavalry of the Guard--chasseurs,\r\ngrenadiers à cheval, dragoons, Polish lancers--to be brought home, as\r\nalso its horse artillery and the _gendarmes d’élite_. All these were\r\nserving in the Army of the North, and formed the best part of its\r\nmounted troops. This was but a trifling preliminary warning of his\r\nintentions: on January 14, 1812--the results of the Valencian campaign\r\nbeing still unknown--he directed Berthier to withdraw from Spain\r\nthe whole of the Infantry of the Guard and the whole of the Polish\r\nregiments in Spain. This was an order of wide-spreading importance,\r\nand created large gaps in the muster-rolls of Suchet, Soult, and\r\nDorsenne. Suchet’s Poles (three regiments of the Legion of the Vistula,\r\nnearly 6,000 men, including the detachments left in Aragon) formed\r\na most important part of the 3rd Corps. Soult had the 4th, 6th, and\r\n9th Polish regiments and the Lancers, who had done such good service\r\nat Albuera, a total of another 6,000 men. But Dorsenne was to be the\r\ngreatest sufferer--he had in the Army of the North not only the 4th\r\nof the Vistula, some 1,500 bayonets, but the whole of the infantry\r\nof the Young Guard, the two divisions of Roguet and Dumoustier,\r\ntwenty-two battalions over 14,000 strong. The dispatch of January 14\r\ndirected that Suchet should send off his battalions of the Legion\r\n‘immediately after the fall of Valencia.’ Soult was to draft away\r\nhis Poles ‘within twenty-four hours after the receipt of the order.’\r\nDorsenne, of course, could not begin to send off the Guard Divisions\r\nof infantry till the troops lent from the Army of the North (Reille\r\nand Caffarelli) were freed from the duties imposed on them by the\r\nValencian expedition. A supplementary order of January 27th told him\r\nthat he might keep them for some time longer if the English took the\r\noffensive--news of Wellington’s march on Rodrigo was just coming to\r\nhand. ‘Le désir,’ says the Emperor, ‘que j’ai d’avoir ma Garde n’est\r\npas tellement pressant qu’il faille la renvoyer avant que les affaires\r\naient pris une situation nouvelle dans le Nord[76].’ As a matter of\r\nfact some Guard-brigades did not get off till March, though by dint\r\nof rapid transport, when they had once passed the Pyrenees, they\r\nstruggled to the front in time to take part in the opening of the great\r\nRussian campaign in June. The fourth brigade, eight battalions under\r\nDumoustier, did not get away till the autumn was over.\r\n\r\n  [76] Napoleon to Berthier, Paris, Jan. 27, 1812.\r\n\r\nThus the Emperor had marked off about 27,000 good veteran troops for\r\nremoval from the Peninsula, with the intention of using them in the\r\noncoming Russian war. The Army of the North was to lose the best of its\r\ndivisions--those of the South and of Aragon very heavy detachments.\r\nNothing was to come in return, save a few drafts and _bataillons de\r\nmarche_ which were lying at Bayonne. The Emperor in his dispatch makes\r\nsome curious self-justificatory remarks, to the effect that he should\r\nleave the Army of Spain stronger than it had been in the summer of\r\n1811; for while he was withdrawing thirty-six battalions, he had sent\r\ninto the Peninsula, since June last, forty-two battalions under Reille,\r\nCaffarelli, and Severoli. This was true enough: but if the total\r\nstrength of the troops now dedicated to Spain was not less than it had\r\nbeen in June 1811, it was left weaker by 27,000 men than it had been in\r\nDecember 1811.\r\n\r\nNow Suchet, when deprived of Reille’s aid, and at the same time\r\ndirected to send back to France his six Polish battalions, was left\r\nwith a very inadequate force in Valencia--not much more than half what\r\nhe had at his disposition on January 1. It would seem that the Emperor\r\noverrated the effect of the capture of Blake and the destruction of his\r\narmy. At any rate, in his dispatches to Suchet, he seemed to consider\r\nthat the whole business in the East was practically completed by the\r\ntriumph at the New Year. The Marshal was directed ‘to push an advanced\r\nguard towards Murcia, and put himself in communication with the 4th\r\nCorps--the eastern wing of Soult’s army--which would be found at\r\nLorca[77].’ But the operations of the troops of the Army of Andalusia\r\nin this quarter were limited to the appearance for two days at Murcia\r\nof Pierre Soult’s small cavalry raid, of which Suchet got no news till\r\nit was passed and gone. He was left entirely to his own resources,\r\nand these were too small for any further advance: the Emperor not only\r\ntook away both Reille and the Poles, but sent, a few days later, orders\r\nthat Palombini’s Italian division, reduced by now to 3,000 men by its\r\nheavy casualties on December 26th, should be sent into southern Aragon\r\nagainst Duran and Montijo. The departure of Palombini (February 15th)\r\nleft Suchet with less than 15,000 men in hand. It must be remembered\r\nthat the conquest of a Spanish province always meant, for the French,\r\nthe setting aside of a large immobilized garrison, to hold it down,\r\nunless it were to be permitted to drop back into insurrection. It was\r\nclear that with the bulk of the kingdom of Valencia to garrison, not to\r\nspeak of the siege of the still intact fortress of Peniscola, Suchet\r\nwould have an infinitesimal field-force left for the final move that\r\nwould be needed, if Mahy and Freire were to be crushed, and Alicante\r\nand Cartagena--both strong places--to be beleaguered.\r\n\r\n  [77] See Suchet’s _Mémoires_, ii. pp. 237-8.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal had by the last week in January pushed Harispe’s division\r\nto Xativa, beyond the Xucar, and Habert’s to Gandia near the sea-coast.\r\nThese 9,000 men were all his disposable force for a further advance:\r\nValencia had to be garrisoned; Musnier’s division had gone north,\r\nto cover the high-road as far as Tortosa and the Ebro; some of the\r\nItalians were sent to besiege Peniscola. Suchet might, no doubt, have\r\npushed Habert and Harispe further forward towards Alicante, but he\r\nhad many reasons for not doing so. That fortress had been proved--by\r\nMontbrun’s raid--to be in a posture of defence: besides its garrison\r\nthere were other Spanish troops in arms in the neighbourhood. To the\r\nforces of Freire, Obispo, Villacampa, and Bassecourt, there was added\r\nthe newly-formed brigade of General Roche, an Irish officer lent by\r\nthe British government to the Spaniards, who had been drilling and\r\ndisciplining the cadres of the battalions handed over to him[78],\r\ntill they were in a better condition than most of the other troops\r\non this coast. The muster-rolls of the ‘united 2nd and 3rd armies,’\r\nas these remnants were now officially styled, showed, on February 1,\r\n1812, 14,000 men present, not including Villacampa’s division, which\r\nwas moving off to its old haunts in Aragon. By March 1 this figure\r\nhad risen to 18,000, many deserters who had gone home after the fall\r\nof Valencia having tardily rejoined the ranks of their battalions.\r\nOver 2,000 cavalry were included in the total--for nearly the whole of\r\nBlake’s squadrons had escaped (not too gloriously) after the disastrous\r\ncombats on December 26, 1812.\r\n\r\n  [78] These were Chinchilla, 2nd of Murcia, and a new locally\r\n  raised battalion called 2nd of Alicante. He was in March handed\r\n  over also Canarias, Burgos, and Ligero de Aragon, which had\r\n  belonged to Freire till that date.\r\n\r\nIf Suchet, therefore, had moved forward with a few thousand men at\r\nthe end of January, he would have risked something, despite of the\r\ndepressed morale of his enemies. But in addition there was vexatious\r\nnews from Catalonia, which presently caused the sending of part of\r\nMusnier’s division beyond the Ebro, and it was reported (only too\r\ncorrectly) that the yellow fever had broken out with renewed violence\r\nat Murcia and Cartagena. An advance into the infected district might\r\nbe hazardous. But most of all was any further initiative discouraged\r\nby the consideration that no help could be expected from Marmont or\r\nSoult. By the end of January Suchet was aware of Wellington’s invasion\r\nof Leon, and of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. Not only did this move\r\nabsorb all the attention of Marmont, Dorsenne, and King Joseph, but\r\nSoult was convinced that it boded evil for him also, and that a new\r\nattack on Badajoz was imminent. Hill’s manœuvres in Estremadura (of\r\nwhich more elsewhere) attracted all his attention, and he let it be\r\nknown that he had neither the wish nor the power to send expeditions\r\neastward, to co-operate against Murcia. Last, but most conclusive, of\r\nall Suchet’s hindrances was a grave attack of illness, which threw\r\nhim on a bed of sickness early in February, and caused him to solicit\r\npermission to return to France for his convalescence. The Emperor\r\n(with many flattering words) refused this leave, and sent two of his\r\nbody physicians to Valencia to treat the Marshal’s ailment. But it was\r\ntwo months before Suchet was able to mount his horse, and put himself\r\nat the head of his army. From February to the beginning of April\r\noperations were necessarily suspended for the Army of Aragon, since its\r\nchief was not one of those who gladly hand over responsibility and the\r\npower of initiative to his subordinates.\r\n\r\nHence there was a long gap in the story of the war in south-eastern\r\nSpain from January to April 1812. The only events requiring notice\r\nduring that period were the occupation by the French of Denia and\r\nPeniscola. The former, a little port on the projecting headland south\r\nof Valencia, was furnished with fortifications newly repaired during\r\nBlake’s régime, and had been an important centre of distribution\r\nfor stores and munitions of war, after the Spaniards lost the Grao\r\nof Valencia in November, since it was the nearest harbour to their\r\npositions along the Guadalaviar. In the general panic after Blake’s\r\nsurrender Mahy withdrew its garrison, but forgot to order the removal\r\nof its magazines. Harispe seized Denia on January 20, and found sixty\r\nguns mounted on its walls, and forty small merchant vessels, some of\r\nthem laden with stores, in its port. He garrisoned the place, and\r\nfitted out some of the vessels as privateers. Mahy’s carelessness in\r\nabandoning these resources was one of the reasons which contributed\r\nmost to his removal from command by the Cadiz Regency. It was indeed\r\na gross piece of neglect, for at least the guns might have been\r\ndestroyed, and the ships brought round to Alicante.\r\n\r\nThe story of Peniscola, however, was far more disgraceful. This\r\nfortress sometimes called ‘the little Gibraltar’ from its impregnable\r\nsituation--it is a towering rock connected with the mainland by a\r\nnarrow sand-spit 250 yards long--was one of the strongest places in all\r\nSpain. It had appeared so impregnable to Suchet, that, on his southward\r\nmarch from Tortosa to Valencia, he had merely masked it, and made no\r\nattempt to meddle with it[79]. Peniscola had suffered no molestation,\r\nand was regularly revictualled by Spanish and British coasting vessels\r\nfrom Alicante, Cartagena, and the Balearic Isles. The governor, Garcia\r\nNavarro, was an officer who had an excellent reputation for personal\r\ncourage--taken prisoner at Falset in 1811[80] he had succeeded in\r\nescaping from a French prison and had reported himself again for\r\nfurther service. The garrison of 1,000 men was adequate for such a\r\nsmall place, and was composed of veteran troops. In directing it to be\r\nformally beleaguered after the fall of Valencia, Suchet seems to have\r\nrelied more on the general demoralization caused by the annihilation of\r\nBlake’s army than on the strength of his means of attack. On January\r\n20th he ordered Severoli with two Italian and two French battalions to\r\npress the place as far as was possible, and assigned to him part of the\r\nsiege-train that had been used at Saguntum. The trenches, on the high\r\nground of the mainland nearest the place, were opened on the 28th, and\r\non the 31st the besiegers began to sap downhill towards the isthmus,\r\nand to erect five batteries on the best available points. But it was\r\nclear that the fortress was most inaccessible, and that to reach its\r\nwalls across the low-lying sand-spit would be a very costly business.\r\n\r\n  [79] See above, p. 14.\r\n\r\n  [80] See vol. iii. pp. 503-4.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when a summons was sent in to the governor on February\r\n2nd, he surrendered at once, getting in return terms of an unusually\r\nfavourable kind--the men and officers of the garrison were given leave\r\neither to depart to their homes with all their personal property, or\r\nto enlist in the service of King Joseph. This was a piece of mere\r\ntreachery: Navarro had made up his mind that the cause of Spain\r\nwas ruined by Blake’s disaster, and had resolved to go over to the\r\nenemy, while there were still good terms to be got for deserters. As\r\nSuchet tells the story, the affair went as follows. A small vessel,\r\nsailing from Peniscola to Alicante, was taken by a privateer fitted\r\nout by Harispe at Denia. Among letters seized by the captors[81] was\r\none from the governor, expressing his disgust with his situation,\r\nand in especial with the peremptory advice given him by the English\r\nnaval officers who were in charge of the revictualling service and\r\nthe communications. He went on to say that he would rather surrender\r\nPeniscola to the French than let it be treated as a British dependency,\r\nwhereupon the Marshal asked, and obtained, the surrender of the place.\r\nNapier expresses a suspicion--probably a well-founded one--that the\r\nletter may have been really intended for Suchet’s own eye, and that\r\nthe whole story was a piece of solemn deceit. ‘Such is the Marshal’s\r\naccount of the affair--but the colour which he thought it necessary\r\nto give to a transaction so full of shame to Navarro, can only be\r\nconsidered as part of the price paid for Peniscola[82].’ The mental\r\nattitude of the traitor is sufficiently expressed by a letter which\r\nreached Suchet along with the capitulation. ‘I followed with zeal,\r\nwith fury I may say, the side which I considered the just one. To-day\r\nI see that to render Spain less unhappy it is necessary for us all to\r\nunite under the King, and I make my offer to serve him with the same\r\nenthusiasm. Your excellency may be quite sure of me--I surrender a\r\nfortress fully provisioned and capable of a long defence--which is the\r\nbest guarantee of the sincerity of my promise[83].’\r\n\r\n  [81] Suchet says that the captain of the boat threw his letters\r\n  overboard at the last moment, but that they floated and were\r\n  picked up by the French. Was this a farce? Or is the whole story\r\n  doubtful?\r\n\r\n  [82] Napier, _Peninsular War_, iv. p. 38.\r\n\r\n  [83] See letter printed in Belmas, iv. p. 248.\r\n\r\nThe most astounding feature of the capitulation was that Navarro got\r\nhis officers to consent to such a piece of open treachery. If they had\r\ndone their duty, they would have arrested him, and sent him a prisoner\r\nto Alicante. Demoralization and despair must have gone very far in this\r\nmiserable garrison.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Peniscola was Suchet’s last success. He fell sick\r\nnot long after, and when he once more assumed the active command\r\nof his troops in April, the whole situation of French affairs in\r\nSpain was changed, and no further advance was possible. The results\r\nof Wellington’s offensive operations in the West had begun to make\r\nthemselves felt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the remains of the Valencian and Murcian armies were\r\nreorganizing themselves, with Alicante as their base and central port\r\nof supply. Joseph O’Donnell, though not a great general, was at least\r\nno worse than Blake and Mahy--of whom the former was certainly the most\r\nmaladroit as well as the most unlucky of commanders, while the latter\r\nhad shown himself too timid and resourceless to play out the apparently\r\nlost game that was left to his hand in January 1812. By March there was\r\nonce more an army in face of the French, and in view of the sudden halt\r\nof the invaders and the cheerful news from the West, hope was once more\r\npermissible. The main body of O’Donnell’s army remained concentrated\r\nin front of Alicante, but Villacampa’s division had gone off early to\r\nAragon, to aid in the diversion against Suchet’s communications, which\r\nwas so constantly kept up by Duran and the Empecinado. This was a good\r\nmove: the weak point of the French occupation was the impossibility\r\nof holding down broad mountain spaces, in which small garrisons were\r\nuseless and helpless, while heavy columns could not live for more than\r\na few days on any given spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI\r\n\r\nMINOR CAMPAIGNS OF THE WINTER OF 1811-12\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCATALONIA AND ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chronicle of the obstinate and heroic defence made by the Catalans,\r\neven after the falls of Tarragona and Figueras had seemed to make all\r\nfurther resistance hopeless, was carried in the last volume of this\r\nwork down to October 28, 1811, when Marshal Macdonald, like St. Cyr and\r\nAugereau, was recalled to Paris, having added no more to his reputation\r\nthan had his predecessors while in charge of this mountainous\r\nprincipality. We have seen how General Lacy, hoping against hope,\r\nrallied the last remnants of the old Catalan army, and recommenced\r\n(just as Macdonald was departing) a series of small enterprises against\r\nthe scattered French garrisons. He had won several petty successes\r\nin evicting the enemy from Cervera, Igualada, and Belpuig--the small\r\nstrongholds which covered the main line of communication east and west,\r\nthrough the centre of the land, between Lerida and Barcelona. The enemy\r\nhad even been forced to evacuate the holy mountain of Montserrat, the\r\nstrongest post on the whole line.\r\n\r\nHence when, in November, General Decaen arrived to take over\r\nMacdonald’s task, he found before him a task not without serious\r\ndifficulties, though the actual force of Spaniards in the field was far\r\nless than it had been before the disasters at Tarragona and Figueras.\r\nLacy had a very small field army--he had reorganized 8,000 men by\r\nOctober, and all through his command the total did not grow very much\r\ngreater. When he handed over his office to Copons fifteen months after,\r\nthere were no more than 14,000 men under arms, including cadres and\r\nrecruits. On the other hand he had a central position, a free range\r\neast and west, now that the line of French posts across Catalonia had\r\nbeen broken, and several points of more or less safe access to the sea.\r\nMunitions and stores, and occasionally very small reinforcements from\r\nthe Balearic Isles, were still brought over by the British squadron\r\nwhich ranged along the coast. Some of the officers, especially the much\r\ntried and never-despairing Eroles, and the indefatigable Manso, were\r\nthoroughly to be relied upon, and commanded great local popularity.\r\nThis Lacy himself did not possess--he was obeyed because of his stern\r\nresolve, but much disliked for his autocratic and dictatorial ways,\r\nwhich kept him in constant friction with the Junta that sat at Berga.\r\nMoreover he was a stranger, while the Catalans disliked all leaders who\r\nwere not of their own blood: and he was strongly convinced that the\r\nbrunt of the fighting must be borne by the regular troops, while the\r\npopular voice was all in favour of the _somatenes_ and guerrilleros,\r\nand against the enforcement of conscription. Much was to be said on\r\neither side: the warfare of the irregulars was very harassing to the\r\nFrench, and had led to many petty successes, and one great one--the\r\ncapture of Figueras. On the other hand these levies were irresponsible\r\nand untrustworthy when any definite operation was in hand: they might,\r\nor they might not, turn up in force when they were required: the frank\r\ndisregard of their chiefs for punctuality or obedience drove to wild\r\nrage any officer who had served in the old army. With regular troops\r\nit was possible to calculate that a force would be where it was wanted\r\nto be at a given time, and would at least attempt to carry out its\r\norders: with the _somatenes_ it was always possible, nay probable,\r\nthat some petty quarrel of rival chiefs, or some rival attraction of\r\nan unforeseen sort, would lead to non-appearance. To this there was\r\nthe easy reply that ever since Blake first tried to make the Catalans\r\nwork ‘_militarmente_ and not _paisanmente_’ the regular army for some\r\ntwo years had never gained a single battle, nor relieved a single\r\nfortress[84]. The best plan would probably have been to attempt to\r\ncombine the two systems: it was absolutely necessary to have a nucleus\r\nof regular troops, but unwise to act like Blake and Lacy, who tried\r\nto break up and discourage the _somatenes_, in order that they might\r\nbe forced into the battalions of the standing army. The constant\r\nseries of defeats on record had been caused rather by the unskilful\r\nand over-ambitious operations of the generals than by their insisting\r\non keeping up the regular troops, who had behaved well enough on many\r\noccasions. But too much had been asked of them when, half-trained\r\nand badly led, they were brought into collision with the veterans of\r\nFrance, without the superiority of numbers which alone could make up\r\nfor their military faults.\r\n\r\n  [84] See notes on discussions of this sort in Sir Edward\r\n  Codrington’s _Memoirs_, i. pp. 264 and 277. He had seen much of\r\n  the evils of both kinds of organization, and leaned on the whole\r\n  to the irregulars, from a personal dislike for Lacy.\r\n\r\nSince the capture of Cervera, Belpuig, and Igualada in October, the\r\nterritories held by the French in Catalonia fell into two separate and\r\ndivided sections. On the western side, adjacent to Aragon, Frère’s\r\ndivision, left behind by Suchet, garrisoned Lerida, Tarragona, and\r\nTortosa: though it was a powerful force of over 7,000 men, it could\r\ndo little more than occupy these three large places, each requiring\r\nseveral battalions. At the best it could only furnish very small\r\nflying columns to keep up the communication between them. It was hard\r\nto maintain touch with the other group of French fortresses, along\r\nthe sea-coast road from Tarragona to Barcelona, which were often\r\nobsessed by Spanish bands, and always liable to be molested by Edward\r\nCodrington’s British ships, which sailed up and down the shore looking\r\nfor detachments or convoys to shell. The fort of the Col de Balaguer,\r\ntwenty miles north of Tortosa, was the look-out point towards Tarragona\r\nand the sole French outpost in that direction.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Catalonia the newly-arrived commander, General Decaen (a\r\nveteran whose last work had been the hopeless defence of Bourbon and\r\nMauritius, where he had capitulated in 1810), had some 24,000 men in\r\nhand. But he was much hampered by the necessity for holding and feeding\r\nthe immense Barcelona, a turbulent city which absorbed a whole division\r\nfor its garrison. It was constantly on the edge of starvation, and was\r\nonly revictualled with great trouble by vessels sailing from the ports\r\nof Languedoc, of which more than half were habitually captured by the\r\nBritish, or by heavy convoys labouring across the hills from Gerona,\r\nwhich were always harassed, and sometimes taken wholesale, by the\r\nSpanish detachments told off by Lacy for this end. Gerona and Figueras,\r\nboth fortresses of considerable size, absorbed several battalions each.\r\nSmaller garrisons had also to be kept in Rosas, Hostalrich, Mataro,\r\nand Montlouis, and there were many other fortified posts which guarded\r\nroads or passes, and were worth holding. It was with difficulty that\r\n6,000 or 8,000 men could be collected for a movable field-force, even\r\nby borrowing detachments from the garrisons. An additional nuisance\r\ncropped up just as Decaen took over the command: Lacy, seeing that the\r\nPyrenean passes were thinly manned, sent Eroles with 3,000 men to raid\r\nthe valleys of Cerdagne on the French side of the hills. The invaders\r\nbeat two battalions of national guards near Puigcerda, and swept far\r\ndown the valley (October 29-November 2), returning with thousands\r\nof sheep and cattle and a large money contribution levied from the\r\nvillages. This raid (which enraged Napoleon[85]) made it necessary to\r\nguard the Pyrenees better, and to send up more national guards from the\r\nfrontier departments.\r\n\r\n  [85] Who called the raid an ‘insult’--Napoleon to Berthier,\r\n  Paris, Feb. 29, 1812, and compare letter of March 8.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that though Lacy had no more than 8,000 men\r\navailable, and no fortress of any strength to serve as his base\r\n(Cardona and Seu d’Urgel, his sole strongholds, were mediaeval\r\nstrongholds with no modern works), he paralysed the French force\r\nwhich, between Lerida and Figueras, could show more than three times\r\nthat strength. Such was the value of the central position, and the\r\nresolute hatred of the countryside for its oppressors. Catalonia could\r\nonly be held down by garrisoning every village--and if the army of\r\noccupation split itself up into garrisons it was helpless. Hence,\r\nduring the winter of 1811-12 and the spring and summer of the following\r\nyear, it may be said that the initiative lay with the Catalans, and\r\nthat the enemy (despite of his immensely superior numbers) was on the\r\ndefensive. The helplessness of the French was sufficiently shown by\r\nthe fact that from June to December 1811 Barcelona was completely cut\r\noff from communication with Gerona and France. It was only in the\r\nlatter month that Decaen, hearing that the place was on the edge of\r\nstarvation, marched with the bulk of Lamarque’s division from Upper\r\nCatalonia to introduce a convoy; while Maurice Mathieu, the governor of\r\nBarcelona, came out with 3,000 men of the garrison to meet him, as far\r\nas Cardadeu. Lacy, determined that nothing short of a vigorous push by\r\nthe enemy should make their junction possible, and relieve Barcelona,\r\noffered opposition in the defile of the Trentapassos, where Vives had\r\ntried to stop St. Cyr two years back, showing a front both to Decaen\r\nand to Mathieu. But on recognizing the very superior numbers of the\r\nenemy he wisely withdrew, or he would have been caught between the two\r\nFrench columns. Decaen therefore was able to enter Barcelona with his\r\nimmense convoy. [December 3rd-4th, 1811.] The Spaniards retreated into\r\nthe inland; their headquarters on the first day of the New Year were at\r\nVich.\r\n\r\nThere being no further profit in pressing Barcelona for the time being,\r\nLacy, in January, resolved to turn his attention to the much weaker\r\ngarrison of Tarragona, which belonged to Frère’s division and Suchet’s\r\narmy, and was not under Decaen’s immediate charge. Its communications\r\nwith Lerida and Tortosa were hazardous, and its stores were running\r\nlow. The Spanish general therefore (about January 2) sent down Eroles’s\r\ndivision to Reus, a few miles inland from Tarragona, with orders to\r\ncut all the roads leading into that fortress. The place was already\r\nin a parlous condition for want of food, and its governor had sent\r\nrepresentations to Suchet that he was in need of instant succour.\r\nTherefore the moment that Valencia fell, the Marshal directed Musnier,\r\nwhose division he had told off to hold the sea-coast between the Ebro\r\nand Guadalaviar, to march with the bulk of his men to Tortosa, to pick\r\nup what reinforcements he could from its garrison, and to open the road\r\nfrom thence to Tarragona.\r\n\r\nLafosse, the governor of Tortosa, was so impressed with the danger of\r\nhis colleague in Tarragona, that he marched ahead along the coast-road\r\nbefore Musnier arrived, and reached the Col de Balaguer with a\r\nbattalion of the 121st regiment and one troop of dragoons on January\r\n18. Here he should have waited for the main column, but receiving false\r\nnews that Eroles had left Reus and returned to the north, he resolved\r\nto push on ahead and clear the way for Musnier, believing that nothing\r\nbut local _somatenes_ were in front of him. He had reached Villaseca,\r\nonly seven miles from Tarragona, when he was suddenly surprised\r\nby Eroles descending on his flank with over 3,000 men. He himself\r\ngalloped on with the dragoons towards Tarragona, and escaped, with only\r\ntwenty-two men, into the fortress. But his battalion, after barricading\r\nitself in Villaseca village and making a good resistance for some\r\nhours, was forced to surrender. Eroles took nearly 600 prisoners, and\r\nover 200 French had fallen. Lafosse, sallying from Tarragona with all\r\nthat could be spared from the garrison, arrived too late to help his\r\nmen, and had to return in haste [January 19][86].\r\n\r\n  [86] There is an interesting account of the combat of Villaseca\r\n  in Codrington’s _Memoirs_, i. pp. 254-6: he was present, having\r\n  chanced to come on shore to confer with Eroles as to co-operation\r\n  against Tarragona. An odd episode of the affair was that, when\r\n  the French surrendered, they were found to have with them as\r\n  prisoners Captains Flinn and Pringle, R.N., whom they had\r\n  surprised landing at Cape Salou on the previous day.\r\n\r\nTarragona now seemed in imminent danger, and both Musnier at Tortosa\r\nand Maurice Mathieu at Barcelona saw that they must do their best to\r\nrelieve the place, or it would be starved out. Musnier spent so much\r\ntime in organizing a convoy that he was late, and the actual opening\r\nof the road was carried out by the governor of Barcelona. That great\r\ncity chanced to be crammed with troops at the moment, since Lamarque’s\r\ndivision, which had escorted the December convoy, was still lying\r\nwithin its walls. Maurice Mathieu, therefore, was able to collect 8,000\r\nmen for the march on Tarragona. Eroles, unfortunately for himself, was\r\nnot aware of this, and believing that the enemy was a mere sally of\r\nthe Barcelona garrison, offered them battle at Altafulla on January\r\n24. The French had marched by night, and a fog chanced to prevent\r\nthe Catalans from recognizing the strength of the two columns that\r\nwere approaching them. Eroles found himself committed to a close\r\nfight with double his own numbers, and after a creditable resistance\r\nwas routed, losing his only two guns and the rearguard with which he\r\ntried to detain the enemy. His troops only escaped by breaking up and\r\nflying over the hills, in what a French eye-witness described as _un\r\nsauve-qui-peut général_. About 600 of them in all were slain or taken:\r\nthe rest assembled at Igualada three days later. Eroles blamed Lacy\r\nand Sarsfield for his disaster, asserting that the Captain-General\r\nhad promised to send the division of the latter to his help. But his\r\nanger appears to have been misplaced, for at this very time Decaen,\r\nto make a division in favour of Maurice Mathieu’s movement, had sent\r\nout two columns from Gerona and Figueras into Upper Catalonia. They\r\noccupied Vich, Lacy’s recent head-quarters, on January 22, two days\r\nbefore the combat of Altafulla, and Sarsfield’s troops were naturally\r\nsent to oppose them. After wasting the upper valleys, Decaen drew\r\nback to Gerona and Olot on the 29th, having sufficiently achieved his\r\npurpose. Tarragona, meanwhile, was thoroughly revictualled by Musnier,\r\nwho brought up a large convoy from Tortosa. Reinforcements were also\r\nthrown into the place, and a new governor, General Bertoletti, who was\r\nto distinguish himself by a spirited defence in the following year.\r\n\r\nIn February the whole situation of affairs in Aragon and western\r\nCatalonia (eastern Catalonia was less affected), was much modified by\r\nthe return from the south of the numerous troops which had been lent\r\nto Suchet for his Valencian expedition. It will be remembered that\r\nNapoleon had ordered that Reille should march back to the Ebro with his\r\nown and Severoli’s divisions, and that shortly afterwards he directed\r\nthat Palombini’s division should follow the other two into Aragon. Thus\r\na very large body of troops was once more available for the subjection\r\nof Aragon and western Catalonia, which, since Reille’s departure in\r\nDecember, had been very inadequately garrisoned by Caffarelli’s and\r\nFrère’s battalions, and had been overrun in many districts by the bands\r\nof the Empecinado, Duran, Mina, and the Conde de Montijo. Napoleon’s\r\nnew plan was to rearrange the whole of the troops in eastern Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATALONIA]\r\n\r\nReille was to be the chief of a new ‘Army of the Ebro,’ composed of\r\nfour field divisions--his own, Palombini’s and Severoli’s Italians, and\r\na new composite one under General Ferino constructed from so many of\r\nFrère’s troops as could be spared from garrison duty (seven battalions\r\nof the 14th and 115th of the line), and six more battalions (1st Léger\r\nand 5th of the line) taken half from Musnier’s division of Suchet’s\r\narmy and half from Maurice Mathieu’s Barcelona garrison[87]. This\r\nlast division never came into existence, as Suchet and Maurice Mathieu\r\nboth found themselves too weak to give up the requisitioned regiments,\r\nwhich remained embodied respectively with the Valencian and Catalan\r\narmies. Nevertheless Reille had more than 20,000 men actually in hand,\r\nnot including the fixed garrisons of Tarragona, Lerida, and the other\r\nfortresses on the borders of Aragon and Catalonia. This, when it is\r\nremembered that Caffarelli was still holding the Saragossa district,\r\nseemed an adequate force with which to make an end of the guerrilleros\r\nof Aragon, and then to complete, in conjunction with Decaen’s Corps,\r\nthe subjection of inland Catalonia. For this last operation was to be\r\nthe final purpose of Reille: while Decaen was to attack Lacy from the\r\neastern side, Reille (with Lerida as his base) was to fall on from the\r\nwest, to occupy Urgel and Berga (the seat of the Catalan Junta and the\r\ncentre of organized resistance), and to join hands with Decaen across\r\nthe crushed remnants of the Spanish army[88]. So sure did the Emperor\r\nfeel that the last elements of Catalan resistance were now to be\r\ndestroyed, that he gave orders for the issue of the proclamation (drawn\r\nup long before[89]) by which the Principality was declared to be united\r\nto the French empire. It was to be divided into the four departments\r\nof the Ter [capital Gerona], Montserrat [capital Barcelona],\r\nBouches-de-l’Ebre [capital Lerida], and Segre [capital Puigcerda].\r\nPrefects and other officials were appointed for each department, and\r\njustice was to be administered in the name of the Emperor. The humour\r\nof the arrangement (which its creator most certainly failed to see) was\r\nthat three-fourths of the territory of each department was in the hands\r\nof the patriots whom he styled rebels, and that none of his prefects\r\ncould have gone ten miles from his _chef-lieu_ without an escort of 200\r\nmen, under pain of captivity or death.\r\n\r\n  [87] Napoleon to Berthier, Paris, Jan. 25, after the receipt of\r\n  the news of the fall of Valencia.\r\n\r\n  [88] Details may be found in the dispatches of Feb. 29, and May\r\n  1st and 8th.\r\n\r\n  [89] See vol. iv. p. 215.\r\n\r\nReille’s start was much delayed by the fact that one of his French\r\nbrigades had been told off to serve as escort to the mass of Blake’s\r\nprisoners from Valencia, and could not get quit of them till, marching\r\nby Teruel, it had handed them over for transference beyond the Pyrenees\r\nto the garrison of Saragossa. Of his two Italian divisions, Palombini’s\r\nwas instructed to devote itself to the clearing of southern Aragon,\r\nand the opening up of the communications between the French garrisons\r\nof Daroca, Teruel, and Calatayud. The other, Severoli’s, called off\r\nfrom the siege of Peniscola, which had originally been entrusted to\r\nit[90], marched for Lerida in two columns, the one by the sea-coast and\r\nTortosa, the other inland, by way of Morella and Mequinenza. When his\r\ntroops had begun to concentrate on the borders of Aragon and Catalonia,\r\nin and about Lerida, Reille began operations by sending a column, one\r\nFrench brigade and one Italian regiment, to attack the ubiquitous\r\nEroles, who, since his defeat at Altafulla a month before, had betaken\r\nhimself to the inland, and the rough country along the valleys of the\r\ntwo Nogueras, with the object of covering Catalonia on its western\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n  [90] See above, p. 88.\r\n\r\nThis expedition, entrusted to the French brigadier Bourke, ended in\r\nan unexpected check: Eroles offered battle with 3,000 men in a strong\r\nposition at Roda, with a torrent bed covering his front (March 5).\r\nBourke, having far superior numbers, and not aware of the tenacity of\r\nthe Catalan troops, whom he had never before encountered, ordered a\r\ngeneral frontal attack by battalions of the 60th French and 7th Italian\r\nline. It was handsomely repulsed, with such heavy loss--600 casualties\r\nit is said--that the French retreated as far as Barbastro, pursued for\r\nsome distance by the troops of Eroles, who thus showed that their late\r\ndisaster had not impaired their morale[91]. This was a most glorious\r\nday for the Baron, one of the few leaders of real capacity whom the\r\nwar in Catalonia revealed. He had been a civilian in 1808, and had to\r\nlearn the elements of military art under chiefs as incapable as Blake\r\nand Campoverde. From a miquelete chief he rose to be a general in the\r\nregular army, purely by the force of his unconquerable pertinacity and\r\na courage which no disasters could break. As a local patriot he had an\r\nadvantage in dealing with his Catalan countrymen, which strangers like\r\nReding, Blake, Lacy, or Sarsfield never possessed, and their confidence\r\nwas never betrayed. A little active man of great vivacity, generally\r\nwith a cigar in the corner of his mouth, and never long still, he\r\nwas not only a good leader of irregular bands, but quite capable of\r\nunderstanding a strategical move, and of handling a division in a\r\nserious action. His self-abnegation during his service under chiefs\r\nwhose plans were often unwise, and whose authority was often exercised\r\nin a galling fashion, was beyond all praise[92].\r\n\r\n  [91] The exact loss is uncertain, but Bourke himself was wounded,\r\n  and Martinien’s lists show 15 other casualties among French and\r\n  Italian officers: Vacani (vi. p. 65) says that the 7th Italian\r\n  line alone lost 15 killed and 57 wounded. A loss of 16 officers\r\n  implies _at least_ 300 men hit.\r\n\r\n  [92] For numerous anecdotes of Eroles and lively pictures of his\r\n  doings the reader may refer to the Memoirs of Edward Codrington,\r\n  with whom he so often co-operated.\r\n\r\nThe check at Roda forced Reille to turn aside more troops against\r\nEroles--practically the whole of Severoli’s division was added to\r\nthe column which had just been defeated, and on March 13th such a\r\nforce marched against him that he was compelled to retire, drawing\r\nhis pursuers after him toward the upper course of the Noguera, and\r\nultimately to seek refuge in the wilds of Talarn among the foot-hills\r\nof the higher Pyrenees. His operations with a trifling force paralysed\r\nnearly half Reille’s army during two critical months of the spring of\r\n1812. Meanwhile, covered by his demonstration, Sarsfield executed a\r\ndestructive raid across the French border, overran the valleys beyond\r\nAndorra, and exacted a ransom of 70,000 dollars from Foix, the chief\r\ntown of the department of the Arriège (February 19). This was the best\r\npossible reply to Napoleon’s recent declaration that Catalonia had\r\nbecome French soil. The Emperor was naturally enraged; he reiterated\r\nhis orders to Reille to ‘déloger les insurgents: il n’est que trop\r\nvrai qu’ils se nourrissent de France’--’il faut mettre un terme à ces\r\ninsultes [93].’ But though Reille pushed his marches far into the\r\nremote mountainous districts where the borders of Aragon and Catalonia\r\nmeet, he never succeeded in destroying the bands which he was set to\r\nhunt down: a trail of burnt villages marked his course, but it had\r\nno permanent result. The inhabitants descended from the hills, to\r\nreoccupy their fields and rebuild their huts, when he had passed by,\r\nand the insurgents were soon prowling again near the forts of Lerida,\r\nBarbastro, and Monzon.\r\n\r\n  [93] Napoleon to Berthier, March 8th, 1812.\r\n\r\nPalombini in southern Aragon had equally unsatisfactory experiences.\r\nComing up from Valencia by the high-road, he had reached Teruel on\r\nFebruary 19th, and, after relieving and strengthening the garrison\r\nthere, set out on a circular sweep, with the intention of hunting down\r\nGayan and Duran--the Conde de Montijo had just returned to the Murcian\r\narmy at this moment[94], while the Empecinado was out of the game for\r\nsome weeks, being, as we shall presently see, busy in New Castile.\r\nBut the movements of the Italian general were soon complicated by the\r\nfact that Villacampa, with the remnants of his division, had started\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Alicante and Murcia much at the same time as\r\nhimself, to seek once more his old haunts in Aragon. This division had\r\ngiven a very poor account of itself while serving as regular troops\r\nunder Blake, but when it returned to its native mountains assumed a\r\nvery different efficiency in the character of a large guerrilla band.\r\nAppearing at first only 2,000 strong, it recruited itself up to a much\r\ngreater strength from local levies, and became no mean hindrance to\r\nPalombini’s operations.\r\n\r\n  [94] Apparently about the same time that Villacampa and his\r\n  division came up to replace him in Aragon.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of February the Italian general relieved Daroca, and a few\r\ndays later he occupied Calatayud, which had been left ungarrisoned\r\nsince the disaster of the previous October[95]. After fortifying the\r\nconvent of Nostra Señora de la Peña as a new citadel for this place,\r\nhe split up his division into several small columns, which scoured the\r\nneighbourhood, partly to sweep in provisions for the post at Calatayud,\r\npartly to drive off the guerrilleros of the region. But to risk small\r\ndetachments in Aragon was always a dangerous business; Villacampa, who\r\nhad now come up from the south, cut off one body of 200 men at Campillo\r\non March 5, and destroyed six companies at Pozohondon on the 28th of\r\nthe same month. Taught prudence by these petty disasters, and by some\r\nless successful attacks on others of his flying columns, Palombini once\r\nmore drew his men together, and concentrated them in the upland plain\r\nof Hused near Daroca. From thence he made another blow at Villacampa,\r\nwho was at the same time attacked in the rear by a column sent up\r\nby Suchet from Valencia to Teruel. The Spaniard, however, easily\r\navoided the attempt to surround him, and retired without much loss or\r\ndifficulty into the wild Sierra de Albarracin (April 18th). Meanwhile,\r\nseeing Palombini occupied in hunting Villacampa, the guerrillero Gayan\r\nmade a dash at the new garrison of Calatayud, and entering the city\r\nunexpectedly captured the governor and sixty men, but failed to reduce\r\nthe fortified convent in which the rest of the Italians took refuge\r\n[April 29th]. He then sat down to besiege them, though he had no guns,\r\nand could work by mines alone: but Palombini soon sent a strong column\r\nunder the brigadiers Saint Paul and Schiazzetti, who drove off Gayan\r\nand relieved Calatayud [May 9th].\r\n\r\n  [95] See above, page 21.\r\n\r\nNevertheless three months had now gone by since the attempt to reduce\r\nsouthern Aragon began, and it was now obvious that it had been wholly\r\nunsuccessful. The hills and great part of the upland plains were still\r\nin the possession of the Spaniards, who had been often hunted but never\r\ncaught nor seriously mishandled. Palombini owned nothing more than the\r\ntowns which he had garrisoned, and the spot on which his head-quarters\r\nchanced for the moment to be placed. His strength was not sufficient\r\nto enable him to occupy every village, and without such occupation\r\nno conquest could take place. Moreover the time was at hand when\r\nWellington’s operations in the West were to shake the fabric of French\r\npower all over Spain--even in the remote recesses of the Aragonese\r\nSierras. Palombini was to be drawn off in July to join the Army of the\r\nCentre and to oppose the English. And with his departure such hold as\r\nthe French possessed on the rugged region between Calatayud, Saragossa,\r\nand Teruel was to disappear.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that during these operations of the spring no mention\r\nhas been made of the Empecinado, who had been so prominent in this\r\nquarter during the preceding autumn and winter. This chief was now\r\nat the bottom of his fortunes: raiding in New Castile after his\r\naccustomed fashion, he had been completely defeated by General Guy\r\nand a column of King Joseph’s army near Siguenza (February 7). He lost\r\n1,000 men, only saved his own person by throwing himself down an almost\r\nimpracticable cliff, and saw his whole force dispersed. This affair\r\nis said to have been the result of treachery: one of the Empecinado’s\r\nlieutenants, a certain guerrillero leader named Albuir (better known\r\nas El Manco from having lost a hand) being taken prisoner a few days\r\nbefore, saved his neck by betraying his chief’s position and plans:\r\nhence the surprise. El Manco entered the King’s service and raised a\r\n‘counter-guerrilla’ band, with which he did considerable harm for a\r\nspace. The Empecinado had only collected 600 men even by April, when he\r\njoined Villacampa and aided him in a raid round Guadalajara[96].\r\n\r\n  [96] For all this see Schepeler, pp. 570-1; King Joseph’s Letters\r\n  (Ducasse), viii. pp. 291 and 305; and Toreno, iii. pp. 81-2.\r\n\r\nMina, on the other hand, the greatest of all the partisans, was doing\r\nsome of his best service to the cause of liberty during the early\r\nmonths of 1812. This was the period when he was conducting his bloody\r\ncampaign of reprisals against Abbé, the governor of Navarre, who had\r\npublished in December 1811 the celebrated proclamation which not only\r\nprohibited any quarter for guerrilleros, but made their families\r\nand villages responsible for them, and authorized the execution of\r\n‘hostages’ levied on them, as well as the infliction of crushing fines.\r\nMina replied by the formal declaration of a ‘war of extermination\r\nagainst all French without distinction of rank,’ and started the system\r\nof shooting four prisoners for every Spaniard, soldier or civilian,\r\nexecuted by the enemy. This he actually carried out for some months,\r\ntill the French proclamation was withdrawn. The most horrid incident\r\nof this reign of terror was the shooting by the French, on March 21,\r\nof the four members of the ‘insurrectional junta’ of the province\r\nof Burgos, all magistrates and civilians, whom they had captured in\r\na raid, and the counter-execution of eighty French soldiers by the\r\nCurate Merino, one of Mina’s colleagues, a few days later. This time of\r\natrocities ended shortly after, when Abbé withdrew his proclamation and\r\nMina followed his example.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of Reille’s troops from Valencia it will be\r\nremembered that one of his French brigades, that of Pannetier, had\r\nbeen sent as escort to the captive Spaniards of Blake’s army. While\r\nthe remainder of the new ‘Army of the Ebro’ went off in the direction\r\nof Lerida, as has already been seen, this brigade was turned aside\r\nagainst Mina. Dorsenne at the same time directed the greater part\r\nof his available field-force to join in the hunt, and all such of\r\nCaffarelli’s troops as were not shut up in garrisons were told off for\r\nthe same purpose. These detachments, when added to the normal force\r\nof occupation in Navarre and Biscay, made up in all some 30,000 men.\r\nDivided into many columns, each of which was strong enough to face\r\nthe 3,000 or 4,000 irregulars under Mina’s command, they endeavoured\r\nto converge upon him, and to enclose him within the net of their\r\noperations. The chase was very hot in March: on the first of that month\r\nCaffarelli invaded the remote Pyrenean valley of Roncal, where it had\r\nbeen discovered that Mina kept his dépôts, his ammunition factory, and\r\nhis hospitals. The valley was swept clean, but no appreciable number\r\nof the guerrilleros were captured. On the 24th, however, it looked as\r\nif disaster was impending, as three columns under Abbé, Dumoustier\r\n(who had a brigade of the Young Guard), and Laferrière had succeeded\r\nin disposing themselves around Mina’s main body, between Sanguessa and\r\nOchagavia. The guerrillero, however, saved himself by a night march\r\nof incredible difficulty across impracticable hills, and got away\r\ninto Aragon. He was lost to sight, and was believed to have been too\r\nharassed to be formidable for many a day.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the true state of affairs. Mina at once came back to his\r\nold haunts, by a circuitous march through southern Navarre, and on\r\nApril 9th performed one of his most notable exploits. On that day he\r\nsurprised an immense convoy of convalescents, civilians, baggage, and\r\nfood-stuffs, which was marching from Vittoria to Mondragon, in the\r\nPass of Salinas (or Puerto de Arlaban). Though escorted by 2,000 men\r\n(including the whole of the 7th Polish regiment just drawn off from\r\nSoult for the Russian war), it was completely destroyed. Five hundred\r\nof the Poles were slain, 150 captured, and an enormous booty, including\r\n(it is said) several hundred thousand francs in cash, fell into Mina’s\r\nhands. He also delivered 450 Spanish prisoners, who were being\r\nconducted to captivity beyond the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nSuch an exploit naturally drew down once more upon Mina the attention\r\nof all the neighbouring French commanders: Dorsenne and Reille again\r\nsent columns to aid the governor of Navarre, and from the 23rd to\r\nthe 28th of April Mina was being hunted by powerful detachments\r\nconverging on him from all sides[97]. He himself was very nearly\r\ncaptured at Robres by General Pannetier--who surprised him at dawn,\r\nhelped by treachery on the part of a subordinate guerrillero chief,\r\nand dispersed his followers for the moment[98]. But all who were not\r\nslain or captured rallied around their indomitable leader, and followed\r\nhim in a hazardous retreat, in which he threaded his way between the\r\nconverging columns of the French and ultimately escaped to the Rioja.\r\nHe asserts in his Memoirs, and with truth, that he was at this time of\r\nthe highest service to Wellington’s main operations, since he attracted\r\nand detained beyond the Ebro such a large proportion of Dorsenne’s Army\r\nof the North, that in April and May it had not a man to spare to help\r\nMarmont. Even Dumoustier’s Guard division, under orders to return to\r\nFrance for the Russian war, was put into the pack of pursuers who tried\r\nin vain to hunt him down.\r\n\r\n  [97] There seems to be an error of dates in Napier, iv. p. 172,\r\n  concerning Mina’s operations, as the surprise of the convoy at\r\n  Salinas is put _after_ Mina’s escape from Pannetier at Robres.\r\n  But Mina’s own Memoirs fix the date of the latter as April 23rd,\r\n  1812, while the former certainly happened on April 7th. Toreno\r\n  (iii. p. 87) has got the sequence right.\r\n\r\n  [98] There is a curious and interesting account of this in Mina’s\r\n  own Memoirs, pp. 31-2, where he relates his narrow escape,\r\n  and tells how he had the pleasure of hanging his treacherous\r\n  lieutenant, and three local alcaldes, who had conspired to keep\r\n  from him the news of Pannetier’s approach.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the results of all the operations in Catalonia, Aragon,\r\nand Navarre, which followed on the release of Reille’s troops from\r\nthe Valencian expedition, it may be said that Napoleon’s scheme for\r\nthe complete reduction of north-eastern Spain had completely failed\r\nby April. Large forces had been put in motion; toilsome marches had\r\nbeen executed over many mountain roads in the worst season of the\r\nyear; all the bands of the insurgents had been more than once defeated\r\nand dispersed. But the country-side was not conquered: the isolated\r\ngarrisons were still cut off from each other by the enemy, wherever\r\nthe heavy marching columns had passed on. The communications were no\r\nmore safe and free than they had been in December. The loss of men\r\nby sickness and in the innumerable petty combats and disasters had\r\nbeen immense. The game had yet to be finished, and the spare time in\r\nwhich it could be conducted was drawing to an end. For Wellington was\r\non the march, and ere long not a man from the Armies of the North or\r\nthe Centre was to be available to aid Reille, Suchet, and Decaen in\r\ntheir unending and ungrateful task. Gone, too, were the days in which\r\nreserves without end could be poured in from France: the Russian war\r\nwas about to open, and when once it began reinforcements were to be\r\ndrawn from Spain rather than sent into it. The invasion had reached\r\nits high-water mark in January 1812 before the walls of Valencia and\r\nAlicante.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS OF SOULT IN ANDALUSIA: THE SIEGE OF TARIFA, DEC. 1811-JAN.\r\n1812\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the south-west no less than in the south-east of Spain the month\r\nof January 1812 was to witness the last offensive movement of the\r\nFrench armies of invasion. But while Suchet’s advance ended, as we\r\nhave seen, in a splendid success, that of Soult was to meet with a\r\ndisastrous check. Neither marshal was to have another chance of taking\r\nthe initiative--thanks, directly or indirectly, to the working out of\r\nWellington’s great plan of campaign for the New Year.\r\n\r\nIn the previous volume the fortunes of Soult and the Army of Andalusia\r\nwere narrated down to the first days of November 1811, when Hill’s raid\r\ninto Estremadura, after the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos, ended with\r\nhis retreat within the borders of Portugal. That raid had inflicted\r\na severe blow on Drouet’s corps of observation, which formed Soult’s\r\nright wing, and covered his communications with Badajoz. But its net\r\nresult was only to restrict the activities of the French on this side\r\nto that part of Estremadura which lies south of the Guadiana. Hill\r\nhad made no attempt to drive away Drouet’s main body, or to blockade\r\nBadajoz, and had betaken himself to winter quarters about Elvas,\r\nPortalegre, and Estremos. Consequently Drouet was able to settle\r\ndown opposite him once more, in equally widespread cantonments, with\r\nhis right wing at Merida, and his left at Zafra, and to devote his\r\nattention to sending successive convoys forward to Badajoz, whenever\r\nthe stores in that fortress showed signs of running low. Drouet’s\r\nforce no longer bore the name of the ‘5th Corps’--all the old corps\r\ndistinctions were abolished in the Southern Army this autumn, and no\r\norganization larger than that of the divisions was permitted to remain.\r\nThe troops in Estremadura were simply for the future Drouet’s and\r\nDaricau’s divisions of the ‘Armée du Midi.’ The composition of this\r\n‘containing force,’ whose whole purpose was now to observe Hill, was\r\nsomewhat changed after midwinter: for the Emperor sent orders that the\r\n34th and 40th regiments, the victims of Girard’s carelessness at Arroyo\r\ndos Molinos, were to be sent home to France to recruit their much\r\ndepleted ranks. They duly left Drouet, and marched off northward[99],\r\nbut they never got further than Burgos, where Dorsenne detained them\r\nat a moment of need, so that they became attached to the ‘Army of\r\nthe North,’ and (after receiving some drafts) were involved in the\r\noperations against Wellington in the valley of the Douro. Two regiments\r\nfrom Andalusia (the 12th Léger and 45th Line) came up to replace them\r\nin Drouet’s division, but even then the French troops in Estremadura\r\ndid not exceed 13,500 men, if the garrison of Badajoz (about 5,000\r\nstrong) be deducted. This constituted a field-force insufficient to\r\nhold back Hill when next he should take the offensive; but all through\r\nNovember and far into December Hill remained quiescent, by Wellington’s\r\norders, and his adversary clung to his advanced positions as long as he\r\ncould, though much disturbed as to what the future might bring forth.\r\n\r\n  [99] Napoleon to Berthier, Dec. 30, 1811, speaks of the order\r\n  to march having been _already_ given. The two regiments were\r\n  in Castile by March: when precisely they left Drouet I cannot\r\n  say--perhaps as late as February.\r\n\r\nOf the remainder of Soult’s army, the troops in front of Cadiz,\r\noriginally the 1st Corps, had been cut down to an irreducible minimum,\r\nby the necessity for keeping flank-guards to either side, to watch the\r\nSpanish forces in the Condado de Niebla on the west and the mountains\r\nof Ronda on the south. Even including the marines and sailors of the\r\nflotilla, there were seldom 20,000 men in the Lines, and the Spanish\r\nforce in Cadiz and the Isle of Leon, stiffened by the Anglo-Portuguese\r\ndetachment which Wellington always retained there, was often not\r\ninferior in numbers to the besiegers. The bombardment from the heavy\r\nVilloutreys mortars, placed in the works of the Matagorda peninsula,\r\ncontinued intermittently: but, though a shell occasionally fell in\r\nthe city, no appreciable harm was done. The inhabitants killed or\r\ninjured by many months of shelling could be counted on the fingers of\r\ntwo hands. The citizens had come to take the occasional descent of a\r\nmissile in their streets with philosophic calm, and sang a derisive\r\nstreet ditty which told how\r\n\r\n    ‘De las bombas que tiran los Gavachos\r\n    Se hacen las Gaditanas tirabuzones.’\r\n\r\n‘The splinters of the bombs that the French threw served the ladies of\r\nCadiz as weights to curl their hair[100].’\r\n\r\n  [100] See Schepeler, p. 172.\r\n\r\nThe Fort of Puntales, on the easternmost point of the isthmus that\r\nlinks Cadiz to the Isle of Leon, felt the bombardment more severely,\r\nbut was never seriously injured, and always succeeded in keeping up\r\nan effective return fire. With the artillery of those days--even when\r\nmortars of the largest calibre, specially cast in the arsenal of\r\nSeville, were used--Cadiz was safe from any real molestation.\r\n\r\nMarshal Victor was still in command of the troops in the Lines at the\r\nend of 1811, but the Emperor gave orders for his return to France,\r\nwhen he ordered the Army of Andalusia to drop its organization into\r\narmy-corps, and replaced them by divisions. He directed that the\r\nMarshal should set out at once, unless he was engaged in some serious\r\nenterprise at the moment that the summons arrived. This--as we shall\r\nsee--chanced to be the case, and Victor was still hard at work in\r\nJanuary, and did not leave Spain till early in April.\r\n\r\nThe third main section of Soult’s troops consisted of the two infantry\r\nand one cavalry divisions which had lately formed the 4th Corps, and\r\nhad, since their first arrival in the South, been told off for the\r\noccupation of the kingdom of Granada. The whole of the coast and the\r\ninland from Malaga as far as Baza fell to their charge. The corps had\r\nbeen a strong one--16,000 foot and 4,000 horse--but was shortly to be\r\nreduced; the order of December 30, recalling troops for the expected\r\nRussian war, took off the whole Polish infantry division of Dembouski,\r\n5,000 bayonets: the regiment of Lancers of the Vistula, who had won\r\nsuch fame by their charge at Albuera, was also requisitioned, but did\r\nnot get off till the autumn. But in the last month of the old year\r\nthe Poles were still present and available, and Soult was far from\r\nexpecting their departure. Yet even before they were withdrawn the\r\ngarrison of the kingdom of Granada was by no means too strong for the\r\nwork allotted to it. The greater part of its available field-force\r\nhad been drawn to the south-west, to curb the insurrection of the\r\n_Serranos_ of the Ronda mountains, and the inroads of Ballasteros.\r\nThe forces left in Granada itself and the other eastern towns were so\r\nmodest that Soult protested, and apparently with truth, that he could\r\nnot spare from them even a small flying column of all arms, to make the\r\ndemonstration against Murcia in assistance of Suchet’s operations which\r\nthe Emperor ordered him to execute. Nothing, as it will be remembered,\r\nwas done in this direction during December and January, save the\r\nsending out of Pierre Soult’s raid[101], a mere affair of a single\r\ncavalry brigade.\r\n\r\n  [101] See above, p. 81.\r\n\r\nThe total force of the Andalusian army was still in December as high\r\nas 80,000 men on paper. But after deducting the sick, the garrison\r\nof Badajoz--5,000 men,--the troops of Drouet, entirely taken up with\r\nobserving and containing Hill, the divisions in the Lines before Cadiz,\r\nand the obligatory garrisons of Granada, Malaga, Cordova, and other\r\nlarge towns, the surplus left over for active operations was very\r\nsmall. At the most ten or twelve thousand men, obtained by borrowing\r\nfrom all sides, could be formed to act as a central reserve, prepared\r\nto assist Drouet in Estremadura, Victor in the Cadiz region, or Leval\r\nin the East, as occasion might demand. During the two crises when Soult\r\nbrought up his reserves to join Drouet, in the winter of 1811-12 and\r\nthe spring of 1812, their joint force did not exceed 25,000 men. The\r\nMarshal was resolved to hold the complete circuit of Andalusia, the\r\nviceroyalty which brought him so much pride and profit; and so long as\r\nhe persisted in this resolve he could make no offensive move, for want\r\nof a field army of competent strength.\r\n\r\nSoult made some effort to supplement the strength of his garrisons by\r\nraising Spanish levies--both battalions and squadrons of regulars,\r\nand units for local service in the style of urban guards. The former\r\n‘Juramentados’ never reached any great strength: they were composed\r\nof deserters, or prisoners who volunteered service in order to avoid\r\nbeing sent to France. Occasionally there were as many as 5,000 under\r\narms--usually less. The men for the most part disappeared at the first\r\nopportunity, and rejoined the national army or the guerrilleros: the\r\nofficers were less prone to abscond, because they were liable to\r\nbe shot as traitors on returning to their countrymen. Two or three\r\ncases are recorded of such renegades who committed suicide, when they\r\nsaw themselves about to fall into the hands of Spanish troops[102].\r\nThe urban guards or ‘escopeteros’ were of a little more service,\r\nfor the reason that, being interested in the preservation of their\r\nown families, goods, and houses, they would often prevent the entry\r\ninto their towns of any roving Spanish force which showed itself for\r\na moment. For if they admitted any small band, which went on its\r\nway immediately, and could make no attempt to defend them on the\r\nreappearance of the enemy, they were liable to be executed as traitors\r\nby the French, and their town would be fined or perhaps sacked. Hence\r\nit was to their interest, so long as Soult continued to dominate all\r\nAndalusia, to keep the guerrilleros outside their walls. But their\r\nservice was, of course, unwilling; and they were usually ready to\r\nyield on the appearance of any serious Spanish force, whose size was\r\nsufficient to excuse their submission in the eyes of Soult. Often a\r\ntown was ostensibly held for King Joseph, but was privately supplying\r\nrecruits, provisions, and money contributions to the national cause.\r\nNevertheless there were real ‘Afrancesados’ in Andalusia, people who\r\nhad so far committed themselves to the cause of King Joseph that they\r\ncould not contemplate the triumph of the Patriots without terror. When\r\nSoult evacuated Andalusia in September 1812 several thousand refugees\r\nfollowed him, rather than face the vengeance of their countrymen.\r\n\r\n  [102] One case is noted of a captain of the ‘Juramentado’\r\n  detachment at Badajoz who blew himself from a gun when he saw\r\n  the place taken (Lamare’s _Défense de Badajoz_, p. 260). Carlos\r\n  de España shot the other five Spanish officers captured on that\r\n  occasion (Belmas, iv. p. 362).\r\n\r\nDuring the midwinter of 1811-12 Soult’s main attention was taken up by\r\na serious enterprise in the extreme south of his viceroyalty, which\r\nabsorbed all the spare battalions of his small central reserve, and\r\nrendered it impossible for him to take the offensive in any other\r\ndirection. This was the attempt to crush Ballasteros, and to capture\r\nTarifa, which rendered his co-operation in Suchet’s Valencian campaign\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ballasteros, as it will be remembered, had landed from Cadiz\r\nat Algeciras on September 4th, 1811, and had been much hunted during\r\nthe autumn by detachments drawn both from the troops in the kingdom of\r\nGranada and those of Victor[103]. As many as 10,000 men were pressing\r\nhim in October, when he had been forced to take refuge under the cannon\r\nof Gibraltar. But when want of food compelled the columns of Barrois,\r\nSémélé, and Godinot to withdraw and to disperse, he had emerged\r\nfrom his refuge, had followed the retiring enemy, and had inflicted\r\nsome damage on their rearguards [November 5, 1811]. His triumphant\r\nsurvival, after the first concentrated movement made against him, had\r\nmuch provoked Soult, who saw the insurrectionary movement in southern\r\nAndalusia spreading all along the mountains, and extending itself\r\ntowards Malaga on the one side and Arcos on the other. The Marshal,\r\ntherefore, determined to make a serious effort to crush Ballasteros,\r\nand at the same time to destroy one of the two bases from which he was\r\nwont to operate. Gibraltar was, of course, impregnable: but Tarifa, the\r\nother fortress at the southern end of the Peninsula, was not, and had\r\nproved from time to time very useful to the Spaniards. It was now their\r\nonly secure foothold in southern Andalusia, and was most useful as a\r\nport of call for vessels going round from Cadiz to the Mediterranean,\r\nespecially for the large flotilla of British and Spanish sloops, brigs,\r\nand gunboats, which obsessed the coast of Andalusia, and made the use\r\nof routes by the seaside almost impracticable for the enemy. Soult\r\nwas at this time trying to open up communications with the Moors of\r\nTangier, from whom he hoped to get horses for his cavalry, and oxen for\r\nthe army before Cadiz. But he could not hope to accomplish anything\r\nin this way so long as Tarifa was the nest and victualling-place of\r\nprivateers, who lay thick in the straits only a few miles from the\r\ncoast of Morocco.\r\n\r\n  [103] See vol. iii. pp. 594-5.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for attacking Tarifa, however, was that it had recently\r\nbecome the head-quarters of a small Anglo-Spanish field-force, which\r\nhad been molesting the rear of the lines before Cadiz. The place had\r\nnot been garrisoned in 1810, when Soult first broke into Andalusia:\r\nbut a few months after General Colin Campbell, governor of Gibraltar,\r\nthrew into it a small force, that same battalion of flank-companies\r\nof the 9th, 28th, 30th, and 47th Foot, which distinguished itself so\r\nmuch at Barrosa in the following year, when led by Colonel Brown of the\r\n28th. This hard fighter had moved on with his regiment later in 1811,\r\nbut his place had been taken by Major King of the 82nd--a one-legged\r\nofficer of great energy and resolution[104]. The garrison was trifling\r\ndown to October 1811, when General Campbell threw into Tarifa a brigade\r\nunder Colonel Skerrett, consisting of the 2/47th and 2/87th, and some\r\ndetails[105], making (with the original garrison) 1,750 British troops.\r\nThree days later the Spaniards sent in from Cadiz another brigade[106]\r\nof about the same strength, under General Copons. After the French\r\nexpedition against Ballasteros had failed, Copons and Skerrett went\r\nout and drove from Vejer the southernmost outposts of Victor’s corps\r\nin the Lines (November 6th). A fortnight later they marched across the\r\nhills to Algeciras, and prepared to join Ballasteros in an attack on\r\nthe French troops in the direction of Ronda, but returned to Tarifa\r\non the news that Victor was showing a considerable force at Vejer,\r\nand threatening to cut them off from their base[107]. Ballasteros by\r\nhimself was a sufficient nuisance to Soult, but when his operations\r\nbegan to be aided by another separate force, partly composed of\r\nBritish troops, the Duke of Dalmatia determined that a clean sweep must\r\nbe made in southern Andalusia.\r\n\r\n  [104] After the 28th went off, the flank-companies were those of\r\n  the 2/11th, 2/47th, and 1/82nd, two from each battalion.\r\n\r\n  [105] 2/47th (8 companies) 570 men, 2/87th (560 men), 1 company\r\n  95th (75 men), 70 2nd Hussars K.G.L., 1 field-battery (Captain\r\n  Hughes) 83 men, or in all 1,358 of all ranks.\r\n\r\n  [106] A battalion each of Irlanda and Cantabria, and some\r\n  light companies of cazadores, with 120 gunners and 25 cavalry,\r\n  amounting to about 1,650 men (sick included).\r\n\r\n  [107] For details of these operations see the anonymous _Defence\r\n  of Tarifa_ (London, 1812), and letters in Rait’s _Life of Lord\r\n  Gough_, i. pp. 69-70.\r\n\r\nThe idea of capturing Tarifa did not appear by any means impracticable.\r\nThis little decayed place of 6,000 souls had never been fortified in\r\nthe modern style, and was surrounded by nothing more than a mediaeval\r\nwall eight feet thick, with square towers set in it at intervals.\r\nThere was a citadel, the castle of Guzman El Bueno[108], but this,\r\ntoo, was a thirteenth-century building, and the whole place, though\r\ntenable against an enemy unprovided with artillery, was reckoned\r\nhelpless against siege-guns. It is described by one of its defenders\r\nas ‘lying in a hole,’ for it was completely commanded by a range of\r\nlow heights, at no greater distance than 300 yards from its northern\r\nfront. In the sea, half a mile beyond it, was a rocky island, connected\r\nwith the mainland by a very narrow strip of sand, which was well\r\nsuited to serve as a final place of refuge for the garrison, and\r\nwhich had been carefully fortified. It was furnished with batteries,\r\nof which one bore on the sand-spit and the town: a redoubt (Santa\r\nCatalina) had been erected at the point where the isthmus joined the\r\nmainland: several buildings had been erected to serve as a shelter\r\nfor troops, and a great series of caves (Cueva de los Moros) had been\r\nconverted into casemates and store-rooms: they were perfectly safe\r\nagainst bombardment. In the eyes of many officers the island was\r\nthe real stronghold, and the city was but an outwork to it, which\r\nmight be evacuated without any serious damage to the strength of the\r\ndefence. Nevertheless something had been done to improve the weak\r\nfortifications of the place: the convent of San Francisco, seventy\r\nyards from its northern point, had been entrenched and loopholed, to\r\nserve as a redoubt, and some of the square towers in the _enceinte_ had\r\nbeen strengthened and built up so as to bear artillery. The curtain,\r\nhowever, was in all parts far too narrow and weak to allow of guns\r\nbeing placed upon it, and there was no glacis and practically no\r\nditch, the whole wall to its foot being visible from the heights which\r\noverlook the city on its eastern side. There were only twenty-six\r\nguns available, and of these part belonged to the defences of the\r\nisland. In the town itself there were only two heavy guns mounted on\r\ncommanding towers, six field-pieces (9-pounders) distributed along the\r\nvarious fronts, and four mortars. When the siege actually began, the\r\nmain defence was by musketry fire. It was clear from the topography of\r\nTarifa that its northern front, that nearest to and most completely\r\ncommanded by the hills outside, would be the probable point of attack\r\nby the enemy; and long before the siege began preparations were made\r\nfor an interior defence. The buildings looking on the back of the\r\nramparts were barricaded and loopholed, the narrow streets were blocked\r\nwith traverses, and some ‘entanglements’ were contrived with the iron\r\nwindow-bars requisitioned from all the houses of the town, which served\r\nas a sort of _chevaux de frise_. The outer _enceinte_ was so weak that\r\nit was intended that the main defence should be in the network of\r\nstreets. Special preparations were thought out for the right-centre of\r\nthe north front, where the walls are pierced by the ravine of a winter\r\ntorrent of intermittent flow, called the Retiro. The point where it\r\nmade its passage under the _enceinte_ through a portcullis was the\r\nlowest place in the front, the walls sinking down as they followed\r\nthe outline of the ravine. Wherefore palisades were planted outside\r\nthe portcullis, entanglements behind it, and all the houses looking\r\ndown on the torrent bed within the walls were prepared with loopholes\r\ncommanding its course[109]. There was ample time for work, for while\r\nthe first certain news that the French were coming arrived in November,\r\nthe enemy did not actually appear before the walls till December 20. By\r\nthat time much had been done, though the balance was only completed in\r\nhaste after the siege had begun.\r\n\r\n  [108] This was the famous knight who, holding the place for King\r\n  Sancho IV in 1294, refused to surrender it when the Moors brought\r\n  his son, captured in a skirmish, before the walls, and threatened\r\n  to behead him if his father refused to capitulate. Guzman would\r\n  not yield, saw his son slain, and successfully maintained the\r\n  fortress.\r\n\r\n  [109] For these precautions, the work of Captain Charles Smith,\r\n  R.E., see the anonymous _Defence of Tarifa_ (p. 62), and Napier,\r\n  iv. pp. 59-60.\r\n\r\nThe long delay of the enemy was caused by the abominable condition of\r\nthe roads of the district--the same that had given Graham and La Peña\r\nso much trouble in February 1811[110]: moreover, any considerable\r\nconcentration of troops in southern Andalusia raised a food problem\r\nfor Soult. The region round Tarifa is very thinly inhabited, and it\r\nwas clear that, if a large army were collected, it would have to carry\r\nits provisions with it, and secure its communication with its base,\r\nunder pain of falling into starvation within a few days. Heavy guns\r\nabounded in the Cadiz lines, and Soult had no trouble in selecting a\r\nsiege-train of sixteen pieces from them: but their transport and that\r\nof their ammunition was a serious problem. To complete the train no\r\nless than 500 horses had to be requisitioned from the field artillery\r\nand military wagons of the 1st Corps. While it was being collected,\r\nVictor moved forward to Vejer, near the coast, half-way between\r\nCadiz and Tarifa, with 2,000 men, in order to clear the country-side\r\nfrom the guerrillero bands, who made survey of the roads difficult\r\nand dangerous. Under cover of escorts furnished by him, several\r\nintelligence officers inspected the possible routes: there were two,\r\nboth passing through the mountainous tract between the sea and the\r\nlagoon of La Janda (which had given Graham so much trouble in the last\r\nspring). One came down to the waterside at the chapel of Virgen de\r\nla Luz, only three miles from Tarifa, but was reported to be a mere\r\nmule-track. The other, somewhat more resembling a road, descended to\r\nthe shore several miles farther to the north, and ran parallel with it\r\nfor some distance. But in expectation of the siege, the Spaniards, with\r\nhelp from English ships, had blown up many yards of this road, where\r\nit was narrowest between the water and the mountain. Moreover, ships\r\nof war were always stationed off Tarifa, and their guns would make\r\npassage along this defile dangerous. Nevertheless General Garbé, the\r\nchief French engineer, held that this was the only route practicable\r\nfor artillery, and reported that the road could be remade, and that\r\nthe flotilla might be kept at a distance by building batteries on\r\nthe shore, which would prevent any vessel from coming close enough\r\nto deliver an effective fire. It was determined, therefore, that the\r\nsiege-train should take this path, which for the first half of its way\r\npasses close along the marshy borders of the lagoon of La Janda, and\r\nthen enters the hills in order to descend to the sea at Torre Peña.\r\n\r\n  [110] See vol. iv. pp. 101-2.\r\n\r\nOn December 8th the siege-train was concentrated at Vejer, and in\r\nthe hope that it would in four days (or not much more) reach its\r\ndestination before Tarifa, Victor gave orders for the movement of the\r\ntroops which were to conduct the siege. Of this force the smaller\r\npart, six battalions[111] and two cavalry regiments, was drawn from\r\nLeval’s command, formerly the 4th Corps. These two divisions had also\r\nto provide other detachments to hold Malaga in strength, and watch\r\nBallasteros. The troops from the blockade of Cadiz supplied eight\r\nbattalions[112], and three more to keep up communications[113]; one\r\nadditional regiment was borrowed from the brigade in the kingdom of\r\nCordova, which was always drawn upon in times of special need[114]. The\r\nwhole force put in motion was some 15,000 men, but only 10,000 actually\r\ncame before Tarifa and took part in the siege.\r\n\r\n  [111] Two battalions each of 43rd Line and 7th and 9th Poles, and\r\n  16th and 21st Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [112] Three of 16th Léger, two of 54th Line, one each of 27th\r\n  Léger and 94th and 95th Line.\r\n\r\n  [113] Two of 63rd and one of 8th Line.\r\n\r\n  [114] 51st Line.\r\n\r\nThe various columns, which were under orders to march, came from\r\ndistant points, and had to concentrate. Barrois lay at Los Barrios,\r\ninland from Algeciras, with six battalions from the Cadiz lines,\r\nwatching Ballasteros, who had once more fallen back under shelter of\r\nthe guns of Gibraltar. To this point Leval came to join him, with the\r\n3,000 men drawn from Malaga and Granada. The third column, under Victor\r\nhimself, consisting of the siege-train and the battalions told off for\r\nits escort, came from the side of Vejer. All three were to meet before\r\nTarifa: but from the first start difficulties began to arise owing to\r\nthe bad weather.\r\n\r\nThe winter, which had hitherto been mild and equable, broke up into\r\nunending rain-storms on the day appointed for the start, and the sudden\r\nfilling of the torrents in the mountains cut the communications between\r\nthe columns. Leval, who had got as far as the pass of Ojen, in the\r\nrange which separates the district about Algeciras and Los Barrios\r\nfrom the Tarifa region, was forced to halt there for some days: but\r\nhis rear, a brigade under Cassagne, could not come forward to join\r\nhim, nor did the convoy-column succeed in advancing far from Vejer.\r\nVictor sent three successive officers with escorts to try to get into\r\ntouch with Cassagne, but each returned without having been able to push\r\nthrough. It was not till the 12th that a fourth succeeded in reaching\r\nthe belated column, which only got under way that day and joined on\r\nthe following afternoon. The siege-train was not less delayed, and was\r\nblocked for several days by the overflowing of the lagoon of La Janda,\r\nalong whose shore its first stages lay. It only struggled through to\r\nthe south end of the lagoon on the 14th, and took no less than four\r\ndays more to cover the distance of sixteen miles across the hills to\r\nTorre Peña, where the road comes down to the sea. Forty horses, it is\r\nsaid, had to be harnessed to each heavy gun to pull it through[115].\r\nMuch of the ammunition was spoilt by the rain, which continued to fall\r\nintermittently, and more had to be requisitioned from the Cadiz lines,\r\nand to be brought forward by supplementary convoys.\r\n\r\n  [115] For details of this toilsome march see Belmas, iv. pp.\r\n  15-17.\r\n\r\nThese initial delays went far to wreck the whole scheme, because of\r\nthe food problem. Each of the columns had to bring its own provisions\r\nwith it, and, when stopped on the road, consumed stores that had been\r\nintended to serve it during the siege. The distance from Vejer to\r\nTarifa is only thirty miles, and from Los Barrios to Tarifa even less:\r\nbut the columns, which had been ordered to march on December 8th, did\r\nnot reach their destination till December 20th, and the communications\r\nbehind them were cut already, not by the enemy but by the vile weather,\r\nwhich had turned every mountain stream into a torrent, and every\r\nlow-lying bottom into a marsh. The column with the siege artillery\r\narrived two days later: it had got safely through the defile of Torre\r\nPeña: the sappers had repaired the road by the water, and had built\r\na masked battery for four 12-pounders and two howitzers, whose fire\r\nkept off from the dangerous point several Spanish and English gunboats\r\nwhich came up to dispute the passage. The column from the pass of Ojen\r\nhad been somewhat delayed in its march by a sally of Ballasteros, who\r\ncame out from the Gibraltar lines on the 17th-18th and fell upon its\r\nrear with 2,000 men. He drove in the last battalion, but when Barrois\r\nturned back and attacked him with a whole brigade, the Spaniard gave\r\nway and retreated in haste to San Roque. Nevertheless, by issuing from\r\nhis refuge and appearing in the open, he had cut the communications\r\nbetween the army destined for the siege and the troops at Malaga. At\r\nthe same time that Ballasteros made this diversion, Skerrett, with his\r\nwhole brigade and a few of Copons’s Spaniards, had issued from Tarifa\r\nto demonstrate against the head of the approaching French column, and\r\nadvanced some distance on the road to Fascinas, where his handful of\r\nhussars bickered with the leading cavalry in the enemy’s front. Seeing\r\ninfantry behind, he took his main body no farther forward than the\r\nconvent of Nuestra Señora de la Luz, three miles from the fortress. On\r\nthe 19th the French showed 4,000 men on the surrounding hills, and on\r\nthe 20th advanced in force in two columns, and pushed the English and\r\nSpanish pickets into Tarifa, after a long skirmish in which the British\r\nhad 31, the Spaniards about 40 casualties, while the French, according\r\nto Leval’s report, lost only 1 officer and 3 men killed and 27 wounded.\r\nBy four in the afternoon the place was invested--the French pickets\r\nreaching from sea to sea, and their main body being encamped behind the\r\nhills which command the northern side of Tarifa. They could not place\r\nthemselves near the water, owing to the fire of two British frigates\r\nand a swarm of gunboats, which lay in-shore, and shelled their flanks\r\nall day, though without great effect.\r\n\r\nCopons and Skerrett had divided the manning of the town and island\r\nbetween their brigades on equal terms, each keeping two battalions in\r\nthe town and a third in the island and the minor posts. Of the British\r\nthe 47th and 87th had the former, King’s battalion of flank-companies\r\n(reinforced by 70 marines landed from the ships) the latter charge. The\r\nconvent of San Francisco was held by a company of the 82nd, the redoubt\r\nof Santa Catalina on the isthmus by one of the 11th. Seeing the French\r\ninactive on the 21st--they were waiting for the siege-train which was\r\nnot yet arrived--Skerrett sent out three companies to drive in their\r\npickets, and shelled the heights behind which they were encamped. On\r\nthe following day the sortie was repeated, by a somewhat larger force\r\nunder Colonel Gough of the 87th, covered by a flanking fire from the\r\ngunboats. The right wing of the French pickets was driven in with some\r\nloss, and a house too near the Santa Catalina redoubt demolished. The\r\nbesiegers lost 3 men killed and 4 officers and 19 men wounded, mainly\r\nfrom the 16th Léger. The sallying troops had only 1 man killed and 5\r\nwounded (2 from the 11th, 4 from the 87th). That night the siege-train\r\narrived, and was parked behind the right-hand hill of the three which\r\nface the northern side of Tarifa.\r\n\r\nThe engineer officers who had come up with the siege-train executed\r\ntheir survey of the fortress next morning, and reported (as might have\r\nbeen expected) that it would be best to attack the central portion of\r\nthe north front, because the ground facing it was not exposed to any\r\nfire from the vessels in-shore, as was the west front, and could only\r\nbe searched by the two or three guns which the besieged had mounted\r\non the towers of Jesus and of Guzman, the one in the midst of the\r\nnorthern front, the other in a dominating position by the castle, at\r\nthe southern corner. However, the 24-pounders on the island, shooting\r\nover the town, could throw shells on to the hillside where the French\r\nwere about to work, though without being able to judge of their effect.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23rd the French began their first parallel, on\r\ntheir right flank of the central hill, at a distance of 300 yards from\r\nthe walls: the approaches to it needed no spadework, being completely\r\nscreened by a ravine and a thick aloe hedge. The besieged shelled it on\r\nthe succeeding day, but with small effect--only 3 workers were killed\r\nand 4 wounded. On the 24th a minor front of attack was developed on\r\nthe left-hand hill, where a first parallel was thrown up about 250\r\nyards from the walls. The gunboats on the southern shore fired on this\r\nwork when it was discovered, but as it was invisible to them, and as\r\nthey could only shoot at haphazard, by directions signalled from the\r\ntown, they generally failed to hit the mark, and did little to prevent\r\nthe progress of the digging. The besiegers only lost 4 killed and 25\r\nwounded this day, and on the original point of attack were able to\r\ncommence a second parallel, in which there was marked out the place for\r\nthe battery which was destined to breach the town wall at the lowest\r\npoint of its circuit, just south of the bed of the Retiro torrent.\r\n\r\nOn the two following days the French continued to push forward with\r\nno great difficulty; they completed the second parallel on the centre\r\nhill, parts of which were only 180 yards from the town. On the left or\r\neastern hill the trenches were continued down the inner slope, as far\r\nas the bottom of the ravine, so as almost to join those of the right\r\nattack. On the 26th a violent south-east gale began to blow, which\r\ncompelled the British and Spanish gunboats to quit their station to\r\nthe right of Tarifa, lest they should be driven ashore, and to run\r\nround to the west side of the island which gave them shelter from wind\r\ncoming from such a quarter. The French works were, therefore, only\r\nmolested for the future by the little 6-pounders on the north-east (or\r\nCorchuela) tower, and the heavy guns firing at a high trajectory from\r\nthe island and the tower of Guzman.\r\n\r\nBut the gale was accompanied by rain, and this, beginning with\r\nmoderate showers on the 26th, developed into a steady downpour on the\r\n27th and 28th, and commenced to make the spadework in the trenches\r\nmore laborious, as the sappers were up to their ankles in mud, and\r\nthe excavated earth did not bind easily into parapets owing to its\r\nsemi-liquid condition. Nevertheless the plans of the engineers were\r\ncarried out, and two batteries were finished and armed on the central\r\nhill, one lower down to batter the walls, the other higher up, to deal\r\nwith the guns of the besieged and silence them if possible. The French\r\nlined all the advanced parallel with sharpshooters, who kept up a heavy\r\nfire on the ramparts, and would have made it difficult for the garrison\r\nto maintain a reply, if a large consignment of sandbags had not been\r\nreceived from Gibraltar, with which cover was contrived for the men on\r\nthe curtain, and the artillery in the towers.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock on the morning of the 29th the two French batteries\r\nopened[116], with twelve heavy guns. The weakness of the old town\r\nwall at once became evident: the first shot fired went completely\r\nthrough it, and lodged in a house to its rear. Before evening there\r\nwas a definite breach produced, just south of the Retiro ravine,\r\nand it was clear that the enemy would be able to increase it to any\r\nextent that he pleased--the masonry fell to pieces the moment that\r\nit was well pounded. The two small field-guns on the tower of Jesus\r\nwere silenced by 3 o’clock, and the heavy gun on Guzman’s tower also\r\nceased firing--of which more anon. By night only the distant guns on\r\nthe island, and the ships in the south-western bay, were making an\r\neffective reply to the French.\r\n\r\n  [116] The breaching battery on the lower slope with four 16-\r\n  and two 12-pounders: the upper battery with four howitzers\r\n  for high-trajectory fire against the more distant guns of the\r\n  besieged and the island, and two 12-pounders.\r\n\r\nThis, from the psychological point of view, was the critical day of the\r\nsiege, for on the clear demonstration of the weakness of the walls,\r\nColonel Skerrett, who had never much confidence in his defences,\r\nproposed to evacuate the city of Tarifa. At a council of officers he\r\nargued in favour of withdrawing the garrison into the island, and\r\nmaking no attempt to hold the weak mediaeval walls which the French\r\nwere so effectively battering. This would have been equivalent, in the\r\nend, to abandoning the entire foothold of the British on this point of\r\nthe coast. For there was on the island no cover for troops, save two\r\nor three recently erected buildings, and the recesses of the ‘Cueva de\r\nlos Moros.’ Some of the inhabitants had already taken refuge there,\r\nand were suffering great privations, from being exposed to the weather\r\nin tents and hastily contrived huts. It is clear that if 3,000 men,\r\nBritish and Spanish, had been lodged on the wind-swept rocks of the\r\nisland, it would soon have been necessary to withdraw them; however\r\ninaccessible the water-girt rock, with its low cliffs, might be, no\r\nlarge body of troops could have lived long upon it, exposed as they\r\nwould have been not only to wind and wet, but to constant molestation\r\nby heavy guns placed in and about the city and the hills that dominate\r\nit. Meanwhile the French would have possessed the excellent cover of\r\nthe houses of Tarifa, and would have effectively blocked the island\r\nby leaving a garrison to watch the causeway, the only possible exit\r\nfrom it. It is certain that the abandonment of the island would have\r\nfollowed that of the town within a few days: indeed Skerrett had\r\nalready obtained leave from General Cooke, then commanding at Cadiz,\r\nto bring his brigade round to that port as soon as he should feel it\r\nnecessary. He regarded the evacuation of the place as so certain, that\r\nhe ordered the 18-pounder gun on Guzman’s tower to be spiked this day,\r\nthough it was the only piece of heavy calibre in the city[117]--the\r\nreason given was that one of its missiles (spherical case-shot) had\r\nfallen short within the streets, and killed or wounded an inhabitant.\r\nBut the real cause was that he had fully decided on abandoning Tarifa\r\nthat night or the following day, and thought the moving of such a big\r\ngun in a hurry impossible--it had been hoisted with great difficulty to\r\nits place by the sailors, with cranes and tackle[118].\r\n\r\n  [117] According to some authorities he also spiked a 32-lb.\r\n  carronade. See _Defence of Tarifa_, p. 63.\r\n\r\n  [118] The author of the _Defence of Tarifa_ pretends not to know\r\n  the real story (p. 63), saying that the spiking caused much\r\n  ‘indignation, apprehension, and discontent,’ and that ‘whence the\r\n  order proceeded is unknown.’ For the explanation see the letter\r\n  from an officer of the garrison in Napier, iv, Appendix, p. 438.\r\n\r\nSkerrett stated his decision in favour of the evacuation at the\r\ncouncil of war, produced General Cooke’s letter supporting his plan,\r\nand stated that Lord Proby, his second in command, concurred in the\r\nview of its necessity. Fortunately for the credit of the British arms,\r\nhis opinion was boldly traversed by Captain C. F. Smith, the senior\r\nengineer officer, Major King commanding the Gibraltar battalion of\r\nflank-companies, and Colonel Gough of the 87th. The former urged that\r\nthe town should be defended, as an outwork of the island, to the last\r\npossible moment: though the breach was practicable, he had already made\r\narrangements for cutting it off by retrenchments from the body of the\r\ntown. The streets had been blocked and barricaded, and all the houses\r\nlooking upon the back of the walls loopholed. Tarifa could be defended\r\nfor some time in the style of Saragossa, lane by lane. He pointed\r\nout that such was the configuration of the ground that if the enemy\r\nentered the breach, he would find a fourteen-foot drop between its\r\nrear and the ground below, on to which he would have to descend under\r\na concentric fire of musketry from all the neighbouring buildings.\r\nEven supposing that the worst came, the garrison had the castle to\r\nretire into, and this was tenable until breached by artillery, while a\r\nretreat from it to the island would always be possible, under cover of\r\nthe guns of the flotilla. There was no profit or credit in giving up\r\noutworks before they were forced. Major King concurred, and said that\r\nhis battalion, being Gibraltar troops, was under the direct orders of\r\nGeneral Campbell, from whom he had received directions to hold Tarifa\r\ntill the last extremity. If Skerrett’s brigade should embark, he and\r\nthe flank-companies would remain behind, to defend it, along with\r\nCopons’s Spaniards. Gough concurred in the decision, and urged that the\r\nevacuation would be wholly premature and ‘contrary to the spirit of\r\nGeneral Campbell’s instructions’ until it was seen whether the French\r\nwere able to effect a lodgement inside the walls[119].\r\n\r\n  [119] Gough speaks of his reply that ‘evacuation would be\r\n  contrary to the spirit of General Campbell’s instructions,’ as\r\n  if given at an earlier date, but, the 29th seems fixed by King’s\r\n  letter to Napier in appendix to the latter’s _Peninsular War_,\r\n  iv. pp. 443-4, quoted above.\r\n\r\nSkerrett’s resolve was shaken--he still held to his opinion, but\r\ndismissed the council of war without coming to a decision: he tried\r\nto avoid responsibility by requesting the officers who voted for\r\nfurther resistance to deliver him their opinions in writing. This\r\nKing, Smith, and Gough did, in the strongest wording. The first named\r\nof these three resolute men sent that same night a messenger by boat\r\nto Gibraltar, to inform General Campbell of Skerrett’s faint-hearted\r\ndecision, and to observe that, with a few companies more to aid his own\r\nflank-battalion and the Spaniards, he would try to hold first Tarifa\r\nand then the island, even if Skerrett withdrew his brigade. Campbell,\r\nangry in no small degree, sent a very prompt answer to the effect\r\nthat the town should not be abandoned without the concurrence of the\r\ncommanding officers of artillery and engineers, while the Gibraltar\r\nbattalion should be concentrated in the island, in order to ensure its\r\ndefence even if Tarifa itself fell. Still more drastic was an order to\r\nthe officers commanding the transports to bring their ships back at\r\nonce to Gibraltar: this decisive move made it impossible for Skerrett\r\nto carry out his plan[120]. A few days later Campbell sent two more\r\nflank-companies to join the garrison--but they only arrived after the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n  [120] See especially the notes from officers on the spot in\r\n  Napier’s appendix to vol. iv. pp. 442-4.\r\n\r\nThe idea of evacuating the town without attempting any defence was\r\nall the more ignominious because Copons had declared his intention of\r\nholding it to the last, had protested against the spiking of the heavy\r\ngun in Guzman’s tower, and next morning, when Leval summoned the place\r\nto surrender, sent in a most unhesitating, if somewhat bombastic[121],\r\nnote of refusal. If Skerrett had withdrawn into the island, or taken to\r\nhis ships, and Copons had been overwhelmed, fighting in the streets,\r\nthe disgrace to the British flag would have been very great. As a\r\nsidelight on the whole matter, we may remember that this was the same\r\nofficer who had refused to land his troops to defend the breach of\r\nTarragona six months before. He was no coward, as he showed in many\r\nfights, and he died gallantly at Bergen-op-Zoom in 1814, but he was\r\nundoubtedly a shirker of responsibilities.\r\n\r\n  [121] ‘Sin duda ignorará V.S. que me hallo yo en esta plaza,\r\n  cuando se prononce á su gubernador que admite una capitulacion.\r\n  Á la cabeza de mis tropas me encontrará V.S. y entonces\r\n  hableremos.’ See Arteche, appendix to vol. xi. p. 524.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th the besiegers’ batteries opened again,\r\nand enlarged the breach to a broad gap of thirty feet or more; they\r\nalso dismounted a field-piece which the besieged had hoisted on the\r\nJesus tower, to replace those injured on the previous day. At midday\r\nLeval sent in the summons already recorded, and receiving Copons’s\r\nuncompromising reply, directed the fire to continue. It was very\r\neffective, and by evening the breach was nearly sixty feet long,\r\noccupying almost the whole space between the tower at the portcullis\r\nover the ravine, and that next south of it. At dusk the garrison\r\ncrept out to clear the foot of the breach, and began also to redouble\r\nthe inner defences in the lanes and houses behind it. All work on\r\nboth sides, however, was stopped, shortly after nightfall, by a\r\nmost torrential downpour of rain, which drove the French from their\r\nbatteries and the English and Spaniards from their repairing. The sky\r\nseemed to be falling--the hillsides became cataracts, and the Retiro\r\nravine was soon filled with a broad river which came swirling against\r\nthe walls, bearing with it fascines, planks, gabions, and even dead\r\nbodies washed out of the French lines. Presently the mass of débris,\r\naccumulating against the palisades erected in front of the portcullis,\r\nand urged on by the water, swept away these outer defences, and then,\r\npressing against the portcullis itself, bent it inwards and twisted\r\nit, despite of its massive iron clamps, so as to make an opening into\r\nthe town, down which everything went swimming through the ravine. The\r\nflood also swept away some of the defensive works on each side of the\r\ndepression. When the hurricane was over, the rain still continued to\r\nfall heavily, but the garrison, emerging from shelter, commenced to\r\nrepair their works, and had undone much of the damage by daylight[122].\r\n\r\n  [122] For this, see Jones, _Sieges of the Peninsula_, ii. p. 477,\r\n  from which Napier copies his narrative, iv. p. 55.\r\n\r\nIf the besieged had been sorely incommoded by the tempest, the\r\nbesiegers on the bare hillsides had been still worse tried. They had\r\nbeen forced to abandon their trenches and batteries, of which those\r\nhigh up the slope were water-logged, while those below had been largely\r\nswept away by the flood. The breach had been pronounced practicable\r\nby the engineers, and an assault had been fixed for dawn. But it\r\nwas necessary to put it off for some hours, in order to allow the\r\nartillery to reoccupy their batteries, and recommence their fire, and\r\nthe infantry to come up from the camps where they had vainly tried\r\nto shelter themselves during the downpour. Nevertheless the French\r\ncommanders resolved to storm as soon as the men could be assembled,\r\nwithout waiting for further preparations. ‘The troops,’ says the French\r\nhistorian of the siege, ‘unable to dry themselves, or to light fires\r\nto cook their rations, loudly cried out for an assault, as the only\r\nthing that could put an end to their misery.’ A large force had been\r\nset apart for the storm, the grenadier and voltigeur companies of each\r\nof the battalions engaged in the sieges, making a total of over 2,200\r\nmen. They were divided into two columns--the grenadiers were to storm\r\nthe breach; the voltigeurs to try whether the gap at the Portcullis\r\ntower was practicable or not: they were to break in if possible, if\r\nnot, to engage the defenders in a fusilade which should distract their\r\nattention from the main attack.\r\n\r\nAs soon as day dawned, the besieged could detect that the trenches\r\nwere filling, and that the storm was about to break. They had time to\r\ncomplete their dispositions before the French moved: the actual breach\r\nwas held by Copons with a battalion of his own troops[123]: the 87th,\r\nunder Gough, occupied the walls both to right and left of the breach,\r\nincluding the Portcullis tower, with two companies in reserve. Captain\r\nLevesey with 100 of the 47th was posted in the south-eastern (Jesus)\r\ntower, which completely enfiladed the route which the enemy would have\r\nto take to the foot of the breach. The rest of the 47th was in charge\r\nof the south front of the town.\r\n\r\n  [123] Their part in the defence must not be denied to the\r\n  Spaniards. Napier, with his usual prejudice, remarks (iv. p. 60)\r\n  that Skerrett ‘assigned the charge of the breach entirely to the\r\n  Spaniards, and if Smith had not insisted upon placing British\r\n  troops alongside of them this would have ruined the defence,\r\n  because hunger and neglect had so broken the spirit of these\r\n  poor men that few appeared during the combat, and Copons alone\r\n  displayed the qualities of a gallant soldier.’\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock the column of French grenadiers issued from the\r\ntrenches near the advanced breaching battery, and dashed down the side\r\nof the Retiro ravine towards the breach, while the voltigeur companies,\r\nat the same time, running out from the approaches on the eastern hill,\r\nadvanced by the opposite side of the ravine towards the Portcullis\r\ntower. Demonstrations to right and left were made by Cassagne’s brigade\r\non one flank and Pécheux’s on the other. The progress of the storming\r\ncolumn was not rapid--the slopes of the ravine were rain-sodden and\r\nslippery; its bottom (where the flood had passed) was two feet deep\r\nin mud. The troops were forced to move slowly, and the moment that\r\nthey were visible from the walls they became exposed to a very heavy\r\nfire of musketry, both from the curtain and the enfilading towers on\r\neach of their flanks. Of guns the besieged had only one available--a\r\nfield-piece in the northernmost (or Corchuela) tower, which fired\r\ncase-shot diagonally along the foot of the walls.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the French grenadiers pushed forward across the open space\r\ntowards the breach, under a rain of bullets from the 87th which smote\r\nthem on both flanks. The Fusiliers were firing fast and accurately,\r\nto the tune of _Garry Owen_, which the regimental band was playing by\r\norder of Gough just behind the breach, accompanied by bursts of shouts\r\nand cheering. On arriving at the foot of the walls, in great disorder,\r\nthe French column hesitated for a moment; many men began to fire\r\ninstead of pressing on, but some bold spirits scaled the rough slope of\r\nthe breach and reached its lip--only to get a momentary glimpse of the\r\nfourteen-foot drop behind it, and to fall dead. The bulk of the column\r\nthen swerved away to its right, and fell upon the palisades and other\r\ndefences in front of the Portcullis tower, where the hasty repairs\r\nmade after the flood of the preceding night did not look effective.\r\nApparently many of the voltigeurs who had been already engaged in this\r\nquarter joined in their assault, which surged over the outer barricades\r\nand penetrated as far as the portcullis itself. It was found too well\r\nrepaired to be broken down, and the stormers, crowded in front of it,\r\nand caught in an angle between the front wall defended by the 87th, and\r\nthe flanking Jesus tower from which the 47th were firing, found the\r\ncorner too hot for them, and suddenly recoiled and fled. The officer\r\nat the head of the forlorn hope gave up his sword to Gough through the\r\nbars of the portcullis, which alone separated them, and many other\r\nmen at the front of the column also surrendered, rather than face the\r\npoint-blank fire at close range which would have accompanied the first\r\nstage of their retreat.\r\n\r\nThis was a striking instance of an assault on a very broad breach, by\r\na strong force, being beaten off by musketry fire alone. The French\r\nseem never to have had a chance in face of the steady resistance of\r\nthe 87th and their comrades. Their loss is given by the official\r\nFrench historian at only 48 killed and 159 wounded, which seems an\r\nincredibly low figure when over 2,000 men were at close quarters with\r\nthe besieged, in a very disadvantageous position, for some time[124].\r\nThe British lost 2 officers and 7 men killed, 3 officers, 2 sergeants,\r\nand 22 men wounded: the Spaniards had a lieutenant-colonel killed and\r\nabout 20 men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n  [124] Skerrett and Copons estimated the loss of the enemy at\r\n  nearly 500, no doubt an exaggeration. But Leval’s 207 seems far\r\n  too few. The commanding officer of the 51st Ligne reports from\r\n  his four flank-companies 7 officers and 81 men hit (Belmas, iv,\r\n  Appendix, p. 58). Of the sapper detachment which led the column,\r\n  from 50 men 43 were _hors de combat_ (Belmas, iv. p. 31). It\r\n  seems incredible that when 23 companies took part in the assault\r\n  5 of them should have suffered 131 casualties out of a total of\r\n  207. Martinien’s tables show 18 officers killed and wounded on\r\n  Dec. 31, a figure which proves nothing, for though at the usual\r\n  casualty rate of 20 men per officer this would imply a total loss\r\n  of 360, yet it is well known that in assaults the officers often\r\n  suffer a loss out of all proportion to that of the rank and file.\r\n  Eighteen officers hit might be compatible with a loss as low as\r\n  200 or as high as 400 in such a case.\r\n\r\nThe assault having failed so disastrously, the spirits of the\r\nbesiegers sank to a very low pitch. The rain continued to fall during\r\nthe whole day and the following night, and the already water-logged\r\ntrenches became quite untenable. On New Year’s Day, 1812, the dawn\r\nshowed a miserable state of affairs--not only were the roads to the\r\nrear, towards Fascinas and Vejer, entirely blocked by the swelling\r\nof mountain torrents, but communications were cut even between the\r\nsiege-camps. All the provision of powder in the siege-batteries was\r\nfound to be spoilt by wet, and a great part of the cartridges of the\r\ninfantry. Nearly a third of the horses of the train had perished from\r\ncold combined with low feeding. No rations were issued to the troops\r\nthat day, and on the three preceding days only incomplete ones had been\r\ngiven, because of the impossibility of getting them up from the reserve\r\ndépôt, and many of the men wandered without leave for three miles to\r\nthe rear in search of food or shelter. An exploring party of the 47th\r\npushing out into the trenches found them quite unguarded[125] and full\r\nof water. Leval wrote a formal proposal for the abandonment of the\r\nsiege to his chief, Victor, saying that the only choice was to save\r\nthe army by retreat, or to see it perish in a few days if it remained\r\nstationary[126]. The Marshal, however, refused to turn back from an\r\nenterprise in which he considered his honour involved, and the tempest\r\nhaving abated on the night of Jan. 2nd-3rd, ordered the batteries and\r\napproaches to be remanned, and directed that an attempt should be made\r\nto sap forward toward the Jesus tower from the left advanced trenches.\r\nThe work done was feeble--the batteries had fired only fifty shots by\r\nevening, and the repairs to the damaged works were very incomplete.\r\n\r\n  [125] _Defence of Tarifa_, p. 47.\r\n\r\n  [126] See the letter in Belmas, iv. pp. 55-6.\r\n\r\nEven Victor’s obstinacy yielded, however, when on the night of the\r\n3rd-4th January another furious storm arose, and once more stopped all\r\npossibility of continuing operations. No food had now come up from the\r\nbase for many days, and the stores at the front being exhausted, the\r\nMarshal saw that it was necessary to march at once. An attempt was\r\nmade to withdraw the guns from the batteries, but only one 12-pounder\r\nand two howitzers were got off--the horses were so weak and the\r\nground so sodden that even when 200 infantry were set to help, most of\r\nthe pieces could not be dragged more than a few yards. Wherefore the\r\nattempt was given over, the powder in the batteries was thrown open to\r\nthe rain, the balls rolled into the Retiro ravine, the nine remaining\r\nheavy guns spiked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TARIFA]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 4th-5th the army crawled off on the road to Vejer,\r\nabandoning nearly all its material in its camps. An attempt was made\r\nto fire a mass of abandoned vehicles, but the rain stopped it. Next\r\nmorning the French were passing the defile of Torre Peña, under the\r\nnot very effective fire of an English frigate, which kept as close\r\nto the shore as was possible on a very rough day. The four guns from\r\nthe battery at this point were brought on, with much toil, and no\r\nwounded were abandoned. On the 6th the column reached Tayvilla, where\r\nit found a convoy and 100 horses, which were of inestimable value, for\r\nthose with the field-force were completely spent. Nevertheless the one\r\n12-pounder brought off from Tarifa was abandoned in the mud. On the\r\n7th Vejer was reached, and the expedition was at an end. The troops of\r\nVictor’s division, after a short rest, went back to the Cadiz Lines,\r\nthose of Leval’s division marched for Xeres.\r\n\r\nThus ended the leaguer of Tarifa, which cost the besiegers about 500\r\nlives, more by sickness than by casualties in the trenches. There\r\nwere also some deserters--fifteen Poles came over in a body and\r\nsurrendered to Captain Carroll on the 3rd[127], and other individuals\r\nstole in from time to time. But the main loss to the French, beyond\r\nthat of prestige, was that the battalions which had formed part of the\r\nexpeditionary force were so tired out and war-worn, that for several\r\nweeks they continued to fill the hospitals in the Lines with sick, and\r\nwere incapable of further active service. Wherefore Soult could not\r\nsend any appreciable detachment to help Suchet on the side of Valencia:\r\nthe cavalry brigade, which sacked Murcia on January 26 and killed La\r\nCarrera,[128] was his only contribution to the operations on the east\r\nside of Spain. The field-force which might otherwise have accompanied\r\nPierre Soult’s cavalry raid had been used up in the Tarifa expedition.\r\n\r\n  [127] _Defence of Tarifa_, p. 75.\r\n\r\n  [128] See page 8 above.\r\n\r\nAnother distraction had come upon Soult while the Tarifa expedition\r\nwas in progress. On December 27, six days after Victor and Leval\r\ncommenced the siege, General Hill had once more begun to move on the\r\nEstremaduran side, after remaining quiescent for nearly two months\r\nsince the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos. His advance was a diversion\r\nmade by Wellington’s direct orders, with the purpose of drawing Soult’s\r\nattention away from the pursuit of Ballasteros and the molesting\r\nof Tarifa[129]. It failed to achieve the latter purpose, since the\r\noperations of Victor had gone so far, before Hill moved, that the\r\nMarshal stood committed to the siege, and indeed only heard that Hill\r\nwas on the move after the assault of December 31st had been made and\r\nbeaten off. But it caused Soult to cut off all support from Victor,\r\nto turn his small remaining reserves in the direction of Estremadura,\r\nand to welcome as a relief, rather than to deplore as a disaster, the\r\nreturn of the defeated expeditionary force to the Lines of Cadiz on\r\nJanuary 7th. For about that date Hill was pushing Drouet before him,\r\nand the reserves from Seville were moving northwards, so that Soult\r\nwas pleased to learn that the 10,000 men from Tarifa had returned, and\r\nthat, in consequence of their reappearance, he could draw off more\r\nmen from the direction of Cadiz to replace the troops moved toward\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\n  [129] See Wellington to Hill, Dec. 18th, _Dispatches_, ix. pp.\r\n  465-6.\r\n\r\nHill crossed the Portuguese frontier north of the Guadiana on December\r\n27th, with his own division, Hamilton’s Portuguese, two British cavalry\r\nbrigades (those of Long and de Grey[130]) and one of Portuguese (4th\r\nand 10th regiments under J. Campbell of the former corps), or about\r\n12,000 men. The small remainder of his force[131] was left about Elvas,\r\nto watch any possible movement of the French from the direction of\r\nBadajoz. His objective was Merida, where it was known that Dombrouski,\r\nwith the greater part of the 5th French Division, was lying, in a\r\nposition far advanced from the main body of Drouet’s troops, who were\r\ncantoned about Zafra and Llerena. There was some hope of surprising\r\nthis force, and a certainty of driving it in, and of throwing Drouet\r\nand Soult into a state of alarm. Wellington directed Hill to keep\r\nto the desolate road north of the Guadiana, because a winter raid\r\nfrom this direction would be the last thing expected by the enemy. He\r\nbade his lieutenant keep a wary eye in the direction of Truxillo and\r\nAlmaraz, from which the divisions of Marmont’s army then in New Castile\r\nmight possibly descend upon his rear. But the warning turned out to\r\nbe superfluous, since, before Hill moved, Marmont had been forced by\r\nthe Emperor’s orders to detach his troops on the Tagus for the ruinous\r\nexpedition under Montbrun to Alicante.\r\n\r\n  [130] But the last-named officer was absent.\r\n\r\n  [131] One Portuguese infantry and one Portuguese cavalry brigade.\r\n\r\nMarching very rapidly Hill reached Albuquerque on the 27th, and La\r\nRocca, only twenty miles from Merida, on the 28th. On the next day[132]\r\nthe prospect of surprising Dombrouski came to an end by the merest of\r\nchances. The French general had sent out that morning a small column\r\nto raise requisitions of food in the villages on this road. A troop\r\nof hussars at its head discovered Hill’s advanced cavalry, near Navas\r\nde Membrillo, and alarmed the infantry, three companies of the 88th\r\nregiment under a Captain Neveux, who formed up and began to retreat\r\nhastily towards Merida. Hill sent two squadrons each of the 13th Light\r\nDragoons and 2nd Hussars of the King’s German Legion in pursuit, with\r\norders to head off and capture, if possible, these 400 men. The result\r\nwas a combat of the same sort as that of Barquilla in 1810, where\r\nit had already been shown that steady infantry could not be ridden\r\ndown by cavalry save under very exceptional circumstances. Neveux,\r\nseeing the dragoons hurrying forward, turned off the road, formed\r\nhis men in square, and made for a cork wood on a rising ground. The\r\ncavalry overtook him, and delivered five determined charges, which\r\nwere all beaten off with heavy loss. We are told that their order and\r\nimpetus were both broken by scattered trees outside the wood, but the\r\nmain cause of their defeat was the impossibility of breaking into a\r\nsolidly-formed square of determined men, well commanded[133]. After the\r\nfinal charge the squadrons drew off, and Neveux hastened on through\r\nthe wood, fell back again into the road, and reached Merida, though he\r\nlost a few men[134] by shells from Hawker’s battery, which came up late\r\nin the day. The K.G.L. Hussars had 2 men killed and 1 officer and 17\r\nmen wounded: the 13th Light Dragoons 1 killed and 19 wounded.\r\n\r\n  [132] Napier (iv. 49) wrongly puts the combat of Navas de\r\n  Membrillo on the 28th of December, not the 29th. The diaries\r\n  of Stoltzenberg of the 2nd K.G.L. Hussars and Cadell of the\r\n  28th prove that the second date is correct. No force could have\r\n  marched from Albuquerque to Navas in one day.\r\n\r\n  [133] Hill’s dispatch has a handsome but ungrammatical testimony\r\n  to the enemy: ‘the intrepid and admirable way in which the French\r\n  retreated, the infantry formed in square, and favoured as he was\r\n  by the nature of the country, of which he knew how to take the\r\n  fullest advantage, prevented the cavalry alone from effecting\r\n  anything against him.’\r\n\r\n  [134] Apparently two killed and nine wounded.\r\n\r\nDombrouski, warned of the approach of the allies in force, immediately\r\nevacuated Merida, where Hill made prize of 160,000 lb. of wheat,\r\nunground, and a large magazine of biscuit. He found that the French had\r\nbeen fortifying the town, but the works were too unfinished to allow\r\nthem to defend it. On January 1st Hill, continuing his advance, marched\r\nacross the bridge of Merida on Almendralejo, thinking that Drouet might\r\npossibly have come up to help Dombrouski, and that he might force him\r\nto fight. This was not to be: the rearguard of the force from Merida\r\nwas discovered drawn up in front of Almendralejo, but gave way at the\r\nfirst push: a small magazine of food was captured in the town.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that Drouet did not intend to make a stand, but would\r\nfall back towards the Andalusian frontier, and wait for aid from Soult.\r\nHill resolved to move his main body no further, but sent out a small\r\nflying column under Major-General Abercrombie, with orders to press\r\nthe French rearguard as long as it would give way, but to halt and\r\nturn back on finding serious forces in front of him. This detachment\r\n(1/50th regiment, two squadrons 2nd Hussars K.G.L., two squadrons\r\n10th Portuguese, three guns) passing Fuente del Maestre neared Los\r\nSantos on January 3rd, and found Dombrouski, with a rearguard of all\r\narms, disposed to fight. This led to a sharp cavalry combat, between\r\ntwo squadrons of the 26th French Dragoons and the allied horse. One\r\nsquadron of the hussars and one of the Portuguese, gallantly led by\r\nColonel Campbell, charged the enemy in front, the other squadrons\r\nremaining in reserve. The dragoons, soon broken, lost 6 killed, many\r\nwounded, and 2 officers and 35 men prisoners. Thereupon the French\r\ninfantry moved rapidly off southwards, making no attempt to stand. The\r\nvictors lost 1 man killed and 14 wounded from the hussars, 1 officer\r\nand 5 men from the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nDrouet was now concentrating at Llerena, and ready to give up all\r\nEstremadura north of that point. He was sending daily appeals for\r\nsuccour to Soult, who had little to give him, while Victor and the\r\nexpeditionary force were away at Tarifa. On January 5th the Duke of\r\nDalmatia wrote a dispatch which ordered that the siege should be\r\nabandoned--but long ere it came to hand Victor had been forced to\r\ndepart, as we have seen, for reasons entirely unconnected with Hill’s\r\nmidwinter raid. Wellington’s plan would have worked if the weather had\r\nnot already driven Victor away, but had in actual fact no effect on his\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nHill, having accomplished all that could be done in the way of alarming\r\nSoult, held Merida and Almendralejo for a few days, with his advanced\r\ncavalry about Fuente del Maestre: but retired on January 13th to\r\nAlbuquerque and Portalegre, to the intense relief of his enemy. The\r\nraising of the siege of Tarifa being known, there was no further reason\r\nfor keeping Hill in an advanced position, which might have tempted\r\nSoult to make a great concentration and take the offensive. Wellington\r\nhad no desire that he should do so, since the Army of Andalusia, while\r\ndispersed, was harmless, but might become dangerous if it should\r\nevacuate great regions, and so be able to collect in force. Soult did\r\nnot wish to make such sacrifices unless he were obliged, and on hearing\r\nof Hill’s retreat countermanded all orders for concentration, and\r\ncontented himself with bringing back Drouet to Llerena and Zalamea, and\r\nwith reopening his communication with Badajoz, which had been cut while\r\nthe allies were at Fuente del Maestre. He did not at this time reoccupy\r\nMerida, partly because the position had been demonstrated to be\r\ndangerous by Hill’s recent raid, partly because its main importance was\r\nthat it covered the road to Truxillo and Almaraz and Marmont’s army.\r\nBut Marmont having, for the moment, no troops in this direction, owing\r\nto the Alicante expedition, it was useless to try to keep in touch with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHill’s expedition, by driving Drouet for some time from the line of\r\nthe Guadiana, made possible a sudden irruption of the Spaniards into La\r\nMancha, where none of their regular troops had been since the battle\r\nof Ocaña two years before. This raid was carried out by Morillo at the\r\nhead of a brigade of the Estremaduran army of Castaños. That general\r\nhad heard of the way in which the upper valley of the Guadiana had\r\nbeen denuded of troops, in order that the Army of the Centre might\r\nassist Suchet in the direction of Cuenca and Requeña[135]. Nothing\r\nwas left in La Mancha save a few battalions of King Joseph’s German\r\nDivision, and a brigade of Treillard’s dragoons, a force which could\r\nonly provide garrisons for a few large towns and watch the high-road\r\nfrom Madrid to Andalusia. Morillo was directed to slip eastward through\r\nthe gap made by Hill between the Armies of the South and Portugal,\r\nto endeavour to cut up the French posts, and to collect recruits and\r\ncontributions in the country-side. With luck he might even break the\r\nline of communication between Soult and Madrid. His force of 3,000 men\r\nwas insufficient for anything more than a raid.\r\n\r\n  [135] See page 56 above.\r\n\r\nStarting from Montanches near Caçeres on December 30th--three days\r\nafter Hill’s expedition had begun--Morillo crossed the Guadiana, and\r\nafter making a fruitless dash at Belalcazar, the isolated French\r\ngarrison which protected the northernmost corner of Andalusia, marched\r\nstraight on by Agudo and Sarceruela into the heart of La Mancha, where\r\nhe seized Ciudad Real, its capital [January 15]. The small French force\r\nquartered there fled at his approach, which was wholly unexpected--no\r\nSpanish army had ever marched up the valley of the Guadiana before. On\r\nthe next day Morillo attacked Almagro, where there was a garrison of\r\n500 men; but before he had made any impression he was surprised by the\r\narrival of General Treillard, with a column hastily gathered from the\r\nposts along the high-road. The Spanish general refused to fight, and,\r\nabandoning Ciudad Real, withdrew with little loss into the passes of\r\nthe Sierra de Guadalupe, where his enemy declined to follow. Since Hill\r\nhad by this time abandoned Merida and returned to Portugal, Morillo\r\nfelt his position to be uncomfortably isolated, and feared that French\r\ntroops from Estremadura or from the Tagus valley might intercept his\r\nway homeward. The danger turned out to be imaginary, and on reaching\r\nTruxillo on January 30 the column was able to rest unmolested for a\r\nfortnight at that important strategical point, and then to retire at\r\nleisure to Montanches, its original starting-point.\r\n\r\nThus ended an extraordinary raid, which, though it had no positive\r\nresults whatever, demonstrated two things clearly enough--one was\r\nthe marching power of the Spanish infantry, which between December\r\n28 and January 30 covered 250 miles of vile mountain roads in bitter\r\nweather, and came back intact with little loss[136], the other was the\r\nslightness of the French hold on La Mancha, where the appearance of a\r\nsmall brigade of 3,000 men upset the whole country-side. Morillo was\r\nonly driven off by a concentration of many small garrisons, and, when\r\nthey were withdrawn, the local guerrillero bands overran the land.\r\nTheir chiefs, El Medico [Palarea], Chaleco, and others, did an immense\r\namount of damage while the French were concentrated, and ravaged up\r\nto the very gates of Madrid. Chaos reigned in New Castile till Foy’s\r\nand Sarrut’s divisions came back from the Alicante expedition, and\r\ndispersed themselves along the valley of the Tagus at the beginning of\r\nFebruary. For, as we have often had occasion to remark before, every\r\nprovince of Spain required not only to be conquered but to be held\r\ndown by a permanent garrison. The moment that it was left too lightly\r\nheld, the guerrilleros came down from the hills, occupied all the open\r\ncountry, and cut all communications.\r\n\r\n  [136] Napier (iv. p. 50) overrates the damage that Morillo\r\n  suffered. He was not ‘completely defeated’ by Treillard, because\r\n  he absconded without fighting. In his elaborate dispatch he gives\r\n  his whole loss as two killed and nine wounded. See his life by\r\n  Rodriguez Villa, appendices to vol. ii, for an almost daily\r\n  series of letters describing his march.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AT CADIZ AND ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe military operations in the South during the winter of 1811-12\r\nwere inconclusive, and only important in a negative way, as showing\r\nthat the initiative of the French armies was spent in this direction.\r\nBut it must not be forgotten that while Soult had been brought to\r\na standstill, Suchet’s operations were still progressing: January,\r\nindeed, saw the last great Spanish disaster of the war, the fall of\r\nValencia, so that the spirits of government and people still ran very\r\nlow. It was not till the sudden irruption of Wellington into the\r\nkingdom of Leon had ended in the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo (January\r\n19), that there was any great occasion for hopefulness. And for a long\r\ntime after that event its importance was not fully understood. That\r\nthe central turning-point of the war had come, that for the future the\r\nallies were to be on the offensive, and the French on the defensive,\r\nwas not realized till Badajoz had fallen in April, a blow which shook\r\nthe whole fabric of King Joseph’s power throughout the regions where he\r\nseemed to reign. Nor was it only the state of affairs in the Peninsula\r\nwhich, during the winter of 1811-12, seemed sufficiently gloomy\r\nboth for the present and for the future. The news from the Spanish\r\ncolonies in America grew steadily worse: in most of the viceroyalties\r\nof the Western world there was now a nucleus of trouble: the name of\r\nFerdinand VII was still used by the insurgents as a rallying cry,\r\nexcept in Venezuela, where Miranda had proclaimed an independent\r\nrepublic in July 1811. But in La Plata and Chili lip-loyalty to the\r\nsovereign was accompanied by practical secession from the Spanish\r\nstate: the _Cabildos_ or Juntas paid no attention to orders received\r\nfrom Cadiz. In Mexico, though the capital and the greater part of the\r\ncountry were still in the hands of the constituted authorities, there\r\nwas a lively insurrection on foot since September 1810, under the\r\npriest Hidalgo--he was captured and executed in 1812, but his death\r\ndid not crush his faction. The Viceroyalty of Peru was almost the\r\nonly part of Spanish America which still remained loyal. The Cortes\r\nat Cadiz made elaborate attempts to conciliate the Americans, but was\r\nunable to satisfy their expectations or to end their discontents. The\r\ndeeply-rooted belief of the Creoles that they and their country were\r\nstill being exploited for the benefit of Spain, could not be removed\r\nby any declaration that they were now to be Spanish citizens with full\r\nrights, or by giving them representation in the Cortes. The idea of\r\nautonomy was already abroad in Spanish America, and in every quarter\r\nambitious men were quoting the precedent of the revolt of the Thirteen\r\nUnited Colonies from Great Britain in the previous generation. Truly\r\nSpain had committed an unwise act when she joined France in wrecking\r\nthe British domination in North America. She revenged an old grudge\r\nsuccessfully, but she taught her own colonists a lesson impossible to\r\nforget and easy to copy.\r\n\r\nThe Peninsular War had hitherto been maintained in no small degree by\r\nthe money which kept flowing in from America: what would happen if\r\nthe treasure-ships with their regular supply of silver dollars from\r\nthe mines of Mexico and Peru ceased altogether to come in? Already\r\naffairs were looking so threatening that, despite of all the needs of\r\nthe campaign at home, reinforcements were being sent out to the New\r\nWorld from Cadiz and from Corunna: the Army of Galicia, as we shall\r\npresently see, was nearly put out of action in the spring of 1812 by\r\nthe dispatch of an over-great proportion of its trained artillerymen to\r\nAmerica[137]. Some French observers of the situation formed the idea\r\nthat the Spaniards, if pressed to a decision between the possible loss\r\nof their colonies and the chance of obtaining a free hand by peace with\r\nNapoleon, might make the choice for empire rather than freedom. By\r\nacknowledging Joseph Bonaparte as king, and coming into the Napoleonic\r\nsystem, they might be able to turn their whole strength against the\r\ndiscontented Americans. This idea had one fatal error: any Spaniard\r\ncould see that submission to France meant war with Great Britain:\r\nand then the way across the Atlantic would be closed. The British\r\ngovernment would be forced into an alliance with the colonists; it\r\nhad already thought of this device in the old days before Napoleon’s\r\ninvasion of the Peninsula. Whitelock’s unhappy Buenos Ayres expedition\r\nin 1807 had been sent out precisely to take advantage of the discontent\r\nof the Americans, and in the hope that they would rise against the\r\nmother country if promised assistance. The adventurer Miranda had\r\nspent much time in pressing this policy on the Portland cabinet.\r\nWhitelock’s descent on the Rio de la Plata, it is true, had been as\r\ndisappointing in the political as in the military line: he had got no\r\nhelp whatever from the disaffected colonists. But feeling in America\r\nhad developed into much greater bitterness since 1807: in 1812 actual\r\ninsurrection had already broken out. British aid would not, this time,\r\nbe rejected: the malcontents would buy it by the grant of liberal\r\ntrading concessions, which the Cadiz government, even in its worst time\r\nof trouble, had steadily refused to grant. There was every chance,\r\ntherefore, that a policy of submission to Napoleon would ensure the\r\nloss of America even more certainly and more rapidly than a persistence\r\nin the present war. It does not seem that any person of importance at\r\nCadiz ever took into serious consideration the idea of throwing up\r\nthe struggle for independence, in order to obtain the opportunity of\r\ndealing with the American question.\r\n\r\n  [137] See below, section xxxiii, page 337.\r\n\r\nThe idea, however, was in the air. This was the time at which King\r\nJoseph made his last attempt to open up secret negotiation with\r\nthe patriots. His own condition was unhappy enough, as has been\r\nsufficiently shown in an earlier chapter: but he was well aware that\r\nthe outlook of his enemies was no less gloomy. One of the numerous--and\r\nusually impracticable--pieces of advice which his brother had sent him\r\nwas the suggestion that he should assemble some sort of a Cortes, and\r\nthen, posing as a national king, try to open up communications with\r\nthe Cadiz government, setting forth the somewhat unconvincing thesis\r\nthat Great Britain, and not France, was the real enemy of Spanish\r\ngreatness. The idea of calling a Cortes fell through: the individuals\r\nwhom Joseph could have induced to sit in it would have been so few,\r\nso insignificant, and so unpopular, that such a body could only have\r\nprovoked contempt[138]. But an attempt was made to see if anything\r\ncould be done at Cadiz: the inducement which Joseph was authorized to\r\noffer to the patriots was that immediately on his recognition as a\r\nconstitutional king by the Cortes--and a constitution was to be drawn\r\nup in haste at Madrid--the French army should retire from Spain, and\r\nthe integrity of the realm should be guaranteed. Napoleon even made a\r\nhalf-promise to give up Catalonia, though he had practically annexed it\r\nto his empire in the previous year[139].\r\n\r\n  [138] For all this scheme see the Memoirs of Miot de Melito, iii.\r\n  pp. 215-16, beside the Emperor’s own dispatches. Note especially\r\n  the instructions which the French ambassador, Laforest, was to\r\n  set before Joseph.\r\n\r\n  [139] See vol. iv. p. 215.\r\n\r\nJoseph and his ministers had no confidence either in the Emperor’s\r\nsincerity in making these offers, or in the likelihood of their\r\nfinding any acceptance among the patriots. He sent, however, to Cadiz\r\nas his agent a certain Canon La Peña, a secret _Afrancesado_, but a\r\nbrother of Manuel La Peña, the incapable general who had betrayed\r\nGraham at Barrosa. This officer was on his trial at the moment for his\r\nmisbehaviour on that occasion, and the canon pretended to have come\r\nto assist him in his day of trouble on grounds of family affection.\r\nIt would seem that he sounded certain persons but with small effect.\r\nToreno, who was present in Cadiz at the time, and well acquainted\r\nwith every intrigue that was in progress, says that the Regency never\r\nheard of the matter, and that very few members of the Cortes knew what\r\nLa Peña was doing. It seems that he had conversations with certain\r\nfreemasons, who were connected with lodges in Madrid that were under\r\nFrench influence, and apparently with one member of the ministry. ‘I do\r\nnot give his name,’ says the historian, ‘because I have no documentary\r\nproof to bear out the charge, but moral proof I have[140].’ Be this as\r\nit may, the labours of La Peña do not seem to have been very fruitful,\r\nand the assertion made by certain French historians, and by Napoleon\r\nhimself in the _Mémorial de Ste-Hélène_, that the Cortes would have\r\nproceeded to treat with Joseph, but for Wellington’s astonishing\r\nsuccesses in the spring of 1812, has little or no foundation. As Toreno\r\ntruly observes, any open proposal of the sort would have resulted\r\nin the tearing to pieces by the populace of the man hardy enough to\r\nmake it. The intrigue had no more success than the earlier mission\r\nof Sotelo, which has been spoken of in another place[141]. But it\r\nlingered on, till the battle of Salamanca in July, and the flight of\r\nJoseph from Madrid in August, proved, to any doubters that there may\r\nhave been, that the French cause was on the wane[142]. One of the most\r\ncurious results of this secret negotiation was that Soult, hearing that\r\nthe King’s emissary was busy at Cadiz, and not knowing that it was at\r\nNapoleon’s own suggestion that the experiment was being made, came to\r\nthe conclusion that Joseph was plotting to abandon his brother, and to\r\nmake a private peace with the Cortes, on condition that he should break\r\nwith France and be recognized as king. He wrote, as we shall presently\r\nsee, to denounce him to Napoleon as a traitor. Hence came no small\r\nfriction in the following autumn.\r\n\r\n  [140] Toreno, iii. p. 100.\r\n\r\n  [141] See vol. ii. p. 168.\r\n\r\n  [142] Toreno says that the mistress of the Duke of Infantado was\r\n  implicated in the negotiation, after he had become a regent, but\r\n  that he himself had no treasonable intentions, being a staunch\r\n  supporter of Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nThese secret intrigues fell into a time of keen political strife at\r\nCadiz--the famous Constitution, which was to cause so much bickering\r\nin later years, was being drafted, discussed, and passed through the\r\nCortes in sections, all through the autumn of 1811 and the winter of\r\n1811-12. The Liberals and the Serviles fought bitterly over almost\r\nevery clause, and during their disputes the anti-national propaganda of\r\nthe handful of _Afrancesados_ passed almost unnoticed. It is impossible\r\nin a purely military history to relate the whole struggle, and a few\r\nwords as to its political bearings must suffice.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was a strange amalgam of ancient Spanish national\r\ntradition, of half-understood loans from Great Britain and America,\r\nand of political theory borrowed from France. Many of its framers\r\nhad obviously studied the details of the abortive ‘limited monarchy’\r\nwhich had been imposed on Louis XVI in the early days of the French\r\nRevolution. From this source came the scheme which limited within\r\nnarrow bounds the sovereign’s power in the Constitution. The system\r\nevolved was that of a king whose main constitutional weapon was that\r\nright of veto on legislation which had proved so unpopular in France.\r\nHe was to choose ministers who, like those of the United States of\r\nAmerica, were not to sit in parliament, nor to be necessarily dependent\r\non a party majority in the house, though they were to be responsible\r\nto it. There was to be but one Chamber, elected not directly by the\r\npeople--though universal suffrage was introduced--but by notables\r\nchosen by the parishes in local primary assemblies, who again named\r\ndistrict notables, these last nominating the actual members for the\r\nCortes.\r\n\r\nThe right of taxation was vested in the Chamber, and the Ministry was\r\nplaced at its mercy by the power of refusing supply. The regular army\r\nwas specially subjected to the Chamber and not to the King, though the\r\nlatter was left some power with regard to calling out or disbanding\r\nthe local militia which was to form the second line in the national\r\nforces--at present it was in fact non-existent, unless the guerrillero\r\nbands might be considered to represent it.\r\n\r\nThe most cruel blows were struck not only at the King’s power but at\r\nhis prestige. A clause stating that all treaties or grants made by him\r\nwhile in captivity were null and void was no doubt necessary--there\r\nwas no knowing what documents Napoleon might not dictate to Ferdinand.\r\nBut it was unwise to formulate in a trenchant epigram that ‘the nation\r\nis free and independent, not the patrimony of any family or person,’\r\nor that ‘the people’s obligation of obedience ceases when the King\r\nviolates the laws.’ And when, after granting their sovereign a veto on\r\nlegislation, the Constitution proceeded to state that the veto became\r\ninoperative after the Cortes had passed any act in three successive\r\nsessions, it became evident that the King’s sole weapon was to be made\r\nineffective. ‘Sovereignty,’ it was stated, ‘is vested essentially in\r\nthe nation, and for this reason the nation alone has the right to\r\nestablish its fundamental laws.’ But the most extraordinary attack on\r\nthe principle of legitimate monarchy was a highhanded resettlement\r\nof the succession to the throne, in which the regular sequence of\r\nnext heirs was absolutely ignored. If King Ferdinand failed to leave\r\nissue, the crown was to go to his brother Don Carlos: if that prince\r\nalso died childless, the Constitution declared that the infante Don\r\nFrancisco and his sister the Queen of Etruria were both to be passed\r\nover. No definite reasons were given in the act of settlement for\r\nthis astonishing departure from the natural line of descent. The real\r\nmeaning of the clause concerning Don Francisco was that many suspected\r\nhim of being the son of Godoy and not of Charles IV[143]. As to the\r\nQueen of Etruria, she had been in her younger days a docile tool of\r\nNapoleon, and had lent herself very tamely to his schemes. But it is\r\nsaid that the governing cause of her exclusion from the succession\r\nwas not so much her own unpopularity, as the incessant intrigues of\r\nher sister Carlotta, the wife of the regent João of Portugal, who had\r\nfor a long time been engaged in putting forward a claim to be elected\r\nas sole regent of Spain. She had many members of the Cortes in her\r\npay, and their influence was directed to getting her name inserted in\r\nthe list above that of her brother in the succession-roll, and to the\r\ndisinheritance of her sister also. Her chance of ever reaching the\r\nthrone was not a very good one, as both Ferdinand and Carlos were still\r\nyoung, and could hardly be kept prisoners at Valençay for ever. It is\r\nprobable that the real object of the manœvres was rather to place her\r\nnearer to the regency of Spain in the present crisis, than to seat her\r\nupon its throne at some remote date. For the regency was her desire,\r\nthough the crown too would have been welcome, and sometimes not only\r\nthe anti-Portuguese party in the Cortes, but Wellington and his brother\r\nHenry Wellesley, the Ambassador at Cadiz, were afraid that by patience\r\nand by long intrigue her partisans might achieve their object.\r\n\r\n  [143] See Villa Urrutia, i. p. 13 and ii. pp. 355-9.\r\n\r\nWellington was strongly of opinion that a royal regent at Cadiz\r\nwould be most undesirable. The personal influences of a _camarilla_,\r\nsurrounding an ambitious but incapable female regent, would add another\r\ndifficulty to the numerous problems of the relations between England\r\nand Spain, which were already sufficiently tiresome.\r\n\r\nThis deliberate humiliation of the monarchy, by clauses accentuated\r\nby phrases of insult, which angered, and were intended to anger, the\r\n_Serviles_, was only accomplished after long debate, in which protests\r\nof the most vigorous sort were made by many partisans of the old\r\ntheory of Spanish absolutism. Some spoke in praise of the Salic Law,\r\nviolated by the mention of Carlotta as heiress to the throne, others\r\n(ignoring rumours as to his paternity) defended Don Francisco, as\r\nhaving been by his youth exempted from the ignominies of Bayonne, and\r\ndwelt on the injustice of his fate. But the vote went against them by a\r\nmost conclusive figure.\r\n\r\nThe majority in the Cortes, which made such parade of its political\r\nliberalism, did not pursue its theories into the realm of religion.\r\nAfter reading its fulsome declarations in favour of freedom, it is\r\nastounding to note the black intolerance of the clause which declares\r\nnot only, as might naturally be expected, that ‘the religion of the\r\nSpanish nation is, and ever shall be, the Catholic Apostolic Roman,\r\nthe one true faith,’ but that ‘the nation defends it by wise laws,\r\n_forbidding the exercise of any other_.’ Schism and unorthodoxy still\r\nremained political as well as ecclesiastical crimes, no less than\r\nin the time of Philip II. The Liberals, despite of murmurs by the\r\n_Serviles_, refused to recreate the Inquisition, but this was as far as\r\ntheir conception of religious freedom went.\r\n\r\nContemplating this exhibition of mediaeval intolerance, it is\r\nimpossible to rate at any very high figure the ostentatious liberalism\r\nwhich pervades the greater part of the Constitution. We are bound to\r\nrecognize in it merely the work of a party of ambitious politicians,\r\nwho desired to secure control of the state-machine for themselves,\r\nand to exclude the monarchy from all share in its manipulation. No\r\ndoubt any form of limited government was better than the old royal\r\nbureaucracy. But this particular scheme went much farther than the\r\nneeds or the possibilities of the time, and was most unsuited for\r\na country such as the Spain of 1812. When its meaning began to be\r\nunderstood in the provinces, it commanded no enthusiasm or respect.\r\nIndeed, outside the Cortes itself the only supporters that it possessed\r\nwere the populace of Cadiz and a few other great maritime towns.\r\nConsidered as a working scheme it had the gravest faults, especially\r\nthe ill-arranged relations between the ministers (who did not form\r\na real cabinet) and the Chamber, in which they were prohibited from\r\nsitting. In 1814 Lord Castlereagh observed, with great truth, that he\r\ncould now say from certain experience, that in practice as well as in\r\ntheory the Constitution of 1812 was one of the worst among the modern\r\nproductions of its kind[144].\r\n\r\n  [144] The best and most recent account of all this, explaining\r\n  many contradictions and some insincere suppression of fact in\r\n  Toreno’s great history, is to be found in chapter ix of vol. ii\r\n  of Señor Villa Urrutia’s _Relaciones entre España y Inglaterra\r\n  1808-14_.\r\n\r\nAmong the many by-products of the Constitution was a change in the\r\nmembership of the Regency. The old ‘trinitarian’ body composed of\r\nBlake, Agar, and Cisgar, had long been discredited, and proposals for\r\nits dissolution had been debated, even before its further continuance\r\nwas rendered impossible by Blake’s surrender to the French at Valencia\r\nin the earliest days of 1812. A furious discussion in the Cortes had\r\nended in a vote that no royal personage should be a member of any\r\nnew regency, so that the pretensions of the Princess of Portugal\r\nwere finally discomfited. The new board consisted of the Duke of\r\nInfantado, Joaquim Mosquera, a member of the Council of the Indies,\r\nAdmiral Villavicencio, military governor of Cadiz, Ignacio Rodriguez de\r\nRivas, and Henry O’Donnell, Conde de la Bispal, the energetic soldier\r\nwhose exploits in Catalonia have been set forth in the last volume of\r\nthis book. He was the only man of mark in the new regency: Infantado\r\nowed his promotion to his rank and wealth, and the fact that he had\r\nbeen the trusted friend of Ferdinand VII. He possessed a limited\r\nintelligence and little education, and was hardly more than a cipher,\r\nwith a distinct preference for ‘Serviles’ rather than for Liberals.\r\nVillavicencio had no military reputation, but had been an energetic\r\norganizer, and a fairly successful governor during the siege of Cadiz.\r\nMosquera and Rivas were elected mainly because they were of American\r\nbirth--their choice was intended to conciliate the discontented\r\ncolonists. Neither of them was entitled by any great personal merit to\r\nthe promotion which was thrust upon him. Henry O’Donnell, now at last\r\nrecovered from the wound which had laid him on a sick bed for so many\r\nmonths in 1811[145], was both capable and energetic, but quarrelsome\r\nand provocative: he belonged to that class of men who always irritate\r\ntheir colleagues into opposition, by their rapid decisions and\r\nimperious ways, especially when those colleagues are men of ability\r\ninferior to their own. The Duke of Infantado was absent for some time\r\nafter his election--he had been serving as ambassador in London. Of\r\nthe other four Regents two ranked as ‘Serviles,’ two as Liberals, a\r\nfact which told against their efficiency as a board. They had little\r\nstrength to stand out against the Cortes, whose jealousy against any\r\npower in the State save its own was intense. On the whole it may be\r\nsaid that the substitution of the five new Regents for the three old\r\nones had no great political consequences. The destiny of the patriot\r\ncause was not in the hands of the executive, but of the turbulent,\r\nfaction-ridden, and ambitious legislative chamber, an ideally\r\nbad instrument for the conduct of a difficult and dangerous war.\r\nFortunately it was neither the Regency nor the Cortes whose actions\r\nwere to settle the fate of the campaign of 1812, but purely and solely\r\nWellington and the Anglo-Portuguese army. The intrigues of Cadiz turned\r\nout to be a negligible quantity in the course of events.\r\n\r\n  [145] See vol. iv. p. 240.\r\n\r\nIn Lisbon at this time matters were much more quiet than they had\r\nbeen a little while back. The Portuguese government had abandoned any\r\novert opposition to Wellington, such as had been seen in 1810, when\r\nthe Patriarch and the President Souza had given him so much trouble.\r\nThe expulsion of Masséna from Portugal had justified the policy of\r\nWellington, and almost silenced his critics. He had not even found it\r\nnecessary to press for the removal of the men whom he distrusted from\r\nthe Council of Regency[146], in which the word of his loyal coadjutor,\r\nCharles Stuart, who combined the rather incompatible functions of\r\nBritish Ambassador and Regent, was now supreme. Open opposition had\r\nceased, but Wellington complained that while compliance was always\r\npromised, ‘every measure which I propose is frittered away to nothing,\r\nthe form and the words remain, but the spirit of the measure is taken\r\naway in the execution[147].’ This was, he remarked, the policy of the\r\nPortuguese government: they no longer refused him anything; but if\r\nthey thought that any of his demands might offend either the Prince\r\nRegent at Rio Janeiro or the popular sentiment of the Portuguese\r\nnation, they carried out his proposals in such a dilatory fashion, and\r\nwith so many exceptions and excuses, that he failed to obtain what he\r\nhad expected.\r\n\r\n  [146] Early in 1812, however, Wellington once more spoke of\r\n  requiring Souza’s retirement from office. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 88.\r\n\r\n  [147] Wellington to Charles Stuart, April 9, 1812. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 48.\r\n\r\nIn this there was a good deal of injustice. Wellington does not always\r\nseem to have realized the abject poverty which four years of war had\r\nbrought upon Portugal. The Regency calculated that, on account of\r\nfalling revenue caused by the late French invasion, for 1812 they could\r\nonly count on 12,000,000 _cruzados novos_ of receipts[148]--this silver\r\ncoin was worth about 2_s._ 6_d._ sterling, so that the total amounted\r\nto about £1,500,000. Of this three-fourths, or 9,000,000 cruzados, was\r\nset aside for the army, the remainder having to sustain all the other\r\nexpenses of the State--justice, civil administration, roads, navy, &c.\r\nThe British subsidy had been raised to £2,000,000 a year, but it was\r\npaid with the utmost irregularity: in one month of 1811 the Portuguese\r\ntreasury had received only £6,000, in another only £20,000, instead\r\nof the £166,000 promised[149]. When such arrears accumulated, it was\r\nno wonder that the soldiers starved and the magazines ran low. It\r\nwas calculated that to keep the army up to its full numbers, and to\r\nsupply all military needs efficiently, 45,000,000 cruzados a year were\r\nrequired. Taking the British subsidy as equalling 16,000,000, and the\r\navailable national contribution at 9,000,000 cruzados, there was little\r\nmore than half the required sum available. This Portuguese calculation\r\nappears to be borne out by the note of Beresford’s chief of the staff,\r\nD’Urban, in February 1812. ‘The Marshal at Lisbon finds that, after a\r\nperfect investigation, it appears that the expenditure must be nearly\r\n£6,000,000--the means at present £3,500,000! _Nous verrons._’\r\n\r\n  [148] Napier (iv. p. 212) says that Portugal raised 25,000,000\r\n  cruzados this year. I cannot understand this, comparing it with\r\n  Soriano de Luz, iii. p. 523, which quotes 12,000,000 cruzados as\r\n  the total receipt of taxes for 1811. Does Napier include loans,\r\n  and the inconvertible paper issued by the government?\r\n\r\n  [149] See complaints of the Conde de Redondo, the Portuguese\r\n  finance minister, in Soriano de Luz, iii. p. 520.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Portuguese government must have shrunk from many\r\nof Wellington’s suggestions on account of mere lack of resources.\r\nA third of the country had been at one time or another overrun by\r\nthe French--the provinces north of the Douro in 1809, the Beira and\r\nnorthern Estremadura in 1810-11. It would take long years before\r\nthey were in a position to make their former contributions to the\r\nexpenses of the State. It was impossible to get over this hard fact:\r\nbut Wellington thought that a rearrangement of taxes, and an honest\r\nadministration of their levy, would produce a much larger annual\r\nrevenue than was being raised in 1812. He pointed out, with some\r\nplausibility, that British money was being poured into Portugal by\r\nmillions and stopped there: some one--the merchant and contractor for\r\nthe most part--must be making enormous profits and accumulating untold\r\nwealth. Moreover he had discovered cases of the easy handling of the\r\nrich and influential in the matter of taxation, while the peasantry\r\nwere being drained of their last farthing. Such little jobs were\r\ncertain to occur in an administration of the _ancien régime_: fidalgos\r\nand capitalists knew how to square matters with officials at Lisbon.\r\n‘A reform in the abuses of the Customs of Lisbon and Oporto, a more\r\nequal and just collection of the Income Tax on commercial property,\r\nparticularly in those large and rich towns [it is scandalous to hear\r\nof the fortunes made by the mercantile classes owing to the war,\r\nand to reflect that they contribute practically nothing to bear its\r\nburdens], a reform of the naval establishment and the arsenal, would\r\nmake the income equal to the expenditure, and the government would get\r\non without calling upon Great Britain at every moment to find that\r\nwhich, in the existing state of the world, cannot be procured, viz.\r\nmoney[150].’ So wrote Wellington, who was always being irritated by\r\ndiscovering that the magazines of Elvas or Almeida were running low, or\r\nthat recruits were not rejoining their battalions because there was no\r\ncash to arm or clothe them, or that troops in the field were getting\r\nhalf-rations, unless they were on the British subsidy list.\r\n\r\n  [150] See tables on pp. 324-5 of Halliday’s _Present State of\r\n  Portugal_, published in 1812.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Wellington was right in saying that there was a certain\r\namount of jobbery in the distribution of taxation, and that more could\r\nhave been raised by a better system. But Portuguese figures of the\r\ntime seem to make it clear that even if a supernatural genius had\r\nbeen administering the revenue instead of the Conde de Redondo, all\r\ncould not have been obtained that was demanded. The burden of the war\r\nexpenses was too heavy for an impoverished country, with no more than\r\ntwo and a half million inhabitants, which was compelled to import a\r\ngreat part of its provisions owing to the stress of war. The state\r\nof Portugal may be estimated by the fact that in the twelve months\r\nbetween February 1811 and January 1812 £2,672,000 worth of imported\r\ncorn, besides 605,000 barrels of flour, valued at £2,051,780 more,\r\nwas brought into the country and sold there[151]. On the other hand\r\nthe export of wine, with which Portugal used to pay for its foreign\r\npurchases, had fallen off terribly: in 1811 only 18,000 pipes were\r\nsold as against an average of 40,000 for the eight years before the\r\noutbreak of the Peninsular War. An intelligent observer wrote in 1812\r\nthat the commercial distress of the country might mainly be traced to\r\nthe fact that nearly all the money which came into the country from\r\nEngland, great as was the sum, found its way to the countries from\r\nwhich Portugal was drawing food, mainly to the United States, from\r\nwhich the largest share of the wheat and flour was brought. ‘As we\r\nhave no corresponding trade with America, the balance has been very\r\ngreat against this country: for the last three years this expenditure\r\nhas been very considerable, without any return whatever, as the money\r\ncarried to America has been completely withdrawn from circulation.’\r\n\r\n  [151] Halliday’s _Present State of Portugal_, p. 320.\r\n\r\nThe shrinkage in the amount of the gold and silver current in Portugal\r\nwas as noticeable in these years as the same phenomenon in England,\r\nand (like the British) the Portuguese government tried to make up the\r\ndeficiency by the issue of inconvertible paper money, which gradually\r\nfell in exchange value as compared with the metallic currency. The\r\nofficers of the army, as well as all civil functionaries, were paid\r\ntheir salaries half in cash and half in notes--the latter suffered a\r\ndepreciation of from 15 to 30 per cent. Among the cares which weighed\r\non Wellington and Charles Stuart was that of endeavouring to keep the\r\nRegency from the easy expedient of issuing more and more of a paper\r\ncurrency which was already circulating at far less than its face value.\r\nThis was avoided--fortunately for the Portuguese people and army, no\r\nless than for the Anglo-Portuguese alliance.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the practical results of the efforts made by the Portuguese\r\ngovernment were invaluable. Wellington could not have held his ground,\r\nmuch less have undertaken the offensive campaign of 1812, without the\r\naid of the trusty auxiliaries that swelled his divisions to normal\r\nsize. Without their Portuguese brigades most of them would have been\r\nmere skeletons of 3,000 or 4,000 men. Beresford’s army was almost up\r\nto its full establishment in January 1812--there were 59,122 men on\r\nthe rolls, when recruits, sick, men on detachment, and the regiment\r\nlent for the succour of Cadiz are all counted. Deducting, beyond these,\r\nthe garrisons of Elvas, Abrantes, Almeida, and smaller places, as also\r\nthe dismounted cavalry left in the rear[152], there were over 30,000\r\nmen for the fighting-line, in ten brigades of infantry, six regiments\r\nof cavalry, and eight field-batteries. Beresford, lately entrusted\r\nby orders from Rio Janeiro with still more stringent powers over the\r\nmilitary establishment, was using them to the full. An iron hand kept\r\ndown desertion and marauding, executions for each of those offences\r\nappear incessantly in the _Ordens do Dia_, which give the daily\r\nchronicle of the Portuguese head-quarters. In addition to the regular\r\narmy it must be remembered that he had to manage the militia, of which\r\nas many as 52,000 men were under arms at one time or another in 1812.\r\nCounting the first and the second line together, there were 110,000 men\r\nenrolled--a fine total for a people of two and a half million souls.\r\n\r\n  [152] The deductions were--sick, 7,500; untrained recruits,\r\n  4,000; dismounted cavalry, 3,000; regiment at Cadiz, 1,500;\r\n  garrisons (infantry and artillery) and men on detachment, 10,000;\r\n  leaving some 33,000 for the field. By May the gross total had\r\n  gone down to 56,674.\r\n\r\nPutting purely Portuguese difficulties aside, Wellington was much\r\nworried at this time by a trouble which concerned the British and not\r\nthe local finances. This was the delay in the cashing of the ‘_vales_’\r\nor bills for payment issued by the Commissary-General for food and\r\nforage bought from the peasantry. As long as they were settled at short\r\nintervals, no difficulty arose about them--they were indeed treated\r\nas negotiable paper, and had passed from hand to hand at a lesser\r\ndiscount than the inconvertible Portuguese government papers. But all\r\nthrough the year 1811 the interval between the issue of the ‘_vale_’\r\nand its payment in cash at Lisbon had been growing longer, and an\r\nuncomfortable feeling was beginning to spread about the country-side.\r\nThe peasantry were growing suspicious, and were commencing to sell\r\nthe bills, for much less than their face value, to speculators who\r\ncould afford to wait for payment. To recoup themselves for their loss\r\nthey were showing signs of raising prices all round. Fortunately they\r\nwere a simple race, and communication between districts was slow and\r\nuncertain, so that no general tendency of this sort was yet prevalent,\r\nthough the symptoms were making themselves visible here and there.\r\nHence came Wellington’s constant applications for more cash from\r\nEngland at shorter notice. Late in the spring he devised a scheme by\r\nwhich interest at 5 per cent. was to be paid by the Commissary-General\r\non bonds or certificates representing money or money’s worth advanced\r\nto the British army, till the principal was repaid--two years being\r\nnamed as the period after which the whole sum must be refunded. This\r\nwas a desperate measure, an endeavour to throw forward payment on to\r\na remote future, ‘when it is not probable that there will be the same\r\ndifficulty in procuring specie in England to send abroad as there is\r\nat the present moment.’ The plan[153] was never tried, and was not\r\ngood: for how could small creditors of the English army be expected\r\nto stand out of their money--representing the price of their crops\r\nor their cattle--for so long a period as two years, even if they\r\nwere, in the meantime, receiving interest on what was really their\r\nworking capital? Wellington himself remarked, when broaching the\r\nscheme to Lord Liverpool, that there remained the difficulty that no\r\none could look forward, and say that the British army would still be\r\nin the Peninsula two years hence. If it had left Portugal--whether\r\nvictorious and pushing towards the Pyrenees, or defeated and driven\r\nback on to Great Britain--how would the creditors communicate with\r\nthe Commissary-General, their debtor? They could only be referred to\r\nLondon, to which they would have no ready access: indeed many of them\r\nwould not know where, or what, London was. That such an idea should\r\nhave been set forward only shows the desperate financial situation of\r\nthe British army.\r\n\r\n  [153] Set forth in detail, and with a sample bond for 1,000\r\n  dollars added, in _Dispatches_, ix. pp. 104-5.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to be referring to this problem at several later points\r\nof the history of the campaign of 1812[154]: at the opening of the\r\ninvasion of Leon in June it reached its worst point, just before\r\nthe great victory of Salamanca. But it was always present, and\r\nwhen Wellington’s mind was not occupied with deductions as to the\r\nmanœuvres of French marshals, it may undoubtedly be said that his\r\nmain preoccupation was the normally depleted state of the military\r\nchest, into which dollars and guineas flowed, it is true, in enormous\r\nquantities, but only to be paid out at once, in settling arrears many\r\nmonths old. These were never fully liquidated, and began to accumulate\r\nagain, with distressing rapidity, after every tardy settlement.\r\n\r\n  [154] See especially below in chapter iii of section xxxiii. p.\r\n  349.\r\n\r\nWhig historians have often tried to represent Wellington’s financial\r\ndifficulties as the fault of the home government, and it is easy to\r\npick passages from his dispatches in which he seems to assert that\r\nhe is not being supported according to his necessities. But a nearer\r\ninvestigation of the facts will not bear out this easy theory, the\r\nproduct of party spite. The Whigs of 1811-12 were occupied in decrying\r\nthe Peninsular War as a failure, in minimizing the successes of\r\nWellington, and in complaining that the vast sums of money lavished on\r\nhis army were wasted. Napoleon was invincible, peace was the only way\r\nout of disaster, even if the peace must be somewhat humiliating. It\r\nwas unseemly for their representatives, twenty years after, to taunt\r\nthe Perceval and Liverpool ministries with having stinted Wellington\r\nin his hour of need. We have learnt to estimate at their proper\r\nvalue tirades against ‘the administration which was characterized\r\nby all the corruption and tyranny of Mr. Pitt’s system, without his\r\nredeeming genius.’ We no longer think that the Napoleonic War was waged\r\n‘to repress the democratic principle,’ nor that the cabinets which\r\nmaintained it were ‘the rapacious usurpers of the people’s rights[155].’\r\n\r\n  [155] For these phrases and much more abuse, see Napier, iv. p.\r\n  199, a most venomous and unjust passage.\r\n\r\nRather, in the spirit of Mr. Fortescue’s admirable volume on _British\r\nStatesmen of the Great War_, shall we be prone to stand amazed at\r\nthe courage and resolution of the group of British ministers who\r\nstood out, for long years and against tremendous odds, to defeat the\r\ntyrant of Europe and to preserve the British Empire. ‘On the one side\r\nwas Napoleon, an autocrat vested with such powers as great genius\r\nand good fortune have rarely placed in the hands of one man, with\r\nthe resources of half Europe at his disposition, and an armed force\r\nunsurpassed in strength and devotion ready to march to the ends of\r\nthe world to uphold his will. On the other were these plain English\r\ngentlemen, with not so much as a force of police at their back, with a\r\npopulation by nature five times as turbulent as it is now, and in the\r\nmanufacturing districts inflamed alike by revolutionary teaching and by\r\nreal distress, with an Ireland always perilously near revolt, with a\r\nHouse of Commons unreformed indeed, but not on that account containing\r\na less factious, mischievous, and obstructive opposition than any\r\nother House of Commons during a great war. In face of all these\r\ndifficulties they had to raise armies, maintain fleets, construct and\r\npursue a military policy, and be unsuccessful at their peril. Napoleon\r\nmight lose whole armies with impunity: five thousand British soldiers\r\nbeaten and captured would have brought any British minister’s head\r\nperilously near the block. Such were the difficulties that confronted\r\nPerceval, Liverpool, and Castlereagh: yet for their country’s sake they\r\nencountered them without flinching[156].’\r\n\r\n  [156] Fortescue’s _British Statesmen_, pp. 277-8.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1811-12 was not quite the darkest hour: the Russian war\r\nwas looming in the near future, and Napoleon was already beginning to\r\nwithdraw troops from Spain in preparation for it. No longer therefore,\r\nas in 1810 and the earlier half of 1811, was there a high probability\r\nthat the main bulk of the French armies, under the Emperor himself,\r\nmight be turned once more against the Peninsula. It was all but certain\r\nthat England would soon have allies, and not stand practically alone\r\nin the struggle, as she had done ever since Wagram. Nevertheless, even\r\nwith the political horizon somewhat brightened in the East, the time\r\nwas a sufficiently anxious one. In Great Britain, as in the rest of\r\nEurope, the harvest of 1811 had been exceptionally bad, and the high\r\nprice of bread, coinciding with much unemployment, was causing not only\r\ndistress but wide-spread turbulence in the manufacturing districts.\r\nThis was the year of the first outbreak of the ‘Luddites,’ and of their\r\nsenseless exploits in the way of machine-smashing. The worst stringency\r\nof domestic troubles coincided with the gradual disappearance of the\r\nexternal danger from the ambition of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIn addition it must be remembered that the Perceval cabinet, on which\r\nall the responsibilities fell, was by no means firmly established in\r\npower. When it first took office many politicians believed that it\r\ncould not last for a single year. All through 1811 the Prince Regent\r\nhad been in secret negotiation with the Whigs, and would gladly have\r\nreplaced his ministers with some sort of a coalition government. And\r\nin January 1812 Lord Wellesley, by far the most distinguished man in\r\nthe cabinet, resigned his post as Foreign Minister. He asserted that\r\nhe did so because his colleagues had failed to accept all his plans\r\nfor the support of his brother and the Peninsular army: and no doubt\r\nthis was to a certain extent true. Yet it cannot be said that, either\r\nbefore or after his resignation, the Ministry had neglected Wellington;\r\nin 1811 they had doubled his force of cavalry, and sent him about a\r\ndozen new battalions of infantry. It was these reinforcements which\r\nmade the victories of 1812 possible, and in that year the stream of\r\nreinforcements did not cease--nine more infantry regiments came out,\r\nmostly in time for the great crisis in June[157]. In the autumn the\r\ndispatch of further succours had become difficult, because of the\r\noutbreak of the American war, which diverted of necessity to Canada\r\nmany units that might otherwise have gone to Spain. It is impossible to\r\nmaintain that Wellington was stinted of men: money was the difficulty.\r\nAnd even as regards money--which had to be gold or silver, since paper\r\nwas useless in the Peninsula--the resources placed at his disposal were\r\nmuch larger than in previous years, though not so large as he demanded,\r\nnor as the growing scale of the war required.\r\n\r\n  [157] _Per contra_ five depleted second battalions went home.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to acquit Wellesley of factiousness with regard to\r\nhis resignation, and the most damaging document against him is the\r\n_apologia_ drawn up by his devoted adherent Shawe[158], in the belief\r\nthat it afforded a complete justification for his conduct: many of\r\nthe words and phrases are the Marquess’s own. From this paper no one\r\ncan fail to deduce that it was not so much a quixotic devotion to his\r\nbrother’s interests, as an immoderate conception of his own dignity\r\nand importance that made Wellesley resign. He could not stand the free\r\ndiscussion and criticism of plans and policies which is essential in\r\na cabinet. ‘Lord Wellesley has always complained, with some justice,\r\nthat his suggestions were received as those of a mere novice.... His\r\nopinions were overruled, and the opposition he met with could only\r\nproceed from jealousy, or from a real contempt for his judgement.\r\nIt seemed to him that they were unwilling to adopt any plan of his,\r\nlest it might lead to his assuming a general ascendancy in the\r\nCabinet.... He said that he took another view of the situation: the\r\nGovernment derived the most essential support from his joining it,\r\nbecause it was considered as a pledge that the war would be properly\r\nsupported.... “The war is popular, and any government that will\r\nsupport Lord Wellington properly will stand. I do not think the war\r\nis properly supported, and I cannot, as an honest man, deceive the\r\nnation by remaining in office.” ... It is needless to particularize all\r\nthe points of difference between Lord Wellesley and his colleagues:\r\nSpain was the main point, but he also disapproved of their obstinate\r\nadherence to the Orders in Council, and their policy towards America\r\nand in Sicily’--not to speak of Catholic Emancipation.\r\n\r\n  [158] Printed in Wellington’s _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii.\r\n  pp. 257-88.\r\n\r\nThese are the words of injured pride, not of patriotism. The essential\r\nthing at the moment was that the war in Spain should be kept up\r\nefficiently. By resigning, Wellesley intended to break up the Ministry,\r\nand of this a probable result might have been the return to office of\r\nthe Whigs, whose policy was to abandon the Peninsula and make peace\r\nwith Napoleon. Wellesley’s _apologia_ acknowledges that his influence\r\nin the Cabinet had brought about, on more occasions than one, an\r\nincrease of the support given to his brother, e.g. his colleagues had\r\ngiven in about additions to the Portuguese subsidy, and about extra\r\nreinforcements to the army. This being so, it was surely criminal in\r\nhim to retire, when he found that some of his further suggestions were\r\nnot followed. Would the wrecking of the Perceval cabinet, and the\r\nsuccession of the Whigs to power, have served Wellington or the general\r\ncause of the British Empire?\r\n\r\nWellington himself saw the situation with clear eyes, and in a letter,\r\nin which a touch of his sardonic humour can be detected, wrote in reply\r\nto his brother’s announcement of his resignation that ‘In truth the\r\nrepublic of a cabinet is but little suited to any man of taste or of\r\nlarge views[159].’ There lay the difficulty: the great viceroy loved to\r\ndictate, and hated to hear his opinions criticized. Lord Liverpool, in\r\nannouncing the rupture to Wellington in a letter of a rather apologetic\r\ncast, explains the situation in a very few words: ‘Lord Wellesley\r\nsays generally that he has not the weight in the Government which he\r\nexpected, when he accepted office.... The Government, though a cabinet,\r\nis necessarily _inter pares_, in which every member must expect to\r\nhave his opinions and his dispatches canvassed, and this previous\r\nfriendly canvass of opinions and measures appears necessary, under\r\na constitution where all public acts of ministers will be hostilely\r\ndebated in parliament.’ The Marquess resented all criticism whatever.\r\n\r\n  [159] Wellington to Wellesley, camp before Badajoz,\r\n  _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. p. 307.\r\n\r\nThe ministers assured Wellington that his brother’s resignation would\r\nmake no difference in their relations with himself, and invited him to\r\nwrite as freely to Lord Castlereagh, who succeeded Wellesley at the\r\nForeign Office, as to his predecessor. The assurance of the Cabinet’s\r\ngood will and continued confidence was received--as it had been\r\ngiven--in all sincerity. Not the least change in Wellington’s relations\r\nwith the Ministry can be detected from his dispatches. Nor can it be\r\nsaid that the support which he received from home varied in the least,\r\nafter his brother’s secession from the Cabinet. Even the grudging\r\nNapier is forced to concede this much, though he endeavours to deprive\r\nthe Perceval ministry of any credit, by asserting that their only\r\nchance of continuance in office depended on the continued prosperity\r\nof Wellington. Granting this, we must still conclude that Wellesley’s\r\nresignation, even if it produced no disastrous results--as it well\r\nmight have done--was yet an unhappy exhibition of pride and petulance.\r\nA patriotic statesman should have subordinated his own _amour propre_\r\nto the welfare of Great Britain, which demanded that a strong\r\nadministration, pledged to the continuance of war with Napoleon, should\r\ndirect the helm of the State. He did his best to wreck Perceval’s\r\ncabinet, and to put the Whigs in power.\r\n\r\nThe crisis in the Ministry passed off with less friction and less\r\nresults than most London observers had expected, and Lord Liverpool\r\nturned out to be right when he asserted that in his opinion[160]\r\nit would be of no material prejudice to the Perceval government.\r\nCastlereagh, despite of his halting speech and his involved phrases,\r\nwas a tower of strength at the Foreign Office, and certainly replaced\r\nWellesley with no disadvantage to the general policy of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  [160] Liverpool to Wellington, _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii.\r\n  p. 257.\r\n\r\nHere the jealousies and bickerings in London may be left for a space.\r\nWe shall only need to turn back for a moment to ministerial matters\r\nwhen, at midsummer, the whole situation had been transformed, for\r\nFrance and Russia were at last openly engaged in war, a great relief\r\nto British statesmen, although at the same time a new trouble was\r\narising in the West to distract their attention. For the same month\r\nthat started Napoleon on his way to Moscow saw President Madison’s\r\ndeclaration of war on Great Britain, and raised problems, both on\r\nthe high seas and on the frontiers of Canada, that would have seemed\r\nheart-breaking and insoluble if the strength of France had not been\r\nengaged elsewhere. But the ‘stab in the back,’ as angry British\r\npoliticians called it, was delivered too late to be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S FIRST CAMPAIGN OF 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with no small relief that we turn away from the annals of the\r\npetty warfare in the provinces and of the bickerings of politicians,\r\nto follow the doings of Wellington. All the ‘alarms and excursions’\r\nthat we have been narrating were of small import, compared with the\r\noperations on the frontiers of Portugal and Leon which began at the New\r\nYear of 1812. Here we have arrived at the true backbone of the war, the\r\ncentral fact which governed all the rest. Here we follow the working\r\nout of a definite plan conceived by a master-mind, and are no longer\r\ndealing with spasmodic movements dictated by the necessities of the\r\nmoment. For the initiative had at last fallen into Wellington’s hands,\r\nand the schemes of Soult and Marmont were no longer to determine his\r\nmovements. On the contrary, it was he who was to dictate theirs.\r\n\r\nThe governing factor in the situation in the end of December 1811 was,\r\nas we have already shown, the fact that Marmont’s army had been so\r\ndistracted by the Alicante expedition, undertaken by Napoleon’s special\r\norders, that it was no longer in a position to concentrate, in full\r\nforce and within a reasonably short period of time. It was on December\r\n13th[161] that the Duke of Ragusa received the definitive orders,\r\nwritten on November 20-1, that bade him to send towards Valencia, for\r\nSuchet’s benefit, such a force as, when joined by a detachment from\r\nthe Army of the Centre, should make up 12,000 men, and to find 3,000\r\nor 4,000 more to cover the line of communications of the expedition.\r\nAccordingly orders were issued to Montbrun to take up the enterprise,\r\nwith the divisions of Foy and Sarrut, and his own cavalry; the\r\nconcentration of the corps began on December 15th, and on December 29th\r\nit marched eastward from La Mancha[162] on its fruitless raid.\r\n\r\n  [161] For this date see Marmont to Berthier, from Valladolid,\r\n  Feb. 6, 1812.\r\n\r\n  [162] For details, see chapter iii of section xxx above.\r\n\r\nWellington’s policy at this moment depended on the exact distribution\r\nof the hostile armies in front of him. He lay with the bulk of his army\r\nwintering in cantonments along the frontier of Portugal and Leon, but\r\nwith the Light Division pushed close up to Ciudad Rodrigo, and ready to\r\ninvest it, the moment that the news should arrive that the French had\r\nso moved their forces as to make it possible for him to close in upon\r\nthat fortress, without the danger of a very large army appearing to\r\nrelieve it within a few days. On December 28th he summed up his scheme\r\nin a report to Lord Liverpool, in which he stated that, after the El\r\nBodon-Aldea da Ponte fighting in September, he had ‘determined to\r\npersevere in the same system till the enemy should make some alteration\r\nin the disposition of his forces[163].’ In the meanwhile he judged that\r\nhe was keeping Marmont and Dorsenne ‘contained,’ and preventing them\r\nfrom undertaking operations elsewhere, unless they were prepared to\r\nrisk the chance of losing Rodrigo. ‘It would not answer to remove the\r\narmy to the frontiers of Estremadura (where a chance of effecting some\r\nimportant object might have offered), as in that case General Abadia\r\n[and the Spanish Army of Galicia] would have been left to himself, and\r\nwould have fallen an easy sacrifice to the Army of the North[164].’\r\nTherefore Wellington refused to take the opportunity of descending upon\r\nBadajoz and driving Drouet out of Estremadura, though these operations\r\nwere perfectly possible. He confined himself to ordering Hill to\r\ncarry out the two raids in this direction, of which the first led to\r\nthe destruction of Girard at Arroyo dos Molinos in October, and the\r\nsecond to the occupation of Merida and the expulsion of the French from\r\ncentral Estremadura at midwinter [December 27, 1811-January 13, 1812].\r\n\r\n  [163] _Dispatches_, viii. p. 516.\r\n\r\n  [164] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, Dec. 28.\r\n\r\nIn October Wellington had hoped for some time that Rodrigo would be\r\ngravely incommoded for lack of provisions, for it was almost cut\r\noff from the army to which it belonged by the guerrillero bands of\r\nJulian Sanchez, who dominated all the country between the Agueda\r\nand Salamanca, while the Light Division lay on the heights close\r\nabove it, ready to pounce on any convoy that might try to pass in.\r\nThis expectation, however, had been disappointed, as a large amount\r\nof food had been thrown into the place on November 2nd by General\r\nThiébault, the governor of Salamanca. This revictualling had only\r\nbeen accomplished by a mixture of good management and good luck. The\r\ngovernor saw that any convoy must have a large escort, because of the\r\nguerrilleros, who would have cut off a small one. But a large escort\r\ncould not move very fast, or escape notice. Wherefore, taking no mean\r\nrisk, Thiébault collected 3,400 men for a guard, stopped all exit of\r\nSpaniards from Salamanca two days before the convoy started, gave out\r\na false destination for his movement, and sent out requisitions for\r\nrations for 12,000 men in the villages between the starting-place and\r\nRodrigo. Wellington had been on the look-out for some such attempt,\r\nand had intended that the Light Division, from its lair at Martiago\r\nin the mountain-valleys above the city, should descend upon any force\r\nof moderate size that might approach. But receiving, rather late, the\r\nfalse news that at least three whole divisions were to serve as escort,\r\nhe forbade Craufurd to risk anything till he should have received\r\nreinforcements. The same day the Agueda became unfordable owing to\r\nsudden rains, and no troops could be sent across to join Craufurd.\r\nWherefore Thiébault got by, ere the smallness of his force was\r\nrealized, and retreated with such haste, after throwing in the food,\r\nthat the Light Division could not come up with him[165]. Such luck\r\ncould not be expected another time!\r\n\r\n  [165] For details of this operation see Thiébault’s _Mémoires_,\r\n  iv. pp. 538-43, corroborated by Wellington’s _Dispatches_, viii.\r\n  pp. 373-5 and 385-6.\r\n\r\nWellington had begun to hurry up the nearest divisions to support\r\nCraufurd, and had supposed for two days that he would have serious\r\nfighting, since he imagined that 15,000 or 18,000 men at least had been\r\nbrought up to guard the convoy. It was a grave disappointment to him\r\nto find that he had been misled, for it was clear that Rodrigo would\r\nnot be straitened for food for many a day. He had now to fall back on\r\nhis original scheme of reducing the place by a regular siege, when the\r\npropitious instant should come round.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, waiting for the moment when Marmont and Dorsenne should\r\ndisperse their troops into a less concentrated position, he took\r\npreliminary measures to face that eventuality when it should occur.\r\nThe main thing was to get the battering-train, with which Ciudad\r\nRodrigo would have to be attacked, close up to its objective. As we\r\nhave already seen[166], it had been collected far to the rear, at the\r\nobscure village of Villa da Ponte near Trancoso. Between that spot and\r\nRodrigo there were eighty miles of bad mountain roads: if Wellington\r\nhad waited till he heard that Marmont had moved, before he began to\r\nbring up his heavy guns, he would have lost many days. Accordingly\r\nhe commenced to push them forward as early as November 12th: their\r\ntemporary shelter was to be in the fortress of Almeida, which was\r\nalready so far restored that it could be regarded as safe against\r\nanything short of a regular siege. It was certain that Marmont would\r\nnot come forward at midwinter for any such operation, and against\r\nraids or demonstrations the place was already secure. On December 4th\r\nWellington reported[167] to Lord Liverpool that it would be completely\r\n‘re-established as a military post’ within a few weeks; and on the\r\n19th he announced that it was now ‘a place of security,’ and could\r\nbe trusted to resist any attack whatever. But, long before even the\r\nfirst of these dates, it was beginning to receive the siege-material\r\nwhich Alexander Dickson was ordered to bring up from the rear. As\r\nearly as November 22nd the first division of heavy guns entered its\r\ngates: it was given out--to deceive French spies--that the pieces\r\nwere only intended to arm the walls, and at the same time Dickson\r\nwas actively employed in mounting on them a number of guns of heavy\r\ncalibre, wrecked in the explosion when Brennier evacuated Almeida in\r\nMay 1811. Twenty-five of them were in position before Christmas Day.\r\nThe indefatigable artillery commandant had also hunted out of the\r\nruins no less than 8,000 round shot: it was originally intended that\r\nthey should go into the magazines of the garrison; but, when the time\r\nfor action came, Wellington sent the greater part of this stock of\r\nsecond-hand shot to the front, because they were immediately available,\r\nand ordered the Almeida stores to be replenished, as occasion served,\r\nby the later convoys that arrived from Villa da Ponte.\r\n\r\n  [166] See vol. iv. p. 549.\r\n\r\n  [167] _Dispatches_, viii, Report of Dec. 28 to Lord Liverpool on\r\n  the late campaign.\r\n\r\nNor was it in bringing forward guns and ammunition alone that\r\nWellington was busy during December: he caused a great quantity of\r\ngabions and fascines to be constructed by the men of the four divisions\r\nnearest the front, giving two vintems (2½_d._) for every fascine\r\nand four for every gabion. He had a very strong trestle-bridge cast\r\nacross the Agueda at Marialva, seven miles north of Rodrigo and out of\r\nthe reach of its garrison, and he began to collect carts from every\r\ndirection. Not only were they requisitioned in Beira, but Carlos de\r\nEspaña, who was lying in a somewhat venturesome position within the\r\nfrontiers of Leon, ordered the Spanish peasantry, even as far as\r\nTamames, to send every available ox-wain west-ward--and many came,\r\nthough their owners were risking dire chastisement at the hands of the\r\ngovernor of the province of Salamanca.\r\n\r\nMarmont, as we have seen, began to move troops eastward for Montbrun’s\r\nValencian expedition about December 15th. The first news of this\r\ndisplacement reached Wellington on the 24th, when he heard that\r\nBrennier’s division had evacuated Plasencia and fallen back behind\r\nthe Tietar, taking with it all its baggage, sick, and stores. This\r\nmight be no more than a change of cantonments for a single division,\r\nor it might be a part of a general strategical move. Wellington wrote\r\nto Hill that evening, ‘some say they are going to Valencia, some that\r\nthey are to cross the Tagus. I will let you know if I should learn\r\nanything positive. I have not yet heard whether the movement has been\r\ngeneral, or is confined to this particular division[168].’ The right\r\ndeduction was not drawn with certainty, because at the same time false\r\nintelligence was brought that Foy had started from Toledo and gone into\r\nLa Mancha, but had returned again. This was a confused account of his\r\nmovement; but the rumour of his coming back discounted the certain\r\nnews about Brennier’s eastward move[169].\r\n\r\n  [168] Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 482, compare\r\n  Wellington to Liverpool, viii. pp. 485-6, of the next morning.\r\n\r\n  [169] See _Dispatches_, viii. p. 520. See the Dickson MSS.,\r\n  edited by Major Leslie, for letter from Almeida in December.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th came the very important additional information that on the\r\n26th Clausel’s Division, hitherto lying on the Upper Tormes, above\r\nSalamanca, had marched upon Avila, and that the division already at\r\nAvila was moving on some unknown eastward destination. At the same time\r\nWellington received the perfectly correct information that all the\r\ncavalry of the Imperial Guard in Old Castile had already started for\r\nBayonne, and that the two infantry divisions of the Young Guard, which\r\nformed the most effective part of Dorsenne’s Army of the North, were\r\nunder orders to march northward from Valladolid, and had already begun\r\nto move.[170] This was certain--less so a report sent in by Castaños to\r\nthe effect that he had learnt that the whole Army of Portugal was about\r\nto concentrate at Toledo. On this Wellington writes to Graham that ‘he\r\nimagines it is only a report from Alcaldes’--a class of correspondents\r\non whose accuracy and perspicacity he was not accustomed to rely\r\nover-much[171].\r\n\r\n  [170] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, Jan. 1, _Dispatches_, viii.\r\n  p. 524.\r\n\r\n  [171] See Wellington to Graham, Dec. 26, _Dispatches_, viii. p.\r\n  521.\r\n\r\nBut enough information had come to hand to make it clear that a\r\ngeneral eastward movement of the French was taking place, and that\r\nthe troops immediately available for the succour of Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nwere both decreased in numbers and removed farther from the sphere of\r\nWellington’s future operations. He thought that the opportunity given\r\njustified him in striking at once, and had drawn at last the correct\r\ndeduction: ‘I conclude that all these movements have for their object\r\nto support Suchet’s operations in Valencia, or even to co-operate with\r\nhim[172].’ If Marmont were extending his troops so far east as the\r\nValencian border, and if Dorsenne were withdrawing divisions northward\r\nfrom Valladolid, it was clear that they could not concentrate in any\r\nshort space of time for the deliverance of Rodrigo. It was possible\r\nthat the siege might linger on long enough to enable the Armies of\r\nPortugal and the North to unite; Wellington calculated that it might\r\ntake as much as twenty-four or even thirty days--an estimate which\r\nhappily turned out to be exaggerated: in the end he stormed it only\r\ntwelve days after investment. But even if Rodrigo should resist its\r\nbesiegers sufficiently long to permit of a general concentration of\r\nthe enemy, that concentration would disarrange all their schemes, and\r\nweaken their hold on many outlying parts of the Peninsula. ‘If I do not\r\nsucceed,’ wrote Wellington, ‘I shall at least bring back some of the\r\ntroops of the Army of the North, and the Army of Portugal, and shall\r\nso far relieve the Guerrillas [Mina, Longa, Porlier] and the Spanish\r\nArmy in Valencia[173].’ The last-named force was, as a matter of fact,\r\nbeyond saving, when Wellington wrote his letter to Lord Liverpool. But\r\nhe could not know it, and if Blake had behaved with common prudence\r\nand foresight in the end of December, his game ought not to have been\r\nplayed out to a disastrous end early in January, just when the British\r\nwere moving out to the leaguer of Rodrigo.\r\n\r\n  [172] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 524.\r\n\r\n  [173] Another extract from the explanatory dispatch to Lord\r\n  Liverpool, written on Jan. 1st, 1812.\r\n\r\nAll the divisions cantoned upon or behind the Beira frontier received,\r\non January 2nd-3rd, the orders which bade them prepare to push up to\r\nthe line of the Agueda. Only the 6th Division, which lay farthest off,\r\nas far back as Mangualde and Penaverde near the Upper Mondego, was not\r\nbrought up to the front within the next few days. The 1st Division had\r\na long march from Guarda, Celorico, and Penamacor, the 4th and 5th\r\nDivisions very short ones from Aldea del Obispo and Alameda, Villa de\r\nCiervo, and other villages near Almeida. The 3rd Division from Aldea\r\nda Ponte and Navas Frias had a journey greater than those of the two\r\nlast-named units, but much less than that of the 1st Division. Finally\r\nthe Light Division was, it may be said, already in position: its\r\noutlying pickets at Pastores and Zamorra were already within six miles\r\nof Rodrigo, and its head-quarters at Martiago only a short distance\r\nfarther back.\r\n\r\nBy January 5th the divisions were all at the front, though their march\r\nhad been carried out in very inclement weather--heavy snow fell on\r\nthe night of the 1st-2nd of the month, and continued to fall on the\r\nthird; while on the 4th the wind shifted, the snow turned to sleet, and\r\nthe roads grew soft and slushy. The carts with stores and ammunition,\r\npushing forward from Almeida, only reached Gallegos--ten miles away--in\r\ntwo days. The troops were well forward--the 1st Division at Espeja and\r\nGallegos, the 3rd at Martiago and Zamorra, the 4th at San Felices,\r\nbeyond the Agueda, the Light Division at Pastores, La Encina and El\r\nBodon. But Wellington nevertheless had to put off the investment for\r\nthree days, because the train was not to the front. On the 6th he\r\ncrossed the Agueda with his staff and made a close reconnaissance of\r\nthe place, unmolested by the garrison. But it was only on the 8th that\r\nthe divisions, who were suffering severely from exposure to the wintry\r\nweather, received orders to close in and complete the investment.\r\n\r\nOf the topography of Ciudad Rodrigo we have already spoken at some\r\nlength, when dealing with its siege by Ney in 1810. The French\r\noccupation had made no essential change to its character. The only\r\nadditions to its works made during the last eighteen months were the\r\nerection of a small fort on the summit of the Greater Teson, and the\r\nreinforcing by masonry of the three large convents in the suburb of San\r\nFrancisco, which the Spaniards had already used as places of strength.\r\nThe first-named work was a redoubt (named Redout Renaud, from the\r\ngovernor whom Julian Sanchez had kidnapped in October): it mounted\r\nthree guns, had a ditch and palisades, and was built for a garrison of\r\nseventy men. Its gorge contained a sally-port opening towards the town,\r\nand was closed with palisades only. Four guns on the stone roof of the\r\nfortified convent of San Francisco, and many more in the northern front\r\nof the _enceinte_, bore upon it, and were intended to make access to it\r\ndangerous and costly.\r\n\r\nThe breaches made during Ney’s siege, in the walls facing the Tesons,\r\nhad been well built up: but the new masonry, clearly distinguishable\r\nby its fresh colour from the older stone, had not set over well, and\r\nproved less hard when battered.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, supplied by the Army of the North, was not so numerous\r\nas it should have been, particularly when it was intended to hold not\r\nonly the _enceinte_ of the small circular town but the straggling\r\nsuburb outside. It consisted of a battalion each of the 34th Léger and\r\nthe 113th Line, from the division of Thiébault (that long commanded\r\nin 1810-11 by Serras), making about 1,600 men, with two companies\r\nof Artillery and a small detachment of sappers--the whole at the\r\ncommencement of the siege did not amount to quite 2,000 of all ranks,\r\neven including the sick in the hospital. The governor was General\r\nBarrié, an officer who had been thrust into the post much contrary\r\nto his will, because he was the only general of brigade available at\r\nSalamanca when his predecessor Renaud was taken by Julian Sanchez[174].\r\nThe strength of the garrison had been deliberately kept low by\r\nDorsenne, because of the immense difficulty of supplying it with\r\nprovisions. The first convoy for its support had only been introduced\r\nby bringing up 60,000 men, at the time of the fighting about El Bodon\r\nin September: the second only by Thiébault’s risky expedient on\r\nNovember 2nd.\r\n\r\n  [174] For details of this see Thiébault’s _Mémoires_, iv. p. 537,\r\n  where Barrié’s frank dismay at his appointment, and the arguments\r\n  used to overcome it, are described at length.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that was abundant in the garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo on\r\nJanuary 8th, 1812, was artillery. Inside the place was lying the whole\r\nsiege-train of the Army of Portugal, which Masséna had stored there\r\nwhen he started on his march into Portugal in September 1811. No less\r\nthan 153 heavy guns, with the corresponding stores and ammunition, were\r\nparked there. A small fortress was never so stocked with munitions of\r\nwar, and the besieged made a lavish and unsparing use of them during\r\nthe defence: but though the shot and shell were available in unlimited\r\nquantities, the gunners were not--a fortunate thing for the besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe details of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo are interesting. This was\r\nthe only one of Wellington’s sieges in which everything went without\r\na serious hitch from first to last--so much so that he took the place\r\nin twelve days, when he had not dared to make his calculation for\r\nless than twenty-four[175]. Even the thing which seemed at first his\r\ngreatest hindrance--the extreme inclemency of the weather--turned\r\nout in the end profitable. The sleet had stopped on the 6th, and a\r\ntime of light frosts set in, without any rain or snow. This kept the\r\nground hard, but was not bitter enough to freeze it for even half an\r\ninch below the surface; the earth was not difficult to excavate, and\r\nit piled together well. A persistent north-east wind kept the trenches\r\nfairly dry, though it chilled the men who were not engaged in actual\r\nspade work to the very bones. The worst memory recorded in the diaries\r\nof many of the officers present in the siege is the constant necessity\r\nfor fording the Agueda in this cold time, when its banks were fringed\r\neach morning with thin ice. For the camps of all the divisions, except\r\nthe 3rd, which lay at Serradilla del Arroyo, some miles south-east of\r\nthe city, were on the left bank of the river, and the only bridge was\r\nso far off to the north that it was little used, the short cut across\r\nthe ford to the south of the town saving hours of time: ‘and as we were\r\nobliged to cross the river with water up to our middles, every man\r\ncarried a pair of iced breeches into the trenches with him[176].’ There\r\nbeing very few villages in the immediate neighbourhood of Rodrigo, many\r\nof the brigades had to bivouac on the open ground--life being only made\r\ntolerable by the keeping up of immense fires, round which the men spent\r\ntheir time when off duty, and slept at night. But for the troops in the\r\ntrenches there could be no such comfort: they shivered in their great\r\ncoats and blankets, and envied those of their comrades who did the\r\ndigging, which at any rate kept the blood circulating. It is said that\r\nseveral Portuguese sentries were found dead at their posts from cold\r\nand exhaustion each morning.\r\n\r\n  [175] Wellington to Liverpool, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 536, Jan.\r\n  7th, 1812, ‘I can scarcely venture to calculate the time that\r\n  this operation will take, but I should think not less than\r\n  twenty-four or twenty-five days.’\r\n\r\n  [176] Kincaid, _Adventures in the Rifle Brigade_, p. 104.\r\n\r\nWellington’s general plan was to follow the same line which Ney had\r\nadopted in 1810, i. e. to seize the Greater Teson hill, establish a\r\nfirst parallel there, and then sap down to the lower Little Teson,\r\non which the front parallel and the breaching batteries were to be\r\nestablished, at a distance of no more than 200 yards from the northern\r\n_enceinte_ of the city. But he had to commence with an operation which\r\nNey was spared--there was now on the crest of the Greater Teson the\r\nnew Redout Renaud, which had to be got rid of before the preliminary\r\npreparation could be made.\r\n\r\nThis little work was dealt with in the most drastic and summary way.\r\nOn the same evening on which the army crossed the Agueda and invested\r\nthe fortress, the Light Division was ordered to take the redoubt\r\nby escalade, without any preliminary battering. In the dark it was\r\ncalculated that the converging fires from the convent of San Francisco\r\nand the northern walls would be of little importance, since the French\r\ncould hardly shell the work at random during an assault, for fear of\r\nhitting their own men; and the attacking column would be covered by the\r\nnight till the very moment when it reached its goal.\r\n\r\nColonel Colborne led the storming-party, which consisted of 450 men,\r\ntwo companies from each British battalion, and one each from the 1st\r\nand 3rd Caçadores[177]. His arrangements have received well-deserved\r\npraise from every narrator of the enterprise. The column was conducted\r\nto within fifty yards of the redoubt without being discovered; then the\r\ntwo rifle companies and two of the 52nd doubled out to the crest of\r\nthe glacis, encircled the work on all sides, and, throwing themselves\r\non the ground, began a deliberate and accurate fire upon the heads of\r\nthe garrison, as they ran to the rampart, roused at last by the near\r\napproach of the stormers. So close and deadly was the fire of this\r\nring of trained marksmen, that after a few minutes the French shrank\r\nfrom the embrasures, and crouched behind their parapets, contenting\r\nthemselves with throwing a quantity of grenades and live shells at\r\nhaphazard into the ditch. Their three cannon were only fired once! Such\r\ncasual and ineffective opposition could not stop the veterans of the\r\nLight Division. For three companies of the 43rd and 52nd, forming the\r\nescalading detachment, came rushing up to the work, got into the ditch\r\nby descending the ladders which were provided for them, and then reared\r\nthem a second time against the fraises of the rampart, up which they\r\nscrambled without much difficulty, finding the scarp not too steep and\r\nwithout a _revêtement_. The garrison flinched at once--most of them\r\nran into their guard-house or crouched under the guns, and surrendered\r\ntamely. At the same time entrance was forced at another point, the\r\ngorge, where a company, guided by Gurwood of the 52nd, got in at the\r\ngate, which was either unlocked by some of the French trying to escape,\r\nor accidentally blown open by a live shell dropped against it[178]. Of\r\nthe garrison two captains and forty-eight rank and file were unwounded\r\nprisoners, three were killed, and about a dozen more wounded. No more\r\nthan four, it is said, succeeded in getting back into the town[179].\r\nThis sudden exploit only cost the stormers six men killed, and three\r\nofficers[180] and sixteen men wounded. Colborne remarks in his report\r\nthat all the losses were during the advance or in the ditch, not a man\r\nwas hurt in the actual escalade, for the enemy took cover and gave way,\r\ninstead of trying to meet the stormers with the bayonet.\r\n\r\n  [177] I take Colborne’s own account (see letter in his life by\r\n  Moore Smith, p. 166). There were two companies each from the\r\n  1/43rd, 1/52nd, 2/52nd, and 95th, and one from each Caçador\r\n  battalion. Jones wrongly says (p. 116) three companies of the\r\n  52nd only, Napier (as usual) omits all mention of the Portuguese.\r\n  Cf. Harry Smith’s _Autobiography_, i. p. 55.\r\n\r\n  [178] In Moorsom’s _History of the 52nd_ it is stated that a\r\n  sergeant of the French artillery, while in the act of throwing\r\n  a live shell, was shot dead: the shell fell back within the\r\n  parapet, and was kicked away by one of the garrison, on which it\r\n  rolled down into the gorge, was stopped by the gate, and then\r\n  exploded and blew it open (p. 152).\r\n\r\n  [179] So Belmas, iv. p. 266. Barrié’s report says that there were\r\n  60 infantry and 13 gunners inside altogether. It is an accurate\r\n  and very modest narrative, in which there is nothing to correct.\r\n\r\n  [180] Mein and Woodgate of the 52nd, and Hawkesley of the 95th.\r\n  The last named died of his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the redoubt was stormed, the French gunners in the city\r\nand the convent of San Francisco opened a furious fire upon it, hoping\r\nto make it untenable. But this did little harm, for Colborne withdrew\r\nthe stormers at once--and the important spot that night was no longer\r\nthe work but the ground behind it, which was left unsearched. For here,\r\nby Wellington’s orders, a first parallel 600 yards long was opened, and\r\napproaches to it along the top of the Teson were planned out. So little\r\nwas the digging hindered, that by dawn the trenches were everywhere\r\nthree feet deep and four broad, sites for three batteries had been\r\nmarked out, and a communication had been run from the parallel up to\r\nthe redoubt, whose rear wall was broken down into the ditch, so as to\r\nmake it easily accessible.\r\n\r\nIt had been calculated that if the assault had failed, the redoubt\r\ncould only have been reduced by regular battering for five days--that\r\namount of time, therefore, was saved by the escalade. The operation\r\ncontrasts singularly with the fruitless assaults on Fort San Cristobal\r\nat Badajoz during the summer months of the preceding year, to which\r\nit bore a considerable similarity. The difference of results may be\r\nattributed mainly to the superiority of the arrangements made by\r\nColborne, more especially to the great care that he took to keep down\r\nthe fire of the besieged by a very large body of marksmen pushed close\r\nup to the walls, and to the way in which he had instructed each officer\r\nin charge of a unit as to the exact task that was imposed on him.\r\nAt San Cristobal there had been much courage displayed, but little\r\nmanagement or intelligence in the command.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 9th, the first parallel, along the front\r\nof the Great Teson, was not so far advanced as to afford good cover,\r\nand the working parties were kept back till dark, and employed in\r\nperfecting the approaches from the rear: only fifty men were slipped\r\nforward into the dismantled Redout Renaud, to improve the lodgement\r\nthere. The garrison fired fiercely all day on the parallel, but as\r\nthere was little to shoot at, very small damage was done. At noon the\r\n1st Division relieved the Light Division at the front: for the rest of\r\nthe siege the arrangement was that each division took twenty-four hours\r\nat the front in turn, and then returned to its camp. The order of work\r\nwas:\r\n\r\nLight Division 8th-9th January, 12th-13th, 16th-17th, and for the storm\r\non the 19th.\r\n\r\n1st Division 9th-10th, 13th-14th, 17th-18th.\r\n\r\n4th Division 10th-11th, 14th-15th, 18th-19th.\r\n\r\n3rd Division 11th-12th, 15th-16th, and for the storm on the 19th.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Division had very responsible work on the second night of the\r\nsiege, for when darkness had set in the first parallel had to be made\r\ntenable, and the three batteries in front of it developed. Owing to\r\nthe very powerful artillery of the besieged, it was settled that the\r\nbatteries were to be made of exceptional strength and thickness--with\r\na parapet of no less than 18 feet breadth at the top. To procure the\r\nnecessary earth it was determined that an exterior ditch should be dug\r\nin front of them, and that their floor (_terre-plain_) should be sunk\r\n3 feet below the level of the hillside within. A row of large gabions\r\nwas placed in front of the exterior ditch to give cover to the men\r\ndigging it.\r\n\r\nGreat progress was made with the work under cover of the night, but\r\nwhen morning came the besieged, whose fire had been at haphazard during\r\nthe night, could see the works and commenced to shoot more accurately.\r\nA curious _contretemps_ was discovered at dawn. By some miscalculation\r\nthe locality of the left-hand battery had been laid out a little too\r\nfar to the east, so that half its front was blocked by the ruins of\r\nthe Redout Renaud. This, of course, was the effect of working in pitch\r\ndarkness, when the outline of that work was invisible even from a score\r\nor so of yards away. Possibly the error may have originated from the\r\nfact that, early in the night, the directing engineer officer, Captain\r\nRoss, was killed by a flanking shot from the convent of San Francisco.\r\nThus the men constructing the battery had been deprived of all superior\r\ndirection. In the morning Colonel Fletcher directed that the east end\r\nof the battery should have no guns; the five which should have been\r\nplaced there were to be transferred to the right-hand battery, which\r\nthus became designed for sixteen guns instead of eleven[181].\r\n\r\n  [181] This mistake is acknowledged in Jones’s _Sieges_,\r\n  i. p. 120, and much commented on by Burgoyne [_Life and\r\n  Correspondence_, i. p. 161], who complains that an immense amount\r\n  of work was wasted, two nights’ digging put in, the _terre-plain_\r\n  levelled, and even some platforms laid, before the error was\r\n  detected.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th-11th January, when the 4th Division had charge of the\r\ntrenches the first parallel was nearly completed, the batteries\r\ncontinued to be built up, magazine emplacements were constructed in\r\nthem, and a trench of communication between them was laid out. When\r\ndaylight revealed to the French the exact situation of the three\r\nbatteries, which were now showing quite clearly, a very fierce fire\r\nwas opened on them, the rest of the works being neglected. The losses,\r\nwhich had hitherto been insignificant, began to grow heavy, and so many\r\nmen were hit in the exterior trenches, which were being dug in front of\r\neach battery, that Wellington and Colonel Fletcher gave orders that\r\nthey should be discontinued. Heavy damage was done to the batteries\r\nthemselves--the French adopted a system of firing simultaneous flights\r\nof shells with long fuses at given points, ‘of which several falling\r\ntogether upon the parapets blew away in an instant the work of whole\r\nhours.’\r\n\r\nOn the 11th-12th, with the 3rd Division in charge, the work was\r\ncontinued; the platforms were placed in the batteries, and the\r\nsplinter-proof timbers laid over the magazine emplacements. But half\r\nthe exertion of the men had to be expended in repairs: as each section\r\nof the batteries was completed, part of it was ruined by the besiegers’\r\nshells. ‘The nights were long and bitter cold, and the men could not\r\ndecently be kept working for twelve hours on end[182],’ especially\r\nwhen it was considered that they had to march four or five miles from\r\ntheir camps to the trenches before commencing their task of digging, so\r\nthat they did not arrive fresh on the ground. Reliefs were therefore\r\narranged to exchange duty at one hour after midnight, so that no man\r\nwas at work for more than half of the cold hours of darkness.\r\n\r\n  [182] Burgoyne, i. p. 162.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th-13th, with the Light Division doing its second turn at\r\nthe front, the batteries were nearly completed, despite of much\r\nheart-breaking toil at repairs. Wellington, before starting the task\r\nof battering, put the problem to Colonel Fletcher as to whether it\r\nwould be possible to breach the walls with the batteries in the\r\nfirst parallel, or whether these would only be useful for subduing\r\nthe fire of the besieged, and the actual breaching would have to be\r\naccomplished by another set of batteries, to be placed in a second\r\nparallel which was, as yet, contemplated but not begun. Fletcher,\r\nafter some cogitation, replied that he thought it could be done,\r\nthough Ney, in the siege of 1810, had failed in such a project, and\r\nhad breached the walls with batteries in situations much farther\r\nforward. Wellington’s inquiry was dictated by his doubt as to whether\r\nMarmont and Dorsenne might not be in a position to appear with a heavy\r\nrelieving force, before a second parallel could be thrown up. There\r\nwere, as yet, no signs of such a danger; the enemy having apparently\r\nbeen taken completely unawares by the opening of the siege. But if\r\nthe second parallel advanced no faster in proportion than the first,\r\nand had to be built on much more dangerous ground, it was clear that\r\nthere was a risk of its taking an inordinate time to complete. On\r\nFletcher’s conclusion being made, Wellington decided that he would try\r\nto breach the walls with his original batteries, but would push forward\r\na second parallel also: if Marmont and Dorsenne showed signs of rapid\r\nconcentration, he would try to storm the place before the trenches were\r\npressed forward to the neighbourhood of the walls. If they did not, he\r\nwould proceed in more regular style, build a second and perhaps a third\r\nparallel, with batteries close to the _enceinte_, and end by blowing in\r\nthe counterscarp, and assaulting from close quarters.\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been formed, Wellington ordered the second\r\nparallel to be commenced on the night of the 13th-14th, with the 1st\r\nDivision in charge. Despite of a heavy fire from the French, who\r\ndiscovered (by throwing fire-balls) that men were at work in front of\r\nthe first parallel, an approach by flying sap was pushed out, from\r\nthe extreme right end of the original trenches, down the slope which\r\nseparates the Great from the Lesser Teson, and a short length of\r\nexcavation was made on the western end of the latter height, enough to\r\nallow of a small guard finding cover. This move brought the besiegers\r\nvery close to the fortified convent of Santa Cruz, outside the\r\nnorth-western walls of the city, and lest it should give trouble during\r\nthe succeeding operations Wellington ordered it to be stormed. The\r\ntroops employed were 300 volunteers from the Line brigade of the German\r\nLegion and one company of the 5/60th. They broke down the palisades\r\nof the convent with axes, under a heavy fire, and as they entered the\r\nsmall garrison fled with some loss. That of the stormers was 6 killed\r\nand 1 officer and 33 men wounded[183]. Only by clearing the French out\r\nof this post could the zig-zags leading down from the first to the\r\nsecond parallel be completed without paying a heavy price in lives,\r\nfor the musketry of the convent would have enfiladed them in several\r\nplaces. The same night the siege-guns, which had reached the camp on\r\nthe 11th, were moved into the three batteries.\r\n\r\n  [183] See Schwertfeger’s _History of the German Legion_, i. p.\r\n  353. Jones (_Sieges_, i. p. 125) is quite wrong in saying that\r\n  the convent was carried ‘with no loss.’\r\n\r\nNext day (January 14-15) was a very lively one. General Barrié was\r\nconvinced that the establishment of a second parallel on the Lesser\r\nTeson, only 200 yards from his walls, must not be allowed at any cost,\r\nand executed a sortie with 500 men, all that he could spare from the\r\ngarrison. He (very cleverly) chose for his time the hour (11 a.m.) when\r\nthe 4th Division was relieving the workmen of the First, for, as Jones\r\nremarks, ‘a bad custom prevailed that as soon as the division to be\r\nrelieved saw the relieving division advancing, the guards and workmen\r\nwere withdrawn from the trenches, and the works were left untenanted\r\nfor some time during the relief, which the French could observe from\r\nthe steeple of the cathedral, where there was always an officer on the\r\nlook-out.’\r\n\r\nThe sortie recaptured the convent of Santa Cruz, swept along the second\r\nparallel, where it upset the gabions and shovelled in some of the\r\nearth, and then made a dash at the first parallel, where it might have\r\ndone much mischief in the batteries if General Graham and the engineer\r\nofficer on duty had not collected a few belated workmen of the 24th\r\nand 42nd, who made a stand behind the parapet, and opened a fire which\r\nchecked the advance till the relieving division came running up from\r\nthe rear. The French then turned and retired with little loss into the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe advanced parallel and Santa Cruz were not reoccupied while daylight\r\nlasted, but at about 4.30 in the afternoon the three batteries opened\r\nwith the 27 guns, which had been placed in them. Two 18-pounders in the\r\nleft battery were directed against the convent of San Francisco, the\r\nrest against the northern part of the city, on the same point where\r\nNey’s breach had been made in 1810. Of the gunners, 430 in number,\r\nnearly 300 were Portuguese[184]. The fire opened so late in the day\r\nthat by the time that it was growing steady and accurate dusk fell, and\r\nit was impossible to judge what its future effect would be.\r\n\r\n  [184] See _Dickson Papers_, Jan. 1812.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the big guns were silent, the work of preparing for\r\nthe nearer approach was resumed after dark. The most important move\r\non the night of the 14th-15th was the storming of the convent of San\r\nFrancisco by three companies of the 40th regiment. The garrison made\r\nlittle resistance, and retired, abandoning three guns and two wounded\r\nmen. Immediately afterwards the posts in the neighbouring suburb were\r\nall withdrawn by Barrié, who considered that he could not afford to\r\nlose men from his small force in the defence of outlying works, when\r\nhis full strength was needed for the holding of the town itself.\r\nSanta Cruz, on the other side, though recovered in the morning, was\r\nabandoned on this same night for identical reasons. The French general\r\nwas probably wise, but it was a great profit to the besiegers to be\r\nrelieved from the flanking fire of both these convents, which would\r\nhave enfiladed the two ends of the second parallel. That work itself\r\nwas reoccupied under the cover of the night: the gabions upset during\r\nthe sortie of the morning were replaced, and much digging was done\r\nbehind them. The zig-zags of the approach from the upper trenches on\r\nthe Great Teson were deepened and improved. All this was accomplished\r\nunder a heavy fire from the guns on the northern walls, which were so\r\nclose to the second parallel that their shells, even in the dark, did\r\nconsiderable damage.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned on the 15th, the breaching batteries on the Great Teson\r\nopened again with excellent effect. Their fire was concentrated on\r\nthe rebuilt wall of the _enceinte_, where the French breach of 1810\r\nhad been mended. It was necessary to batter both the town wall proper\r\nand the _fausse-braye_ below it, so as to make, as it were, an upper\r\nand a lower breach, corresponding to each other, in the two stages of\r\nthe _enceinte_. It will be remembered that, as was explained in our\r\nnarrative of the French siege[185], the mediaeval ramparts of the old\r\nwall showed well above the eighteenth-century _fausse-braye_ which ran\r\naround and below them, while the latter was equally visible above the\r\nglacis, which, owing to the downward slope from the Little Teson, gave\r\nmuch less protection than was desirable to the work behind it. The\r\nFrench breach had been carefully built up; but, lime being scarce in\r\nthe neighbourhood, the mortar used in its repairs had been of inferior\r\nquality, little better than clay in many places. The stones, therefore,\r\nhad never set into a solid mass, even eighteen months after they had\r\nbeen laid, and began to fly freely under the continuous battering.\r\n\r\n  [185] See vol. iii. p. 239. The illustration of Rodrigo on the\r\n  morning after the storm, inserted to face page 186 of this\r\n  volume, shows the facts excellently.\r\n\r\nThe breaching being so successful from the first, Wellington resolved\r\nto hurry on his operations, though there were still no signs that\r\nMarmont or Dorsenne was about to attempt any relief of the garrison.\r\nYet it was certain that they must be on the move, and every day\r\nsaved would render the prospect of their interference less imminent.\r\nAccordingly it was settled that the second parallel should be\r\ncompleted, and that, if possible, more batteries should be placed in\r\nit, but that it was to be looked upon rather as the base from which\r\nan assault should be delivered than as the ground from which the main\r\npart of the breaching work was to be done. That was to be accomplished\r\nfrom the original parallel on the Great Teson, and one more battery\r\nwas marked out on this hill, close to the Redout Renaud, but a little\r\nlower down the slope, and slightly in advance of the three original\r\nbatteries. From this new structure, whose erection would have been\r\nimpossible so long as San Francisco was still held by the French,\r\nWellington proposed to batter a second weak point in the _enceinte_,\r\na mediaeval tower three hundred yards to the right of the original\r\nbreach. All the attention of the French being concentrated on the work\r\nin the second parallel, this new battery (No. 4) was easily completed\r\nand armed in three days, and was ready to open on its objective on\r\nJanuary 18th.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the completion of the second parallel proved a difficult\r\nand rather costly business. By Wellington’s special orders all the\r\nenergies of the British batteries were devoted to breaching, and no\r\nattempt was made to subdue the fire of those parts of the _enceinte_\r\nwhich bore upon the trenches, but were far from the points selected\r\nfor assault. Hence the French, undisturbed by any return, were able\r\nto shoot fast and furiously at the advanced works, and searched the\r\nsecond parallel from end to end. It was completed on the 18th, and\r\ntwo guns were brought down into a battery built on the highest point\r\nof the Little Teson, only 180 yards from the walls. An attempt to sap\r\nforward from the western end of the second parallel, so as to get a\r\nlodgement a little nearer to the place, was completely foiled by the\r\nincessant fire of grape kept up on the sap-head. After many workmen had\r\nbeen killed, the endeavour to push forward at this point was abandoned,\r\nsuch an advance forming no essential part of Wellington’s scheme. The\r\nenemy’s fire on the second parallel was made somewhat less effective\r\non the 16th-18th by digging rifle-pits in front of the parallel,\r\nfrom which picked marksmen kept up a carefully aimed fusillade on\r\nthe embrasures of the guns to left and right of the breach. Many\r\nartillerymen were shot through the head while serving their pieces, and\r\nthe discharges became less incessant and much less accurate. But the\r\nfire of the besieged was never subdued, and the riflemen in the pits\r\nsuffered very heavy casualties.\r\n\r\nThe 18th may be described as the crucial day of the siege. The new\r\nbattery (No. 4) on the Greater Teson opened that morning against the\r\ntower which had been chosen as its objective. By noon it was in a very\r\nruinous condition, and at dusk all its upper part fell forward ‘like\r\nan avalanche,’ as the governor says in his report, and covered all the\r\nplatform of the _fausse-braye_ below. Barrié remarks that this point\r\nwas admirably chosen by Wellington’s engineers, ‘it was unique in the\r\n_enceinte_ for the facilities which it offered for breaching and the\r\ndifficulties for defence. This is the spot where the walls are lowest,\r\nthe parapet thinnest, and the platforms both of the ramparts and the\r\n_fausse-braye_ narrowest. Moreover here had been situated the gun which\r\nbest flanked the original great breach[186].’\r\n\r\n  [186] See Barrié’s report in appendix to Belmas, iv. p. 299.\r\n\r\nThe garrison found it impossible either to repair the breaches or to\r\nclear away the débris which had fallen from them. All that could be\r\ndone was to commence retrenchments and inner defences behind them.\r\nThis was done with some effect at the great breach, where cuts were\r\nmade in the ramparts on each side of the demolished section, parapets\r\nthrown up behind the cuts, and two 24-pounders dragged into position to\r\nfire laterally into the lip of the easy slope of débris which trended\r\nup to the ruined wall. At the second or smaller breach much less was\r\naccomplished--the warning was short, for it had never been guessed that\r\nthis tower was to be battered, and the space upon which work could be\r\ndone was very limited. It was hoped that the narrowness of the gap\r\nmight be its protection--it was but a seam in the wall compared with\r\nthe gaping void at the first and greater breach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIUDAD RODRIGO]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th the fire was recommenced, with some little\r\nassistance from the two guns which had now begun to work from the\r\nadvanced battery in the second parallel. The breaches continued to\r\ncrumble: that at the tower looked as easy in slope (though not nearly\r\nso broad) as that at the original point of attack, and an incessant\r\nfire all day kept the enemy from making any repairs. No more could be\r\ndone for the breaches, wherefore Wellington ordered that some of the\r\nsiege-guns should turn their attention to silencing the French fire\r\nfrom the remoter points of the northern wall. Several of their guns\r\nwere dismounted: but even by dusk there were many still making reply.\r\n\r\nThere was now nothing to prevent the assault from being delivered,\r\nsince it had been settled that no attempt was to be made to sap up\r\nnearer the walls, or to blow in the counterscarp. Wellington wrote his\r\nelaborate directions for the storm sitting under cover in a trench of\r\none of the advanced approaches, to which he had descended in order to\r\nget the closest possible view of the fortress[187].\r\n\r\n  [187] Jones’s _Sieges_, i. p. 137.\r\n\r\nThe orders were as follows. The chosen time was seven o’clock, an hour\r\nsufficiently dark to allow the troops to get forward without being seen\r\nas they filled the trenches, yet soon enough after nightfall to prevent\r\nthe French from doing any appreciable repairs to the breaches under\r\ncover of the dark.\r\n\r\nThe main assaults were to be delivered by the 3rd Division on the great\r\nbreach, and by the Light Division on the lesser breach. There were also\r\nto be two false attacks delivered by small bodies of Portuguese troops,\r\nwith the purpose of distracting the attention of the besieged to points\r\nremote from the main assault: either of them might be turned into\r\nserious attempts at escalade if the circumstances favoured.\r\n\r\nThe two brigades of the 3rd Division were given two separate ways of\r\napproaching the main breach. Campbell’s brigade [2/5th, 77th, 2/83rd,\r\n94th], after detaching the 2/83rd to line the second parallel, and\r\nto keep up a continual fire on the walls, was to assemble behind the\r\nruined convent of Santa Cruz. Debouching from thence, the 2/5th,\r\nturning to the right, were to make for the place where the counterscarp\r\n(covering the whole north front) joined with the body of the place,\r\nunder the castle and not far from the river. They were to hew down the\r\ngate by which the ditch was entered, jump down into it, and from thence\r\nscale the _fausse-braye_ by ladders, of which a dozen, 25 feet long,\r\nwere issued to them. It was probable that there would be few French\r\nfound here, as the point was 500 yards west of the main breach. After\r\nestablishing themselves upon the _fausse-braye_, they were to scour it\r\neastward, clearing off any parties of the enemy that might be found\r\nupon it, and to push for the breach, where they would meet the main\r\nassaulting column. The 94th were to make a similar dash at the ditch,\r\nhalf-way between the point allotted to the 5th and the breach, but not\r\nto mount the _fausse-braye_: they were to move to their left along the\r\nbottom of the ditch, clearing away any palisades or other obstacles\r\nthat might be found in it, and finally to join the main column. The\r\n77th was to form the brigade-reserve, and support where necessary.\r\n\r\nMackinnon’s brigade was to undertake the frontal storm of the great\r\nbreach. Its three battalions (1/45th, 74th, 1/88th) were to be preceded\r\nby a detachment of 180 sappers carrying hay-bags, which were to be\r\nthrown into the ditch to make the leap down more easy. The head of the\r\ncolumn was to be formed by 300 volunteers from all the battalions, then\r\ncame the main body in their usual brigade order, the 1/45th leading.\r\nPower’s Portuguese (9th and 21st Line) formed the divisional reserve,\r\nand were to be brought down to the second parallel when Mackinnon’s\r\ncolumn had ascended the breach.\r\n\r\nA support on the left flank of the breach was to be provided by three\r\ncompanies of the 95th, detached from the Light Division, who, starting\r\nfrom beside the convent of San Francisco, were to carry out the same\r\nfunctions that were assigned to the 94th on the other side, viz. to\r\ndescend into the ditch half-way between the two breaches, and proceed\r\nalong its bottom, removing any obstacles found, till they joined\r\nMackinnon’s brigade at the foot of the wall.\r\n\r\nCraufurd, with the rest of the Light Division, which was to move\r\nfrom the left of San Francisco, was to make the attack on the\r\nlesser breach. The storming-column was to be formed of Vandeleur’s\r\nbrigade (1/52nd and 2/52nd, four companies of the 1/95th, and the 3rd\r\nCaçadores). Barnard’s brigade was to form the reserve, and to close in\r\ntowards the place when the leading brigade should reach the ditch. The\r\ndivision was to detach marksmen (four companies of the 95th) who were\r\nto keep up a fire upon the enemy on the walls, just as the 2/83rd did\r\nfor the 3rd Division. A provision of hay-bags carried by caçadores was\r\nmade, in the same fashion as at the great breach.\r\n\r\nThe two subsidiary false attacks were to be made--one by Pack’s\r\nPortuguese (1st and 16th regiments) on the outworks of the gate of\r\nSantiago on the south-east side of the town, the other by O’Toole’s\r\nPortuguese battalion (2nd Caçadores), headed by the light company of\r\nthe 2/83rd, on the outwork below the castle, close to the bank of the\r\nAgueda. This column would have to rush the bridge, which the French had\r\nleft unbroken, because it was completely commanded by the castle and\r\nother works immediately above it. Both the Portuguese columns carried\r\nladders, and were authorized to attempt an escalade, if they met little\r\nor no resistance at points so remote from the breaches, as was quite\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBoth the Light and 3rd Divisions were fresh troops that night, as\r\nthe 4th Division had been in charge of the trenches on the 19th.\r\nThe stormers marched straight up from their distant camps to the\r\nstarting-points assigned to them in the afternoon. The news that the\r\nLight Division had moved to the front out of its turn was the clearest\r\nindication to the whole army that the assault was fixed for that night.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before seven o’clock the storm began, by the sudden rush\r\nof the 2/5th, under Major Ridge, from behind the convent of Santa\r\nCruz, across the open ground towards the ditch on their left of the\r\ncastle. The governor had expected no attack from this side, the troops\r\non the walls were few, and it was only under a very scattering fire\r\nthat the battalion hewed down the gate in the palisades, got down into\r\nthe ditch, and then planted their ladders against the _fausse-braye_.\r\nThey were established upon it within five minutes of their start, and\r\nthen, turning to their left, drove along its platform, chasing before\r\nthem a few small parties of the enemy. In this way they soon arrived\r\nat the heap of ruins representing the spot where _fausse-braye_ and\r\ninner wall had been wellnigh battered into one common mass of débris.\r\nHere they found the 94th, who had entered the ditch at the same time\r\nas themselves, but a little to their left, and had met with equally\r\nfeeble resistance, already beginning to mount the lower slopes of the\r\nbreach. Thus by a curious chance these two subsidiary columns arrived\r\nat the crucial point a little before the forlorn hope of the main\r\nstorming-column. Mackinnon’s brigade, starting from the parallels, had\r\nto climb over the parapets of the trenches, and to cross rougher ground\r\nthan the 5th and 94th: they were also hindered by the tremendous fire\r\nopened upon them: all the attention of the French had been concentrated\r\non them from the first, as their route and their destination were\r\nobvious. Hence, unlike Campbell’s battalions, they suffered heavily\r\nbefore they crossed the glacis, and they were delayed a little by\r\nwaiting for the hay-bags which were to help their descent. When the\r\nstorming-party, under Major Manners of the 74th, reached the breach,\r\nit was already covered by men of the 5th and 94th. The whole, mixed\r\ntogether, scrambled up the higher part of the débris under a deadly\r\nfire, and reached the lip of the breach, where they found before them\r\na sixteen-foot drop into the level of the city, on to ground covered\r\nwith entanglements, beams, _chevaux de frise_, and other obstacles\r\naccumulated there by the prescience of the governor. On each flank, for\r\nthe whole breadth of the wall, was a cutting, surmounted by a parapet,\r\non which was mounted a 24-pounder firing grape downwards on to them.\r\n\r\nThe head of the column had scarcely gained the lip of the breach when\r\nit was raked by the simultaneous discharge of these two guns, which\r\nabsolutely exterminated the knot of men at its head. At the same time\r\nan explosion took place lower down, from some powder-bags which the\r\nenemy had left among the débris and fired by means of a train. The\r\nimpetus of the column was checked, and it was some little time before\r\nmore men fought their way up to the summit: a second discharge from the\r\ntwo flanking guns made havoc of these, and shut in by the cuts, upon a\r\nspace of about 100 feet wide, with the impracticable descent into the\r\ntown in front, the assailants came to a stand again. The only way out\r\nof the difficulty was to cross the cuts, and storm the parapets behind\r\nthem. This was done at both ends: on the one side a small party of the\r\n88th, throwing down their muskets, so as to have hands to climb with,\r\nscrambled over the gap and slew with their bayonets the gunners at the\r\nleft-hand gun, before they could fire a third round: they were followed\r\nby many men of the 5th, and a footing was gained on the ramparts behind\r\nthe obstacle[188]. On the right flank Major Wylde, the brigade-major of\r\nMackinnon’s brigade, found a few planks which the French had been using\r\nto bridge the cut before the storm, and which they had thrown down but\r\nneglected to remove. These were relaid in haste, and a mass of men\r\nof the 45th rushed across them under a dreadful fire, and forced the\r\nright-hand retrenchment. The garrison, giving way at both ends, fired a\r\nmine prepared under a postern of the upper wall as they retired[189].\r\nThis produced an explosion much more deadly than the one at the\r\ncommencement of the storm; it slew among others General Mackinnon, the\r\nsenior brigadier of the 3rd Division, whose body was found thrown some\r\ndistance away and much blackened with powder.\r\n\r\n  [188] For a lively account of this exploit see Grattan’s _With\r\n  the Connaught Rangers_, p. 154.\r\n\r\n  [189] Many narratives speak of General Mackinnon as being killed\r\n  by the first explosion, and others (including Wellington’s\r\n  dispatch) call the second explosion that of an expense magazine\r\n  fired by accident. Barrié’s report, however, settles the fact\r\n  that it was a regular mine: and for Mackinnon’s death _after_ the\r\n  storming of the cuts I follow the narrative by an eye-witness\r\n  appended at the end of the general’s diary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, even before the fighting at the great breach was over, the\r\nfate of Ciudad Rodrigo had been settled at another point. The storm\r\nof the lesser breach by the Light Division had been successful, after\r\na shorter fight and with much less loss of blood. Vandeleur’s brigade\r\nhere conducted the assault, headed by 300 volunteers from the three\r\nBritish regiments of the division under Major George Napier of the\r\n52nd: Lieutenant Gurwood of the same regiment had the forlorn hope of\r\n25 men. The column did not come under fire for some time after leaving\r\ncover, but the assault had been expected, and a keen watch was being\r\nkept. Nevertheless the ditch was reached without any great loss, and\r\nthe stormers leaped in, unaided for the most part by the hay-bags which\r\n150 of Elder’s caçadores were to have cast down for them, for the\r\ngreater part of the Portuguese were late in arriving[190]. They then\r\nbegan to plant their ladders, but the forlorn hope went wrong in an\r\nodd way, for moving too far to the left along the _fausse-braye_ they\r\nscrambled up and over a traverse[191] which had been built across it,\r\nso finding themselves still on the same level. The head of the main\r\nstorming party was better directed, and poured up the breach, which\r\nwas very narrow but clean and clear: the only obstacle at its head\r\nwas a disabled gun placed horizontally across the gap. Another piece,\r\nstill in working order, had a diagonal view of the whole slope. The\r\nfirst discharge of this gun, crammed with grape, shattered the head of\r\nthe column: Major Napier was dashed down with a mangled arm, Colonel\r\nColborne, who was leading the 52nd, got a ball in the shoulder, and\r\nseveral other officers fell. At about the same moment General Craufurd,\r\nwho was standing on the glacis above the ditch, directing the movements\r\nof the supports, received a bullet which passed through his arm, broke\r\ntwo ribs, and finally lodged in his spine. By his mortal hurt and the\r\nalmost simultaneous wounding of his senior brigadier, Vandeleur, the\r\ncommand of the Light Division passed to Andrew Barnard of the 95th, who\r\nwas leading the rear brigade.\r\n\r\n  [190] Several narrators accuse them of shirking, but Geo. Napier\r\n  writes (_Life_, p. 215), ‘Neither Elder nor his excellent\r\n  regiment were likely to neglect any duty, and I am sure the blame\r\n  rested elsewhere, for George Elder was always ready for any\r\n  service.’ Compare George Simmons’s autobiography--possibly he\r\n  put things out by ordering the Portuguese company to carry the\r\n  ladders, which he clearly was not authorized to do. [_A British\r\n  Rifleman_, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n  [191] Some narrators say a low ravelin, but the best authority is\r\n  in favour of its having been a traverse.\r\n\r\nBut the division had been started on its way up the breach, and the\r\ngun on its flank got no second opportunity to fire. After its first\r\ndischarge the survivors at the head of the column, now led by Uniacke\r\nand W. Johnston both of the 95th, dashed furiously up the remaining\r\nfew feet of débris and reached the summit. The voltigeurs facing them\r\nbroke before the onset, and since there were here no traverses or cuts\r\nto prevent the extension of the troops to right or left as they reached\r\ntheir goal, many hundreds were soon in possession of the ramparts\r\non each side of the breach. The men of the 52nd wheeled to the left\r\nand swept the ramparts as far as the Salamanca gate, which they found\r\nwalled up: the 43rd and Rifles turned to the right, and came upon the\r\nFrench retreating from the great breach, where the 3rd Division were\r\njust bursting through. Some of them arrived just in time to suffer\r\nfrom the final explosion which killed Mackinnon and so many of his\r\nbrigade[192].\r\n\r\n  [192] The point has often been raised as to whether it was not\r\n  the success of the Light Division at the lesser breach which\r\n  enabled the 3rd Division to break through at the greater. Some\r\n  Light Division diarists (e.g. Harry Smith) actually state that\r\n  it was their attack on the rear of the defenders which made them\r\n  flinch from a position which they had hitherto maintained. I\r\n  think that the case is decided in favour of the 3rd Division by\r\n  Belmas’s statement that the French fired the mine at the great\r\n  breach only when the 3rd Division had got through, combined with\r\n  the fact that the leading men of the Light Division reached\r\n  the back of the great breach just in time to suffer from the\r\n  explosion, which killed Captain Uniacke of the 95th and a few\r\n  others. Apparently, therefore, the breach was forced before the\r\n  head of the Light Division stormers had come up, but only just\r\n  before.\r\n\r\nWith their line forced in two places simultaneously, the garrison could\r\ndo no more: there was a little fighting in the streets, but not much.\r\nThe majority of the garrison retired to the Plaza Mayor in front of the\r\ncastle, and there laid down their arms in mass. At the same time the\r\ntwo Portuguese subsidiary attacks had succeeded. O’Toole’s caçadores,\r\nheaded by the light company of the 2/83rd, had not only captured by\r\nescalade the outwork against which they were directed, but found and\r\nhewed down its sally-port by which they got entrance into the town.\r\nPack’s brigade, on the other side of the place, stormed the redan in\r\nfront of the Santiago gate, and lodged themselves therein, capturing\r\nits small garrison. The governor and his staff had taken refuge in\r\nthe castle, a mediaeval building with a lofty square tower commanding\r\nthe Agueda bridge. They had hardly any men with them, and wisely\r\nsurrendered at the first summons[193].\r\n\r\n  [193] There is considerable controversy as to what officer\r\n  received Barrié’s surrender. For the Gurwood-Mackie dispute see\r\n  note in Appendix.\r\n\r\nSeven thousand excited and victorious soldiers, with all traces of\r\nregimental organization lost, were now scattered through the streets\r\nof Ciudad Rodrigo. This was the first time on which the Peninsular\r\nArmy had taken a place by assault, and the consequent confusion does\r\nnot seem to have been foreseen by any one. But while the officers\r\nand the steady men were busy in collecting the French prisoners,\r\nthrowing open the gates, and seeing to the transport of the wounded\r\ninto houses, the baser spirits--and in every battalion, as Sir John\r\nColborne remarks[194], there were in those days from fifty to a\r\nhundred incorrigibles--turned to plunder. The first rush was to the\r\ncentral brandy-store of the garrison, where hundreds got drunk in a\r\nfew minutes, and several killed themselves by gorging raw spirits\r\nwholesale. But while the mere drunkards proceeded to swill, and\r\nthen turned out into the streets firing objectlessly in the air,\r\nthe calculating rascals set themselves to the plunder of private\r\nhouses, which was a more profitable task than rummaging the French\r\nmagazines. There was an immense amount of unlicensed pillage and\r\nwanton destruction of property--inexcusable in a place where only a\r\nsmall minority of the people were _Afrancesados_, and the majority\r\nhad been getting ready to welcome their deliverers. The officers did\r\ntheir best to restore order, ‘the voice of Sir Thomas Picton was\r\nheard with the strength of twenty trumpets proclaiming damnation\r\nto all and sundry, while Colonels Barnard and Cameron with other\r\nactive officers, seized the broken barrels of muskets, which were\r\nlying about in great abundance, and belaboured misdemeanants most\r\nunmercifully[195].’ But active officers could not be everywhere--three\r\nhouses, including the spirit store in the great square, were set on\r\nfire by drunken plunderers, and it was feared that a conflagration\r\nmight arise, which fortunately did not happen, for the solid stone\r\nstructures were not easily kindled. The disorder, however, did not\r\nreach the shameful pitch which was afterwards seen at Badajoz and St.\r\nSebastian. A competent observer, present at all three sacks, remarks\r\nthat ‘no town taken by assault suffered less than Rodrigo. It is true\r\nthat soldiers of all regiments got drunk, pillaged, and made great\r\nnoise and confusion in streets and houses, despite of every exertion of\r\ntheir officers to prevent it. But bad and revolting as such scenes are,\r\nI never heard that either the French garrison, after its surrender,\r\nor the inhabitants suffered personal indignities or cruelty from the\r\ntroops[196].’ There were apparently no lives lost, except those of a\r\nfew men shot accidentally by their drunken comrades, and of certain\r\ndrunkards who perished in the spirit store. The greater part of the\r\nmen were under control long before dawn, and were collected by their\r\nofficers on the ramparts: they marched out next morning, when the 5th\r\nDivision, newly arrived at the front from its distant cantonments in\r\nBeira, came into the town. By an unfortunate accident an explosion\r\nof an unsuspected magazine took place, just as the French prisoners\r\nwere being marched out, and some of them and of their escort were\r\nkilled[197]. The storming regiments made a strange spectacle as they\r\nleft the town. ‘As we marched over the bridge dressed in all varieties\r\nimaginable, some with jack-boots on, others with white French trousers,\r\nothers in frock-coats with epaulettes, some even with monkeys on their\r\nshoulders, we met the 5th Division on their way to repair the breaches.\r\nThey immediately formed upon the left of the road, presented arms, and\r\ncheered us. I was afterwards told that Lord Wellington, who saw us\r\npass, inquired of his staff, “Who the devil are _those_ fellows[198]?”’\r\n\r\n  [194] See his _Life and Letters_, p. 396.\r\n\r\n  [195] Kincaid, _Adventures in the Rifle Brigade_, p. 117.\r\n\r\n  [196] Leach’s _Sketches in the Life of an Old Soldier_, p. 250.\r\n  For an amusing story about a plundering Connaught Ranger who came\r\n  down a chimney, see Grattan, p. 162. He tried to propitiate the\r\n  officer who found him by presenting him with a case of surgical\r\n  instruments. Kincaid speaks of worse than plunder--armed violence\r\n  and some cases of rape.\r\n\r\n  [197] So Napier and most other authorities. John Jones, however,\r\n  says that the explosion was not accidental, but deliberate--some\r\n  English deserters had hidden themselves in a small magazine\r\n  under the rampart. ‘These desperate men, on seeing an officer\r\n  approach, deeming discovery and capture inevitable, and assured\r\n  that an ignominious death would follow, blew themselves up in\r\n  the magazine. The explosion first found vent through the door,\r\n  and shot the refugees up into the street, some alive, but so\r\n  mutilated, blackened, and distorted, as to be painful to behold.’\r\n\r\n  [198] Costello (a Light Division narrator), pp. 151-2.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, out of a little under 2,000 men present when the siege\r\nbegan, showed 60 officers and 1,300 rank and file of unwounded\r\nprisoners. Eight officers had been killed, 21 wounded, and about 500\r\nrank and file, mostly on the day of the assault. The artillery and\r\nengineers suffered most--of 8 artillery officers in the place 5 were\r\nkilled or wounded, of three engineer officers two fell.\r\n\r\nThe British and Portuguese loss during the whole siege was 9 officers\r\nkilled and 70 wounded, and of other ranks 186 were killed and 846\r\nwounded, with 10 missing--apparently deserters. Of these, 59 officers\r\nand 503 rank and file fell in the actual storm. The tables appended at\r\nthe end of this volume demonstrate that the 3rd Division suffered far\r\nmore heavily than the Light--the battalions with the greatest losses\r\nwere the 2/5th and 94th, which were early on the great breach and got\r\nthe benefit of the explosion. Of the 9 officers killed or mortally hurt\r\ntwo were generals, Craufurd and Mackinnon. The death of the former,\r\nwho lingered in great agony for four days, though shot through to the\r\nspine, was no small event in the war: his talents were sadly missed in\r\nits latter years: an outpost officer of his capacity would have been\r\ninvaluable to Wellington during the fighting in the Pyrenees in 1813,\r\nwhen the Light Division, though regimentally as good as ever, much\r\nlacked the skilful leading of its old chief. He was a man with many\r\nfriends and many enemies: of his merits and defects I spoke at length\r\nin another place[199]. Here I feel compelled to quote nothing more than\r\nthe words of his friend, Lord Londonderry--the Charles Stewart of the\r\nPeninsular War. ‘He was an officer of whom the highest expectation had\r\nbeen formed, and who on every occasion found an opportunity to prove\r\nthat, had his life been spared, the proudest hopes of his country\r\nwould not have been disappointed, and he was a man to know whom in\r\nhis profession without admiring him was impossible. To me his death\r\noccasioned that void which the removal of a sincere friend alone\r\nproduces. While the memory of the brave and the skilful shall continue\r\nto be cherished by British soldiers, he will not be forgotten, and the\r\nhand which scrawls this humble tribute to his worth must be cold as his\r\nown, before the mind which dictates it shall cease to think of him with\r\naffection and regret[200].’\r\n\r\n  [199] See vol. iii. pp. 233-7.\r\n\r\n  [200] Londonderry’s _Peninsular War_, ii. p. 268.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIUDAD RODRIGO ON THE MORNING AFTER THE STORM FROM THE\r\nADVANCED BATTERY ON THE LESSER TESON\r\n\r\n(A contemporary sketch.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL OF CIUDAD RODRIGO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary speed with which Wellington had in twelve days\r\nreduced Ciudad Rodrigo, a fortress that had held out for twenty-four\r\ndays of open trenches when besieged by Ney in 1810, surprised the\r\ncaptor himself, who had reckoned on taking no shorter time in its\r\nleaguer than had the French. But it absolutely appalled his two\r\nadversaries, Marmont and Dorsenne, whose whole scheme of operations had\r\nrested on the idea that they could count on some three weeks or more\r\nfor preparation, when the news that the place was invested got to their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThiébault, the governor of Salamanca, had been warning both the\r\ncommander of the Army of the North and the commander of the Army of\r\nPortugal for some weeks that Wellington might move at any moment[201].\r\nBut his reports to the effect that the British were making gabions\r\nand fascines, preparing a bridge over the Agueda, and bringing up\r\nsiege-guns to Almeida, made little or no impression on his superiors,\r\nbecause they had come to the conclusion that it was unlikely that\r\nWellington would undertake a siege at midwinter. His preparations, they\r\nthought, were probably intended to force his enemies to concentrate, at\r\na time when roads were bad and food unprocurable: ‘ils n’ont d’autre\r\nbut que de nous faire faire de faux mouvements,’ said one of Marmont’s\r\naides-de-camp. It was only in the spring that the allied army would\r\nbecome really enterprising and dangerous.\r\n\r\n  [201] See Thiébault’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 551-2. Extracts from\r\n  two of his letters are printed in Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp.\r\n  280-1, and bear out all that he says in his own book.\r\n\r\nAstonishing as it may appear, though Wellington’s troops started on\r\nJanuary 2nd, and though Rodrigo was invested and the Redout Renaud\r\nstormed on January 8th, the definitive news that the siege had\r\nactually begun only reached Salamanca on January 13th. No better proof\r\ncould be given of the precarious nature of the French hold on the\r\nkingdom of Leon. The fact was that the guerrilleros of Julian Sanchez\r\nso obsessed all the roads from Salamanca to Rodrigo, that no messenger\r\ncould pass without a very large escort. Barrié only got the news that\r\nhe was attacked to Thiébault by entrusting it to a Spanish emissary,\r\nwho carried his note in disguise, and by a long détour. Marmont and\r\nDorsenne only received it on the 14th: King Joseph at Madrid only on\r\nthe 25th. On the 13th Marmont was in such a state of blindness as to\r\nthe actual situation that he was writing to Berthier that ‘si l’armée\r\nanglaise passait l’Agueda j’attendrais sur la Tormès la division du\r\nTage et les troupes que le Général Dorsenne pourrait m’amener, _mais\r\nsans doute ce cas n’arrivera pas_. Ciudad Rodrigo sera approvisionné\r\njusqu’à la récolte, et à moins d’un siège il ne doit pas être l’objet\r\nd’aucune sollicitude[202].’ Wellington, when this was written, had\r\nalready passed troops over the Agueda some ten days back, and had been\r\nbeleaguering Ciudad Rodrigo for five. Yet Marmont was dating from\r\nValladolid, which was not much over 100 miles from the hard-pressed\r\nfortress. Truly, thanks to the guerrilleros, the ‘fog of war’ was lying\r\nheavily round the Marshal.\r\n\r\n  [202] Marmont to Berthier, Valladolid, Jan. 13, 1812.\r\n\r\nOwing to a circumstance of which Wellington could have no knowledge,\r\nthe moment which he chose for his advance was even more propitious than\r\nhe guessed. He knew of the march of Montbrun towards Valencia, and had\r\nmade it the determining factor in his operations. But he was not, and\r\ncould not be, aware of another fact of high importance. On December\r\n29th Marmont, then at Talavera, had received a dispatch from Paris,\r\ndated on the 13th of the same month, informing him that the Emperor\r\nhad resolved on making a sweeping change with regard to the respective\r\nduties and stations of the Armies of the North and of Portugal.\r\nHitherto Dorsenne had been in charge of the whole kingdom of Leon: the\r\ntroops stationed in it belonged to his army, and on him depended the\r\ngarrisons of Ciudad Rodrigo, Astorga, and its other fortresses. He was,\r\ntherefore, responsible for the keeping back of Wellington from all the\r\nground north of the Sierra de Gata. Marmont, with his Army of Portugal,\r\nhad to ‘contain’ the Anglo-Portuguese army south of that range, and had\r\ncharge of the valley of the Tagus--northern Estremadura and those parts\r\nof New Castile which had been taken away from King Joseph’s direct\r\ncontrol. From this central position the Duke of Ragusa had hitherto\r\nbeen supposed to be able to stretch out a hand to Dorsenne, in case of\r\nWellington’s making a move in the valley of the Douro, to Soult in case\r\nof his showing himself opposite Badajoz. This indeed Marmont had done:\r\nhe had brought up his army to Dorsenne’s aid in September, at the time\r\nof El Bodon and Aldea da Ponte: he had carried it down to the Guadiana\r\nand assisted Soult to relieve Badajoz in June.\r\n\r\nBerthier’s dispatch[203], received on December 29th--it had taken\r\nsixteen days to reach its destination--informed Marmont that the\r\nEmperor had resolved to place the task of ‘containing’ Wellington, when\r\nhe should operate north of the Tagus, in the hands of one instead of\r\ntwo commanders-in-chief. ‘Considering the importance of placing the\r\ncommand on the whole frontier of Portugal under a single general, His\r\nMajesty has decided that the provinces of Avila, Salamanca, Plasencia,\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, the kingdom of Leon, Palencia, and the Asturias, shall\r\nbelong to the Army of Portugal.’ Along with them were to be handed\r\nover to Marmont Souham’s division, then lying in the direction of\r\nZamora, Benavente, and La Baneza, and Bonnet’s division, then in the\r\nAsturias--whose central parts (as it will be remembered[204]) that\r\ngeneral had reconquered in November 1811. The district of the Army of\r\nthe North was for the future to be limited to the eastern parts of\r\nOld Castile, Santander, Biscay, and Navarre. The real cause of this\r\nchange, though Berthier’s dispatch lays no stress upon it, was the\r\norder recently sent to Dorsenne, which bade him return to France the\r\ntwo strong divisions of the Imperial Guard, which had hitherto formed\r\nthe most important and effective section of the Army of the North. They\r\nwere wanted for the probable Russian war, and without them Napoleon\r\nrightly judged that Dorsenne would be too weak to ‘contain’ Wellington,\r\nhold down all Leon, and observe the Galicians, in addition to hunting\r\nMina and curbing the incursions of Longa and Porlier. Wherefore he\r\nresolved to confine the activity of the Army of the North to the lands\r\neast and north of Burgos, where its main task would be the crushing of\r\nMina and his compatriots. Marmont should take upon his shoulders the\r\nentire responsibility for holding back the Anglo-Portuguese.\r\n\r\n  [203] Printed in full in Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 271-6.\r\n\r\n  [204] See vol. iv. p. 586.\r\n\r\nBut, by the Emperor’s orders, the Army of Portugal, though now charged\r\nwith a much heavier task than before, was not to get any appreciable\r\nincrease in numbers. It is true that Marmont was to take over the\r\ndivisions of Souham and Bonnet, along with the regions that they were\r\noccupying. These were strong units, and would have increased his\r\ntotal strength by 16,000 men. But at the same time he was told that\r\nThiébault’s division[205], the other force in the kingdom of Leon, was\r\nnot to be given him, but to be withdrawn eastward and to remain under\r\nDorsenne. With it were to go other details belonging to the Army of\r\nthe North, employed in garrison duty in the valley of the Douro, such\r\nas the Swiss battalions long garrisoning the city of Leon, Benavente,\r\nand Valladolid[206]. Now it was clear that if these garrisons were\r\nwithdrawn, Marmont would have to find other troops from his own\r\ndivisions to replace them. Moreover, he was in addition instructed that\r\nBonnet’s division, though now to be regarded as under his command, was\r\nnot on any excuse to be moved out of the Asturias. ‘It is indispensable\r\nthat he should remain there, because in that position he menaces\r\nGalicia, and keeps down the people of the mountains. You would have to\r\nuse more troops to guard all the edge of the plain from Leon to St.\r\nSebastian than are required for the Asturias. It is demonstrable in\r\ntheory, and clearly proved by experience, that of all operations the\r\nmost important is the occupation of the Asturias, which makes the right\r\nof the army rest upon the sea, and continually threatens Galicia.’\r\n\r\n  [205] 34th Léger, 113th Line, 4th Vistula, Neuchâtel.\r\n\r\n  [206] Also two cavalry regiments, the 1st Hussars and 31st\r\n  Chasseurs.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, Marmont was forbidden to use Bonnet, and had to replace\r\nall the existing garrisons of Leon (including that of Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nas he was specially informed) by troops drawn from his own force, he\r\nwas given a vast increase of territory to watch, but no appreciable\r\nincrease of numbers to hold it--no more in fact than the difference\r\nbetween the strength of Souham’s division (placed on the side of gain)\r\nand that of the new garrisons (placed on the side of loss). The net\r\nprofit would be no more than 3,000 or 4,000 men at the most.\r\n\r\nIn addition the Marshal was restricted further as to the way in which\r\nhe was to dispose of his army. He was told to leave one division (or,\r\nif he chose, two) in the valley of the Tagus, about Plasencia and\r\nAlmaraz, for the purpose of keeping up his communication with Madrid\r\nand Andalusia. The rest of his army was to be moved across the Sierra\r\nde Gata into the valley of the Douro, and its head-quarters were to\r\nbe placed at Valladolid, or if possible at Salamanca. Therefore,\r\nif Wellington advanced, only four and a half, or five and a half,\r\ndivisions out of the eight now comprising the Army of Portugal, could\r\nbe concentrated against him with promptitude: Bonnet and the troops\r\nleft in the Tagus valley would be long in arriving. So would the\r\nnearest divisions of the Army of the North, of which the most westerly\r\nwould be as far off as Burgos, the rest still farther towards the\r\nPyrenees. Till he had received some of these outlying succours, Marmont\r\nwould be too weak to resist Wellington. Five divisions (say 30,000 men)\r\ncould not keep the Anglo-Portuguese contained--though eight might very\r\npossibly suffice.\r\n\r\nBut on December 29, 1811, Marmont had not eight divisions at his\r\ndisposition. The Emperor’s misguided order for the Valencian expedition\r\nwas in progress of being executed, and it was precisely on that same\r\nday that Montbrun with two divisions of foot and one of horse was\r\nmarching off eastward from La Mancha, in an excentric direction, which\r\ntook him to the shore of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMarmont’s available force, after this march began, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Souham’s division at La Baneza, Benavente, and Zamora,\r\n  watching Abadia’s Army of Galicia. This unit had yet to be\r\n  informed that it had become part of the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\n  (2-3) Brennier’s and Maucune’s divisions at Almaraz and Talavera\r\n  in the valley of the Tagus.\r\n\r\n  (4) Clausel’s division at Avila.\r\n\r\n  (5) Ferey’s division in La Mancha, keeping up communication with\r\n  Montbrun’s expeditionary column.\r\n\r\nThe other three divisions of the Army of Portugal, as now constituted,\r\nthose of Bonnet in the Asturias, and of Foy and Sarrut in march for\r\nValencia, were hopelessly out of reach.\r\n\r\nBeing directed, in very clear and decisive terms, to transfer himself\r\nin person to Valladolid or Salamanca, and to move the bulk of his\r\ntroops thither from the valley of the Tagus, the Marshal had to obey.\r\nHe directed Brennier’s division alone to remain behind at Almaraz and\r\nTalavera. Maucune and Clausel, with Ferey presently to follow, began\r\na toilsome march across the mountains to Leon. They had to abandon\r\nthe magazines (such as they were) which had been collected for their\r\nsubsistence in winter-quarters, and to march across bad roads, in the\r\nmost inclement month of the year, through an unpeopled country, for\r\ncantonments where no stores were ready for them.\r\n\r\nWhile Marmont was marching up in the early days of January to occupy\r\nhis newly-designated positions, Dorsenne was employed in withdrawing\r\nhis troops eastward, away from the neighbourhood of Wellington, towards\r\nthe province of Burgos. He himself stopped behind at Valladolid, to see\r\nMarmont and hand over in person the charge of the districts which he\r\nwas ordered to evacuate. His view of the situation at the moment may\r\nbe judged by an extract from a letter which he directed to Marmont on\r\nJanuary 5[207].\r\n\r\n  [207] Marmont, _Correspondance_, book xv _bis_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n‘I have the honour to enclose herewith two letters dated on the 1st and\r\n3rd instant from General Thiébault at Salamanca. I attach no credence\r\nto their contents, for during the last six months I have been receiving\r\nperpetually similar reports.... If, contrary to my opinion, the English\r\nhave really made some tentative movements on Ciudad Rodrigo, and if\r\nJulian Sanchez has tried to cut our communication with that place, I\r\ncan only attribute it to your recent movement on Valencia. In that\r\ncase, the unforeseen reappearance of your Excellency here may make the\r\nenemy change his plan of operations, and may prove harmful to him.’\r\n\r\nThiébault had cried ‘Wolf!’ too often to please Dorsenne, and the\r\nlatter had no real apprehension that Wellington was already on the\r\nmove. No more had Marmont. On arriving at Valladolid on January 13th\r\nhe wrote to Berthier (five days after the trenches were opened at\r\nRodrigo!), ‘It is probable that the English may be on the move at the\r\nend of February, and then I shall have need of all my troops: I have,\r\ntherefore, told Montbrun to start on his backward march towards me\r\nbefore the end of January[208].’ By the end of January Rodrigo had\r\nalready been for twelve days in the hands of the British army.\r\n\r\n  [208] Ibid., p. 291.\r\n\r\nAnd if Dorsenne and Marmont were blind to the actual situation, so,\r\nmost of all, was their master. The dispatch which gave over the charge\r\nof the kingdom of Leon to Marmont contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n‘If General Wellington (_sic_) after the rainy season is over (i.\r\ne. after February) should determine to take the offensive, you\r\ncan then unite all your eight divisions for a battle: General\r\nDorsenne from Burgos would support you, by marching up from Burgos\r\nto your assistance. But such a move is not to be expected (_n’est\r\npas présumable_). The English, having suffered heavy losses, and\r\nexperiencing great difficulties in recruiting their army, all\r\nconsiderations tend to make us suppose that they will simply confine\r\nthemselves to the defence of Portugal.... Your various dispatches\r\nseem to prove that it is at present no longer possible for us to take\r\nthe offensive against Portugal, Badajoz being barely provisioned, and\r\nSalamanca having no magazines. It is necessary, therefore, to wait till\r\nthe crops of the present year are ripe [June!], and till the clouds\r\nwhich now darken the political situation to the North have disappeared.\r\nHis Majesty has no doubt that you will profit by the delay, to organize\r\nand administer the provinces under your control with justice and\r\nintegrity, and to form large magazines.... The conquest of Portugal and\r\nthe immortal glory of defeating the English are reserved for you. Use\r\ntherefore all possible means to get yourselves into good condition for\r\ncommencing this campaign, when circumstances permit that the order for\r\nit should be given.... Suggestions have been made that Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nshould be dismantled. The Emperor considers that this would be a great\r\nmistake: the enemy, establishing himself in that position, would be\r\nable to intercept the communications between Salamanca and Plasencia,\r\nand that would be deplorable. The English know quite well that if they\r\npress in upon Rodrigo, or invest it, they expose themselves to be\r\nforced to deliver a battle--that is the last thing they want: however,\r\nif they did so expose themselves, it would be your duty to assemble\r\nyour whole army and march straight at them[209].’\r\n\r\n  [209] Berthier to Marmont, Dec. 13, as above.\r\n\r\nSuch being Napoleon’s views at midwinter, it is strange to find\r\nNapier asserting that the disasters of the French at this time were\r\ncaused partly by the jealousies of his lieutenants, partly by their\r\nfailing to understand his orders in their true spirit, so that they\r\nneglected them, or executed them without vigour[210]. Without denying\r\nthat Marmont, Dorsenne, and Soult were jealous of each other, we may\r\nassert that the real fundamental origin of all their disasters was that\r\ntheir master persisted in directing the details of the war from Paris,\r\nfounding his orders on data three weeks old, and sending those orders\r\nto arrive another fortnight or three weeks after they had been written.\r\nAs a fair example of what was perpetually happening we may cite the\r\nfollowing dates. Wellington started to move on January 1st, 1812, as\r\nThiébault wrote to Dorsenne (on the report of a Spanish spy) on January\r\n3rd: on January 27 the general information that the Anglo-Portuguese\r\narmy had crossed the Agueda, without any details, reached the Emperor,\r\nand caused him to dictate a dispatch for Dorsenne, giving him leave to\r\ndetain the two divisions of the Imperial Guard under orders for France,\r\nand to support Marmont with them: the Emperor added that he hoped that\r\nby January 18th Montbrun would be nearing Madrid, and that by the end\r\nof the month his column would have joined the Army of Portugal. Eight\r\ndays _before_ this dispatch was written Ciudad Rodrigo was already in\r\nWellington’s hands: the news of its fall on January 19th seems to have\r\nreached Paris on February 11th[211], whereupon, as we shall presently\r\nsee, the Emperor dictated another dispatch to Marmont, giving elaborate\r\ninstructions on the new condition of affairs. This (travelling quicker\r\nthan most correspondence) reached Marmont at Valladolid on February\r\n26[212]: but of what use to the Marshal on that day were orders\r\ndictated upon the basis of the state of affairs in Leon on January\r\n19th? ‘On ne dirige pas la guerre à trois ou quatre cents lieues de\r\ndistance,’ as Thiébault very truly observed[213].\r\n\r\n  [210] _Peninsular War_, iv. p. 134.\r\n\r\n  [211] Correspondence in King Joseph’s _Letters_, viii. pp. 306-7.\r\n\r\n  [212] See Marmont’s letter acknowledging its receipt in his\r\n  _Correspondance_, iv. pp. 342-3.\r\n\r\n  [213] _Mémoires_, iv. p. 554.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely Napoleon’s determination to dictate such operations\r\nas Montbrun’s Alicante expedition, or the transference of Marmont’s\r\nhead-quarters from the valley of the Tagus to Valladolid, without any\r\npossible knowledge of the circumstances of his lieutenants at the\r\nmoment when his orders would come to hand, that was the fatal thing.\r\nWith wireless telegraphy in the modern style he might have received\r\nprompt intelligence, and sent directions that suited the situation. But\r\nunder the conditions of Spain in 1812 such a system was pure madness.\r\n\r\n‘The Emperor chose,’ as Marmont very truly observes, ‘to cut down\r\nthe numbers of his troops in Spain [by withdrawing the Guards and\r\nPoles] and to order a grand movement which dislocated them for a time,\r\nprecisely at the instant when he had increased the dispersion of\r\nthe Army of Portugal, by sending a detachment of 12,000 men against\r\nValencia. He was undoubtedly aware that the English army was cantoned\r\nin a fairly concentrated position on the Agueda, the Coa, and the\r\nMondego. But he had made up his mind--I cannot make out why--that the\r\nEnglish were not in a condition to take the field: in every dispatch\r\nhe repeated this statement.’ In fairness to his master, Marmont should\r\nhave added that he was of the same opinion himself, that Dorsenne\r\nshared it, and that both of them agreed to treat the Cassandra-like\r\nprophecies which Thiébault kept sending from Salamanca as ‘wild and\r\nwhirling words.’\r\n\r\nMarmont reached Valladolid, marching ahead of the divisions of Clausel\r\nand Maucune, on the 11th or 12th of January. He found Dorsenne waiting\r\nfor him, and they proceeded to concert measures for the exchange of\r\nterritory and troops which the Emperor had imposed upon them. After\r\ndinner on the evening of the 14th arrived Thiébault’s definite and\r\nstartling news that Wellington, with at least five divisions in\r\nhand, had invested Rodrigo on the 8th, and was bringing up a heavy\r\nbattering-train. The siege had already been six days in progress.\r\n\r\nThis was very alarming intelligence. The only troops actually in hand\r\nfor the relief of Rodrigo were Thiébault’s small division at Salamanca,\r\nSouham’s much larger division about La Baneza and Benavente, and\r\nClausel’s and Maucune’s divisions, now approaching Valladolid from the\r\nside of Avila. The whole did not make much more than 20,000 men, a\r\nforce obviously insufficient to attack Wellington, if he were in such\r\nstrength as Thiébault reported. Dorsenne at once sent for Roguet’s\r\ndivision of the Imperial Guard from Burgos: Marmont ordered Bonnet to\r\nevacuate the Asturias and come down by the route of Leon to join him:\r\nhe also directed Brennier to come up from the Tagus, and Ferey to hurry\r\nhis march from La Mancha. Aides-de-camp were sent to hunt for Foy, who\r\nwas known to be on the borders of the Murcian regions, where Montbrun\r\nhad dropped him on his march to Alicante. Montbrun himself, with the\r\nrest of his column, was also to turn back as soon as the orders should\r\nreach him.\r\n\r\nBy this concentration Marmont calculated[214] that he would have 32,000\r\nmen in line opposite Wellington by January 26 or 27th, as Bonnet,\r\nBrennier, and Dorsenne’s Guards should have arrived by then. And by\r\nFebruary 1 Ferey and Foy ought also to be up, and more than 40,000 men\r\nwould be collected. Vain dates! For Wellington captured Rodrigo on the\r\n19th, seven days before the Marshal and Dorsenne could collect even\r\n32,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [214] _Mémoires_, iv. p. 184.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Marmont pushed on for Salamanca, where the troops were\r\nto concentrate, having with him only the divisions of Clausel and\r\nMaucune. On January 21st he had reached Fuente Sauco, one march\r\nnorth of Salamanca, when he received the appalling news that Ciudad\r\nRodrigo had been stormed by Wellington two days before. This was a\r\nthunderstroke--his army was caught not half concentrated, and he\r\nwas for the moment helpless. He advanced as far as Salamanca, and\r\nthere picked up Thiébault’s division, but even so he had not more\r\nthat 15,000 men in hand, and dared not, with such a handful, march\r\non Rodrigo, to endeavour to recover it before Wellington should have\r\nrestored its fortifications. Bonnet had not yet even reached Leon:\r\nFerey and Dorsenne’s Guard division had not been heard of. As to where\r\nFoy and Montbrun might be at the moment, it was hardly possible to\r\nhazard a guess. The only troops that could be relied upon to appear\r\nwithin the next few days were the divisions of Souham and Brennier.\r\nEven with their help the army would not exceed 26,000 or 28,000 men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wellington, with seven divisions now in hand, for he had\r\nbrought up both the 5th and the 7th to the front, was lying on the\r\nAgueda, covering the repairs of Ciudad Rodrigo. Marmont had at first\r\nthought that, elated by his recent success, the British general might\r\npush his advance towards Salamanca. He made no signs of doing so: all\r\nhis troops remained concentrated on the Portuguese frontier, ready\r\nto protect the rebuilding of Rodrigo. Here, on the day after the\r\nstorm, all the trenches were filled in, and the débris on the breaches\r\nremoved. Twelve hundred men were then turned to the task of mending the\r\nbreaches, which were at first built up with fascines and earth only,\r\nso as to make them ready within a few days to resist a _coup-de-main_.\r\nIn a very short time they were more or less in a state of defence, and\r\non February 15th Castaños produced a brigade of Spanish infantry to\r\nform the new garrison of the place. The work was much retarded by the\r\nweather. Throughout the time of the siege it had been bitterly cold\r\nbut very dry: but on the 28th the wind shifted to the west, and for\r\nthe nine days following there was incessant and torrential rain, which\r\nwas very detrimental to the work. It had, however, the compensating\r\nadvantage of preventing Marmont from making any advance from Salamanca.\r\nEvery river in Leon was over its banks, every ford impassable, the\r\nroads became practically useless. When, therefore, on February 2nd[215]\r\nthe Agueda rose to such a height that Wellington’s trestle-bridge was\r\nswept away, and the stone town-bridge of Rodrigo was two feet under\r\nwater, so that the divisions cantoned on the Portuguese frontier were\r\ncut off from the half-repaired fortress, there was no pressing danger\r\nfrom the French, who were quite unable to move forward.\r\n\r\n  [215] Napier says Jan. 29. But Jones, then employed in repairing\r\n  Rodrigo, gives Feb. 2 in his diary of the work.\r\n\r\nMarmont, as we have seen, had reached Fuente Sauco on January 21st,\r\nand Salamanca on January 22nd. On the following day Souham, coming in\r\nfrom the direction of Zamora, appeared at Matilla, half way between\r\nSalamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, so that he was in touch with his chief\r\nand ready to act as his advanced guard. But no other troops had come\r\nup, and on the 24th the Marshal received a hasty note from Dorsenne,\r\nsaying that the division of the Young Guard from Burgos would not\r\nreach the Tormes till February 2[216]. With only four divisions at his\r\ndisposition (Clausel, Maucune, Thiébault, Souham) Marmont dared not\r\nyet move forward, since he knew that Wellington had at least six in\r\nhand, and he shrank from committing himself to decisive action with\r\nlittle more than 20,000 men assembled. On the 28th Dorsenne sent in a\r\nstill more disheartening dispatch than his last: he had now ordered\r\nRoguet’s Guards, who had got as far forward as Medina del Campo, to\r\nreturn to Burgos[217]. The reasons given were that Mina had just\r\ninflicted a severe blow on General Abbé, the commanding officer in\r\nNavarre, by beating him near Pampeluna with a loss of 400 men, that\r\nthe Conde de Montijo, from Aragon, had laid siege to Soria, and was\r\npressing its garrison hard, and that another assembly of guerrillero\r\nbands had attacked Aranda del Duero, and would take it, if it were not\r\nsuccoured in a few days. ‘I therefore trust that your excellency will\r\napprove of my having called back Roguet’s division, its artillery, and\r\nLaferrière’s horse, to use them for a _guerre à outrance_ against the\r\nguerrillas.’ Nothing serious--he added--would follow, as all reports\r\nagreed that Wellington was sitting tight near Ciudad Rodrigo, and would\r\nmake no advance toward Salamanca.\r\n\r\n  [216] Dorsenne to Marmont, from Valladolid, Feb. 24.\r\n\r\n  [217] Same to same, from Valladolid, Feb. 27.\r\n\r\nNo succours whatever, therefore, were to be expected from the Army of\r\nthe North: Bonnet had only just recrossed the Cantabrian mountains,\r\nmuch incommoded by the bad weather in the passes, and Foy and Montbrun\r\nwere only expected in the neighbourhood of Toledo early in February.\r\nTherefore Marmont abandoned all hope of attacking Wellington before\r\nCiudad Rodrigo should be in a state of defence. The desperately rainy\r\nweather of January 28th to February 6th was no doubt the last decisive\r\nfact in making the Marshal give up the game. Before the rain had ceased\r\nfalling, he concluded that all chance of a successful offensive move\r\nwas gone, for he returned from Salamanca to Valladolid on February 5th.\r\n\r\nOn February 6th he wrote to Berthier[218] that he had ordered Montbrun\r\nand Foy, on their return from the Alicante expedition, to remain behind\r\nin the valley of the Tagus, and not to come on to Salamanca. His reason\r\nfor abandoning all idea of a general concentration against Wellington\r\nin the kingdom of Leon, was that he was convinced that the next move\r\nof the British general would be to make a dash at Badajoz, and that he\r\nwished to have a considerable force ready in the direction of Almaraz\r\nand Talavera, with which he could succour the Army of the South,\r\nwhen it should be compelled to march, as in 1811, to relieve that\r\nfortress. His forecast of Wellington’s probable scheme of operations\r\nwas perfectly correct, and his idea that the best way to foil it would\r\nbe to hold a large portion of his army in the valley of the Tagus was\r\ncorrect also. But he was not to be permitted to carry out his own plan:\r\nthe orders from Paris, which he so much dreaded, once more intervened\r\nto prescribe for him a very different policy[219].\r\n\r\n  [218] Marmont to Berthier, Valladolid, Feb. 6. Not in Marmont’s\r\n  _Mémoires_, but printed in King Joseph’s Correspondance, viii. p.\r\n  301.\r\n\r\n  [219] I must confess that all Napier’s comment on Marmont’s\r\n  doings (vol. iv. pp. 94-5) seems to me to be vitiated by a wish\r\n  to vindicate Napoleon at all costs, and to throw all possible\r\n  blame on his lieutenant. His statements contain what I cannot\r\n  but call a _suggestio falsi_, when he says that ‘Bonnet quitted\r\n  the Asturias, Montbrun hastened back from Valencia, Dorsenne\r\n  sent a detachment in aid, and on Jan. 25 six divisions of\r\n  infantry and one of cavalry, 45,000 men in all, were assembled\r\n  at Salamanca, from whence to Ciudad is only four marches.’ This\r\n  misses the facts that (1) Marmont had only _four_ divisions\r\n  (Souham, Clausel, Maucune, and the weak division of Thiébault);\r\n  (2) that Bonnet had not arrived, nor could for some days; (3)\r\n  that Dorsenne sent nothing, and on Jan. 27 announced that nothing\r\n  would be forthcoming; (4) that Montbrun (who was at Alicante on\r\n  Jan. 16) was still far away on the borders of Murcia. With 22,000\r\n  men only in hand Marmont was naturally cautious.\r\n\r\nWellington during the critical days from January 20th to February 6th\r\nwas naturally anxious. He knew that Marmont would concentrate against\r\nhim, but he hoped (as indeed he was justified in doing) that the\r\nconcentration would be slow and imperfect, and that the Marshal would\r\nfind himself too weak to advance from Salamanca. His anxiety was made\r\nsomewhat greater than it need have been, by a false report that Foy\r\nand Montbrun were already returned from the Alicante expedition--he\r\nwas told that both had got back to Toledo by the beginning of\r\nJanuary[220]--a most mischievous piece of false news. An equally\r\ngroundless rumour informed him that Bonnet had left the Asturias,\r\nmany days before his departure actually took place. On January 21 he\r\nwrote to Lord Liverpool that Bonnet had passed Benavente on his way\r\nto Salamanca, and that ‘the whole of what had gone eastward’ [i. e.\r\nFoy and Montbrun] was reported to be coming up from the Tagus to\r\nValladolid, so that in a few days Marmont might possibly have 50,000\r\nmen in hand[221]. To make himself strong against such a concentration\r\nhe ordered Hill, on January 22, to bring up three brigades of the 2nd\r\nDivision to Castello Branco, with which he might join the main army at\r\na few days’ notice[222]. At the same time he directed General Abadia to\r\nsend a force to occupy the Asturias, which must be empty since Bonnet\r\nhad evacuated it. It was not till some days later that he got the\r\nreassuring, and correct, news that Foy and Montbrun, instead of being\r\nalready at the front in Castile, were not even expected at Toledo till\r\nJanuary 29th, and that Bonnet had started late, and was only at La\r\nBaneza when February had already begun. But, by the time that he had\r\nreceived this information, it had already become evident that Marmont\r\nwas not about to take the offensive, and Ciudad Rodrigo was already\r\nin a condition to resist a _coup-de-main_; while, since the whole\r\nsiege-train of the Army of Portugal had been captured therein, it was\r\ncertain that the Marshal could not come up provided with the artillery\r\nrequired for a regular siege.\r\n\r\n  [220] See _Dispatches_, viii. p. 547.\r\n\r\n  [221] I fancy that Wellington’s erroneous statement that Marmont\r\n  had six divisions collected at Salamanca on the 23rd-24th\r\n  [misprinted by Gurwood, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 577, as ‘the 6th\r\n  Division!’] was Napier’s source for stating that such a force\r\n  was assembled, which it certainly was not, Wellington reckoned\r\n  that Marmont had Souham, Clausel, Maucune, Thiébault, and two\r\n  divisions from the East, which last had not really come up--and\r\n  never were to do so.\r\n\r\n  [222] Wellington to Hill, Jan. 22, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 566.\r\n\r\nBy February 12th the real state of affairs became clear, ‘the enemy\r\nhas few troops left at Salamanca and in the towns on the Tormes, and\r\nit appears that Marshal Marmont has cantoned the right of his army on\r\nthe Douro, at Zamora and Toro, the centre in the province of Avila,\r\nwhile one division (the 6th) has returned to Talavera and the valley\r\nof the Tagus.’ This was nearly correct: Marmont, on February 6th, had\r\ndefined his position as follows--two divisions (those just returned\r\nfrom the Alicante expedition) in the valley of the Tagus; one, the\r\n6th (Brennier), at Monbeltran, in one of the passes leading from the\r\nTagus to the Douro valley; one (Clausel) at Avila; three on the Douro\r\nand the Esla (Zamora, Toro, Benavente) with a strong advanced guard at\r\nSalamanca. The heavy detachment towards the Tagus, as he explained, was\r\nto provide for the probable necessity of succouring Badajoz, to which\r\nWellington was certain to turn his attention ere long.\r\n\r\nMarmont was perfectly right in his surmise. Ciudad Rodrigo had hardly\r\nbeen in his hands for five days, when Wellington began to issue orders\r\npresupposing an attack on Badajoz. On January 25th Alexander Dickson\r\nwas directed to send the 24-lb. shot and reserve powder remaining at\r\nthe artillery base at Villa da Ponte to be embarked on the Douro for\r\nOporto, where they were to be placed on ship-board[223]. Next day it\r\nwas ordered that sixteen howitzers of the siege-train should start\r\nfrom Almeida overland for the Alemtejo, each drawn by eight bullocks,\r\nwhile twenty 24-pounders were to be shipped down the Douro from Barca\r\nde Alva to Oporto, and sent round from thence to Setubal, the seaport\r\nnearest to Elvas[224]. On the 28th Dickson himself was ordered to start\r\nat once for Setubal, in order that he might be ready to receive each\r\nconsignment on its arrival, and to make arrangements for its transport\r\nto Elvas[225], while a dispatch was sent to Hill[226] definitely\r\nstating that, if all went well, the siege of Badajoz was to begin in\r\nthe second week of March.\r\n\r\n  [223] _Dickson Papers_, ii. p. 571.\r\n\r\n  [224] Wellington, _Dispatches_, viii. pp. 568-9.\r\n\r\n  [225] _Dickson Papers_, ii. p. 576.\r\n\r\n  [226] Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 571.\r\n\r\nThese plans were drawn up long before it was clear that the army might\r\nnot have to fight Marmont on the Agueda, for the defence of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. ‘If they should move this way, I hope to give a good account\r\nof them,’ Wellington wrote to Douglas (the British officer attached to\r\nthe Army of Galicia)[227]: but he judged it more likely that no such\r\nadvance would be made. ‘I think it probable that when Marmont shall\r\nhave heard of our success, he will not move at all[228].’ Meanwhile\r\nthere was no need to march the army southward for some time, since\r\nthe artillery and stores would take many weeks on their land or water\r\nvoyage, when roads were bad and the sea vexed with winter storms.\r\nSo long as seven divisions were cantoned behind the Agueda and Coa,\r\nMarmont could have no certain knowledge that the attack on Badajoz was\r\ncontemplated, whatever he might suspect. Therefore no transference\r\nsouthward of the divisions behind the Agueda was begun till February\r\n19th. But Wellington, with an eye on Marmont’s future movements,\r\ncontemplated a raid by Hill on the bridge of Almaraz, the nearest and\r\nbest passage which the French possessed on the Tagus. If it could be\r\nbroken by a flying column, any succours from the Army of Portugal to\r\nthe Army of the South would have to take a much longer route and waste\r\nmuch time[229]. The project was abandoned, on Hill’s report that he\r\ndoubted of its practicability, since a successful _coup-de-main_ on\r\none of the bridge-head forts might not secure the actual destruction\r\nof the boats, which the French might withdraw to the farther side of\r\nthe river, and relay at their leisure[230]. But, as we shall see, the\r\nscheme was postponed and not entirely rejected: in May it was carried\r\nout with complete success.\r\n\r\n  [227] Wellington to Sir Howard Douglas, Jan. 22, _Dispatches_,\r\n  viii. p. 568.\r\n\r\n  [228] Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 567, same day as\r\n  last.\r\n\r\n  [229] Wellington to Hill, Jan. 28, _Dispatches_, viii. pp. 571-2\r\n  and 586-7.\r\n\r\n  [230] Wellington to Hill, Feb. 12, _Dispatches_. viii. p. 603.\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington was awaiting the news that his siege artillery was\r\nwell forward on the way to Elvas, Marmont had been undergoing one of\r\nhis periodical lectures from Paris. A dispatch sent to him by Berthier\r\non January 23, and received at Valladolid on February 6th--fourteen\r\ndays only having been occupied by its travels--had of course no\r\nreference to Wellington or Ciudad Rodrigo, the news of the investment\r\nof that fortress having only reached Paris on January 27th. It was\r\nmainly composed of censures on Montbrun’s Alicante expedition, which\r\nNapoleon considered to have been undertaken with too large a force--’he\r\nhad ordered a flying column to be sent against Valencia, a whole army\r\ncorps had marched.’ But the paragraph in it which filled Marmont with\r\ndismay was one ordering him to make over at once 6,000 men to the Army\r\nof the North, whose numbers the Emperor considered to be running too\r\nlow, now that the two Guard divisions had been directed to return to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n‘Twenty-four hours after the receipt of this dispatch you will start\r\noff on the march one of your divisions, with its divisional artillery,\r\nand its exact composition as it stands at the moment of the arrival of\r\nthis order, and will send it to Burgos, to form part of the Army of\r\nthe North. His Majesty forbids you to change any general belonging to\r\nthis division, or to make any alterations in it. In return you will\r\nreceive three provisional regiments of detachments, about 5,000 men,\r\nwhom you may draft into your battalions. They are to start from Burgos\r\nthe day that the division which you are ordered to send arrives there.\r\nAll the Guards are under orders for France, and can only start when\r\nyour division has reached that place.... The Army of the North will\r\nthen consist of three divisions: (1) that which you are sending off;\r\n(2) Caffarelli’s division (due at Pampeluna from Aragon); (3) a third\r\ndivision which General Dorsenne will organize from the 34th Léger,\r\nthe 113th and 130th of the line and the Swiss battalions.... By this\r\narrangement the Army of the North will be in a position to aid you with\r\ntwo divisions if the English should march against you[231].’\r\n\r\n  [231] The ‘third division’ practically represented Thiébault’s\r\n  old division of the Army of the North, which had long held the\r\n  Salamanca district. This division was to be deprived of its\r\n  Polish regiment (recalled to France with all other Poles) and\r\n  to be given instead the 130th, then at Santander. But the 130th\r\n  really belonged to the Army of Portugal (Sarrut’s division),\r\n  though separated from it at the moment. So Marmont was being\r\n  deprived of one regiment more.\r\n\r\nAlong with this dispatch arrived another from Dorsenne[232], clamouring\r\nfor the division which was to be given him--he had already got the\r\nnotice that he was to receive it, as he lay nearer to France than\r\nMarmont. He promised that the three provisional regiments should be\r\nsent off, as the Emperor directed, the moment that the ceded division\r\nshould reach him. The Duke of Ragusa could not refuse to obey such\r\nperemptory orders from his master, and ordered Bonnet’s division, from\r\nBenavente and Leon, to march on Burgos. His letter acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of the Emperor’s dispatch was plaintive. ‘I am informed that,\r\naccording to the new arrangement, the Army of the North will be in\r\na position to help me with two divisions if I am attacked. I doubt\r\nwhether His Majesty’s intentions on this point will be carried out, and\r\nin no wise expect it. I believe that I am justified in fearing that\r\nany troops sent me will have to be long waited for, and will be an\r\ninsignificant force when they do appear. Not to speak of the slowness\r\ninevitable in all joint operations, it takes so long in Spain to get\r\ndispatches through, and to collect troops, that I doubt whether I shall\r\nobtain any help at the critical moment. ... The net result of all is\r\nthat I am left much weaker in numbers.’\r\n\r\n  [232] Dorsenne to Marmont, from Uñas, Feb. 5.\r\n\r\nMarmont might have added that the three provisional regiments, which he\r\nwas to receive in return for Bonnet’s division and the 130th Line, were\r\nno real reinforcement, but his own drafts, long due to arrive at the\r\nfront, but detained by Dorsenne in Biscay and Old Castile to garrison\r\nsmall posts and keep open communications. And he was not destined\r\nto receive them as had been promised: Dorsenne wrote on February 24\r\napologizing for not forwarding them at once: they were guarding the\r\nroads between Irun and Vittoria, and could not be spared till other\r\ntroops had been moved into their scattered garrisons to relieve them.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th the news of the advance of Wellington against Ciudad\r\nRodrigo had at last reached Paris--eight days after the fortress\r\nhad fallen. It caused the issue of new orders by the Emperor, all\r\nexquisitely inappropriate when they reached Marmont’s hands on February\r\n10th. The Marshal had been contemplating the tiresome results of the\r\nstorm of the fortress for nearly three weeks, but Napoleon’s orders\r\npresupposed much spare time before Rodrigo would be in any danger:\r\nDorsenne is to stop the march of the Guards towards France, and to\r\nbring up all the forces he can to help the Army of Portugal: Montbrun\r\nwill be back at Madrid by January 18 [on which day he was really in\r\nthe middle of the kingdom of Murcia], and at the front in Leon before\r\nFebruary 1st. After his arrival the Army of Portugal will be able to\r\ntake up its definitive line of action. Finally, there is a stab at\r\nMarmont, ‘the English apparently have advanced in order to make a\r\ndiversion to hamper the siege of Valencia; they only did so because\r\nthey had got information of the great strength of the detachment which\r\nthe Army of Portugal made in that direction[233].’\r\n\r\n  [233] Napoleon to Berthier, Jan. 27.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal could only reply by saying that the orders were all out of\r\ndate, that he had (as directed) given up Bonnet’s division to the Army\r\nof the North, and that, Ciudad Rodrigo having fallen far earlier than\r\nany one had expected, and long before any sufficient relieving force\r\ncould be collected, he had been unable to save it, and had now cantoned\r\nhis army (minus Bonnet) with four divisions in the valley of the Douro\r\nand three in the valley of the Tagus, in expectation of an approaching\r\nmove on the part of Wellington towards Badajoz.\r\n\r\nThese dispositions had not long been completed when another dispatch\r\narrived from Paris, dated February 11th, in which the Emperor censured\r\nonce more all his lieutenant’s actions, and laid down for him a new\r\nstrategical policy from which he was forbidden to swerve.\r\n\r\n‘The Emperor regrets that when you had the division of Souham and three\r\nothers united [i. e. on January 23] you did not move on Salamanca, to\r\nmake out what was going on. That would have given the English much\r\nto think about, and might have been useful to Ciudad Rodrigo. The\r\nway to help the army under the present circumstances is to place its\r\nhead-quarters at Salamanca, and concentrate your force there, detaching\r\none division to the Tagus valley and also reoccupying the Asturias.\r\n[This concentration] will oblige the enemy to remain about Almeida and\r\nin the North, for fear of an invasion of Portugal. You might even march\r\non Rodrigo, and, if you have the necessary siege artillery, capture the\r\nplace--your honour is bound up with it. If want of the artillery or\r\nof food renders it necessary to put off such an operation, you could\r\nat least make an incursion into Portugal, and advance towards the\r\nDouro and Almeida. This menace would keep the enemy “contained”....\r\nYour posture should be offensive, with Salamanca as base and Almeida\r\nas objective: as long as the English know that you are in strength\r\nat Salamanca they will not budge: but if you retire to Valladolid\r\nyourself, and scatter divisions to the rear, and above all if you have\r\nnot got your cavalry effective by the time that the rainy season ends,\r\nyou will expose all the north of Spain to misfortunes.\r\n\r\n‘It is indispensable to reoccupy the Asturias, because more troops are\r\nneeded to hold the edge of the plain as far as Biscay than to keep down\r\nthat province. Since the English are divided into two corps, one in the\r\nSouth and the other opposite you, they cannot be in heavy strength: you\r\nought to outnumber them greatly.... I suppose that you consider the\r\nEnglish mad, for you believe them capable of marching against Badajoz\r\nwhen you are at Salamanca, i. e. of allowing you to march to Lisbon\r\nbefore they can get back. They will only go southward if you, by your\r\nill-devised schemes, keep two or three divisions detached on the Tagus:\r\nthat reassures them, and tells them that you have no offensive projects\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n‘To recapitulate, the Emperor’s intentions are that you should stop at\r\nSalamanca, that you should reoccupy the Asturias, that your army should\r\nbase itself on Salamanca, and that from thence you should threaten the\r\nEnglish.’\r\n\r\nIt may seem profane to the worshippers of the Emperor to say that this\r\ndispatch was purely wrong-headed, and argued a complete misconception\r\nof the situation. But it is impossible to pass any other verdict\r\non it. Marmont, since Bonnet’s division had been stolen from him,\r\nhad seven divisions left, or about 44,000 men effective, including\r\ncavalry and artillery. The Emperor tells him to keep one division on\r\nthe Tagus, to send a second to occupy the Asturias. This leaves him\r\nabout 34,000 net to concentrate at Salamanca. With this force he is\r\nto attempt to besiege Rodrigo, or at least to execute a raid as far\r\nas Almeida and the Douro. ‘The English are divided and so must be\r\nmuch numerically inferior to you.’ But, as a matter of fact, the only\r\nBritish detachment that was not under Wellington’s hand at the moment\r\nwas Hill’s 2nd Division, and he had just brought that up to Castello\r\nBranco, and would have had it with him in five days, if Marmont had\r\nadvanced from Salamanca. The Marshal would have seen 55,000 men\r\nfalling upon his 34,000 if he had moved on any day before the 20th of\r\nFebruary, and Wellington was ‘spoiling for a fight,’ or, in his own\r\nquiet phraseology, ‘if the French move this way, I hope to give a good\r\naccount of them[234].’ Supposing Marmont had, by some evil inspiration,\r\ndone what the Emperor had wished him to do before the orders came,\r\nhe would have been crushed by almost double numbers somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rodrigo or Almeida. The battle of Salamanca would have\r\nbeen fought six months too soon.\r\n\r\n  [234] Wellington to Douglas, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 568.\r\n\r\nThis is the crucial objection to Napoleon’s main thesis: he underrated\r\nWellington’s numbers and his readiness to give battle. As to details\r\nwe may observe (1) that there was no siege-train to batter Rodrigo,\r\nbecause the whole of the heavy guns of the Army of Portugal had been\r\ncaptured in that fortress. (2) That Wellington was ‘mad’ enough to\r\nmarch upon Badajoz with his whole army, precisely because he knew that,\r\neven if Marmont should invade Portugal, he could never get to Lisbon.\r\nHe realized, as the Emperor did not, that an army of five or six\r\ndivisions could not march on Lisbon in the casual fashion recommended\r\nin this dispatch, because it would starve by the way. Central Portugal,\r\nstill suffering from the blight of Masséna’s invasion, could not\r\nhave sustained 30,000 men marching in a mass and trying to live upon\r\nthe country in the usual French style. And Marmont, as his adversary\r\nwell knew, had neither great magazines at his base, nor the immense\r\ntransport train which would have permitted them to be utilized. The\r\nbest proof of the impracticability of Napoleon’s scheme was that\r\nMarmont endeavoured to carry it out in April, when nothing lay in front\r\nof him but Portuguese militia, and failed to penetrate more than a\r\nfew marches into the land, because he could not feed his army, and\r\ntherefore could not keep it concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal knew long beforehand that this plan was hopeless. He wrote\r\nto Berthier from Valladolid on February 26th as follows:\r\n\r\n‘Your Highness informs me that if my army is united at Salamanca the\r\nEnglish would be “mad” to move into Estremadura, leaving me behind\r\nthem, and free to advance on Lisbon. But they tried this precise\r\ncombination in May 1811, though all my army was then quite close to\r\nSalamanca, and though the Army of the North was then twice as strong as\r\nit is to-day, and though the season was then later and allowed us to\r\nfind provender for our horses, and though we were then in possession\r\nof Ciudad Rodrigo. They considered at that time that we could not\r\nundertake such an operation [as a march on Lisbon], and were perfectly\r\nright. Will they think that it is practicable to-day, when all the\r\nconditions which I have just cited are changed to our disadvantage, and\r\nwhen they know that a great body of troops has returned to France?...\r\nConsequently no movement on this side can help Badajoz. The only\r\npossible course is to take measures directly bearing on that place, if\r\nwe are to bring pressure upon the enemy and hope to attain our end.\r\nThe Emperor seems to ignore the food question. This is the important\r\nproblem; and if it could be ended by the formation of base-magazines,\r\nhis orders could be executed with punctuality and precision. But we are\r\nfar from such a position--by no fault of mine.... When transferred to\r\nthe North in January, I found not a grain of wheat in the magazines,\r\nnot a sou in the treasury, unpaid debts everywhere. As the necessary\r\nresult of the absurd system of administration adopted here, there\r\nwas in existence a famine--real or artificial--whose severity was\r\ndifficult to realize. We could only get food for daily consumption in\r\nour cantonments by using armed force: there is a long distance between\r\nthis state of affairs and the formation of magazines which would allow\r\nus to move the army freely.... The English army is always concentrated\r\nand can always be moved, because it has an adequate supply of money\r\nand transport. Seven or eight thousand pack-mules bring up its daily\r\nfood--hay for its cavalry on the banks of the Coa and Agueda has\r\nactually been sent out from England[235]. His Majesty may judge from\r\nthis fact the comparison between their means and ours--we have not\r\nfour days’ food in any of our magazines, we have no transport, we\r\ncannot draw requisitions from the most wretched village without sending\r\nthither a foraging party 200 strong: to live from day to day we have to\r\nscatter detachments to vast distances, and always to be on the move....\r\nIt is possible that His Majesty may be dissatisfied with my arguments,\r\nbut I am bound to say that I cannot carry out the orders sent me\r\nwithout bringing about a disaster ere long. If His Majesty thinks\r\notherwise, I must request to be superseded--a request not made for the\r\nfirst time: if I am given a successor the command will of course be\r\nplaced in better hands[236].’\r\n\r\n  [235] An exaggeration, but hay was actually brought to Lisbon and\r\n  Coimbra, and used for the English cavalry brigades, which had\r\n  been sent to the rear and cantoned on the Lower Mondego.\r\n\r\n  [236] Marmont to Berthier, Valladolid, Feb. 26. Marmont’s\r\n  _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 344-5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Marshal Marmont, Duke of Ragusa_]\r\n\r\nThis was an admirable summary of the whole situation in Spain, and\r\nmight have caused the Emperor to change his policy, if he had not by\r\nthis time so hardened himself in his false conceptions as to be past\r\nconviction. As Marmont complains, his master had now built up for\r\nhimself an imaginary picture of the state of affairs in the Peninsula,\r\nand argued as if the situation was what he wished it to be, not what\r\nit actually was. ‘Il suppose vrai tout ce qu’il voudrait trouver\r\nexistant[237].’\r\n\r\n  [237] Marmont’s ‘Observations on the Imperial Correspondence of\r\n  Feb. 1812,’ _Mémoires_, iv. p. 512.\r\n\r\nA subsequent letter from Paris, dated February 21st and received about\r\nMarch 2nd, contained one small amelioration of Marmont’s lot--he\r\nwas told that he might take back Bonnet’s division, and not cede\r\nit to Dorsenne, on condition that he sent it at once to occupy the\r\nAsturias. But it then proceeded to lay down in the harshest terms the\r\ncondemnation of the Marshal’s strategy:\r\n\r\n‘The Emperor charges me to repeat to you that you worry too much about\r\nmatters with which you have no concern. Your mission was to protect\r\nAlmeida and Rodrigo--and you have let them fall. You are told to\r\nmaintain and administer the North, and you abandon the Asturias--the\r\nonly point from which it can be dominated and contained. You are\r\ngetting into a state of alarm because Lord Wellington sends a division\r\nor two towards Badajoz. Now Badajoz is a very strong fortress, and the\r\nDuke of Dalmatia has 80,000 men, and can draw help from Marshal Suchet.\r\nIf Wellington were to march on Badajoz [he had done so the day before\r\nthis letter was written] you have a sure, prompt, and triumphant means\r\nof bringing him back--that of marching on Rodrigo and Almeida.’\r\n\r\nMarmont replied, with a suppressed rage that can be read between the\r\nlines even more clearly than in his earlier letters, ‘Since the Emperor\r\nattributes to me the fall of Almeida, which was given up before I had\r\nactually taken over the command of this army[238], I cannot see what I\r\ncan do to shelter myself from censures at large: ... I am accused of\r\nbeing the cause of the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo: it fell because it\r\nhad an insufficient garrison of inferior quality and a bad commandant.\r\nDorsenne was neither watchful nor prescient. Was it for me to take\r\ncare of a place not in my command, and separated from me by a chain\r\nof mountains, and by the desert that had been made by the six months’\r\nsojourn of the Army of Portugal in the valley of the Tagus?... I am\r\nblamed for having cantoned myself in the valley of the Tagus after\r\nrepulsing Lord Wellington beyond the Coa [at the time of El Bodon],\r\nbut this was the result of the imperative orders of the Emperor, who\r\nassigned me no other territory than the Tagus valley. Rodrigo was\r\noccupied by troops of the Army of the North.... I have ordered General\r\nBonnet to reoccupy the Asturias at once, and quite see the importance\r\nof the occupying of that province.... I am told that the Emperor thinks\r\nthat I busy myself too much about the interests of others, and not\r\nenough about my own. I had considered that one of my duties (and one of\r\nthe most difficult of them) was to assist the Army of the South, and\r\nthat duty was formally imposed on me in some twenty dispatches, and\r\nspecially indicated by the order which bade me leave three divisions\r\nin the valley of the Tagus. To-day I am informed that I am relieved\r\nof that duty, and my position becomes simpler and better! But if the\r\nEmperor relies with confidence on the effect which demonstrations\r\nin the North will produce on the mind of Wellington, I must dare to\r\nexpress my contrary opinion. Lord Wellington is quite aware that I have\r\nno magazines, and is acquainted with the immensely difficult physical\r\ncharacter of the country, and its complete lack of food resources at\r\nthis season. He knows that my army is not in a position to cross the\r\nCoa, even if no one opposes me, and that if we did so we should have to\r\nturn back at the end of four days, unable to carry on the campaign, and\r\nwith our horses all starved to death[239].’\r\n\r\n  [238] To be exact, it was on May 10 that Marmont took over the\r\n  command from Masséna, and Almeida was evacuated by Brennier that\r\n  same night.\r\n\r\n  [239] I extract these various paragraphs from Marmont’s vast\r\n  dispatch of March 2, omitting much more that is interesting and\r\n  apposite.\r\n\r\nThis and much more to the same effect had apparently some effect on the\r\nmind of the Emperor. But the result was confusing when formulated on\r\npaper. Berthier replied on March 12:\r\n\r\n‘Your letters of February 27 and 28 and March 2 have been laid before\r\nthe Emperor. His Majesty thinks that not only must you concentrate\r\nat Salamanca, but that you must throw a bridge across the Agueda, so\r\nthat, if the enemy leaves less than five divisions north of the Tagus,\r\nyou may be able to advance to the Coa, against Almeida, and ravage all\r\nnorthern Portugal. If Badajoz is captured by two divisions of the enemy\r\nits loss will not be imputed to you, the entire responsibility will\r\nfall on the Army of the South. If the enemy leaves only two, three, or\r\neven four divisions north of the Tagus, the Army of Portugal will be\r\nto blame if it does not at once march against the hostile force before\r\nit, invest Almeida, ravage all northern Portugal, and push detachments\r\nas far as the Mondego. Its rôle is simply to “contain” six British\r\ndivisions, or at least five: it must take the offensive in the North,\r\nor, if the enemy has taken the initiative, or other circumstances\r\nnecessitate it, must dispatch to the Tagus, by Almaraz, the same number\r\nof divisions that Lord Wellington shall have dispatched to conduct the\r\nsiege of Badajoz.’\r\n\r\nThis double-edged document reached Salamanca on March 27, _eleven days\r\nafter Wellington had invested Badajoz_. The whole allied field army had\r\nmarched for Estremadura in the last days of February, and not a single\r\nBritish division remained north of the Tagus. In accordance with the\r\nEmperor’s dispatches of February 11th and of February 18th, Marmont had\r\nalready concentrated the bulk of his resources at Salamanca, drawing\r\nin everything except Bonnet (destined for the Asturias), Souham, who\r\nwas left on the Esla to face the Army of Galicia, and the equivalent of\r\nanother division distributed as garrisons in Astorga, Leon, Palencia,\r\nZamora, and Valladolid. With five divisions in hand, or just coming up,\r\nhe was on the move, as the Emperor had directed, to threaten Rodrigo\r\nand Almeida and invade northern Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Paris letter of March 12, quoted above, suddenly imposed on Marmont\r\nthe choice between continuing the attack on Portugal, to which he was\r\ncommitted, or of leading his whole army by Almaraz to Badajoz--it must\r\nbe the whole army, since he was told to send just as many divisions\r\nsouthward as Wellington should have moved in that direction, and every\r\none of the seven units of the allied army had gone off.\r\n\r\nSince Badajoz was stormed on April 6th, only ten days after Marmont\r\nreceived on March 27 the Emperor’s dispatch of March 12, it is clear\r\nthat he never could have arrived in time to help the fortress. In June\r\n1811 he had accomplished a similar movement at a better season of the\r\nyear, and when some time had been allowed for preparation, in fifteen\r\ndays, but only by making forced marches of the most exhausting sort. It\r\ncould not have been done in so short a time in March or April, when the\r\ncrops were not ripe, the rivers were full, and the roads were far worse\r\nthan at midsummer. Moreover (as we shall presently see) Wellington had\r\nplaced a large containing force at Merida, half-way between Almaraz and\r\nBadajoz, which Marmont would have had to drive in--at much expense of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal’s perplexity on receiving the dispatch that came in upon\r\nMarch 27 was extreme. ‘The instructions just received,’ he wrote\r\nto Berthier, ‘are wholly contradictory to those of February 18 and\r\nFebruary 21, imperative orders which forced me, against my personal\r\nconviction, to abandon my own plan, and to make it impossible to do\r\nwhat I regarded as suitable to the interests of the Emperor. The\r\nletters of February 18 and February 21 told me that his Majesty\r\nthought me a meddler in matters which did not concern me: he told me\r\nthat it was unnecessary for me to worry about Badajoz, “a very strong\r\nfortress supported by an army of 80,000 men.” ... He gave me formal\r\norders to abandon any idea of marching to succour it, and added that\r\nif Lord Wellington went thither, he was to be left alone, because by\r\nadvancing to the Agueda I could bring him back at once. The letters of\r\nthe 18th and 21st made it quite clear that His Majesty freed me from\r\nall responsibility for Badajoz, provided I made a demonstration on the\r\nAgueda. ... To-day your Highness writes that I _am_ responsible for\r\nBadajoz, if Lord Wellington undertakes its siege with more than two\r\ndivisions. The concluding paragraph of your letter seems to give me\r\npermission to succour the place, by bringing up troops to the Tagus.\r\nSo, after imperative orders have wrecked my original arrangement, which\r\nhad prepared and assured an effective help for Badajoz, and after all\r\nchoice of methods has been forbidden to me, I am suddenly given an\r\noption when it is no longer possible to use it.... To-day, when my\r\ntroops from the Tagus valley have repassed the mountains, and used up\r\nthe magazines collected there at their departure, when it is impossible\r\nto get from Madrid the means to establish a new magazine at Almaraz, my\r\narmy, if it started from this point [Salamanca], would consume every\r\nscrap of food that could be procured before it could possibly reach\r\nBadajoz.... The movement was practicable when I was in my original\r\nposition: it is almost impracticable now, considering the season of the\r\nyear, and the probable time-limit of the enemy’s operations.... After\r\nripe reflection on the complicated situation, considering that my main\r\ntask is to hold down the North, and that this task is much greater\r\nthan that of holding the South, taking into consideration the news\r\nthat an English force is said to be landing at Corunna (an improbable\r\nstory, but one that is being repeatedly brought me), considering that\r\nthe Portuguese and Galician troops threaten to take the offensive from\r\nBraganza, remembering that your letters of February 18 and 21 state\r\nthat Suchet’s Army of Aragon is reckoned able to reinforce the Army\r\nof the South, and considering that my dispositions have been made (in\r\nspite of immense preliminary difficulties) for a fifteen days’ march on\r\nthe Agueda, which is already begun, I decide in favour of continuing\r\nthat operation, though I have (as I said before) no great confidence in\r\nits producing any effective result.\r\n\r\n‘Accordingly I am putting the division that came up from the Tagus in\r\nmotion for Plasencia, with orders to spread the rumour that it is to\r\nrejoin the army by the pass of Perales and enter Portugal; I start\r\nfrom here with three more divisions for the Agueda; ... if I fought\r\non the Tormes I could put one more division in line, five in all: the\r\nnumber of seven divisions of which the Emperor speaks could only be\r\nconcentrated if the Army of the North[240] could send two divisions to\r\nreplace my own two now on the lines of communications and the Esla.’\r\n\r\n  [240] Marmont writes the Army of the Centre, evidently in\r\n  confusion for the Army of the North. The nearest posts of the\r\n  Army of the Centre were 150 miles away from the Esla, while\r\n  the Army of the North at Burgos was much closer. Moreover, the\r\n  Army of the Centre had not two infantry divisions, but only\r\n  one--d’Armagnac’s--and some _Juramentado_ regiments.\r\n\r\nThe recapitulation of all this correspondence may seem tedious, but it\r\nis necessary. When it is followed with care I think that one definite\r\nfact emerges. Napoleon was directly and personally responsible for the\r\nfall of Badajoz. Down to March 27th Marmont was strictly forbidden to\r\ntake any precautions for the safety of that fortress, and was censured\r\nas a meddler and an alarmist, for wishing to keep a strong force in\r\nthe valley of the Tagus, ready to march thither. On March 27 he was\r\nsuddenly given an option of marching to Estremadura with his whole\r\narmy. It appears to be an option, not a definite order, for Berthier’s\r\nsentence introducing the new scheme is alternative--the Army of\r\nPortugal is ‘to take the offensive in the North _or_, under certain\r\ncircumstances, to march for Almaraz.’ But this point need not be\r\npressed, for if taken as a definite order it was impracticable: Marmont\r\nreceived it so late that, if he had marched for Badajoz with the\r\ngreatest possible speed, he would have reached it some days after the\r\nplace was stormed. The fact that he believed that he would never have\r\ngot there at all, because lack of food would have stopped him on the\r\nway, is indifferent. The essential point of Napoleon’s responsibility\r\nis that he authorized the march too late, after having most stringently\r\nforbidden it, in successive letters extending over several weeks.\r\n\r\nThat a march on Badajoz by the whole Army of Portugal (or so much of it\r\nas was not required to contain the Galicians and to occupy Asturias),\r\nif it had begun--as Marmont wished--in February or early March, would\r\nhave prevented Wellington from taking the fortress, is not certain.\r\nA similar march in June 1811 had that effect, at the time of the\r\noperations on the Caya. But Wellington’s position was much better\r\nin February 1812 than it had been eight months earlier. This much,\r\nhowever, is clear, that such an operation had a possible chance of\r\nsuccess, while Napoleon’s counter-scheme for a demonstration on the\r\nAgueda and an invasion of the northern Beira had no such prospect.\r\nThe Emperor, for lack of comprehension of the local conditions,\r\nmisconceived its efficacy, as Marmont very cogently demonstrated in his\r\nletters. Northern Portugal was a waste, where the Marshal’s army might\r\nwander for a few days, but was certain to be starved before it was many\r\nmarches from the frontier. Napier, in an elaborate vindication of the\r\nEmperor, tries to argue that the Marshal might have taken Rodrigo by\r\nescalade without a battering-train, have assailed Almeida in similar\r\nfashion, have menaced Oporto and occupied Coimbra[241]. He deliberately\r\nignores one essential condition of the war, viz. that because of the\r\nFrench system of ‘living on the country,’ Marmont had no magazines, and\r\nno transport sufficient to enable his army to conduct a long offensive\r\ncampaign in a devastated and hostile land. His paragraphs are mere\r\nrhetoric of the most unfair kind. For example, he says, ‘Wellington\r\nwith 18,000 men[242] escaladed Badajoz, a powerful fortress defended by\r\nan excellent governor and 5,000 French veterans: Marmont with 28,000\r\nmen would not attempt to escalade Rodrigo, although its breaches were\r\nscarcely healed and its garrison disaffected.’ This statement omits the\r\nessential details that Wellington had a large siege-train, had opened\r\nthree broad breaches in the walls of Badajoz, and, while the enemy\r\nwas fully occupied in defending them, escaladed distant points of the\r\n_enceinte_ with success. Marmont had no siege-train, and therefore\r\ncould have made no breaches; he would have had to cope with an\r\nundistracted garrison, holding ramparts everywhere intact. Moreover,\r\nCiudad Rodrigo and its outworks form a compact fortress, of not half\r\nthe circumference of Badajoz and its dependencies. If Ney and Masséna,\r\nwith an adequate siege apparatus, treated Rodrigo with respect in 1810,\r\nand proceeded against it by regular operations, Marmont would have been\r\nentirely unjustified in trying the desperate method of escalade in\r\n1812. The fortifications, as Napier grudgingly admits, were ‘healed’:\r\nan escalade against Carlos de España’s garrison would certainly have\r\nmet the same fate as Suchet’s assault on Saguntum, a much weaker and\r\nunfinished stronghold. But it is unnecessary to follow into detail\r\nNapier’s controversial statements, which are all part of a wrong-headed\r\nscheme to prove Napoleon infallible on all occasions and at all costs.\r\n\r\n  [241] See chapter vii of book iv, _Peninsular War_, iv. pp.\r\n  138-40.\r\n\r\n  [242] Why omit the 30,000 men of Graham and Hill?\r\n\r\nThe governing facts cannot be disputed: Marmont in February placed\r\nthree divisions on the Tagus, which were to form the advanced guard\r\nof an army that was to march to the relief of Badajoz, whose siege he\r\nforesaw. Napoleon told him not to concern himself about Badajoz, and\r\ncompelled him to concentrate his army about Salamanca. He instructed\r\nhim that the proper reply to an attack on Badajoz by Wellington was\r\nan invasion of northern Portugal, and gave him elaborate instructions\r\nconcerning it. Marmont reluctantly obeyed, and was starting on such an\r\nexpedition when he was suddenly told that he might move on Badajoz.\r\nBut he only received this permission ten days before that fortress\r\nwas stormed: it was therefore useless. The Emperor must take the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF BADAJOZ. MARCH-APRIL 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nIn narrating the troubles of the unlucky Duke of Ragusa, engaged\r\nin fruitless strategical controversy with his master, we have been\r\ncarried far into the month of March 1812. It is necessary to return to\r\nFebruary 20th in order to take up the story of Wellington’s march to\r\nEstremadura. We have seen that he commenced his artillery preparations\r\nin January, by sending Alexander Dickson to Setubal, and dispatching a\r\nlarge part of his siege-train southward, partly by sea, partly across\r\nthe difficult mountain roads of the Beira.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Portuguese infantry and cavalry, however, were not moved till\r\nthe guns were far on their way. It was Wellington’s intention to show\r\na large army on the frontier of Leon till the last possible moment. He\r\nhimself kept his old headquarters at Freneda, near Fuentes de Oñoro,\r\ntill March 5th, in order that Marmont might be led to persist in the\r\nbelief that his attention was still concentrated on the North. But,\r\nstarting from February 19th, his divisions, one by one, had made their\r\nunostentatious departure for the South: on the day when he himself\r\nfollowed them only one division (the 5th) and one cavalry brigade (V.\r\nAlten’s) still remained behind the Agueda. The rest were at various\r\nstages on their way to Elvas. Most of the divisions marched by the\r\nroute Sabugal, Castello Branco, Villa Velha, Niza. But the 1st Division\r\nwent by Abrantes, in order to pick up there its clothing for the new\r\nyear, which had been brought up the Tagus in boats from Lisbon to that\r\npoint. Some of the cavalry and the two independent Portuguese brigades\r\nof Pack and Bradford, whose winter cantonments had been rather to the\r\nrear, had separate routes of their own, through places so far west as\r\nThomar[243] and Coimbra. The three brigades of the 2nd Division, under\r\nHill, which had been brought up to Castello Branco at the beginning of\r\nJanuary, were at the head of the marching army, and reached Portalegre,\r\nvia Villa Velha, long before the rest of the troops were across the\r\nTagus. Indeed, the first of them (Ashworth’s Portuguese) started\r\nas early as February 2nd, and was at Castello de Vide, near Elvas,\r\nby February 8th, before the troops behind the Agueda had begun to\r\nmove[244].\r\n\r\n  [243] This was the case with G. Anson’s brigade and Bradford’s\r\n  Portuguese infantry. Pack went by Coimbra, Slade’s cavalry\r\n  brigade by Covilhão, and the horse artillery of Bull and McDonald\r\n  with it.\r\n\r\n  [244] Nothing is rarer, as all students of the Peninsular War\r\n  know to their cost, than a table of the exact movements of\r\n  Wellington’s army on any march. For this particular movement the\r\n  whole of the detailed orders happen to have been preserved in the\r\n  D’Urban Papers. The starting-places of the units were:--\r\n\r\n  1st Division--Gallegos, Carpio, Fuentes de Oñoro.\r\n\r\n  3rd Division--Zamorra (by the Upper Agueda).\r\n\r\n  4th Division--San Felices and Sesmiro.\r\n\r\n  5th Division--Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n\r\n  6th Division--Albergaria (near Fuente Guinaldo).\r\n\r\n  7th Division--Payo (in the Sierra de Gata).\r\n\r\n  Light Division--Fuente Guinaldo.\r\n\r\n  Bradford’s Portuguese--Barba del Puerco.\r\n\r\n  Pack’s Portuguese--Campillo and Ituero.\r\n\r\n  The marches were so arranged that the 7th Division passed through\r\n  Castello Branco on Feb. 26, the 6th Division on Feb. 29, the\r\n  Light Division on March 3, the 4th Division on March 5. All these\r\n  were up to Portalegre, Villa Viçosa, or Castello de Vide, in\r\n  touch with Elvas, by March 8. The 1st Division, coming by way of\r\n  Abrantes, joined on March 10. Pack and Bradford, who had very\r\n  circuitous routes, the one by Coimbra, the other by Thomar, were\r\n  not up till several days later (16th). The 5th Division did not\r\n  leave Rodrigo till March 9.\r\n\r\nThe lengthy column of infantry which had marched by Castello Branco and\r\nthe bridge of Villa Velha was cantoned in various places behind Elvas,\r\nfrom Villa Viçosa to Portalegre, by March 8th: the 1st Division, coming\r\nin from the Abrantes direction, joined them on March 10th, and halted\r\nat Monforte and Azumar. Only the 5th Division and the two Portuguese\r\nindependent brigades were lacking, and of these the two former were\r\nexpected by the 16th, the latter by the 20th. With the exception of\r\nthe 5th Division the whole of Wellington’s field army was concentrated\r\nnear Elvas by the 16th. Only the 1st Hussars of the King’s German\r\nLegion, under Victor Alten, had been left to keep the outpost line in\r\nfront of Ciudad Rodrigo, in order that the French vedettes in Leon\r\nshould not detect that all the army of Wellington had disappeared, as\r\nthey were bound to do if only Portuguese or Spanish cavalry showed at\r\nthe front[245]. Counting Hill’s corps, now long returned to its old\r\npost in front of Badajoz, there were now nearly 60,000 troops nearing\r\nElvas, viz. of infantry, all the eight old Anglo-Portuguese divisions,\r\nplus Hamilton’s Portuguese division[246], and Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nindependent Portuguese brigades. Of cavalry not only were all the old\r\nbrigades assembled (save Alten’s single regiment), but two powerful\r\nunits now showed at the front for the first time. These were the\r\nnewly-landed brigade of German heavy dragoons under Bock[247], which\r\nhad arrived at Lisbon on January 1st, and Le Marchant’s brigade of\r\nEnglish heavy dragoons[248], which had disembarked in the autumn, but\r\nhad not hitherto been brought up to join the field army. Of Portuguese\r\nhorse J. Campbell’s brigade was also at the front: the other Portuguese\r\ncavalry brigade, which had served on the Leon frontier during the\r\npreceding autumn, had been made over to General Silveira, and sent\r\nnorth of the Douro. But even after deducting this small brigade of 900\r\nsabres, Wellington’s mounted arm was immensely stronger than it had\r\never been before. He had concentrated it on the Alemtejo front, in\r\norder that he might cope on equal terms with the very powerful cavalry\r\nof Soult’s Army of Andalusia.\r\n\r\n  [245] The other regiment of V. Alten’s brigade (11th Light\r\n  Dragoons) was on March 12 at Ponte de Sor, on its way to the\r\n  South.\r\n\r\n  [246] Which lay at Arronches and Santa Olaya.\r\n\r\n  [247] 1st and 2nd Heavy Dragoons K.G.L.\r\n\r\n  [248] 3rd Dragoons, 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards. They had been\r\n  lying during the winter in the direction of Castello Branco.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief himself, travelling with his wonted speed, left\r\nhis old head-quarters at Freneda on March 5th, was at Castello Branco\r\non the 8th, at Portalegre on the 10th, and had reached Elvas, his\r\nnew head-quarters, on the 12th. Before leaving the North he had made\r\nelaborate arrangements for the conduct of affairs in that quarter.\r\nThey are contained in two memoranda, given the one to Castaños, who\r\nwas still in command both of the Galician and the Estremaduran armies\r\nof Spain, and the other to Generals Baccelar and Silveira, of whom the\r\nformer was in charge of the Portuguese department of the North, with\r\nhead-quarters at Oporto, and the other of the Tras-os-Montes, with\r\nhead-quarters at Villa Real[249].\r\n\r\n  [249] Dated Feb. 24 and 27, _Dispatches_, viii. pp. 629 and 638.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicate matter to leave Marmont with nothing save the\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese in his front. Of the former the available\r\ntroops were (1) the Army of Galicia, four weak field divisions, making\r\nabout 15,000 men, of whom only 550 were cavalry, while the artillery\r\ncounted only five batteries. There were 8,000 garrison and reserve\r\ntroops in Corunna, Vigo, Ferrol, and other fortified posts to the rear,\r\nbut these were unavailable for service[250]. Abadia still commanded\r\nthe whole army, under the nominal supervision of Castaños. He had one\r\ndivision (3,000 men under Cabrera) at Puebla Senabria on the Portuguese\r\nfrontier, two (9,000 men under Losada and the Conde de Belveder) at\r\nVillafranca, observing the French garrison of Astorga and Souham’s\r\ndivision on the Esla, which supported that advanced post, and one\r\n(2,500 men under Castañon) on the Asturian frontier watching Bonnet.\r\n(2) The second Spanish force available consisted of that section of\r\nthe Army of Estremadura, which lay north of the Sierra de Gata, viz.\r\nCarlos de España’s division of 5,000 men, of whom 3,000 had been thrown\r\ninto Ciudad Rodrigo, so that the surplus for the field was small, and\r\nof Julian Sanchez’s very efficient guerrillero cavalry, who were about\r\n1,200 strong and were now counted as part of the regular army and\r\nformally styled ‘1st and 2nd Lancers of Castille.’\r\n\r\n  [250] These figures are those of January, taken from the ‘morning\r\n  state’ in _Los Ejércitos españoles_, the invaluable book of 1822\r\n  published by the Spanish Staff.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese troops left to defend the northern frontier were all\r\nmilitia, with the exception of a couple of batteries of artillery and\r\nthe cavalry brigade of regulars which had been with Wellington in Leon\r\nduring the autumn, under Madden, but was now transferred to Silveira’s\r\ncharge, and set to watch the frontier of the Tras-os-Montes, with the\r\nfront regiment at Braganza. Silveira in that province had the four\r\nlocal regiments of militia, of which each had only one of its two\r\nbattalions actually embodied. Baccelar had a much more important force,\r\nbut of the same quality, the twelve regiments forming the divisions\r\nof Trant and J. Wilson, and comprising all the militia of the Entre\r\nDouro e Minho province and of northern Beira. Three of these regiments\r\nwere immobilized by having been told off to serve as the garrison of\r\nAlmeida. Farther south Lecor had under arms the two militia regiments\r\nof the Castello Branco country, watching their own district. The total\r\nforce of militia available on the whole frontier must have been about\r\n20,000 men of very second-rate quality: each battalion had only been\r\nunder arms intermittently, for periods of six months, and the officers\r\nwere for the most part the inefficient leavings of the regular army. Of\r\nthe generals Silveira was enterprising, but over bold, as the record of\r\nhis earlier campaigns sufficiently demonstrated--Trant and Wilson had\r\nhitherto displayed equal energy and more prudence: but in the oncoming\r\ncampaign they were convicted of Silveira’s fault, over-confidence.\r\nBaccelar passed as a slow but fairly safe commander, rather lacking in\r\nself-confidence.\r\n\r\nWellington’s very interesting memoranda divide the possibilities\r\nof March-April into three heads, of which the last contains three\r\nsub-sections:--\r\n\r\n(1) Marmont may, on learning that Badajoz is in danger, march with\r\npractically the whole of his army to succour it, as he did in May-June\r\n1811. If this should occur, Abadia and Carlos de España will advance\r\nand boldly take the offensive, laying siege to Astorga, Toro, Zamora,\r\nSalamanca, and other fortified posts. Silveira will co-operate with\r\nhis cavalry and infantry, within the bounds of prudence, taking care\r\nthat his cavalry, which may support Abadia, does not lose communication\r\nwith, and a secure retreat upon, his infantry, which will not risk\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n(2) Marmont may leave a considerable force, perhaps the two divisions\r\nof Souham and Bonnet, in Leon, while departing southward with the\r\ngreater part of his army: ‘this is the operation which it is probable\r\nthat the enemy will follow.’ What the Army of Galicia can then\r\naccomplish will depend on the exact relative force of itself and of\r\nthe French left in front of it, and on the state of the fortified\r\nplaces on the Douro and Tormes [Toro, Zamora, Salamanca] and the\r\ndegree of equipment with which General Abadia can provide himself for\r\nsiege-work. But España and Julian Sanchez must make all the play that\r\nthey can, and even Porlier and Longa, from distant Cantabria, must be\r\nasked to co-operate in making mischief. Silveira and Baccelar will\r\nsupport, but risk nothing.\r\n\r\n(3) Marmont may send to Estremadura only the smaller half of his army,\r\nand keep four or five divisions in the north, a force strong enough to\r\nenable him to take the offensive. He may attack either (_a_) Galicia,\r\n(_b_) Tras-os-Montes, or (_c_) the Beira, including Almeida and Ciudad\r\nRodrigo.\r\n\r\n(_a_) If Marmont should invade Galicia, Abadia had better retreat, but\r\nin the direction that will bring him near the frontiers of Portugal\r\n(i. e. by Puebla Senabria) rather than on Lugo and Corunna. In that\r\ncase Silveira and Baccelar will be on the enemy’s flank and rear, and\r\nwill do as much mischief as they can on his communications, always\r\ntaking care that they do not, by pushing too far into Leon, lose their\r\ncommunication with the Galicians or with Portugal. In proportion as the\r\nFrench may advance farther into Galicia, Baccelar will take measures\r\nto collect the whole of the militia of the Douro provinces northward.\r\nCarlos de España and Julian Sanchez ought to have good opportunities of\r\nmaking trouble for the enemy in the Salamanca district, if he pushes\r\nfar from his base.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If Marmont should invade Tras-os-Montes [not a likely operation,\r\nowing to the roughness of the country], Baccelar and Silveira should\r\noppose him in front, while Abadia would come down on his flank and\r\nrear, and annoy him as much as possible. ‘Don Carlos and the guerrillas\r\nmight do a great deal of mischief in Castille.’\r\n\r\n(_c_) If Marmont should attack Beira, advancing by Ciudad Rodrigo and\r\nAlmeida, both these fortresses are in such a state of defence as to\r\nensure them against capture by a _coup-de-main_, and are supplied with\r\nprovisions to suffice during any time that the enemy could possibly\r\nremain in the country. Baccelar and Silveira will assemble all the\r\nmilitia of the northern provinces in Upper Beira, and place themselves\r\nin communication with Carlos de España. They will endeavour to protect\r\nthe magazines on the Douro and Mondego [at Celorico, Guarda, Lamego,\r\nSt. João de Pesqueira], and may live on the last in case of urgent\r\nnecessity, but not otherwise, as these stores could not easily be\r\nreplaced. An attempt should be made, if possible, to draw the enemy\r\ninto the Beira Baixa (i. e. the Castello Branco country) rather than\r\ntowards the Douro. Abadia will invade northern Leon; what he can do\r\ndepends on the force that Marmont leaves on the Esla, and the strength\r\nof his garrisons at Astorga, Zamora, Toro, &c. Supposing Marmont takes\r\nthis direction, Carlos de España will destroy before him all the\r\nbridges on the Yeltes and Huebra, and that of Barba del Puerco, and the\r\nthree bridges at Castillejo, all on the Lower Agueda.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the alternative (2) was Marmont’s own choice, and\r\nthat he would have carried it out but for Napoleon’s orders, which\r\ndefinitively imposed upon him (3_c_) the raid into northern Beira.\r\nWith the inconclusive operations resulting from that movement we shall\r\ndeal in their proper place. It began on March 27th, and the Marshal\r\nwas over the Agueda on March 30th. The last British division had left\r\nCiudad Rodrigo three weeks before Marmont advanced, so difficult was\r\nit for him to get full and correct information, and to collect a\r\nsufficiently large army for invasion. On the 26th February he was under\r\nthe impression that two British divisions only had yet marched for\r\nBadajoz, though five had really started. On March 6th, when only the\r\n5th Division remained in the North, he still believed that Wellington\r\nand a large fraction of his army were in their old positions. This\r\nwas the result of his adversary’s wisdom in stopping at Freneda till\r\nMarch 5th; as long as he was there in person, it was still thought\r\nprobable by the French that only a detachment had marched southward.\r\nHence came the lateness of Marmont’s final advance: for a long time he\r\nmight consider that he was, as his master ordered, ‘containing’ several\r\nBritish divisions and the Commander-in-Chief himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on taking stock of his situation at Elvas on March 12th,\r\nWellington was reasonably satisfied. Not only was the greater part\r\nof his army in hand, and the rest rapidly coming up, but the siege\r\nmaterial had escaped all the perils of storms by sea and rocky\r\ndefiles by land, and was much where he had expected it to be. The\r\nmaterial which moved by road, the sixteen 24-lb. howitzers which had\r\nmarched on January 30th, and a convoy of 24-pounder and 18-pounder\r\ntravelling-carriages and stores, which went off on February 2, had\r\nboth come to hand at Elvas, the first on February 25th, the second on\r\nMarch 3, and were ready parked on the glacis. This was a wonderful\r\njourney over mountain roads in the most rainy season of the year. The\r\nsea-borne guns had also enjoyed a surprising immunity from winter\r\nstorms; Dickson, when he arrived at Setubal on February 10th, found\r\nthat the 24-pounders from Oporto had arrived thirty-six hours before\r\nhim, and on the 14th was beginning to forward them by river-boat to\r\nAlcacer do Sal, from where they were drawn by oxen to Elvas, along\r\nwith their ammunition[251]. The only difficulty which arose was that\r\nWellington had asked Admiral Berkeley, commanding the squadron at\r\nLisbon, to lend him, as a supplementary train, twenty 18-pound ship\r\nguns. The admiral sent twenty Russian guns (leavings of Siniavins’s\r\nsquadron captured in the Tagus at the time of the Convention of\r\nCintra). Dickson protested, as these pieces were of a different calibre\r\nfrom the British 18-pounder, and would not take its shot. The admiral\r\nrefused to disgarnish his own flagship, which happened to be the only\r\nvessel at Lisbon with home-made 18-pounders on board. Dickson had\r\nto take the Russian guns perforce, and to cull for their ammunition\r\nall the Portuguese stores at Lisbon, where a certain supply of round\r\nshot that fitted was discovered, though many thousands had to be\r\nrejected as ‘far too low.’ On March 8th the whole fifty-two guns of\r\nthe siege-train were reported ready, and the officer commanding the\r\nPortuguese artillery at Elvas announced that he could even find a small\r\nsupplement, six old heavy English iron guns of the time of George II,\r\nwhich had been in store there since General Burgoyne’s expedition of\r\n1761, besides some Portuguese guns of similar calibre. The old brass\r\nguns which had made such bad practice in 1811 were not this time\r\nrequisitioned--fortunately they were not needed. The garrison of Elvas\r\nhad for some weeks been at work making gabions and fascines, which\r\nwere all ready, as was also a large consignment of cutting-tools from\r\nthe Lisbon arsenal, and a train of twenty-two pontoons. Altogether the\r\nmaterial was in a wonderful state of completeness.\r\n\r\n  [251] For details see Jones, _Sieges of the Peninsula_, Appendix\r\n  in vol. i. pp. 421-5, and the _Dickson Papers_, ed. Leslie, for\r\n  Feb. 1812.\r\n\r\nFor the service of the siege Wellington could dispose of about 300\r\nBritish and 560 Portuguese artillerymen, a much larger force than had\r\nbeen available at the two unlucky leaguers of 1811. Colonel Framingham\r\nwas the senior officer in this arm present, but Wellington had directed\r\nthat Alexander Dickson should take charge of the whole service of the\r\nsiege, just as he had been entrusted with all the preparations for\r\nit. There were fifteen British, five German Legion, and seventeen\r\nPortuguese artillery officers under his command. The Portuguese gunners\r\nmostly came from the 3rd or Elvas regiment, the British were drawn from\r\nthe companies of Holcombe, Gardiner, Glubb, and Rettberg.[252] Under\r\nColonel Fletcher, senior engineer officer, there were 115 men of the\r\nRoyal Military Artificers present at the commencement of the siege, and\r\nan additional party came up from Cadiz during its last days. But though\r\nthis was an improvement over the state of things in 1811, the numbers\r\nwere still far too small; there were no trained miners whatever, and\r\nthe volunteers from the line acting as sappers, who were instructed by\r\nthe Artificers, were for the most part unskilful--only 120 men of the\r\n3rd Division who had been at work during the leaguer of Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nwere comparatively efficient. The engineer arm was the weak point in\r\nthe siege, as Wellington complained in a letter which will have to be\r\ndealt with in its proper place. He had already been urging on Lord\r\nLiverpool the absolute necessity for the creation of permanent units\r\nof men trained in the technicalities of siege-work. Soon after Rodrigo\r\nfell he wrote, ‘I would beg to suggest to your lordship the expediency\r\nof adding to the Engineer establishment a corps of sappers and miners.\r\nIt is inconceivable with what disadvantage we undertake a siege, for\r\nwant of assistance of this description. There is no French _corps\r\nd’armée_ which has not a battalion of sappers and a company of miners.\r\nWe are obliged to depend for assistance of this sort upon the regiments\r\nof the line; and, although the men are brave and willing, they want\r\nthe knowledge and training which are necessary. Many casualties occur,\r\nand much valuable time is lost at the most critical period of the\r\nsiege[253],’\r\n\r\n  [252] For details see Duncan’s _History of the Royal Artillery_,\r\n  ii. pp. 318-19.\r\n\r\n  [253] Wellington, _Dispatches_, viii. p. 601.\r\n\r\nThe situation on March 12th, save in this single respect, seemed\r\nfavourable. It was only fourteen miles from Elvas, where the\r\nsiege-train lay parked and the material was ready, to Badajoz.\r\nSufficient troops were already arrived not only to invest the place,\r\nbut to form a large covering army against any attempt of Soult to\r\nraise the siege. There was every reason to believe that the advance\r\nwould take the French unawares. Only Drouet’s two divisions were in\r\nEstremadura, and before they could be reinforced up to a strength\r\nwhich would enable them to act with effect some weeks must elapse.\r\nSoult, as in 1811, would have to borrow troops from Granada and the\r\nCadiz Lines before he could venture to take the offensive. Unless he\r\nshould raise the siege of Cadiz or evacuate Granada, he could not\r\ngather more than 25,000 or 30,000 men at the very most: and it would\r\ntake him three weeks to collect so many. If he approached with some\r\nsuch force, he could be fought, with very little risk: for it was not\r\nnow as at the time of Albuera: not three Anglo-Portuguese infantry\r\ndivisions, but eight were concentrated at Elvas: there would be nine\r\nwhen the 5th Division arrived. Not three British cavalry regiments\r\n(the weak point at Albuera), but fourteen were with the army. If Soult\r\nshould push forward for a battle, 40,000 men could be opposed to him,\r\nall Anglo-Portuguese units of old formation, while 15,000 men were\r\nleft to invest Badajoz. Or if Wellington should choose to abandon the\r\ninvestment for three days (as Beresford had done in May 1811) he could\r\nbring 55,000 men to the contest, a force which must crush Soult by the\r\nforce of double numbers, unless he should raise the siege of Cadiz and\r\nabandon Granada, so as to bring his whole army to the Guadiana. Even if\r\nhe took that desperate, but perhaps necessary, measure, and came with\r\n45,000 men, leaving only Seville garrisoned behind him, there was no\r\nreason to suppose that he could not be dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe only dangerous possibility was the intervention of Marmont with\r\nfive or six divisions of the Army of Portugal, as had happened at the\r\ntime of the operations on the Caya in June 1811. Wellington, as we\r\nhave seen in his directions to Baccelar and Castaños, thought this\r\nintervention probable. But from the disposition of Marmont’s troops\r\nat the moment of his own departure from Freneda, he thought that he\r\ncould count on three weeks, or a little more, of freedom from any\r\ninterference from this side. Two at least of Marmont’s divisions\r\n(Souham and Bonnet) would almost certainly be left in the North, to\r\ncontain the Galicians and Asturians. Of the other six only one (Foy)\r\nwas in the valley of the Tagus: the rest were scattered about, at\r\nSalamanca, Avila, Valladolid, &c., and would take time to collect[254].\r\nWellington was quite aware of Marmont’s difficulties with regard to\r\nmagazines; he also counted on the roughness of the roads, the fact that\r\nthe rivers were high in March, and (most of all) on the slowness with\r\nwhich information would reach the French marshal[255]. Still, here lay\r\nthe risk, so far as Wellington could know. What he could not guess\r\nwas that the movement which he feared had been expressly forbidden\r\nto Marmont by his master, and that only on March 27th was permission\r\ngranted to the Marshal to execute the march to Almaraz. By that time,\r\nas we have already seen, it was too late for him to profit by the\r\ntardily-granted leave.\r\n\r\n  [254] For Wellington’s speculations (fairly correct) as to\r\n  Marmont’s distribution of his troops, see _Dispatches_, viii. p.\r\n  618, Feb. 19, to Graham.\r\n\r\n  [255] Wellington to Victor Alten, March 5, _Dispatches_, viii. p.\r\n  649, makes a special point of ‘the difficulties which the enemy\r\n  experiences in getting intelligence’ as a means of gaining time\r\n  for himself.\r\n\r\nBut it was the possibility of Marmont’s appearance on the scene, rather\r\nthan anything which might be feared from Soult, which made the siege\r\nof Badajoz a time-problem, just as that of Ciudad Rodrigo had been.\r\nThe place must, if possible, be taken somewhere about the first week\r\nin April, the earliest date at which a serious attempt at relief was\r\nlikely to be made[256].\r\n\r\n  [256] Napier (iv. p. 98) tries to make out that Wellington’s\r\n  siege began ten days later than he wished and hoped, by the fault\r\n  of the Portuguese Regency. I cannot see how Badajoz could have\r\n  been invested on the 6th of March, when (as the route-directions\r\n  show) the head of the marching column from the Agueda only\r\n  reached Portalegre on the 8th. The movement of the army was not\r\n  delayed, so far as I can see, by the slackness of Portuguese\r\n  management at Lisbon or Elvas. But Wellington certainly grumbled.\r\n  Did he intend that Hill alone should invest Badajoz, before the\r\n  rest of the army arrived?\r\n\r\nOn March 14th, every preparation being complete, the pontoon train,\r\nwith a good escort, moved out of Elvas, and was brought up to a point\r\non the Guadiana four miles west of Badajoz, where it was laid without\r\nmolestation. On the next day Le Marchant’s heavy dragoons crossed, but\r\n(owing to an accident to one of the boats) no more troops. On the 16th,\r\nhowever, the 3rd, 4th, and Light Divisions passed, and invested Badajoz\r\nwithout meeting any opposition: the garrison kept within the walls,\r\nand did not even prevent Colonel Fletcher, the commanding engineer,\r\nfrom approaching for purposes of reconnaissance to the crest of the\r\nCerro de San Miguel, only 200 yards from the _enceinte_. The investing\r\ncorps of 12,000 bayonets was under Beresford, who had just returned\r\nfrom a short and stormy visit to Lisbon, where he had been harrying\r\nthe regency, at Wellington’s request, upon financial matters, and\r\nhad been dealing sternly with the Junta de Viveres, or Commissariat\r\nDepartment[257]. The situation had not been found a happy one. ‘After\r\na perfect investigation it appears that the expenditure must be nearly\r\n£6,000,000--the means at present are £3,500,000! A radical reform\r\ngrounded upon a bold and fearless inquiry into every branch of the\r\nrevenue, expenditure, and subsidy, and an addition to the latter\r\nfrom England, can alone put a period to these evils. To this Lord\r\nWellington, though late, is now turning his eyes. And when the Marshal,\r\nin conjunction with our ambassador, shall have made his report, it must\r\nbe _immediately_ acted upon--for there is no time to lose[258].’\r\n\r\n  [257] D’Urban’s diary, Feb. 7-16: he accompanied Beresford, being\r\n  his Chief-of-the-Staff.\r\n\r\n  [258] I spare the reader the question of Portuguese paper money\r\n  and English exchequer bills, which will be found treated at great\r\n  length in Napier, iv. pp. 97-9. Napier always appears to think\r\n  that cash could be had by asking for it at London, in despite of\r\n  the dreadful disappearance of the metallic currency and spread of\r\n  irredeemable bank-notes which prevailed in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe investment was only part of the general movements of the army on\r\nthe 16th. The covering-force was proceeding to take up its position in\r\ntwo sections. Graham with the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, and Slade’s\r\nand Le Marchant’s horse, crossed the Guadiana, and began to advance\r\ndown the high road to Seville, making for Santa Marta and Villafranca.\r\nHill with the other section, consisting of his own old troops of the\r\nEstremaduran army, the 2nd Division and Hamilton’s Portuguese, Long’s\r\nBritish and Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry, marched by the north bank\r\nof the Guadiana, via Montijo, towards Merida, which had not been\r\noccupied by either party since January 17th. These two columns, the\r\none 19,000, the other 14,000 strong, were to drive in the two French\r\ndivisions which were at this moment cantoned in Estremadura--Drouet\r\nwas known to be lying about Zafra and Llerena, covering the Seville\r\n_chaussée_, Daricau to have his troops at Zalamea and Los Hornachos,\r\nwatching the great passage of the Guadiana at Merida. As each division\r\nwith its attendant cavalry was not much over 6,000 strong, there was\r\nno danger of their combining so as to endanger either of the British\r\ncolumns. Each was strong enough to give a good account of itself. Hill\r\nand Graham were to push forward boldly, and drive their respective\r\nenemies before them as far as the Sierra Morena, so that Soult, when he\r\nshould come up from Seville (as he undoubtedly would in the course of a\r\nfew weeks), should have no foothold in the Estremaduran plain to start\r\nfrom, and would have to manœuvre back the containing force in his front\r\nall the way from the summit of the passes to Albuera.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two columns and the investing corps at Badajoz,\r\nWellington had a reserve of which some units had not yet come up,\r\nthough all were due in a few days, viz. the 5th Division, Pack’s and\r\nBradford’s independent Portuguese brigades, and the cavalry of Bock and\r\nAnson--about 12,000 men--: the last of them would be up by the 21st at\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nThere was still one more corps from which Wellington intended to get\r\nuseful assistance. This was the main body of the Spanish Army of\r\nEstremadura, the troops of Penne Villemur and Morillo, about 1,000\r\nhorse and 4,000 foot[259], which he destined to play the same part in\r\nthis campaign that Blake had played during the last siege of Badajoz.\r\nBy Castaños’s leave this little force had been moved from its usual\r\nhaunts by Caçeres and Valencia de Alcantara, behind the Portuguese\r\nfrontier, to the Lower Guadiana, from whence it was to enter the\r\nCondado de Niebla. It passed Redondo on March 17th on its way towards\r\nSan Lucar de Guadiana, feeding on magazines provided by its allies;\r\nPenne Villemur’s orders were that he should establish himself in the\r\nCondado (where there was still a small Spanish garrison at Ayamonte),\r\nand strike at Seville, the moment that he heard that Soult had gone\r\nnorth towards Estremadura. The city would be found ill-garrisoned by\r\nconvalescents, and _Juramentados_ of doubtful loyalty: if it were not\r\ncaptured, its danger would at any rate cause Soult to turn back, just\r\nas he had in June 1811, for he dared not lose his base and arsenal. It\r\nwas hoped that Ballasteros with his roving corps from the mountain of\r\nRonda would co-operate, when he found that the troops usually employed\r\nto ‘contain’ him had marched off. But Ballasteros was always a ‘law\r\nunto himself,’ and it was impossible to count upon him: he particularly\r\ndisliked suggestions from a British quarter, while Castaños was always\r\nsensible and obliging[260].\r\n\r\n  [259] The Conde had 1,114 horse and 3,638 foot on Jan. 1, not\r\n  including two of Morillo’s battalions then absent. The total\r\n  force used for the raid was probably as above.\r\n\r\n  [260] Details in a dispatch to Colonel Austin of March 15,\r\n  _Dispatches_, viii, p. 666. General scheme in a letter to\r\n  Castaños of Feb. 16. Ibid., p. 614.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the operations of the actual siege of Badajoz,\r\nwhich require to be studied in continuous sequence, it may be well to\r\ndeal with those of the covering corps.\r\n\r\nGraham marched in two columns, one division by Albuera, two by\r\nAlmendral. He ran against the outposts of Drouet at Santa Marta, from\r\nwhich a battalion and a few cavalry hastily retired to Villafranca,\r\nwhere it was reported that Drouet himself was lying. Graham judged\r\nthat the French general would probably retire towards Llerena by the\r\nmain road, and hoped to harass, if not to surprise him, by a forced\r\nnight march on that place. This was executed in the night of the\r\n18th-19th, but proved a disappointment: the vanguard of the British\r\ncolumn entered Llerena only to find it empty--Drouet had retired\r\nnot southward but eastward, so as to get into touch with Daricau’s\r\ndivision at Zalamea--he had gone off by Ribera to Los Hornachos. Graham\r\nthereupon halted his main body at Zafra, with the cavalry out as far\r\nas Usagre and Fuente Cantos. A dispatch from Drouet to his brigadier\r\nReymond was intercepted on the 21st, and showed that the latter, with\r\nfour battalions at Fregenal, had been cut off from his chief by the\r\nirruption of the British down the high-road, and was ordered to rejoin\r\nhim by way of Llerena. Graham thought that he might catch this little\r\nforce, so withdrew his cavalry from Llerena, in order that Reymond\r\nmight make his way thither unmolested, and be caught in a trap by\r\nseveral British brigades converging upon him by a night march. This\r\noperation, executed on the night of the 25th, unfortunately miscarried.\r\nThe French actually entered Llerena, but as the columns were closing in\r\nupon them an unlucky accident occurred. Graham and his staff, riding\r\nahead of the 7th Division, ran into a cavalry picket, which charged\r\nthem. They came back helter-skelter on to the leading battalion of\r\nthe infantry, which fired promiscuously into the mass, killed two\r\nstaff officers, and nearly shot their general[261]. The noise of\r\nthis outburst of fire, and the return of their own dragoons, warned\r\nthe 1,800 French in Llerena, who escaped by a mountain path towards\r\nGuadalcanal, and did not lose a man.\r\n\r\n  [261] ‘Something too like a panic was occasioned at the head of\r\n  the 7th by the appearance of the few French dragoons and the\r\n  galloping back of the staff and orderlies. A confused firing\r\n  broke out down the column without object! Mem.--Even British\r\n  troops should not be allowed to load before a night attack.’\r\n  D’Urban’s diary, March 26.\r\n\r\nImprobable as it would have been judged, Drouet had abandoned the\r\nSeville road altogether, and gone off eastward. His only communication\r\nwith Soult would have to be by Cordova: clearly he had refused to\r\nbe cut off from Daricau: possibly he may have hoped to await in the\r\ndirection of Zalamea and Castuera the arrival of troops from the Army\r\nof Portugal, coming down by Truxillo and Medellin from Almaraz. For\r\nSoult and his generals appear to have had no notice of the Emperor’s\r\nprohibition to Marmont to send troops to Estremadura. On the other\r\nhand the Duke of Ragusa had written, in perfect good faith, before\r\nhe received the imperial rescript, that he should come to the aid of\r\nBadajoz with four or five divisions, as in June 1811, if the place were\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Graham resolved to pursue Drouet eastward, even hoping\r\nthat he might slip in to the south of him, and drive him northward\r\nin the direction of Merida and Medellin, where he would have fallen\r\ninto the arms of Hill’s column. He had reached Llera and La Higuera\r\nwhen he intercepted another letter--this time from General Reymond\r\nto Drouet; that officer, after escaping from Llerena on the night of\r\nthe 25th-26th, had marched to Azuaga, where he had picked up another\r\ndetachment under General Quiot. He announced that he was making the\r\nbest of his way towards Fuente Ovejuna, behind the main crest of the\r\nSierra Morena, by which circuitous route he hoped to join his chief.\r\n\r\nGraham thought that he had now another opportunity of surprising\r\nReymond, while he was marching across his front, and swerving southward\r\nagain made a second forced night march on Azuaga. It failed, like that\r\non Llerena three days before--the French, warned by _Afrancesados_,\r\nleft in haste, and Graham’s exhausted troops only arrived in time to\r\nsee them disappear.\r\n\r\nReymond’s column was joined next day at Fuente Ovejuna by Drouet and\r\nDaricau, so that the whole of the French force in Estremadura was\r\nnow concentrated--but in an unfavourable position, since they were\r\ncompletely cut off from Seville, and could only retire on Cordova if\r\nfurther pressed. Should Soult wish to join them with his reserves, he\r\nwould have to march up the Guadalquivir, losing four or five days.\r\n\r\nGraham and his staff were flattering themselves that they had won a\r\nconsiderable strategical advantage in this matter, when they were\r\ndisappointed, by receiving, on March 30, a dispatch from Wellington\r\nprohibiting any further pursuit of Drouet, or any longer stay on the\r\nslopes of the Sierra Morena. The column was ordered to come back and\r\ncanton itself about Fuente del Maestre, Almendralejo, and Villafranca.\r\nBy April 2nd the three divisions were established in these places.\r\nTheir recall would seem to have been caused by Wellington’s knowledge\r\nthat Soult had by now concentrated a heavy force at Seville, and that\r\nif he advanced suddenly by the great _chaussée_, past Monasterio and\r\nFuente Cantos, Graham might be caught in a very advanced position\r\nbetween him and Drouet, and find a difficulty in retreating to join\r\nthe main body of the army for a defensive battle on the Albuera\r\nposition[262].\r\n\r\n  [262] For details of this forgotten campaign I rely mainly on\r\n  D’Urban’s unpublished diary. As he knew Estremadura well, from\r\n  having served there with Beresford in 1811, he was lent to\r\n  Graham, and rode with his staff to advise about roads and the\r\n  resources of the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hill, with the other half of the covering army, had been\r\nspending a less eventful fortnight. He reached Merida on March 17\r\nand found it unoccupied. Drouet was reported to be at Villafranca,\r\nDaricau to be lying with his troops spread wide between Medellin, Los\r\nHornachos, and Zalamea. Hill crossed the Guadiana and marched to look\r\nfor them: his first march was on Villafranca, but Drouet had already\r\nslipped away from that point, avoiding Graham’s column. Hill then\r\nturned in search of Daricau, and drove one of his brigades out of Don\r\nBenito near Medellin. The bulk of the French division then went off to\r\nthe south-east, and ultimately joined Drouet at Fuente Ovejuna, though\r\nit kept a rearguard at Castuera. Hill did not pursue, but remained in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Merida and Medellin, to guard these two great\r\npassages of the Guadiana against any possible appearance of Marmont’s\r\ntroops from the direction of Almaraz and Truxillo. Wellington (it will\r\nbe remembered) had believed that Marmont would certainly come down with\r\na considerable force by this route, and (being ignorant of Napoleon’s\r\norder to the Marshal) was expecting him to be heard of from day to day.\r\nAs a matter of fact only Foy’s single division was in the Tagus valley\r\nat Talavera: that officer kept receiving dispatches for his chief from\r\nDrouet and Soult, imploring that Marmont should move south without\r\ndelay. This was impossible, as Foy knew; but he became so troubled\r\nby the repeated requests that he thought of marching, on his own\r\nresponsibility, to try to join Drouet. This became almost impracticable\r\nwhen Drouet and Daricau withdrew southward to the borders of Andalusia:\r\nbut Foy then thought of executing a demonstration on Truxillo, on his\r\nown account, hoping that it might at least distract Wellington. On\r\nApril 4 he wrote to Drouet that he was about to give out that he was\r\nMarmont’s advanced guard, and to march, with 3,000 men only, on that\r\npoint, leaving the rest of his division in garrison at Talavera and\r\nAlmaraz; he would be at Truxillo on the 9th[263]. If he had started\r\na week earlier, he would have fallen into the hands of Hill, who was\r\nwaiting for him at Merida with four times his force. But the news of\r\nthe fall of Badajoz on the 6th reached him in time to prevent him from\r\nrunning into the lion’s mouth. Otherwise, considering Hill’s enterprise\r\nand Foy’s complete lack of cavalry, there might probably have been\r\nsomething like a repetition of the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos.\r\n\r\n  [263] The letter may be found in King Joseph’s _Correspondance_,\r\n  viii. pp. 345-6. See also Girod de l’Ain’s _Vie militaire du\r\n  Général Foy_, pp. 368-9.\r\n\r\nSo much for the covering armies--it now remains to be seen how\r\nWellington dealt with Badajoz, in the three weeks during which Graham\r\nand Hill were keeping the peace for him in southern and eastern\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\nOn surveying the fortress upon March 16th the British engineers found\r\nthat it had been considerably strengthened since the last siege in\r\nJune 1811. Fort San Cristobal had been vastly improved--its glacis\r\nand counterscarp had been raised, and a strong redoubt (called by the\r\nFrench the Lunette Werlé, after the general killed at Albuera) had been\r\nthrown up on the rising slope where Beresford’s breaching batteries\r\nhad stood, so that this ground would have to be won before it could be\r\nagain utilized. On the southern side of the Guadiana the Castle had\r\nbeen provided with many more guns, and some parts of the precipitous\r\nmound on which it stood had been scarped. The breach of 1811 had been\r\nmost solidly built up. No danger was feared in this quarter--it was\r\nregarded as the strongest part of the defences. The approach toward\r\nthe much more accessible bastions just below the Castle had been made\r\ndifficult, by damming the Rivillas stream: its bridge near the San\r\nRoque gate had been built up, and the accumulated water made a broad\r\npool which lay under the bastions of San Pedro and La Trinidad; its\r\noverflow had been turned into the ditch in front of San Pedro, and, by\r\ncutting a _cunette_ or channel, a deep but narrow water obstruction had\r\nbeen formed in front of the Trinidad also--the broad dry ditch having a\r\nnarrow wet ditch sunk in its bottom just below the counterscarp. This\r\ninundation was destined to give great trouble to the besiegers. The\r\nPardaleras fort had been connected with the city by a well-protected\r\ntrench between high earthen banks. Finally the three bastions on the\r\nsouth side next the river, San Vincente, San José, and Santiago, had\r\nbeen strengthened by demi-lunes, which they had hitherto lacked, and\r\nalso by driving a system of mines from their counterscarps under the\r\nglacis: these were to be exploded if the besiegers should push up their\r\ntrenches and breaching batteries close to the walls on this side,\r\nwhich was one of the weakest in the city, since it was not covered,\r\nas were the other fronts, by outlying works like the Pardaleras and\r\nPicurina forts or the San Roque lunette. The existence of this series\r\nof mines was revealed to the besiegers by a French sergeant-major of\r\nsappers, a skilful draughtsman, who had been employed in mapping out\r\nthe works. Having been insulted, as he conceived, by his captain,\r\nand refused redress by the governor, he fled to the British camp in\r\na rage, and placed his map (where the mines are very clearly shown)\r\nand his services at the disposition of Wellington[264]. The identical\r\nmap, a very neat piece of work, lies before me as I write these lines,\r\nhaving passed into the possession of General D’Urban, the chief of\r\nthe Portuguese staff. It was in consequence of their knowledge of\r\nthese defences that the British engineers left the San Vincente front\r\nalone[265].\r\n\r\n  [264] This man is mentioned in Wellington’s Dispatches, viii.\r\n  p. 609: ‘The _Sergent-major des Sapeurs_ and _Adjudant des\r\n  travaux_ and the French miner may be sent in charge of a steady\r\n  non-commissioned officer to Estremoz, there to wait till I send\r\n  for them.’\r\n\r\n  [265] This renegade’s name must have been Bonin, or Bossin: I\r\n  cannot read with certainty his extraordinary signature, with a\r\n  _paraphe_, at the bottom of his map. The English engineers used\r\n  it, and have roughly sketched in their own works of the third\r\n  siege on top of the original coloured drawing.\r\n\r\nThe garrison on March 15th consisted of five battalions of French\r\nregulars, one each from certain regiments belonging to Conroux,\r\nLeval, Drouet, and Daricau (2,767 men), of two battalions of the\r\nHesse-Darmstadt regiment of the Rheinbund division of the Army of the\r\nCentre (910 men), three companies of artillery (261 men), two and a\r\nhalf companies of sappers (260 men), a handful of cavalry (42 men), a\r\ncompany of Spanish Juramentados, and (by casual chance) the escort of\r\na convoy which had entered the city two days before the siege began.\r\nThe whole (excluding non-combatants, medical and commissariat staff,\r\n&c.) made up 4,700 men, not more than an adequate provision for such\r\na large place. The governor, Phillipon, the commandants of artillery\r\nand engineers (the last-named, Lamare, was the historian of the three\r\nsieges of Badajoz), and nearly all the staff had been in the fortress\r\nfor more than a year. The battalions of the garrison (though not the\r\nsame as those who had sustained the assaults of 1811) had been many\r\nmonths settled in the place, and knew it almost as well as did the\r\nstaff. They were all picked troops, including the German regiment,\r\nwhich had an excellent record. But undoubtedly the greatest factor\r\nin the defence was the ingenuity and resource of the governor, which\r\nsurpassed all praise: oddly enough Phillipon did not show himself a\r\nvery skilful mover of troops in the field, when commanding a division\r\nin the Army of Germany in 1813, after his capture and exchange: but\r\nbehind the walls of Badajoz he was unsurpassable[266].\r\n\r\n  [266] When he commanded the 1st Division of the 1st Corps\r\n  under Vandamme, and was present when that corps was nearly all\r\n  destroyed on Aug. 30, 1813, at Culm.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of attack which Wellington, under the advice of his\r\nengineers, employed against Badajoz in March 1812 differed entirely\r\nfrom that of May-June 1811. The fact that the whole was a time-problem\r\nremained the same: the danger that several of the French armies might,\r\nif leisure were granted them, unite for its relief, was as clear as\r\never. But the idea that the best method of procedure was to assail\r\nthe most commanding points of the fortress, whose capture would make\r\nthe rest untenable, was completely abandoned. Fort San Cristobal and\r\nthe lofty Castle were on this occasion to be left alone altogether.\r\nThe former was only observed by a single Portuguese brigade (first\r\nDa Costa’s and later Power’s). The second was not breached, or even\r\nbattered with any serious intent. This time the front of attack was to\r\nbe the bastions of Santa Maria and La Trinidad, on the south-eastern\r\nside of the town. The reason for leaving those of San Vincente and\r\nSan José, on the south-western side, unassailed--though they were\r\nmore accessible, and defended by no outer forts--was apparently the\r\nreport of the renegade French sergeant-major spoken of above; ‘they\r\nwere countermined, and therefore three or four successive lodgements\r\nwould have to be formed against them[267].’ To attack Santa Maria\r\nand the Trinidad a preliminary operation was necessary--they were\r\ncovered by the Picurina fort, and only from the knoll on which that\r\nwork stands could they be battered with effect. The Picurina was far\r\nweaker than the Pardaleras fort, from whose site a similar advantage\r\ncould be got against the bastions of San Roque and San Juan. It must\r\ntherefore be stormed, and on its emplacement would be fixed the\r\nbatteries of the second parallel, which were to do the main work of\r\nbreaching. The exceptional advantage to be secured in this way was that\r\nthe counterguard (inner protective bank) within the _glacis_ of the\r\nTrinidad bastion was reputed to be so low, that from the Picurina knoll\r\nthe scarp of the bastion could be seen almost to its foot, and could\r\nbe much more effectively battered than any part of the defences whose\r\nupper section alone was visible to the besieger.\r\n\r\n  [267] Jones, _Sieges of the Peninsula_, i. p. 163.\r\n\r\nDespite, therefore, of the need for wasting no time, and of the fact\r\nthat the preliminary operations against the Picurina must cost a day or\r\ntwo, this was the general plan of attack adopted. The investment had\r\nbeen completed on the evening of the 16th: on the same day 120 carts\r\nwith stores of all kinds marched from Elvas, and on the 17th these were\r\nalready being deposited in the Engineers’ Park, behind the Cerro de San\r\nMiguel, whose rounded top completely screened the preparations from the\r\nsight of the garrison.\r\n\r\nThe besieged had no notion whatever as to the front which would, on\r\nthis third attempt, be selected for the attack of the British. The\r\nelaborate fortifications and improvements made in the Castle and San\r\nCristobal tend to show that these old points of attack were expected\r\nto be once more assailed. Hence the besiegers got the inestimable\r\nadvantage of an unmolested start on the night of March 17th. Colonel\r\nFletcher had risked the dangers of drawing the first parallel at a very\r\nshort distance from the Picurina fort. On a night of tempestuous rain\r\nand high wind, a parallel 600 yards long was picketed out, on a line\r\nranging only from 160 to 200 yards from the covered-way of the work,\r\nand 1,800 workmen in the course of the night threw up the parallel, and\r\n4,000 feet of a communication-trench, leading backward to the head of\r\na ravine in the hill of San Miguel, which gave good cover for bringing\r\nmen and material up from the rear. Not a shot was fired by the French\r\nall through the night, and at dawn the parallel and approach were\r\nalready 3 feet deep and 3 feet 6 inches wide--a good start.\r\n\r\nWith daylight the enemy discovered what had been done, and opened a\r\nfurious fire both of cannon and musketry upon the trenches. The three\r\nnearest bastions of the fortress joined in with their heavy guns,\r\nbut the 18th was a day of such constant rain that even at a distance\r\nof only 500 or 600 yards it was impossible to see much, or take\r\naccurate aim at the trenches. The working parties went on deepening\r\nand improving the parallel and the communication behind it, without\r\nsuffering any great loss.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 18th-19th they were able to trace out and begin\r\ntwo batteries, destined to breach the Picurina, in the line of the\r\nparallel, and to extend it at both ends, from the Rivillas on one side\r\nto the foot of the hill of San Miguel on the other.\r\n\r\nThis was visible on the following morning, and Phillipon thought the\r\nprospects of the fort so bad that he resolved to risk a sortie, to\r\ndestroy at all costs the trenches which were so dangerously near to\r\ntheir objective. At midday two battalions--1,000 men--starting from the\r\nlunette of San Roque, dashed up the hill, got into the north end of the\r\nparallel, and drove out the working parties for a distance of some 500\r\nyards: they carried off many entrenching tools, for which the governor\r\nhad offered the _bonus_ of one dollar a piece. But they had no time to\r\ndo any serious damage to the parallel, for the guard of the trenches\r\nand the working parties, rallying fifty yards up the hill, came down\r\non them in force, within a quarter of an hour, and evicted them again\r\nafter a sharp tussle. The loss on the two sides was very different--the\r\nBritish lost 150 men, the besieged 304, of whom many were drowned in\r\nthe inundation, while trying to take short cuts through it to the\r\ngates. The effect of the sortie had been practically _nil_, as far as\r\ndestroying the works went. During this skirmish Colonel Fletcher was\r\nwounded in the groin by a ball, which hit his purse, and while failing\r\nto penetrate further, forced a dollar-piece an inch into his thigh. He\r\nwas confined to his tent for some fourteen days, and his subordinates,\r\nMajors Squire and Burgoyne, had to take up his duty, though Wellington\r\nordered that he should still retain nominal charge of the work, and\r\nconsulted him daily upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the next night (March 20th) the parallel and approach against the\r\nPicurina being practically complete, and only the battery emplacements\r\nin it requiring to be finished, the engineers of the besieging army\r\nresolved to continue the line of trenches into the flat ground in\r\nfront of the Bastion of San Pedro and the Castle, it being intended\r\nthat batteries should be constructed here to play on the Trinidad and\r\nthe neighbouring parts of the fortress, when the Picurina should have\r\nfallen. It would save time to have everything ready on this side, when\r\nthe fort should have been mastered. Trouble at once began--not only\r\nfrom the enemy’s fire, which swept all this low ground, but still more\r\nfrom the continuous bad weather. The rain which had easily run away\r\nfrom the sloping trenches on the Cerro de San Miguel, lodged in the\r\nnew works, could not be drained off, and melted away the earth as fast\r\nas it was thrown up. Mud cast into the gabions ran off in the form of\r\nslimy water, and the parapets could only be kept upright by building\r\nthem of sandbags. The men were actually flooded out of the trenches\r\nby the accumulated water, which was almost knee deep. In the rear the\r\nGuadiana rose, and washed away the two bridges which connected the army\r\nwith its base at Elvas. The deluge lasted four days and was a terrible\r\nhindrance, it being impossible to finish the parallel in the low\r\nground, or to begin moving the battering-guns, even those destined for\r\nthe long-completed batteries on the Cerro de San Miguel.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the afternoon of the 24th that fine weather at last\r\nset in; this permitted the guns to be brought at once into the two\r\nbatteries facing the Picurina, and, after herculean efforts, into other\r\nbatteries (nos. 4 and 5) in the low ground also. Three days at least\r\nhad been lost from the vile weather.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 25th all the batteries opened simultaneously,\r\nten guns against the Picurina, eighteen against the parts of the\r\nfortress behind it. The fort was completely silenced, as was the little\r\nlunette of San Roque. Not much damage appeared to have been inflicted\r\non the Picurina beyond the breaking of many of its palisades, and the\r\ndegradation of its salient angle. But Wellington ordered that it should\r\nbe stormed that night, in order that he might make up for the lost time\r\nof the 20th-24th.\r\n\r\nThe storm was duly carried out by General Kempt and 500 men of the\r\nLight and the 3rd Divisions, at ten o’clock that night. It was a\r\ndesperate affair, for the ditch was deep, and not in the least filled\r\nwith rubbish, and the scarp was intact save at the extreme salient\r\nangle. Though the garrison’s guns had been silenced, they kept up a\r\nfurious fire of musketry, which disabled 100 men before the stormers\r\nreached the ditch. The main hope of the assault had been that two\r\nturning columns might break in at the gorge: but it was found so\r\nstrongly closed, with a double row of palisades and a cutting, that all\r\nefforts to force an entrance were repelled with loss. Baffled here,\r\none party tried the desperate expedient of casting three long ladders,\r\nnot into, but _across_ the ditch on the right flank of the fort, which\r\nthough deep was not so broad but that a 30-foot ladder would reach from\r\nits lip to the row of fraises, or projecting beams, ranged horizontally\r\nat the top of the scarp some feet below the brim of the parapet. The\r\nladders sagged down but did not break, and some fifty men headed by\r\nCaptain Oates of the 88th ran across on the rungs and got a lodgement\r\ninside the fort. At the same moment General Kempt launched the reserve\r\nof the storming party--100 men, mostly from the 2/83rd and headed by\r\nCaptain Powys of that regiment--at the exact salient of the fort, the\r\nonly place where it was seriously damaged, and succeeded in breaking\r\nin. The garrison, who made a stubborn resistance, were overpowered--83\r\nwere killed or wounded, the governor, Colonel Gaspard-Thierry, and 145\r\ntaken prisoners, only 1 officer and 40 men escaped into the town. The\r\nlosses of the stormers had been over 50 per cent. of the men engaged!\r\nFour officers and 50 rank and file were killed, 15 officers and 250 men\r\nwounded, out of a little over 500 who joined in the assault. Phillipon\r\ntried a sortie from the lunette of San Roque, just as the fort fell, in\r\nhopes to recover it: but the battalion which came out was easily beaten\r\noff by the fire of the men in the trenches to the right, and lost 50\r\nkilled and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe last stage of the siege had now been reached. By capturing\r\nthe Picurina on its commanding knoll, the British had established\r\nthemselves within 400 yards of the Trinidad and 450 yards of the Santa\r\nMaria bastions, which they could batter with every advantage of slope\r\nand ground. But it was a very costly business to make the necessary\r\nlodgement in the ruined fort, to demolish it, and throw its earth in\r\nthe reverse direction, and to build in its gorge the two batteries\r\n(nos. 8, 9), which were to breach the body of the place. The fire of\r\nthree bastions bore directly on the spot where the batteries were to\r\nbe placed, and there was also a most deadly enfilading fire from the\r\nhigh-lying Castle, and even from the distant San Cristobal. Though the\r\nthree batteries in the flat ground (to which a fourth was presently\r\nadded) endeavoured to silence this fire, they only succeeded in doing\r\nso very imperfectly, for the French kept replacing one gun by another,\r\nfrom their ample store, when any were disabled. From the 26th to the\r\n30th four days were employed in building the Picurina batteries, with\r\ngreat loss of life all the time, which fell mainly on the engineer\r\nofficers who were directing the work and on the sappers under their\r\norders. The French covered the whole of the Picurina knoll with such\r\na hail of projectiles that no amount of cover seemed to guarantee\r\nthose labouring in it from sudden death. When the batteries had been\r\ncompleted, the bringing forward of the guns and the ammunition cost\r\nmany lives more. Twice there were considerable explosions of powder,\r\nwhile the magazines in the batteries were being filled.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, on March 30, one of the two new batteries in the\r\ngorge of the Picurina was able to open, and on the 31st the other\r\nfollowed suit, supported by a third supplementary battery (no. 7),\r\nplanned under the left flank of the fort. The practice was excellent,\r\nbut at first the effect was not all that had been hoped: the Trinidad\r\nand the Santa Maria bastions were solidly built and resisted well. On\r\nApril 2, however, both began to show considerable and obvious injury,\r\nand it was clear that a few days more would ruin them. But there was\r\none serious _contretemps_: the inundation between the Picurina and the\r\nfortress showed no signs of going down--it had been swollen by the\r\nrains of the 20th-24th, and could not flow away so long as the dam at\r\nthe lunette of San Roque kept it back. While the water was held up,\r\nthe breaches, soon about to develop, could only be got at by a narrow\r\nand curved route, between the inundation and the steep slope on which\r\nstands the Pardaleras. It had been intended that the assault should be\r\ndelivered from the trenches, but this was impossible till the Rivillas\r\nshould have fallen to its usual insignificant breadth and depth. Hence\r\nefforts were made to burst the dam at all costs, but neither did\r\nartillery fire suffice, nor a venturesome expedition on the night of\r\nthe 2nd of April by the engineer Lieutenant Stanway and 20 sappers, who\r\nslipped down the ravine and laid powder-bags against the dam, despite\r\nof the French fire. The powder exploded, but did not do its work. For\r\nseveral days an attempt was made to sap down to the dam from the second\r\nparallel. But it cost so many lives at the head of the sap, and the\r\nzig-zags advanced so slowly, that on the 3rd of April the attempt was\r\ngiven up, and it was determined that the breaches must be assaulted\r\nfrom the west bank of the Rivillas only.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two breaches, the larger one in the front of the Trinidad\r\nbastion, the smaller in the flank of the Santa Maria, began to be very\r\napparent, and gave good hope to the besiegers. The French, however,\r\ndelayed their progress by the most gallant efforts: 200 men worked in\r\nthe ditch after dark, to clear away the débris that was falling into\r\nit. This they did under constant artillery fire from the batteries,\r\nwhich played on the ditch with grape at intervals in the night, and\r\nkilled scores of the workmen. They also deepened the ditch at the foot\r\nof the counterscarp, till it was 18 feet from the covered-way to the\r\nbottom of its level. The ruined parapets were built up every night\r\nwith earth and wool-packs, only to be destroyed again every morning.\r\nThe garrison began to feel uncomfortable, for not only was the loss of\r\nlife great, but the furious fire, by which they strove to keep down the\r\nefficiency of the siege-batteries, had begun to tell so much on their\r\nreserves of ammunition that, by April 3, there was no common shell\r\nleft, and very little grape--of the round-shot much more than half had\r\nbeen expended. Phillipon was obliged to order the artillerymen to be\r\nsparing, or a few days more would leave him helpless. As the French\r\nfire slackened, that of the besiegers grew more intense, and Wellington\r\nput forward the last twelve guns of his siege-park, hitherto reserved,\r\nto form some new supplementary batteries on the right of his line [nos.\r\n10, 11, 12].\r\n\r\nOn April 4th the breaches were both growing practicable, and news from\r\nthe South warned Wellington that he must hurry; Soult was at last over\r\nthe Sierra Morena with all the troops that he could scrape together\r\nfrom Andalusia. It was lucky indeed that Marmont was not marching to\r\njoin Soult, but was executing a raid into central Portugal, not by\r\nhis own wish but by the special orders of the Emperor, as has already\r\nbeen explained elsewhere. His irruption into the Beira was absolutely\r\ndisregarded by Wellington: for as long as the two French armies were\r\nnot united, the British commander did not much fear either of them.\r\nStill, if Soult came close up to Badajoz, it would be necessary to send\r\npart of the siege-troops to join the covering force--and this would be\r\ninconvenient. Wherefore Wellington resolved to strike at once, while\r\nSoult was still four or five marches away.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th the breaches, both in the Trinidad and in Santa Maria,\r\nlooked practicable--on the morning of the 5th they were certainly so.\r\nBut the question was raised as to whether the mere practicability of\r\nthe breaches was enough to ensure success--it was clearly made out that\r\nthe garrisons were building a semicircular inner retrenchment among the\r\nhouses of the town, which would cut off the breaches, and give a second\r\nline of resistance. Moreover Colonel Fletcher, who was just out of bed,\r\nhis wound of the 19th March being on the mend, reported from personal\r\nobservation that it was clear that all manner of obstacles were being\r\naccumulated behind both breaches, and every preparation made for a\r\ndesperate defence of them. Wherefore Wellington ordered the storm to\r\nbe put off for a day, and turned two batteries on to a new spot, where\r\nSpanish informants reported that the wall of the curtain was badly\r\nbuilt, between Santa Maria and the Trinidad. So true was this report,\r\nthat a very few hours battering on the morning of the 6th made a third\r\nbreach at this point, as practicable as either of the others.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the enemy from getting time to retrench this third opening\r\ninto the town, the storm was ordered for 7.30 o’clock on the same\r\nevening--it would have been well if the hour had been kept as first\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STORM OF BADAJOZ. APRIL 6, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangements which Wellington made for the assault--a business\r\nwhich he knew would be costly, and not absolutely certain of\r\nsuccess--were as follows.\r\n\r\nThe Light and 4th Divisions were told off for the main attack at\r\nthe three breaches. They were forced to make it on the narrow front\r\nwest of the Rivillas, because the inundation cramped their approach\r\non the right. The 4th Division, under Colville, was to keep nearest\r\nto that water, and to assail the breach in the Trinidad bastion and\r\nalso the new breach in the curtain to its left. The Light Division\r\nwas to devote itself to the breach in the flank of Santa Maria. Each\r\ndivision was to provide an advance of 500 men, with which went twelve\r\nladders and a party carrying hay-bags to cast into the ditch. For the\r\ncounterscarp not being ruined, it was clear that there would be a very\r\ndeep jump into the depths. The two divisions followed in columns of\r\nbrigades, each with a British brigade leading, the Portuguese in the\r\ncentre, and the other British brigade in the rear. Neither division was\r\nquite complete--the 4th having to provide the guard of the trenches\r\nthat night, while the Light Division detached some of its rifles, to\r\ndistract the attention of the enemy in the bastions to the left, by\r\nlying down on the glacis and firing into the embrasures when their\r\ncannon should open. Hence the Light Division put only 3,000, the 4th\r\n3,500 men into the assault. When the breaches were carried, the Light\r\nDivision was to wheel to the left, the 4th to the right, and to sweep\r\nalong the neighbouring bastions on each side. A reserve was to be left\r\nat the quarries below the Pardaleras height, and called up when it was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main assault two subsidiary attacks were to be\r\nmade--a third (as we shall see) was added at the last moment. The\r\nguards of the trenches, furnished by the 4th Division, were to try to\r\nrush the lunette of San Roque, which was in a dilapidated condition,\r\nand were to cut away the dam if successful. A much more serious matter\r\nwas that, on the express petition of General Picton, he was allowed to\r\nmake an attempt to take the Castle by _escalade_. This daring officer\r\nargued that all the attention of the enemy would be concentrated on\r\nthe breaches, and that the Castle was in itself so strong that it was\r\nprobable the governor would only leave a minimum garrison in it. He had\r\nmarked spots in its front where the walls were comparatively low, owing\r\nto the way in which the rocky and grassy slope at its foot ran up and\r\ndown. The escalade was to be a surprise--the division was to cross the\r\nRivillas at a point far below the inundation, where the ruins of a mill\r\nspanned the stream, and was to drag ladders up the steep mound to the\r\nfoot of the wall.\r\n\r\nTwo demonstrations, or false attacks, were to be made with the\r\nintention of distracting the enemy--one by Power’s Portuguese brigade\r\nbeyond the Guadiana, who were to threaten an escalade on the fort\r\nat the bridge-head: the other by the Portuguese of the 5th Division\r\nagainst the Pardaleras. At the last moment--the order does not appear\r\nin the full draft of the directions for the storm--Leith, commanding\r\nthe 5th Division, was told that he might try an escalade, similar to\r\nthat allotted to Picton, against the river-bastion of San Vincente, the\r\nextreme north-west point of the defences, and one that had hitherto\r\nbeen left entirely untouched by the besiegers. For this he was to\r\nemploy one of his two British brigades, leaving the other in reserve.\r\n\r\nEvery student of the Peninsular War knows the unexpected result of the\r\nstorm: the regular assault on the breaches failed with awful loss, but\r\nall the three subsidiary attacks, on San Roque, the Castle, and San\r\nVincente, succeeded in the most brilliant style, so that Badajoz was\r\nduly taken, but not in the way that Wellington intended.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the main assault failed was purely and simply that\r\nPhillipon and his garrison put into the defence of the breaches\r\nnot only the most devoted courage, but such an accumulation of\r\ningenious devices as had never before been seen in a siege of that\r\ngeneration--apparently Phillipon must share the credit with his\r\ncommanding engineer, Lamare, the historian of the siege. The normal\r\nprecaution of cutting off the breaches by retrenchments on both sides,\r\nand of throwing up parapets of earth, sandbags, and wool-packs behind\r\nthem, was the least part of the work done. What turned out more\r\neffective was a series of mines and explosive barrels planted at the\r\nfoot of the counterscarp, and connected with the ramparts by covered\r\ntrains. This was on the near side of the ditch, where there was dead\r\nground unsearched by the besiegers’ artillery. In the bottom of it,\r\nand at the foot of the breaches, had been placed or thrown all manner\r\nof large cumbrous obstacles, carts and barrows turned upside down,\r\nseveral large damaged boats, some rope entanglements, and piles of\r\nbroken gabions and fascines. The slopes of the breaches had been strewn\r\nwith crowsfeet, and were covered with beams studded with nails, not\r\nfixed, but hung by ropes from the lip of the breach; in some places\r\nharrows, and doors studded with long spikes, were set upon the slope.\r\nAt the top of each breach was a device never forgotten by any observer,\r\nthe _chevaux de frise_, formed of cavalry sword-blades[268] set in\r\nfoot-square beams, and chained down at their ends. For the defence of\r\nthe three breaches Phillipon had told off 700 men, composed of the\r\nlight and grenadier companies of each of his battalions, plus the\r\nfour fusilier companies of the 103rd Line--about 1,200 men in all. A\r\nbattalion of the 88th was in the cathedral square behind, as general\r\nreserve. The two Hessian battalions were on the left, holding the\r\nCastle, the lunette of San Roque, and the San Pedro bastion. The three\r\nother French battalions occupied the long range of bastions from San\r\nJuan to San Vincente. As there had been many casualties, the total of\r\nthe available men had sunk to about 4,000, and since nearly half of\r\nthem were concentrated at or behind the breaches, the guard was rather\r\nthin at other points--especially (as Picton had calculated) at the\r\nCastle, which, though its front was long, was held by only 250 men,\r\nmostly Hessians.\r\n\r\n  [268] These swords were those of the large body of Spanish\r\n  dismounted cavalry which had surrendered at the capitulation in\r\n  March 1811.\r\n\r\nIt was a most unfortunate thing that the time of the assault,\r\noriginally fixed for 7.30, was put off till 10--and that the\r\nsiege-batteries slacked down after dark. For the two hours thus\r\ngranted to the besieged were well spent in repairing and strengthening\r\nall their devices for defence. An earlier assault would have found the\r\npreparations incomplete, especially in the matter of the combustibles\r\nplaced in the ditch.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless, in the narrative of the doings of this bloody\r\nnight, to make any attempt to vie with those paragraphs of lurid\r\ndescription which make Napier’s account of the storm of Badajoz perhaps\r\nthe most striking section of one of the most eloquent books in the\r\nEnglish language. All that will be here attempted is to give a clear\r\nand concise note of what happened between ten and one o’clock on the\r\nnight of April 6, 1812, so far as it is possible to secure a coherent\r\ntale from the diaries and memoirs of a number of eye-witnesses.\r\nBurgoyne and Jones of the Royal Engineers, Dickson the commander of the\r\nArtillery, Grattan and McCarthy from the 3rd Division, Leith Hay of\r\nthe 5th, and Kincaid, Simmons, and Harry Smith of the Light Division,\r\nalong with many more less well-known authorities, must serve as our\r\ninstructors, each for the part of the storm in which he was himself\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIt had been intended, as was said above, that all the columns should\r\nconverge simultaneously on their points of attack, and for that reason\r\nthe distances between the starting-point of each division and its\r\nobjective had been calculated with care. But, as a matter of fact, the\r\nhour of 10 p.m. was not quite accurately kept. On the right Picton’s\r\ndivision was descried by the French in the Castle as it was lining\r\nthe first parallel, and was heavily fired upon at 9.45, whereupon the\r\ngeneral, seeing that his men were discovered, ordered the advance to\r\nbegin at once--the 3rd Division was fording the Rivillas under a blaze\r\nof fire from the Castle and the San Pedro bastion before 10 struck\r\non the cathedral clock. On the other hand, at the western flank, the\r\nofficer in charge of the ladder and hay-bag party which was to lead the\r\n5th Division, lost his way along the bank of the Guadiana, while coming\r\nup from the Park to take his place at the head of Leith’s men. The\r\ncolumn had to wait for the ladders, and was more than an hour late in\r\nstarting. Only the central attack, on the three breaches, was delivered\r\nwith exact punctuality.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps best to deal with this unhappy assault first--it was a\r\nhorrible affair, and fully two-thirds of the losses that night were\r\nincurred in it. The two divisions, as ordered, came down the ravine\r\nto the left of the Pardaleras hill without being discovered: the line\r\nof vision from the town was in their favour till they were actually\r\non the glacis, and heavy firing against Picton’s column was heard as\r\nthey came forward. The 4th Division was turning to the right, the Light\r\nDivision to the left, just as they drew near the ditch, when suddenly\r\nthey were descried, and the French, who were well prepared and had long\r\nbeen waiting for the expected assault, opened on them with musketry\r\nfrom all the breaches, and with artillery from the unruined flanking\r\nbastions. The storm began as unhappily as it was to end. The advance\r\nof the 4th Division bearing to the right, came on a part of the ditch\r\ninto which the inundation had been admitted--not knowing its depth,\r\nnor that the French had made a six-foot cutting at the foot of the\r\ncounterscarp. Many men, not waiting for the ladders, sprang down into\r\nthe water, thinking it to be a mere puddle. The leading files nearly\r\nall perished--the regimental record of the Welsh Fusiliers shows\r\ntwenty men drowned--that of the Portuguese regiment which was behind\r\nthe Fusiliers as many as thirty. Finding the ditch impassable here,\r\nthe rest of the 4th Division storming-party swerved to the left, and,\r\ngetting beyond the inundation, planted their ladders there: some came\r\ndown in this way, more by simply taking a fourteen-foot leap on to the\r\nhay-bags, which they duly cast down. At the same moment the advance\r\nof the Light Division descended in a similar fashion into the ditch\r\nfarther to the left, towards Santa Maria. Many men were already at the\r\nbottom, the rest crowded on the edge, where the French engineers fired\r\nthe series of fougasses, mines, and powder-barrels which had been laid\r\nin the ditch. They worked perfectly, and the result was appalling--the\r\n500 volunteers who formed the advance of each division were almost all\r\nslain, scorched, or disabled. Every one of the engineer officers set\r\nto guide the column was killed or wounded, and the want of direction,\r\ncaused by the absence of any one who knew the topography of the\r\nbreaches, had the most serious effect during the rest of the storm. Of\r\nthe Light Division officers with the advance only two escaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nThere was a horrible check for a minute or two, and then the heads of\r\nthe main column of each division reached the edge of the ditch, and\r\nbegan to leap down, or to make use of those of the ladders which had\r\nnot been broken. The gulf below was all ablaze, for the explosions had\r\nset fire to the carts, boats, broken gabions, &c., which the French\r\nhad set in the ditch, and they were burning furiously--every man as\r\nhe descended was clearly visible to the enemy entrenched on the top\r\nof the breaches. The troops suffered severely as they dribbled over\r\nthe edge of the counterscarp, and began to accumulate in the ditch.\r\nFrom the first there was great confusion--the two divisions got mixed,\r\nbecause the 4th had been forced to swerve to its left to avoid the\r\ninundation, and so was on ground originally intended for the Light.\r\nMany men mistook an unfinished ravelin in the bottom of the ditch for\r\nthe foot of the central breach, and climbed it, only to find themselves\r\non a mass of earth divided by a wide sunken space from the point\r\nthey were aiming at. To get to the foot of the largest breach, that\r\nin the Trinidad bastion, it was necessary to push some way along the\r\nblazing bottom of the ditch, so as to turn and get round the end of the\r\ninundation. The main thrust of the attack, however, went this way, only\r\npart of the Light Division making for the Santa Maria breach, on which\r\nit had been intended that all should concentrate. As to the central\r\nbreach in the curtain, it seems that few or none made their way[269]\r\nthither: the disappointment on reaching the top of the ravelin in front\r\nof it, made all who got alive to that point turn right or left, instead\r\nof descending and pushing straight on. Jones records that next morning\r\nthere was hardly a single body of an English soldier on the central\r\nbreach, while the slopes and foot of each of the two flank breaches\r\nwere heaped with hundreds of corpses. This was a misfortune, as the\r\ncurtain breach was the easiest of the three, and having been made only\r\nthat afternoon was not retrenched like the others.\r\n\r\n  [269] This fact, much insisted on by Jones, is disputed by\r\n  certain Light Division witnesses, but does not seem to be\r\n  disproved by them.\r\n\r\nFrom ten to twelve the surviving men in the ditch, fed by the coming up\r\nof the rear battalions of each division, and finally by the reserve,\r\ndelivered a series of desperate but disorderly attacks on the Trinidad\r\nand Santa Maria breaches. It is said that on no occasion did more\r\nthan the equivalent of a company storm at once--each officer as he\r\nstruggled to the front with those of his men who stuck to him, tried\r\nthe breach opposite him, and was shot down nearer or farther from its\r\nfoot. Very few ever arrived at the top, with its _chevaux de frise_ of\r\nsword-blades. The footing among the beams and spikes was uncertain,\r\nand the French fire absolutely deadly--every man was armed with three\r\nmuskets. Next morning observers say that they noted only one corpse\r\nimpaled on the _chevaux de frise_ of the Trinidad breach, and a few\r\nmore under it, as if men had tried to crawl below, and had had their\r\nheads beaten in or blown to pieces. But the lower parts of the ascent\r\nwere absolutely carpeted with the dead, lying one on another.\r\n\r\nMore than two hours were spent in these desperate but vain attempts\r\nto carry the breaches: it is said that as many as forty separate\r\nassaults were made, but all to no effect--the fire concentrated on the\r\nattacked front was too heavy for any man to face. At last the assaults\r\nceased: the survivors stood--unable to get forward, unwilling to\r\nretreat--vainly answering the volleys of the French on the walls above\r\nthem by an ineffective fire of musketry. Just after twelve, Wellington,\r\nwho had been waiting on the hill above, receiving from time to time\r\nreports of the progress of the assault, sent down orders for the recall\r\nof the two divisions. They retired, most unwillingly, and formed up\r\nagain, in sadly diminished numbers, not far from the glacis. The only\r\nbenefit obtained from their dreadful exertions was that the attention\r\nof the French had been concentrated on the breaches for two hours--and\r\nmeanwhile (without their knowledge) the game had been settled elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe losses had been frightful--over one man in four of those engaged:\r\nthe Light Division had 68 officers and 861 men killed and wounded out\r\nof about 3,000 present: the 4th Division 84 officers and 841 men out of\r\n3,500. The Portuguese battalions which served with them had lost 400\r\nmen more--altogether 2,200 of the best troops in Wellington’s army had\r\nfallen--and all to no result.\r\n\r\nBut while the main stroke failed, each of the subsidiary attacks,\r\nunder Picton and Leith, had met with complete success, and despite\r\nof the disaster on the breaches, Badajoz was at Wellington’s mercy by\r\nmidnight. The success of either escalade by itself would have been\r\nenough to settle the game.\r\n\r\nPicton’s division, as already mentioned, had been detected by the\r\nFrench as it was filing into the parallel below the Castle: and since\r\na heavy fire was at once opened on it, there was no use in halting,\r\nand the general gave the order to advance without delay. The men\r\nwent forward on a narrow front, having to cross the Rivillas at the\r\nruined mill where alone it was fordable. This was done under fire, but\r\nwith no great loss. The palisade on the other bank of the stream was\r\nbroken down by a general rush, and the storming-party found itself\r\nat the foot of the lofty Castle hill. To get the ladders up it was a\r\nmost difficult business--the slope was very steep, almost precipitous\r\nin parts, and the ladders were thirty feet long and terribly heavy.\r\nThough no assault had been expected here, and the preparations were\r\nnot so elaborate as at the breaches, yet the besieged were not caught\r\nunprepared, and the column, as it climbed the hill, was torn by cannon\r\nshot and thinned by musketry. The French threw fire-balls over the\r\nwall, and other incandescent stuff (_carcasses_), so there was fair\r\nlight by which to see the stormers. Picton was hit in the groin down\r\nby the Rivillas, and the charge of the assault fell to his senior\r\nbrigadier, Kempt, and Major Burgoyne of the Engineers. The narrow space\r\nat the foot of the walls being reached, the ladders were reared, one\r\nafter the other, toward the south end of the Castle wall. Six being\r\nat last ready in spots close to each other, an attempt was made to\r\nmount, with an officer at the head of each. But the fire was so heavy,\r\nthat no man reached the last rungs alive, and the enemy overthrew\r\nall the ladders and broke several of them. One is said to have been\r\npulled up by main force into the Castle! Meanwhile the besieged cast\r\nheavy stones and broken beams into the mass of men clustering along\r\nthe foot of the wall, and slew many. But the 3rd Division was not\r\nspent--Kempt’s brigade had delivered the first rush--Champlemond’s\r\nPortuguese headed the second, when they had climbed the slope--but also\r\nto no effect. Lastly the rear brigade--Campbell’s--came up, and gave\r\na new impetus to the attack. There was now a very large force, 4,000\r\nmen, striving all along the base of the wall, on a front of some 200\r\nyards. Wherever footing could be found ladders were reared, now at\r\nconsiderable distances from each other. The garrison of the Castle was\r\nnot large--two Hessian and one French company and the gunners, under\r\n300 men, and when simultaneous attacks were delivered at many points,\r\nsome of them were scantily opposed. Hence it came that in more places\r\nthan one men at last scrambled to the crest of the wall. A private of\r\nthe 45th is said to have been the first man whose body fell inside,\r\nnot outside, the battlements--the second, we are told, was an ensign\r\n(McAlpin) of the 88th, who defended himself for a moment on the crest\r\nbefore he was shot. The third man to gain the summit was Colonel Ridge\r\nof the 5th Fusiliers, who found a point where an empty embrasure made\r\nthe wall a little lower, entered it with two or three of his men, and\r\nheld out long enough to allow more ladders to be planted behind him,\r\nand a nucleus to gather in his rear. He pushed on the moment that\r\nfifteen or twenty men had mounted, and the thin line of defenders being\r\nonce pierced the resistance suddenly broke down--all the remaining\r\nladders were planted, and the 3rd Division began to stream into the\r\nCastle. Picton was by this time again in command; he had recovered his\r\nstrength, and had hobbled up the slope, relieving Kempt, who was by now\r\nalso wounded. The time was about eleven o’clock, and the din at the\r\nbreaches down below showed that they were still being defended.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to dislodge the remainder of the garrison from the\r\nCastle precinct; many took refuge in the keep, and defended it from\r\nstair to stair, till they were exterminated. But by 12 midnight all\r\nwas over, and Picton would have debouched from the Castle, to sweep\r\nthe ramparts, but for the fact that all its gates, save one postern,\r\nwere found to have been bricked up--the French having intended to make\r\nit their last point of resistance if the town should fall. The one\r\nfree postern being at last found, the division was preparing to break\r\nout, when the head of its column was attacked by the French general\r\nreserve, a battalion of the 88th, which Phillipon had sent up from the\r\ncathedral square, when he heard that the Castle had been forced. There\r\nwas a sharp fight before the French were driven off, in which (most\r\nunhappily) Ridge, the hero of the escalade, was shot dead. By the time\r\nthat this was over, Badajoz had been entered at another point, and\r\nPicton’s success was only part of the decisive stroke. But as he had\r\ncaptured in the Castle all the French ammunition reserve, and nearly\r\nall their food, the town must anyhow have fallen, because of his daring\r\nexploit. The loss of the division was not excessive considering the\r\ndifficulties they had overcome, about 500 British and 200 Portuguese\r\nout of 4,000 men engaged.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the valley below the Castle, the guards of the trenches\r\nhad stormed the lunette of San Roque, and were hard at work cutting the\r\ndam, so that in an hour or two the inundation was beginning to drain\r\noff rapidly. This also would have been a decisive success, if nothing\r\nelse had been accomplished elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe blow, however, which actually finished the business, and caused the\r\nFrench to fail at the breaches, was delivered by quite another force.\r\nIt will be remembered that a brigade--Walker’s--of the 5th Division,\r\nhad been directed to escalade the remote river-bastion of San Vincente.\r\nIt was nearly an hour late, because of the tiresome mistake made by\r\nthe officer charged with the bringing up of the ladders from the Park.\r\nAnd only at a few minutes past eleven did Leith, heading the column,\r\narrive before the palisades of the covered way, near the Guadiana.\r\nWalker’s men were detected on the glacis, and a heavy artillery fire\r\nwas opened on them from San Vincente and San José, but they threw\r\ndown many of the palisades and began to descend into the ditch--a\r\ndrop of 12 feet. There was a cut in the bottom, to which water from\r\nthe Guadiana had been let in, and the wall in front was 30 feet high.\r\nHence the first attempts to plant the ladders were unavailing, and many\r\nmen fell. But coasting around the extreme north end of the bastion,\r\nclose to the river, some officers found that the flank sloped down\r\nto a height of only 20 feet, where the bastion joined the waterside\r\nwall. Three or four ladders were successfully planted here, while the\r\nmain attention of the garrison was distracted to the frontal attack,\r\nand a stream of men of the 4th, 30th, and 44th began to pour up them.\r\nThe French broke before the flank attack: they were not numerous, for\r\nseveral companies had been drawn off to help at the breaches, and the\r\nbastion was won. As soon as a few hundred men were formed, General\r\nWalker led them along the ramparts, and carried the second bastion,\r\nthat of San José. But the two French battalions holding the succeeding\r\nwestern bastions now massed together, and made a firm resistance in\r\nthat of Santiago. The stormers were stopped, and an unhappy incident\r\nbroke their impetus--some lighted port-fires thrown down by the French\r\nartillerymen were lying about--some one called out that they were the\r\nmatches of mines. Thereupon the advancing column instinctively fell\r\nback some paces--the French charged and drove them in, and the whole\r\nretired fighting confusedly as far as San Vincente. Here General Leith\r\nhad fortunately left a reserve battalion, the 2/38th, which, though\r\nonly 230 strong, stopped the panic and broke the French advance.\r\nWalker’s brigade rallied and advanced again--though its commander was\r\ndesperately wounded--and once more the enemy were swept all along the\r\nwestern bastions, which they lost one by one.\r\n\r\nSome of the 5th Division descended into the streets of the town, and\r\npushing for the rear of the great breaches, by a long détour through\r\nthe silent streets, at last came in upon them, and opened a lively fire\r\nupon the backs of the enemy who were manning the retrenchments. The\r\nmain body, however, driving before them the garrison of the southern\r\nbastions, hurtled in upon the flank of the Santa Maria. At this moment\r\nthe 4th and Light Divisions, by Wellington’s orders, advanced again\r\ntowards the ditch, where their dead or disabled comrades were lying so\r\nthick. They thought that they were going to certain death, not being\r\naware of what had happened inside the city. But as they descended\r\ninto the ditch only a few scattering shots greeted them. The French\r\nmain body--for 2,000 men had been driven in together behind the\r\nbreaches--had just thrown down their arms and surrendered to the 5th\r\nDivision. Even when there was no resistance, the breaches proved hard\r\nto mount, and the obstructions at the top were by no means easy to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nThe governor, Phillipon, had escaped into San Cristobal with a few\r\nhundred men, and surrendered there at dawn, having no food and little\r\nammunition. But he first sent out the few horsemen of the garrison to\r\nrun the gauntlet of the Portuguese pickets, and bear the evil news to\r\nSoult.\r\n\r\nThus fell Badajoz: the best summary of its fall is perhaps that\r\nof Leith Hay, who followed his relative, the commander of the 5th\r\nDivision, in the assault on San Vincente:--\r\n\r\n‘Had Lord Wellington relied on the storming of the breaches alone, the\r\ntown would not have been taken. Had General Leith received his ladders\r\npunctually and escaladed at 10, as intended, he would have been equally\r\nsuccessful, and the unfortunate divisions at the breaches would have\r\nbeen saved an hour of dreadful loss. If Leith had failed, Badajoz would\r\nstill have fallen, in consequence of the 3rd Division carrying the\r\nCastle--but not till the following morning; and the enemy might have\r\ngiven further trouble. Had Picton failed, still the success of the 5th\r\nDivision ensured the fall of the place.’ The moral would seem to be\r\nthat precautions cannot be too numerous--it was the afterthoughts in\r\nthis case, and not the main design, that were successful and saved the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nWellington himself, in a document--a letter to Lord Liverpool--that\r\nlong escaped notice, and did not get printed in its right place in\r\nthe ninth volume of his _Dispatches_[270], made a commentary on the\r\nperilous nature of the struggle and the greatness of the losses which\r\nmust not be suppressed. He ascribed them to deficiencies in the\r\nengineering department. ‘The capture of Badajoz affords as strong an\r\ninstance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed. But\r\nI greatly hope that I shall never again be the instrument of putting\r\nthem to such a test as they were put to last night. I assure your\r\nlordship that it is quite impossible to carry fortified places by _vive\r\nforce_ without incurring grave loss and being exposed to the chance of\r\nfailure, unless the army should be provided with a sufficient trained\r\ncorps of sappers and miners.... The consequences of being so unprovided\r\nwith the people necessary to approach a regularly fortified place are,\r\nfirst, that our engineers, though well-educated and brave, have never\r\nturned their minds to the mode of conducting a regular siege, as it\r\nis useless to think of that which, in our service, it is impossible\r\nto perform. They think that they have done their duty when they have\r\nconstructed a battery, with a secure communication to it, which can\r\nbreach the place. Secondly, these breaches have to be carried by _vive\r\nforce_ at an infinite sacrifice of officers and soldiers.... These\r\ngreat losses could be avoided, and, in my opinion, time gained in every\r\nsiege, if we had properly trained people to carry it on. I declare that\r\nI have never seen breaches more practicable in themselves than the\r\nthree in the walls of Badajoz, and the fortress must have surrendered\r\nwith these breaches open, if I had been able to “approach” the place.\r\nBut when I had made the third breach, on the evening of the 6th, I\r\ncould do no more. I was then obliged either to storm or to give the\r\nbusiness up; and when I ordered the assault I was certain that I should\r\nlose our best officers and men. It is a cruel situation for any person\r\nto be placed in, and I earnestly request your lordship to have a corps\r\nof sappers and miners formed without loss of time.’\r\n\r\n  [270] My attention was called to this letter, found among Lord\r\n  Liverpool’s papers in 1869, by Mr. F. Turner, of Frome.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary fact that no trained corps of sappers and miners\r\nexisted at this time was the fault neither of Wellington nor of the\r\nLiverpool ministry, but of the professional advisers of the cabinets\r\nthat had borne office ever since the great French War broke out. The\r\nneed had been as obvious during the sieges of 1793-4 in Flanders as in\r\n1812. That the Liverpool ministry could see the point, and wished to\r\ndo their duty, was shown by the fact that they at once proceeded to\r\nturn six companies of the existing corps of ‘Royal Military Artificers’\r\ninto sappers. On April 23, less than three weeks after Badajoz fell,\r\na warrant was issued for instructing the whole corps in military\r\nfield-works. On August 4 their name was changed from ‘Royal Military\r\nArtificers’ to ‘Royal Sappers and Miners.’ The transformation was\r\nmuch too late for the siege of Burgos, but by 1813 the companies were\r\nbeginning to join the Peninsular Army, and at San Sebastian they were\r\nwell to the front. An end was at last made to the system hitherto\r\nprevailing, by which the troops which should have formed the rank and\r\nfile of the Royal Engineers were treated as skilled mechanics, mainly\r\nvaluable for building and carpentering work at home stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BADAJOZ]\r\n\r\nOne more section, a most shameful one, must be added to the narrative\r\nof the fall of Badajoz. We have already had to tell of the grave\r\ndisorders which two months before had followed the storm of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. These were but trifling and venial compared with the\r\noffences which were committed by the men who had just gone through the\r\nterrible experiences of the night of April 6th. At Rodrigo there was\r\nmuch drunkenness, a good deal of plunder, and some wanton fire-raising:\r\nmany houses had been sacked, a few inhabitants were maltreated, but\r\nnone, it is believed, were mortally hurt. At Badajoz the outrages of\r\nall kinds passed belief; the looting was general and systematic, and\r\nrape and bloodshed were deplorably common. Explanatory excuses have\r\nbeen made, to the effect that the army had an old grudge against the\r\ninhabitants of the city, dating back to the time when several divisions\r\nwere quartered in and about it, after Talavera. It was also said that\r\nall the patriotic inhabitants had fled long ago, and that those who had\r\nremained behind were mainly _Afrancesados_, traitors to the general\r\ncause. There was some measure of truth in both allegations: it was no\r\ndoubt true that there had been quarrels in 1809, and that many loyalist\r\nfamilies had evacuated the city after the French occupation, and had\r\ntransferred themselves to other parts of Estremadura. The population\r\nat the time of the British storm was not two-thirds of the normal\r\nfigure. But these excuses will not serve. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe outrages were in no sense reasoned acts of retribution, but were a\r\nsimple outburst of ruffianism.\r\n\r\nOld military tradition in all the armies of Europe held that a\r\ngarrison which refused to surrender when the breaches had become\r\npracticable was at the mercy of the conqueror for life and limb,\r\nand that a town resisting to extremity was the natural booty of the\r\nstormers. In the eighteenth century there were countless instances of\r\na fortress, defended with courage up to the moment when an assault\r\nwas possible, surrendering on the express plea that the lives of the\r\ngarrison were forfeit if it held out, when resistance could no longer\r\nbe successful. The attacking party held that all the lives which it\r\nlost after the place had become untenable were lost unnecessarily,\r\nbecause of the unreasonable obstinacy of the besieged: the latter\r\ntherefore could expect no quarter. This was not an unnatural view when\r\nthe circumstances are considered. The defender of a wall or a breach\r\nhas an immense advantage over the stormer, till the moment when the\r\nlatter has succeeded in closing, and in bringing his superior numbers\r\nto bear. In a curious hortatory address which Phillipon published\r\nto his garrison[271], the passage occurs, ‘realize thoroughly that\r\na man mounting up a ladder cannot use his weapon unless he is left\r\nunmolested: the head comes up above the parapet unprotected, and a\r\nwary soldier can destroy in succession as many enemies as appear at\r\nthe ladder-top.’ This is perfectly true: but Phillipon naturally\r\navoided stating the logical conclusion, viz. that when the stormers\r\nfinally succeed in crowning the ramparts, they will be particularly\r\nill-disposed towards the garrison who have, till the last moment, been\r\nbraining their comrades or shooting them through the head at small\r\nrisk to themselves. When the assailant, after seeing several of his\r\npredecessors on the ladder deliberately butchered by a man under cover,\r\ngets by some special piece of luck on a level with his adversary, it\r\nwill be useless for the latter to demand quarter. If it is a question\r\nof showing mercy, why did not the other side begin? _Que messieurs\r\nles assassins commencent_, as the French humorist remarked to the\r\nhumanitarian, who protested against capital punishment for murderers.\r\nThere is a grim story of a party of Tuscan soldiers of the 113th Line,\r\nwho were pinned into a ravelin on the flank of the lesser breach at\r\nRodrigo, and after firing to the last minute upon the flank of the\r\nLight Division, threw down their arms, when they saw themselves cut\r\noff, calling out that they were ‘_poveros Italianos_’--’So you’re not\r\nFrench but _Italians_ are you--then here’s a shot for you,’ was the\r\nnatural answer[272]:--reflections as to the absence of any national\r\nenmity towards the victors should have occurred to the vanquished\r\nbefore, and not after, the breach was carried. The same thing happened\r\nat the Castle of Badajoz to the companies, mainly Hessians, who so long\r\nheld down the stormers of the 3rd Division. If the defenders of the\r\nbreaches escaped summary massacre, it was because the breaches were not\r\ncarried by force, and the main body of the French surrendered some time\r\nafter the assault had ceased, and to troops of the 5th Division, who\r\nhad not been personally engaged with them.\r\n\r\n  [271] Printed in Belmas, iv, Appendix, p. 369, and dated March 26.\r\n\r\n  [272] The story may be found in Kincaid, p. 114, and in several\r\n  other sources.\r\n\r\nIt was universally held in all armies during the wars of the early\r\nnineteenth century that the garrison which resisted to the last moment,\r\nafter success had become impossible, had no rights. Ney wrote to the\r\ngovernor of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1810, ‘further resistance will force\r\nthe Prince of Essling to treat you with all the rigour of the laws\r\nof war. You have to choose between honourable capitulation and the\r\nterrible vengeance of a victorious army[273].’ Suchet, in more brutal\r\nwords, told the governor of Tortosa that he should put to the sword a\r\ngarrison which resisted instead of capitulating ‘when the laws of war\r\nmake it his duty to do so, large breaches being opened and the walls\r\nruined[274].’ A very clear statement of this sanguinary theory is\r\nfound in a passage in the Memoirs of Contreras, the unlucky governor\r\nof Tarragona in 1811[275]. ‘The day after the storm General Suchet had\r\nme brought before him on a stretcher [he was severely wounded] and in\r\npresence of his chief officers and of my own, told me in a loud voice\r\nthat I was the cause of all the horrors which his troops had committed\r\nin Tarragona, because I had held out beyond the limit prescribed in\r\nthe laws of war, and that those laws directed him to have me executed,\r\nfor not capitulating when the breach was opened; that having taken the\r\nplace by assault he had the right to slay and burn _ad infinitum_.’\r\nI replied that ‘if it is true that the laws of war state that, if\r\nthe besieger gets in, he may deliver to the sword and the flames\r\ntown and garrison, and if they therefore suggest as a proper moment\r\nfor capitulation that when an assault has become practicable, it is\r\nnevertheless true that they do not prohibit the besieged from resisting\r\nthe assault, if he considers that he can beat it off: I had sufficient\r\nforces to hold my own, and should have done so if my orders had been\r\nproperly carried out. Therefore I should have been called a coward if\r\nI had not tried to resist, and no law prohibited me from repulsing an\r\nassault if I could.’\r\n\r\n  [273] Document in Belmas, iii. p. 287.\r\n\r\n  [274] Ibid., p. 442.\r\n\r\n  [275] Published in the collection of _Mémoires sur la guerre\r\n  d’Espagne_ in 1821.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been pointed out recently[276], Wellington himself may be\r\nquoted in favour of this theory. In a letter written to Canning in\r\n1820 concerning quite another matter, he remarked, ‘I believe that it\r\nhas always been understood that the defenders of a fortress stormed\r\nhave no claim to quarter, and the practice which prevailed during the\r\nlast century of surrendering fortresses when a breach was opened,\r\nand the counterscarp blown in, was founded on this understanding. Of\r\nlate years the French availed themselves of the humanity of modern\r\nwarfare, and made a new regulation that a breach should stand one\r\nassault at least. The consequence of this regulation of Bonaparte’s\r\nwas the loss to me of the flower of my army, in the assaults on Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and Badajoz. I should have thought myself justified in putting\r\nboth garrisons to the sword, and if I had done so at the first, it is\r\nprobable that I should have saved 5,000 men at the second. I mention\r\nthis to show you that the practice which refuses quarter to a garrison\r\nthat stands an assault is not a _useless_ effusion of blood.’\r\n\r\n  [276] By Colonel Callwell, in an article in _Blackwood’s\r\n  Magazine_ for September 1913.\r\n\r\nComparatively few of the garrisons of Rodrigo and Badajoz were shot\r\ndown, and those all in hot blood in the moment after the walls were\r\ncarried. Suchet’s army was much more pitiless at Tarragona, where a\r\ngreat part of the Spanish garrison was deliberately hunted down and\r\nslaughtered. But there was, of course, a much more bitter feeling\r\nbetween French and Spaniards than between English and French.\r\n\r\nThe only reason for enlarging on this deplorable theme is that there\r\nwas a close connexion in the minds of all soldiers of the early\r\nnineteenth century, from the highest to the lowest ranks, between the\r\nidea that an over-obstinate garrison had forfeited quarter, and the\r\nidea that the town they had defended was liable to sack. This may be\r\nfound plainly stated in Lannes’s summons to Palafox at Saragossa in\r\nJanuary 1809[277], in the capitulation-debate before the surrender\r\nof Badajoz in 1811, in Augereau’s address to the inhabitants of\r\nGerona[278], in Leval’s summons to the governor of Tarifa[279], and\r\nwith special emphasis in Suchet’s threatening epistle to Blake on the\r\nday before the fall of Valencia: ‘in a few hours a general assault\r\nwill precipitate into your city the French columns: if you delay till\r\nthis terrible moment, it will not be in my power to restrain the fury\r\nof the soldiery, and you alone will be responsible before God and man\r\nfor the evils which will overwhelm Valencia. It is the desire to avert\r\nthe complete destruction of a great town that determines me to offer\r\nyou honourable terms of capitulation[280].’ It was hardly necessary\r\nin the Napoleonic era to enlarge on the connexion between storm and\r\nsack--it was presupposed. Every governor who capitulated used to put in\r\nhis report to his own government a mention of his ‘desire to spare the\r\nunfortunate inhabitants the horrors of a storm.’\r\n\r\n  [277] See Belmas, ii. p. 381.\r\n\r\n  [278] Ibid., ii. pp. 844-5.\r\n\r\n  [279] Text in the _Defence of Tarifa_, p. 64, and in Arteche.\r\n\r\n  [280] Belmas, iv. p. 202.\r\n\r\nThis idea, sad to say, was as deeply rooted in the minds of British as\r\nof French soldiers. It is frankly confessed in many a Peninsular diary.\r\n‘The men were permitted to enjoy themselves (!) for the remainder of\r\nthe day,’ says Kincaid in his narrative of the fall of Badajoz, ‘and\r\nthe usual frightful scene of plunder commenced, which officers thought\r\nit prudent to avoid for the moment by retiring to the camp[281].’ ‘The\r\ntroops were, of course, admitted to the immemorial privilege of tearing\r\nthe town to pieces,’ says another writer on another occasion[282]. The\r\nman in the ranks regarded the connexion of storm and sack as so close\r\nthat he could write, ‘the prisoners being secured and the gates opened,\r\nwe were allowed to enter the town _for the purpose of plundering\r\nit_[283].’ But perhaps the most eye-opening sentence on the subject is\r\nWellington’s official order of April 7, 1812, issued late in the day,\r\nand when the sack had already been going on for fifteen or eighteen\r\nhours, ‘It is now full time that the plunder of Badajoz should cease;\r\nan officer and six steady non-commissioned officers will be sent from\r\neach regiment, British and Portuguese, of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and Light\r\nDivisions into the town, at 5 a.m. to-morrow morning, to bring away any\r\nmen still straggling there[284].’\r\n\r\n  [281] Kincaid, p. 39.\r\n\r\n  [282] Leith Hay, ii. pp. 256-7.\r\n\r\n  [283] Memoirs of Donaldson of the 94th, p. 158.\r\n\r\n  [284] Wellington, _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. p. 311.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunately the fact that Badajoz was a Spanish and not a\r\nFrench town, and this adds a special shame to the lamentable outrages\r\nwhich were perpetrated in its streets for many hours after the storm.\r\nIt is comparatively seldom in war that an army takes by assault a town\r\nwhich does not belong to the hostile power. The only parallel of recent\r\nyears to the sack of Badajoz had been that of Lübeck in November\r\n1806. Blücher’s Prussian corps, retiring before the pursuing French,\r\ntrespassed on neutral territory by seizing on the old Hanseatic city,\r\nwhich lay in its way, and endeavouring to defend it. The magistrates\r\nprotested, but were powerless, as they had no armed force at their\r\ndisposition. Then the French came upon the scene, and, after a fierce\r\nfight, won their way over wall and ditch and took the place. They\r\nsacked it from end to end with every circumstance of atrocity[285]:\r\nMarshal Bernadotte, when importuned by the Burgomaster to stay the\r\nhorrors, said that he was sorry, but that his troops only recognized\r\nthe fact that they were in a stormed town--he and his officers\r\ncould only succeed in calling them off after the city had been half\r\ndestroyed. This was sufficiently horrible; but to sack a town belonging\r\nto a friendly nation is a shade worse than to sack a neutral place--and\r\nthis the British troops did.\r\n\r\n  [285] It is said on good first-hand authority that all the\r\n  inmates of an asylum for female lunatics were raped. See\r\n  Lettow-Vorbeck, _Geschichte des Krieges von 1806-7_, ii. p. 384.\r\n\r\nTwo short quotations from eye-witnesses may serve to show the kind of\r\nscenes that prevailed in Badajoz from the early hours of the morning on\r\nApril 7th down to the following night.\r\n\r\n‘Unfortunate Badajoz,’ writes one narrator[286], ‘met with the usual\r\nfate of places taken at the point of the bayonet. In less than an\r\nhour after it fell into our possession it looked as if centuries had\r\ngradually completed its destruction. The surviving soldier, after\r\nstorming a town, considers it as his indisputable property, and thinks\r\nhimself at liberty to commit any enormity by way of indemnifying\r\nhimself for the risking of his life. The bloody strife has made him\r\ninsensible to every better feeling: his lips are parched by the\r\nextraordinary exertions that he has made, and from necessity, as well\r\nas inclination, his first search is for liquor. This once obtained,\r\nevery trace of human nature vanishes, and no brutal outrage can be\r\nnamed which he does not commit. The town was not only plundered of\r\nevery article that could be carried off, but whatever was useless or\r\ntoo heavy to move was wantonly destroyed. Whenever an officer appeared\r\nin the streets the wretched inhabitants flocked round him with terror\r\nand despair, embraced his knees and supplicated his protection. But it\r\nwas vain to oppose the soldiers: there were 10,000 of them crowding\r\nthe streets, the greater part drunk and discharging their pieces in\r\nall directions--it was difficult to escape them unhurt. A couple of\r\nhundred of their women from the camp poured also into the place, when\r\nit was barely taken, to have their share of the plunder. They were,\r\nif possible, worse than the men. Gracious God! such tigresses in the\r\nshape of women! I sickened when I saw them coolly step over the dying,\r\nindifferent to their cries for a drop of water, and deliberately search\r\nthe pockets of the dead for money, or even divest them of their bloody\r\ncoats. But no more of these scenes of horror. I went deliberately into\r\nthe town to harden myself to the sight of human misery--and I have had\r\nenough of it: my blood has been frozen with the outrages I witnessed.’\r\n\r\n  [286] Hodenberg of the K.G.L. See his letters published in\r\n  _Blackwood’s Magazine_ for March 1913, by myself.\r\n\r\nAnother eye-witness gives a passing glimpse of horrors. ‘Duty being\r\nover, I chanced to meet my servant, who seemed to have his haversack\r\nalready well filled with plunder. I asked him where the regiment was:\r\nhe answered that he did not know, but that he had better conduct me to\r\nthe camp, as I appeared to be wounded. I certainly was hit in the head,\r\nbut in the excitement of the escalade had not minded it, nor had I felt\r\na slight wound in my leg: but, as I began to be rather weak, I took\r\nhis advice, and he assisted me on. In passing what appeared to be a\r\nreligious house I saw two soldiers dragging out an unfortunate nun, her\r\nclothes all torn: in her agony she knelt and held up a cross. Remorse\r\nseized one of the men, who appeared more sober than the other, and he\r\nswore she should not be outraged. The other soldier drew back a step\r\nand shot his comrade dead. At this moment we found ourselves surrounded\r\nby several Portuguese: they ordered us to halt, and presented their\r\nmuskets at us. I said to my servant, “throw them some of your plunder:”\r\nhe instantly took off his haversack and threw it among them: some\r\ndollars and other silver coin rolled out. They then let us pass--had\r\nhe not done so they would have shot us--as they did several others. We\r\ngot safe to the bastion, and my servant carried me on his back to the\r\ncamp, where I got a draught of water, fell asleep instantly, and did\r\nnot waken till after midday[287].’\r\n\r\n  [287] _Recollections of Col. P. P. Nevill, late Major 63rd_ [but\r\n  with the 30th at Badajoz], pp. 15-16.\r\n\r\n‘In justice to the army’--we quote from another authority[288]--’I\r\nmust say that the outrages were not general: in many cases they were\r\nperpetrated by cold-blooded villains who had been backward enough in\r\nthe attack. Many risked their lives in defending helpless women, and,\r\nthough it was rather a dangerous moment for an officer to interfere,\r\nI saw many of them running as much risk to prevent inhumanity as they\r\ndid in the preceding night while storming the town.’ The best-known\r\nincident of the kind is the story of Harry Smith of the 95th, who saved\r\na young Spanish lady in the tumult, and married her two days later,\r\nin the presence of the Commander-in-Chief himself, who gave away the\r\nbride. This hastily-wedded spouse, Juana de Leon, was the Lady Smith\r\nwho was the faithful companion of her husband through so many campaigns\r\nin Spain, Belgium, and South Africa, and gave her name to the town in\r\nNatal which, nearly ninety years after the siege of Badajoz, was to be\r\nthe scene of the sternest leaguer that British troops have endured in\r\nour own generation. Harry Smith’s narrative of the Odyssey of himself\r\nand his young wife in 1812-14, as told in his autobiography, is one of\r\nthe most romantic tales of love and war that have ever been set down on\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n  [288] Donaldson of the 94th, p. 159.\r\n\r\nIt was not till late in the afternoon of the 7th that Wellington, as\r\nhas been already mentioned, came to the rather tardy conclusion that\r\n‘it was now full time that the plunder of Badajoz should cease.’ He\r\nsent in Power’s Portuguese brigade to clear out those of the plunderers\r\nwho had not already gone back exhausted to their camps, and erected\r\na gallows in the cathedral square, for the hanging of any criminals\r\nwho might be detected lingering on for further outrages. Authorities\r\ndiffer as to whether the Provost Marshal did, or did not, put his\r\npower in action: the balance of evidence seems to show that the mere\r\nthreat sufficed to bring the sack to an end. The men were completely\r\nexhausted: Napier remarks that ‘the tumult rather subsided than was\r\nquelled.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS OF THE FRENCH DURING THE SIEGE OF BADAJOZ\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to demonstrate the wide-spreading results of the\r\nfall of the great Estremaduran fortress, it is necessary to follow\r\nthe movements of the French armies which had been responsible for its\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nSoult had been before Cadiz when, on March 11, he received news from\r\nDrouet that troops were arriving at Elvas from the North, and on March\r\n20 the more definite information that Wellington had moved out in\r\nforce on the 14th, and invested Badajoz on the 16th. The Marshal’s\r\nlong absence from his head-quarters at Seville at this moment, when\r\nhe had every reason to suspect that the enemy’s next stroke would be\r\nin his own direction, is curious. Apparently his comparative freedom\r\nfrom anxiety had two causes. The first was his confidence that Badajoz,\r\nwith its excellent governor and its picked garrison, could be relied\r\nupon to make a very long defence. The second was that he was fully\r\npersuaded that when the time of danger arrived he could count on\r\nMarmont’s help--as he had in June 1811. On February 7 he wrote to his\r\ncolleague[289] that he had just heard of the fall of Rodrigo, that\r\nWellington’s next movement would naturally be against Badajoz, and that\r\nhe was glad to learn that Montbrun’s divisions, on their return from\r\nAlicante, were being placed in the valley of the Tagus. ‘I see with\r\npleasure that your excellency has given him orders to get in touch\r\nwith the Army of the South. As long as this communication shall exist,\r\nthe enemy will not dare to make a push against Badajoz, because at\r\nhis first movement we can join our forces and march against him for\r\na battle. I hope that it may enter into your plans to leave a corps\r\nbetween the Tagus and the Guadiana, the Truxillo road, and the Sierra\r\nde Guadalupe, where it can feed, and keep in touch with the troops\r\nwhich I keep in the Serena [the district about Medellin, Don Benito,\r\nand Zalamea, where Daricau was cantoned]. I am persuaded that, when\r\nthe campaigning season begins, the enemy will do all he can to seize\r\nBadajoz, because he dare attempt nothing in Castille so long as that\r\nplace offers us a base from which to invade Portugal and fall upon his\r\nline of communications.... I am bound, therefore, to make a pressing\r\ndemand that your left wing may be kept in a position which makes the\r\ncommunication between our armies sure, so that we may be able, by\r\nuniting our disposable forces, to go out against the enemy with the\r\nassurance of success.’\r\n\r\n  [289] The letter is printed in Marmont’s _Correspondance_, iv.\r\n  pp. 304-5.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what Marmont had intended to do. He was convinced,\r\nlike Soult, that Wellington’s next move would be against Badajoz, and\r\nhe placed Montbrun and the divisions of Foy, Brennier, and Sarrut about\r\nTalavera, Monbeltran, and Almaraz, precisely in order that they might\r\nbe in easy touch with Drouet. On February 22 he wrote to his colleague\r\nexplaining his purpose in so doing, and his complete acquiescence in\r\nthe plan for a joint movement against Wellington, whenever the latter\r\nshould appear on the Guadiana[290]. His pledge was quite honest and\r\ngenuine, and in reliance on it Soult made all his arrangements. These,\r\nhowever, appear to have been rather loose and careless: the Marshal\r\nseems to have felt such complete confidence in the combination that he\r\nmade insufficient preparations on his own side. No reinforcements were\r\nsent either to Badajoz or to Drouet, whose 12,000 men were dispersed\r\nin a very long front in Estremadura, reaching from Medellin and Don\r\nBenito on the right to Fregenal on the left. This is why Graham, when\r\nhe moved forward briskly on March 17th, found no solid body of the\r\nenemy in front of him, but only scattered brigades and regiments, which\r\nmade off in haste, and which only succeeded at last in concentrating\r\nso far to the rear as Fuente Ovejuna, which is actually in Andalusia,\r\nand behind the crest of the Sierra Morena. We may add that having been\r\nadvised by Drouet as early as March 11th[291] that British troops were\r\naccumulating behind Elvas, Soult ought to have taken the alarm at once,\r\nto have moved back to Seville from Santa Maria by Cadiz, where he lay\r\non that date, and to have issued orders for the concentration of his\r\nreserves. He did none of these things, was still in front of Cadiz on\r\nMarch 20[292], and did not prescribe any movement of troops till, on\r\nthat day, he received Drouet’s more definite and alarming news that\r\nWellington was in person at Elvas, and had moved out toward Badajoz on\r\nthe 16th. Clearly he lost nine days by want of sufficient promptness,\r\nand had but himself to blame if he could only start from Seville\r\nwith a considerable field-force on March 30. All that he appears to\r\nhave done on March 11 was to write to Marmont that the long-foreseen\r\nhypothesis of a move of Wellington on Badajoz was being verified, and\r\nthat they must prepare to unite their forces. Jourdan has, therefore,\r\nsome justification for his remark that he does not see why Soult should\r\nhave been before Cadiz, amusing himself by throwing shells into that\r\nplace[293] as late as March 20th.\r\n\r\n  [290] This Soult quotes in his recriminatory letter to Marmont of\r\n  April 8, and in his angry dispatch to Berthier of the same date\r\n  (printed in King Joseph’s _Correspondance_, viii. p. 355).\r\n\r\n  [291] The date is proved by the letter from Soult to Marmont of\r\n  March 11, printed in Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. p. 359.\r\n\r\n  [292] The date is proved by Soult’s letter to the Emperor of\r\n  that date from Santa Maria, in which he announces his intention\r\n  to start, and says that he is writing to Marmont, to get him to\r\n  unite the armies as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  [293] See his _Mémoires_, p. 377.\r\n\r\nFrom the 20th to the 30th of that month Soult was busily engaged in\r\norganizing the relief-column which, after picking up Drouet on the\r\nway, was to march to the succour of Badajoz. He could not venture\r\nto touch the divisions of Conroux and Cassagne, which together were\r\nnone too strong to provide for the manning of the Cadiz Lines and the\r\nfending off of Ballasteros from their rear. But he called off the\r\nwhole division of Barrois, nearly 8,000 strong[294], Vichery’s brigade\r\nof infantry from Leval’s division in the province of Granada[295],\r\nand six regiments of Digeon’s and Pierre Soult’s dragoons. This, with\r\nthe corresponding artillery, made a column of some 13,000 men, with\r\nwhich the Marshal started from Seville on the 30th March, crossed\r\nthe Guadalquivir at Lora del Rio next day, and moved on Constantina\r\nand Guadalcanal. An interesting complication would have been caused\r\nif Graham had been allowed to stop with his 19,000 men at Azuaga and\r\nLlerena, where he was directly between Soult and Drouet’s position at\r\nFuente Ovejuna, and if Hill from Merida had moved against Drouet’s\r\ncorps. But as Wellington had withdrawn Graham’s column to Villafranca\r\non March 31, there was nothing left to prevent Drouet from coming in\r\nfrom his excentric position, and joining his chief at Llerena on April\r\n4th, with the 12,000 men of his own and Daricau’s divisions. This\r\ngave the Marshal some 25,000 men[296] in hand, a force which would be\r\nmanifestly incapable of raising the siege of Badajoz, for he knew that\r\nWellington had at least 45,000 men in hand, and, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe arrival of the 5th Division and other late detachments had raised\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese army to something more like 55,000 sabres and\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n  [294] To be exact, 7,776 officers and men on March 1. He also\r\n  brought with him some ‘bataillons d’élite’ of grenadier companies\r\n  from Villatte’s division.\r\n\r\n  [295] The 55th, three battalions about 1,500 strong, the fourth\r\n  being left at Jaen. Soult says in his dispatch of April 8 that\r\n  he took a whole _brigade_ from Leval, but the states of April 14\r\n  show the 32nd and 58th regiments of Leval’s division, and three\r\n  of the four battalions of the 43rd, all left in the kingdom of\r\n  Granada. Apparently three battalions of the 55th and one of the\r\n  43rd marched, about 2,200 strong.\r\n\r\n  [296] Though he calls them only 21,000 in his dispatches. But the\r\n  figures [see Appendix no. VIII] show 23,500. The total in the\r\n  monthly reports indicate 25,000 as more likely.\r\n\r\nWellington’s orders, when he heard that Soult was in the passes, and\r\nthat Drouet was moving to join him, directed Graham to fall back on the\r\nAlbuera position, and Hill to join him there by the route of Lobon and\r\nTalavera Real, if it should appear that all the French columns were\r\nmoving directly to the relief of Badajoz, and none of them spreading\r\nout eastward towards the Upper Guadiana[297]. These conditions were\r\nrealized, as Soult moved in one solid body towards Villafranca and\r\nFuente del Maestre: so Hill evacuated Merida, after destroying its\r\nbridge, and joined Graham on the old Albuera ground on April 6th. They\r\nhad 31,000 men, including four British divisions and four British\r\ncavalry brigades, and Wellington could have reinforced them from the\r\nlines before Badajoz with two divisions more, if it had been necessary,\r\nwhile still leaving the fortress adequately blockaded by 10,000 or\r\n12,000 men. But as Soult did not appear at Fuente del Maestre and\r\nVillafranca till the afternoon of April 7th, a day after Badajoz had\r\nfallen, this need did not arise. The Marshal, learning of the disaster,\r\nhastily turned back and retired towards Andalusia, wisely observing\r\nthat he ‘could not fight the whole English army.’ It is interesting to\r\nspeculate what would have happened if he had lingered five days less\r\nbefore Cadiz, had issued his concentration orders on the 14th or 15th\r\ninstead of the 20th March, and had appeared at Villafranca on the 2nd\r\ninstead of the 7th of the next month. His dispatch of April 17 states\r\nthat he had intended to fight, despite of odds, to save Badajoz: if he\r\nhad done so, and had attacked 40,000 Anglo-Portuguese with his 25,000\r\nmen, he must inevitably have suffered a dreadful disaster. He must\r\nhave fought a second battle of Albuera with much the same strength\r\nthat he had at the first, while his enemy would have had six British\r\ndivisions instead of two, and an equal instead of a wholly inferior\r\ncavalry. The result of such a battle could hardly have failed to be\r\nnot only a crushing defeat for the French, but the prompt loss of all\r\nAndalusia; for thrown back on that kingdom with a routed army, and\r\nunable to gather in promptly reserves scattered over the whole land,\r\nfrom the Cadiz Lines to Granada and Malaga, he must have evacuated his\r\nviceroyalty, and have retreated in haste either on La Mancha or on\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\n  [297] The orders to Hill issued by Wellington on April 4 and 5\r\n  (_Dispatches_, ix. p. 30) contemplate two possibilities: (1)\r\n  Soult is marching with his whole force on Villafranca, and Foy is\r\n  remaining far away: in this case Hill is to move _en masse_ on\r\n  Albuera. This is the case that actually occurred; (2) if Foy is\r\n  moving toward the Upper Guadiana, and Soult is showing signs of\r\n  extending to join him, Howard’s British and Ashworth’s Portuguese\r\n  brigades and Campbell’s Portuguese horse will stay at Merida as\r\n  long as is prudent, in order to prevent the junction, and will\r\n  break the bridge at the last moment and then follow Hill.\r\n\r\n  Wellington, when he wrote his first orders of the 4th to\r\n  Hill, was intending to storm Badajoz on the 5th, and knew, by\r\n  calculating distances, that Soult could not be in front of\r\n  Albuera till the 7th. He ultimately chanced another day of\r\n  bombardment, running the time limit rather fine. But there was no\r\n  real risk with Graham and Hill at Albuera: Soult could not have\r\n  forced them.\r\n\r\nIt is most improbable, however, that Soult would really have ventured\r\nto attack the Albuera position[298], in spite of the confident\r\nlanguage of his ex-post-facto dispatches. His whole plan of operations\r\ndepended on his being joined by the Army of Portugal, in accordance\r\nwith Marmont’s promise of February 22nd. And he was well aware, by a\r\nletter sent by Foy to Drouet on March 31st, and received on April 6th,\r\nthat he could expect no help from the North for many weeks, if any\r\ncame at all. That Badajoz was never relieved was due, not to Soult’s\r\ndelay in concentrating (though this was no doubt unwise), nor to his\r\nover-confidence in Phillipon’s power of resistance, which was (as it\r\nturned out) misplaced. He wrote to Berthier that ‘the garrison wanted\r\nfor nothing--it had still food for two months, and was abundantly\r\nprovided with munitions: its total strength was 5,000 men: it had\r\nvictoriously repulsed three assaults: the men were convinced that,\r\nhowever great a hostile force presented itself before the breaches,\r\nit would never carry them: Phillipon had been informed on March 28th\r\nthat I was marching to his help: the troops were in enthusiastic\r\nspirits, though they had already lost 500 men in successful sorties: my\r\nadvanced guard was at only one long day’s march from the place, when it\r\nsuccumbs!’ It was indeed an _évènement funeste_!\r\n\r\n  [298] He says in his letter to Berthier of April 8 that he had\r\n  intended (but for the fall of Badajoz) to move by his right that\r\n  morning, to the lower course of the Guadajira river--which would\r\n  have brought on an action near Talavera Real, lower down the\r\n  stream of the Albuera than the battle-spot of May 1811.\r\n\r\nBut Soult’s late arrival and miscalculation of the time that the\r\nsiege would take, were neither of them the causes of the fall of\r\nBadajoz. It would have fallen none the less if he had arrived on the\r\nAlbuera upon April 2nd. The fate of the place was really settled\r\nby Napoleon’s dispatches to Marmont, with which we dealt at great\r\nlength in an earlier chapter[299]. The orders of February 11 and\r\nFebruary 21 (received by the Duke of Ragusa on February 26 and March\r\n2 respectively) forbade him to worry about Badajoz, ‘a very strong\r\nfortress supported by an army of 80,000 men,’ and told him to withdraw\r\nto Salamanca two of the three divisions which he was keeping in the\r\nvalley of the Tagus, and to reply to any movement of Wellington into\r\nEstremadura by invading Northern Portugal. The plan which Soult and\r\nMarmont had concerted for a joint relief of Badajoz was expressly\r\nforbidden by their master, on his erroneous hypothesis that a thrust at\r\nCiudad Rodrigo and Almeida must bring Wellington home again. Marmont’s\r\npromise of co-operation, sent off on February 22nd to Seville, was\r\nrendered impossible--through no fault of his--by the imperial dispatch\r\nreceived four days later, which expressly forbade him to stand by it.\r\n‘The English will only go southward if you, by your ill-devised scheme,\r\nkeep two or three divisions detached on the Tagus: that reassures them,\r\nand tells them that you have no offensive projects against them.’ So\r\nMarmont, protesting and prophesying future disaster, was compelled to\r\nwithdraw two divisions from the central position on the Tagus, and to\r\nleave there only Foy’s 5,000 men--a negligible quantity in the problem.\r\nNor was this all--he was not even allowed to send them back, since the\r\nwhole Army of Portugal was ordered to march into the Beira.\r\n\r\n  [299] See chapter ii above, pp. 54, 55.\r\n\r\nSoult, therefore, was justified in his wrath when he wrote to Marmont\r\nthat he had been given a promise and that it had been broken, ‘if there\r\nhad been the least attempt to concert operations between the armies of\r\nPortugal and the South, the English army would have been destroyed, and\r\nBadajoz would still be in the power of the Emperor. I deplore bitterly\r\nthe fact that you have not been able to come to an arrangement with me\r\non the subject.’ But the wrath should have been directed against the\r\nEmperor, not against his lieutenant, who had so unwillingly been forced\r\nto break his promise. The only censure, perhaps, that can be laid upon\r\nMarmont is that he should have made it more clear to Soult that, by\r\nthe new directions from Paris, he was rendered unable to redeem his\r\npledge. Soult was not, however, without warnings that something of the\r\nkind might happen: Berthier had written to him on February 11th, and\r\nthe letter must have arrived by the middle of March, that the Emperor\r\nwas displeased to find him appealing for troops of the Army of Portugal\r\nto be moved to Truxillo, and that he ought to be more dependent on his\r\nown strength[300]. It would have been better if the Emperor’s trusty\r\nscribe had explained to Soult that Marmont was expressly forbidden, in\r\na dispatch written that same day, to keep more than one division on the\r\nTagus, or to worry himself about the danger of Badajoz.\r\n\r\n  [300] Berthier to Soult, Feb. 11. The same date as the fatal\r\n  dispatch sent to Marmont, who was given a copy of that to Soult\r\n  as an enclosure.\r\n\r\nMarmont’s original plan for joining Soult via Almaraz might have\r\nfailed--he himself confesses it in one of his replies to Berthier. But\r\nit was the only scheme which presented any prospect of success. By\r\nmaking it impossible Napoleon rendered the fall of Badajoz certain. For\r\nit is no defence whatever to point out that his dispatch of March 12th,\r\nwhich reached Salamanca on March 27, finally gave Marmont the option\r\nof going southward. By that time it was too late to try the move:--if\r\nthe Duke of Ragusa had marched for Almaraz and Truxillo next morning,\r\nhe would still have been many days too late to join Soult before April\r\n6th, the date on which Badajoz fell.\r\n\r\nSumming up the whole operation, we must conclude that Wellington’s\r\nplan, which depended for its efficacy on the slowness with which\r\nthe French always received information, and the difficulty which\r\nthey always experienced in concentrating and feeding large bodies of\r\ntroops in winter or early spring, was bound to be successful, unless\r\nan improbable conjunction of chances had occurred. If Marmont and\r\nSoult had both taken the alarm at the earliest possible moment, and\r\nhad each marched with the strongest possible field army, Soult with\r\nthe 25,000 men that he actually collected, Marmont with the three\r\ndivisions that lay on the Tagus on March 1st, and three more from\r\nCastile[301], they might have met east of Merida somewhere about the\r\nlast days of March. In that case their united strength would have been\r\nfrom 50,000 to 55,000 men: Wellington had as many, so that he would\r\nnot have been bound down to the mere defensive policy that he took\r\nup on the Caya in June-July 1811, when his numbers were decidedly\r\nless than now. But the chance that both Marmont and Soult would do\r\nthe right thing in the shortest possible time was unlikely. They\r\nwould have had terrible difficulties from the torrential rains that\r\nprevailed in the last ten days of March, and the consequent badness of\r\nthe roads. Marmont’s (if not Soult’s) food-problem would have been a\r\nhard one, as he himself shows in several of his letters. Soult got his\r\nfirst definite alarm on March 11th: Marmont could hardly move till\r\nhe had learnt that Wellington had started for Estremadura in person:\r\ntill this was certain, he could not be sure that the main body of the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese army was not still behind the Agueda. Wellington only\r\nleft Freneda on March 5th, and Marmont did not know of his departure\r\ntill some days later. If the two marshals had each issued prompt\r\nconcentration orders on March 11, it still remains very doubtful if\r\nthey would have met in time to foil Wellington’s object. As a matter of\r\nfact Soult (as we have seen) delayed for nine days before he determined\r\nto concentrate his field-force and march on Badajoz, and this lateness\r\nwould have wrecked the combination, even if Marmont had been more ready\r\nthan his colleague.\r\n\r\n  [301] More probably he would have brought only _two_ divisions\r\n  from north of the mountains, as he had to leave Bonnet to look\r\n  after the Asturians, and Souham’s single division would hardly\r\n  have sufficed to contain the Galicians, the Portuguese, and the\r\n  Guerrilleros.\r\n\r\nStill there was some chance that the armies might have joined, if\r\nNapoleon had not intervened with his misguided refusal to allow Marmont\r\nto keep three divisions in the valley of the Tagus or to ‘worry about\r\naffairs that did not concern him.’ Wellington could not know of these\r\norders: hence came his anxieties, and his determination to hurry the\r\nsiege of Badajoz to a conclusion at the earliest possible date. He was\r\nnever--as it turned out--in serious danger, but he could not possibly\r\nbe aware of the fact that Marmont was fettered by his instructions. It\r\nwas only the gradual accumulation of reports proving that the Army of\r\nPortugal was moving against Ciudad Rodrigo, and not on Almaraz, that\r\nfinally gave him comparative ease of mind with regard to the situation.\r\nAs to Soult, he somewhat over-estimated his force, taking it at 30,000\r\nor even 35,000 men rather than the real 25,000: this was, no doubt,\r\nthe reason why he resolved to fight with his ‘covering army’ ranged on\r\nthe Albuera position, and not farther forward. If he had known that\r\non April 1 Soult had only 13,000 men at Monasterio, and was still\r\nseparated from Drouet, he might possibly have been more enterprising.\r\n\r\nNo signs of Marmont’s arrival being visible, Wellington could afford\r\nto contemplate with great equanimity Soult’s position at Villafranca\r\non April 7th. If the Marshal moved forward he would be beaten--but it\r\nwas almost certain that he would move back at once, for, as it will\r\nbe remembered, precautions had been taken to give him an alarming\r\ndistraction in his rear, by means of the operations of Penne Villemur\r\nand Ballasteros[302]. This combination worked with perfect success,\r\nfar more accurately than Blake’s similar raid on Seville had done in\r\nJune 1811. Ballasteros, it is true, did much less than was in his\r\npower. He started from his refuge under the guns of Gibraltar, passed\r\ndown from the Ronda mountains, and reached Utrera, in the plain of the\r\nGuadalquivir less than twenty miles from Seville, on April 4. But he\r\nthen swerved away, having done more to alarm than to hurt the French,\r\nthough he had a force of 10,000 infantry and 800 horse[303], sufficient\r\nto have put Seville in serious peril. But Penne Villemur and Morillo,\r\nthough they had not half the numbers of Ballasteros, accomplished all\r\nthat Wellington required: having slipped into the Condado de Niebla\r\nalmost unobserved, they pushed rapidly eastward, and occupied San Lucar\r\nla Mayor, only twelve miles from Seville, on April 4, the same day\r\nthat Ballasteros appeared at Utrera. Their cavalry pushed up so boldly\r\ntoward the suburbs that they had to be driven off by cannon-shot from\r\nthe _tête-de-pont_ at the bridge of Triana. General Rignoux, governor\r\nof Seville, had a very motley and insufficient garrison, as Wellington\r\nhad calculated when he sent Penne Villemur forth. The only organized\r\nunits were a battalion of ‘Swiss’ Juramentados--really adventurers\r\nof all nations--and a regiment of Spanish horse, making 1,500 men\r\naltogether: the rest consisted of convalescents and weakly men\r\nbelonging to the regiments in the Cadiz Lines, and of 600 dismounted\r\ndragoons. These made up some 2,000 men more, but many were not fit to\r\nbear arms. In addition there were some companies of the recently raised\r\n‘National Guards.’ The enormous size of Seville, and the weakness\r\nof its old wall, compelled Rignoux to concentrate his force in the\r\nfortified Cartuja convent, leaving only small posts at the gates and\r\nthe bridge. He sent at once, as Wellington had hoped, pressing appeals\r\nto Soult, saying that he was beset by 14,000 men, and that the citizens\r\nwould probably rise and let in the enemy.\r\n\r\n  [302] See above, p. 229.\r\n\r\n  [303] Infantry divisions of Cruz Murgeon (5,400 men) and the\r\n  Prince of Anglona (4,300 men) and five squadrons of horse,\r\n  besides irregulars.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th Ballasteros received false news that Conroux was marching\r\nagainst him with the troops from the Cadiz Lines, and drew back into\r\nthe mountains. It is said that he was wilfully deceived by persons in\r\nthe French interest; at any rate he must have been badly served by his\r\ncavalry and intelligence officers, who ought to have been able to tell\r\nhim that there was no foundation for the report. Penne and Morillo,\r\nhowever, though disappointed at failing to meet their colleague’s army,\r\nmade a great parade of their small force under the walls of Seville,\r\nand skirmished with the French at the bridge-head of Triana, and under\r\nthe walls of the Cartuja, so boldly that Rignoux expected a serious\r\nattack. They could only have accomplished something more profitable if\r\nthe people of Seville had risen, but no disturbance took place. After\r\nremaining in front of the place all the 7th and 8th of April, they\r\ndisappeared on the 9th, having received news of the fall of Badajoz,\r\nand drawn the correct deduction that Soult would turn back to hunt them\r\nwhen freed from his other task. Wellington, indeed, had written to give\r\nthem warning to that effect on the very morning that they retired[304]:\r\nbut they anticipated the danger, and were safely behind the Rio Tinto\r\nwhen Soult turned up in hot haste at Seville on the 11th, after four\r\ndays of exhausting forced marches.\r\n\r\n  [304] Wellington to Col. Austin from Badajoz, April 9.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal had left the two divisions of Drouet and Daricau with\r\nPerreymond’s cavalry in Estremadura, to act as an observing force,\r\nand had marched with his remaining 13,000 men to save Seville, which\r\nowing to Ballasteros’s timidity had never been in any real danger. But\r\nthe Spanish diversion had nevertheless had precisely the effect that\r\nWellington had expected and desired. During Soult’s short absence of\r\ntwelve days great part of the open country of Andalusia had fallen out\r\nof his control, the communications with La Mancha and King Joseph had\r\nbeen cut off, and the guerrilleros had blockaded all the smaller French\r\nposts. The hold of the invaders upon the kingdom was never so secure as\r\nit had been before the fall of Badajoz.\r\n\r\nBallasteros, after his fiasco in front of Seville, made two fruitless\r\nattempts against isolated French garrisons. He failed at the Castle\r\nof Zahara on April 11th. One of his columns in an assault on Osuna\r\ntwo days later got into the town and killed or captured 60 of the\r\ndefenders, but failed to take the citadel, where the remainder defended\r\nthemselves till Pierre Soult was reported to be at hand, and the\r\nSpaniards withdrew[305]. He ended his campaign of raids, however, with\r\na more successful stroke. Hearing that the brigadier Rey, with three\r\nbattalions and some dragoons, was marching from Malaga to relieve\r\nthe garrison of Ronda, he fell upon him at Alhaurin on the 14th with\r\nhis main body, encompassed him with fourfold strength, and drove him\r\nin rout back to Malaga, capturing his two guns and inflicting more\r\nthan 200 casualties upon him[306]. Ballasteros then hoped to seize\r\non Malaga, where the French were much alarmed, and prepared to shut\r\nthemselves up in the citadel of Gibalfaro. But the news that Pierre\r\nSoult and Conroux were approaching with a strong column caused the\r\nSpaniards to retire to the mountains above Gibraltar [April 19th]. Thus\r\nthe operations in Andalusia, which had opened with Soult’s march to\r\nBadajoz, came to an end, with no ruinous disaster to the French, but\r\nwith a diminution of their prestige, and a distinct weakening of their\r\nhold on the kingdom. In the Condado de Niebla Soult made no attempt\r\nto reoccupy lost ground, and east of Granada his line of posts had\r\nrecoiled considerably on the Murcian side: Baza and Ubeda had been\r\nabandoned for good. It was but a vain boast when the Marshal wrote to\r\nBerthier that, after he had set all things to rights in the central\r\nparts of Andalusia, he intended to organize a general concentration to\r\ncrush Ballasteros, and that his next task would be to lay siege for a\r\nsecond time to Tarifa, ‘the loss of which place would be more injurious\r\nto the English and the Insurgents than that of Alicante, or even that\r\nof Badajoz--against which last-named fortress I ought to make no\r\nattack till I shall have finished matters on the Tarifa side, and so\r\nhave nothing to fear on my left flank[307].’\r\n\r\n  [305] Napier, I know not on what authority, says that Osuna was\r\n  only defended by ‘Juramentados’ who made a gallant resistance\r\n  against their own countrymen. But Soult, in a letter to Berthier\r\n  dated April 21 from Seville, says that Osuna was held by some\r\n  companies of the 43rd Line and a detachment of the 21st Dragoons.\r\n  He cannot be wrong. Moreover, the 43rd shows losses at Osuna,\r\n  April 13, in Martinien’s tables.\r\n\r\n  [306] Martinien’s tables show three officers killed and nine\r\n  wounded at ‘Alora near Malaga’ on this date, in the 43rd, 58th\r\n  Line, and 21st Dragoons. Soult’s dispatch makes out that only\r\n  Rey’s advanced guard under Maransin was cut up, and that the\r\n  main body defeated the Spaniards. If so, why did they retreat on\r\n  Malaga?\r\n\r\n  [307] Soult to Berthier from Seville, April 17, 1812.\r\n\r\nTo complete the survey of the fortunes of the Army of the South in\r\nApril, it only remains that we should mention the doings of Drouet,\r\nnow left once more with his two old divisions to form the ‘corps of\r\nobservation’ opposite the Anglo-Portuguese. Soult during his retreat\r\nhad dropped his lieutenant at Llerena, with orders to give back on\r\nSeville without fighting any serious action, if the enemy should\r\npursue him in force, but if he were left alone to hold his ground,\r\npush his cavalry forward, and keep a strong detachment as near the\r\nUpper Guadiana as possible. For only by placing troops at Campanario,\r\nMedellin, and (if possible) Merida, could communication be kept up via\r\nTruxillo and Almaraz with the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, Drouet was not to be permitted to occupy such a\r\nforward position as Soult would have liked. He was closely followed\r\nby Stapleton Cotton, with Le Marchant’s and Slade’s heavy and\r\nPonsonby’s[308] light cavalry brigades, who brought his rearguard\r\nto action at Villagarcia outside Llerena on April 11th. This was\r\na considerable fight. Drouet’s horse was in position to cover the\r\nretirement of his infantry, with Lallemand’s dragoons in first line,\r\nand Perreymond’s hussars and chasseurs in support. Lallemand evidently\r\nthought that he had only Ponsonby’s brigade in front of him, as Le\r\nMarchant’s was coming up by a side-road covered by hills, and Slade’s\r\nwas far out of sight to the rear. Accordingly he accepted battle on an\r\nequal front, each side having three regiments in line. But, just as the\r\ncharge was delivered, the 5th Dragoon Guards, Le Marchant’s leading\r\nregiment, came on the ground from the right, and, rapidly deploying,\r\ntook the French line in flank and completely rolled it up[309]. The\r\nenemy went to the rear in confusion, and the pursuit was continued\r\ntill, half-way between Villagarcia and Llerena, the French rallied on\r\ntheir reserve (2nd Hussars) behind a broad ditch. Cotton, who had not\r\nlet his men get out of hand, re-formed Anson’s brigade and delivered\r\na second successful charge, which drove the French in upon Drouet’s\r\ninfantry, which was in order of battle to the left of Llerena town. It\r\nwas impossible to do more, as three cavalry brigades could not attack\r\n12,000 men of all arms in a good position. But a few hours later the\r\nwhole French corps was seen in retreat eastward: it retired to Berlanga\r\nand Azuaga on the watershed of the Sierra Morena, completely abandoning\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\n  [308] This officer was in command of the brigade of Anson, then\r\n  absent on leave, which at this time consisted of the 12th, 14th,\r\n  and 16th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [309] There is a good account of all this in the admirable diary\r\n  of Tomlinson of the 16th, which I so often have had to cite. He\r\n  has an interesting note that the 16th in their charge found a\r\n  stone wall in their way, and that the whole regiment took it in\r\n  their stride, and continued their advance in perfect order (p.\r\n  150).\r\n\r\nThe French (outnumbered, if Slade’s brigade be counted, but it was far\r\nto the rear and never put in line) lost 53 killed and wounded and 4\r\nofficers and 132 rank and file taken prisoners. Cotton’s casualties\r\nwere 14 killed and 2 officers and 35 men wounded: he insisted that\r\nhis success would have been much greater if Ponsonby had held back a\r\nlittle longer, till the whole of Le Marchant’s squadrons came on the\r\nfield--Lallemand would then have been cut off from Llerena and his line\r\nof retreat, and the greater part of his brigade ought to have been\r\ncaptured, though the light cavalry in the second line might have got\r\noff[310]. However, the affair was very creditable to all concerned.\r\n\r\n  [310] Soult only acknowledges a loss of three officers and\r\n  about 110 men in his dispatch of April 21 to Berthier, adding\r\n  the ridiculous statement that the British had 100 killed and\r\n  many more wounded, and that the 5th Dragoon Guards had been\r\n  practically destroyed. Martinien’s tables show four French\r\n  officers wounded and one killed, but (of course) take no account\r\n  of unwounded prisoners. The British lost two missing, men who had\r\n  ridden ahead in the pursuit into the French infantry.\r\n\r\nHill’s infantry did not follow the retreating French, and had halted\r\nabout Almendralejo and Villafranca, only the cavalry having gone on in\r\npursuit to Llerena. The rest of the Anglo-Portuguese army was already\r\nin movement for the North, as Wellington had given up the idea, which\r\nhad somewhat tempted him at first, of pursuing Soult to Seville and\r\ntrying to upset the whole fabric of French power in Andalusia. Of this\r\nmore in its due place. Suffice it to say here that he fell back on his\r\nold partition of forces, leaving Hill in Estremadura as his ‘corps of\r\nobservation’, with precisely the same force that he had been given in\r\n1811, save that one British cavalry brigade (that of Slade) was added.\r\nThe rest of the corps consisted of the 2nd Division, Hamilton’s two\r\nPortuguese brigades, Long’s British and John Campbell’s Portuguese\r\nhorse[311]. The whole amounted to about 14,000 men, sufficient not\r\nonly to hold Drouet in check, but also to keep an eye upon the French\r\ntroops in the valley of the Tagus, against whom Wellington was now\r\nmeditating a raid of the sort that he had already sketched out in his\r\ncorrespondence with Hill in February.\r\n\r\n  [311] This was the brigade formerly under Barbaçena, 4th and 10th\r\n  regiments.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Army of Andalusia and its fortunes in April 1812. We\r\nmust now turn to those of Marmont and the Army of Portugal during the\r\nsame critical weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ragusa, as it will be remembered, had been caught at\r\nSalamanca, on March 27th, by Napoleon’s dispatch giving him an\r\nover-late option of detaching troops to the relief of Badajoz. But\r\nbeing already committed to the invasion of Portugal prescribed by\r\nthe Emperor’s earlier letters, and having his field-force and his\r\nmagazines disposed for that project, he had resolved to proceed with\r\nit, though he had no great belief in the results that would follow\r\nfrom his taking the offensive[312]. As he informed his master, there\r\nwas nothing at which he could strike effectively. ‘It would seem that\r\nHis Majesty thinks that Lord Wellington has magazines close behind the\r\nfrontier of northern Portugal. Not so. These magazines are at Abrantes,\r\nor in Estremadura. His hospitals are at Lisbon, Castello Branco, and\r\nAbrantes. There is nothing of any importance to him on the Coa.’ And\r\nhow was Almeida or Ciudad Rodrigo to be assailed in such a way as to\r\ncause Wellington any disquietude, when the Army of Portugal had not a\r\nsingle heavy gun left? ‘General Dorsenne had the happy idea of leaving\r\nin Rodrigo, a fortress of inferior character on the front of our line,\r\nthe whole siege-train prepared for this army at great expense, so that\r\nnew guns of large calibre must actually be brought up from France.’\r\n\r\n  [312] Mes dispositions étant faites pour une marche de quinze\r\n  jours sur l’Agueda, déjà commencée, je continue ce mouvement,\r\n  sans cependant (je le répète) avoir une très grande confiance\r\n  dans les résultats qu’il doit donner.’ Marmont to Berthier, March\r\n  27.\r\n\r\nMarmont’s striking force was not so large as he would have wished.\r\nBonnet was, by the Emperor’s orders, beginning his advance for the\r\nreoccupation of the Asturias. Foy was in the valley of the Tagus.\r\nSouham had to be left on the Esla, to observe the Army of Galicia.\r\nThis left five divisions for active operations: but the Marshal came\r\nto the conclusion that he must split up one more (Ferey’s) to hold\r\nValladolid, Salamanca, Zamora, Toro, Avila, Benavente, and other\r\nplaces, which in an elaborate calculation sent to Berthier he showed\r\nto require 4,910 men for their garrisons. He therefore marched with\r\nfour infantry divisions only [Clausel, Maucune, Sarrut, Brennier]\r\nand 1,500 light cavalry, about 25,000 men in all: his division of\r\ndragoons was left behind in Leon, to keep open communication between\r\nhis various garrisons. A rather illusory help was sought by sending to\r\nFoy, who then lay at Almaraz, orders to the effect that he might push\r\na detachment to Plasencia, and give out that he was about to join the\r\nmain army by the pass of Perales. But Foy’s real concern, as he was\r\ntold, was to keep up communication with the Army of the South, and to\r\ngive any help that was possible on the side of Truxillo, if (by some\r\nimprobable chance) the Army of the Centre should be able to lend him\r\nthe aid of any appreciable number of battalions.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th the French army appeared in front of Rodrigo, and Carlos\r\nde España, leaving 3,000 men as garrison there, under General Vives,\r\nretired with the small remainder of his division towards the Portuguese\r\nfrontier. He was pursued and molested by the enemy’s cavalry, not\r\nhaving been covered or assisted, as Wellington had directed, by Victor\r\nAlten’s regiment of German Hussars. That officer, neglecting his\r\norders in the most flagrant fashion, did not retire slowly and in a\r\nfighting posture, when the French drove in his line of vedettes in\r\nfront of Rodrigo, but collected his regiment and rode hard for Castello\r\nBranco, without concerning himself in the least as to the safety of the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese forces in his neighbourhood, or the procuring of\r\nintelligence as to the strength and the purpose of the French army. His\r\ncarelessness or shirking of responsibility, which was to be displayed\r\nin still worse form as the campaign went on, drew on him such a sharp\r\nand bitter rebuke from Wellington that it is a wonder that he was not\r\nsent home forthwith[313].\r\n\r\n  [313] Wellington to V. Alten, April 18, ‘You were desired “not to\r\n  be in a hurry,” to give them (España and General Baccelar) your\r\n  countenance so far as might be in your power, and to tell them\r\n  that you were left in the front for a particular object.... I\r\n  beg you to observe that if you had assembled the 1st Hussars at\r\n  Pastores on March 30 and April 1, the Agueda being then scarcely\r\n  fordable for cavalry, you could have kept open the communications\r\n  between Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo.... You wrote on the seventh\r\n  from Castello Branco that you knew nothing about the enemy! and\r\n  instead of receiving from you (as I had expected) a daily account\r\n  of their operations, you knew nothing, and, from the way in which\r\n  you made your march, all those were driven off the road who might\r\n  have given me intelligence, and were destined to keep up the\r\n  communication between me and Carlos de España.’\r\n\r\nMarmont looked at Rodrigo, but refused to attempt anything against\r\nit, though he was informed that the garrison was undisciplined and\r\ndispirited. Without siege artillery he held that it was useless\r\nto attack the place. After sending in a formal summons to Vives\r\n(who gave the proper negative answer in round terms), and throwing\r\ninto the streets a few shells from the howitzers attached to his\r\nfield-batteries, he told off Brennier’s division to blockade Rodrigo,\r\nas also to guard a flying bridge which he cast across the Agueda at La\r\nCaridad, a few miles up-stream.\r\n\r\nHis next move was to send forward Clausel with two divisions to\r\ninvestigate the state of Almeida. He had heard that its walls were\r\nunfinished, and thought that there might be some chance of executing a\r\n_coup-de-main_ against it. The general, however, came back next day,\r\nreporting that he thought the scheme impossible. He had apparently been\r\ndeterred from pressing in upon the place both by the defiant attitude\r\nof the governor, Le Mesurier, whose outposts skirmished outside the\r\nwalls for some time before allowing themselves to be driven in, and\r\nstill more by the sight of a considerable force of Portuguese troops\r\nencamped close to the town on the other side of the Coa. This was\r\nTrant’s militia, the first detachment that had got to the front of the\r\nvarious bodies of troops which Wellington had told off for the defence\r\nof the Beira. They had taken up the strong position behind the bridge\r\nof the Coa, which Craufurd had so obstinately defended against Ney in\r\nJuly 1810.\r\n\r\nOn the alarm being given on March 29th that Marmont was marching\r\nagainst that province, and not against Galicia or the Tras-os-Montes,\r\nWellington’s orders suiting that contingency were carried out with more\r\nor less accuracy. Silveira, with the Tras-os-Montes militia and his\r\nsmall body of regular cavalry, began to move on Lamego, where Baccelar,\r\nthe chief commander in the North, had concentrated the regiments from\r\nthe Oporto region and the Beira Alta, even before Marmont had left\r\nSalamanca. General Abadia had been requested to press forward against\r\nthe French on the Esla, so as to threaten the flank and rear of the\r\ninvading army. He did not accomplish much, being convinced that the\r\nforces left opposite him were too strong to be lightly meddled with.\r\nBut he directed a raid to be made from the Western Asturias towards\r\nthe city of Leon, and the division at Puebla de Senabria threatened\r\nBenavente. Both movements were executed too late to be of any\r\nimportance in affecting the course of the campaign.\r\n\r\nBaccelar had been ordered to avoid committing himself to a general\r\naction with any large body of the enemy, but to show such a mass of\r\ntroops concentrated that Marmont would have to keep his main body\r\ntogether, and to act cautiously on the offensive. His primary duty was\r\nto cover, if possible, the large magazines at São João de Pesqueira and\r\nLamego on the Douro, and the smaller ones at Villa da Ponte, Pinhel,\r\nand Celorico. To these Wellington attached much importance, as they\r\nwere the intermediate dépôts from which his army drew its sustenance\r\nwhen it was on the northern frontier, and he knew that he would be\r\nrequiring them again ere many weeks had passed. As long as Marmont\r\nremained near Almeida, it was necessary to keep a force as far forward\r\nas possible, behind the very defensible line of the Coa, and Trant\r\nwas advanced for this purpose, though he was directed not to commit\r\nhimself. His presence so close to Almeida was very valuable, as he\r\nwould have to be driven off before the Marshal formally invested the\r\nplace. Le Mesurier, the governor, was not at all comfortable as to\r\nhis position: though he had a proportion of British artillery left\r\nwith him, the whole of the infantry of the garrison consisted of Beira\r\nmilitia, who had no experience under arms. On taking over charge of the\r\nplace, on March 18, the governor had complained that though the walls\r\nwere in a sufficient state of repair, and there were plenty of guns\r\nforthcoming, yet few or none of them were mounted ready for service,\r\nthe powder magazines were insufficiently sheltered, and many details\r\nof fortification (palisades, platforms, &c.) had to be completed in a\r\nhurry[314]. However, the place looked so sound for defence when Clausel\r\nreconnoitred it, that--as we have seen--he made no attempt to invest\r\nit, and promptly withdrew, reporting to his chief that Almeida was not\r\nto be taken by a _coup-de-main_.\r\n\r\n  [314] For complaints by Le Mesurier as to the defects of the\r\n  place when he took over charge of it on March 18, see his letter\r\n  of the 28th of the same month, to Wellington, in the Appendix to\r\n  Napier, iv. pp. 450-1.\r\n\r\nMarmont then made the move which Wellington had most desired, and\r\nwhich in his dispatch to Baccelar he had specified as the happiest\r\nthing that could come about. Instead of sitting down before Almeida or\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, or making a push against the dépôts on the Douro, he\r\nturned southward towards the Lower Beira, and (leaving Brennier behind\r\nto guard communications) marched with three divisions to Sabugal via\r\nFuente Guinaldo. This policy could have no great results--the Marshal\r\nmight ravage the country-side, but such a movement with such a force\r\ncould not possibly alarm Wellington overmuch, or draw him away from\r\nthe siege of Badajoz if he were determined to persevere in it. There\r\nwas nothing of importance to him in central Beira--only minor dépôts\r\nat Celorico and Castello Branco, much less valuable than the larger\r\nones at Lamego and São João de Pesqueira on the Douro. ‘He can do no\r\nmore,’ as an acute observer on the Portuguese staff remarked, ‘than\r\ndrive off some cattle, burn some cottages, and ruin a few wretched\r\npeasants[315].’ For the country about the sources of the Zezere and\r\nround Castello Branco is one of the most thinly peopled districts of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n  [315] The observation comes from D’Urban’s unpublished Journal.\r\n\r\nTo meet Marmont’s southern move Baccelar brought up Trant’s and\r\nWilson’s militia by a parallel march to Guarda, while Le Cor, with\r\nthe two regiments of the Beira Baixa, held on at Castello Branco till\r\nhe should be evicted from it. To Wellington’s intense disgust[316],\r\nVictor Alten, whose orders directed him to fall back no farther than\r\nthat town, continued his precipitate retreat with the German Hussars\r\nto the bridge of Villa Velha on the Tagus, and began to take measures\r\nto destroy that all-important link of communications between north and\r\nsouth. Fortunately he was stopped before he had done the damage. The\r\nbridge was only taken over to the south bank, not committed to the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\n  [316] Wellington to Alten, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 69. ‘You were\r\n  positively ordered by your instructions to go to Castello Branco\r\n  and no farther. The reason for this instruction was obvious.\r\n  First the militia of Lower Beira would be there in the case\r\n  supposed [that of Marmont’s making an invasion south of the\r\n  Douro], and they _were_ there. Secondly, as soon as I should\r\n  be informed of the enemy’s approach to the Coa, it would be\r\n  necessary for me to assemble a force at Castello Branco--of\r\n  which the foundation would be the 1st Hussars K.G.L. Yet\r\n  notwithstanding my orders you marched from Castello Branco on\r\n  the 8th, and crossed the Tagus on the 9th. Till I received your\r\n  letter I did not conceive it possible that you could so far\r\n  disregard your instructions.’\r\n\r\nHalting at Sabugal, on April 8th, Marmont sent out flying columns,\r\nwhich ravaged the country-side as far as Penamacor, Fundão, and\r\nCovilhão, and dispatched Clausel with a whole division against Castello\r\nBranco, the one important place in the whole region. Le Cor evacuated\r\nit on April 12th, after burning such of the magazines as could not be\r\nremoved in haste: and Clausel--who occupied it for two days--did not\r\ntherefore get possession of the stores of food which his chief had\r\nhoped to find there. In revenge the town and the small proportion of\r\nits inhabitants who did not take to the hills were badly maltreated:\r\nmany buildings, including the bishop’s palace, were burnt.\r\n\r\nHearing that Marmont had dispersed the larger portion of his army with\r\nflying columns, and was lying at Sabugal, on the 12th, with only a few\r\nthousand men, Trant conceived the rash idea that it would be possible\r\nto surprise him, at his head-quarters, by a night march of his own\r\nand Wilson’s combined divisions from Guarda. The distance was about\r\ntwenty miles over mountain roads, and the scheme must have led to\r\ndisaster, for--contrary to the information which the militia generals\r\nhad gathered--the Marshal’s concentrated main body was still stronger\r\nthan their own, despite of all his detachments[317]. ‘You could not\r\nhave succeeded in your attempt, and you would have lost your division\r\nand that of General Wilson[318],’ wrote Wellington to Trant, when\r\nthe scheme and its failure were reported to him a week later. It was\r\nfortunately never tried, owing to Baccelar’s having made objections to\r\nhis subordinate’s hare-brained plan.\r\n\r\n  [317] I cannot resist quoting here, as an example of Trant’s\r\n  over-daring and reckless temperament, his letter to Wilson,\r\n  urging him to co-operate in the raid, which was lent me by\r\n  Wilson’s representative of to-day:--\r\n\r\n    GUARDA, 11th _April_, 1812.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR WILSON,--I arrived last night. Hasten up your division:\r\n  there never was a finer opportunity of destroying a French corps,\r\n  in other words and in my opinion, their 2nd Division: but I have\r\n  no certainty of what force is the enemy. At any rate send me\r\n  your squadron of cavalry, or even _twenty_ dragoons. I am very\r\n  ill-treated by Baccelar in regard to cavalry. Push on yourself\r\n  personally. You know how happy I shall be in having you once more\r\n  as the partner of my operations. Order up everything you can from\r\n  Celorico to eat: here there is _nothing_.--Yrs. N. T.\r\n\r\n  The French 2nd Division was Clausel’s, as it chanced, the one\r\n  that was precisely _not_ at Sabugal, but executing the raid on\r\n  Castello Branco.\r\n\r\n  [318] Wellington to Trant, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 73.\r\n\r\nBut the best comment on the enterprise is that on the very night\r\n(April 13-14) which Trant had fixed for his march, he was himself\r\nsurprised by Marmont, so bad had been his arrangements for watching the\r\ncountry-side. The Marshal had learnt that there was an accumulation\r\nof militia at Guarda threatening his flank, and resolved to give it\r\na lesson. He started with a brigade each from Sarrut’s and Maucune’s\r\ndivisions and five squadrons of light cavalry--about 7,000 men--and\r\nwas, at dawn, on the 14th, at the foot of the hill of Guarda, where\r\nhe had the good luck to cut off all Trant’s outposts without their\r\nfiring a shot--so badly did the militia keep their look-out. ‘Had he\r\nonly dashed headlong into the town he might have captured Wilson’s and\r\nmy divisions without losing probably a single man,’ wrote Trant. But\r\nthe ascent into Guarda was long and steep, and Marmont, who had only\r\ncavalry up, did not guess how careless were his adversaries. He took\r\nproper military precautions and waited for his infantry: meanwhile the\r\nPortuguese were roused, almost by chance as it seems. ‘My distrust of\r\nthe militia with regard to the execution of precautions,’ continues\r\nTrant, ‘had induced me at all times to have a drummer at my bedroom\r\ndoor, in readiness to beat to arms. This was most fortunately the case\r\non the night of April 13, 1812, for the first intimation that I had of\r\nthe enemy being near at hand was given me by my servant, on bringing me\r\nmy coffee at daybreak on the 14th. He said that there was such a report\r\nin the street, and that the soldiers were assembling at the alarm\r\nrendezvous. I instantly beat to arms, and the beat being as instantly\r\ntaken up by every drummer in the place, Marmont, who was at that very\r\nmoment with his cavalry at the entrance of the town, held back. I was\r\nmyself the first man out of the town, and he was not then 400 yards\r\naway[319].’\r\n\r\n  [319] Narrative of Trant in Napier’s Appendix to vol. iv. p. 451.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal, in his account of the affair, says that the Portuguese\r\nformed up on the heights by the town, apparently ready to fight, but\r\ndrew off rapidly so soon as he had prepared for a regular attack on\r\nthe position. Wise not quite in time, the two militia generals sent\r\ntheir men at a trot down the steep road at the back of the place, with\r\nthe single troop of regular dragoons that they possessed bringing\r\nup the rear. It had now begun to rain in torrents, and Trant and\r\nWilson having obtained two or three miles start, and being able to\r\nsee no distance owing to the downpour, thought that they had got\r\noff safe. This was not the case: Marmont realized that his infantry\r\ncould not catch them, but seeing their hurry and disorder ordered his\r\ncavalry--his own escort-squadron and the 13th Chasseurs--to pursue\r\nand charge the rearguard of the retreating column. They overtook it\r\nby the bridge of Faya, three miles outside Guarda, where the road to\r\nCelorico descends on a steep slope to cross the river. The leading\r\nFrench squadron scattered the forty dragoons at the tail of Trant’s\r\ndivision, and rode on, mixed with them, against the rearguard battalion\r\n(that of Oporto). The militiamen, startled and caught utterly by\r\nsurprise, tried to form across the road and to open fire: but the rain\r\nhad damped their cartridges, and hardly a musket gave fire. Thereupon\r\nthe battalion went to pieces, the men nearest the French throwing\r\ndown their guns and asking for quarter, while those behind scattered\r\nuphill or downhill from the road, seeking safety on the steep slopes.\r\nThe charge swept downhill on to the battalion of Aveiro, and the other\r\nsuccessive units of the Oporto brigade, which broke up in confusion.\r\nFive of their six colours were taken, and 1,500 prisoners were cut off,\r\nwhile some tumbled into the Mondego and were drowned, by losing their\r\nfooting on the steep hillside. Hardly a Frenchman fell, and not very\r\nmany Portuguese, for the _chasseurs_, finding that they had to deal\r\nwith helpless militiamen who made no resistance, were sparing with\r\nthe sabre[320]. The greater part of the prisoners were allowed, in\r\ncontempt, to make off, and only a few hundred and the five flags were\r\nbrought back to Marmont at Guarda. The pursuit did not penetrate so\r\nfar as Wilson’s division, which got across the Mondego while Trant’s\r\nwas being routed, and formed up behind the narrow bridge, where the\r\n_chasseurs_, being a trifling force of 400 men, did not think fit to\r\nattack them. The French infantry had marched over twenty miles already\r\nthat day, and were dead beat: Marmont did not send them down from\r\nGuarda to pursue, in spite of the brilliant success of his cavalry.\r\n\r\n  [320] There is an account of this rout from the French side in\r\n  the _Mémoires_ of Parquin, of the 13th Chasseurs, an officer\r\n  mentioned in Marmont’s dispatch as having taken one of the flags.\r\n  Parquin calls it that of the regiment of _Eurillas_. There was\r\n  no such corps: those which lost standards were Aveiro, Oliveira,\r\n  and Penafiel. A lengthy account may be found also in Beresford’s\r\n  _Ordens do Dia_ for May 7, where blame and praise are carefully\r\n  distributed, and the curious order is made that the disgraced\r\n  regiments are to leave their surviving flags at home, till they\r\n  have washed out the stain on their honour by good service in the\r\n  field.\r\n\r\nThe day after the ‘Rout of Guarda’ Marmont pushed an advanced guard\r\nto Lagiosa, half-way to Celorico, where Trant and Wilson had taken\r\nrefuge, with their ranks short of some 2,000 men scattered in the\r\nhills. Thereupon the militia generals set fire to the stores, and\r\nevacuated Celorico, falling back into the hills towards Trancoso. But\r\nfinding that the French were not coming on, they halted; and when they\r\nascertained that the enemy was actually returning to Guarda, they came\r\nback, extinguished the fires, and rescued great part of the magazines.\r\nMarmont’s unexpected forbearance was caused by the fact that the news\r\nof the fall of Badajoz reached him on the 15th, along with a report\r\nfrom Clausel (who had just evacuated Castello Branco) that Wellington’s\r\narmy had already started northward, and that its advanced guard was\r\nacross the Tagus at Villa Velha.\r\n\r\nThis was startling, nay appalling, intelligence. Badajoz had been\r\nreckoned good for a much longer resistance, and the news had come\r\nso slowly--it had taken nine days to reach Marmont--that it was\r\npossible that the British army was already in a position to cut off\r\nhis expeditionary force from its base on the Agueda. Wherefore Marmont\r\nhastily evacuated Guarda, and was back at Sabugal by the 16th, where\r\nClausel and the other dispersed fractions of his army joined him. Here\r\nhe regarded himself as reasonably safe, but determined to retire behind\r\nthe Spanish frontier ere long, raising the blockade of Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n‘My troops,’ he wrote to Berthier on that day, ‘have used up the little\r\nfood to be gathered between the Tagus and the Zezere; and now that\r\nthe enemy is on the Tagus I cannot possibly remain on the Mondego, as\r\nI should be leaving him on my line of communications. I shall fall\r\nback to the right bank of the Agueda. If the enemy resolves to pursue\r\nme thither I shall fight him. If not I shall fall back on Salamanca,\r\nbecause of the absolute impossibility of feeding an army between the\r\nAgueda and the Tormes.’\r\n\r\nMarmont remained at Sabugal and its neighbourhood for nearly a week--by\r\nthe 22nd he had drawn back a few miles to Fuente Guinaldo--with about\r\n20,000 men. His position was more dangerous than he knew; for on the\r\n18th the heavy rains, which began on the day of the combat of Guarda,\r\nbroke his bridge over the Agueda at La Caridad, so that he was cut off\r\nfrom Brennier and from Salamanca. He was under the impression that\r\nWellington had only brought up a couple of divisions against him, and\r\nthat these were still south of Castello Branco[321], whereas as a\r\nmatter of fact seven had marched; and on the day that he wrote this\r\nincautious estimate Wellington’s headquarters were at Penamacor, the\r\nLight and 3rd Divisions were closing in on Sabugal, the 4th and 5th\r\nwere a full march north of Castello Branco, and the 1st, 6th, and 7th\r\nwere at Losa, quite close to that city. Thirty-six hours more of delay\r\nwould have placed Marmont in the terrible position of finding himself\r\nwith a broken bridge behind him, and 40,000 enemies closing in upon his\r\nfront and flank.\r\n\r\n  [321] Marmont to Berthier: Fuente Guinaldo, April 22. ‘Les\r\n  rapports des prisonniers sont que trois divisions de l’armée\r\n  anglaise reviennent sur le Coa. Mais cette nouvelle ayant été\r\n  donnée avec affectation par les parlementaires, et n’ayant vu\r\n  jamais autre chose que le seul 1er de Hussards Allemands, qui\r\n  était précédemment sur cette rive, et point d’infanterie, ni rien\r\n  qui annonce la présence d’un corps de troupes, je suis autorisé\r\n  à croire que c’est un bruit qu’on a fait courir à dessein, et\r\n  qu’il n’y a pas d’Anglais en présence. Je suis à peu près certain\r\n  qu’il a parti de Portalègre deux divisions, qui se sont portées\r\n  à Villa Velha: mais il me paraît évident qu’elles ne se sont\r\n  beaucoup éloignées du Tage.’ The actual situation was 1st Hussars\r\n  K.G.L. Quadraseyes in front of Sabugal: Light Division, Sabugal:\r\n  3rd Division, Sortelha: 4th Division, Pedrogão, 5th Division,\r\n  Alpedrinha; 1st, 6th, 7th Divisions, Losa: Pack’s Portuguese,\r\n  Memoa. The map will show what a fearful situation Marmont would\r\n  have been in had he halted for another day.\r\n\r\nTo explain the situation, Wellington’s movements after the capture\r\nof Badajoz must now be detailed. It had been his hope, though not\r\nhis expectation, that Soult might have remained at Villafranca after\r\nhearing of the disaster of the 6th April; in this case he had intended\r\nto fall upon him with every available man, crush him by force of\r\nnumbers, and then follow up his routed army into Andalusia, where the\r\nwhole fabric of French occupation must have crumpled up. But Soult\r\nwisely retreated at a sharp pace; and the idea of following him as far\r\nas Seville, there to find him reinforced for a general action by all\r\nthe troops from the Cadiz Lines and Granada, was not so tempting as\r\nthat of bringing him to battle in Estremadura. On the day after the\r\nfall of Badajoz Wellington formulated his intentions in a letter to\r\nLord Liverpool. ‘It would be very desirable that I should have it in\r\nmy power to strike a blow against Marshal Soult, before he could be\r\nreinforced.... But it is not very probable that he will risk an action\r\nin the province of Estremadura, which it would not be difficult for\r\nhim to avoid; and it is necessary for him that he should return to\r\nAndalusia owing to the movements of General Ballasteros and the Conde\r\nde Penne Villemur ... if he should retire into Andalusia I must return\r\nto Castille[322].’\r\n\r\n  [322] Wellington to Liverpool, April 7, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 43.\r\n\r\nThe reason given by Wellington for his resolve to turn north again was\r\nthat Carlos de España had informed him that Ciudad Rodrigo, though\r\notherwise tenable enough, had only provisions for twenty-three\r\ndays, partly from what Wellington called the general policy of\r\n‘Mañana’[323]--of shiftless procrastination--partly from the definite\r\nsingle fact that a very large convoy provided from the British\r\nmagazines on the Douro had been stopped at Almeida on March 30th. This,\r\nin Wellington’s estimation, was the fault of Victor Alten, who, if he\r\nhad held the outposts beyond the Agueda for a day longer, might have\r\ncovered the entry of the convoy into Ciudad Rodrigo[324]. Marmont’s\r\noperations on the Coa and the Agueda would have been quite negligible\r\nfrom the strategic point of view but for this one fact. He might\r\nravage as far as Guarda or Castello Branco without doing any practical\r\nharm, but it could not be permitted that he should starve Rodrigo into\r\nsurrender: even allowing for a firm resistance by the garrison, and a\r\njudicious resort to lessened rations, the place would be in danger from\r\nthe third week of April onward. Wherefore, unless Marmont withdrew into\r\nSpain by the middle of the month, he must be forced to do so, by the\r\ntransference of the main body of the Anglo-Portuguese Army to the North.\r\n\r\n  [323] Wellington to Henry Wellesley, April 4, _Dispatches_, ix.\r\n  p. 29.\r\n\r\n  [324] Wellington to Alten, April 18, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 68,\r\n  ‘I beg to observe that if you had assembled the 1st Hussars at\r\n  Pastores on the 30th March and 1st April ... you would have kept\r\n  open the communication between Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\n  the convoy would probably have got into the latter place.’\r\n\r\nThe Marshal, during the critical days following the fall of Badajoz,\r\nshowed no such intention. Indeed he advanced to Sabugal on the 8th,\r\nseized Castello Branco on the 12th, and executed his raid on Guarda\r\nupon the 13th-14th. Ignorant of the fall of Badajoz, he was naturally\r\nextending the sphere of his operations, under the belief that no\r\nserious force was in his front. While he was overrunning Beira Baixa,\r\nCiudad Rodrigo continued to be blockaded by Brennier, and its stores\r\nwere now running very low.\r\n\r\nOn April 11th[325] Wellington made up his mind that this state of\r\nthings must be brought to an end, and he determined that no mere\r\ndetachment should march, but a force sufficient to overwhelm Marmont\r\nif he could be brought to action. The movement began with the march\r\nof the 11th Light Dragoons and Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese to\r\nElvas on the afternoon of the 11th April, all being ordered to move\r\non Arronches and Portalegre. On the 12th a larger force started off\r\nfrom the camps around Badajoz and on the Albuera position: the 3rd\r\nand Light Divisions moved (following Pack and Bradford) on Portalegre\r\nvia Arronches, the 4th and 5th, making a shorter move, to Campo Mayor\r\non the same road, the 7th from Valverde to Elvas. The 1st and 6th\r\nunder Graham, bringing up the rear, went off on the 13th from Valverde\r\nand Elvas northward. Orders were sent to Stapleton Cotton, then in\r\npursuit of Drouet in southern Estremadura, to come with Anson’s and Le\r\nMarchant’s cavalry brigades to join the main army, leaving only Slade’s\r\nand Long’s to Hill. Bock’s Heavy Dragoon brigade of the King’s German\r\nLegion was also directed to take part in the general movement.\r\n\r\n  [325] The date can be fixed from D’Urban’s Journal: ‘Marmont has\r\n  blockaded Rodrigo, reconnoitred Almeida, and has now made an\r\n  inroad as far as Fundão: all this obliges a movement toward him.\r\n  April 11.’\r\n\r\nOnly Hill, with the troops that had served under him since the summer\r\nof 1811, plus one new cavalry brigade, was left behind in Estremadura\r\nto ‘contain’ Drouet. It was highly unlikely that Soult would be heard\r\nof in that province, as he had his own troubles in Andalusia to keep\r\nhim employed. Indeed Wellington in his parting message to this trusty\r\nlieutenant told him that it was ‘impossible’ that the enemy could\r\nassemble enough troops to incommode him at present, and explained that\r\nhis chief duty would be to cover the repairing of Badajoz, into which\r\nthree Portuguese line regiments[326] under Power, hitherto forming the\r\ngarrisons of Elvas and Abrantes, were thrown, to hold it till Castaños\r\nshould provide 3,000 Spaniards for the purpose.\r\n\r\n  [326] 5th and 17th from Elvas, 22nd from Abrantes.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the army marching against Marmont was rapid and\r\ncontinuous, though it might have been even more swift but for the fact\r\nthat the whole long column had to pass the bridge of Villa Velha, the\r\nonly passage of the Tagus that lay straight on the way to the Lower\r\nBeira: to send troops by Abrantes would have cost too much time. On\r\nthe 16th the Light and 3rd Divisions crossed the bridge, on the 17th\r\nsome cavalry and Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese, while the 4th, 5th,\r\nand 6th Divisions were now close to the river at Castello de Vide and\r\nAlpalhão, and only the 1st was rather to the rear at Portalegre[327].\r\nAlten’s German Hussars, picked up at Castello Branco on the 18th by the\r\nhead of the column, were the only cavalry which Wellington showed in\r\nhis front. This was done on principle: Marmont knew that this regiment\r\nwas in his neighbourhood, and if it pressed in upon his outposts, it\r\ntold him nothing as to the arrival of new troops opposite him. As we\r\nhave already seen, when quoting one of his dispatches[328], he drew the\r\ninference that Wellington intended, and so late as the 22nd believed\r\nthat his adversary’s main army was still behind the Tagus, and that at\r\nmost two divisions had come up to Villa Velha--but probably no further.\r\n\r\n  [327] All these movements are taken from the elaborate tables in\r\n  D’Urban’s Journal for these days.\r\n\r\n  [328] See above, p. 288.\r\n\r\nSteadily advancing, the column, with the 3rd and Light Divisions\r\nleading, reached Castello Branco on the 17th. They found that it had\r\nbeen reoccupied on the 15th by Alten’s Hussars and Le Cor’s militia;\r\nbut it was in a dreadful state of dilapidation owing to the ravages\r\nof Clausel’s troops during the two days of their flying visit. Clear\r\ninformation was received that Marmont was still at Sabugal, and his\r\nvedettes lay as far south as Pedrogão. The British staff were in hopes\r\nthat he might be caught. ‘His ignorance (as we hope) of the real force\r\nin march against him may end in his destruction,’ wrote D’Urban to\r\nCharles Stewart on the 18th, ‘for he has put the Agueda in his rear,\r\nwhich the late rains have made impassable: his situation is very\r\ncritical. If he discovers his error at once, he may get off by his\r\nleft down the Perales road, and so reach Plasencia: but if he does\r\nnot, and waits to be _driven_ out of the ground he holds, I don’t see\r\nhow he is to get away. Lord Wellington will be all closed up by the\r\n21st; meanwhile he shows little to his front, and avoids giving serious\r\nalarm: the fairest hopes may be entertained of a decisive blow[329].’\r\n\r\n  [329] Letter in the D’Urban Papers.\r\n\r\nIt looked indeed as if Marmont was waiting over-long: on the 17th-18th\r\nhis exploring parties came as far south as Idanha Nova, where by an ill\r\nchance they captured Wellington’s most famous intelligence-officer,\r\nMajor Colquhoun Grant, who there commenced that extraordinary\r\nseries of adventures which are told in detail in the life of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Dr. McGrigor, Wellington’s chief medical officer. He\r\nescaped at Bayonne, and returned to England via Paris and the boat of a\r\nBreton fisherman[330].\r\n\r\n  [330] See the _Life of Surgeon-General Sir Jas. McGrigor_, pp.\r\n  284-96. I have before me, among the Scovell papers, Grant’s\r\n  original signed parole as far as Bayonne, witnessed by General\r\n  Lamartinière, the chief of Marmont’s staff. It was captured by\r\n  _Guerrilleros_ in Castile, and sent to Wellington. Accompanying\r\n  it is the General’s private letter, commending Grant to the\r\n  attention of the French police, with the explanation that he was\r\n  only not treated as a spy because he was captured in British\r\n  uniform, though far in the rear of the French outpost line.\r\n\r\nThe rear of the column had dropped behind somewhat, owing to the\r\nincessant rains which had set in from April 14th, and which had broken\r\nMarmont’s bridge four days later. Wellington had given the 4th Division\r\nleave to halt for a day, because of the state of the roads and the\r\nentire want of cover for the night in the desolate tract between\r\nVilla Velha and Abrantes[331]. It reached Castello Branco, however,\r\non the 20th, on which day only (by some extraordinary mismanagement)\r\nWellington got the tardy news of Trant’s disaster at Guarda on the\r\nmorning of the 14th. And this news was brought not by any official\r\nmessenger, but by a fugitive ensign of militia, who garnished it with\r\nall manner of untrue additions--whereupon Beresford had him tried\r\nand shot, for deserting his troops and spreading false intelligence.\r\nClearly Trant, Wilson, and Baccelar between them should have got the\r\ntrue narrative to head-quarters before six days had elapsed.\r\n\r\n  [331] Wellington to Graham, Castello Branco, April 18,\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 70.\r\n\r\nThe 21st April was the critical day of this campaign. Marmont was\r\nstill at Fuente Guinaldo, on the wrong side of the Agueda, and his\r\nbridge at La Caridad was still broken and not relaid. Though unaware\r\nthat Wellington was close upon him with an overwhelming force, whose\r\nexistence he denied (as we have seen) in a letter sent off so late as\r\nthe 22nd, he was yet feeling uncomfortable, both because of his broken\r\ncommunications, and because he had used up his food. Wherefore he gave\r\norders that his artillery, using very bad side-roads, should pass the\r\nAgueda by the bridge of Villarubia, a small mountain crossing quite\r\nnear its source, which would take it, not by the ordinary route past\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, but by Robledo to Tamames, through a very difficult\r\ncountry.[332] He himself with the infantry stood fast on the 21st and\r\n22nd, unaware of his dangerous position.\r\n\r\n  [332] Marmont to Berthier, Fuente Guinaldo, April 22 [original\r\n  intercepted dispatch in Scovell Papers]: ‘J’ai eu la plus grande\r\n  peine à faire arriver mon artillerie sur la rive droite de cette\r\n  rivière. Les ponts que j’avais fait construire sur l’Agueda\r\n  ayant été détruits par les grandes crues d’eau, et n’ayant pas\r\n  la faculté de les rétablir, je n’ai su d’autre moyen que de la\r\n  diriger par les sources de cette rivière, et les contreforts\r\n  des montagnes.’ The wording of Wellington’s intercepted copy\r\n  differs slightly from that of the duplicate printed in Ducasse’s\r\n  _Correspondence of King Joseph_, viii. pp. 404-10.\r\n\r\nFor the allies were closing in upon him--the head-quarters of\r\nWellington were on the 21st at Pedrogão, the 1st German Hussars,\r\ncovering the advance, had reached Sabugal, and the Light and 3rd\r\nDivisions were close behind, as were Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese,\r\nwhile the 4th and 5th were both beyond Castello Branco. On the morning\r\nof the 22nd the head of the infantry column had passed Sabugal, and the\r\nHussars were in front of them, pushing in Marmont’s vedettes. A delay\r\nof twenty-four hours more on the part of the French would have brought\r\nthe armies into collision, when Marmont gave orders for his infantry\r\nto retreat across the Agueda by the fords near Ciudad Rodrigo, where\r\nthe water on that day had at last fallen enough to render the passage\r\npossible, though difficult and dangerous. The leading division marched\r\non the 22nd, the rest on the 23rd: by the night of the latter day all\r\nwere across the river, and retiring rapidly on Salamanca; for, as\r\nMarmont truly observed, there was not a ration of food to be got out of\r\nthe devastated country between Rodrigo and the Tormes.\r\n\r\nThe odd part of this sudden, if long-deferred, retreat was that it\r\nwas made without the slightest knowledge that it was imperative,\r\nowing to Wellington’s near approach; in the letter announcing it\r\nto Berthier the Marshal reiterates his statement that he does not\r\nbelieve that Wellington has a man north of Castello Branco save the\r\n1st Hussars K.G.L. The retreat is only ordered because it is clear\r\nthat, with 20,000 men only in hand, it is useless to continue the\r\ntour of devastation in the Beira. ‘Your highness may judge that the\r\nresult of the diversion which I have sought to make in favour of the\r\nArmy of the South has been practically nil. Such a movement could only\r\nbe effective if carried out with a force great enough to enable me\r\nto march against the enemy with confidence, and to offer him battle,\r\neven if he had every available man collected. With 18,000 or 19,000\r\nmen (reduced to 15,000 or 16,000 because I have to leave detachments\r\nto keep up communications) I could not move far into Portugal without\r\nrisk, even if I have no one in front of me, and the whole hostile\r\narmy is on the farther bank of the Tagus. For if I passed the Zezere\r\nand marched on Santarem, the enemy--master of Badajoz and covered by\r\nthe Guadiana--could pass the Tagus behind me, and seize the defiles\r\nof Zarza Major, Perales, and Payo, by which alone I could return....\r\nThere are several places at which he could cross the Tagus, above and\r\nbelow Alcantara, and so place himself by a rapid and secret movement\r\nthat my first news of him would be by the sound of cannon on my line of\r\ncommunications--and my position would then be desperate[333].’\r\n\r\n  [333] Intercepted dispatch in the Scovell Papers, Fuente\r\n  Guinaldo, April 22, quoted above.\r\n\r\nThe real danger that was threatening him, on the day that he wrote this\r\ndispatch, Marmont did not suspect in the least, indeed he denied its\r\nexistence. But he moved just in time, and was across the Agueda when,\r\non the 24th, Wellington had his head-quarters at Alfayates, and three\r\ndivisions at Fuente Guinaldo, which the French had only evacuated on\r\nthe preceding day, with three more close behind. Only the 1st and 6th,\r\nunder Graham, were still at Castello Branco and Losa. Evidently if the\r\nfords of the Agueda had remained impassable for another twenty-four\r\nhours, Marmont’s four divisions would have been overwhelmed by superior\r\nnumbers and driven against the bridgeless river, over which there would\r\nhave been no escape. As it was, he avoided an unsuspected danger, and\r\nreturned to Salamanca with his army little reduced in numbers, but with\r\nhis cavalry and artillery almost ruined: his dispatch of the 22nd says\r\nthat he has lost 1,500 horses, and that as many more needed a long rest\r\nif they were ever again to be fit for service.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Wellington bade all his army halt, the forced marches\r\nwhich they had been carrying out for the last ten days having failed\r\nto achieve the end of surprising and overwhelming Marmont, who had\r\nobtained an undeserved escape. On the 26th he paid a flying visit to\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, whose safety he had at least secured, and commended\r\nGeneral Vives for his correct attitude during the three weeks of\r\nthe late blockade. The next movements of the allied army belong to\r\na different series of operations, and must be dealt with in a new\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE SALAMANCA CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nKING JOSEPH AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1812, the day on which Wellington opened his trenches\r\nbefore Badajoz, the Emperor Napoleon took a step of no small importance\r\nwith regard to the control of his armies in Spain. He had now made up\r\nhis mind that the long-threatened war with Russia must begin within a\r\nfew months, and that he must leave Paris ere long, and move forward\r\nto some central point in Germany, from which he could superintend the\r\npreparations for a campaign, the greatest in scale of any which he\r\nhad hitherto undertaken. He was persuaded that war was inevitable:\r\nthe Czar Alexander had dared to dispute his will; and in the state of\r\nmegalomania, to which his mind had now accustomed itself, he could\r\ntolerate no opposition. Yet he was aware, in his more lucid moments,\r\nthat he was taking a great risk. On March 7th Colonel Jardet, Marmont’s\r\nconfidential aide-de-camp, was granted an interview, in which he\r\nset forth all the difficulties of the Army of Portugal. The Emperor\r\nheard him out, and began, ‘Marmont complains that he is short of many\r\nresources--food, money, means, &c.... Well, here am I, about to plunge\r\nwith an immense army into the heart of a great country which produces\r\n_absolutely nothing_.’ And then he stopped, and after a long silence\r\nseemed suddenly to rouse himself from a sombre reverie, and looking\r\nthe colonel in the face asked, ‘How will it all end?’ Jardet, thrown\r\noff his balance by such a searching query, stammered that it would of\r\ncourse end in the best possible fashion. But he went out filled with\r\ngloomy forebodings, inspired by his master’s evident lack of confidence\r\nin the future[334].\r\n\r\n  [334] See Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. p. 202. Jardet’s long report\r\n  to Marmont was captured on its journey out to Salamanca from\r\n  Paris, and lies among the Scovell Papers.\r\n\r\nSome weeks were yet to elapse before the Emperor’s actual departure\r\nfrom France; but, ere he went, he had to set in good working order the\r\nconduct of his policy during his absence, and of all its complicated\r\nmachinery the Spanish section was one of the most puzzling and the\r\nmost apt to get out of order. It was clearly impossible that he should\r\ncontinue to send from Dresden or Wilna elaborate orders every five\r\nor ten days, as he had been wont to do from Paris. If it took three\r\nweeks to get an order to Seville in February, it might take five or\r\nsix in July, when the imperial head-quarters might be in some obscure\r\nLithuanian hamlet. Something must be done to solve the problem of\r\ncontinuous policy, and of co-operation between the five armies of\r\nSpain, and after much consideration the Emperor dictated to Berthier\r\nthe solution which he thought least bad--’Send by special messenger a\r\ndispatch to the King of Spain, informing him that I confide to him the\r\ncommand of all my Spanish armies, and that Marshal Jourdan will serve\r\nas his Chief-of-the-Staff. You will send, at the same time, a similar\r\nintimation to that marshal. You will inform the King that I shall keep\r\nhim advised of my political intentions through my ambassador at Madrid.\r\nYou will write to Marshal Suchet, to the Duke of Dalmatia, and the\r\nDuke of Ragusa that I have entrusted the King with the charge of all\r\nmy armies in his realm, and that they will have to conform to all the\r\norders which they may receive from the King, to secure the co-operation\r\nof their armies. You will write, in particular, to the Duke of Ragusa\r\nthat the necessity for obtaining common action between the Armies of\r\nthe South, of Valencia, and of Portugal, has determined me to give\r\nthe King of Spain control over all of them, and that he will have to\r\nregulate his operations by the instructions which he will receive.\r\nTo-morrow you will write in greater detail to the King, but the special\r\nmessenger must start this very night for Bayonne[335].’\r\n\r\n  [335] King Joseph had been prepared for the formal proposal by a\r\n  tentative letter sent off to him about three weeks earlier, on\r\n  February 19, inquiring whether it would suit him to have Jourdan\r\n  as his Chief-of-the-Staff, supposing that the Emperor went off to\r\n  Russia and turned over the command in Spain to him. See Ducasse’s\r\n  _Correspondence_, ix. p. 322.\r\n\r\nOf the bundle of dispatches that for the King was delivered at Madrid\r\non March 28th, after twelve days of travel. Marmont got his a little\r\nlater, as he had started on his Portuguese expedition when it reached\r\nSalamanca. Communication between his field-force and his base being\r\ndifficult, owing to the activity of Julian Sanchez, it appears to have\r\nbeen on March 30, when before Ciudad Rodrigo, that he became aware\r\nthat he had a new commander-in-chief[336]. Soult was apprised of the\r\nsituation much later, because, when preparing for his expedition to\r\nrelieve Badajoz, he had ordered his posts in the Sierra Morena to be\r\nevacuated, and the communication with La Mancha to be broken off for\r\nthe moment. It seems that he must have got Berthier’s dispatch quite\r\nlate in April, as on the 17th of that month he was only acknowledging\r\nParis letters of February 23rd[337], and the first courier from Madrid\r\ngot through only some time later. Suchet would appear also to have been\r\nadvised of the change of command very late--he published the imperial\r\ndecree in his official gazette at Valencia only on May 10, giving as\r\nits date the 29th instead of the 16th of March[338], which looks as\r\nif the first copy sent to him had miscarried, and the repetition made\r\nthirteen days later had alone reached him. These dates are only worth\r\ngiving as illustrations of the extreme difficulty of getting orders\r\nfrom point to point in Spain during the French occupation, even when\r\nAndalusia and Valencia were supposed to be thoroughly subdued.\r\n\r\n  [336] This is proved by Berthier’s letter to King Joseph of April\r\n  16 (Ducasse’s _Correspondence of King Joseph_, viii. p. 382),\r\n  which says that he has just received Marmont’s dispatch of March\r\n  30 acknowledging his own of March 16, and that the Marshal now\r\n  knows that he must obey orders from Madrid.\r\n\r\n  [337] Soult to Berthier from Seville, April 17.\r\n\r\n  [338] A copy of this print is among the Scovell Papers: it does\r\n  credit to the Valencian press by its neat appearance.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in Napoleon’s instructions to Berthier no mention\r\nis made of either the Army of Catalonia or the Army of the North[339];\r\nand it might have been thought that, clinging to the theory of his\r\npaper annexation of Spain north of the Ebro, he was deliberately\r\nexempting from the King’s control the troops in the districts on which\r\nhe had resolved to lay hands for his own benefit. But a supplementary\r\ndispatch of April 23rd placed Decaen and the garrison of Catalonia\r\nunder the general charge of Suchet, and as that marshal had been\r\ndirected to obey King Joseph’s military instructions, the four new\r\n‘French’ departments on the Ebro were now theoretically under the same\r\ngeneral command as the rest of Spain. As to the Army of the North,\r\nDorsenne wrote (April 19th), with evident glee, to say that he was\r\nexempted from obedience to the King, by not being included in the list\r\nof recipients of the dispatch of March 16, and that he regretted his\r\ninability to carry out a series of orders which Jourdan had sent him.\r\nBut he had not many more days to serve in his present capacity, and his\r\nsuccessor, Caffarelli, though equally recalcitrant in spirit, presently\r\nreceived a formal notice that he was under King Joseph’s command.\r\n\r\n  [339] The question about the Army of the North is a very curious\r\n  one. The authorized copy of the dispatch of May 16, printed in\r\n  Napoleon’s correspondence and in Ducasse’s _Correspondence of\r\n  King Joseph_, certainly omits its name. But the King declared\r\n  that in his original copy of it Dorsenne and his army were\r\n  mentioned as put under his charge. In one of the intercepted\r\n  dispatches in the Scovell Papers, Joseph writes angrily to\r\n  Berthier, giving what purports to be a verbatim duplicate of the\r\n  document, and in this duplicate, which lies before my eyes as I\r\n  write this, the Army of the North _is_ cited with the rest.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s general policy in placing the supreme control of all the\r\nSpanish armies in the hands of one chief, and bringing to an end (in\r\ntheory at least) the system of separate viceroyalties was undoubtedly\r\nthe right one. And it cannot be disputed that one second-rate\r\ncommander-in-chief is more effective than four good ones, working each\r\nfor his own private and local profit and glory. But in this particular\r\ncase the new arrangement was not likely to bring about any great change\r\nfor the better, owing to the personal equation. During the last three\r\nyears Napoleon had been inflicting affronts at short intervals upon his\r\nbrother, had annexed integral portions of his realm, had disregarded\r\nmost of his complaints and suggestions, and had allowed him to become\r\nthe butt of the viceroys, whose insults and injuries he had never\r\nbeen allowed to resent. They had raided the districts assigned to his\r\npersonal governance[340], had plundered his magazines, imprisoned his\r\nofficials, and set up courts of justice of their own to supersede the\r\nregular magistracy of the land. The Emperor had never punished such\r\nproceedings; at the most he had ordered that they should cease, when\r\nthey were injurious to the progress of the French arms in Spain. It\r\nwas useless to issue a sudden order that for the future the marshals\r\nwere under Joseph’s control, and that ‘he must make them obey him,’\r\nas the phrase ran in one letter to Madrid. As the King’s minister,\r\nMiot de Melito, wrote, ‘What chance was there of success when all\r\nthe individuals concerned were at variance with each other? The\r\nmarshals had been accustomed for three years to absolute independence.\r\nThe new Chief-of-the-Staff, in spite of his acknowledged capacity,\r\nwas known to be out of favour with the Emperor, and in consequence\r\ncould exercise no moral authority over the masters of the armies.\r\nThe apparent testimonial of confidence which was given to the King,\r\nby making him Commander-in-Chief, was a matter to cause disquietude\r\nrather than satisfaction[341].’ The plain fact was that Napoleon was\r\nover-busy, worried with other problems, and he merely took the easiest\r\nand simplest method of throwing the burden of the Spanish war on to the\r\nshoulders of another. The consequences, be they what they might be,\r\nwere now of little importance, compared with the success or failure of\r\nthe impending Russian campaign.\r\n\r\n  [340] One of Marmont’s colonels in the province of Segovia was\r\n  at this moment threatening to use armed force against the King’s\r\n  troops for resisting his requisitions. See Miot, iii. p. 222.\r\n\r\n  [341] See Miot de Melito’s _Mémoires_, iii. p. 215.\r\n\r\nJourdan sums up the situation in much the same terms. ‘The King\r\nfor two years had been allowed to have no direct relations with\r\nthe generals-in-chief: he had no exact knowledge of the military\r\nsituation in each of their spheres of command, nor was he better\r\ninformed as to the strength, organization, and distribution of the\r\ntroops under their orders. Unable to use his new authority till he had\r\ngot together detailed statements as to these data, he directed his\r\nchief-of-the-staff to ask for reports. Dorsenne replied that he should\r\nnot send any at present, because Berthier, when announcing to him that\r\nthe Armies of the South, of Portugal, and of Aragon had been put under\r\nthe King’s orders, had informed him that the Emperor would let him know\r\nin due course what was to be done with the Army of the North. Marshal\r\nSuchet demonstrated that he had received special instructions from the\r\nEmperor, which presently were seen to make the King’s authority over\r\nthe Army of Aragon quite illusory. Soult had removed all the posts\r\non the lines of communication when he marched to relieve Badajoz, and\r\nshowed so little zeal in reopening them, that even in May it was not\r\nknown at Madrid whether he was yet aware that he was under the King’s\r\norders. Marmont was the only one who sent without delay the report\r\nwhich had been asked for--but he announced at the same time that, in\r\nobedience to the Emperor’s earlier orders, he was already operating\r\nbeyond the Agueda, to make a diversion for the relief of Badajoz[342].’\r\n\r\n  [342] Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 384.\r\n\r\nOf what use was it to send orders to the marshals, when they\r\ncould plead that the execution of them was rendered impossible by\r\ninstructions received directly from the Emperor, which prescribed a\r\ndifferent policy? Unfortunately for King Joseph each commander-in-chief\r\nstill preserved his direct communication with the Minister of War at\r\nParis: even after the Emperor had started for Poland in May, each\r\ncontinued to send in his own plans, and to demonstrate how far superior\r\nthey were to those prescribed by King Joseph. Soult, in particular,\r\ngenerally commenced a dispatch by demonstrating that the directions\r\nreceived from Madrid could not possibly be executed, and then produced\r\nan elaborate scheme of his own, which would be beneficial for the Army\r\nof Andalusia, but impracticable for those of Portugal, Valencia, and\r\nthe Centre. When his suggestions were rejected, he wrote privately to\r\nParis, declaring that Joseph and Jourdan were absolutely incapable,\r\nand sometimes adding that the King was trying to serve his private\r\ninterests rather than those of his brother and suzerain. It was the\r\naccidental receipt by Joseph of an intercepted letter of Soult’s to the\r\nMinister of War, in which he was accused of absolute treason to the\r\nEmperor, that brought about the final rupture between the King and the\r\nMarshal, and led to the recall of the latter to France[343].\r\n\r\n  [343] Oddly enough this letter was in duplicate, and while\r\n  one copy fell into Joseph’s hands, the other was captured by\r\n  guerrilleros and sent to Wellington. The cipher was worked out\r\n  by Scovell, and the contents gave Wellington useful information\r\n  as to the relations between Soult and the King. See below, pages\r\n  530-39.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph, though liable to fits of depression and despair, was, on\r\nthe whole, of a mercurial and self-sufficient temperament. A few weeks\r\nbefore the receipt of the Emperor’s dispatch granting him the command\r\nof the Spanish armies, all his letters had been full of complaints and\r\nthreats of abdication. But the decree of March 16th filled him with a\r\nsudden confidence--at last his military talents should be displayed and\r\nrecognized; he would, as his brother desired, ‘make the marshals obey\r\nhim;’ for the future the armies should all act together for a single\r\nend, and not be guided by the selfish interests of their leaders. He\r\naccepted the position of Commander-in-Chief with undisguised pleasure,\r\nand proceeded to draw out schemes of his own, with Jourdan as his\r\nadviser in technical matters of military logistics.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the ‘_Mémoire_ of May 1812[344],’ in which\r\nJourdan set forth the situation after the fall of Badajoz, and\r\nthe policy which he considered that it demanded, is a document of\r\nmuch greater merit than might have been expected. It is by far the\r\nbest summary of the position of the French power in Spain that was\r\never drawn up, and it recognizes with great clearness the two main\r\nlimitations of that power, which were (1) that the imperial troops\r\nwere an army of occupation rather than a genuine field army, and (2)\r\nthat the Napoleonic system, by which hosts were supposed to ‘live\r\non the countryside,’ might be applicable for a short campaign in\r\nLombardy or Bavaria, but was impossible for protracted manœuvres in an\r\nexhausted and thinly-peopled land like central Spain. Jourdan’s note\r\non the _Mémoire_ sums up the situation in a few lines--’Two measures\r\nwere indispensable: one was to render the army mobile, by giving it\r\nample transport, and by establishing large magazines on all lines of\r\ncommunication: without these all permanent concentration of heavy\r\nforces, and all continuous operations were impossible. The second was\r\nto abandon the deplorable system of occupying as much territory as\r\npossible--of which the real object was double: firstly, to enable the\r\narmies to live on the country-side; secondly, to appear in the eyes of\r\nEurope to be dominant over the whole of Spain.’\r\n\r\n  [344] Printed whole in Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, pp. 386-94.\r\n\r\nThe _Mémoire_ itself is worth analysing. Its gist runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘(1) The recent departure of the Imperial Guards, the Poles, and other\r\ntroops, and the lack of any adequate system of transport or magazines,\r\nrenders the Imperial Army--though still 230,000 men strong--incapable\r\nof undertaking any offensive operations. The present situation is\r\nexceptionally trying, because of the successes of Wellington, and the\r\ndeplorable effect on Spanish public opinion of the recent annexation\r\n[Catalonia], the arbitrary government of the generals, and the famine\r\nwhich has lately prevailed. The discontent thereby engendered has led\r\nto the enormous increase in the number of the guerrillero bands. It has\r\nalso encouraged the government at Cadiz to multiply its levies and its\r\nmilitary energy.\r\n\r\n(2) It is not yet certain whether the Emperor intends the Army of the\r\nNorth to be at the King’s disposal. General Dorsenne refuses to send in\r\nreports or to accept orders. But since its recent reduction in numbers\r\n[by the departure of the Imperial Guard, and the transfer of Souham’s\r\nand Bonnet’s divisions to the Army of Portugal] it is believed that\r\nit has not more than 48,000 men under arms, and it appears to be a\r\nfact that it can do no more than hold down the wide regions committed\r\nto its charge, and guard the line of communications with France. Even\r\nif placed at the King’s disposition, it can furnish no important\r\nreinforcements to other armies. Nevertheless it should be put under his\r\ncontrol, as it might under certain circumstances be called upon to lend\r\na moderate force for a short time.\r\n\r\n(3) As to the Army of Aragon [60,000 men, including the divisions in\r\nCatalonia]: the King was informed that Marshal Suchet was placed under\r\nhis command, and that if he needed reinforcements he might draw on the\r\ntroops in Valencia. He therefore [during the siege of Badajoz] ordered\r\nthe Marshal to send a division to join the Army of the Centre for an\r\nindispensable operation[345]. The Marshal sent a formal declaration in\r\nreply, to the effect that he could not execute this order, and that\r\nhe was even about to withdraw from Cuenca the regiment that he had\r\nplaced there, as its absence imperilled the safety of Valencia. He\r\nsays that the Emperor has placed Catalonia under his charge, and that\r\nhe is authorized to employ his whole force for the protection of the\r\nprovinces entrusted to him. Apparently, then, the Army of Aragon cannot\r\nco-operate in operations outside its own sphere, and the Marshal’s\r\nspecial instructions place him in an exceptional position. His\r\nrelations with the King consist in a polite exchange of views, not in\r\nthe giving and taking of orders--his Majesty’s control over this army\r\nis purely illusory.\r\n\r\n  [345] i. e. for the collection of troops in the valley of the\r\n  Tagus, to join Foy and operate for the relief of Badajoz.\r\n\r\n(4) As to the Army of the South, Marshal Soult has about 54,000 men\r\neffective [not including _Juramentados_, &c.]. The Cadiz Lines and the\r\ngarrisons pin down a large force to fixed stations. The Marshal has\r\nalso to keep a considerable flying column in hand, to hunt Ballasteros\r\nand other partisans. For operations outside the bounds of Andalusia he\r\ncan only collect a field-force of 24,000 men; this is the total figure\r\nof the corps that tried to relieve Badajoz, and in its absence Seville\r\nwas nearly lost. The posts in the Sierra Morena were called in at that\r\ntime, and have never come back: correspondence with the Army of the\r\nSouth is therefore precarious and slow.\r\n\r\n(5) The Army of Portugal has 52,000 men effective. It holds the front\r\nline against Wellington; its divisions are much scattered, because it\r\nhas to live on the country, and has also to furnish several important\r\ngarrisons. One division of 6,000 men is fixed down in the Asturias by\r\nthe Emperor’s special orders. The garrisons of Astorga, Valladolid,\r\nSalamanca, Leon, Palencia, &c., absorb 6,000 or 7,000 men more. Only\r\n29,000 infantry [or a total of 35,000 of all arms] are available\r\nas a field-force to use against the English, if they attack on the\r\nfront of the Tormes. If Marshal Marmont has to march out of his own\r\nsphere, to join in a combined operation against Wellington [e. g. in\r\nEstremadura], he can bring a still smaller force--say 25,000 men.\r\nThe Army of Portugal is many months in arrear of its pay, and has\r\nhardly any transport or magazines: the troops have become terrible\r\nmarauders--largely from necessity.\r\n\r\n(6) Lastly we come to the Army of the Centre. It consists of 9,500 men\r\nborne on the Imperial muster-rolls, and 5,800 troops belonging to the\r\nKing [his Guards and Hugo’s _Juramentados_, horse and foot]. There\r\nare also at present in Madrid 3,200 drafts for the Army of the South,\r\ntemporarily retained--so that the whole makes up 18,500 men. But only\r\n15,000 are effective, the remainder consisting of dépôts, dismounted\r\ncavalry, train, &c. Having to hold down the extensive provinces of\r\nMadrid, Segovia, Guadalajara, Toledo, La Mancha, and Cuenca, this\r\nforce is a mere “army of occupation.” It can provide no troops for\r\nexpeditions outside its own territory, and is spread so thin that even\r\nMadrid would be in danger without the Royal Guards. The pay is eight\r\nmonths in arrear.\r\n\r\n(7) Civil administration is still localized: the commanders of the\r\narmies levy their own taxes, and nothing comes to Madrid. The King has\r\nto feed the Army of the Centre, and to maintain his civil service,\r\nfrom the revenues of New Castile alone. None of the marshals will help\r\nanother with money or stores. The claim of the King to rule all Spain\r\nseems absurd to the people, so long as he cannot exercise any civil\r\ncontrol outside the _arrondissement_ of the Army of the Centre.\r\n\r\n(8) Conclusion. All offensive operations are impossible, as long as\r\nthe imperial armies have to hold down the entirety of the occupied\r\nprovinces. If Lord Wellington concentrates all his forces, he can march\r\nwith 60,000 men [not including Spaniards] against either the Army of\r\nPortugal or the Army of the South. Neither of them can assemble a\r\nsufficient force to resist him, unless they abandon whole provinces.\r\nThe King has ordered Soult and Marmont to march to each other’s aid if\r\neither is attacked. But they have to unite, coming from remote bases,\r\nwhile the enemy can place himself between them and strike at one or the\r\nother. The lines of communication between them are long and circuitous.\r\nIt is easily conceivable that one of them may be attacked and beaten\r\nbefore the other is even aware of the danger. A catastrophe is quite\r\npossible if Lord Wellington should throw himself suddenly, with his\r\nwhole force, upon either the Army of Portugal or that of the South.\r\n\r\nThe only possible way of dealing with this danger is to collect\r\na central reserve of 20,000 men at Madrid, which can be promptly\r\ntransferred to right or left, to join either Soult or Marmont as\r\nthe conditions of the moment dictate. The Army of the Centre cannot\r\nserve this purpose--it is not a field-force, but an immovable army of\r\noccupation. If the Emperor could send a new corps of this size from\r\nFrance, Marmont could be reinforced up to a strength sufficient to\r\nenable him to face Wellington, and to besiege Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n\r\nBut the present posture of European affairs [the Russian war]\r\nprobably makes it impossible to draw such a corps from France. This\r\nbeing so, the central reserve must be obtained from troops already\r\nexisting in the Peninsula. The only way to find them is for the Emperor\r\nto consent to the evacuation of Andalusia. Thirty thousand men of the\r\nArmy of the South can then be placed to cover Madrid, in La Mancha:\r\nthis force would be ample against any Spanish levies that might come\r\nup to the Sierra Morena from Cadiz and elsewhere. The remainder of\r\nthe Army of the South must form the central reserve, and prepare to\r\nreinforce Marmont. The Army of Portugal would then be so strong that\r\nWellington could not dare to take the offensive--he would be hopelessly\r\noutnumbered. If this scheme is approved by the Emperor, he may be\r\ncertain that, when he comes back from Poland, his Spanish armies will\r\nbe in the same secure defensive position in which he leaves them now.\r\nThe right wing rests on the Bay of Biscay in the Asturias: the left on\r\nthe Mediterranean in Valencia.\r\n\r\nWhen Andalusia is evacuated, the remaining provinces in French\r\noccupation will not be able to pay or feed the 54,000 men of the Army\r\nof the South, in addition to the armies already stationed in them; a\r\nliberal subsidy from Paris will be necessary. In addition the King\r\nmust, for the sake of his prestige, be given real civil authority over\r\nall the provinces.\r\n\r\nIt will only be when all authority, civil, military, and\r\nadministrative, is concentrated in one hand, that of the King, and when\r\nHis Majesty shall have received from the Emperor instructions suiting\r\nthe present posture of affairs, that he can be fully responsible for\r\nSpain.’\r\n\r\nOn the whole this is a very well-reasoned document. It was perfectly\r\ntrue that the offensive power of the French in the Peninsula had shrunk\r\nto nothing, because no province could be held down without a large\r\ngarrison. If left unoccupied, it would burst into revolt and raise an\r\narmy. This was the inevitable nemesis for a war of annexation directed\r\nagainst a proud and patriotic people. There were 230,000 French\r\ntroops in Spain; but so many of them were tied down to occupation\r\nduty, that only about 50,000 or 60,000 could be collected to curb\r\nWellington, unless some large province were evacuated. Either Andalusia\r\nor else Valencia must be abandoned. The former was the larger and the\r\nmore wealthy; but it was more remote from the strategical centre of\r\noperations in Madrid, much more infested by the bands of the patriots,\r\nand it lay close to the sphere of operations of Wellington--the great\r\ndisturbing element in French calculations. Moreover its evacuation\r\nwould set free a much larger field army. Against this was to be set\r\nthe adverse balance in loss of prestige: as long as Cadiz appeared to\r\nbe beleaguered, the national government of Spain looked like a handful\r\nof refugees in a forlorn island. To abandon the immense lines in front\r\nof it, with their dependent flotilla (which must be burnt, since it\r\ncould not be removed), would be a conclusive proof to all Europe that\r\nthe main frontal offensive against the Spanish patriots had failed.\r\nSeville and Granada, great towns of world-wide fame, would also have to\r\nbe abandoned. Andalusia was full of _Afrancesados_, who must either be\r\nshepherded to Madrid, or left to the vengeance of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut to weigh prestige against solid military advantage, though it might\r\nappeal to Napoleon--whose reputation as universal conqueror was part\r\nof his political stock-in-trade--did not occur to the common-sense\r\nintellect of Jourdan. He voted for the evacuation of Andalusia: so did\r\nhis friend and master, King Joseph. Possibly their decision was not\r\nrendered more unwelcome by the fact that it would certainly be most\r\ndistasteful to Soult, whom they both cordially detested. The Viceroy\r\nshould pay at last for the selfish policy of the General: his realm,\r\nfor the last two years, had been administered with much profit and\r\nglory to himself, but with little advantage to the King at Madrid, or\r\nthe general prosperity of the French cause in Spain. Whether personal\r\nmotives entered into the decision of Joseph and Jourdan we need not\r\ntrouble to consider: it was certainly the correct one to take.\r\n\r\nPermission to evacuate Andalusia was therefore demanded from the\r\nEmperor: King Joseph did not dare to authorize it on his own\r\nresponsibility. Meanwhile, long before the _Mémoire_ of May 1812 had\r\nbeen completed or sent off, to Napoleon, he issued the orders which\r\nhe thought himself justified in giving in the interim, to act as a\r\nstop-gap till the permission should be granted. Marmont was told to\r\nfall back on his own old policy of keeping a large detachment in the\r\nTagus valley, in order that he might get into touch with Drouet and\r\nSoult’s Estremaduran corps of observation. He was directed to send\r\ntwo divisions of infantry and a brigade of light cavalry to join Foy,\r\nwho was still in the direction of Almaraz and Talavera. They were to\r\nbe ready to act as the advance of the Army of Portugal for a march on\r\nTruxillo and Merida, if Wellington’s next move should turn out to be\r\nan attack on Soult in Andalusia. In a corresponding fashion, Soult was\r\nordered to reinforce Drouet up to a force of 20,000 men, and to push\r\nhim forward to his old position about Almendralejo, Zalamea, Merida,\r\nand Medellin, in order that he might march via Truxillo to join the\r\nArmy of Portugal, in case the Anglo-Portuguese army should choose\r\nSalamanca, not Seville, as its next objective. The small part of the\r\nArmy of the Centre that could be formed into a field-force--three\r\nbattalions and two cavalry regiments, under General d’Armagnac--was\r\ndirected to move to Talavera, to relieve Foy there if he should be\r\ncalled to move either north to join Marmont on the Tormes, or south\r\nto join Soult on the Guadiana[346]. To replace these troops, drawn\r\nfrom the provinces of Cuenca and La Mancha, Joseph--as we have already\r\nseen[347]--requested Suchet to send ‘a good division’ from Valencia by\r\nCuenca, on to Ocaña in La Mancha[348]. In this way the King and Jourdan\r\nthought they would provide for active co-operation between the Armies\r\nof Portugal and Andalusia, whether Wellington should make his next move\r\nto the South or the North.\r\n\r\n  [346] See Jourdan to Berthier of April 3, 1812.\r\n\r\n  [347] See Jourdan’s _Mémoire_, quoted above, p. 304.\r\n\r\n  [348] Jourdan to Suchet, April 9, 1812.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, but perhaps not surprising, to find that these orders,\r\nthe first-fruits of Joseph’s new commission as Commander-in-Chief, were\r\nobeyed neither by Suchet, by Soult, nor by Marmont.\r\n\r\nThe former, as we have already seen, when analysing Jourdan’s _Mémoire_\r\nof May 1812, not only refused to send a division to Ocaña, but stated\r\nthat he should be obliged to withdraw the regiment that he was keeping\r\nat Cuenca, because he was authorized by the Emperor to reserve all his\r\nown troops for the defence of his own sphere of action, in Valencia,\r\nAragon, and Catalonia. Soult declared that it was impossible for him\r\nto reinforce Drouet--‘he could not keep 20,000 men on the Guadiana\r\nunless he received large reinforcements: all that he could promise\r\nwas that the force in Estremadura should move up again to Medellin\r\nand Villafranca, possibly even to Merida, if Wellington had really\r\ngone northward with his main army. Drouet, with his 10,000 or 12,000\r\nmen, might serve to “contain” Hill and the British detachment in\r\nEstremadura, and his position would prevent the enemy from making any\r\nimportant movement in the valley of the Tagus. Meanwhile he himself\r\nmust, as an absolute necessity, lay siege to Tarifa for the second\r\ntime, and make an end of Ballasteros: no more troops, therefore, could\r\nbe sent to Drouet: but when Tarifa and Ballasteros had been finished\r\noff, the siege of Cadiz should be pressed with vigour.’ This reply\r\nis not only a blank refusal to obey the King’s orders, but amounts\r\nto a definite statement that the local affairs of Andalusia are more\r\nimportant than the general co-operation of the French armies in Spain.\r\nAs we shall presently see, Soult was ready to formulate this startling\r\nthesis in the plainest terms--he was, ere long, to propose that the\r\nKing and the Army of the Centre should evacuate Madrid and retire upon\r\nAndalusia, when things went wrong with the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\nAs to Marmont, his reply to King Joseph’s dispatch was couched in\r\nterms of less open disobedience, but it was by no means satisfactory.\r\nHe wrote from Salamanca, on April 29th, after his return from the\r\nraid to Sabugal and Guarda, that he had now learnt (what he did not\r\nknow ten days before), that Wellington had been pursuing him with\r\nfive divisions. This force was still in the Beira, and the British\r\ngeneral himself had been at Ciudad Rodrigo on the 26th. It was,\r\ntherefore, quite clear that Soult had not ‘the whole English army on\r\nhis shoulders.’ This being so, it was not necessary to send into the\r\nvalley of the Tagus such a large force as was asked. But one division\r\nshould move to Avila at once, and could drop down on to Talavera\r\nin two days, if it turned out to be necessary. Two more should be\r\ncantoned about Arevalo and the Pass of Piedrahita [20 miles north-west\r\nof Avila] respectively, points from which they could be transferred\r\nto the valley of the Tagus in a few days. Marmont then proceeded to\r\nwarn Jourdan against any scheme for concentrating any considerable\r\nforce in the direction of La Mancha, urging that he must be able to\r\ncollect as many of his divisions opposite Wellington as possible, in\r\ncase of an advance by the Anglo-Portuguese army towards the Tormes. All\r\nthat was necessary on the Tagus was to have the forts at Almaraz well\r\ngarrisoned and provided with stores, so that troops dropping down from\r\nAvila on a southward march should find a base and magazines ready for\r\nthem. Summing up, he ends with a dictum that ‘if we defend Andalusia\r\nby sacrificing the Army of Portugal, we may save that province for\r\nthe moment, but the North will be in danger: if a disaster occurs\r\nthere, Andalusia will soon be lost also. If, on the contrary, we make\r\nits defence in the North, the South may be lost, but the North still\r\nremains secure.’ By these somewhat cryptic words, Marmont seems to mean\r\nthat, looking at the affairs of Spain at large, Andalusia may be lost\r\nwithout any shock to the imperial domination in Leon and Old Castile.\r\nBut a disaster in Leon or Old Castile entails inevitably the loss of\r\nAndalusia also. This was true enough, though Soult refused to see it.\r\n\r\nBut the result of Marmont’s very partial fulfilment of Joseph’s\r\norders, and of Soult’s and Suchet’s entire neglect of them, was that\r\nJourdan’s main design of providing for close and speedy co-operation\r\nbetween the Armies of Portugal and Andalusia was completely foiled.\r\nWhen, on May 17th-19th, Hill made his celebrated irruption into the\r\nvalley of the Tagus, with the object of destroying the bridge and\r\nforts of Almaraz, the point where the interests of Soult and Marmont\r\nwere linked together, he found no French troops within fifty miles\r\nof his objective, save the single division of Foy and D’Armagnac’s\r\n3,000 men from the Army of the Centre. Marmont’s nearest division in\r\nsupport was at Avila, Soult’s in the Sierra Morena; both lay so far\r\noff from Almaraz that Hill could not only deliver his blow, but could\r\ndepart at leisure when it was struck, without any risk of being beset\r\nby superior forces. If King Joseph’s orders of April had been carried\r\nout, Wellington’s stroke in May would have been impossible--or risky\r\nto the verge of rashness. Indeed we may be certain, on Wellington’s\r\nrecord, that he would not have made it, if three French divisions,\r\ninstead of one, had been about Talavera and Almaraz. We may add that\r\nhis self-reliance during the Salamanca campaign rested largely on the\r\nfact that Soult could not succour Marmont, within any reasonable space\r\nof time, even if he wished to do so, because the bridge of Almaraz was\r\nbroken. Wherefore Jourdan and King Joseph must be pronounced to have\r\nbeen wise in their foresight, and the Dukes of Ragusa and Dalmatia\r\nhighly blameworthy for their disregard of the orders given them. They\r\nlooked each to their own local interests, not to the general strategic\r\nnecessities of the French position in Spain, which the King and his\r\nChief-of-the-Staff were keeping in mind.\r\n\r\nSo far their precautions were wise: to blame them for not taking the\r\ntremendous step of evacuating Andalusia without the Emperor’s leave,\r\nand concentrating such a force in central Spain as would have paralysed\r\nWellington’s offensive, would be unjust. They dared not have given such\r\nan order--and if they had, Soult would have disobeyed it.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself, indeed, would have agreed with Soult at this time.\r\nFor not long after Jourdan’s _Mémoire_ of May 1812, with its request\r\nfor leave to abandon Andalusia, had started on its journey for Dresden,\r\nthere arrived at Madrid a dispatch from Berthier, setting forth the\r\nfinal instructions left by the Emperor before he started from Paris\r\non May 9th. It was of a nature to strike dismay into the heart of the\r\nlevel-headed and rather despondent Jourdan; for it ignored all the\r\ndifficulties which his recently dispatched appeal set forth with such\r\nclearness. The King was directed to keep a grip on all the conquered\r\nprovinces of Spain, and to extend their limits till the enemy should\r\nbe extirpated. The conquest of Portugal might be postponed till ‘les\r\névénements détermineraient absolument cette mesure.’ The region to\r\nwhich the Emperor devoted most attention was the sphere of the Army of\r\nthe North. ‘This is the part on which it is indispensable to keep a\r\nfirm hold, never to allow the enemy to establish himself there, or to\r\nthreaten the line of communications. Wherefore a most active war must\r\nbe waged upon the “Brigands” [Mina, Porlier, Longa, &c.]: it is of\r\nno use to hunt and scatter them, leaving them power to reunite and to\r\nrenew their incursions. As to the English, the present situation seems\r\nrather to require a defensive posture: but it is necessary to maintain\r\nan imposing attitude in face of them, so that they may not take any\r\nadvantage of our position. The strength of the forces at the King’s\r\ndisposition enables him to do, in this respect, all that circumstances\r\nmay demand. Such are the principal ideas which the Emperor, before\r\ndeparting, has expressed on the Spanish problem.’\r\n\r\nThis was a heart-breaking document. Just when the King and Jourdan had\r\ndemonstrated that they had no available field army left to hold back\r\nWellington, they were informed that their forces were ample for the\r\npurpose. When they had asked leave to evacuate Andalusia they are told\r\nto ‘conserver les conquêtes et les étendre successivement.’ They had\r\nbeen wishing to concentrate at all costs a central reserve--now they\r\nwere directed to spread the already scattered army of occupation over\r\na still greater surface--presumably the Emperor’s phrase meant that he\r\nwished to see Murcia, the Catalonian inland, the whole of the Asturias,\r\nand the Condado de Niebla garrisoned, in addition to all that was held\r\nalready. The one central problem to Joseph and Jourdan was how to face\r\nWellington’s expected onslaught by making the armies co-operate--the\r\nEmperor forbids concentration, and recommends ‘the assumption of an\r\nimposing attitude!’ As if Wellington, whose knowledge of the movements\r\nand plans of his adversaries was beginning to appear almost uncanny to\r\nthem, was to be contained by ‘attitudes,’ imposing or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Commander-in-Chief and Chief-of-the-Staff of the united\r\narmies of Spain were reduced to a sort of apathetic despair by the\r\nEmperor’s memorandum. Jourdan, in his _Mémoires_, appears to shrug the\r\nshoulders of resignation in commenting on its effect. ‘If only instead\r\nof “hold all you have, and conquer the rest bit by bit,” we had been\r\ntold that we might evacuate some provinces and concentrate the troops,\r\nthere would have been much good in the instructions. The King might\r\nhave dared to abandon the South in order to keep down the North, if he\r\nhad not received this dispatch. But he could not take that portentous\r\nstep without the imperial permission. All that he could now do, was to\r\nreiterate his directions to Soult and Marmont that they must so place\r\ntheir troops as to be able to succour each other. We shall see how they\r\nobeyed those orders[349].’\r\n\r\n  [349] Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, pp. 395-6.\r\n\r\nSo, by the special and deliberate directions of the Emperor, the\r\n230,000 effective men ‘present under arms,’ forming the five imperial\r\narmies of Spain, were placed at the mercy of Lord Wellington and his\r\nmodest force of eight divisions of Anglo-Portuguese. In a flight of\r\nangry rhetoric, Berthier, writing under Napoleon’s dictation, had once\r\nasked whether it was reasonable ‘_que quarante mille Anglais gâtent\r\ntoutes les affaires d’Espagne_.’ The reply of the fates was to be that\r\nsuch a contingency was perfectly possible, under the system which the\r\nEmperor had instituted, and with the directions which he persisted in\r\ngiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDGE OF ALMARAZ. MAY 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 24th Wellington halted his pursuing army at Fuente Guinaldo\r\nand Sabugal, on hearing that Marmont had escaped him by a margin of\r\ntwenty-four hours. The French were in full march for Salamanca, and it\r\nwas impossible to pursue them any further, firstly because the allied\r\narmy needed a few days of rest after the forced march from Badajoz, and\r\nsecondly because its train had dropped behind, food was nearly out, and\r\nconvoys had to be brought up from Lamego and São João de Pesqueira.\r\nThere was, of course, nothing to be got out of the unhappy region in\r\nwhich Marmont’s locusts had just been spread abroad. The only fortunate\r\nthing was that the Duke of Ragusa had turned his raid against the Beira\r\nBaixa, and left the great dépôts on the Douro unmolested. From them\r\nample sustenance could be got up, in a week, to the positions behind\r\nthe Agueda and Coa where the army had halted.\r\n\r\nWellington, as it will be remembered, had contemplated an attack on\r\nAndalusia after Badajoz fell. But the necessity for seeing to the\r\nrelief and revictualling of Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo had brought\r\nhim up to the frontiers of Leon with the main body of his host. In\r\nthe position where he now lay, he was well placed for an advance\r\non Salamanca, and an attack on the Army of Portugal. To return to\r\nEstremadura would involve a long and weary countermarch. Moreover\r\nthere was no doubt that operations in Leon would be more decisive\r\nthan operations in Andalusia. As Marmont was to write to Berthier a\r\nfew days later, a victory of the allies in the North would involve\r\nthe evacuation of the South by Soult, while a victory in Andalusia\r\nwould leave the French power in the valleys of the Douro and Tagus\r\nunshaken[350]. Advancing from the line of the Agueda against Salamanca\r\nand Valladolid, Wellington would have his base and his main line of\r\ncommunications in his direct rear, safe against any flank attack. A\r\nraid against Andalusia, even if successful, would separate him from\r\nLisbon, and compel him to take up a new base at Cadiz--a doubtful\r\nexpedient. But what seems, in the end, to have been the main cause for\r\nWellington’s choosing Leon rather than Andalusia as his next sphere of\r\noperations, was that Marmont (as he judged) had the larger available\r\narmy for field movements outside his own ground. Soult was more pinned\r\ndown to his viceroyalty by local needs: he would not raise the siege of\r\nCadiz or evacuate Granada and Cordova. Therefore he could not collect\r\n(as his movement at the time of the fall of Badajoz had shown) more\r\nthan 24,000 men for an offensive operation. This was the absolute limit\r\nof his power to aid Marmont. But the latter, if he chose to evacuate\r\nAsturias and other outlying regions, could bring a much larger force to\r\nhelp Soult. Therefore an attack on Andalusia would enable the enemy to\r\nconcentrate a more numerous defensive force than an attack on Leon. ‘Of\r\nthe two armies opposed to us that of Portugal can produce the larger\r\nnumber of men for a distant operation. Marmont has nothing to attend to\r\nbut the British army, as he has been repeatedly told in [intercepted]\r\ntime he may lose some plunder and contributions, but he loses nothing\r\nthat can permanently affect his situation, or which he could not\r\nregain as soon as he has a superiority, particularly of cavalry, in\r\nthe open plains of Castille. Marmont’s, then, being what may be called\r\nof the two the _operating_ army, the movement which I might make into\r\nAndalusia would enable the enemy to bring the largest body of men to\r\nact together on one point. It would be a false movement, and this must\r\nby all means be avoided[351].’\r\n\r\n  [350] See above, p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [351] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 173.\r\n\r\nThis decision was not made immediately on Marmont’s retreat of April\r\n24th: for some days after the British headquarters settled down at\r\nFuente Guinaldo, Wellington had not quite made up his mind between the\r\ntwo operations: his letters to Lord Liverpool, to Hill, and Graham,\r\nare full of the needs of the moment, and do not lay down any general\r\nstrategical plan. The staff, in their discussions with each other,\r\ncanvassed the situation. ‘While Marmont remains in Old Castile he\r\n[Wellington] must leave a certain force near the frontier of the Beira.\r\nBut leaving the 3rd, 4th, 5th Divisions, and Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese (perhaps 18,000 men) for that purpose, he can move upon\r\nAndalusia, if he wishes, with the 1st, 6th, 7th, and Light Divisions,\r\nafterwards picking up Power’s Portuguese brigade and all General Hill’s\r\n_corps d’armée_--perhaps 36,000 infantry. This would do.’ So wrote\r\nD’Urban the chief of the Portuguese staff in his private diary, on\r\nMay 5, evidently after discussion with Beresford, and others of those\r\nwho were nearest the centre of decision. Wellington, however, was\r\npondering over alternatives: he could not move for a week or two at the\r\nbest, for he had to replenish his stores at the front, and to see that\r\nthe repairs and revictualling of Almeida and Rodrigo were completed,\r\nbefore he could start on any offensive movement. In that time, too,\r\nhe would be able to learn how Marmont was disposing of his army, and\r\nwhether Soult was showing any tendency to reinforce Drouet’s force in\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\nIt seems that an insight into his enemies’ purposes was made specially\r\neasy for Wellington at this moment by the successive capture of a\r\ngreat deal of French correspondence. When Marmont was in Portugal,\r\nbetween the 1st and 23rd of April, three of the duplicates of his\r\ndispatches were captured, one by Portuguese Ordenança, the others by\r\nJulian Sanchez between Rodrigo and Salamanca[352]. They were all in\r\ncipher, but the ingenuity of Captain Scovell, the cipher-secretary at\r\nhead-quarters, was capable of dealing with them, and from them could\r\nbe made out a great deal about the strength of the Marshal’s army, and\r\nhis general views on the campaign. If they had been taken and sent in\r\na little earlier, they might have enabled Wellington to complete that\r\nsurprise and dispersion of the French expeditionary force which had\r\nbeen in his mind.\r\n\r\n  [352] The cipher-originals are all in the Scovell papers,\r\n  worked out into their interpretation by that ingenious officer:\r\n  Wellington only kept the fair copies for himself. The dispatches\r\n  are dated Sabugal, 11 April (to Brennier about the Agueda\r\n  bridge); Sabugal, April 16 (to Berthier); Fuente Guinaldo, April\r\n  22 (to Berthier). The last two are full of the most acrimonious\r\n  criticism of Napoleon’s orders for the invasion of Beira. Scovell\r\n  made out much, but not all, of the contents of these letters.\r\n\r\nBut though they arrived too late for this purpose, they were valuable,\r\nas showing Marmont’s dislike of the imperial orders that he had been\r\nsent to carry out, and his preference for his own schemes. They were\r\nalso full of bitter complaints of the neglect in which the Army of\r\nPortugal was left as to pay, stores, and transport. Wellington might\r\nreasonably deduce from them that any reconcentration of that army would\r\nbe slow, and that if it had to march to reinforce Soult in the South,\r\nthe effort would be a severe one.\r\n\r\nBut shortly after Marmont’s return to Salamanca, his adversary got\r\nan even more valuable insight into his plans. The guerrilleros\r\ncarried off, between Salamanca and Valladolid, an officer bearing\r\nfive dispatches, dated April 28 and April 30th. One was directed to\r\nDorsenne, two to Berthier, one to Jourdan, the fifth contained the\r\nparole to Bayonne of the great scout, Colquhoun Grant[353]. The first,\r\ncouched in very peremptory terms, asked for food--the Army of Portugal\r\nmust absolutely receive 8,000 quintals of wheat, once promised,\r\nwithout delay--it was in a state of danger and penury, and could not\r\nkeep concentrated to face the British. Of the letters to Berthier one\r\nannounced that Bonnet’s division was duly in march for the Asturias,\r\nand that without it the Marshal thought his own strength dangerously\r\nlow. The other asked for 4,000,000 francs owing to the Army of Portugal\r\nfor pay and sustenance, and declared that, unless money came to hand at\r\nonce, it was impossible to see how the troops were to be kept alive in\r\nthe two months still remaining before harvest. A postscript asked for a\r\nsiege-train to be sent on at all costs--the Marshal had heard that one\r\nwas on the way from Bayonne: but nothing was known about it at Burgos.\r\nThe letter to Jourdan was the most important of all[354]: it was the\r\ndocument, already quoted in the previous chapter, in which the Marshal\r\ndetailed his intentions as to the dispersion of his army, protested\r\nagainst being obliged to send too many men into the valley of the\r\nTagus, and explained the importance of the bridge-forts and magazines\r\nat Almaraz, by which his troops at Avila, &c., would debouch southward\r\nwhenever they were ordered to concentrate for a junction with Soult.\r\n‘On ne peut agir que par Lugar Nuevo [the name by which Marmont always\r\ndesignates the Almaraz forts] ... il faut bien se garder de jeter trop\r\nde troupes sur le Tage, et se contenter de bien assurer une défense de\r\nhuit jours pour les forts de Lugar Nuevo et Mirabete, temps suffisant\r\npour que les troupes rassemblées à Avila débouchent.... Un dépôt de\r\n400 à 500 mille fanegas (qui n’est pas au delà de ce que Madrid et La\r\nManche peuvent fournir) donnerait les moyens d’agir sans compromettre\r\nla subsistance des troupes.’\r\n\r\n  [353] All the originals are in the Scovell Papers.\r\n\r\n  [354] It is the one printed in Ducasse’s _Correspondence of King\r\n  Joseph_, viii. pp. 413-17.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it was the deciphering of the greater part of this letter,\r\nwhich set forth so clearly the importance of the Almaraz bridge,\r\nand showed at the same time that only one French division [Foy’s at\r\nTalavera] was anywhere near it, that determined Wellington to make the\r\nsudden stroke at that central strategical point which he had thought\r\nof in February[355]. At that time he had refused to try it, because\r\nthere were three French divisions on the Tagus. Now there was only one\r\nat Talavera, two marches from Almaraz, and the nearest reinforcements\r\nat Avila were two very long marches from Talavera. The possibility\r\npresented itself that a column might strike at Almaraz from somewhere\r\non the Portuguese frontier, and take the place by a _coup-de-main_,\r\nwith or without first beating Foy, whose strength of 5,000 men was\r\nperfectly known to Wellington.\r\n\r\n  [355] See above, p. 202.\r\n\r\nHill could count on two or three days of undisturbed operations before\r\nthe nearest reinforcing division, that of Foy, could reach Almaraz: on\r\nfour or five more, before troops from Avila could come up. It must be\r\nnoted that everything would depend on the absolute secrecy that could\r\nbe preserved as to the start of the expedition: but on this Wellington\r\nthought that he could count. The Spanish peasantry seldom or never\r\nbetrayed him: the French had no outlying posts beyond Almaraz which\r\nmight give them warning. The garrison was in a normal state of blockade\r\nby guerrillero bands haunting the Sierra de Guadalupe.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that a blow at Almaraz was just as useful as a means\r\nfor keeping Soult from joining Marmont as Marmont from joining Soult.\r\nIt would be profitable if Wellington’s final decision should be\r\ngiven in favour of an Andalusian expedition. But his mind was by now\r\nleaning towards an attack on Leon rather than on the South. The final\r\ninclination may have been given by the receipt of another intercepted\r\ndispatch--Soult’s to Jourdan of April 17[356], sent in by guerrilleros\r\nwho had probably captured the bearer in the Sierra Morena about April\r\n20th. This document, which we have already had occasion to quote for\r\nanother purpose[357], was full of angry denunciations of Marmont for\r\nletting Badajoz fall unaided, and served to show that, if Soult had\r\nto help the Army of Portugal, he would do so with no good will to\r\nits commander. Moreover it was largely occupied by proposals for the\r\ncircumventing of Ballasteros and the siege of Tarifa--movements which\r\nwould disperse the Army of the South even more than it was already\r\ndispersed, and would clearly prevent it from succouring Marmont within\r\nany reasonable space of time.\r\n\r\n  [356] Original in the Scovell Papers. Place of capture uncertain,\r\n  but clearly taken by guerrilleros between Seville and Madrid.\r\n\r\n  [357] See above, pp. 269-70.\r\n\r\nThe decision that Hill should make his long-deferred _coup-de-main_\r\nupon Almaraz first appears in Wellington’s dispatches on May 4th[358],\r\nbut Hill had been warned that the operation was likely to be sanctioned\r\nsome days earlier, on April 24, and again more definitely on April\r\n30th[359]. That the final judgement of Wellington was now leaning\r\nin favour of the advance on Salamanca rather than the Andalusian\r\nraid appears to emerge from a note of D’Urban dated May 6th--’The\r\nretirement of Marmont within a given distance--the slow progress of the\r\nSpaniards at Rodrigo, which renders it unsafe to leave that place and\r\nthis frontier--the retiring altogether of Soult, and the state of his\r\narmy not making him dangerous now--these and other combining reasons\r\ndetermine Lord Wellington to make his offensive operation _north_ of\r\nthe Tagus, and to move upon Marmont. All necessary preparations making,\r\nbut secretly: it will be very feasible to keep the movement unforeseen\r\ntill it begins. Meanwhile General Hill is to move upon and destroy\r\neverything at Almaraz[360].’\r\n\r\n  [358] Wellington to Graham, Fuente Guinaldo, May 4, _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 114.\r\n\r\n  [359] Ibid., p. 101.\r\n\r\n  [360] D’Urban’s unpublished diary, under May 6.\r\n\r\nThe orders for Hill’s move were given out on May 7th. He was to march\r\nfrom his head-quarters at Almendralejo with two British brigades\r\n(Howard’s and Wilson’s) of the 2nd Division, and the Portuguese brigade\r\nattached to the division (Ashworth’s), one British cavalry regiment\r\n(13th Light Dragoons), and to cross the Guadiana at Merida. Beyond the\r\nGuadiana he would pick up Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry brigade, which\r\nwas lying at Arroyo dos Molinos. The march was then to be as rapid as\r\npossible, via Jaraicejo and Miravete. The expeditionary force made up\r\n7,000 men in all.\r\n\r\nThere were left in Estremadura to ‘contain’ Drouet the two English\r\ncavalry brigades of Hill’s force (Slade’s and Long’s)[361], one British\r\ninfantry brigade (Byng’s) of the 2nd Division, Hamilton’s Portuguese\r\ndivision, and Power’s unattached Portuguese brigade (late the garrison\r\nof Elvas, and more recently acting as that of Badajoz). The whole would\r\nmake up 11,000 men. Power, or at least some of his regiments, was now\r\ndisposable, because the Spaniards destined to hold Badajoz had begun to\r\narrive, and more were daily expected[362].\r\n\r\n  [361] Minus, of course, the 13th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [362] Erskine was the senior officer left with the corps--a\r\n  dangerous experiment. One marvels that Wellington risked it after\r\n  previous experience.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only precaution taken against Drouet, who had\r\nrecently been reported as a little inclined to move northward from\r\nFuente Ovejuna--detachments of his cavalry had been seen as far north\r\nas Zalamea[363]. Wellington determined to move down towards the\r\nGuadiana the southern or right wing of his main army--the 1st and 6th\r\nDivisions under Graham. First one and then the other were filed across\r\nthe bridge of Villa Velha and sent to Portalegre. Here they would be\r\nin a position to support the force left in front of Drouet, if Soult\r\nshould unexpectedly reinforce his Estremaduran corps. Wellington\r\nacknowledged that he disliked this wide extension of his army, but\r\njustified himself by observing that, if he had now his left wing almost\r\ntouching the Douro, and his right wing almost touching the Sierra\r\nMorena, he might risk the situation, because he was fully informed as\r\nto Marmont’s similar dispersion. The Army of Portugal was scattered\r\nfrom the Asturias to Talavera, and from its want of magazines and\r\ntransport, which Marmont’s intercepted dispatches made evident, would\r\nbe unable to concentrate as quickly as he himself could.\r\n\r\n  [363] Wellington to Graham, May 7, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 128.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Graham’s two divisions from the Castello Branco region\r\nto south of the Tagus had an additional advantage. If reported to the\r\nFrench it would tend to make them believe that the next offensive\r\noperation of the allied army would be in the direction of Andalusia,\r\nnot towards the Tormes. If Soult heard of it, he would begin to prepare\r\nto defend his own borders, and would not dream that Marmont was really\r\nthe enemy at whom Wellington was about to strike; while Marmont, on the\r\nother hand, thinking that Soult was to be the object of Wellington’s\r\nattentions, might be less careful of his own front. The expedition to\r\nAlmaraz would not undeceive either of them, since it was well suited\r\nfor a preliminary move in an attack on Andalusia, no less than for one\r\ndirected against Leon.\r\n\r\nHill’s column reached Merida on May 12th, but was delayed there\r\nfor some hours, because the bridge, broken in April, had not yet\r\nbeen repaired, as had been expected, the officers sent there having\r\ncontented themselves with organizing a service of boats for the\r\npassage. The bridge was hastily finished, but the troops only passed\r\nlate in the day; they picked up in the town the artillery and engineers\r\ntold off for the expedition, Glubb’s British and Arriaga’s Portuguese\r\ncompanies of artillery, who brought with them six 24-pounder howitzers,\r\na pontoon train, and wagons carrying some 30-foot ladders for\r\nescalading work. The importance attached to the raid by Wellington is\r\nshown by the fact that he placed Alexander Dickson, his most trusted\r\nartillery officer, in charge of this trifling detachment, which came up\r\nby the road north of the Guadiana by Badajoz and Montijo to join the\r\nmain column.\r\n\r\nOnce over the Guadiana, Hill reached Truxillo in three rapid marches\r\n[May 15], and there left all his baggage-train, save one mule for each\r\ncompany with the camp-kettles. The most difficult part of the route had\r\nnow been reached, three successive mountain ranges separating Truxillo\r\nfrom the Tagus. On the 16th, having crossed the first of them, the\r\ncolumn reached Jaraicejo: at dawn on the 17th, having made a night\r\nmarch, it was nearing the Pass of Miravete, the last defile above the\r\nriver. Here, as Hill was aware, the French had outlying works, an old\r\ncastle and two small forts, on very commanding ground, overlooking the\r\nwhole defile in such a way that guns and wagons could not possibly\r\npass them. The British general’s original intention was to storm the\r\nMiravete works at dawn, on the 17th, and at the same time to attack\r\nwith a separate column the forts at the bridge. With this purpose he\r\ndivided his troops into three detachments. Ashworth’s Portuguese and\r\nthe artillery were to keep to the _chaussée_, and make a demonstration\r\nof frontal attack on the Castle: General Tilson-Chowne [interim\r\ncommander of the 2nd Division at the moment[364]] was, with Wilson’s\r\nbrigade and the 6th Caçadores, to make a détour in the hills to the\r\nleft and to endeavour to storm the Castle from its rear side. General\r\nHoward, with the other British brigade, was to follow a similar bridle\r\npath to the right, and to descend on to the river and attack the forts\r\nby the bridge.\r\n\r\n  [364] This was the Tilson of 1809: he had lengthened his name.\r\n\r\nA miscalculation had been made--the by-paths which the flanking\r\ncolumns were to take proved so far more steep and difficult than had\r\nbeen expected, that by dawn neither of them had got anywhere near its\r\ndestination. Hill ordered them to halt, and put off the assault. This\r\nwas fortunate, for by a long and close reconnaissance in daylight it\r\nwas recognized that the Castle of Miravete and its dependent outworks,\r\nForts Colbert and Senarmont, were so placed on a precipitous conical\r\nhill that they appeared impregnable save by regular siege operations,\r\nfor which the expeditionary force had no time to spare. The most\r\nvexatious thing was that the garrison had discovered the main column\r\non the _chaussée_, and it could not be doubted that intelligence must\r\nhave been sent down to the lower forts, and most certainly to Foy\r\nat Talavera also. After a thorough inspection of the ground, Hill\r\nconcluded that he could not hope to master Miravete, and, while it was\r\nheld against him, his guns could not get through the pass which it so\r\neffectively commanded. It remained to be seen what could be done with\r\nthe forts at the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe Almaraz forts crowned two hills on each side of the Tagus. The\r\nstronger, Fort Napoleon, occupied the end of a long rising ground,\r\nabout 100 yards from the water’s edge; below it, and connecting\r\nwith it, was a masonry _tête-de-pont_ covering the end of the\r\npontoon-bridge. The weaker work, Fort Ragusa, was on an isolated\r\nknoll on the north bank, supporting the other end of the bridge. Fort\r\nNapoleon mounted nine guns, had a good but unpalisaded ditch around\r\nits bastioned front, and a second retrenchment, well palisaded, with\r\na loopholed stone tower within. Fort Ragusa was an oblong earthwork\r\nmounting six guns, and also provided with a central tower. It had as\r\noutwork a _flèche_ or lunette, commanding the north end of the bridge.\r\nThe small _tête-de-pont_ mounted three guns more. Half a mile up-stream\r\nwas the ruined masonry bridge which had formed the old crossing,\r\nwith the village of Almaraz on the north bank behind it. Between the\r\n_tête-de-pont_ and the old bridge were the magazines and storehouses in\r\nthe village of Lugar Nuevo.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of the works consisted of a depleted foreign corps, the\r\n_régiment de Prusse_ or 4th Étranger, mustering under 400 bayonets, of\r\na battalion of the French 39th of the Line, and of two companies of\r\nthe 6th Léger, from Foy’s division, with a company of artillery and\r\nanother of sappers. The whole may have amounted to 1,000 men, of whom\r\n300 were isolated in the high-lying Castle of Miravete, five miles from\r\nthe bridge-head. The governor, a Piedmontese officer named Aubert,\r\nhad manned Fort Napoleon with two companies of the 6th and 39th. The\r\nforeign corps and one company of the 6th were in Fort Ragusa and the\r\nbridge-head; Miravete was held by the centre companies of the 39th.\r\n\r\nThough delay after the French had got the alarm was dangerous, Hill\r\nspent the whole of the 17th in making fruitless explorations for\r\nvantage-ground, from which Miravete might be attacked. None was found,\r\nand on the 18th he made up his mind to adopt a scheme hazardous beyond\r\nhis original intention. It would be possible to mask the Castle by a\r\nfalse attack, in which all his artillery should join, and to lead part\r\nof his infantry over the hills to the right, by a gorge called the Pass\r\nof La Cueva, for a direct attack by escalade, without the help of guns,\r\nupon the Almaraz forts.\r\n\r\nThe detachment selected for this purpose was Howard’s brigade (1/50th,\r\n1/71st, 1/92nd), strengthened by the 6th Portuguese Line from\r\nAshworth’s brigade, and accompanied by 20 artillerymen in charge of the\r\nladders. So rough was the ground to be covered, that the long 30-foot\r\nladders had to be sawn in two, being unwieldy on slopes and angles, as\r\nwas soon discovered when they were taken off the carts for carriage\r\nby hand. The route that had to be followed was very circuitous, and\r\nthough the forts were only five miles, as the crow flies, from the\r\nplace where the column left the road, it took the whole night to reach\r\nthem. An eye-witness[365] describes it as a mazy sheep-walk among\r\nhigh brushwood, which could not have been used without the help of\r\nthe experienced peasant-guide who led the march. The men had to pass\r\nin Indian file over many of its stretches, and it resulted from long\r\nwalking in the darkness that the rear dropped far behind the van, and\r\nnearly lost touch with it. Just before dawn the column reached the\r\nhamlet of Romangordo, a mile from the forts, and rested there for some\r\ntime before resuming its march.\r\n\r\n  [365] Captain MacCarthy of the 50th.\r\n\r\nThe sun was well up when, at 6 o’clock, the leading company, coming\r\nto the edge of a thicket, suddenly saw Fort Napoleon only 300 yards\r\nin their front. The French had been warned that a column had crossed\r\nthe hills, and had caught some glimpse of it, but had lost sight of\r\nits latest move: many of the garrison could be seen standing on the\r\nramparts, and watching the puffs of smoke round the Castle of Miravete,\r\nwhich showed that the false attack on that high-lying stronghold\r\nhad begun. General Tilson-Chowne was making a noisy demonstration\r\nbefore it, using his artillery with much ostentation, and pushing up\r\nskirmishers among the boulders on the sides of the castle-hill[366].\r\n\r\n  [366] The statement in Jones’s _Sieges_, i. p. 259, that the\r\n  enemy were unaware of the turning column is disproved by the\r\n  official reports of the surviving French officers Sêve and Teppe.\r\n\r\nHill was anxious to assault at once, before the sun should rise higher,\r\nor the garrison of the forts catch sight of him. But some time had\r\nto be spent to allow a sufficient force to accumulate in the cover\r\nwhere the head of the column was hiding. So slowly did the companies\r\nstraggle in, that the General at last resolved to escalade at once with\r\nthe 50th and the right wing of the 71st, all that had yet come up.\r\nOrders were left behind that the left wing of the 71st and the 92nd\r\nshould attack the bridge-head entrenchment when they arrived, and the\r\n6th Portuguese support where they were needed.\r\n\r\nAt a little after 6 o’clock the 900 men available, in three columns of\r\na half-battalion each, headed by ladder parties, started up out of the\r\nbrake on the crest of the hillside nearest Fort Napoleon, and raced for\r\nthree separate points of its _enceinte_. The French, though taken by\r\nsurprise, had all their preparations ready, and a furious fire broke\r\nout upon the stormers both from cannon and musketry. Nevertheless all\r\nthree parties reached the goal without any very overwhelming losses,\r\njumped into the ditch, and began to apply their ladders to such points\r\nof the rampart as lay nearest to them. The assault was a very daring\r\none--the work was intact, the garrison adequate in numbers, the\r\nassailants had no advantage from darkness, for the sun was well up and\r\nevery man was visible. All that was in their favour was the suddenness\r\nof their onslaught, the number of separate points at which it was\r\nlaunched, and their own splendid dash and decision. Many men fell in\r\nthe first few minutes, and there was a check when it was discovered\r\nthat the ladders were over-short, owing to their having been sawn up\r\nbefore the start. But the rampart had a rather broad berm[367], a fault\r\nof construction, and the stormers, discovering this, climbed up on\r\nit, and dragging some of the ladders with them, relaid them against\r\nthe upper section of the defences, which they easily overtopped. By\r\nthis unexpected device a footing was established on the ramparts at\r\nseveral points simultaneously--Captain Candler of the 50th is said to\r\nhave been the first man over the parapet: he was pierced by several\r\nballs as he sprang down, and fell dead inside. The garrison had kept\r\nup a furious fire till the moment when they saw the assailants swarm\r\nover the parapet--then, however, there can be no doubt that most of\r\nthem flinched[368]: the governor tried to lead a counter-charge, but\r\nfound few to follow him; he was surrounded, and, refusing to surrender\r\nand striking at those who bade him yield, was piked by a sergeant of\r\nthe 50th and mortally wounded. So closely were the British and French\r\nmixed that the latter got no chance of manning the inner work, or the\r\nloopholed tower which should have served as their rallying-point.\r\nMany of the garrison threw down their arms, but the majority rushed\r\nout of the rear gate of the fort towards the neighbouring redoubt\r\nat the bridge-head. They were so closely followed that pursuers and\r\npursued went in a mixed mass into that work, whose gunners were unable\r\nto fire because their balls would have gone straight into their own\r\nflying friends. The foreign garrison of the _tête-de-pont_ made little\r\nattempt to resist, and fled over the bridge[369]. It is probable that\r\nthe British would have reached the other side along with them if the\r\ncentre pontoons had not been sunk: some say that they were struck by\r\na round-shot from Fort Ragusa, which had opened a fire upon the lost\r\nworks; others declare that some of the fugitives broke them, whether by\r\ndesign or by mischance of overcrowding[370].\r\n\r\n  [367] The berm is the line where the scarp of the ditch meets\r\n  the slope of the rampart: the scarp should be perpendicular, the\r\n  rampart-slope tends backward, hence there is a change on this\r\n  line from the vertical to the obtuse in the profile of the work.\r\n  The berm should have been only a foot or so wide and was three.\r\n\r\n  [368] The official report of the French captain, Sêve of the\r\n  6th Léger, accuses the grenadiers of the 39th of giving way and\r\n  bolting at the critical moment, and this is confirmed by the\r\n  report of the _chef de bataillon_ Teppe of the 39th, an unwilling\r\n  witness.\r\n\r\n  [369] According to Teppe’s narrative they left the walls, and\r\n  many hid in the bakehouses, while most of the officers headed the\r\n  rush for the bridge.\r\n\r\n  [370] Foy says that the centre link of the bridge was not a\r\n  regular pontoon but a river boat, which could be drawn out when\r\n  the garrison wanted to open the bridge for any purpose, and being\r\n  light it collapsed under the feet of the flying crowd (p. 163).\r\n\r\nThis ought to have been the end of Hill’s sudden success, since passage\r\nacross the Tagus was now denied him. But the enemy were panic-stricken;\r\nand when the guns of Fort Napoleon were trained upon Fort Ragusa by\r\nLieutenant Love and the twenty gunners who had accompanied Hill’s\r\ncolumn, the garrison evacuated it, and went off with the rest of the\r\nfugitives in a disorderly flight towards Naval Moral. The formidable\r\nworks of Almaraz had fallen before the assault of 900 men--for the\r\ntail of Hill’s column arrived on the scene to find all over[371].\r\nFour grenadiers of the 92nd, wishing to do something if they had been\r\ndisappointed of the expected day’s work, stripped, swam the river,\r\nand brought back several boats which had been left moored under Fort\r\nRagusa. By means of these communication between the two banks was\r\nre-established, and the fort beyond the river was occupied[372].\r\n\r\n  [371] The 92nd and the right wing of the 71st reached the\r\n  _tête-de-pont_ just as the fugitives from Fort Napoleon entered\r\n  it, and swept away the garrison. They only lost two wounded.\r\n\r\n  [372] Gardyne’s history of the 92nd gives the names of two of\r\n  these gallant men, Gauld and Somerville.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the victors was very moderate--it fell mostly on the 50th\r\nand 71st, for Chowne’s demonstration against Miravete had been almost\r\nbloodless--only one ensign and one private of the 6th Caçadores were\r\nwounded. But the 50th lost one captain and 26 men killed, and seven\r\nofficers and 93 men wounded, while the half-battalion of the 71st had\r\nfive killed and five officers and 47 men wounded[373]. The 92nd had two\r\nwounded. Thus the total of casualties was 189.\r\n\r\n  [373] Hill’s total of casualties is 2 officers and 31 men killed:\r\n  13 officers and 143 wounded. The second officer killed was\r\n  Lieutenant Thiele of the Artillery of the K.G.L., accidentally\r\n  blown up by a mine on the day of the evacuation. But two of the\r\n  wounded officers died.\r\n\r\nOf the garrison the 4th Étranger was pretty well destroyed--those who\r\nwere neither killed nor taken mostly deserted, and its numbers had gone\r\ndown from 366 in the return of May 15 to 88 in that of July 1. The\r\ncompanies of the 39th and 6th Léger also suffered heavily, since they\r\nhad furnished the whole of the unlucky garrison of Fort Napoleon. Hill\r\nreports 17 officers and 262 men taken prisoners, including the mortally\r\nwounded governor and a _chef de bataillon_ of the 39th[374]. It is\r\nprobable that the whole loss of the French was at least 400.\r\n\r\n  [374] Teppe by name, whose narrative, written in captivity, is\r\n  our best source for the French side. It is a frank confession of\r\n  misbehaviour by the troops--particularly the 4th Étranger.\r\n\r\nThe trophies taken consisted of a colour of the 4th Étranger, 18 guns\r\nmounted in the works, an immense store of powder and round-shot,\r\n120,000 musket cartridges, the 20 large pontoons forming the bridge,\r\nwith a store of rope, timbers, anchors, carriages, &c., kept for its\r\nrepair, some well-furnished workshops, and a large miscellaneous\r\nmagazine of food and other stores. All this was destroyed, the\r\npontoons, &c., being burnt, while the powder was used to lay many mines\r\nin the forts and bridgehead, which were blown up very successfully\r\non the morning of the 20th, so that hardly a trace of them remained.\r\nThiele of the German artillery, the officer charged with carrying\r\nout the explosions, was unfortunately killed by accident: a mine had\r\napparently failed; he went back to see to its match, but it blew up\r\njust as he was inspecting it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALMARAZ]\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished his purpose with complete success, Hill moved\r\noff without delay, and by two forced marches reached Truxillo and\r\nhis baggage on the 21st. Here he was quite safe: Foy, being too weak\r\nto pursue him to any effect, followed cautiously, and only reached\r\nMiravete (whose garrison he relieved) on the 23rd and Truxillo on the\r\n25th, from whence he turned back, being altogether too late. He had\r\nreceived news of Hill’s movement rather late on the 17th, had been\r\nmisinformed as to his strength, which report made 15,000 men instead\r\nof the real 7,000, and so had been disposed to act cautiously. He had\r\nordered a battalion of the 6th Léger from Naval Moral to join the\r\ngarrison of Almaraz, but it arrived on the afternoon of the 19th,\r\nonly in time to hear from fugitives of the disaster[375]. He himself\r\nwas confident that the forts could hold out eight days even against\r\nartillery, which was also Marmont’s calculation. Hence their fall\r\nwithin 48 hours of Hill’s appearance was a distressing surprise: Foy\r\nhad calculated on being helped not only by D’Armagnac from Talavera but\r\nby the division of Clausel from Avila, before moving to fight Hill and\r\nrelieve them.\r\n\r\n  [375] D’Armagnac also sent the battalion of Frankfort for the\r\n  same purpose, which arrived late with less excuse. See Foy, p.\r\n  375.\r\n\r\nWellington appears to have been under the impression that this\r\nexpedition, which Hill had executed with such admirable celerity and\r\ndispatch, might have been made even more decisive, by the capture of\r\nthe castle of Miravete, if untoward circumstances had not intervened.\r\nIn a letter to Lord Liverpool, written on May 28[376], he expresses\r\nthe opinion that Tilson-Chowne might have taken it on the night of the\r\n16th--which must appear a hazardous decision to those who look at the\r\nprecipitous position of the place and the strength of its defences.\r\nHe also says that Hill might have stopped at Almaraz for a few days\r\nmore, and have bombarded Miravete with Dickson’s heavy howitzers, if\r\nhe had not received false news from Sir William Erskine as to Drouet’s\r\nmovements in Estremadura. There can be no doubt, as we shall see, about\r\nthe false intelligence: but whether the bombardment would have been\r\nsuccessful is another thing. Probably Wellington considered that the\r\ngarrison would have been demoralized after what had happened at Almaraz.\r\n\r\n  [376] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 189.\r\n\r\nAs to Drouet’s movements, having received rather tardy notice of\r\nHill’s northward march from Merida, he had resolved to make a push to\r\nascertain what was left in his front. Lallemand’s dragoons, therefore,\r\npressed out in the direction of Zafra, where they came into contact\r\nwith Slade’s outposts and drove them in. At the same time Drouet\r\nhimself, with an infantry division and some light cavalry, advanced\r\nas far as Don Benito, near Medellin, on the 17th May, from whence he\r\npushed patrols across the Guadiana as far as Miajadas. This movement,\r\nmade to ascertain whether Hill had departed with his whole corps, or\r\nwhether a large force had been left in Estremadura, was reported to Sir\r\nWilliam Erskine, the commander of the 2nd cavalry division, along with\r\nrumours that Soult was across the Sierra Morena and closely supporting\r\nDrouet. Erskine sent on the news to Graham at Portalegre, and to Hill,\r\nwho was then before Miravete, with assertions that Soult was certainly\r\napproaching. This, as Wellington knew, was unlikely, for the Marshal\r\nhad been before Cadiz on the 11th, and could not possibly have crossed\r\nthe Sierra Morena by the 17th. As a matter of fact he only learnt on\r\nthe 19th, at Chiclana, that Hill had started, and Drouet’s move was\r\nmade purely to gain information and on his own responsibility. But\r\nGraham, naturally unaware of this, brought up his two divisions to\r\nBadajoz, as he had been directed to do if Estremadura were attacked\r\nduring Hill’s absence. And Hill himself was certainly induced to return\r\npromptly from Almaraz by Erskine’s letter, though it is doubtful\r\nwhether he would have lingered to besiege Miravete even if he had not\r\nreceived it. For Foy might have been reinforced by D’Armagnac and the\r\nAvila division up to a strength which would have made Hill’s longer\r\nstay on the Tagus undesirable.\r\n\r\nDrouet did no more; indeed, with his own force he was quite helpless\r\nagainst Hill, since when he discovered that there was a large body\r\nof allied troops left in Estremadura, and that more were coming up,\r\nit would have been mad for him to move on Merida, or take any other\r\nmethod of molesting the return of the expedition from Almaraz. Though\r\nSoult spoke of coming with a division to his aid, the succours must be\r\nmany days on the way, while he himself could only act effectively by\r\nmarching northward at once. But if he had taken his own division he\r\nwould have been helpless against Hill, who could have beaten such a\r\nforce; while if he had crossed the Guadiana with his whole 12,000 men,\r\nhe would have been cut off from Soult by the ‘uncontained’ allied force\r\nleft in Estremadura, which he knew to be considerable.\r\n\r\nBut to move upon Almaraz on his own responsibility, and without Soult’s\r\norders, would have been beyond Drouet’s power: he was a man under\r\nauthority, who dared not take such a step. And when Soult’s dispatches\r\nreached him, they directed him not to lose touch with Andalusia, but to\r\ndemonstrate enough to bring Hill back. The Marshal did not intend to\r\nlet Drouet get out of touch with him, by bidding him march toward the\r\nTagus.\r\n\r\nHill’s column, then, was never in any danger. But Wellington, who had\r\nfor a moment some anxiety in his behalf, was deeply vexed by Erskine’s\r\nfalse intelligence, which had given rise to that feeling, and wrote in\r\nwrath to Henry Wellesley and Graham[377] concerning the mischief that\r\nthis very incapable officer had done. He was particularly chagrined\r\nthat Graham had been drawn down to Badajoz by the needless alarm, as he\r\nwas intending to bring him back to join the main army within a short\r\ntime, and the movement to Badajoz had removed him three marches from\r\nPortalegre, so that six days in all would be wasted in bringing him\r\nback to his original starting-point. It is curious that Wellington did\r\nnot harden his heart to get rid of Erskine after this mishap: but\r\nthough he wrote bitterly about his subordinate’s incapacity, he did\r\nnot remove him. ‘Influence’ at home was apparently the key to his long\r\nendurance: it will be remembered that this was by no means the first of\r\nErskine’s mistakes[378].\r\n\r\n  [377] To both on June 1. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 197. Erskine’s name\r\n  is the blank to be filled up.\r\n\r\n  [378] See vol. iv. pp. 133 and 191.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Almaraz forts, as might have been expected, was\r\ninterpreted by Marmont and Soult each from his own point of view. The\r\nformer, rightly as it turned out, wrote to Foy that he must be prepared\r\nto return to Leon at short notice, and that the Army of the Centre\r\nand Drouet must guard the valley of the Tagus on his departure[379].\r\nSoult, on the other hand, having heard of Graham’s arrival at Badajoz\r\nand Hill’s return to Merida, argued that the allies were massing on\r\nthe Guadiana for an advance into Andalusia. He made bitter complaints\r\nto Jourdan that he had violated the rules of military subordination by\r\nsending a letter to Drouet warning him that he might be called up to\r\nthe Tagus. It was unheard of, he said, to communicate directly with a\r\nsubordinate, who ought to be written to only through the channel of\r\nhis immediate superior. He even threatened to resign the command of\r\nthe Army of the South[380]--but when Joseph showed no signs of being\r\nterrified by this menace, no more was heard of it. The viceroyalty of\r\nAndalusia was not a thing to be lightly given up.\r\n\r\n  [379] Marmont to Foy, June 1.\r\n\r\n  [380] See Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, pp. 399-400.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident to Wellington that the surprise of Almaraz was\r\nnot to be resented by the enemy in any practical form. Foy was not\r\nreinforced, nor was Drouet brought up to the Tagus: it was clear that\r\nthe French were too weak to take the offensive either in the North or\r\nthe South, even under such provocation. They could not even rebuild\r\nthe lost bridge: the transport from Madrid of a new pontoon train as a\r\nsubstitute for the lost boats was beyond King Joseph’s power. One or\r\ntwo boats were finally got to Almaraz--but nothing that could serve as\r\na bridge. Nor were the lost magazines ever replaced.\r\n\r\nIt was at this same time that Wellington took in hand a scheme for\r\nfacilitating his communications north and south, which was to have a\r\nhigh strategical importance. As long as Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz\r\nwere in the enemy’s hands, the most eastern crossing of the Tagus\r\npracticable for the Anglo-Portuguese army was the boat-bridge of Villa\r\nVelha. But when these two fortresses were regained, it was possible\r\nto open up a line farther east, which had not been available for two\r\nyears. Since Mayne blew up the ancient Roman bridge of Alcantara in\r\nJune 1809[381], the Middle Tagus had been impassable for both sides.\r\nThe allies had usually been in possession of both banks of the Tagus\r\nin this direction, but so intermittently that it had never been worth\r\ntheir while to restore the passage, which would have been lost to them\r\nwhenever the French (as not unfrequently happened) extended their\r\noperations into the Coria-Zarza Mayor country on the north bank, or the\r\nCaçeres-Albuquerque country on the other. But when the enemy had lost\r\nboth Badajoz and Rodrigo, and had no posts nearer to Alcantara than the\r\nUpper Tormes, the forts of Miravete, and Zalamea, when, moreover, he\r\nhad adopted a distinctly defensive attitude for many months, Wellington\r\nthought it worth while to recover possession of a passage which would\r\nshorten the route from Estremadura to the frontiers of Leon by a\r\nhundred miles, and would therefore give him an advantage of six marches\r\nover the enemy in transferring troops from north to south. Whether\r\nAlmaraz were again seized and reoccupied by the French mattered little:\r\nthe restoration of Alcantara would be safe and profitable.\r\n\r\n  [381] See vol. ii. p. 444.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on May 24th, Colonel Sturgeon[382] and Major Todd\r\nof the Royal Staff Corps were sent to Alcantara to report on the\r\npracticability of restoring the broken arch, which, owing to the\r\nimmense depth of the cañon of the Tagus, overhung the river by no less\r\nthan 140 feet. It was intended that if the engineering problem should\r\nprove too hard, a flying bridge of rafts, boats, or pontoons should\r\nbe established at the water level[383]. But Sturgeon and Todd did\r\nmore than Wellington had expected, and succeeded in a very few days\r\nin establishing a sort of suspension-bridge of ropes between the two\r\nshattered piers of Trajan’s great structure. The system adopted was\r\nthat of placing at each end of the broken roadway a very large and\r\nsolid beam, clamped to the Roman stones, by being sunk in channels cut\r\nin them. These beams being made absolutely adhesive to the original\r\nwork, served as solid bases from which a series of eighteen cables were\r\nstretched over the gap. Eight more beams, with notches cut in them\r\nto receive the cables, were laid at right angles across the parallel\r\nropes, and lashed tight to them. The long cables were strained taut\r\nwith winches: a network of rope yarn for a flooring was laid between\r\nthe eight beams, and on this planks were placed, while a screen of\r\ntarpaulins supported on guide-ropes acted as parapets. The structure\r\nwas sound enough to carry not only infantry and horses, but heavy\r\nartillery, yet could always be broken up in a short time if an enemy\r\nhad ever appeared in the neighbourhood[384]. Several times it was\r\nrolled up, and then replaced.\r\n\r\n  [382] An officer probably better remembered by the general reader\r\n  as the husband of Sarah Curran, Robert Emmet’s sometime fiancée,\r\n  than as the executor of some of Wellington’s most important\r\n  engineering works. He fell before Bayonne in 1814.\r\n\r\n  [383] See Wellington to Graham, 23rd and 24th May. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. pp. 163-5.\r\n\r\n  [384] The best and most elaborate account of this is in Leith\r\n  Hay, i. pp. 300-1.\r\n\r\nWhen the completion of the repairs of Alcantara and the destruction of\r\nthe French bridge of Almaraz are taken together, it must be concluded\r\nthat Wellington’s work in May gave him an advantage over the French of\r\nat least ten or twelve marches in moving troops from north to south\r\nor vice versa. For the route from Ciudad Rodrigo to Merida, now open\r\nto him, had at least that superiority over the only itinerary of the\r\nenemy, which would be that by Avila, Talavera, Toledo, and the eastern\r\npasses of the Sierra Morena. Though the narrow bridge of Arzobispo on\r\nthe Middle Tagus still remained in French hands, it did not lead on to\r\nany good road to Estremadura or Andalusia, but on to the defiles of the\r\nMesa d’Ibor and the ravines of the Sierra de Guadalupe. No large force\r\ncould march or feed in those solitudes.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready for the advance upon the Tormes, which Wellington had\r\nmade up his mind to execute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S ADVANCE INTO LEON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till June 13th that Wellington crossed the Agueda and began\r\nhis march upon Salamanca, the first great offensive movement against\r\nthe main fighting army of the French since the advance to Talavera in\r\n1809. But for many days beforehand his troops were converging on Fuente\r\nGuinaldo and Ciudad Rodrigo from their widely-spread cantonments.\r\nGraham’s divisions quitted Portalegre on May 30th, and some of the\r\nother troops, which had been left on the western side of the Beira,\r\nhad also to make an early start. Every available infantry unit of the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese army had been drawn in, save the 2nd Division and\r\nHamilton’s Portuguese--left as usual with Hill in Estremadura--and\r\nPower’s new Portuguese brigade--once the garrisons of Elvas and\r\nAbrantes--which had become available for the field since the fall\r\nof Badajoz made it possible to place those fortresses in charge of\r\nmilitia. Its arrival made Hill stronger by 2,000 in infantry than he\r\nhad ever been before, and he was also left the three brigades (Long’s\r\nand Slade’s British and John Campbell’s Portuguese) of Erskine’s\r\ncavalry division. The total was 18,000 men. Wellington’s own main army,\r\nconsisting of the seven other infantry divisions, Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese brigades, and the cavalry of Anson, Bock, Le Marchant,\r\nand Victor Alten, made up a force of 48,000 men, of which 3,500 were\r\ncavalry: there were only eight British and one Portuguese batteries\r\nwith the army--a short allowance of 54 guns.\r\n\r\nBut though these 48,000 men constituted the striking force, which was\r\nto deal the great blow, their action was to be supported by a very\r\nelaborate and complicated system of diversions, which were intended\r\nto prevent the French armies of the South, North, Centre, and Aragon\r\nfrom sending any help to Marmont, the foe whom Wellington was set\r\non demolishing. It is necessary to explain the concentric scheme\r\nby which it was intended that pressure should be brought to bear\r\non all the outlying French armies, at the same moment at which the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese main body crossed the Agueda.\r\n\r\nSoult had the largest force--over 50,000 men, as a recently captured\r\nmorning-state revealed to his adversary[385]. But he could not\r\nassemble more than some 24,000 men, unless he abandoned the siege of\r\nCadiz and the kingdom of Granada--half his army was pinned down to\r\noccupation-work. Wherefore Wellington judged that his field-force\r\ncould be ‘contained’ by Hill, if only means were found of preventing\r\nhim from reinforcing Drouet’s divisions in Estremadura by any\r\nappreciable succours. This means lay to hand in the roving army of\r\nBallasteros, whose random schemes of campaign were often irrational,\r\nbut had the solitary advantage of being quite inscrutable. He might do\r\nanything--and so was a most tiresome adversary for Soult to deal with,\r\nsince his actions could not be foreseen. At this moment Wellington had\r\nurged the Cadiz Regency to stir up Ballasteros to activity, and had\r\npromised that, if Soult concentrated against him, Hill should press\r\nin upon Drouet, and so call off the Marshal’s attention. Similarly\r\nif Soult concentrated against Hill, Ballasteros was to demonstrate\r\nagainst Seville, or the rear of the Cadiz Lines. There was always the\r\npossibility that the Spanish general might refuse to obey the orders of\r\nhis Government, or that he might commit himself to some rash enterprise\r\nand get badly beaten. Both these chances had to be risked. The one that\r\noccurred was that Ballasteros took up the idea desired, but acted too\r\nearly and too incautiously, and sustained a severe check at the battle\r\nof Bornos (June 1). Fortunately he was ‘scotched but not slain,’ and\r\nkept together a force large enough to give Soult much further trouble,\r\nthough he did not prevent the Marshal from sending reinforcements to\r\nDrouet and putting Hill upon the defensive. Of this more in its due\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n  [385] See Wellington to Henry Wellesley at Cadiz, June 7.\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 219.\r\n\r\nSo much for the diversion against Soult. On the other flank Wellington\r\nhad prepared a similar plan for molesting the French in the Asturias,\r\nand threatening Marmont’s flank and rear, at the same moment that his\r\nfront was to be assailed. The force here available was Abadia’s Army of\r\nGalicia, which nominally counted over 24,000 men, but had 6,000 of them\r\nshut up in the garrisons of Corunna, Ferrol, and Vigo. About 16,000\r\ncould be put into the field by an effort, if only Abadia were stirred\r\nup to activity. But there were many hindrances: this general was (like\r\nmost of his predecessors) at strife with the Galician Junta. He was\r\nalso very jealous of Sir Howard Douglas, the British Commissioner at\r\nCorunna, who was in favour with the Junta and people, and was inclined\r\nto resent any advice offered by him[386]. His army was not only (as in\r\n1810-11) very short of cavalry--there were only about 400 effective\r\nsabres--but also of artillery. For the Cadiz government, searching\r\nfor troops to send against the rebels of South America, had recently\r\ndrafted off several batteries, as well as several foot regiments, to\r\nthe New World. The most effective units had been taken, to the wild\r\nindignation of the Galicians, who wanted to keep the troops that\r\nthey had raised for their own protection. There were only about 500\r\ntrained artillerymen left in Galicia, and when deduction was made for\r\nthe garrisons of Ferrol, Vigo, and Corunna, very few remained for the\r\nactive army. Abadia had, therefore, many excuses to offer for taking\r\nthe field late, and with insufficient equipment[387]. It was fortunate\r\nthat his superior, Castaños, who commanded (as Captain-General both\r\nof Estremadura and Galicia) all the troops in western Spain, fell in\r\ncompletely with Wellington’s plan, and brought pressure to bear upon\r\nhis subordinate, coming up to Santiago in person to expedite matters.\r\n\r\n  [386] An extraordinary case of Abadia’s ill will occurred in this\r\n  spring: a damaged transport, carrying British troops to Lisbon,\r\n  having put in to Corunna to repair, permission was refused for\r\n  the men to land: apparently it was suspected that they were\r\n  trying to garrison Corunna.\r\n\r\n  [387] For all this Galician business see the _Life of Sir Howard\r\n  Douglas_, pp. 120-60.\r\n\r\nThe part which the Army of Galicia was to play in the general scheme\r\nwas that of marching upon Astorga, and laying siege to the considerable\r\nFrench garrison which was isolated in that rather advanced position. If\r\nMarmont should attempt to succour it, he would be left weak in front\r\nof the oncoming British invasion. If he did not, its fall would turn\r\nand expose his right flank, and throw all the plains of northern Leon\r\ninto the power of the allies. A move in force upon Astorga would also\r\nhave some effect on the position of General Bonnet in the Asturias, and\r\nought certainly to keep him uneasy, if not to draw him away from his\r\nconquests.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Bonnet had been directed to reoccupy the\r\nAsturias by Napoleon’s special command, and by no means to Marmont’s\r\nliking[388]. He marched from Leon on May 15, by the road across\r\nthe pass of Pajares, which he had so often taken before on similar\r\nexpeditions. The Asturians made no serious resistance, and on May 17-18\r\nBonnet seized Oviedo and its port of Gijon. But, as in 1811, when he\r\nhad accomplished this much, and planted some detachments in the coast\r\ntowns, his division of 6,000 men was mainly immobilized, and became\r\na string of garrisons rather than a field-force. It was observed\r\nby Porlier’s Cantabrian bands on its right hand, and by Castañon’s\r\ndivision of the Army of Galicia on its left, and was not strong enough\r\nto hunt them down, though it could prevent them from showing themselves\r\nanywhere in the neighbourhood of Oviedo.\r\n\r\n  [388] See above, p. 210.\r\n\r\nBut if the Galicians should lay siege to Astorga, and push advanced\r\nguards beyond it, in the direction of the city of Leon, it was clear\r\nthat Bonnet’s position would be threatened, and his communications with\r\nhis chief, Marmont, imperilled. Wellington, who knew from intercepted\r\ndispatches the importance attached by the Emperor to the retention of\r\nthe Asturias, judged that Bonnet would not evacuate it, but would spend\r\nhis energy in an attempt to hold back the Galicians and keep open his\r\nconnexion with Leon. He thus hoped that the French division at Oviedo\r\nwould never appear near Salamanca--an expectation in which he was to\r\nbe deceived, for Marmont (disregarding his master’s instructions)\r\nordered the evacuation of the Asturias the moment that he discovered\r\nthe strength of the attack that was being directed against his front\r\non the Tormes. Hence Wellington’s advance cleared the Asturias of the\r\nenemy, and enabled the Galicians to besiege Astorga unmolested for two\r\nmonths--good results in themselves, but not the precise benefits that\r\nhe had hoped to secure by putting the Galician army in motion.\r\n\r\nNo item of assistance being too small to be taken into consideration,\r\nWellington also directed Silveira to advance from the Tras-os-Montes,\r\nwith the four militia regiments of that province[389], to cross the\r\nSpanish frontier and blockade Zamora, the outlying French garrison on\r\nthe Douro, which covered Marmont’s flank, as Astorga did his rear.\r\nTo enable this not too trustworthy irregular force to guard itself\r\nfrom sudden attacks, Wellington lent it a full brigade of regular\r\ncavalry[390], which was entrusted to General D’Urban, who dropped the\r\npost of Chief-of-the-Staff to Beresford to take up this small but\r\nresponsible charge. His duty was to watch the country on each side\r\nof the Douro in Silveira’s front, so as to prevent him from being\r\nsurprised, and generally to keep Wellington informed about Marmont’s\r\nright wing, when he should begin to concentrate. Toro, only 20 miles\r\nfarther up the Douro than Zamora, was another French garrison, and a\r\nlikely place for the Marshal to use as one of his minor bases. Silveira\r\nbeing as rash as he was enterprising, it was D’Urban’s task to see that\r\nhe should be warned betimes, and not allowed to get into trouble. He\r\nwas to retreat on Carvajales and the mountains beyond the Esla if he\r\nwere attacked by a superior force.\r\n\r\n  [389] Chaves, Braganza, Miranda, Villa Real.\r\n\r\n  [390] Silveira already had Nos. 11 and 12, D’Urban brought up No.\r\n  1, which had not hitherto operated on this frontier.\r\n\r\nA much more serious diversion was prepared to distract the free\r\nmovement of the French Army of the North, from which Caffarelli\r\nmight naturally be expected to send heavy detachments for Marmont’s\r\nassistance, when the British striking-force should advance on\r\nSalamanca. Caffarelli’s old enemies were the patriot bands of Cantabria\r\nand Navarre, who had given his predecessor, Dorsenne, so much trouble\r\nearlier in the year. Mina, on the borders of Navarre, Aragon, and\r\nOld Castile, was very far away, and not easy to communicate with or\r\nto bring into the general plan, though his spirit was excellent. But\r\nthe so-called ‘Seventh Army,’ under Mendizabal, was near enough to be\r\ntreated as a serious factor in the general scheme. This force consisted\r\nof the two large bands under Porlier in Cantabria, and Longa in the\r\nmountains above Santander, each of which was several thousands strong:\r\nthese were supposed to be regular divisions, though their training\r\nleft much to be desired: in addition there were several considerable\r\nguerrilla ‘partidas’ under Merino, Salazar, Saornil, and other chiefs,\r\nwho lived a hunted life in the provinces of Burgos, Palencia, and\r\nAvila, and were in theory more or less dependent on Mendizabal. The\r\nchief of the Seventh Army was requested to do all that he could to keep\r\nCaffarelli employed during the month of June--a task that quite fell in\r\nwith his ideas--he executed several very daring raids into Old Castile,\r\none of which put the garrison of Burgos in great terror, as it was\r\nsurprised at a moment when all its better items chanced to be absent,\r\nand nothing was left in the place but dépôts and convalescents[391].\r\n\r\n  [391] See Thiébault, _Mémoires_, v. p. 561.\r\n\r\nBut the main distraction contrived to occupy the French Army of the\r\nNorth was one for which Wellington was not primarily responsible,\r\nthough he approved of it when the scheme was laid before him. This\r\nwas a naval expedition to attack the coast-forts of Cantabria and\r\nBiscay, and open up direct communication with Mendizabal’s bands\r\nfrom the side of the sea. The idea was apparently started by Sir\r\nHoward Douglas and Sir Home Popham, the former of whom was a great\r\nbeliever in the _guerrilleros_, and the latter a strong advocate of\r\nthe striking power of the navy. Nothing serious had been done on the\r\nBiscay coast since the two expeditions of 1810, of which the former\r\nhad been very successful, but the latter had ended in the disastrous\r\ntempest which wrecked Renovales’s flotilla on that rocky shore[392].\r\nLord Liverpool consented to give Popham two battalions of marines and\r\na company of artillery, to add to the force provided by the crews of\r\nthe _Venerable_, his flagship, five frigates (_Surveillante_, _Rhin_,\r\n_Isis_, _Diadem_, _Medusa_), and several smaller vessels. The plan was\r\nto proceed eastward along the coast from Gijon, to call down Longa and\r\nPorlier to blockade each isolated French garrison from the land side,\r\nand to batter it with heavy ship guns from the water. The opportunity\r\nwas to be taken at the same time of making over to the Cantabrian bands\r\na large store of muskets and munitions which had been prepared for\r\nthem. The arrangements were made in May, and Popham’s squadron was\r\nready to move precisely at the same moment that Wellington crossed the\r\nAgueda. Its first descent was made on June 17th, a day exactly suitable\r\nfor alarming the Army of the North at the same time that Marmont’s\r\nfirst appeals for help were likely to reach Caffarelli. The plan, as\r\nwe shall see, worked exceedingly well, and the fact that the Army of\r\nPortugal got no reinforcements from Burgos or Biscay was due entirely\r\nto the dismay caused to Caffarelli by this unexpected descent on his\r\nrear. He conceived that the squadron carried a large landing force, and\r\nthat he was about to see Biscay slip out of his hands. The tale of this\r\nuseful diversion will be told in its due place.\r\n\r\n  [392] See vol. iii. pp. 486-7.\r\n\r\nThere was yet one more item in the long list of outlying distractions\r\non which Wellington relied for the vexing of the French. He was\r\nstrongly of opinion that Suchet would spare troops to reinforce King\r\nJoseph at Madrid, if his own invasion of Leon had a prosperous start.\r\nIndeed, he somewhat overvalued the Duke of Albufera’s will and power to\r\ninterfere in central Spain, his idea being that King Joseph had a much\r\nmore direct control over the Valencian and Aragonese armies than was\r\nreally the case. One of the king’s intercepted dispatches, directing\r\nSuchet to send troops into La Mancha, had fallen into his hands, and\r\nhe was unaware that the Marshal had refused to obey it, and had found\r\nplausible reasons to cloak his disobedience[393].\r\n\r\n  [393] See above, p. 304. The intercepted cipher is in the Scovell\r\n  Papers.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity of finding means to harass Suchet depended on the\r\ngeneral posture of affairs in the Mediterranean caused by the outbreak\r\nof the Russian war. As long as Napoleon kept a large army in Italy,\r\nthere was always a possibility that he might some day try a descent on\r\nSicily, where the authority of King Ferdinand rested on the bayonets\r\nof a strong British garrison. There were a dozen red-coated battalions\r\nalways ready in Sicily, beside the rather inefficient forces of King\r\nFerdinand. In September 1810 Murat had massed a Franco-Neapolitan army\r\nat Reggio, and tried an actual invasion, which ended ignominiously in\r\nthe capture of the only two battalions that succeeded in landing. But\r\nby the early spring of 1812 it was known that nearly all the French\r\ntroops in Italy had been moved northward, and a great part of Murat’s\r\nNeapolitan army with them. By April, indeed, there was only one French\r\ndivision left in the whole Peninsula, nearly all the old ‘Army of\r\nItaly’ having marched across the Alps. Lord William Bentinck, the\r\ncommander of the British forces in Sicily, had early notice of these\r\nmovements, and being a man of action and enterprising mind, though\r\ntoo much given to wavering councils and rapid changes of purpose, was\r\nanxious to turn the new situation to account. He was divided between\r\ntwo ideas--the one which appealed to him most was to make a bold\r\ndescent on the under-garrisoned Italian peninsula, either to stir up\r\ntrouble in Calabria--where the ruthless government of Murat’s military\r\nsatraps had barely succeeded in keeping down rebellion, but had not\r\ncrushed its spirit--or, farther away, in the former dominions of the\r\nPope and the small dukes of the Austrian connexion. But the memory\r\nof the fruitless attempt against the Italian mainland in 1809 under\r\nSir John Stuart survived as a warning: it was doubtful whether the\r\noccasional adventurers who came to Palermo to promise insurrection\r\nin northern Italy had any backing[394], and though Calabria was a\r\nmore promising field, it was to be remembered that such troops as\r\nthe enemy still retained were mainly concentrated there. Thus it\r\ncame to pass that Lord William Bentinck at times despaired of all\r\nItalian expeditions, and thought of sending a force to Catalonia or\r\nValencia to harass Suchet. ‘I cannot but imagine,’ he wrote, ‘that the\r\noccasional disembarkation at different points of a large regular force\r\nmust considerably annoy the enemy, and create an important diversion\r\nfor other Spanish operations[395].’ But when he wrote this, early in\r\nthe year, he was hankering after descents on Elba and Corsica--the\r\nlatter a most wild inspiration! These schemes the ministry very wisely\r\ncondemned: Lord Liverpool wrote in reply that ‘though there might be a\r\nconsiderable degree of dissatisfaction, and even of ferment, pervading\r\nthe greater part of Italy,’ there was no evidence of any systematic\r\nconspiracy to shake off the yoke of France. Corsica and Elba, even if\r\nconquered, would only be of secondary importance. A diversion to be\r\nmade upon the east coast of Spain would be far the best way in which\r\nthe disposable force in Sicily could be employed. Wellington had been\r\ninformed of the proposal, and might probably be able to lend part of\r\nthe garrison of Cadiz, to make the expedition more formidable. Sir\r\nEdward Pellew, the admiral commanding on the Mediterranean station,\r\nwould be able to give advice, and arrange for the co-operation of the\r\nfleet[396]. Lord Liverpool wrote on the next day (March 4) to inform\r\nWellington of the answer that had been made to Bentinck, but pointed\r\nout that probably the aid could only be given from May to October, as\r\nthe expedition would depend on the fleet, and naval men thought that\r\nit would be impossible to keep a large squadron in attendance on the\r\nSicilian force during the winter months. The troops would probably have\r\nto return to their old quarters at the close of autumn[397].\r\n\r\n  [394] See Lord Wellesley to Lord W. Bentinck, December 27, 1811,\r\n  in Wellington’s _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. p. 249.\r\n\r\n  [395] Bentinck to Lord Liverpool, January 25, 1812, ibid., pp.\r\n  290-1.\r\n\r\n  [396] Liverpool to Bentinck, March 4. Wellington’s _Supplementary\r\n  Dispatches_, vii. p. 300.\r\n\r\n  [397] Liverpool to Wellington, March 5, ibid., p. 301.\r\n\r\nWellington, as it chanced, was already in communication with Bentinck,\r\nfor the latter had sent his brother, Lord Frederick, to Lisbon, with\r\na dispatch for the Commander-in-Chief in Portugal, in which he stated\r\nthat he leaned himself to the Corsican scheme, but that if the home\r\ngovernment disliked it, he would be prepared to send in April or May\r\nan expedition of 10,000 men to operate against Suchet[398]. The letter\r\nfrom London reached Wellington first, about March 20th[399], and was\r\na source of great joy to him, as he saw that the Cabinet intended to\r\nprohibit the Italian diversion, and wished to direct Bentinck’s men\r\ntowards Spain. He wrote to London and to Palermo, to state that a\r\ndescent upon the coast of Catalonia seemed to him ‘the most essential\r\nobject.’ It should be aimed at Barcelona or Tarragona: it might not\r\nsucceed so far as its immediate object was concerned, but it would\r\nhave the infallible result of forcing Suchet to come up with all his\r\navailable forces from Valencia, and would prevent him from interfering\r\nin the affairs of western and central Spain during the next campaign.\r\nTen thousand men, even with such aid as Lacy and the Catalan army\r\nmight give, were probably insufficient to deal with a place of such\r\nstrength as Barcelona; but Tarragona, which was weakly garrisoned,\r\nmight well be taken. Even if it were not, a great point would be gained\r\nin opening up communication with the Catalans, and throwing all the\r\naffairs of the French in eastern Spain into confusion. Bentinck was\r\nadvised in the strongest terms to land north of the Ebro, and not in\r\nValencia: an attack on Catalonia would draw Suchet out of Valencia,\r\nwhich would then fall of its own accord. Wellington added, writing\r\nto Lord Liverpool only, not to Bentinck, that he did not see how any\r\nappreciable aid could be got from the Cadiz garrison, or those of\r\nTarifa or Cartagena[400]: the British regiments there had been cut down\r\nto a necessary minimum, but there were 1,400 Portuguese and two foreign\r\nregiments, of whom some might possibly be spared. The government must\r\ngive him a definite order to detach such and such battalions, and it\r\nshould be done--the responsibility being their own. Lord Frederick\r\nBentinck arrived from Palermo at Badajoz just after that place fell:\r\nWellington charged him with additional advices for his brother, to the\r\neffect that he would send him a siege-train and officers and gunners\r\nto work it, which might serve to batter Tarragona, if that proved\r\npossible. Though he could himself spare no British troops, the Spanish\r\nRegency should be urged to lend, for an expedition to Catalonia, two\r\ndivisions, one under Roche at Alicante, the other under Whittingham\r\nin Majorca, which consisted each of 3,000 men recently entrusted\r\nfor training to those British officers. Their aid was hardly likely\r\nto be refused, and they had been better trained, fed, and clothed\r\nof late than other Spanish troops. Wellington was not deceived in\r\nthis expectation, the Regency very handsomely offered to place both\r\ndivisions at Bentinck’s disposition[401], and they turned out to have\r\nswelled in numbers of late, owing to vigorous recruiting of dispersed\r\nmen from Blake’s defunct army. The available figure was far over the\r\n6,000 of which Wellington had spoken.\r\n\r\n  [398] Bentinck to Wellington, February 23, ibid., p. 296.\r\n\r\n  [399] The answer to Lord Liverpool went off on March 20, that to\r\n  Bentinck on March 24th.\r\n\r\n  [400] Whither the 2/67th, a company of artillery, and five\r\n  companies of De Watteville’s Swiss regiment had been sent, on the\r\n  news of Blake’s disasters before Valencia. _Dispatches_, viii. p.\r\n  448.\r\n\r\n  [401] The best source of information about these subsidized\r\n  corps is the life of Sir Samford Whittingham, who raised and\r\n  disciplined one of them in Majorca, on the skeletons of the old\r\n  regiments of Cordova, Burgos, and 5th Granaderos Provinciales.\r\n  He had only 1,500 men on January 1, 1812, and 2,200 on February\r\n  21, but had worked them up to over 3,000 by April. Roche, who\r\n  had to work on the cadres of Canarias, Alicante, Chinchilla,\r\n  Voluntarios de Aragon, 2nd of Murcia, and Corona, had 5,500 men\r\n  ready on March 1, and more by May. Whittingham maintains that his\r\n  battalions always did their duty far better than other divisions,\r\n  commanded by officers with unhappy traditions of defeat, and\r\n  attributes the previous miserable history of the Murcian army to\r\n  incapacity and poor spirit in high places.\r\n\r\nThere seemed, therefore, in May to be every probability that a force of\r\nsome 17,000 men might be available for the descent on Catalonia which\r\nWellington advised: and both Admiral Pellew and Roche and Whittingham\r\nmade active preparations to be found in perfect readiness when Lord\r\nWilliam Bentinck should start off the nucleus of the expeditionary\r\nforce from Palermo[402]. Wellington had fixed the third week in June\r\nas the date at which the appearance of the diversion would be most\r\neffective[403]. On June 5th he was able to state that two separate\r\ndivisions of transports had already been sent off from Lisbon, one to\r\nAlicante and one to Majorca, to pick up the two Spanish divisions.\r\n\r\n  [402] Henry Wellesley to Wellington. _Supplementary Dispatches_,\r\n  vii. p. 320.\r\n\r\n  [403] See as evidence of eagerness Whittingham’s letter to Pellew\r\n  of May 28 in the former’s _Memoirs_, p. 161.\r\n\r\nNow, however, came a deplorable check to the plan, which only became\r\nknown to Wellington when he had already committed himself to his\r\ncampaign against Marmont. Bentinck could never get out of his head the\r\noriginal idea of Italian conquest which he had laid before the Cabinet\r\nin January. There was no doubt that it had been discouraged by the\r\nhome government, and that he had received very distinct instructions\r\nthat Spain was to be the sphere of his activity, and that he was to\r\ntake Wellington into his councils. But Lord Liverpool’s dispatch had\r\ncontained the unfortunate phrase that ‘unless the project of resistance\r\nto the French power in Italy should appear to rest upon much better\r\ngrounds than those of which we are at present apprised,’ the diversion\r\nto Catalonia was the obvious course[404].’ This gave a discretionary\r\npower to Bentinck, if he should judge that evidence of discontent in\r\nItaly had cropped up in unexpected quantity and quality since March.\r\nIt does not appear, to the unprejudiced observer, that such evidence\r\nwas forthcoming in May. But Bentinck, with his original prejudice\r\nin favour of a descent on Italy running in his brain, chose to take\r\ncertain secret correspondence received from the Austrian general\r\nNugent, and other sources, as justification for holding back from\r\nthe immediate action in eastern Spain, on which Wellington had been\r\nled to rely. No troops sailed from Palermo or Messina till the very\r\nend of June, and then the numbers sent were much less than had been\r\npromised, and the directions given to Maitland, the general entrusted\r\nwith the command, were by no means satisfactory[405]. The underlying\r\nfact would appear to be that, since March, Bentinck had begun to be\r\nalarmed at the intrigues of the Queen of Sicily, and feared to send\r\naway British troops so far afield as Spain. That notorious princess and\r\nher incapable spouse had been deprived in the preceding autumn of their\r\nancient status as absolute sovereigns, and a Sicilian constitution and\r\nparliament, somewhat on the British model, had been called into being.\r\nFor some time it had been supposed that Caroline, though incensed,\r\nwas powerless to do harm, and the native Sicilians were undoubtedly\r\ngratified by the change. But Bentinck presently detected traces of a\r\nconspiracy fostered by the Queen among the Italian and mercenary troops\r\nemployed by the Sicilian government: and, what was more surprising,\r\nit was suspected (and proved later on) that the court had actually\r\nopened up negotiations with Napoleon and even with Murat, in order\r\nto get rid of the English from Sicily at all costs[406]. In view of\r\nthe fact that there were 8,000 Italian and foreign troops of doubtful\r\ndisposition quartered in Sicily, Bentinck was seized with qualms\r\nat the idea of sending away a large expedition, mainly composed of\r\nBritish regiments. In the end he compromised, by detaching only three\r\nBritish and two German Legion battalions, along with a miscellaneous\r\ncollection of fractions of several foreign corps, making 7,000 men in\r\nall[407]. They only arrived off the coast of Catalonia on July 31st,\r\nand Maitland’s freedom of operations was hampered by instructions to\r\nthe effect that ‘the division of the Sicilian army detached has for\r\nits first object the safety of Sicily; its employment on the Spanish\r\ncoast is temporary.’ He was told that he was liable to be withdrawn at\r\nany moment, if complications arose in Sicily or Italy, and was not to\r\nconsider himself a permanent part of the British army in Spain. Yet at\r\nthe same time that Bentinck had given these orders, the home government\r\nhad told Wellington to regard the expeditionary force as placed at his\r\ndisposal, and authorized him to send directions to it.\r\n\r\n  [404] Liverpool to Bentinck, 4th March, quoted above.\r\n\r\n  [405] See Wellington to Lord W. Bentinck in _Dispatches_, ix. pp.\r\n  60-1.\r\n\r\n  [406] That veritable ‘stormy petrel of politics,’ Sir Robert\r\n  Wilson, was passing through Sicily in May, and seems to have\r\n  acted a mischievous part in visiting the Queen, and allowing her\r\n  to set before him all her grievances against Bentinck, and the\r\n  ‘Jacobin Parliament’ that he was setting up. She told Wilson that\r\n  Bentinck ‘went to jails and took evidence of miserable wretches,\r\n  actual malefactors or suspects, inducing them to say what he\r\n  wished for his plans, and acting without any substantiating\r\n  facts.’ As to the army Wilson gathered that ‘the Neapolitan\r\n  soldiery hate us to a man, the Germans would adhere to us, the\r\n  native Sicilians at least not act against us.’ But there were\r\n  only 2,000 Sicilians and 1,900 Germans, and 8,000 Neapolitans\r\n  and other Italians, eminently untrustworthy. [So untrustworthy\r\n  were they, indeed, that the Italian corps sent to Spain in the\r\n  autumn deserted by hundreds to the French.] See Wilson’s _Private\r\n  Diary_, 1812-15, pp. 35-62.\r\n\r\n  [407] For details, see table in Appendix no. XIII.\r\n\r\nAll this worked out less unhappily than might have been expected; for\r\nthough Wellington got little practical military help from the Sicilian\r\ncorps, and though Maitland’s operations were most disappointing and\r\nstarted far too late, yet the knowledge that great transport squadrons\r\nwere at Alicante and Majorca, and the rumour that a large force was\r\ncoming from Sicily, most certainly kept Suchet in a state of alarm,\r\nand prevented him from helping Soult or King Joseph. It is interesting\r\nto find from his correspondence[408] that in the earliest days of\r\nJuly he was anxiously watching the ships at Alicante, and expecting a\r\ndescent either on Valencia or on Catalonia, though Maitland was yet\r\nfar away, and did not appear off Palamos till July 31. The fear of\r\nthe descent was an admirable help to Wellington--perhaps more useful\r\nthan its actual appearance at an early date might have been, since the\r\nexpeditionary troops were decidedly less in numbers than Wellington\r\nhad hoped or Suchet had feared. At the same time the news that the\r\nSicilian force had not sailed, and perhaps might never appear, reached\r\nSalamanca at one of the most critical moments of the campaign, and\r\nfilled Wellington with fears that the Army of Valencia might already be\r\ndetaching troops against him, while he had calculated upon its being\r\nentirely distracted by the projected demonstration[409]. The news that\r\nMaitland had sailed at last, only came to hand some time after the\r\nbattle of Salamanca had been won, when the whole position in Spain had\r\nassumed a new and more satisfactory aspect.\r\n\r\n  [408] Suchet’s correspondence (in the Archives of the French War\r\n  Ministry) begins to be anxious from July 6 onward. On that date\r\n  he hears that ships are at Alicante to take Roche on board, who\r\n  is to join a very large English force, and 15,000 (!) men from\r\n  Majorca. On July 13th he hears that Maitland is to have 17,000\r\n  men, though only 3,000 British regulars.\r\n\r\n  [409] Wellington to Lord Bathurst, July 14: ‘I have this day\r\n  received a letter from Lord W. Bentinck of the 9th of June, from\r\n  which I am concerned to observe that his Lordship does not intend\r\n  to carry into execution the operation on the east coast of the\r\n  Peninsula, until he shall have tried the success of another plan\r\n  on the coast of Italy. I am apprehensive that this determination\r\n  may bring upon us additional forces of the Army of Aragon:\r\n  but I still hope that I shall be able to retain at the close\r\n  of this campaign the acquisitions made at its commencement.’\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 285.\r\n\r\nSuch were the subsidiary schemes with which Wellington supported his\r\nmain design of a direct advance against Marmont’s army. Some of them\r\nworked well--Hill, Home Popham, and Mendizabal did all, and more than\r\nall, that had been expected of them, in the way of containing large\r\nFrench forces. Others accomplished all that could in reason have been\r\nhoped--such was the case with Silveira and Ballasteros. Others fell far\r\nbelow the amount of usefulness that had been reckoned upon--both the\r\nGalician army and the Sicilian army proved most disappointing in the\r\ntiming of their movements and the sum of their achievements. But on the\r\nwhole the plan worked--the French generals in all parts of Spain were\r\ndistracted, and Marmont got little help from without.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, at the moment of Wellington’s starting on his\r\noffensive campaign, the thing that gave him most trouble and anxiety\r\nwas not the timing or efficacy of the various diversions that he had\r\nplanned, but a purely financial problem. It was now a matter of years\r\nsince the money due for the pay and maintenance of the army had been\r\ncoming in with terrible unpunctuality. Officers and men had grown to\r\nregard it as normal that their pay should be four or six months in\r\narrears: the muleteers and camp followers were in even worse case. And\r\nthe orders for payment (_vales_ as they were called) issued by the\r\ncommissariat to the peasantry, were so tardily settled in cash, that\r\nthe recipients would often sell them for half or two-thirds of their\r\nface value to speculators in Lisbon, who could afford to wait many\r\nmonths for the money.\r\n\r\nThis state of things was deplorable: but it did not proceed, as Napier\r\nusually hints, and as Wellington himself seems sometimes to have felt,\r\nfrom perversity on the part of the home government. It was not the case\r\nthat there was gold or silver in London, and that the ministers did\r\nnot send it with sufficient promptness. No one can be so simple as to\r\nsuppose that Lord Liverpool, Mr. Perceval, the Marquess of Wellesley,\r\nor Lord Castlereagh, did not understand that the Army of Portugal must\r\nhave cash, or it would lose that mobility which was its great strength.\r\nStill less would they wittingly starve it, when the fortunes of the\r\nministry were bound up with the successful conduct of the war.\r\n\r\nBut the years 1811-12, as has been already pointed out in the last\r\nvolume of this work, were those of the greatest stringency in the\r\ncash-market of Great Britain. The country was absolutely drained dry\r\nof metallic currency in the precious metals: no silver had been coined\r\nat the Mint since the Revolutionary war began: no guineas since 1798.\r\nEngland was transacting all her internal business on bank-notes, and\r\ngold was a rare commodity, only to be got by high prices and much\r\nsearching. This was the time when the Jews of Portsmouth used to\r\nboard every home-coming transport, to offer convalescents or sailors\r\n27_s._, or even more, in paper for every guinea that they had on\r\nthem. The Spanish dollar, though weighing much less than an English\r\nfive-shilling piece (when that valuable antiquity could be found[410]),\r\nreadily passed for six shillings in paper. And even this coin could\r\nnot now be got so easily as in 1809 or 1810, for the growing state of\r\ndisturbance in the Spanish-American colonies was beginning to affect\r\nthe annual import of silver from the mines of Mexico and Peru, which\r\nhad for a long time been the main source from which bullion for Europe\r\nwas procured. To buy dollars at Cadiz with bills on London was becoming\r\na much more difficult business. In May 1812 a special complication\r\nwas introduced--Lord William Bentinck wishing to provide Spanish coin\r\nfor the expedition which was about to sail for Catalonia, sent agents\r\nto Gibraltar, who bought with Sicilian gold all the dollars that\r\nthey could procure, giving a reckless price for them, equivalent to\r\nover six shillings a dollar, and competing with Wellington’s regular\r\ncorrespondents who were at the same moment offering only 5_s._ 4_d._\r\nor 5_s._ 6_d._ for the coin. Of course the higher offer secured the\r\ncash, and Wellington made bitter complaints that the market had been\r\nspoilt, and that he suddenly found himself shut out from a supply on\r\nwhich he had hitherto reckoned with security[411]. But the competition\r\nwas only transient, though very tiresome at a moment when silver coin\r\nwas specially wanted for payments in Leon. For, as Wellington remarked,\r\nthe people about Salamanca had never seen the British army before,\r\nand would be wanting to do business on a prompt cash basis, not being\r\naccustomed to credit, as were the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n  [410] No silver crowns had been coined since 1760 at the Mint.\r\n  They weighed 463 grains: the Spanish dollar only 415 grains.\r\n\r\n  [411] See Wellington to Lord Bathurst. _Dispatches_, vii. p. 370.\r\n\r\nThe army started upon the campaign with a military chest in the most\r\ndeplorable state of depletion. ‘We are absolutely bankrupt,’ wrote\r\nWellington, ‘the troops are now five months in arrears instead of one\r\nmonth in advance. The staff have not been paid since February; the\r\nmuleteers not since June 1811! and we are in debt in all parts of\r\nthe country. I am obliged to take money sent me by my brother [Henry\r\nWellesley, British Minister at Cadiz] for the Spaniards, in order to\r\ngive my own troops a fortnight’s pay, who are really suffering for want\r\nof money[412].’ Some weeks before this last complaint Wellington had\r\nsounded an even louder note of alarm. ‘We owe not less than 5,000,000\r\ndollars. The Portuguese troops and establishments are likewise in the\r\ngreatest distress, and it is my opinion, as well as that of Marshal\r\nBeresford, that we must disband part of that army, unless I can\r\nincrease the monthly payments of the subsidy. The Commissary-General\r\nhas this day informed me that he is very apprehensive that he will not\r\nbe able to make good his engagements for the payment for the meat for\r\nthe troops. If we are obliged to stop that payment, your Lordship may\r\nas well prepare to recall the army, for it will be impossible to carry\r\nup salt meat (as well as bread) to the troops from the sea-coast....\r\nIt is not improbable that we may not be able to take advantage of\r\nthe enemy’s comparative weakness in this campaign _for sheer want of\r\nmoney_[413].’ One almost feels that Wellington is here painting the\r\nposition of the army in the blackest possible colours, in order to\r\nbring pressure on his correspondent at home. But this dismal picture\r\nwas certainly reflected in the language of his staff at the time: a\r\nletter from his aide-de-camp, Colin Campbell, speaks (on May 30) of\r\nthe depleted state of the military chest being a possible curb to the\r\ncampaign: ‘Lord W. cannot take supplies with him to enable him to do\r\nmore than demonstrate towards Valladolid, when so good an opportunity\r\noffers, and an inconsiderable addition would suffice. The harvest\r\nis ripening, the country round Salamanca is full of all requisite\r\nsupplies, but they are not procurable without cash[414].’\r\n\r\n  [412] Ibid., vii. p. 319.\r\n\r\n  [413] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, April 22. _Supplementary\r\n  Dispatches_, vii. p. 318.\r\n\r\n  [414] Campbell to Shawe. _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. p. 362.\r\n\r\nYet it is hard to be over-censorious of the home government. They were\r\nin the most bitter straits for money. Gold and silver were simply\r\nnot to be got in the quantities that Wellington required. The amount\r\nactually sent was very large: it would have been larger if economic\r\nconditions had not been desperate. The rupture with the United States\r\nof America which took place in June (fortunately too late to serve\r\nNapoleon’s purpose), had just added a new source of anxiety to the\r\ntroubles of the Cabinet: both money and men were now wanted for Canada.\r\nThere can be no doubt that when Lord Bathurst wrote, in the middle\r\nof the Salamanca campaign, that ‘£100,000 in cash, chiefly gold, had\r\nbeen sent off,’ and that ‘I wish to God we could assist you more in\r\nmoney,’ he was writing quite honestly, and amid most adverse financial\r\ncircumstances. Great Britain was at the most exhausting point of her\r\nlong struggle with Napoleon. The Russian war had begun--but there\r\nwas no sign as yet that it was to be the ruin of the Emperor: his\r\narmies seemed to be penetrating towards Moscow in the old triumphant\r\nstyle: many politicians spoke of a humiliating peace dictated to Czar\r\nAlexander in the autumn as the probable end of the campaign, and\r\nspeculated on Napoleon’s appearance at Madrid in 1813 as a possible\r\nevent. Wheat had risen in this spring to 130_s._ the quarter. The\r\noutbreak of the long-threatened but long-averted American war looked\r\nlike the last blow that was to break down the British Empire. It was no\r\nwonder that the national credit was low in June 1812. There was nothing\r\nto revive it till Wellington’s Salamanca triumph in July: nor did any\r\none understand that Napoleon’s star had passed its zenith, till the\r\nnews of the disasters of the Moscow retreat began to drift westward in\r\nNovember and December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRAL SPAIN]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, if the financial outlook was gloomy, the actual military\r\nsituation was more promising than it had ever been before. Well aware,\r\nfrom intercepted dispatches, of the quarrels of his adversaries,\r\nand perfectly informed as to their numbers and their cantonments,\r\nWellington considered with justice that he had such a game in his hands\r\nas he had never before had set before him. On June 13th he crossed\r\nthe Agueda with his army in three parallel columns. The left was\r\nunder charge of Picton, and consisted of the 3rd Division, Pack’s and\r\nBradford’s Portuguese, and Le Marchant’s brigade of heavy dragoons.\r\nThe centre, which Beresford conducted, was composed of the Light, 4th,\r\nand 5th Divisions. It was preceded by Alten’s German hussars, and\r\naccompanied by Bock’s dragoons. The right column, under Graham, had\r\nthe 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, with a regiment of Anson’s horse for\r\npurposes of exploration. It is to be noted that both Picton and Graham\r\nwere destined to remain only a few weeks with the army: the former had\r\ntaken the field ere his Badajoz wound was properly healed: it broke\r\nopen again, he fell into a high fever, and had to be sent to the rear.\r\nWellington’s brother-in-law, Pakenham, took over charge of the 3rd\r\nDivision on June 28th. Graham had been suffering for some months from\r\nan affection of the eyes, which the physicians told him might at any\r\ntime grow worse and threaten his sight. He persisted on staying with\r\nthe army till the last possible moment, but became more blind each day,\r\nand was compelled to throw up his command on July 6th and to return to\r\nEngland for skilled medical advice. Thus, during the greater part of\r\nthe Salamanca campaign, Wellington was working without his best-trusted\r\nlieutenants--Craufurd was dead, both Picton and Graham invalided. In\r\nconsequence of Graham’s departure a very difficult point was raised.\r\nIf some illness or wound should disable the Commander-in-Chief, to\r\nwhom would the charge of operations fall[415]? Wellington considered\r\nthat Beresford was entitled to expect the succession, and deprecated\r\nthe sending out of some senior officer from England with a commission\r\nto act as second in command. He observed that no one coming fresh from\r\nhome would have a real grasp of the conditions of the war: that he\r\nwould probably start with _a priori_ views, and have to unlearn them\r\nin a time of imminent danger. Moreover, a second-in-command was, when\r\nhis superior was in good health, either an unnecessary person or else\r\na tiresome one, if he presumed on his position to offer advice or\r\nremonstrances. Fortunately the question remained a wholly academic one,\r\nsince Wellington’s iron physique, and unbroken luck when bullets were\r\nflying, never failed him. An understudy turned out to be superfluous.\r\n\r\n  [415] Wellington to Bathurst. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 277.\r\n\r\nThe three columns of the allied army advanced on a very narrow front of\r\nnot more than ten miles, though the cavalry spread out considerably to\r\nthe flanks. On the 13th the columns bivouacked on the Guadapero river,\r\nin front of Ciudad Rodrigo, between Santi Espiritus and Tenebron. On\r\nthe 14th they advanced four leagues to the Huebra, and camped on each\r\nside of San Muñoz, with head-quarters at Cabrillas. On the 15th a\r\nrather longer march took them to Matilla and Cayos. Nothing had yet\r\nbeen seen of any enemy. It was only on the 16th, in the morning, that\r\nthe advanced cavalry of the centre column, after crossing the Valmusa\r\nriver, came into contact with two squadrons of French _chasseurs_, not\r\nmore than two leagues outside of Salamanca. These outposts gave way\r\nwhen pushed, and retired across the Tormes. The British army bivouacked\r\nin sight of Salamanca that night, and received the information that\r\nMarmont had already evacuated the city, save for a garrison left in its\r\nthree new forts[416].\r\n\r\n  [416] The itinerary of this march in detail may be found in the\r\n  excellent Diary of Tomkinson of the 16th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\nThe Army of Portugal had been caught, just as Wellington had hoped,\r\nin a condition of wide dispersion. It was not that Marmont did not\r\nexpect the attack, but that, till the day when it should be actually\r\ndelivered, he dared not concentrate, because of his want of magazines\r\nand the paucity of transport. He had resolved that he must be content\r\nto abandon all the land west of Salamanca, in order that his point of\r\nconcentration should be out of reach of his enemy’s first stroke. It\r\nwas fixed at Bleines and Fuente Sauco, twenty miles north of Salamanca\r\non the road to Toro. On the morning of the 14th, when the news that\r\nWellington was over the Agueda first reached him, the Marshal issued\r\norders to all his divisions to march on this point, not even excepting\r\nthat of Bonnet in the Asturias. For, despite of the Emperor’s wish to\r\nkeep a hold upon that province, Marmont held, and rightly, that it\r\nwas more important to place in front of the Anglo-Portuguese every\r\npossible bayonet, and he could not spare a solid division of 6,500\r\nmen. Unfortunately for him, however, it was clear that Bonnet could\r\nnot arrive for fifteen or twenty days. The other seven divisions were\r\nconcentrated by the fifth night from the giving of the alarm[417]. They\r\nformed a mass of 36,000 infantry, with 80 guns, but only 2,800 horse.\r\nThis total does not include either Bonnet, nor three battalions of\r\nThomières’s division left to hold Astorga, nor small garrisons placed\r\nin Toro, Zamora, the Salamanca forts, and certain other posts farther\r\neast[418]. Nor does it take account of a dépôt of 3,000 men, including\r\nmany dismounted dragoons, at Valladolid. The total of the field army,\r\nincluding artillery, sappers, &c., was about 40,000 of all arms.\r\n\r\n  [417] Foy, who had been drawn away from the Tagus after the\r\n  affair at Almaraz, had to march from Avila, Clausel from\r\n  Peñaranda, Ferey from Valladolid, Sarrut from Toro, Maucune and\r\n  Brennier had been at Salamanca, Thomières came from Zamora.\r\n  Boyer’s dragoons were at Toro and Benavente, Curto’s light\r\n  cavalry division had been with Maucune and Brennier at Salamanca.\r\n  Valladolid, Avila, and Benavente were the most distant points:\r\n  but the troops from them were all up by the 19th. Nor was it\r\n  possible for Wellington to interfere with the concentration,\r\n  though possibly he might have forced Foy from Avila to make a\r\n  détour, if he had followed Marmont very close.\r\n\r\n  [418] Nor do we reckon the regiment of Sarrut’s division (130th)\r\n  permanently detached at Santander.\r\n\r\nThis force was distinctly inferior in number to that of the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese, who, without counting three infantry battalions on\r\ntheir way to the front from Lisbon, or D’Urban’s Portuguese horse\r\non the side of Zamora, had some 40,000 infantry in line, and 3,500\r\nexcellent cavalry, in which arm Wellington, for the first time in his\r\nlife, had a slight advantage over the enemy. Carlos de España was also\r\napproaching, with the 3,000 Spanish infantry that were available after\r\nthe garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo had been completed, and in all the\r\nallied army must have had 48,000 men at the front[419]. The balance\r\nof numbers, of which each general was pretty well informed, was such\r\nas to make both sides careful--Marmont was 8,000 men short of his\r\nadversary’s power, and was particularly depressed by the knowledge of\r\nhis inferiority in cavalry, an arm on which the French had hitherto\r\nrelied with confidence. But the horse of the Army of Portugal had\r\nnever recovered from the consequences of Masséna’s retreat in the last\r\nspring, and all the regiments were very weak: while Wellington was\r\nat last profiting from the liberal way in which the home government\r\nhad reinforced his mounted arm during the autumn of 1811. He had ten\r\nBritish regiments with him, whereas at Fuentes de Oñoro he had owned\r\nbut four.\r\n\r\n  [419] See tables of the armies of both sides in the Appendix no.\r\n  IX.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Wellington, among his 48,000 men, had only 28,000\r\nBritish; there were 17,000 Portuguese and 3,000 Spaniards with him, and\r\nexcellent though the conduct of the former had been during the late\r\ncampaign, it would be hypocrisy to pretend that their commander could\r\nrely upon them under all circumstances, as he would have done upon a\r\ncorresponding number of British infantry. He was ready to give battle,\r\nbut it must be a battle under favourable conditions. Marmont felt much\r\nthe same: it was necessary to beat Wellington if the French domination\r\nin Spain was to be preserved. But it would be rash to attack him\r\nin one of his favourite defensive positions: there must be no more\r\nBussacos. And every available man must be gathered in, before a general\r\naction was risked. The only justification for instant battle would be\r\nthe unlikely chance of catching the Anglo-Portuguese army in a state\r\nof dispersion or some other unlucky posture--and Wellington’s known\r\ncaution did not make such a chance very probable.\r\n\r\nMarmont’s main purpose, indeed, was to hold Wellington ‘contained’ till\r\nhe should have succeeded in bringing up Bonnet, and also reinforcements\r\nfrom the Armies of the North and Centre--if not even from some distant\r\nforces. On Bonnet’s eventual arrival he could rely--but not on any\r\nfixed date for his appearance, for it was difficult to get orders\r\npromptly to the Asturias, and there might be many unforeseen delays in\r\ntheir execution. But Marmont was also counting on aid from Caffarelli,\r\nwhich would presumably reach him even before Bonnet appeared. In\r\nexpectation of Wellington’s advance, he had written to the Commander\r\nof the Army of the North on May 24th and 30th, and again on June\r\n5th, asking for assurances of help, and reminding his colleague of\r\nthe Emperor’s directions. The answers received were, on the whole,\r\nsatisfactory: the last of them, dated at Vittoria on June 14th, said\r\nthat the disposable field-force was 8,000 men, including a brigade of\r\nlight cavalry and 22 guns. They should march from Vittoria as soon\r\nas some troops of Abbé’s division arrived from Pampeluna to replace\r\nthem, and they should be écheloned along the high-road from Burgos\r\nto Valladolid ready to move up when called upon[420]. It must be\r\nremembered that on this date Caffarelli was answering a hypothetical\r\ninquiry as to his exact power to help, not a definite demand for men,\r\nsince Wellington had only crossed the Agueda on the previous day, and\r\nnothing was known at Vittoria of his actual start. But the dispatch was\r\nencouraging, as it seemed to show a good spirit, and named the exact\r\nforce available, and the route that it would take. Marmont received\r\nit upon the 19th, just as he had completed his own concentration at\r\nFuente Sauco. It seemed to justify him in believing that before July 1\r\nhe would have 8,000 men from Caffarelli at his disposition, including,\r\nwhat was specially valuable, 1,000 horse.\r\n\r\n  [420] See Caffarelli to Marmont of June 10 and June 14th in\r\n  Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 408-10.\r\n\r\nThe dispatches from King Joseph and Jourdan were less satisfactory. At\r\nthis moment they were in a state of hesitation caused by contradictory\r\nintelligence. ‘Your letter of June 6th,’ wrote Jourdan to Marmont,\r\n‘says that Wellington will soon fall upon you. But we have similar\r\nletters from Soult, declaring that the blow is to be delivered against\r\nhim: he encloses two notes of June 2nd and 5th from General Daricau\r\nin Estremadura, declaring that 60,000 of the allies are just about\r\nto begin an invasion of Andalusia. We are too far off from the scene\r\nof operations to determine whether it is you or the Duke of Dalmatia\r\nwho is deceived. We can only tell you, meanwhile, not to be misled by\r\ndemonstrations, and to be ready to start off three divisions to Soult’s\r\nhelp without a moment’s delay, if Lord Wellington’s real objective is\r\nAndalusia. Similarly we have sent Soult express orders that he shall\r\nmove Drouet to the north bank of the Tagus, if Wellington has called up\r\nHill to join him, and is making the true attack on you. Caffarelli has\r\nstringent orders to support you with what troops he can collect, when\r\nyou are able to tell him definitely that you are the person threatened,\r\nnot Soult[421].’\r\n\r\n  [421] Jourdan to Marmont, June 14th, in _Mémoires_, iv. pp.\r\n  411-12.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the hallucinations of the Duke of Dalmatia were most\r\nvaluable to Wellington, who had foreseen them long ago by a study of\r\nintercepted dispatches. Whatever happened, Soult could not refrain from\r\nbelieving that he had the great rôle to play, and that his Andalusian\r\nviceroyalty was the centre of all things. At this moment his picture\r\nof Wellington about to move on Cordova with 60,000 men seems to have\r\nbeen a belated conception caused by Graham’s march to Elvas on May 20.\r\nHe had not yet realized that ten days later Graham’s corps had gone\r\nnorthward again, and had joined Wellington on the Agueda about the\r\ntime that he was writing his alarmist letters. There was nothing in\r\nfront of him save Hill’s 18,000 men: but he refused to see the facts,\r\nand deceived Joseph and Jourdan for some days by the definite and\r\nauthoritative restatement of absolutely erroneous intelligence. Hence\r\nit was not till Marmont was able to say, without any possible chance\r\nof error, that Wellington was across the Agueda, and had advanced to\r\nSalamanca at the head of at least 40,000 men, that the King and his\r\nChief-of-the-Staff at last recognized the true seat of danger. Long\r\nafter they had detected it, they continued (as we shall see) to receive\r\npreposterous dispatches from Soult, still maintaining that they were\r\nmistaken, and still discovering excuses for not obeying the peremptory\r\norders that they sent him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SALAMANCA FORTS. TEN DAYS OF MANŒUVRES, JUNE 20TH-30TH, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nWellington’s conduct on reaching Salamanca was not that which might\r\nhave been expected. When a general has, by a careful and well-arranged\r\nconcentration, collected all his own troops into one solid mass, and\r\nthen by a rapid advance has thrown himself into the midst of the\r\nscattered cantonments of an enemy who has no superiority to him in\r\nnumbers, it is natural for him to press his pursuit vigorously. Far the\r\nmost effective way of opening the campaign would have been to cut up\r\nthe two divisions which Marmont had just led out of Salamanca, or at\r\nleast to follow them so closely that they could be brought to action\r\nbefore all the outlying divisions had come in. This would certainly\r\nhave been Napoleon’s method.\r\n\r\nWellington, however, wanted to fight a battle in one of his favourite\r\ndefensive positions, and he thought that he had a means of compelling\r\nMarmont to attack him, by laying siege to the Salamanca forts. After\r\nCiudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, no French marshal would like to see a\r\nthird important post captured ‘under his nose.’ The British general\r\njudged that Marmont would fight him, in order to save his prestige and\r\nhis garrison. And since he believed that Bonnet would not evacuate\r\nthe Asturias, and that Caffarelli would send help late, if at all,\r\nhe thought that he could count upon a superiority of numbers which\r\nrendered victory certain.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the only rational way of explaining Wellington’s\r\nconduct on June 17th. On arriving in front of Salamanca his army made\r\na majestic encircling movement, Picton’s column crossing the Tormes\r\nby the fords of El Canto below the city, Beresford’s and Graham’s by\r\nthose of Santa Marta above it. The use of the unbroken town-bridge was\r\nmade impossible by Marmont’s forts. The heads of the two columns met\r\non the north side, and they then moved three miles on, and took up a\r\nlong position below the heights of San Cristobal, which lie outside\r\nSalamanca on its northern and eastern front. These formed the chosen\r\ndefensive fighting-ground which Wellington had already in his mind.\r\n\r\nOnly the 14th Light Dragoons and Clinton’s infantry of the 6th Division\r\nturned into Salamanca by the Toro gate, and acted as Wellington’s\r\nescort, while he was received by the municipality and made his\r\narrangements for the attack on the forts, which, though they commanded\r\nthe bridge, had no outlook on the spacious arcaded Plaza Mayor, where\r\nthe reception took place. It was a lively scene. ‘We were received with\r\nshouts and _vivas_,’ writes an eye-witness. ‘The inhabitants were out\r\nof their senses at having got rid of the French, and nearly pulled Lord\r\nWellington off his horse. The ladies were the most violent, many coming\r\nup to him and embracing him. He kept writing orders upon his sabretash,\r\nand was interrupted three or four times by them. What with the joy\r\nof the people, and the feeling accompanying troops about to attack a\r\nfortress, it was a half-hour of suspense and anxiety, and a scene of\r\nsuch interest as I never before witnessed[422].’\r\n\r\n  [422] Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 162.\r\n\r\nHead-quarters were established that night in the city, and Clinton’s\r\ndivision invested the forts, which looked formidable enough to require\r\nclose study before they were attacked. The rest of the army took up\r\nits bivouacs, with the cavalry out in front, and remained practically\r\nwithout movement on the ground now selected, for the next two days,\r\ntill Marmont came to pay his expected visit.\r\n\r\nThe three Salamanca forts were built on high ground in the south-west\r\ncorner of the city, which overlooks the long Roman bridge. To make\r\nthem Marmont had destroyed a great part of the old University quarter\r\nof the place, levelling the majority of the colleges--for Salamanca,\r\ntill 1808, had been a university of the English rather than the usual\r\ncontinental type, and had owned a score of such institutions. Nearly\r\nall the buildings on the slopes had been pulled down, leaving a wide\r\nopen glacis round three massive convents, which had been transformed\r\ninto places of strength. San Vincente occupied the crest of the knoll\r\noverlooking the river, and lay in the extreme angle of the old city\r\nwall, which enclosed it on two sides. The smaller strongholds, San\r\nCayetano and La Merced, were separated from San Vincente by a narrow\r\nbut steep ravine, and lay close together on another rising-ground of\r\nabout the same height. The three formed a triangle with crossing fires,\r\neach to a large extent commanding the ground over which the others\r\nwould have to be approached. The south and west sides of San Vincente\r\nand La Merced overhung precipitous slopes above the river, and were\r\nalmost inaccessible. The north sides of San Cayetano and San Vincente\r\nwere the only fronts that looked promising for attack, and in each\r\nelaborate preparations had been made in view of that fact. Marmont\r\nhad originally intended to enclose all three forts and many buildings\r\nmore--such as the Town Hospital, the convent of San Francisco, and the\r\ncolleges of Ireland and Cuenca, in an outer _enceinte_, to serve as\r\na large citadel which would contain several thousand men and all his\r\nmagazines. But money and time had failed, and on the slopes below the\r\nforts, several convents and colleges, half pulled to pieces, were still\r\nstanding, and offered cover for besiegers at a distance of some 250\r\nyards from the works. The garrison consisted of six flank-companies\r\nfrom the 15th, 65th, 82nd, and 86th of the line and the 17th Léger,\r\nand of a company of artillery, under the _chef de bataillon_ Duchemin\r\nof the 65th. They made up a total of 800 men, and had thirty-six guns\r\nin position, of which, however, the greater part were only light\r\nfield-pieces: two guns (commanding the bridge) were in La Merced,\r\nfour in San Cayetano, the remaining thirty in San Vincente, the most\r\nformidable of the three.\r\n\r\nWellington had come prepared to besiege ‘three fortified convents,’\r\nand had been sent a confused sketch of them drawn by an amateur’s\r\nhand[423]. They turned out much stronger than he had been led to\r\nexpect, owing to the immense amount of hewn stone from the demolished\r\ncolleges and other buildings that was available to build them up. The\r\nwalls had been doubled in thickness, the windows stopped, and scarps\r\nand counterscarps with solid masonry had been thrown around them. The\r\nroofs of the two minor forts had been taken off, and the upper stories\r\ncasemated, by massive oak beams with a thick coating of earth laid\r\nupon them. This surface was so strong that guns, protected by sandbag\r\nembrasures, had been mounted on it at some points. There was also an\r\nample provision of palisades, made from strong oak and chestnut beams.\r\nAltogether it was clear that the works would require a systematic\r\nbattering, and were not mere patched-up mediaeval monasteries, as had\r\nbeen expected.\r\n\r\n  [423] Jones, _Sieges_, i. p. 269.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, most vexatious to find that the very small\r\nbattering-train which Wellington had brought with him from Ciudad\r\nRodrigo was obviously insufficient for the task before it; there were\r\nno more than four iron 18-pounder guns, with only 100 rounds of shot\r\neach, at the front; though six 24-pound howitzers, from the train that\r\nhad taken Badajoz, were on their way from Elvas to join, and were due\r\non the 20th. It was not, however, howitzers so much as more heavy 18-or\r\n24-pounders that were required for battering, and the lack of them at\r\nthe moment was made all the more irksome by the known fact that there\r\nwere plenty of both sorts at Rodrigo and Almeida, five or six marches\r\naway. The mistake was precisely the same that was to be made again at\r\nBurgos in the autumn--undervaluation of the means required to deal\r\nwith works of third-class importance. Whether Wellington himself or\r\nhis artillery and engineer advisers were primarily responsible is not\r\nclear[424].\r\n\r\n  [424] At any rate Dickson was not, as he was with the howitzers\r\n  that were coming up from Elvas, and had not started from Rodrigo\r\n  with the army.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the working out of the little siege with\r\ninadequate means fell on Lieut.-Colonel Burgoyne, as senior engineer\r\n(he had with him only two other officers of that corps and nine\r\nmilitary artificers!), and Lieut.-Colonel May, R.A., who was in charge\r\nof the four 18-pounders. The latter borrowed three howitzers from\r\nfield-batteries to supplement his miserable means, and afterwards two\r\n6-pounder field-guns, which, of course, were only for annoying the\r\ngarrison, not for battering.\r\n\r\nIt looked at first as if the only practicable scheme was to build a\r\nbattery for the 18-pounders on the nearest available ground, 250 yards\r\nfrom San Vincente to the north, and lower down the knoll on which\r\nthat fort stood. There was good cover from ruined buildings up to\r\nthis distance from the French works. On the night of the occupation\r\nof Salamanca 400 workmen of the 6th Division commenced a battery on\r\nthe selected spot and approaches leading to it from the cover in the\r\nruins. The work done was not satisfactory: it was nearly full moon,\r\nthe night was short, and the enemy (who knew well enough where the\r\nattack must begin), kept up a lively fire of artillery and musketry\r\nall night. Unfortunately the 6th Division workmen had no experience\r\nof sieges--they had never used pick or shovel before, and there were\r\nonly two engineer officers and nine artificers to instruct them. ‘Great\r\ndifficulty was found in keeping the men to work under the fire: the\r\nPortuguese in particular absolutely went on hands and knees, dragging\r\ntheir baskets along the ground[425].’ By daylight the projected line of\r\nthe battery was only knee-high, and gave no cover, so that the men had\r\nto be withdrawn till dusk. An attempt had been made during the night to\r\nascertain whether it were possible to creep forward to the ditch, and\r\nlay mines there, to blow in the counterscarp. But the party who tried\r\nto reach the ditch were detected by the barking of a dog, who alarmed\r\nthe French out-picket, and the explorers had to retire with several men\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n  [425] Burgoyne’s diary in his _Life_, i. p. 192.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the fire of the garrison was so effective, the officers\r\nin charge of the siege asked for, and obtained from Wellington, three\r\nhundred marksmen to keep down the _tiraillade_. They were taken from\r\nthe Light Brigade of the King’s German Legion, and spread among the\r\nruins to fire at the embrasures and loopholes of the French. They also\r\nhoisted, with some difficulty, two field-guns on to the first floor of\r\nthe convent of San Bernardo, which lies north-west of San Vincente,\r\nand kept up a lively discharge ‘out of the drawing-room window, so to\r\nspeak. We fired for some hours at each other, during which time an\r\nunlucky shot went as completely through my captain’s (Eligé’s) heart as\r\npossible. But considering how near we were, I am much surprised that\r\nour loss was so slight--one killed and one wounded at my own gun[426].’\r\nBut the fire of the San Vincente artillery was by no means silenced.\r\n\r\n  [426] Letter of F. Monro, R.A., lent me by his representative.\r\n  See _Fortnightly Review_ for July 1912.\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 18th-19th the working party of the 6th Division\r\nsucceeded in finishing the battery which was to breach the main fort,\r\nand also commenced two smaller batteries, to right and left, in places\r\namong the ruins, one by the College of Cuenca, the other below San\r\nBernardo[427]. On the morning of the 19th the four 18-pounders and\r\nthree howitzers opened, and brought down the upper courses of the\r\nmasonry of that part of San Vincente on which they were trained.\r\nBut they could not move its lower part, or reach the counterscarp.\r\nWherefore two howitzers were put into the second battery, near the\r\nCollege of Cuenca, which could command the counterscarp. The play of\r\nthese guns proved insufficient, however, to shake it, and the garrison\r\nconcentrated such a fire upon them, mainly from musketry at loopholes,\r\nthat twenty gunners were killed or hurt while working the two howitzers.\r\n\r\n  [427] Nos. 2 and 3 in the map respectively.\r\n\r\nNext morning Dickson’s six howitzers from Elvas came up, and served to\r\nreplace those borrowed from the field companies, wherefore there was\r\nonly an addition of three pieces net to the battering-train. Two of the\r\n18-pounders were moved round to the battery (No. 2) which had been so\r\nhard hit on the preceding day: their fire proved much more effective\r\nthan that of the howitzers, and brought down an angle of the upper wall\r\nof San Vincente and part of its roof, which fell on and crushed many of\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\nBut on the 21st it was impossible to continue the battering, for the\r\nignominious reason that there were hardly any more shot left to fire.\r\nOnly sixty balls remained in store for the 18-pounders, and a little\r\nover one hundred for the howitzers[428]. The calculations of the\r\nbesiegers had been so erroneous that they had used up their stock just\r\nas the critical moment had arrived. On the previous day Wellington,\r\nseeing what was coming, had sent a hurried message to Almeida for more\r\nshot and powder--but the convoy, though urged on with all possible\r\nspeed, did not arrive at Salamanca till the 26th.\r\n\r\n  [428] Of course a few rounds more for the howitzers could have\r\n  been borrowed from the field-batteries with the divisions. For\r\n  the 18-pounders, the really important guns, there was no such\r\n  resource for borrowing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general engagement for which Wellington had prepared\r\nhimself seemed likely to come off. Marmont had all his army, save\r\nBonnet alone, collected by the 19th, at Fuente Sauco. On the following\r\nday he came boldly forward and drove in the British cavalry vedettes.\r\nHe showed three columns moving on a parallel front, which observers\r\nestimated at 18,000 foot and 2,000 horse--but there were more behind,\r\nstill invisible. At four in the afternoon he was drawing so close that\r\nWellington assumed his battle position. Five divisions and the two\r\nindependent Portuguese brigades formed the fighting-line, from San\r\nCristobal southward to Cabrerizos on the bank of the Tormes: the order\r\nwas (from right to left) 1st-7th-4th-Light-3rd-Pack and Bradford. The\r\nreserve was composed of the 5th Division, of Hulse’s brigade of the\r\n6th (of which the remainder was left to blockade the Salamanca forts),\r\nand of Carlos de España’s 3,000 Spaniards. Alten’s cavalry covered the\r\nBritish right, Ponsonby’s[429] the left, Bock’s and Le Marchant’s heavy\r\nsquadrons were in reserve.\r\n\r\n  [429] Acting vice G. Anson, absent.\r\n\r\nIt looked at first as though Marmont intended to force on the battle\r\nthat Wellington desired. Moving with great order and decision, his\r\nthree columns deployed opposite the heights, and advanced to within a\r\nvery moderate distance of them--not more than 800 yards at one point.\r\nThey were extremely visible, as the whole country-side below the\r\nBritish position was a fine plain covered with ripening wheat. The\r\nonly breaks in the surface were the infrequent villages--in this part\r\nof Spain they are all large and far apart--and a few dry watercourses,\r\nwhose line could be detected winding amid the interminable cornfields.\r\nWarning to keep off the position was given to the French by long-range\r\nfire from several of the British batteries on salient points of the\r\nline. The enemy replied noisily and with many guns: Wellington’s\r\nofficers judged that he was doing his best to make his approach audible\r\nto the garrison of the besieged forts.\r\n\r\nAt dusk the French occupied the village of Castellanos de Morisco, in\r\nfront of the right centre of the heights, and then advanced a regiment\r\nto attack Morisco, which was absolutely at the foot of them, and had\r\nbeen occupied by Wellington as an advanced post. It was held by the\r\n68th regiment from the 7th Division, a battalion which had come out\r\nfrom England in the preceding autumn, but had, by chance, never been\r\nengaged before. It made a fine defence, and beat off three attacks\r\nupon the village: but after dark Wellington called it back uphill to\r\nthe line of the position, abandoning Morisco[430]. Apparently he was\r\nglad to see the French pressing in close, and looked for an attack upon\r\nhis position next morning. Standing on the sky-line above Castellanos\r\nat dusk, with a map in his hand, he demonstrated to all the assembled\r\ngenerals commanding divisions the exact part which they were to play,\r\ntill several French round-shot compelled him to shift his position a\r\nlittle farther back[431]. The whole army slept that night in order of\r\nbattle, with strong pickets pushed down to the foot of the slopes.\r\n\r\n  [430] The 68th lost four officers and 46 men killed and wounded,\r\n  and one officer taken prisoner. For a good account of the fight\r\n  see the Memoirs of Green of the 68th, pp. 89-90.\r\n\r\n  [431] See Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 165.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no attack at dawn. Marmont’s two rear divisions\r\n(those of Foy and Thomières) and a brigade of dragoons were not yet on\r\nthe ground, and only got up in the course of the afternoon: hence he\r\nwas naturally unwilling to move, as he had a certain knowledge that\r\nhe was outnumbered. It would seem that Wellington had, that morning,\r\nan opportunity of crushing his enemy, which he must have regretted to\r\nhave lost on many subsequent days of the campaign. Marmont’s position\r\nwas one of very great risk: he had pushed in so close to the British\r\nheights, that he might have been attacked and brought to action in half\r\nan hour, and could not have got away without fighting. His position\r\nwas visible from end to end--it had no flank protection, and its only\r\nstrong points were the two villages of Morisco and Castellanos de\r\nMorisco on its left centre. Behind was an undulating sea of cornfields\r\nextending to the horizon. Wellington (after deducting the two missing\r\nbrigades of the 6th Division) could have come down in a general charge\r\nfrom his heights, with 37,000 Anglo-Portuguese infantry, and 3,500\r\nhorse--not to speak of Carlos de España’s 3,000 Spaniards. Marmont\r\nhad only five divisions of infantry (about 28,000 bayonets) on the\r\nground at daybreak, and less than 2,000 horse. He was in a thoroughly\r\ndominated position, and it is hard to see what he could have done,\r\nhad Wellington strengthened his left wing with all his cavalry and\r\ndelivered a vigorous downhill assault on the unprotected French right.\r\nThe opportunity for an attack was so favourable that Wellington’s staff\r\ndiscussed with curiosity the reasons that might be preventing it, and\r\nformed varying hypotheses to account for his holding back[432]. As a\r\nmatter of fact, as his dispatch to Lord Liverpool explains[433], the\r\nBritish Commander-in-Chief was still hoping for a second Bussaco. He\r\nsaw that Marmont was not going to attack till his rear had come up,\r\nbut hoped that he might do so that afternoon or next morning, when he\r\nhad all his men in hand. The daring way in which the Marshal continued\r\nto hold on to an untenable position, within cannon shot of his enemy’s\r\nline, seemed to argue an ultimate intention to bring on an action.\r\n\r\n  [432] Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 166.\r\n\r\n  [433] Wellington to Liverpool, Salamanca, June 25, in\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 252.\r\n\r\nNor was Wellington very far out in his ideas: Marmont was in a state of\r\nindecision. When the missing 10,000 men came up he called a council of\r\nwar--the regular resort of generals in a difficulty. We have concerning\r\nit only the evidence of Foy, who wrote as follows in his diary.\r\n\r\n‘At dusk on the 21st there was a grand discussion, on the problem as\r\nto whether we should or should not give battle to the English. The\r\nMarshal seemed to have a desire to do so, but a feeble and hesitating\r\ndesire. Remembering Vimeiro, Corunna, and Bussaco, I thought that it\r\nwould be difficult to beat the English, our superiors in number, on\r\nsuch a compact position as that which they were occupying. I had not\r\nthe first word: I allowed Maucune, Ferey[434], and La Martinière to\r\nexpress their views, before I let them see what I thought. Then Clausel\r\nhaving protested strongly against fighting, I supported his opinion.\r\nBecause we had left a small garrison in the Salamanca forts, we were\r\nnot bound to lose 6,000 killed and wounded, and risk the honour of the\r\narmy, in order to deliver them. The troops were in good spirits, and\r\nthat is excellent for the first assault: but here we should have a long\r\ntough struggle: I doubted whether we had breath enough to keep it up\r\nto the end. In short, I saw more chances of defeat than victory. I\r\nurged that we ought to keep close to the English, “contain” them, and\r\nwait for our reinforcements; this could be done by manœuvring along the\r\nleft bank of the Tormes above and below Salamanca. Clausel and I set\r\nforth this policy from every aspect. The Marshal was displeased: he\r\nfancied that his generals were plotting to wreck his plan: he wanted to\r\nredeem the blunder which he saw that he had made in leaving a garrison\r\nin Salamanca: he dreads the Emperor and the public opinion of the army.\r\nHe would have liked a battle, but he had not determination enough to\r\npersist in forcing it on[435].’\r\n\r\n  [434] The first two were great fire-eaters, and always urged\r\n  action.\r\n\r\n  [435] Foy’s _Vie militaire_, ed. Girod de l’Ain, pp. 165-6.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, certain that Wellington nearly obtained the\r\ndefensive general action that he had desired and expected, and was only\r\ndisappointed because Marmont was talked down by his two best divisional\r\ngenerals. If the Marshal had made his attack, it is clear that his\r\ndisaster would have been on a far more complete and awful scale than\r\nthe defeat which he was actually to endure on July 22. For he would\r\nhave had behind him when repulsed (as he must have been) no friendly\r\nshelter of woods and hills, such as then saved the wrecks of his army,\r\nbut a boundless rolling plain, in which routed troops would have been\r\nat the mercy of a cavalry which exceeded their own in the proportion of\r\nseven to five (or slightly more).\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 22nd, the British general, who had now kept his\r\narmy in position for thirty-six hours on end, began to guess that he\r\nwas not to be attacked. Was it worth while to advance, since the enemy\r\nrefused to do so? The conditions were by no means so favourable as at\r\nthe dawn of the 21st, when Marmont had been short of 10,000 men. But\r\nthe allied army still possessed a perceptible superiority in numbers,\r\na stronger cavalry, and a dominating position, from which it would be\r\neasy to deliver a downhill attack under cover of their artillery.\r\n\r\nWellington, however, made no decisive movement: he threw up some\r\n_flèches_ to cover the batteries in front of the 1st and 7th Divisions,\r\nof which the latter was pushed a little nearer to the Tormes. He\r\nbrought up the six heavy howitzers which had been used against the\r\nforts, and placed them on this same right wing of his position. Then\r\nhe commenced a partial offensive movement, which was apparently\r\ndesigned to draw Marmont into a serious bickering, if he were ready\r\nto stand. The 7th Division began to make an advance towards Morisco:\r\nthe skirmishers of the Light Brigade of the King’s German Legion moved\r\ndown, and began to press in the pickets opposite them, their battalions\r\nsupporting. Soon after the 51st and 68th, from the other brigade of\r\nthe division, that of De Bernewitz, were ordered to storm a knoll\r\nimmediately above Morisco, which formed the most advanced point of the\r\nenemy’s line. Wellington directed Graham to support them with the whole\r\n1st and Light Divisions, if the enemy should bring up reinforcements\r\nand show fight. But nothing of the kind happened: the two battalions\r\ncarried the knoll with a single vigorous rush, losing some 30 killed\r\nand wounded[436]. But the French made no attempt to recapture it, drew\r\nback their skirmishing line, and retired to the village, only 200 yards\r\nbehind, where they stood firm, evidently expecting a general attack. It\r\nwas not delivered: Wellington had been willing to draw Marmont into a\r\nfight, but was not intending to order an advance of the whole line, and\r\nto precipitate a general offensive battle.\r\n\r\n  [436] The 51st lost 3 killed and an officer and 20 men wounded:\r\n  the 68th 2 killed and 6 wounded, the K.G.L. Light Battalions 3\r\n  killed and 3 officers and 17 men wounded. There are narratives of\r\n  the combat in the Memoirs of Green of the 68th, and Major Rice\r\n  and Private Wheeler of the 51st.\r\n\r\nThere was no more fighting that day, and next morning the whole French\r\narmy had disappeared save some cavalry vedettes. These being pressed\r\nin by Alten’s hussars, it was discovered that Marmont had gone back\r\nsix miles, to a line of heights behind the village of Aldea Rubia, and\r\nwas there in a defensive position, with his left wing nearly touching\r\nthe Tormes near the fords of Huerta. Wellington made no pursuit: only\r\nhis cavalry reconnoitred the new French position. He kept his army on\r\nthe San Cristobal heights, only moving down Anson’s brigade of the\r\n4th Division to hold Castellanos, and Halkett’s of the 7th Division\r\nto hold Morisco. Hulse’s brigade of the 6th Division was sent back\r\nto Salamanca, as were also Dickson’s six howitzers, and Clinton was\r\ndirected to press the siege of the forts--notwithstanding the unhappy\r\nfact that there was scarcely any ammunition left in the batteries.\r\n\r\nMarmont had undoubtedly been let off easily by Wellington: yet he\r\nhardly realized it, so filled was his mind with the idea that his\r\nadversary would never take the offensive. His report to King Joseph\r\nshows a sublime ignorance of his late danger. As the document has never\r\nbeen published and is very short, it may be worth quoting.\r\n\r\n‘Having concentrated the greater part of this army on the evening of\r\nthe 19th, I marched on Salamanca the same day. I seized some outlying\r\nposts of the enemy, and my army bivouacked within half cannon-shot of\r\nthe English. Their army was very well posted, and I did not think it\r\nright to attack yesterday (June 21) without making a reconnaissance of\r\nit. The result of my observations has convinced me that as long as my\r\nown numbers are not _at least equal_ to theirs, I must temporize, and\r\ngain time for the arrival of the troops from the Army of the North,\r\nwhich General Caffarelli has promised me. If they arrive I shall\r\nbe strong enough to take an enterprising course. Till then I shall\r\nmanœuvre round Salamanca, so as to try to get the enemy to divide his\r\narmy, or to move it out of its position, which will be to my advantage.\r\nThe Salamanca forts are making an honourable defence. Since we came up\r\nthe enemy has ceased to attack them, so that I have gained time, and\r\ncan put off a general action for some days if I think proper[437].’\r\n\r\n  [437] Marmont to Joseph, night of the 22nd June, from bivouac\r\n  before San Cristobal. Intercepted dispatch in the Scovell Papers.\r\n\r\nMarmont’s plan for ‘manœuvring around Salamanca’ proved (as we shall\r\nsee) quite ineffective, and ended within a few days in a definite\r\nretreat, when he found that the succours promised by Caffarelli were\r\nnot about to appear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the siege of the Salamanca forts had recommenced, on the\r\n23rd, under the depressing conditions that the artillery had only\r\n60 rounds (15 apiece!) for the four heavy 18-pounders, which were\r\ntheir effective weapons, and 160 for the six howitzers, which had\r\nhitherto proved almost useless. The two light field-guns (6-pounders)\r\nwere also replaced on the first floor of San Bernardo to shell the\r\nenemy’s loopholes--they were no good at all for battering. This time\r\nthe besiegers placed one of their heavy guns in the right flanking\r\nbattery near San Bernardo, to get an oblique enfilading fire against\r\nthe gorge of the San Cayetano fort. The new idea was to leave San\r\nVincente alone, as too hard a nut to crack with the small supply of\r\nshot available, and to batter the lesser fort from flank and rear with\r\nthe few rounds remaining. The entire stock, together with a hundred\r\nrounds of shell, was used up by the afternoon, when no practicable\r\nbreach had been made, though the palisades of San Cayetano had been\r\nbattered down, and its parapet much injured. Nevertheless Wellington\r\nordered an attempt to storm (or rather to escalade) the minor fort at\r\n10 p.m. on the same evening. It was to be carried out by the six light\r\ncompanies of Bowes’s and Hulse’s brigades of the 6th Division, a force\r\nof between 300 and 400 men. ‘The undertaking was difficult, and the men\r\nseemed to feel it,’ observes the official historian of the Peninsular\r\nsieges[438]. The major of one of the regiments engaged remarks, ‘the\r\nresult was precisely such as most of the officers anticipated--a\r\nfailure attended with severe loss of life.’ The storming-column,\r\nstarting from the ruins near the left flanking battery, had to charge\r\nfor the gorge of San Cayetano, not only under the fire of that work,\r\nbut with musketry and artillery from San Vincente taking them in the\r\nrear. The casualties from the first moment were very heavy--many men\r\nnever got near the objective, and only two ladders out of twenty\r\nwere planted against the fort[439]. No one tried to ascend them--the\r\nproject being obviously useless, and the stormers ran back under cover\r\nafter having lost six officers and 120 men, just a third of their\r\nnumbers[440]. Among the killed was General Bowes, commanding the\r\nsecond brigade of the division, who had insisted on going forward with\r\nhis light companies--though this was evidently not brigadier’s work.\r\nApparently he thought that his personal influence might enable his\r\nmen to accomplish the impossible. He was hit slightly as the column\r\nstarted, but bound up his wound, and went forward a second time, only\r\nto be killed at the very foot of the ladders, just as his men broke and\r\nretired.\r\n\r\n  [438] Jones, i. p. 281.\r\n\r\n  [439] The regimental history of the 53rd says that the ladders\r\n  were so badly made, of green wood, that many of them came to\r\n  pieces in the hands of their carriers long before they got near\r\n  the fort.\r\n\r\n  [440] The loss has got exaggerated in many reports, because the\r\n  casualties in the 7th Division at Morisco on the preceding day\r\n  are added to the total.\r\n\r\nThis, as all engaged in it agreed, was a very unjustifiable enterprise;\r\nthe escalade was impracticable so long as San Vincente was intact, and\r\nable to cover the gorge of San Cayetano with an effective fire from\r\nthe rear. The siege now had a second period of lethargy, all the shot\r\nhaving been used up. It was only on the morning of the 26th, three\r\ndays later, that the convoy from Almeida, ordered up on the 20th by\r\nWellington, arrived with 1,000 rounds carried by mules, and enabled the\r\nbattering to begin once more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Marmont had been making persistent but ineffective diversions\r\nagainst Wellington. The advantage of the position to which he had\r\nwithdrawn was that it commanded the great bend, or elbow, of the\r\nTormes, where (at the ford of Huerta) that river turns its general\r\ncourse from northward to westward. Troops sent across the river\r\nhere could threaten Salamanca from the south, and, if in sufficient\r\nstrength, might force Wellington to evacuate part of the San Cristobal\r\nposition, in order to provide a containing force to prevent them from\r\ncommunicating with and relieving the besieged forts. The Marshal’s\r\nown statement of his intention[441] was that he hoped, by manœuvring,\r\nto get Wellington either to divide his army or to leave his strong\r\nground, or both. He aimed, no doubt, at obtaining the opportunity for\r\na successful action with some isolated part of Wellington’s force, but\r\nwas still too much convinced of the danger of fighting a general action\r\nto be ready to risk much. Moreover he was expecting, from day to day,\r\nthe 8,000 men of the Army of the North whom Caffarelli had promised\r\nhim: and it would be reckless to give battle before they arrived--if\r\nonly they were really coming.\r\n\r\n  [441] See above, p. 370.\r\n\r\nWellington could see, by his own eyes no less than by the map, for he\r\nrode along Marmont’s new front on the 23rd, that the French position\r\ngave good possibilities for a passage of the elbow of the Tormes at\r\nHuerta: wherefore he detached Bock’s brigade of German Dragoons to the\r\nsouth of the river, with orders to watch the roads debouching from the\r\nfords, and to act as a detaining force if any hostile cavalry crossed\r\nthem. He also threw forward Alten’s hussars to Aldea Lengua, a village\r\nand ford half-way between Cabrerizos and Aldea Rubia, with the object\r\nof keeping a similar close watch on any attempt of Marmont’s to move\r\nnorth of the river. One brigade of the Light Division came forward to\r\nsupport Alten--the other was écheloned a little back, on hills above\r\nAldea Lengua.\r\n\r\nOn the late evening of the 23rd Marmont sent a squadron or two across\r\nthe Huerta fords, which turned back after running into Bock’s vedettes.\r\nThis was merely an exploring party to test the practicability of\r\nthe passage; but next morning, in a heavy fog, skirmishing fire and\r\noccasional reports of cannon told Wellington that some more important\r\ndetachment was across the Tormes, and engaged with the Germans. The\r\nBritish head-quarters staff rode to the hill above Aldea Lengua, which\r\ncommands a wide view over the south bank, and, when the morning vapours\r\nrolled up at 7 o’clock, saw Bock retiring across the rolling plain in\r\nvery good order, pressed by a heavy force of all arms--two divisions\r\nof infantry headed by a light cavalry brigade with a horse artillery\r\nbattery, which was doing some harm to the two dragoon regiments as they\r\nretired in alternate échelons across the slopes.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was excellent defensive fighting-ground south of the\r\nTormes, in prolongation of the San Cristobal position north of it.\r\nThe ravine and brook[442] called the Ribera de Pelagarcia with wooded\r\nheights above them, run in front of Santa Marta and its ford, for some\r\nmiles southward from the Tormes. There was a similar line of high\r\nground facing it, with the villages of Pelabravo and Calvarisa de Ariba\r\non its top, which the French might occupy, but on passing down from\r\nthem they would run against a formidable position. Along these hills,\r\nindeed, Wellington’s first line of defence was to be formed a month\r\nlater, on the day of the battle of Salamanca. On seeing Bock’s careful\r\nretreat in progress, the Commander-in-Chief ordered Graham to cross the\r\nTormes at Santa Marta with the 1st and 7th Divisions, and to occupy the\r\nground in front of him. This was a short move, and easily accomplished\r\nwhile the French detachment was pushing the German dragoons slowly\r\nbackward. The 4th and 5th Divisions moved down to the north bank of the\r\nTormes, ready to follow if Marmont should support his advanced guard,\r\nby sending more men over the Huerta fords. Le Marchant’s heavy brigade\r\ncrossed the river with a horse artillery battery, and went to reinforce\r\nBock, whom the French could now only push in by bringing forward\r\ninfantry. Their advance continued as far as the village of Calvarisa\r\nde Abaxo, and a little beyond, where the whole 9,000 or 10,000 men\r\ndeployed, as if intending to attack Graham. But just as observers on\r\nthe Aldea Lengua heights were beginning to think that serious fighting\r\nwas probable[443], the whole fell back into column of march, and,\r\nretiring to Huerta covered by their _chasseurs_, recrossed the river.\r\n\r\n  [442] I find the name Ribera de Pelagarcia only in the more\r\n  modern Spanish maps: contemporary plans do not give it.\r\n\r\n  [443] Tomkinson, p. 170: ‘Just before they began to retire, I\r\n  thought that their advance looked serious. Our position was good,\r\n  and if they had fought with what had crossed, our force would\r\n  have been the greater.’\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs at nightfall was just what it had been at dawn.\r\nGraham and Le Marchant went back to their old ground north of the\r\nriver, and south of it cavalry alone was left--this time Alten’s\r\nbrigade, for Bock’s had had a heavy day, and needed rest. So ended a\r\nspectacular but almost bloodless manœuvre--the German dragoons lost\r\nthree killed and two wounded: the French light horse probably no more.\r\n\r\nIn a dispatch written the same night Marmont frankly owns that he was\r\nfoiled by Wellington’s counter-move. This hitherto unpublished document\r\nis worth quoting. It is addressed to General Caffarelli, and runs as\r\nfollows[444]. ‘The movement which I have made toward Salamanca has\r\ncaused the enemy to suspend his attack on the forts of that town. [An\r\nerror, as it was not the movement but the lack of ammunition which\r\nstopped the bombardment.] This consideration, and the way in which I\r\nfound him posted to keep me off, and not least your assurance that your\r\npowerful reinforcements would reach me very soon, have determined me\r\nto suspend the attack which I was about to deliver against him. I stop\r\nhere with the object of gaining time, and in the expectation of your\r\narrival.’ From this it is clear that if Graham had not been found so\r\nwell posted, in a position where he could readily be reinforced from\r\nSan Cristobal, Marmont would have followed up his advanced guard with\r\nthe rest of his army, and have struck at Salamanca from the South. But\r\nfinding the ground on the left bank of the river just as unfavourable\r\nto him as that on the north, he gave up the game and retired. He risked\r\na serious check, for Wellington might have ordered Graham to follow and\r\nattack the retreating divisions, who would have had great difficulty\r\nin recrossing the Tormes without loss, if they had been pursued and\r\nattacked while jammed at the fords. But Wellington was still in his\r\ndefensive mood, and took no risks, contented to have foiled most\r\neffectively his enemy’s manœuvre.\r\n\r\n  [444] This is one of the many cipher dispatches in the Scovell\r\n  Papers, which I have found so illuminating in a period when\r\n  Marmont’s writings, printed or in the French archives, are very\r\n  few.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th Marmont remained stationary, waiting for further advices\r\nfrom Caffarelli, which failed to come to hand. Nor did Wellington make\r\nany move, save that of sending orders that the siege of the forts was\r\nto be pressed as early and as vigorously as possible. The guns were\r\nback in their batteries, waiting for the ammunition which was yet to\r\nappear. All that could be done without shot was to push forward a\r\ntrench along the bottom of the ravine between San Vincente and the\r\nother two forts, to cut off communication between them. The French\r\nfired fiercely at the workers, where they could look down into the\r\nravine, and killed some of them. But there was much ‘dead ground’ which\r\ncould not be reached from any point in the forts, and by dawn on the\r\n26th the trench was far advanced, and a picket was lodged safely in it,\r\nclose under the gorge of San Cayetano.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th the convoy of powder and shot from Almeida\r\nreached the front, and at three in the afternoon the besiegers\r\nrecommenced their fire. This time no guns were placed in the original\r\nbattery opposite the north front of San Vincente; the four 18-pounders\r\nall went into the right flank attack, and were concentrated on the\r\ngorge of San Cayetano. Four of the howitzers were placed in the left\r\nflank battery, near the College of Cuenca, and directed to fire red-hot\r\nshot into the roof and upper story of San Vincente. The field-guns in\r\nSan Bernardo, aided by one howitzer, took up their old work of trying\r\nto keep down the fire of the forts.\r\n\r\nThe battering in of the gorge of San Cayetano made considerable\r\nprogress, but the most effective work was that of the red-hot shot,\r\nwhich before night had set the tower of San Vincente and several points\r\nof its roof in flames. By heroic exertions the garrison succeeded in\r\nextinguishing them, but the besiegers’ fire was kept up all night, and\r\nfrom time to time new conflagrations burst out. The governor afterwards\r\ninformed the British engineers that eighteen separate outbreaks were\r\nkept down within the twenty-four hours before his surrender[445]. The\r\nfort was very inflammable, owing to the immense amount of timber that\r\nhad been used for casemating, traverses, barricades, and parapets,\r\ninside its walls. Still it was holding out at daybreak, though the\r\ngarrison was nearly exhausted: the governor signalled to Marmont that\r\nhe could not resist for more than three days--a sad over-estimate of\r\nhis power, as was to be shown in a few hours. As a subsidiary aid to\r\nthe work of the guns two mines were commenced, one from the ravine,\r\ndestined to burrow under San Cayetano, the other from the cliff by the\r\nriver, intended to reach La Merced. But neither was fated to be used,\r\nother means sufficing.\r\n\r\n  [445] Jones, _Sieges of the Peninsula_, i. p. 285.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours’ pounding on the morning of the 27th, the gorge of San\r\nCayetano had been battered into a real and very practicable breach,\r\nwhile a new fire had broken out in San Vincente, larger than any one\r\nwhich had preceded it. It reached the main store of gabions and planks\r\nwithin the fort, and threatened the powder magazine. The garrison were\r\nevidently flinching from their guns, as the counter-fire from the\r\nplace, hitherto very lively, began to flag, and the whole building was\r\nwrapped in smoke.\r\n\r\nThereupon Wellington ordered San Cayetano to be stormed for the second\r\ntime. The column charged with the operation crept forward along the\r\ntrench at the bottom of the ravine, fairly well covered till it had\r\nreached the spot immediately below the gorge of the fort. Just as the\r\nforlorn hope was about to start out of the trench, a white flag was\r\nshown from the breach. The captain commanding in San Cayetano asked for\r\ntwo hours’ truce, to enable him to communicate with his chief in San\r\nVincente, promising to surrender at the end of that time. Wellington\r\noffered him five minutes to march out, if he wished to preserve his\r\ngarrison’s lives and baggage. As the Frenchmen continued to haggle and\r\nargue, he was told to take down his white flag, as the assault was\r\nabout to be delivered. When the stormers ran in, San Cayetano made\r\npractically no defence, though a few shots were fired, which caused six\r\ncasualties in the assaulting column: the greater part of the garrison\r\nthrew down their muskets and made no resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALAMANCA FORTS]\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the white flag went up on San Vincente also: here\r\nthe conflagration was now burning up so fiercely that the French had\r\nbeen able to spare no attention for the storming-party that captured\r\nSan Cayetano. The governor, Duchemin, asked for three hours’ suspension\r\nof arms, and made a proposal of terms of surrender. Wellington, here\r\nas at the smaller fort, refused to grant time, as he thought that the\r\nfire would be subdued and the defence prolonged, if he allowed hours\r\nto be wasted in negotiations. He sent in the same ultimatum as at San\r\nCayetano--five minutes for the garrison to march out, and they should\r\nhave all the ‘honours of war’ and their baggage intact. Duchemin, like\r\nhis subordinate, returned a dilatory message, but while his white flag\r\nwas still flying, the 9th Caçadores pushed up out of the ravine and\r\nentered the battery on the east side of the work. They were not fired\r\non, no one in San Vincente being prepared to continue the defence, and\r\nthe French standard came down without further resistance.\r\n\r\nNot quite 600 unwounded men of the garrison were captured. They had\r\nlost just 200 during the siege, including 14 officers[446]. The\r\ncasualties among the British were, as might have been expected, much\r\nheavier, largely owing to the unjustifiable assault of June 23rd. They\r\namounted to 5 officers and 94 men killed, and 29 officers and 302\r\nmen wounded. A considerable store of clothing, much powder, and 36\r\nguns of all sorts were found in the three forts. The powder was made\r\nover to Carlos de España, one of whose officers, having moved it into\r\nthe town on the 7th July, contrived to explode many barrels, which\r\nkilled several soldiers and twenty citizens, besides wrecking some\r\nhouses[447]. The three forts were destroyed with care, when they had\r\nbeen stripped of all their contents.\r\n\r\n  [446] The total given by the governor to Warre of Beresford’s\r\n  staff (see his _Letters_, ed. Dr. Warre, p. 270) were 3 officers\r\n  and 40 men killed, 11 officers and 140 men wounded. Martinien’s\r\n  lists show 12 officers hit, 5 in the 65th, 2 each in the 15th and\r\n  17th Léger, 1 each in 86th, artillery, and engineers. But these\r\n  admirable lists are not quite complete.\r\n\r\n  [447] This is said to have been the result of the escort’s\r\n  smoking round the store!\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Salamanca forts happened just in time to prevent\r\nMarmont from committing himself to a serious offensive operation\r\nfor their succour. It will be remembered that, on June 24th, he had\r\nused the plea that Caffarelli’s troops must be with him, ere many\r\ndays had passed, as a justification for not pushing on to attack the\r\nBritish divisions in front of Santa Marta. And this expectation was\r\nreasonable, in view of that general’s last dispatch from Vittoria of\r\nJune 14th[448], which spoke of his appearance with 8,000 men as certain\r\nand imminent. On the 26th, however, the Marshal received another letter\r\nfrom the Army of the North, couched in a very different tone, which\r\nupset all his plans. Caffarelli, writing on the 20th, reported the\r\nsudden arrival on the Biscay coast of Sir Home Popham’s fleet, whose\r\nstrength he much exaggerated. In co-operation with the English, Longa,\r\nRenovales, and Porlier had all come down from their mountains, and\r\nBilbao was in danger from their unexpected and simultaneous appearance.\r\nIt would probably be necessary to march to drive off the ‘7th Army’ and\r\nthe British expedition without delay. At any rate the transference of\r\nany infantry towards the Douro for the succour of the Army of Portugal\r\nhad become impossible for the moment. The brigade of light cavalry and\r\nthe guns might still be sent, but the infantry division had become\r\nindispensable elsewhere. ‘I am sorry,’ ended Caffarelli, ‘but I could\r\nnot have foreseen this development, and when I spoke of marching\r\ntowards you I was far from suspecting that it could arise.’\r\n\r\n  [448] Printed in Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. p. 410.\r\n\r\nThis epistle changed the whole aspect of affairs: if the infantry\r\ndivision from Vittoria had been diverted into Biscay for an indefinite\r\nperiod, and if even the cavalry and guns (an insignificant force so\r\nfar as numbers went, yet useful to an army short of horse) had not\r\neven started on June 20th, it was clear that not a single man would\r\nbe available from the North for many days. Meanwhile the governor of\r\nthe forts signalled at dawn on the 27th that seventy-two hours was\r\nthe limit of his power of resistance. Thereupon Marmont came to the\r\ndesperate resolve to attempt the relief of San Vincente with no more\r\nthan his own 40,000 men. He tells us that he intended to move by the\r\nsouth side of the Tormes, crossing not at Huerta (as on the 24th) but\r\nat Alba de Tormes, seven miles higher up, where he had a small garrison\r\nin the old castle, which protected the bridge. This move would have\r\nbrought him precisely on to the ground where he ultimately fought the\r\ndisastrous battle of July 22nd. He would have met Wellington with\r\n7,000 men less than he brought to the actual battle that was yet to\r\ncome, while the Anglo-Portuguese army was practically the same in July\r\nas it was in June[449]. The result could not have been doubtful--and\r\nMarmont knew that he was taking a serious risk. But he did not fathom\r\nits full danger, since he was filled with an unjustifiable confidence\r\nin his adversary’s aversion to battle, and thought that he might be\r\nmanœuvred and bullied out of his position, by a move against his\r\ncommunications[450]. He would have found out his error in front of the\r\nArapiles on June 29th if he had persevered.\r\n\r\n  [449] If Marmont had marched for Alba de Tormes on the 28th, as\r\n  he intended to do, Wellington would have had the 6th Division\r\n  in hand, as well as the rest of his troops, for a battle on the\r\n  29th: for the forts fell early on the 27th June.\r\n\r\n  [450] See his explanation of his intentions in _Mémoires_, iv.\r\n  pp. 219-20.\r\n\r\nBut he did not persevere: in the morning of June 27 the firing at\r\nSalamanca ceased, and a few hours later it was known that the forts had\r\nfallen. Having now no longer any reason for taking risks, the Marshal\r\nchanged his whole plan, and resolved to remove himself in haste from\r\nWellington’s neighbourhood, and to take up a defensive position till\r\nhe should receive reinforcements. Two courses were open to him--the\r\nfirst was to retire due eastward toward Arevalo, and put himself in\r\ncommunication, by Avila and Segovia, with the Army of the Centre and\r\nMadrid. The second was to retire north-eastward toward Valladolid, and\r\nto go behind the strong defensive line of the Douro. Taking this line\r\nthe Marshal would sacrifice his touch with Madrid and the South, but\r\nwould be certain of picking up the reinforcement under Bonnet which he\r\nwas expecting from the Asturias, and would also be able to receive\r\nwith security whatever succour Caffarelli might send--even if it turned\r\nout to be no more than cavalry and guns.\r\n\r\nThis alternative he chose, probably with wisdom, for in a position on\r\nthe Douro he threatened Wellington’s flank if he should advance farther\r\neastward, and protected the central parts of the kingdom of Leon from\r\nbeing overrun by the Army of Galicia and Silveira’s Portuguese, who\r\nwould have had no containing force whatever in front of them if he had\r\nkept south of the Douro and linked himself with Madrid. His retreat,\r\ncommenced before daybreak on the 28th, took him behind the Guarena\r\nriver that night: on the 29th he crossed the Trabancos, and rested for\r\na day after two forced marches. On the 30th he passed the Zapardiel,\r\nand reached Rueda, close to the Douro, on the following morning. From\r\nthence he wrote to King Joseph a dispatch which explains sufficiently\r\nwell all his designs: it is all the more valuable because its details\r\ndo not entirely bear out the version of his plans which he gives in his\r\n_Mémoires_.\r\n\r\n‘The Salamanca forts,’ he said, ‘having surrendered, there was no\r\nreason for lingering on the Tormes; it was better to fall back on his\r\nreinforcements. If he had not done so, he would have been himself\r\nattacked, for Wellington was preparing to strike, and pursued promptly.\r\nHe had detached one division [Foy] towards Toro and the Lower Douro to\r\nkeep off Silveira, who had passed that river at Zamora. Moreover the\r\nGalicians had blockaded Astorga, and crossed the Orbigo. He felt that\r\nhe could defend the line of the Douro with confidence, being aided by\r\nthe line of fortified posts along it--Zamora, Toro, and Tordesillas.\r\nBut to take the offensive against Wellington he must have 1,500 more\r\ncavalry and 7,000 more infantry than he actually had in hand--since\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese army was nearly 50,000 strong, and included 5,000\r\nEnglish horse.’ This reinforcement was precisely what Caffarelli had\r\npromised, but by the 28th not one man of the Army of the North had\r\nreached Valladolid. ‘If the general can trump up some valid excuse\r\nfor not sending me the infantry, there is none for keeping back the\r\ncavalry--which is useless among his mountains--or the artillery, which\r\nlies idle at Burgos.’ Would it not be possible for the Army of the\r\nCentre to lend the Army of Portugal Treillard’s division of dragoons\r\nfrom the valley of the Tagus, since Caffarelli sent nothing? If only\r\nthe necessary reinforcements, 1,500 horse and 7,000 foot, came to hand,\r\nthe Army of Portugal could take the offensive with a certainty of\r\nsuccess[451]; in eight days Wellington’s designs could be foiled, and\r\nSalamanca could be recovered. But without that succour the Marshal must\r\nkeep to the defensive behind the Douro--’I can combat the course of\r\nevents, but cannot master them[452].’\r\n\r\n  [451] In this dispatch and that of July 6 following, Marmont\r\n  seems to understate his own force at the moment, saying that\r\n  he can dispose of only 30,000 infantry, and 2,000 cavalry or a\r\n  trifle over. Allowing for the artillery, engineers and sappers,\r\n  gendarmerie and train, which the monthly returns show, this would\r\n  give an army of some 35,000 or 36,000 in all. But the returns\r\n  (see Appendix) indicate a higher figure for the infantry; after\r\n  all deductions for detachments, garrisons, and sick have been\r\n  made, it looks as if there must have been 33,000 or even 34,000\r\n  available. Generals with a ‘point to prove’ are always a little\r\n  easy with their figures.\r\n\r\n  [452] This is again one of the Scovell intercepted\r\n  cipher-dispatches, captured and brought to Wellington a day or\r\n  two after it was written. It was a duplicate, and presumably the\r\n  other copy reached Madrid.\r\n\r\nThis interesting dispatch explains all that followed. Marmont was\r\nprepared to fight whenever he could show a rough numerical equality\r\nwith Wellington’s army. He obtained it a few days later, by the arrival\r\nof Bonnet with his 6,500 infantry, and the increase of his cavalry by\r\n800 or 900 sabres owing to measures hereafter to be described. On July\r\n15th he had got together nearly 50,000 men of all arms, and at once\r\ntook the offensive, according to the programme which he had laid down.\r\nIt is, therefore, unfair to him to say that he declared himself unable\r\nto fight till he should have got reinforcements either from Caffarelli\r\nor from Madrid, and then (in despite of his declaration) attacked\r\nWellington without having received them. He may have been presumptuous\r\nin acting as he did, but at least he gave his Commander-in-Chief fair\r\nnotice, a fortnight beforehand, as to his intentions. It was the\r\nmisfortune of the French that some of their dispatches miscarried,\r\nowing to the activity of the guerrilleros, while others came to\r\nhand very late. Marmont and King Joseph--as we shall see--were very\r\nimperfectly and intermittently informed as to each other’s doings. But\r\nthe Marshal cannot reasonably be accused of betraying or deluding\r\nthe King out of jealousy or blind ambition. When he had collected a\r\nforce very nearly equal to Wellington’s in numbers, and far superior\r\nin national homogeneity, he cannot be blamed over-much for attacking a\r\nfoe whose fighting spirit and initiative he much undervalued. That his\r\nconception of Wellington’s character and capacity was hopelessly wrong\r\ncannot be denied: the estimate was to prove his ruin. But it had not\r\nbeen formed without much observation and experiment: after what he had\r\nseen on the Caya, and at Aldea da Ponte, and recently on the heights of\r\nSan Cristobal, he thought he could take liberties with his opponent. He\r\nwas to be undeceived in a very rude fashion before July was out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMARMONT TAKES THE OFFENSIVE. JULY 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 2nd Wellington had arrived at the end of the first stage of\r\nhis campaign. He had cleared the French out of the whole of southern\r\nLeon as far as the Douro, had taken the Salamanca forts, and had beaten\r\noff with ease Marmont’s attempts to meddle with him. All this had been\r\naccomplished with the loss of less than 500 men. But the success,\r\nthough marked, was not decisive, since the enemy’s army had not been\r\nbeaten in the open field, but only manœuvred out of the considerable\r\nregion that it had evacuated. The most tangible advantage secured was\r\nthat Marmont had been cut off from Madrid and the Army of the Centre:\r\nhe could now communicate with King Joseph only by the circuitous line\r\nthrough Segovia. All the guerrilleros of Castile, especially the bands\r\nof Saornil and Principe, were thrown on the Segovia and Avila roads,\r\nwhere they served Wellington excellently, for they captured most of the\r\ndispatches which were passing between King Joseph and Marmont, who were\r\nreally out of touch with each other after the Marshal’s retreat from\r\nthe Tormes on June 27th.\r\n\r\nBut till Marmont had been beaten in action nothing was settled, and\r\nWellington had been disappointed of his hope that the Army of Portugal\r\nwould attack him in position, and allow him to deal with it in the\r\nstyle of Bussaco. The Marshal had retired behind the Douro with his\r\nhost intact: it was certain that he would be joined there by Bonnet’s\r\ndivision from the Asturias, and very possible that he might also\r\nreceive succour from the Army of the North. The junction of Bonnet\r\nwould give him a practical equality in numbers with the British army:\r\nany considerable reinforcement from Caffarelli would make him superior\r\nin force. And there was still a chance that other French armies might\r\nintervene, though hitherto there were no signs of it. For it was only\r\nduring the first fortnight of the campaign that Wellington could reckon\r\non having to deal with his immediate adversary alone. He was bound to\r\nhave that much start, owing to the wide dispersion of the French, and\r\ntheir difficulty in communicating with each other. But as the weeks\r\nwore on, and the enemy became more able to grasp the situation, there\r\nwas a growing possibility that outlying forces might be brought up\r\ntowards the Douro. If Marmont had only been defeated on June 21st this\r\nwould have mattered little: and Wellington must have regretted more\r\nand more each day that he had not taken the obvious opportunity, and\r\nattacked the Army of Portugal when it placed itself, incomplete and in\r\na poor position, beneath the heights of San Cristobal.\r\n\r\nNow, however, since Marmont had got away intact, everything depended\r\non the working of the various diversions which had been prepared to\r\ndistract the other French armies. One of them, Sir Home Popham’s,\r\nhad succeeded to admiration, and had so scared Caffarelli that not\r\na man of the Army of the North was yet in motion toward the Douro.\r\nAnd this fortunate expedition was to continue effective: for another\r\nthree weeks Marmont got no succours from the army that was supposed\r\nto constitute his supporting force by the instructions of the Emperor\r\nand of King Joseph. But Wellington--not having the gift of prophecy,\r\nthough he could see further into the fog of war than other men--was\r\nunable to rely with certainty on Caffarelli’s continued abstinence from\r\ninterference. As to Soult, there were as yet no signs of any trouble\r\nfrom Andalusia. The Duke of Dalmatia had somewhat reinforced D’Erlon’s\r\ncorps in Estremadura, but not to such an extent as threatened any\r\nreal danger to Hill, who reported that he could keep D’Erlon in check\r\non the Albuera position, and was not certain that he might not be\r\nable to attack him at advantage--a move for which he had his chief’s\r\npermission[453]. If only Wellington had been fortunate enough to\r\nreceive some of Soult’s letters to King Joseph, written in the second\r\nhalf of June, he would have been much reassured: for the Marshal was\r\n(as we shall see) refusing in the most insubordinate style to carry\r\nout the orders sent him to move troops northward. Two minor pieces\r\nof intelligence from the South were of no primary importance--though\r\nvexatious enough--one was that Ballasteros had ventured on a battle at\r\nBornos on June 1, and got well beaten: but his army was not destroyed.\r\nThe second was that General Slade had suffered a discreditable check at\r\nMaguilla on June 11th in a cavalry combat with Lallemand’s dragoons.\r\nBut neither of these events had much influence on Soult’s general\r\nconduct at the time, as we shall show in the proper place.\r\n\r\n  [453] See Wellington to Lord Liverpool, June 25. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. pp. 253-4, and to Hill, ix. pp. 256-7, and again to Lord\r\n  Liverpool, ix. pp. 261-2.\r\n\r\nThere remained one quarter from which Wellington had received\r\ninformation that was somewhat disturbing. An intercepted letter from\r\nKing Joseph to D’Erlon showed that the latter had been directed to move\r\ntowards the Tagus, and that the King himself was evidently thinking of\r\nbringing succour to Marmont, so far as his modest means allowed[454].\r\nBut since this projected operation seemed to depend on assistance being\r\ngranted by Soult, and since it was doubtful in the highest degree\r\nwhether Soult would give it, Wellington was not without hopes that it\r\nmight come to nothing. ‘I have requested the Empecinado,’ he writes\r\nto Lord Liverpool, ‘to alarm the King for the safety of his situation\r\nabout Madrid, and I hope that Marshal Soult will find ample employment\r\nfor his troops in the blockade of Cadiz, the continued operations of\r\nGeneral Ballasteros, and those in Estremadura of Lieut.-General Hill,\r\nwhose attention I have called to the probable march of this corps of\r\nthe Army of the South through Estremadura.’ As a matter of fact Soult\r\nprevented D’Erlon from giving any help to the King or Marmont; but a\r\ncontingency was to arise of which Wellington, on July 1st, could have\r\nno expectation--viz. that, though refused all help from the South,\r\nJoseph might come to the desperate but most soldier-like determination\r\nto march with his own little army alone to the Douro, in order to bring\r\nto bear such influence as he possessed on what was obviously a critical\r\nmoment in the war. The King and Jourdan were the only men in Spain who\r\nshowed a true appreciation of the crisis: but they made their move too\r\nlate: the fault was undoubtedly Soult’s alone. However, on July 1st,\r\nWellington was justified in doubting whether any danger would arise on\r\nthe side of Madrid. Joseph could not move the Army of the Centre to\r\nthe Douro, without risking his capital and abandoning all New Castile.\r\nAs late as July 11th Wellington suspected that he would not make this\r\nextreme sacrifice, but would rather push a demonstration down the\r\nTagus to alarm central Portugal, a hypothesis which did not much alarm\r\nhim[455]. The King and Jourdan knew better than to make this indecisive\r\nmove, and marched where their 14,000 men might have turned the whole\r\ncourse of the campaign--but marched too late.\r\n\r\n  [454] See Wellington to Lord Liverpool, June 18. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 241, and June 25, p. 253. There was also in Wellington’s\r\n  hands an intercepted letter of Joseph to Soult of May 26,\r\n  distinctly saying that if Marmont is attacked in June, D’Erlon\r\n  must pass the Tagus and go to his help. This is in the Scovell\r\n  ciphers.\r\n\r\n  [455] Wellington to Hill, July 11. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 281.\r\n  The idea that Joseph might operate on his own account begins to\r\n  emerge in the correspondence on the 14th. _Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n  283.\r\n\r\nThere was still a chance that Suchet might be helping the King--this\r\ndepended entirely on an unknown factor in the game, the diversion\r\nwhich Lord William Bentinck had promised to execute on the coast of\r\nCatalonia. If it had begun to work, as it should have done, by the\r\nsecond half of June, there was little chance that any troops from the\r\neastern side of Spain would interfere in the struggle on the Douro. But\r\nno information of recent date was yet forthcoming: it was not till July\r\n14th that the vexatious news arrived that Lord William was faltering\r\nin his purpose, and thinking of plans for diverting his expeditionary\r\nforce to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe situation, therefore, when Marmont went behind the Douro on\r\nJuly 1st, had many uncertain points: there were several dangerous\r\npossibilities, but nothing had yet happened to make ultimate success\r\nimprobable. On the whole the most disappointing factor was the conduct\r\nof the Army of Galicia. It will be remembered that Wellington had\r\narranged for a double diversion on Marmont’s flank and rear. Silveira,\r\nwith the militia of the Tras-os-Montes and D’Urban’s Portuguese cavalry\r\nbrigade, was to cross the Esla and besiege Zamora. Santocildes, with\r\nthe Army of Galicia, had been directed to attack Astorga with part of\r\nhis force, but to bring the main body forward to the Esla and overrun\r\nthe plains of northern Leon. Silveira had but a trifling force, and the\r\ntask allotted to him was small: but on July 1st he had not yet reached\r\nZamora with his infantry, and was only at Carvajales on the Esla[456].\r\nOn the other hand D’Urban’s cavalry had pushed boldly forward in front\r\nof him, had swept the whole north bank of the Douro as far as Toro,\r\nand reported that all the French garrisons save Astorga, Zamora, and\r\nToro had been drawn in--that Benavente, Leon, and all the northern\r\nplain were unoccupied. On July 2 D’Urban was at Castronuevo, north of\r\nToro, right in the rear of Marmont’s flank--a very useful position,\r\nsince it enabled him to keep up communication between Silveira and\r\nthe Galicians, as well as to report any movement of the French right.\r\nMoreover, though his force was very small, only 800 sabres, it was\r\nenough to prevent any foraging parties from Marmont’s rear from\r\nexploiting the resources of the north bank of the Douro. Some such\r\nappeared, but were driven in at once, so that the Marshal had to live\r\non his magazines and the villages actually within his lines: in the end\r\nthese resources would be exhausted, and the old choice--starvation or\r\ndispersion--would once more be presented to the Army of Portugal[457].\r\n\r\n  [456] By no fault of his own, according to D’Urban. The orders\r\n  for him to move were, by some delay at head-quarters, only\r\n  forthcoming on June 8th. Only two of the four Tras-os-Montes\r\n  militia regiments were then mobilized, and it took a long time to\r\n  collect the rest and the transport needed for moving across the\r\n  frontier.\r\n\r\n  [457] D’Urban’s manœuvres on both sides of the Douro are detailed\r\n  at great length in his very interesting diary, and his official\r\n  correspondence, both of which have been placed at my disposal. He\r\n  worked on both sides of the Douro, but went definitely north of\r\n  it after July 1.\r\n\r\nBut as a military body neither D’Urban’s 800 horse nor Silveira’s 4,000\r\nmilitia had any threatening power against Marmont’s rear. They might\r\nalmost be neglected, while the real pressure which Wellington had\r\nintended to apply in this quarter was not forthcoming. He had hoped\r\nthat, by the time that he and Marmont were at close quarters, the\r\nArmy of Galicia would have been taking a useful part in the campaign.\r\nIt was not that he intended to use it as a fighting force: but if it\r\ncould have appeared in the French rear 15,000 strong, it would have\r\ncompelled Marmont to make such a large detachment for the purpose of\r\n‘containing’ it, that he would have been left in a marked numerical\r\ninferiority on the Douro.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Galicians moved late, in small numbers, and with\r\nmarked timidity. They exercised no influence whatever on the course of\r\nthe campaign, either in June or in July. Yet after Bonnet evacuated\r\nthe Asturias and went off eastward on June 15th, the Army of Galicia\r\nhad no field-force of any kind in front of it. The only French left in\r\nits neighbourhood were the 1,500 men[458] who formed the garrison of\r\nAstorga. Castaños, who had moved up to Santiago in June, and assumed\r\ncommand, did not take the field himself, but handed over the charge of\r\nthe troops at the front to Santocildes. The latter sat down in front\r\nof Astorga with his main body, and only pushed forward a weak division\r\nunder Cabrera to Benavente, where it was still too remote from Marmont\r\nto cause him any disquiet. The siege of Astorga was only a blockade\r\ntill July 2nd, as no battering-train was brought up till that date.\r\nFirst Abadia, and later Castaños had pleaded that they had no means for\r\na regular siege, and it was not till Sir Howard Douglas pointed out a\r\nsufficient store of heavy guns in the arsenal of Corunna, that Castaños\r\nbegan to scrape together the battering-train that ultimately reached\r\nAstorga[459]. But this was not so much the weak point in the operations\r\nof the Galician army, as the fact that, of 15,000 men brought together\r\non the Orbigo, only 3,800 were pushed forward to the Esla, while the\r\nunnecessarily large remainder conducted a leisurely siege of the small\r\ngarrison of Astorga. Wellington had reckoned on having an appreciable\r\nforce, 10,000 or 12,000 men, at the front, molesting Marmont’s flank;\r\nthis would have forced the Marshal to make a large detachment to keep\r\nit off. But not a man appeared on the east bank of the Esla, and the\r\noperations of D’Urban’s small brigade were of far more service to the\r\nmain army than that of the whole of the Galicians. Marmont ignored the\r\npresence of the few thousand men pushed forward to Benavente, and was\r\njustified in so doing. Meanwhile Santocildes, with an optimism that\r\nproved wholly unjustifiable, sent messages that Astorga would be taken\r\nwithin a few days, and that he would then move forward with his main\r\nbody. As a matter of fact the place held out till the 18th of August.\r\n\r\n  [458] Two battalions of 23rd Léger and one of 1st Line from\r\n  Thomières’s division.\r\n\r\n  [459] For the curious story of their ignorance of their own\r\n  resources see Sir Howard Douglas’s _Life_, pp. 156-7.\r\n\r\nWellington, therefore, was building on a false hypothesis when he wrote\r\nto Lord Bathurst, on July 7, that he was surveying all the fords of the\r\nDouro, and waiting till the river should have fallen a little and made\r\nthem more practicable. ‘By that time I hope that the Army of Galicia\r\nunder General Santocildes will have been able to advance, the siege of\r\nAstorga having been brought to a conclusion[460].’ Two days later he\r\nadded, ‘it would not answer to cross the river at all in its present\r\nstate, unless we should be certain of having the co-operation of the\r\nGalician troops[461].’ His delay in making an attempt to force the line\r\nof the Douro, therefore, may be attributed in the main to the tiresome\r\nconduct of Santocildes, who played to him much the same part that\r\nCaffarelli played to Marmont.\r\n\r\n  [460] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 274.\r\n\r\n  [461] Ibid., ix. p. 276.\r\n\r\nWhile remaining in this waiting posture, Wellington placed his troops\r\nopposite the various passages of the Douro, on a line of some fifteen\r\nmiles. His left, consisting of the 3rd Division, Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese, and Carlos de España’s Spaniards, with Le Marchant’s and\r\nBock’s heavy dragoons, lay near the point where the Trabancos falls\r\ninto the Douro, holding the ford of Pollos, where the favourable\r\nconfiguration of the ground enabled them to be sure of the passage, the\r\nenemy’s line being perforce drawn back to some distance on the north\r\nbank. It was always open to Wellington to use this ford, when he should\r\ndetermine on a general advance. The Light, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions,\r\nforming the right wing, lay opposite Tordesillas, with Rueda and La\r\nSeca behind them. Their front was covered by Alten’s cavalry brigade,\r\ntheir right (or outer) flank by Anson’s. The reserve was formed by the\r\n1st and 7th Divisions quartered at Medina del Campo, ten miles to the\r\nrear. The whole could be assembled for an offensive or a defensive move\r\nin a day’s march.\r\n\r\nMarmont was drawn up, to face the attack that he expected, in an almost\r\nequally close and concentrated formation: his front, extending from the\r\njunction of the Pisuerga with the Douro near Simancas on his left, to\r\nthe ground opposite the ford of Pollos on his right, was very thickly\r\nheld[462]; but on the 5th he rightly conceived doubts as to whether it\r\nwould not be easy for Wellington to turn his western flank, by using\r\nthe ford of Castro Nuño and other passages down-stream from Pollos. He\r\nthen detached Foy’s division to Toro and the neighbourhood, to guard\r\nagainst such a danger: but this was still an insufficient provision,\r\nsince Toro is fifteen miles from Pollos, and a single division of 5,000\r\nmen would have to watch rather than defend such a length of river-line,\r\nif it were attacked in force. Therefore when Bonnet, so long expected\r\nin vain, arrived from the North on July 7th, Marmont placed him in this\r\nportion of his line, for the assistance of Foy. He still retained six\r\ndivisions massed around Tordesillas, whose unbroken bridge gave him\r\na secure access to the southern bank of the Douro. With this mass of\r\n35,000 men in hand, he could meet Wellington with a solid body, if the\r\nlatter crossed the Douro at or below Pollos. Or he might equally well\r\ntake the more daring step of assuming a counter-offensive, and marching\r\nfrom Tordesillas on Salamanca against his adversary’s communications,\r\nif the allies threatened his own by passing the river and moving on\r\nValladolid.\r\n\r\n  [462] An interesting dispatch from D’Urban to Beresford describes\r\n  the information he had got on the 5th by a daring reconnaissance\r\n  along Marmont’s rear: there was not that morning any French force\r\n  west of Monte de Cubillos, six miles down-stream from Pollos.\r\n\r\nA word to explain the tardiness of Bonnet’s arrival in comparison with\r\nthe earliness of his start is perhaps required. He had evacuated Oviedo\r\nand Gijon and his other posts in the Asturias as early as June 14th,\r\nthe actual day on which Wellington commenced his offensive campaign.\r\nThis he did not in consequence of Marmont’s orders, which only reached\r\nhim when he had begun to move, but on his own responsibility. He had\r\nreceived correct information as to the massing of the allied army round\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, and of the forward movement of the Galicians towards\r\nAstorga. He knew of the dispersed state of Marmont’s host, and saw the\r\ndanger to himself. Should the Marshal concentrate about Salamanca,\r\nhe could never join him, if the whole Army of Galicia threw itself\r\nbetween. Wherefore not only did he resolve to retreat at once, but he\r\ndid not move by the pass of Pajares and Leon--the obvious route to\r\nrejoin the Army of Portugal. For fear that he might be intercepted,\r\nhe took the coast-road, picking up the small garrisons that he had\r\nplaced in one or two small ports. He reached Santander on the 22nd,\r\nnot molested so much as he might have been by the bands of Porlier and\r\nLonga (whose haunts he was passing), because the bulk of them had gone\r\noff to help in Sir Home Popham’s raid on Biscay. From Santander he\r\nturned inland, passed Reynosa, in the heart of the Cantabrian Sierras,\r\non the 24th June, and arrived at Aguilar del Campo, the first town\r\nin the province of Palencia, on the 29th. From thence he had a long\r\nmarch of seven days in the plains, before he reached Valladolid on the\r\n6th, and reported himself at Marmont’s head-quarters on the 7th of\r\nJuly. He brought with him a strong division of 6,500 infantry, a light\r\nfield-battery, and a single squadron of Chasseurs--even 100 sabres[463]\r\nwere a welcome reinforcement to Marmont’s under-horsed army. It was an\r\nodd fact that Bonnet’s division had never before met the English in\r\nbattle, though one of its regiments had seen them during the last days\r\nof Sir John Moore’s retreat in January 1809[464]. For the three years\r\nsince that date they had always been employed in the Asturias.\r\n\r\n  [463] Ninety-four to be exact. See 28th Chasseurs in table of\r\n  Marmont’s army in Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [464] The 122nd Line had been in Mermet’s division, in January\r\n  1809, but they had been in reserve at Corunna, and had not fired\r\n  a shot in that battle.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Bonnet brought up the total of Marmont’s infantry\r\nto 43,000 men, and his guns to 78. The cavalry still remained the\r\nweak point: but by a high-handed and unpopular measure the Marshal\r\nsucceeded, during his stay on the Douro, in procuring nearly 1,000\r\nhorses for the dismounted dragoons who were encumbering his dépôt\r\nat Valladolid. In the French, as in the British, Peninsular army it\r\nhad become common for many of the junior officers of the infantry\r\nto provide themselves with a riding-horse; most captains and many\r\nlieutenants had them. And their seniors, _chefs de bataillon_ and\r\ncolonels, habitually had several horses more than they were entitled\r\nto. Marmont took the heroic measure of proclaiming that he should\r\nenforce the regulations, and that all unauthorized horses were\r\nconfiscated. He paid, however, a valuation for each beast on a moderate\r\nscale--otherwise the act would have been intolerable. In this way,\r\nincluding some mounts requisitioned from doctors, commissaries, and\r\nsuttlers, about 1,000 horses in all were procured. The number of\r\ncavalry fit for the field had gone up by July 15th from about 2,200 to\r\n3,200--a total which was only 300 less than Wellington’s full strength\r\nof British sabres. It occurs to the casual observer that the horses,\r\nhaving never been trained to squadron drill or to act in mass, must\r\nhave been difficult to manage, even though the riders were competent\r\nhorsemen. This may have something to do with the very ineffective part\r\nplayed by the French cavalry in the next fortnight’s campaigning.\r\n\r\nA quaint anecdote of the time shows us General Taupin, an old\r\nRevolutionary veteran, with all the officers of his brigade called\r\ntogether in a village church. ‘He ascended the pulpit and thundered\r\nagainst the abuse of horses in the infantry: he would make an end of\r\nall baggage carried on mules or asses, but most especially of the\r\nofficers’ riding-horses. “Gentlemen,” he cried, “in 1793 we were\r\nallowed a haversack as our only baggage, a stone as our only pillow.”\r\nWell--it was a long time since 1793: we were in 1812, and the speaker,\r\nthis old and gallant soldier, had _six_ baggage mules himself[465].’\r\n\r\n  [465] _Mémoires_ of Lemonnier-Delafosse of the 31st Léger, pp.\r\n  177-8.\r\n\r\nDuring the first ten days after the deadlock on the Douro began, the\r\nFrench were much puzzled by Wellington’s refusal to continue his\r\nadvance. Foy, the ablest of them, noted in his diary that he must\r\nconclude either that the enemy was not numerous enough to take the\r\noffensive--his strength might have been over-valued--or else that he\r\nwas waiting for Hill to bring up his corps from Estremadura. This last\r\nidea, indeed, was running in the brains of many French strategists:\r\nit obsessed Jourdan and King Joseph at Madrid, who were well aware\r\nthat Hill, marching by Alcantara and the passes of the Sierra de Gata,\r\ncould have got to the Douro in half the time that it would have taken\r\nhis opponent, D’Erlon, who would have had to move by Toledo, Madrid,\r\nand Segovia. But the simple explanation is to be found in Wellington’s\r\ndispatch to Lord Bathurst of July 13. ‘It is obvious that we could\r\nnot cross the Douro without sustaining great loss, and could not\r\nfight a general action under circumstances of greater disadvantage....\r\nThe enemy’s numbers are equal, if not superior, to ours: they have in\r\ntheir position thrice the amount of artillery that we have, and we are\r\nsuperior in cavalry alone--which arm (it is probable) could not be used\r\nin the sort of attack we should have to make[466].’ He then proceeds\r\nto demonstrate the absolute necessity of bringing forward the Army of\r\nGalicia against Marmont’s rear. Its absence was the real cause of the\r\ndeadlock in which he found himself involved. All offensive operations\r\nwere postponed--meanwhile the enemy might receive reinforcements and\r\nattack, since he had not been attacked. ‘But I still hope that I shall\r\nbe able to retain, at the close of this campaign, those acquisitions\r\nwhich we made at its commencement.’\r\n\r\n  [466] Wellington to Bathurst. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 284.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Marmont, having had a fortnight to take stock of his\r\nposition, and having received reinforcements which very nearly reached\r\nthe figure that he had named to King Joseph as the minimum which would\r\nenable him to take the offensive, was beginning to get restless.\r\nHe had now realized that he would get no practical assistance from\r\nCaffarelli, who still kept sending him letters exaggerating the terrors\r\nof Sir Home Popham’s raid on Biscay. They said that there were six\r\nships of the line engaged in it, and that there was a landing-force of\r\nBritish regulars: Bonnet’s evacuation of the Asturias had allowed all\r\nthe bands of Cantabria to turn themselves loose on Biscay--Bilbao was\r\nbeing attacked--and so forth. This being so, it was only possible to\r\nsend a brigade of cavalry and a horse artillery battery--anything more\r\nwas useless to ask[467]. This was written on June 26th, but by July\r\n11th not even the cavalry brigade had started from Vittoria, as was\r\nexplained by a subsequent letter, which only reached Marmont after he\r\nhad already started on an offensive campaign[468]. As a matter of fact,\r\nCaffarelli’s meagre contribution of 750 sabres[469] and one battery\r\nactually got off on July 16th[470]. Marmont may be pardoned for having\r\nbelieved that it would never start at all, when it is remembered that a\r\nmonth had elapsed since he first asked for aid, and that every two days\r\nhe had been receiving dispatches of excuse, but no reinforcements. He\r\nhad no adequate reason for thinking that even the trifling force which\r\ndid in the end start out would ever arrive.\r\n\r\n  [467] Caffarelli to Marmont, in the latter’s _Mémoires_, iv. p.\r\n  417.\r\n\r\n  [468] Ibid., pp. 421-2.\r\n\r\n  [469] He sent finally only two regiments, not three as he had\r\n  originally promised.\r\n\r\n  [470] Caffarelli to Marmont, in the latter’s _Mémoires_, iv. p.\r\n  425, announcing their departure.\r\n\r\nNor, as he demonstrates clearly enough in his defence of his\r\noperations, had he any more ground for believing that Joseph and\r\nJourdan would bring him help from Madrid. They resolved to do so in\r\nthe end, and made a vigorous effort to collect as large a force as was\r\npossible. But the announcement of their intention was made too late\r\nto profit Marmont. The dispatch conveying it was sent off from Madrid\r\nonly on July 9th[471], and never reached the Marshal at all, for the\r\ntwo copies of it, sent by separate messengers, were both captured by\r\nguerrilleros between Madrid and Valladolid, and came into Wellington’s\r\ninstead of into Marmont’s hands. This was a consequence of the\r\ninsecurity of the communication via Segovia, the only one route open\r\nwhen the Army of Portugal retired behind the Douro. On July 12th the\r\nlast piece of intelligence from Madrid which Marmont had received was a\r\ndispatch from Jourdan dated June 30th--it had taken twelve days to get\r\n150 miles, which shows the shifts to which its bearer had been exposed.\r\nThis letter is so important, as showing what the King and Jourdan\r\nopined at the moment, that its gist is worth giving.\r\n\r\n  [471] Original is in the Scovell ciphers. It seems to be\r\n  unpublished.\r\n\r\nJourdan begins by complaining that on June 30 the last dispatch from\r\nthe Army of Portugal to hand was sixteen days old, of the date of\r\nJune 14th. It is clear, then, that no copies of the reports sent by\r\nMarmont on June 22 and June 24 had got to Madrid--a circumstance to\r\nbe explained by the fact that Wellington had them instead of their\r\ndestined recipient[472]. Jourdan then proceeds to say that he is\r\ninformed that Wellington has 50,000 men, but only 18,000 of them\r\nBritish. ‘The King thinks that if this is so, you are strong enough to\r\nbeat his army, and would like to know the motives which have prevented\r\nyou from taking the offensive. He charges me to invite you to explain\r\nthem by express messenger.’ In the South it was known that Hill, with\r\n18,000 men, was advancing on June 18th against D’Erlon. That officer\r\nwas to be reinforced from Seville, and was probably at close quarters\r\nwith Hill. The King had sent orders that D’Erlon was to move northward\r\ninto the valley of the Tagus, if Hill marched up to join Wellington.\r\nBut, it being probable that the order would not be very promptly\r\nexecuted, ‘his Majesty would like you to take advantage of the moment,\r\nwhen Wellington has not all his forces in hand, to fight him. The King\r\nhas asked for troops from Marshal Suchet, but they will never be sent.\r\nAll that His Majesty can do at present is to reinforce the garrison of\r\nSegovia, and order its governor, General Espert, to help the garrison\r\nof Avila, if necessary, and to supply it with food.’\r\n\r\n  [472] They are both in the Scovell ciphers, and quoted above, p.\r\n  370.\r\n\r\nThis letter, which clearly gives no hope of immediate help for the\r\nArmy of Portugal from Madrid, and which might be taken as a direct\r\nincitement to bring Wellington to action at once, must be read in\r\nconjunction with the last epistle that Marmont had received from the\r\nsame quarter. This was a letter of the King’s dated June 18. The\r\nimportant paragraph of it runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘If General Hill has remained with his 18,000 men on the left (south)\r\nbank of the Tagus, you ought to be strong enough to beat the English\r\narmy, more especially if you have received any reinforcements from the\r\nArmy of the North. You must choose your battlefield, and make your best\r\ndispositions. But if Hill joins the main English army, I fancy they\r\nare too strong for you. In that case you must manœuvre to gain time. I\r\nshould not hesitate to give you a positive order to defer fighting, if\r\nI were certain that Count D’Erlon and his 15,000 men, and a division\r\nfrom the Army of Aragon, were on their way to you: for on their arrival\r\nthe English army would be seriously compromised. But being wholly\r\nuncertain about them, I must repeat to you that if General Hill is\r\nstill on the south side of the Tagus, you should choose a good position\r\nand give battle with all your troops united: but if General Hill joins\r\nLord Wellington, you must avoid an action as long as possible, in\r\norder to pick up the reinforcements which will certainly reach you in\r\nthe end[473].’\r\n\r\n  [473] Joseph to Marmont, June 18, in Ducasse’s _Correspondance_,\r\n  ix. pp. 28-39.\r\n\r\nI think that there can be no doubt in the mind of any honest\r\ncritic that on the strength of these two dispatches from his\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Marmont was justified in taking the offensive\r\nagainst Wellington, without waiting for that help from Madrid which the\r\nKing had not offered him. Hill being far away, and Wellington having\r\nno more than his own seven divisions of Anglo-Portuguese, Marmont is\r\ndecidedly authorized to bring him to action. The sole factor which the\r\nsecond Madrid dispatch states wrongly, is the proportion of British\r\ntroops in the allied army: Jourdan guesses that there are 50,000 men,\r\nbut only 18,000 British. As a matter of fact there were 49,000 men at\r\nthe moment[474], but about 30,000 were British. This made a difference,\r\nno doubt, and Marmont, if he had been determined to avoid a battle,\r\nmight have pleaded it as his justification. But he was not set on any\r\nsuch timid policy: he had wellnigh attacked Wellington at San Cristobal\r\non June 21st, when he had not yet received his own reinforcements.\r\nWhen Bonnet had come up, and the British had obtained no corresponding\r\naddition to their strength, he was eager to take the offensive, and\r\nJoseph’s and Jourdan’s dispatches distinctly authorized him to do so.\r\n\r\n  [474] Two battalions, the 1/38 and 1/5th, joined before the\r\n  battle of the 22nd, bringing up the total force by 1,500 bayonets\r\n  more.\r\n\r\nAfter the disaster of Salamanca, Napoleon drew up an indictment of\r\nMarmont, of which the three chief heads were:\r\n\r\n(1) He took the offensive without waiting for reinforcements which were\r\nto join him.\r\n\r\n(2) He delivered battle without the authorization of his\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n(3) He might, by waiting only two days longer, before he committed\r\nhimself to a general action, have received at least the cavalry and\r\nguns which he knew that Caffarelli had sent him[475].\r\n\r\n  [475] See the letter of Clarke to Marmont enclosing the Emperor’s\r\n  indictment, in Marmont’s _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 453-4.\r\n\r\nThe very complete answer to these charges is that:\r\n\r\n(1) When the Marshal took the offensive he had no reason to suppose\r\nthat any reinforcements were coming. Caffarelli had excused himself:\r\nthe King had promised succour only if Hill joined Wellington, not\r\notherwise. Hill had never appeared: therefore no help was likely to\r\ncome from the southward.\r\n\r\n(2) He had clear permission from Joseph to give battle, unless Hill\r\nshould have joined Wellington.\r\n\r\n(3) The succours from Caffarelli, a weak cavalry brigade and one\r\nbattery, were so small that their arrival would have made no practical\r\ndifference to the strength of the army. But to have waited two days for\r\nthem, after the campaign had commenced, would have given Wellington\r\nthe opportunity of concentrating, and taking up a good position. It\r\nwas only after the manœuvring had begun [July 15th] that this little\r\nbrigade started from Vittoria, on July 16th. The Army of Portugal had\r\nalready committed itself to offensive operations, and could not halt\r\nfor two days in the midst of them, without losing the initiative.\r\n\r\nFrom his own point of view, then, Marmont was entirely justified in\r\nrecrossing the Douro and assuming the offensive. He had got all the\r\nreinforcements that he could count upon: they made his army practically\r\nequal to Wellington’s in numbers: in homogeneity it was far superior.\r\nIf he had waited a little longer, he might have found 12,000 men of the\r\nArmy of Galicia at his back, setting all Old Castile and Leon aflame.\r\nMoreover Astorga was only victualled up to August 1st, and might fall\r\nany day. He could not have foreseen King Joseph’s unexpected march to\r\nhis aid, which no dispatch received before July 12th rendered likely.\r\nHis misfortune (or fault) was that he undervalued the capacity of\r\nWellington to manœuvre, his readiness to force on an offensive battle,\r\nand (most of all) the fighting value of the Anglo-Portuguese army.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that Marmont’s method of taking the offensive\r\nagainst Wellington was neat and effective. It consisted in a feint\r\nagainst his adversary’s left wing, followed by a sudden countermarch\r\nand a real attack upon his right wing.\r\n\r\nOn July 15th Foy and Bonnet, with the two divisions forming the French\r\nright, received orders to restore the bridge of Toro, to drive in\r\nWellington’s cavalry screen in front of it, and to cross to the south\r\nbank of the Douro. At the same time the divisions of the French\r\ncentre, opposite the fords of Pollos, made an ostentatious move\r\ndown-stream towards Toro, accompanied by the Marshal himself, and those\r\non the left, near Tordesillas, shifted themselves towards Pollos.\r\nAlmost the whole French army was clearly seen marching westward, and\r\nthe two leading divisions were actually across the river next morning,\r\nand seemed to be heading straight for Salamanca by the Toro road.\r\n\r\nWellington was deceived, exactly as Marmont had intended. He drew the\r\nobvious conclusion that his adversary was about to turn his left flank,\r\nand to strike at Salamanca and his line of communications. It would\r\nhave been in his power to make a corresponding move against Valladolid,\r\nMarmont’s base. But his own line of communications meant much more\r\nto him than did Marmont’s. There was a great difference between the\r\nposition of an army living by transport and magazines, and that of an\r\narmy living on the country by plunder, like that of the French marshal.\r\nWellington had always been jealous of his left wing, and as early as\r\nJuly 12 had drawn up an elaborate order of march, providing for the\r\ncontingency of the enemy crossing the Douro at Toro and the ford of\r\nCastro Nuño. If his entire force seemed on the move, the whole British\r\narmy would make a corresponding shift westward--if only a division\r\nor two, the mass transferred would be less in similar proportion. He\r\nhad no idea of defending the actual course of the river: in a letter\r\nwritten a few days later to Lord Bathurst, he remarked that ‘it was\r\ntotally out of my power to prevent the enemy from crossing the Douro\r\nat any point at which he might think it expedient, as he had in his\r\npossession all the bridges [Toro and Tordesillas] and many of the\r\nfords[476].’ His plan was to concentrate against the crossing force,\r\nand fight a defensive action against it, wherever a good position might\r\nbe available.\r\n\r\n  [476] See _Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p. 68.\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for which Wellington regarded a genuine\r\noffensive move of Marmont by Toro and Castro Nuño as probable. The\r\nfirst was that he had received King Joseph’s dispatch of July 9th,\r\ncaptured by guerrilleros, which gave him the startling news that the\r\nKing had resolved to evacuate all New Castile save Madrid and Toledo,\r\nand to march with his field-force of some 14,000 men to join the Army\r\nof Portugal[477]. Wellington wrote to Graham (who was now on his way\r\nhome) early on the 16th, that either the Galicians’ approach on his\r\nrear had induced Marmont to collect his troops near Toro, or he had\r\nheard that Joseph was gathering the Army of the Centre at Madrid, and\r\nwas threatening the allied left ‘in order to prevent us from molesting\r\nthe King.’ It was clear that if Wellington had to shift westward to\r\nprotect his line of communications, he could make no detachment to\r\n‘contain’ King Joseph, who would be approaching from the south-east.\r\nAnother letter, written an hour or so later, says, ‘these movements of\r\nMarmont are certainly intended to divert our attention from the Army\r\nof the Centre (which is collecting at Madrid), if he knows of this\r\ncircumstance, _which I doubt_[478].’ The doubt was well grounded.\r\n\r\n  [477] See _Dispatches_, ix. p. 294.\r\n\r\n  [478] Wellington to Clinton, July 16, 7 a.m. _Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n  291.\r\n\r\nThat the whole movement on Toro was a feint did not occur to\r\nWellington, but his orders of the 16th, given in the evening, after he\r\nhad heard that two French divisions were actually across the Douro on\r\nhis left, provide for the possibility that some serious force may still\r\nremain at Tordesillas and may require observation.\r\n\r\nThe orders direct the transference of the great bulk of the allied\r\narmy to a position which will cover the road Toro-Salamanca. They were\r\nissued in the evening to the following effect. The reserve (1st and\r\n7th Divisions) was to march from Medina del Campo to Alaejos beyond\r\nthe Trabancos river, and subsequently to Canizal and Fuente la Peña\r\nbehind the Guarena river. The left wing, which was watching the fords\r\nof Pollos (3rd Division, Bock’s cavalry, Bradford’s and Carlos de\r\nEspaña’s infantry), to Castrillo on the Guarena. Of the right wing\r\nthe 6th Division and two regiments of Le Marchant’s horse were to\r\nmove on Fuente la Peña, the 5th Division on Canizal. Alten’s cavalry\r\nbrigade was to follow the 1st Division. This left the 4th and Light\r\nDivisions and Anson’s cavalry still unaccounted for. They were set\r\naside to act as a sort of rearguard, being directed to move westward\r\nonly as far as Castrejon on the Trabancos river, ten miles short of the\r\nconcentration-point on the Toro road, to which the rest of the army\r\nwas ordered to proceed. It is clear (though Wellington does not say\r\nso) that they would serve as a containing force, if the enemy had left\r\nany troops at Tordesillas, and brought them over the Douro there, or at\r\nthe fords of Pollos.\r\n\r\nAll these moves were duly executed, and on the morning of the 17th\r\nWellington’s army was getting into position to withstand the expected\r\nadvance of the enemy on Salamanca by the Toro road. This attack,\r\nhowever, failed to make itself felt, and presently news came that the\r\ntwo divisions of Foy and Bonnet, which had crossed the Douro at Toro,\r\nhad gone behind it again, and destroyed their bridge. What Marmont had\r\ndone during the night of the 16th-17th was to reverse the marching\r\norder of his whole army, the rear suddenly becoming the head, and the\r\nhead the rear. The divisions to the eastward, which had not yet got\r\nnear Toro, countermarched on Tordesillas, and crossed its bridge,\r\nwith the light cavalry at their head. Those which had reached Toro\r\nbrought up the rear, and followed, with Foy and Bonnet, at the tail\r\nof the column. This was a most fatiguing march for all concerned, the\r\ndistance from Toro to Tordesillas being about twenty miles, and the\r\noperation being carried out in the night hours. But it was completely\r\nsuccessful--during the morning of the 17th the vanguard, consisting of\r\nClausel’s and Maucune’s divisions and Curto’s _chasseurs à cheval_,\r\nwas pouring over the bridge of Tordesillas and occupying Rueda and La\r\nSeca, which the British had evacuated fifteen hours before. The rest\r\nfollowed, the two rear divisions cutting a corner, and saving a few\r\nmiles, by crossing the ford of Pollos. This was a safe move, when the\r\ncavalry had discovered that there were none of Wellington’s troops\r\nleft east of the Trabancos river. By night on the 17th the bulk of the\r\nFrench army was concentrated at Nava del Rey, ten miles south-west\r\nof Tordesillas. In the afternoon Wellington’s rearguard, the 4th and\r\nLight Divisions, and Anson’s cavalry had been discovered in position at\r\nCastrejon, where their commander had halted them, when he discovered\r\nthat he had been deceived as to his adversary’s purpose. The rest of\r\nthe British army had concentrated, according to orders, in the triangle\r\nCanizal-Castrillo-Fuente la Peña, behind the Guarena river and in front\r\nof the Toro-Salamanca road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SALAMANCA CAMPAIGN]\r\n\r\nWellington’s first task was to drawback his rearguard to join his main\r\nbody, without allowing it to become seriously engaged with the great\r\nmass of French in its front. This he undertook in person, marching at\r\ndaylight with all his disposable cavalry, the brigades of Bock and Le\r\nMarchant, to join the force at Castrejon, while he threw out the 5th\r\nDivision to Torrecilla de la Orden to act as a supporting échelon on\r\nthe flank of the retiring detachment. The remaining divisions (1st,\r\n3rd, 6th, 7th) took up a position in line of battle on the heights\r\nabove the Guarena, ready to receive their comrades when they should\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe charge of the rearguard this day was in the hands of Stapleton\r\nCotton, the senior cavalry officer with the army, who outranked Cole\r\nand Charles Alten, the commanders of the 4th and Light Divisions.\r\nHe had received no orders during the night, and his last, those of\r\nthe preceding afternoon, had directed him to halt, till his chief\r\nshould have discovered the true position and aim of the French army.\r\nWellington explained, in his next dispatch home, that the various\r\ndetails of intelligence, which enabled him to grasp Marmont’s whole\r\nplan, did not reach him till so late on the 17th that it was useless to\r\nsend Cotton orders to start. They could only be carried out at dawn,\r\nand he himself intended to be present with the rearguard before the sun\r\nwas far above the horizon. He arrived at seven o’clock in the morning,\r\nin time to find his lieutenant already engaged with the French van, but\r\nnot committed to any dangerous close fighting. Cotton had, very wisely,\r\nsent out patrols before daylight to discover exactly what was in front\r\nof him; if it was only a trifling body he intended to drive it in, and\r\nadvance towards La Nava and Rueda[479]; if Marmont was in force he\r\nwould take up a defensive position at Castrejon, and wait for further\r\norders.\r\n\r\n  [479] See report of one of the officers commanding patrols,\r\n  Tomkinson of the 16th L.D. in the latter’s _Memoirs_, p. 180.\r\n\r\nThe patrols soon ran into French cavalry advancing in force, and were\r\ndriven back upon Anson’s brigade, which was drawn up on a long front in\r\nadvance of the village of Castrejon. On seeing it, the enemy brought up\r\ntwo batteries of horse artillery, and began to play upon the scattered\r\nsquadrons. Bull’s and Ross’s troops[480] were ordered out to reply, and\r\ndid so with effect, but the total strength of the French cavalry was\r\ntoo great, and Anson’s regiments had presently to give way, though not\r\nso much owing to the pressure on their front as to the sight of a large\r\ncolumn of French infantry turning the left of their line, and marching\r\non Alaejos, with the obvious intention of getting round to their left\r\nrear and molesting their retreat towards the Guarena, where the main\r\nbody of the British army was awaiting them.\r\n\r\n  [480] Belonging one to the cavalry, the other to the Light\r\n  Division.\r\n\r\nWellington was involved in person in the end of the cavalry bickering,\r\nand in no very pleasant fashion. He and Beresford, with their staffs,\r\nhad arrived on the field about seven o’clock, in advance of the two\r\nheavy cavalry brigades, who were coming up to reinforce Cotton. He\r\nrode forward to the left of the skirmishing line, where two squadrons,\r\none of the 11th and one of the 12th Light Dragoons, were supporting\r\ntwo guns of Ross’s troop, on high ground above the ravine of the\r\nTrabancos river. Just as the Commander-in-Chief came on the scene,\r\na squadron of French cavalry, striking in from the flank, rode at\r\nthe guns, not apparently seeing the supporting troops. They met and\r\nbroke the squadron of the 12th Light Dragoons, which came up the hill\r\nto intercept them. ‘Some of Marshal Beresford’s staff, seeing this,\r\nand conceiving the guns to be in danger, rode up to the retiring\r\nsquadron calling “Threes about[481]!”’ This unfortunately was heard by\r\nthe supporting squadron of the 11th, who, imagining the order to be\r\ndirected to themselves, went about and retired, instead of advancing\r\nto relieve their broken comrades above. Therefore the mass of pursuers\r\nand pursued from the combat on the flank, came hurtling down on the\r\nguns, and on the head-quarters staff just behind them. Wellington and\r\nBeresford and their followers were swept away in the rout, and had to\r\ndraw their swords to defend themselves. Fortunately the misdirected\r\nsquadron of the 11th soon saw their mistake; they halted and turned,\r\nand falling on the scattered and exhausted French dragoons drove them\r\nback with great loss; few, it is said, except their _chef d’escadron_,\r\nwho showed uncommon gallantry, got away[482]. It was a dangerous moment\r\nfor the allied army--a chance thrust in the _mêlée_ might have killed\r\nor disabled Wellington, and have thrown the command into the hands of\r\nBeresford or Stapleton Cotton.\r\n\r\n  [481] Tomkinson, p. 188.\r\n\r\n  [482] Compare Tomkinson’s narrative of this incident (pp.\r\n  180-1) with Napier’s vivid and well-told tale (iv. pp. 254-5).\r\n  Both agree that the French were inferior in numbers to the two\r\n  squadrons, and that there was deplorable confusion.\r\n\r\nWellington had no sooner detected the flank movement of Marmont’s\r\ninfantry towards Alaejos, than he ordered the 4th and Light Divisions\r\nto retire towards the Guarena, covered by G. Anson’s brigade, while\r\nBock’s and Le Marchant’s heavy dragoons, farther to the left, drew\r\nup in front of the infantry of the turning column, and detained it,\r\nretiring, when pressed, by alternate brigades. Marmont’s whole army was\r\nnow visible, moving on in two long columns, of which the more southern\r\nfollowed the 4th and Light Divisions, in the direction of Torrecilla\r\nde la Orden, and tried to come up with their rear, while the other,\r\npassing through Alaejos, made by the high-road for Castrillo on the\r\nGuarena, where the British reserves were posted.\r\n\r\nThere was a long bickering fight across the eight miles of rolling\r\nground between the Trabancos and the Guarena, not without some exciting\r\nmoments for Wellington’s rearguard. After passing Torrecilla de la\r\nOrden, and picking up there the 5th Division, which had been waiting\r\nas a supporting échelon to cover their southern flank, all the British\r\ninfantry had to march very hard, for troops diverging from the northern\r\nFrench column got close in upon their right, and, moving parallel with\r\nthem, bid fair to reach the Guarena first. In the retreat the 4th\r\nDivision moved on the right, and was therefore most exposed, the Light\r\nDivision next them, the 5th Division farther south and more distant\r\nfrom the turning column of the French. The cavalry pursuit in the rear\r\nof the retreating force was never really dangerous: it was held off\r\nby Le Marchant’s Heavy and Anson’s Light Dragoons without any great\r\ndifficulty, and the 5th and Light Divisions only suffered from some\r\ndistant shelling by the French horse artillery. But the 4th Division,\r\nthough covered from the pursuit in their direct rear by Bock’s German\r\nsquadrons, found a dangerous point about a mile on the near side of\r\nthe Guarena, where two batteries from the French turning column had\r\ngalloped forward to a knoll, commanding the ground over which they\r\nhad to pass, and opened a teasing fire upon the flank of the brigades\r\nas they marched by. General Cole, however, threw out his divisional\r\nbattery and all his light companies to form a screen against their\r\nattack, and moved on, protected by their fire, without turning from\r\nhis route. The covering force fell in to the rear when the defiling\r\nwas over, and the division suffered small loss from its uncomfortable\r\nmarch[483].\r\n\r\n  [483] See Vere’s _Marches and Movements of the 4th Division_, p.\r\n  28. Napier’s statement that the Light Division was more exposed\r\n  than the 4th or 5th during the retreat, seems to be discounted\r\n  by the fact that it had not one man killed or wounded--the 5th\r\n  Division had only two (in the 3rd Royal Scots), the 4th Division\r\n  over 200; and though most of them fell in the last charge, a good\r\n  number were hit in the retreat.\r\n\r\nWellington allowed all the three retreating divisions to halt for a\r\nmoment on the farther side of the stream, at the bottom of the trough\r\nin which it runs. ‘The halt near the water, short as it was, gave\r\nrefreshment and rest to the troops, after a rapid march over an arid\r\ncountry in extremely hot weather[484].’ But it could not be allowed\r\nto last for more than a very few minutes, for the pursuing enemy soon\r\nappeared in force at several points on the heights above the eastern\r\nbank of the Guarena, and many batteries opened successively on the\r\nthree divisions, who were of necessity compelled to resume their march\r\nup the slope to the crest, on their own side of the water. Here they\r\nfell into position on Wellington’s chosen defensive fighting-ground,\r\nthe 4th Division forming the extreme northern section of the battle\r\narray, by the village of Castrillo, the Light and 5th Divisions falling\r\nin to the line of troops already drawn up in front of Canizal, while\r\nthe 1st and 7th Divisions were extended to the south, to form the new\r\nright wing, and took their place on the heights of Vallesa, above the\r\nvillage and ford of El Olmo.\r\n\r\n  [484] Vere’s _Marches and Movements of the 4th Division_, p. 28.\r\n\r\nSome anxious hours had been spent while the retreat was in progress,\r\nbut Wellington was now safe, with every man concentrated on an\r\nexcellent position, where he was prepared to accept the defensive\r\nbattle for which he had been waiting for the last month. It seemed\r\nlikely at first that his wish might be granted, for the French made a\r\nvigorous attack upon his left wing, almost before it had got settled\r\ndown into its appointed ground. It would appear that General Clausel,\r\nwho commanded the more northerly of the two great columns in which the\r\nFrench army was advancing (while Marmont himself was with the other),\r\nthought that he saw his chance of carrying the heights above Castrillo\r\nand turning the allied left, if he attacked at once, before the 4th\r\nDivision had been granted time to array itself at leisure. Accordingly,\r\nwithout wasting time by sending to ask permission from his chief, he\r\ndirected a brigade of dragoons to outflank Cole’s left by crossing the\r\nGuarena down-stream, while Brennier’s division passed it at Castrillo\r\nand assailed the front of the 4th Division. Clausel’s own division\r\nadvanced in support of Brennier’s.\r\n\r\nThis move brought on very sharp fighting: the turning movement of the\r\nFrench dragoons was promptly met by Victor Alten’s brigade [14th Light\r\nDragoons, 1st Hussars K.G.L.], whose squadrons had been watching the\r\nlower fords of the Guarena all day. Alten allowed the hostile cavalry\r\nto cross the river and come up the slope, and then charged suddenly,\r\nin échelon of squadrons, the left squadron of the 1st Hussars K.G.L.\r\nleading[485]. The enemy had only begun to deploy when he was attacked,\r\nAlten’s advance having been too rapid for him. The two French regiments\r\n(15th and 25th Dragoons) were, after a stiff fight, completely routed\r\nand driven downhill with great loss, till they finally found refuge\r\nbehind a half-battery and an infantry battalion which formed their\r\nsupports. General Carrié, commanding the two regiments, was taken\r\nprisoner by a German hussar, having got cut off from his men in the\r\nflight. The French lost in all 8 officers and more than 150 men, of\r\nwhom 94 were prisoners--mostly wounded. How sharp the clash was may be\r\nseen from the fact that Alten’s victorious brigade had not much fewer\r\ncasualties--the 14th Light Dragoons lost 75 killed and wounded, the\r\nGerman hussars 60[486]. But no doubt some of these losses were suffered\r\nnot in the cavalry combat, but a little later in the day, when Alten\r\ncharged the French infantry[487].\r\n\r\n  [485] Brotherton of the 14th L.D. says with the _right_ échelon\r\n  advanced (Hamilton’s _History of the 14th_, p. 107), but I fancy\r\n  that the German Hussars’ version that the _left_ échelon led is\r\n  correct, as the right squadron of their regiment would have been\r\n  in the middle of the brigade, not on a flank. See narrative in\r\n  Schwertfeger, i. pp. 368-9.\r\n\r\n  [486] These are the official returns. The regimental histories\r\n  give only 45 and 56 respectively.\r\n\r\n  Martinien’s lists show six casualties in officers in the two\r\n  French regiments, and two more were taken prisoners, General\r\n  Carrié and a lieutenant of the 25th Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [487] Brotherton says that the first two squadrons which charged\r\n  the French dragoons made no impression, and that it was the\r\n  impact of the third, led by himself, which broke them.\r\n\r\nWhile this lively fight was in progress on the flank, Brennier’s\r\ndivision had crossed the Guarena in a mass, and on a very short front,\r\napparently in three columns of regiments, battalion behind battalion.\r\nThey were ascending the lower slopes below Cole’s position, when\r\nWellington, who was present here in person, suddenly took the offensive\r\nagainst them, sending W. Anson’s brigade (3/27th and 1/40th) against\r\nthem in line, with Stubbs’s Portuguese (11th and 23rd regiments)\r\nsupporting, in columns of quarter distance. The French division halted,\r\napparently with the intention of deploying--but there was no time for\r\nthis. The line of Anson’s brigade enveloped both the hostile flanks\r\nwith its superior frontage, and opened fire: after a short resistance\r\nthe French gave way in great disorder, and streamed down to the\r\nGuarena. As they fled Alten let loose part of his brigade against their\r\nflank: the horsemen rode in deep among the fugitives, and cut off 6\r\nofficers and 240 men as prisoners. Clausel had to bring up a regiment\r\nof his own division to cover the broken troops as they repassed the\r\nriver; it suffered severely from Cole’s artillery, losing 6 officers\r\nkilled and wounded, and many men[488].\r\n\r\n  [488] This was the 25th Léger.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to take liberties with Wellington’s army, when it had\r\nassumed the defensive on favourable ground, had thus failed in the\r\nmost lamentable style, and with very heavy loss--at least 700 men\r\nhad been killed, wounded, or taken in Marmont’s army that day, and\r\nall but a few scores belonged to the four infantry and two cavalry\r\nregiments which Clausel sent to attack the heights by Castrillo[489].\r\nThe corresponding British loss that day was 525, including about 50\r\nstragglers taken prisoners during the retreat from the Trabancos to\r\nthe Guarena, because they had fallen behind their regiments--foot-sore\r\ninfantry, or troopers whose horses had been shot. The cavalry, which\r\nhad so successfully covered the long march across the open, had a\r\ncertain amount of casualties, but the only units that had suffered\r\nheavily were the four regiments--horse and foot--that dealt with\r\nClausel’s attack, who lost 276 men between them.\r\n\r\n  [489] The exact figures, save for officers, are as usual missing.\r\n  But Martinien’s invaluable lists show that of 41 French officers\r\n  killed, wounded, or taken that day, 35 belonged to the four\r\n  infantry regiments (17th and 25th Léger, 22nd and 65th Line) and\r\n  the two cavalry regiments (15th and 25th Dragoons) which fought\r\n  at Castrillo.\r\n\r\nWellington must have felt much disappointment at seeing Clausel’s\r\noffensive move at Castrillo unsupported by the rest of the French\r\ndivisions, who were lining the farther bank of the Guarena parallel\r\nwith the whole of his front. But Marmont, unlike his venturesome\r\nsubordinate, nourished no illusions about the advisability of attacking\r\na British army in position. He made no move in the afternoon; in his\r\nmemoirs he points out that the infantry was absolutely exhausted,\r\nhaving been continuously on the march for three days and one night.\r\n\r\nThis day had been a disappointing one for the French marshal also. He\r\nhad failed to cut off Wellington’s two detached divisions, so that all\r\nthe advantage which he had obtained by his marches and countermarches\r\nbetween Toro and Tordesillas was now exhausted. The allied army\r\nhad succeeded in concentrating, and was now drawn up in his front,\r\ncovering Salamanca and its own line of communications in a very tenable\r\nposition. Napier truly remarks that, since the attempt to isolate and\r\ndestroy Cotton’s detachment had miscarried, Marmont had gained no more\r\nby his elaborate feint and forced marches than he would have obtained\r\nby continuing his original advance across Toro bridge on the 16th. He\r\nhad got the whole Anglo-Portuguese army arrayed in a defensive position\r\nin front of him, on the line of the Guarena, instead of somewhere in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Fuente Sauco, a few miles farther east.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th July it seemed as if a new deadlock was\r\nto bring the campaign to a standstill, for the two armies continued\r\nto face each other across the Guarena, Wellington hoping rather than\r\nexpecting to be attacked, Marmont looking in vain for a weak point\r\nbetween Castrillo and Vallesa, where it would be worth while to try a\r\nforward thrust. While he was reconnoitring, his weary infantry got a\r\nmuch-needed rest. At about four o’clock in the afternoon, however, the\r\nwhole French army was seen falling into column, and presently edged off\r\nsouthward till it lay between Tarazona and Cantalapiedra. Wellington\r\nthereupon made a corresponding movement, evacuating Castrillo to\r\nthe north, and extending his line of battle beyond Vallesa to the\r\nsouth. There was a little distant cannonading across the valley of\r\nthe Guarena, and some of the shells set fire to the vast fields of\r\nripe wheat which covered the whole country-side in this region. The\r\nconflagration went rolling on for a long way across the plain, leaving\r\na trail of smoke behind.\r\n\r\nThe situation on this evening had nothing decisive about it. It was\r\nclear that neither side intended to fight save at an advantage. Marmont\r\nhad shown himself more cautious than had been expected. Wellington\r\nhad at this moment every motive for risking nothing, unless the\r\nenemy proved more obliging than he had shown himself hitherto. He\r\nhad reasons for self-restraint at this moment of which his adversary\r\nknew nothing. The first was that he was aware (from intercepted\r\ndispatches) of King Joseph’s intention to march from Madrid to join\r\nthe Army of Portugal: with a possible 15,000 men about to appear on\r\nhis flank, he must look to the future with care. The second was that\r\nhe had received a few days before the untoward news that Lord William\r\nBentinck’s long-promised expedition to Catalonia might not ever take\r\nplace. The Commander-in-Chief in Sicily wrote that he had found new\r\nopportunities in Italy, which it might be his duty to seize. His troops\r\nhad been embarked, but they were not to be expected for the present off\r\nthe coast of Spain. This was a disheartening piece of intelligence:\r\nWellington had been told to count upon this support both by Bentinck\r\nhimself and by the Home Government. If it should fail, Marshal\r\nSuchet, left undisturbed by this diversion, might send considerable\r\nreinforcements to Madrid[490].\r\n\r\n  [490] For dismay expressed by Wellington at this news see\r\n  dispatches to Henry Wellesley dated Rueda, July 15, and to Lord\r\n  Bathurst (_Dispatches_, ix. pp. 285 and 287).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact he did not--being, like Soult, a general of much\r\ntoo self-centred a type of mind to help a neighbour if he could avoid\r\nit. Only one regiment of the Valencian army ever got to Madrid, and\r\nthat came too late for King Joseph’s purpose. But so far as Wellington\r\ncould guess on July 19, it was quite possible that Suchet might find\r\n10,000 men, to add to the disposable 15,000 of the Army of the Centre.\r\n\r\nThere was also the possibility that D’Erlon, obeying the orders which\r\nKing Joseph kept sending to him, might make up his mind to cross the\r\nGuadiana and Tagus, and come north by Arzobispo and Madrid. If so, Hill\r\nwas to make a parallel march by Alcantara, and would certainly arrive\r\nmany days before D’Erlon. This was a mere possibility; there were good\r\nreasons for holding that Soult might forbid any such move; and till\r\nD’Erlon started northward, Hill must remain behind to contain him. The\r\nproblem was not pressing: it could not develop for many days[491].\r\n\r\n  [491] See Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 290.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there was news that the Galicians were at last on\r\nthe move. Santocildes had been prevailed upon to leave a smaller force\r\nto besiege Astorga, and had come down with a second division to join\r\nCabrera at Benavente. This force, advancing up the Douro valley, would\r\nfind absolutely no enemy in front of it, and must obviously disturb\r\nMarmont’s operations, since it might be at the gates of Valladolid,\r\nhis base and storehouse, in a few days. He would then be forced to\r\ndetach a division or so to save his dépôts, and he could not spare\r\neven a brigade if he wished to continue on the offensive. Certain\r\nintelligence that there was not a Frenchman left behind on the Douro,\r\nsave the trifling garrisons of Toro, Zamora, and Tordesillas, had been\r\nbrought in by General D’Urban. That officer, after conducting a very\r\ndaring exploration round the rear of Marmont’s army, almost to the\r\ngates of Valladolid, had recrossed the Douro by Wellington’s orders\r\nat the ford of Fresno de Ribera, and fell in upon the left flank of\r\nthe allied army near Fuente Sauco on July 18th[492]. For the rest of\r\nthe campaign his 700 sabres were at Wellington’s disposal[493]. His\r\nreport showed that Marmont’s rear was absolutely undefended, and that\r\nthe Galicians could march up the Douro, if desired, without finding any\r\nopponents: it would be perfectly possible for them to cut all Marmont’s\r\ncommunications with Valladolid and Burgos, without being in any danger\r\nunless the Marshal detached men against them.\r\n\r\n  [492] Not July 17th, as Napier says. D’Urban’s diary proves that\r\n  he recrossed the Douro on the 18th.\r\n\r\n  [493] He left one squadron near Zamora, to serve as covering\r\n  cavalry for Silveira’s militia, who remained waiting for\r\n  Santocildes’s advance, which they were to observe and support.\r\n  His force was therefore reduced to 700 men.\r\n\r\nThe 20th of July proved to be a most interesting day of manœuvring,\r\nbut still brought no decisive results. Early in the morning the whole\r\nFrench army was seen in march, with its head pointing southward,\r\ncontinuing the movement that it had begun on the previous day. Marmont\r\nhad made up his mind to proceed with the hitherto unsuccessful scheme\r\nfor turning his adversary’s right wing[494], in the hope of either\r\ncutting him off from his communication with Salamanca, or of catching\r\nhim with his army strung out on too long a line from continuous and\r\nrapid movement. The character of this day’s march differed from that\r\nof the 19th, because the single well-marked Guarena valley ceased\r\nafter a time to separate the two hostile armies. That little river is\r\nformed by three tributaries which meet at and above the village of\r\nEl Olmo: each of them is a paltry brook, and their courses lie along\r\ntrifling irregularities of the broad tableland from which they descend.\r\nIt is only after their junction that they flow in a deep well-marked\r\nvalley, and form a real military obstacle. Of the three brooks, that\r\nwhich keeps the name of Guarena lies most to the east: up its right\r\nbank and towards its source Marmont’s march was directed. Wellington’s\r\nparallel movement southward, on the other hand, was directed along the\r\nleft bank of the Poreda, the middle brook of the three. Between them\r\nthere was at first a narrow triangular plateau, on which neither party\r\ntrespassed save with cavalry scouts.\r\n\r\n  [494] He adds in his _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 251-2, that if he had\r\n  not succeeded in getting ahead of Wellington’s van, he had a\r\n  counter-project of trying to get round his rear, but the British\r\n  marched so exactly parallel with him that he got no chance of\r\n  this.\r\n\r\nAfter a few miles of marching Marmont ordered his advanced guard to\r\ncross the Guarena, which they could do with ease, no British being\r\nnear, save a few cavalry vedettes. He then turned the head of his\r\ncolumn south-westward, instead of keeping to his original direction\r\ndue south. Having crossed the Guarena he came in sight of the British\r\ncolumn marching on the other side of the Poreda brook from Vallesa. The\r\nmovements of the two armies tended to converge, the point on which both\r\nwere moving being the village of Cantalpino. It seemed likely that the\r\nheads of the marching columns must collide, and that a combat, if not\r\na general action, would ensue. Each army was marching in an order that\r\ncould be converted into a battle line by simply facing the men to right\r\nor to left respectively. Wellington had his troops in three parallel\r\ncolumns, the first one, that nearest to the French, being composed\r\nof the 1st, 4th, 5th, and Light Divisions, the second, which would\r\nhave formed the supporting line if the army had fronted and gone into\r\naction, contained the 6th and 7th and Pack’s and Bradford’s brigades:\r\nthe 3rd Division and España’s Spaniards formed a reserve, moving\r\nfarthest from the enemy. The light cavalry were marching ahead of the\r\ncolumn, the heavy cavalry and D’Urban’s Portuguese brought up their\r\nrear. Marmont was clearly seen to be moving in a similar formation,\r\nof two columns each composed of four infantry divisions, with Curto’s\r\n_chasseurs_ ahead, and Boyer’s dragoons at the tail of the line of\r\nmarch[495].\r\n\r\n  [495] Marmont describes the formation (_Mémoires_, iv. p. 252) as\r\n  ‘gauche en tête, par peloton, à distance entière: les deux lignes\r\n  pouvaient être formées en un instant par _à droite en bataille_.’\r\n\r\nThe day was warm but clouded, so that the sun did not shine with full\r\nJuly strength, or the long march which both armies carried out would\r\nhave been brought to an end by exhaustion at a much earlier hour than\r\nwas actually the case. As the long morning wore on, the two hostile\r\nforces gradually grew closer to each other, owing to the new westward\r\nturn which Marmont had given to his van. At last they were within\r\nlong artillery range; but for some time no shot was fired, neither\r\nparty being willing to take the responsibility of attacking an enemy\r\nin perfect order and well closed up for battle. Either general could\r\nhave brought on a fight, by simply fronting to flank, in ten minutes;\r\nbut neither did so. Marmont remarks in his _Mémoires_ that in his long\r\nmilitary service he never, before or after, saw such a magnificent\r\nspectacle as this parallel march of two bodies of over 40,000 men each,\r\nat such close quarters. Both sides kept the most admirable order, no\r\ngaps occurred in either line, nor was the country one that offered\r\nadvantage to either: it was very nearly flat, and the depression of the\r\nPoreda brook became at last so slight and invisible that it was crossed\r\nwithout being noticed. The ground, however, on which the French were\r\nmoving was a little higher than that on which the allies marched[496].\r\n\r\n  [496] There is an excellent description of the parallel march in\r\n  Leith Hay, ii. pp. 38-40, as well as in Napier.\r\n\r\nThe converging lines of advance at last almost touched each other at\r\nthe village of Cantalpino: the light cavalry and the 1st Division, at\r\nthe head of Wellington’s front (or eastern) column of march had just\r\npassed through it, when Marmont halted several batteries on a roll of\r\nthe ground a few hundred yards off, and began to shell the leading\r\nbattalions of the 4th Division, which was following closely behind the\r\n1st. Wellington ordered Cole not to halt and reply, nor to attack, but\r\nto avoid the village and the French fire by a slight westerly turn, to\r\nwhich the other divisions conformed, both those in the first and those\r\nin the second line[497]. This amounted to the refusing of battle, and\r\nmany officers wondered that the challenge of Marmont had been refused:\r\nfor the army was in perfect order for fighting, and in excellent\r\nspirits. But Wellington was taking no risks that day.\r\n\r\n  [497] This swerve and its consequence are best stated in Vere’s\r\n  _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 30.\r\n\r\nThe slight swerve from the direct southerly direction at Cantalpino\r\nmade by the allied army, distinctly helped Marmont’s plan for turning\r\nits right, since by drawing back from its original line of movement it\r\nallowed the enemy to push still farther westward than his original\r\nline of march had indicated. This meant that he was gradually getting\r\nsouth of Wellington’s vanguard, and would, if not checked, ultimately\r\narrive at the Tormes river, near the fords of Huerta, from which he\r\nwould have been edged off, if both armies had continued in their\r\noriginal direction. During the early afternoon the parallel move\r\ncontinued, with a little skirmishing between cavalry vedettes, and an\r\noccasional outbreak of artillery fire, but no further developments. The\r\nbaggage in the English rear began to trail behind somewhat, owing to\r\nthe long continuance of the forced marching, and D’Urban’s Portuguese,\r\nwho shepherded the stragglers, had great difficulty in keeping them\r\non the move. A few score sick and foot-sore men, and some exhausted\r\nsumpter-beasts, fell behind altogether, and were abandoned to the\r\nFrench[498].\r\n\r\n  [498] Marmont says that if he had possessed a superior cavalry\r\n  he could have made great captures, but he dared attempt nothing\r\n  for want of sufficient numbers: he alleges that he took 300\r\n  stragglers--certainly an exaggeration as the British returns show\r\n  very few ‘missing.’ _Mémoires_, iv. p. 233.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the armies fell further apart, and all save the\r\noutlying vedettes lost sight of each other. This was due to the fact\r\nthat Wellington had made up his mind to settle down for the night\r\non the heights of Cabeza Vellosa and Aldea Rubia, where Marmont had\r\ntaken up his position a month before, when he retired from before San\r\nCristobal. This was good fighting-ground, on which it was improbable\r\nthat the French would dare to deliver an attack. The 6th Division and\r\nAlten’s cavalry brigade were detached to the rear, and occupied Aldea\r\nLengua and its fords.\r\n\r\nThis had been a most fatiguing day--the British army had marched,\r\npractically in battle formation, not less than four Spanish leagues,\r\nthe French, by an extraordinary effort, more than five. When the\r\ncamp-fires were lighted up at night, it was seen that the leading\r\ndivisions of the enemy were as far south as Babila Fuente, quite\r\nclose to the Tormes and the fords of Huerta: the main body lay about\r\nVillaruela, opposite the British bivouacs at Aldea Rubia and Cabeza\r\nVellosa. An untoward incident terminated an unsatisfactory day:\r\nD’Urban’s Portuguese horse coming in very late from their duty of\r\ncovering the baggage-train, were mistaken for prowling French cavalry\r\nby the 3rd Division, and shelled by its battery, with some little loss\r\nof men and horses. The mistake was caused by a certain similarity in\r\ntheir uniform to that of French dragoons--the tall helmets with crests\r\nbeing worn by no other allied troops[499].\r\n\r\n  [499] The heavy cavalry in the British army were still wearing\r\n  the old cocked hat, the new-pattern helmet with crest was not\r\n  served out till 1813. The light dragoons were still wearing the\r\n  black-japanned leather headdress with the low fur crest: in 1813\r\n  they got shakos, much too like those of French _chasseurs_.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the long parallel march of July 20th was that\r\nMarmont had practically turned Wellington’s extreme right, and was\r\nin a position to cross the Upper Tormes, if he should choose, in\r\nprolongation of his previous movement. The allied army was still\r\ncovering Salamanca, and could do so for one day more, if the marching\r\ncontinued: but after that limit of time it would be forced either to\r\nfight or to abandon Salamanca, the main trophy of its earlier campaign.\r\nThere remained the chance of falling upon Marmont’s rear, when his army\r\nshould be occupied in crossing the Tormes, and forcing him to fight\r\nwith his forces divided by the river. If this offensive move were not\r\ntaken, and the parallel march were allowed to continue, the next day\r\nwould see the armies both across the Tormes, in the position where\r\nGraham and Marmont had demonstrated against each other on June 24th.\r\nWellington could not, however, begin his southward move till he was\r\ncertain that the enemy was about to continue his manœuvre on the same\r\nplan as that of the last two days. If he started too early, Marmont\r\nmight attack the San Cristobal position when it was only held by a\r\nrearguard, and capture Salamanca. Till an appreciable fraction of the\r\nFrench were seen passing the Tormes it was necessary to wait.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to Wellington that his adversary’s most probable move would\r\nbe the passage of the Tormes by the fords at and just above Huerta.\r\nThat he would abandon his previous tactics, and attack the British\r\narmy, was inconsistent with the caution that he had hitherto displayed.\r\nThat he would continue his march southward, and cross the river\r\nhigher up, was unlikely; for the obvious passage in this direction,\r\nby the bridge of Alba de Tormes, was commanded by the castle of that\r\ntown, which had been for some time occupied by a battalion detached\r\nfrom Carlos de España’s division. Wellington looked upon this route\r\nas completely barred to the French: he was unaware that the Spanish\r\ngeneral had withdrawn his detachment without orders on the preceding\r\nafternoon. This astonishing move of his subordinate was made all the\r\nworse by the fact that he never informed his chief that he had taken\r\nupon himself to remove the battalion. Indeed Wellington only heard\r\nof its disappearance on the 23rd, when it was too late to remedy the\r\nfault. He acted on the 21st and 22nd as if Alba de Tormes were securely\r\nheld. It would appear that Carlos de España thought the castle too weak\r\nto be held by a small force, and moved his men, in order to secure\r\nthem from being cut off from the main army, as they clearly might be\r\nwhen the French had reached Babila Fuente. But the importance of his\r\nmisplaced act was not to emerge till after the battle of Salamanca had\r\nbeen fought.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 21st Wellington withdrew his whole army on to the San\r\nCristobal position[500], and waited for further developments, having\r\nthe fords of Aldea Lengua and Santa Marta conveniently close if Marmont\r\nshould be seen crossing the Tormes. This indeed was the move to which\r\nthe Marshal committed himself. Having discovered at an early hour that\r\nAlba de Tormes was empty, and that there was no allied force observing\r\nthe river bank below it, he began to cross in two columns, one at the\r\nfords of Huerta, the other three miles higher up-stream at the ford of\r\nLa Encina. Lest Wellington should sally out upon his rear, when the\r\ngreater part of his army had got beyond the Tormes, he left a covering\r\nforce of two divisions in position between Babila Fuente and Huerta.\r\nThis, as the day wore on, he finally reduced to one division[501] and\r\nsome artillery. As long as this detachment remained opposite him,\r\nWellington could not be sure that the French might not attack him on\r\nboth sides of the Tormes.\r\n\r\n  [500] Napier says that this move was made on the night of the\r\n  20th, under cover of the smoke of the already-lighted camp-fires\r\n  of the army. This is contradicted by Vere’s journal of march of\r\n  the 4th Division, by Leith Hay’s Journal [’at daylight we marched\r\n  to the Heights of San Cristoval’], by Tomkinson’s diary, and\r\n  D’Urban, Geo. Simonds, and many others who speak of the move as\r\n  being early on the 21st.\r\n\r\n  [501] This was the division of Sarrut.\r\n\r\nThe defile of the French army across the fords naturally took a long\r\ntime, and Wellington was able to allow his weary infantry some hours\r\nof much-needed rest in the morning. Only cavalry was sent forward at\r\nonce, to form a screen in front of the hostile force that was gradually\r\naccumulating on the near side of the fords. In the afternoon, however,\r\nwhen the greater part of the French were over the water, nearly the\r\nwhole allied army received orders to cross the Tormes, and occupy the\r\nheights to the south of it. It moved practically in battle order,\r\nin two lines, of which the front passed by the ford of Cabrerizos,\r\nthe second by that of Santa Marta. Only a reserve, now consisting\r\nof the 3rd Division and D’Urban’s Portuguese horse, remained on the\r\nnorth side of the river near Cabrerizos, to contain the French force\r\nwhich was still visible at dusk on the slopes by Babila Fuente. Till\r\nthis detachment had disappeared, Wellington was obliged to leave a\r\ncorresponding proportion of his men to contain it, lest the enemy\r\nmight try a dash at Salamanca by the north bank. Marmont made no such\r\nattempt, and in the morning it was obvious that this rearguard was\r\nfollowing the rest of his army across the Tormes.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the French advanced cavalry were holding Calvarisa\r\nde Ariba on their left and Machacon on their right: the infantry\r\nwere bivouacked in a concentrated position in the wooded country\r\nsouth of those villages. The British cavalry screen held Calvarisa de\r\nAbaxo[502], Pelabravo, and the height of Nuestra Señora de la Peña,\r\nclose in to the corresponding front line of the enemy’s vedettes. The\r\ninfantry were encamped in two lines behind the Ribera de Pelagarcia,\r\nthe ravine, which runs north from Nuestra Señora de la Peña to the\r\nTormes, between Santa Marta and Cabrerizos. This was Graham’s old\r\nposition of June 24th, and excellent for defence. The right was on\r\nwell-marked high ground, the centre was covered by woods. Only the\r\nleft, near Santa Marta, was on lower slopes.\r\n\r\n  [502] That the British cavalry were still at dawn so far forward\r\n  as Calvarisa de Abaxo is shown by Tomkinson’s diary (p. 185),\r\n  the best possible authority for light cavalry matters. The 4th\r\n  Division camped in the wood just west of Nuestra Señora de la\r\n  Peña (Vere, p. 31), the 5th on high ground in rear of Calvarisa\r\n  de Ariba (Leith Hay, p. 45), the 7th a little farther south, also\r\n  in woody ground (diary of Wheeler of the 51st).\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after nightfall the hills where French and English\r\nlay opposite each other were visited by an appalling tempest. ‘The\r\nrain fell in torrents accompanied by vivid flashes of lightning, and\r\nsucceeded by instantaneous peals of thunder:’ writes one annalist:\r\n‘a more violent crash of the elements has seldom been witnessed: its\r\neffects were soon apparent. Le Marchands brigade of cavalry had halted\r\nto our left: the men, dismounted, were either seated or lying on the\r\nground, holding their horses’ bridles. Alarmed by the thunder, the\r\nbeasts started with a sudden violence, and many of them breaking loose\r\ngalloped across the country in all directions. The frightened horses,\r\nin a state of wildness, passing by without riders, added to the awful\r\neffect of the tempest[503].’ The 5th Dragoon Guards suffered most by\r\nthe stampede--eighteen men were hurt, and thirty-one horses were not\r\nto be found. Another diarist speaks of the splendid effect of the\r\nlightning reflected on the musket-barrels of belated infantry columns,\r\nwhich were just marching to their camping-ground. Before midnight the\r\nstorm had passed over--the later hours of sleep were undisturbed, and\r\nnext morning a brilliant sun rose into a cloudless sky[504]. The last\r\nday of manœuvring was begun, and the battle which both sides had so\r\nlong avoided was at last to come.\r\n\r\n  [503] Leith Hay, ii. p. 46.\r\n\r\n  [504] Diary of Green of the 68th, p. 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA, JULY 22, 1812. THE EARLY STAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decisive moment of the campaign of 1812 had now been\r\nreached--though Marmont was wholly unaware of it, and was proposing\r\nmerely to continue his manœuvring of the last five days, and though\r\nWellington hardly expected that the 22nd of July would turn out\r\nmore eventful than the 21st. Both of them have left record of their\r\nintentions on the fateful morning. The Duke of Ragusa wrote to Berthier\r\nas follows: ‘My object was, in taking up this position, to prolong\r\nmy movement to the left, in order to dislodge the enemy from the\r\nneighbourhood of Salamanca, and to fight him at a greater advantage. I\r\ncalculated on taking up a good defensive position, against which the\r\nenemy could make no offensive move, and intended to press near enough\r\nto him to be able to profit from the first fault that he might make,\r\nand to attack him with vigour[505].’ He adds in another document, ‘I\r\nconsidered that our respective positions would bring on not a battle,\r\nbut an advantageous rearguard action, in which, using my full force\r\nlate in the day, with a part only of the British army left in front\r\nof me, I should probably score a point[506].’ It is clear that he\r\nreckoned that his adversary would continue his policy of the last five\r\ndays; Wellington, if his flank were once more turned, would move on as\r\nbefore--always parrying the thrusts made at him, but not taking the\r\noffensive himself.\r\n\r\n  [505] Marmont to Berthier, July 31, printed in _Mémoires_, iv. p.\r\n  443.\r\n\r\n  [506] Marmont, _Mémoires_, iv. p. 237.\r\n\r\nNor was he altogether wrong in his expectation. Writing to Lord\r\nBathurst on the evening of July 21st, the British Commander-in-Chief\r\nsummed up his intentions in these words. ‘I have determined to cross\r\nthe Tormes, if the enemy should: to cover Salamanca as long as I\r\ncan: and above all not to give up our communication with Ciudad\r\nRodrigo: and not to fight an action unless under very advantageous\r\ncircumstances, or if it should become absolutely necessary[507].’ This\r\ndetermination is re-stated in a dispatch which Wellington wrote three\r\ndays later, in a very different frame of mind. ‘I had determined that\r\nif circumstances should not permit me to attack him on the 22nd, I\r\nshould move toward Ciudad Rodrigo without further loss of time[508].’\r\nWellington was therefore, it is clear, intending simply to continue\r\nhis retreat without delivering battle, unless Marmont should give him\r\nan opportunity of striking a heavy blow, by putting himself in some\r\ndangerous posture. He desired to fight, but only if he could fight\r\nat advantage. Had Marmont continued to turn his flank by cautious\r\nmovements made at a discreet distance, and with an army always ready\r\nto form an orderly line of battle, Wellington would have sacrificed\r\nSalamanca, and moved back toward the Agueda. He was not prepared to\r\nwaste men in indecisive combats, which would not put the enemy out of\r\naction even if they went off well. ‘It is better that a battle should\r\nnot be fought, unless under such favourable circumstances that there\r\nwould be reason to hope that the allied army would be able to maintain\r\nthe field, while that of the enemy would not[509].’ For if the French\r\nwere only checked, and not completely knocked to pieces, Wellington\r\nknew that they would be reinforced within a few days by the 14,000 men\r\nwhom King Joseph (unknown to Marmont) was bringing up from Madrid.\r\nRetreat would then again become necessary, since the enemy would be\r\nsuperior in numbers to a hopeless extent. Wellington added that the\r\n22nd was his best day of advantage, since within thirty-six hours\r\nMarmont would have been reinforced by the cavalry brigade under General\r\nChauvel, which Caffarelli had at last sent forward from Burgos. It\r\nhad reached the Douro at Valladolid on the 20th, and would be up at\r\nthe front on the 23rd: this he well knew, and somewhat overrated its\r\nstrength[510].\r\n\r\n  [507] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 299, July 21st.\r\n\r\n  [508] Wellington to Bathurst, July 24. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 300.\r\n\r\n  [509] Again from dispatch to Bathurst, July 21st. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 296.\r\n\r\n  [510] Supposing it, apparently, to be over 1,000 strong, while it\r\n  was really not 800 sabres.\r\n\r\nBut though ready to take his advantage, if it were offered him,\r\nWellington evidently leaned to the idea that it would not be given.\r\nHe prepared for retreat, by sending off his whole baggage-train on\r\nthe Ciudad Rodrigo road at dawn, escorted by one of D’Urban’s three\r\nPortuguese cavalry regiments. This was a clear expression of his\r\nintention to move off. So is his letter of July 24 to Graham in which,\r\nwriting in confidence to a trusted subordinate, he remarks, ‘Marmont\r\nought to have given me a _pont d’or_, and then he would have made a\r\nhandsome operation of it.’ Instead of furnishing the proverbial bridge\r\nof gold to the yielding adversary, the Marshal pressed in upon him in\r\na threatening fashion, yet with his troops so scattered and strung\r\nout on a long front, that he was not ready for a decisive action when\r\nWellington at last saw his opportunity and dashed in upon him.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 22nd each party had to discover the exact position of\r\nhis adversary, for the country-side was both wooded and undulating.\r\nWellington’s army, on the line of heights reaching southward from Santa\r\nMarta, was almost entirely masked, partly by the woods in the centre of\r\nhis position, but still more by his having placed all the divisions far\r\nback from the sky-line on the reverse slope of the plateau. The front\r\nwas about three miles long, but little was visible upon it. Foy, whose\r\ndivision was ahead of the rest of the French army, describes what he\r\nsaw as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘The position of San Cristobal had been almost stripped of troops:\r\nwe could see one English division in a sparsely-planted wood within\r\ncannon-shot of Calvarisa de Ariba, on the Salamanca road: very far\r\nbehind a thin column was ascending the heights of Tejares: nothing more\r\ncould be made out of Wellington’s army: all the rest was hidden from\r\nus by the chain of heights which runs from north to south, and ends\r\nin the high and precipitous knolls of the Arapiles. Wellington was on\r\nthis chain, sufficiently near for us to recognize by means of the staff\r\nsurrounding him[511].’\r\n\r\n  [511] _Vie militaire_, edited by Girod de l’Ain, p. 173.\r\n\r\nAll, then, that Foy, and Marmont who was riding near him, actually\r\nsaw, was the 7th Division in the wood opposite Nuestra Señora de la\r\nPeña, and the distant baggage-column already filing off on the Ciudad\r\nRodrigo road, which ascends the heights beyond Aldea Tejada four miles\r\nto the rear.\r\n\r\nThe French army was a little more visible to Wellington, who could not\r\nonly make out Foy’s division behind Calvarisa de Ariba, but several\r\nother masses farther south and east, in front of the long belt of\r\nwoods which extends on each side of the village of Utrera for some\r\ntwo miles or more. It was impossible to see how far the French left\r\nreached among the dense trees: but the right was ‘refused:’ no troops\r\nwere opposite Wellington’s left or northern wing, and the villages of\r\nPelabravo and Calvarisa de Abaxo, far in advance of it, were still\r\nheld by British cavalry vedettes. In short, only the allied right and\r\ncentre had enemies in front of them. This indicated what Wellington\r\nhad expected--an attempt of Marmont to continue his old policy of\r\noutflanking his adversary’s extreme right: clearly the British left was\r\nnot in danger.\r\n\r\nMarmont, as his exculpatory dispatch to Berthier acknowledges, was\r\nconvinced that Wellington would retire once more the moment that his\r\nflank was threatened. ‘Everything led me to believe,’ he writes,\r\n‘that the enemy intended to occupy the position of Tejares [across\r\nthe Zurgain] which lay a league behind him, while at present he was a\r\nleague and a half in front of Salamanca[512].’ Foy’s diary completely\r\nbears out this view of Marmont’s conception of the situation. ‘The\r\nMarshal had no definite plan: he thought that the English army was\r\nalready gone off, or at least that it was going off, to take position\r\non the heights of Tejares on the left [or farther] bank of the river\r\nZurgain. He was tempted to make an attack on the one visible English\r\ndivision, with which a skirmishing fire had already begun. He was\r\nfearing that this division might get out of his reach! How little\r\ndid he foresee the hapless lot of his own army that day! The wily\r\nWellington was ready to give battle--the greater part of his host\r\nwas collected, but masked behind the line of heights: he was showing\r\nnothing on the crest, lest his intention should be divined: he was\r\nwaiting for our movement[513].’\r\n\r\n  [512] Correspondence in _Mémoires_, iv. p. 254.\r\n\r\n  [513] Foy, p. 174.\r\n\r\nThe skirmish to which Foy alludes was one begun by the _voltigeurs_\r\nof his own division, whom Marmont had ordered forward, to push back\r\nthe English pickets on the height of Nuestra Señora de la Peña. These\r\nbelonged to the 7th Division, which was occupying the wood behind. Not\r\nwishing his position to be too closely examined, Wellington sent out\r\ntwo whole battalions, the 68th and the 2nd Caçadores, who formed a\r\nvery powerful screen of light troops, and pushed back the French from\r\nthe hill and the ruined chapel on top of it. Marmont then strengthened\r\nhis firing line, and brought up a battery, which checked the further\r\nadvance of the allied skirmishers. The two screens continued to\r\nexchange shots for several hours, half a mile in front of Wellington’s\r\nposition. The _tiraillade_ had many episodes, in one of which General\r\nVictor Alten, leading a squadron of his hussars to protect the flank\r\nof the British skirmishers, received a ball in the knee, which put him\r\nout of action, and threw the command of his brigade into the hands of\r\nArentschildt, colonel of the 1st Hussars K.G.L. After much bickering,\r\nand when noon had long passed, the 68th and Caçadores were relieved\r\nby some companies of the 95th from the Light Division, as Wellington\r\nwished to employ the 7th Division elsewhere. He had at first thought\r\nit possible that Marmont was about to make a serious attack on this\r\npart of his front; but the notion died away when it was seen that\r\nthe Marshal did not send up any formed battalions to support his\r\n_voltigeurs_, and allowed the light troops of the allies to cling to\r\nthe western half of the slopes of Nuestra Señora de la Peña.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREATER OR FRENCH ARAPILE SEEN FROM THE FOOT OF THE\r\nLESSER ARAPILE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF THE BRITISH AND FRENCH POSITIONS, TAKEN\r\nFROM THE REAR OF THE FORMER, THE NEARER HILL WAS THE POSITION OF THE\r\n5TH DIVISION. THE VILLAGE OF ARAPILES TO THE LEFT. THE DISTANT RIDGE,\r\nALONG WHICH SMOKE IS ROLLING, IS THE FRENCH POSITION.\r\n\r\nFrom photographs by Mr. C. Armstrong.]\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that the French were--as so often before during the\r\nlast six days--about to extend their left wing. The right or southern\r\nflank of Wellington’s line rested on the rocky knoll, 400 feet high,\r\nwhich is known as the ‘Lesser Arapile.’ Six hundred yards from it,\r\nand outside the allied zone of occupation, lay the ‘Greater Arapile,’\r\nwhich is a few feet higher and much longer than its fellow. These two\r\ncurious hills, sometimes called the ‘Hermanitos’ or ‘little brothers,’\r\nare the most striking natural feature in the country-side. They rise\r\na hundred and fifty feet above the valley which lies between them,\r\nand a hundred feet above the heights on either side. Their general\r\nappearance somewhat recalls that of Dartmoor ‘Tors,’ rough rock\r\nbreaking out through the soil. But their shapes differ: the Greater\r\nArapile shows crags at each end, but has a comparatively smooth ascent\r\nto its centre on its northern front--so smooth that steep ploughed\r\nfields have been laid out upon it, and extend almost to the crest. The\r\nLesser Arapile is precipitous on its southern front, where it faces its\r\ntwin, but is joined at its back (or northern) side by a gentle slope\r\nto the main line of the heights where Wellington’s army lay. It is in\r\nshort an integral part of them, though it rises far above their level.\r\nThe Greater Arapile, on the other hand, is an isolated height, not\r\nbelonging to the system of much lower knolls which lies to its south.\r\nThese, three-quarters of a mile away, are covered with wood, and form\r\npart of the long forest which reaches as far as the neighbourhood of\r\nAlba de Tormes.\r\n\r\nWellington had left the Greater Arapile outside his position, partly\r\nbecause it was completely separated from the other heights that he\r\nheld, partly (it is said) because he had surveyed the ground in the\r\ndusk, and had judged the knoll farther from the Lesser Arapile than\r\nwas actually the case; they were within easy cannon-shot from each\r\nother[514]. At about eight o’clock, French skirmishers were observed\r\nbreaking out from the woods to the south of the Arapile and pushing\r\nrapidly toward it. They were followed by supporting columns in\r\nstrength--indeed Marmont had directed the whole of Bonnet’s division\r\nto move, under cover of the trees, to the point where the woods\r\napproach nearest to the hill, and from thence to carry it if possible.\r\nWellington, now judging that it was uncomfortably near to his right\r\nflank, ordered the 7th Caçadores--from the 4th Division, the unit that\r\nlay nearest--to race hard for the Greater Arapile and try to seize it\r\nbefore the French had arrived. They made good speed but failed: the\r\nenemy was on the crest first, and repulsed them with some loss. They\r\nhad to fall back to behind the Lesser Arapile, which was held by the\r\nfirst British brigade of their division (W. Anson’s).\r\n\r\n  [514] So says Vere, in his _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 31.\r\n\r\nMarmont had seized the Greater Arapile, as he tells us, to form\r\na strong advanced post, behind which he could move his main body\r\nwestward, in pursuance of his old design of turning Wellington’s right.\r\nIt was to be the ‘pivot on which the flanking movement should be made,’\r\nthe ‘_point d’appui_ of the right of his army’ when it should reach\r\nits new position[515]. Bonnet’s troops being firmly established on\r\nand behind it, he began to move his divisions to their left. On his\r\noriginal ground, the plateau of Calvarisa de Ariba, he left Foy’s\r\ndivision in front line--still bickering with the skirmishing line of\r\nthe allies--Ferey’s division in support, and Boyer’s dragoons to cover\r\nthe flank against any possible attack from the British cavalry, who\r\nwere in force on Wellington’s left, and still had detachments out on\r\nthe plateau by Pelabravo, beyond Foy’s extreme right. Having made this\r\nprovision against any possible attempt to attack him in the rear while\r\nhe was executing his great manœuvre, Marmont marched his five remaining\r\ndivisions[516], under cover of Bonnet’s advanced position, to the edge\r\nof the wooded hills in rear of the Great Arapile, where they remained\r\nfor some time in a threatening mass, without further movement.\r\n\r\n  [515] Marmont, _Mémoires_, iv. p. 255.\r\n\r\n  [516] Clausel, Brennier, Maucune, Thomières, and Sarrut also,\r\n  when the latter arrived late from Babila Fuente, and joined the\r\n  main body.\r\n\r\nWellington, clearly discerning from the summit of the Lesser Arapile\r\nthis general shift of the enemy to the left, now made great alterations\r\nin the arrangement of his troops, and adopted what may be called\r\nhis second battle-position. The 4th Division, about and around that\r\nheight, was placed so as to serve for the allied army the same purpose\r\nthat Bonnet was carrying out for the French on the other Hermanito.\r\nOf Cole’s three brigades, that of Anson occupied the Arapile--the\r\n3/27th on the summit, the 1/40th in support on the rear slope. Pack’s\r\nindependent Portuguese brigade was placed beside Anson. The Fusilier\r\nbrigade (under Ellis of the 1/23rd) and Stubbs’s Portuguese, the\r\nremaining units of the 4th Division, were formed up to the right of the\r\nhill, extending as far as the village which takes its name of Arapiles\r\nfrom the two strange knolls. Two guns of Cole’s divisional battery\r\n(that of Sympher[517]) were hoisted up with some difficulty to the\r\nlevel of the 3/27th. The other four were left with the Fusiliers near\r\nthe village[518]. Thus the little Arapile became the obtuse angle of a\r\nformation ‘en potence,’ with Pack and two brigades of the 4th Division\r\non its right, and the 7th Division (still engaged at a distance with\r\nFoy) and the 1st and Light Divisions on its left. At the same time\r\nWellington moved down the troops which had originally formed his\r\nleft wing (5th and 6th Divisions, España’s Spaniards, and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese) to a supporting position behind his centre, somewhere near\r\nthe village of Las Torres, where they could reinforce either his right\r\nor his left, as might prove necessary in the end. As a further general\r\nreserve G. Anson’s and Le Marchant’s cavalry brigades, and the greater\r\npart of Victor Alten’s, were brought away from the original left, and\r\nplaced in reserve near the 6th Division; but Bock and two of Victor\r\nAlten’s squadrons[519] remained on the left, opposite Boyer’s dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [517] A K.G.L. unit--the only German artillery present at\r\n  Salamanca.\r\n\r\n  [518] All this from Vere’s _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n  [519] From the 14th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this same general move, Wellington sent a most\r\nimportant order to the troops which he had left till this moment on\r\nthe north bank of the Tormes, covering Salamanca, in the position by\r\nCabrerizos. These consisted of the 3rd Division--which was under the\r\ntemporary command of Edward Pakenham (Wellington’s brother-in-law)\r\nduring Picton’s sickness--and the 500 sabres that remained of\r\nD’Urban’s Portuguese horse, after one regiment had been sent off on\r\nescort-duty with the baggage-train. These corps were directed to march\r\nover the town-bridge of Salamanca, and take up a position between\r\nAldea Tejada and La Penilla, to the east of the high-road to Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. There placed, they were available either as a reserve to the\r\nnewly-formed right wing, or as a supporting échelon, if the whole\r\narmy should ultimately fall back for a retreat along the high-road,\r\nor as a detached force placed so far to the right that it could\r\noutflank or throw itself in front of any French troops which might\r\ncontinue Marmont’s advance from the Arapiles westward. It is probable\r\nthat Wellington, at the moment when he gave the orders, would have\r\nbeen quite unable to say which of these three duties would fall to\r\nPakenham’s share. The 3rd Division marched from Cabrerizos at noon,\r\npassing through the city, which was at this moment full of alarms and\r\nexcursions. For the sight of Marmont close at hand, and of the British\r\nbaggage-train moving off hastily toward Rodrigo, had filled the\r\ninhabitants with dismay. Some were hiding their more valuable property,\r\nothers (who had compromised themselves by their friendly reception of\r\nthe allied army) were preparing for hasty flight. Some used bitter\r\nlanguage of complaint--the English were retreating without a battle\r\nafter betraying their friends.\r\n\r\nPakenham and D’Urban reached their appointed station by two\r\no’clock,[520] and halted in a dip in the ground, well screened by\r\ntrees, between La Penilla and Aldea Tejada, where they could barely\r\nbe seen from the highest slopes of Wellington’s position, and not at\r\nall from any other point. For some time they were left undisturbed,\r\nlistening to a growing noise of artillery fire to their left front,\r\nwhere matters were evidently coming to a head.\r\n\r\n  [520] The hours are taken from D’Urban’s diary.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o’clock Marmont had climbed to the summit of the French\r\nArapile, from whence he obtained for the first time a partial view into\r\nthe British position; for looking up the dip in the ground between the\r\nLesser Arapile and the heights occupied by the Fusilier brigade of the\r\n4th Division, he could catch a glimpse of some of the movements that\r\nwere going on at the back of Wellington’s first line. Apparently he saw\r\nthe 1st and Light Divisions behind the crest of their destined fighting\r\nposition, and the 5th and 6th and Bradford’s Portuguese taking ground\r\nto their right. Pack’s Portuguese on the flank and rear of the British\r\nArapile must also have been visible at least in part. The conclusion to\r\nwhich he came was that his adversary was accumulating forces behind the\r\nLesser Arapile with the object of sallying out against Bonnet, whose\r\npost was very far advanced in front of the rest of the French army, and\r\nagainst Foy and Ferey, who were left in a somewhat isolated position on\r\nthe plateau by Calvarisa, when the main body of the army had moved so\r\nfar to the west.\r\n\r\nSome such intention seems for a moment to have been in Wellington’s\r\nmind, though he says nothing of it in his dispatch. ‘About twelve\r\no’clock,’ writes one of the most trustworthy British diarists, ‘the\r\ntroops were ordered to attack, and the 1st Division moved forward\r\nto gain the other Arapile, which the French had taken.... There was\r\nsomething singular, I think, in Lord Wellington’s ordering the 1st and\r\nLight Divisions to attack early in the day, and then counter-ordering\r\nthem after they had begun to move. Marshal Beresford, no doubt, was the\r\ncause of the alteration, by what he urged. Yet at the same time Lord\r\nW. is so little influenced (or indeed allows any person to say a word)\r\nthat his attending to the Marshal was considered singular. From all I\r\ncould collect and observe “the Peer” was a little nervous: it was the\r\nfirst time he had ever attacked. When he _did_ finally determine on the\r\nattack it was well done, in the most decided manner. There was possibly\r\nsome little trouble in arriving at that decision[521].’ Oddly enough\r\nthis contemporary note is exactly borne out by Marmont’s statement in\r\nhis _Mémoires_, that meeting Wellington years after, he inquired about\r\nthe point, and was frankly told that an attack had been projected\r\nat this moment, but that it had been put off in consequence of the\r\nrepresentation of Beresford, who had counselled delay[522]. There was\r\na heavy mass of troops available behind the Lesser Arapile and to both\r\nsides of it--the 4th Division, Pack’s Portuguese, and the 1st, 7th, and\r\nLight Divisions, with the 5th and 6th and Bradford and the cavalry in\r\nreserve. The blow might have succeeded--but undoubtedly that delivered\r\nfour hours later was much more effective.\r\n\r\n  [521] Tomkinson’s _Diary_, pp. 187-9.\r\n\r\n  [522] Marmont, _Mémoires_, iv. p. 256.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an attack at noon having been finally rejected Wellington\r\nturned his mind to another possibility. If Marmont should commit no\r\nblunders, and should continue his turning movement at a safe distance,\r\nand with his whole army well concentrated, it was quite possible that\r\na retreat might become necessary. The Commander-in-Chief called up\r\nColonel Delancey, then acting as Adjutant-General[523], and directed\r\nhim to draft a comprehensive scheme for the order in which the troops\r\nshould be withdrawn, and the route which each division would take in\r\nthe event of an evacuation of the position. The next stand was to be\r\nmade, as Marmont had supposed, on the heights above Aldea Tejada,\r\nbehind the river Zurgain[524]. Such a move would have involved the\r\nabandonment of the city of Salamanca to the French. The news spread\r\nfrom the staff round the commanding officers of divisions, and so\r\ndownwards to the ranks, where it caused immense discontent. Every one\r\nwas ‘spoiling for a fight,’ and the cautious tactics of the last six\r\ndays had been causing murmurs, which were only kept from becoming acute\r\nby the long-tried confidence that the army felt in its chief.\r\n\r\n  [523] Charles Stewart (Lord Londonderry), who had held the post\r\n  for the last three years had just gone home, and his successor\r\n  had not yet come out to Spain.\r\n\r\n  [524] The note concerning Delancey is from Vere’s _Marches of the\r\n  4th Division_, p. 31.\r\n\r\nAt this very moment Marmont began to act in the fashion that Wellington\r\nmost desired, by making an altogether dangerous extension of his left\r\nwing, and at the same time pressing in so close to his adversary\r\nthat he could not avoid a battle if it were thrust upon him. His own\r\nexplanation is that he took the putting off of Wellington’s tentative\r\nmovement against Bonnet as a sign that the allied army was actually\r\ncommencing its retreat. ‘Wellington renounced his intention of\r\nfighting, and from that moment he had to prepare to draw away, for if\r\nhe had remained in his present position I should from the next day\r\nhave threatened his communications, by marching on to my left. His\r\nwithdrawal commenced at midday.... He had to retreat by his right, and\r\nconsequently he had to begin by strengthening his right. He therefore\r\nweakened his left, and accumulated troops on his right. Then his more\r\ndistant units and his reserves commenced to move, and in succession\r\ndrew off towards Tejares [Aldea Tejada]. His intention was easy to\r\ndiscern.... The enemy having carried off the bulk of his force to\r\nhis right, I had to reinforce my left, so as to be able to act with\r\npromptness and vigour, without having to make new arrangements, when\r\nthe moment should arrive for falling upon the English rearguard[525].’\r\n\r\n  [525] _Mémoires_, iv. p. 257.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Duke of Ragusa had drawn his conclusion that\r\nWellington was about to retreat at once, and had argued, from\r\npartly-seen motions in his adversary’s rear, that the whole allied\r\narmy was moving off. But this was not yet the case: Wellington was\r\ntaking precautions, but he was still not without hope that the French\r\nwould commit themselves to some unwise and premature movement. He had\r\nstill every man in hand, and the supposed general retreat on Aldea\r\nTejada, which the Marshal thought that he saw, was in reality only the\r\nshifting of reserves more to the right.\r\n\r\nUnwitting of this, Marmont, a little before two o’clock, began his\r\nextension to the left. To the westward of the woods on whose edge the\r\nfive divisions composing his main body were massed, is a long plateau\r\nfacing the village of Arapiles and the heights behind it. It is about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile broad and three miles long, gently undulating\r\nand well suited for marching: in 1812 it seems to have been open\r\nwaste: to-day it is mainly under the plough. Its front or northern\r\nside slopes gently down, toward the bottom in which lies the village\r\nof Arapiles: at its back, which is steeper, are woods, outlying parts\r\nof the great forest which extends to Alba de Tormes. It ends suddenly\r\nin a knoll with an outcrop of rock, called the Pico de Miranda, above\r\nthe hamlet of Miranda de Azan, from which it draws its name. Along\r\nthis plateau was the obvious and easy route for a force marching to\r\nturn Wellington’s right. It was a very tempting piece of ground, with\r\na glacis-like slope towards the English heights, which made it very\r\ndefensible--a better artillery position against a force advancing\r\nfrom the village of Arapiles and the ridges behind it could not be\r\nconceived. The only danger connected with it seemed to be that it was\r\nover-long--it had more than two miles of front, and a very large force\r\nwould be required to hold it securely from end to end. From the Pico\r\nde Miranda, if the French should extend so far, to Foy’s right wing by\r\nCalvarisa de Ariba was a distance of six miles in all--far too much for\r\nan army of 48,000 men in the battle-array of the Napoleonic period.\r\n\r\nMarmont says that his first intention was only to occupy the nearer end\r\nof the plateau, that part of it which faces the village of Arapiles.\r\nIn his apologetic dispatch to Berthier, he declares that he wished to\r\nget a lodgement upon it, lest Wellington might seize it before him,\r\nand so block his way westward. ‘It was indispensable to occupy it,\r\nseeing that the enemy had just strengthened his centre, from whence he\r\ncould push out _en masse_ on to this plateau, and commence an attack\r\nby taking possession of this important ground. Accordingly I ordered\r\nthe 5th Division (Maucune) to move out and form up on the right end of\r\nthe plateau, where his fire would link on perfectly with that from\r\nthe [Great] Arapile: the 7th Division [Thomières] was to place itself\r\nin second line as a support, the 2nd Division (Clausel) to act as a\r\nreserve to the 7th. The 6th Division (Brennier) was to occupy the high\r\nground in front of the wood, where a large number of my guns were still\r\nstationed. I ordered General Bonnet at the same time to occupy with the\r\n122nd regiment a knoll intermediate between the plateau and the hill\r\nof the [Great] Arapile, which blocks the exit from the village of the\r\nsame name. Finally, I directed General Boyer to leave only one regiment\r\nof his dragoons to watch Foy’s right, and to come round with the other\r\nthree to the front of the wood, beside the 2nd Division. The object of\r\nthis was that, supposing the enemy should attack the plateau, Boyer\r\ncould charge in on their right flank, while my light cavalry could\r\ncharge in on their left flank[526].’\r\n\r\n  [526] Dispatch to Berthier, _Mémoires_, iv. pp. 445-6.\r\n\r\nAll this reads very plausibly and ingeniously, but unfortunately\r\nit squares in neither with the psychology of the moment, nor with\r\nthe manœuvres which Maucune, Thomières, and Clausel executed, under\r\nthe Marshal’s eye and without his interference. He had forgotten\r\nwhen he dictated this paragraph--and not unnaturally, for he wrote\r\nsorely wounded, on his sick-bed, in pain, and with his head not too\r\nclear--that he had just before stated that Wellington was obviously\r\nretreating, and had begun to withdraw towards Aldea Tejada. If this\r\nwas so, how could he possibly have conceived at the moment that his\r\nadversary, far from retreating, was preparing an offensive movement\r\n_en masse_ against the left flank of the French position? The two\r\nconceptions cannot be reconciled. The fact was, undoubtedly, that he\r\nthought that Wellington was moving off, and pushed forward Maucune,\r\nThomières, and Clausel, with the object of molesting and detaining what\r\nhe supposed to be the rearguard of his adversary. The real idea of the\r\nmoment was the one which appears in the paragraph of his _Mémoires_,\r\nalready quoted on an earlier page: ‘I hoped that our respective\r\npositions would bring on not a battle but an advantageous rearguard\r\naction, in which, using my full force late in the day, with a part\r\nonly of the British army left in front of me, I should probably score\r\na point.’ Jourdan, a severe critic of his colleague, puts the matter\r\nwith perfect frankness in his _Guerre d’Espagne_. After quoting\r\nMarmont’s insincere dispatch at length, he adds, ‘it is evident that\r\nthe Marshal, in order to menace the point of retreat of the allies,\r\nextended his left much too far[527].’ Napoleon, after reading Marmont’s\r\ndispatch in a Russian bivouac[528], pronounced that all his reasons and\r\nexplanations for the position into which he got himself had ‘as much\r\ncomplicated stuffing as the inside of a clock, and not a word of truth\r\nas to the real state of things.’\r\n\r\n  [527] Jourdan’s _Mémoire sur la Guerre d’Espagne_, p. 418.\r\n\r\n  [528] ‘Il y a plus de fatras et de rouages que dans une horloge,\r\n  et pas un mot qui fasse connaître l’état réel des choses.’ For\r\n  more hard words see Napoleon to Clarke, Ghiatz, September 2.\r\n\r\nWhat happened under the eyes of Marmont, as he took a long-delayed\r\nlunch on the top of the Greater Arapile[529], was as follows. Maucune,\r\nwith his strong division of nine battalions or 5,200 men, after\r\nbreaking out from the position in front of the woods where the French\r\nmain body was massed, marched across the open ground for about a mile\r\nor more, till he had got well on to the central part of the plateau\r\nwhich he was directed to occupy. He then drew up opposite the village\r\nof Arapiles, and sent out his voltigeur companies to work down the\r\nslope toward that place, which lay well in front of the British line.\r\nThe position which he took up was on that part of the plateau which\r\nsweeps forward nearest to the opposite heights, and is little more\r\nthan half a mile from them. A fierce artillery engagement then set in:\r\nMaucune’s divisional battery began to shell the village of Arapiles.\r\nSympher’s battery, belonging to the 4th Division, replied from the\r\nslope behind the village and from two guns on the Lesser Arapile. The\r\nFrench pieces which had been dragged up on to the Greater Arapile then\r\nstarted shelling the Lesser, and silenced the two guns there, which\r\nwere drawn off, and sent to rejoin the rest of the battery, on a less\r\nexposed position. The 3/27th on the hilltop had to take cover behind\r\nrocks as best it could. Soon after at least two more French batteries,\r\nfrom the artillery reserve, took ground to the right of Maucune, and\r\njoined in the shelling of the village of Arapiles. Wellington presently\r\nsupported Sympher’s battery with that of Lawson, belonging to the\r\n5th Division, which turned on to shell Maucune’s supporting columns\r\nfrom ground on the lower slopes, not far to the right of Sympher’s\r\nposition. The effect was good, and the columns shifted sideways to get\r\nout of range. But one [or perhaps two] of the French batteries then\r\nshifted their position, and began to play upon Lawson diagonally from\r\nthe left, so enfilading him that he was ordered to limber up and move\r\nhigher on the hill behind the village, from whence he resumed his fire.\r\nWellington also, a little later, brought up the horse-artillery troop\r\nbelonging to the 7th Division [’E’, Macdonald’s troop] and placed it on\r\nthe Lesser Arapile--two guns on the summit, four on the lower slopes\r\nnear the 1/40th of W. Anson’s brigade. The British fire all along the\r\nheights was effective and accurate, but quite unable to cope with that\r\nof the French, who had apparently six batteries in action against\r\nthree. Marmont, indeed, had all along his line an immense superiority\r\nof guns, having 78 pieces with him against Wellington’s 54. His\r\nartillery-reserve consisted of four batteries--that of his adversary of\r\none only--Arriaga’s Portuguese 24-pounder howitzers[530].\r\n\r\n  [529] See Memoirs of Parquin, who commanded his escort, p. 299.\r\n  But he states the hour as 11 o’clock, much too early.\r\n\r\n  [530] For this artillery business see especially the six\r\n  narratives of artillery officers printed by Major Leslie in his\r\n  _Dickson Papers_, ii. pp. 685-97. Also for doings of the 5th\r\n  Division battery (Lawson’s), Leith Hay, ii. pp. 47-8, and of the\r\n  4th Division battery (Sympher’s), Vere’s _Marches of the 4th\r\n  Division_, pp. 33-4.\r\n\r\nWhile Maucune and the French artillery were making a very noisy\r\ndemonstration against the British line between the Lesser Arapile and\r\nthe village of the same name, which looked like the preliminaries of\r\na serious attack, more troops emerged from the woods of Marmont’s\r\ncentre, and began to file along the plateau, under cover of Maucune’s\r\ndeployed line. These were Thomières’s division, succeeded after a long\r\ninterval by that of Clausel. ‘During the cannonade column followed\r\ncolumn in quick and continued succession along the heights occupied\r\nby the enemy: Marmont was moving his army in battle-order along his\r\nposition, and gaining ground rapidly to his left[531].’ According\r\nto the Marshal’s own account of his intentions, he had proposed to\r\nplace Maucune on the (French) right end of the plateau, Thomières and\r\nClausel in support of him. What happened, however, was that Maucune\r\nwent well forward on to the right-centre of the plateau, and that\r\nThomières marched along past Maucune’s rear, and continued moving in a\r\nwesterly direction along the summit of the plateau, though Clausel soon\r\nhalted: before Thomières stopped he had gone nearly three miles. It is\r\nclear that if Marmont had chosen, he could have checked the manœuvres\r\nof his subordinates, the moment that they passed the limit which he\r\nalleges that he had set them. An aide-de-camp sent down from the back\r\nof the Greater Arapile could have told Maucune not to press forward\r\ntoward the English position, or Thomières to stop his march, within a\r\nmatter of twenty minutes or half an hour. No such counterorders were\r\nsent--and the reason clearly was that Marmont was satisfied with the\r\nmovements that he saw proceeding before him, until the moment when he\r\nsuddenly realized with dismay that Wellington was about to deliver a\r\ncounter-stroke in full force.\r\n\r\n  [531] Vere’s _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 33.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the movements of the allied army. The instant that\r\nMaucune deployed on the plateau in front of the village of Arapiles,\r\nand that the cannonade began, Wellington judged that he was about to\r\nbe attacked--the thing that he most desired. A very few orders put his\r\narmy in a defensive battle-position. The 5th Division was sent from\r\nthe rear side of the heights to occupy the crest, continuing the line\r\nof the 4th Division. The 6th Division was brought up from the rear\r\nto a position behind the 4th. The 7th Division, abandoning the long\r\nbickering with Foy in which its light troops had been engaged, was\r\ndrawn back from the left wing, and took post in second line parallel to\r\nthe 6th and in rear of the 5th Division. The place of its skirmishers\r\non the slopes in front of Nuestra Señora de la Peña was taken by some\r\ncompanies of the 95th, sent out from the Light Division. That unit and\r\nthe 1st Division now formed the total of the allied left wing, with\r\nBock’s heavy dragoons covering their flank. They were ‘containing’ an\r\nequivalent French force--Foy’s and Ferey’s infantry divisions, and the\r\nsingle regiment of Boyer’s dragoons which Marmont had left in this\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThere still remained in reserve, near the village of Las Torres,\r\nBradford’s Portuguese and España’s Spanish battalions, with the bulk\r\nof the allied cavalry--all Anson’s and Le Marchant’s and the greater\r\npart of Arentschildt’s squadrons, and in addition Pakenham and D’Urban\r\nwere available a little farther to the right, near Aldea Tejada. If the\r\nFrench were going to attack the heights on each side of the village of\r\nArapiles, as seemed probable at the moment, all these remoter reserves\r\ncould be used as should seem most profitable.\r\n\r\nBut the battle did not go exactly as Wellington expected. The cannonade\r\ncontinued, and Maucune’s skirmishing line pushed very boldly forward,\r\nand actually attacked the village of Arapiles, which was defended by\r\nthe light companies of the Guards’ brigade of the 1st Division and of\r\nthe Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division. The _voltigeurs_ twice seized\r\nthe southern outlying houses of the straggling village, and were twice\r\ndriven out. But the battalions in support of them did not come forward,\r\nnor did Bonnet attack on the right of them, nor Thomières on the left.\r\nThe former remained stationary, on and about the Great Arapile: the\r\nlatter continued to march westward along the plateau: a perceptible gap\r\nbegan to appear between him and Maucune.\r\n\r\nWellington at this moment was toward the right rear of his own\r\nline--occupied according to some authorities in snatching a late\r\nand hasty lunch[532] while matters were developing, but not yet\r\ndeveloped--according to others in giving orders concerning the cavalry\r\nto Stapleton Cotton, near Las Torres--when he received an urgent\r\nmessage from Leith. It said that Maucune had ceased to advance, but\r\nthat the French extreme left was still in march westward. ‘On being\r\nmade acquainted with the posture of affairs,’ writes the officer who\r\nbore Leith’s report[533], ‘Lord Wellington declared his intention of\r\nriding to the spot and directed me to accompany him. When he arrived at\r\nthe ground of the 5th Division--now under arms and perfectly prepared\r\nto receive the attack, his Lordship found the enemy still in the same\r\nformation, but not displaying any intention of trying his fortune, by\r\ncrossing the valley at that point. He soon became satisfied that no\r\noperation of consequence was intended against this part of the line. He\r\nagain galloped off toward the right, which at this time became the most\r\ninteresting and important scene of action.’\r\n\r\n  [532] The traditional story may be found in Greville’s _Memoirs_,\r\n  ii. p. 39. Wellington is said to have been in the courtyard of a\r\n  farmhouse, where some food had been laid out for him, ‘stumping\r\n  about and munching,’ and taking occasional peeps through his\r\n  telescope. Presently came the aide-de-camp with Leith’s message.\r\n  Wellington took another long look through his glass, and cried,\r\n  ‘By God! that will do!’ his mouth still full. He then sprang on\r\n  his horse and rode off, the staff following. Another version may\r\n  be found in Grattan, pp. 239-40: ‘Lord W. had given his glass to\r\n  an aide-de-camp, while he himself sat down to eat a few mouthfuls\r\n  of cold beef. Presently the officer reported that the enemy were\r\n  still extending to their left. “The devil they are! give me\r\n  the glass quickly,” said his lordship--and then, after a long\r\n  inspection, “This will do at last, I think--ride off.”’\r\n\r\n  [533] His nephew, Leith Hay, whose memoir I have so often had to\r\n  quote, here ii. p. 49.\r\n\r\nThe critical moment of the day was the short space of time when\r\nWellington was surveying the French army, from the height where\r\nLeith’s men were lying prostrate behind the crest, above the village\r\nof Arapiles, under a distant but not very effective artillery fire.\r\nThe whole plateau opposite was very visible: Maucune could be seen\r\nhalted and in line, with much artillery on his flank, but no infantry\r\nforce near--there was half a mile between him and Bonnet. Thomières\r\nwas still pushing away to his left, already separated by some distance\r\nfrom Maucune. Clausel had apparently halted after the end of his march\r\nout of the woods. Foy and Ferey were at least two miles off to the\r\nFrench right. The enemy, in short, were in no solid battle order,\r\nand were scattered on an immense arc, which enveloped on both sides\r\nthe obtuse angle _en potence_ formed by the main body of the allied\r\narmy. From Foy’s right to Thomières’s left there was length but no\r\ndepth. The only reserves were the troops imperfectly visible in the\r\nwoods behind the Great Arapile--where lay Brennier in first line, and\r\nSarrut who was now nearing Marmont’s artillery-park and baggage. Their\r\nstrength might be guessed from the fact that Marmont was known to have\r\neight infantry divisions, and that six were clearly visible elsewhere.\r\nWellington’s determination was suddenly taken, to turn what had been\r\nintended for a defensive into an offensive battle. Seeing the enemy so\r\nscattered, and so entirely out of regular formation, he would attack\r\nhim with the whole force that he had in position west of the little\r\nArapile, before Marmont could get into order. Leith, Cole, and Pack in\r\nfront line, supported by the 6th and 7th Divisions in second line,\r\nand with Bradford, España, and Stapleton Cotton’s cavalry covering\r\ntheir right flank in a protective échelon, should cross the valley and\r\nfall upon Bonnet, Maucune, Clausel, and Thomières. Meanwhile Pakenham\r\nand D’Urban, being in a hidden position from which they could easily\r\noutflank Thomières, should ascend the western end of the plateau, get\r\nacross the head of his marching column, and drive it in upon Maucune,\r\nwhom Leith would be assailing at the same moment. Pakenham’s turning\r\nmovement was the most delicate part of the plan; wherefore Wellington\r\nresolved to start it himself. He rode like the wind across the ground\r\nbehind the heights, past Las Torres and Penilla, and appeared all\r\nalone before D’Urban’s Portuguese squadrons. It was only some time\r\nlater that first Colonel Delancey and then others of his staff, quite\r\noutdistanced, came dropping in with blown horses. The orders to D’Urban\r\nwere short and clear: Pakenham was about to attack the western end of\r\nthe plateau where Thomières was moving--near the Pico de Miranda. It\r\nwould be D’Urban’s duty to cover his right flank[534]. A minute later\r\nWellington was before the 3rd Division, which had just received orders\r\nto stand to its arms.\r\n\r\n  [534] D’Urban’s unpublished diary gives the fact that he got his\r\n  order from Wellington personally before Pakenham was reached.\r\n\r\n‘The officers had not taken their places in the column, but were in a\r\ngroup together, in front of it. As Lord Wellington rode up to Pakenham\r\nevery eye was turned towards him. He looked paler than usual; but,\r\nnotwithstanding the sudden change he had just made in the disposition\r\nof his army, he was quite unruffled in his manner, as if the battle\r\nto be fought was nothing but a field-day. His words were few and his\r\norders brief. Tapping Pakenham on the shoulder, he said, “Edward, move\r\non with the 3rd Division, take those heights in your front--and drive\r\neverything before you.” “I will, my lord,” was the laconic reply of the\r\ngallant Sir Edward. A moment after, Lord Wellington was galloping on to\r\nthe next division, to give (I suppose) orders to the same effect, and\r\nin less than half an hour the battle had commenced[535].’ The time was\r\nabout a quarter to four in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n  [535] Grattan’s _With the Connaught Rangers_, pp. 241-2.\r\n\r\nHaving set Pakenham and D’Urban in motion, Wellington rode back to the\r\nground of the 5th Division, sending on his way orders for Arentschildt\r\nto leave the cavalry reserve, and join D’Urban with the five squadrons\r\nthat remained of Victor Alten’s brigade[536]. Bradford, España, and\r\nCotton at the same time were directed to come forward to Leith’s right\r\nflank. On reaching the hilltop behind the village of Arapiles, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief gave his orders to Leith: the 5th Division was to\r\nadvance downhill and attack Maucune across the valley, as soon as\r\nBradford’s Portuguese should be close up to support his right, and as\r\nPakenham’s distant movement should become visible. Wellington then rode\r\non to give the corresponding orders to Cole, more to the left[537].\r\n\r\n  [536] Two of 14th Light Dragoons, three of 1st Hussars K.G.L.\r\n\r\n  [537] All this from Leith Hay, ii. pp. 51-2.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Division thereupon sent out its light companies in skirmishing\r\nline, and came up to the crest: the two neighbouring brigades of the\r\n4th Division followed suit, and then Pack’s Portuguese, opposite the\r\nGreater Arapile. Considerable loss was suffered in all these corps\r\nfrom the French artillery fire, when the battalions rose from their\r\nlying posture behind the crest and became visible. Some thirty or forty\r\nminutes elapsed between Wellington’s arrival on the scene and the\r\ncommencement of the advance: the delay was caused by the necessity for\r\nwaiting for Bradford, who was coming up as fast as possible from Las\r\nTorres. The attack did not begin till about 4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Leith and Cole came into action the French army had\r\nbeen deprived of its chief. Somewhere between three and four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon[538], and certainly nearer the latter than the former\r\nhour, Marmont had been severely wounded. According to his own narrative\r\nhe had begun to be troubled by seeing Maucune pressing in too close to\r\nthe village of Arapiles, and Thomières passing on too far to the left,\r\nand had been roused to considerable vexation by getting a message\r\nfrom the former that he observed that the troops in front of him were\r\nretiring, and therefore would ask leave to support his _voltigeurs_\r\nand attack the British position with his whole division. Marmont\r\nsays that it was his wish to stop Maucune from closing that induced\r\nhim to prepare to depart from his eyrie on the Great Arapile, and to\r\ndescend to take charge of his left wing. Be this as it may, there is\r\nno doubt that he was starting to climb down and mount his horse, when\r\na shell from one of Dyneley’s two guns on the British Arapile burst\r\nnear him, and flung him to the ground with a lacerated right arm, and\r\na wound in his side which broke two ribs[539]. He himself says that\r\nthere was nothing irremediable in the state of his army at the moment\r\nthat he was disabled. His critic, Foy, held otherwise. ‘The Duke of\r\nRagusa,’ he wrote, ‘insinuated that the battle of the 22nd was lost\r\nbecause, after his own wounding, there was a gap in the command,\r\nanarchy, and disorder. But it was the Duke who forced on the battle,\r\nand that contrary to the advice of General Clausel. His left was\r\nalready beaten when he was disabled: already it was impossible either\r\nto refuse a battle or to give it a good turn. It was only possible to\r\nattenuate the disaster--and that was what Clausel did[540].’ Foy also\r\ninsinuates that Maucune’s advance, at least in its early stages, was\r\nconsonant with Marmont’s intentions. ‘He had made his arrangements for\r\na decisive blow: when the English were seen to take up their position,\r\nthe heads of the columns were turned to the left, so as to occupy the\r\nelevations which dominate the plain, and swell up one after another.\r\nThe occupation of one led to the temptation to seize the next, and so\r\nby advance after advance the village of Arapiles was at last reached.\r\nMaucune’s division actually held it for some minutes. Nevertheless we\r\nhad not yet made up our minds to deliver battle, and the necessary\r\ndispositions for one had not been made. My division was still occupying\r\nthe plateau of Calvarisa, with the 3rd and 4th Divisions (Ferey and\r\nSarrut) and the dragoons supporting me in the rear. Here, then, was\r\na whole section of the army quite out of the fight: and the other\r\ndivisions were not well linked together, and could be beaten one after\r\nthe other.’\r\n\r\n  [538] Marmont says that it was ‘environ trois heures du soir.’\r\n  But I think that about 3.45 should be given as the hour, since\r\n  Maucune only left the woods at 2 o’clock, and had to march\r\n  on to the plateau, to take up his position, to send out his\r\n  _voltigeurs_, and to get them close in to Arapiles before he\r\n  would have sent such a message to his chief. Foy says ‘between 3\r\n  and 4 p.m.’\r\n\r\n  [539] Many years after, when Marmont, now a subject of Louis\r\n  XVIII, was inspecting some British artillery, an officer had the\r\n  maladroit idea of introducing to him the sergeant who had pointed\r\n  the gun--the effect of the shot in the middle of the French staff\r\n  had been noticed on the British Arapile.\r\n\r\n  [540] _Vie militaire de Foy_, p. 177.\r\n\r\nFoy is certainly correct in asserting that, at the moment of the\r\nMarshal’s wound, he himself and Ferey were too far off to be brought\r\nup in time to save Maucune, and that Bonnet, Maucune, Clausel, and\r\nThomières were in no solid connexion with each other. This indeed\r\nwas what made Wellington deliver his attack. It is probable that the\r\nMarshal’s wound occurred just about the moment (3.45) when Pakenham\r\nand D’Urban were being directed by Wellington to advance. Even if it\r\nfell a trifle earlier, the French left wing was already too dislocated\r\nto have time to get into a good position before it was attacked.\r\nMarmont, it must be confessed, rather gave away his case when, in his\r\nreply to Napoleon’s angry query why he had fought a battle on the\r\n22nd, he answered that he had not intended to deliver a general action\r\nat all--it had been forced on him by Wellington[541]. If so, he was\r\nresponsible for being caught by his adversary with his army strung out\r\nin such a fashion that it had a very poor chance of avoiding disaster.\r\nIf it be granted that the unlucky shell had never struck him, it would\r\nnot have been in ‘a quarter of an hour[542]’ (as he himself pretends),\r\nnor even in a whole hour, that he could have rearranged a line six\r\nmiles long[543], though he might have stopped Maucune’s attack and\r\nThomières’s flank march in a much shorter time.\r\n\r\n  [541] Marmont to Berthier, _Mémoires_, iv. p. 468.\r\n\r\n  [542] Ibid., ‘la gauche eut été formée en moins d’un quart\r\n  d’heure’!\r\n\r\n  [543] The exact moment of Marmont’s wound is very difficult to\r\n  fix, as also that of Wellington’s attack. The Marshal himself\r\n  (as mentioned above, p.438) says that he was hit ‘environ les\r\n  trois heures,’ and that Leith and Cole advanced ‘peu après, sur\r\n  les quatre heures.’ Foy places the wound merely ‘between 3 and\r\n  4 p.m.’ Parquin, who commanded Marmont’s escort of _chasseurs_,\r\n  says that the Marshal had been carried back to Alba de Tormes\r\n  by 4 o’clock--impossibly early. On the other hand Napier gives\r\n  too late an hour, when saying that Marmont was wounded only at\r\n  the moment when Leith and Cole advanced, 4.45 or so, and was\r\n  running down from the Arapile because of their movement. This\r\n  is, I imagine, much too late. But it is supported by _Victoires\r\n  et Conquêtes_, sometimes a well-documented work but often\r\n  inaccurate, which places the unlucky shot at 4.30. Grattan places\r\n  the order to the British infantry (Leith and Cole) to prepare to\r\n  attack at 4.20--Leith Hay at ‘at least an hour after 3 o’clock.’\r\n  Gomm, on the other hand, makes Wellington move ‘at 3 o’clock\r\n  in the afternoon.’ Tomkinson (usually very accurate) places\r\n  Pakenham’s and Leith’s success at ‘about 5 p.m.’ D’Urban thinks\r\n  that he met Lord Wellington and received his orders _after_ 4\r\n  p.m.--probably he is half an hour too late in his estimate.\r\n\r\nOn Marmont’s fall, the command of the army of Portugal fell to Bonnet,\r\nthe senior general of division. He was within a few yards of his\r\nwounded chief, since his division was holding the Great Arapile, and\r\ntook up the charge at once. But it was an extraordinary piece of\r\nill-luck for the French that Bonnet also was wounded within an hour, so\r\nthat the command passed to Clausel before six o’clock. As Foy remarks,\r\nhowever, no one could have saved the compromised left wing--Marmont had\r\nlet it get into a thoroughly vicious position before he was disabled.\r\n\r\nSince the main clash of the battle of Salamanca started at the western\r\nend of the field, it will be best to begin the narrative of the British\r\nadvance with the doings of Pakenham and D’Urban. These two officers\r\nhad some two miles of rough ground to cover between the point where\r\nWellington had parted from them, and the point which had now been\r\nreached by the head of the French advance. They were ordered to move\r\nin four ‘columns of lines,’ with D’Urban’s cavalry forming the two\r\nouter or right-hand columns, the third composed of Wallace’s brigade\r\n(1/45th, 1/88th, 74th) and of Power’s Portuguese (9th and 21st Line\r\nand 12th Caçadores), while the fourth consisted of Campbell’s brigade\r\n(1/5th, 2/5th, 94th, 2/83rd). The object of this formation was that\r\nthe division, when it came into action, should be able to deploy into\r\ntwo lines, without the delay that would have been caused if the third\r\nbrigade had followed in the wake of the other two[544].\r\n\r\n  [544] Wellington in his dispatch (ix. p. 302) speaks of the four\r\n  columns, D’Urban makes it clear that his own squadrons formed the\r\n  outer two, but the fact that Power’s Portuguese followed Wallace\r\n  in the 3rd column only emerges in the Regimental History of the\r\n  45th (Dalbiac), p. 103. This is quite consistent with the other\r\n  information.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the two sides came into collision was rather peculiar.\r\nThomières’s column was accompanied by the whole, or nearly the whole,\r\nof Curto’s light cavalry division, which, as one would have supposed,\r\nwould naturally have been keeping a squadron or so in advance to\r\nexplore the way, as well as others on the flanks to cover the\r\ninfantry. But it appears that this simple precaution was not taken,\r\nfor Pakenham and D’Urban met no French cavalry at all, till they had\r\ngot well in touch with the hostile infantry. Curto, we must suppose,\r\nwas marching parallel with the centre, not certainly with the head,\r\nof Thomières’s division, without any vedettes or exploring parties in\r\nfront. For D’Urban describes the first meeting as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘The enemy was marching by his left along the wooded heights, which\r\nform the southern boundary of the valley of the Arapiles, and the\r\nwestern extremity of which closes in a lower fall, which descends upon\r\nthe little stream of the Azan, near the village of Miranda. As the head\r\nof our column approached this lower fall, or hill, skirting it near its\r\nbase, and having it on our left, we became aware that we were close to\r\nthe enemy, though we could not see them owing to the trees, the dust,\r\nand the peculiar configuration of the ground. Anxious, therefore, to\r\nascertain their exact whereabouts I had ridden out a little in front,\r\nhaving with me, I think, only my brigade-major Flangini and Da Camara,\r\nwhen upon clearing the verge of a small clump of trees, a short way\r\nup the slope, I came suddenly upon the head of a French column of\r\ninfantry, having about a company in front, and marching very fast\r\nby its left. It was at once obvious that, as the columns of the 3rd\r\nDivision were marching on our left, the French must be already beyond\r\ntheir right, and consequently I ought to attack at once[545].’\r\n\r\n  [545] All this from D’Urban’s unpublished narrative in the\r\n  D’Urban papers.\r\n\r\nThis was apparently the leading battalion of the French 101st, marching\r\nwith its front absolutely uncovered by either cavalry vedettes or\r\nany exploring parties of its own. D’Urban galloped back, unseen by\r\nthe enemy, and wheeled his leading regiment, the 1st Portuguese\r\ndragoons--three weak squadrons of little over 200 sabres--into line,\r\nwith orders to charge the French battalion, before it should take the\r\nalarm and form square. The 11th Portuguese, and two squadrons of the\r\nBritish 14th Light Dragoons, which had only just arrived on the ground,\r\nbeing the foremost part of Arentschildt’s brigade, followed in support.\r\nThe charge was successful--the French were so much taken by surprise\r\nthat the only manœuvre they were able to perform was to close their\r\nsecond company upon the first, so that their front was six deep. The\r\ntwo squadrons of the Portuguese which attacked frontally suffered\r\nsevere loss, their colonel, Watson, falling severely wounded among the\r\nFrench bayonets. But the right-hand squadron, which overlapped the\r\nFrench left, broke in almost unopposed on the unformed flank of the\r\nbattalion, which then went to pieces, and was chased uphill by the\r\nwhole of the Portuguese horsemen, losing many prisoners[546].\r\n\r\n  [546] All this is from D’Urban’s narrative, and letters from\r\n  Colonel Watson to D’Urban. The colonel bitterly resented Napier’s\r\n  account of the charge (_Peninsular War_, iv. p. 268).\r\n\r\nThis sudden assault on his leading unit, which seems to have been\r\nacting as an advanced guard, and was considerably ahead of the next,\r\nmust have been sufficiently startling to Thomières, who was taken\r\nwholly unawares. But the next moment brought worse trouble: the first\r\nbrigade of the 3rd Division--Wallace’s--emerged almost simultaneously\r\nwith the cavalry charge from the scattered trees which had hitherto\r\ncovered its advance, and was seen coming uphill in beautiful order\r\nagainst him. He was caught in a long column--battalion marching behind\r\nbattalion, with considerable intervals between the regiments, of which\r\nthere were three (101st, three battalions; 62nd, two battalions; 1st,\r\nthree battalions)[547]. If he was able to see Pakenham’s supporting\r\nlines, which is a little doubtful, Thomières must have known that\r\nhe was considerably outnumbered: the British division had 5,800\r\nmen against his 4,500, while Curto’s 1,800 light cavalry were not\r\nforthcoming at the critical moment to save the situation.\r\n\r\n  [547] The division was marching left in front, so that the senior\r\n  regiment was in the rear. The fourth unit of the division (23rd\r\n  Léger) was absent, garrisoning Astorga, as was also the 2nd\r\n  battalion of the 1st, which was a very strong four-battalion\r\n  corps. Hence there were only 8 battalions out of 11 present, or\r\n  4,300 men out of 6,200.\r\n\r\nThe space between the advancing line of Wallace’s brigade and the head\r\nof the French column, when they came in sight of each other, was about\r\n1,000 yards--the time that it took to bring them into collision just\r\nsufficed to enable Thomières to make some sort of hasty disposition\r\nof his battalions: those in the rear pushed out on to the flanks\r\nof the leading regiment, and made an irregular line of columns\r\nbadly spaced. The _voltigeurs_ of each battalion had time to run to\r\nthe front: ‘their light troops,’ says a witness from the Connaught\r\nRangers, ‘hoping to take advantage of the time which our deploying\r\nfrom column into line would take, ran down the face of the hill in a\r\nstate of great excitement.’ Pakenham appears to have sent out against\r\nthem his three companies of the 5/60th and the whole of the 12th\r\nCaçadores, a skirmishing line of superior strength. Wallace’s three\r\nbattalions formed line from open column without halting, when they had\r\ngot to within 250 yards of the enemy: ‘the different companies, by\r\nthrowing forward their right shoulders, were in line without the slow\r\nmanœuvre of a deployment.’ The French fire is said to have been rather\r\nineffective, because delivered downhill. The most serious loss was that\r\ncaused by Thomières’s divisional battery, which got up and into action\r\nvery promptly. It was answered by Douglas’s battery, the divisional\r\nartillery of the 3rd Division, which unlimbered on a knoll at the edge\r\nof the wood, and sent a raking discharge uphill, against the right\r\nof the French division, shelling it over the heads of the brigade\r\nadvancing up the slope. The two Portuguese line regiments, from the\r\nrear of Wallace’s brigade, formed in support of him: Campbell’s brigade\r\nfollowed as a third line.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the French[548] stood in a group, rather than a line,\r\nof battalion columns near the brow of the hill, while Wallace’s brigade\r\ncontinued to press upwards with a front which outflanked the enemy\r\nat both ends. ‘Regardless of the fire of the _tirailleurs_, and the\r\nshower of grape and canister, the brigade continued to press onward.\r\nThe centre (88th regiment) suffered, but still advanced, the right\r\nand left (l/45th and 74th) continued to go forward at a more rapid\r\npace, and as the wings inclined forward and outstripped the centre,\r\nthe brigade assumed the form of a crescent[549].’ They were nearly at\r\nthe brow, when Thomières directed the French columns to charge down\r\nin support of his _tirailleurs_. The mass, with drums beating and\r\nloud shouts of _Vive l’Empereur_, ran forward, and the leading files\r\ndelivered a heavy fire, which told severely on the 88th. But on coming\r\nunder fire in return the French halted, and then wavered: ‘their second\r\ndischarge was unlike the first--it was irregular and ill-directed,\r\nthe men acted without concert or method: many fired in the air.’ The\r\nthree British battalions then cheered and advanced, when the enemy,\r\nhis columns already in much confusion and mixed with the wrecks of his\r\n_tirailleurs_, gave way completely, and went off in confusion along the\r\ntop of the plateau.\r\n\r\n  [548] It is not certain that the whole of the rear regiment (the\r\n  1st Line) was in the group: possibly one or two of its battalions\r\n  were not yet on the ground.\r\n\r\n  [549] Grattan, p. 245.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Curto’s _chasseurs_ at last appeared--where they\r\nhad been up to this moment does not appear, but certainly not in\r\ntheir proper place. Now, however, six or seven squadrons of them came\r\ntrotting up on the outer flank of the broken division, of whom some\r\ncharged the two battalions which formed the right of Pakenham’s first\r\nand third lines--the 1/45th and 1/5th respectively. The former, feebly\r\nattacked, threw back some companies _en potence_ and beat off their\r\nassailants easily. The latter fell back some little way, and had many\r\nmen cut up, but finally rallied in a clump and were not broken[550].\r\nTheir assailants disappeared a moment after, being driven off by\r\nArentschildt, who had just come up on Pakenham’s right with the five\r\nsquadrons of the 1st Hussars K.G.L. and 14th Light Dragoons[551].\r\nD’Urban’s Portuguese were now a little to the rear, rallying after\r\ntheir successful charge and collecting prisoners: their commander says\r\nin his narrative of this part of the battle that he never saw any\r\nFrench cavalry till later in the day, but does not dispute that the\r\n5th may have been attacked by them without his knowledge.\r\n\r\n  [550] The 1/5th lost 126 men, more than any other 3rd Division\r\n  regiment except the 88th. Sergeant Morley of the 5th, its only\r\n  Salamanca diarist, writes (p. 113): ‘There was a pause--a\r\n  hesitation. Here I blush--but I should blush more if I were\r\n  guilty of a falsehood. We retired--slowly, in good order, not\r\n  far, not 100 paces. General Pakenham approached, and very\r\n  good-naturedly said “re-form,” and after a moment “advance--there\r\n  they are, my lads--let them feel the temper of your bayonets.”\r\n  We advanced--rather slowly at first, a regiment of dragoons\r\n  which had retired with us again accompanying ... and took our\r\n  retribution for our repulse.’ The dragoon regiment was presumably\r\n  part of D’Urban’s brigade.\r\n\r\n  [551] This comes from the report of Arentschildt on the doings\r\n  of his brigade: it is not mentioned by Napier, nor is there\r\n  anything about it in Wellington’s dispatch. The time is fixed by\r\n  Arentschildt speaking of it as ‘during the attack on the first\r\n  hill.’ He says that he closed with the main body of the French\r\n  horse and drove it off.\r\n\r\nCurto’s cavalry being driven off, the 3rd Division and its attendant\r\nsquadrons pursued the broken French division of infantry along the top\r\nof the plateau, and very nearly annihilated it. Thomières was killed,\r\nhis divisional battery was captured whole; of his two leading regiments\r\nthe 101st Line lost 1,031 men out of 1,449 present: its colonel and\r\neagle were both taken with many hundred unwounded prisoners: the 62nd\r\nLine lost 868 men out of 1,123. The rear regiment, the 1st Line, got\r\noff with the comparatively trifling casualty-list of 231 out of 1,743:\r\nit was possibly not up in time to take part in resisting Pakenham’s\r\nfirst attack, and may perhaps have done no more than cover the retreat\r\nof the wrecks of the two leading regiments. The whole division was\r\nout of action as a fighting body for the rest of the day, having lost\r\n2,130 men out of a little over 4,500.[552] The victorious British 3rd\r\nDivision, whose casualties had not amounted to more than 500 of all\r\nranks, continued to press the fugitives before it, till it had gone a\r\nmile, and came in on the flank of Maucune’s division, the next unit in\r\nthe French line; D’Urban’s cavalry accompanied it close on its right\r\nflank, Arentschildt’s squadrons lay farther out, watching Curto’s\r\ndefeated first brigade of _chasseurs_, which rallied upon a reserve,\r\nhis second brigade, and made head once more against the pursuers, just\r\nabout the same time that Pakenham’s infantry began again to meet with\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n  [552] The losses in officers of the three regiments were, taking\r\n  killed and wounded only, not unwounded prisoners, 25 for the\r\n  101st, 15 for the 62nd, 5 for the 1st, by Martinien’s lists.\r\n  The British returns of prisoners sent to England, at the Record\r\n  Office, show 6 officers from the 101st, 2 from the 62nd, and 1\r\n  from the 1st, received after the battle. I presume that nearly\r\n  all the wounded, both officers and rank and file, count among the\r\n  prisoners. The 1st entered in its regimental report 176 _tués\r\n  ou pris_, 22 _blessés_, 29 _disparus_: here the only people who\r\n  got away would be the 22 _blessés_. The regimental return of the\r\n  101st shows 31 officers wanting--which seems to correspond to the\r\n  25 killed and wounded plus the 6 prisoners sent to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA: THE MAIN ENGAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now turn from the exploits of Pakenham and the 3rd Division to\r\ndeal with the great central attack of Wellington’s frontal striking\r\nforce, the 5th and 4th Divisions, under Leith and Cole, upon the French\r\nleft centre. They had been told to move on when Bradford’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade should be sufficiently near to cover the right flank of the\r\n5th Division, and the necessity of waiting for this support caused\r\ntheir attack to be delivered perceptibly later than that of Pakenham.\r\nLeith had drawn out his division in two lines, the first consisting\r\nof Greville’s brigade (3/1st, 1/9th, and both battalions of the\r\n38th) and the first battalion of the 4th, brought up from the rear\r\nbrigade (Pringle’s) to equalize the front of the two lines: the second\r\nconsisted of the rest of that brigade (the second battalion of the\r\n4th, the 2/30th, and 2/44th) and the Portuguese of Spry (3rd and 15th\r\nLine). There was a heavy skirmishing line in front, composed of all the\r\nBritish light companies and the 8th Caçadores[553]. Cole had a smaller\r\nforce, as his left brigade (Anson’s) had been told off to the defence\r\nof the British Arapile: the 3/27th was holding that rocky knoll, the\r\n1/40th was at its foot in support. Only therefore the Fusilier brigade\r\n(under Ellis of the 23rd) and Stubbs’s Portuguese formed the attacking\r\nforce. They were in a single line of seven battalions, with a heavy\r\nskirmishing screen composed of four light companies and the whole of\r\nthe 7th Caçadores[554]. The Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division went\r\nthrough the end of the village of Arapiles, which it did by files from\r\nthe right of companies, the companies forming up again on the east side\r\nof the place, upon their sergeants regularly sent out as markers. This\r\ndefile delayed the advance of the division, which therefore attacked\r\ndecidedly later than Leith’s men, the joint movement being in an\r\néchelon, with the right leading and the left considerably refused. It\r\nwas obvious that when the 4th Division drew near to the French line\r\non the plateau, it would be exposing its left flank to the hostile\r\ndivision (Bonnet’s) which was massed on and near the Greater Arapile.\r\nWellington had noted this, and had given special discretionary orders\r\nto Pack, directing him to use his independent brigade for the sole\r\npurpose of protecting the near flank of the 4th Division; he might\r\nattack the Arapile, as the best means of holding back Bonnet from\r\ndescending against Cole’s line, or might manœuvre below the knoll for\r\nthe same purpose. When the dangerous moment came, Pack, as we shall\r\nsee, took the bull by the horns, and assailed the precipitous height in\r\nfront with his whole 2,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [553] All this from Leith Hay, ii. p. 53. The 1/38th had joined\r\n  from Lisbon only twelve hours back.\r\n\r\n  [554] This is proved by the narrative of the Brunswick captain,\r\n  Wachholz, who commanded the company of that corps attached to the\r\n  Fusilier brigade.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the 4th Division the 6th was now coming up the back\r\nslope of the hill behind the Arapile in second line: similarly the 7th\r\nDivision was following the 5th. To the right of the 7th, Stapleton\r\nCotton was moving up from Las Torres with the cavalry reserve, now\r\nconsisting only of the six regiments of Le Marchant and G. Anson.\r\nBradford, more to the right still, and not yet in line with Leith and\r\nCole, moved with España’s small Spanish division behind him.\r\n\r\nOf Wellington’s front line Leith with the 5th Division had Maucune in\r\nfront of him: Cole would have to deal with Clausel, who had arrived\r\nlate on the ground, and was only just taking up his position on the\r\nextreme right end of the French plateau. Pack and W. Anson’s detached\r\nbrigade from the 4th Division, with the Lesser Arapile in their\r\npower, looked across the valley at Bonnet, massed around its greater\r\ntwin-hill. The British attacking line was amply provided with reserves:\r\nthe defensive line of the French was still very thin, though Brennier’s\r\ndivision was hurrying up from the head of the wood to support Maucune.\r\nSarrut’s division was still invisible in the forest far to the rear:\r\nFerey’s was better seen--it was hastening up across the open ground on\r\nits way from the extreme French right, but must obviously be too late\r\nto join in meeting Wellington’s first attack.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the cannon and musketry away in the direction of the Pico\r\nde Miranda had been announcing for some time that Pakenham was at\r\nclose grips with Thomières, before Leith marched down from his heights\r\nto cross the valley that separated him from Maucune’s position. Soon\r\nafter five, however, the 5th Division was in close contact with the\r\nenemy, having suffered a considerable amount of casualties in reaching\r\nhim, mainly from the very superior French artillery fire, which swept\r\nevery yard of the glacis-like slope that ascends from the bottom of\r\nthe Arapiles valley to the brow of the plateau that forms its southern\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n‘The ground,’ writes Leith Hay, ‘between the advancing force and that\r\nwhich it was to assail was crowded by the light troops of both sides in\r\nextended order, carrying on a very incessant _tiraillade_. The general\r\ndesired me to ride forward, to make our light infantry press up the\r\nheights to cover his line of march, and to bid them, if practicable,\r\nmake a rush at the enemy’s guns. Our light troops soon drove in those\r\nopposed to them: the cannon were removed to the rear: every obstruction\r\nto the general advance of our line vanished. In front of the centre\r\nof that beautiful line rode General Leith, directing its movements.\r\nOccasionally every soldier was visible, the sun shining bright upon\r\ntheir arms, though at intervals all were enveloped in a dense cloud of\r\ndust, from whence at times issued the animating cheer of the British\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALAMANCA]\r\n\r\n‘The French columns, retired from the crest of the heights, were formed\r\nin squares, about fifty yards behind the line at which, when arrived,\r\nthe British regiments would become visible. Their artillery, although\r\nplaced more to the rear, still poured its fire upon our advancing\r\ntroops. We were now near the summit of the ridge. The men marched with\r\nthe same orderly steadiness as at the first: no advance in line at a\r\nreview was ever more correctly executed: the dressing was admirable,\r\nand the gaps caused by casualties were filled up with the most perfect\r\nregularity. General Leith and the officers of his staff, being on\r\nhorseback, first perceived the enemy, and had time to observe his\r\nformation, before our infantry line became so visible as to induce him\r\nto commence firing. He was drawn up in contiguous squares, the front\r\nrank kneeling, and prepared to fire when the drum should beat. All\r\nwas still and quiet in these squares: not a musket was discharged until\r\nthe whole opened. Nearly at the same instant General Leith ordered our\r\nline to fire and charge. At this moment the last thing I saw through\r\nthe smoke was the plunge of the horse of Colonel Greville, commanding\r\nthe leading brigade, who, shot through the head, reared and fell back\r\non his rider. In an instant every individual present was enveloped in\r\nsmoke and obscurity. No serious struggle for ascendancy followed, for\r\nthe French squares were penetrated, broken, and discomfited, and the\r\nvictorious 5th Division pressed forward no longer against troops formed\r\nup, but against a mass of disorganized men flying in all directions....\r\nWhen close to the enemy’s squares Leith had been severely wounded and\r\nreluctantly forced to quit the field; at the same moment I was hit\r\nmyself, and my horse killed by a musket-ball: thus removed, I cannot\r\ndetail the further movements of the division[555].’\r\n\r\n  [555] Leith Hay, ii. pp. 57-8.\r\n\r\nIn this clear and simple narrative the most remarkable point is Leith\r\nHay’s distinct statement that the French received the charge of the\r\n5th Division in a line of squares, a most strange formation to adopt\r\nagainst infantry advancing deployed, even when it was supplemented by\r\na strong screen of _tirailleurs_, and flanked by several batteries\r\nof artillery. It is possible that Maucune adopted it because, from\r\nhis commanding position on the plateau, he could see a considerable\r\nbody of cavalry coming up on Leith’s right rear. This was composed\r\nof the brigades of Le Marchant and G. Anson, which Stapleton Cotton\r\nwas bringing up to the front by Wellington’s orders. While Leith\r\nwas advancing they pressed forward, Le Marchant leading, and passed\r\nup the hill in the interval between the 5th Division and Pakenham’s\r\nfront--leaving behind them Bradford, who had crossed the valley\r\nparallel to, but much behind, the right of Leith. Bradford had no\r\nsolid body of troops in front of him, being outside Maucune’s extreme\r\nleft, and suffered practically no loss--the total casualty list of his\r\nbrigade that day was only seventeen men. This contrasts marvellously\r\nwith the loss of Leith’s front line, where Greville’s brigade in their\r\ntriumphant advance lost 350 men--mainly from the artillery fire\r\nendured while the long slope of the French plateau was being mounted:\r\nfor there were at least four batteries aligned on Maucune’s right, and\r\ntheir guns had been worked till the last possible minute.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the cause of the formation in square adopted by the French\r\ndivision, it would have been fortunate if only it could have preserved\r\nthat formation a little longer; for precisely when it had lost its\r\norder, and fallen back before Leith’s shattering volleys of musketry,\r\nLe Marchant’s heavy dragoons arrived upon the crest of the plateau. No\r\nbetter opportunity for the use of cavalry could have been conceived,\r\nthan that which existed at this moment. Infantry already engaged with,\r\nand worsted by, other infantry is the destined prey of cavalry coming\r\non the scene from the flank in unbroken order. Le Marchant had received\r\nhis instructions directly from Wellington, who had told him to ‘charge\r\nin at all hazards[556],’ when he saw the French battalions on the\r\nplateau hotly engaged. He had formed his 1,000 sabres in two lines,\r\nthe 5th Dragoon Guards and 4th Dragoons in front, the 3rd Dragoons\r\nin support, and had come over the sky-line and trotted down into the\r\nvalley just as Leith’s division got to close quarters with Maucune.\r\nPassing Bradford on his right, he came to the crest to find all\r\nconfusion in front of him. The squares that Leith had just broken were\r\nrolling back in disorder: directly behind a new division (Brennier’s),\r\nonly just arriving upon the field, was beginning to form up, to cover\r\nand support the shaken battalions. Some distance to their left rear the\r\nremains of Thomières’s division, in a disorderly crowd, were falling\r\nback in front of the triumphant advance of Pakenham.\r\n\r\n  [556] See Le Marchant’s _Life_, from notes supplied by his son,\r\n  in Cole’s _Peninsular Generals_, ii. p. 281.\r\n\r\nLe Marchant charged in diagonally upon the flank of Maucune’s left\r\nbrigade, and caught the two battalions of the 66th regiment falling\r\nback from the crest. The Frenchmen were courageous enough to make a\r\ndesperate attempt to club themselves together in a solid mass: their\r\nrear ranks faced about and opened a heavy fire upon the advancing\r\nsquadrons. But it was given with uncertain aim and trifling effect, and\r\nbefore they could reload the dragoons were among them. A desperate\r\nminority attempted to resist with the bayonet, and were sabred: some\r\nhundreds cast down their muskets, raised their hands, and asked\r\nquarter. The rear ranks scattered and fled southward across the\r\nplateau. Leaving the gathering up of the prisoners to the infantry of\r\nLeith, Le Marchant led his brigade, so soon as some order could be\r\nrestored, against the next regiment of Maucune’s division, the 15th\r\nLine; they were better prepared for resistance than the 66th, which\r\nhad been caught quite unawares, they showed a regular front, and gave\r\na more effective fire. Many of the dragoons fell; but nevertheless\r\ntheir impetus carried them through the mass, which went to pieces and\r\ndispersed into a disorderly crowd: it fled in the same direction as the\r\nwrecks of the 66th.\r\n\r\nLe Marchant’s brigade had now lost its formation, ‘the three regiments\r\nhad become mixed together, the officers rode where they could find\r\nplaces: but a good front, without intervals, was still maintained, and\r\nthere was no confusion[557].’ In front of them there was now a fresh\r\nenemy--the 22nd Line, the leading regiment of the division of Brennier,\r\nwhich had just arrived on the field, and was getting into order to\r\nsave and support Maucune’s routed battalions. It would seem that in\r\nthe midst of the dust and smoke, and surrounded and interfered with by\r\nthe fugitives of the broken regiments, the 22nd had either no time or\r\nno good opportunity for forming squares: they were found in _colonne\r\nserrée_, in good order, partly covered by a clump of trees, an outlying\r\nthicket from the great forest to their rear. They reserved their fire,\r\nwith great composure, till the dragoons were within ten yards distance,\r\nand poured a volley so close and well aimed upon the leading squadron\r\n[5th Dragoon Guards] that nearly a fourth of them fell. Tremendous\r\nas was the effect of the discharge, the dragoons were not arrested:\r\nthey broke in through the opposing bayonets, and plunged into the\r\ndense masses of the enemy. In the combat which ensued, broadsword\r\nand bayonet were used against each other with various results: the\r\nFrench, hewn down and trampled under the horses’ feet, offered all the\r\nresistance that brave men could make. Le Marchant himself had some\r\nnarrow escapes--he fought like a private, and had to cut down more\r\nthan one of the enemy. It was only after a fierce struggle that the\r\nFrench yielded, and he had the satisfaction of seeing them fly before\r\nhim in helpless confusion. The brigade had now lost all order: the\r\ndragoons, excited by the struggle, vied with each other in the pursuit,\r\nand galloped recklessly into the crowd of fugitives, sabring those who\r\ncame within their reach. To restrain them at such a moment was beyond\r\nthe power of their officers[558].’\r\n\r\n  [557] _Life of Le Marchant_, p. 285.\r\n\r\n  [558] _Life of Le Marchant_, pp. 286-7.\r\n\r\nLe Marchant endeavoured to keep a few men in hand, in order to guard\r\nagainst any attempt of the French to rally, but he had only about\r\nhalf a squadron of the 4th Dragoons with him, when he came upon some\r\ncompanies which were beginning to re-form in the edge of the great\r\nwood. He led his party against them, and drove them back among the\r\ntrees, where they dispersed. But at the moment of contact he was shot\r\ndead, by a ball which entered his groin and broke his spine. Thus fell\r\nan officer of whom great things had been expected by all who knew him,\r\nin the moment when he had just obtained and used to the full his first\r\nchance of leading his brigade in a general action. One of the few\r\nscientific soldiers in the cavalry arm whom the British army owned, Le\r\nMarchant had been mainly known as the founder and administrator of the\r\nRoyal Military College at High Wycombe, which was already beginning to\r\nsend to the front many young officers trained as their predecessors\r\nhad never been. He was the author of many military pamphlets, and\r\nof a new system of sword exercise which had lately been adopted for\r\nthe cavalry[559]. On his promotion to the rank of Major-General, in\r\n1811, he had been unexpectedly sent to the Peninsula in command of\r\nthe heavy brigade, which reinforced Wellington during that autumn. As\r\nan executive commander in the field he had given the first proofs of\r\nhis ability at the combat of Villagarcia[560]--but this was a small\r\naffair--at Salamanca he proved himself a born commander of cavalry, and\r\nhis services would have been invaluable to Wellington in later fields\r\nbut for the disastrous shot that ended his career. He was a man of a\r\nlofty and religious spirit, ill to be spared by his country[561].\r\n\r\n  [559] Le Marchant was also an admirable artist in water colours.\r\n  I saw many of his pleasing sketches of Peninsular landscapes when\r\n  his grandson, Sir Henry Le Marchant, allowed me to look through\r\n  his correspondence and notes.\r\n\r\n  [560] See p. 277 above.\r\n\r\n  [561] I have read with respect his admirable letters to his\r\n  family. ‘I never go into battle,’ he said, ‘without subjecting\r\n  myself to a strict self-examination: when, having (as I hope)\r\n  humbly made my peace with God, I leave the result in His hands,\r\n  with perfect confidence that He will determine what is best for\r\n  me.’\r\n\r\nLe Marchant’s charge made a complete wreck of the left wing of the\r\nFrench army. The remnants of the eight battalions which he had broken\r\nfled eastward in a confused mass, towards the edge of the woods,\r\nbecoming blended with the separate stream of fugitives from Thomières’s\r\ndivision. The 5th Division swept in some 1,500 prisoners from them, as\r\nalso the eagle of the 22nd Line, which the heavy brigade had broken in\r\ntheir last effort, while five guns were taken by the 4th Dragoons[562].\r\nThe French, flying blindly from the pursuit, were so scattered that\r\nsome of them actually ran in headlong among D’Urban’s Portuguese horse,\r\non the back side of the plateau. ‘We were so far in their rear,’\r\nwrites that officer, ‘that a mass of their routed infantry (to our\r\nastonishment, since we did not know the cause) in the wildness of their\r\npanic and confusion, and throwing away their arms, actually ran against\r\nour horses, where many of them fell down exhausted, and incapable of\r\nfurther movement.’ The same happened in the front of the 3rd Division,\r\nwhere, according to a narrator in the Connaught Rangers, ‘hundreds of\r\nmen frightfully disfigured, black with dust, worn out with fatigue,\r\nand covered with sabre-cuts and blood, threw themselves among us for\r\nsafety.’\r\n\r\n  [562] It is vexatious to find that neither the 22nd nor the 66th\r\n  was among the fourteen Salamanca regiments of which detailed\r\n  casualty lists survive. The 15th Line returned 15 officers and\r\n  359 men as their loss. Martinien’s tables show 21 officers\r\n  lost in the 22nd, and 17 in the 66th. The deficits of these\r\n  two regiments as shown by the muster-rolls of August 1 were\r\n  respectively about 750 and 500, but these do not represent their\r\n  total losses, as all the regiments present at the battle had\r\n  picked up many men at their dépôts at Valladolid, and from the\r\n  small evacuated posts, before August 1, e.g. the 15th had 52\r\n  officers present on July 15, lost 15 at Salamanca, but showed 46\r\n  present on August 1; 9 officers must have joined from somewhere\r\n  in the interim. So the 66th had 38 officers present on July 15,\r\n  lost 17, but showed 34 present on August 1. Thirteen more must\r\n  have arrived, and accompanied of course by the corresponding rank\r\n  and file.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Division had now, in its advance along the plateau, come in\r\ncontact with the right flank of the fifth, and both of them fell into\r\none line reaching across the whole breadth of the heights, while in\r\nfront of them were recoiling the wrecks of Thomières, Maucune, and\r\nBrennier. The four French regiments which had not been caught in Le\r\nMarchant’s charge were still keeping together, and making occasional\r\nattempts at a stand, but were always outflanked on their left by the\r\n3rd Division and Arentschildt’s and D’Urban’s horse. Curto’s French\r\nlight cavalry had rallied, and picked up their second brigade, and were\r\nnow doing their best to cover the southern flank of the retreating\r\nmultitude[563]. An officer of one of their regiments speaks in his\r\nmemoirs of having charged with advantage against red dragoons--these\r\nmust apparently have been scattered parties of Le Marchant’s brigade,\r\npursuing far and furiously, since no other red-coated cavalry was in\r\nthis part of the field[564]. But Curto’s squadrons had mainly to do\r\nwith Arentschildt and D’Urban, both of whom report sharp fighting with\r\nFrench horse at this moment. The 3rd French Hussars charged the 1st\r\nHussars K.G.L., while the latter were employed in gleaning prisoners\r\nfrom the routed infantry, and were only driven off after a severe\r\ncombat[565]. The pursuit then continued until the disordered French\r\nmasses were driven off the plateau, and on to the wooded hills parallel\r\nwith the Greater Arapile, where Marmont had massed his army before his\r\nfatal move to the left.\r\n\r\n  [563] The regiments of Maucune’s brigade, which did not get\r\n  caught in the cavalry charge (82nd and 86th), lost only 8 and 3\r\n  officers respectively, as against the 15 and 17 lost by the 66th\r\n  and 15th. Of Brennier’s division the 22nd Line had 21 casualties\r\n  among officers, while the 65th and 17th Léger had only 3 and 9\r\n  respectively.\r\n\r\n  [564] So Parquin of the 13th Chasseurs in his _Mémoires_, p. 302.\r\n  The only other red-coated dragoons in Wellington’s army, Bock’s\r\n  brigade, were far away to the left.\r\n\r\n  [565] Arentschildt reports that his and D’Urban’s men were all\r\n  mixed and busy with the French infantry, when the French hussars\r\n  charged in, and that he rallied, to beat them off, a body\r\n  composed mostly of his own Germans, but with Portuguese and 14th\r\n  Light Dragoons among them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the 4th Division and Pack’s Portuguese had fought, with much\r\nless fortunate results, against the French divisions of Clausel and\r\nBonnet. There are good narratives of their advance from three officers\r\nwho took part in it, all so full and clear that it is impossible\r\nto have any doubts about its details. One comes from the Assistant\r\nQuarter-Master-General of the 4th Division, Charles Vere: the second\r\nis from the captain commanding one of the four light companies of the\r\nFusilier brigade, Ludwig von Wachholz of the Brunswick-Oels Jägers:\r\nthe third is the narrative of Pack’s aide-de-camp, Charles Synge,\r\nwho was with the front line of the Portuguese in their vigorous but\r\nunsuccessful attack on the Greater Arapile. The three narratives have\r\nnothing contradictory in them.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of events was as follows. After deploying the three\r\nbattalions of the Fusilier brigade (1/7th, 1/23rd, 1/48th) beyond the\r\nend of the village of Arapiles, and Stubbs’s Portuguese brigade to\r\ntheir left, Cole started to cross the valley, having a very strong\r\nskirmishing line, composed of the whole of the 7th Caçadores and of the\r\nfour light companies of the British brigade. During the first stage of\r\nthe advance, which started at 5.45[566], a perceptible time after that\r\nof the 5th Division, the two brigades suffered severely from French\r\nartillery fire, but had no infantry opposed to them. Their objective\r\nwas the division of Clausel, which had by this time come into line on\r\nthe extreme eastern end of the plateau occupied by Maucune. When the\r\nadvancing line had reached the trough of the valley which separated it\r\nfrom the French heights, Cole saw that his left front was faced by a\r\ndetached French force[567] on a low rocky ridge half-way between the\r\nend of the plateau and the Great Arapile, and also that behind the\r\nArapile, and in a position to support this detachment, were several\r\nother French battalions. Pack was deploying to assault the Arapile,\r\nbut even if he won a first success there was visible a considerable\r\nmass of troops behind it. After the valley was crossed Stubbs’s\r\nPortuguese brigade, coming first into action, with the caçadores in\r\nfront, attacked the French regiment on the knoll and drove it back.\r\nIt retired towards the Arapile and the bulk of Bonnet’s division, to\r\nwhich it belonged. Cole detached his caçador battalion to follow it,\r\nhoping that Pack might succeed in ‘containing’ the rest of the French\r\nforce in this direction. The remainder of his line pushed on, with\r\nthe light companies of the Fusilier brigade acting as its screen, and\r\nattacked Clausel on the plateau. The advance was steady, but cost many\r\nlives, and the line was enfiladed by a tiresome flank fire from the\r\nFrench guns on the top of the Great Arapile. Nevertheless the crest\r\nwas reached--on it lay the front line of the French division--five\r\nbattalions--which engaged in a furious frontal combat of musketry with\r\nthe Fusiliers and their Portuguese comrades, but was beaten in it, and\r\nfell back some 200 yards on to its reserves. The impetus of the attack\r\nwas exhausted, Cole had just been wounded, so that there was a gap\r\nin the command, and the troops were re-forming and recovering their\r\nbreath, when it was seen that things were going very badly behind and\r\nto the left. The attack on the Arapile had by this time been delivered,\r\nand had failed completely.\r\n\r\n  [566] The moment is fixed by Wachholz, who says that he looked at\r\n  his watch, to fix the hour.\r\n\r\n  [567] This was the 122nd (three battalions), of Bonnet’s\r\n  division, which Marmont says (see above, p. 430) that he had\r\n  placed as a connecting-link between the Arapile and the troops on\r\n  the plateau.\r\n\r\nPack had grasped the fact that when the 4th Division had crossed\r\nthe valley, it would be much at the mercy of Bonnet’s troops in the\r\ndirection of the Arapile, which were now on its flank, and would\r\npresently be almost in its rear. He therefore resolved to use the\r\noption of attacking that Wellington had given him. He deployed the 4th\r\nCaçadores as a skirmishing line, gave them as an immediate support\r\nthe four grenadier companies of his line regiments, and followed with\r\nthe rest in two columns, the 1st Line on the right, the 16th on the\r\nleft. The caçadores went up the comparatively level field which formed\r\nthe central slope between the two rocky ends of the Arapile--it was\r\nsown with rye some three feet high that year. French skirmishers in\r\nsmall numbers gave way before them, but the main opposition of the\r\nenemy was from his battery placed on the summit. The skirmishing line\r\ngot four-fifths of the way to the crest, and then found an obstacle\r\nbefore it, a bank of some four feet high, where the field ended. It was\r\nperpendicular, and men scrambling up it had to sling their muskets, or\r\nto lay them down, so as to be able to use both hands. The caçadores\r\nwere just tackling the bank--a few of them were over it--when the\r\nFrench regiment on top, the 120th, which had been waiting till the\r\nPortuguese should reach the obstacle, delivered a shattering volley\r\nand charged. The caçadores were quite helpless, being more engaged\r\nin climbing than in using their arms[568]. They were swept off in a\r\nmoment, and the French, jumping down into the field, pursued them\r\nvigorously, and overthrew first the supporting grenadier companies,\r\nand then the two regiments, which were caught half-way up the slope.\r\nAs Napier truly observes, ‘the Portuguese were scoffed at for their\r\nfailure--but unjustly: no troops could have withstood that crash upon\r\nsuch steep ground, and the propriety of attacking the hill at all seems\r\nquestionable.’ Pack made the attempt purely because he thought that it\r\nwas the only way of taking off the attention of the French from Cole’s\r\nflank. The brigade suffered heavily, losing 386 men in ten minutes. It\r\ntook refuge at the foot of the British Arapile, where it was covered by\r\nthe 1/40th of Anson’s brigade, which was standing there in reserve.\r\n\r\n  [568] All this from the journal of Chas. Synge, Pack’s\r\n  aide-de-camp, who was with the caçadores, and was desperately\r\n  wounded at the bank, in the first clash. It was printed in the\r\n  _Nineteenth Century_ for July 1912.\r\n\r\nThe French brigadier in command on the Greater Arapile wisely made\r\nlittle attempt to pursue Pack’s fugitives, but having his front now\r\nclear of any danger, sallied out from behind his hill with three\r\nregiments, the 118th and 119th and the re-formed 122nd, against the\r\nflank and rear of the British 4th Division. There was nothing in front\r\nof him save the 7th Caçadores, which Cole had detached as a covering\r\nforce, when he stormed the heights with the remainder of the brigades\r\nof Ellis and Stubbs. This isolated battalion behaved very well, it\r\nstood its ground in line, but was absolutely overwhelmed and broken up\r\nby the superior numbers converging on it[569].\r\n\r\n  [569] See Vere’s _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 36.\r\n\r\nNearly at the same moment Clausel’s whole force in column charged the\r\ntwo brigades of the 4th Division which had carried the heights. The\r\nFrench were in superior numbers--ten battalions to seven--and their two\r\nreserve regiments were fresh troops, acting against men who had just\r\nwon a dearly-bought success by a great effort. The Anglo-Portuguese\r\nline gave way, from the left first, where the 23rd Portuguese began\r\nthe movement. But it spread down the whole front, and the Fusiliers,\r\nno less than Stubbs’s brigade, recoiled to the very foot of the\r\nplateau[570].\r\n\r\n  [570] All this from Wachholz, who was now with the 7th Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nThis reverse gave Clausel, who was now in command since Bonnet’s wound,\r\nan opportunity that looked unlikely a few minutes before. He could\r\neither withdraw the Army of Portugal in retreat, covering the three\r\ndisorganized divisions with those which were still intact--his own,\r\nBonnet’s, and the two reserve divisions of Ferey and Sarrut, which had\r\njust come on the ground--Foy was far off and otherwise engaged--or\r\nhe might adopt a bolder policy, and attempt to take advantage of the\r\ndisaster to Pack and Cole, by bursting into the gap between Leith and\r\nthe British Arapile, and trying to break Wellington’s centre. Being an\r\nambitious and resolute man he chose the latter alternative--though it\r\nwas a dangerous one when Leith and Pakenham were bearing in hard upon\r\nhis routed left wing. Accordingly he left Sarrut to rally and cover the\r\nthree beaten divisions, and attacked with his right centre. His own\r\ndivision followed the retreating brigades of Ellis and Stubbs down the\r\nheights, while the three disposable regiments of Bonnet came into line\r\nto its right, and Boyer’s three regiments of dragoons advanced down the\r\ndepression between the Greater Arapile and the recovered plateau. Ferey\r\nwas left in second line or reserve on the crest.\r\n\r\nAt first the advance had considerable success. Bonnet’s regiments\r\npushed forward on the right, driving in the 1/40th[571], which had\r\ncome forward to cover Pack’s routed battalions, and pressing quite\r\nclose to the British Arapile, whose battery was turned upon them with\r\nmuch effect. Clausel’s own division pushed the Fusiliers some way\r\ndown the slope and right into the valley at its foot. The dragoons\r\ncharged Stubbs’s retreating Portuguese, and cut up many of them,\r\nthough the 11th regiment finally succeeded in forming square with what\r\nremained solid of its companies, and beat off the main attack. Part\r\nof the French horsemen, however, pushed on, and reached the front of\r\nWellington’s reserve line, the 6th Division, which had now descended\r\nthe heights to relieve the broken 4th. One battalion of Hulse’s\r\nbrigade, the 2/53rd, was charged by several squadrons, but formed\r\nsquare in time and repulsed them. Some little way to the right the\r\nFusiliers and the Portuguese 23rd formed a large parti-coloured square,\r\nexpecting a similar attack, but it did not come their way[572].\r\n\r\n  [571] See Vere’s _Marches of the 4th Division_, p. 36. The 3/27th\r\n  on top of the hill was not brought forward, as some wrongly say.\r\n\r\n  [572] This from Wachholz’s narrative, very clearly explained. The\r\n  Fusiliers were _not_ relieved by the advance of the 1/40th and\r\n  3/27th, as some authorities state.\r\n\r\nWellington, thanks to his own prescience, had ample reserves with which\r\nto parry Clausel’s desperate stroke. Setting aside the Light Division,\r\nwhich now paired off against Foy on the extreme left of the field,\r\nthere were the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, not to speak of Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese and España’s Spaniards, all of them perfectly intact. And\r\nof these, such was his strength, only one fresh unit, Clinton’s 6th\r\nDivision, required to be brought up to turn the day. It was now coming\r\nover the valley where the 4th had preceded it, in a long majestic line,\r\nHulse’s brigade on the right, Hinde’s on the left, the Portuguese of\r\nthe Conde de Rezende in second line. The 1st Division, if it had been\r\nneeded, could have supported Clinton, from its post just to the north\r\nof the Lesser Arapile, but had not yet got under way.\r\n\r\nThe repulse of the new French attack was carried out with no great\r\ndifficulty, if not without serious fighting. The advance of Clausel’s\r\nown division was checked by Marshal Beresford, who took Spry’s\r\nPortuguese brigade out of the second line of the victorious 5th\r\nDivision, and led it diagonally along the southern slope of the plateau\r\nto fall upon Clausel’s flank. This it did effectively, for the French\r\ndivision could not dare to press on against the Fusiliers, and had to\r\nthrow back its left, and form up opposite Spry, with whom it became\r\nengaged in a lively musketry fight. It could no longer move forward,\r\nand was immobilized, though it held its own: Beresford was wounded in\r\nthe chest and taken to the rear, but Spry’s five battalions had served\r\nthe desired purpose, and stopped the French advance in this quarter.\r\n\r\nBut the decisive check to Clausel’s offensive was given by Clinton and\r\nthe 6th Division, who advancing straight before them--over the ground\r\npreviously traversed by Cole--fell upon, overlapped at both ends,\r\nand thoroughly discomfited in close musketry duel the nine battalions\r\nof Bonnet’s division, which had pressed forward close to the Lesser\r\nArapile, as if to insert a wedge in the British line. Unsupported by\r\nBoyer’s dragoons, who had shot their bolt too early, and were now\r\nre-forming far to the rear, this French division was badly cut up. Each\r\nof the three regiments which had taken part in its advance lost more\r\nthan 500 men in the struggle[573]: they fell back in disorder towards\r\nthe hill behind them, and their rout compelled Clausel’s division to\r\ngive way also, since it exposed its flank to the oncoming line of\r\nHulse’s brigade on Clinton’s right. Moreover the Great Arapile had to\r\nbe evacuated, for while the routed troops passed away to its left rear,\r\nthe 1st British Division was soon after seen steadily advancing towards\r\nits right. The regiment on the hill (the 120th) was exposed to be cut\r\noff and surrounded, and hastily ran down the back of the mount: while\r\nretreating it was much molested by the skirmishers of the German Legion\r\nBrigade of the 1st Division. It lost heavily, and the battery that had\r\nbeen on the summit was captured before it could get away.\r\n\r\n  [573] The 122nd lost 21 officers and 508 men, the 118th and\r\n  119th probably as many or more--they had respectively 20 and\r\n  26 officers hit. The 120th, the regiment on the Great Arapile,\r\n  lost only 8 officers--but 580 men, an almost inexplicable\r\n  disproportion. The 118th claimed to have taken a flag--perhaps\r\n  one of the 7th Portuguese Caçadores, who were badly cut up when\r\n  Bonnet first advanced.\r\n\r\nThus Clausel’s brief half-hour of triumph ended in complete disaster,\r\nand the two divisions with which he had made his stroke were flung back\r\nagainst the slope in front of the woods in their rear, where they took\r\nrefuge behind the intact division of Ferey, the sole available reserve\r\nin this part of the field. They were now as badly beaten as Thomières\r\nand Maucune had been earlier in the day[574].\r\n\r\n  [574] The losses of three of Clausel’s four regiments chance to\r\n  have been preserved--the 25th Léger lost 16 officers and 322 men:\r\n  the 27th Ligne 7 officers and 159 men: the 59th Ligne 17 officers\r\n  and 253 men. The 50th, which had 26 officers hit, must have\r\n  had more casualties than any of the other three, so the total\r\n  divisional loss must have been well over 1,200. But Bonnet’s\r\n  division, much worse mauled, lost at least 2,200.\r\n\r\nWhile this lively action was in progress, the 5th and 3rd Divisions,\r\nsupported by the 7th and by Bradford’s Portuguese, in second line,\r\nand assisted on their flanks by Arentschildt’s, D’Urban’s, and Anson’s\r\nhorse, had been driving in the wrecks of the French left wing towards\r\nthe woods. There was much resistance: on Sarrut’s intact battalions\r\nmany of the broken regiments had rallied. ‘These men, besmeared with\r\nblood, dust, and clay, half naked, and some carrying only broken\r\nweapons, fought with a fury not to be surpassed,’ says a 3rd Division\r\nnarrator of the battle. But the tide of battle was always moving\r\nbackward, towards the woods from which the French had originally\r\nissued, and though it sometimes seemed about to stop for a minute or\r\ntwo, a new outflanking manœuvre by the troops of Pakenham, D’Urban, and\r\nArentschildt, sufficed on each occasion to set it in motion again.\r\n\r\nThe last stage of the conflict had now been reached: the French centre\r\nwas as thoroughly beaten as their left had been earlier in the day:\r\nmany of the battalions had gone completely to pieces, and were pouring\r\ninto the woods and making their way to the rear, with no thought\r\nexcept for their personal safety. Of intact troops there were only\r\ntwo divisions left, Ferey’s in the centre, and Foy’s on the extreme\r\nright near Calvarisa de Ariba. It was generally considered that Foy\r\nought to have been overwhelmed by the much superior British force\r\nin front of him, for not only was he opposed by the Light Division,\r\nwhose skirmishers had been bickering with him all the afternoon, but\r\nthe 1st Division became available for use against him the moment that\r\nit was clear that the French offensive against the 4th Division had\r\nbeen shattered, by the advance of Clinton and Spry. Wellington, it is\r\nsaid[575], dispatched orders for the 1st Division to move forward and\r\nstrike in between Foy and the Greater Arapile, at the moment that he\r\nsaw that the 6th Division had broken Bonnet’s troops. If so, the order\r\nwas not executed, and General Campbell led out his three brigades much\r\ntoo late, and not in time either to cut off Foy or to encircle the\r\nright of the disordered mass of the enemy now retiring into the woods.\r\nHe seems to have acted simply as a link between the 6th Division on his\r\nright, and the Light Division on his left, for the latter alone pressed\r\nFoy vigorously. The only part of Campbell’s division which suffered\r\nany appreciable loss at this time of the day were the light companies\r\nof Löwe’s brigade--that which was composed of the King’s German Legion:\r\nthey fell on the flank of the French regiment that was evacuating the\r\nGreater Arapile, and did it considerable harm[576].\r\n\r\n  [575] This is stated by Napier, iv. p. 273, and seems reasonable.\r\n  See also Tomkinson, p. 186.\r\n\r\n  [576] The losses in Campbell’s Guards’ brigade (62 men) were in\r\n  the companies which defended the village of Arapiles earlier in\r\n  the day--those in his line brigade (Wheatley’s) were trifling--16\r\n  wounded and no killed. The K.G.L. brigade lost 60 or so, all in\r\n  the light companies, during the advance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the last and not the least bloody fighting of the day was\r\nbeginning, on the hillside just outside the head of the forest, where\r\nMarmont had deployed his main body at midday, and where Ferey’s\r\ndivision was now standing in reserve, while the broken troops both from\r\nits front and from its flank were streaming by to the rear. Clausel\r\nhad given Ferey orders to cover the retreat at all costs, warning him\r\nthat unless he could hold back the advancing enemy for some time the\r\ndisaster would be complete. The general to whom this unenviable task\r\nwas assigned carried it out with splendid courage, and by his constancy\r\ngave time for the escape of the whole of the confused mass behind him.\r\nHe drew out his nine battalions in a single line, the centre a little\r\nadvanced to suit the shape of the hillside, the flanks a little thrown\r\nback. The extreme battalions at each end were in square, to guard\r\nagainst possible attacks by cavalry, but the seven central units were\r\ndeployed _en bataille_ in three-deep line, a formation which had not\r\nbeen seen in the other episodes of the battle, and which made their\r\nfire much more effective than that of regiments fighting in ‘column of\r\ndivisions,’ as most of their comrades had done[577].\r\n\r\n  [577] All this from Lemonnier-Delafosse of Ferey’s division, pp.\r\n  158-9.\r\n\r\nAgainst the orderly front thus disposed Clinton came up with the 6th\r\nDivision, pursuing his victorious advance. He was flanked on the\r\nleft by the Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division, which had long ago\r\nrallied and come up to the front since its disaster of an hour back.\r\nOn Clinton’s right were the 5th and 3rd Divisions, but both were at\r\nthe moment re-forming, after their long struggle with Sarrut and the\r\nwrecks of the French left wing. Anson’s cavalry had at last got to the\r\nfront in this direction, and replaced D’Urban and Arentschildt--whose\r\nsquadrons were quite worn out--upon the extreme right of the allied\r\nline.\r\n\r\nClinton, it is said[578], refused to wait till the troops on his right\r\nwere re-formed, and hurried on the attack: it was growing dark, and\r\na few more minutes of delay would allow the French to make off under\r\ncover of the night. Therefore he advanced at once, and found himself\r\nengaged at once in a most desperate musketry contest, whose deadly\r\nresults recalled Albuera, so heavy were the losses on both sides. But\r\nhere the French had the advantage of being deployed, and not (as at\r\nAlbuera) wedged in deep columns. The first fire of the French line,\r\nas Clinton’s brigades closed in, was particularly murderous, and\r\nswept away whole sections of the attacking force. ‘The ground over\r\nwhich we had to pass,’ writes an officer in Hinde’s brigade[579],\r\n‘was a remarkably clear slope, like the glacis of a fortress, most\r\nfavourable for the defensive fire of the enemy, and disadvantageous\r\nfor the assailant. The craggy ridge, on which the French were drawn\r\nup, rose so abruptly that the rear ranks could fire over the heads of\r\nthe front. But we had approached within two hundred yards before the\r\nmusketry began: it was far the heaviest fire that I have ever seen, and\r\naccompanied by constant discharges of grape. An uninterrupted blaze was\r\nthus maintained, so that the crest of the hill seemed one long streak\r\nof flame. Our men came down to the charging position, and commenced\r\nfiring from that level, at the same time keeping touch to the right, so\r\nthat the gaps opened by the enemy’s fire were instantly filled up. At\r\nthe first volley about eighty men of our right wing fell to the rear in\r\none group. Our commanding officer rode up to know the cause, and found\r\nthat they were every one wounded!’ But heavy as was the loss of this\r\nregiment (137 out of 600 present), it was trifling compared to that of\r\nits neighbours to the right, in Hulse’s brigade, where the right and\r\ncentre regiments in the line, the 1/11th and 1/61st, lost respectively\r\n340 men out of 516 and 366 out of 546--a proportion to which only\r\nAlbuera could show a parallel. For many minutes--one observer calls it\r\nnearly an hour, but the stress of the struggle multiplied time--the two\r\nhostile lines continued blazing at each other in the growing dusk. ‘The\r\nglare of light caused by the artillery, the continued fire of musketry,\r\nand by the dry grass which had caught fire, gave the face of the hill\r\na terrific appearance: it was one sheet of flame, and Clinton’s men\r\nseemed to be attacking a burning mountain, whose crater was defended by\r\na barrier of shining steel[580].’ The French, so far as losses went,\r\nprobably suffered no more, or perhaps less, than their assailants: but\r\ntheir casualties were nevertheless appalling. And at last they gave\r\nway: ‘the cruel fire cost us many lives,’ writes an officer of the 31st\r\nLéger, ‘and at last, slowly, and after having given nearly an hour’s\r\nrespite to the remainder of the army, Ferey gave back, still protected\r\nby his flanking squares, to the very edge of the forest, where he\r\nhalted our half-destroyed division. Formed in line it still presented a\r\nrespectable front, and halted, despite of the English batteries, which\r\nenfiladed us with a thundering fire. Here Ferey met the form of death\r\nwhich the soldier prefers to all others, he was slain outright by a\r\nround-shot[581].’\r\n\r\n  [578] But not on the best authority: regimental diaries are not\r\n  always safe to follow on such points.\r\n\r\n  [579] Ross Lewin of the 32nd, ii. pp. 25-6.\r\n\r\n  [580] Grattan, p. 253.\r\n\r\n  [581] Lemonnier-Delafosse, p. 159. This note about Ferey’s being\r\n  slain outright does not agree with the usual statement that he\r\n  was mortally wounded, and died two days later, given by several\r\n  English diarists. But Lemonnier-Delafosse is first-hand authority.\r\n\r\nClinton’s English regiments were so disordered and reduced by the awful\r\nfire through which they had passed in their victorious march, that he\r\nput into front line for a final assault on the enemy his Portuguese\r\nbrigade, that of the Conde de Rezende, which was still intact, as\r\nit had hitherto been in reserve. Its five battalions deployed, and\r\nadvanced against the now much contracted line of Ferey’s division: they\r\nwere supported on the left by the Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division,\r\non the right by the 5th Division, which was now re-formed and well to\r\nthe front. Anson’s cavalry was also in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe dying effort of Ferey’s division was worthy of its previous hard\r\nfighting. ‘Formed right up against the trees,’ writes the French\r\nofficer, whom we have already quoted, ‘no longer with any artillery to\r\nhelp, we saw the enemy marching up against us in two lines, the first\r\nof which was composed of Portuguese. Our position was critical, but we\r\nwaited for the shock: the two lines moved up toward us; their order\r\nwas so regular that in the Portuguese regiment in front of us we could\r\nsee the company intervals, and note the officers behind keeping the\r\nmen in accurate line, by blows with the flat of their swords or their\r\ncanes. We fired first, the moment that they got within range: and the\r\nvolleys which we delivered from our two first ranks were so heavy and\r\nso continuous that, though they tried to give us back fire for fire,\r\nthe whole melted away. The second line was coming up behind--this\r\nwas English, we should have tried to receive it in the same way,\r\nstill holding our ground though under a flank fire of artillery, when\r\nsuddenly the left of our line ceased firing and fell back into the\r\nwood in complete disorder. The 70th Ligne had found itself turned by\r\ncavalry; it broke; the rout spread down the front to the 26th and 77th;\r\nonly our two battalions of the 31st Léger held firm, under the fire of\r\nthe enemy, which continued so long as we showed outside the edge of the\r\nforest. We only gave back as the day ended, retiring some 250 yards\r\nfrom our original position, and keeping our _voltigeur_ companies still\r\nin a skirmishing line in front[582].’\r\n\r\n  [582] Lemonnier-Delafosse, pp. 161-2.\r\n\r\nThis vigorous account of the last stand of the French reserve is not\r\nfar from being accurate. It is quite true that the Portuguese brigade\r\nof the 6th Division suffered terribly in its attack, and was completely\r\nchecked. It lost 487 men during the fifteen minutes in which it was\r\nengaged--the heaviest casualty list in any of the brigades of its\r\nnation, even heavier than that of Stubbs’s troops in the 4th Division.\r\nThe only point that requires to be added is that it was not so much a\r\npanic caused by a partial cavalry charge which broke the 70th Ligne,\r\nand finally dispersed Ferey’s regiments[583], as the pressure of the\r\n5th Division upon the whole of the left of their line, which collapsed\r\nalmost simultaneously. But they had done their work--before they\r\ndispersed, leaving only the 31st Léger to act as a most inadequate\r\nrearguard, they had detained the allies for a half-hour or more, and\r\nnight had set in. Wellington ordered the 6th Division to pursue, but\r\nit was so much cut up and fatigued that it only advanced a hundred\r\nyards into the forest, and then halted and settled down for the night.\r\nWhy the intact 7th Division was not rather used for the pursuit it is\r\nhard to understand. Still more so is the fact that no cavalry was sent\r\nforward in this direction: the woods, no doubt, looked uninviting and\r\ndangerous, but the enemy was in a state of absolute panic, and ready to\r\ndisperse at the least pressure. ‘But,’ says the most intelligent of the\r\nBritish diarists with the mounted arm, ‘the cavalry during the assault\r\non the last hill was ordered back to the point on the left where we\r\nassembled before the attack, leaving the infantry to pursue without\r\nus. Had this not been done (though it might not have been prudent to\r\npursue with both in the night), yet by their being at hand there was a\r\ngreater chance of accomplishing more. The order came from Sir Stapleton\r\nCotton himself. The infantry moved in pursuit by moonlight.... I have\r\nheard from an officer in the 6th Division that although they had been\r\nmarching all day, and were so tired, when ordered to halt for the\r\nnight, that they could not possibly have marched much farther, yet they\r\nsat up through the night, talking over the action, each recalling to\r\nhis comrade the events that happened[584].’\r\n\r\n  [583] Ferey’s four regiments probably lost somewhat over 1,100\r\n  men--the 31st Léger had 380 casualties, the 47th Ligne (with\r\n  18 officers killed and wounded) something like 500; the 70th\r\n  suffered least, it returned only 111 casualties; the 26th\r\n  slightly more, perhaps 150. The whole forms a moderate total,\r\n  considering the work done.\r\n\r\n  [584] Tomkinson (of Anson’s brigade), p. 187.\r\n\r\nSome part of the slackness of the pursuit is to be explained by an\r\nunfortunate misconception by which Wellington (through no fault of\r\nhis own) was obsessed that night. He was under the impression that\r\nthe Castle of Alba de Tormes was still held by the Spanish garrison\r\nwhich he had left there, and that the bridge and the neighbouring ford\r\nwere therefore unavailable for the retreat of the French, who (as he\r\nsupposed) must be retiring by the fords of Huerta and Villa Gonzalo,\r\nwhich they had used to reach the field. Unhappily--as has been already\r\nmentioned--Carlos de España had withdrawn the battalion at Alba\r\nwithout making any mention of the fact to his Commander-in-Chief[585].\r\nWellington therefore put more thought to urging the pursuit in the\r\ndirection of the East than of the South, and it was not till late in\r\nthe night, and when nothing but stragglers had been picked up on the\r\nHuerta road, that he discovered what had really occurred.\r\n\r\n  [585] Tomkinson in his diary (p. 188) has a curious story to the\r\n  effect that ‘the Spanish general, before the action, asked if he\r\n  should not take his troops out of Alba--after he had done it.\r\n  Lord Wellington replied, “Certainly not,” and the Don was afraid\r\n  to tell what he had done, Lord W. therefore acted, of course, as\r\n  if the place had been in our possession still.’\r\n\r\nIt remains to relate the unimportant happenings on this front during\r\nthe evening. At the moment when the French attack on Wellington’s\r\ncentre failed, about 7 o’clock or soon after, Clausel sent to Foy,\r\nwhose division still lay behind Calvarisa de Ariba, covering the way to\r\nthe Huerta fords, the order to retire. His instructions were to cover\r\nthe flank of the line of retreat of the broken army, and to take up\r\nsuccessive detaining positions on its right, on the eastern side of the\r\nbrook and ravine which lie between the two Arapiles and the village\r\nof Utrera. These orders Foy carried out skilfully and well. He fended\r\noff the Light Division, which had moved out in pursuit of him, with\r\na heavy rearguard of light troops, always giving way when pressed.\r\nHis concern was almost entirely with this British unit, for the 1st\r\nDivision had started too late to get near him. The Light Division and\r\nits battery kept him on the run, but never came up with his main body.\r\n‘Night alone saved my division, and the troops that I was covering,’\r\nwrote Foy, ‘without it I should probably have been crushed, and the\r\nenemy would have arrived at Alba de Tormes before the wrecks of our\r\nseven routed divisions got there. An hour after dark the English\r\ncavalry was still pushing charges home against my regiments, which I\r\nhad placed in alternate chequers of line and column. I had the luck to\r\nkeep the division in hand till the last, and to steer it in the right\r\ndirection, though many routed battalions kept pressing in upon my left,\r\nand threatened to carry disorder into my ranks. The pursuit ceased near\r\nSanta Maria de Utrera[586].’\r\n\r\n  [586] Foy, _Vie militaire_, pp. 176-7.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to make out what became of the heavy dragoons of\r\nBock during this long retrograde movement of Foy’s division: they\r\nwere certainly not the cavalry of which the French general speaks as\r\ncharging him during his retreat, for they returned no single man or\r\nhorse killed or wounded that day[587]. Perhaps, far away to the left,\r\nthey may have been driving in from position to position, the one\r\nregiment of Boyer’s dragoons which had been left to cover Foy’s extreme\r\nouter flank. More probably they may have been pushing their march\r\ntowards the fords of Huerta, in the vain hope of finding masses of\r\ndisbanded enemies on the way, and ultimately cutting them off from the\r\nriver. This hypothesis is borne out by the fact that the bivouac of the\r\nheavy German brigade was that night in front of Pelabravo, much to the\r\nnorth-east of the resting-places of the rest of the army, and in the\r\ngeneral direction of the fords[588].\r\n\r\n  [587] This cavalry _may_ have been the two detached squadrons\r\n  of the 14th Light Dragoons, which had not followed the rest of\r\n  Arentschildt’s brigade to the right.\r\n\r\n  [588] See Schwertfeger’s _History of the German Legion_, i. p.\r\n  378.\r\n\r\nThat the pursuit was misdirected was a most lamentable chance for\r\nWellington. If it had been urged in the right direction, the Army of\r\nPortugal would have been annihilated as a fighting-body, and would\r\nnever have been able to make head again in the autumn. For the forest\r\nof Alba de Tormes was full of nothing but a disorderly crowd, making\r\nthe best of its way towards the bridge, with no proper rearguard and\r\nno commander in charge of the retreat. Clausel, wounded in the foot,\r\nwas being looked after by the surgeons in Alba, and was barely able\r\nto mount his horse next day. The rout was complete: ‘a shapeless\r\nmass of soldiery was rolling down the road like a torrent--infantry,\r\ncavalry, artillery, wagons, carts, baggage-mules, the reserve park of\r\nthe artillery drawn by oxen, were all mixed up. The men, shouting,\r\nswearing, running, were out of all order, each one looking after\r\nhimself alone--a complete stampede. The panic was inexplicable to one\r\nwho, coming from the extreme rear, knew that there was no pursuit by\r\nthe enemy to justify the terror shown. I had to stand off far from the\r\nroad, for if I had got near it, I should have been swept off by the\r\ntorrent in spite of myself[589].’ So writes the officer, already twice\r\nquoted for the narrative of the end of the battle, whose regiment,\r\nstill hanging together in the most creditable fashion, brought up\r\nthe rear of the retreat. It is clear that any sort of a pursuit would\r\nhave produced such a general block at the bridge-head that a disaster\r\nlike that of Leipzig must have followed, and the whole of the rear of\r\nthe Army of Portugal, brought up against the river Tormes, must have\r\nsurrendered _en masse_.\r\n\r\n  [589] Lemonnier-Delafosse, p. 164.\r\n\r\nFrom eight o’clock at night till three in the morning the routed army\r\nwas streaming across the bridge and the ford. Once covered by the\r\nTormes some regiments regained a certain order, but many thousands of\r\nfugitives, pressing on ahead in unthinking panic, were scattered all\r\nover the country-side, and did not come back to their colours for many\r\ndays, or even weeks.\r\n\r\nThe actual loss of the Army of Portugal would appear to have been some\r\n14,000 to 15,000 men, not including the ‘missing,’ who afterwards\r\nturned up and came back to the ranks. Marmont in his dispatch had the\r\neffrontery to write that he lost only 6,000 men[590], and 9 guns: a\r\nstatement only equalled in mendacity by Soult’s assertion that Albuera\r\nhad cost him but 2,800 casualties[591]. No general list of losses by\r\nregiments was ever given to Napoleon, though he demanded it: but a\r\nreturn proposing to include the casualties not only of Salamanca but\r\nof the minor combats of Castrillo and Garcia Hernandez was drawn up,\r\ngiving a total of 12,435[592]. On the whole, however, it would be safe\r\nto allow for 14,000 men as the total loss, exclusive of stragglers.\r\nAmong officers of rank the Commander-in-Chief was wounded: Ferey\r\nand Thomières were killed: the latter died inside the English lines\r\nafter the battle. Clausel and Bonnet were both wounded, the former\r\nslightly, the latter severely, so that four of the eight divisional\r\ngenerals of infantry were hit. Of the brigadiers, Desgraviers (division\r\nThomières) was mortally and Menne (division Foy) severely wounded.\r\nThe trophies lost were 2 eagles (those of the 22nd and 101st), 6\r\nother colours[593], and 20 guns[594]. Of these last 12 represented\r\nthe divisional batteries of Thomières and Bonnet, which were taken\r\nwhole, and the other 8, as it would seem, pieces captured from the\r\nlong line of batteries on Maucune’s flank, which was rolled up when Le\r\nMarchant and Leith swept the plateau in their triumphant advance. Of\r\nthe eight French divisions those of Thomières and Bonnet would appear\r\nto have lost about 2,200 men apiece, Maucune nearly 2,000, Clausel,\r\nBrennier, and Ferey above 1,200 each, Sarrut perhaps 500: Foy’s very\r\nheavy losses nearly all fell on the next day. The cavalry, with 43\r\nofficers hit, must account for at least 500 more of the total[595], and\r\nthe artillery must have lost, along with their 20 guns, at least 300\r\nor 400 gunners[596]. Of prisoners (wounded and unwounded), there were\r\naccording to Wellington’s dispatch 137 officers[597] and nearly 7,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n  [590] Marmont to Berthier, Tudela, July 31, in his _Mémoires_,\r\n  iv. p. 448.\r\n\r\n  [591] See vol. iv. p. 295.\r\n\r\n  [592] viz. killed or prisoners--officers 162, men 3,867;\r\n  wounded--officers 232, men 7,529; _traînards_, 645 men; 12 guns\r\n  and 2 eagles missing. This return is in the Paris archives. It\r\n  is certainly incomplete: 60 officers were killed, 137 prisoners,\r\n  which makes 197 _tués ou pris_ instead of 162. And 20 guns were\r\n  lost.\r\n\r\n  [593] A regiment whose 1st battalion was elsewhere carried not\r\n  an eagle but a simple standard per battalion instead. Of such\r\n  regiments, wanting their senior battalion and therefore their\r\n  eagle, there were with Marmont three. Two, the 66th and 82nd,\r\n  were in Maucune’s division, one, the 26th, in Ferey’s. The\r\n  colours probably belonged to some of these, of which several were\r\n  much cut up, especially the 66th.\r\n\r\n  [594] The returns of the Army of Portugal show a deficiency of\r\n  20 guns between July 15 and August 1, of which 12 represent\r\n  the divisional batteries of Thomières and Bonnet, which have\r\n  completely disappeared. Wellington says, ‘official returns\r\n  account for only 11 guns taken, but it is believed that 20 have\r\n  fallen into our hands.’ This was correct.\r\n\r\n  [595] The deficiency in cavalry rank and file shown by the muster\r\n  rolls between July 15 and August 1 was 512.\r\n\r\n  [596] Perhaps more: for the Reserve Artillery and Park alone show\r\n  1,450 rank and file on July 15 and only 707 on August 1.\r\n\r\n  [597] Sixty-three officers arrived in England as the Salamanca\r\n  batch of prisoners; of these some were wounded, for their\r\n  names occur both in Martinien’s tables as _blessés_, and in\r\n  the Transport Office returns at the Record Office as prisoners\r\n  shipped off. The remainder of the 137 were badly wounded, and\r\n  came later, or died in hospital.\r\n\r\nWellington returned his loss in the British units as 3,129, in the\r\nPortuguese as 2,078: of España’s Spaniards 2 were killed and 4 wounded.\r\nThis makes up the total of 5,173, sent off immediately after the\r\nbattle. The separate Portuguese return forwarded by Beresford to Lisbon\r\ngives the loss of the troops of that nation as somewhat less--1,637\r\ninstead of 2,078: the difference of 441 is partly to be accounted\r\nfor by the reappearance of stragglers who were entered as ‘missing’\r\nin the first casualty-sheet, but cannot entirely explain itself in\r\nthat fashion. Which of the returns is the more accurate it is hard\r\nto be sure, but a prima facie preference would naturally be given to\r\nthe later and more carefully detailed document. Taking British and\r\nPortuguese together, it is clear that the 6th Division, which lost\r\n1,500 men, was far the hardest hit. The 3rd and 5th, which decided the\r\nday on the right, got off easily, with a little more than 500 each: the\r\n4th Division, owing to the mishap to the Fusilier brigade and Stubbs’s\r\nPortuguese, had very nearly 1,000 casualties. Pack’s five battalions\r\nlost 386 men in the one short episode of the battle in which they were\r\nengaged, the unsuccessful attack on the Great Arapile, and were lucky\r\nto fare no worse. The cavalry total of 173 killed and wounded was\r\nalso very moderate considering the good work that the brigades of Le\r\nMarchant, D’Urban, and Arentschildt performed. In the 1st, 7th, and\r\nLight Divisions, the trifling losses were all in the flank-companies\r\nsent out in skirmishing line: of the battalions none was engaged as\r\na whole[598]. The artillery were overmatched by the French guns all\r\nthrough the day, and it is surprising to find that they returned only\r\nfour men killed, and ten wounded. The casualty list of officers of high\r\nrank was disproportionately large--not only was Le Marchant killed, but\r\nMarshal Beresford, Stapleton Cotton, commanding the cavalry[599], and\r\nLeith and Cole, each a divisional general, were disabled. Of officers\r\nin the Portuguese service, Collins, commanding a brigade of the 7th\r\nDivision, was mortally hurt, and the Conde de Rezende, who led the\r\nPortuguese of the 6th Division, was wounded.\r\n\r\n  [598] The 7th Division would have had practically no loss but\r\n  for the skirmishing in the early morning near Nuestra Señora de\r\n  la Peña, and the heaviest item in the 1st Division casualties\r\n  was the 62 men of the Guards’ flank-companies who were hit while\r\n  defending the village of Arapiles.\r\n\r\n  [599] Cotton was shot after the battle was over by a caçador\r\n  sentry, whose challenge to halt he had disregarded while riding\r\n  back from the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Salamanca was certainly an astonishing feat of rapid\r\ndecision and instantaneous action. The epigrammatic description of it\r\nas ‘the beating of 40,000 men in forty minutes’ hardly over-states its\r\ntriumphant celerity: before that time had elapsed, from the moment when\r\nPakenham and Leith struck the French left, the battle was undoubtedly\r\nin such a condition that the enemy had no chance left--he could only\r\nsettle whether his retreat should be more or less prompt. Clausel chose\r\nto make a hopeless counter-offensive move, and so prolonged the fight\r\ntill dark--he would probably have been wiser to break off at once, and\r\nto retreat at six o’clock, covering his routed left with his intact\r\nreserve divisions. He would certainly have lost several thousand men\r\nless if he had retired after repulsing Cole and Pack, and had made no\r\nattempt to press the advantage that he had gained over them. It may be\r\nargued in his defence that the last hour of battle, costly though it\r\nproved to him, prevented Wellington’s pursuit from commencing in the\r\ndaylight, an undoubted boon to the defeated army. But at the most the\r\nvictor would have had only one hour at his disposition before dusk; the\r\nFrench were taking refuge in a forest, where orderly pursuit would have\r\nbeen difficult; and looking at Wellington’s usual methods of utilizing\r\na victory (e. g. Vittoria) we may feel doubtful whether the beaten\r\nenemy--if covered by Sarrut, Ferey, and Foy, as a regular rearguard,\r\nwould have suffered more than he actually did. For Wellington’s whole\r\nidea of pursuit turned on the false notion that the castle, bridge,\r\nand ford of Alba de Tormes were still blocked by the Spaniards whom he\r\nhad left there. By the time that he had discovered that the enemy was\r\nnot retreating towards Huerta and Villa Gonzalo, but escaping over the\r\nTormes in some other way, the hour would have been late.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best summary and encomium of Wellington’s tactics on\r\nthis eventful day is that of an honest enemy, the very capable and\r\nclear-sighted Foy, who wrote in his diary six days after the fight[600]:\r\n\r\n  [600] Diary in _Vie militaire_, ed. Girod de l’Ain, p. 178.\r\n\r\n‘The battle of Salamanca is the most masterly in its management,\r\nthe most considerable in the number of troops engaged, and the most\r\nimportant in results of all the victories that the English have gained\r\nin these latter days. It raises Lord Wellington almost to the level of\r\nMarlborough. Hitherto we had been aware of his prudence, his eye for\r\nchoosing a position, and his skill in utilizing it. At Salamanca he\r\nhas shown himself a great and able master of manœuvres. He kept his\r\ndispositions concealed for almost the whole day: he waited till we\r\nwere committed to our movement before he developed his own: he played\r\na safe game[601]: he fought in the oblique order--it was a battle in\r\nthe style of Frederic the Great. As for ourselves, we had no definite\r\nintention of bringing on a battle, so that we found ourselves let in\r\nfor it without any preliminary arrangements having been made. The\r\narmy was moving without much impulse or supervision, and what little\r\nthere was stopped with the wounding of the Marshal.’ In another note\r\nhe adds: ‘The Duke of Ragusa committed us to the action--he brought\r\nit on contrary to Clausel’s advice. The left was already checked when\r\nhe received his wound: after that moment it was impossible either to\r\nrefuse to fight, or to give the fight a good direction: all that could\r\nbe done was to attenuate the sum of the disaster--that Clausel did.\r\nThere was no gap in the command--we should have been no better off if\r\nthe Marshal had never been hurt. He is not quite honest on that point\r\nin his dispatch[602].’\r\n\r\n  [601] _Il a joué serré._ This idiom is explained in the\r\n  Dictionary of the Academy as ‘jouer sans rien hasarder.’\r\n\r\n  [602] Note in same volume, p. 177.\r\n\r\nWith this criticism we may undoubtedly agree. Foy has hit upon the\r\nmain points in which Salamanca was a startling revelation to the\r\ncontemporary observer--no one on the French side, and but few upon\r\nthe British, had yet realized that Wellington on the offensive could\r\nbe no less formidable and efficient than Wellington on the defensive.\r\nAfter July 22, 1812, no opponent could dare to take liberties with\r\nhim, as Soult, Masséna, and Marmont, each in his turn, had done up\r\ntill that date. The possible penalty was now seen to be too great.\r\nMoreover, the prestige of the British general was so much enhanced\r\nthat he could safely count upon it as not the least of his military\r\nassets--as we shall see him do in the Pyrenees, a little more than a\r\nyear after Salamanca had been won. To the other thesis that Foy lays\r\ndown--the statement that Marmont had, by his initial movement, made\r\ndisaster inevitable before he was wounded--we may also give our assent.\r\nJourdan came to the same conclusion--the Emperor Napoleon also fixed\r\nthe responsibility in the same way. The Marshal’s ingenious special\r\npleading, to the effect that but for his personal misadventure he\r\nwould yet have won the day, will convince none but blind enemies of\r\nWellington. Of some of the charges which Napoleon laid to his charge\r\nhe must be acquitted: he did not know in the least that King Joseph\r\nwas on his way to join him from Madrid with 15,000 men. The dispatches\r\nsent to warn him of this fact had all miscarried, and the last news\r\nfrom the Army of the Centre which had reached him had intimated that\r\nno immediate help was to be expected from that quarter. Nor was he\r\nwrong in not waiting for the succours from Caffarelli: these were so\r\ntrifling--800 sabres and one horse battery--that their presence or\r\nabsence could make little difference in the battle.\r\n\r\nBut the Marshal’s flagrant and irreparable fault was that, having made\r\nup his mind that Wellington would not fight under any provocation--a\r\nconclusion for which the earlier episodes of the campaign gave him some\r\njustification--he got his army into a position in which he had battle\r\nsuddenly forced upon him, at a moment when he was not in a position to\r\naccept it with advantage. The attempt to turn Wellington’s right wing\r\non the afternoon of July 22nd was an unpardonable liberty, only taken\r\nbecause the Marshal had come to despise his opponent. The liberty was\r\nresented in the most forcible way--and there was no means of avoiding\r\ndisaster when Thomières and Maucune had once started out on their rash\r\nturning movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF SALAMANCA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn of July 23rd revealed to Wellington that the French army had\r\npassed the Tormes at the bridge and forts of Alba, and that nothing\r\nremained on the western bank of the river save small parties of\r\nfugitives and wounded, who had lost their way in the forest. Some of\r\nthese were gleaned up by Anson’s and Bock’s brigades of cavalry, who\r\nwere pushed forward to search the woods and seek for the enemy. Anson’s\r\npatrols reached the bridge, and found a French rearguard watching it.\r\nThis was composed of Foy’s division, to whom Clausel had committed the\r\ncovering of his retreat. It cleared off, after firing a few shots. Foy\r\nhad been told to block the passage till 9 o’clock, but went off long\r\nbefore, when the disordered main body had got a good start. On the\r\nreport that he was gone, Wellington sent Anson’s squadrons across the\r\nbridge of Alba de Tormes, while Bock forded the river lower down at La\r\nEncina. The state of the roads, strewn with baggage and wounded men,\r\nshowed that the French had used all the three roads leading east from\r\nAlba[603], and were on their way to Arevalo, not towards their base at\r\nValladolid: to have marched in that direction would have brought them\r\nright across the front of the advancing British army. Wellington sent\r\nout detachments on all the roads which the enemy had taken, but urged\r\nthe main pursuit by the central and most important road, that by Garcia\r\nHernandez on Peñaranda. Contrary to his wont, he pushed on this day\r\nwith great celerity, riding himself with the head of the column formed\r\nby the main body of Anson’s light dragoons. This vanguard was followed,\r\nat some distance, by the 1st and Light Divisions. Those infantry units\r\nwhich had fought hard on the previous day were allowed a rest. About\r\nseven miles beyond Alba de Tormes Anson’s patrols came upon a regular\r\nrearguard of the enemy, behind the Caballero brook (a tributary of the\r\nAlmar), in and about the village of Garcia Hernandez. This was, of\r\ncourse, Foy and the French 1st Division, the only troops in Clausel’s\r\narmy which had not been seriously engaged in the battle. They were\r\naccompanied by a battery and a brigade of Curto’s _chasseurs_. Around\r\nand about the formed troops scattered parties were visible--the village\r\nwas full of men drawing water from the wells. On the approach of the\r\nBritish cavalry column--the infantry were still miles behind--Foy\r\nprepared to resume his retreat, the cavalry drew up on a rising ground,\r\nto the north of Garcia Hernandez, to cover the movement: the leading\r\nregiments of the foot started off at once along the high-road, the\r\nothers halted for a space, to the right of the _chasseurs_, out of\r\nsight of the British, whose view of them was intercepted by the slope\r\non which the French cavalry were drawn up.\r\n\r\n  [603] See Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 190. He gives the three roads\r\n  used as (1) Alba, Mancera de Abaxo, Junialcon; (2) Alba, Garcia\r\n  Hernandez, Peñaranda; (3) Encina, Zorita, Cebolla [names all badly\r\n  spelled]. It is doubtful whether the troops on the last road were\r\n  not disorderly masses of fugitives only. The bulk of the army\r\n  certainly went by Peñaranda.\r\n\r\nWellington, as it seems, saw only the hostile squadrons, and resolved\r\nto drive them off without delay, in order to be able to press in upon\r\nthe infantry columns which were retiring farther away. He directed\r\nAnson to attack the _chasseurs_ with so much of his brigade as was\r\nup at the front: several squadrons were absent, some guarding the\r\nprisoners of yesterday, others exploring on distant roads. Two\r\nsquadrons each of the 11th and 16th Light Dragoons delivered the\r\nfrontal attack on the French brigade, while the leading squadrons of\r\nBock’s brigade, which was coming up rapidly from the flank, and was not\r\nyet formed in line, were to turn its right wing.\r\n\r\nThe French light cavalry, which had been much mauled on the preceding\r\nday, and was evidently in no fighting mood, gave way precipitately\r\nbefore the attack of the Light Dragoons, and rode off in confusion to\r\ntheir own right rear. There was no time for Bock’s Germans to come up\r\nwith them: but the leading squadrons of the 1st Heavy Dragoons of the\r\nLegion, pushing on in pursuit, received, to their surprise, a heavy\r\nvolley in their flank from a French battalion in square, which they had\r\nnot noticed in their advance.\r\n\r\nThere were, in fact, two regiments of infantry to the right of the\r\nrouted _chasseurs_, and by the sudden flight of their comrades they\r\nfound themselves suddenly uncovered and engaged. They were the 6th\r\nLéger and 76th Line, each two battalions strong, and counting together\r\nabout 2,400 bayonets. Of these the unit nearest the cavalry was a\r\nbattalion of the 76th in square: it was the fire of this body which\r\nhad struck the leading German squadron in flank, and thrown it into\r\ndisorder as it was charging the routed French horse. Farther to the\r\neast were the other battalion of the 76th and the two of the 6th Léger,\r\non the slopes above the road, which here winds below the small eminence\r\nwhich the French cavalry had occupied and the hill of La Serna, a long\r\nand fairly steep height, which gives its name in many histories to the\r\ncombat that ensued.\r\n\r\nWhat followed on the unexpected discovery of the French infantry was\r\nthe effect not of Wellington’s direct orders, nor of the leading of\r\nthe short-sighted Bock, who had hardly realized the situation when his\r\nsubordinates were already making their decision. It was entirely the\r\nexploit of the gallant squadron-leaders of the two regiments of German\r\ndragoons. They were coming up in a sort of échelon of squadrons, the\r\nfirst regiment leading, so that when the fire of the French square\r\nstruck and disordered the leading unit, the responsibility for action\r\nfell on the officers commanding the others. Captain von der Decken\r\nwho led the 3rd squadron determined without hesitation to charge the\r\nFrench square--his men were already getting up speed, and the enemy\r\nwas but a short distance from him. Shouting to the squadron to throw\r\nforward its right wing and ride home, he led it straight at the French.\r\nThe first fire of the square, delivered at eighty yards, brought down\r\nseveral men and horses, and wounded (mortally as it proved in the end)\r\nvon der Decken himself. He kept his saddle, however, and only fell\r\nwhen the second fire was given, at twenty yards range. This volley\r\nwas destructive, but did not break the impetus of the squadron, which\r\ncharged right home. In most cases where cavalry reached the bayonets of\r\na square during the Peninsular War, it had proved unable to break in,\r\nand had recoiled with loss--like Craufurd’s squadrons at the combat\r\nof Barquilla[604], and Montbrun’s at Fuentes de Oñoro. Here, however,\r\nthe rare feat of riding down well-formed infantry was performed--it is\r\nsaid by several eye-witnesses that the breach was originally made by\r\na mortally-wounded horse, which reared right on top of the kneeling\r\nfront rank of the French, and then rolled over kicking, and bore down\r\nsix or eight men at once. Several dragoons leapt the bank of struggling\r\nand overthrown soldiers, and broke into the rear ranks--thereupon the\r\nwhole square fell to pieces in disorder. Many of the Frenchmen were\r\nhewn down, but the majority dropped their muskets and surrendered\r\nunhurt. The lists of prisoners at the Record Office give the names of\r\nsixteen officers of the 76th sent to England, of whom only two were\r\nwounded. Of the rank and file not more than fifty, it is said, got\r\naway[605]. Observers who came on the field later in the day noted with\r\ncuriosity the long lines of muskets laid down in orderly rows. This was\r\nan astonishing achievement for a single squadron of 120 men--they had\r\ncaptured or cut down five times their own numbers of veteran troops of\r\nNey’s old 6th Corps.\r\n\r\n  [604] See vol. iii. p. 255.\r\n\r\n  [605] I took the trouble to work out the names from the immense\r\n  list of prisoners at the Record Office, in order to test the\r\n  truth of the statement that the whole battalion was captured.\r\n  The following names appear from the 76th--Bailly, Cavie, Catrin,\r\n  Demarest, Denis, Duclos, Dupin, Dupont, Dusan, Gautier, Guimblot,\r\n  L’Huissier, Richard, Ravenal, besides two wounded officers,\r\n  Lambert and Martinot. In addition, one officer (Lebert) was\r\n  killed, and in Martinien’s _Liste des officiers tués et blessés_\r\n  we have five more down as wounded, Dessessard, Lanzavecchia,\r\n  Massibot, Norry, Rossignol. These may have died of their wounds,\r\n  and so never have reached England; or they may have escaped,\r\n  though wounded. The twenty-two names must represent practically\r\n  the whole of the officers of the battalion.\r\n\r\nSome way to the right of this unlucky battalion were two more, forming\r\nthe 6th Léger. Seeing the havoc made of his comrades, and noting the\r\nremaining squadrons of the Germans sweeping across the slope toward\r\nhim, the colonel of this regiment ordered his men to retreat uphill\r\nand climb the steep slope behind. He hoped to get upon ground where\r\ncavalry could not easily follow. The two battalions, still in column,\r\nfor they had not (like the 76th) formed square, moved hastily upwards:\r\nthe voices of officers were heard shouting, ‘_allongez le pas, gagnons\r\nla hauteur_[606].’ The nearest enemy to them was the second squadron\r\nof the 1st Dragoons K.G.L., led by Captain von Reizenstein, who put on\r\nthe pace when he saw the French scrambling higher, and came up with the\r\nrearmost battalion before it was very far from the road. The two rear\r\ncompanies faced about when the dragoons drew near, and delivered a fire\r\nthat was fairly effective, when it is considered that the men had been\r\ngoing as hard as they could trot, and were halted and put into action\r\nat a second’s notice. But it did not suffice to stop the dragoons,\r\nwho rode in, at the cost of many killed and wounded, and cut up the\r\ncompanies that had stood to meet them: many men were sabred, more taken\r\nprisoners. The rear of the column, however, scrambled uphill in a mass,\r\nand there joined the other battalion of the 6th Léger, which formed\r\nsquare on the sky-line. They had on their flank a squadron or so of\r\n_chasseurs_, apparently a fragment of the brigade that had given way so\r\neasily before Anson’s attack twenty minutes before.\r\n\r\n  [606] All this from Schwertfeger, i. p. 381.\r\n\r\nAgainst this mass charged the leading squadrons of the 2nd Heavy\r\nDragoons K.G.L., which had at last come up to the front, and some\r\nof the officers and men of the 1st, who had already done such good\r\nwork lower down the hill. The French square was not perfect or\r\nregular--apparently it was disordered by the fugitives from the broken\r\nbattalion, who ran in for shelter, and formed up as best they could.\r\nThe charge of the Germans was delivered with splendid impetus--though\r\nthe regiment had been galloping for 300 yards uphill--and was\r\ncompletely successful. The French _chasseurs_ rode off without\r\nengaging: the ill-formed square crumpled up: many of the men threw\r\ndown their arms and surrendered, the rest dispersed and ran in coveys\r\nalong the slopes of the plateau, towards the nearest friendly troops.\r\nThese were the four battalions of the 39th and 69th Line, the surviving\r\nregiments of the division. Foy himself was in one of the squares; his\r\nsurviving brigadier, Chemineau, in the other.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated with the glorious successes that they had gained, a\r\nlarge but disordered mass of the victorious dragoons rode after the\r\nfugitives, and charged the nearest of the French squares--one of the\r\n69th Line. The enemy held firm, their fire was given with effect, and\r\nkilled the officer who led this last effort (Captain von Uslar) and\r\nmany of his men. The rest swerved back, and rode away under a pelting\r\nfire from the battalion that they had attacked and from the other\r\nthree, which lay close on its flank.\r\n\r\nSo ended the charge of Garcia Hernandez, the most dashing and\r\nsuccessful attack made by any of Wellington’s cavalry during the\r\nwhole war, as Foy--the best of witnesses--formally states in his\r\nhistory[607]. Though not more destructive in its results than Le\r\nMarchant’s onslaught on Maucune at Salamanca, it was a far more\r\ndifficult affair. For Le Marchant had charged troops not in square,\r\nand already shaken by conflict with Leith’s division; while the\r\nGermans attacked without any infantry support, and fell upon intact\r\nbattalions, of which two at least had formed square. Moreover, the\r\nFrench were supported by artillery and cavalry, though the former\r\ncleared off promptly, and the latter allowed themselves to be routed\r\nvery easily by Anson’s squadrons. Altogether it was a glorious first\r\nexperience of war for the Heavy Dragoons--neither of the regiments\r\nhad ever charged before, and they had seen but a little skirmishing\r\nduring the six months since their arrival at Lisbon. They were duly\r\ngranted the battle-honour, ‘Garcia Hernandez,’ which they continued to\r\nbear on their guidons as long as Hanover was an independent state. Two\r\nHanoverian cavalry regiments of to-day in the Prussian army continue\r\nto show it, as theoretical heirs of the old Heavy Dragoons. The most\r\nastonishing feature of the exploit was that it was the sole work of\r\nthe squadron-leaders--Wellington had only given the general order to\r\nattack--Bock had been with the fraction of the 1st Dragoons which\r\ncharged along with Anson, and was not directing the marvellous uphill\r\nride. It was a regimental triumph, not an exhibition of cavalry tactics\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief or the brigadier[608].\r\n\r\n  [607] Foy, _Guerre de la Péninsule_, i. pp. 290-1.\r\n\r\n  [608] I have used for the narrative of this interesting fight\r\n  not only the numerous and valuable K.G.L. sources printed or\r\n  quoted by Beamish and Schwertfeger, but the letters of von\r\n  Hodenberg, aide-de-camp to Bock, lent me by his representative,\r\n  Major von Hodenberg, now resident in Hanover. For this officer’s\r\n  interesting career see _Blackwood_ for May 1912, where I\r\n  published large sections from these letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALAMANCA.\r\n\r\nPart of the field, showing approximate position at the moment of the\r\nadvance of the 6th Division about 7 p.m.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Combat of GARCIA HERNANDEZ (July 23 1812)]\r\n\r\nThe losses of the victors were very heavy--the 1st Regiment had 2\r\nofficers and 28 men killed, 2 other officers wounded (one--von der\r\nDecken--mortally), and 37 men. The 2nd Regiment lost 1 officer (von\r\nUslar) killed, with 21 men, and 1 officer and 29 men wounded. In\r\nthis total the striking figure is the high proportion of killed to\r\nwounded--52 to 69--which bears witness to the murderous power of the\r\nold musket-ball when delivered point-blank, into the bodies of men\r\nwho were pressing right up to the muzzles of the infantry in square.\r\nThere were six men missing to be added to the total of losses--127 in\r\nall--whether these were individuals who were taken prisoners in the\r\nlast attempt to break the square of the 69th, or whether they were\r\nmortally wounded men, whose horses carried them far from the scene of\r\naction and whose bodies were not found, it is impossible to say. The\r\nloss of 127 officers and men out of about 770 present was, however, by\r\nno means disproportionately heavy, when the results of the charge are\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nOf the two French regiments engaged, a whole battalion of the 76th was\r\ncaptured or destroyed--of the 27 officers with it one was killed, 5\r\nwounded, 16 taken prisoners: taking the same proportion of its rank\r\nand file, very few out of 650 can have escaped. The 6th Léger was less\r\ncompletely annihilated, but it had its colonel (Molard) and 6 other\r\nofficers taken prisoners[609], and 8 more wounded, with about 500\r\nrank and file taken or hurt. Allowing for some small losses to the\r\n_chasseurs_, the total casualties of the French must have been about\r\n1,100.\r\n\r\n  [609] Their names were the colonel, Molard (who died, a prisoner,\r\n  of his wounds, August 4), Baudart, Paulin, Piancet, Turpin,\r\n  Paris, Bouteille; they were verified in the prisoners-rolls at\r\n  the Record Office by me.\r\n\r\nWhen the last charge of the Heavy Dragoons was over, Foy led his\r\nsurviving battalions off, followed at a distance by Anson’s brigade,\r\nwhen it had re-formed. The Germans were too fatigued to do more: the\r\nleading British infantry, the Light Division, was only just coming in\r\nsight far to the rear. The pursuit, therefore, by the four British\r\nsquadrons had no further results--if they had chanced to have a horse\r\nbattery with them it might have been much more effective. Six miles\r\nfrom Garcia Hernandez, Foy was relieved to find, waiting for him by\r\nthe roadside, the long-expected cavalry brigade from the Army of the\r\nNorth--Chauvel’s 1st Hussars and 31st Chasseurs: these fresh squadrons\r\ntook up the rearguard duty for the rest of the day, and covered the\r\nmarch of the infantry to Peñaranda.\r\n\r\nFrom this day onward Wellington’s pursuit cannot be said to have been\r\nurged with any great vigour. On the morning of the 24th the vanguard\r\nentered Peñaranda, to find that the French had started off before\r\ndawn. G. Anson’s brigade followed, accompanied this time by Bull’s\r\nand Ross’s horse artillery, which had come up from the rear. The tail\r\nof the enemy’s column was found at Aldea Seca, a few miles beyond\r\nPeñaranda: he started off without firing a shot, and was out of sight\r\nbefore more than two guns had been brought to shell him. It seems that\r\nopportunities were lost this day--an intelligent observer remarks that\r\n‘if only the whole brigade and twelve guns had come up, we might have\r\ntaken 500 of them--great part of the infantry were without arms[610].’\r\n\r\n  [610] Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 191.\r\n\r\nThat night the British head-quarters and vanguard were at Flores de\r\nAvila, but the enemy were quite out of sight. ‘How they get on their\r\ntroops at such a rate I cannot conceive,’ wrote Wellington, ‘but they\r\nleft this about two in the morning, and they will arrive in Valladolid\r\nto-morrow[611].’ He gave up all attempt at close or rapid pursuit\r\non the 25th, reporting to Lord Bathurst, ‘I find the troops so much\r\nfatigued by the battle and their previous and subsequent marches, and\r\nthe enemy have got so far before our infantry, that I halted this\r\nday, and have sent on only the light cavalry and guerrillas.’ After\r\nthis there was no prospect of doing any further harm to Clausel, or\r\nof scattering his demoralized army before it had time to recover its\r\ncohesion. ‘This does not look like the quick advance following up a\r\ngreat victory,’ wrote a critical dragoon[612], ‘and I think they will\r\nbe let off too easily. The peasants report them as in a dreadful state:\r\nall their cavalry, except a few for their rearguard, is employed in\r\ncarrying their sick.’ It may be taken for certain that a general of the\r\nNapoleonic school would have urged on his cavalry at all costs--there\r\nwas plenty of it, and none save Le Marchant’s and Bock’s brigades had\r\nsuffered any serious loss. Nor can it be doubted that such a hunt would\r\nhave been richly rewarded by captures. Clausel wrote on the 25th that\r\nhe could only rally 22,000 men[613]; and as some 48,000 had fought at\r\nSalamanca, and the actual losses seem to have been about 14,000, it is\r\nclear that he must be allowing for over 12,000 stragglers and unarmed\r\nfugitives--whom an active pursuit might have swept up.\r\n\r\n  [611] Wellington to Lord Bathurst, night of July 24.\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 309.\r\n\r\n  [612] Tomkinson, p. 191.\r\n\r\n  [613] Clausel to King Joseph from Arevalo. Joseph’s\r\n  _Correspondence_, ix. p. 54.\r\n\r\nWellington’s defence for the slowness of his movement would undoubtedly\r\nhave been that a headlong chase might have cost him over-much--he\r\nwould have lost too many men, and--what was even more important--too\r\nmany horses by forcing the pace. Clausel’s army had been put out of\r\naction for some weeks by the battle of Salamanca--to smash it up\r\nstill further would give him no such profit as would justify the\r\nexpenditure of several thousands of his precious British troops. He\r\nwas looking forward to the possibility of having to fight Soult and\r\nSuchet--not to speak of King Joseph--and wished to be as strong as\r\npossible for the present. It is probable that he made a mistake in\r\nholding back--Clausel, being left practically unmolested, was able\r\nto rally his army somewhat sooner than his adversary calculated. By\r\nAugust it was again able to give trouble: in October its strength was\r\nsufficient to wreck the Burgos campaign. If it had been well hunted\r\nin the last days of July, it would seem that no such reorganization\r\nwould have been possible--only negligible fragments of it should have\r\nreached Valladolid or Burgos. Yet it must always be remembered that\r\neconomy of men was the cardinal necessity for Wellington--his total\r\nBritish force was so small, the difficulty of getting up drafts and\r\nreinforcements was so enormous, the total number of the enemy’s armies\r\nin the Peninsula was so overpowering, that he could not afford to\r\nthin down his regiments by the exhausting forced marches that were\r\nnecessary in an active pursuit. It would have been little profit to\r\nhim if he had exterminated the Army of Portugal, only to find himself\r\nleft victorious, indeed, but with a force so weak and so tired out that\r\nfurther exertion was impossible. As it was, many of his battalions in\r\nAugust showed only 300 bayonets in line[614], and only recovered their\r\nstrength, by the reappearance of Badajoz and Salamanca convalescents,\r\nand the arrival of drafts, during the following winter.\r\n\r\n  [614] Already on the day of Salamanca there were eight battalions\r\n  in the army with less than 400 men present. See the tables in\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\nIt was at Flores de Avila on July 25th that Wellington received the\r\nnews that a new factor had come into the game. King Joseph had left\r\nMadrid four days earlier with the Army of the Centre, and was marching\r\nnorthward by the Guadarrama Pass and Villa Castin, with the obvious\r\nintention of joining Marmont. This move would have been all-important\r\nif it had taken place ten days earlier: but when the Army of Portugal\r\nwas in absolute rout, and flying by forced marches towards the Douro,\r\nthe appearance of the King was too late to be dangerous. He could not\r\nstrengthen the beaten army sufficiently to enable it to fight--and he\r\nwould expose himself to some peril if he continued his forward march,\r\nand came any nearer to the British line of advance.\r\n\r\nJoseph’s long hesitation and tardy start require a word of explanation.\r\nIt will be remembered[615] that his last communication which had\r\ngot through to Marmont was a dispatch dated June 30, in which he\r\nhad expressed his surprise that the Army of Portugal was refusing\r\nbattle, and stated that he could offer no immediate help. If Hill,\r\nfrom Estremadura, should march to join Wellington, he had directed\r\nthat D’Erlon should move up in a similar fashion northward, and he\r\nhimself would come also, with all or part of the Army of the Centre.\r\nBut supposing that Hill should remain in the far south, beyond the\r\nGuadiana, Joseph gave no promise of coming to Marmont’s aid. Indeed\r\nhe never mentioned this contingency at all, except to say that if\r\nWellington had not been joined by his lieutenant, ‘you should choose a\r\ngood position and give battle with all your troops united.’\r\n\r\n  [615] See chapter v above, pp. 394-5.\r\n\r\nSince writing this epistle Joseph had experienced many searchings\r\nof heart. On the very day on which it was sent off he had received\r\na dispatch from Soult, which filled him with dismay: the Duke of\r\nDalmatia said that he had forbidden D’Erlon to cross to the north\r\nbank of the Tagus, even if it were certain that Hill and his corps\r\nhad gone to join Wellington. Writing in high wrath, the King, on July\r\n2nd, threatened to remove Soult from his command in Andalusia. ‘If you\r\nhave formally forbidden D’Erlon to pass the Tagus, in case the English\r\nforce in Estremadura goes off to join the enemy’s main body, you have\r\ngiven him orders contradictory to those which I sent both to him and\r\nto you. You set your authority above mine, you refuse to recognize me\r\nas Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of Spain. Consequently, placed as\r\nI may be between the two alternatives--of either depriving myself of\r\nthe service of your talent and military experience, or of allowing the\r\npowers confided to me by the Emperor to be broken in my hand almost as\r\nsoon as given--I can have no hesitation.... Painful as it is to me,\r\ntherefore, I accept the offer which you formerly made me, to resign\r\nyour command if I do not revoke my original order; for not only do I\r\nrefuse to revoke it, but I hereby repeat it again both to you and to\r\nComte d’Erlon. If you prefer to take this extreme step of disobedience,\r\nresign your command to D’Erlon, as your senior general of division, and\r\nhe will take it up till the Emperor shall nominate your successor[616].’\r\n\r\n  [616] Joseph to Soult, Madrid, June 30. _Correspondence_ of\r\n  Joseph, ix. p. 42.\r\n\r\nThis angry dispatch was followed by another, written on July 6th, which\r\nvaried the original order to Soult in an important feature. For instead\r\nof speaking of a northern movement of D’Erlon’s troops as consequent on\r\na similar transference of Hill’s corps to Castile, it makes no mention\r\nof Hill, but prescribes a definite manœuvre without any reference to\r\nthe action of that British general. ‘Send at once to Toledo a force of\r\n10,000 men: 8,000 infantry, 2,000 horse, with the men and horses for 12\r\nguns. By leaving the guns behind, the march of the corps will be made\r\nmore rapid, and the roads are good.... I authorize you to evacuate any\r\npart of the occupied territory that you may choose, in order to hasten\r\nthe departure of these 10,000 men, whose arrival I await with great\r\nimpatience[617].’\r\n\r\n  [617] _Correspondence_ of Joseph, ix. pp. 44-5.\r\n\r\nClearly it would take many days for these orders to get to Soult, who\r\nwas at this time before Cadiz. As a matter of fact they only reached\r\nhis hands on July 16th, and long before that date Joseph was becoming\r\nvery anxious at the state of affairs on the Douro. He got news that\r\nCaffarelli, scared by Home Popham’s diversion, had sent no succours\r\nto Marmont, and he received letters from Suchet, which showed him\r\nthat he could not count on any reinforcement from Valencia[618]. It\r\nwas certain that, even if Soult yielded to the peremptory orders sent\r\non July 2 and July 6, the detachment under D’Erlon could not reach\r\nToledo till somewhere about the 1st August. That it would start at all\r\nseemed doubtful, in face of a letter of July 3 from D’Erlon, stating\r\nthat he was being ‘contained’ by no less than 30,000 men under Hill--a\r\nscandalous perversion of fact, for Hill had not over two-thirds of that\r\nforce[619].\r\n\r\n  [618] Joseph to Clarke, July 13, _Correspondence_, ix. p. 45.\r\n\r\n  [619] For d’Erlon’s letter see Joseph to Clarke of July 17th;\r\n  _Correspondence_, ix. p. 48.\r\n\r\nThe days were running on, Marmont was still unsuccoured: it seemed\r\nlikely that neither from the North, from Valencia, nor from Andalusia,\r\nwould any help come to hand. The King grew more and more anxious--all\r\nthe more so because he had ceased to receive reports from Marmont,\r\nsince the line of communication with him had been cut by the\r\nguerrilleros. Finally, on July 9th[620], he made up his mind that,\r\nsince no other help could be got for the Army of Portugal, he would\r\nmarch himself with the Army of the Centre, even though to concentrate\r\nit he must evacuate all New Castile and La Mancha, and even imperil the\r\nsafety of Madrid. On that day he issued orders to Treillard to evacuate\r\nthe valley of the Tagus--all the Talavera and Almaraz region--and to\r\nthe Rheinbund Germans to abandon La Mancha. All the small posts in\r\nthe direction of the eastern mountains were also drawn in, even those\r\nwatching the passes of the Somosierra and the Guadarrama. Only in\r\nToledo, Guadalajara, and Segovia, were small garrisons left behind. By\r\nthe morning of the 19th July[621] the most distant detachments had all\r\ncome in, and the Army of the Centre was concentrated at Madrid, about\r\n14,000 strong, and able to spare 10,000 for the field when the capital\r\nhad been garrisoned. But the King resolved to wait two days longer\r\nbefore marching, because he had just received news of the approach\r\nof an unexpected but most welcome reinforcement. Early in the month\r\nhe had heard that Palombini’s Italian division of the Army of Aragon\r\nwas hunting the Empecinado and Mina in the direction of Calatayud and\r\nTudela. He had sent out a Spanish emissary with a letter to Palombini,\r\nbidding him to draw in towards Madrid, if he had not already marched\r\nto join Marmont, who had hoped to get his assistance. It does not seem\r\nthat the King had built much upon the results of this letter: orders\r\nsent to Suchet’s troops had generally been disregarded. But it chanced\r\nto reach the Italian general at Alfaro on the Ebro on July 12th, and\r\nPalombini, having no opportunity of referring the responsibility to his\r\nimmediate commander, who was 200 miles away at Valencia, resolved to\r\nobey. He marched for Soria and Siguenza, brushing off guerrillero bands\r\nthat strove to molest him, and sent to Joseph the news that he might be\r\nexpected at Madrid on the 21st. These tidings came to hand on the 18th,\r\nand filled the King with such high satisfaction that he resolved to\r\nwait for the Italian division. It arrived on the appointed day, having\r\nmade a most creditable forced march of 150 miles by mountain roads,\r\nthrough a burnt-up and desolate country. Without leaving it even one\r\nnight’s rest at Madrid, the King started it off in company with his own\r\ntroops, which had been awaiting all day the signal for departure[622].\r\n\r\n  [620] This date is fixed by a letter of Joseph to Marmont, of\r\n  that day, in the Scovell ciphers. It never got to Marmont.\r\n\r\n  [621] Jourdan in his _Mémoires_ (p. 419) says that the\r\n  concentration took place on the 17th, but Joseph’s letter to\r\n  Clarke of July 18 says that Treillard’s dragoons would only reach\r\n  Naval Carnero on the 19th, which is conclusive.\r\n\r\n  [622] All this from Vacani, vi. p. 110, where the movements of\r\n  Palombini are very carefully detailed.\r\n\r\nJoseph’s expeditionary force, thus increased to 14,000 men, consisted\r\nof his Guards, horse and foot, one French brigade (28th and 75th\r\nLigne), D’Armagnac’s Germans (five battalions and one cavalry\r\nregiment), Treillard’s strong division of dragoons, and part of\r\nHugo’s division of Spanish _Juramentados_, together with Palombini’s\r\ndetachment, which amounted to six battalions and a regiment of\r\ndragoons. The garrisons of Madrid, Toledo, Segovia, and Guadalajara\r\nwere made up partly of _Juramentados_, and partly of the large body\r\nof drafts for the Army of Andalusia, which had accumulated at Madrid\r\nsince the posts in the Sierra Morena had been given up in April. The\r\nKing had been in no hurry to send them on to Soult, and now found them\r\nvery useful. The command of the garrison was left to General Lafon\r\nBlaniac, who was acting as governor of Madrid and Captain-General of\r\nNew Castile. A few days after Joseph’s departure a welcome addition\r\nturned up, in the shape of Suchet’s garrison of Cuenca, under General\r\nMaupoint, consisting of two battalions of the 16th regiment and a\r\nsquadron of _chasseurs_. On getting the King’s order to evacuate\r\nCuenca, this officer (like Palombini) had obeyed it, and, instead of\r\nretiring on Valencia, had come on to Madrid, with his 1,000 men and\r\nthree millions of reals, representing the provincial treasury[623].\r\n\r\n  [623] Maupoint’s letter to the King, announcing his arrival at\r\n  Madrid on the 29th-30th July, was captured by guerrilleros, and\r\n  is in the Scovell collection of ciphers.\r\n\r\nHaving once collected his army, the King marched with great speed,\r\npassed the defiles of the Guadarrama on the 22nd, and reached Espinar,\r\nthe great junction of roads in the province of Avila, next day. The\r\ncavalry that night were at Villa Castin, eight miles farther to the\r\nfront, on the road to Arevalo and Valladolid. Here the news came to\r\nhand, not from any authorized source but from the rumours of the\r\ncountry-side, that Marmont had crossed the Douro on the 17th, and\r\nwas closely engaged with Wellington somewhere in the direction of\r\nSalamanca. On receiving this information Joseph and Jourdan resolved\r\nnot to continue their march towards Valladolid, but to swerve westward,\r\nwith the intention of joining the Duke of Ragusa on the Tormes. Turning\r\noff from the main road, the cavalry reached Villanueva de Gomez on the\r\nnight of the 24th; the King and the infantry got to Blasco Sancho.\r\nOrders were issued for the whole army to march on Peñaranda next\r\nmorning. But during the hours of darkness rumours of the battle of\r\nSalamanca and its results came to hand, and on the following morning\r\nthey were confirmed by the arrival of two Spanish emissaries, one\r\nbearing a letter from the wounded Marmont, the other a second from\r\nClausel. The Marshal’s letter was insincere and inconclusive--after\r\ngiving a long account of the battle, which threw all the blame on\r\nMaucune, he said that he had lost 5,000 men, the enemy infinitely\r\nmore (!), and that the army was falling back to take a position behind\r\nthe Eresma river[624], or perhaps behind the Douro. Clausel’s epistle\r\nwas a far more honest document; it said that he was in a state of\r\nincapacity to resist Wellington, that he could not put even 20,000 men\r\nin line for some days, that he must retreat as fast as possible on\r\nValladolid, to pick up his dépôts and magazines, which he must send\r\noff without delay, and that he would then fall back on the Army of the\r\nNorth. He distinctly told the King that, even if the Army of the Centre\r\njoined him, they would be unable to resist Wellington for a moment.\r\nHe recommended Joseph to call up succours from Soult and Suchet: if\r\nWellington and the English main body marched on Madrid the Army of\r\nPortugal would remain on the Douro, but only in that case. If pursued\r\nby Wellington he must retire towards Burgos. He evidently regarded\r\nany junction between his troops and the King’s as impracticable and\r\nuseless[625].\r\n\r\n  [624] Which falls into the Adaja near Olmedo, twenty miles south\r\n  of Valladolid.\r\n\r\n  [625] Clausel to Joseph, _Correspondance_, ix. pp. 54-5.\r\n\r\nConfronted by this new and unpromising situation, Joseph and Jourdan\r\nhad to choose between two policies--they might retire towards Madrid\r\nand cover the capital, in the hope that Soult might conceivably\r\nhave carried out the orders given him on July 6th, and have sent\r\na detachment toward Toledo and Madrid. Or they might, despite of\r\nClausel’s advice and warning, move northward towards the Douro and try\r\nto get into communication with the Army of Portugal. If the direct road\r\nby Arevalo to Valladolid was too dangerous, there remained another and\r\nmore circuitous route by Cuellar, which Wellington was too far off to\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nThe King and Jourdan chose the first alternative without a moment’s\r\nhesitation[626]: if they joined the Army of Portugal, they had\r\nClausel’s assurance that they could effect nothing. They would be\r\ndriven back on Burgos; Madrid would be exposed to a raid by any small\r\ndetachment that Wellington might send against it, and touch with Soult\r\nand Suchet would be lost. The King, therefore, marched back by the\r\nway that he had come, and had reached on the 26th the Venta de San\r\nRafael, at the foot of the Guadarrama pass. He had got so rapidly out\r\nof Wellington’s way that their armies did not touch--save indeed that\r\na patrol of Arentschildt’s brigade surprised and captured near Arevalo\r\n2 officers and 25 men of the King’s light cavalry[627]--Juramentado\r\n_chasseurs_.\r\n\r\n  [626] ‘Certainement, c’était le meilleur,’ says Jourdan,\r\n  commenting on the choice years after.\r\n\r\n  [627] For this business see Hamilton’s _History of the 14th Light\r\n  Dragoons_, p. 109. The leader of the patrol, a Corporal Hanley of\r\n  that regiment, had only eight men, but surprised the _chasseurs_\r\n  in an inn, and bluffed them into surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen informed that the Army of the Centre had fallen back in haste\r\ntoward Madrid, Wellington resolved that his duty was to continue\r\npushing Clausel northward, and away from the King. The latter might be\r\ndisregarded; his strength was known, and it was almost certain that he\r\nwould not be reinforced. For Hill had just sent in a report, which had\r\ncome through in four days, that Drouet was showing no signs of moving\r\ntoward Toledo; and he enclosed an intercepted dispatch of Soult’s,\r\nwhich proved that the latter had no intention whatever of carrying\r\nout the King’s oft-repeated orders[628]. Accordingly the British\r\nhead-quarters were moved on to Arevalo on the 27th of July, and to\r\nOlmedo on the 28th. Anson’s and Arentschildt’s light cavalry went on in\r\nfront: they reported that the enemy was still in a complete state of\r\ndisorganization. He was burning the villages as he went, and leaving\r\nmany stragglers dead in the cornfields beside the road, for the wounded\r\nwere sinking by the way, and any marauders who went far from the main\r\ncolumn were being killed by the peasantry and the guerrilleros[629].\r\n\r\n  [628] See Wellington to Hill of July 26. _Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n  314. The Soult letter is in the Scovell collection of ciphers.\r\n\r\n  [629] For details, see Tomkinson, p. 192.\r\n\r\nClausel crossed the Douro by the two bridges of Tudela and Puente de\r\nDouro on the 27th-28th, leaving only some light troops to the south\r\nof the river, and entered Valladolid, where he set to work at once to\r\nevacuate all the more valuable stores, and so many of the sick and\r\nwounded as could find transport, along the high-road to Palencia and\r\nBurgos. The Anglo-Portuguese infantry was already approaching Medina\r\ndel Campo and Olmedo, while Santocildes, with the section of the\r\nArmy of Galicia which was not employed on the siege of Astorga, was\r\nordered to march past Toro and Tordesillas to threaten Valladolid from\r\nthe north bank of the Douro, and Silveira was directed to resume the\r\nblockade of Zamora with his militia-division.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th the Light and 1st Divisions, Wellington’s infantry\r\nvanguard, drove in the screen of light troops which Clausel had left\r\nin front of the Douro: the French retired and blew up the bridges. But\r\nthis was of little avail, for the British cavalry forded the river at\r\nBoecillo and continued their advance. Thereupon the enemy evacuated\r\nthe city of Valladolid, and withdrew along the direct road to Burgos,\r\nsave one division (Foy’s), which retreated excentrically, up the north\r\nbank of the river toward Aranda. In Valladolid were found 17 guns,\r\n800 sick and wounded, whose condition had rendered it impossible for\r\nthem to travel, and a large magazine filled with artillery material,\r\nbesides other stores. The people received Wellington with every\r\nmark of enthusiasm, though they had the reputation of including a\r\ngreater proportion of _Afrancesados_ than any other city of northern\r\nSpain[630]. They treated him to illuminations, a ball, and copious\r\nharangues of congratulation. Meanwhile Anson’s brigade swept the\r\ncountry to the east and north, and reported no enemy visible; while the\r\nguerrillero Marquinez entered Palencia, and captured 300 stragglers\r\nfrom Clausel’s rearguard. The French had gone back beyond the Arlanza\r\nriver, and were lying at Lerma, Torquemada, and Santa Maria del Campo,\r\nready to retreat to Burgos itself if any further pressure was applied.\r\nIt was not forthcoming--much to Clausel’s surprise--and he halted and\r\nbegan to reorganize his shattered army. What survived of his train\r\nand stores, his sick, and the _cadres_ of several skeleton battalions\r\nwere sent back to Burgos. The rest stood still, awaiting further\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n  [630] See von Hodenberg’s letter concerning this in _Blackwood_\r\n  for June 1912.\r\n\r\nWellington, meanwhile, had brought none of his infantry north of the\r\nDouro, though all were now near at hand, and the Light Division had\r\nrepaired the bridge of Tudela. He had resolved to turn his attention to\r\nKing Joseph and Madrid. Only Santocildes and his two Galician divisions\r\nwere ordered up to Valladolid (where they arrived on August 6th) to\r\nsupport Anson’s cavalry, who took up cantonments at various villages\r\nin front and to the flank of the city.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the King and his army on July 27th-31st had been\r\nsomewhat puzzling to the British general. On arriving at the foot of\r\nthe Guadarrama pass, they had halted, and then (instead of pursuing\r\nthe straight road to Madrid) had swerved off to Segovia, which lies on\r\nthe northern slope of the mountains, as if they had abandoned their\r\noriginal intention of leaving the Army of Portugal to its own devices.\r\nThis flank march was the result of the receipt of letters borne by\r\nMarmont’s aide-de-camp, Fabvier, which said that Clausel was no longer\r\nbeing pursued with energy, and that it was possible that he might stop\r\non the Adaja and cover Valladolid[631]. It was a momentary inspiration,\r\nwith no reality behind it, for Clausel was in full retreat again before\r\nthe King reached Segovia. But misled by its fallacious cheerfulness,\r\nJoseph had made a move which rendered it possible for him to join the\r\nArmy of Portugal, if it had really halted. He was soon undeceived, and\r\nafter remaining three days at Segovia in some peril, for Wellington had\r\nnow turned against him, he evacuated that high-lying city on August\r\n1st, and made his final retreat on Madrid by the Guadarrama pass.\r\n\r\n  [631] Printed in Joseph’s _Correspondence_, ix. pp. 46-7.\r\n\r\nJust after he had left Segovia[632] King Joseph received a dispatch\r\nfrom Soult, dated July 16. It was a reply to the peremptory orders sent\r\nhim on July 6th, which had directed him to evacuate part of Andalusia\r\nand to send a large detachment to Toledo. This was a strange document,\r\nwhich amounted to an absolute refusal to obey instructions. After\r\nstating (quite falsely) that Hill was advancing with 30,000 men in\r\nEstremadura, and that in consequence he was himself about to repair\r\nthither, he announced that the evacuation of Andalusia would be ruinous\r\nto the French cause in Spain. ‘We could not find means to subsist\r\neither on the Tagus or in Estremadura, and from one position to another\r\nwe should retreat as far as the Ebro. There is a way to avoid this;\r\nby taking the initiative we can save 6,000 sick and maimed men whom\r\nI should probably have to abandon, as well as 200,000 Spaniards (who\r\nhave declared for your Majesty, and will be lost without hope), also\r\n2,000 guns, and the only artillery arsenal now existing in Spain. A\r\nsingle order by your Majesty can effect this, and shorten the Spanish\r\nwar by six campaigns. Let your Majesty come to Andalusia in person,\r\nwith every man that can be collected: if the number is large we can\r\nincrease the expeditionary force in Estremadura to 25,000 or 30,000\r\nmen, and transfer the seat of war to the left bank of the Tagus. The\r\nArmy of Portugal, being relieved of pressure, will be able to come into\r\nline again. Whatever occurs, your Majesty will find yourself at the\r\nhead of a splendid army, ready to deliver battle. If the worst came,\r\nand we were unlucky, there is always the resource of retiring on the\r\nArmy of Aragon [in Valencia] and so keeping the field.... I have the\r\nhonour to repeat to your Majesty that I cannot send any detachments\r\nbeyond the Sierra Morena or the Guadiana, save by evacuating all\r\nAndalusia and marching with my whole army. I must have a positive order\r\nfrom your Majesty to that effect[633].’\r\n\r\n  [632] On the next day, August 2, the letter came to hand at\r\n  Galapagar.\r\n\r\n  [633] Soult to Joseph, _Correspondance_, ix. pp. 45-7.\r\n\r\nThis was an astonishing letter for a Commander-in-Chief to receive\r\nfrom a subordinate. Instead of obeying a very definite order to move\r\na certain number of troops to a certain point, Soult replies by\r\nsending to the King an alternative plan of campaign. And this plan,\r\nit is not too much to say, was an absolutely perverse and insane one.\r\nIt must be remembered that, when Soult was writing, the battle of\r\nSalamanca was still six days in the future, and the Army of Portugal\r\nwas known to be at close quarters with Wellington and in urgent need\r\nof reinforcements. Soult urges his master to abandon Marmont to the\r\nenemy, to evacuate Madrid, to give up his communication with France,\r\nand to retire into Andalusia, where he would be cut off from all the\r\nother imperial armies, for it was not possible even to communicate with\r\nSuchet and Valencia, since the Spanish Army of Murcia blocked the way.\r\nThe cardinal sin of this project was that if the French were to hold\r\nSpain at all, it was necessary for them to be strong in the North:\r\nSoult proposed to deliver over the North to Wellington, by leaving\r\nMarmont in the lurch. As Napoleon had observed, five months earlier,\r\n‘a check to the Army of Portugal would be a calamity which would make\r\nitself felt all over Spain. A check to the Army of the South might\r\nforce it back on Madrid or Valencia, but would be of a very different\r\ndegree of importance[634].’ He had said much the same thing four\r\nyears before, when first his armies were invading Spain; for he then\r\nexpressed the opinion that a disaster to Bessières in Castile would\r\nbe the one ruinous possibility: defeats in the South or East mattered\r\ncomparatively little. Soult, blinded by his own interest in the\r\nviceroyalty of Andalusia, refused to see this obvious fact. Long after\r\nhe had received the news of Salamanca, he persisted in maintaining that\r\nthe true policy was to hold on to Seville, even when the British army\r\nwas at Madrid, and the wrecks of Marmont’s forces were retiring on\r\nBurgos. Of this we shall hear more presently.\r\n\r\n  [634] Berthier to Marmont--writing from the Emperor’s personal\r\n  direction--of February 18th, 1812, printed in Marmont’s\r\n  _Correspondence_, iv. p. 332.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph on receiving Soult’s letter returned answer: ‘You will see\r\nby my letter of the 29th July the errors that you have been labouring\r\nunder as to Lord Wellington’s real designs. Hasten, therefore, to\r\ncarry out the orders which I give you--viz. to evacuate Andalusia and\r\nmarch with your whole army on Toledo[635].’ Even so the King did not\r\nobtain exact obedience to his commands, but received a second series\r\nof counter-projects: and in the end Soult marched not on Toledo but on\r\nValencia, and only many days after he had been instructed to commence\r\nhis movement.\r\n\r\n  [635] Joseph to Soult of 29 July and August 2, _Correspondence_,\r\n  ix. pp. 60-1.\r\n\r\nWellington was, of course, unaware of the exact motives which had\r\ninduced King Joseph to make his flank march to Segovia, but he\r\nconsidered that it might mean that there was some intention on the part\r\nof Clausel to bring the Army of Portugal to join the Army of the Centre\r\nby way of the Upper Douro [i. e. via Aranda]. He therefore resolved\r\nto make such a conjunction impossible, by driving the King over the\r\nmountains and towards Madrid[636].\r\n\r\n  [636] Wellington to Bathurst, Olmedo, July 28: ‘I think it\r\n  probable that they [the Army of Portugal] will endeavour to join\r\n  the King on the Upper Douro, if the King should continue on this\r\n  side of the mountains, unless I should previously have it in my\r\n  power to strike a blow against his corps.’\r\n\r\nWhile Anson’s and Arentschildt’s cavalry continued the pursuit of\r\nClausel on the 29th-30th, and the 1st and Light Divisions were brought\r\nup to the neighbourhood of Tudela, opposite Valladolid, the rest of\r\nthe army was turned against King Joseph. It was necessary to find out,\r\nas a preliminary, whether he was really making a stand at Segovia. To\r\nascertain this point D’Urban’s Portuguese horse pushed out from Olmedo\r\non the 29th, and found the King’s cavalry in Santa Maria de Nieva, ten\r\nmiles in front of Segovia. Deserters from the Spanish Guards here came\r\nin to D’Urban, and gave him useful information as to the exact strength\r\nof the Army of the Centre. On the 30th Wellington placed at D’Urban’s\r\ndisposal the German Heavy Dragoons, a battalion of Halkett’s brigade\r\nof the 7th Division, and a British battery, telling him to drive in\r\nthe enemy’s screen. The French gave way reluctantly, and on hearing\r\nof their attitude Wellington ordered the whole 7th Division to follow\r\nD’Urban’s detachment, and other divisions to make ready to move in\r\nsuccession. But the report that Segovia was being firmly held, as the\r\n_point de rassemblement_[637] for Clausel, turned out to be false, for\r\nwhen the flying column approached that city it learnt that the main\r\nbody of the enemy had left it in the morning for the Guadarrama pass.\r\nA considerable rearguard, under General Espert[638], however, was left\r\nto guard Segovia till the King should have got a fair start; and its\r\nmediaeval walls made it defensible for a short time against a force\r\nwithout heavy artillery. D’Urban could do nothing with his cavalry,\r\nbut sent to Wellington a request that the 7th Division might move\r\nround to intercept Espert’s retreat towards the Guadarrama by a forced\r\nmarch. His chief replied that he had no great faith in the success of\r\nany of these attempts to ‘cut the French off,’ and that it did not\r\nappear to him more practicable at Segovia than elsewhere. ‘The result\r\nof such attempts would merely be to fatigue the troops in getting into\r\nSegovia, and it might as well be done without fatiguing them.’ And\r\nso it was, for Espert decamped by night on August 3 unmolested, and\r\nD’Urban entered the place next morning, followed some time later by\r\nthe infantry. He at once explored the mountain road toward the pass,\r\nand found that the French had completely disappeared: not even at the\r\n‘Puerto’ of the Guadarrama was a vedette to be seen.\r\n\r\n  [637] This was the term that D’Urban used when describing, on\r\n  July 30, the position of the French.\r\n\r\n  [638] Apparently two battalions of the Baden regiment, some\r\n  _Juramentados_, and a regiment of dragoons, about 1,800 men.\r\n\r\nWellington had now to revise his whole plan of campaign, since it\r\nhad become clear that the two armies opposed to him had retreated in\r\ndifferent directions, and could not possibly combine. While it was\r\nstill conceivable that Clausel might defend the line of the Douro, he\r\nhad brought up the main body of his infantry to Olmedo. But after his\r\nentry into Valladolid on the 30th, and the precipitate retreat of the\r\nArmy of Portugal toward Burgos, he had been for two days under the\r\nimpression that King Joseph might stand at Segovia. Not only had he\r\nsent on the German dragoons and the 7th Division to follow D’Urban,\r\nbut on July 31st he moved his own head-quarters and the 3rd Division\r\nto Cuellar, while the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions were at El Pino on\r\nthe Cega river, a few miles behind. He wrote next morning (August\r\n1st) that he was in such a position that Joseph and Clausel could not\r\npossibly join, and that if the King lingered any longer at Segovia, ‘I\r\ncan move upon him, and make him go quicker than he will like[639].’ But\r\nhe imagined that the Army of the Centre would fall back instantly on\r\nMadrid--as indeed it was doing at the very moment that he was writing\r\nhis dispatch.\r\n\r\n  [639] All these details are from dispatches of Wellington to\r\n  D’Urban in the unpublished D’Urban papers, dated between July 30\r\n  and August 2, or from D’Urban’s report to Wellington.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the information that Joseph had vanished, Wellington\r\nhalted for three whole days [August 2nd, 3rd, 4th] with his\r\nhead-quarters at Cuellar, and his infantry gathered round him in its\r\nneighbourhood. The 1st and Light Divisions, which had marched as far\r\nas the Douro, came southward to join the rest. But it was only on the\r\n5th that orders were issued for the march of nearly the whole army on\r\nSegovia, by the road to Mozencillo. During these three days of halt\r\nWellington had made up his mind as to his general policy. Clausel,\r\nwhose army was harmless for the present, was to be ignored: only a\r\nsmall containing force was to be left in front of him, while the main\r\nbody of the Anglo-Portuguese host marched on Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe strategical purpose that determined this decision was never set\r\nforth in full by Wellington. His contemporary dispatches to Lord\r\nBathurst and to Hill are short, and lack explanatory detail--he states\r\nhis decision, but says little of his reasons for making it. Nor did he,\r\nat the end of the campaign, write any long official narrative of his\r\ndoings, as he had done in 1810 and 1811. The causes that governed his\r\naction have to be deduced from scattered opinions expressed in many\r\ndifferent documents. We need hardly take seriously the common French\r\ndictum, found in many a book written by his exasperated opponents,\r\nthat he ‘wished to parade himself as conqueror and liberator in the\r\nSpanish capital.’ That was not the sort of motive which any serious\r\nstudent of Wellington’s character would dream of imputing to him. Nor,\r\nif we translate it into less offensive terms, would it be true to say\r\nthat it was the political advantage of expelling the King from Madrid,\r\nand so demonstrating to all Europe the weakness of the French hold\r\non the Peninsula, that was the determining cause of the march into\r\nNew Castile and the abandonment of the campaign on the Douro. We must\r\nrather look for definite military reasons. And of these the predominant\r\none was that he conceived that the most probable result of the battle\r\nof Salamanca would be to force the King to call up Soult and Suchet to\r\nMadrid, in order to check the Anglo-Portuguese army, even at the cost\r\nof abandoning great tracts of conquered land in Andalusia and Valencia.\r\nSuch indeed, as we have already seen, was Joseph’s purpose. The order\r\nto Soult to evacuate his viceroyalty and to march on Toledo with his\r\nwhole army had been issued a day or two before Wellington had made up\r\nhis mind to turn southward. Suchet had been directed at the same time\r\nto send all that he could spare toward Madrid. Though the pursuit of\r\nClausel to the Ebro offered many advantages, it would be a ruinous move\r\nif the enemy should concentrate 70,000 men at Madrid, and then march\r\non Valladolid, to take the allied army in the rear and cut it off from\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nIt was quite uncertain whether Soult or Suchet would make this move.\r\nBut that it was the correct one is certain. Wellington was aware that\r\nSoult had been summoned to send troops northward. Hitherto he had found\r\nexcuses for refusing to obey, as his last intercepted dispatch of July\r\n8th sufficiently showed. But the results of Salamanca might probably\r\nrender further disobedience impossible: and the moment that Soult\r\nshould hear of that tremendous event, it was reasonable to suppose that\r\nhe would abandon his viceroyalty, and march to join the King with every\r\navailable man. If he found Joseph and his army still in possession of\r\nMadrid, they would have a central base and magazines from which to\r\noperate, and a very favourable strategic position. It was true that\r\nWellington could call up Hill’s 18,000 men, but this was the only\r\nsuccour on which he could count: neither Ballasteros nor the numerous\r\ngarrison of Cadiz would ever appear in New Castile, if old experience\r\nwas to be trusted. If some Spaniards did arrive, they would be very\r\nuncertain aid. Granted, therefore, that Soult marched on Toledo and\r\nMadrid to join the King, Wellington must take almost every man of the\r\nSalamanca army to face them, even allowing for the certain junction of\r\nHill. He could only afford to leave a small ‘containing force’ to look\r\nafter Clausel.\r\n\r\nBut there was another possibility which made the situation still more\r\ndoubtful. Would Suchet also push up to join King Joseph with the\r\nArmy of Valencia, or the greater part of it? If he should do so, the\r\nodds would be too great, and a defensive campaign to cover Portugal,\r\nand so much as was possible of the newly regained Spanish provinces,\r\nwould be the only resource. But Suchet’s action depended upon a factor\r\nover which Wellington had some influence, though not a complete and\r\ndominating control. When he had started on the Salamanca campaign he\r\nhad been relying on Lord William Bentinck’s Sicilian expedition to\r\nkeep the French in Valencia engaged: an attack on Catalonia would draw\r\nSuchet northward with all his reserves, and nothing would be left\r\nwhich O’Donnell and the Spanish army of Murcia could not ‘contain.’ It\r\nwill be remembered that a few days before the battle of Salamanca[640]\r\nWellington had received the disheartening news that Bentinck had\r\ncountermanded his expedition, and was turning himself to some\r\nchimerical scheme for invading Italy. This had left Suchet’s attention\r\nfree for the moment, and he might conceivably have sent troops to\r\njoin the Army of the Centre. Fortunately he had not done so--only\r\nPalombini’s division and the small garrison of Cuenca had been swept up\r\nby King Joseph, without the Marshal’s consent and much to his disgust.\r\n\r\n  [640] See above, p. 408.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the whole prospect in eastern Spain had been transformed\r\nby the cheering news, received on July 30th near Valladolid[641],\r\nthat Bentinck had once more changed his mind, and that a considerable\r\nexpeditionary force under General Maitland had been sent to Majorca, to\r\npick up the Spaniards of Whittingham and Roche, and to execute, after\r\nall, the projected diversion. Maitland’s own dispatch arrived four\r\ndays later; it had travelled with extraordinary celerity from Palma to\r\nCuellar in fifteen days, and announced his arrival on the Spanish coast\r\nand his intention to operate at once. This being so, Suchet would be\r\n‘out of the game’ if all went well, and only the King and Soult need be\r\ntaken into consideration for the next month. But it was all-important\r\nthat the diversion on the East Coast should be executed with firmness\r\nand decision.\r\n\r\n  [641] See _Dispatches_, ix. p. 320.\r\n\r\nThe best summary of Wellington’s views at this moment is to be found in\r\nhis letter to Lord William Bentinck[642], explaining the importance of\r\nMaitland’s action in August.\r\n\r\n  [642] Ibid., p. 321.\r\n\r\n‘I have lately, on the 22nd, beaten Marshal Marmont in a general\r\naction near Salamanca, and I have pursued him beyond the Douro and\r\nentered Valladolid. The King is at Segovia with 12,000 or 15,000\r\nmen, and, having driven Marmont from the lower Douro, my next object\r\nis to prevent him and Marmont (if possible) from joining: this I am\r\nabout to attempt. Either the French [i. e. King Joseph] must lose all\r\ncommunication with their troops in the north of Spain, or they must\r\noblige me to withdraw towards the frontiers of Portugal. This they\r\ncannot effect without bringing against me either Suchet’s army, or\r\nSoult’s army, or both. I cannot but think, therefore, that it is very\r\nimportant that the attention of Suchet should be diverted from his\r\npossible operations against me by the Sicilian army, which will go\r\nto such important objects as Tarragona and Valencia.... If Suchet’s\r\nattention cannot be diverted from me, and (notwithstanding Marmont’s\r\ndefeat) the French become too strong for me, I shall at least have\r\nthe satisfaction of reflecting, while I am retiring, that General\r\nMaitland’s progress will be unopposed, and we shall take Tarragona and\r\nValencia.’\r\n\r\nA few days later Wellington was pleased to find that Suchet had been\r\nduly scared. An intercepted dispatch from him to King Joseph showed\r\nthat he was thinking of nothing but the appearance of an English fleet\r\noff the Valencian coast, and that it was most unlikely that he would\r\nsend any serious succours to the King [643]. There remained therefore\r\nonly Soult to be considered. The natural thing for him to do would\r\nbe to evacuate Andalusia: as Wellington wrote a fortnight later,\r\n‘any other but a modern French army would now leave that province\r\n[644].’ Hill was writing at the same time, ‘Lord Wellington continues\r\nadvancing, and if he is able to keep his forward position, Soult will\r\nbe ordered to reinforce the King. Indeed I think that he _must_ quit\r\nthis part of the country entirely, if matters do not go better with\r\nthem’ [the French][645].\r\n\r\n  [643] Wellington to Maitland, Cuellar, August 3rd, _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 327.\r\n\r\n  [644] Wellington to Bathurst, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 370.\r\n\r\n  [645] Letter in Sidney’s _Life of Hill_, p. 211.\r\n\r\nWhat neither Wellington nor Hill could foresee, in early August, was\r\nthat the Marshal would still hang on to Andalusia, and renew, in a more\r\npressing form, his proposal of July 16th that Joseph and the Army of\r\nthe Centre should take refuge with him beyond the Sierra Morena. But\r\nwhether King Joseph received, or did not receive, succours from the\r\nSouth or East, it was clearly good military policy to turn him out of\r\nMadrid, while the Army of Portugal was still completely negligible as\r\na factor in the game. The loss of Madrid would be ruinous to him if\r\nhe was left without reinforcements: if he received them, the enemy\r\nwould find the problem of subsistence much more difficult if he had\r\nnot Madrid to rely upon as his central base and magazine. Toledo would\r\nnot serve him half so well. And the political effects of the recovery\r\nof the Spanish capital, even if only for a time, must be well worth\r\ngaining. It would shake the confidence of the _Afrancesado_ party all\r\nover the Peninsula, and it would be noted all round Europe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Wellington resolved to leave only a small containing\r\ndetachment on the Douro, to look after Clausel, whose recuperative\r\npower he somewhat underrated, and to march on Madrid with a force that\r\nwould enable him, if joined by Hill, to fight Soult and King Joseph in\r\ncombination. The containing body was put in charge of Clinton, who was\r\nalmost the only divisional general of the old stock who still remained\r\nwith the army. Graham and Picton were invalided, Leith and Lowry Cole\r\nhad been wounded at Salamanca, along with Beresford and Stapleton\r\nCotton. Nearly all the divisions were under interim commanders.\r\nAnother reason for choosing Clinton for the detached duty was that\r\nhis division, the 6th, had suffered more than any other unit at the\r\nrecent battle. It was very low in numbers, only 3,700 men, including\r\nits Portuguese brigade, and needed to pick up convalescents and drafts\r\nbefore it could be considered effective for field service. Along with\r\nthe 6th Division there were left the five battalions[646] that had\r\nrecently joined the army from England or the Mediterranean stations:\r\nthey were all Walcheren regiments, and still riddled with sickness; and\r\nall had suffered from the forced marches which had brought them to the\r\nfront just before. Wellington was discontented with their condition.\r\n‘The truth is, neither officers nor soldiers are accustomed to march.\r\nThe men are very irregular, and owing to their irregularities not able\r\nto bear the labour of marching in the heat of the sun[647].’ They\r\nwere left to strengthen Clinton, and to acclimatize themselves to the\r\nSpanish summer: if taken on to Madrid they would have sown the roadside\r\nwith broken-down stragglers.\r\n\r\n  [646] viz. the 2/4th, 1/5th, 1/38th, 1/42nd, which had arrived in\r\n  time for the battle of Salamanca, the 1/38th on the very battle\r\n  morning, and the 1/82nd which came up after the battle. They were\r\n  all Walcheren regiments: 1/82nd came from Gibraltar, 2/4th from\r\n  Ceuta, the other three from England direct. The 1/5th and 2/82nd\r\n  went on to Madrid in September.\r\n\r\n  [647] Wellington to Bathurst, Cuellar, August 4. _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 339.\r\n\r\nThe five newly-arrived battalions brought Clinton’s strength up to\r\n7,000 infantry. The whole of this force was cantoned in and about\r\nCuellar, while the cavalry allotted to it, Anson’s brigade, took a\r\nmore advanced position, along and beyond the Douro, covering not only\r\nits own infantry but the two Spanish divisions of Santocildes, who\r\nhad occupied Valladolid on August 6th. The remainder of the Army\r\nof Galicia was still occupied in the interminable siege of Astorga,\r\nwhich to Wellington’s disgust still lingered on. The heavy guns had at\r\nlast come up from Corunna, but the bombardment seemed to have little\r\neffect. Silveira had resumed the blockade of Zamora, but having no\r\nsiege artillery could only wait till starvation should compel its\r\ngarrison of 700 men to submit. Toro and Tordesillas were the only other\r\nplaces where Marmont had left a detachment; the latter surrendered to\r\nSantocildes on his march to Valladolid--about 300 French were taken\r\nthere. The former was still holding out, observed by a small Spanish\r\nforce. The task of keeping a close look-out upon Clausel was handed\r\nover to the guerrilleros--the Castilian chiefs Saornil, Marquinez, and\r\nPrincipe. An English officer, who spent some days with the two last at\r\nthis juncture, describes them as ‘bandits, but very troublesome ones\r\nfor the French.’ Deducting the Spaniards left before Astorga, and the\r\nPortuguese left before Zamora, there were some 18,000 men in all told\r\noff to ‘contain’ Clausel. The orders left behind[648] were that they\r\nshould remain in their cantonments unless the enemy should move--which\r\nWellington did not think a likely contingency, ‘as they have nothing\r\nbut their cavalry in a state fit for service.’ But if, rallying sooner\r\nthan he expected, the French should march by Palencia to try to rescue\r\nthe garrisons of Astorga and Zamora, Santocildes was to retire, and\r\nto endeavour to defend the line of the Esla, while Silveira was to\r\nraise the blockade of Zamora and fall back behind that same river. If,\r\ninstead of making a raid westward to save the garrisons, Clausel should\r\nmove against Valladolid and the line of the Douro, Anson’s cavalry was\r\nto retire and join Clinton at Cuellar; and if the enemy came on against\r\nthem in full force, both were then to fall back on Segovia. Santocildes\r\nwas then directed to endeavour to move round Clausel’s rear, and\r\nto cut his communication with Burgos. Contrary to Wellington’s\r\nexpectation[649], as we shall presently see, the French general made\r\nboth the moves suggested--he sent a column to relieve Astorga and\r\nZamora, and marched with his main body on Valladolid. The consequences\r\nof his advance will be related in their due place.\r\n\r\n  [648] Memorandum for General Clinton, to be communicated to\r\n  General Santocildes. _Dispatches_, ix. pp. 344-6.\r\n\r\n  [649] It is curious to find that while in the ‘Memorandum’ of\r\n  August 4 Wellington states that it is ‘not very probable’ that\r\n  Clausel will move, in a letter to Santocildes sent off the very\r\n  next day, he remarks that an advance from Burgos into the kingdom\r\n  of Leon, to relieve Astorga, is ‘most likely.’ I fancy that the\r\n  former was his real opinion, and that the latter was spoken of\r\n  with some stress in the directions to Santocildes, mainly because\r\n  Wellington wished to impress on the Spaniard the duty of being\r\n  cautious and retiring to the Esla without offering battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF KING JOSEPH. MAJALAHONDA. WELLINGTON AT MADRID\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus made all his arrangements for ‘containing’ Clausel, and for\r\ndealing with what he considered the unlikely chance of an offensive\r\nmove by the Army of Portugal, Wellington was at liberty to carry out\r\nhis new strategical move. The mass of troops collected at Cuellar and\r\nits neighbourhood was at last set in motion, and, after his short\r\nhalt and time of doubting, he himself marched against Madrid with the\r\nwhole remaining force at his disposal--the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th,\r\nand Light Divisions, Arentschildt’s, Bock’s, and Ponsonby’s [late Le\r\nMarchant’s] cavalry brigades, the Portuguese infantry of Pack and\r\nBradford, with D’Urban’s horse of that same nation, as also Carlos de\r\nEspaña’s Spanish infantry and Julian Sanchez’s lancers. The whole,\r\nallowing for Salamanca losses and the wear and tear of the high-roads,\r\namounted to about 36,000 men[650]. It was ample for the hunting of\r\nKing Joseph, and sufficient, if Hill were called up, to face the King\r\nand Soult in conjunction, supposing that the latter should at last\r\nevacuate Andalusia and march on Toledo. Santocildes and Clinton were\r\ninformed that it was the intention of the Commander-in-Chief to return\r\nto Castile when affairs in the South had been settled in a satisfactory\r\nfashion. No date, of course, could be assigned: all would depend on\r\nSoult’s next move.\r\n\r\n  [650] The 1st and 7th Divisions alone were up to their usual\r\n  strength. The 4th and Light Divisions were still showing very\r\n  weak battalions, owing to their dreadful Badajoz losses; and the\r\n  former had also suffered very severely (1,000 casualties) at\r\n  Salamanca. The 5th and 3rd had comparatively moderate casualties\r\n  at each of these fights, but the combination of the two\r\n  successive sets of losses had reduced them very considerably.\r\n\r\nOn August 7th the vanguard, consisting of the force that had occupied\r\nSegovia--D’Urban’s Portuguese squadrons, the heavy German dragoons,\r\nMacdonald’s horse artillery troop, and one light battalion of the\r\nGerman Legion--marched forward six leagues, ‘five of them against the\r\ncollar,’ remarks an artillery officer. The steep route lay past the\r\nroyal summer-palace of San Ildefonso, ‘a beautiful place, and most\r\nmagnificently fitted up: what is very singular, the French have not\r\ndestroyed a single stick of it: the rooms are hung as thick as can be\r\nwith paintings _of sorts_[651].’ No hostile vedettes were discovered\r\non the Guadarrama, and a reconnoitring party pushed as far as the\r\nEscurial, and reported that the enemy’s most outlying picket was at\r\nGalapagar, three or four miles to the south-east of that melancholy\r\npile. Meanwhile the main body, a march behind the vanguard, started\r\nfrom Segovia on the 8th, Ponsonby’s dragoons and the 7th Division\r\nleading; then came Alten’s brigade, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Divisions,\r\nand Pack. The rear was brought up by the 1st and Light Divisions and\r\nBradford, who only started from the neighbourhood of Segovia on the 9th\r\n[652]. The necessity for moving the whole army by a single mountain\r\nroad--though it was a well-engineered one--caused the column to be of\r\nan immoderate length, and progress was slow. Head-quarters were at San\r\nIldefonso on the 8th and 9th August, at Nava Cerrada (beyond the summit\r\nof the Guadarrama) on the 10th, at Torre Lodones near the Escurial on\r\nthe 11th.\r\n\r\n  [651] Dyneley’s diary in _R. A. Journal_, vol. xxiii. p. 454.\r\n\r\n  [652] Many of the brigades did not march through Segovia, but by\r\n  crossroads around it: steep gradients and fatigue were thereby\r\n  avoided. One route was by the deserted palace of Rio Frio, an old\r\n  royal hunting-box.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile D’Urban, far ahead of the main body, occupied the Escurial\r\non the 9th, and pushed on cautiously to Galapagar, from whence the\r\nenemy had vanished. His rearguard was discovered at Las Rosas and\r\nMajalahonda, five miles nearer to Madrid. Wellington’s orders were that\r\nhis vanguard was to keep well closed up, the Germans close behind the\r\nPortuguese, and that nothing was to be risked till support from the\r\nleading divisions of the army was close at hand. Wherefore on the 10th\r\nD’Urban, finding the French in force at Las Rosas, only advanced a few\r\nmiles, and bivouacked on the Guadarrama river at the bridge of Retamar.\r\nHe received news from the peasantry that King Joseph was preparing to\r\nevacuate Madrid, that convoys had already started, and that the main\r\nbody of the Army of the Centre was to march by the road of Mostoles on\r\nToledo, where Soult was expected in a few days. The information--true\r\nas regards the evacuation, false as regards the approach of Soult--was\r\nduly sent back to Wellington, who lay that night at Nava Cerrada,\r\nfifteen miles to the rear, with the 7th Division and Ponsonby’s cavalry\r\n[653].\r\n\r\n  [653] All this from D’Urban’s unpublished diary, as are also most\r\n  of the details about the movements of the troops.\r\n\r\nMadrid was at this moment a scene of tumult and despair. The King had\r\nretired from Segovia still in a state of uncertainty as to whether\r\nWellington intended to turn against him, or whether he would pursue\r\nClausel. He quite recognized the fact that, even if Soult obeyed the\r\nlast dispatch sent to him on August 2nd, it would be too late for\r\nhim to arrive in time to save Madrid. But there was a pause of some\r\ndays, while Wellington was making up his mind at Cuellar, and it was\r\nonly on the morning of the 8th that the news arrived that a strong\r\ncolumn (D’Urban and the advanced guard) had started from Segovia on\r\nthe preceding day, and that more troops were following. The orders to\r\nmake ready for departure were issued at once, and a veritable panic\r\nset in among the French residents and the _Afrancesados_. ‘Every one,’\r\nwrote a keen observer on the 9th August, ‘is packing up his valuables\r\nand making ready for a flitting. Not to speak of the many Spaniards of\r\nbirth and fortune who have committed themselves to the King’s cause,\r\nthere is an infinite number of minor officials and hangers-on of the\r\npalace, who by preference or by force of habit stuck to their old\r\nplaces. All these poor wretches dare not stay behind when the King\r\ngoes--their lot would be undoubtedly a dreadful one, they would fall\r\nvictims to the ferocious patriotism of their fellow-citizens, who have\r\nnever forgiven their desertion. Since the word for departure went\r\nround, every one has been hunting for a vehicle or a saddle-beast, to\r\nget off at all costs. Add to this crowd a swarm of valets, servants,\r\nand dependants of all sorts. Most of the merchants and officials are,\r\nas is natural, taking their families with them: the caravan will be\r\ninterminable. All night the noise of carriages, carts, and wagons,\r\nrolling by without a moment’s cessation under my windows, kept me from\r\nsleep.’ On the next morning he adds, ‘More than 2,000 vehicles of one\r\nsort and another, loaded with bundles and bales and furniture, with\r\nwhole families squatting on top, have quitted Madrid. Adding those who\r\nfollow on foot or on horseback, there must be easily 10,000 of them.\r\nThey are mostly without arms, there are numbers of women, old people,\r\nand children: it is a lamentable sight: they take the Aranjuez road,\r\nguarded by a considerable escort[654].’\r\n\r\n  [654] Reiset’s _Souvenirs_, ii. pp. 358-60.\r\n\r\nThe King, after resigning himself to the retreat, and giving orders for\r\nthe departure of the convoy and the greater part of his infantry, had\r\nstill one troublesome point to settle. Should he, or should he not,\r\nleave a garrison behind, to defend the great fortified _enceinte_ on\r\nthe Retiro heights, outside the eastern gate of the city, which his\r\nbrother had constructed, to serve as a citadel to hold down Madrid,\r\nand an arsenal to contain the assortment of stores of all kinds. Heavy\r\nmaterial, especially in the way of artillery--had been accumulating\r\nthere since the French occupation began. Here were parked all the guns\r\ncaptured at Ucles, Almonaçid, and Ocaña, and tens of thousands of\r\nmuskets, the spoil of those same fields. There was a whole convoy of\r\nclothing destined for the Army of the South, and much more that Joseph\r\nhad caused to be made for his skeleton army of _Juramentados_. There\r\nwere 900 barrels of powder and some millions of rounds of infantry\r\ncartridges, not to speak of much arsenal plant of all kinds. All this\r\nwould have either to be blown up or to be defended. The fortifications\r\nwere good against guerrilleros or insurgents: there was a double\r\n_enceinte_ and a star-fort in the interior. But against siege-guns\r\nthe place could obviously hold out for not more than a limited number\r\nof days. After twenty-four hours of wavering, Joseph--contrary to\r\nJourdan’s advice--resolved to garrison the Retiro, on the chance that\r\nit might defend itself till Soult reached Toledo, and a counter-attack\r\nupon Madrid became possible. If Soult should not appear, the place\r\nwas doomed clearly enough: and the previous behaviour of the Duke of\r\nDalmatia made it by no means likely that he would present himself\r\nin time. However, the King directed Lafon Blaniac, the governor of\r\nthe province of La Mancha, to shut himself in the works, with some\r\n2,000 men, consisting mainly of the drafts belonging to the Army\r\nof Andalusia: he would not leave any of the Army of the Centre.\r\nProbably he considered that Soult would feel more interest in the\r\nfate of the Retiro if his own men formed its garrison. They were a\r\nhaphazard assembly, belonging to some dozen different regiments[655],\r\nunder-officered and mostly conscripts. But they were all French troops\r\nof the line; no _Juramentados_ were among them. To their charge were\r\nhanded over some 500 non-transportable sick of the Army of the Centre,\r\nmostly men who had collapsed under the recent forced marches to and\r\nfrom Blasco Sancho. They were not in the Retiro, but at the military\r\nhospital in the Prado, outside the fortifications.\r\n\r\n  [655] The surrender-rolls show that there were also some small\r\n  leavings of Marmont’s troops in the Retiro, notably from the 50th\r\n  Line [of which there were no less than six officers]. Of the Army\r\n  of the South the 12th and 27th Léger, and 45th and 51st Line were\r\n  strongly represented.\r\n\r\nHaving sent off towards Aranjuez his convoy and the larger part of\r\nhis troops, the King was suddenly seized with a qualm that he might\r\nbe flying from an imaginary danger. What if the column that had been\r\nheard of on the Guadarrama was simply a demonstration--perhaps half a\r\ndozen squadrons and a few battalions of infantry? He would be shamed\r\nfor ever if he evacuated his capital before a skeleton enemy. Obsessed\r\nby this idea, he ordered General Treillard to take the whole of his\r\ncavalry--over 2,000 sabres--and drive in Wellington’s advanced guard\r\nat all costs: Palombini’s Italian division marched out from Madrid to\r\nsupport the reconnaissance. Treillard was ordered to use every effort\r\nto take prisoners, from whom information could probably be extracted by\r\njudicious questioning.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th the French outpost-line outside of Madrid\r\nhad been held only by Reiset’s brigade of dragoons (13th and 18th\r\nregiments), about 700 sabres. It was these troops that D’Urban had\r\ndiscovered on the previous night at Las Rosas: at dawn he proceeded\r\nto drive them in, making sure that they would retire, as they had\r\nregularly done hitherto. His own force was much the same as that of\r\nthe enemy, his three weak regiments (seven squadrons) amounting to a\r\nlittle over 700 men. But he had with him Macdonald’s horse artillery,\r\nand the French were gunless. Demonstrating against Reiset’s front with\r\ntwo regiments, D’Urban turned him with the third and two guns. The\r\nflank movement had its due effect, and the dragoons gave back, when\r\nshelled diagonally from a convenient slope. They retired as far as\r\nthe village of Las Rosas, and made a stand there: but on the flanking\r\nmovement being repeated, they again drew back, and passing a second\r\nvillage--Majalahonda--went out of sight, taking cover in woods in the\r\ndirection of Mostoles and Boadilla. D’Urban was now within seven miles\r\nof Madrid, and thought it well to write to Wellington to ask whether\r\nhe should endeavour to enter the city or not. The reply sent to him\r\nwas that he was to go no farther than Aravaca--three miles outside the\r\nwalls--till he should be supported; the head of the main column, headed\r\nby Ponsonby’s heavy dragoons, would be up by the evening.\r\n\r\nLong before this answer reached him D’Urban was in terrible trouble.\r\nThe manœuvring of the morning had taken up some four hours; it was\r\nabout 10 when the French disappeared. While waiting for orders, the\r\nbrigadier directed his regiments to quarter themselves in Majalahonda,\r\nwater their horses, and cook their midday meal. After the pickets had\r\nbeen thrown out, all went quietly for five hours, and most of the men\r\nwere enjoying a siesta at 3.30. They had now support close behind them,\r\nas the heavy German brigade, and the 1st Light Battalion of the K.G.L.\r\nhad come up as far as Las Rosas, only three-quarters of a mile to their\r\nrear. The advance was to be resumed when the worst heat of the day\r\nshould be over.\r\n\r\nBut a little before four o’clock masses of French cavalry were seen\r\ndebouching from the woods in front of Boadilla. This was Treillard,\r\nwho had come up from the rear with four fresh regiments (19th and\r\n22nd Dragoons, Palombini’s Italian _Dragons de Napoléon_, and the 1st\r\nWestphalian Lancers[656]), and had picked up Reiset’s brigade on the\r\nway. The whole force was over 2,000 strong, and was advancing in three\r\nlines at a great pace, evidently prepared to attack without hesitation.\r\nD’Urban had barely time to form a line in front of Majalahonda, when\r\nthe enemy were upon him.\r\n\r\n  [656] Treillard calls them only _les lanciers_ in his report.\r\n  Dyneley in his narrative calls them Polish lancers, but they were\r\n  really the Westphalian _Chevaux-légers-lanciers_ of the Army of\r\n  the Centre.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the wise policy would have been to make a running\r\nfight of it, and to fall back at once on the Germans at Las Rosas,\r\nfor the Portuguese were outnumbered three to one. But D’Urban was a\r\ndaring leader, honourably ambitious of distinction, and the excellent\r\nbehaviour of his brigade at Salamanca had inspired him with an\r\nexaggerated confidence in their steadiness. He sent back messengers\r\nto hurry up the German dragoons, and took position in front of\r\nMajalahonda, throwing out one squadron in skirmishing line[657],\r\ndeploying five more in line of battle (1st and 12th regiments), and\r\nkeeping one in reserve on his left flank to cover four horse artillery\r\nguns there placed. Here also were placed a party of forty of the German\r\nDragoons, who had been sent out on exploring duty, and joined the\r\nPortuguese in time for the fight.\r\n\r\n  [657] This was a squadron of the 11th, whose other squadron\r\n  formed the reserve.\r\n\r\nTreillard came on in three successive lines of brigades, each composed\r\nof six squadrons, Reiset’s dragoons (13th and 18th) forming the front\r\nline, the other dragoon brigade (19th and 22nd) the second, and the\r\ntwo foreign regiments the reserve. The clash came very quickly, before\r\nthe British guns had time to fire more than three or four rounds. The\r\nPortuguese rode forward briskly enough till they were within a few\r\nyards of the enemy, when they checked, wavered, and went about, leaving\r\ntheir brigadier and their colonels, who were riding well in front,\r\nactually in the French ranks. D’Urban cut his way out--the Visconde\r\nde Barbaçena and Colonel Lobo were both severely wounded and taken\r\nprisoners. The broken line shivered in all directions, and went to the\r\nrear pursued by the French: some of the fugitives rode into and carried\r\naway the reserve squadron, which abandoned the guns on the left as they\r\nwere limbering up. There was a wild chase for the mile that intervened\r\nbetween the battle spot in front of Majalahonda and the village of Las\r\nRosas. In it three of the four horse artillery guns were captured--one\r\nby a wheel breaking, the other two by their drivers being cut down by\r\nthe pursuing dragoons. Captain Dyneley, commanding the left section\r\nof the battery, and fourteen of his men were taken prisoners--mostly\r\nwounded. The small party of German dragoons, under an officer named\r\nKuhls, who chanced to be present, made a desperate attempt to save the\r\nguns. ‘Oh, how those poor fellows behaved!’ wrote Dyneley, ‘they were\r\nnot much more than twenty in number, but when they saw the scrape our\r\nguns were in, they formed up to support us, which they had no sooner\r\ndone than down came at least 150 dragoons and lancers: the poor fellows\r\nfought like men, but of course they were soon overpowered, and every\r\nsoul of them cut to pieces.’\r\n\r\nThe main body of the leading French brigade rode, without a check,\r\nup to the first houses of Las Rosas, where they found the German\r\nheavy brigade only just getting into order, so swift had the rout\r\nbeen. When D’Urban’s first alarm came to hand, the horses were all\r\nunsaddled, the men, some asleep, some occupied in grooming their\r\nmounts or leading them to water. The trumpets blew, but the squadrons\r\nwere only just assembling, when in a confused mass and a cloud of\r\ndust flying Portuguese and pursuing French hurtled in among them.\r\nThat no irreparable disaster took place was due to two causes--two\r\ncaptains[658], who had got a few of these men already together,\r\ngallantly charged the head of the French to gain time, and some of the\r\nlight infantry opened a spattering fire upon them from the houses.\r\nReiset called back his regiments to re-form them, and meanwhile the\r\nGermans came pouring out of the village and got into line anyhow, ‘some\r\non barebacked horses, some with bare heads, others in forage-caps, many\r\nin their shirt-sleeves.’ By the time that the French were advancing\r\nagain, all the four squadrons of the heavies were more or less in\r\nline, and D’Urban had rallied the greater part of his Portuguese on\r\ntheir left. The fight in front of Las Rosas was very fierce, though\r\nthe Portuguese soon had enough of it and retired. But the Germans\r\nmade a splendid resistance, and ended by beating back the front line\r\nof the enemy. Treillard then put in his second line, and under the\r\ncharge of these fresh squadrons the dragoons of the Legion, still\r\nfighting obstinately, were pressed back to the entrance of the village:\r\nColonel Jonquières, commanding the brigade in Bock’s absence, was\r\ntaken prisoner with a few of his men. The salvation of the overmatched\r\ncavalry was that the light infantry battalion of the Legion had now\r\nlined the outskirts of the village, and opened such a hot fire that the\r\nenemy had to draw back.\r\n\r\n  [658] Reizenstein and Marshalk.\r\n\r\nWhat Treillard would have done had he been left undisturbed it is\r\nimpossible to say, but just at this moment Ponsonby’s cavalry brigade\r\nand the head of the infantry column of the 7th Division came in sight\r\nfrom the rear, hurrying up to support the vanguard. The French drew\r\noff, and retired in mass, with such haste that they did not even bring\r\noff the captured guns, which were found by the roadside not much\r\ndamaged, though an attempt had been made to destroy their carriages.\r\n\r\nIn this fierce fight, which was so honourable to the Germans and so\r\nmuch the reverse to the Portuguese, the vanguard lost nearly 200 men.\r\nThe heavy brigade had 1 officer and 13 men killed, 5 officers and 35\r\nmen wounded, 1 officer (Colonel Jonquières) and 6 men prisoners. The\r\nPortuguese naturally suffered much more--by their own fault, for it\r\nwas in the rout that they were cut up. They had 3 officers and 30 men\r\nkilled, 3 officers and 49 men wounded, and 1 officer[659] and 22 men\r\nmissing. Macdonald’s unfortunate battery lost 6 killed, 6 wounded, and\r\nits second captain (Dyneley) and 14 men missing: most of the latter\r\nwere more or less hurt. The K.G.L. light battalion had 7 wounded. The\r\ntotal casualty list, therefore, was 15 officers and 182 men. It is\r\nprobable that the French did not suffer much less, for they had as\r\nmany as 17 officers disabled, including Reiset, the brigadier who led\r\nthe first line, and 11 more of the officers of his two regiments: the\r\nsupporting corps lost only 5 officers wounded among the four of them\r\n[660]. But a loss of 17 officers must certainly imply that of at least\r\n150 men: the Germans had used their broadswords most effectively.\r\nTreillard sought to diminish the effect of his loss by making the\r\npreposterous statement that he had killed 150 of the allies, wounded\r\n500, and carried off 60 prisoners; he forgot also to mention that he\r\nleft the three captured guns behind him.\r\n\r\n  [659] Colonel Lobo: the other colonel (the Visconde de Barbaçena)\r\n  who was taken, had been so severely wounded that the French left\r\n  him behind.\r\n\r\n  [660] Three in the 19th Dragoons, one in the 22nd, one in the\r\n  Italian regiment. Oddly enough, of seventeen officers in the\r\n  casualty list, only one (a _chef d’escadron_ of the 13th) was\r\n  killed. The sabre disables, but does not usually slay outright.\r\n\r\nAfter this affair Wellington made the memorandum: ‘the occurrences of\r\nthe 22nd of July [Salamanca] had induced me to hope that the Portuguese\r\ndragoons would have conducted themselves better, or I should not have\r\nplaced them at the outposts of the army. I shall not place them again\r\nin situations in which, by their misconduct, they can influence the\r\nsafety of other troops[661].’ It is fair to D’Urban’s men, however,\r\nto remember that they were put into action against superior numbers,\r\nand with a knowledge that they themselves were unsupported, while the\r\nenemy had two lines of reserve behind him. To be broken under such\r\ncircumstances was perhaps inevitable. But the second rout, in the\r\nvicinity of Las Rosas, was much more discreditable. Their brigadier,\r\nvery reticent in his dispatch to Wellington, wrote in a private letter:\r\n‘The same men who at Salamanca followed me into the French ranks like\r\nBritish dragoons, on this 11th of August at the first charge went\r\njust far enough to leave me in the midst of the enemy’s ranks. In the\r\nsecond, which, having got them rallied, I attempted, I could not get\r\nthem within ten yards of the enemy-they left me alone, and vanished\r\nfrom before the helmets like leaves before the autumn wind[662].’\r\n\r\n  [661] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 354.\r\n\r\n  [662] There are very full narratives of Majalahonda to be\r\n  got from D’Urban’s correspondence, Reiset’s memoirs, and the\r\n  letters of Dyneley, who was lucky enough to escape a few days\r\n  later and rejoin his troop. Schwertfeger’s _History of the\r\n  German Legion_ gives the facts about the part taken by the\r\n  K.G.L. Light Battalion, whose service Wellington ignored in his\r\n  dispatch--wrongly stating that it was not engaged. Treillard’s\r\n  dispatch is a fine piece of exaggeration, but useful as giving\r\n  the official French view of the affair.\r\n\r\nTreillard brought back to King Joseph the news that Wellington in\r\nperson was certainly marching on Madrid with the greater part of his\r\narmy. Indeed his prisoners had tried to scare him by saying that 8,000\r\nhorse were coming down on him, and otherwise exaggerating the numbers\r\nof the allies. The cavalry brigades fell back to form the rearguard\r\nof the King’s army, which moved on Valdemoro and Aranjuez, not toward\r\nToledo, for certain information had come that none of Soult’s troops\r\nwere anywhere near that ancient city. The convoy had been turned\r\ntowards Ocaña, and the road to Valencia.\r\n\r\nWellington entered Madrid unopposed next day--vexed that his arrival\r\nshould have been marred by the untoward business at Majalahonda, ‘a\r\ndevil of an affair,’ as he called it in a private letter to Stapleton\r\nCotton[663]. But the inhabitants of the Spanish capital took little\r\nheed of the mishap--the departure of the French was the only thing that\r\nmattered. Their enthusiasm was unbounded.\r\n\r\n  [663] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 351.\r\n\r\n‘I never witnessed,’ wrote an intelligent observer in the ranks[664],\r\n‘such a scene before. For a distance of five miles from the gates\r\nthe road was crowded with the people who had come out to meet us,\r\neach bringing something--laurel boughs, flowers, bread, wine, grapes,\r\nlemonade, sweetmeats, &c. The road was like a moving forest from the\r\nmultitude who carried palms, which they strewed in the way for us to\r\nmarch over. Young ladies presented us with laurel, and even fixed it in\r\nour caps: others handed us sweetmeats and fruit. Gentlemen had hired\r\nporters to bring out wine, which they handed to us as we passed by:\r\nevery individual strove to outvie each other in good nature. On the\r\nother hand the feelings of each British soldier were wound up to the\r\nhighest pitch--Wellington himself rode at the head of our regiment,\r\nwe were flushed with victory, and a defeated enemy was flying in\r\nour front: proud of the honour paid us by the people, we entered\r\nMadrid, the air rent with cries of “Long live Wellington, Long live\r\nthe English.” The crowd and shouts and ringing of bells was beyond\r\ndescription. The men on the flanks were involuntarily dragged out of\r\ntheir subdivisions into houses, and treated with the best that could be\r\nfound for them. It was with difficulty that Lord Wellington could keep\r\nhis seat on horseback-every one was pressing round him.’ They kissed\r\nhis hands, his sword, even his horse and the ground he had passed\r\nover. It would have been a moment of intoxicating exultation to most\r\nmen: but Wellington looked beyond the laurels and the shouting. ‘It\r\nis impossible to describe the joy of the inhabitants on our arrival:’\r\nhe wrote, in his rather ponderous style, ‘I hope that the prevalence\r\nof the same sentiment of detestation of the French yoke which first\r\ninduced them to set the example of resistance to the usurper, will\r\nagain induce them to make exertions in the cause of their country,\r\nwhich, being more wisely directed, will be more efficacious than those\r\nthey formerly made[665].’ But hope is not the same as expectation.\r\n\r\n  [664] Journal of Wheeler of the 51st, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  [665] To Lord Bathurst, August 13. _Dispatches_, ix. 355.\r\n\r\nThat evening the whole city was illuminated, and the streets were so\r\nfull, till long after midnight, of crowds tumultuously joyful, that\r\nsome cautious officers feared that the French garrison of the Retiro\r\nmight sally out to make mischief in the confusion. Lafon-Blaniac,\r\nhowever, kept quiet--he was already quailing over two discoveries--the\r\none that his water supply was very short, the other that the inner\r\n_enceinte_ of the works was so full of miscellaneous combustible stuff,\r\nshot in at the last moment, that nothing was more probable than a\r\ngeneral conflagration if he were to be bombarded. It had also begun\r\nto strike him that his outer line of defences was very weak, and his\r\nsecond one very constricted for the amount of men and material that\r\nhe had in charge. The larger _enceinte_, indeed, only consisted, for\r\nthe greater part of its extent, of the loopholed wall of the Retiro\r\nPark, with some _flèches_ placed in good flanking positions. On the\r\nside facing the Prado were buildings--the Retiro Palace and the\r\nMuseum, which had been barricaded and made tenable: they formed the\r\nstrongest section of the exterior line. The inner _enceinte_ was a more\r\nformidable affair--with ten bastioned fronts on the scale of a powerful\r\nfield-work. The star-fort, which constituted the final refuge for the\r\ngarrison, was built around the solid building that had once been the\r\nroyal porcelain manufactory (where the celebrated Buen Retiro china was\r\nmade): it had a ditch twelve feet deep and twenty-four wide, and was\r\nformidably palisaded.\r\n\r\nWellington reconnoitred the works on the 13th, and directed that the\r\nouter line should be stormed that night. Three hundred men of the\r\n3rd Division were told off to break into the Park wall on the north,\r\nnear the Bull-Ring: 300 more from the 51st and 68th regiments of the\r\n7th Division were to attack the south-west angle of the _enceinte_,\r\nwhich was formed by the wall of the Botanical Garden. Both assaults\r\nwere completely successful--the walls were so flimsy that they\r\nwere easily hewn through with picks, or beaten in with beams used\r\nas battering-rams, and the 68th found and broke open a postern. The\r\nresistance was very weak--only ten of the storming-parties were killed\r\nor wounded, and the enemy retired almost at once into his second line,\r\nabandoning the Palace and other fortified buildings.\r\n\r\nLafon-Blaniac was now in a deplorable position, for there was only one\r\nwell of moderate capacity within the second _enceinte_ to serve the\r\nwhole garrison. He had lost those in the Palace at the foot of the\r\nhill: and the old porcelain manufactory, within the star-fort, had been\r\nwont to be supplied by a little aqueduct, which had of course been\r\ncut by the British. It was clear that a lack of water would soon be a\r\nserious problem: but a superfluity of fire was a still more probable\r\none--the garrison was crowded up among buildings and stores, and the\r\nlarge factory inside the star-fort was specially dangerous--a very\r\nfew shells would suffice to kindle it and to smoke out or smother its\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th Lafon-Blaniac sent out a flag of truce,\r\nostensibly to deliver a threat to fire upon the town if he were\r\npressed, really to see if he could get tolerable terms, before the\r\nBritish had begun to batter him, for he could note preparations to\r\nbring up heavy guns being made. Wellington saw the _parlementaire_\r\nin person, and a conclusion was arrived at in a very few minutes.\r\nTolerable conditions of surrender were granted--the garrison to march\r\nout with honours of war, the officers to keep their swords, horses,\r\nand baggage, the men their knapsacks unsearched. All arms and stores\r\nwere to be handed over intact. At four o’clock the French marched out,\r\n‘most of them drunk, and affecting a great rage against the governor\r\nfor surrendering so tamely.’ Yet it is clear that he could not have\r\nheld out for more than a day or two, with great loss of life and no\r\nstrategical profit, since there was absolutely no chance of the place\r\nbeing relieved. The prisoners were sent off under escort to Lisbon.\r\nOn the way they were joined by the garrison of Guadalajara, which\r\nhad surrendered with equal facility to the Empecinado--this was a\r\nforce of _Juramentados_ and foreigners--regiments Royal-Étranger and\r\nRoyal-Irlandais, about 900 strong, under a General de Prieux, of the\r\nSpanish not the French service. They feared for their necks if they\r\nresisted the guerrilleros, and made practically no resistance.\r\n\r\nThe stores in the Retiro proved most useful--nearly every regiment at\r\nMadrid was supplied with new shoes from them: the stock of blue French\r\nregimental coats was issued to the artillery and light dragoons, to be\r\ncut up into jackets; Joseph’s _Juramentado_ uniforms served to reclothe\r\nCarlos de España’s and Julian Sanchez’s men. The most unexpected find\r\nin the fort was the eagles of the 51st Line and 12th Léger, which\r\nhad somehow got into the Retiro, though the bulk of those corps were\r\nwith Soult’s army, and only detachments of them were at Madrid. They\r\nwere sent to the Prince Regent, and now hang in the chapel of Chelsea\r\nHospital[666]. The garrison was found to consist of 4 _chefs de\r\nbataillon_, 22 captains, 42 other officers, and 1,982 men--the latter\r\nincluding some 200 non-military employés. In addition, 6 officers and\r\n429 rank and file had been surrendered in the hospital, which was\r\noutside the Retiro, before the attack on the place began[667].\r\n\r\n  [666] The second eagle is in error described in Wellington’s\r\n  dispatch as that of the 13th--which was in Russia at the time.\r\n\r\n  [667] For the ‘siege’ of the Retiro see (besides the official\r\n  sources) Burgoyne’s _Diary_, i. pp. 208-9, and the narratives of\r\n  Green of the 68th and Wheeler of the 51st. For the use of the\r\n  French uniforms see the _Dickson Papers_, ed. Major Leslie, ii.\r\n  pp. 738-9.\r\n\r\nHere we must leave Wellington for a space, triumphant in the Spanish\r\ncapital, and much worried by the polite and effusive attentions of\r\nthe authorities and inhabitants, who lavished on him and his officers\r\nbanquets, balls, and bull-fights for many days, in spite of the penury\r\nwhich had been prevailing for years in the half-ruined city. Never was\r\nan army better treated--wine could be had for the asking, and at last\r\nthe men had to be confined to their quarters for many hours a day, lest\r\nthey should be killed by kindness. The Constitution was proclaimed\r\nin state, a patriotic municipality elected, and Carlos de España was\r\nmade governor. He signalized his appointment by arresting a good many\r\n_Afrancesados_ and garotting with much ceremonial the priest Diego\r\nLopez, who had been one of King Joseph’s most noted spies.[668]\r\n\r\n  [668] Grattan’s _With the Connaught Rangers_, p. 275.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--For the garrison of the Retiro I can find no regular\r\n  details; Wellington gives only totals of the surrendered force.\r\n  But a paper of Jourdan’s (at Paris), though dated so far back as\r\n  July 17th, speaks of the Madrid garrison as containing 230 men\r\n  of the 3/12th Léger, 250 of the 3/45th, and a whole _bataillon\r\n  de marche_ more of Soult’s army, 750 strong, together with 200\r\n  _hommes isolés_, and a considerable number of dismounted cavalry.\r\n  I suspect that these formed the Retiro garrison in August as well\r\n  as in July. The other troops noted as left at Madrid on July\r\n  18th--a battalion of Nassau, the dépôts of the Royal Guard, 28th\r\n  and 75th, and three Spanish battalions, were certainly _not_ in\r\n  the surrender, and had marched off on August 10th with the King.\r\n  But a good many scores of the 50th, belonging to Marmont’s army,\r\n  were among the prisoners. I suspect that these were the garrison\r\n  of Avila, which retired on Madrid on getting the news of the\r\n  battle of Salamanca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS IN THE SOUTH. JUNE-AUGUST 1812. SOULT, HILL, AND BALLASTEROS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months elapsed between Wellington’s passage of the Agueda on his\r\noffensive march into the kingdom of Leon, and his triumphal entry\r\ninto Madrid. During this critical time there had been constant alarms\r\nand excursions in Andalusia and Estremadura, but nothing decisive had\r\noccurred. This was all that Wellington wanted: if employment were\r\nfound for the French Army of the South, so that it got no chance of\r\ninterfering with the campaign on the Douro, he was perfectly satisfied,\r\nand asked for nothing more.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that his instructions to Hill, before he started\r\non the march to Salamanca, were that Soult must be diverted as far\r\nas possible from sending troops northward. The main scheme was that\r\nBallasteros and Hill should, if possible, combine their operations so\r\nas to bring pressure upon the enemy alternately[669]. The Cadiz Regency\r\nhad readily agreed to stir up the Spanish general to activity: if he\r\nwould demonstrate once more (as in April) against Seville, so as to\r\nattract Soult’s attention, and cause him to concentrate, Hill should\r\npress in upon Drouet and the French troops in Estremadura, so as to\r\nforce the Marshal to draw off from the Spaniard. Similarly, if Soult\r\nshould concentrate against Hill, Ballasteros was to strike again at\r\nSeville, or the rear of the Cadiz Lines, which would infallibly bring\r\nthe Marshal southward again in haste[670].\r\n\r\n  [669] Wellington to Henry Wellesley at Cadiz, _Dispatches_,\r\n  ix. p. 169, same to same of June 1, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 197,\r\n  Wellington to Hill (June 6th), _Dispatches_, ix. p. 215, and more\r\n  especially the last paragraph of Wellington to Henry Wellesley\r\n  of June 7th, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 219, and same to same of June\r\n  10th, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 224.\r\n\r\n  [670] To quote Wellington’s own rather heavy but quite explicit\r\n  phrases: ‘I am certain that the enemy will move into Estremadura\r\n  upon Hill, as soon as it is known that _I_ have moved: and I\r\n  hope everything will then be done by Ballasteros, and the Army\r\n  of Murcia, and the troops in Cadiz, to divert the enemy from\r\n  their intentions upon Hill.’ And, on the other hand, in a letter\r\n  differing in date from that first cited by three days, ‘The\r\n  Spanish government have desired that in case of a movement by\r\n  Marshal Soult on General Ballasteros, General Hill should make\r\n  a movement to divert his attention from Ballasteros. I have\r\n  directed this movement, in the notion that the Conde de Villemur\r\n  [the Spanish commander in Estremadura] will also co-operate\r\n  in it.’ The see-saw of alternate distractions is clearly laid\r\n  down--but Ballasteros (as usual) proved a difficult factor to\r\n  manage.\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington crossed the Agueda [June 13] Hill had his corps\r\ncollected in central Estremadura--head-quarters at Almendralejo, the\r\ntroops cantoned about Ribera, Villafranca, Fuente del Maestre, and Los\r\nSantos, with Penne Villemur’s Spanish horse in front at Zafra. Hill\r\nhad in hand his old force--the 2nd Division and Hamilton’s Portuguese,\r\nwith two (instead of the usual one) British and one Portuguese cavalry\r\nbrigades. He could also call up, if needed, the three strong Portuguese\r\ninfantry regiments (5th, 17th, 22nd) which were holding Badajoz till\r\na sufficient native garrison should be provided for it. At present\r\nonly a few hundred Spaniards [Tiradores de Doyle] had appeared. Far\r\naway, to the north of the Guadiana, observing the French posts on the\r\nTagus, there was a detached Portuguese cavalry regiment at Plasencia.\r\nThis outlying unit was also put under Hill’s charge: its object was to\r\ngive early notice of any possible stir by the French, in the direction\r\nof Almaraz or the recently restored bridge of Alcantara. Morillo’s\r\ninfantry division of Castaños’s army was lying on the right of Hill,\r\nin south-western Estremadura: Wellington suggested that the Spanish\r\ngeneral might be willing to throw it into Badajoz, and so liberate\r\nthe Portuguese regiments lying there, if Soult should advance before\r\nthe regular garrison intended for the great fortress should arrive\r\nfrom Cadiz. The whole force watching Soult amounted to nearly 19,000\r\nmen, not including the Spaniards. Of this total about 7,500 sabres\r\nand bayonets were British--something over 11,000 were Portuguese.\r\nIn addition, Morillo and Penne Villemur had not quite 4,000 Spanish\r\nhorse and foot. Supposing that a minimum garrison were thrown into\r\nBadajoz--Morillo’s infantry for choice--Hill could dispose of 18,000\r\nAnglo-Portuguese for field-operations, not including the Portuguese\r\ncavalry by the Tagus, who had the separate duty of watching the Army of\r\nthe Centre.\r\n\r\nThe French in Estremadura still consisted of the old contingent which\r\nD’Erlon had been administering since the year began, viz. his own\r\nand Daricau’s infantry divisions, with Lallemand’s and Perreymond’s\r\ncavalry--altogether not more than 12,000 men, for several of the\r\ninfantry regiments had lost a battalion apiece when Badajoz fell. Since\r\nhis excursion to Don Benito and Medellin at the time of Hill’s raid on\r\nAlmaraz, D’Erlon had drawn back, abandoning all southern and most of\r\neastern Estremadura to the allies. He himself was lying at Azuaga and\r\nFuente Ovejuna, on the slopes of the Sierra Morena, while Daricau was\r\nmore to the north, about Zalamea, rather too far off to give his chief\r\nprompt support. Daricau’s detachment in this direction seems to have\r\nbeen caused by a desire to make communication with the Army of Portugal\r\neasy, if the latter should ever come southward again from the Tagus,\r\nand push to Truxillo as in 1811. It was clear that unless Soult should\r\nreinforce his troops to the north of the mountains, Hill need fear\r\nnothing: indeed he had a distinct superiority over D’Erlon.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, however, there was no danger that any troops from\r\nSeville would come northward, for Ballasteros’s diversion had taken\r\nplace somewhat earlier than Wellington had wished, and the disposable\r\nreserve of the Army of Andalusia was far away in the extreme southern\r\npoint of the province. After his success at Alhaurin in April, and his\r\nsubsequent pursuit by Soult’s flying columns, Ballasteros had taken\r\nrefuge--as was his wont when hard pressed--under the guns of Gibraltar.\r\nThe French retired when they had consumed their provisions, and fell\r\nback to their usual stations at Malaga and Ronda, and along the line\r\nof the Guadalete. When they were gone, the Spanish general emerged in\r\nMay, and recommenced his wonted incursions, ranging over the whole\r\nof the mountains of the South. Having received the dispatches of the\r\nRegency, which directed him to execute a diversion in favour of the\r\nallied army in Estremadura, he obeyed with unexpected celerity, and\r\ntook in hand a very bold enterprise. General Conroux, with the column\r\nwhose task it was to cover the rear of the Cadiz Lines, was lying at\r\nBornos, behind the Guadalete, in a slightly entrenched camp. He had\r\nwith him about 4,500 men[671]. Ballasteros resolved to attempt to\r\nsurprise him, on the morning of June 1. Having got together all his\r\ndisposable troops, 8,500 infantry and a few squadrons of horse[672],\r\nhe made a forced march, and, favoured by a heavy mist at dawn, fell\r\nupon the enemy’s cantonments and surprised them. He won a considerable\r\nsuccess at first: but the French rallied, and after a hard fight broke\r\nhis line by a general charge, and drove him back across the Guadalete.\r\nConroux was too exhausted to pursue, and Ballasteros remained in\r\nposition, apparently meditating a second attack, when on seeing some\r\ncavalry detachments coming up to join the enemy, he sullenly retired.\r\nHe had lost 1,500 men and 4 guns, the French over 400[673]. The first\r\nnote of alarm from Bornos had caused Soult to send what reserves he\r\ncould collect from the Cadiz Lines and Seville--six battalions and\r\ntwo cavalry regiments, and since Ballasteros had been beaten, but\r\nnot routed, he thought it necessary to give prompt attention to him.\r\nThereupon the Spaniard retreated first to Ubrique, and when threatened\r\nin that position, to his old refuge in the lines of San Roque before\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\n  [671] 9th Léger, 96th Ligne, a battalion of the 16th Léger, and\r\n  the 5th Chasseurs.\r\n\r\n  [672] Figures in _Los Ejércitos españoles_, p. 128.\r\n\r\n  [673] Possibly more--the casualty list of officers in Martinien’s\r\n  admirable tables is very heavy--9 officers hit in the 9th Léger,\r\n  13 in the 96th Ligne, 3 in the 16th Léger, 5 in the 5th Chasseurs\r\n  à cheval. Thirty officers hit might very probably (but not\r\n  certainly) mean 600 casualties in all.\r\n\r\nSoult would have liked to make an end of him, and would also have been\r\nglad to direct a new attack upon Tarifa, which served as a second base\r\nto the roving Spanish corps; he mentions his wish to capture it in more\r\nthan one of his dispatches of this summer. But his attention was drawn\r\naway from Ballasteros and the South by the prompt advance of Hill, who\r\n(as had been settled) pressed in upon Drouet at the right moment. On\r\nthe 7th June he moved forward his head-quarters from Almendralejo to\r\nFuente del Maestre, and two days later to Zafra. On the 11th, Penne\r\nVillemur’s cavalry pushed out from Llerena towards Azuaga, while\r\nSlade’s brigade, advancing parallel with the Spanish general, pressed\r\nforward from Llera on Maguilla, a village some fifteen miles in front\r\nof Drouet’s head-quarters at Fuente Ovejuna. This reconnaissance in\r\nforce brought on the most unlucky combat that was ever fought by the\r\nBritish cavalry during the Peninsular War, the skirmish of Maguilla.\r\n\r\nSlade, an officer whose want of capacity we have before had occasion\r\nto notice[674], after some hours of march began to get in touch\r\nwith French dragoon vedettes, and presently, after driving them in,\r\nfound himself facing Lallemand’s brigade. Their forces were nearly\r\nequal--each having two regiments, Slade the 1st Royals and 3rd Dragoon\r\nGuards, Lallemand the 17th and 27th Dragoons--they had about 700\r\nsabres a side: if anything Slade was a little the stronger. The French\r\ngeneral showed considerable caution and retired for some distance,\r\ntill he had nearly reached Maguilla, where he turned to fight. Slade\r\nat once charged him, with the Royals in front line and the 3rd Dragoon\r\nGuards supporting. The first shock was completely successful, the\r\nFrench line being broken, and more than 100 men being taken. But Slade\r\nthen followed the routed squadrons with headlong recklessness, ‘each\r\nregiment,’ as he wrote in his very foolish report of the proceedings,\r\n‘vying with the other which should most distinguish itself.’ The\r\npursuit was as reckless as that of the 13th Light Dragoons at Campo\r\nMayor in the preceding year, and resolved itself into a disorderly\r\ngallop of several miles. After the French had passed a defile beyond\r\nMaguilla a sudden cry was heard, ‘Look to your right’--a fresh squadron\r\nwhich Lallemand had left in reserve was seen bearing down on the flank\r\nof the disordered mass. Charged diagonally by a small force, but one\r\nin good order, the British dragoons gave way. Lallemand’s main body\r\nturned upon them, and ‘the whole brigade in the greatest disorder, and\r\nregardless of all the exertions and appeals of their general and their\r\nregimental officers, continued their disgraceful flight till victors\r\nand fugitives, equally overcome and exhausted by the overpowering heat\r\nand the clouds of thick dust, came to a standstill near Valencia de las\r\nTorres, some four miles from Maguilla, where at last Slade was able to\r\ncollect his regiments, and to retire to the woods beyond Llera[675].’\r\n\r\n  [674] See vol. iv. pp. 187 and 437.\r\n\r\n  [675] See Ainslie’s _History of the 1st Royals_, p. 133.\r\n\r\nIn this discreditable affair Slade lost 22 killed, 26 wounded, and\r\nno less than 2 officers and 116 men taken prisoners--most of the\r\nlatter wounded--a total casualty list of 166. Lallemand acknowledges\r\nin his report a loss of 51 officers and men[676]. The defeated general\r\nirritated Wellington by a very disingenuous report, in which he merely\r\nwrote that ‘I am sorry to say our loss was severe, as the enemy brought\r\nup a support, and my troops being too eager in pursuit, we were obliged\r\nto relinquish a good number of prisoners that we had taken, and to\r\nfall back on Llera.’ He then added, in the most inappropriate phrases,\r\n‘nothing could exceed the gallantry displayed by both officers and men\r\non this occasion, in which Colonels Calcraft and Clinton, commanding\r\nthe two regiments, distinguished themselves, as well as all the other\r\nofficers present[677].’\r\n\r\n  [676] Including one officer killed and four wounded.\r\n\r\n  [677] See Slade’s report in _Dispatches_, ix. pp. 242-3.\r\n  Tomkinson (p. 174) says that Slade’s report to Cotton, commanding\r\n  the cavalry, was ‘the _best_ I ever saw. He made mention of his\r\n  son having stained his maiden sword!’\r\n\r\nWellington’s scathing comment, in a letter to Hill, was: ‘I have never\r\nbeen more annoyed than by Slade’s affair, and I entirely concur with\r\nyou in the necessity of inquiring into it. It is occasioned entirely\r\nby the trick our officers of cavalry have acquired, of galloping\r\nat everything--and then galloping _back_ as fast as they galloped\r\n_on_ the enemy. They never consider their situation, never think of\r\nmanœuvring before an enemy--so little that one would think they cannot\r\nmanœuvre except on Wimbledon Common: and when they use their arm as it\r\nought to be used, viz. offensively, they never keep nor provide for a\r\nreserve.... The Royals and 3rd Dragoon Guards were the best cavalry\r\nregiments in this country, and it annoys me particularly that the\r\nmisfortune has happened to them. I do not wonder at the French boasting\r\nof it: it is the greatest blow they have struck[678].’ It is curious\r\nto find that Slade retained command of his brigade till May 1813. One\r\nwould have expected to find him relegated to Great Britain at a much\r\nearlier date. But Wellington was not even yet in full control of the\r\nremoval or promotion of his senior officers. Other generals with whom\r\nhe was equally discontented, such as Erskine and Long, were also left\r\nupon his hands after he had set a black mark against their names.\r\n\r\n  [678] Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 238.\r\n\r\nThe combat of Maguilla, however unsatisfactory in itself, made no\r\ndifference to the general strategy of the campaign. Drouet, having\r\ndrawn back on Hill’s advance, sent messages to Soult, to the effect\r\nthat unless he were strongly reinforced he must retire from the Sierra\r\nMorena, and cover the roads to Cordova on the Andalusian side of the\r\nmountains. He reported that he had only 6,000 men in hand, and that\r\nHill was coming against him with 30,000, including the Spaniards. Both\r\nthese figures were fantastic--for reasons best known to himself D’Erlon\r\ndid not include Daricau’s division in his own total, while he credited\r\nHill with 15,000 men in the 2nd British division alone [which was\r\nreally 8,000 strong, including its Portuguese brigade], and reported\r\nwith circumstantial detail that the 7th Division had come down from\r\nPortalegre and joined the 2nd[679].\r\n\r\n  [679] Letters of D’Erlon to Jourdan on June 9th, and of Soult to\r\n  King Joseph June 12, copies from the Paris archives--lent me by\r\n  Mr. Fortescue.\r\n\r\nSoult sent on D’Erlon’s dispatch to Madrid, with the comment that\r\nHill’s advance showed that the main intention of Wellington was\r\ncertainly to attack Andalusia, and not to fall upon Marmont. But that\r\nhe did not consider such an attack very imminent is sufficiently shown\r\nby the fact that he detached to Drouet’s aid only one division of\r\ninfantry, that of Barrois--which composed his central reserve--and\r\none of cavalry, that of Pierre Soult, or a total of 6,000 infantry\r\nand 2,200 cavalry: such a reinforcement would have been futile if he\r\nhad really believed that Wellington was marching against Seville.\r\nHis real view may be gathered from his estimate of Hill’s force at\r\n15,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 5,000 Spaniards--a total very remote\r\nfrom the alarmist reports of Drouet, and not far from the truth. The\r\nreinforcement sent under Barrois would give the Estremaduran detachment\r\na practical equality in numbers with Hill, and a great superiority in\r\nquality. The orders sent to Drouet were that he was to advance against\r\nHill, to strive to get him to an engagement, at any rate to ‘contain’\r\nhim, so that he should not detach troops north of the Guadiana to join\r\nWellington or to demonstrate against Madrid. If things went well,\r\nDrouet was to invest Badajoz, and to occupy Merida, from whence he\r\nwould try to get into communication via Truxillo with the troops of the\r\nArmy of the Centre. The final paragraph of his directions stated that\r\nDrouet’s main object must be to make such a formidable diversion that\r\nWellington would have to reinforce Hill. ‘When the Army of Portugal\r\nfinds that it has less of the English army in front of it, we may\r\nperhaps persuade it [i. e. Marmont] that the enemy’s plan is certainly\r\nto invade the provinces of the south of Spain before he acts directly\r\nagainst the North: then, no doubt, changed dispositions will be made.’\r\nUnfortunately for the strategical reputation of Soult, Wellington\r\ncrossed the Agueda with seven of his eight divisions to attack Marmont,\r\non the very day after this interesting dispatch was written.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon had been promised that Barrois should march to his aid on the\r\n14th, but it was not till the 16th that the column from Seville started\r\nto join him, and then it marched not by the route of Constantina and\r\nGuadalcanal, as D’Erlon had requested, but by the high-road from\r\nAndalusia to Badajoz, via Monasterio. If Hill had been pressing the\r\ntroops in front of him with vigour, the French would have been in an\r\nawkward position, since they were on separate roads, and might have\r\nbeen driven apart, and kept from junction by a decisive movement from\r\nLlerena, where Hill’s cavalry and advanced guard lay. But the British\r\ngeneral had orders to attract the attention of Soult and to ‘contain’\r\nas many of the enemy as possible, rather than to risk anything. He\r\nresolved, when he heard of the approach of Barrois, to retire to the\r\nheights of Albuera, which Wellington had pointed out to him as the\r\nmost suitable position for standing at bay, if he were pressed hard.\r\nAccordingly he drew back by slow stages from Zafra towards Badajoz,\r\ncovering his rear by his cavalry, which suffered little molestation.\r\nBarrois joined Drouet at Bienvenida near Zafra on the 19th, and their\r\nunited force, since Daricau had come in to join them from the direction\r\nof Zalamea, with the greater part of his division, must have amounted\r\nto over 18,000 men, though Drouet in a report to King Joseph states it\r\nat a decidedly lower figure[680]. They advanced cautiously as far as\r\nVillafranca and Fuente del Maestre, which their infantry occupied on\r\nJune 21, while their numerous cavalry lay a little way in front, at\r\nVillalba, Azeuchal, and Almendralejo. On the same day Hill had taken up\r\nthe Albuera position, on which several points had been entrenched.\r\n\r\n  [680] In this report (the copy of which I owe to Mr. Fortescue’s\r\n  kindness) Drouet says that Soult had told him to expect\r\n  reinforcements to the total of some 15,000 men, but that Barrois\r\n  brought him only 3,500 infantry and 1,500 horse, and Daricau\r\n  4,500 infantry and 1,000 horse, so that his reinforcements were\r\n  only 10,500 men instead of 15,000. Drouet stated his own force,\r\n  horse and foot (his own division and Lallemand’s cavalry) in a\r\n  preceding letter of June 9th at 6,000 of all arms, so that the\r\n  concentration would only give 16,000 men. I fancy that he is\r\n  deliberately understating Barrois, for that general had 7,000\r\n  men in March, and 5,000 still in October at the end of a long\r\n  and fatiguing campaign, and Pierre Soult too. Drouet’s object\r\n  in giving these figures to Joseph was to prove that he was so\r\n  weak that he could make no detachment towards the Tagus, as the\r\n  King had directed him to do. Was it for the same purpose that he\r\n  always over-stated Hill’s army? Or did he really believe that the\r\n  latter had 30,000 men arranged opposite him, as he repeatedly\r\n  told Soult?\r\n\r\nAs Hill had just called out the three garrison regiments of Portuguese\r\nfrom Badajoz, he had now between 18,000 and 19,000 of his own army in\r\nposition, besides Villemur’s Spanish cavalry. This last, together with\r\nLong’s and Slade’s squadrons, were thrown out in front of the Albuera\r\nriver, with their vedettes in Santa Marta, Almendral, and Corte de\r\nPeleas, only a mile or two from the French advanced posts. They were\r\ndirected not to give way till they were severely pressed, as Hill\r\nwished to avoid at all costs the kind of surprise that had befallen\r\nBeresford in 1811, when Long had retired so precipitately before the\r\nFrench horse that he could give no account of their strength, nor of\r\nthe position of Soult’s infantry. But the expected advance of the enemy\r\nhung fire--from the 21st onwards Hill was waiting to be attacked, and\r\nsending almost daily accounts of the situation to Wellington: but the\r\nmain body of the French moved no farther forward. This was all the more\r\nsurprising to the English general because he had intercepted a letter\r\nwritten on May 31 from King Joseph to Drouet, in which the latter was\r\ndirected to ‘passer sur le corps à Hill[681],’ and then to come up to\r\nthe Tagus to join the Army of the Centre. Not knowing how entirely\r\nSoult and D’Erlon were ignoring all orders from Madrid, both Wellington\r\nand his trusty lieutenant thought that such instructions must almost\r\ncertainly bring about an action. The former wrote to the latter on\r\nJune 28th, after receiving several statements of the situation: ‘if\r\nyou should find that Drouet separates his troops, or if he pretends\r\nto hold you in check with a smaller body of men than you think you can\r\nget the better of, fall upon him, but take care to keep a very large\r\nproportion of your troops in reserve.... I should prefer a partial\r\naffair to a general one, but risk a general affair--keeping always\r\na large body of reserve, particularly of cavalry--rather than allow\r\nDrouet to remain in Estremadura and keep you in check.’ But the enemy\r\nneither came on for a general action, nor scattered his troops so\r\nwidely as to induce Hill to risk an attack on any point of his line.\r\nHe remained with his infantry massed about Villafranca and Fuente del\r\nMaestre, and only demonstrated with his cavalry.\r\n\r\n  [681] Cf. Wellington to Hill of July 11th. _Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n  280.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this inactivity on Drouet’s part was partly, perhaps, his\r\nover-estimate of Hill’s strength, but much more Soult’s unwillingness\r\nto obey the orders sent him from Madrid. He was determined not to\r\ndetach a third part of his army to the Tagus, to join the Army of\r\nthe Centre. He was by this time fully embarked on his long course of\r\ninsubordinate action, with which we have already dealt when writing\r\nof the King’s desires and their frustration[682]. On the 26th May\r\nJoseph had sent him the dispatch which directed that D’Erlon must come\r\nup northward, if Wellington’s main attack turned out to be directed\r\nagainst Marmont and the Army of Portugal: ‘his corps is the pivot on\r\nwhich everything turns: he is the counterpoise which can be thrown\r\ninto the balance in one scale or the other, according as our forces\r\nhave to act on the one side or the other[683].’ Drouet himself had\r\nat the same time received that order to the same effect, sent to\r\nhim directly and not through his immediate superior, which so much\r\nscandalized Soult’s sense of hierarchical subordination[684]. On\r\ngetting the Madrid dispatch of May 26 upon June 8th, Soult had written\r\nto say that Wellington’s real objective was Andalusia and not the\r\nNorth, that Marmont was utterly misled if he supposed that he was to be\r\nattacked by the main body of the allies, that Graham, with two British\r\ndivisions, was still at Portalegre in support of Hill, and that Drouet\r\nhad therefore been forbidden to lose touch with the Army of the South\r\nby passing towards the Tagus. If he departed, the whole fabric of\r\nFrench power in the South would go to pieces, ‘I should have to pack\r\nup and evacuate Andalusia after the smallest check.’ Drouet should\r\n‘contain’ Hill, but could do no more. In a supplementary dispatch of\r\nJune 12, provoked by the receipt of Joseph’s direct orders to Drouet,\r\nSoult went further, definitely stating that the troops in Estremadura\r\nshould not go to the Tagus, ‘where they would be lost to the Army\r\nof the South, but would never arrive in time to help the Army of\r\nPortugal.’ If Drouet passed the Tagus, Hill would march on Seville,\r\nand on the sixth day would capture that insufficiently garrisoned\r\ncapital, put himself in communication with Ballasteros, and raise the\r\nsiege of Cadiz. ‘I repeat that the Army of the South cannot carry\r\nout its orders, and send Count D’Erlon and 15,000 men to the valley\r\nof the Tagus, without being compelled to evacuate Andalusia within\r\nthe fortnight.... If your Majesty insists, remove me from command, I\r\ndo not wish to be responsible for the inevitable disaster that must\r\nfollow[685].’\r\n\r\n  [682] See chapter i above, pp. 309-10.\r\n\r\n  [683] Joseph to Soult, May 26, intercepted dispatch in the\r\n  Scovell ciphers.\r\n\r\n  [684] See above, p. 332.\r\n\r\n  [685] Soult to Joseph, printed in Joseph’s _Correspondence_, ix.\r\n  pp. 31-3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTREMADURA]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Drouet, much vexed at having personal responsibility\r\nthrown upon his shoulders, by the King’s direct orders to him to march\r\nwithout consulting Soult, wrote to Madrid that he was very weak, that\r\nHill was in front of him with a superior force, and that Barrois and\r\nPierre Soult, who had just joined him, were under strict orders not to\r\ngo beyond the Guadiana, so that if he himself marched towards the Tagus\r\nit would be with a very small force. But he dare not make that move:\r\n‘I am absolutely obliged to stop where I am [Villafranca] in presence\r\nof Hill, who still remains concentrated on the Albuera position, which\r\nhe has entrenched, with at least 25,000 men.’ Indeed an attack by Hill\r\nwas expected day by day: ‘at the moment of writing there is lively\r\nskirmishing going on at the outposts, and news has come in that the\r\nwhole allied army is advancing[686].’ Drouet, in short, was determined\r\nto evade responsibility, and summed up the situation by the conclusion\r\nthat he was acting for the best in ‘containing’ Hill and his very\r\nlarge detachment, who could be of no use to Wellington in the campaign\r\nwhich the latter was now reported to have begun against Marmont in the\r\nNorth. He could do no more.\r\n\r\n  [686] Drouet to Joseph, Villafranca, July 3, Paris Archives\r\n  [paper communicated to me by Mr. Fortescue]. Cf. Drouet to\r\n  Jourdan to much the same general effect, of June 18, in King\r\n  Joseph’s _Correspondence_, ix. pp. 36-7.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock in front of the Albuera position lasted for many\r\ndays--from June 21st till July 2nd. This was a very trying time for\r\nHill’s corps--the weather was excessively hot, the ground was hideous\r\nwith the insufficiently buried corpses of the battle of last year, and\r\nsickness was very prevalent in some regiments. For the first day or two\r\nafter the arrival of the French at Villafranca and Almendralejo, an\r\nattack was expected each morning, but nothing in particular happened.\r\nDrouet kept quiet behind his cavalry screen, and did no more than send\r\nforaging parties out on his flanks, which ravaged the countryside as\r\nfar as Merida and Feria. Over-valuing Hill’s strength, he dreaded to\r\ncommit himself to an attack on a superior force, covered by field-works\r\nand in a fine position. Nothing was seen of him for ten days, save that\r\non the 26th he felt the posts of the allies at Corte de Peleas and\r\nSanta Marta, and retired after a little cavalry skirmishing. On July\r\n1, however, he executed a more searching reconnaissance, with three\r\nbrigades of cavalry under the direction of Pierre Soult, Vinot’s in\r\nthe centre, Sparre’s on the right, Lallemand’s on the left. Barrois’s\r\ninfantry division came up in support. Vinot drove in a Portuguese\r\ncavalry regiment of J. Campbell’s brigade from Corte de Peleas[687],\r\nbut retired when he found it supported by Long’s light dragoons in\r\nfront of the Albuera position. Lallemand found Santa Marta held by\r\nPenne Villemur’s cavalry, and turned them out of it with considerable\r\nloss, for the Spanish general unwisely offered battle, and was routed\r\nafter a very short contest. He retired into the wood of Albuera, whose\r\nedge was occupied by Slade’s heavy dragoons, supported by the pickets\r\nof Byng’s infantry brigade. A troop of the 3rd Dragoon Guards made a\r\ngallant charge to cover the retreat of the Spaniards, and suffered some\r\nloss in bringing them off. Lallemand at dusk pressed forward, and cut\r\noff a small party of the Buffs, who would have been taken prisoners if\r\na troop of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L. had not rescued them by a sudden\r\ncounter-attack. Sparre’s brigade on the right did no more than skirmish\r\nwith the allied outposts along the lower course of the river Albuera.\r\nAt night all the French cavalry retired, and D’Erlon wrote to Soult\r\nthat his reconnaissance had ‘completely fulfilled its object,’ by\r\nmaking him certain that Hill had 25,000 foot, 3,000 horse, and a very\r\nstrong force of artillery in position, so that it would be insane to\r\nattack him[688].\r\n\r\n  [687] Espinchal says that the 2nd Hussars captured a Portuguese\r\n  gun: I have no corroboration for this.\r\n\r\n  [688] Details of all this in Soult’s dispatch to Joseph of July\r\n  10, in Espinchal’s _Mémoires_ (he served in Vinot’s brigade), and\r\n  in the diaries of Swabey of the R.A. and of Stoltzenberg of the\r\n  2nd Hussars K.G.L., printed in full in Schwertfeger’s _History of\r\n  the K. G. Legion_, ii. pp. 257-8.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, July 2nd, Hill determined to make use of\r\nWellington’s permission to bring on an action, if he should judge that\r\nDrouet was not strong enough to face him. The weakness of the French\r\ndemonstration had convinced him that the enemy was not ready to fight.\r\nCollecting the whole of his army, he advanced from the Albuera position\r\ntowards Santa Marta, thus challenging Drouet to a fight. The enemy’s\r\nvedettes made no stand and retired when pushed. On reaching Santa Marta\r\nHill halted for the night in battle order, and on the morning of the\r\n3rd resumed his movement, which was directed to cutting off Drouet from\r\nthe great road to Seville. While Erskine with the light cavalry (Long,\r\nand J. Campbell’s Portuguese) advanced down the high-road to Villalba,\r\nsupported by one British and one Portuguese brigade of infantry, Hill\r\nhimself, with the rest of his army, executed a flank march to Feria,\r\nand, having got behind the French left wing, turned inward and moved\r\ntoward Los Santos. The enemy’s main body, at Villafranca and Fuente\r\ndel Maestre, were thus prevented from using the high-road to Seville,\r\nand placed in a position which compelled Drouet either to fight, or to\r\nretire south-eastward towards Usagre and Llerena.\r\n\r\nNext morning (July 4) Hill expected a battle, for Barrois’s division\r\nand all Pierre Soult’s cavalry were found in a strong position at\r\nFuente del Maestre, and the rest of the French were close behind at\r\nAlmendralejo. But when he continued his movement toward the right,\r\noutflanking Barrois instead of attacking him, the enemy gave way and\r\nretired, protected by his cavalry, retreating on Ribera, Hinojosa,\r\nand Usagre[689]. There was lively skirmishing between the squadrons of\r\nthe British advanced guard, and those of the French rearguard, but no\r\nserious engagement.\r\n\r\n  [689] All this from Hill’s dispatch to Wellington of July 4, from\r\n  Los Santos.\r\n\r\nThe same general plan of action continued on the 5th. Hill, keeping\r\nhis army well concentrated, moved in two columns on Usagre and\r\nBienvenida, the bulk of his cavalry riding at the head of his left-hand\r\ncolumn and pressing in the French horse. Drouet took up a position at\r\nValencia de las Torres, where he had found strong ground, and thought\r\non the 6th that he would risk a defensive action. But Hill, instead\r\nof marching in upon him, continued his flanking movement towards\r\nLlerena. Thereupon Drouet, finding that he would be cut off from\r\nAndalusia if he remained in his chosen position, evacuated it and fell\r\nback by Maguilla on Berlanga and Azuaga [July 7]. The two armies had\r\nthus got back into exactly the same positions in which they had lain\r\non June 19th, before Hill’s retreat to Albuera. The tale of their\r\nmanœuvres bears a curious resemblance to the contemporary movements of\r\nWellington and Marmont between Salamanca and Tordesillas. In each case\r\none combatant, when pressed, retired, and took up a strong position\r\n(Marmont at Tordesillas-Pollos-Toro, Hill at Albuera). He then issued\r\nfrom it after some days, and by persistent flank movements dislodged\r\nhis opponent, and drove him back to the same position from which he\r\nhad started, so that the situation came back to that which it had been\r\nthree weeks before. But here the parallel ended--Marmont pressed his\r\nadvantage too far, and got entangled in the disastrous manœuvre of\r\nJuly 22, which brought on the battle of Salamanca and his own ruin.\r\nHill, contented with what he had achieved, halted at Llerena, and did\r\nnot push matters to a decisive action. He had done all that Wellington\r\ndesired in keeping Soult’s attention diverted from Marmont’s peril, and\r\nin ‘containing’ a hostile force as great as his own. Moreover he had\r\ndriven it off the road to Seville, and if it retreated on Andalusia it\r\nwould have to be on Cordova, by the road of Constantina, since no other\r\nremained available.\r\n\r\nBut a new development of this complicated and indecisive campaign\r\nbegan on July 10th. Drouet, thinking apparently that Hill’s farther\r\nadvance might be stopped as effectively by assuming a position on\r\nhis flank as by direct opposition in front, shifted his right wing\r\n(Daricau’s division and Sparre’s and Vinot’s cavalry) back to Zalamea\r\nand its neighbourhood, where Daricau had lain in May and June. He\r\nhimself resumed his old head-quarters at Fuente Ovejuna. Now just at\r\nthis time Hill received an intercepted letter of King Joseph to Drouet,\r\ndated June 21st, which repeated in angry terms the long-ignored orders\r\nthat the Estremaduran detachment of the Army of the South was to march\r\non Toledo without delay. ‘Vous aurez sans doute reçu les renforts que\r\nj’ai donné l’ordre au duc de Dalmatie de vous envoyer. Vous devez avoir\r\nquinze mille hommes. Agissez avec ce corps, et tout ce qui est sous\r\nle commandement du général Daricau. Rapprochez-vous de moi: passez le\r\nTage, et mettez-vous en état d’agir suivant les événements; n’attendez\r\naucun ordre[690].’\r\n\r\n  [690] See Wellington to Hill of July 11 (_Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n  280) and Hill to Wellington of July 9. The text of the order is\r\n  in Joseph’s _Correspondence_, ix. p. 41.\r\n\r\nThe capture of this dispatch coincided with the news that Drouet had\r\npushed Daricau and a large body of cavalry towards Zalamea. Hill drew\r\nthe natural deduction that the French opposite him were at last about\r\nto obey the King’s orders, and to march to the Tagus, via Zalamea,\r\nMedellin, and Truxillo. ‘The intelligence that I have of the enemy’s\r\nmovements’ (he wrote to Wellington) ‘indicates his intention of\r\ncarrying Joseph’s instructions into execution.... I have received\r\ninformation [false as it chanced] that Drouet was yesterday at Zalamea,\r\nwith his main body, having sent troops by Berlanga and Azuaga. I shall\r\nmove immediately in the direction of Zalamea.’ That is to say that if\r\nDrouet was going off northward towards the King, Hill was prepared to\r\ncarry out the original instructions which Wellington had left him, and\r\nif he could not stop the enemy, would move parallel to him, so as to\r\njoin his chief before Drouet could transfer himself to the northern\r\nsphere of operations. His route would be by Badajoz or Merida and the\r\nnewly-restored bridge of Alcantara on Ciudad Rodrigo, a much shorter\r\none than that of his opponent. He had just begun to move his left wing\r\nin the direction of Merida, when he received a letter from Wellington\r\nexactly conforming to his own ideas. If Drouet is making for the Tagus\r\nin full force, wrote Wellington, you must take all the cavalry except\r\none English regiment and Campbell’s Portuguese, along with Byng’s and\r\nHoward’s brigades of the 2nd Division, and Hamilton’s division, and\r\nsend orders to have all preparations made at Alcantara to lay down the\r\nbridge: your route across the mountains will be by the pass of Perales:\r\nyou will find elaborate instructions for the further movement at Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. If Drouet only takes a small force, more allied troops may\r\nbe left in Estremadura; Zafra had better be their head-quarters. Hill\r\nwould conduct the marching column as far as Perales, and then return to\r\ntake charge of whatever is left in the South to watch Soult[691].\r\n\r\n  [691] Wellington to Hill, Rueda, July 11.\r\n\r\nA few days later it became evident that no general movement of the\r\nFrench towards the Tagus was in progress. Daricau’s infantry and the\r\nattached cavalry settled down at and about Zalamea, and pushed nothing\r\nbut reconnaissances in the direction of the Guadiana--parties of\r\nhorse appeared about Don Benito and Medellin, but no solid columns in\r\nsupport[692]. Hill therefore halted, with his head-quarters at Zafra\r\nand his rearguard (which had but a moment before been his advanced\r\nguard) at Llerena: only a few of J. Campbell’s Portuguese squadrons\r\nmoved to Merida, though some Spanish infantry came up to the same\r\ndirection[693]. Things then remained very quiet till July 24th, when\r\nDrouet at last appeared to be on the move with some definite purpose.\r\nOn that day Lallemand’s dragoons appeared at Hinojosa, pressed in\r\na Portuguese cavalry regiment, and seemed inclined to push towards\r\nRibera, but retired when Long’s brigade came up against them: the\r\nlosses on both sides were trifling. Three days later (July 27) a\r\nbrigade of Daricau’s infantry advanced to Medellin and drove off\r\nthe observing force of the Spanish infantry, while Vinot’s cavalry\r\nexecuted a raid on Merida, expelled the Portuguese detachment there,\r\nand exacted a requisition of food from the town. They then retired in\r\nhaste; but Hill thought it well for the future to strengthen his left,\r\nand moved up Byng’s British and A. Campbell’s Portuguese infantry\r\nbrigades to Merida. But Drouet was only feinting, and had no serious\r\nintentions of drawing up to the Guadiana, or crossing that river\r\nnorthward. His main purpose was simply the raising of requisitions; for\r\nhis detachments in the mountains of the Serena were living on the edge\r\nof famine, and could only feed themselves by keeping constantly on the\r\nmove. It is curious to find from the dispatches of the two opposing\r\ngenerals at this time that both were fairly satisfied with themselves:\r\neach thought that he was ‘containing’ a somewhat superior force of the\r\nenemy, and was doing his duty by keeping it from interfering in the\r\nmore important theatre of war. Hill knew that he was detaining Drouet,\r\nwhen he was much wanted at Madrid: Drouet knew that he was preventing\r\nHill from joining Wellington on the Douro. But the real balance of\r\nadvantage was on the side of the allies: Hill, with only 8,000 British\r\nand 11,000 Portuguese was claiming the attention of three veteran\r\ndivisions of the infantry of the Army of the South, and of the major\r\npart of Soult’s cavalry. The French in Andalusia were left so weak by\r\nthe absence of 18,000 men beyond the Sierra Morena, that they could\r\nneither molest Cadiz nor the Army of Murcia. Indeed, Ballasteros,\r\nthough his forces were less than they had been at the time of his\r\ndefeat at Bornos, was able to provide employment for all the troops\r\nthat Soult could spare for operations in the open field.\r\n\r\n  [692] There is plenty of detail about these quite unimportant\r\n  movements in Espinchal, ii. pp. 26-33.\r\n\r\n  [693] Not, however, the bulk of Morillo’s division, which was at\r\n  Medina de las Torres near Zafra, as the general’s correspondence\r\n  of that date shows [Villa’s _Life of Morillo_, ii. p. 224].\r\n\r\nSix weeks after his disaster of June 1st, that enterprising, if\r\nirresponsible, general started out again from the lines of San Roque\r\nwith between 5,000 and 6,000 men. Keeping to mountain roads and\r\nconcealing his march, he surprised, on July 14, the great harbour-city\r\nof Malaga, though he failed to capture its citadel, Gibalfaro, into\r\nwhich the wrecks of the garrison escaped. Ballasteros got money,\r\nstores, and recruits from the captured town, but knew that he dare not\r\ntarry there for long. For Soult, naturally enraged at such a bold and\r\nsuccessful raid, turned troops toward him from all sides. Leval, the\r\ngovernor of Granada, marched against him with every spare battalion\r\nthat could be got together from the eastern side of Andalusia, some\r\n5,000 bayonets. Villatte, in command before Cadiz, came from the other\r\nquarter with 6,000 men; they had orders to catch Ballasteros between\r\nthem, to intercept his retreat upon Gibraltar, and annihilate him.\r\n\r\nIn order to cut off the Spaniard from his usual place of refuge,\r\nVillatte took a turn to the south, appeared in sight of Gibraltar on\r\nJuly 20, and then, keeping himself between the British fortress and\r\nBallasteros, advanced northward to wait for him. Leval was to have\r\ndriven him into Villatte’s arms, advancing from Antequera and pressing\r\nthe hunt southward. But the raider, instead of retreating in the\r\nexpected direction, slipped unseen across Villatte’s front by Alora,\r\nand made off into the plains of central Andalusia. On the 25th at dawn\r\nhe appeared, most unexpectedly, at Osuna and surprised the small French\r\ngarrison there. The governor, Colonel Beauvais, cut his way through the\r\nstreets to a fortified convent, where he held out. But Ballasteros,\r\nsatisfied with having captured a quantity of stores, mules, and\r\nbaggage, and a few prisoners, vanished. Leval was on his track, and\r\nhe had to evade his pursuer by a flank march, first to Grazalema and\r\nthen to Ubrique. This was bringing him dangerously near to Villatte’s\r\nposition. But that general had no accurate knowledge of what was going\r\non to the north, and having waited for ten days in the mountains beyond\r\nGibraltar for a prey that never appeared, found himself starved out. On\r\nthe 30th he started on his enforced return towards the Cadiz Lines, and\r\nhad reached Medina Sidonia when Ballasteros, who had quite outmarched\r\nLeval, came down in safety to Ximena on August 1, and placed himself\r\nin touch with Gibraltar once more. Thereupon Leval, seeing that it was\r\nno use to push the Spaniard (for about the tenth time) under the guns\r\nof the British fortress, and finding his column utterly worn out, went\r\nhome to Granada[694].\r\n\r\n  [694] The best account of all this is in Schepeler, pp. 661-3.\r\n\r\nThus Ballasteros gave no small help to the allied cause by distracting\r\nsome 11,000 or 12,000 French troops for a long fortnight, while Hill\r\nwas detaining Drouet in Estremadura. By the time that the hunt after\r\nthe evasive Spaniard had come to an end, the battle of Salamanca\r\nhad been fought, and the aspect of affairs in the Peninsula had been\r\ncompletely changed. Even Soult, who had so long shut his eyes to the\r\nobvious, had at last to acknowledge that a new situation had arisen.\r\n\r\nThe news of Salamanca had reached Hill on July 29th, and caused a\r\ngeneral expectation that the French in Estremadura would retreat\r\nat once, and that Soult would be retiring from Andalusia also in a\r\nfew days. No such results followed--the intelligence was late in\r\npenetrating to the French camps; and Soult, still hoping to induce\r\nKing Joseph to join him, lingered for many days in his old posture. On\r\nAugust 4 Hill wrote that the ‘recent glorious event’ appeared to have\r\nhad very little effect on his immediate opponent, who continued in a\r\nstrong position in his front. ‘Therefore for the present I shall remain\r\nwhere I am, and watch for a favourable opportunity of acting[695].’\r\nSoult at Seville had, as late as August 8, no official news of\r\nMarmont’s defeat, and only knew of it by Spanish rumours, which he--of\r\nset purpose--discounted. ‘Les relations qu’ils ont publiées exagèrent\r\nsans doute les avantages: mais il paraît que quelque grand événement\r\ns’est passé en Castille[696].’ He continued to urge King Joseph to come\r\nto Seville, join him, and attack Hill with such superior forces that\r\nWellington would be forced to fly to the aid of his subordinate. It\r\nwas only on August 12th that certain information regarding the battle\r\nof July 22nd reached the head-quarters of the Duke of Dalmatia, in\r\nthe form of Joseph’s Segovia dispatch of July 29th, containing the\r\norders for the complete evacuation of Andalusia, and the march of the\r\nwhole Army of the South upon Toledo. Even then Soult did not think it\r\ntoo late to make a final appeal to the King: ‘the loss of a battle by\r\nthe Army of Portugal was nothing more than a great duel, which can\r\nbe undone by another similar duel. But the loss of Andalusia and the\r\nraising of the siege of Cadiz would be events whose effects would be\r\nfelt all round Europe and the New World.... What does it matter if the\r\nenemy is left in possession of the whole space between Burgos and the\r\nSierra Morena, until the moment when great reinforcements come from\r\nFrance, and the Emperor has been able to make his arrangements? But\r\nthis sacrifice of Andalusia once made, there is no way of remedying\r\nit. The imperial armies in Spain will have to repass the Ebro--famine\r\nperhaps will drive them still farther[697],’ &c.\r\n\r\n  [695] Letter of August 4 in Sidney’s _Life of Hill_, p. 210.\r\n\r\n  [696] Soult to Joseph, August 8, Paris Archives (lent me by Mr.\r\n  Fortescue).\r\n\r\n  [697] Soult to Joseph, Seville, August 12, in Joseph’s\r\n  _Correspondence_, ix. pp. 67-8.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, however, Soult did not venture to disobey, and, before\r\nhis last appeal could possibly have reached the King’s hands, began to\r\nissue orders for evacuation. But so great was his rage that he wrote an\r\nextraordinary letter to Clarke, the Minister of War at Paris, in which\r\nhe made the preposterous insinuation that Joseph was about to betray\r\nhis brother the Emperor, and to come to an agreement with the Cadiz\r\nCortes. The evidence which he cited for this strange charge was flimsy\r\nin the extreme. ‘I have read in the Cadiz newspapers the statement that\r\nHis Majesty’s Ambassador in Russia has joined the Russian army: that\r\nthe King has opened intrigues with the Insurrectional Government[698].\r\nSweden has made peace with England, and the Hereditary Prince\r\n(Bernadotte) has begun to treat with the Regency at Cadiz[699].... I\r\ndraw no deduction from all these facts, but I am all the more attentive\r\nto them. I have thought it necessary to lay my fears before six\r\ngenerals of my army, after having made them take an oath not to reveal\r\nwhat I told them save to the Emperor himself, or to some one specially\r\ncommissioned by him. But it is my duty to inform your Excellency that\r\nI have a fear that all the bad arrangements made [by the King] and\r\nall the intrigues that have been going on, have the object of forcing\r\nthe imperial armies to retreat to the Ebro, or farther, and then of\r\nrepresenting this event as the “last possible resource” (an expression\r\nused by the King himself in a letter of July 20), in the hope of\r\nprofiting by it to come to some compromise[700].\r\n\r\n  [698] There _had_ been such intrigues between the King and\r\n  persons in Cadiz (see above, p. 140), but they had been opened by\r\n  Napoleon’s own advice, in order to sow seeds of dissension among\r\n  the patriots.\r\n\r\n  [699] The point of this insinuation is that Bernadotte and Joseph\r\n  were brothers-in-law, having married the two sisters Clary.\r\n\r\n  [700] Printed in Joseph’s _Correspondence_, ix. pp. 68-70.\r\n\r\nThis letter, as obscurely worded as it was malicious, was not sent\r\nto France by the usual channels, lest the King should get wind of it,\r\nbut consigned to the captain of a French privateer, who was about to\r\nsail from Malaga to Marseilles. By an ill chance for Soult, the vessel\r\nwas chased by a British ship, and compelled to run for shelter into\r\nthe harbour of Valencia. There the King had recently arrived, on his\r\nretreat from Madrid. The privateer-captain, who did not know what he\r\nwas carrying, sent the letter in to the royal head-quarters. Hence came\r\nan explosion of wrath, and a series of recriminations with which we\r\nshall have to deal in their proper place.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Andalusia commenced from the western end, because\r\nthe retreat of the army was to be directed eastwards. The evacuation\r\nof the Castle of Niebla on August 12th was its first sign--the troops\r\nin the Condado had retired to San Lucar near Seville by the 15th. A\r\nlittle later the garrisons in the extreme south, at Ronda and Medina\r\nSidonia, blew up their fortifications and retired. These were small\r\nmovements, but the dismantling of the Cadiz Lines was a formidable\r\nbusiness, and took several days. Soult covered it by ordering a furious\r\nbombardment of the city and the Puntales fort from his batteries across\r\nthe bay; during each salvo of the heavy guns one or two of them were\r\ndisabled, others being fired at an angle against their muzzles, so as\r\nto split them. More were burst by intentional over-loading, others\r\nhad their trunnions knocked off, but a good many were only spiked or\r\nthrown into the water. The ammunition remaining after two days of\r\nreckless bombardment was blown up; the stores set on fire; the flotilla\r\nof gunboats was sunk, but so carelessly that thirty of them were\r\nafterwards raised with no difficulty and found still seaworthy. This\r\norgy of destruction continued for the whole of the 24th: at night the\r\nsky was red all round the bay, from Rota to Chiclana, with burning huts\r\nand magazines, and the explosions were frequent.\r\n\r\nThis was the moment when the large allied force in Cadiz might well\r\nhave made a general sortie, for the purpose of cutting up the enemy\r\nwhile he was engrossed in the work of destruction. Wellington had\r\nwritten a week before, to General Cooke, then in command of the British\r\ncontingent in the Isla de Leon, to bid him fall upon the enemy when\r\nopportunity should offer, considering that the French troops in the\r\nLines were reduced to a minimum by the detachment of the division\r\nthat had gone out to hunt Ballasteros. He suggested that the allies\r\nshould cross the Santi Petri river and attack Chiclana, taking care,\r\nhowever, not to be cut off from their retreat. Unfortunately this\r\nletter of August 16th came too late, for Cooke (after conferring with\r\nthe Spanish authorities) had committed himself to another and a more\r\ncircuitous expedition to molest the French. General Cruz Murgeon, with\r\na Spanish division of 4,000 men (which had originally been intended\r\nfor the reinforcing of Ballasteros) had landed at the port of Huelva,\r\nin the Condado de Niebla, on August 11th. Cooke reinforced him with\r\nthe pick of the British contingent--six companies of Guards, half\r\nof the 2/87th[701], two companies of Rifles[702], part of the 20th\r\nPortuguese, and the squadron of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., which was the\r\nonly cavalry at his disposition. These, placed under the charge of\r\nColonel Skerrett, made up 1,600 men in all[703]; they landed at Huelva,\r\njoined Cruz Murgeon, and advanced with him against Seville. On the 24th\r\nthey discovered the French outposts at San Lucar la Mayor, and drove\r\nthem out of that town. But they hesitated over the idea of attacking\r\nSeville, where French troops were collecting from all quarters, though\r\nthe divisions of Conroux and Villatte from the Cadiz Lines had not yet\r\ncome up.\r\n\r\n  [701] Minus four companies left at Tarifa.\r\n\r\n  [702] Two from the 2/95th, those of Cadoux and Jenkins.\r\n\r\n  [703] Skerrett in his dispatch (Wellington, _Supplementary\r\n  Dispatches_, xiv. p. 108), speaks of attacking San Lucar with 800\r\n  men: but this was not his whole force.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 26th-27th, however, Soult, apprised of the near\r\napproach of his column from the Lines, evacuated Seville with the main\r\npart of his force, escorting a vast horde of Spanish refugees, who\r\nfeared to remain behind to face their countrymen, and a long train\r\nof wagons and carriages loaded with the accumulated spoils of three\r\nyears of tyrannous misrule in Andalusia. He left a rearguard to occupy\r\nthe outworks of the city, which was to be picked up and taken on by\r\nVillatte when he should appear on the next day.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the departure of the Marshal, Cruz Murgeon and Skerrett\r\nresolved to attack Seville, knowing that the troops left behind to\r\nguard it were insufficient to man effectively all its long line of\r\ndefences. Being on the western side of the Guadalquivir, they had first\r\nto win the large transpontine suburb of Triana, the home of potters\r\nand gipsies, through which alone access could be got to the city. It\r\nwas attacked at several points and stormed, but the enemy then held\r\nto the great bridge over the river linking Triana and Seville, and\r\nmade a long resistance there. The bridge had been barricaded, part of\r\nits planks had been pulled up, and artillery had been trained on it\r\nfrom the farther side. Notwithstanding these obstacles the Spaniards\r\nattacked it; the well-known Irish adventurer Colonel Downie charged\r\nthree times at the head of his Estremaduran Legion. Repelled twice by\r\nthe heavy fire, he reached the barricade at the third assault, and\r\nleaped his horse over the cut which the French had made in front of it,\r\nbut found himself alone within the work, and was bayoneted and made\r\nprisoner[704]. But soon after the allies brought up guns through the\r\nstreets of Triana, and so battered the barricade that the French were\r\ncompelled to evacuate it. Skerrett sent the Guards across: they passed\r\nby the beams which had been left unbroken, and many Spanish troops\r\nfollowed. After a running fight in the streets of the city, in which\r\nsome of the inhabitants took part, the garrison was completely driven\r\nout, and fled by the Carmona Gate towards Alcala. The victors captured\r\ntwo field-pieces, about 200 prisoners[705], and a rich convoy of\r\nplunder, which was to have been escorted by the French rearguard[706].\r\nVillatte’s column, approaching the city in its march from the Cadiz\r\nLines and Xeres, found it in the hands of the allies, so swerved off\r\neastward and followed Soult, picking up the expelled garrison by the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n  [704] Toreno (iii. p. 151) and other historians tell the tale how\r\n  Downie, finding that none of his men had followed him, though\r\n  they had reached the other side of the cut, flung back to them\r\n  his sword, which was the rapier of the _Conquistador_ Pizarro,\r\n  presented to him by a descendant of that great adventurer. It was\r\n  caught and saved, and he recovered it, for he was left behind by\r\n  the French a few miles from Seville, because of his wounds. They\r\n  stripped him and left him by the wayside, where he was found and\r\n  cared for by the pursuing Spaniards.\r\n\r\n  [705] The defence of Seville seems mainly to have been by the\r\n  French 63rd Ligne, which lost eight officers in the fight.\r\n\r\n  [706] For a curious story of the contents of a captured carriage,\r\n  which turned out to be stuffed with silver plate, see the Memoirs\r\n  of Harley of the 47th, ii. p. 24.\r\n\r\nCruz Murgeon and Skerrett did not pursue, not thinking themselves\r\nstrong enough to meddle with the French, but only sent their cavalry\r\nforward to watch their retreat. They stayed in Seville, where the Cadiz\r\nConstitution was proclaimed with great enthusiasm on August 29th. On\r\nthe other flank of the French Ballasteros was trying at this moment to\r\nmolest the column formed by the garrisons retiring from Ronda, Malaga,\r\nand Antequera on Granada. He followed them for ten days, and fought\r\ntheir rearguard at Antequera on September 3rd, and at Loja on September\r\n5th; but though he captured many stragglers and some baggage, as also\r\nthree guns, he was unable to do any material harm to the main body,\r\nwhich General Sémélé brought in to join Leval at Granada on September\r\n6th.\r\n\r\nSoult, meanwhile, with the troops from Cadiz and Seville, had to halt\r\nat Cordova for some days, to allow of the junction of Drouet from\r\nEstremadura; for that general had to collect his troops and to bring\r\ndown detachments from places so far away as Don Benito and Zalamea,\r\nbefore he could concentrate and march across the Sierra Morena to join\r\nhis chief. Drouet had kept up a bold countenance in front of Hill\r\nto the last moment, even after he had received orders from Soult to\r\nprepare for a sudden retreat. Indeed one of the most lively of the\r\nmany cavalry affairs fought in Estremadura during the summer of 1812\r\ntook place in August. On the 1st of that month, when Hill was already\r\nexpecting that the news of Salamanca would have driven his opponent\r\naway, Pierre Soult tried a raid upon Ribera, with two regiments of\r\ncavalry and two battalions, and drove in the 2nd Hussars of the Legion,\r\nwho maintained a long and gallant skirmishing fight, till General\r\nErskine came up with Long’s brigade, when the French retreated. Erskine\r\nwas thought to have missed a fine opportunity of cutting up the raiding\r\ndetachment by his slow and tentative pursuit[707]. On the 18th Soult\r\nmade another reconnaissance in force, with four regiments, in the\r\nsame direction, on a false report that Hill had moved from Ribera and\r\nAlmendralejo. This brought on another long day of bickering, with no\r\ndefinite result: it was mainly remembered afterwards for the courteous\r\nbehaviour of Drouet in sending back unharmed Erskine’s aide-de-camp\r\nStrenowitz, the most daring officer for raids and reconnaissance work\r\nin the German Legion. He had been captured while scouting, and a\r\ngeneral fear prevailed that he would be shot, for he had served for\r\na short time in the French army, and might have been treated as a\r\ndeserter. Drouet most handsomely dispatched him to the British camp on\r\nparole, with a request that he might be exchanged for an officer of\r\nhis own, who had been taken a few days before. ‘A most courteous and\r\nliberal enemy!’ wrote a diarist in Hill’s camp, ‘Strenowitz’s exploits\r\nare well known: certainly in strict law he might have been hung[708].’\r\n\r\n  [707] ‘Confound all spiritless and dilatory generals,’ writes\r\n  Swabey of the R.A. in his diary, ‘... Sir W. E. actually halted\r\n  while four squadrons and 400 infantry were doing what they liked\r\n  in Ribera, though he had the Hussars, the 9th and 13th Light\r\n  Dragoons, the 3rd Dragoon Guards and our guns, and he might have\r\n  had the 71st regiment also, though it did not arrive till all was\r\n  over. The transaction was calculated to dispirit the soldier, to\r\n  discontent the officers, and to take away all confidence in the\r\n  general.’\r\n\r\n  [708] Swabey’s diary, p. 307. There is an interesting account of\r\n  Strenowitz’s capture and release in Espinchal’s _Mémoires_, ii.\r\n  pp. 36-40, as also of the long skirmish of this day.\r\n\r\nIt was not till August 26th that all the French troops in front of Hill\r\nsuddenly vanished, Drouet having had orders to keep his position till\r\nSeville was ready to be evacuated; for Soult feared that if he withdrew\r\nhis forces in Estremadura too early, in the direction of Cordova, the\r\nallied troops might make a forced march on Seville, and arrive there\r\nbefore the divisions from the Cadiz Lines had gone by. Wherefore Drouet\r\nwas in evidence before Hill till the precise day when Soult left\r\nSeville. He then retired through the Sierra Morena, going by the remote\r\nmountain road by Belalcazar with such speed that he reached Cordova on\r\nthe fourth day (August 30). He was not pursued by Hill, whose orders\r\nfrom Wellington were to come up to the Tagus and join the main army,\r\nand not to involve himself in operations in Andalusia. Only some of\r\nPenne Villemur’s Spanish horse, under the German colonel Schepeler--one\r\nof the best historians of the war--followed on Drouet’s track, and saw\r\nhim join Soult at Cordova[709]. The united French force then marched\r\non Granada, where the garrisons of eastern Andalusia, under Leval, had\r\nconcentrated to meet the Marshal. Up to this moment Soult had been\r\nuncertain whether he should retreat by way of La Mancha, or across the\r\nkingdom of Murcia. His decision was settled for him by news brought by\r\nDrouet, who had heard in Estremadura of King Joseph’s evacuation of\r\nMadrid and Toledo. Since the Army of the Centre was now known to be on\r\nthe road for Valencia, to join Suchet, it would be too dangerous to\r\ncross La Mancha in search of it. Wellington might descend from Madrid\r\nin force, upon an enemy who dared to march across his front. Wherefore\r\nSoult resolved that his retreat must be made across the kingdom of\r\nMurcia. It was true that O’Donnell’s army was in occupation of the\r\ninland in that direction, but it was weak and disorganized. Moreover,\r\nSuchet had lately inflicted a severe defeat upon it at Castalla (on\r\nJuly 21st), and O’Donnell was practically a negligible quantity in the\r\nproblem. A far more important factor in determining Soult’s exact route\r\nwas the news that the yellow fever had broken out at Cartagena and was\r\nspreading inland: it had reached the city of Murcia. Wherefore the\r\nFrench army avoided the coast, and took the inferior roads across the\r\nnorthern part of the province.\r\n\r\n  [709] Schepeler says that he scared the French rearguard out\r\n  of Cordova on September 3 by lighting fires along the mountain\r\n  slopes, and giving out that Hill was behind him with his army.\r\n  See p. 666 of his history.\r\n\r\nSoult, when once he had concentrated 45,000 men at Granada, had nothing\r\nto fear from any enemy. The gloomy picture of ‘a retreat harrassed by\r\n60,000 foes,’ with which he had tried to scare King Joseph a month\r\nbefore, turned out to be a work of pure imagination. Hill had turned\r\noff towards the Tagus: Cruz Murgeon and Skerrett remained at Seville,\r\nawaiting the appearance of the 10,000 men left in Cadiz. But these were\r\nslow to move, because they had been on garrison duty for long years,\r\nand had to provide themselves with transport. Only Ballasteros hung\r\nabout Granada, bickering with the outposts of the French army, and as\r\nhe had no more than 5,000 or 6,000 men he was not dangerous, but only\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\nSoult therefore was able to spend many days at Granada, making\r\ndeliberate preparations for the toilsome march that was before him. He\r\nonly started out, after destroying the fortifications of the Alhambra\r\nand other posts, on September 16th. His route was by Baza, Huescar,\r\nCaravaca, and Hellin, through a mountainous and thinly-peopled country,\r\nwhere his troops suffered considerable privations. But these were\r\nnothing compared to the misery of the immense convoy of _Afrancesados_\r\nof all ages and both sexes, who had joined themselves to his train, and\r\nhad to be brought through to a place of safety. Nor did the 6,000 sick\r\nand wounded whom he was dragging with him enjoy a pleasant journey. Yet\r\nit was only the September heat and the mountain roads that harassed the\r\narmy and its train: Ballasteros did not pursue farther than the borders\r\nof Andalusia: the Murcians were cowed by the approach of a force which\r\ncould have destroyed them with ease if it had lingered within their\r\nborders. Some of them shifted north toward Madrid, others south toward\r\nAlicante: none did anything to attract the notice of such a formidable\r\nenemy. Touch with Suchet’s outposts was secured before September was\r\nquite ended, and by the appearance of the whole Army of Andalusia\r\nnear Valencia, a new military situation was produced by October 1st.\r\nWith this we shall have to deal in its proper place--the fortunes of\r\nWellington and the main army of the allies have not been followed\r\nbeyond the middle of August.\r\n\r\nSumming up the events of June-July-August 1812 in southern Spain, it\r\nis impossible to avoid the conclusion that Soult’s personal interests\r\nwrecked any chance that the French might have had of retaining their\r\ndominant position in the Peninsula, when once Wellington had committed\r\nhimself to his offensive campaign upon the Tormes and the Douro. If the\r\nDuke of Dalmatia had obeyed in June King Joseph’s peremptory orders\r\nto send Drouet to Toledo, he would have had, no doubt, to evacuate\r\ncertain parts of Andalusia. But Joseph and Jourdan could have marched\r\nmany weeks earlier, and with a doubled force, to interfere with\r\nWellington’s campaign against Marmont. It is true that Hill would have\r\nmade a corresponding movement by Alcantara, and would have joined the\r\nmain allied army under his chief many days before the King and Drouet\r\nwould have been able to link up with Marmont. But Hill, on leaving\r\nEstremadura, would have removed the larger and more efficient part of\r\nhis corps from Soult’s vicinity, and the Marshal might easily have\r\nheld Seville and the Cadiz Lines, when faced by no stronger enemies\r\nthan Ballasteros and the garrison in the Isla. If Soult had made up his\r\nmind to sacrifice Andalusia, and had marched with his whole army on\r\nToledo, in June or even early in July, Wellington’s whole game would\r\nhave been wrecked. It was, perhaps, too much to expect that the Marshal\r\nwould consent to such a disinterested policy. But if, without making\r\nthis sacrifice, he had merely obeyed King Joseph, and reinforced the\r\nArmy of the Centre at an early date, he would have made the Salamanca\r\ncampaign impossible. Wellington would probably have retired behind the\r\nAgueda and abandoned his conquests in Leon, without risking a battle,\r\nif the French forces in contact with him had been 25,000 men stronger\r\nthan they actually were. The junction of Hill and some 12,000 men of\r\nthe best of his Estremaduran detachment would have given him the power\r\nto fight out a defensive campaign on the Portuguese frontier, but\r\nhardly to deliver an offensive battle like Salamanca. The net results\r\nof all his manœuvres in June would then have been no more than an\r\nindirect success--the delivery of eastern Andalusia from Soult. Seville\r\nand the Cadiz Lines might still have remained occupied by the French.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to repeat once more that Soult’s counter-plan\r\nof inviting the King and the Army of the Centre to retire to Andalusia,\r\nthrowing up all communication with France and the imperial armies\r\nbeyond the Douro, was wrongheaded in the extreme, though Napier calls\r\nit ‘grand and vigorous[710].’ Joseph could have brought no more than\r\nthe 15,000 men that he owned, and they, when added to the 50,000 men\r\nof the Army of the South, would not have provided a force large enough\r\nto make a decisive move. For, as we have already seen, half the French\r\nin Andalusia were necessarily pinned down to garrison duties, and the\r\n‘containing’ of Ballasteros and other partisans. Soult could never\r\nbring more than 25,000 men of his own into Estremadura: if 15,000 more\r\nare added for King Joseph’s troops[711], only 40,000 in all would have\r\nbeen available for a demonstration (or a serious invasion) in the\r\ndirection of Portugal. Such a force would have given Wellington no\r\nvery great alarm. It would have had to begin by besieging Badajoz and\r\nElvas, in face of the existing ‘containing’ army under Hill, a delicate\r\nbusiness, and one that would have taken time. Meanwhile Wellington\r\ncould have come down, with reinforcements strong enough to make up\r\na total sufficient to fight and beat 40,000 men, since he had the\r\nadvantage of a central position and the shorter roads. At the worst\r\nhe would have blocked the French advance by taking up an unassailable\r\nposition, as he had before on the Caya in June 1811. But now he would\r\nhave had a far superior game in his hands, since Badajoz was his and\r\nnot his enemy’s, and his total disposable force was considerably larger\r\nthan it had been in 1811.\r\n\r\n  [710] Napier, iv. p. 371.\r\n\r\n  [711] Soult suggested that the less efficient of Joseph’s troops\r\n  should go on garrison duty, and set free a corresponding number\r\n  of his own best battalions.\r\n\r\nThus, if Soult’s plan had been carried out, all central Spain,\r\nincluding the capital, would have been lost just as much as it was by\r\nthe actual campaign of July-August 1812, and the disorganized Army of\r\nPortugal could have done nothing. For Wellington could have left not\r\nClinton’s one division (as he actually did) but three at least to look\r\nafter it--not to speak of the Galicians and the _partidas_. Isolated\r\nand cut off from all communication with other French armies, Soult and\r\nthe King would have had to evacuate Andalusia in the end, if they did\r\nnot suffer a worse fate--a crushing defeat in a position from which\r\nthere would have been no retreat possible. Hypothetical reconstructions\r\nof campaigns which might have happened are proverbially futile--but it\r\nis hard to see how any final profit to the French could have come from\r\nSoult’s extraordinary plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  THE TWO DIVERSIONS: (1) OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH: SIR HOME POPHAM\r\n  AND CAFFARELLI. (2) OPERATIONS IN THE EAST: SUCHET, O’DONNELL,\r\n  AND MAITLAND. JUNE-AUGUST 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been made clear that the whole of Wellington’s\r\nvictorious advance, from Ciudad Rodrigo to Madrid, was rendered\r\npossible by the fact that he had only to deal with the Army of\r\nPortugal, succoured when it was too late by the Army of the Centre.\r\nIf Caffarelli and his 35,000 men of the Army of the North had been\r\nable to spare any help for Marmont, beyond the single cavalry brigade\r\nof Chauvel, matters must have taken a very different turn from the\r\nfirst, and the Douro (if not the Tormes) must have been the limit\r\nof the activity of the Anglo-Portuguese army. How Caffarelli was to\r\nbe detained, according to Wellington’s plan, has been explained in\r\nan earlier chapter[712]. The working out of the scheme must now be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n  [712] See above, pp. 340-1.\r\n\r\nThe essential duty of the French Army of the North was twofold,\r\naccording to Napoleon’s general conception of the Spanish war. It was\r\nMarmont’s reserve, bound to assist him in time of trouble; but it was\r\nalso the force of occupation for the Biscayan provinces, Navarre,\r\nSantander, and Burgos. Of its 35,000 men more than half were at all\r\ntimes immobilized in the innumerable garrisons which protected the\r\nhigh-road from Bayonne to Burgos, and the small harbours of the coast,\r\nfrom San Sebastian to Santoña. The system of posts was complicated\r\nand interdependent. Since the great guerrillero Mina started on his\r\nbusy career in 1810, it had been necessary that there should be\r\nfortified places at short intervals, in which convoys moving to or\r\nfrom France (whether by Vittoria and San Sebastian, or by Pampeluna\r\nand Roncesvalles) could take refuge when attacked by the bands.\r\nAnd since a convoy, when it had sought shelter in one of the minor\r\ngarrisons, might be blockaded there indefinitely, unless the high-road\r\nwere cleared betimes, large movable columns had to be ready in three\r\nor four of the larger places. Their duty was to march out on the\r\nfirst alarm, and sweep the guerrilleros away from any post that they\r\nmight have beset. Such bodies were to be found at Bayonne, where the\r\n‘Reserve of the Army of Spain’ kept a brigade of 3,500 men under\r\nGeneral D’Aussenac to watch for any exceptional outbreak of trouble in\r\nGuipuzcoa; at Pampeluna, where General Abbé had the head-quarters of\r\nhis division; and at Vittoria, where the General-in-Chief, Caffarelli\r\nhimself, normally lay with the brigade of Dumoustier--the last unit of\r\nthe Imperial Guard still remaining in Spain--ready to keep the line of\r\nthe Ebro under surveillance, and to communicate when necessary with\r\nthe three large outlying garrisons of Santoña, Santander, and Burgos.\r\nEach of these last consisted of some 1,300 or 1,500 men[713]; even\r\nso, they were only strong enough to provide for their own safety in\r\nnormal times, and might require assistance from head-quarters in face\r\nof any specially large and threatening combination of the insurgents.\r\nBut the larger half of Caffarelli’s army was locked up in small towns,\r\nforts, and blockhouses, in bodies ranging down from a battalion to\r\nhalf a company. Every one of the dozen little ports on the Biscay\r\ncoast had to be held, in order to prevent the bands of the inland from\r\ncommunicating with the English cruisers, which occasionally appeared\r\nin the offing to throw weapons and ammunition ashore. And similarly\r\nall the little towns along the Ebro had to be garrisoned, in order to\r\nkeep touch with Reille at Saragossa; wherever there was a gap Mina’s\r\nNavarrese slipped in between.\r\n\r\n  [713] In and about Santander, 2 battalions of the 130th, 2\r\n  squadrons of gendarmes, &c. In Santoña, 93 officers and 1,382 men\r\n  of the 28th, 75th, and 34th. In Burgos, 2 battalions of 34th Line.\r\n\r\nSince the autumn of 1810, when Porlier and Renovales had made their\r\nvain attempt, with British naval aid, to break up the line of\r\ncommunication along the coast,[714] there had been no general attempt\r\nto shake the French occupation of Biscay and Cantabria. The Spanish\r\nresources were at a low ebb whenever Bonnet held the Asturias, and\r\n(as we have seen) he was generally in possession of that province, or\r\nat least of its capital and its chief harbours, from 1810 down to the\r\nsummer of 1812. The idea of attacking the harbour-fortresses of the\r\nnorthern coast with a considerable naval force, which should get into\r\nregular touch with the patriot forces of the inland, and establish\r\nposts to be held permanently on suitable points of the northern\r\nlittoral, had been started by Sir Home Popham, approved by Sir Howard\r\nDouglas, the British Commissioner in Galicia, and warmly adopted by\r\nWellington himself, who at once realized the pressure which such a\r\npolicy would bring upon Caffarelli. He counted upon this diversion as\r\none of his most valuable assets, when he drew up his scheme for the\r\ninvasion of Leon in May 1812. It more than fulfilled his expectation.\r\n\r\n  [714] See vol. iii. pp. 486-7.\r\n\r\nOn June 17th, four days after the Anglo-Portuguese army crossed\r\nthe Agueda, Sir Home Popham sailed from Corunna with two line of\r\nbattleships[715], five frigates[716], two sloops[717], and one or\r\ntwo smaller vessels, carrying two battalions of marines, and several\r\nthousand stand of small-arms for the insurgents. Popham had credentials\r\nfrom Castaños, as captain-general of Galicia, for Mendizabal, the\r\nofficer who was supposed to exercise authority over all the bands of\r\nCantabria and Biscay. These scattered forces consisted in the more\r\nor less organized brigades of Porlier in the Eastern Asturias, and\r\nLonga in Cantabria--both of which were reckoned part of the national\r\narmy--and in addition of the guerrilleros of Jauregui [’El Pastor’] in\r\nGuipuzcoa, Renovales in Biscay, Marquinez, Saornil, the Curé Merino,\r\nand others in the mountains between the Douro and the sea. These\r\nwere bands of varying strength, often scattered by the French, but\r\nalways reassembled after a space, who roamed from region to region\r\naccording as the enemy was stronger or weaker at one point or another.\r\nOccasionally Mendizabal was in touch with Mina and the Navarrese, but\r\ngenerally the French were in too great force about the high-road from\r\nBurgos to Pampeluna to make co-operation practicable.\r\n\r\n  [715] The _Venerable_ (his flag-ship) and the _Magnificent_. The\r\n  _Magnificent_ went home with prisoners some weeks later, and\r\n  was replaced for a time by the _Abercrombie_, from the Brest\r\n  blockading squadron.\r\n\r\n  [716] _Medusa_, _Isis_, _Diadem_, _Surveillante_, and _Rhin_. The\r\n  _Belle Poule_ looked in for a short time later in the season.\r\n\r\n  [717] _Sparrow_ and _Lyra_.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of Popham’s start matters were exceptionally favourable\r\nalong the Biscay coast, because Bonnet was just evacuating the\r\nAsturias, in order to join his chief Marmont in the plains of Leon.\r\nHis departure isolated Santoña and Santander, which had been the links\r\nby which he was joined to Caffarelli’s army. It also gave Porlier and\r\nLonga an open communication with Galicia, from which they had hitherto\r\nbeen cut off by Bonnet’s presence in Asturias, and a safe retreat\r\nthitherward if they should be pressed. In addition Marmont had called\r\nup all the small garrisons and detached columns from his rear, for\r\nthe main struggle with Wellington; so that the Upper Douro valley and\r\nthe Soria country were much more free from the French than they had\r\nbeen for a long time. The opportunity for molesting Caffarelli and his\r\nmuch-scattered Army of the North was unique.\r\n\r\nThe idea which lay at the back of Popham’s plan was that a fleet\r\nfurnished with the heaviest ship guns, and with a landing-force of\r\nover 1,000 men, could operate at its choice against any one of the\r\nlong chain of posts which the French held, calling in to its aid the\r\nlocal bands in each case. The insurgents had never been able to capture\r\nany of these places because they lacked a battering-train. The fleet\r\nsupplied this want, and with few exceptions the French strongholds\r\nwere not suited for resistance against heavy guns. They were mediaeval\r\ncastles, fortified convents, or the patched-up walls of little towns,\r\nall defensible against irregular bands without cannon, but most\r\nvulnerable to 18-or 24-pounders. The number of the French garrisons\r\ngave ample liberty of choice between one and another: individually\r\nthey were generally weak--not over 300, 500, or 1,000 men. There were\r\nsuccouring columns, no doubt, ready to relieve them, at Bayonne and\r\nVittoria and elsewhere. But the squadron had the power of misleading\r\nthese forces to any extent--of drawing them from one remote port to\r\nanother by false attacks and demonstrations, and then of attacking\r\nsome third point when the enemy had been lured as far as possible\r\nfrom it. Here lay the beauty of naval operations--the squadron could\r\nappear to threaten any objective that it chose, could attract the enemy\r\nthither, and then could vanish, and be fifty miles away next day. The\r\nrelieving column could only follow slowly over mountain roads, and\r\nwould invariably be late in learning what new direction the squadron\r\nhad taken. It was something like the advantage that the Danes had in\r\ntheir attacks on England in the ninth century: a defending army cannot\r\nguard all points of a coast-line at once against a movable landing\r\nforce on shipboard. The weaker points of the scheme were, firstly, the\r\ndependence of all operations on fine weather--contrary winds could in\r\nthose days delay a fleet for whole weeks on end; secondly, the want of\r\na base nearer than Corunna, till some good and defensible haven should\r\nhave been captured; and third and greatest of all, the difficulty of\r\ninducing the local chiefs to combine: they paid a very limited amount\r\nof obedience to their nominal chief, Mendizabal: they had private\r\ngrievances and jealousies against each other: and each of them disliked\r\nmoving far from the particular region where his men were raised, and\r\nwhere every inch of the mountain roads was known to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, all these dangers were known and were chanced, and the game\r\nwas well worth the risk. The operations began with the appearance of\r\nthe squadron before Lequeitio on June 21st. Popham landed a heavy\r\ngun and some marines, and the band of El Pastor [’Don Gaspar’ as\r\nthe English dispatches call him] appeared to co-operate from the\r\ninland. The defences consisted of a fort and a fortified convent:\r\nthe 24-pounder breached the former, which was then stormed by the\r\nguerrilleros in a very handsome fashion[718]: its garrison was slain or\r\ncaptured. The gun was then brought up against the fortified convent,\r\nwhose commander, the _chef de bataillon_ Gillort, surrendered without\r\nfurther fighting; the prisoners amounted to 290 men, a half-battalion\r\nof the 119th regiment (June 22). Popham then moved off to Bermeo and\r\nPlencia, both of which the French evacuated in haste, leaving guns\r\nunspiked and some useful stores of provisions. The British force had\r\nset the wildest rumours abroad, and Renovales, the Spanish commander\r\nin Biscay, appeared at Orduna with his bands and threatened Bilbao, the\r\ncapital of the province. It was these reports which made Caffarelli\r\nsuddenly break off his project for sending reinforcements to Marmont,\r\nand prepare rather to march northward when he was most wanted on the\r\nDouro[719].\r\n\r\n  [718] So says Popham in his dispatch at the Record Office: though\r\n  Napier (iv. p. 246) says that the Spaniards attacked and were\r\n  repulsed. But Popham must have known best! Sir Howard Douglas\r\n  corroborates him, _Life_, p. 168.\r\n\r\n  [719] See above, p. 378.\r\n\r\nPopham’s next blow was at Guetaria, a most important post, owing to\r\nits nearness to the great _chaussée_ leading to Bayonne, which passes\r\nquite close to it between Tolosa and Ernani. If it had fallen, the main\r\nroad from France to Spain would have been blocked for all practical\r\npurposes. But being far to the East and near the French border, it was\r\nremote from the haunts of the guerrilleros: few of them turned up:\r\nafter a few days Popham had to re-embark guns and men, and to take his\r\ndeparture, owing to the arrival in his neighbourhood of a strong French\r\nflying column. He then sailed off to Castro Urdiales, where he had much\r\nbetter luck: Longa had left the Upper Ebro with his brigade and joined\r\nhim there on July 6th, by Mendizabal’s orders. Their united force drove\r\noff on the 7th a small French column which came up from Laredo to raise\r\nthe siege. The governor of Castro then surrendered with some 150 men,\r\nand 20 guns on his walls fell into Popham’s hands (July 8). The place\r\nseemed so strong that the commodore resolved to keep it as a temporary\r\nbase, and garrisoned it with some of his marines.\r\n\r\nThree days later Popham appeared before Portugalete, the fortified\r\nvillage at the mouth of the Bilbao river, and bombarded it from the\r\nside of the sea, while Longa (who had marched parallel with the\r\nsquadron along the shore), demonstrated against its rear. But a French\r\nflying column happened just to have arrived at Bilbao, and the force\r\nwhich marched out against the assailants was so powerful that they\r\nmade off, each on his own element [July 11th.] Popham now turned his\r\nattention for a second time to the important strategical post of\r\nGuetaria; he had enlisted the support of the Guipuzcoan bands under\r\nJauregui, and the distant Mina had promised to send a battalion to his\r\naid from Navarre. Popham got heavy guns on shore, and began to batter\r\nthe place, while Jauregui blockaded it on the land side. This move\r\ndrew the attention of D’Aussenac, commanding the flying column which\r\nbelonged to the Bayonne reserve: he marched with 3,000 men towards\r\nGuetaria, and drove off Jauregui, whereupon Popham had to re-embark in\r\nhaste, and lost two guns which could not be got off in time and thirty\r\nmen [July 19], Mina’s battalion came up a day too late to help the\r\ndiscomfited besiegers.\r\n\r\nThis petty disaster was in the end more favourable than harmful\r\nto Popham’s general plan, for he had succeeded in drawing all\r\nthe attention of the French to the eastern end of their chain of\r\ncoast-fortresses, between Santoña and San Sebastian. But now he used\r\nhis power of rapid movement to attack unexpectedly their most important\r\nwestern stronghold. On July 22nd he appeared in front of the harbour of\r\nSantander, while (by previous arrangement) Campillo--one of Porlier’s\r\nlieutenants--invested it on the land side. Porlier himself, with his\r\nmain body, was blockading at the moment the not very distant and still\r\nstronger Santoña.\r\n\r\nThere was very heavy fighting round Santander between the 22nd July\r\nand August 2. Popham landed guns on the water-girt rock of Mouro, and\r\nbombarded from it the castle at the mouth of the port: when its fire\r\nwas subdued, he ran his squadron in battle order past it, and entered\r\nthe harbour, receiving little damage from the other French works (July\r\n24). The enemy then evacuated the castle, which the marines occupied:\r\nbut an attempt to storm the town with the aid of Campillo’s men failed,\r\nwith a rather heavy casualty list of two British captains[720] and many\r\nmarines and seamen disabled (July 27th). However, Popham and Campillo\r\nheld on in front of Santander, and Mendizabal came up on August 2nd\r\nto join them, bringing a captured French dispatch, which proved that\r\nthe enemy intended to evacuate the place, a strong relieving column\r\nunder Caffarelli himself being at hand to bring off the garrison. And\r\nthis indeed happened: the General-in-Chief of the Army of the North\r\nhad marched with all the disposable troops at Vittoria to save his\r\ndetachment. The governor Dubreton--the same man who afterwards defended\r\nBurgos so well--broke out of the place with his 1,600 men on the night\r\nof the 2nd-3rd and joined his chief in safety: he left eighteen guns\r\nspiked in his works. Caffarelli then drew off the garrison of the\r\nneighbouring small post of Torrelavega, but threw a convoy and some\r\nreinforcements into Santoña, which he had determined to hold as long as\r\npossible. He then hastened back to Vittoria, being under the impression\r\nat the moment that Wellington was in march against him from Valladolid,\r\nin pursuit of the routed host of Clausel. But the Anglo-Portuguese main\r\narmy--as will be remembered--had really followed the retreating French\r\nno farther than Valladolid, and no longer than the 30th July. Instead\r\nof finding himself involved in the affairs of the Army of Portugal,\r\nCaffarelli had soon another problem in hand.\r\n\r\n  [720] One of them, Sir George Collier, commanding the _Medusa_.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Santander by the allies was the most important event\r\nthat had happened on the north coast of Spain since 1809, for it gave\r\nthe squadron of Popham possession of the sole really good harbor--open\r\nto the largest ships, and safe at all times of the year--which lies\r\nbetween Ferrol and the French frontier. At last the Spanish ‘Seventh\r\nArmy’ had a base behind it, and a free communication with England for\r\nthe stores and munitions that it so much needed. It might be developed\r\ninto a formidable force if so strengthened, and it lay in a position\r\nmost inconvenient for the French, directly in the rear of Clausel and\r\nCaffarelli. Popham saw what might be made of Santander, and drew up for\r\nWellington’s benefit a report on the possibilities of the harbour, in\r\nwhich he details, from the information given by Porlier and his staff,\r\nthe state of the roads between it and Burgos, Valladolid, and other\r\npoints. Six weeks before the siege of Burgos began, he wrote that by\r\nall accounts six or eight heavy guns would be required to take that\r\nfortress, and that he could manage that they should be got there--a\r\ndistance of 115 miles--by ox-draught, if they were wanted[721]. But\r\nWellington, at the moment that this useful information was being\r\ncompiled, was turning away from Valladolid and Burgos toward Madrid;\r\nand when his attention was once more drawn back to Burgos, he made no\r\nuse of Popham’s offers till it was too late. Of this more in its proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n  [721] Popham’s prescience is shown by the fact that his papers\r\n  relating to Burgos began to be drawn up as early as July 26. He\r\n  cross-questioned not only Porlier but other Spanish officers.\r\n  Their answers did not always tally with each other. See all\r\n  Popham’s dispatches of the time, in the Admiralty Section at the\r\n  Record Office--under the general head ‘Channel Fleet!’ They have\r\n  this misleading heading because Popham was under Lord Keith, then\r\n  commanding that fleet.\r\n\r\nHaving brought all his squadron into Santander, and made himself a\r\nfixed base in addition to his floating one, Popham began to concert\r\nplans for further operations with Mendizabal, whom he described as\r\na man of ‘vacillating councils,’ and hard to screw up to any fixed\r\nresolution. The scheme which the commodore most recommended to the\r\ngeneral was one for a general concentration of all his scattered forces\r\nagainst Bilbao, in which the squadron should give its best help. But\r\nhe suggested as an alternative the sending of Porlier to join Longa,\r\nwho had already gone south to the Upper Ebro after the failure at\r\nPortugalete on July 11th. Porlier and Longa would together be strong\r\nenough to cut the road between Burgos and Vittoria, and so divide\r\nClausel from Caffarelli. If the two French generals combined against\r\nthem, they could always escape north-westward into their usual mountain\r\nrefuges.\r\n\r\nAccording to Popham’s notes Mendizabal first seemed to incline to the\r\nsecond scheme, and then decided for the first. He even in the end\r\nordered up Longa--then very usefully employed against Clausel’s rear\r\nabout Pancorbo and Cubo--to join in the attack upon Bilbao. But Longa\r\ncame late, being busy in operations that he liked better than those\r\nwhich his chief imposed on him. After waiting a few days for him in\r\nvain, Mendizabal marched against Bilbao by land with two battalions\r\nbelonging to Porlier and one recently raised in Alava, while Popham\r\ntook three Biscayan battalions belonging to Renovales on board his\r\nsquadron and sailed for Lequeitio, where he put them ashore. He himself\r\nthen made for Portugalete, at the mouth of the Bilbao river. The triple\r\nattack, though made with no very great total force was successful.\r\nThe officer commanding in Bilbao, went out to meet Mendizabal, and in\r\norder to collect as many men as possible, drew off the garrison of\r\nPortugalete. The British squadron, arriving in front of the port, found\r\nit undefended and threw the marines ashore. Hearing of this descent in\r\nhis rear the French general, then indecisively engaged with Mendizabal\r\nand Renovales, thought that he was in danger of being surrounded, and\r\nretired hastily toward Durango, abandoning Bilbao altogether [August\r\n13].\r\n\r\nLearning next day that they had overrated the enemy’s force, the\r\nFrench returned and tried to reoccupy the Biscayan capital, but were\r\nmet outside by all Mendizabal’s troops, arrayed on the position of\r\nOllorgan. An attack entirely failed to move them, and the French\r\nfell back to Durango. General Rouget, the commanding officer in the\r\nprovince, then drew in all his minor garrisons, and sent Caffarelli\r\nnotice that all Biscay was lost, unless something could be done at\r\nonce to check Mendizabal’s progress [August 14]. Indeed the situation\r\nlooked most threatening, for Longa had at last come up and joined his\r\nchief with 3,000 men, and the Biscayans were taking arms on every side.\r\nA general junta of the Basque provinces was summoned by Mendizabal to\r\nmeet at Bilbao, and the French had for the moment no foothold left save\r\nin San Sebastian and Guetaria. Thereupon Caffarelli, collecting every\r\nman that he could at Vittoria, marched to join Rouget. Their united\r\nforces, making some 7,000 men, attacked Bilbao on August 27th-29th,\r\nand after much confused fighting drove Mendizabal and Longa out of\r\nthe place, only a fortnight after it had come into Spanish hands. The\r\ndefeated troops dispersed in all directions, each section seeking the\r\nregion that it had come from--Porlier’s men retired towards Cantabria,\r\nLonga’s toward the Upper Ebro. Renovales and his Biscayan battalions\r\nwere caught in their retreat, and badly cut up at Dima.\r\n\r\nWhile this fighting was going on around Bilbao, Popham was trying a\r\nlast attack on Guetaria, with his own resources only, as nearly all the\r\nSpaniards were engaged elsewhere. He had accomplished nothing decisive\r\nwhen he heard of Mendizabal’s defeat, and had to reship his guns and\r\ntake his departure before the victorious Caffarelli came up. He retired\r\nto Santander, and heard there that Wellington was leaving Madrid, and\r\nonce more marching on Burgos. He determined to open up communications\r\nwith the British army without delay, and on August 31 sent off\r\nLieutenant Macfarlane to seek for the head of the approaching columns.\r\nThat officer, skirting the flank of Clausel’s retreating host, reached\r\nValladolid betimes, and explained to Wellington that the Santander road\r\nwould be open and available for the transport of ammunition, guns, and\r\neven food, so soon as he should have driven the French past Burgos.\r\nAnd--as will be seen--it was so used during the unlucky siege of that\r\nfortress again and again--but not (as Popham recommended) for the\r\nbringing up of the heavy artillery that Wellington so much lacked.\r\n\r\nBy September 1st Caffarelli had patched up matters for a time on the\r\nside of Biscay, but though he had recovered Bilbao and preserved\r\nGuetaria, all the other coast-towns were out of his power save Santoña,\r\nand that important place was cut off from the nearest French garrison\r\nby a gap of some sixty miles. Even now Popham’s useful diversion had\r\nnot ceased to have its effect. But its further working belongs to a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\nSo much for the annals of the war in northern Spain from June\r\nto August. The diversion which Wellington had planned had been\r\nbrilliantly successful. A very different story must be told of the\r\nequally important scheme that he had concerted for keeping his enemies\r\ndistracted on the eastern side of the Peninsula, by means of the\r\nAnglo-Sicilian expedition and the Spanish Army of Murcia.\r\n\r\nSuchet, it will be remembered[722], had been stayed from further\r\nconquests after the fall of Valencia partly by the indirect results\r\nof Wellington’s operations on the Portuguese frontier--starting with\r\nthe fall of Ciudad Rodrigo--partly by Napoleon’s action in drawing\r\nback to the Ebro the two divisions of Reille, and calling out of Spain\r\nthe numerous Polish battalions serving in the Army of Aragon. But\r\nnot the least of the hindering causes was a purely personal one--the\r\nlong illness which kept Suchet confined to his bed for ten weeks in\r\nFebruary, March, and April. By the time that he was in the saddle again\r\na notable change had come over the aspect of the war all over the\r\nPeninsula. During his sickness his lieutenants, Habert and Harispe,\r\nmaintained their position in front of the Xucar river, and observed\r\nthe wrecks of the Valencian and Murcian divisions that had escaped\r\nfrom Blake’s disaster in January. The whole force remaining under\r\nSuchet--excluding the troops left behind in Catalonia and Aragon--was\r\nnot above 15,000 men, and of these nearly 4,000 were locked up in\r\ngarrisons, at Valencia, Saguntum, Peniscola, Morella, and other places.\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that no farther advance was made\r\nagainst the Spaniards. Joseph O’Donnell, the successor of the unlucky\r\nMahy, was able during the spring to reorganize some 12,000 men on the\r\n_cadres_ of his old battalions. In addition he had Roche’s reserve at\r\nAlicante, 4,000 strong, which had now been profiting for many months\r\nby the British subsidy and training, and was reckoned a solid corps.\r\nHe had also Bassecourt’s few battalions in the inland--the troops\r\nthat D’Armagnac had hunted in December and January in the district\r\nabout Requeña[723]. Cartagena, the only fortress on the coast still\r\nin Spanish hands save Alicante, had been strengthened by the arrival\r\nof a British detachment[724]. Altogether there were some 20,000\r\nenemies facing Suchet in April, and he regarded it as impossible to\r\nthink of attacking Alicante, since he had not nearly enough men in\r\nhand to besiege a place of considerable size, and at the same time\r\nto provide a sufficient covering army against Joseph O’Donnell. So\r\nlittle was the Murcian army molested that General Freire, O’Donnell’s\r\nsecond-in-command, ignoring Suchet altogether, took advantage of\r\nSoult’s absence in Estremadura, at the time of the fall of Badajoz,\r\nto alarm eastern Andalusia. He occupied Baza on April 18th, and when\r\ndriven away after a time by Leval, governor of Granada, turned instead\r\nagainst the coast-land of the South. On May 11th an expedition, aided\r\nby English war-ships from Alicante, landed near Almeria, and cleared\r\nout all the French garrisons from the small towns and shore batteries\r\nas far west as Almunecar. Already before this (on May 1-3) an English\r\nsquadron had made a descent on Malaga, seized and destroyed the\r\nharbour-works, and carried off some privateers and merchant vessels\r\nfrom the port. But naught could be accomplished against the citadel\r\nof Gibalfaro. Soult did little or nothing to resent these insults,\r\nbecause he was at the time obsessed with his ever-recurring idea\r\nthat Wellington was about to invade Andalusia, and his attention was\r\nentirely taken up with the movements of Hill and Ballasteros in the\r\nWest and North, so that the East was neglected. Leval at Granada had a\r\ntroublesome time, but was in no real danger, since Freire’s raids were\r\nexecuted with a trifling force.\r\n\r\n  [722] See above, p. 86.\r\n\r\n  [723] See above, p. 56.\r\n\r\n  [724] The 2/67th and a part of the foreign Regiment of de\r\n  Watteville, also a British battery, from Cadiz.\r\n\r\nSuchet was occupied at this time more with civil than with military\r\naffairs: for some time after his convalescence he was engaged in\r\nrearranging the administration of the kingdom of Valencia, and in\r\nraising the enormous war-contribution which Napoleon had directed him\r\nto exact--200,000,000 reals, or £2,800,000--in addition to the ordinary\r\ntaxes. The Marshal in his _Mémoires_ gives a most self-laudatory\r\naccount of his rule; according to his rose-coloured narrative[725],\r\nthe imposts were raised with wisdom and benevolence, the population\r\nbecame contented and even loyal, the roads were safe, and material\r\nprosperity commenced at once to revive. Napier has reproduced most of\r\nSuchet’s testimonials to his own wisdom and integrity, without any hint\r\nthat the Spanish version of the story is different. The Marshal who\r\ndrove the civil population of Lerida under the fire of the cannon[726],\r\nand who signalized his entry into Valencia by wholesale executions of\r\ncombatants and non-combatants[727], was not the benevolent being of\r\nhis own legend. Since that legend has been republished in many a later\r\nvolume, it may be well to give as a fair balance the version of an\r\nenemy--not of a Spaniard, but of a Prussian, that Colonel Schepeler\r\nwhose authority on the war of Valencia we have so often had occasion to\r\nquote.\r\n\r\n  [725] See _Mémoires_, ii. pp. 283-99.\r\n\r\n  [726] See vol. iii. p. 307.\r\n\r\n  [727] See above, p. 75.\r\n\r\n‘Napoleon Bonaparte looked upon Valencia as the prey of France, and\r\nSuchet did not fall behind in his oppressive high-handedness. The\r\nlong-desired goal, the wealthy city, now lay open to their rapacity,\r\nand the riches that the clergy had denied to the needs of the nation\r\nwent to fill the plunder-bag of the conqueror. The miraculous statue\r\nof Our Lady of Pity was stripped of her ancient jewelled robe: only\r\na light mantle now draped her, and showed the cut of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The silver apostles of the cathedral took their way to France\r\nwith many other objects of value, and the Chapter was forced to pay\r\nransom for hidden treasures. The magnanimous marshal imposed on the\r\nnew French province, as a sort of “benevolence,” six million dollars\r\n(ten had been spoken of at first), with an additional million for the\r\ncity of Valencia. The churches had to buy off their bells with another\r\n60,000 dollars. Suchet, in his moderation, contented himself with\r\nexacting 500 dollars a day for his own table and household expenses.\r\n\r\n‘Political persecution began with a decree of March 11, which ordered\r\nthe judges of the local _Audiencia_ [Law Court] to meet as before,\r\nbut to administer justice in the name of Napoleon _Empereur et Roi_.\r\nThe patriots refused to serve and fled; whereupon their goods were\r\nconfiscated, their families were harried, and when some of them\r\nwere captured they were threatened with penal servitude or death. A\r\ndecree drawn up in words of cold ferocity, declared every Spaniard\r\nwho continued to oppose the French to be a rebel and a brigand, and\r\ntherefore condemned to capital punishment. Several villages were\r\npunished with fire and sword, because they were too patriotic to\r\narrest and deliver up insurgents. Contrary to the promise made at the\r\ncapitulation in January[728], many patriots were arrested and executed,\r\nunder the pretence that they had been concerned in the murder of\r\nFrenchmen in 1808, even though they might actually have saved the lives\r\nof certain of those unfortunates at that time.\r\n\r\n  [728] See p. 73 above.\r\n\r\n‘Valencia produces little wheat: there was much lack of it, and the\r\nFrench would not accept rice. Their requisitions were exacted with\r\ncruel disregard of consequences, even from the poorest, and quickly\r\nbrought back to the patriotic side the mutable Valencian people, who\r\nhad already been sufficiently embittered when they found that they\r\nwere annexed to France. All over the province there began to appear\r\nslaughter, rebellion, and finally guerrillero bands[729].’\r\n\r\n  [729] Schepeler, pp. 609-10.\r\n\r\nThe point which Schepeler makes as to Valencia being practically\r\nannexed to France--as shown by the administration of justice in the\r\nname of Napoleon, not of King Joseph--should be noted. It illustrates\r\nSuchet’s determination to consider himself as a French viceroy, rather\r\nthan as the general of one of the armies recently placed by the\r\nEmperor under the King as Commander-in-Chief in the Peninsula. We have\r\nalready noted the way in which he contrived to plead special orders\r\nfrom Paris, exempting him from the royal control, whenever Joseph\r\ntried to borrow some of his troops for use against Wellington[730].\r\nAt the same time it must be conceded that he had a much better excuse\r\nthan Soult for his persistent disobedience to such orders--his whole\r\navailable force was so small, that if he had sent 6,000 men to San\r\nClemente or Ocaña, as Joseph directed, there would have been little or\r\nnothing left in Valencia save the garrisons, and the Spaniards from\r\nAlicante and Murcia could have taken their revenge for the disasters\r\nof the past winter[731]. He represented to the King that to draw off\r\nsuch a body of troops to La Mancha implied the abandonment of all his\r\nrecent conquests, and that if something had to be evacuated, it was\r\nbetter that Soult should begin the process, since Andalusia was a more\r\noutlying possession than Valencia--’les provinces du sud devaient\r\nêtre évacuées avant celles de l’est.’ And here he was no doubt right:\r\nas we have been remarking again and again, the only solution for the\r\nsituation created by Wellington’s successes was to concentrate a great\r\nmass of troops at all costs, and the Army of the South could best\r\nprovide that mass. It had 50,000 men under arms at the moment--Suchet\r\nhad not in Valencia more than 15,000.\r\n\r\n  [730] See above, pp. 304-5.\r\n\r\n  [731] This is Suchet’s own view, see his _Mémoires_, ii. p. 251.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken of those parts of the east coast of Spain\r\nwhich lie south of the Ebro. But if the situation in Valencia had not\r\naltered much between February and June, the same was also the case in\r\nCatalonia. Since Eroles’s victory over Bourke at Roda in March[732]\r\nthere had been much marching and counter-marching in that principality,\r\nbut nothing decisive. Lacy, the unpopular captain-general, was at\r\nodds with the Junta, and especially with Eroles, the best of his\r\ndivisional officers, who was the most influential man in Catalonia,\r\nowing to his local connexions and his untiring energy. Lacy was a\r\nstranger, an enemy of the ‘Somaten’ system, and a pronounced Liberal.\r\nThe political tendencies of the Catalans were distinctly favourable\r\nto the other or ‘Servile’ party. The captain-general was also accused\r\nof nourishing jealousy against Sarsfield, his second-in-command: and\r\nit is certain that both that officer and Eroles believed him capable\r\nof any mean trick toward them. But though divided counsels and mutual\r\nsuspicions often hindered the co-operation of the commanders and the\r\npeople, all were equally bitter enemies of the invader, and none of\r\nthem showed any signs of slackening in their grim resolve to hold\r\nout to the end. The Catalan army did not now count more than 8,000\r\nmen in the field, but its central position in the mountains of the\r\ninterior, round which the French garrisons were dispersed in a long\r\nsemicircle, gave it advantages that compensated to a certain extent for\r\nits lack of numbers. It could strike out at any isolated point on the\r\ncircumference, and, whether its blow failed or succeeded, generally\r\ngot off before the enemy had concentrated in sufficient numbers to do\r\nit much harm. On the other hand, Decaen, now commanding in Catalonia,\r\nand Maurice Mathieu, the governor of Barcelona, though they had some\r\nthree times as many men under arms as Lacy, were reduced to a position\r\nthat was little more than defensive. It is true that they occasionally\r\ncollected a heavy column and struck into the inland: but the enemy\r\navoided them, and replied by counter-attacks on depleted sections of\r\nthe French circle of garrisons. On April 9th, for example, 4,800 men\r\nmarched from Gerona against Olot: the local levies under Claros and\r\nRovira skirmished with them, giving ground, and finally losing the\r\ntown. But though they did not stop the advance of the enemy, Milans,\r\nwith a larger force, moved on the important harbour of Mataro, and laid\r\nsiege to the garrison there (April 22), a stroke which soon brought the\r\nbulk of French troops back from Olot to drive him off. At the same time\r\nSarsfield’s division pressed in upon the garrison of Tarragona, and cut\r\noff its communications with Barcelona.\r\n\r\n  [732] See above, p. 98.\r\n\r\nThis forced Decaen to march to open the road, with all the men that\r\nMaurice Mathieu could spare from Barcelona (April 28). Letting them go\r\nby, Lacy at once renewed the attack on Mataro, bringing up the forces\r\nof Sarsfield and Milans, and borrowing four ship-guns from Commodore\r\nCodrington to batter the fort, in which the French had taken refuge\r\nafter evacuating the town [May 3]. Decaen and Lamarque promptly turned\r\nback, and on the third day of the siege came hastily to break it up.\r\nThe Spaniards dispersed in various directions, after burying the guns,\r\nwhich (much to Codrington’s regret) were discovered and exhumed by the\r\nenemy. The net result of all this marching and counter-marching was\r\nthat much shoe-leather had been worn out, and a few hundred men killed\r\nor wounded on each side: but certainly no progress had been made in\r\nthe conquest of Catalonia. Indeed, Manso, at the end of the campaign,\r\nestablished himself at Molins de Rey, quite close to Barcelona, and\r\nSarsfield occupied Montserrat, so that between them they once more cut\r\noff the communications from Barcelona southward and westward. Both had\r\nto be driven off in June, in order that the roads might again be opened.\r\n\r\nEarly in July Lacy devised a scheme which made him more hated than ever\r\nin Catalonia. He concerted with some Spanish employés in the French\r\ncommissariat service a plan for blowing up the powder magazine of the\r\ngreat fortress of Lerida, and arranged to be outside its walls on the\r\nday fixed for the explosion, and to storm it during the confusion that\r\nwould follow. Eroles and Sarsfield both protested, pointing out that a\r\nwhole quarter of the city must be destroyed, with great loss of life.\r\nLacy replied that the results would justify the sacrifice, persisted\r\nin his scheme, and moved with every available man towards Lerida to be\r\nready on the appointed day. He miscalculated his hours, however; and,\r\nthough he left hundreds of stragglers behind from over-marching, his\r\ncolumn arrived too late. The explosion took place on the 16th, with\r\ndreadful success; not only did a hundred of the garrison perish, but a\r\nmuch larger number of the citizens; many houses and one of the bastions\r\nfell. The governor Henriod, a very firm-handed man whose record in\r\nLerida was most tyrannical[733], had been entirely unaware of the\r\napproach of the Spaniards, but proved equal to the occasion. He put his\r\ngarrison under arms, manned the breach, and showed such a firm front,\r\nwhen Lacy appeared, that the captain-general, having tired troops and\r\nno cannon, refused to attempt the storm. He went off as quickly as he\r\nhad come, having caused the death of several hundred of his countrymen\r\nwith no profit whatever. If he was ready to adopt such terrible means,\r\nhe should at least have had his plans correctly timed. The Catalans\r\nnever forgave him the useless atrocity[734].\r\n\r\n  [733] See notes in Vidal de la Blache’s _L’Evacuation d’Espagne_,\r\n  1914, which reaches me just as this goes to press, for anecdotes\r\n  concerning his doings.\r\n\r\n  [734] About the same time a still more dreadful plot was said\r\n  to have been formed in Barcelona, with the knowledge and\r\n  approval of Lacy--arsenic was to be mixed with the flour of the\r\n  garrison’s rations by secret agents. [See Suchet’s _Mémoires_,\r\n  ii. p. 256, and Arteche, xii. p. 353.] How far the plan was a\r\n  reality is difficult to decide. There is a large file of papers\r\n  in the Paris War Office concerning experiments carried out by a\r\n  commission of army-doctors, in consequence of a sudden outbreak\r\n  of sickness among the troops in July. One or two soldiers died,\r\n  a great number were seized with vomiting and stomach-cramps;\r\n  poison being suspected, the doctors took possession of the flour,\r\n  attempted to analyse it, and tried its effects on a number of\r\n  street dogs. A few of the animals died: most were violently sick,\r\n  but got over the dose. Poison was not definitely proved, and\r\n  dirty utensils and bad baking might conceivably have been the\r\n  cause of the outbreak. Some Catalan writers say that there was a\r\n  poisoning-plot, or I should have doubted the whole story. See the\r\n  Appendix to Arteche, xii. p. 483.\r\n\r\nOperations in Catalonia and Valencia were thus dragging on with no\r\ngreat profit to one side or the other, when Wellington’s great scheme\r\nfor the Anglo-Sicilian diversion on the east coast began at last to\r\nwork, and--as he had expected--set a new face to affairs. Unfortunately\r\nthe expedition was conducted very differently from his desire. We have\r\nalready shown how, by Lord William Bentinck’s perversity, it started\r\ntoo late, and was far weaker than was originally intended[735]. But on\r\nJuly 15th General Maitland arrived at Port Mahon with a fleet carrying\r\nthree English[736] and two German battalions, and parts of three\r\nforeign regiments, with a handful of cavalry, and two companies of\r\nartillery. He sent messengers across Spain to announce to Wellington\r\nhis arrival, and his purpose of landing in Catalonia, as had been\r\ndirected. At Majorca he picked up Whittingham’s newly-organized\r\nBalearic division, and after some delay he set sail on July 28 for\r\nPalamos, a central point on the Catalan coast, off which he arrived on\r\nthe morning of July 31st with over 10,000 men on board.\r\n\r\n  [735] See above, p. 347.\r\n\r\n  [736] 1/10th, 1/81st, 1/58th, 4th and 6th Line battalions K.G.L.,\r\n  and parts of the foreign battalions of De Roll, Dillon, and the\r\n  Calabrian Free Corps. See table in Appendix XIV. The total was\r\n  248 officers, and 6,643 rank and file.\r\n\r\nOwing to Bentinck’s unhappy hesitation in May and June, after the\r\nexpedition had been announced and the troops ordered to prepare for\r\nembarkation, French spies in Sicily had found the time to send warning\r\nto Paris, and Suchet had been advised by the Minister of War that a\r\nfleet from Palermo might appear in his neighbourhood at any moment.\r\nHe received his warning in the end of June, a month before Maitland’s\r\narrival[737], and this turned out in the end profitable to the allied\r\ncause; for, though the fleet never appeared, he was always expecting\r\nit, and used the argument that he was about to be attacked by an\r\nEnglish force as his most effective reply to King Joseph’s constant\r\ndemands for assistance in New Castile. The arrival at Alicante of\r\ntransports intended to carry Roche’s division to Catalonia, and of some\r\nvessels bearing the battering-train which Wellington had sent round for\r\nBentinck’s use, was duly reported to him: for some time he took this\r\nflotilla to be the Anglo-Sicilian squadron. Hence he was expecting all\r\nthrough June and July the attack which (through Bentinck’s perversity)\r\nwas never delivered. The threat proved as effective as the actual\r\ndescent might have been, and Wellington would have been much relieved\r\nif only he could have seen a few of Suchet’s many letters refusing to\r\nmove a man to support the King[738].\r\n\r\n  [737] Clarke’s dispatch with the information was dated June 9th.\r\n\r\n  [738] Two of them dated July 22 and August 12 did ultimately fall\r\n  into his hands, but only after the victory of Salamanca. See\r\n  below, pp. 617-18.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s great trouble was that he could not tell in the least whether\r\nthe Sicilian expedition would land in Catalonia or in Valencia. It\r\nmight come ashore anywhere between Alicante and Rosas. He prepared a\r\nsmall movable central reserve, with which he could march northward if\r\nthe blow should fall between Valencia and Tortosa, or southward--to\r\nreinforce Habert and Harispe--if it should be struck in the South.\r\nDecaen was warned to have a strong force concentrated in central\r\nCatalonia, in case the descent came in his direction, and Suchet\r\npromised him such assistance as he could spare. On a rumour that the\r\nSicilian fleet had turned northward--as a matter of fact it was not\r\nyet in Spanish waters--the Marshal thought it worth while to make a\r\nrapid visit to Catalonia, to concert matters with Decaen. He marched\r\nby Tortosa with a flying column, and on July 10th met Decaen at Reus.\r\nHere he learned that there were no signs of the enemy to be discovered,\r\nand after visiting Tarragona, inspecting its fortifications, and\r\nreinforcing its garrison, returned southward in a more leisurely\r\nfashion than he had gone forth.\r\n\r\nDuring Suchet’s absence from his Valencian viceroyalty the\r\ncaptain-general of Murcia took measures which brought about one of\r\nthe most needless and gratuitous disasters that ever befell the\r\never-unlucky army of which he was in charge. Joseph O’Donnell knew\r\nthat the Sicilian expedition was due, and he had been warned that\r\nRoche’s division would be taken off to join it; he was aware that\r\nMaitland’s arrival would modify all Suchet’s arrangements, and would\r\nforce him to draw troops away from his own front. He had been requested\r\nby Wellington to content himself with ‘containing’ the French force\r\nin his front, and to risk nothing. But on July 18th he marched out\r\nfrom his positions in front of Alicante with the design of surprising\r\nGeneral Harispe. He knew that Suchet had gone north, and was not aware\r\nof his return; and he had been informed, quite truly, that Harispe’s\r\ncantonments were much scattered. Unfortunately he was as incapable as\r\nhe was presumptuous, and he entirely lacked the fiery determination of\r\nhis brother Henry, the hero of La Bispal. According to contemporary\r\ncritics he was set, at this moment, on making what he thought would be\r\na brilliant descent on an unprepared enemy, without any reference to\r\nhis orders or to the general state of the war[739]. And he wished to\r\nfight before Roche’s troops were taken from him, as they must soon be.\r\n\r\n  [739] See Schepeler, pp. 617 and 623.\r\n\r\nHarispe had only some 5,000 men--his own division, with one stray\r\nbattalion belonging to Habert[740], and Delort’s cavalry brigade[741].\r\nHe had one infantry regiment in reserve at Alcoy[742], another at\r\nIbi[743], the third[744]--with the bulk of Delort’s horsemen--in\r\nand about Castalla, the nearest point in the French cantonments to\r\nAlicante. O’Donnell’s ambitious plan was to surround the troops in\r\nCastalla and Ibi by a concentric movement of several columns marching\r\nfar apart, and to destroy them before Harispe himself could come up\r\nwith his reserve from the rear. Bassecourt and his detachment from the\r\nnorthern hills was ordered to fall in at the same time on Alcoy, so as\r\nto distract Harispe and keep him engaged--a doubtful expedient since\r\nhe lay many marches away, and it was obvious that the timing of his\r\ndiversion would probably miscarry.\r\n\r\n  [740] Of the 44th Line.\r\n\r\n  [741] The 13th Cuirassiers and 24th Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [742] The 116th Line, 2 battalions.\r\n\r\n  [743] The 1st Léger, 3 battalions.\r\n\r\n  [744] The 7th Line, 2 battalions.\r\n\r\nO’Donnell marched in three masses: on the right Roche’s division went\r\nby Xixona with the order to surprise the French troops in Ibi. The\r\nmain body, three weak infantry brigades under Montijo, Mijares, and\r\nMichelena, with two squadrons of cavalry and a battery, moved straight\r\nupon Castalla. The main body of the horse, about 800 strong, under\r\nGeneral Santesteban, went out on the left on the side of Villena,\r\nwith orders to outflank the enemy and try to cut in upon his rear.\r\nThe whole force made up 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, not taking\r\ninto account the possible (but unlikely) advent of Bassecourt, so that\r\nHarispe was outnumbered by much more than two to one. As an extra\r\nprecaution all the transports ready in Alicante were sent out--with\r\nonly one battalion on board--along the coast, to demonstrate opposite\r\nDenia and the mouth of the Xucar, in order to call off the attention of\r\nHabert’s division, which lay in that direction.\r\n\r\nHaving marched all night on the 20th July, the Spanish columns found\r\nthemselves--in a very fatigued condition--in front of the enemy at\r\nfour o’clock on the morning of the 21st. They were out of touch with\r\neach other, Roche being separated from the centre by the mountain-spur\r\ncalled the Sierra de Cata, and the cavalry having been sent very far\r\nout on the flank. General Mesclop was opposed to Roche at Ibi, with\r\nfour battalions and a squadron of cuirassiers--General Delort, at\r\nCastalla, had only one squadron of the cuirassiers, two battalions, and\r\na battery, but was expecting the arrival of the 24th Dragoons from the\r\nneighbouring town of Biar, some way to his right, and of the remaining\r\ntwo squadrons of the 13th Cuirassiers from Onil on his left. Meanwhile\r\nhe evacuated Castalla, but took up a position on a hillside covered by\r\na stream and a ravine crossed by a narrow bridge, with his trifling\r\nforce. He had already sent orders to Mesclop at Ibi to come in to his\r\naid, leaving only a rearguard to hold off as long as possible the\r\nSpanish column in front of him. The latter did as he was bid; he threw\r\ninto the Castle of Ibi a company of the 44th and two guns, and left the\r\nrest of that battalion and a troop of cuirassiers to support them. With\r\nthe rest of his force, the three battalions of the 1st Léger and the\r\nremaining troop of cuirassiers, he set off in haste for Castalla.\r\n\r\nO’Donnell assailed Delort in a very leisurely way after occupying the\r\ntown of Castalla--his troops were tired, and four of his six guns had\r\nfallen behind. But Montijo’s brigade and the two pieces which had kept\r\nup with it were developing an attack on the bridge, and Michelena and\r\nMijares had passed the ravine higher up, when the French detached\r\ntroops began to appear from all directions. The first to get up were\r\nthe 400 men of the 24th Dragoons, who--screened by an olive wood--came\r\nin with a tremendous impact, and quite unforeseen, upon Mijares’s\r\nflank, and completely broke up his three battalions. They then, after\r\nre-forming their ranks, formed in column and charged across the narrow\r\nbridge in front of O’Donnell’s centre, though it was commanded by\r\nhis two guns. An attack delivered across such a defile, passable by\r\nonly two horses abreast, looked like madness--but was successful! The\r\nguns only fired one round each before they were ridden over, and the\r\nbrigade supporting them broke up. Delort then attacked, with his two\r\nbattalions and with the cuirassiers who had just come up from Onil.\r\nMontijo’s brigade, the only intact Spanish unit left, was thus driven\r\nfrom the field and scattered. The 6,000 infantry of O’Donnell’s centre\r\nbecame a mass of fugitives--only one regiment out of the whole[745]\r\nkept its ranks and went off in decent order. Of the rest nearly half\r\nwere hunted down and captured in droves by the French cuirassiers\r\nand dragoons. Mesclop with the three battalions from Ibi arrived too\r\nlate to take any part in the rout. Delort sent him back at once to\r\nrelieve the detachment that he had left in front of Roche. The latter\r\nhad driven it out of the village of Ibi after some skirmishing, when\r\nhe saw approaching him not only Mesclop’s column, but Harispe coming\r\nup from Alcoy with the 116th of the Line. He at once halted, turned\r\nto the rear, and retired in good order towards Xixona: the enemy’s\r\ncavalry tried to break his rearguard but failed, and the whole\r\ndivision got back to Alicante without loss. The same chance happened\r\nto Santesteban’s cavalry, which, marching from Villena at 7 o’clock,\r\nhad reached Biar, in the enemy’s rear, only when the fighting--which\r\nhad begun at 4--was all over. O’Donnell tried to throw blame on this\r\nofficer; but the fact seems to be that his own calculation of time\r\nand distance was faulty: he had sent his cavalry on too wide a sweep,\r\nseparated by hills from his main body, and had kept up no proper\r\ncommunication with it. Nor does it appear that if Santesteban had come\r\nup to Biar a little earlier he would have been able to accomplish\r\nanything very essential. Bassecourt’s diversion, as might have been\r\nexpected, did not work: before he got near Alcoy the main body had been\r\ncut to pieces: he retired in haste to Almanza on hearing the news.\r\n\r\n  [745] Cuenca, of Montijo’s brigade. Schepeler, p. 619.\r\n\r\nO’Donnell’s infantry was so shattered that his army was reduced to as\r\nbad a condition as it had shown in January, after Blake’s original\r\ndisaster at Valencia. He had lost over 3,000 men, of whom 2,135 were\r\nunwounded prisoners, three flags, and the only two guns that had got\r\nto the front. The survivors of the three broken brigades had dispersed\r\nall over the countryside, and took weeks to collect. It was fortunate\r\nthat Roche’s division had reached Alicante intact, or that city itself\r\nmight have been in danger. The French had lost, according to their own\r\naccount, no more than 200 men[746]: only the two cavalry regiments,\r\ntwo battalions of the 7th Line, and one of the 44th had been put into\r\naction. As Suchet truly remarks in his _Mémoires_[747] the total\r\nnumbers engaged--3,000 men[748]--on his side were somewhat less than\r\nthe casualty list of the enemy.\r\n\r\n  [746] This is the figure given by Suchet in his contemporary\r\n  dispatch to King Joseph, of which a copy lies in the Scovell\r\n  papers. In some French accounts the number is cut down to 70.\r\n\r\n  [747] Vol. ii. p. 260.\r\n\r\n  [748] 7th Line, about 1,200; 13th Cuirassiers and 24th Dragoons,\r\n  about 1,000; one battalion 44th, about 650; artillery, &c., about\r\n  150 = 3,000 in all. The 1st Léger and 116th Line were practically\r\n  not engaged.\r\n\r\nThe rout of Castalla put the Murcian army out of action for months--a\r\nlucky thing for Suchet, since the force of the allies at Alicante\r\nwas just about to be increased by the arrival there of Maitland’s\r\nexpedition, and if O’Donnell’s army had been still intact, a very\r\nformidable body of troops would have been collected opposite him.\r\nIt remains to explain the appearance of the Anglo-Sicilians in this\r\ndirection, contrary to the orders of Wellington, who had expressed his\r\nwish that they should land in Catalonia, join Lacy, and lay siege to\r\nTarragona--an operation which he thought would force Suchet to evacuate\r\nValencia altogether, in order to bring help to Decaen.\r\n\r\nWe left Maitland anchored in the Bay of Palamos on July 31. The moment\r\nthat he appeared Eroles went on board his ship, to urge his immediate\r\ndisembarkation, and to promise the enthusiastic assistance of the\r\nCatalans. The energetic baron gave a most optimistic picture of the\r\nstate of affairs, he declared that the whole country would rise at the\r\nsight of the red-coats, that Tarragona was weakly held, and that the\r\ntotal force of the French, including Suchet’s column near Tortosa, was\r\nonly 13,000 men. Lacy and Sarsfield appeared later, and gave much less\r\nencouraging information: they rated the enemy at a far higher figure\r\nthan Eroles, and were right in so doing, for Decaen had some 25,000\r\nmen, and could by an effort have concentrated 15,000, exclusive of\r\nsuccours from Suchet. The Spanish Army of Catalonia could only furnish\r\n7,000 foot and 300 horse, of whom many were so far off at the moment\r\nthat Lacy declared that it would take six or eight days to bring them\r\nup. By the time that they were all arrived, the French would have\r\nconcentrated also, and would be equal in numbers to the whole force\r\nthat the allies could collect. Tarragona was reported to be in a better\r\nstate of defence than Eroles allowed, and the engineers declared that\r\nit might take ten days to reduce it. But the greatest problem of all\r\nwas that of provisions: Lacy declared that the country could furnish\r\nlittle or nothing: he could not undertake to keep his own small army\r\nconcentrated for more than a week. The Anglo-Sicilians must be fed from\r\nthe fleet, and he could provide no transport. Evidently the expedition\r\nwould be tied down to the shore, and the siege of Tarragona was the\r\nonly possible operation. Since the Anglo-Sicilian army could not\r\nmanœuvre at large or retire into the inland, it would have to fight\r\nDecaen, to cover the investment of Tarragona, within a few days of its\r\nlanding. On the other hand if, as Eroles promised, the _somatenes_\r\nrose on every side at the news of the disembarkation, the outlying\r\nFrench troops might not be able to get up to join Decaen, the roads\r\nwould be blocked, the enemy might never be able to concentrate, and the\r\nforce about Barcelona, his only immediately available field army, was\r\nnot more than 8,000 strong, and might be beaten.\r\n\r\nThere were those who said that Lacy never wished to see the expedition\r\nland, because he was jealous of Eroles, and thought that a general\r\nrising which ended in success would have meant the end of his own power\r\nand tenure of office[749]. It is at least certain that the views which\r\nhe expressed caused Maitland much trouble, and made him to flinch from\r\nhis original idea of landing without delay and attacking Tarragona,\r\naccording to Wellington’s desire. The English general took refuge in a\r\ncouncil of war--the usual resource of commanders of a wavering purpose.\r\nHis lieutenants all advised him to refuse to land, on the ground that\r\nhis forces were too small and heterogeneous, that Lacy could give no\r\nprompt assistance, and that there was no sign as yet of the general\r\nrising which Eroles promised. Moreover, some of the naval officers told\r\nhim that anchorage off the Catalan coast was so dangerous, even in\r\nsummer, that they could not promise him that the army could be taken\r\nsafely on board in case of a defeat. To the intense disgust of Eroles\r\nand the other Catalan leaders, but not at all to Lacy’s displeasure,\r\nMaitland accepted the advice of his council of war, and resolved to\r\nmake off, and to land farther south. The original idea was to have\r\ncome ashore somewhere in the midst of the long coast-line south of\r\nthe Ebro, between Tortosa and Valencia, with the object of breaking\r\nSuchet’s line in the middle. But the news of Joseph O’Donnell’s\r\ngratuitous disaster at Castalla, which obviously enabled the Marshal\r\nto use his whole army against a disembarking force, and the suggestion\r\nthat Alicante itself might be in danger, induced Maitland in the end\r\nto order his whole armament to steer southward. He arrived at Alicante\r\non August 7th, and commenced to send his troops ashore--both his own\r\n6,000 men and Whittingham’s 4,000 auxiliaries of the Balearic division.\r\nSince Roche was already there, with his troops in good order, there\r\nwere 14,000 men collected in Alicante, over and above the wrecks of\r\nO’Donnell’s force. If only the Murcians had been intact, the mass\r\nassembled would have caused Suchet serious qualms, since it would have\r\noutnumbered the French corps in Valencia very considerably, and there\r\nwas in it a nucleus of good troops in Maitland’s British and German\r\nbattalions. The news of Salamanca had also come to hand by this time,\r\nand had transformed the general aspect of affairs in Suchet’s eyes:\r\nKing Joseph was again demanding instant help from him, in the hope of\r\nretaining Madrid, and had called in (without his knowledge or consent)\r\nthe division of Palombini from Aragon, and the garrison of Cuenca[750].\r\nIf Wellington should advance--as he actually did--against the King,\r\nand should drive him from his capital, it was possible that the main\r\ntheatre of the war might be transferred to the borders of Valencia.\r\n\r\n  [749] This seems to have been Codrington’s view, see his\r\n  _Memoirs_, i. p. 278, and he knew Lacy and the Catalans well.\r\n\r\n  [750] See above, pp. 487 and 488.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal therefore resolved to concentrate: he ordered Habert and\r\nHarispe to fall back behind the Xucar with their 8,000 men, abandoning\r\ntheir advanced positions in front of Alicante, and placed them at\r\nJativa; here he threw up some field-works and armed a _tête-de-pont_ on\r\nthe Xucar at Alberique. He ordered Paris’s brigade to come down from\r\nnorthern Aragon to Teruel, and he warned the generals in Catalonia that\r\nhe might ask for reinforcements from them.\r\n\r\nMaitland therefore, after his landing, found that the French had\r\ndisappeared from his immediate front. He was joined by Roche, and by\r\nthe 67th regiment from Cartagena, and proposed to drive Harispe from\r\nCastalla and Ibi. But he marched against him on August 16th-18th, only\r\nto find that he had already retired behind the Xucar. Farther than\r\nMonforte he found himself unable to advance, for want of transport\r\nand food. For the expedition from Sicily had not been fitted out for\r\nan advance into the inland. It had been supposed by Bentinck that\r\nthe troops would be able to hire or requisition in Spain the mules\r\nand carts that they would require for a forward movement. But the\r\ncountry-side about Alicante was already exhausted by the long stay\r\nof the Murcian army in that region; and O’Donnell--before Maitland\r\nhad come to know the difficulties of his position, got from him a\r\npledge that he would not take anything from it either by purchase or\r\nby requisition. The British general had hired mules to draw his guns,\r\nbut found that he could not feed them on a forward march, because the\r\nresources of the district were denied him. He himself had to stop at\r\nElda, Roche at Alcoy, because the problem of transport and food could\r\nnot be solved. All that he could do was to feel the French line of\r\noutposts behind the Xucar with a flying column composed of his own\r\nhandful of cavalry--200 sabres--and a detachment of Spanish horse lent\r\nhim by Elio, the successor of O’Donnell [August 20th-21st].\r\n\r\nBut even the thought of farther advance had now to be given up, for the\r\nnews arrived that King Joseph had evacuated Madrid on the 14th, and\r\nwas marching on Valencia with the 15,000 men that he had collected. To\r\nhave tried any further attack on Suchet, when such an army was coming\r\nin from the flank to join the Marshal, would have been insane. The\r\nFrench force in this region would be doubled in strength by the King’s\r\narrival. Wherefore Maitland drew back his own division to Alicante,\r\nand brought Roche back to Xixona, not far in front of that fortress,\r\nexpecting that he might ere long be pushed back, and perhaps besieged\r\nthere. Wellington in the end of the month, having the same idea, sent\r\nhim elaborate directions for the defence of the place, bidding him to\r\nhold it as long as possible, but to keep his transports close at hand,\r\nand to re-embark if things came to the worst[751].\r\n\r\n  [751] See Wellington to Maitland, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 386, dated\r\n  Aug. 30.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th King Joseph’s army and its vast convoy of French and\r\nSpanish refugees, joined Suchet’s outposts at Almanza, and the\r\ndangerous combination which Maitland and Wellington had foreseen came\r\nto pass. But what was still more threatening for the army at Alicante\r\nwas the rumour that Soult was about to evacuate Andalusia, and to\r\nbring the whole of the Army of the South to Valencia. This would mean\r\nthat nearly 80,000 French troops would ere long be collected within\r\nstriking distance of the motley force over which Maitland and Elio now\r\nheld command, and it seemed probable that Soult in his march might\r\nsweep over the whole country-side, disperse the Spanish forces on the\r\nMurcian border, and perhaps besiege and take Cartagena and Alicante\r\nas a _parergon_ on the way. We have seen in chapter X that nothing\r\nof this kind happened: Soult hung on to Andalusia for a month longer\r\nthan Wellington or any one else deemed probable: he only left Granada\r\non September 17th, and when he did move on Valencia he took the bad\r\ninland roads by Huescar, Calasparra, and Hellin, leaving Murcia and\r\nCartagena and the whole sea-coast undisturbed. The reason, as has been\r\nalready pointed out, was the outbreak of yellow fever at Cartagena,\r\nwhich caused the Duke of Dalmatia so much concern that he preferred to\r\nkeep away from the infection, even at the cost of taking inferior and\r\ncircuitous roads.\r\n\r\nFor the whole of September, therefore, Suchet on the one side and\r\nMaitland and the Spaniards on the other, were waiting on Soult: in the\r\nexpectation of his early arrival both sides kept quiet. Thus tamely\r\nended the first campaign of the Anglo-Sicilian army, on whose efforts\r\nWellington had so much counted. And its later operations, as we shall\r\npresently see, were to be wholly in keeping with its unlucky start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON RETURNS TO THE DOURO. FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garrison of the Retiro had surrendered on August 14th: Wellington\r\nremained for seventeen days longer in Madrid, and did not leave it,\r\nto take the field again, until August 31st. His stay in the Spanish\r\ncapital was not due, in the first instance, to the causes which might\r\nseem most plausible--a desire to give his war-worn infantry a rest\r\nduring the hottest weeks of the year, or a determination to reorganize\r\nthe military resources of Madrid and New Castile for the profit of\r\nthe allied cause[752]. Both these ideas existed, and the latter in\r\nespecial absorbed much of his attention--he spent long hours in trying\r\nto concert, with Carlos de España, measures for the utilization of\r\nthe captured munitions of the Retiro, and for the recruiting of the\r\nregiments of the Spanish ‘Fifth Army.’ In this he accomplished less\r\nthan he had hoped, partly because of the dreadful exhaustion of the\r\ncentral provinces of Spain after the famine of the preceding year,\r\npartly because of the inefficiency of most of the Spanish officials\r\nwith whom he had to deal. He was much discontented with the list of\r\npersons appointed by the new Regency to take up authority in the\r\nreconquered provinces; and Castaños, whom he most trusted, and desired\r\nto have with him, was lingering in Galicia[753].\r\n\r\n  [752] Wellington to Henry Wellesley, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 364.\r\n\r\n  [753] Same to same, _Dispatches_, ix. p. 373. He was particularly\r\n  indignant at the supersession of Mexia, Intendant of Castile, by\r\n  Lozano de Torres, with whom he had quarrelled in Estremadura in\r\n  1809, ‘the most useless and inefficient of all God’s creatures,\r\n  and an impediment to all business.’\r\n\r\nBut the main reason for the halt at Madrid was the uncertainty as to\r\nthe movements of Soult. Was the Duke of Dalmatia about, as would seem\r\nreasonable, to evacuate Andalusia? And if so, would he pick up King\r\nJoseph and the Army of the Centre in La Mancha, and march on Madrid\r\nwith the 65,000 men whom they could collect? Or would he retire on\r\nValencia and join Suchet? Or again, would he persist in his intention,\r\nexpressed in dispatches to Joseph, which had fallen into Wellington’s\r\nhands, of holding on to Andalusia and making it a separate base of\r\nFrench power, despite of the fact that he had been cut off from\r\ncommunication with the imperial armies of the East and North?\r\n\r\n‘Any other but a modern French army would now leave the province [of\r\nAndalusia],’ wrote Wellington to Lord Bathurst on July 18[754], ‘as\r\nthey have now absolutely no communication of any kind with France or\r\nwith any other French army; and they are pressed on all sides by troops\r\nnot to be despised, and can evidently do nothing. Yet I suspect that\r\nSoult will not stir till I force him out by a direct movement upon him:\r\nand I think of making that movement as soon as I can take the troops\r\nto the South without injuring their health.’ All military reasons were\r\nagainst the probability of Soult’s holding on in Andalusia, yet he had\r\ncertainly expressed his intention of doing so as late as the middle of\r\nJuly, and, what was more important still in judging of his plans, he\r\nhad not made a sudden movement of retreat when the news of Salamanca\r\nreached him. Hill writing on August 4th, six days after the receipt of\r\nthe tidings of Marmont’s disaster, had to report[755] that ‘the recent\r\nglorious event’ seemed to have had very little effect on the enemy, who\r\n‘continued in a strong position in his front.’ And this was true, for\r\nSoult, after hearing the news of Salamanca, had made his last frantic\r\nappeal to King Joseph to fall back on Andalusia, and make his base at\r\nSeville if Madrid were lost. Wellington was right in suspecting that,\r\nif the Marshal had got his desire, the South would have been maintained\r\nagainst him, and he would have had to march thither in person, to pick\r\nup Hill, and to bring matters to an issue by another pitched battle.\r\nIt was only on August 12th that Soult reluctantly resolved to evacuate\r\nAndalusia: his first precautionary movements for retreat were made\r\non August 15th, but it was not till the 24th that the Cadiz Lines\r\nwere destroyed, or till the 26th that all the French troops in front\r\nof Hill suddenly vanished. Wellington was therefore kept for more\r\nthan a fortnight in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he\r\nmight not have to march southward in the end, to evict Soult from his\r\nviceroyalty. It was only on the 24th that he got information from\r\nHill (written on the 17th) which gave the first premonitory warning\r\nthat the French seemed to be on the move[756]. Next day confirming\r\nevidence began to come to hand: ‘it is generally reported, and I have\r\nreason to believe, that the Army of the South is about to make a\r\ngeneral movement ... it is supposed in the direction of Granada and\r\nValencia[757].’ On August 30, ‘though Sir Rowland Hill on the 17th\r\ninstant had no intelligence that the march was commenced, there was\r\nevery appearance of it.’ The fact that seemed to make it incredible\r\nthat Soult could be proposing to hold Andalusia any longer, was precise\r\ninformation that King Joseph and the Army of the Centre had marched\r\nupon Valencia to join Suchet, and had passed Chinchilla on August 24th,\r\ngoing eastward[758]. If the King had gone by the passes of the Sierra\r\nMorena southward, to join Soult, doubt might still have been possible:\r\nbut since he had made Valencia his goal, and was crawling slowly along\r\nin that direction with his immense convoy of refugees and baggage,\r\nSoult--left entirely to his own resources--could not retain his present\r\nposition. He must march on Valencia also, and it would be many weeks\r\nbefore he could place himself in touch with Suchet, and produce a\r\nthreatening combination on the Mediterranean coast.\r\n\r\n  [754] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 370.\r\n\r\n  [755] See above, p. 537.\r\n\r\n  [756] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 377.\r\n\r\n  [757] Ibid., ix. pp. 380-1.\r\n\r\n  [758] News from Joseph O’Donnell commanding the Spanish army of\r\n  Murcia. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 388.\r\n\r\nOn August 31st, therefore, with no absolutely certain news yet to hand\r\nas to Soult’s retreat, but with every military probability in favour\r\nof its having been begun, Wellington resolved to leave Madrid and to\r\nreturn to the valley of the Douro, where the movements of Clausel and\r\nthe French Army of Portugal demanded his attention. He never thought\r\nfor a moment of endeavouring to march through La Mancha to intercept or\r\nmolest Soult’s retreat. The distance was too great, the roads unknown,\r\nthe problem of feeding the army in the desolate and thinly-peopled\r\ncountry about the Murcian and Andalusian borders too difficult.\r\nWellington made up his mind that he had some time to spare: he would\r\nmarch against Clausel and then ‘return to this part of the country\r\n[Madrid] as soon as I shall have settled matters to my satisfaction\r\non the right of the Douro. And I hope I shall be here [Madrid] and\r\nshall be joined by the troops under Sir Rowland Hill, before Soult\r\ncan have made much progress to form his junction with the King[759].’\r\nIt is important, therefore, to realize that, in Wellington’s original\r\nconception, the operations in Old Castile, which we may call the\r\nBurgos campaign, were to be but a side-issue, an intermediate and\r\nsecondary matter. The real danger in Spain, as he considered, was the\r\napproaching, but not immediate, junction of Soult, Suchet, and King\r\nJoseph at Valencia. And the Commander-in-Chief evidently proposed to\r\nbe at Madrid, to face this combination, by October 1st. How and why he\r\nfailed to carry out this intention must be explained at length in the\r\nnext volume.\r\n\r\n  [759] Wellington to Lord Bathurst, August 30, from Madrid.\r\n  _Dispatches_, ix. p. 390.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when he marched off to the Douro with part of his army,\r\nhe had to make provisions for the conduct of affairs in the South\r\nduring his absence. Hill, as has been shown in another chapter, had\r\nbeen told to march on Madrid, as soon as Soult’s forces had made their\r\ndefinitive departure for the East. As Drouet only disappeared from\r\nHill’s front on August 26th, the northward march of the army from\r\nEstremadura began late: it had not commenced to cross the Guadiana\r\non September 1: its progress to and along the Tagus valley was slow,\r\nowing to the difficulty of procuring food, and its main body had not\r\nreached Almaraz and Talavera before the 20th September, and was only\r\nconcentrated about and behind Toledo at the end of the month. But\r\nthough Hill’s movement was not rapid, it was made in sufficiently good\r\ntime to face the danger that was brewing on the side of Valencia. And\r\nthere can be no doubt that if he had received orders to hurry, he\r\ncould have been in line some days before he actually appeared[760]. He\r\nbrought up all his force[761] except Buchan’s Portuguese brigade[762],\r\nwhich was left at Truxillo and Merida, to keep up his communication\r\nwith Elvas. Estremadura, so long the contending ground of armies, had\r\nnow no solid body of troops left in it save the Spanish garrison of\r\nBadajoz. For Penne Villemur and Morillo, with the division which had\r\nso long operated in Hill’s vicinity, moved with him into New Castile.\r\nThey went by the rugged roads through the mountains of the province of\r\nToledo[763], and took post at Herencia, on the high-road from Madrid to\r\nthe Despeñaperros pass, in front of the British 2nd Division.\r\n\r\n  [760] The cavalry at the head of the column were at Truxillo\r\n  on the 15th September, Almaraz on the 19th, Talavera on the\r\n  21st. The infantry in the rear of the division only crossed the\r\n  Guadiana at Medellin on September 14th, was at Truxillo on the\r\n  17th, Almaraz on the 20th, Talavera on the 26th, Toledo on the\r\n  30th (Swabey’s diary).\r\n\r\n  [761] Hill brought up the 2nd Division--British, 7,000;\r\n  Portuguese, 2,900; Hamilton’s Portuguese, 5,300; Long’s and\r\n  Slade’s cavalry, about 1,900; artillery, about 400 = 17,500 of\r\n  all ranks.\r\n\r\n  [762] Late Power’s brigade: The 5th and 17th, the old garrison of\r\n  Elvas, and the 22nd.\r\n\r\n  [763] They marched from Cabeza del Buey, on the borders of\r\n  Andalusia and Estremadura, via Talarubia and Mazarambros to\r\n  Herencia. ‘Journal of Regiment of Leon,’ in Clonard, vol. iv.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of Hill’s column, and separated from it by many days’\r\nmarch, was another small British force toiling up to Madrid from a very\r\ndistant point. This was the force under Colonel Skerrett, which had\r\ntaken part in the fighting round Seville. It consisted of the battalion\r\nof the Guards from Cadiz, the 2/47th and 2/87th, two companies of the\r\n2/95th, a squadron of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., the 20th Portuguese\r\nLine, and a battery. By Wellington’s orders no British troops were now\r\nleft in Cadiz save the 2/59th, part of de Watteville’s regiment, the\r\n‘battalion of foreign recruits,’ soon to become the 8/60th, and a few\r\nartillery. Skerrett’s column, some 4,000 strong, marched by Merida\r\nand Truxillo, and reached Toledo in time to join Hill for the autumn\r\ncampaign in front of Madrid. Hill’s corps, when joined by Skerrett,\r\nprovided a force of over 20,000 men, about equally divided between\r\nBritish and Portuguese.\r\n\r\nIt would have been profitable to Wellington, as matters went in the\r\nend, if he had handed over the entire task of observing Soult’s\r\noperations to Hill. But being under the impression that he would return\r\nere long to Madrid, he left there and in the neighbourhood nearly\r\nhalf the force that he had brought from Salamanca. He only took with\r\nhim to oppose Clausel the 1st, 5th, and 7th Divisions, with Pack’s and\r\nBradford’s Portuguese, and Bock’s and Ponsonby’s (late Le Marchant’s)\r\nbrigades of heavy dragoons, a force of some 21,000 men[764]. He\r\nleft the 3rd and Light Divisions at Madrid, the 4th Division at the\r\nEscurial, and Carlos de España’s Spaniards at Segovia. The cavalry of\r\nVictor Alten and D’Urban were assigned to this force, and remained,\r\nthe former at Madrid, the latter at the Palacio de Rio Frio, near\r\nSegovia. The British infantry divisions had all suffered heavily at\r\nBadajoz, and the 4th at Salamanca also--they were weak in numbers, but\r\nwere expecting ere long to be joined by numerous convalescents. The\r\ntotal force left behind amounted to about 17,000 men, including the\r\nSpaniards[765]. Thus when Hill and Skerrett came up from the South,\r\nthere was a mass of nearly 40,000 men accumulated round Madrid, while\r\nWellington himself, after picking up Clinton and the 6th Division, and\r\nthe other troops left on the Douro, had a little under 30,000. This\r\nproved in the autumn campaign an ideally bad partition of the army, for\r\non each wing the Anglo-Portuguese force was decidedly less numerous\r\nthan that which the French could bring against it. If Wellington had\r\ntaken his full strength to the North, he could have defied Clausel\r\nand Caffarelli, and they could never have made head against him, or\r\npressed him away from Burgos. Hill, on the other hand, in front of\r\nMadrid, would have been no more helpless with 22,000 men than he\r\nactually was with 38,000 men, when Soult and King Joseph brought 60,000\r\nagainst him in October. In either case he could only retreat without\r\noffering battle. But Wellington, if the three additional divisions\r\nleft in New Castile had been brought to the North, would have had such\r\na superiority over the French in Old Castile that he could have dealt\r\nwith them as he pleased. The only explanation of the unfortunate\r\nproportional division of his army, is that Wellington undervalued the\r\ntask he had to execute beyond the Douro, thought that he could finish\r\nit more quickly than was to be the case, and calculated on being back\r\nat Madrid in October before Soult could give trouble.\r\n\r\n  [764] There marched with Wellington--1st Division, 5,980 of\r\n  all ranks; 5th Division, 4,726; 7th Division, 4,841; Pack and\r\n  Bradford, 3,954; Bock and Ponsonby, 1,673; artillery, &c., about\r\n  500 = 21,674.\r\n\r\n  [765] There remained at Madrid, the Escurial, &c.--Arentschildt’s\r\n  cavalry, 515; D’Urban’s Portuguese cavalry, 552; 3rd Division,\r\n  4,234; 4th Division, 4,548; Light Division, 3,462; artillery,\r\n  about 350; Carlos de España’s Spaniards, about 3,000 = 16,661.\r\n\r\nYet when he started he was not comfortable in his mind about the\r\ngeneral situation. If the French drew together, their total strength\r\nin Spain was far too great for him. In a moody moment he wrote to\r\nhis brother Henry: ‘though I still hope to be able to maintain our\r\nposition in Castile, and even to improve our advantages, I shudder when\r\nI reflect upon the enormity of the task which I have undertaken, with\r\ninadequate powers myself to do anything, and without assistance of any\r\nkind from the Spaniards.... I am apprehensive that all this may turn\r\nout ill for the Spanish cause. If by any cause I should be overwhelmed,\r\nor should be obliged to retire, what will the world say? What will the\r\npeople of England say? What will those in Spain say?[766]’\r\n\r\n  [766] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 375.\r\n\r\nWellington’s forebodings were, only too soon, to be justified. But the\r\ntale of the campaign against Clausel and Caffarelli, of the advance to\r\nand retreat from Burgos, must be told in another volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSUCHET’S ARMY IN VALENCIA.

BRITISH LOSSES DURING THE SIEGE\r\n\r\nThe British losses between the investment and the storm were, according\r\nto the official returns at the Record Office, 1 officer and 69 men\r\nkilled, 19 officers and 462 men wounded, 2 men (both Portuguese)\r\nmissing, or a total of 553. These figures added to the 568 lost in the\r\nstorm (for details see below), make altogether 1,121, which does not\r\nagree with the statement in Wellington _Dispatches_, viii. p. 557;\r\nthis gives as the total for the siege 9 officers and 169 men killed,\r\n70 officers and 748 men wounded, 7 men missing, or only 1,003, over a\r\nhundred less than the total from the return quoted above. Napier gives\r\n1,290 as the casualties for the whole siege, which much exceeds the\r\nreturn in the Record Office; he also makes the total for the storm 60\r\nofficers and 650 killed and wounded, while the official return here\r\nprinted makes it only 59 officers and 509 men.

The one on which\r\nmost dispute arose was that concerning the capture of General Barrié.\r\nGurwood of the 52nd claimed to have been the first officer to enter\r\nthe Castle, and to receive the surrender of the governor and his\r\nstaff. He is mentioned as doing so in Wellington’s Rodrigo dispatch,\r\nand generally had the credit at the time. But Lieutenant Mackie of\r\nthe 88th, who had led the forlorn hope of the 3rd Division, also put\r\nin a claim, and had many supporters. Many years after the war was\r\nover, Maxwell (the author of one of the several _Lives of the Duke\r\nof Wellington_, which came out in early Victorian times) championed\r\nMackie’s claim with such vehemence that Gurwood issued a pamphlet\r\ndefending his own credit. Considerable controversy arose in the _United\r\nService Journal_ for 1843, and elsewhere. Mackie’s story was that\r\nhe, with some of the 88th, arrived first at the Castle, summoned the\r\ngovernor to surrender, and was received by several French officers,\r\nwho handed him over a sword and announced that the general yielded.\r\nSome moments after, according to Mackie, Gurwood came up, spoke to the\r\ngovernor himself, and obtained his sword, which, when the prisoners\r\nwere brought before Wellington, he presented to his commander, who\r\ngave it him back, telling him to retain it as a trophy, and entered\r\nGurwood’s name in his dispatch as the officer who had received the\r\nsurrender. Gurwood’s story, told with as much detail and circumstance\r\nas Mackie’s, is that he, with two soldiers of the 52nd, arrived at the\r\ncitadel, got the gate opened by threatening the officer in charge that\r\nno quarter would be given if resistance were made, and was received by\r\nBarrié, who in a great state of nervousness, threw his arms round his\r\nneck, kissed him, and said, ‘_je suis le Gouverneur de la place--je\r\nsuis votre prisonnier_,’ handing over his sword at the same time.\r\nHe accompanied the captive staff-officers to Wellington’s presence,\r\nand presented them to him. It is difficult to come to any certain\r\nconclusion in face of two such contradictory tales, but there is a\r\nbare possibility of reconciling them, by supposing that Mackie entered\r\nfirst, that the door was closed behind him and his party, and that\r\nGurwood was let in a moment later, and spoke to the governor, while\r\nMackie had been dealing only with his aide-de-camp, whose sword he had\r\nreceived. But if so, it is odd that Gurwood never saw Mackie: Mackie is\r\nquite positive that he saw Gurwood, and that he came in some minutes\r\nlater than himself. The dispute tended to become a controversy between\r\nLight Division and 3rd Division veterans, each backing their own man. A\r\nsynopsis of the papers may be found in the last two chapters of vol. i\r\nof Grattan’s second series of _Adventures with the Connaught Rangers_\r\n(London, 1853). Napier, who was much interested in the discussion,\r\nput in his final definitive edition the non-committal statement that\r\n‘the garrison fled to the Castle, where Lieutenant Gurwood, who\r\nthough severely wounded had entered among the foremost at the Lesser\r\nBreach, received the governor’s sword’ (iv. p. 90). Harry Smith says\r\n(i. p. 58): ‘Gurwood got great credit here unfairly. Johnstone and poor\r\nUniacke were the first on the ramparts, Gurwood having been knocked\r\ndown in the breach, and momentarily stunned. However, Gurwood’s a sharp\r\nfellow, and he cut off in search of the governor and brought his sword\r\nto the Duke. He made the _most_ of it.’\r\n\r\nAnother controversy is as to which troops of the 3rd Division got first\r\ninto the body of the town. The 88th claimed the priority, but also the\r\n94th. The late Mr. Andrew Lang lent me a very interesting letter of his\r\nkinsman, William Lang of the 94th, very clearly stating that a solid\r\nbody of 200 men of his regiment were the first troops that penetrated\r\nin force to the Plaza Mayor, and received the surrender of the garrison\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nStill another controversy, about which there is much in the Rice Jones\r\npapers, in the possession of Commander Hon. Henry Shore, R.N., is as to\r\nwhat engineer officers conducted the storming-columns. Apparently some\r\ncredit has been misplaced among individuals here, but to decide upon\r\nthe point would take more space than a book like this can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nARMY OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nREORGANIZED AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE POLES AND OTHER REGIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN OF MARCH 1, 1812\r\n\r\n[From the returns in the _Archives Nationales_.

This agrees well enough with the\r\nMarch total of 60,663, allowing for a month’s wear and tear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF BADAJOZ, MARCH 15-APRIL 6, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH GARRISON ON MARCH 15\r\n\r\n[See the Tables in Belmas, iv. pp. 364-5 and in Jones, i. p. 229.]\r\n\r\n  Staff                                                25\r\n  Infantry:\r\n    3/9th Léger                     officers and men  580\r\n    1/28th Léger                        ”      ”      597\r\n    1/58th Ligne                        ”      ”      450\r\n    3/88th Ligne                        ”      ”      600\r\n    3/103rd Ligne                       ”      ”      540\r\n    64th Ligne (2 companies)            ”      ”      130\r\n    Hesse-Darmstadt (2 batts.)          ”      ”      910\r\n    _Juramentados_                                     54 = 3,861 infantry.\r\n  Cavalry                                              42\r\n  Artillery                                           261\r\n  Engineers and Sappers                               260\r\n  Sick in Hospital                                    300\r\n  Civil Departments, non-combatants, &c.              254\r\n                                                    -----\r\n                                                    5,003\r\n\r\nA report of the governor at noon on April 5, found among his papers\r\nafter the storm, gave the following as surviving under arms (sick\r\nexcluded)--infantry 3,403, artillery 282, engineers 217, cavalry\r\n50, _Juramentados_ 86. This report, printed in Jones, i. p. 230,\r\nimplies a higher original total than Belmas allows--the artillery and\r\n_Juramentados_ are actually more numerous on April 5 than on March 15!\r\nAnd the infantry are only 458 less, despite of losses of a considerably\r\nhigher figure, for another paper of the commandant shows (Jones, i. p.\r\n230)--Sortie of March 19: killed 30, wounded 287=317[769]. Storm of\r\nPicurina Fort: killed or prisoners, 8 officers, 278 men = 286. We have\r\nthus 603 casualties in these two affairs only, beside the ordinary wear\r\nand tear of the siege.\r\n\r\n  [769] Phillipon’s report to Clarke, drawn up on June 12, gives\r\n  273 instead of 317 for the loss in this sally (see Belmas, iv. p.\r\n  414).\r\n\r\nNoting the considerable number of ‘round figures’ in Belmas’s table, I\r\nam inclined to think that the total of the garrison must have been a\r\nfew hundreds over what he allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) LOSSES AT STORM OF BADAJOZ, APRIL 6, 1811\r\n\r\n[From the Returns at the Record Office.]\r\n\r\n                            _Killed._            _Wounded._            _Missing._\r\n                      _Officers._  _Men._   _Officers._  _Men._   _Officers._  _Men._  _Total._\r\n  General Staff            1        --           16        --          --        --       17\r\n  Royal Artillery          1         6            1         9          --        --       17\r\n  Royal Engineers          2        --            3         5          --        --       10\r\n  Assistant Engineers     --        --            3        --          --        --        3\r\n\r\n    THIRD DIVISION.\r\n  Kempt’s Brigade:\r\n    1/45th Foot            6        19            8        64          --        --       97\r\n    3/60th Foot            1         4            4        26          --        --       35\r\n    74th Foot             --        12            7        33          --         2       54\r\n    1/88th Foot            3        28            7       106          --        --      144\r\n  J.

It consisted of the 49,636 officers and men\r\naccounted for by the return of July 15th printed on the next page,\r\nminus some 700 men lost at the combats of Castrillo and Castrejon [also\r\ncalled ‘combat of the Guarena’] on July 18, and such few hundreds\r\nmore as may have fallen behind from fatigue during the long marches\r\nof July 20-1. Roughly speaking, it must have counted some 48,500 men,\r\nas opposed to Wellington’s 50,000. The French translators of Napier’s\r\n_Peninsular War_ (Mathieu Dumas and Foltz) only give a table of June\r\n15, which is of course a month out of date for Salamanca, and append\r\na note that ‘deducting artillery, engineers, _équipages militaires_,\r\nofficers, sergeants, and garrisons, as also losses between June 15 and\r\nJuly 15 they find the result of about 42,000 sabres and bayonets for\r\nthe battle.’ Why any sane person _should_ deduct officers, sergeants,\r\nand artillerymen from a fighting total I am unable to conceive, though\r\ncontemporary British writers, including Wellington himself, often did\r\nso. But the results of adding to their ‘42,000 sabres and bayonets’\r\nthe list of 1,925 officers, 3,244 artillerymen and artillery train\r\n(both in the divisions and in the reserve), 332 engineers, and 742\r\n_équipages militaires_, is to give the figure 48,343, which practically\r\nagrees with the total that I state above; if sergeants are added it\r\nwould much exceed that total. We may take this, therefore, as fairly\r\ncorrect--bearing in mind that the 26 officers and 742 men of the\r\n_équipages militaires_ cannot be counted as combatants.\r\n\r\nThese totals do not include the 23rd Léger (2 batts.) and the 2/1st\r\nLine, both from Thomières’s division, which were garrisoning Astorga,\r\nabout 1,500 strong. Nor do they include the minor garrisons left at\r\nToro, Zamora, Olmedo, Valdestillas, Tordesillas, Simancas, Cabezon,\r\nMedina del Campo, Puente de Duero, Tudela de Douro, Amagro, &c., which\r\nappear to have been altogether about 4,184 strong, nor the dépôts at\r\nValladolid, 3,307 strong on June 15, but probably much less on July\r\n15, when Marmont had remounted nearly 1,000 dismounted dragoons and\r\npicked up all detachments and convalescents that he could gather. Nor\r\ndo they include the sick, who had been 8,633 on June 15th, and 8,332\r\non May 15th--probably the total in hospital was a trifle more on July\r\n15, owing to the fatigues of the campaigns round San Cristobal in the\r\nlatter days of June.\r\n\r\nParallel with the return of July 15th, I have printed that of August\r\n1. The difference between the two--211 officers and 10,124 men--might\r\nbe supposed to represent the losses in the campaign between those\r\ndates. It does not, however, because the total of August 1 represents\r\nnot only the survivors from the battle of Salamanca, but all the men\r\nfrom garrisons evacuated after it, and from the Valladolid dépôt, who\r\njoined the colours after the disaster of July 22, in consequence of the\r\ndistrict in which they were lying having been evacuated by the army.\r\nThe garrisons of Toro and Zamora held out till they were relieved, that\r\nof Tordesillas surrendered to the Galicians: but the men from the other\r\nsmaller garrisons and from the dépôts fell in to their respective corps\r\nbefore August 1. I imagine that we may take these additions to be some\r\n5,000 men at least, but cannot give the exact figures, through being\r\nunable to say what the Valladolid dépôts (3,307 strong on June 15)\r\namounted to on July 15.\r\n\r\nAfter comparing the totals of the brigades and regiments shown under\r\nJuly 15 and August 1, we must proceed to show the reasons why, in\r\nindividual cases, the regimental differences between the two sets of\r\nfigures cannot be taken to represent the sum of the losses in the\r\nSalamanca campaign. The proof is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY OF PORTUGAL BEFORE AND AFTER THE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA\r\n\r\nFrom two returns of effectives in the Archives of the Ministry of War,\r\nParis, dated July 15 and August 1, respectively.\r\n\r\n                                               _July 15._         _August 1._\r\n                                          _Officers._  _Men._  _Officers._  _Men._\r\n    1st DIVISION (Foy):\r\n\r\n  Brigade       { 6th Léger (2 batts.)           46   1,055           41     684\r\n   Chemineau    { 69th Ligne (2 batts.)          50   1,408           47   1,322\r\n\r\n  Brigade       {\r\n   Desgraviers- { 39th Ligne (2 batts.)          49     918           49     872\r\n   Berthelot    { 76th Ligne (2 batts.)          56   1,351           45     887\r\n\r\n  Artillery Train, &c.                            7     207            7     207\r\n                                                ---   -----          ---   -----\r\n        Divisional Total                        208   4,939          189   3,972\r\n                                                ---   -----          ---   -----\r\n    2nd DIVISION (Clausel):\r\n\r\n  Brigade       { 25th Léger (3 batts.)          54   1,485           43   1,222\r\n   Berlier      { 27th Ligne (2 batts.)          40   1,637           31   1,248\r\n\r\n  Brigade       { 50th Ligne (3 batts.)          52   1,490           46   1,177\r\n   Barbot       { 59th Ligne (2 batts.)          47   1,531           38   1,278\r\n\r\n  Artillery Train, &c.                            7     219            7     216\r\n                                                ---   -----          ---   -----\r\n        Divisional Total                        200   6,362          165   5,141\r\n                                                ---   -----          ---   -----\r\n\r\n  Brigade       { 31st Léger (2 batts.)          46   1,359           45   1,325\r\n   Menne        { 26th Ligne (2 batts.)          44   1,145           43   1,116\r\n\r\n                { 47th Ligne (3 batts.)          67   1,558           62   1,650\r\n        ?

I searched the immense volumes of rolls of French officers\r\nin captivity at the Record Office, and found 63 names of prisoners\r\ntaken at Salamanca, the Guarena, and Garcia Hernandez. A few of these\r\nduplicate the names of wounded officers to be found in Martinien’s\r\ntables, the remainder must represent the unwounded prisoners.\r\nWellington in his Salamanca dispatch wrote that he had 137 French\r\nofficers prisoners--evidently the larger number of them must have been\r\nwounded, as only 63 were sent off to England that autumn. Probably many\r\ndied in hospital. Prisoners are most numerous from the 101st, 22nd, and\r\nfrom Foy’s two regiments cut up at Garcia Hernandez, the 76th and 6th\r\nLéger.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of the _Archives de la Guerre_ at the Paris Ministry of\r\nWar I went through the regimental histories of all the French infantry\r\nregiments present at Salamanca. Like our own similar compilations, they\r\ndiffer much in value--some are very full and with statistics carefully\r\nworked out from regimental reports and pay-books; others are very thin\r\nand factless. Fourteen units give their losses, which I herewith annex:\r\n\r\n  Clausel’s Division: 25th Léger, 336; 27th Line, 159; 59th Line, 350.\r\n  Ferey’s Division: 70th Line, 111; 31st Léger, 340.\r\n  Sarrut’s Division: 2nd Léger, 202.\r\n  Maucune’s Division: 15th Line, 359.\r\n  Brennier’s Division: 17th Léger, 264; 65th Line, 359.\r\n  Thomières’s Division: 1st Line, 227; 62nd Line, 868; 101st Line, 1,000.\r\n  Bonnet’s Division: 120th, 458; 122nd, 527.\r\n\r\nThe total of this makes 5,560 for these fourteen corps; we leave\r\nfifteen others unaccounted for. As a rough calculation I suppose that\r\nwe may hold that as these regiments lost, as we know from Martinien’s\r\nlists [which are not _quite_ complete], at least 152 officers out of\r\n5,560 of all ranks, then the other fifteen regiments with 181 officers\r\nkilled or wounded must have lost something like 6,000. The vagaries\r\nof the proportion between officers and men hit are extraordinary in\r\nindividual units, but these tend to rectify themselves on a large\r\ntotal consisting of many regiments. I therefore believe that 11,560\r\nwould be something very like the total loss _killed and wounded_ in the\r\nFrench infantry. We have then to allow for some 40 unwounded officers\r\ntaken prisoners, and corresponding to them perhaps 1,200 unwounded men.\r\nThe total loss for the infantry would thus be 12,800. For cavalry and\r\nartillery, &c., 53 officers hit--as by Martinien’s tables--must imply\r\nsomething over a thousand men lost. We should thus arrive at a total of\r\n14,000 for the casualties--the sum which I suggest in my text (p. 469).\r\n\r\nTo show the worthlessness of any attempt to deduce the French losses\r\nby a mere comparison of the official ‘morning states’ of July 15 and\r\nAugust 1, the following instances may suffice.\r\n\r\nThe 65th Line shows 59 officers and 1,527 men present on July 15, 52\r\nofficers and 1,302 men on August 1. The apparent loss is 7 officers and\r\n225 men. But this unit’s regimental report shows 3 officers killed,\r\n5 officers wounded, 204 men killed or prisoners, 106 men wounded, 39\r\nmissing; total, 8 officers and 349 men. Therefore, as is obvious,\r\none officer and 124 men must have joined from somewhere (dépôt at\r\nValladolid?) between the two dates, or the deficiency would be 125\r\ngreater between the ‘present under arms’ of the two dates than is shown.\r\n\r\nA more striking case is the 62nd Line, of Thomières’s Division. It\r\nshows present on July 15, 47 officers and 1,076 men, on August 1st 45\r\nofficers and 1,048 men--the apparent loss is only 2 officers and 28\r\nmen. But Martinien’s lists show us that the regiment lost at least\r\n15 officers, killed and wounded, and the regimental report gives 20\r\nofficers and 848 men killed, wounded, or missing! The real loss is 868\r\nnot 30! Therefore 18 officers and about 800 men, the equivalent of a\r\nstrong battalion, must have joined between July 15 and August 1. This\r\ncorresponds to the fact that the 62nd showed only 2 battalions[787]\r\nat Salamanca, while the ‘morning state’ of June 15th showed it as\r\nhaving at the front three battalions and 1,900 rank and file. Clearly\r\nthe third battalion rejoined the colours after the battle--having\r\npresumably been quartered in the small garrisons of Castile evacuated\r\nafter the disaster of July 22. Many men must also have rejoined the\r\nother two battalions.\r\n\r\n  [787] And one odd company of its 3rd battalion, 61 of all ranks,\r\n  while in the return of August 1, the 3rd battalion has 13\r\n  officers and 480 men.\r\n\r\nBut the most absurd case of all is that of the 47th Line, whose total\r\nfigures actually _go up_ from 1,625 to 1,712 of all ranks between\r\nJuly 15th and August 1st--in despite of the fact that it lost (as\r\nMartinien’s lists show), 18 officers and not less therefore than 360\r\nrank and file (20 men per officer is a low allowance) at Salamanca. It\r\nmust have picked up from Valladolid and the small garrisons 13 officers\r\nand 452 men at least[788].\r\n\r\n  [788] The 2/47th shows on July 15, 310 of all ranks, on August 1,\r\n  513.\r\n\r\nClausel, writing to King Joseph on July 25, said that of the whole\r\nArmy of Portugal he could not yet show in the field on that day 20,000\r\nmen. This tallies well enough with the conclusion that we have already\r\ndrawn, that the total loss from the army, which on July 15 had about\r\n48,000 men, must have been some 14,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners,\r\nand over 10,000 men dispersed who were only just rallying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nBRITISH LOSSES AT THE COMBATS OF CASTREJON AND CASTRILLO[789], JULY 18,\r\n1812\r\n\r\n  [789] The fight at Castrillo is often called the ‘Combat of the\r\n  Guarena’.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Officers._             _Men._       _Missing_ _Total._\r\n                 _Killed._ _Wounded._ _Killed._ _Wounded._  _Men._\r\n\r\n  G.

The\r\n1/82nd was there till the summer, when it was relieved by the 1/26th,\r\nsent back from Portugal by Wellington. The 1/82nd sailed for Lisbon and\r\nmarched up to the front, but arrived just too late for the battle of\r\nSalamanca.\r\n\r\nAt Cadiz General Cooke commanded, at the commencement of the year, the\r\n3/1st Guards (which had arrived and relieved the ‘composite battalion\r\nof Guards’ before the end of 1811), also the 2/47th, 2/67th, 2/87th,\r\ntwo companies of the _Chasseurs Britanniques_, De Watteville’s regiment\r\n(which arrived before the end of 1811), the strange corps sometimes\r\ncalled the ‘battalion of Foreign Deserters,’ sometimes the ‘battalion\r\nof Foreign Recruits,’ two companies of the 2/95th, and a squadron of\r\nthe 2nd Hussars K.G.L., also the 20th Portuguese.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the 2/67th and five companies of De Watteville’s\r\nregiment were sent off to Cartagena.\r\n\r\nIn September the 3/1st Guards, 2/47th, 2/87th, two companies 95th, and\r\n20th Portuguese marched to join Hill at Madrid, taking with them the\r\nGerman squadron and two field-batteries: they were just 4,000 strong.\r\n\r\nThe 2/59th came out from home about the same time, and was in October\r\nthe only _British_ battalion at Cadiz. With them remained the ‘Foreign\r\nDeserters,’ seven companies of De Watteville, and two companies of\r\n_Chasseurs Britanniques_, as also some artillerymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE SCOVELL CIPHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the very great kindness of Mr. G. Scovell of Brighton, I have had\r\nplaced at my disposition the papers of his great-uncle, General Sir\r\nGeorge Scovell, G.C.B., who served during the Peninsular War in the\r\nIntelligence branch of the Quartermaster-General’s department. In\r\nthe beginning of 1812 the number of intercepted French dispatches\r\nin cipher which came into Wellington’s hands, through the happy\r\nactivity of Julian Sanchez and other guerrillero chiefs, began to be\r\nso considerable that the Commander-in-Chief thought it worth while to\r\ndetail a member of his staff to deal with them. Captain Scovell was\r\nselected because of his ingenuity in this line, and became responsible\r\nfor attempting to interpret all the captured documents. They were made\r\nover to him, and, having done what he could with them, he placed the\r\nfair-copy of the ‘decoded’ result in Wellington’s hands, but seems\r\nto have been allowed to keep the originals--which were, of course,\r\nunintelligible because of their form, and therefore useless to his\r\nchief. The file of documents which thus remained with him is most\r\ninteresting: they range in size from formal dispatches of considerable\r\nbulk--eight or ten folio pages long--down to scraps of the smallest\r\nsize written on thin paper, and folded up so as to go into some secret\r\nplace of concealment on the bearer’s person. Some of them look as if\r\nthey had been sewed up in a button, or rolled under the leather of a\r\nwhip handle, or pushed along the seam of a garment. I take it that\r\nthese must all have been entrusted to emissaries sent in disguise,\r\n_Afrancesados_ or peasants hired by a great bribe. Presumably each of\r\nthese scraps cost the life of the bearer when it was discovered--for\r\nthe guerrillero chiefs did not deal mildly with Spaniards caught\r\ncarrying French secret orders. The large folio dispatches, on the\r\nother hand, must no doubt have been carried by French aides-de-camp or\r\ncouriers, whose escorts were dispersed or captured by the _partidas_ at\r\nsome corner of the mountain roads between Madrid and the head-quarters\r\nof the Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.\r\n\r\nThe cipher letters are of two sorts--in the first (and more numerous)\r\nclass only the names of persons and places, and the most important\r\nsentences are in cipher--invariably a numerical cipher of arbitrary\r\nfigures. In the other class the whole dispatch is written in figures,\r\nnot merely its more weighty clauses. The reason for adopting the former\r\nmethod was that it saved much time; the transliterating of unimportant\r\nparts of the dispatch (such as compliments, and personal remarks of\r\nno strategical import) would have taken many extra hours, when it was\r\nnecessary to get a letter sent off in a hurry. But, as we shall see\r\nlater on, there was grave danger in using this system, because the\r\ncontext might sometimes allow the decipherer to make a good guess at\r\nthe disguised words, after reading that part of the letter which was\r\nnot so guarded.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a French dispatch is ciphered after the same infantile\r\nsystem that readers of romances will remember in Poe’s _Gold Bug_ or\r\nConan Doyle’s _Sherlock Holmes_, where letters or numbers are merely\r\nsubstituted for each other--where, for example, 2 always means letter\r\n_e_, or 25 letter _r_. This sort of cipher is dangerously easy to\r\nan expert reader, especially if the words are separated from each\r\nother, so that the number of letters in each can be counted. Take,\r\nfor example, a letter sent to Soult in 1813 by Cassan, the blockaded\r\ngovernor of Pampeluna[797]. Only one precaution had been taken in this\r\ncipher-epistle, viz. that elaborate care has been taken to defeat the\r\nattempt of the reader to arrive at results by counting what figures\r\nappear most frequently, and so deducing by their repetition that these\r\nmust be _e_ (the most frequently used letter in French, as in English),\r\n_s_, _i_, _a_, _t_, and other common letters. This is done by having\r\nsix alternative numbers for _e_, four each for _a_ and _i_, three for\r\n_t_, _s_, and _n_. Taking the simple phrase\r\n\r\n  47.50.40.41.14.26\r\n  58.24\r\n  3.51.10.36.44.23.17.24.10.50.53.27\r\n  47.46\r\n  11.18.39.17.46.21,\r\n\r\nwhich deciphers into ‘depuis le commencement du blocus,’ we see that\r\n_e_ appears five times, but is represented by both 50, 24, and 44; _u_\r\nthree times, but varied as 14 and 46; _m_ thrice, varied as 10 and\r\n36. This made the reader’s work harder, but not nearly so difficult\r\nas that required for certain other ciphers: for the whole set of\r\nsigns, being not much over 60 in number, there was a limited amount\r\nof possibilities for each figure-interpretation. And the words being\r\nseparated by spaces, there was a certainty that some of the two-letter\r\nunits must represent _et_, _de_, _ce_, _eu_, _du_, and similar common\r\nFrench two-letter words. As a matter of fact this particular dispatch\r\nwas deciphered in a few hours owing to the lucky guess that its initial\r\nwords\r\n\r\n  10.45.23.21.16.2.41.25\r\n  5.24\r\n  10.4.25.24.3.9.8.5\r\n\r\nmight be ‘Monsieur le Maréchal,’ the preliminary address to the\r\nintended recipient. This hypothesis was verified at once by finding\r\nthat this rendering made good sense for the two-letter words 23.24 =\r\n_ne_, and 10.2 = _me_, lower down in the letter. After this all was\r\nplain sailing.\r\n\r\n  [797] This particular letter is _not_ one of the Scovell file.\r\n\r\nBut the usual French cipher, the ‘Great Paris Cipher’ as Scovell called\r\nit, was a very much more complicated and difficult affair, as the list\r\nof figures, instead of being only a few score, ran to many hundreds.\r\nAnd of these only some few represented individual letters, more were\r\nparts of a syllabary: _ma_, _me_, _mi_, _mo_, _mu_, for example, had\r\neach a figure representing them, and so had _ab_- _ac_- _ad_- _af_-\r\n_ag_- &c. Moreover, there was a multitude of arbitrary numbers,\r\nrepresenting under a single figure words that must often be used in a\r\ndispatch, such as _hommes_, _armée_, _général_, _marche_, _ennemi_,\r\n_corps d’armée_, _canons_. In addition there was a code of proper\r\nnames, e.g. 1216 meant the River Douro, 93 Portugal, 1279 Talavera,\r\n585 King Joseph, 1391 General Dorsenne, 1327 the Army of the South,\r\n1280 Soult, 1300 Wellington, 400 Ciudad Rodrigo, &c. If the King wished\r\nthe Duke of Dalmatia to send 9,000 men of the Army of the South to\r\nTalavera, he had only to write\r\n\r\n  ‘585 désire que 1280 dirige 1156 (neuf) 692 (mille) 1102 (hommes)\r\n  de 1327 sur 1279.’\r\n\r\nHe would then cut up _désire_ and _dirige_ into the syllables\r\n_de-si-re_ and _di-ri-ge_, for each of which the syllabary had set\r\nfigures; there were also arbitrary numbers for _sur_, _de_, and _que_.\r\nSo the whole sentence would take up only fourteen numbers when written\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt would seem at first sight that to interpret such a dispatch would be\r\na perfectly hopeless task, to any one who had not the key to the cipher\r\nbefore him. That the admirably patient and ingenious Scovell at last\r\nmade out for himself a key from the laborious comparison of documents,\r\nwas nevertheless the fact. He was started on the track by the fortunate\r\ncircumstance that most of the intercepted dispatches were only _partly_\r\nin cipher. Marmont would write\r\n\r\n  ‘Avec les moyens que j’ai, et 798, 1118, 602, 131,\r\n  1112.663.1135.502 au delà de Sabugal,’\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  ‘J’avais donné l’ordre que 1003, 497, 1115, 1383, 69,711, 772,\r\n  530, de descendre cette rivière et de se mettre en communication\r\n  avec moi.’\r\n\r\nClearly the cipher-figures in the first case have something to do with\r\na march on Sabugal, in the second with orders to some general or body\r\nof troops (to be identified hereafter) to march down a river which the\r\ncontext shows must be the Tagus. This is not much help, and the task\r\nlooked still very hopeless. But when intercepted dispatches accumulated\r\nin quantities, and the same cipher-figures kept occurring among\r\nsentences of which part was written out in full, it became evident\r\nthat various cryptic figures must mean places and persons who could\r\nbe guessed at, with practical certainty. Occasionally a French writer\r\ncompletely ‘gives himself away’ by carelessness: e.g. Dorsenne wrote on\r\nApril 16 to Jourdan,\r\n\r\n  ‘Vous voulez de renseignement sur la situation militaire et\r\n  administrative de 1238:’\r\n\r\nobviously the probable interpretation of this number is ‘the Army of\r\nthe North,’ and this is rendered almost certain by passages lower down\r\nthe same letter. Equally incautious is King Joseph when he writes to\r\nMarmont,\r\n\r\n  ‘J’ai donné l’ordre au général Treillard de 117.8.7 la vallée du\r\n  1383, afin de marcher à 498.’\r\n\r\nConsidering the situation of the moment 117.8.7 must almost certainly\r\nmean _evacuate_, 1383 _Tagus_, and 498 some large town.[798] [The\r\nparticular dispatch in which this occurs is on a most curious piece of\r\npaper, half an inch broad, a foot long, and excessively thin. It is\r\nbent into twelve folds, and would fit into any small receptacle of one\r\ninch by half an inch. I fear the bearer who had it on his person must\r\nhave come to a bad end.] Suchet also made Scovell the present of some\r\nuseful words when he wrote on September 17 to Soult,\r\n\r\n  ‘Le Général Maitland commande l’expédition anglaise venue de 747:\r\n  O’Donnell peut réunir 786 692 1102 en y comprenant le corps de\r\n  l’Anglais Roche. Le 19 août je n’avais que 135 692 1102 à lui\r\n  opposer.’\r\n\r\nHere it is quite clear that ‘747’ means _Sicily_; that ‘692.1102’ in\r\nthe two statements of forces means _thousand men_. A little guessing\r\nand comparison with other cryptic statements of forces would soon show\r\nthat 135 meant 7 and 786 meant 12.\r\n\r\n  [798] Wellington wrongly guessed Plasencia: it was Aranjuez.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding much useful help it was still a marvellous feat of\r\nScovell to work out by the end of 1812 no less than _nine hundred_\r\nseparate cipher-numbers, ranging in complexity from the simple vowel\r\na to the symbol that represented ‘train des équipages militaires’! He\r\nmust have had a most ingenious brain, and unlimited patience. Down\r\nto the end there remained numbers of unsolved riddles, figures that\r\nrepresented persons or places so unfrequently mentioned that there was\r\nno way of discovering, by comparison between several documents, what\r\nthe number was likely to mean.\r\n\r\nSometimes very small fish came into the net of the guerrilleros,\r\nand were sent on to Wellington; take, for example, the tiny scrap\r\ncontaining the pathetic letter of the young wife of General Merlin, of\r\nthe cavalry of the Army of the Centre--I fear that the bearer must have\r\nfallen into the hands of Julian Sanchez or one of his lieutenants, and\r\nhave had short shrift:--\r\n\r\n‘Mon cher Ami,--Depuis ton départ je n’ai reçu qu’un seul mot de\r\ntoi--pendant qu’il arrive des courriers (c’est-à-dire des paysans)\r\ndu quartier général. Mon oncle qui écrit régulièrement dit toujours\r\nqu’on se porte bien, mais tu peux te mettre à ma place! Je crains que\r\nta goutte ne soit revenue, je crains tant de choses, qui peut-être\r\npassent le sens commun, mais qui me tourmentent. Je ne dors plus, et\r\nn’ai d’autre plaisir que celui de regarder ma fille, qui se porte\r\nbien. Encore si elle pouvait m’entendre et me consoler! Adieu! Je\r\nsuis d’une tristesse insupportable, parce que je t’aime plus que\r\nmoi-même.--Mercédes.’\r\n\r\nIt may suffice to show the general character of a typical\r\ncipher-dispatch if we give a few lines of one, with the interpretation\r\nadded below--the following comes from a dispatch of Marmont written on\r\nApril 22, 1812, to Berthier, from Fuente Guinaldo:--\r\n\r\n  Le roi après m’avoir donné l’ordre\r\n\r\n  1060 462  810  195 1034   1282\r\n   de faire par- tir deux divisions\r\n\r\n  971  216  13  192 614  20  90  92\r\n   et  plus de  la  moi- ti- é  de la\r\n\r\n    1265    582  637 851 809  388  177\r\n  cavalerie dis- po- ni- ble,  et avoir\r\n\r\n  669 112 923 2  786   692   1102\r\n  ré- du-  it à douze mille hommes\r\n\r\n  le nombre de troupes que j’ai disponible m’ordonne\r\n\r\n  13   1040   1003  370 860      400       817  69 862 718 1100\r\n  de chercher   à  pren-dre Ciudad Rodrigo lors que je  ne  ai\r\n\r\n  423 815  591  710  850\r\n  pas un  canon  de siège!\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that of all the words only _partir_, _moitié_,\r\n_disponible_, _réduit_, _prendre_, required to be spelled out in the\r\nsyllabary: single fixed numbers existing for all the common words, and\r\nfor the military terms _siège_, _cavalerie_, and _division_.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, only by degrees that Scovell succeeded in making out\r\nthe bulk of the French phrases. In Wellington’s dispatches there is\r\noften, during the spring and summer of 1812, an allusion to information\r\nonly partly comprehensible, obtained from captured letters. On June 18\r\n(_Dispatches_, ix. p. 241) Wellington writes to Lord Liverpool that he\r\n‘is not able entirely to decipher’ the intercepted papers that have\r\nbeen passing between King Joseph and Soult and Marmont. On June 25th\r\nhe sends to the same recipient the happy intelligence that he has now\r\nthe key to King Joseph’s cipher. Yet again, on July 16th (_Dispatches_,\r\nix. p. 290)--with No. 36 of the file catalogued below before him--he\r\nsays: ‘I have this day got a letter from the King to Marmont of the\r\n9th inst. in cipher, which I cannot entirely decipher: it appears,\r\nhowever, that he thinks Drouet will not cross the Tagus, and I suspect\r\nhe orders General Treillard to collect some troops in the valley of\r\nthe Tagus, and to move on Plasencia.’ The interpretation was correct,\r\nsave that Treillard was to move not on Plasencia but on Aranjuez. The\r\ncode-numbers for the two places were neither of them known as yet. But\r\nby September all essential words were discovered, and Wellington could\r\ncomprehend nearly everything, unless Joseph or Soult was writing of\r\nobscure places or distant generals.\r\n\r\nA list of the whole of Scovell’s file of 52 French dispatches may be\r\nuseful: those whose number is marked with a star are wholly or partly\r\nin cipher, the remaining minority are in plain French without disguise.\r\nIt is clear that Wellington had many more French papers not in cipher,\r\nwhich did not get into Scovell’s portfolio.\r\n\r\n         _Date._    _Sender._    _Recipient._      _Contents._\r\n  1.

Cleeves’s (No. 2)\r\ncompanies were doing garrison duty in the Lisbon forts; but Rettberg\r\nhimself, with a detachment of two officers and thirty men of his\r\ncompany, came up to the siege of Badajoz in March-April.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

Braun’s 9-pounder [from the 2nd regiment] batteries, both\r\nattached to General Hamilton’s Portuguese division, which always acted\r\nwith Hill in Estremadura, and Major S. J. de Arriaga’s 24-pounder\r\nhowitzer battery, which formed part of the Artillery Reserve, and\r\naccompanied Wellington’s own army to Badajoz, Salamanca, and Burgos.\r\nThis company came from the 1st (Lisbon) regiment.\r\n\r\nBut in addition the 2nd or Algarve regiment supplied one company, under\r\nCaptain J. C. Pereira do Amaral for the siege of Badajoz.\r\n\r\nThe 4th or Oporto regiment gave two companies (200 men) under Captain\r\nJ. V. Miron for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, and one (70 men) under\r\nCaptain William Cox for the siege of Badajoz.
