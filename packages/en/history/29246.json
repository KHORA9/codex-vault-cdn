NEW-YORK, MAY 1, 1851. No. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILKINS KENDALL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have here a capital portrait of the editor in chief of the New\r\nOrleans _Picayune_, GEORGE W. KENDALL, who, as an editor, author,\r\ntraveller, or _bon garçon_, is world-famous, and every where entitled to\r\nbe chairman in assemblies of these several necessary classes of people.\r\nTake him for all in all, he may be described as a new Chevalier Bayard,\r\nbaptized in the spirit of fun, and with a steel pen in lieu of a blade\r\nof Damascus. He is a Vermonter--of the state which has sent out Orestes\r\nBrownson, Herman Hooker, the Coltons, Hiram Powers, Hannah Gould, and a\r\ncrowd of other men and women with the sharpest intellects, and for the\r\nmost part the genialist tempers too, that can be found in all the\r\ncountry. His boyhood was passed in the delightful village of Burlington,\r\nfrom which, when he was of age, he came to New-York, and here he lived\r\nuntil about the year 1835, when he went to New Orleans, where his\r\nsubsequent career may be found traced in the most witty and brilliant\r\nand altogether successful journal ever published in the southern or\r\nwestern states.\r\n\r\nPartly for the love of adventure and partly for advantage to his health,\r\nin the spring of 1841 Mr. Kendall determined to make an excursion into\r\nthe great south-western prairies, and the contemplated trading\r\nexpedition to Santa-Fe offering escort and agreeable companions, he\r\nprocured passports from the Mexican vice-consul at New-Orleans, and\r\njoined it, at Austin. The history of this expedition has become an\r\nimportant portion of the history of the nation, and its details,\r\nembracing an account of his own captivity and sufferings in Mexico, were\r\nwritten by Mr. Kendall in one of the most spirited and graphic books of\r\nmilitary and wilderness adventure, vicissitude, and endurance, that has\r\nbeen furnished in our times. The work was published in two volumes, by\r\nthe Harpers, in 1844. It has since passed through many editions, and for\r\nthe fidelity and felicity, the bravery and _bon hommie_, that mark all\r\nits pages, it is likely to be one of the choicest chronicles that will\r\nbe quoted from our own in the new centuries.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of his narrative of the Santa Fe Expedition, Mr.\r\nKendall resumed his more immediate services in the _Picayane_--always,\r\nit may be said without injustice to his associates, most attractive\r\nunder his personal supervision; and in the angry and war-tending\r\ncontroversies with Mexico which filled the public mind in the succeeding\r\nyears, he was one of the calmest as well as wisest of our journalists.\r\nWhen at length the conflict came on, he attended the victorious Taylor\r\nas a member of his staff along the mountains and valleys which that\r\ngreat commander marked with the names of immortal victories, and had\r\nmore than satisfaction for all griefs of his own in seeing the flag of\r\nhis country planted in every scene in which his country had been\r\ninsulted in his own person.\r\n\r\nUpon the conclusion of the war, Mr. Kendall commenced the preparation of\r\nthe magnificent work which has lately been published in this city by the\r\nAppletons, under the title of _The War between the United States and\r\nMexico, by George W. Kendall, illustrated by pictorial drawings by Carl\r\nNebel_. Mr. Nebel may be regarded as one of the best battle-painters\r\nliving. He accompanied Mr. Kendall during the war, and made his sketches\r\nwhile on the several fields where he had witnessed the movements of the\r\ncontending armies; and in all the accessories of scenery, costume, and\r\ngeneral effect, he has unquestionably been as successful as the actors\r\nin the drama admit him to have been in giving a vivid and just\r\nimpression of the distinguishing characteristics of each conflict. The\r\nsubjects of the plates are the Bombardment of Vera Cruz, the Battle of\r\nCerro Gordo, the Storming of Chepultepec, the Assault on Contreras, the\r\nBattle of Cherubusco, the Attack on Molino del Rey, General Scott's\r\nEntrance into Mexico, the Battle of Buena Vista, the Battle of Palo\r\nAlto, and the Capture of Monterey. In some cases, there are two\r\nrepresentations of the same scene, taken from different points of view.\r\nThese have all been reproduced in colored lithography by the best\r\nartists of Paris. The literary part of the work, comprising very careful\r\nand particular accounts of these events, is excellently written--so\r\ncompactly and perspicuously, with so thorough a knowledge and so pure a\r\ntaste, as to be deserving of applause among models in military history.\r\nMr. Kendall passed about two years in Europe for the purpose of\r\nsuperintending its publication, and its success must have amply\r\nsatisfied the most sanguine anticipations with which he entered upon its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nNew England is largely represented among the leading editors of the\r\nSouth and West, and it is a little remarkable that the two papers most\r\nconspicuous as representatives of the idiosyncrasies which most obtain\r\nin their respective states--the _Picayune_ and George D. Prentice's\r\n_Louisville Journal_--are conducted by men from sections most\r\nantagonistical in interest and feeling, men who have carried with them\r\nto their new homes and who still cherish there all the reciprocated\r\naffections by which they were connected with the North. When George W.\r\nKendall leaves New Orleans for his summer wandering in our more\r\ncomfortable and safe latitudes, an ovation of editors awaits him at\r\nevery town along the Mississippi, and, crossing the mountains, he is the\r\nmost popular member of the craft in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia,\r\nNew-York, or Boston--an evidence that the strifes of party may exist\r\nwithout any personal ill-feeling, if the editor never forgets in his own\r\nperson to sustain the character of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a truth, illustrated in daily experience, and yet rarely noted or\r\nacted upon, that, in all that concerns the appreciation of personal\r\ncharacter or ability, the instinctive impressions of a community are\r\nquicker in their action, more profoundly appreciant, and more reliable,\r\nthan the intellectual perceptions of the ablest men in the community.\r\nUpon all those subjects that are of moral apprehension, society seems to\r\npossess an intelligence of its own, infinitely sensitive in its\r\ndelicacy, and almost conclusive in the certainty of its determinations;\r\nindirect, and unconscious in its operation, yet unshunnable in sagacity,\r\nand as strong and confident as nature itself. The highest and finest\r\nqualities of human judgment seem to be in commission among the nation,\r\nor the race. It is by such a process, that whenever a true hero appears\r\namong mankind, the recognition of his character, by the general sense of\r\nhumanity, is instant and certain: the belief of the chief priests and\r\nrulers of mind follows later, or comes not at all. The perceptions of a\r\npublic are as subtly-sighted as its passions are blind. It sees, and\r\nfeels, and knows the excellence, which it can neither understand, nor\r\nexplain, nor vindicate. These involuntary opinions of people at large\r\nexplain themselves, and are vindicated by events, and form at last the\r\nconstants of human understanding. A character of the first order of\r\ngreatness, such as seems to pass out of the limits and courses of\r\nordinary life, often lies above the ken of intellectual judgment; but\r\nits merits and its infirmities never escape the sleepless perspicacity\r\nof the common sentiment, which no novelty of form can surprise, and no\r\nmixture of qualities can perplex. The mind--the logical\r\nfaculty--comprehends a subject, when it can trace in it the same\r\nelements, or relations, which it is familiar with elsewhere; if it finds\r\nbut a faint analogy of form or substance, its decision is embarrassed.\r\nBut this other instinct seems to become subtler, and more rapid, and\r\nmore absolute in conviction, at the line where reason begins to falter.\r\n\r\nTake the case of Shakspeare. His surpassing greatness was never\r\nacknowledged by the learned, until the nation had ascertained and\r\nsettled it as a foregone and questionless conclusion. Even now, to the\r\nmost sagacious mind of this time, the real ground and evidence of its\r\nown assurance of Shakspeare's supremacy, is the universal, deep,\r\nimmovable conviction of it in the public feeling. There have been many\r\nacute essays upon his minor characteristics; but intellectual criticism\r\nhas never grappled with Shaksperian ART in its entireness and grandeur,\r\nand probably it never will. We know not now wherein his greatness\r\nconsists. We cannot demonstrate it. There is less indistinctness in the\r\nmerit of less eminent authors. Those things which are not doubts to our\r\nconsciousness, are yet mysteries to our mind. And if this is true of\r\nliterary art, which is so much within the sphere of reflection, it may\r\nbe expected to find more striking illustration in great practical and\r\npublic moral characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATIONAL MONUMENT AT WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThese considerations occur naturally to the mind in contemplating the\r\nfame of Washington. An attentive examination of the whole subject, and\r\nof all that can contribute to the formation of a sound opinion, results\r\nin the belief that General Washington's _mental_ abilities illustrate\r\nthe very highest type of greatness. His _mind_, probably, was one of the\r\nvery greatest that was ever given to mortality. Yet it is impossible to\r\nestablish that position by a direct analysis of his character, or\r\nconduct, or productions. When we look at the incidents or the results of\r\nthat great career--when we contemplate the qualities by which it is\r\nmarked, from its beginning to its end--the foresight which never was\r\nsurprised, the judgment which nothing could deceive, the wisdom whose\r\nresources were incapable of exhaustion--combined with a spirit as\r\nresolute in its official duties as it was moderate in its private\r\npretensions, as indomitable in its public temper as it was gentle in its\r\npersonal tone--we are left in wonder and reverence. But when we would\r\nenter into the recesses of that mind--when we would discriminate upon\r\nits construction, and reason upon its operations--when we would tell how\r\nit was composed, and why it excelled--we are entirely at fault. The\r\nprocesses of Washington's understanding are entirely hidden from us.\r\nWhat came from it, in counsel or in action, was the life and glory of\r\nhis country; what went on within it, is shrouded in impenetrable\r\nconcealment. Such elevation in degree of wisdom, amounts almost to a\r\nchange of kind, in nature, and detaches his intelligence from the\r\nsympathy of ours. We cannot see him as he was, because we are not like\r\nhim. The tones of the mighty bell were heard with the certainty of Time\r\nitself, and with a force that vibrates still upon the air of life, and\r\nwill vibrate for ever. But the clock-work, by which they were regulated\r\nand given forth, we can neither see nor understand. In fact, his\r\nintellectual abilities did not exist in an analytical and separated\r\nform; but in a combined and concrete state. They \"moved altogether when\r\nthey moved at all.\" They were in no degree speculative, but only\r\npractical. They could not act at all in the region of imagination, but\r\nonly upon the field of reality. The sympathies of his intelligence dwelt\r\nexclusively in the national being and action. Its interests and energies\r\nwere absorbed in them. He was nothing out of that sphere, because he was\r\nevery thing there. The extent to which he was identified with the\r\ncountry is unexampled in the relations of individual men to the\r\ncommunity. During the whole period of his life he was the thinking part\r\nof the nation. He was its mind; it was his image and illustration. If we\r\nwould classify and measure him, it must be with nations and not with\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary nature of Washington's capacities--this impossibility\r\nof analyzing and understanding the elements and methods of his\r\nwisdom--have led some persons to doubt whether, intellectually, he was\r\nof great superiority; but the public--the community--never doubted of\r\nthe transcendent eminence of Washington's abilities. From the first\r\nmoment of his appearance as the chief, the recognition of him, from one\r\nend of the country to the other, as THE MAN--the leader, the counsellor,\r\nthe infallible in suggestion and in conduct--was immediate and\r\nuniversal. From that moment to the close of the scene, the national\r\nconfidence in his capacity was as spontaneous, as enthusiastic, as\r\nimmovable, as it was in his integrity. Particular persons, affected by\r\nthe untoward course of events, sometimes questioned his sufficiency; but\r\nthe nation never questioned it, nor would allow it to be questioned.\r\nNeither misfortune, nor disappointment, nor accidents, nor delay, nor\r\nthe protracted gloom of years, could avail to disturb the public trust\r\nin him. It was apart from circumstances; it was beside the action of\r\ncaprice; it was beyond all visionary, and above all changeable feelings.\r\nIt was founded on nothing extraneous; not upon what he had said or done,\r\nbut upon what he was. They saw something in the man, which gave them\r\nassurance of a nature and destiny of the highest elevation--something\r\ninexplicable, but which inspired a complete satisfaction. We feel that\r\nthis reliance was wise and right; but why it was felt, or why it was\r\nright, we are as much to seek as those who came under the direct\r\nimpression of his personal presence. It is not surprising, that the\r\nworld, recognizing in this man a nature and a greatness which philosophy\r\ncannot explain, should revere him almost to religion.\r\n\r\nThe distance and magnitude of those objects which are too far above us\r\nto be estimated directly--such as stars--are determined by their\r\nparallax. By some process of that kind we may form an approximate notion\r\nof Washington's greatness. We may measure him against the great events\r\nin which he moved; and against the great men, among whom, and above\r\nwhom, his figure stood like a tower. It is agreed that the war of\r\nAmerican Independence is one of the most exalted, and honorable, and\r\ndifficult achievements related in history. Its force was contributed by\r\nmany; but its grandeur was derived from Washington. His character and\r\nwisdom gave unity, and dignity, and effect to the irregular, and often\r\ndivergent enthusiasm of others. His energy combined the parts; his\r\nintelligence guided the whole: his perseverance, and fortitude, and\r\nresolution, were the inspiration and support of all. In looking back\r\nover that period, his presence seems to fill the whole scene; his\r\ninfluence predominates throughout; his character is reflected from every\r\nthing. Perhaps nothing less than his immense weight of mind could have\r\nkept the national system, at home, in that position which it held,\r\nimmovably, for seven years; perhaps nothing but the august\r\nrespectability which his demeanor threw around the American cause\r\nabroad, would have induced a foreign nation to enter into an equal\r\nalliance with us, upon terms that contributed in a most important degree\r\nto our final success, or would have caused Great Britain to feel that no\r\ngreat indignity was suffered in admitting the claim to national\r\nexistence of a people who had such a representative as Washington. What\r\nbut the most eminent qualities of mind and feeling--discretion\r\nsuperhuman--readiness of invention, and dexterity of means, equal to the\r\nmost desperate affairs--endurance, self-control, regulated ardor,\r\nrestrained passion, caution mingled with boldness, and all the\r\ncontrarieties of moral excellence--could have expanded the life of an\r\nindividual into a career such as this?\r\n\r\nIf we compare him with the great men who were his contemporaries\r\nthroughout the nation; in an age of extraordinary personages, Washington\r\nwas unquestionably the first man of the time in ability. Review the\r\ncorrespondence of General Washington--that sublime monument of\r\nintelligence and integrity--scrutinize the public history and the public\r\nmen of that era, and you will find that in all the wisdom that was\r\naccomplished was attempted, Washington was before every man in his\r\nsuggestions of the plan, and beyond every one in the extent to which he\r\ncontributed to its adoption. In the field, all the able generals\r\nacknowledged his superiority, and looked up to him with loyalty,\r\nreliance, and reverence; the others, who doubted his ability, or\r\nconspired against his sovereignty, illustrated, in their own conduct,\r\ntheir incapacity to be either his judges or his rivals. In the state,\r\nAdams, Jay, Rutledge, Pinckney, Morris--these are great names; but there\r\nis not one whose wisdom does not vail to his. His superiority was felt\r\nby all these persons, and was felt by Washington himself, as a simple\r\nmatter of fact, as little a subject of question, or a cause of vanity,\r\nas the eminence of his personal stature. His appointment as\r\ncommander-in-chief, was the result of no design on his part, and of no\r\nefforts on the part of his friends; it seemed to take place\r\nspontaneously. He moved into the position, because there was a vacuum\r\nwhich no other could supply: in it, he was not sustained by government,\r\nby a party, nor by connections; he sustained himself, and then he\r\nsustained every thing else. He sustained Congress against the army, and\r\nthe army against the injustice of Congress. The brightest mind among his\r\ncontemporaries was Hamilton's; a character which cannot be contemplated\r\nwithout frequent admiration, and constant affection. His talents took\r\nthe form of genius, which Washington's did not. But active, various, and\r\nbrilliant, as the faculties of Hamilton were, whether viewed in the\r\nprecocity of youth, or in the all-accomplished elegance of maturer\r\nlife--lightning quick as his intelligence was to see through every\r\nsubject that came before it, and vigorous as it was in constructing the\r\nargumentation by which other minds were to be led, as upon a shapely\r\nbridge, over the obscure depths across which his had flashed in a\r\nmoment--fertile and sound in schemes, ready in action, splendid in\r\ndisplay, as he was--nothing is more obvious and certain than that when\r\nMr. Hamilton approached Washington, he came into the presence of one who\r\nsurpassed him in the extent, in the comprehension, the elevation, the\r\nsagacity, the force, and the ponderousness of his mind, as much as he\r\ndid in the majesty of his aspect, and the grandeur of his step. The\r\ngenius of Hamilton was a flower, which gratifies, surprises, and\r\nenchants; the intelligence of Washington was a stately tree, which in\r\nthe rarity and true dignity of its beauty is as superior, as it is in\r\nits dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAVE OF WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOGARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great comedian in pictorial art forms one of the subjects of Mrs.\r\nHall's sketches, in the _Pilgrimages to English Shrines_, and we think\r\nher article upon visiting his tomb as interesting as any in this popular\r\nseries:\r\n\r\nHogarth, the great painter-teacher of his age and country, was born in\r\nthe parish of St. Bartholomew the Great, in London, on the 10th of\r\nNovember, 1697, and his trusty and sympathizing biographer, Allan\r\nCunningham, says, \"we have the authority of his own manuscripts for\r\nbelieving he was baptized on the 28th of the same month;\" but the parish\r\nregisters have been examined for confirmation with \"fruitless\r\nsolicitude.\" Cunningham gives December as the month of his birth; this\r\nis a mistake; so also is his notice of the painter's introduction of the\r\nVirago into his picture of the \"Modern Midnight Conversation.\" No female\r\nfigure appears in this subject. It is in the third plate of the \"Rake's\r\nProgress\" the woman alluded to is introduced. A small critic might here\r\nfind a fit subject for vituperation, and loudly condemn Cunningham as a\r\nwriter who was too idle to examine the works he was describing; pouncing\r\non his minute errors, and forgetting the totality of his generous\r\nlabors. Much of this spirit infests literature; and merges the kindly\r\nexposition of error into the bitterness of personal attack. The\r\nfallibility of human nature should teach us charity, and our own faults\r\nlead us to \"more gently scan our brother man,\"--a thing too often\r\nunthought of by those who are nothing if not critical, and as frequently\r\nnothing when they are. The painter was descended from a Westmoreland\r\nfamily. Sprung from an industrious race of self-helping yeomen, whose\r\nhardy toil brought them health and contentment, Hogarth had an early\r\nadvantage, derived from his father's love of letters, which eventually\r\ndrew him away from field and wood to the great London mart. Like\r\nthousands of others, he was unsuccessful. Fortunately, in this instance,\r\nhis want of success in literature stimulated the strong mind of his son\r\nto seek occupation of more certain profit; and those who feel interest\r\nin the whereabouts of celebrated men, may think upon the days when\r\nWilliam Hogarth wrought in silver, as the apprentice of Ellis Gamble, in\r\nCranbourne Street, and speculate upon the change of circumstances,\r\nwrought by his own exertions, when, as a great painter, in after time,\r\nhe occupied the house, now known as the Sabloniere Hotel, in Leicester\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nHogarth's character of mind, evidenced in his works and proved by his\r\nbiography, is so perfectly honest, open, home-bred English, that we\r\nclaim him with pride--as belonging exclusively to England. His\r\noriginality is of English growth; his satire broad, bold, fair-play\r\nEnglish. He was no screened assassin of character, either with pen or\r\npencil; no journalist's hack to stab in secret--concealing his name, or\r\nassuming a forged one; no masked caricaturist, responsible to none. His\r\nphilosophy was of the straightforward, clear-sighted English school; his\r\ntheories--stern, simple, and unadorned--thoroughly English; his\r\ndetermination--proved in his love as well as in his hate--quite English;\r\nthere is a firmness of purpose, a rough dignity, a John-Bull look in his\r\nbroad intelligent face; the very fur round his cap must have been plain\r\nEnglish rabbit-skin! No matter what \"schools\" were in fashion, Hogarth\r\ncreated and followed his own; no matter what was done, or said, or\r\nwritten, Hogarth maintained his opinion unflinchingly; he was not to be\r\nmoved or removed from his resolve. His mind was vigorous and inflexible,\r\nand withal, keen and acute; and though the delicacy of his taste in this\r\nmore refined age may be matter of question, there can be no doubt as to\r\nhis integrity and uprightness of purpose--in his determination to\r\ndenounce vice, and by that means cherish virtue.\r\n\r\nProfessor Leslie, in his eloquent and valuable Lectures on Painting,\r\ndelivered in the spring of the present year to the students of the Royal\r\nAcademy, has nobly vindicated Hogarth as an artist and a man, in words\r\nthat all who heard will long remember. \"Hogarth,\" he said, \"it is true,\r\nis often gross; but it must be remembered that he painted in a less\r\nfastidious age than ours, and that his great object was to expose vice.\r\n_Debauchery is always made by him detestable, never attractive._\"\r\nCharles Lamb, one of the best of his commentators, who has viewed his\r\nlabors in a kindred spirit, speaking of one of his most elaborate and\r\nvaried works, the \"Election Entertainment,\" asks, \"What is the result\r\nleft on the mind? Is it an impression of the vileness and worthlessness\r\nof our species? Or is not the general feeling which remains after the\r\nindividual faces have ceased to act sensibly on the mind, _a kindly one\r\nin favor of the species_?\" Leslie speaks of his \"high species of humor,\r\npregnant with moral meanings,\" and no happier choice of phrase could\r\ncharacterize his many works. Lamb, with true discrimination, says: \"All\r\nlaughter is not of a dangerous or soul-hardening tendency. There is the\r\npetrifying sneer of a demon, which excludes and kills love, and there is\r\nthe cordial laughter of a man, which implies and cherishes it.\"\r\n\r\nHogarth's works are before us all; and are lessons as much for to-day as\r\nthey were for yesterday. We have no intention of scrutinizing their\r\nmerits or defects; we write only of the influence of a class of art such\r\nas he brought courageously before the English public. Every one is\r\nacquainted with the \"Rake's Progress,\" and can recall subject after\r\nsubject, story after story, which he illustrated. Comparatively few can\r\njudge of him as a painter, but all can comprehend his moral\r\nessays--brave as true!\r\n\r\nHis fearlessness and earnestness are above all price; independent, in\r\ntheir high estate, of all praise. We would send \"Marriage à la Mode\"\r\ninto general circulation during the London season, where the market for\r\nwives and husbands is presided over by interest rather than affection.\r\nThe matrimonial mart was as bravely exposed by the great satirist, as\r\nthe brutal and unmanly cock-fight, which at that period was permitted to\r\ntake place at the Cock-pit _Royal_, on the south side of St. James's\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nSociety always needs such men as William Hogarth--true, stern men--to\r\ngrapple with and overthrow the vices which spring up--the very weeds\r\nboth of poverty and luxury,--the latter filled with the more bitter and\r\nsubtle poison. Calling to mind the period, we the more honor the great\r\nartist's resolution; if the delicacy of our improved times is offended\r\nby what may seem deformity upon his canvas, we must remember that we do\r\nnot shrink from _Hogarth's_ coarseness, but from the coarseness he\r\nlabored, by exposing, to expel. He painted what Smollett, and Fielding,\r\nand Richardson wrote far more offensively; but he surpassed the\r\nnovelists both in truth and in intention. He painted without\r\nsympathizing with his subjects, whom he lashed with unsparing bitterness\r\nor humor. He never idealized a vice into a virtue--he never compromised\r\na fact, much less a principle.\r\n\r\nHe has, indeed, written fearful sermons on his canvas; sermons which,\r\nhowever exaggerated they may seem to us in some of their painful details\r\nof human sin and human misery, are yet so real, that we never doubt that\r\nsuch things _were_, and _are_. No one can suspect Hogarth to have been\r\ntainted by the vices he exposed. In this he has the advantage of the\r\nnovelists of his period: he gives vice no loophole of escape: it is\r\nthere in its hideous aspect, each step distinctly marked, each character\r\ntelling its own tale of warning, so that \"he who runs may read.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever desires to trace the life of this English artist--to note him in\r\nhis apprenticeship--when he tamed as well as his rough nature would\r\npermit, his hand to the delicate graving so cherished by his master,\r\nEllis Gamble; and when freed from his apprenticeship, he sought art\r\nthrough the stirring scenes of life, saying quaintly enough, that\r\n\"copying other men's works resembled pouring wine out of one vessel into\r\nanother; there was no increase of quantity, and the flavor of the\r\nvintage was liable to evaporate;\"--whoever would study the great, as\r\nwell as the small, peculiarities of the painter who converted his\r\nthumb-nail into a palette, and while transcribing characters and events\r\nboth rapidly and faithfully, complained of his \"constitutional\r\nidleness:\"--whenever, we say, our readers feel desirous of revelling in\r\nthe biography of so diligent, so observing, so faithful, so brave a\r\nspirit, we should send them to our old friend Allan Cunningham's most\r\ninteresting history of the man. Honest Allan had much in common with our\r\ngreat national artist: though of different countries, they sprung from\r\nthe same race--sturdy yeomen; they were alike lovers of independence,\r\nfighting for the best part of life manfully and faithfully enjoying the\r\nnoble scorn of wrong, and battling for the right from the cradle to the\r\ngrave. Self-educated--that is to say, educated by Nature, which gave and\r\nnourished his high intellect and independent soul--Allan could\r\ncomprehend and appreciate the manly bearing and stern self-reliance of\r\nthe painter, whose best resources were in himself; thus the biography of\r\nHogarth is among the finest examples of its class which our language\r\nsupplies. Allan's sympathies were with his subject; and his knowledge\r\nalso came to his aid: for the poet was thoroughly imbued with a love of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nAllan Cunningham was a better disciplinarian, and less prone to look for\r\nor care for enjoyment, than Hogarth; though we have many pleasant\r\nmemories how he truly relished both music and conversation. But there\r\nwas more sentiment in the Scottish poet than in the English painter; and\r\nthe deep dark eyes of the Scot had more of fervor and less of sarcasm in\r\ntheir brightness. We repeat, Allan, of all writers, could thoroughly\r\nappreciate Hogarth; and his biography is written _con amore_. He says\r\nthat \"all who love the dramatic representations of actual life,--all who\r\nhave hearts to be gladdened by humor,--all who are pleased with\r\njudicious and well-directed satire,--all who are charmed with the\r\nludicrous looks of popular folly, and all who can be moved with the\r\npathos of human suffering, are admirers of Hogarth.\" But to our\r\nthinking; Hogarth had a calling even more elevated than the Scottish\r\npoet has given him in this eloquent summing-up of his attributes; \"he is\r\none of our greatest teachers--a TEACHER to whom is due the _highest_\r\npossible honor; and the more we feel the importance of the teacher, the\r\nmore we value those who teach well. In grappling with folly and in\r\ncombating with crimes, he was compelled to reveal the nature of that he\r\nproposed to satirize; he was obliged to set up sin in its high place\r\nbefore he could crown it with infamy.\" The times were full of internal\r\nas well as foreign disturbance, and Hogarth's studio was no hermitage to\r\nexclude passing events or their promoters. He lived with the living,\r\nmoving _present_,--his engravings being his pleasures; portraits, as\r\nthey are now to many a high-hearted man of talent, his means of\r\nsubsistence; heavy weights of mortality that fetter and clog the\r\nascending spirit.\r\n\r\nHis controversies and encounters with the worthless Wilkes,--his defence\r\nof his own theories,--his determined dislike to the establishment of a\r\nRoyal Academy--his various other controversies--rendered his exciting\r\ncourse very different from that of the lonely artists of the present\r\nday, who are but too fond of living in closed studios, \"pouring,\" as\r\nHogarth would have said,--\"pouring wine from one vessel into\r\nanother,\"--pondering over tales and poems for inspiration, and\r\ntranscribing the worn-out models of many seasons into attitudes of\r\nbounding and varied life! Is it not wonderful, as sad, that the artist\r\nwill not feel his power, will not take his own place, assume his high\r\nstanding as of old, and demand the duty of respect from the world by the\r\njust exercise of his glorious privilege! \"Entertainment and information\r\nare not all the mind requires at the hand of an artist; we wish to be\r\nelevated by contemplating what is noble,--to be warmed, by the presence\r\nof the heroic,--and charmed and made happy by the light of purity and\r\nloveliness. We desire to share in the lofty movements of fine minds--to\r\nhave communion with their image of what is godlike, and to take a part\r\nin the rapture of their love, and in the ecstasies of all their musings.\r\nThis is the chief end of high poetry, of high painting, and high\r\nsculpture; and the man misunderstands the true spirit of those arts who\r\nseeks to deprive them of a portion of their divinity, and argues that\r\nentertainment and information constitute their highest aim.\" We have\r\nquoted this passage because it expresses our notions of the power of art\r\nmore happily than we are able to express it; but we must add that the\r\n_teaching_ as well as the _poetic_ painter has much to complain of from\r\nsociety; it is impossible to mingle among the \"higher classes\" without\r\nbeing struck by their indifference to every phase of British\r\nart,--except portraiture. \"Have you been to the Exhibition? Are there\r\nmany nice miniatures? are the portraits good? Lady D.'s lace is perfect;\r\nMrs. A.'s velvet is inimitable.\" Such observations strike the ear with\r\npainful discord, when the mind is filled with memories of those who are\r\nbrave or independent enough to \"look forward\" with creative genius.\r\nThere are many noble exceptions among our aristocracy; but with far too\r\ngreat a number art is a mere fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAs a people, neither our eyes nor our ears are yet opened to its\r\ninstructive and elevating faculty. We mistake the outlay of money for an\r\nexpenditure of sympathy.\r\n\r\nHogarth's portraits were almost too faithful to please his sitters: he\r\nwas too truthful to flatter, even on canvas; and the wonder is that he\r\nachieved any popularity in this fantastic branch of his art. Allan\r\nCunningham has said of him, that he regarded neither the historian's\r\npage, nor the poet's song. He was contented with the occurrences of the\r\npassing day, with the folly or the sin of the hour; yet to the garb and\r\nfashion of the moment, he adds story and sentiment for all time. It is\r\nquite delicious to read the excuses Allan makes for the foibles of the\r\nman whose virtues had touched his own generous heart; he confesses with\r\ngreat _naiveté_ that he looked coldly--\"too coldly, perhaps\"--on foreign\r\nart, and perhaps too fondly on his own productions; and then adds that,\r\n\"where vanity soonest misleads the judgment he thought wisely; he\r\ncontemplated his own works, not as things excellent in themselves, but\r\nas the rudiments of future excellence, and looked forward with the hope\r\nthat some happier Hogarth would raise, on the foundation he had laid, a\r\nperfect and lasting superstructure.\"\r\n\r\nWe must humbly differ from the poet in this matter; we believe, if the\r\ncharacteristic cap were removed from that sturdy brow, we should find an\r\nadmirable development of the organ of self-esteem. He thought as little\r\nof a future and \"happier Hogarth,\" as he did of the old masters. He was\r\nMonarch of the Present--and he knew it!\r\n\r\nThe age we live in talks much about renovation, but it is not a\r\nconservative age; on the contrary, it would pull down Temple Bar, if it\r\ndared, to widen the passage from the Strand into Fleet Street; and it\r\ndemolishes houses, shrines of _noble memories_, with a total absence of\r\nrespect for what it ought to honor. We never hear of an old house\r\nwithout a feeling that it is either going to be destroyed or modernized;\r\nand this inevitably leads to a desire to visit it immediately. Having\r\ndetermined on a drive to Chiswick to make acquaintance with the dwelling\r\nof Hogarth, and look upon his tomb--we became restless until it was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nWe had seen, by the courtesy of Mr. Allison, the piano-forte\r\nmanufacturer in Dean Street, the residence of Sir James Thornhill, whose\r\ndaughter Hogarth married: the proprietor bestows most praiseworthy care\r\non the house, which was formerly one of considerable extent and\r\nimportance. Mr. Allison says there can be little doubt that the grounds\r\nextended into Wardour Street. Once, while removing a chimney-piece in\r\nthe drawing-room, a number of cards tumbled out--slips of\r\nplaying-cards, with the names of some of the most distinguished persons\r\nof Hogarth's time written on the backs; the residences were also given,\r\nproving that the \"gentry\" then dwelt where now the poorer classes\r\ncongregate. But the most interesting part of the house is the staircase,\r\nwith its painted ceiling; the wall of the former is divided into three\r\ncompartments, each representing a sort of ball-room back-ground, with\r\ngroups of figures life-size, looking down from a balcony; they are well\r\npreserved, and one of the ladies is thought to be a very faithful\r\nportrait of Mrs. Hogarth. Hogarth must have spent some time in that\r\nhouse:--but we were resolved, despite the repute of its being old and\r\nugly, to visit his dwelling-place at Chiswick; and though we made the\r\npilgrimage by a longer _route_ than was necessary, we did not regret\r\nskirting the beautiful plantations of the Duke of Devonshire, nor\r\nenjoying the fragrance of the green meadows, which never seem so green\r\nto us, as in the vale of the Thames. The house is a tall, narrow,\r\nabrupt-looking place, close to the roadside wall of its inclosed garden;\r\nnumbers of cottage dwellings for the poor have sprung up around it, but\r\nin Hogarth's day it must have been very isolated: not leading to the\r\nwater, as we had imagined, but having a dull and prison-like aspect; if,\r\nindeed, any place can have that aspect where trees grow, and grass is\r\ncheckered by their ever-varying shadows. The house was occupied from\r\n1814 to 1832 by Cary, the translator of Dante; and it would be worth a\r\npilgrimage if considered only as the residence of this truly-excellent\r\nand highly-gifted clergyman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROOM IN HOGARTH'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nWe have received from his son an interesting note relative to its\r\nfeatures at the period when it came into his father's possession. \"The\r\nhouse,\" he says, \"stands in one corner of a high-walled garden of about\r\nthree quarters of an acre, that part of the garden which faced the house\r\nwas divided into long, narrow, formal flower-beds. Five large trees,\r\nwhose ages bespoke their acquaintance with Hogarth, showed his love of\r\nthe beautiful as well as the useful, a mulberry, walnut, apricot,\r\ndouble-blossomed cherry, and a hawthorn: the last of these was a great\r\nfavorite with my father, from its beauty, and the attraction it was to\r\nthe nightingale, which never failed to visit it in the spring: the\r\ngardeners were their mortal enemies, and alas, have at length prevailed.\r\nA few years ago, when I went to visit the old place, only one of the\r\ntrees remained, (the mulberry seen in our sketch); in a nook at one side\r\nof the garden was a nut-walk, with a high wall and a row of\r\nfilbert-trees that arched triumphantly over it; at one end of this walk\r\nwas a stone slab, on which Hogarth used to play at nine-pins; at the\r\nother end were the two little tombstones to the memory of a bird and a\r\ndog.\" The house is as you see it here, the rooms with low ceilings and\r\nall sorts of odd shapes,--up and down, in and out,--yet withal pleasant\r\nand comfortable, and rendered more so by the gentle courtesy of their\r\nmistress and her kindly servant; the very dogs seemed to partake of the\r\nhuman nature of their protector, and attended us wherever we went, with\r\nmore than ordinary civility. Hogarth might have been tempted to\r\nimmortalize one of them for its extreme ugliness, and the waggish spirit\r\nwith which it pulled at its companion's ears, who in vain attempted to\r\ntug at the bits of stumps that stuck out at either side of its\r\ntormentor's head. Mr. Fairholt was permitted to sketch the drawing room;\r\nthe open door leads to the chamber from whence, it is said, Miss\r\nThornhill eloped with Hogarth.\r\n\r\nMr. Cary, in the note to which we have already alluded, says, \"there can\r\nhardly be a doubt that the house belonged to Sir James Thornhill, and\r\nthat Hogarth inherited it from him. Mrs. Hogarth lived there after her\r\nhusband's death, and left it by will to a lady from whose executor my\r\nfather bought it in the year 1814. The room from which Miss Thornhill is\r\nsaid to have eloped is the inner room, on the first floor; this room was\r\nused by my father as his study. Over the dining-room fireplace was a\r\nspirited pencil sketch of five heads, and under them written 'five jolly\r\nfellows,' by Hogarth--during an absence the servants of a tenant\r\ncarefully washed all out.\"\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine how the union between Hogarth and his daughter,\r\ncommenced after such a fashion, outraged not only the courtliness, but\r\nthe higher and better feelings of Sir James Thornhill. Hogarth's innate\r\nconsciousness of power may at that time have appeared to him vulgar\r\neffrontery; and it is not to be wondered at, that, until convinced of\r\nhis talent, he refused him all assistance. There is something so false\r\nand wrong in the concealment that precedes an elopement, and the\r\nelopement of an only child from an aged father, that we marvel how any\r\none can treat lightly the outraged feelings of a confiding parent.\r\nEarnest tender love so deeply rooted in a father's heart may pardon, but\r\ncannot reach forgetfulness as quickly as it is the custom of\r\nplay-writers and novelists to tell us it may do.\r\n\r\nSir James Thornhill was greatly the fashion; he was the successor of\r\nVerrio, and the rival of La Guerre, in the decorations of our palaces\r\nand public buildings. His demands for the painting of Greenwich Hall\r\nwere contested; and though La Fosse received two thousand pounds for his\r\nworks at Montague House, besides other allowances, Sir James, despite\r\nhis dignity as Member of Parliament for his native town of Weymouth,\r\ncould obtain but forty shillings a square yard for painting the cupola\r\nof St. Paul's! Thus the patronage afforded \"native talent\" kept him\r\npoor; and though it must have been necessary (one of the cruel\r\nnecessities induced by love of display in England), to have an\r\nestablishment suited to his public position in London, nothing could be\r\nmore unpretending than his _ménage_ at Chiswick. Mrs. Hogarth, advised\r\nby her mother, skilfully managed to let her father see one of her\r\nhusband's best productions under advantageous circumstances. Sir James\r\nacknowledged its merit at once, exclaiming, \"Very well! very well! The\r\nman who can make works like this can maintain a wife without a portion;\"\r\nand soon after became not only reconciled, but generous to the young\r\npeople. Hogarth had tasted the bitterness of labor; he had even worked\r\nfor booksellers, and painted portraits!--so that this summer brightness\r\nmust have been full of enjoyment. He appreciated it thoroughly, and was\r\never the earnest admirer and the ready defender of Sir James Thornhill;\r\nthus the old knight secured a friend in his son; and it was pleasanter\r\nto think of the hours of reconciliation and happiness they might have\r\npassed within the walls of that inclosed garden, beneath the crumbling\r\ntrellice, or the shadow of the old mulberry tree, than of the\r\nfortuneless artist wooing the confiding daughter from her home and her\r\nfilial duties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH'S PAINTING-ROOM.]\r\n\r\nWe were invited to inspect Hogarth's painting-room--a mere loft, of most\r\nlimited dimensions, over the stable, which the imagination could easily\r\nfurnish with the necessary easel, or still less cumbrous graver's\r\nimplements. It is situated at the furthest part of the garden from the\r\nhouse; a small door in the garden-wall leads into a little inclosure,\r\none side of which is occupied by the stable. The painting-room is over\r\nthe stable, and is reached by a stair; it has but one window which looks\r\ntowards the road. It must have been sufficiently commodious for\r\nHogarth's purposes; but possesses not the conveniences of modern\r\npainting-rooms. The house at Chiswick could only have been a place for\r\nrecreation and repose, where relaxation was cared for, and where\r\nsketches were prepared to ripen into publication.\r\n\r\nThere are traditions about Chiswick of Hogarth having, while studying\r\nand taking notes, frequented a little inn by the roadside, and almost\r\nwithin sight of his dwelling. It has been modernized throughout--and\r\nsupplies no subject for the pencil--yet it retains some indications, not\r\nwithout interest, of a remote date. The Painter must have been familiar\r\nwith every class of character; and Chiswick was then enough of a country\r\nvillage to supply him amply with material. But, although a keen\r\nsatirist, it is certain that he had as much tenderness for the lower\r\norders of creation, as a young loving girl. In a corner of this quaint\r\nold garden, two tiny monuments are affixed to the wall, one chiselled\r\nperhaps by Hogarth's own hand, to the memory of his canary bird! The\r\n_thinking_ character of the painter's mind is evidenced in this as in\r\nevery thing he did--the engraving on the tomb suggesting reflection.\r\nCharles Lamb said of him truly, that the quantity of _thought_ which he\r\ncrowded into every picture, would alone \"_unvulgarize_\" every subject he\r\nmight choose; and the refined Coleridge exclaims, \"Hogarth! in whom the\r\nsatirist never extinguished that love of beauty which belonged to him as\r\na poet.\" There is something inexpressibly tender and touching in this\r\nmemento of his affection for a little singing bird: the feeling must\r\nhave been entirely his own, for he had no child to suggest the tribute\r\nto a feathered favorite. The tomb was afterwards accompanied with one to\r\nMrs. Hogarth's dog. They are narrow, upright pieces of white stone laid\r\nagainst the brick-wall, but they are records of gentle and generous\r\nsympathies not to be overlooked. That Hogarth was more than on friendly\r\nterms with the canine race, the introduction of his own dog into his\r\nportrait clearly tells, and doubtless his bird often brought with its\r\nmusic visions of the country into the heat and dust of Leicester\r\nSquare--soothing away much of his impatience. Men who have to fight the\r\nup-hill battle of life, must have energy and determination; and Hogarth\r\nwas too out-spoken and self-confident not to have made many enemies. In\r\nafter years his success (limited though it was, in a pecuniary point of\r\nview, for he died without leaving enough to support his widow\r\nrespectably), produced its ordinary results--envy and enmity: and\r\ninsults were heaped upon him. He was not tardy of reply, but Wilkes and\r\nChurchill were in strong health when nature was giving way with the\r\ngreat painter; an advantage they did not fail to use with their\r\naccustomed malignity. The profligate Churchill, turning the poet's\r\nnature into gall, infested the death-bed of Hogarth with unfeeling\r\nsarcasm, anticipating the grave, and exulting over a dying man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMBS OF DOG AND BIRD.]\r\n\r\nHogarth, warned by the autumn winds, and suffering from the restlessness\r\nof approaching dissolution, left Chiswick on the 25th of October, 1764,\r\nand returned to his residence in Leicester Square. He was cheerful--in\r\nfull possession of his mental faculties, but lacked the vigor to exert\r\nthem. The very next day, having received an agreeable letter from Doctor\r\nFranklin, he wrote a rough copy of his answer, but exhausted with the\r\neffort, retired to bed. Seized by a sudden sickness, he arose--rung the\r\nbell with alarming violence--and within two hours expired!\r\n\r\nOf all the villages in the neighborhood of London, rising from the banks\r\nof the Thames, (and how numerous and beautiful they are!) few are so\r\nwell known as that of Chiswick. The horticultural fêtes are anticipated\r\nwith anxiety similar to that our grandmothers felt for the fêtes of\r\nRanelagh; the _toilettes_ of the ladies rival the flowers, and the only\r\nfoe to the fascinating fair ones is the weather; but all which the crowd\r\ncare about in Chiswick is confined to the \"Duke's grounds\" and the\r\nSociety's Gardens. The Duke's beautiful little villa, erected by the\r\nlast Earl of Burlington, is indeed a shrine worthy of deep homage;\r\nwithin its walls both Charles James Fox and George Canning breathed\r\ntheir last; and if, for a moment, we recall the times of Civil War, when\r\neach honest English heart fought bravely and openly for what was\r\nbelieved \"the right,\" we may picture the struggle between Prince Rupert\r\nand the Earl of Essex, terminating with doubtful success, for eight\r\nhundred high born cavaliers were left dead on the plain that lies within\r\nsight of the gardens so richly perfumed by flowers, and echoing not to\r\nthe searching trumpet or rolling drum, but to the gossamer music of\r\nStrauss and Jullien.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire's grounds, containing about ninety acres, are\r\nfilled with mementos, pleasant to the eye and suggestive to the\r\nimagination; but we must seek and find a more solemn scene, where the\r\nchurchyard of Chiswick incloses the ashes of some whose names are\r\nwritten upon the pages of History. Though the church is, in a degree,\r\nsurrounded by houses, there is much of the repose of \"a country\r\nchurchyard\" about it; the Thames belts it with its silver girdle, and\r\nwhen we visited its sanctuary, the setting sun cast a mellow light upon\r\nthe windows of the church, touching a headstone or an urn, while the\r\nshadows trembled on the undulating graves. Like all church-yards it is\r\ncrowded, and however reverently we bent our footsteps, it was impossible\r\nto avoid treading on the soft grass of the humble grave, or the gray\r\nstone that marks the resting-place of one of \"the better order.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH'S TOMB.]\r\n\r\nHow like the world was that silent churchyard! High and low, rich and\r\npoor, mingled together, and yet avoiding to mingle. The dust of the\r\nimperious Duchess of Cleveland found here a grave; while here too, as if\r\nto contrast the pure with the impure, repose the ashes of Mary, daughter\r\nof Oliver Cromwell; Holland the actor, the friend of David Garrick, here\r\ncast aside his \"motley.\" Can we wonder at the actor's love of\r\napplause?--posterity knows him not; present fame alone is his--the\r\nlark's song leaves no record in the air!--Lord Macartney, the famous\r\nambassador to China, a country of which our knowledge was then almost as\r\ndim as that we have of the moon--the ambassador rests here, while a\r\nChinese junk is absolutely moored in the very river that murmurs beside\r\nhis grave! Surely the old place is worthy of a pilgrimage. Loutherbourg,\r\nthe painter, found a resting-place in its churchyard. Ralph, the\r\nhistorian and political writer, whose histories and politics are now as\r\nlittle read as the Dunciad which held them up to ridicule, is buried\r\nhere; and confined as is the space, it is rich in epitaphs,--three are\r\nfrom the pen of David Garrick, two from that of Arthur Murphy.\r\n\r\nHogarth's monument has been very faithfully copied by Mr. Fairholt.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable among the many plainer \"stones\" with which the\r\nchurchyard is crowded, but is by no means distinguished for that\r\nartistic character--which it might have received as covering the remains\r\nof so great an artist. A small slab, in relief, takes from it, however,\r\nthe charge of insipidity; it contains a comic mask, an oak branch,\r\npencils and mahl-stick, a book and a scroll, and the palette, marked\r\nwith the \"line of beauty.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that \"while he faithfully followed nature through\r\nall her varieties, and exposed, with inimitable skill, the infinite\r\nfollies and vices of the world, he was in himself an example of many\r\nvirtues.\" And the following poetical tribute by David Garrick is\r\ninscribed on the tomb:\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell! great painter of mankind,\r\n      Who reached the noblest point of Art;\r\n    Whose pictured morals charm the mind,\r\n      And through the eye correct the heart\r\n    If Genius fire thee, reader, stay;\r\n      If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;\r\n    If neither move thee, turn away,\r\n      For Hogarth's honored dust lies here!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson also composed an epitaph, which Cunningham considers \"more\r\nto the purpose, but still unworthy:\"\r\n\r\n    \"The hand of him here torpid lies,\r\n      That drew the essential forms of grace;\r\n    Here closed in death the attentive eyes\r\n      That saw the manners in the face.\"\r\n\r\nThe tributes--in poetry and prose--are just, examine the works of this\r\ngreat painter-teacher as closely and suspiciously as we may, we can\r\ndiscover nothing that will induce a momentary doubt of his integrity of\r\npurpose in all he did; his shafts were aimed at Vice,--in no solitary\r\ninstance was he ever guilty of arraigning or assailing Virtue. Compare\r\nhim with the most famous of the Dutch masters, and he rises into glory;\r\ncoarseness and vulgarity in them had no point out of which could come\r\ninstruction. If they picture the issues of their own minds, they must\r\nhave been gross and sensual; they ransacked the muck of life, and the\r\ngrovelling in character, for themes that one should see only by\r\ncompulsion. But Hogarth's subjects were never without a lesson, and,\r\ninasmuch as he resorted for them to the open volume of humanity, like\r\nthose of the most immortal of our writers, his works are \"not for an age\r\nbut for all time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of _The House of Seven Gables_ is now about forty-five years\r\nof age. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and is of a family which\r\nfor several generations has \"followed the sea.\" Among his ancestors, I\r\nbelieve, was the \"bold Hawthorne,\" who is celebrated in a revolutionary\r\nballad as commander of the \"Fair American.\" He was educated at Bowdoin\r\nCollege in Maine, where he graduated in 1825.\r\n\r\nProbably he appeared in print before that time, but his earliest volume\r\nwas an anonymous and never avowed romance which was published in Boston\r\nin 1832. It attracted little attention, but among those who read it with\r\na just appreciation of the author's genius was Mr. S. G. Goodrich, who\r\nimmediately secured the shrouded star for _The Token_, of which he was\r\neditor, and through which many of Hawthorne's finest tales and essays\r\nwere originally given to the public. He published in 1837 the first and\r\nin 1842 the second volume of his _Twice-Told Tales_, embracing whatever\r\nhe wished to preserve from his contributions to the magazines; in 1845\r\nhe edited _The Journal of an African Cruiser_; in 1846 published _Mosses\r\nfrom an Old Manse_, a second collection of his magazine papers; in 1850\r\n_The Scarlet Letter_, and in the last month the longest and in some\r\nrespects the most remarkable of his works, _The House of Seven Gables_.\r\n\r\nIn the introductions to the _Mosses from an Old Manse_ and _The Scarlet\r\nLetter_ we have some glimpses of his personal history. He had been\r\nseveral years in the Custom-House at Boston, while Mr. Bancroft was\r\ncollector, and afterwards had joined that remarkable association, the\r\n\"Brook Farm Community,\" at West Roxbury, where, with others, he appears\r\nto have been reconciled to the old ways, as quite equal to the\r\ninventions of Fourier, St. Simon, Owen, and the rest of that ingenious\r\ncompany of schemers who have been so intent upon a reconstruction of the\r\nfoundations of society. In 1843, he went to reside in the pleasant\r\nvillage of Concord, in the \"Old Manse,\" which had never been profaned by\r\na lay occupant until he entered it as his home. In the introduction to\r\n_The Mosses_ he says:\r\n\r\n     \"A priest had built it; a priest had succeeded to it; other\r\n     priestly men, from time to time, had dwelt in it; and children,\r\n     born in its chambers, had grown up to assume the priestly\r\n     character. It was awful to reflect how many sermons must have\r\n     been written there. The latest inhabitant alone--he, by whose\r\n     translation to Paradise the dwelling was left vacant--had\r\n     penned nearly three thousand discourses, besides the better, if\r\n     not the greater number, that gushed living from his lips. How\r\n     often, no doubt, had he paced to and fro along the avenue,\r\n     attuning his meditations, to the sighs and gentle murmurs, and\r\n     deep and solemn peals of the wind, among the lofty tops of the\r\n     trees! In that variety of natural utterances, he could find\r\n     something accordant with every passage of his sermon, were it\r\n     of tenderness or reverential fear. The boughs over my head\r\n     seemed shadowy with solemn thoughts, as well as with rustling\r\n     leaves. I took shame to myself for having been so long a\r\n     writer of idle stories, and ventured to hope that wisdom would\r\n     descend upon me with the falling leaves of the avenue; and that\r\n     I should light upon an intellectual treasure, in the Old Manse,\r\n     well worth those hoards of long-hidden gold, which people seek\r\n     for in moss-grown houses. Profound treatises of morality--a\r\n     layman's unprofessional, and therefore unprejudiced views of\r\n     religion;--histories (such as Bancroft might have written, had\r\n     he taken up his abode here, as he once purposed), bright with\r\n     picture, gleaming over a depth of philosophic thought;--these\r\n     were the works that might fitly have flowed from such a\r\n     retirement. In the humblest event, I resolved at least to\r\n     achieve a novel, that should evolve some deep lesson, and\r\n     should possess physical substance enough to stand alone. In\r\n     furtherance of my design, and as if to leave me no pretext for\r\n     not fulfilling it, there was, in the rear of the house, the\r\n     most delightful little nook of a study that ever offered its\r\n     snug seclusion to a scholar. It was here that Emerson wrote\r\n     'Nature;' for he was then an inhabitant of the Manse, and used\r\n     to watch the Assyrian dawn and the Paphian sunset and moonrise,\r\n     from the summit of our eastern hill. When I first saw the room,\r\n     its walls were blackened with the smoke of unnumbered years,\r\n     and made still blacker by the grim prints of puritan ministers\r\n     that hung around. These worthies looked strangely like bad\r\n     angels, or, at least, like men who had wrestled so continually\r\n     and so sternly with the devil, that somewhat of his sooty\r\n     fierceness had been imparted to their own visages. They had all\r\n     vanished now; a cheerful coat of paint, and gold tinted paper\r\n     hangings, lighted up the small apartment; while the shadow of a\r\n     willow-tree, that swept against the overhanging eaves,\r\n     attempered the cheery western sunshine. In place of the grim\r\n     prints there was the sweet and lovely head of one of Raphael's\r\n     Madonnas, and two pleasant little pictures of the Lake of Como.\r\n     The only other decorations were a purple vase of flowers,\r\n     always fresh, and a bronze one containing graceful ferns. My\r\n     books (few, and by no means choice; for they were chiefly such\r\n     waifs as chance had thrown in my way) stood in order about the\r\n     room, seldom to be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nIn his home at Concord, thus happily described, in the midst of a few\r\ncongenial friends, Hawthorne passed three years; and, \"in a spot so\r\nsheltered from the turmoil of life's ocean,\" he says, \"three years\r\nhasten away with a noiseless flight, as the breezy sunshine chases the\r\ncloud-shadows across the depths of a still valley.\" But at length his\r\nrepose was invaded by that \"spirit of improvement,\" which is so\r\nconstantly marring the happiness of quiet-loving people, and he was\r\ncompelled to look out for another residence.\r\n\r\n     \"Now came hints, growing more and more distinct, that the owner\r\n     of the old house was pining for his native air. Carpenters next\r\n     appeared, making a tremendous racket among the outbuildings,\r\n     strewing green grass with pine shavings and chips of chesnut\r\n     joists, and vexing the whole antiquity of the place with their\r\n     discordant renovations. Soon, moreover, they divested our abode\r\n     of the veil of woodbine which had crept over a large portion of\r\n     its southern face. All the aged mosses were cleared unsparingly\r\n     away; and there were horrible whispers about brushing up the\r\n     external walls with a coat of paint--a purpose as little to my\r\n     taste as might be that of rouging the venerable cheeks of one's\r\n     grandmother. But the hand that renovates is always more\r\n     sacrilegious than that which destroys. In fine, we gathered up\r\n     our household goods, drank a farewell cup of tea in our\r\n     pleasant little breakfast-room--delicately-fragrant tea, an\r\n     unpurchasable luxury, one of the many angel-gifts that had\r\n     fallen like dew upon us--and passed forth between the tall\r\n     stone gate-posts, as uncertain as the wandering Arabs where our\r\n     tent might next be pitched. Providence took me by the hand,\r\n     and--an oddity of dispensation which, I trust, there is no\r\n     irreverence in smiling at--has led me, as the newspapers\r\n     announce while I am writing, from the old Manse into a Custom\r\n     House! As a story-teller, I have often contrived strange\r\n     vicissitudes for my imaginary personages, but none like this.\r\n     The treasure of intellectual gold which I had hoped to find in\r\n     our secluded dwelling, had never come to light. No profound\r\n     treatise of ethics--no philosophic history--no novel, even,\r\n     that could stand unsupported on its edges--all that I had to\r\n     show, as a man of letters, were these few tales and essays,\r\n     which had blossomed out like flowers in the calm summer of my\r\n     heart and mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Mosses from an Old Manse_ he declared the last offering of their\r\nkind he should ever put forth; \"unless I can do better,\" he wrote in\r\nthis Introduction, \"I have done enough in this kind.\" He went to his\r\nplace in the Custom House, in his native city, and if President Taylor's\r\nadvisers had not been apprehensive that in his devotion to ledgers he\r\nwould neglect the more important duties of literature, perhaps we should\r\nhave heard no more of him; but those patriotic men, remembering how much\r\nthey had enjoyed the reading of the _Twice-Told Tales_ and the _Mosses_,\r\ninduced the appointment in his place of a whig, who had no capacity for\r\nmaking books, and in the spring of last year we had _The Scarlet\r\nLetter_.\r\n\r\nLike most of his shorter stories, The Scarlet Letter finds its scene and\r\ntime with the earlier Puritans. Its argument involves the analysis and\r\naction of remorse in the heart of a person who, himself unsuspected, is\r\ncompelled to assist in the punishment of the partner of his guilt. This\r\npeculiar and powerful fiction at once arrested attention, and claimed\r\nfor its author the eminence as a novelist which his previous\r\nperformances had secured for him as a writer of tales. Its whole\r\natmosphere and the qualities of its characters demanded for a creditable\r\nsuccess very unusual capacities. The frivolous costume and brisk action\r\nof the story of fashionable life are easily depicted by the practised\r\nsketcher, but a work like The Scarlet Letter comes slowly upon the\r\ncanvas, where passions are commingled and overlaid with the deliberate\r\nand masterly elaboration with which the grandest effects are produced in\r\npictorial composition and coloring. It is a distinction of such works\r\nthat while they are acceptable to the many, they also surprise and\r\ndelight the few who appreciate the nicest arrangement and the most high\r\nand careful finish. The Scarlet Letter will challenge consideration in\r\nthe name of Art, in the best audience which in any age receives\r\nCervantes, Le Sage, or Scott.\r\n\r\nFollowing this romance came new editions of _True Stories from History\r\nand Biography_, a volume for youthful readers, and of the _Twice-Told\r\nTales_. In the preface to the latter, underrating much the reputation he\r\nhas acquired by them, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"The author of _Twice-Told Tales_ has a claim to one\r\n     distinction, which, as none of his literary brethren will care\r\n     about disputing it with him, he need not be afraid to mention.\r\n     He was for a good many years the obscurest man of letters in\r\n     America. These stories were published in magazines and annuals,\r\n     extending over a period of ten or twelve years, and comprising\r\n     the whole of the writer's young manhood, without making (so far\r\n     as he has ever been aware) the slightest impression on the\r\n     public. One or two among them, the _Rill from the Town Pump_,\r\n     in perhaps a greater degree than any other, had a pretty wide\r\n     newspaper circulation; as for the rest, he has no grounds for\r\n     supposing that on their first appearance they met with the good\r\n     or evil fortune to be read by any body. Throughout the time\r\n     above specified he had no incitement to literary effort in a\r\n     reasonable prospect of reputation or profit; nothing but the\r\n     pleasure itself of composition--an enjoyment not at all amiss\r\n     in its way, and perhaps essential to the merit of the work in\r\n     hand, but which, in the long run, will hardly keep the chill\r\n     out of a writer's heart, or the numbness out of his fingers. To\r\n     this total lack of sympathy, at the age when his mind would\r\n     naturally have been most effervescent, the public owe it (and\r\n     it is certainly an effect not to be regretted, on either part),\r\n     that the author can show nothing for the thought and industry\r\n     of that portion of his life, save the forty sketches, or\r\n     thereabouts, included in these volumes. Much more, indeed, he\r\n     wrote; and some very small part of it might yet be rummaged out\r\n     (but it would not be worth the trouble) among the dingy pages\r\n     of fifteen or twenty year old periodicals, or within the shabby\r\n     morocco covers of faded Souvenirs. The remainder of the works\r\n     alluded to had a very brief existence, but, on the score of\r\n     brilliancy, enjoyed a fate vastly superior to that of their\r\n     brotherhood, which succeeded in getting through the press. In a\r\n     word, the author burned them without mercy or remorse, and,\r\n     moreover, without any subsequent regret, and had more than one\r\n     occasion to marvel that such very dull stuff as he knew his\r\n     condemned manuscripts to be, should yet have possessed\r\n     inflammability enough to set the chimney on fire!...\r\n\r\n     \"As he glances over these long-forgotten pages, and considers\r\n     his way of life while composing them, the author can very\r\n     clearly discern why all this was so. After so many sober years,\r\n     he would have reason to be ashamed if he could not criticise\r\n     his own work as fairly as another man's; and, though it is\r\n     little his business and perhaps still less his interest, he can\r\n     hardly resist a temptation to achieve something of the sort. If\r\n     writers were allowed to do so, and would perform the task with\r\n     perfect sincerity and unreserve, their opinions of their own\r\n     productions would often be more valuable and instructive than\r\n     the works themselves. At all events, there can be no harm in\r\n     the author's remarking that he rather wonders how the\r\n     _Twice-Told Tales_ should have gained what vogue they did, than\r\n     that it was so little and so gradual. They have the pale tint\r\n     of flowers that blossomed in too retired a shade--the coolness\r\n     of a meditative habit, which diffuses itself through the\r\n     feeling and observation of every sketch. Instead of passion,\r\n     there is sentiment; and, even in what purport to be pictures of\r\n     actual life, we have allegory, not always so warmly dressed in\r\n     its habiliments of flesh and blood as to be taken into the\r\n     reader's mind without a shiver. Whether from lack of power or\r\n     an unconquerable reserve, the author's touches have often an\r\n     effect of tameness; the merriest man can hardly contrive to\r\n     laugh at his broadest humor, the tenderest woman, one would\r\n     suppose, will hardly shed warm tears at his deepest pathos. The\r\n     book, if you would see any thing in it, requires to be read in\r\n     the clear, brown, twilight atmosphere in which it was written;\r\n     if opened in the sunshine, it is apt to look exceedingly like a\r\n     volume of blank pages....\r\n\r\n     \"The author would regret to be understood as speaking sourly or\r\n     querulously of the slight mark made by his earlier literary\r\n     efforts on the public at large. It is so far the contrary, that\r\n     he has been moved to write this preface, chiefly as affording\r\n     him an opportunity to express how much enjoyment he has owed to\r\n     these volumes, both before and since their publication. They\r\n     are the memorials of very tranquil, and not unhappy years. They\r\n     failed, it is true--nor could it have been otherwise--in\r\n     winning an extensive popularity. Occasionally, however, when he\r\n     deemed them entirely forgotten, a paragraph or an article, from\r\n     a native or foreign critic, would gratify his instincts of\r\n     authorship with unexpected praise,--too generous praise,\r\n     indeed, and too little alloyed with censure, which, therefore,\r\n     he learned the better to inflict upon himself. And, by-the-by,\r\n     it is a very suspicious symptom of a deficiency of the popular\r\n     element in a book, when it calls forth no harsh criticism. This\r\n     has been particularly the fortune of the _Twice-Told Tales_.\r\n     They made no enemies, and were so little known and talked\r\n     about, that those who read, and chanced to like them, were apt\r\n     to conceive the sort of kindness for the book, which a person\r\n     naturally feels for a discovery of his own. This kindly feeling\r\n     (in some cases, at least) extended to the author, who, on the\r\n     internal evidence of his sketches, came to be regarded as a\r\n     mild, shy, gentle, melancholic, exceedingly sensitive, and not\r\n     very forcible man, hiding his blushes under an assumed name,\r\n     the quaintness of which was supposed, somehow or other, to\r\n     symbolize his personal and literary traits. He is by no means\r\n     certain that some of his subsequent productions have not been\r\n     influenced and modified by a natural desire to fill up so\r\n     amiable an outline, and to act in consonance with the character\r\n     assigned to him; nor, even now, could he forfeit it without a\r\n     few tears of tender sensibility. To conclude, however,--these\r\n     volumes have opened the way to most agreeable associations, and\r\n     to the formation of imperishable friendships; and there are\r\n     many golden threads, interwoven with his present happiness,\r\n     which he can follow up more or less directly, until he finds\r\n     their commencement here; so that his pleasant pathway among\r\n     realities seems to proceed out of the Dream-Land of his youth,\r\n     and to be bordered with just enough of its shadowy foliage to\r\n     shelter him from the heat of the day. He is therefore\r\n     satisfied with what the _Twice-Told Tales_ have done for him,\r\n     and feels it to be far better than fame.\"\r\n\r\nThat there should be any truth in this statement that the public was so\r\nslow to recognize so fine a genius, is a mortifying evidence of the\r\nworthlessness of a literary popularity. But it may be said of\r\nHawthorne's fame that it has grown steadily, and that while many who\r\nhave received the turbulent applause of the multitude since he began his\r\ncareer are forgotten, it has widened and brightened, until his name is\r\namong the very highest in his domain of art, to shine there with a\r\nlustre equally serene and enduring.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawthorne's last work is _The House of Seven Gables_, a romance of\r\nthe present day. It is not less original, not less striking, not less\r\npowerful, than The Scarlet Letter. We doubt indeed whether he has\r\nelsewhere surpassed either of the three strongly contrasted characters\r\nof the book. An innocent and joyous child-woman, Phoebe Pyncheon,\r\ncomes from a farm-house into the grand and gloomy old mansion where her\r\ndistant relation, Hepzibah Pyncheon, an aristocratical and fearfully\r\nugly but kind-hearted unmarried woman of sixty, is just coming down from\r\nher faded state to keep in one of her drawing-rooms a small shop, that\r\nshe may be able to maintain an elder brother who is every moment\r\nexpected home from a prison to which in his youth he had been condemned\r\nunjustly, and in the silent solitude of which he has kept some\r\nlineaments of gentleness while his hair has grown white, and a sense of\r\nbeauty while his brain has become disordered and his heart has been\r\ncrushed and all present influences of beauty have been quite shut out.\r\nThe House of Seven Gables is the purest piece of imagination in our\r\nprose literature.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Hawthorne which first arrest the attention are\r\nimagination and reflection, and these are exhibited in remarkable power\r\nand activity in tales and essays, of which the style is distinguished\r\nfor great simplicity, purity and tranquillity. His beautiful story of\r\nRappacini's Daughter was originally published in the Democratic Review,\r\nas a translation from the French of one M. de l'Aubépine, a writer whose\r\nvery name, he remarks in a brief introduction, (in which he gives in\r\nFrench the titles of some of his tales, as _Contes deux foix racontées_,\r\n_Le Culte du Feu,_ etc.) \"is unknown to many of his countrymen, as well\r\nas to the student of foreign literature.\" He describes himself, under\r\nthis _nomme de plume_, as one who--\r\n\r\n     \"Seems to occupy an unfortunate position between the\r\n     transcendentalists (who under one name or another have their\r\n     share in all the current literature of the world), and the\r\n     great body of pen-and-ink men who address the intellect and\r\n     sympathies of the multitude. If not too refined, at all events\r\n     too remote, too shadowy and unsubstantial, in his mode of\r\n     development, to suit the taste of the latter class, and yet too\r\n     popular to a satisfy the spiritual or metaphysical requisitions\r\n     of the former, he must necessarily find himself without an\r\n     audience, except here and there an individual, or possibly an\r\n     isolated clique.\"\r\n\r\nHis writings, to do them justice, he says--\r\n\r\n     \"Are not altogether destitute of fancy and originality; they\r\n     might have won him greater reputation but for an inveterate\r\n     love of allegory, which is apt to invest his plots and\r\n     characters with the aspect of scenery and people in the clouds,\r\n     and to steal away the human warmth out of his conceptions. His\r\n     fictions are sometimes historical, sometimes of the present\r\n     day, and sometimes, so far as can be discovered, have little or\r\n     no reference either to time or space. In any case, he generally\r\n     contents himself with a very slight embroidery of outward\r\n     manners,--the faintest possible counterfeit of real life,--and\r\n     endeavors to create an interest by some less obvious\r\n     peculiarity of the subject. Occasionally a breath of nature, a\r\n     rain-drop of pathos and tenderness, or a gleam of humor, will\r\n     find its way into the midst of his fantastic imagery, and make\r\n     us feel as if, after all, we were yet within the limits of our\r\n     native earth. We will only add to this cursory notice, that M.\r\n     de l'Aubépine's productions, if the reader chance to take them\r\n     in precisely the proper point of view, may amuse a leisure hour\r\n     as well as those of a brighter man; if otherwise, they can\r\n     hardly fail to look excessively like nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nHawthorne is as accurately as he is happily described in this curious\r\npiece of criticism, though no one who takes his works in the \"proper\r\npoint of view,\" will by any means agree to the modest estimate which, in\r\nthe perfect sincerity of his nature, he has placed upon them. He is\r\noriginal, in invention, construction, and expression, always\r\npicturesque, and sometimes in a high degree dramatic. His favorite\r\nscenes and traditions are those of his own country, many of which he has\r\nmade classical by the beautiful associations that he has thrown around\r\nthem. Every thing to him is suggestive, as his own pregnant pages are to\r\nthe congenial reader. All his productions are life-mysteries,\r\nsignificant of profound truths. His speculations, often bold and\r\nstriking, are presented with singular force, but with such a quiet grace\r\nand simplicity as not to startle until they enter in and occupy the\r\nmind. The gayety with which his pensiveness is occasionally broken,\r\nseems more than any thing else in his works to have cost some effort.\r\nThe gentle sadness, the \"half-acknowledged melancholy,\" of his manner\r\nand reflections, are more natural and characteristic.\r\n\r\nHis style is studded with the most poetical imagery, and marked in every\r\npart with the happiest graces of expression, while it is calm, chaste,\r\nand flowing, and transparent as water. There is a habit among nearly all\r\nthe writers of imaginative literature, of adulterating the conversations\r\nof the poor with barbarisms and grammatical blunders which have no more\r\nfidelity than elegance. Hawthorne's integrity as well as his\r\nexquisite--taste prevented him from falling into this error. There is\r\nnot in the world a large rural population that speaks its native\r\nlanguage with a purity approaching that with which the English is spoken\r\nby the common people of New England. The vulgar words and phrases which\r\nin other states are supposed to be peculiar to this part of the country\r\nare unknown east of the Hudson, except to the readers of foreign\r\nnewspapers, or the listeners to low comedians who find it profitable to\r\nconvey such novelties into Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. We\r\nare glad to see a book that is going down to the next ages as a\r\nrepresentative of national manners and character in all respects\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne is among the first of the first order of our\r\nwriters, and in their peculiar province his works are not excelled in\r\nthe literature of the present day or of the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYEAST: A PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. KINGSLEY, author of _Alton Locke_, has collected into a\r\nbook the series of vehement and yeasty papers which have appeared from\r\nhis pen in _Fraser's Magazine_ under the above title, and a new impulse\r\nis thus given in England to the discussion of the Problem of Society.\r\nThe declared object of the work--which is of the class of philosophical\r\nnovels--is to exhibit the miseries of the poor; the conventionalisms,\r\nhypocrisies, and feebleness of the rich; the religious doubts of the\r\nstrong, and the miserable delusions and superstitions of the weak; the\r\nmammon-worship of the middling and upper classes, and the angry humility\r\nof the masses. The story is very slight, but sufficient for the\r\neffective presentation of the author's opinions. The best characters are\r\nan Irish parson, a fox-hunting squire and his commonplace worldly wife,\r\nand a thoughtless and reckless but not unkind man of the world. Here is\r\na sketch of a commonplace old English vicar, such as has been familiar\r\nin the pages of novels and essays time out of mind:\r\n\r\n     \"He told me, hearing me quote Schiller, to beware of the\r\n     Germans, for they were all Pantheists at heart. I asked him\r\n     whether he included Lange and Bunsen, and it appeared that he\r\n     had never read a German book in his life. He then flew\r\n     furiously at Mr. Carlyle, and I found that all he knew of him\r\n     was from a certain review in the _Quarterly_. He called Boëhmen\r\n     a theosophic Atheist. I should have burst out at that, had I\r\n     not read the very words in a High Church review, the day\r\n     before, and hoped that he was not aware of the impudent\r\n     falsehood which he was retailing. Whenever I feebly interposed\r\n     an objection to any thing he said (for, after all he talked\r\n     on), he told me to hear the Catholic Church. I asked him which\r\n     Catholic Church? He said the English. I asked him whether it\r\n     was to be the Church of the sixth century, or the thirteenth,\r\n     or the seventeenth, or the eighteenth? He told me the one and\r\n     eternal Church, which belonged as much to the nineteenth\r\n     century as to the first. I begged to know whether, then, I was\r\n     to hear the Church according to Simeon, or according to Newman,\r\n     or according to St. Paul; for they seemed to me a little at\r\n     variance? He told me, austerely enough, that the mind of the\r\n     Church was embodied in her Liturgy and Articles. To which I\r\n     answered, that the mind of the episcopal clergy might, perhaps,\r\n     be; but, then, how happened it that they were always quarreling\r\n     and calling hard names about the sense of those very documents?\r\n     And so I left him, assuring him that living in the nineteenth\r\n     century, I wanted to hear the Church of the nineteenth century,\r\n     and no other; and should be most happy to listen to her, as\r\n     soon as she had made up her mind what to say.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish travellers in America give very minute accounts of the bad\r\ngrammar and questionable pronunciation they sometimes hear among our\r\ncommon people: with what advantage they might go into the rural\r\nneighborhoods of their own country for exhibitions in this line is shown\r\nby the following description of a scene in a booth, which one of the\r\ncharacters of Mr. Kingsley enters at night:\r\n\r\n     \"Sadder and sadder, Lancelot tried to listen to the\r\n     conversation of the men around him. To his astonishment he\r\n     hardly understood a word of it. It was half articulate, nasal,\r\n     guttural, made up almost entirely of vowels, like the speech of\r\n     savages. He had never before been struck with the significant\r\n     contrast between the sharp, clearly-defined articulation, the\r\n     vivid and varied tones of the gentleman, or even of the London\r\n     street-boy, when compared with the coarse, half-formed growls,\r\n     as of a company of seals, which he heard round him. That single\r\n     fact struck him perhaps more deeply than any; it connected\r\n     itself with many of physiological fancies; it was the parent of\r\n     many thoughts and plans of his after-life. Here and there he\r\n     could distinguish a half sentence. An old shrunken man opposite\r\n     him was drawing figures in the spilt beer with his pipestem,\r\n     and discoursing of the glorious times before the great war,\r\n     'when there was more food than there were mouths, and more work\r\n     than there hands.' 'Poor human nature,' thought Lancelot, as he\r\n     tried to follow one of those unintelligible discussions about\r\n     the relative prices of the loaf and the bushel of flour, which\r\n     ended, as usual, in more swearing and more quarreling, and more\r\n     beer to make it up: 'poor human nature! always looking back, as\r\n     the German sage says, to some fancied golden age, never looking\r\n     forward to the real one which is coming.\"\r\n\r\nThe descriptive powers of the author are illustrated in many fine\r\npassages, of which this delineation of an English day in March will\r\nserve as a specimen:\r\n\r\n     \"A silent, dim, distanceless, steaming, rotting day in March.\r\n     The last brown oak-leaf, which had stood out the winter's\r\n     frost, spun and quivered plump down, and then lay, as if\r\n     ashamed to have broken for a moment the ghastly stillness, like\r\n     an awkward guest at a great dumb dinner-party. A cold suck of\r\n     wind just proved its existence, by toothaches on the north side\r\n     of all faces. The spiders, having been weather-be-witched the\r\n     night before, had unanimously agreed to cover every brake and\r\n     brier with gossamer-cradles, and never a fly to be caught in\r\n     them; like Manchester cotton-spinners madly glutting the\r\n     markets in the teeth of 'no demand.' The steam crawled out of\r\n     the dank turf, and reeked off the flanks and nostrils of the\r\n     shivering horses, and clung with clammy paws to frosted hats\r\n     and dripping boughs. A soulless, skyless, catarrhal day, as if\r\n     that bustling dowager, old mother Earth--what with\r\n     match-making in spring, and _fêtes champetres_ in summer, and\r\n     dinner-giving in autumn--was fairly worn out, and put to bed\r\n     with the influenza, under wet blankets and the cold-water\r\n     cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeast,\" says the _Spectator_, \"may be looked at as a series of\r\nsketches, loosely strung together, descriptive of palpable social evils\r\nin the mass, and of metaphysical broodings among the more thoughtful\r\nyouth; a struggle which perhaps is always taking place, and which is no\r\nfurther distinctive of the present age than the form that is given by\r\nour intellectual and religious activity. The origin of evil, its\r\npresence in the world, what man was made for, what he struggles for,\r\nwhat becomes of him, have been questions that excited the speculative of\r\nall ages, taking various channels according to the circumstances of the\r\ntime. Considered from this point of view, as a life-like picture of the\r\nheavings of the mass, and the mental fermentation going on among\r\nindividuals--of the _yeast_ of society--the book displays great ability,\r\nand challenges careful attention. It is powerful, earnest, feeling, and\r\neloquent; the production of a man acquainted with society, who has\r\nlooked closely upon its various classes, and has the power of reading\r\nthe signs of the times. He has a truthful vigor of description, a\r\nrhetorical rather than a dramatic power; or he sacrifices the latter to\r\nhis habit of expressing his opinions in dialogue, where the author talks\r\nrather than the dramatis personæ. There is a genial warmth of feeling in\r\nthe book, and wide human sympathies, but with a tendency to extremes in\r\nstatement and opinion--a disposition to deepen the shadows of English\r\nlife; for go where the author would, pictures quite as bad or worse may\r\nbe drawn of the condition of mankind, from the 'noble savage,' the beau\r\nideal of Rousseau, to the educated 'Prussian,' who was within a little\r\nwhile the model man of a certain school of philosophers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLENESS OF A GREAT PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future historians of this age will have to record no more mortifying\r\nillustration of the difficulties which in a republic prevent the success\r\nof great ideas than that which is presented in the case of Mr. Whitney,\r\nwho early in the last month sailed for England. We transcribe with\r\nespecial approval the following paragraphs respecting him and his\r\nlabors, from the _Tribune_:\r\n\r\n     \"If we are not mistaken, it is now nearly ten years since Mr.\r\n     Whitney first devoted himself to his great project, and he has\r\n     pursued it with a force of purpose, an intelligent apprehension\r\n     of all its bearings and consequences upon the world, a nobility\r\n     of ambition, and a sustained, intellectual enthusiasm which\r\n     belongs to the rarest and most admirable characters. We do not\r\n     know in any country a man in whom great intellectual and\r\n     practical elements are more happily combined. It is not with\r\n     the warm partiality of private friendship that we thus speak of\r\n     Mr. Whitney, for, like all men of ideas, and all of nature\r\n     positive and deep enough to have a special mission in the\r\n     world, he puts others into relation with the thoughts which\r\n     engage him rather than with his own personality, and you become\r\n     intimate with them, not with him. A native, as we believe, of\r\n     Connecticut, brought up to business in this city, where he\r\n     acquired a competence, having conceived the idea of a vaster\r\n     and more inspiring enterprise than the political and industrial\r\n     world had ever attempted, he quitted the pursuits of trade, and\r\n     the certain wealth they promised him, to perfect and realize\r\n     his conception. He studied the great routes of the world, and\r\n     the causes of their adoption. In a residence in Europe and by\r\n     voyages in the East he made himself acquainted with the facts\r\n     relating to the trade and productive capacities of Asia. He\r\n     thoroughly surveyed and mastered the whole subject before\r\n     beginning its discussion. Then he proposed the scheme to his\r\n     countrymen, and for many years has sought exclusively to\r\n     commend it to their favor. He has travelled in every direction,\r\n     addressing public bodies and meetings of citizens, writing\r\n     newspaper articles and pamphlets, and sparing no occasion to\r\n     bring the idea and the facts connected with it to the knowledge\r\n     of all. Wherever he has gone he has left some sparks of his own\r\n     genial enthusiasm. The plan has found advocates in every\r\n     section; many state legislatures have formally endorsed it, and\r\n     a large party in Congress have been in its favor. Dependent\r\n     altogether on his own pecuniary resources, Mr. Whitney, without\r\n     compensation or assistance, has labored with a constancy and\r\n     fidelity which could only proceed from a great purpose. But\r\n     after this period of arduous exertion he has failed to carry\r\n     his plan through Congress, while a great part of the lands on\r\n     which he must depend for its execution, have already passed\r\n     from the control of the federal Legislature. Accordingly,\r\n     though he would greatly prefer that his own country should reap\r\n     the splendid harvest of honor and substantial power which the\r\n     building of this world's highway would assure, he has no choice\r\n     but to consider the means which may be offered him for making\r\n     it through British America. To the world at large the\r\n     consequences would be the same, though to the United States\r\n     very different.\r\n\r\n     \"The route through British America is, in some respects, even\r\n     preferable to that through our own territory. By the former,\r\n     the distance from Europe to Asia is some thousand miles shorter\r\n     than by the latter. Passing close to the northern shore of Lake\r\n     Superior, traversing the watershed which divides the streams\r\n     flowing toward the Arctic Sea from those which have their exit\r\n     southward, and crossing the Rocky Mountains at an elevation\r\n     some three thousand, feet less than at the South Pass, the road\r\n     could here be constructed with comparative cheapness, and would\r\n     open up a region abounding in valuable timber and other natural\r\n     products, and admirably suited to the growth of grain and to\r\n     grazing. Having its Atlantic seaport at Halifax, and its\r\n     Pacific Depot near Vancouver's Island, it would inevitably draw\r\n     to it the commerce of Europe, Asia, and the United States. Thus\r\n     British America, from a mere colonial dependency, would assume\r\n     a controlling rank in the world. To her other nations would be\r\n     tributary, and in vain would the United States attempt to be\r\n     her rival; for we could never dispute with her the possession\r\n     of the Asiatic commerce, or the power which that confers.\"\r\n\r\n     But the matter reaches beyond the suggestions of national\r\n     interest, and has a wider scope than the mere sentiment of\r\n     patriotism. We have hoped that this republic might make the\r\n     easy effort necessary to grasp a prize so magnificent, but we\r\n     shall hail with satisfaction the actual commencement of such a\r\n     work, wherever and by whomsoever it is undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JEW AND A CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago, a man of various genius and acquirement, with whose\r\nwritings people of many countries have been delighted, entered an\r\noffice, holding in his hand two black-bordered notes, inviting him to\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\nSo--other friends have gone! who now?\r\n\r\nTwo persons very unlike each other. Truly I have never known more\r\nstriking contrasts. I was meditating of popular prejudices by which\r\ntheir lives were more or less affected, by which their reputations were\r\ncertainly much affected: one was a Jew, and the other a Christian.\r\n\r\nProceed with your morality.\r\n\r\nI was very poor when I came to this country. I sought occupation in the\r\npursuits for which I was best fitted by my education: for a time with\r\nlittle success; and at length I was offered for the translation of two\r\nwretched French novels, the meager sum of fifty dollars. I sold some of\r\nmy wife's trinkets to purchase paper and ink, and worked diligently, you\r\ncan guess how many weeks, until they were in English as readable as the\r\nFrench of their author. The task accomplished, I went to my patron,\r\nexpecting of course to have the pittance counted down in current notes\r\nor gold; but----the market for such literature was by this time over\r\nstocked; he had supplied it too liberally; and with some insulting\r\nexcuse he refused the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nYou have an invitation to his funeral?\r\n\r\nYes--he was rich--always speculating in the sweat of brains--and we had\r\nbusiness relations afterward.\r\n\r\nThe other history?\r\n\r\nI chanced one day to meet a gentleman, with whom I had no personal\r\nacquaintance, though our names were known to each other, and conversing\r\nof a subject with which I was familiar he inquired if I would write\r\nsomething upon it for his journal. I replied that I would be very happy\r\nto do so, and as we shook hands, at parting, he left in my palm two\r\ntwenty-dollar notes. He would gladly have avoided a word of explanation,\r\nbut seeing my surprise he said, \"It is merely a retainer, as the lawyers\r\nhave it; consider it upon account of the articles you will write me.\" I\r\nwrote the articles; it was but an evening's work; and wrote frequently\r\nafterward for the same person, always receiving a liberal reward--always\r\nmore than I asked--though my employer was himself by no means rich. You\r\nwill think that in the first place he expected a profit for the money he\r\ngave me, but I knew better: he cared not a fig for the papers I was to\r\nprepare; he simply suspected that I was in need of money, and took that\r\ndelicate way to relieve me, as, in his time, he relieved hundreds of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nA noble characteristic of a man perhaps in all respects deserving of\r\nadmiration: But what of the prejudice you were meditating?\r\n\r\nIt is this--that even in this land, where many an old world superstition\r\nhas found life impossible--the community regard a _Jew_ as an\r\nincarnation of all selfishness, meanness and dishonor. A hundred to one,\r\nbeing told that the hero of one of these two histories was an Israelite,\r\nwould swear instantly that the name of him who swindled me was Moses.\r\nBut it was not: that person will to-morrow have Christian burial, and\r\nthe other--one of the most sincere and generous men of the age, was an\r\nofficer of the synagogue. You know--we both know--that the Hebrew race\r\nare not only before the other races in all fine intelligence, but that\r\nin defiance of prejudices and disabilities which might turn any other\r\npeople into hordes of robbers, they are of the most honorable portion of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICARPA LA SALVARIETTA,\r\n\r\nTHE HEROINE OF COLOMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are not many subjects for poetry or romance in American history\r\nmore suggestive than that furnished in the following incidents,\r\ntranslated from Restrepo's _Historia de la Revolucion de la Colombia_:\r\n\r\n     \"After the standard of liberty had been raised in all the\r\n     provinces, and the people had struck a successful blow for\r\n     freedom, Morillo, with an overwhelming force, re-conquered the\r\n     country for Spain. During six months this fiendish savage held\r\n     undisputed sway over Colombia. The best men of the provinces\r\n     were by him seized and shot, and each of his officers had the\r\n     power of death over the inhabitants of the districts in which\r\n     they were stationed. It was during this period that the\r\n     barbarous execution of Policarpa La Salvarietta--a heroic girl\r\n     of New Granada--roused the Patriots once more to arms, and\r\n     produced in them a determination to expel their oppressors or\r\n     die. This young lady was enthusiastically attached to the cause\r\n     of liberty, and had, by her influence, rendered essential aid\r\n     to the Patriots. The wealth of her father, and her own superior\r\n     talents and education, early excited the hostility of the\r\n     Spanish commander against her and her family. She had promised\r\n     her hand in marriage to a young officer in the Patriot service,\r\n     who had been compelled by Morillo to join the Spanish army as a\r\n     private soldier. La Salvarietta, by means that were never\r\n     disclosed, obtained, through him an exact account of the\r\n     Spanish forces, and a plan of their fortifications. The\r\n     Patriots were preparing to strike a decisive blow, and this\r\n     intelligence was important to their success. She had induced\r\n     Sabarain, her lover, and eight others, to desert. They were\r\n     discovered, and apprehended. The letters of La Salvarietta,\r\n     found on the person of her lover, betrayed her to the vengeance\r\n     of the tyrant of her country. She was seized, brought to the\r\n     Spanish camp, and tried by court martial. The highest rewards\r\n     were promised her if she would disclose the names and plans of\r\n     her associates. The inducements proving of no avail, torture\r\n     was employed to wring from her the secret, in which so many of\r\n     the best families of Colombia were interested, but even on the\r\n     rack she persisted in making no disclosure. The accomplished\r\n     young lady, hardly eighteen years of age, was condemned to be\r\n     shot. She calmly and serenely heard her sentence, and prepared\r\n     to meet her fate. She confessed to a Catholic priest, partook\r\n     of the sacrament, and with a firm step walked to the open\r\n     square, where a file of soldiers, in presence of Morillo and\r\n     his officers, were drawn up, with loaded muskets. Turning to\r\n     Morillo, she said, \"I shall not die in vain, for my blood will\r\n     raise up heroes from every hill and valley of my country.\" She\r\n     had scarcely uttered the above, when Morillo himself gave the\r\n     signal to the soldiers to fire, and in the next moment La\r\n     Salvarietta was a mangled and bleeding corpse. The Spanish\r\n     officers and soldiers were overwhelmed with astonishment at the\r\n     firmness and patriotism of this lovely girl, but the effect\r\n     upon her own countrymen was electrical. The Patriots lost no\r\n     time in flying to arms, and their war cry, \"_La Salvarietta_!\"\r\n     made every heart burn to inflict vengeance upon her murderers.\r\n     In a very short time the army of Morillo was nearly cut to\r\n     pieces, and the commander himself escaped death only by flight,\r\n     and in disguise.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mexico a dramatic piece, which we have seen described as possessing\r\nconsiderable merit, has been founded upon this tragical history. In the\r\nSpanish American wars there have been numerous instances of remarkable\r\nheroism by women, which is the more noticeable for the little the sex\r\nhas had to gain by the political independence of the Spanish race on\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REAL AMERICAN SAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Jameson, in her beautiful book lately published in London, _Legends\r\nof the Monastic Orders_, has the following account of the only American\r\nwoman ever canonized:\r\n\r\n     \"Santa Rosa di Lima was born at Lima, in Peru, in 1586. This\r\n     flower of sanctity, whose fragrance has filled the whole\r\n     Christian world, is the patroness of America, the St. Theresa\r\n     of Transatlantic Spain. She was distinguished, in the first\r\n     place, by her austerities. 'Her usual food was an herb bitter\r\n     as wormwood. When compelled by her mother to wear a wreath of\r\n     roses, she so adjusted it on her brow that it became a crown of\r\n     thorns. Rejecting a host of suitors, she destroyed the lovely\r\n     complexion to which she owed her name, by an application of\r\n     pepper and quicklime. But she was also a noble example of\r\n     filial devotion, and maintained her once wealthy parents,\r\n     fallen on evil days, by the labor of her hands.' All day she\r\n     toiled in a garden, and at night she worked with her needle.\r\n     She took the habit of the third order of St. Dominic, and died\r\n     in 1617. She was canonized by Clement X. According to the\r\n     Peruvian legend, the Pope, when entreated to canonize her,\r\n     absolutely refused, exclaiming, 'India y santa! asi como\r\n     llueven rosas!' (India and saint! as much so as that it rains\r\n     roses!') Whereupon, a miraculous shower of roses began to fall\r\n     in the Vatican, and ceased not till the incredulous pontiff\r\n     acknowledged himself convinced.\"\r\n\r\nAmong men saints have been more plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already briefly spoken of Dr. ANDREE'S work on America which is\r\nnow publishing at Brunswick, Germany, by the house of Westermann, a\r\nbranch of which is established in this city at the corner of Broadway\r\nand Duane-streets. The book in question is to consist of three volumes\r\nof some six hundred and fifty octavo pages each, devoted respectively to\r\nNorth, Central, and South America. It is published in numbers of some\r\neighty pages each; of these numbers four are already issued, and we have\r\nread them with great satisfaction. The broad and philosophical spirit,\r\nthe exhaustive learning, and the spirited and picturesque style of Dr.\r\nAndree are beyond praise; among all the books on America which we have\r\nmet with this impresses us as unique, and if the remainder shall prove\r\nequal to what is already published, we hope that some American publisher\r\nmay undertake a translation of the whole into English.\r\n\r\nThe work opens with an introduction of some forty odd pages, in which,\r\nfirst, the physical characteristics of the new world are set forth with\r\ngreat clearness and beauty: its mountains, rivers, lakes, climate,\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms; the origin of the aboriginal inhabitants,\r\ntheir languages, races, manners, customs, and civilization; the\r\nsettlements of Europeans, the Spaniards, the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nstates, the Creoles, Mexico, Brazil, &c. Amalgamation of races, the\r\nnegroes, Slavery, influence of the Latin races, the Teutonic race, the\r\nUnited States, their growth and destiny, are made the subjects of a\r\ncontinuous discussion, remarkable alike for an air at least of breadth\r\nand profundity, careful and comprehensive knowledge, and for concise and\r\noften eloquent expression. The introduction is followed by chapters on\r\nIceland, Greenland, and the various expeditions to the polar regions of\r\nthe north, treating those topics both historically and ethnographically,\r\nand with a clear presentation of every interesting and important fact.\r\nNext follows a general survey of the continent north of the fiftieth,\r\ndegree of latitude, its rivers, lakes, forests, animals, men, and\r\ncommerce, including an account of the various Indian tribes, and the\r\ntrading companies dealing with them. The trading posts of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, Lord Selkirk's colony on Red River, Labrador, Newfoundland,\r\nthe British Possessions on the West coast, Russian America, are\r\nsuccessively treated. Next the Indians in Canada and the United States\r\nare considered at length, in respect of their history, traditions,\r\nlanguages, monuments, customs, the influence of the whites upon them,\r\nand their probable destiny. In this connection we notice that Dr. Andree\r\nfrequently cites Gallatin, Schoolcraft, Squier, and other American\r\nwriters. The remainder of the first volume will treat of the United\r\nStates, their political history and organization, their soil, climate,\r\npeople, &c., not failing to give whatever information may be useful to\r\nthe European settler looking for a new home, as well as to the _savan_\r\nlooking for light upon ethnographic and social problems.\r\n\r\nFrom this general outline the scope of the book may be inferred, but our\r\nreaders will permit us to refer to one or two points which are dwelt\r\nupon in the introduction. Dr. Andree contends with the earnestness of a\r\ndetermined partisan for the originality of the vegetable and animal\r\ncreations, as well as of the human race upon this continent, rejecting\r\nentirely the theory that either was transplanted from the eastern\r\nhemisphere. The unity of the human family, he maintains with a class of\r\nwriters distinguishable chiefly for a sleepless activity in assailing\r\nthe authority of the Christian religion, does not require the assumption\r\nof numerical identity of origin, but rather the contrary. \"It is not\r\nnecessary,\" he says, \"to assume the arithmetical _oneness_ of mankind,\r\nand the derivation of all from a single pair, thus arbitrarily confining\r\nand limiting the creative power of the Highest Being;\" and this position\r\nhe proceeds to advocate by a variety of arguments, at the same time\r\ncontroverting the opposite opinion, and especially the notion of the\r\nlate Major Noah that the Indians of this continent were descendants of\r\nthe lost ten tribes of Israel. In this impertinence is the only\r\nnoteworthy fault we discover in the book. Discussions of such\r\ncontroverted points as this belong exclusively to the audience of\r\nscholars. A far more interesting and satisfactory part of the\r\nintroduction is that devoted to the Spanish and Portuguese in America,\r\nand their influence on the native tribes, and _vice versa_. The contrast\r\nwhich these races and the states they have founded exhibit to the\r\nGermanic race in North America is brought out by Dr. Andree in a\r\nstriking manner. All the South American republics except Chili are in a\r\ncondition of comparative or actual disorder: no signs of expanding life\r\nand progress are visible among them; every where the conflict of races\r\nand castes is active or only partially suppressed; Brazil alone, by the\r\nmonarchical form of its executive, (though its institutions are\r\nfundamentally democratic,) is spared from the anarchy which prevails\r\namong its neighbors, and there too, alone, the black, yellow, and red\r\nraces are politically equal and in the way of complete amalgamation; but\r\nin all these states the European element, instead of growing more\r\npowerful and influential, tends constantly to greater weakness, and is\r\nlikely to be completely absorbed and swallowed up; since the wars of\r\nindependence the white race has diminished, not increased in number; and\r\ninstead of conferring on the native races the civilization and\r\nrefinement which was its native property, it is so far dominated by them\r\nas to relapse toward their ignorance and rudeness; and after three\r\ncenturies all Spanish America, the West Indies included, contains not\r\nmore than fifteen millions of inhabitants, about a fifth of whom are\r\nwhites, that is to say as many as are found in the State of New-York\r\nalone. Or, reckoning for all America south of the United States, five\r\nmillions of whites, this population still falls far short of that which\r\nwithin thirty years has taken possession of the country between the\r\nAlleghanies and the Mississippi. Such is the difference between the\r\nLatin and the Saxon races. The latter has spread itself with astonishing\r\nrapidity, never mixing, to any extent, with negroes or Indians, nor\r\nallowing mixed races to get the upper hand, or even exercise any\r\ninfluence. The Anglo-Saxon civilizes the other races or devotes them to\r\nextinction. And yet South America is naturally better than North. It is\r\nricher and more productive, and endowed with a system of rivers compared\r\nwith which that of the Mississippi seems trifling. Had it been settled\r\nby Anglo-Saxons and Germans instead of Creoles and mixed breeds, it\r\nwould long since have worn another aspect; steamboats would have covered\r\nthe rivers up to the very foot of the Cordilleras, and the vast plains\r\nwould have been occupied by flourishing towns and cultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThe parallel which Dr. Andree draws between the history of the United\r\nStates and Europe for the last fifty years is so strikingly put, that we\r\nmake room for a single passage by way of specimen:\r\n\r\n     \"A comparison of the history of Europe and of North America\r\n     during the time since the first French revolution is in every\r\n     respect to the advantage of the United States. The old world\r\n     has been convulsed by wars, a military emperor has had the sway\r\n     of Europe, and broken kingdoms into fragments; blood has flowed\r\n     in torrents, and thousands of millions have been wasted for\r\n     unproductive purposes and on royal vanity. Since the fall of\r\n     the Great Soldier the nations have incessantly risen against\r\n     their rulers, and more than a million of men now stand in arms\r\n     to restrain the people and serve the passions of monarchs and\r\n     their cabinets. Only sixty years ago the entire valley of the\r\n     Mississippi was still a desert, a wide wilderness, with hardly\r\n     here and there a settlement. Now we see this empire in\r\n     subjection--conquered, not by soldiers, with waving banners and\r\n     sounding trumpets, but by the toil of the farmer, the skill of\r\n     the artisan, the enterprising spirit of the merchant. They have\r\n     drained morasses, cleared up forests, opened roads, dug canals,\r\n     built ships, and founded flourishing states. Within the period\r\n     of two generations they have peopled that wilderness with ten\r\n     millions of industrious inhabitants, and opened a new home to\r\n     the arts of peace, to civil and religious liberty, to culture\r\n     and progress. In these sixty years, not so much blood has been\r\n     shed in wars against Indians in the Mississippi valley as in\r\n     one of the hundreds of battles fought by the soldiers of\r\n     European states, most of them for useless or even pernicious\r\n     ends. No blessing has followed the wars and conquests in\r\n     Europe, but in the Great West, conquered by labor and\r\n     enterprise, all is progress and unexampled prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other passages tempting us to translate them, but\r\nour space is already exhausted, and we forbear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have already taken occasion to commend the _Tausend und ein Tag im\r\nOrient_ (Thousand and One Days in the East) by BODENSTEDT, the\r\nwell-known author of the Wars of the Circassians. No writer gives so\r\njust an insight into the character of that portion of the great Oriental\r\nfamily which he visited--the Circassians and Georgians. The second part\r\nof his present book (lately published at Berlin) contains some\r\ninteresting criticisms of a Tartar poet, whom Bodenstedt knew at Tiflis,\r\nupon European poetry. Our traveller, partly by way of practice in the\r\nTartar language, and partly to inspire his eastern friend with greater\r\nrespect for the bards of the Occident, used to translate English and\r\nGerman songs into Tartar. Mirza Shaffy, the name of the Tartar sage and\r\npoet, proved himself no contemptible critic of these foreign\r\nproductions. Not once could he be induced to tolerate a poem whose only\r\nmerit was the beauty and melody of its language in the original, nor to\r\nswallow the mere sentimentalism which plays so great a part in German\r\npoetry especially. This sentimentalism, says Bodenstedt, is as unknown\r\nas it is unintelligible to the Oriental poet. He aims always at a real\r\nand tangible object, and in gaining it puts heaven and earth in motion.\r\nNo image is too remote, no thought too lofty for his purpose. The new\r\nmoon is a golden shoe for the hoof of his heroes' steed. The stars are\r\ngolden nails, with which the Lord has fastened the sky, lest it should\r\nfall with admiration and desire for his fair one. The cypresses and\r\ncedars grow only to recall the lithe and graceful form of Selma. The\r\nweeping willow droops her green hair to the water, grieving because she\r\nis not slender like Selma. The eyes of his beloved are suns which make\r\nall the faithful fire-worshippers. The sun itself is but a gleaming\r\nlyre, whose beams are golden strings, whence the dawn draws the\r\nloveliest accords to the praise of the earth's beauty and the power of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nMirza Shaffy was a great lover of Moore and Byron, and some of their\r\nsongs which were translated needed no explanation to render them\r\nintelligible to him. Wolfe's marvellous poem on the death of Sir John\r\nMoore made a deep impression on him, and was a special favorite. Goëthe\r\nand Heine he liked greatly, especially Goethe's song of Mignon, \"Knowst\r\nthou the Land,\" and Heine's Fisher's Song (which Schubert has set to\r\nsuch delicious and befitting music) which ends--\r\n\r\n    \"My heart is like the ocean,\r\n      Has storm, and ebb, and flow,\r\n    And many a lovely pearlet\r\n      Rests in its depths below.\"\r\n\r\nSchiller he could not so well understand, and often the attempt\r\nadequately to translate this poet had to be given up in despair.\r\nHowever, Mirza Shaffy admitted that some of his poems had substance in\r\nthem. Uhland and Geibel were not much to his mind. One day, Bodenstedt\r\ntranslated into Tartar a song by the latter, which we in our turn thus\r\nrender into English:\r\n\r\n    The silent water lily\r\n      Springs from the earth below,\r\n    The leaves all greenly glitter,\r\n      The cup is white as snow.\r\n\r\n    The moon her golden radiance\r\n      Pours from the heavens down,\r\n    Pours all her beams of glory\r\n      This virgin flower to crown.\r\n\r\n    And, in the azure water,\r\n      A swan of dazzling white\r\n    Floats longing round the lily,\r\n      That trances all his sight.\r\n\r\n    Ah low he sings, ah sadly,\r\n      Fainting with sweetest pain;\r\n    O lily, snow white lily,\r\n      Hear'st thou the dying strain?\r\n\r\nMirza Shaffy cast the song aside, with the words, \"A foolish swan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't the song please you?\" asked the translator.\r\n\r\n\"The conclusion is foolish,\" replied the Tartar; \"what does the swan\r\ngain by fainting?--he only suffers himself, and does no good to the\r\nrose. I would have ended--\r\n\r\n    \"Then in his beak he takes it,\r\n      And bears it with him home.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ross, the editor of _Allgemeine Auswanderungszeitung_ (Universal\r\nJournal of Emigration), an excellent and useful German periodical, has\r\njust published in Germany the _Auswanderer's Handbuch_ (Emigrant's\r\nManual), devoted especially to the service of those who design\r\nemigrating to the United States. His manual is a valuable collection of\r\nwhatever a new comer into this country should know. The constitution and\r\npolitical arrangements of the Union, its legislation, its means of\r\nintercourse, the peculiarities of soil and climate proper to different\r\nsections, the state of agriculture, and the chances of employment for\r\npersons of different classes, professions, and degrees of education, are\r\nall given. Mr. Ross was himself born in the United States, and\r\nunderstands what he writes about. At the same time his book gives a fair\r\nand thorough view of the difficulties with which the emigrant to this\r\ncountry must contend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Pesth, Hungary, is about to appear a biographical work on Hungarian\r\nstatesmen and orators who were prominent before the revolutionary\r\nperiod. Paul Nagy, Eugen Beöthy, Franz Déak, Stephan Bezerédy,\r\nBartholomaus Szemere, the two Wesselenyis, the two Dionys Pazmandys,\r\nStephan Szechényi, and Joseph Eötvos (the last known in the United\r\nStates by translations of his novels), are among the characters\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new book on the new world is the _Europa ed America_, by Dr. ANT.\r\nCACCIA, an Italian litterateur, who has apparently been in this country\r\nand describes it, as he professes to do, from nature. He says that he\r\nfound the people of New-York occupied mainly in making money.\r\n\r\nThe German authoress FANNY LEWALD, has in press a book entitled _England\r\nund Schottland_ (England and Scotland), made up from the notes of a\r\njourney through those countries. Its publication just at this moment is\r\nfor the benefit of the crowds of Germans who are going to the World's\r\nFair, and who may find in it all sorts of preparatory information. A\r\nspecimen chapter published in one of our German papers reads pleasantly.\r\nFanny Lewald is a phenomenon, of a class of women who know something\r\nabout every thing. Nothing is too high or too low to become an object of\r\nconsideration to these female Teufelsdröcks, petticoated professors of\r\n\"the science of things in general.\" The intellectual cultivation among\r\nthe middle and higher class of society in Prussia, the patronage\r\nbestowed by the court upon learning, the arts, and sciences; the\r\nencouragement to discuss freely every imaginable theme in politics or\r\nreligion, with the single exception of the measures of the\r\nadministration, all tended to create a taste for mental display in which\r\nit was necessary that women should participate, if they wished to retain\r\ntheir old position in the social world. In the salons of Berlin,\r\ntherefore, women have been heard taking a prominent part in\r\nconversations in which the most abstruse questions in religion,\r\npolitics, and general science were discussed. The philosophers, male and\r\nfemale, debarred by the spy system from any open investigation of\r\npassing political events, revenged themselves by treating these events\r\nas mere temporary phases of the great system of evolutions which forms\r\nthe _material_ of history, scarcely worthy of notice, and directed their\r\nattention to the great principles which underlie all great social and\r\nreligious developments. A strange tone was thus given to conversation.\r\nListening to the talkers at a Berlin conversazione, one might have\r\nfancied, judging from the nature of the subjects of conversation, that a\r\nnumber of gods and goddesses were debating on the construction of a\r\nworld. Vulgar bricks and mortar they ignored, and were anxious only\r\nabout primary and secondary geological formations. The actual state of\r\nany society was scarcely cared for, except in illustration of a\r\nprinciple, and the great forces which must unite to form the best\r\npossible society, were the only subjects of investigation. It may be\r\ntaken as a great proof of the wonderful facility of adaptation of the\r\nfemale mind, that women joined in these conversations as readily as men,\r\nand frequently with far more brilliancy, in spite of the range of\r\nreading which it must require to obtain even a superficial knowledge of\r\nthe subjects of discourse. Fanny Lewald is one of these prodigies. She\r\nhas studied every thing from the Hegelian philosophy downwards. She is\r\nas great in revolutions as in ribbons, and is as amusing when talking\r\nsentiment over oysters and Rheinwein, in the Rathskiller at Bremen, as\r\nwhen meditating upon ancient art and philosophy in Wilhelm von\r\nHumboldt's castle of Tegel near Berlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have read with great interest a series of articles which have\r\nappeared in the recent numbers of the _Grenzboten_ upon GEORGE SAND.\r\nThough we have often failed to agree with the view of the writer, Mr.\r\nJulian Schmidt, one of the editors of that paper, we have rarely met\r\nwith literary criticism of more ability, and a more just and catholic\r\nspirit. We translate the conclusion of the last article, in which Mr.\r\nSchmidt gives the result of his careful analysis of all the works of the\r\nauthor: \"The novel, on account of its lax and variable form, and the\r\ncaprice which it tolerates, is in my opinion not to be reckoned among\r\nthose kinds of art, which, as classic, will endure to posterity. The\r\nauthors who have been most read in modern times have already been\r\nchecked in their popularity by the greater attraction of novelty offered\r\nby their successors. This is the case even with Walter Scott. Besides,\r\nin most of her writings, George Sand has dealt with problems whose\r\njustification later times will not understand; and thus it may happen\r\nthat hereafter she will be regarded as of consequence in the history of\r\nliterature alone. But in that sphere she will have a permanent\r\nimportance. Future centuries will regard her as the most significant\r\nimage of the morbid but intense striving which marks this generation.\r\nWhen it has long been agreed that the lauded works of Victor Hugo,\r\nEugene Sue, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, and others, are but the barren\r\noutgrowths of an untamed and unrestrained fancy, and a perverted\r\nreflection; when the same verdict has been pronounced on the poems of M.\r\nde Chateaubriand, whose value is now taken as a matter of belief and\r\nconfidence, because there are few who have read them; then the true\r\npoetic element in the works of George Sand will, in spite of all its\r\nvagaries, still be recognized. And more than this, since the period of\r\nsentimentalism will be seen as more extensive, and as the works of\r\nRichardson, Rousseau (of course only those which belong in this\r\ncategory), and of Madame de Staël and others, will be included in it,\r\nthen we say that the better productions of our authoress will carry off\r\nthe prize from all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo collections of songs, national and lyric, have made their appearance\r\nin Germany. The one is by GEORGE SCHERER, and is called _Deutsche\r\nVolkshelier_, the other, by WOLFGAND MENZEL, is entitled _Die Gesange\r\nder Volker_ (The Songs of the Nations). The former is exclusively\r\nGerman; the latter contains songs from every civilized tongue under\r\nheaven, as well as from many of the uncivilized, in German versions, of\r\ncourse. Both are elegantly printed, and highly commended by the knowing\r\nin that line of literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRI MURGER has published a companion volume to his _Scènes de la\r\nBohéme_ in the shape of some stories called _Scènes de la Vie de\r\nJeunesse_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA curious specimen of what may be done by a ready writer who is\r\nscrupulous only about getting his pay, is afforded by a book just\r\npublished at Leipzic, called _Zahme Geschichten aus wilder Zeit_ (Tame\r\nStories of a Wild Time), by Frederick Ebeling. In these \"tame stories\"\r\nthe heroes of the late revolutionary movements are held up now in one\r\nlight, and now in another, with the most striking disregard of\r\nconsistency. Jellachich, for instance, is lauded in one place as the\r\nmost genial and charming of men, a scholar and gentleman, without equal,\r\nand almost in the next page he is called a ferocious butcher, who never\r\nwearies of slaughtering human beings. These discrepancies are accounted\r\nfor by the fact that Mr. Ebeling wrote for both conservative and radical\r\njournals, and adapted his opinions to the wants of the market he was\r\nserving. He would have done well to reconcile his articles with each\r\nother before putting them into a book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA valuable work on national law is entitled _Du Droits et des Devoirs\r\ndes Nations Neutres en Temps de Guerre Maritime_, by M. L. B.\r\nHautefeuille, a distinguished French jurist, lately published at Paris\r\nin four octavos. It is praised by no less an authority than the eminent\r\nadvocate M. Chaix d'Est Ange, as the fruit of mature and conscientious\r\nstudy: he calls it the most complete and one of the best works on modern\r\nnational law ever produced. The author in the historical part of his\r\ntreatise, criticises the monopolizing spirit and policy of the English\r\nwithout mercy, and insists that the balance of power on the sea is of no\r\nless importance than that on land. He would have established a permanent\r\nalliance of armed neutrality, with France and the United States at its\r\nhead, to maintain the maritime rights of weaker states in time of war,\r\nagainst the encroachments of British commerce and ambition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Vienna publishing establishment has offered GRILLPARZER, the German\r\ndramatist, $4,000 for his writings, but he refuses, not because he\r\nthinks the price too low, but because he will not take the trouble of\r\npreparing and publishing a collected edition of his dramas, the last of\r\nwhich was entitled _Maximilian Robespierre_, a five act tragedy. He has\r\nalso a variety of unpublished manuscripts, which it is feared will never\r\nsee the light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStudents and amateurs of music will find their account in taking the\r\n_Rheinische Musikzeitung_ (Rhine Musical Gazette), published at Cologne,\r\nunder the editorial care of Prof. Bisehof. Its criticism is impartial,\r\nintelligent, and free from the prejudices of the schools. German musical\r\ncriticism has no better organ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German poet SIMROCK has just published a new version of the two\r\nEddas, with the mythical narratives of the Skalda, which is spoken of as\r\na valuable contribution to literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries_ held its annual session on\r\nthe 15th February at the palace of Christianbourg, the King of Denmark\r\npresiding. Mr. RAFN read the report of the transactions of the Society\r\nduring the year, and laid before the meeting a new number of the Annals\r\nof the archaeology and history of the North, and the completed volume of\r\nthe Archaeological Journal, published by the Society. He also announced\r\nthat the second volume of his own work on Russian Antiquities was in\r\npreparation, and that about half of it was already printed. To give an\r\nidea of this work, he read from it a biographical notice on Biorucon, of\r\nArngeirr, an Icelander by birth, distinguished alike as a warrior and a\r\npoet, and by his exploits in Russia where he served Vladimir the Great.\r\nAfter this, other members of the Society gave interesting accounts of\r\nthe results of their various labors during the year. The King presented\r\na paper on excavations made under his personal direction in the ruins of\r\nthe castles of Saborg and Adserbo, in the North of Seland. These castles\r\ndate from the middle ages; the memoir was accompanied by drawings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Historisches Tashcenbuch_ (Historical Pocket-Book), edited by the\r\nlearned Prussian Raumer is a publication eminently worthy of notice. The\r\nnumber for the year 1851 opens with biographical sketches of three\r\nwomen, Ines de Castro and Maria and Lenora Telley, who played important\r\nparts in Spanish and Portuguese history in the XIVth Century. They are\r\nfollowed by a concise history of the German marine by Bartholdy, twelve\r\nletters by John Voigt on the manners and social life of the princes at\r\nthe German Diets, a picture from the XVIth Century, the sequel of a\r\nmemoir by Guhrauer on Elizabeth, Abbess of Herford, a friend of William\r\nPenn, and a correspondent of Malebranche, Leibnitz and Descartes, &c.,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of a most eventful period and country is the\r\n_Bilder aus Oestreich_, just published at Leipzic, by a German\r\ntraveller. The traveller is understood to be one of the editors of the\r\n_Grenzboten_, and the period he describes comprises the revolutionary\r\nyears 1848-9. His account of Vienna in the memorable October days of\r\n1848, is graphic, and even thrilling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOTTA, of Stuttgart, has just published a new collection of poems by\r\nFRANZ DINGELSTEDT, under the title of \"Night and Morning.\" The themes\r\nare drawn from the revolution, its hopes and its disappointments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFREDERIC LOUIS JAHN, the celebrated German professor, who invented the\r\nmodern system of gymnastics, is writing his personal memoirs. He is\r\nabout seventy years of age, and his long life has been full of\r\nsignificant incidents.\r\n\r\nTo those who seek a good acquaintance with the current belles-lettres\r\nliterature of Germany, we can cordially recommend the _Deutsches\r\nMuseum_, published semi-monthly at Leipsic, under the editorial care of\r\nProfessor Robert Prutz and Wilhelm Wolffson, and sold in this city by\r\nWestermann, 290 Broadway. Each number contains eighty-five close pages,\r\nfilled by some of the leading writers of German science, art and\r\npolitics. In the number now before us, are articles by Gutzkow, Böch,\r\nthe philologist, Berthold Auerbach, Emanuel Geibel and Julius Mosen. The\r\nentire range of politics, philosophy, antiquities, art, poetry, romances\r\nand literary criticism is included in the scope of the _Museum_, except\r\nthat it is designed not for the learned world, but for the mass of the\r\npeople, and accordingly aims at general not technical instruction. Among\r\nthe art notices, we observe a brief criticism on the Gallery of\r\nIllustrious Americans, in which the lithography of the pictures is\r\npraised as well as the faces themselves. The critic is delighted with\r\nthe energy, originality and freshness of character expressed in their\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA valuable contribution to current political history is the\r\n_Verfassungskampf in Kurhessen_ (Constitutional Struggle in Electoral\r\nHesse), by Dr. H. Gräfe, which has just made its appearance in Germany.\r\nThe conflict of the people and parliament and public officers, against\r\nthe selfish, arbitrary and foolish Elector, is the turning point of\r\nrecent German politics, and the defeat of the former after their\r\npatience and firmness, acting always within the limits of the\r\nconstitution, had gained a decided victory, and compelled the faithless\r\nprince to fly the country,--a defeat accomplished only by the\r\nintervention of Austrian and Prussian troops, was the final downfall of\r\nevery form of political liberty in Germany. Dr. Gräfe has wisely\r\nabstained from treating the events of this crisis as a philosophical\r\nhistorian; they are too fresh, and his own share in them was too decided\r\nto allow him to undertake that successfully. He accordingly does little\r\nmore than simply report the transactions in a compendious way, with all\r\nthe documents necessary to a full understanding of the subject. Whoever\r\nwishes for a thorough apprehension of the German tragi-comedy, may\r\nderive aid from his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe resources of philology have just been enriched by the publication at\r\nTubingen of a dictionary of six of the dialects of Eastern Africa,\r\nnamely, the Kisuaheli, Kinika, Kikamba, Kipokomo, Kihian, and Kigalla.\r\nThis is accompanied by a translation of Mark's Gospel into the Kikamba\r\ndialect, and a short grammar of the Kisuaheli. The author of these works\r\nis the Protestant minister Krap, who has been for fifteen years in\r\nEthiopia, and has collected and presented to the University at Tubingen\r\na considerable number of most valuable Ethiopian manuscripts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA notable and interesting book is BEHSE'S _Geschichte des preussischen\r\nHofes und Adels_ (History of the Prussian Court and Nobility) of which\r\nthe two first volumes have just been published at Hamburg by Hoffman &\r\nCampe. The whole work will contain from thirty to forty small volumes,\r\nand will treat all the states of Germany, only some half dozen volumes\r\nbeing devoted to Prussia. The two now published bring the history down\r\nto the reign of Frederic William II. They abound in most curious\r\nhistoric details. For instance, the acquisition of the title of King of\r\nPrussia by the Elector of Brandenburgh, Frederic III., is narrated at\r\nlength. It seems that this prince, who was deformed in body, but as\r\npolitic as he was ambitious in spirit, after many fruitless efforts\r\nobtained from the Emperor at Vienna the grant of the royal dignity, by a\r\nbribe of two hundred thousand thalers, paid to the Jesuit Father Wolff,\r\nas a compensation for the influence of the Society, whose members were\r\nflattered that the most powerful of the Protestant princes of Germany\r\nshould solicit their assistance. The whole cost of the grant was six\r\nmillions of thalers, an enormous sum for these times. The Papal Court\r\nrefused to recognize the new king, and did not until Frederic the Great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe a general _Biographical Dictionary of Illustrious Women_, now\r\nin course of publication in Berlin, is to be reproduced here, with\r\nsuitable additions. We need, while discussions of the sphere and\r\ncapacities of women are so common among us, a work of real learning and\r\nauthority, in which the part which the sex has borne and is capable of\r\nbearing in the business of civilizing, shall be carefully and honestly\r\nexhibited. There are fifteen or twenty volumes of short biographies of\r\nwomen now in print in this country, with prospects of others--all\r\nworthless except this extensive German work, which is considerably\r\nadvanced, and for its literary merit as well as for the interest of its\r\nmaterials, will command an unusual degree of attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCountess Ida Hahn Hahn is writing a work to be called _My Way from\r\nDarkness to Light, from Error to Truth_. She has became a Catholic, and\r\nthis book is intended to tell why. A cheap edition of her works is\r\npublishing at Berlin. We presume they are no longer in her control, but\r\nbelong to her publishers, as she could scarcely consent to reprint some\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new work bearing as its title the single word _Italia_, is about to be\r\npublished at Frankfort on the Main.

This man was\r\nthe _studiosus philologiæ_, Alexander von Humboldt, who came, as he\r\nsaid, to go through again what he had neglected in his youth. When we\r\nmet him in the lecture-room we respectfully made way for him; for though\r\nwe had no respect for any body, especially professors, Humboldt was an\r\nexception, for he knew 'a hellish deal.' To his own honor, the German\r\nstudent still respects this quality. During the lecture Humboldt sat on\r\nthe fourth or fifth bench near the window, where he drew a piece of\r\npaper from a portfolio in his pocket, and took notes. In going home he\r\nliked to accompany Böckh, so as in conversation to build some logical\r\nbridge or other from the old world to the new, after his ingenious\r\nfashion. There was then in the class a man who has since distinguished\r\nhimself in political literature, but whom we had nicknamed 'Mosherosh,'\r\nthat is Calves'-head, on account of his stupid appearance. As Mosherosh\r\ngenerally came in late, it was the fashion to receive him with a\r\nmagnificent round of stamping. One day, Humboldt came too late, and just\r\nat the usual time of Mosherosh, and without looking up we gave the\r\nregular round, while Humboldt, blushing and embarrassed, made his way to\r\nhis place. In a moment the mistake was seen, and a good-natured laugh\r\nsucceeded. Humboldt also attended the evening lectures of Ritter on\r\nuniversal geography, and let the weather be as bad as it might, the\r\ngray-haired man never failed. If for a rarity he chanced not to come, we\r\nsaid among ourselves in students' jargon, 'Alexander cuts the college\r\nto-day, because he's gone to King's to tea.' Once, on occasion of\r\ndiscussing an important problem of physical geography, Ritter quoted\r\nhim, and every body looked up at him. Humboldt bowed to us, with his\r\nusual good nature, which put the youngsters into the happiest humor. We\r\nfelt ourselves elevated by the presence of this great thinker and most\r\nlaborious student. We seemed to be joined with him in the pursuit of\r\ngreat scientific ends.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rewards of Authors, we suspect, are greatest in France. In Germany,\r\nEngland and the United States they are about the same. Cooper, Irving\r\nand Prescott, in this country, have each received for copyrights more\r\nthan one hundred thousand dollars. In England, Dickens has probably\r\nreceived more than any other living author--and in France Lamartine,\r\nVictor Hugo, Dumas, Scribe, Thiers, and many others, have obtained large\r\nfortunes by writing. In Germany Dieffenbach received for his book on\r\nOperative Surgery some $3,500; and Perthes of Hamburg, paid to Neander\r\non a single work, more than $20,000, exclusive of the interest his heirs\r\nstill have in it. Poets like Uhland, Freiligrath, Geibel, have also\r\nreceived as much as $6,000 or $12,000 on the sales of a single volume.\r\nLong ago in Boston, Robert Treat Paine received $1,500 for a song. Of\r\nour living poets, Longfellow has been most liberally paid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephens, the learned translator of the _Frithiof's Saga_ of\r\nBISHOP TEGNER, in a letter to _The International_ states that he is now\r\nprinting at Copenhagen three Anglo-Saxon poems of the eleventh century,\r\nnamely: _The Old Testament Story, On the Sixth Day's Work_, and _The New\r\nTestament Story_, by Aelfric, Archbishop of York, now just translated\r\ninto the metre and alliteration of the original. The three poems will\r\nmake a quarto volume of about thirty sheets, and copies may be ordered\r\n(price three dollars), through the Hon. H. W. Ellsworth, late United\r\nStates _Charge d'Affaires_ in Sweden, at New-York, or Dr. S. H. Smith,\r\nof Cincinnati. Of the ability and fidelity with which the work will be\r\nexecuted, the readers of the Frithiof's Saga need no other assurance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Etherization,\" after all, is not a modern discovery, and Wells,\r\nJackson, and Morton, are alike undeserving of the praise they have\r\nreceived on account of it. The Paris _Siècle_ states that a manuscript,\r\nwritten by Papin, known, for his experiments connected with the motive\r\npower of steam, has been discovered near Marburg in Electoral Hesse;\r\nthat the work bears the name of _Traité des Opérations sans Douleur_,\r\nand that in it are examined the different means that might be employed\r\nto deaden, or altogether nullify, sensibility when surgical operations\r\nare being performed on the human body, Papin composed this work in 1681,\r\nbut his contemporaries treated it with ridicule, and he abandoned the\r\nmedical profession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new five-act play, tragic of course, has just appeared at Berlin,\r\nfounded on the history of Philip Augustus of France. It is by a lady of\r\nthe aristocratic circles of the Prussian capital, who now makes her\r\ndebut in literature. It is praised as excellent by those who are not in\r\nthe habit of being satisfied with the writings of ladies. A collection\r\nof poems from the same pen is shortly to appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Bianchi's _Turkish and French Dictionary_, in two large octavos, has\r\nreached a second edition at Paris. It is all that could be desired for\r\nthe use of diplomatic and consular agents, traders, navigators, and\r\nother travellers in the Levant, but not designed for critics in the\r\nlanguage or its literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe students of geography and foreign modes of life, owe a debt to the\r\nFrench General DAUMAS, for his three works on north-western Africa. The\r\nfirst entitled, _Le Sahara Algerien_, is an exact and thorough and\r\nscientific account of the desert in Algiers, given, however, with a flow\r\nof manly, soldatesque imagination, which imparts life and charm to the\r\nnarrative, and even adorned with frequent quotations from the Arab\r\npoets, who have sung the various localities he describes. The second of\r\nthese works is called _Le Grand Desert_: in form it is a series of\r\nromances, the author having chosen that as the best manner of conveying\r\nto the reader a distinct impression. The hero is a dweller in the\r\ninterior, a member of the tribe of Chambas, who came to Algiers, as he\r\nsays, because he had predestined him to make that journey. The general\r\ninterrogates him, and the Arab recounts his adventures. As he had thrice\r\ntraversed the desert to the negro country beyond, and had seen beside\r\nall the usual events in the life of that savage region, the author\r\nviolates no probability in putting into his mouth the most strange and\r\ncharacteristic stories. The whole are told with a fictitious\r\nreproduction of the teser and somewhat monotonous, yet figurative style,\r\nproper to all savages. _La Grande Kabylie_ recounts the personal\r\nexperiences of the author in that yet unconquered country of the Arabs,\r\nwhither he went with Marshal Bugeaud in his last expedition. Kabylia he\r\ndescribes as a picturesque and productive region. There are deep,\r\nsheltered valleys, where along the shores of winding streams, nature has\r\nplanted hedges of perpetual flowers, while the mountains on each side\r\nstand yellow with the ripe and ripening grain. The people are braver and\r\nmore energetic, their habitations more substantial, and their fields\r\nmore valuable than those in other parts of Algeria. Gen. Daumas would\r\nhave France subjugate this country and add it to her African dominions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. de Conches, who is well known for his illustrations of early French\r\nliterature, is an enthusiastic admirer of La Fontaine: and he has spent\r\na vast sum in having printed _one copy_ only, and for himself alone, of\r\nan edition of his works, illustrated by the first artists of the day,\r\naccompanied by notes and prefaces of the most eminent writers, and\r\nforming a very miracle of expensive and _recherché_ typography and\r\nbinding. Dibdin had never so good a subject for his _Bibliomania_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJules Sandeau, one of the most _spirituel_ and elegant of French romance\r\nwriters, announced a new novel, _Catherine_, to appear on the 15th of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother book on the _Fall of Louis Philippe_ has been published at Paris\r\nby M.

It is in the Orleanist interest, and is\r\npraised by the _Journal des Débats_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most profligate woman of whom we have any account in Roman history\r\nwas the empress Massalina, and nothing is more natural than that she\r\nshould be selected for a heroin by a Frenchman. In a new five act play\r\nof which the Parisian journals give us elaborate criticisms, she is\r\nrepresented as a very virtuous wife, by the ingenious contrivance of\r\ngiving a certain courtezan such a striking personal resemblance to her\r\nthat it was impossible to distinguish between the two, and making the\r\ncourtezan commit all the atrocities of the real Massalina. The play is\r\nnot without literary merit. It is called _Valeria_--the heroine's\r\n_other_ name being considered too strong to figure on a play-bill.\r\nRachel plays the two characters of Massalina and the courtezan--of\r\ncourse with the most perfect success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new Review has been established in Paris under the title of _La\r\nPolitique Nouvelle_. It comes out as the rival of the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, and as the champion of the new republican _régime_ (as opposed\r\nto the conservative tendencies of the older established Review), offers\r\nbattle with a promising array of names of future contributors. The\r\ndepartment of English criticism is confided to M. Léon de Wailly, author\r\nof _Stella and Vanessa_ and the translator of Burns; whose name promises\r\na knowledge and intelligent appreciation of English literature. The\r\nfirst two numbers contain contributions from the brilliant and caustic\r\npen of Eugene Pelletan, and a serial from Madame Charles Reybaud, author\r\nof the _Cadet de Calubrieres, Helene, &c_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo, since the appearance of the last volume of _Le Rhine_, four\r\nor five years ago, has not printed a new book. The proprietor of his\r\ncopyrights, who had brought out two splendid editions of his complete\r\nworks, one in twenty-five volumes, and another, illustrated by the best\r\nartists of France, in twelve, made a contract with him by which he has\r\nbeen prevented from any original publications. The term is now nearly\r\nexpired, and it is announced that he will at once issue three volumes of\r\npoetry, and twelve of romances. He is now engaged in finishing a novel\r\nentitled _Misery_, which is spoken of by those who have seen portions of\r\nit as a magnificent work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. de St. Beuve, since October, 1849, the literary critic of _Le\r\nConstitutionnel_, a writer who has pushed himself up in the world far\r\nahead of his merits, has published at Paris a volume, _Causeries du\r\nLundi_ (Monday Gossipings), which is no great things. These gossipings\r\nare taken from the columns of that journal, where they are regularly\r\npublished on Mondays, and where we have occasionally had the benefit of\r\nseeing them. If they were not written by a member of the French Academy,\r\nand an eminent _litterateur_, we should say they were rather stupid, as\r\nfar as ideas go, and not very elegant in respect of style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had recently the _Cooks of Paris_, in a handsome volume, with\r\nportraits; _The Journals and Editors of Paris_, in another volume, and\r\nnow one Paul Lacroix, sometimes called _bibliophile Jacob_, has\r\nannounced a _History_, _Political_, _Civil_, _Religious_, _Military_,\r\n_Legislative_, _Judicial_, _Moral_, _Literary_, _and Anecdotic_, _of the\r\nShoe and the Bootmakers of France_. He treats of the ancient\r\ncorporations, their discipline, regulations, and of the fraternities,\r\nwith their obligations and devices, sketching the whole history of _La\r\nChaussure_. Shoemakers have been well represented among the famous men\r\nof all nations, and the craft may be proud of Hans Sachs, Jacob Boehme,\r\nGifford, Bloomfield, Drew, Holcraft, Lackington, Sherman, William Carey,\r\nGeorge Fox, and a hundred others, besides the heroes of Monsieur\r\nLacroix.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Bibliophile Jacob_ LACROIX, we see by the Paris papers, has also\r\ndiscovered a _comedie-ballet_ by Molière, written in 1654, and never\r\nincluded in any edition of his works. It is entitled _Le Ballet des\r\nincompatibies_, and appears to have been written by order of the Prince\r\nde Conti, and acted before him by Molière himself and other persons of\r\nthe Prince's circle. That it remained so long unknown is explained by\r\nthe circumstance of a few copies only having been printed for the\r\nfavored spectators. The plot is described as ingenious, and the verses\r\nnot unworthy of the author. It is known that when the Prince de Conti\r\npresided over the states of Languedoc in 1654, he invited thither\r\nMolière and his company. He professed so much admiration for the actor\r\nthat he offered him the confidential situation of secretary, which was\r\ndeclined; but it seems natural enough that he should have shown his\r\ngratitude by composing one of those entertainments which cost him so\r\nlittle trouble. This Prince de Conti was at one time so passionately\r\nfond of theatricals that he made it his occupation to seek out subjects\r\nfor new plays, but at a later period he wrote a treatise in which\r\ntheatres were severely condemned on religious grounds, and Molière\r\nhimself was personally and violently attacked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the new biographical works announced in Paris, is one on the Life,\r\nVirtues and Labors of the late Right Rev. Dr. FLAGET, Roman Catholic\r\nBishop of Bardstown and Louisville, Kentucky. The author is a clergyman,\r\nwho accompanied the late Bishop in one of his last missions to Europe.\r\nBishop Flaget died at the age of eighty-seven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Xavier Marmier, whose visit to the United States we noticed some\r\nmonths ago, has published his _Letters on Canada, the United States,\r\nCuba, and Rio La Plata_, in two volumes--constituting one of the most\r\nagreeable works ever published in Paris upon this country. We shall\r\nsoon, we believe, have occasion to review a translation of the Letters,\r\nby a New-Yorker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGuizot and Thiers--the most eminent living statesmen of France, as well\r\nas her greatest living historians--were for a long time connected with\r\nthe Paris journals, and each made his first appearance as a writer in\r\ncriticisms on the Fine Arts. For several years the former published\r\nseries of articles on the exhibitions of the Louvre, which were\r\nremarkable both for artistic knowledge and literary _verve_. The latter\r\nalso published in 1810 a pamphlet on the exhibition in the Louvre, which\r\nexcited great sensation--more, however, from its having a political\r\ntendency than for its critical importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

Mignet is perpetual\r\nSecretary of the Academy of Moral Sciences, and was for many years head\r\nof the department of Archives in the Foreign Office. As a man of letters\r\nand a sedulous inquirer, no French author enjoys higher reputation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLamartine has just published in Paris _The History of the Restoration,\r\nfrom 1814 to_ 1830, in eight volumes.

The book continues to be\r\npraised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Romance and Tales, said to have been written by NAPOLEON BONAPARTE,\r\nwhen he was a youth, are announced for publication in the Paris\r\n_Siècle_. Though the _Siècle_ is a very respectable journal, and it\r\nengages that these compositions are perfectly authentic, and shall be\r\naccompanied by proofs of their genuineness, we do not believe a word of\r\nthe pretence of their authorship. It is a fact, however, not unworthy of\r\nnote, in a psychological point of view, that the earliest development of\r\nNapoleon's ambition and powers, before a fit field of action had been\r\nopened to them, was in a literary form. At the age of fifteen, when at\r\nthe royal school at Paris, he voluntarily prepared a memoir upon the\r\nluxury and expense attending education at that place, in which he urged\r\nthe propriety of the students adopting hardy habits and a simple fare,\r\nand themselves to such toils and exposure as they would encounter in\r\nwar. In 1787, at the age of eighteen, at Valence, he gained,\r\nanonymously, a prize proposed to the Academy of Lyons by the Abbé\r\nRaynal, on the question, \"What are the principles and institutions best\r\nadapted to advance mankind in happiness?\" In this essay he defined\r\nhappiness as consisting in the \"perfect enjoyment of life according to\r\nthe laws of our physical and moral organization:\" and the forcible\r\nviews, well adapted to the temper of the times, and the vivid style of\r\nwriting, attracted much attention. When he was emperor, he was one day\r\nconversing with Talleyrand about this essay, and the latter, a few days\r\nafter, took occasion to present it to him, having procured it from the\r\narchives of the academy at Lyons. The emperor took it, and after reading\r\na few pages, threw it into the fire, saying, \"One can never observe\r\nevery thing.\" Talleyrand had not taken the precaution to transcribe it;\r\nbut it has been said that Louis Bonaparte had had it copied, and that it\r\nis now in print. About the same time he began a history of Corsica,\r\nwhich he dedicated to the Abbé Raynal, by whom he had been noticed and\r\ncaressed. He corresponded with Paoli in relation to it, and was in\r\ntreaty with M. Joly, a bookseller of Dole, for its publication. Raynal,\r\nwho read the manuscript, advised its completion; but some change of\r\npurpose prevented its being finished, and it is now lost. During his\r\nresidence at Auxonne, in 1790, Napoleon wrote and printed a letter to\r\nButtafoco, the Corsican deputy for the nobles in the National Assembly.\r\nIt is a brilliant and powerful piece of argument and invective, strongly\r\non the revolutionary side. It produced a marked impression, and was\r\nadopted and reprinted by the patriotic society at Ajaccio. While at\r\nMarseilles, in 1793, Napoleon wrote and published a political dialogue,\r\ncalled \"The Supper of Beaucaire\"--a judicious, sensible, and able essay,\r\nintended to allay the agitation then existing in that city. A copy of it\r\nwas brought to him in later days, but seeing no advantage in reviving,\r\nunder the circumstances of a different time, a production written for a\r\ntemporary and local excitement, he ordered its suppression.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Life of Calvin, by Paul Henry, has been translated from the German\r\nby the Rev. Dr. Henry Stebbing, of London, and we have the first of the\r\ntwo octavos of which it consists, from the press of Robert Carter &\r\nBrothers. So much inexcusable ignorance, so much perverse\r\nmisrepresentation, so much insolent lying, may be found scattered\r\nthrough modern literature, respecting the great Genevan, that Dr. Henry\r\ndeserves well the thanks of the christian world for exhibiting the chief\r\nfacts of his history, so plainly that every partisan knave who would\r\nrepeat the old slanders, shall be silent hereafter for very shame. John\r\nCalvin was unquestionably subject to the infirmities of our human\r\nnature; so was John Milton; but the inherent and indefectable greatness\r\nof these two men was such, that they dwell apart like stars, in glory\r\nscarcely approachable by mortal virtue or intelligence. John Calvin and\r\nJohn Milton were in an extraordinary degree the authors of modern\r\ninstitutions of liberty, and it would be difficult to decide which has\r\nmost merit of this praise. The late Albert Gallatin was wont to say that\r\nwhen we celebrated our condition on the fourth of July, we should first\r\ndrink to the memory of John Calvin, and then to the immediate authors of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. Mr. Gallatin did not hold to all the\r\ndogmas of Calvin, but he could not speak of the creatures--like Dyer,\r\nfor example--who employ their pennyworth of wit to prejudice the vulgar\r\nagainst him, without some signs of scorn. We can never forget his\r\nmerciless characterization of a malicious feeble-mind, who in a book\r\nentitled _A Monograph of Moral Sense_, declared that Calvin never had\r\nenough humanity in his nature to select even one verse by the\r\n_Evangelists_ for pulpit illustration,--though the Reformer really\r\npreached some folio volumes of commentaries upon the Gospels, preached\r\nfrom them as much as he did from any other portion of the Bible. This\r\nperson--his name was Smith--was not more reckless of truth than it has\r\nbeen the fashion for anti-Calvinists to be, when writing of that great\r\nman and his doctrines, which they seem to have thought could be put down\r\nby petty libels.\r\n\r\nCalvin is now being born into a new life, as it were; the critics and\r\nprinters of each particular language are as busy with him as the English\r\nhave been with Shakspeare. His amazing wit, and genius, and learning,\r\nare found as attractive and powerful now as they were three hundred\r\nyears ago. And this life of him by Henry, embodying whatever of\r\ncontemporary records is most needful for the illustration of his\r\nwritings, will be likely to have a large sale with every class of\r\nhistorical students, as they discover that the popular and partisan\r\nnotions of him are untrue. Certainly no one should attempt to form an\r\nopinion of Calvin without thoroughly acquainting himself with Henry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Paris, M. MILLER, librarian to the Assembly, has made an important\r\ndiscovery among some old Greek MSS. of a lost work by Origen. The\r\n_Journal des Débats_ describes the original work as being in ten books;\r\nthe first of which is already known to the world under the title of\r\n_Philosophumena_. The last seven books have just been printed at the\r\nuniversity press in Oxford, under the editorial direction of M. Miller,\r\nwho went to England for that purpose. They make an octavo volume of\r\nabout three hundred and fifty pages. The _Débats_ says the work is \"a\r\nrefutation of heresies, in which the author endeavors to prove that the\r\nheresiarchs have all taken their doctrines from the ancient\r\nphilosophers:\"--a very curious task for Origen to perform, since he was\r\nhimself chiefly remarkable for the mixture of Zeno, Plato, and\r\nAristotle, which he compounded with his Christianity. But apart from its\r\ncontroversial interest, the recovered manuscript will throw new light on\r\nthe opinions and practices of the Neo-Platonists, and on the manners and\r\ncustoms of ancient times. Discoveries like this point out the necessity\r\nfor a larger and more combined action of learned societies in the search\r\nfor ancient manuscripts. Origen's _Stromata_ might even yet be\r\ncompleted: and it is not to be supposed that all the existing fragments\r\nof his _Hexapla_ were collected by Montfaucon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Constantinople we learn that very important discoveries of ancient\r\nGreek MSS. have been made, in a cave, near the foot of Mount Athos,\r\nbringing to light a vast quantity of celebrated works quoted by various\r\nancient writers, and hitherto deemed entirely lost. They furnish,\r\naccording to the accounts in the journals, an extensive list of proper\r\nnames calculated to throw great light upon many obscure periods of\r\nhistory. Among these volumes, it is said, some are calculated to give a\r\ncomplete interpretation of hieroglyphic writing--the discoverer having\r\nalready successfully applied them to the interpretation of the\r\ninscriptions engraved on the obelisk of the Hippodrome at\r\nConstantinople. This may be quite true, but such statements are to be\r\nreceived with some suspicion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA literal prose translation of Homer, by Mr. T. A. Buckley, has just\r\nappeared in London. No prose version will cause any just notion of the\r\nspirit of Homer. Of the half dozen metrical translations published\r\nrecently, we think that of our countryman Munford the best. Henry W.\r\nHerbert has given us parts of the Iliad in admirable style. No one,\r\nhowever, has yet equalled old Chapman--certainly not Pope nor Cowper.\r\nThe most successful translation into a modern language is unquestionably\r\nthe German one by Voss. Mure and Grote have written the ablest\r\ndissertations in English upon the Homeric controversy, but they are not\r\npoets, and could not if they would translate the great bard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. P. GILLIES, a contemporary of the great authors of the last age, has\r\npublished in three volumes _Memoirs of a Literary Veteran_. More than\r\nhalf a century spent in the society of the lions of literature, could\r\nhardly fail to furnish a store of amusing anecdotes, and a sprinkling of\r\ninteresting information. Mr. Gillies has also this advantage over many\r\ncollectors of similar reminiscences, that he was not only an author\r\namong authors, but that his social position in early life gave him\r\naccess to the best circles. Scott, Wordsworth, Campbell, the Ettrick\r\nShepherd, Rogers, Galt, Maginn, Haydon, and many more names of interest,\r\nfigure frequently in his pages. Upon the whole, however, his work is\r\ntedious, and quite too much occupied with matters that can be\r\nentertaining only to his most intimate associates. Gillies was one of\r\nthe early contributors to \"Blackwood,\" and figured as \"Kemperhausen\" in\r\nthe _Noctes Ambrosianæ_. He was also the originator and first editor of\r\nthe Foreign Quarterly Review, and was one of the first to make German\r\nliterature familiar in England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appears that only the Harpers' edition of Lord HOLLAND'S\r\n_Reminiscences_ is complete. The London copies are full of asterisks,\r\nmarking the places of cancelled passages. The cancellings, it was\r\nsuggested, were occasioned by the interposition of Lord John Russel. A\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_, however, (understood to be Mr. Panizzi of\r\nthe British Museum,) came out with a denial, saying \"his lordship never\r\nsaw a word of the _Reminiscences_ till after they were published, and\r\nthat no responsibility whatever could attach to him. I speak thus,\" he\r\nadds, \"of my own knowledge, and beg to inclose my name as a voucher for\r\nthe truth of this statement.\" The _Athenæum_ thinks that if Mr. Panizzi\r\nhad said \"printed\" instead of \"published,\" his voucher would have been\r\nless rashly ventured, as \"Lord John _did_ see the work before it was\r\nactually published, but not before it had been actually printed; and\r\nhere, if we be not misinformed, arises a somewhat amusing _contretemps_,\r\nwhich is likely to render the cancels ineffectual. Lord John, in fact,\r\nhad not the opportunity of interfering until the work had been so far\r\npublished to the world that an 'uncancelled' copy, with all the passages\r\nsince sought to be suppressed, had been dispatched to America beyond\r\nrecall. The next American mail will, doubtless, supply us with the whole\r\nof the suppressed passages.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the _British Association_, at Ipswich, is to commence on\r\nWednesday, July the 2d, and extend over seven or eight days.

Here we have two\r\nclever well-informed people, persuading themselves that they experience\r\nextraordinary raptures mingled with the most exquisite philosophic calm,\r\nfrom believing that unconscious matter is the cause of conscious\r\nthought, that the truest human affection is nothing worthier than the\r\nlove of a spoonful of nitric acid for a copper half-penny, and that\r\nannihilation is the most satisfactory end of human life. From such views\r\nboth the intellect and the heart of man will recoil with well-founded\r\ndisgust--his logical powers will perceive the absurdity of the argument,\r\nand his taste and affections will lead him to exclaim with Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n          ----'Great God! I'd rather be\r\n    A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn:\r\n      So might I standing on this pleasant lea\r\n    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\r\n      Have sight of Proteus, rising from the sea,\r\n    Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.'\r\n\r\n\"The new lights promised by our authors turn out to be chiefly composed\r\nof very old-fashioned rays of darkness, and, after a careful perusal,\r\nmany will come to the conclusion that the way to be a modern\r\nphilosopher, is to quote the ancients, praise Bacon, and talk 'bosh.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew editions of the works of Fielding and Smollett, profusely\r\nillustrated by Cruikshank and Kenny Meadows, will soon be published by\r\nStringer & Townsend. These great classics will never cease to be read\r\nwith the keenest relish by all the English race. The London publishers\r\nof the present edition of Fielding observe in their advertisement:\r\n\r\n     \"It is altogether unnecessary to enlarge upon the genius of\r\n     Henry Fielding. There is no man in the brilliant history of\r\n     English literature, with the single exception of Shakspeare, to\r\n     whose genius has been paid the homage of a more general\r\n     attestation. Calumny and misrepresentation--the offspring of\r\n     envy and malice--these, in his day, he had to endure or to\r\n     deride, and these, with their authors, have long sunk into\r\n     oblivion. The greatest of his contemporaries knew and\r\n     acknowledged his transcendent merit, and since his death, there\r\n     has not been one man of genius whose opinion of Fielding is\r\n     recorded, that has not spoken of him with veneration and\r\n     delight. Dr. Johnson, spite of a personal enmity, could not but\r\n     concede his extraordinary powers. Lady Mary Wortley Montague\r\n     reluctantly confessed that 'cousin Fielding' was the greatest\r\n     original genius of the age; the fastidious Gray was charmed\r\n     with him; and the more fastidious Gibbon has left his opinion\r\n     on record, that the illustrious house of Hapsburg, from which\r\n     Fielding was descended--its name erased, its towers\r\n     crumbled,--will be forgotten, when the romance of _Tom Jones_\r\n     shall flourish in eternal youth. If Coleridge classed him, as\r\n     one of the true immortals, with Shakspeare, Goëthe could not,\r\n     nor was willing to contest, that he was so; if Byron could\r\n     cheer his heart and refresh his mind with his pages, so can,\r\n     and so does, Wordsworth. In a word, the matchless drawing of\r\n     his characters, which are not likenesses from life, but copies\r\n     from Nature--the one being a shallow art, the other a\r\n     profoundly creative power--his exquisite wit, his abounding\r\n     humor, his natural and manly pathos--in these no writer of\r\n     narrative fiction has ever approached him.\r\n\r\n     \"While, therefore, nothing can be less likely than that the\r\n     fame of Fielding should ever be suffered to die, or that, as\r\n     long as literature exists it can ever diminish, nothing can be\r\n     more proper than to attempt to extend his popularity--a\r\n     consummation inevitably to be effected by producing his works\r\n     at a price accessible, and in a form attractive, to all\r\n     classes. The late Rowland Hill once observed, that it was not\r\n     fitting that the arch-enemy of mankind should have all the best\r\n     tunes to himself. In a like spirit it may be remarked, that it\r\n     ought not to be permitted to inferior writers to monopolize all\r\n     the appliances and means of popularity that art can bestow.\r\n     Accordingly, the proprietors have secured the hearty and\r\n     zealous co-operation of Kenny Meadows. It would be invidious,\r\n     and from the purpose, to institute a comparison between this\r\n     gentleman and his contemporaries; but it may be asserted that\r\n     no living artist has shown an equal versatility of genius,\r\n     which points him out as the man best fitted to trace the\r\n     many-colored life of Fielding. From the illustration, almost\r\n     page by page, of Shakspeare, where is the man but would have\r\n     shrunk? but that work of our artist has secured not merely an\r\n     English, not only a European reputation, but a world-wide\r\n     celebrity. The proprietors are assured, that from the hand of\r\n     Kenny Meadows such an edition of Fielding will proceed as we\r\n     have not yet seen, and shall not hereafter see.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Mr. JOHN BIGELOW'S work on _Jamaica_, (published a few weeks ago by\r\nPutnam,) the London _Examiner_ of April 5th, remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"It contains the most searching analysis of the present state\r\n     of Jamaica, and, moreover, the most sagacious prognostications\r\n     of the future prospects of the island that have ever been\r\n     published. Mr. Bigelow is an accomplished, acute, and liberal\r\n     American. As such, an eye-witness and a participator of the\r\n     greatest and most successful colonial experiment which the\r\n     world has ever seen, he is, necessarily, a better and more\r\n     impartial judge of the subject he treats of than any Englishman\r\n     of equal capacity and acquirement. Mr. Bigelow makes short and\r\n     easy work of planters, attornies, book-keepers, sophistries,\r\n     and Stanleys. In doing so, his language is invariably that of a\r\n     man of education and a gentleman.

In all our cities\r\nthere is remarkable activity in building; the surplus wealth of the\r\nAmerican people is largely applied for the increase of the magnificence\r\nof town and country residences--for the most part so ignorantly applied,\r\nthat the Genius of Architecture might almost be frightened from our\r\nshores by the spectacles reared here to vex and astonish the next ages.\r\nTo bring about a reform, to lead the way for rationalism, in the noblest\r\nof the practical arts, Mr. Ruskin has approved himself worthy by his\r\nprevious works. The _Stones of Venice_ will increase the fame won by his\r\n\"Modern Painters.\" The _Literary Gazette_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"It is a book for which the time is ripe, and it cannot fail to\r\n     produce the most beneficial results, directly and indirectly,\r\n     on our national architecture. The low condition into which that\r\n     has fallen has been long felt. Mr. Ruskin has undertaken to\r\n     lead us back to the first principles of the art, and, in doing\r\n     so, to enable every reader who will bestow the necessary\r\n     attention to his exposition, to discover for himself the causes\r\n     of this decline, and to master the principles, by attention to\r\n     which, the significance and dignity of the art may be restored.\r\n     The subject is one of the widest interest; but it has been so\r\n     hedged about with technical difficulties as to debar from its\r\n     study all who had not more leisure, more perseverance, and more\r\n     money, than fall to the lot of the majority of even cultivated\r\n     minds. At once popular and profound, this book will be\r\n     gratefully hailed by a circle of readers even larger than Mr.\r\n     Ruskin has found for his previous works. He has so written as\r\n     to catch the ear of all kinds of persons: 'Every man,' he says\r\n     truly, 'has at some time of his life personal interest in\r\n     architecture. He has influence on the design of some public\r\n     building; or he has to buy, or build, or alter his own house.\r\n     It signifies less, whether the knowledge of other arts be\r\n     general or not; men may live without buying pictures or\r\n     statues; but in architecture all must in some way commit\r\n     themselves; they _must_ do mischief, and waste their money, if\r\n     they do not know how to turn it to account. Churches, and\r\n     shops, and warehouses, and cottages, and small row, and place,\r\n     and terrace houses, must be built and lived in, however joyless\r\n     and inconvenient. And it is assuredly intended that all of us\r\n     should have knowledge, and act upon our knowledge, in matters\r\n     in which we are daily concerned, and not be left to the caprice\r\n     of architects, or mercy of contractors.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Those who live in cities are peculiarly dependent for\r\n     enjoyment upon the beauty of its architectural features. Shut\r\n     out from mountain, river, lake, forest, cliff, and hedgerow,\r\n     they must either find in streets and squares food for pleasant\r\n     contemplation, or be drawn into indifference by meaningless,\r\n     ill-proportioned, or unsightly forms. 'We are forced,' says Mr.\r\n     Ruskin, 'for the sake of accumulating our power and knowledge,\r\n     to live in cities; but such advantage as we have in association\r\n     with each other, is in great part counterbalanced by our loss\r\n     of fellowship with nature. We cannot all have our gardens now,\r\n     nor our pleasant fields to meditate in at eventide. Then the\r\n     function of our architecture is, as far as may be, to replace\r\n     these; to tell us about nature; to possess us with memories of\r\n     her quietness; to be solemn and full of tenderness like her,\r\n     and rich in portraitures of her; full of delicate imagery of\r\n     the flowers we can no more gather, and of the living creatures\r\n     now far away from us in their own solitude. If ever you felt or\r\n     found this in a London street; if ever it furnished you with\r\n     one serious thought, or any ray of true and gentle pleasure; if\r\n     there is in your heart a true delight in its green railings,\r\n     and dark casements, and wasteful finery of shops, and feeble\r\n     coxcombry of club-houses, it is well; promote the building of\r\n     more like them. But if they never taught you any thing, and\r\n     never made you happier as you passed beneath them, do not think\r\n     they have any mysterious goodness of occult sublimity. Have\r\n     done with the wretched affectation, the futile barbarism, of\r\n     pretending to enjoy; for, as surely as you know that the meadow\r\n     grass, meshed with fairy rings, is better than the wood\r\n     pavement cut into hexagons; and as surely as you know the fresh\r\n     winds and sunshine of the upland are better than the choke-damp\r\n     of the vault, or the gaslight of the ball-room, you may know\r\n     that the good architecture which has life, and truth, and joy\r\n     in it, is better than the bad architecture, which has death,\r\n     dishonesty, and vexation of heart in it from the beginning to\r\n     the end of time.\r\n\r\n     \"To show what this good architecture is, how it is produced,\r\n     and to what end, is the object of the present volume. It is,\r\n     consequently, purely elementary, and introductory merely to the\r\n     illustration, to be furnished in the next volume from the\r\n     architectural riches of Venice, of the principles, to the\r\n     development of which it is devoted. Beginning from the\r\n     beginning, Mr. Ruskin carries his reader through the whole\r\n     details of construction with an admirable clearness of\r\n     exposition, and by a process which leaves him at the close in a\r\n     position to apply the principles which he has learned by the\r\n     way, and to form an intelligent and independent judgment upon\r\n     any form of architectural structure. The argument of the book\r\n     hangs too closely together to be indicated by extracts, or by\r\n     an analysis within the limits to which we are confined.\"\r\n\r\nWe perceive that the work of which the first volume is here noticed, is\r\nto be followed immediately by _Examples of the Architecture of Venice_,\r\nselected and drawn to measurement from the edifices, by Mr. Ruskin: to\r\nbe completed in twelve parts, of folio imperial size, price one guinea\r\neach. These will not be reproduced in this country, and as the author\r\nprobably has little advantage from the American editions of his works,\r\nwe trust that for his benefit as well as for the interests of art, the\r\n_Examples_ will be largely imported.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new play written by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, as his contribution\r\ntowards the fund raising for the new Literary Institute, is in the hands\r\nof the literary and artistic amateurs by whom it is to be enacted, and\r\nrehearsals are in progress. The first performance will take place\r\nprobably in June.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a custom when the world was younger than it is now, for\r\ndisappointed lovers, and outlaws, and portionless youths too proud to\r\nlabor and afraid to steal, to go into the wars; nobility, that would not\r\nsuffer them to become journeymen mechanics, led them to hire out as\r\njourneymen butchers. But at length the field of military adventure is\r\nalmost every where closed. There is no region, ever so remote, where a\r\nspirited and adventurous youth could hope ever to learn the art martial.\r\nA few skirmishes on the Parana and the Plata, on the Fish River, or the\r\nKeiskamma, form all the fighting that is going on upon the globe; and\r\nthat fighting offers no premium to the adventurer. There is no native\r\nprince of great wealth and numerous followers, no mogul, or sultan, or\r\nsikh, with whom the turbulent European might make a good bargain for his\r\ncourage. The last field for such enterprise was the country of the\r\nMahrattas, where French and English mercenaries--with a sprinkling of\r\nAmericans--created a colony which enabled the ignorant, bigoted and\r\njealous savages to keep in check the best European armies. A Frenchman\r\nnamed Person was a pioneer in the business. He was succeeded by the\r\nSavoyard, De Boigne, whose statue now adorns the principal square of\r\nChamberry. James Skinner, whose _Memoirs_ have just been published in\r\nLondon by the novelist and traveler Mr. Bailie Fraser, began a similar\r\ncareer under De Boigne. Some idea may be formed of the Mahratta army,\r\nwhen the Peishwa at times brought 100,000 horse into the field. A\r\ntrusted officer, as Skinner afterwards became, might thus command a\r\ndivision of twenty, thirty, or forty thousand men, equal in fact to the\r\nlargest European armies in the last century. When men played with such\r\ntools as these, it may be easily imagined how they themselves rose and\r\nfell; how empires crumbled, or were reared anew. When Wellesley and Loke\r\noverthrew the Mahrattas, Skinner entered the British service, and it\r\nappears from the book before us that he died in 1836 a knight of the\r\nBath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto,\" says M. de Sainte Beuve, \"the real learning of women has\r\nbeen found to be pretty much the property of their lovers;\" and he\r\nridicules the notion that even Mrs. Somerville has any scholarship that\r\nwould win the least distinction for a man. It may be so. We see,\r\nhowever, that a Miss FANNY CORBAUX has lately communicated to the\r\nSyro-Egyptian Society in London a very long and ambitious paper _On the\r\nRaphaïm and their connexion with Egyptian History_, in which she quotes\r\nHebrew, Arabic, Greek, &c., with astonishing liberality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarlyle's translation of the _Apprenticeship and Travels of Wilhelm\r\nMeister_, has been issued in a very handsome edition, by Ticknor, Reed &\r\nFields, of Boston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Macaulay has been passing the Winter and Spring in Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Late Mr. John Glanville Taylor, an Englishman, left in MS. a work\r\nupon _The United States and Cuba_, which has just been published by\r\nBentley, and is announced for republication by Mr. Hart of Philadelphia.\r\nMr. Taylor was born in 1810, and when about twenty-one years of age he\r\nleft Liverpool for the United States, on a mining speculation. After\r\ntravelling a few months in this country, he was induced to go to Cuba to\r\nexamine a gold vein of which he thought something might be made. The\r\nplace in Cuba which was to be the scene of his operations, was the\r\nneighborhood of Gibara, on the north-eastern side of the island, which\r\nhe reached by sailing from New-York to St. Jago de Cuba, and travelling\r\nacross the island forty-five leagues. The gold vein turned out a\r\nwretched failure; and, after having been put to some disagreeable shifts\r\nto maintain himself, Mr. Taylor resolved to settle as a planter in\r\nHolguin--the district to which Gibara forms the port of entry. Returning\r\nto the United States, he made the necessary arrangements; and in the\r\nsummer of 1843, was established on his _hacienda_, in partnership with\r\nan American who had been long resident in that part of the island. In\r\nthis and the following year, however, the east of Cuba was visited by an\r\nunprecedented drought; causing famine which, though it destroyed many\r\nlives and ruined thousands of proprietors, attracted no more attention,\r\nhe says, in England, than was implied by \"a paragraph of three lines in\r\nan English newspaper.\" The west of Cuba was at the same time devastated\r\nby a tremendous hurricane, accompanied by floods; and, all his Cuban\r\nprospects being thus blasted, the author was glad to return to New-York\r\nin September, 1845, whence, after a short stay, he returned to England.\r\nHe did not long, however, remain in his native country, but left it for\r\nCeylon, where he died suddenly in January, of the present year. His\r\n_United States and Cuba: Eight Years of Change and Travel_, was left in\r\nMS., and within a few weeks has been printed. It is a work of much less\r\nvalue than Mr. Kimball's _Cuba and the Cubans_, published in New-York\r\nlast year. Of that very careful and judicious performance Mr. Taylor\r\nappears to have made considerable use in the preparation of his own, and\r\nhis agreement with Mr. Kimball may be inferred from the fact that,\r\nthough pointedly protesting that he does not advocate the annexation of\r\nCuba to the United States, he holds that \"worse things might\r\nhappen,\"--and indeed hints that sooner or later the event is inevitable.\r\nOf _Cuba and the Cubans_, we take this opportunity to state that a new\r\nand very much improved edition will soon be issued by Mr. Putnam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Emmeline Stuart Wortley has in the press of Bentley her _Travels in\r\nthe United States_.

An affluence of\r\n     fancy which never fails, a choice of language which chastens\r\n     splendor of expression by the use of simple idioms, a love for\r\n     the forms of art whether old or new, and a passionate enjoyment\r\n     of external nature such as belongs to the more poetic order of\r\n     minds--are the chief characteristics of this writer.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Literary Gazette_--\r\n\r\n     \"The genial and kindly spirit of this book, the humor and\r\n     vivacity of personal descriptions, redeemed by an exquisite\r\n     choice of expression from the least taint of the common or the\r\n     coarse; the occasional melody and music of the diction,\r\n     cadenced, as it were, by the very grace and tenderness of the\r\n     thought it clothes, or the images of beauty it evokes; the\r\n     broad, easy touches, revealing as at a glance the majestic and\r\n     tranquil features of the Eastern landscape, and the ultimate\r\n     feeling of all its accessories of form and hue; the varied\r\n     resources of learning, tradition, poetry, romance, with which\r\n     it is not encumbered but enriched, as a banquet table with\r\n     festal crowns and sparkling wines--all these, and many other\r\n     characteristics, to which our space forbids us to do justice,\r\n     render these 'Nile Notes' quite distinct from all former books\r\n     of Eastern travel, and worthy 'to occupy the intellect of the\r\n     thoughtful and the imagination of the lively.' Never did a\r\n     wanderer resign his whole being with more entire devotion to\r\n     the silence and the mystery that brood, like the shadow of the\r\n     ages, over that dead, dumb land.

In the first place, it is written in\r\n     a most execrable style,--all affectation, and verbal wriggling\r\n     and twisting for the sake of originality. The veriest sophomore\r\n     ought to be \"rusticated\" for such conceited phrases as\r\n     \"beautiful budburstiness of bosom,\"--\"her twin eyes shone forth\r\n     liquidly lustrous\"--and innumerable expressions in the same\r\n     namby-pamby dialect. But dellacruscan folly is but a trifle\r\n     compared with the immoral tendency of the descriptions of the\r\n     _gahzeeyah_, or dancing girls of Egypt, and the luscious\r\n     comments on their polluted ways and manners. We thought the\r\n     Harpers had done publishing this indecent trash.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. M. Moir, the \"Delta\" of _Blackwood's Magazine_, has just published in\r\nEdinburgh, _Sketches of the Poetical Literature of the Past Half\r\nCentury_, in six Lectures, delivered at the Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Satan Montgomery, otherwise called _Robert_ Montgomery, is not\r\ndead, as some have supposed, but is still making sermons and\r\nverses--probably sermons and verses of equally bad quality; and we see\r\nwith some alarm that the Rivingtons advertise, as in preparation, a\r\ncomplete edition of his _Poetical Works_ [we never saw any works by him\r\nthat were poetical] in one octavo volume, similar in size and appearance\r\nto the octavo editions of Southey, Wordsworth, &c., &c., and including\r\nthe whole of the author's poems--_Satan_, _Woman_, _Hell_, and all the\r\nrest,--in a revised form, with some original minor pieces, and a general\r\npreface. We don't suppose he will take our counsel, yet we will venture\r\nit, that he make use of Macaulay's reviewal of his poems, instead of any\r\n\"general preface\" of his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDocumentary History of New-York.--The forthcoming (third) volume of this\r\nState contribution to our historical literature will well sustain the\r\nreputation of its predecessors and of its zealous editor. Dr.\r\nO'CALLAGHAN is an enthusiast in his zeal for lighting up \"the dark ages\r\nof our history,\" as Verplanck called the Dutch period; and he has done\r\nas much as any man living to rescue the fast perishing memorials of the\r\nfounders of the Empire State. It is fortunate for the State that his\r\nindustry and patient research are secured for the proper arrangement of\r\nthe Archives--too long neglected and subject to loss and mutilation. The\r\nnew volume has come to hand too late for any elaborate notice or review\r\nof its contents; but a glance at the list of papers and illustrations\r\nalone warrants the opinion we have expressed. We notice particularly the\r\naccount of Champlain's explorations in Northern New-York, &c., from 1609\r\nto 1615--translated from the edition of 1632. The historical student\r\ncannot fail to note the coincidence of discovery and exploration by the\r\nDutch and French; and the credit due to the \"Founder of New France;\" to\r\nwhich we have alluded in the article on the Jesuit Relations. The\r\ntranslations of the extracts from Wassenaar (1624, etc.), give an\r\ninteresting cotemporaneous view of the progress of the European\r\ndiscoveries and settlements in America. A chapter on Medals and Coins\r\ncontains attractive matter, particularly that portion which relates to\r\nthe \"Rosa Americana coins,\" connected as they are with the \"Wood's\r\nhalf-pence,\" immortalized by Dean Swift. The notes and biographical\r\nsketches by the editor, scattered through the volume, add materially to\r\nits value--as also the numerous maps and engravings. We have heard hints\r\nthat some small suggestions of disinterested economists of the public\r\nmoney, or other considerations less creditable, have been brought to\r\nbear against the continuation of this publication--but we trust that\r\nthey will end when they begin. New-York owes it to her own great history\r\nto make its material accessible to all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColonel Albert J. Pickett, of Montgomery, has in the press of Walker and\r\nJames, of Charleston, _The History of Alabama, and incidentally of\r\nGeorgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period_. It will make two\r\nhandsome volumes, and from some passages of it which we have read, we\r\nbelieve it will be a work of very unusual attraction. It will embrace an\r\naccount of the invasion of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi,\r\nby De Soto, in 1539-41; of the Aborigines of these states, their\r\nappearance, manners and customs, games, amusements, wars, and religious\r\nceremonies, their ancient mounds and fortifications, and of the modern\r\nIndians, the Creeks, Chickasaws Choctaws, Alabamas, Uchees, Cherokees,\r\nand other tribes; the discovery and settlement of Alabama and\r\nMississippi by the French, and their occupation until 1763; the\r\noccupation of Alabama and Mississippi by the British for eighteen years;\r\nthe colonization of Georgia by the English; the occupation of Alabama\r\nand Mississippi by the Spaniards for thirty years; and the occupation of\r\nthese states by the Americans from 1800 until 1820. One whole chapter is\r\ntaken up with an interesting account of the arrest of Aaron Burr in\r\nAlabama in 1807; and the exciting controversies between Georgia, the\r\nFederal Government, Spain, and the Creek Indians, are treated at length.\r\nThe work will be illustrated by really valuable engravings, after\r\noriginal drawings made by a French traveller in 1564.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Farnham, author of _Prairie-Land_, (a very clever book published\r\nthree or four years ago by the Harpers), and widow of the late Mr.\r\nFarnham who wrote a book of travels in Oregon and other parts of the\r\nPacific country, is now living in a sort of paradise, about seventy\r\nmiles south of San Francisco. In a published letter she gives the\r\nfollowing description of her farm:\r\n\r\n     \"It is very heavily timbered and watered with clear living\r\n     streams running through valleys of the most fertile soil, on\r\n     which delicious vegetables grow ten months of the year. The\r\n     region is especially famed for potatoes, which become almost a\r\n     fruit here. The farm I live on is charmingly situated about a\r\n     mile from the old Mission, and two from the beach, on which a\r\n     tremendous surf breaks and thunders day and night. From my\r\n     house I look over the coast-table and range of mountains, the\r\n     hills of Monterey, the bay, and a near landscape, exquisitely\r\n     diversified by plain and wood, hill and valley, and almost\r\n     every shade that herbage and foliage, in a country without\r\n     frost, can show. The rainy season is about a month old, and the\r\n     earth as green as it is at home in June. Another month will\r\n     pile it with clover, and less than another variegate it with an\r\n     inconceivable variety of the most exquisite flowers--for this\r\n     is the land of flowers as well as of gold. Our prairies are\r\n     quite insignificant in their floral shows, compared to it. The\r\n     country and climate are faultless--except in the lack of\r\n     showers through the dry months. Nearly every thing one can\r\n     desire may be grown upon one's own farm here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Gayarre, a gentleman distinguished in the affairs of\r\nLouisiana, in which state he has held some important offices, has just\r\npublished in a handsome octavo, _Louisiana, its Colonial History and\r\nRomance_, (Harper & Brothers.) It appears from the preface, that Mr.\r\nGayarre has had excellent opportunities for the collection of materiel\r\nfor a really good book of the sort indicated by his title; but this\r\nperformance is utterly worthless, or worse than worthless, being neither\r\nhistory nor fiction, but such a commingling of the two that no one can\r\ntell which is one or which the other. The uncertainty with which it is\r\nread will be disagreeable in proportion to the interest that it excites;\r\nand, knowing something of the colonial history of Louisiana, we are\r\ninclined to think that a book quite as entertaining as this might have\r\nbeen composed of authenticated facts. Indeed the _Historical Collections\r\nof Louisiana_, by Mr. French, (published by Daniels and Smith,\r\nPhiladelphia,) must be to even the most superficial reader a far more\r\nattractive volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution_, by BENSON J. LOSSING,\r\n(Harper & Brothers,) is a work that cannot well be praised overmuch.\r\nThere have been an immense number of illustrated and pictorial histories\r\nof this country, all or nearly all of which are worthless patchwork; but\r\nMr. Lossing's is a production of equal attractive interest and value.\r\nThe first volume only has been completed; one more will follow with all\r\nconvenient haste, ending the work. The letter-press is written from\r\noriginal materials, the drawings of scenery are made from original\r\nsurveys, the engravings are executed, all by Mr. Lossing himself; and in\r\nevery department he evinces judgment and integrity. The Field Book will\r\nnot serve the purposes of a general history, but to the best informed\r\nand most sagacious it will be a useful companion in historical reading,\r\nwhile to those who seek only amusement in books, it may be commended,\r\nfor its pleasant style and careful art, as one of the most entertaining\r\nworks of the time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are glad to perceive that Mr. J. H. INGRAHAM, author of _The\r\nSouthwest, by a Yankee; Burton, or the Sieges_; and a large number of\r\nthe vilest yellow-covered novels ever printed in this country, has been\r\nadmitted to the deaconate in the Episcopal church at Natchez, and\r\nintends shortly to remove to Aberdeen, in the same state, to found a\r\nsociety in that city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Judson (\"Fanny Forrester\") left Calcutta in January for the United\r\nStates, by way of England, and she is now daily expected home, by her\r\nold and warmly attached friends here. We see suggested a volume of her\r\npoems--some of which have much tenderness and beauty; and hope that\r\nmeasures will be taken to insure such a publication, for her exclusive\r\nbenefit, immediately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur contemporary, the Philadelphia _Lady's Book_, is a little out of\r\nseason in its fashions. The April number of that excellent periodical\r\ncontains the Parisian Fashions which appeared in _The International_ for\r\nFebruary; and for this present month of May, we see in _The Lady's Book_\r\nthe altogether too warm and heavily made dresses given in _The\r\nInternational_ for last January--mid-winter. Certainly Philadelphia\r\nought not to be so far behind New-York in these matters. In its literary\r\ncharacter the _Lady's Book_ is still sustained by the contributions of\r\nits favorite critic Mr. Henry T. Tuckerman, with those of Mr. T. S.\r\nArthur, Miss Adaliza Cutter, and Mrs. Sarah J. Hale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe regret that the terms in which we lately announced Mr. J. R. TYSON'S\r\nforthcoming _History of the American Colonies_ were capable of any\r\nmisapprehension. We know Mr. Tyson quite too well to entertain a doubt\r\nof his perfect integrity as a historian; but it has been a subject of\r\nfrequent observation in the middle and southern states that the\r\nNew-England writers, who have furnished most of our histories, have\r\nexaggerated the influence of the Puritans and depreciated that of the\r\nQuakers and Cavaliers: Mr. Tyson himself, we believe, has been of this\r\nopinion; and we merely look for an able, fair, and liberal history, from\r\nhis point of view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. VALENTINE is preparing a new volume of his _Manual of the Common\r\nCouncil of New-York_. The volumes hitherto published have been edited\r\nwith great care and judgment; they embody an extraordinary amount and\r\nvariety of interesting and important facts connected with the\r\nadvancement and condition of the city; and the series is indispensable\r\nto any one who would write a history of New-York, or the lives of its\r\nleading citizens. The last volume was unusually rich in maps and\r\nstatistics, and we understand that the next one will be even more\r\ninteresting and valuable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIS has just published (through Charles Scribner) a new volume\r\nunder the characteristic title of _Hurry-graphs, or Sketches of Scenery,\r\nCelebrities and Society_, taken from life. It embraces the author's\r\nletters to the Home Journal, from Plymouth, Montrose, the Delaware, the\r\nHudson, the Highlands, and other summer resorts, with personal\r\ndescriptions of Webster, Everett, Emerson, Cooper, Jenny Lind, and many\r\nother notabilities. It will be a delightful companion for the watering\r\nplaces this season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most beautiful books from the American press is _Episodes of\r\nInsect Life_, by ACHETA DOMESTICA, just reprinted by J. S. Redfield. The\r\nnatural history and habits of insects of every class are delineated by a\r\nclose observer with remarkable minuteness, and in a style of unusual\r\nfelicity; and the peculiar illustrations of the book are more spirited\r\nand highly finished than we have noticed in any publication of a similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Harpers have published a new edition of the _Greek Grammar_ of\r\nPhilip Buttman, revised and enlarged by his son, Alexander Buttman, and\r\ntranslated from the eighteenth German edition by Dr. EDWARD ROBINSON. It\r\nis not to be doubted, we suppose, that this grammar, in the shape in\r\nwhich it is now presented, is altogether the best that exists of the\r\nGreek language. We are not ourselves competent to a judgment in the\r\ncase, but from all we have seen upon the subject by the best scholars,\r\nwe take this to be the general opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN P. KENNEDY has in the press of Putnam a new and carefully revised\r\nedition of his _Swallow Barn, or a Sojourn in the Old Dominion_, one of\r\nthe most pleasant books illustrative of local manners and rural life\r\nthat has ever been written. It is more like Irving's Bracebridge Hall\r\nthan any other work we can think of, and is as felicitous a picture of\r\nold Virginia as Jeffrey Crayon has given us of Merrie England. The first\r\nedition of Swallow Barn was published twenty years ago; the new one is\r\nto be beautifully illustrated in the style of Irving's _Sketch Book_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. FRANCIS LIEBER, the learned Professor of the South Carolina College,\r\nhas been elected a member of the National Institute of France. Dr.\r\nLieber is a German, but he has resided in this country many years. Among\r\nAmericans who have been thus complimented are Mr. Prescott and Mr.\r\nBancroft. The late Henry Wheaton was also a member of the Institute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe entertaining book, _Ship and Shore_, by the late Rev. WALTER COLTON,\r\nhas just been published by A. S. Barnes & Co., who will as soon as\r\npracticable complete the republication of all Mr. Colton's works, under\r\nthe editorship of the Rev. Henry T. Cheever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Domestic Bible_, by the Rev. Ingram Cobbin, just published in a\r\nvery handsome quarto volume in this city by S. Hueston, we think\r\ndecidedly the best edition of the Scriptures for common use that has\r\never been printed in the English language. Its chief merit consists in\r\nthis, that without embracing a syllable of debatable matter in the form\r\nof notes, it contains every needful explanation and illustration of the\r\ntext that can be gathered from ancient art, literature and history,\r\nexpressed with great distinctness and compactness, together with such\r\nwell-executed wood engravings as unquestionable knowledge in this age\r\ncould suggest--omitting altogether the absurd fancy embellishments which\r\nin most of the illustrated Bibles are so offensive to the taste, and so\r\nworthless as guides to the understanding. The editor we believe is a\r\nclergyman of the Episcopal Church in England, but he has had the good\r\nsense to avoid, so far as we can see, everything that would vex the\r\nsectarian feelings of any one who admits that the Bible itself is true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Life, Speeches, Orations, and Diplomatic Papers of Lewis Cass_, are\r\nin press at Baltimore, under the editorship of Mr. George H. Hickman.\r\n_The Speeches, Forensic Arguments, and Diplomatic Papers_ of Daniel\r\nWebster (to be comprised in six large octavo volumes), are in the press\r\nof Little & Brown of Boston, under the care of Mr. Edward Everett. _The\r\nMemoirs and Works of the late John C. Calhoun_ are soon to be published\r\nin Charleston, by Mr. R. K. Craller, and we hear of collections of the\r\nSpeeches and Public Papers of Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Benton. All these are\r\nimportant works in literature, affairs or history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor GILLESPIE, of Union College, has just published (Harper &\r\nBrothers) a translation of The Philosophy of Mathematics, from the\r\n_Cours de Philosophie Positive_ of AUGUSTE COMTE. The intellect of\r\nEurope in this century has evolved no greater work than the Philosophie\r\nPositive, and Professor Gillespie has done a wise thing in rendering\r\ninto English that part of it which relates to the field of mathematical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor LINCOLN'S edition of Horace (recently published by the\r\nAppletons) is the subject of much commendatory observation from critical\r\nscholars. For purposes of instruction it is likely to have precedence of\r\nany other that has been printed in this country. Those having marginal\r\ntranslations may be very convenient for indolent boys, but they are not\r\naltogether the most serviceable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work of very great ability has appeared in Paris, under the title of\r\n_De la Certitude_, (Upon Certainty), by A. JAVARY. It makes an octavo of\r\nmore than five hundred pages, and for originality of ideas and\r\nillustrations, and cumulative force of logic, is almost unrivalled. The\r\nsceptical speculation of the time is reduced by it to powder, and thrown\r\nto the winds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. MCCONNELL, who gave us last year a brilliant volume under the title\r\nof \"Talbot and Vernon,\" has just published, _The Glenns, a Family\r\nHistory_, by which his good reputation will be much increased. It\r\ndisplays much skill in the handling, and is altogether an advance from\r\nhis previous performance. (C.

The American Art-Union will offer\r\nits subscribers Mr. Woodville's _Mexican News_, engraved by Alfred\r\nJones; the Philadelphia Art-Union, Huntington's _Christiana and Her\r\nChildren_, by Andrews; and for the same purpose, Mr. Perkins, of Boston,\r\nhas allowed the New-England Art-Union to make use of his magnificent\r\npicture of _Saul and the Witch of Endor_, painted by Alston, and\r\ngenerally considered one of the finest historical productions of that\r\neminent artist. Each of the Unions, we believe, will also publish some\r\nless important works for distribution or prizes.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-sixth exhibition of the _National Academy of Design_, has\r\ncommenced under favorable auspices. Upon the whole, the collection of\r\npictures is the best ever made by the society. We have not space for any\r\nparticular criticism, but must refer to Mr. Durand's admirable\r\nlandscapes; the Greek Girl and full length portrait of General Scott by\r\nMr. Kellogg; Mount Desert Island by Mr. Church; The Defence of\r\nToleration by Mr. Rothermel; The Edge of the Wood by Mr. Huntington; Mr.\r\nGignoux's Winter Sunset, and other pictures in the same department by\r\nRichards, Cropsey, and Kensett; and portraits by Elliott, Osgood, Hicks\r\nand Flagg,--are the works which strike us as deserving most praise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletin of the American Art-Union_ for April, describes the\r\nopposition to the institution of which it is the organ, as directed by\r\n\"envy, malice, and uncharitableness,\" and intimates that it is\r\noccasioned by the inability or unwillingness of the committee to\r\npurchase the trashy productions of incompetent painters constantly\r\noffered to them. We submit to the gentlemen connected with the\r\nArt-Union, that they should not suffer the hirelings they may sometimes\r\nemploy upon the Bulletin, thus to refer to such artists and such men as\r\nDurand, Wier, Kellogg, Elliott, and many others, who have ventured to\r\nthink that their Association does not present altogether the best means\r\nto be devised for the promotion of the fine arts. Taste may be displayed\r\nin writing, as well as in buying pictures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was recently sold at auction at Paris, for 2,700 francs, a picture\r\nby GIRODET, which in its time caused not a little amusement to the\r\nParisians. It was originally a portrait of an actress of the Theatre\r\nFrançais, who married a rich banker. Girodet tried to get the pay for\r\nhis picture, but the lady and her husband obstinately refused. Hereupon\r\nhe transformed her into a Danae, receiving the shower of gold, adding\r\nother figures, such as a turkey cock representing the eagle of Jove,\r\nwhich rendered the whole work as laughable as it was uncomplimentary to\r\nits subject. It was exhibited in one of the expositions in the time of\r\nthe empire, and no picture was ever more successful with the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKOTZBUE, a historical painter, now residing at Munich, has nearly\r\ncompleted a large picture representing the battle of Züllichau, in 1759,\r\nwhere the Germans under General Wedel were defeated by the Russians\r\nunder Soltikoff. The work is highly praised, and its author even\r\ncompared with Horace Vernet for vividness of narrative, truth in detail,\r\nand force and harmony of color.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. ELLIOTT, probably the best portrait painter now living, will soon\r\nvisit Marshfield, where Mr. Webster has promised to sit to him, for a\r\nfriend of his in this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo statues by the lamented SCHWANTHALER have just been set up in the\r\nroyal library at Munich. The first represents Albert V., Duke of\r\nBavaria, the founder of the library, and a great patron of science. Of\r\ncourse, he is presented in middle-age costume; his head is bare, his\r\nface reflective, and his right hand supports his chin,--an image of\r\nrepose, after a work is accomplished. The other statue is of King Louis\r\n(of Lola Montes memory), in royal robes, the left hand resting on his\r\nsword, and his right holding the plan of the edifice containing the\r\nlibrary, which was built by him. His whole expression is the opposite to\r\nthat of the Duke, not repose, but restless activity in search of new\r\nobjects. A critic says that these statues do not stand well on their\r\nfeet, and that the knees are bent as if one leg was lame, a fault, he\r\nsays, not peculiar to Schwanthaler.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe last month spoke of the New Museum at Berlin, one of the finest\r\nedifices of modern times. It may be interesting to our readers to know\r\nthat the total expense of the building and interior decoration was in\r\nround numbers $1,100,000. Of this sum the execution of the ornamental\r\nwork and works of art in the interior, including the frescoes of\r\nKaulbach and others, with the arrangement of objects of art and\r\nfurniture necessary for their display, cost upwards of $220,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition of the Munich Art-Union took place in the beginning of\r\nMarch. Among the pictures, attention was particularly drawn to a series\r\nof sketches from Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor, by Löfller. Baade\r\nexhibited a Norwegian picture, representing an effect of moonlight:\r\nPeter Hess two small humorous pieces from military life, which were\r\ngreatly admired, as was especially a series of aquarelles representing\r\nscenes in Switzerland and Italy, by Suter, a Swiss artist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKAULBACH only works at Berlin on his frescoes in the New Museum during\r\nthe pleasant season. The second picture, the Destruction of Jerusalem,\r\nwas nearly finished last fall when the cold came on. He left it, and it\r\nis now covered and concealed by brown paper till he shall again set to\r\nwork on it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. LAMARTINE recently presented in the French Assembly a petition from\r\nWilliam Tell Poussin, formerly minister of the Republic in the United\r\nStates, praying the French Government to grant a block of granite, taken\r\nfrom the quarries of Cherbourg, for the national monument to Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWIDNMANN, the sculptor, of Munich, has recently completed in plaster a\r\ngroup of the size of life, of a man defending his wife and child against\r\nthe attack of a tiger. The figures are nude, and the only figure yet\r\nfinished, that of the man, is spoken of as a model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAS THERE BEEN A GREAT POET IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Eclectic Review_ for the last month, in an article upon the\r\nwritings of Joanna Baillie, answers this question in the manner\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     \"We may enumerate the following names as those of real poets,\r\n     dead or alive, included in the first half of the nineteenth\r\n     century in Britain:--Bloomfield, Wordsworth, Coleridge,\r\n     Southey, Campbell, Moore, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Professor\r\n     Wilson, Hogg, Croly, Maturin, Hunt, Scott, James Montgomery,\r\n     Pollok, Tennyson, Aird, Mrs. Browning, Mrs. Hemans, Joanna\r\n     Baillie, and the author of 'Festus.' We leave this list to be\r\n     curtailed, or to be increased, at the pleasure of the reader.\r\n     But, we ask, which of those twenty-three has produced a work\r\n     uniquely and incontestably, or even, save in one or two\r\n     instances, professedly GREAT? Most of those enumerated have\r\n     displayed great powers; some of them have proved themselves fit\r\n     to begin greatest works; but none of them, whether he has\r\n     begun, or only thought of beginning, has been able to finish.\r\n     Bloomfield, the tame, emasculate Burns of England, has written\r\n     certain pleasing and genuine poems smelling of the soil, but\r\n     the 'Farmer's Boy' remained what the Scotch poet would have\r\n     called a 'haflin callant,' and never became a full-grown and\r\n     brawny man. Wordsworth was equal to the epic of the age, but\r\n     has only constructed the great porch leading up to the edifice,\r\n     and one or two beautiful cottages lying around. Coleridge could\r\n     have written a poem--whether didactic, or epic, or\r\n     dramatic--equal in fire and force to the 'Iliad,' or the\r\n     'Hamlet,' or the 'De Rerum Natura,' and superior to any of the\r\n     three in artistic finish and metaphysical truth and religious\r\n     feeling--a work ranking immediately beside the 'Paradise Lost;'\r\n     but he has, instead, shed on us a shower of plumes, as from the\r\n     wing of a fallen angel--beautiful, ethereal, scattered, and\r\n     tantalizing. Southey's poems are large without being\r\n     great--massive, without being majestic--they have rather the\r\n     bulk of an unformed chaos than the order and beauty of a\r\n     finished creation. Campbell, in many points the Virgil of his\r\n     time, has, alas! written no Georgies; his odes and lesser poems\r\n     are, 'atoms of the rainbow;' his larger, such as 'Gertrude of\r\n     Wyoming,' may be compared to those segments of the showery arch\r\n     we see in a disordered evening sky; but he has reared no\r\n     complete 'bow of God.' Moore's 'Lalla Rookh' is an elegant and\r\n     laborious composition--not a shapely building; it is put\r\n     together by skilful art, not formed by plastic power. Byron's\r\n     poems are, for the most part, disjointed but melodious groans,\r\n     like those of Ariel from the centre of the cloven pine; 'Childe\r\n     Harold' is his soliloquy when sober--'Don Juan' his soliloquy\r\n     when half-drunk; the 'Corsair' would have made a splendid\r\n     episode in an epic--but the epic, where is it? and 'Cain,' his\r\n     most creative work, though a distinct and new world, is a\r\n     bright and terrible abortion--a comet, instead of a sun. So,\r\n     too, are the leading works of poor Shelley, which resemble\r\n     Southey in size, Byron in power of language, and himself only\r\n     in spirit and imagination, in beauties and faults. Keats, like\r\n     Shelley, was arrested by death, as he was piling up enduring\r\n     and monumental works. Professor Wilson has written '_Noctes_'\r\n     innumerable; but where is his poem on a subject worthy of his\r\n     powers, or where is his _work_ on any subject whatever? Hogg\r\n     has bound together a number of beautiful ballads, by a string\r\n     of no great value, and called it the 'Queen's Wake.' Scott\r\n     himself has left no solid poem, but instead, loose, rambling,\r\n     spirited, metrical romances--the bastards of his genius--and a\r\n     great family of legitimate chubby children of novels, bearing\r\n     the image, but not reaching the full stature, of their parent's\r\n     mind. Croly's poems, like the wing of his own 'seraph kings,'\r\n     standing beside the sleeping Jacob, has a 'lifted, mighty\r\n     plume,' and his eloquence is always as classic as it is\r\n     sounding; but it is, probably, as much the public's fault as\r\n     his, that he has never equalled his first poem, 'Paris in\r\n     1815,' which now appears a basis without a building. Maturin\r\n     has left a powerful passage or two, which may be compared to a\r\n     feat performed by the victim of some strong disease, to imitate\r\n     which no healthy or sane person would, could, or durst attempt.\r\n     James Montgomery will live by his smaller poems--his larger are\r\n     long lyrics--and when was a long lyric any other than tedious?\r\n     Hunt has sung many a joyous carol, and many a pathetic ditty,\r\n     but produced no high or lasting poem. Pollok has aimed at a\r\n     higher object than almost any poet of his day; he has sought,\r\n     like Milton, to enshrine religion in poetic form, and to\r\n     attract to it poetic admirers: he did so in good faith, and he\r\n     expended great talents and a young life, in the execution; but,\r\n     unfortunately, he confounded Christianity with one of its\r\n     narrowest shapes, and hence the book, though eloquent in\r\n     passages, and dear to a large party, is rather a long and\r\n     powerful, though unequal and gloomy sermon, than a poem; he has\r\n     shed the sunshine of his genius upon his own peculiar notions,\r\n     far more strongly than on general truths; and the spirit of the\r\n     whole performance may be expressed in the words of Burns,\r\n     slightly altered,--'Thunder-tidings of damnation.' _His_ and\r\n     _our_ friend, Thomas Aird, has a much subtler, more original\r\n     and genial mind than Pollok's, and had he enjoyed a tithe of\r\n     the same recognition, he might have produced a Christian epic\r\n     on a far grander scale; as it is, his poems are fragmentary and\r\n     episodical, although Dante's 'Inferno' contains no pictures\r\n     more tremendously distinct, yet ideal, than his 'Devil's Dream\r\n     upon Mount Acksbeck. Tennyson is a greater Calvinist in one\r\n     sense than either of the Scotch poets we have named--he owes\r\n     more to the general faith of others in his genius than to any\r\n     special or strong works of his own; but let us be dumb, he is\r\n     now Laureate--the crowned grasshopper of a summer day! Bailey\r\n     of 'Festus' has a vast deal more power than Tennyson, who is\r\n     only his delicate, consumptive brother; but 'Festus' seems\r\n     either different from, or greater than, a _work_. We are\r\n     reminded of one stage in the history of the nebular hypothesis,\r\n     when Sir W. Herschel, seeing a central mass in the midst of a\r\n     round burr of light, was almost driven to the conclusion that\r\n     it was _something immensely greater than what we call a\r\n     star_--a kind of monster sun. So with the prodigious birth men\r\n     call 'Festus.' Our gifted young friend Yendys is more likely\r\n     than any, if he live and avoid certain tendencies to diffusion\r\n     and over-subtlety, to write a solid and undying POEM.\r\n\r\n     \"It were easy to extend the induction to our lady authors, and\r\n     to show that Mrs. Hemans, Mrs. Browning, and Joanna Baillie,\r\n     Mrs. Shelley, &c., have abounded rather in effusions or\r\n     efforts, or tentative experiments, than in calm, complete, and\r\n     perennial works.\"\r\n\r\nThe critic appears never to have heard of our Bryant, Dana, Halleck,\r\nPoe, Longfellow, or Maria Brooks, any one of whom is certainly superior\r\nto some of the poets mentioned in the above paragraph; and his doctrine\r\nthat a great poem must necessarily be a long one--that poetry, like\r\nbutter and cheese, is to be sold by the pound--does not altogether\r\ncommend itself to our most favorable judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REAL ADVENTURES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF GEORGE BORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, we believe, _Lavengro_, though it has sold well everywhere,\r\nhas not been very much praised. It has been conceded that the author of\r\n\"the Bible in Spain\" must be a Crichton, but his last performance looked\r\novermuch like trifling with the credulity of his readers. We find in\r\nColburn's _New Monthly Magazine_ for April a sort of vindication of\r\nBorrow, which embraces some curious particulars of his career, and quote\r\nthe following passages, which cannot fail to interest his American\r\nreaders:\r\n\r\n     \"We have yet to learn where our author was during the years\r\n     intervening from the epoch of the dingle to the date of Spanish\r\n     travel; that he was neither in mind nor body inactive, ample\r\n     testimony may be adduced, not only in the form of writings made\r\n     public during that interval, but in the internal evidence\r\n     afforded by them of laborious research. In a work published at\r\n     St. Petersburgh in 1835, known but to few, entitled \"Targum;\r\n     or, Metrical Translations from Thirty Languages and Dialects,\r\n     by George Borrow,\" we find indications of how those intervening\r\n     years were spent. He says, in the preface to this work, \"The\r\n     following pieces, selections from a huge and undigested mass of\r\n     translation, accumulated during several years devoted to\r\n     philological pursuits, are with much diffidence offered to the\r\n     public,\" &c. These translations are remarkable for force and\r\n     correct emphasis, and afford demonstration of what power the\r\n     author possesses over metre. We shall cite but few examples,\r\n     however, for it is believed that not only that huge mass, but\r\n     many an additional song and ballad now is digested, and lies\r\n     side by side with the glorious \"Kæmpe Viser,\" the \"Ab Gwilym,\"\r\n     and other learned translations, by means of which it may be\r\n     hoped that the gifted Borrow will ere long vindicate his\r\n     lasting claim to scholarship--a claim to which it is to be\r\n     feared he is indifferent, for he is no boaster, and does\r\n     himself no justice; or, if he boasts at all, prefers, as with a\r\n     species of self-sarcasm, the mention of his lesser, on which he\r\n     dwells with zest, to that of his greater and more enduring\r\n     triumphs. The \"Targum\" consists of translations from the\r\n     following languages: Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Tartar,\r\n     Tibetian, Chinese, Mandchou, Russian, Malo-Russian, Polish,\r\n     Finnish, Anglo-Saxon, Ancient Norse, Suabian, German, Dutch,\r\n     Danish, Ancient Danish, Swedish, Ancient Irish, Irish, Gaellic,\r\n     Ancient British, Cambrian British, Greek, Modern Greek, Latin,\r\n     Provençal, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Rommany. A\r\n     few specimens from this work may be acceptable to the English\r\n     reader--a work so rare, that the authorities of a German\r\n     university not long ago sent a person to St. Petersburgh to\r\n     endeavor to discover a copy:\"\r\n\r\n\r\nODE TO GOD.\r\n\r\nFROM THE HEBREW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reign'd the Universe's master ere were earthly things begun;\r\n    When his mandate all created, Ruler was the name he won;\r\n    And alone He'll rule tremendous when all things are past and gone;\r\n    He no equal has, nor consort, He the singular and lone\r\n    Has no end and no beginning, His the sceptre, might, and throne;\r\n    He's my God and living Saviour, rock to which in need I run;\r\n    He's my banner and my refuge, fount of weal when call'd upon;\r\n    In his hand I place my spirit, at nightfall and rise of sun,\r\n    And therewith my body also;--God's my God,--I fear no one.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAYER.\r\n\r\nFROM THE ARABIC.\r\n\r\n    O Thou who dost know what the heart fain would hide;\r\n    Who ever art ready whate'er may betide;\r\n    In whom the distressed can hope in their woe,\r\n    Whose ears with the groans of the wretched are plied--\r\n    Still bid Thy good gifts from Thy treasury flow;\r\n    All good is assembled where Thou dost abide;\r\n    To Thee, save my poverty, nought can I show,\r\n    And of Thee all my poverty's wants are supplied;\r\n    What choice have I save to Thy portal to go?\r\n    If 'tis shut, to what other my steps can I guide?\r\n    'Fore whom as a suppliant low shall I bow,\r\n    If Thy bounty to me, Thy poor slave, is denied?\r\n    But, oh! though rebellious full often I grow,\r\n    Thy bounty and kindness are not the less wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nO LORD! I NOTHING CRAVE BUT THEE.\r\n\r\nFROM THE TARTAR.\r\n\r\n    O Thou from whom all love doth flow,\r\n    Whom all the world doth reverence so,\r\n    Thou constitut'st each care I know;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    O keep me from each sinful way;\r\n    Thou breathedst life within my clay;\r\n    I'll therefore serve Thee night and day;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    I ope my eyes, and see Thy face,\r\n    On Thee my musings all I place,\r\n    I've left my parents, friends, and race;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    Take Thou my soul, my every thing;\r\n    My blood from out its vessels wring;\r\n    Thy slave am I, and Thou my King;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    I speak--my tongue on Thee doth roam;\r\n    I list--the winds Thy title boom;\r\n    For in my soul has God his home;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    The world the shallow worldling craves,\r\n    And greatness need ambitious knaves;\r\n    The lover of his maiden raves;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    The student needs his bookish lore,\r\n    The bigot shrines to pray before,\r\n    His pulpit needs the orator;\r\n        Oh Lord! I nothing crave but thee.\r\n\r\n    Though all the learning 'neath the skies,\r\n    And th' houries all of paradise,\r\n    The Lord should place before my eyes,\r\n        O Lord! I'd nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    When I through paradise shall stray,\r\n    Its houries and delights survey,\r\n    Full little gust awake will they;\r\n        O Lord! I'll nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n    For Hadgee Ahmed is my name,\r\n    My heart with love of God doth flame;\r\n    Here and above I'll bide the same;\r\n        O Lord! I nothing crave but Thee.\r\n\r\n     Nor was this the only literary labor performed by Mr. Borrow\r\n     while at St. Petersburgh: to the \"Targum\" he appended a\r\n     translation of \"The Talisman,\" and other pieces from the\r\n     Russian of Alexander Pushkin. He also edited the Gospel in the\r\n     Mandchou Tartar dialect while residing in that city. In\r\n     connection with the latter undertaking there is an anecdote\r\n     told of which, like the story of his making horse-shoes, shows\r\n     his resources, and redounds to his credit. It runs thus:--\"It\r\n     was known that a fountain of types in the Mandchou Tartar\r\n     character existed at a certain house in the city of St.\r\n     Petersburgh, but there was no one to be found who could set\r\n     them up. In this emergency the young editor demanded to\r\n     inspect the types; they were brought forth in a rusty state\r\n     from a cellar; on which, resolved to see his editorial labors\r\n     complete, he cleaned the types himself, and set them up with\r\n     his own hand.\"\r\n\r\nOf his journeyings in Spain Mr. Borrow has been his own biographer; but\r\nhere again his higher claims to distinction are lightly touched on, or\r\nnot named. In 1837 a book was printed at Madrid, having the following\r\ncurious title-page:\r\n\r\n     \"_Embèo e Mafaró Lucas. Brotoboro randado andré la chipe\r\n     griega, acáana chibado andré o Romanó, ó chipe es Zincales de\r\n     Sese._\r\n\r\n     \"_El Evangelio segun S. Lucas, traducido al Romaní, ó dialecto\r\n     de los Gitanos de España. 1837._\"\r\n\r\n     And this work is no other than the remarkable antecedent of the\r\n     \"Zincali,\"--the translation of St. Luke's Gospel into the Gipsy\r\n     dialect of Spain.[A] Of the Bible in Spain it is unnecessary to\r\n     speak; there can be no better evidence of the estimation it is\r\n     held in than the fact of its having been translated into French\r\n     and German, while it has run through at least thirty thousand\r\n     copies at home. But it is on the \"Zincali\" that Borrow's\r\n     reputation will maintain its firm footing; the originality and\r\n     research involved in its production, the labors and dangers it\r\n     entailed, are duly appreciated at home and abroad. During the\r\n     past year a highly interesting account of the Gipsies and other\r\n     wandering people of Norway, written in Danish, was published at\r\n     Christiana; it is entitled \"Beretning om Fante--eller\r\n     Landstrygerfolket i Norge\" (Account of the Fant, or Wandering\r\n     People of Norway), by Eilert Sundt. At the twenty-third page of\r\n     this work, the Danish author, in allusion to the subject of\r\n     this notice, says: \"This Borrow is a remarkable man. As agent\r\n     for the British Bible Society he has undertaken journeys into\r\n     remote lands, and acquainted from his early youth, not only\r\n     with many European languages, but likewise with the Rommani of\r\n     the English Gipsies, he sought up with zest the Gipsies every\r\n     where, and became their faithful missionary. He has made\r\n     himself so thoroughly master of their ways and customs that he\r\n     soon passed for one of their blood. He slept in their tents in\r\n     the forests of Russia and Hungary, visited them in their robber\r\n     caves in the mountainous _pass_ regions of Italy, lived with\r\n     them five entire years (towards 1840) in Spain, where he, for\r\n     his endeavors to distribute the Gospel in that Catholic land,\r\n     was imprisoned with the very worst of them for a time in the\r\n     dungeons of Madrid. He at last went over to North Africa, and\r\n     sought after his Tartars even there. It is true, no one has\r\n     taken equal pains with Borrow to introduce himself among this\r\n     rude and barbarous people, but on that account he has been\r\n     enabled better than any other to depict the many mysteries of\r\n     this race; and the frequent impressions which his book has\r\n     undergone within a short period, show with what interest the\r\n     English public have received his graphic descriptions.\"\r\n\r\nOf the extraordinary acquisitions of Mr. Borrow in languages, a pleasant\r\nstory is told by Sir William Napier, who, looking into a courtyard, from\r\nthe window of a Spanish inn, heard a man converse successively in a\r\ndozen tongues, so fluently and so perfectly, that he was puzzled to\r\ndecide what was his country,--Germany, Holland, France, Italy, Russia,\r\nPortugal, or Spain; and coming down he joined his circle, asked the\r\nquestion of him, and was astonished by the information that he was an\r\nEnglish Bible agent. Between the historian of the Peninsular War and the\r\nmissionary an intimacy sprung up, which we believe has continued without\r\nany interruption to the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAUN OVER HIS GOBLET.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY R.

STODDARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    My goblet was exceeding beautiful;\r\n    It was the jewel of my cave; I had\r\n    A corner where I hid it in the moss,\r\n    Between the jagged crevices of rock,\r\n    Where no one but myself could find it out;\r\n    But when a nymph, or wood-god passed my door,\r\n    I filled it to the brim with bravest wine,\r\n    And offered them a draught, and told them Jove\r\n    Had nothing finer, richer at his feasts,\r\n    Though Ganymede and Hebe did their best:\r\n    \"His nectar is not richer than my wine,\"\r\n    Said I, \"and for the goblet, look at it!\"\r\n    But I have broken my divinest cup\r\n    And trod its fragments in the dust of Earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    My goblet was exceeding beautiful.\r\n    Sometimes my brothers of the woods, the fauns,\r\n    Held gay carousals with me in my cave;\r\n    I had a skin of Chian wine therein,\r\n    Of which I made a feast; and all who drank\r\n    From out my cup, a feast within itself,\r\n    Made songs about the bright immortal shapes\r\n    Engraven on the side below their lips:\r\n    But we shall never drain it any more,\r\n    And never sing about it any more;\r\n    For I have broken my divinest cup\r\n    And trod its fragments in the dust of Earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    My goblet was exceeding beautiful.\r\n    For Pan was 'graved upon it, rural Pan;\r\n    He stood in horror in a marshy place\r\n    Clasping a bending reed; he thought to clasp\r\n    Syrinx, but clasped a reed, and nothing more!\r\n    There was another picture of the god,\r\n    When he had learned to play upon the flute;\r\n    He sat at noon within a shady bower\r\n    Piping, with all his listening herd around;\r\n    (I thought at times I saw his fingers move,\r\n    And caught his music: did I dream or not?)\r\n    Hard by the Satyrs danced, and Dryads peeped\r\n    From out the mossy trunks of ancient trees;\r\n    And nice-eared Echo mocked him till he thought--\r\n    The simple god!--he heard another Pan\r\n    Playing, and wonder shone in his large eyes!\r\n    But I have broken my divinest cup,\r\n    And trod its fragments in the dust of Earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    My goblet was exceeding beautiful.\r\n    For Jove was there transformed into the Bull\r\n    Bearing forlorn Europa through the waves,\r\n    Leaving behind a track of ruffled foam;\r\n    Powerless with fear she held him by the horns,\r\n    Her golden tresses streaming on the winds;\r\n    In curvéd shells, young Cupids sported near,\r\n    While sea gods glanced from out their weedy caves,\r\n    And on the shore were maids with waving scarfs,\r\n    And hinds a-coming to the rescue--late!\r\n    But I have broken my divinest cup,\r\n    And trod its fragments in the dust of Earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    My goblet was exceeding beautiful.\r\n    For rosy Bacchus crowned its rich designs:\r\n    He sat within a vineyard full of grapes,\r\n    With Ariadne kneeling at his side;\r\n    His arm was thrown around her slender waist,\r\n    His head lay in her bosom, and she held\r\n    A cup, a little distance from his lips,\r\n    And teased him with it, for he wanted it.\r\n    A pair of spotted pards where sleeping near,\r\n    Couchant in shade, their heads upon their paws;\r\n    And revellers were dancing in the woods,\r\n    Snapping their jolly fingers evermore!\r\n    But all is vanished, lost, for ever lost,\r\n    For I have broken my divinest cup,\r\n    And trod its fragments in the dust of Earth!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The writer has before him another translation of St. Luke's Gospel\r\nin the Basque, edited by George Borrow while in Spain--(Evangeloia S.\r\nLucasen Guissan.--El Evangelio segun S. Lucas. Traducido al Vascuere.\r\nMadrid. 1838).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JESUIT RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nDR. O'CALLAGHAN'S MEMOIR--NEW DISCOVERIES IN ROME, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the stated meeting of the New-York Historical Society, in October,\r\n1847, Dr. E. B. O'CALLAGHAN, well known as the author of a valuable\r\nhistory of New-York under the Dutch,[B] and now engaged in\r\nsuperintending the publication of the Documentary History of the State,\r\nunder the act of March 13, 1849, communicated a paper, which was read at\r\nthe subsequent meeting in November, and published in the \"Proceedings,\"\r\non the \"_Jesuit Relations of Discoveries and other Occurrences in Canada\r\nand the Northern and Western States of the Union, 1632-1672_.\"[C] This\r\nmemoir embraces notices of the authors of the Relations, a catalogue\r\nraisonnée, and a table showing what volumes are in this country and\r\nCanada, and where they are to be found. A French translation of this\r\nwork, with notes, corrections and additions, has been published (in\r\n1850) at Montreal, by the Rev. Father MARTIN, Superior of the Jesuits in\r\nCanada. As the notes and additions contain valuable information,\r\nespecially upon the discovery of new matter for the illustration of the\r\ngeneral subject, we shall endeavor to present an intelligible compend of\r\ntheir substance.\r\n\r\nThe French editor carries back the history to 1611, when the first\r\nJesuit missionaries to North America, Father Pierre Biard and Enmond\r\nMasse, arrived in Acadia. They took part in the establishment of Port\r\nRoyal and that of St. Sauveur, in Pentagoet, now Mount Desert Island.\r\nThe former wrote a Relation of his voyage.\r\n\r\nDr. O'Callaghan had spoken of the _nomadic_ race which was to be\r\nsubjected to the influences of the gospel, under the auspices of the\r\nJesuit missionaries, as inhabiting the country extending from the island\r\nof Anticosti to the Mississippi. The translator qualifies this statement\r\nby a note, in which he says that this term _nomadic_ is applicable to\r\nthe nations of Algonquin origin, but not to the Hurons nor the Iroquois,\r\nwho had fixed abodes and regularly organized villages or towns. The Five\r\nNations were the Agniers (Mohawks), the Oneionts (Oneidas), the\r\nOnontagues (Onondagas), the Goiogoiens (Cayugas), and the Tsonnontouans\r\n(Senecas). The Tuscaroras, a tribe from the south, were admitted to the\r\nconfederation, making thus Six Nations, during the last century.\r\n\r\nCHAMPLAIN was the first European who reached the Atlantic shores of the\r\nstate of Maine from the St. Lawrence by way of the Kennebec. This\r\nillustrious discoverer was sent in 1629 to explore that route as far as\r\nthe coast of the Etechemins, \"in which he had been before in the time of\r\nthe Sieur du Mont.\"[D]\r\n\r\nThe French editor adds the following notices of two of the fathers who\r\nfilled the office of Superior in Canada, not mentioned by Dr.\r\nO'Callaghan.\r\n\r\nPIERRE BIARD, according to the history of Jouvency, was born at\r\nGrenoble, and entered the Society of Jesus while yet very young. He came\r\nto Port Royal in 1611, and took part in the establishment of St. Sauveur\r\nà Pentagoet, in 1613. The English came from Virginia to destroy this\r\nsettlement, scarcely yet commenced. After having suffered greatly from\r\nthe enemies of Catholicism and the Jesuits, Father Biard was sent back\r\nto France. He taught theology at Lyons for nine years, and died at\r\nAvignon, November 17, 1622. He was then chaplain to the King's troops.\r\nHe left a _Relation de la Nouvelle France_, and of the _Voyage of the\r\nJesuits_, as well as some other works.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LALEMANT was born at Paris in 1587, and entered the Society of\r\nJesus, at the age of twenty. Two of his brothers, Louis and Jerome,\r\nshortly afterwards followed his example, and the second labored for a\r\nlong time in the Canadian mission. He first came to Canada in 1625.\r\nCharlevoix says he accompanied the expedition from Acadia in 1613, for\r\nthe establishment of Pentagoet. He crossed the ocean four times in\r\nbehalf of his beloved mission, and was twice shipwrecked. Having been\r\ncaptured by the English in one of these voyages, he was retained some\r\ntime as a prisoner. His last voyage to Canada was made in 1634. In the\r\nfollowing year, he took charge of the House of our Lady of Recovery,\r\nwhich was then established in the lower city of Quebec, and commenced at\r\nthe same time the first schools for the French children. It was this\r\nfather who was with Champlain in his last moments. Many years afterward,\r\nhe returned to France, when he was successive chief of the Colleges of\r\nRouen, of La Flèche and Paris, and Superior of the Maison Professe in\r\nthe last named city. He died there, on the eighteenth of November, 1674,\r\naged eighty-seven years.\r\n\r\nFather CHARLES wrote an interesting _Relation on Canada_, inserted under\r\nthe date of August 1, in the _Mercure Français_ of 1626, and a letter on\r\nhis shipwrecks, which Champlain published in his edition of 1632. We\r\nhave also some religious works left by him.\r\n\r\nThe _Relation_ of Father Biard was published at Lyons, 1612 and 1616, in\r\n32mo. It gives an account of his travels and labors--the nature of the\r\ncountry, its mineral and vegetable productions, &c.\r\n\r\nThat of Father Lalemant is a long letter addressed to his brother\r\nJerome, and inserted in the _Mercure Français_, 1627-28: Paris, 1629. It\r\ntreats of the manners and customs of the Indians, the nature of the\r\ncountry, and the fatal change which trade had undergone since it had\r\nbecome a monopoly.\r\n\r\nContinuing the researches of Dr. O'Callaghan, Father Martin found, from\r\na catalogue of manuscripts on Canada, preserved among the archives of\r\nthe Jesuits at Rome, that there was a _Relation du Canada_ for 1676 and\r\nfor 1677: but it was not ascertained whether these were complete. Other\r\nmanuscripts were found in the same collection, but fragmentary, and\r\ncould only serve as the materiel of a general Relation. But a more\r\nimportant acquisition was made in the recovery of valuable manuscripts\r\nin Canada. There have been found two complete Relations, following that\r\nof 1672, and continuing the series to 1679. One is the Relation of 1673,\r\nand the other comprises a period of six years, from 1673 to 1679. They\r\nfortunately escaped the pillage of the Jesuit College at Quebec, Father\r\nCasot, the last of the old race of Jesuits, dying at Quebec in 1800, had\r\nconfided them, with other manuscripts, to the pious hands of the nuns of\r\nthe Hotel Dieu, in that city, who preserved them for a long time as a\r\nsacred trust, and restored them, to the Jesuits, when they returned to\r\nCanada in 1842.\r\n\r\nWhat increases the value of these historical monuments, is the fact,\r\nthat they are contemporary with the facts to which they relate. They\r\nbear numerous corrections, notes, and even entire pages, in the\r\nhandwriting of Father Dablon, then superior of the missions in Canada,\r\nwho, without doubt, prepared them for publication.\r\n\r\nThat of 1672-3 is anonymous, and in three parts. The first is on the\r\nHuron mission near Quebec, the second on the Iroquois missions, and the\r\nthird on the various missions to the west of the great lakes. In the\r\nlast part, consisting of eighty-seven pages, the thirty-ninth and\r\nfortieth are missing.\r\n\r\nThe Relation for 1673-9 is also anonymous and without a general title,\r\nbut on the back of the last leaf is an endorsement in the handwriting of\r\nFather Dablon, \"Relation en 1679, abrégé des précédentes.\" On the first\r\npage the writer announces that the relation embraces a period of six\r\nyears. It is divided into eight chapters, subdivided into paragraphs.\r\nThe second chapter is devoted to an account of the last labors and\r\nheroic death of Father MARQUETTE, on the lonely shore of the \"Lac des\r\nIllinois,\" now Lake Michigan. This relation passes in review all the\r\nmissions of the west, and enters into minute details concerning the\r\nmissions to the Iroquois, the Montagnais, the Gaspésiens, those of the\r\nSault St. Louis, and Lorette. It extends to 147 pages, but unfortunately\r\none entire sheet is lost, embracing the pages 109 to 118.\r\n\r\nThis last Relation should have included the other voyages of Father\r\nMarquette, and especially the discovery of the Mississippi in 1673; but\r\nanother manuscript of the same epoch, and which bears the same evidence\r\nof authenticity, explains the omission. Under the title of \"Voyage and\r\nDeath of Father Marquette,\" it recites in sixty pages the labors which\r\nhave immortalized that celebrated missionary. This curious manuscript\r\nfurnished Thevenot with the materiel for his publication in 1687,\r\nentitled \"Voyage et Découverte de quelques Pays et Nations de l'Amerique\r\nSeptentrionale, par le P. Marquette et le Sr. Joliet.\"[E] What adds\r\ngreat value to the manuscript is the fact that it is much more extended\r\nthan the publication of Thevenot. The causes and the preparations for\r\nthe expedition are recounted; and we can follow the missionary in his\r\nvarious travels, even to his last moments in 1675.\r\n\r\nTwo other documents, which complete this valuable historical discovery,\r\nare noticed by Father Martin:\r\n\r\n1. The autograph journal of Marquette's last voyage, from the\r\ntwenty-fifth of October 1674 to the sixth of April 1679, about a month\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\n2. The autograph map (by Marquette) of the Mississippi, as discovered by\r\nhim. This extends no farther than the \"A Kansea\" (Arkansas), where his\r\nvoyage in that direction terminated.\r\n\r\nThe map published by Thevenot, and recently reproduced by Rich,\r\nBancroft, and others, is incorrect in many particulars, especially with\r\nregard to this fact of the Arkansas being the lowest point reached by\r\nMarquette.\r\n\r\nBesides the two Relations (MS.) aforesaid, and the Marquette\r\nmanuscripts, fragments of the Relations for the years 1674, 1676, 1678,\r\nand the following years, have been found, but incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these, Father Martin calls attention to one of the\r\nprinted Relations, little known out of Italy, in the language of which\r\nit was written. It was printed at Macerata in 1653. A recent letter from\r\nFather Martin announces that he has completed translations into French\r\nand English, which will soon be published. It is the work of Father\r\nFrancois Joseph Bressani, and is thus noticed by Charlevoix:\r\n\r\n\"Father Bressani, a Roman by birth, was one of the most illustrious\r\nmissionaries to Canada, where he suffered a cruel captivity, and severe\r\ntortures. He speaks little of himself in his history, which is well\r\nwritten, but which relates almost entirely to the Huron mission, in\r\nwhich he labored with great zeal so long as it continued. After the\r\nalmost entire destruction of that nation, and the dispersion of the\r\nremainder, he returned to Italy, where he continued to preach until his\r\ndeath, with the greater success, inasmuch as he bore in his mutilated\r\nhands the glorious marks of his apostleship among the heathen.\"[F]\r\n\r\nThe translation by Father Martin will be illustrated by maps and\r\nengravings.\r\n\r\nRecent letters from Italy announce further discoveries in the library of\r\nthe Dominican Friars at Rome. We congratulate the historical student on\r\nthe recovery of these and similar memorials of the early history of the\r\ncountry. Especially the labors of the Jesuit missionaries deserve to be\r\nmore generally familiar to the readers of history; and we cordially\r\nrespond to the sentiment of approbation with which the services of Dr.\r\nO'Callaghan and Father Martin have been greeted heretofore by the press.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] History of New Netherland, or New-York under the Dutch. &c. 2 vols.\r\n8vo.

Genin, who appears to be as clever in writing\r\nas in making hats, has avowed himself a conservative, and in a long\r\nargument has vindicated the style of which he is so eminent a\r\nmanufacturer. But the \"people\" are for reform, and we must all bend to\r\nthe will of the people; land reform, bank reform, all kinds of reform,\r\nnow are forgotten in the cry for a reform in hats; this has rallied\r\naround it all ranks, classes and orders: they say, \"Take off your\r\nfunnels!\"\r\n\r\nIt has been responded to with enthusiasm. From the lord of one hundred\r\nthousand acres to the hard-worker for his daily bread--from the\r\nultra-conservative to the ultra-destructive--from the High-Churchman to\r\nthe No-Churchman--from the Puseyite to the Presbyterian--from the\r\ngentleman down to the veriest \"gent,\" this new question of Reform has\r\ndrawn unanimous adhesion. In fact, the attempted revolution in our head\r\ngear, more fortunate than the other revolutions talked about of late\r\nyears, promises to be successful.\r\n\r\nSays the London _News_, \"The ladies are as unanimous as the gentlemen on\r\nthe subject, and give the potent assistance of their voices to the\r\nmovement, and wonder how it is that men, who have so keen a sense of the\r\nbeautiful, should have been so long blinded to the ugliness imposed upon\r\ntheir lordly foreheads by the hat-makers. A few of the most conservative\r\nof these hat-makers are the only persons who venture a word in defence\r\nof the ancient barbarism which it is the object of the revolutionists to\r\nremove. Now and then a hatter of all novelties, whether of hats or of\r\nideas, will venture to come to the aid of the hat-makers, and to ask if\r\nany one can suggest a better head 'accoutrement' than the old familiar\r\nhat which it is attempted to scout out of society with such hasty\r\nignominy. But, if hatters and the hat conservatives are closely pressed\r\nto tell us what recommendation the article has, they are obliged to give\r\nup the argument in despair--to intrench themselves in the old fortress\r\nof such reasoners, and to defend what is, merely because it is. They\r\nwould stand on the old ways, were they knee-deep in slush; and they\r\nwould wear the old hat, were it not only of the shape, but of the\r\nmaterial and the color of a chimney-pot.\r\n\r\n\"Every body who has worn a hat, has perceived it to be a nuisance,\r\nalthough he may never have said any thing on the subject till the\r\npresent cry was raised. As soon as a man gets out of the streets of the\r\ncapital, or of his own accustomed provincial town, and sets foot in a\r\nrailway carriage or on board of a steamboat, his first care is to make\r\nhimself comfortable by disembarrassing his aching temples of his hat.\r\nThe funnel is put away, and a cap, more ornamental and a thousand times\r\nmore easy, is elevated to the place of honor, to the great satisfaction\r\nof the wearer. Who ever wears a hat at the sea-side? One might as well\r\ngo to bed in a hat, as wear one out of the purlieus of the town. At the\r\nsea-side, or in travelling, or sporting, or rambling over the hills, the\r\nordinary hat is utterly out of the question. Not only is the hat\r\nunsightly, expensive, and incommodious;--not only does it offend those\r\n_æsthetic_ notions which are so fashionable in our time, but it may be\r\nsafely alleged that it is hostile to all mental effort. Did any man ever\r\nmake an eloquent speech with a hat on? Could a painter paint a good\r\npicture if he had a hat on while engaged at the easel? Could a\r\nmathematician solve a problem? could a musician compose a melody or\r\narrange a harmony? could a poet write a song, or a novelist a novel, or\r\na journalist a leading article, with a hat on? The thing is impossible.\r\nWould any man who respected himself, or the feelings of his family and\r\nfriends, consent to have his portrait painted with the offensive article\r\nupon his cranium? It would be almost a proof of insanity, both in the\r\nsitter who should insist upon, and the artist who should lend himself\r\nto, the perpetration of such an atrocity. We have but to fancy one out\r\nof the thousand statues of bronze or marble which it is proposed to\r\nerect to the memory of Sir Robert Peel in our great towns and cities,\r\nsurmounted with a hat of marble or of bronze, to see, at a glance, the\r\nabsurdity of the thing, and the reasonableness of the demand for a\r\nchange. There is a very good bust of Chaucer, with a cap on, and there\r\nis a still more excellent bust of Lorenzo de Medici, which has also a\r\ncap; but we put the question to the most conservative of hatters, and to\r\nthe greatest stickler for the _etatus quo_ in head attire, whether he\r\nwould tolerate the marble or bronze portraiture of either of those\r\nworthies with the modern hat upon its head? The idea is so preposterous,\r\nthat, if fairly considered, it would make converts of the most obstinate\r\nsticklers for the hat of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, the suggestion for the reform of this article of costume is\r\nentitled to the utmost respect. Already Englishmen, when they throw off\r\nthe trammels of ceremony, and wish to be at their ease, substitute for\r\nthe stiff, uncomfortable, and inelegant hat, such other article as the\r\ntaste and enterprise of the hat and cap manufacturers have provided; and\r\nin France and Germany the hat has, for the last six or seven years, been\r\ngradually altering its form and substance, until it bids fair to be\r\nrestored, at no distant day, to the more sensible and picturesque shape\r\nwhich it had a couple of centuries ago. So much unanimity has been\r\nexpressed on the desirability of a change, so much sober truth has been\r\nuttered under the thin veil of jest on this matter, and so keenly felt\r\nare the inconveniences--to say nothing of the inelegance--of the tube\r\nwhich has usurped and maintained a place upon our heads for so long a\r\nperiod, that there can be no doubt the time is ripe for the introduction\r\nof an article of male head-dress more worthy of an educated, civilized,\r\nand sensible people. The Turks, under the influence of that great\r\nreformer, Sultan Mahmoud, and his worthy successor, Abdul Medjid, have\r\nbeen for some time assimilating themselves in dress to the other\r\ninhabitants of Europe. They have adopted our coats, our trousers, our\r\nvests, our boots. They have got steamboats and newspapers--but Sultan\r\nMahmoud stopped short at the hat. With all his _penchant_ for imitating\r\nthe 'Giaours,' he could not bring himself to recommend the hat to a\r\npeople whom he was desirous to civilize. Any man of taste and\r\nenterprise, who would take advantage of the present feeling on the\r\nsubject to manufacture a hat or cap of a more picturesque form, would\r\nconfer a public benefit, and would not lack encouragement for his wares.\r\nAn article which would protect the face from the sun, which the present\r\n'funnel' does not--which should be light, which the hat is not--which\r\nshould be elegant, and no offence to the eye of taste if painted in a\r\nportrait or sculptured in a statue, which the hat is not--and which\r\nshould meet the requirements of health, as well as those of comfort and\r\nappearance, which the hat is very far from doing--would, all jest and\r\n_persiflage_ apart, be a boon to the people of this generation. It needs\r\nbut example to effect the change, for the feeling is so strong and\r\nuniversal that a good substitute would meet with certain popularity. We\r\nhave no doubt that, sooner or later, this reform will be made; and that\r\nthe historian, writing fifty years hence, will note it in his book as a\r\nremarkable circumstance, and a proof of the pertinacity with which men\r\ncling to all which habit and custom have rendered familiar--that for\r\nthree-quarters of a century, if not longer, a piece of attire so\r\nrepugnant to the eye of taste, and so deficient in any quality which\r\nshould recommend it to sensible people, should have been not only\r\ntolerated, but admired. In all seriousness, we hope that the days of the\r\ntubular hat are numbered, and that in this instance philosophy in sport\r\nwill become reformation in earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL DEVOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Campbell said lately in the House of Lords, that the bill for the\r\nRegistration of Assurances was drawn by Mr. Duval, and he related an\r\nanecdote illustrative of that gentleman's entire devotion to his\r\nprofessional pursuits. A gentleman one day said to him, \"But do you not\r\nfind it very dull work poring from morning until night over those dusty\r\nsheep-skins?\" \"Why,\" said Duval, \"to be sure it is a little dull, but\r\nevery now and then I come across a brilliant deed, drawn by a great\r\nmaster, and the beauty of that recompenses me for the weariness of all\r\nthe others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE WILFULNESS OF WOMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an early number of _The International_ we mentioned a MS. comedy by\r\nthe late Mrs. OSGOOD, in connection with the commendations which the\r\ndramatic pieces of that admirable woman and most charming poet had\r\nreceived from Sheridan Knowles and other critics in that line. We\r\ntranscribe the opening scene of the play, which strikes us as\r\nexcellently fitted for the stage. The friends of the lamented authoress\r\nwill perceive that it is an eminently characteristic production, though\r\nhaving been written at an early age it scarcely illustrates her best\r\nstyle of dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT FIRST.--SCENE FIRST.\r\n\r\n_A room in the Chateau de Beaumont. Victorine de Vere and Rosalinde--the\r\nformer sitting._\r\n\r\nROSALINDE.--But consider, sweet lady, you have been betrothed from\r\nchildhood to my lord the Count. You say it was your father's dying wish\r\nthat you should marry him, and he has been brought up to consider you\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nVICTORINE.--And for that reason wed I _not_ the Count;\r\nI might have loved him had I not been _bid_,\r\nFor he is noble, brave, and passing kind.\r\nBut, Rosalinde, when 'mid my father's vines,\r\nA child I roamed, I shunned the rich, ripe fruit\r\nWithin my reach, and stretched my little arm\r\nBeyond its strength, for that which farthest hung,\r\nThough poorest too perchance. Years past away,\r\nThe wilful child is grown a woman now,\r\nYet wilful still, and wayward as the child.\r\n\r\n(_She Sings._)\r\n\r\nThough you wreathe in my raven hair jewels the rarest\r\n  That ever illumined the brow of a queen,\r\nI should think the least one that were wanting, the fairest,\r\n  And pout at their lustre in petulant spleen.\r\nTho' the diamond should lighten there, regal in splendor,\r\n  The topaz its sunny glow shed o'er the curl,\r\nAnd the emerald's ray tremble, timid and tender--\r\n  If the pearl were not by, I should sigh for the pearl!\r\n\r\nThough you fling at my feet all the loveliest flowers\r\n  That Summer is waking in forest and field,\r\nI should pine 'mid the bloom you had brought from her bowers\r\n  For some little blossom spring only could yield.\r\nTake the rose, with its passionate beauty and bloom,\r\n  The lily so pure, and the tulip so bright--\r\nSince I miss the sweet _violet's_ lowly perfume,\r\n  The violet _only_ my soul can delight!\r\n\r\nI prize not Henri--for a breath, a nod,\r\nCan make him mine for ever. _One_ I prize\r\nWhose pulse ne'er quickened at my step or voice,\r\nWho cares no more for smile from Victorine,\r\nWhom princes sue--than Victorine for them.\r\nBut he _shall_ love me--ay, and when he too\r\nLies pleading at my feet!--I make no doubt\r\nBut I shall weary of mine idle whim,\r\nAnd rate him well for daring to be there!\r\n\r\nROS.--Please you, my lady, who is this new victim?\r\n\r\nVIC.--Whom think you, Rosalinde? Eugene Legard! the brave young\r\ncaptain--lover of Carille--betrothed to her--about to marry her!\r\n\r\nROS.--But who's Carille, my lady?\r\n\r\nVIC.--(_Impatiently_.) Now know you not the youthful village belle whose\r\nface my gallant cousin raves about? I would he'd wed the girl, and leave\r\nLegard and me _as free_, to wed! (_Enter the Count._) What, torment!\r\nhere again! (_Exit Rosalinde._)\r\n\r\nCOUNT HENRI.--Where should I be, sweet coz? I love the sunshine!\r\n\r\nVIC.--So love you not this room--for here the sun ne'er shines.\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--The sun--_my_ sun is smiling on me now!\r\n\r\nVIC.--Oh, don't! I'm so tired of all that!\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--Lady, it shall not weary you again; I've borne your light\r\ncaprice too long already. For the last time I come to ask of you, madam,\r\nIs it your pleasure we fulfil at once your father's last injunction?\r\n\r\nVIC.--Ah! but this isn't the _last_ time, Henri; I'll wager you this\r\nhand with my heart in it, you will ask me the same question a dozen\r\ntimes yet ere you die.\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--I'll not gainsay you, lady; time will show. (_A short pause._)\r\nYet, by my sword, if such your wager be, I will be dumb till doomsday.\r\n\r\nVIC.--Then book the bet! and claim my heart and hand--(_she pauses--he\r\nwaits in eager hope_)--on--doomsday morning, cousin!\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--I claim thee now or never!\r\n\r\nVIC.--If they only hadn't said we _must_, Henri!\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--Pshaw!\r\n\r\nVIC.--Beside, all the world _expects_ it you know; I do so hate to\r\nfulfil people's expectations: it is so commonplace and humdrum!\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--Depend upon it, Lady Victorine, nobody ever expected you to do\r\nany thing reasonable or commonplace or humdrum!\r\n\r\n    (_He Sings._)\r\n\r\n    Archly on thy cheek,\r\n      Worth a god's imprinting,\r\n    Starry dimples speak,\r\n      Rich with rosy tinting,--\r\n    What a pity, love,\r\n      Anger's burning flushes\r\n    E'er should rise above\r\n      Those bewitching blushes!\r\n\r\n    Warm thy lip doth glow,\r\n      With such lovely color,\r\n    Ruby's heart would show\r\n      Hues of beauty duller,--\r\n    What a shame, the while,\r\n      Scorn should ever curl it,\r\n    And o'ercast the smile\r\n      That should still enfurl it!\r\n\r\n    Soft thy dark eye beams,\r\n      With the star-night's splendor,\r\n    Now with joy it gleams,\r\n      Now with tears 'tis tender,--\r\n    Ah! what pain to feel,\r\n      Ere another minute,\r\n    Passion's fire may steal\r\n      All the softness in it!\r\n\r\nVIC.--There! you CAN _sing_! I'll give the----hem!--his due. I only wish\r\nyou could make love as well as you make verses.\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--And how should I make love?\r\n\r\nVIC.--How? You should be at my feet all day and under my window all\r\nnight; you should call black white when _I_ call it so, and--wear a\r\nsingle hair of my eyelash next your heart for ever.\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--Hum! Any thing more, cousin?\r\n\r\nVIC.--Yes: you should write sonnets on the sole of my shoe, and study\r\nevery curve of my brow, as if life and death were in its rise or fall!\r\n(_He turns away._) Henri, come here! (_He approaches._) Come! you are a\r\ngood-looking man enough, after all! Ah! why couldn't my poor father have\r\n_forbidden_ me to marry you! He might have known I should have been\r\n_sure_ in that case to have fallen desperately in love with you, Henri!\r\n\r\nCOUNT.--By Heaven, I will bear this trifling no longer! I will write\r\ninstantly and propose to the peasant girl, Carille--_she_ will be proud\r\nto be called La Contesse de Beaumont.\r\n\r\nVIC.--_Will_ you do so? Oh, you darling cousin! I shall love you dearly\r\nwhen you are once married! And, cousin, I don't believe she'll live till\r\ndoomsday, do you? Don't forget that I'm to be your second--on doomsday\r\nmorning, cousin. (_Exit Count in a rage._) I am so happy--and Carille\r\nwill be so happy too--I am sure she will! I know if I were a village\r\ngirl I should be dying to be a lady--for now I am a lady I am dying to\r\nbe a village girl--heigh-ho. (_Exit._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[G]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 57._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nIn a very gaudily furnished parlor, and in a very gaudy dress, sat a\r\nlady of some eight or nine and thirty years of age, with many traces of\r\nbeauty still to be perceived in a face of no very intellectual\r\nexpression. Few persons perhaps would have recognized in her the fair\r\nand faulty girl whom we have depicted weeping bitterly over the fate of\r\nSir Philip Hastings' elder brother, and over the terrible situation in\r\nwhich he left her. Her features had much changed: the girlish\r\nexpression--the fresh bloom of youth was gone. The light graceful figure\r\nwas lost; but the mind had changed as greatly as the person, though,\r\nlike it, the heart yet retained some traces of the original. When first\r\nshe appeared before the reader's eyes, though weak and yielding, she was\r\nby no means ill disposed. She had committed an error--a great and fatal\r\none; but at heart she was innocent and honest. She was, however, like\r\nall weak people, of that plastic clay moulded easily by circumstances\r\ninto any form; and, in her, circumstances had shaped her gradually into\r\na much worse form than nature had originally given her. To defraud, to\r\ncheat, to wrong, had at one time been most abhorrent to her nature. She\r\nhad taken no active part in her father's dealings with old Sir John\r\nHastings, and had she known all that he had said and sworn, would have\r\nshrunk with horror from the deceit. But during her father's short life,\r\nshe had been often told by himself, and after his death had been often\r\nassured by the old woman Danby, that she was rightly and truly the widow\r\nof John Hastings, although because it would be difficult to prove, her\r\nfather had consented to take an annuity for himself and her son, rather\r\nthan enter into a lawsuit with a powerful man; and she had gradually\r\nbrought herself to believe that she had been her lover's wife, because\r\nin one of his ardent letters he had called her so to stifle the voice of\r\nremorse in her bosom. The conviction had grown upon her, till now, after\r\na lapse of more than twenty years, she had forgotten all her former\r\ndoubts and scruples, believed herself and her son to be injured and\r\ndeprived of their just rights, and was ready to assert her marriage\r\nboldly, though she had at one time felt and acknowledged that there was\r\nno marriage at all, and that the words her seducer had used were but\r\nintended to soothe her regret and terror. There was a point however\r\nbeyond which she was not prepared to go. She still shrunk from giving\r\nfalse details, from perjuring herself in regard to particular facts. The\r\nmarriage, she thought, might be good in the sight of heaven, of herself,\r\nand of her lover; but to render it good in the eyes of the law, she had\r\nfound would require proofs that she could not give--oaths that she dared\r\nnot take.\r\n\r\nAnother course, however, had been proposed for her; and now she sat in\r\nthat small parlor gaudily dressed, as I have said, but dressed evidently\r\nfor a journey. There were tears indeed in her eyes; and as her son stood\r\nby her side she looked up in his face with a beseeching look as if she\r\nwould fain have said, \"Pray do not drive me to this!\"\r\n\r\nBut young John Ayliffe had no remorse, and if he spoke tenderly to her\r\nwho had spoiled his youth, it was only because his object was to\r\npersuade and cajole.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, mother,\" he said, \"it is absolutely necessary or I would not\r\nask you to go. You know quite well that I would rather have you here:\r\nand it will only be for a short time till the trial is over. Lawyer\r\nShanks told you himself that if you stayed, they would have you into\r\ncourt and cross-examine you to death; and you know quite well you could\r\nnot keep in one story if they browbeat and puzzled you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say any where that my marriage was a good one,\" replied his\r\nmother, \"but I could not swear all that Shanks would have had me,\r\nJohn--No, I could not swear that, for Dr. Paulding had nothing to do\r\nwith it, and if he were to repeat it all over to me a thousand times, I\r\nam sure that I should make a blunder, even if I consented to tell such a\r\nfalsehood. My father and good Mrs. Danby used always to say that the\r\nmutual consent made a marriage, and a good one too. Now your father's\r\nown letter shows that he consented to it, and God knows I did. But these\r\nlawyers will not let well alone, and by trying to mend things make them\r\nworse, I think. However, I suppose you have gone too far to go back; and\r\nso I must go to a strange out of the way country and hide myself and\r\nlive quite lonely. Well, I am ready--I am ready to make any sacrifice\r\nfor you, my boy--though it is very hard, I must say.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she rose with her eyes running over, and her son kissed\r\nher and assured her that her absence should not be long. But just as she\r\nwas moving towards the door, he put a paper--a somewhat long one--on the\r\ntable, where a pen was already in the inkstand, saying, \"just sign this\r\nbefore you go, dear mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I cannot sign any thing,\" cried the lady, wiping her eyes; \"how can\r\nyou be so cruel, John, as to ask me to sign any thing just now when I am\r\nparting with you? What is it you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only a declaration that you are truly my father's widow,\" said\r\nJohn Ayliffe; \"see here, the declaration, &c., you need not read it, but\r\nonly just sign here.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated an instant; but his power over her was complete; and,\r\nthough she much doubted the contents, she signed the paper with a\r\ntrembling hand. Then came a parting full of real tenderness on her part,\r\nand assumed affection and regret on his. The post-chaise, which had been\r\nstanding for an hour at the door, rolled away, and John Ayliffe walked\r\nback into the house.\r\n\r\nWhen there, he walked up and down the room for some time, with an\r\nimpatient thoughtfulness, if I may use the term, in his looks, which had\r\nlittle to do with his mother's departure. He was glad that she was\r\ngone--still gladder that she had signed the paper; and now he seemed\r\nwaiting for something eagerly expected.\r\n\r\nAt length there came a sound of a quick trotting horse, and John Ayliffe\r\ntook the paper from the table hastily, and put it in his pocket. But the\r\nvisitor was not the one he expected. It was but a servant with a letter;\r\nand as the young man took it from the hand of the maid who brought it\r\nin, and gazed at the address, his cheek flushed a little, and then\r\nturned somewhat pale. He muttered to himself, \"she has not taken long to\r\nconsider!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the slipshod girl had gone out of the room, he broke the seal\r\nand read the brief answer which Emily had returned to his declaration.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy for an artist to paint, and it is impossible for a\r\nwriter to describe, the expression which came upon his face as he\r\nperused the words of decided rejection which were written on that sheet;\r\nbut certainly, had poor Emily heard how he cursed her, how he vowed to\r\nhave revenge, and to humble her pride, as he called it, she would have\r\nrejoiced rather than grieved that such a man had obtained no hold upon\r\nher affection, no command of her fate. He was still in the midst of his\r\ntempest of passion, when, without John Ayliffe being prepared for his\r\nappearance, Mr. Shanks entered the room. His face wore a dark and\r\nsomewhat anxious expression which even habitual cunning could not\r\nbanish; but the state in which he found his young client, seemed to take\r\nhim quite by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why what is the matter, John?\" he cried, \"what in the name of fortune\r\nhas happened here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What has happened!\" exclaimed John Ayliffe, \"look there,\" and he handed\r\nMr. Shanks the letter. The attorney took it, and with his keen weazel\r\neyes read it as deliberately as he would have read an ordinary law\r\npaper. He then handed it back to his young client, saying, \"The\r\nrespondent does not put in a bad answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn the respondent,\" said John Ayliffe, \"but she shall smart for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, this cannot be helped,\" rejoined Mr. Shanks; \"no need of\r\nputting yourself in a passion. You don't care two straws about her, and\r\nif you get the property without the girl so much the better. You can\r\nthen have the pick of all the pretty women in the country.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ayliffe mused gloomily; for Mr. Shanks was not altogether right in\r\nhis conclusion as to the young man's feelings towards Emily. Perhaps\r\nwhen he began the pursuit he cared little about its success, but like\r\nother beasts of prey, he had become eager as he ran--desire had arisen\r\nin the chase--and, though mortified vanity had the greatest share in his\r\nactual feelings, he felt something beyond that.\r\n\r\nWhile he mused, Mr. Shanks was musing also, calculating results and\r\ncombinations; but at length he said, in a low tone, \"Is she gone?--Have\r\nyou got that accomplished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone?--Yes.--Do you mean my mother?--Damn it, yes!--She is gone, to be\r\nsure.--Didn't you meet her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Shanks; \"I came the other way. That is lucky, however.\r\nBut harkee, John--something very unpleasant has happened, and we must\r\ntake some steps about it directly; for if they work him well, that\r\nfellow is likely to peach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?--what the devil are you talking about?\" asked John Ayliffe, with\r\nhis passion still unsubdued.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that blackguard whom you would employ--Master Tom Cutter,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Shanks. You know I always set my face against it, John; and\r\nnow----\"\r\n\r\n\"Peach!\" cried John Ayliffe, \"Tom Cutter will no more peach than he'll\r\nfly in the air. He's not of the peaching sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, where a few months' imprisonment are concerned,\" answered\r\nMr. Shanks; \"but the matter here is his neck, and that makes a mighty\r\ndifference, let me tell you. Now listen to me, John, and don't interrupt\r\nme till I've done; for be sure that we have got into a very unpleasant\r\nmess, which we may have some difficulty in getting out of. You sent over\r\nTom Cutter, to see if he could not persuade young Scantling, Lord\r\nSelby's gamekeeper, to remember something about the marriage, when he\r\nwas with his old father the sexton. Now, how he and Tom manage their\r\nmatters, I don't know; but Tom gave him a lick on the head with a stick,\r\nwhich killed him on the spot. As the devil would have it, all this was\r\nseen by two people, a laborer working in a ditch hard by, and\r\nScantling's son, a boy of ten years old. The end of it is, Tom was\r\ninstantly pursued, and apprehended; your good uncle, Sir John, was\r\ncalled to take the depositions, and without any remand whatever,\r\ncommitted our good friend for trial. Tom's only chance is to prove that\r\nit was a case of chance-medley, or to bring it under manslaughter, as a\r\nthing done in a passion, and if he thinks that being employed by you\r\nwill be any defence, or will show that it was a sudden burst of rage,\r\nwithout premeditation, he will tell the whole story as soon as he would\r\neat his dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd go over to him directly, and tell him to hold his tongue,\" cried\r\nJohn Ayliffe, now fully awakened to the perils of the case.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh, pooh! don't be a fool,\" said Mr. Shanks, contemptuously. \"Are you\r\ngoing to let the man see that you are afraid of him--that he has got you\r\nin his power? Besides, they will not let you in. No, the way must be\r\nthis. I must go over to him as his legal adviser, and I can dress you up\r\nas my clerk. That will please him, to find that we do not abandon him;\r\nand we must contrive to turn his defence quite another way, whether he\r\nhang for it or not. We must make it out that Scantling swore he had been\r\npoaching, when he had done nothing of the kind, and that in the quarrel\r\nthat followed, he struck the blow accidentally. We can persuade him that\r\nthis is his best defence, which perhaps it is after all, for nobody can\r\nprove that he was poaching, inasmuch as he really was not; whereas, if\r\nhe were to show that he killed a man while attempting to suborn\r\nevidence, he would speedily find himself under a cross-beam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suborn evidence,\" muttered John Ayliffe to himself; for though ready to\r\ndo any act that might advance his purpose, he did not like to hear it\r\ncalled by its right name.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, he agreed to the course proposed by the attorney,\r\nand it was determined that, waiting for the fall of night, they should\r\nboth go over to the prison together, and demand admittance to the\r\nfelon's cell. The conversation then reverted to Emily's distinct\r\nrejection of the young man's suit, and long did the two ponder over it,\r\nconsidering what might be the effect upon the plans they were pursuing.\r\n\r\n\"It may hurry us desperately,\" said Mr. Shanks, at length, \"unless we\r\ncan get her to hold her tongue; for depend upon it, as soon as Sir\r\nPhilip hears what we are doing, he will take his measures accordingly.\r\nDon't you think you and Mrs. Hazleton together can manage to frighten\r\nher into silence? If I were you, I would get upon my horse's back\r\ndirectly, ride over, and see what can be done. Your fair friend there\r\nwill give you every help, depend upon it.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ayliffe smiled. \"I will see,\" he said. \"Mrs. Hazleton is very kind\r\nabout it, and I dare say will help, for I am quite sure she has got some\r\npurpose of her own to serve.\"\r\n\r\nThe attorney grinned, but made no answer, and in the space of a quarter\r\nof an hour, John Ayliffe was on the road to Mrs. Hazleton's dwelling.\r\n\r\nAfter quarter of an hour's private conversation with the lady of the\r\nhouse, he was admitted to the room in which Emily sat, unconscious of\r\nhis being there. She was displeased and alarmed at seeing him, but his\r\nwords and his conduct after he entered, frightened and displeased her\r\nstill more. He demanded secrecy in a stern and peremptory tone, and\r\nthreatened with vague, but not ill-devised menaces, to be the ruin of\r\nher father and his whole house, if she breathed one word of what had\r\ntaken place between them. He sought, moreover, to obtain from her a\r\npromise of secrecy; but that Emily would on no account give, although he\r\nterrified her greatly; and he left her still in doubt as to whether his\r\nsecret was safe or not.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Hazleton he held another conference, but from her he received\r\nbetter assurances. \"Do not be afraid,\" she said; \"I will manage it for\r\nyou. She shall not betray you--at least for a time. However, you had\r\nbetter proceed as rapidly as possible, and if the means of pursuing your\r\nclaim be necessary--I mean in point of money--have no scruple in\r\napplying to me.\"\r\n\r\nPutting on an air of queenly dignity, Mrs. Hazleton proceeded in search\r\nof Emily, as soon as the young man was gone. She found her in tears; and\r\nsitting down by her side, she took her hand in a kindly manner, saying,\r\n\"My dear child, I am very sorry for all this, but it is really in some\r\ndegree your own fault. Nay, you need not explain any thing. I have just\r\nhad young Ayliffe with me. He has told me all, and I have dismissed him\r\nwith a sharp rebuke. If you had confided to me last night that he had\r\nproposed to you, and you had rejected him, I would have taken care that\r\nhe should not have admittance to you. Indeed, I am surprised that he\r\nshould presume to propose at all, without longer acquaintance. But he\r\nseems to have agitated and terrified you much. What did he want?\"\r\n\r\n\"He endeavored to make me promise,\" replied Emily, \"that I would not\r\ntell my father, or any one, of what had occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish boy! he might have taken that for granted,\" replied Mrs.\r\nHazleton, forgetting for an instant what she had just said. \"No woman of\r\nany delicacy ever speaks of a matter of this kind, when once she has\r\ntaken upon herself to reject a proposal unconditionally. If she wishes\r\nfor advice,\" continued the lady, recollecting herself, \"or thinks that\r\nthe suit may be pressed improperly, of course she's free to ask counsel\r\nand assistance of some female friend, on whom she can depend. But the\r\nmoment the thing is decided, of course, she is silent for ever; for\r\nnothing can be more a matter of honorable confidence than an avowal of\r\nhonorable love. I will write him a note, and tell him he is in no\r\ndanger, but warn him not to present himself here again, so long as you\r\nare with me.\"\r\n\r\nEmily made no answer, trying to decide in her own mind whether Mrs.\r\nHazleton's reasoning was right; and that lady, choosing to take her\r\nassent for granted, from her silence, hurried away, to give her no\r\nopportunity for retracting.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G. P. R.\r\nJames, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of a large brick building, with no windows towards the\r\nstreet, and tall walls rising up till they overtopped the neighboring\r\nhouses, stood two men, about an hour after night had fallen, waiting for\r\nadmittance. The great large iron bar which formed the knocker of the\r\ndoor, had descended twice with a heavy thump, but yet no one appeared in\r\nanswer to the summons. It was again in the hand of Mr. Shanks and ready\r\nto descend, when the rattling of keys was heard inside; bolts were\r\nwithdrawn and bars cast down, and one half of the door opened,\r\ndisplaying a man with a lantern, which he held up to gaze at his\r\nvisitors. His face was fat and bloated, covered with a good number of\r\nspots, and his swollen eyelids made his little keen black eyes look\r\nsmaller than they even naturally were, while his nose, much in the shape\r\nof a horsechestnut, blushed with the hues of the early morning.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Cram, how are you?\" asked the attorney. \"I haven't been\r\nhere for a long time, but you know me, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know you, Master Shanks,\" replied the jailer, winking one of\r\nhis small black eyes; \"who have you come to see? Betty Diaper, I'll\r\nwarrant, who prigged the gentleman's purse at the bottom of the hill.\r\nShe's as slink a diver as any on the lay; but she's got the shiners and\r\nso must have counsel to defend her before the beak, I'll bet a gallon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" answered Mr. Shanks, \"our old friend Tom Cutter wants to see\r\nme on this little affair of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll make no hand of that, as sure as my name's Dionysius Cram,\"\r\nreplied the jailer. \"Can't prove an _alibi_ there, Master Shanks, for I\r\nsaw him do the job; besides he can't pay. What's the use of meddling\r\nwith him? He must swing some time you know, and one day's as good as\r\nanother. But come in, Master Shanks, come in. But who's this here other\r\nchap?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my clerk,\" replied Mr. Shanks, \"I may want him to take\r\ninstructions.\"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed, but demurred, but a crown piece was in those days the\r\nkey to all jailers' hearts, and after a show of hesitation, Shanks and\r\nhis young companion were both admitted within the gates. They now found\r\nthemselves in a small square space, guarded on two sides by tall iron\r\nrailings, which bent overhead, and were let into the wall somewhat after\r\nthe manner of a birdcage. On the left-hand side, however, was another\r\nbrick wall, with a door and some steps leading up to it. By this\r\nentrance Mr. Dionysius Cram led them into a small jailer's lodge, with a\r\ntable and some wooden chairs, in the side of which, opposite to the\r\nentrance, was a strong movable grate, between the bars of which might be\r\nseen a yawning sort of chasm leading into the heart of the prison.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Cram's great keys were put in motion, and he opened the grate\r\nto let them pass, eyeing John Ayliffe with considerable attention as he\r\ndid so. Locking the grate carefully behind him, he lighted them on with\r\nhis lantern, muttering as he went in the peculiar prison slang of those\r\ndays, various sentences not very complimentary to the tastes and habits\r\nof young John Ayliffe, \"Ay, ay,\" he said, \"clerk be damned! One of Tom's\r\npals, for a pint and a boiled bone--droll I don't know him. He must be\r\ntwenty, and ought to have been in the stone pitcher often enough before\r\nnow. Dare say he's been sent to Mill Dol, for some minor. That's not in\r\nmy department, I shall have the darbies on him some day. He'd look\r\nhandsome under the tree.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ayliffe had a strong inclination to knock him down, but he\r\nrestrained himself, and at length a large plated iron door admitted the\r\ntwo gentlemen into the penetralia of the temple.\r\n\r\nA powerful smell of aqua vitæ and other kinds of strong waters now\r\npervaded the atmosphere, mingled with that close sickly odor which is\r\nfelt where great numbers of uncleanly human beings are closely packed\r\ntogether; and from some distance was heard the sounds of riotous\r\nmerriment, ribald song, and hoarse, unfeeling laugh, with curses and\r\nexecrations not a few. It was a time when the abominations of the prison\r\nsystem were at their height.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you step in here,\" said Mr. Cram to the attorney and his\r\ncompanion, \"and I'll bring Tom to you in a minute. He's having a lush\r\nwith some of his pals; though I thought we were going to have a mill,\r\nfor Jack Perkins, who is to be hanged o' Monday, roused out his slack\r\njaw at him for some quarrel about a gal, and Tom don't bear such like\r\neasily. Howsumdever, they made it up and clubbed a gallon. Stay, I'll\r\nget you a candle end;\" and leaving them in the dark, not much, if the\r\ntruth must be told, to the satisfaction of John Ayliffe, he rolled away\r\nalong the passage and remained absent several minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, a clanking step followed him, as heavy irons were\r\ndragged slowly on by unaccustomed limbs, and the moment after, Tom\r\nCutter stood in the presence of his two friends.\r\n\r\nThe jailer brought them in a piece of candle about two inches long,\r\nwhich he stuck into a sort of socket attached to an iron bar projecting\r\nstraight from the wall; and having done this he left the three together,\r\ntaking care to close and lock the door behind him.\r\n\r\nChair or stool in the room there was none, and the only seat, except the\r\nfloor, which the place afforded was the edge of a small wooden bedstead\r\nor trough, as it might be called, scantily furnished with straw.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Shanks and John Ayliffe shook hands with the felon, whose face,\r\nthough somewhat flushed with drinking, bore traces of deeper and sterner\r\nfeelings than he chose to show. He seemed glad to see them, however, and\r\nsaid it was very kind of them to come, adding with an inquiring look at\r\nMr. Shanks, \"I can't pay you, you know, Master lawyer; for what between\r\nmy garnish and lush, I shall have just enough to keep me till the\r\n'sizes; I shan't need much after that I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh, pooh,\" cried the attorney, \"don't be downhearted, Tom, and as to\r\npay, never mind that. John here will pay all that's needful, and we'll\r\nhave down counsellor Twistem to work the witnesses. We can't make out an\r\n_alibi_, for the folks saw you, but we'll get you up a character, if\r\nmoney can make a reputation, and I never knew the time in England when\r\nit could not. We have come to consult with you at once as to what's the\r\nbest defence to be made, that we may have the story all pat and right\r\nfrom the beginning, and no shifting and turning afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I hadn't killed the man,\" said Tom Cutter, gloomily; \"I shan't\r\nforget his face in a hurry as he fell over and cried out 'Oh, my\r\npoor--!' but the last word choked him. He couldn't get it out; but I\r\nfancy he was thinking of his wife--or maybe his children. But what could\r\nI do? He gave me a sight of bad names, and swore he would peach about\r\nwhat I wanted him to do. He called me a villain, and a scoundrel, and a\r\ncheat, and a great deal more besides, till my blood got up, and having\r\ngot the stick by the small end, I hit him with the knob on the temple. I\r\ndidn't know I hit so hard; but I was in a rage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I thought--just what I thought,\" said Mr. Shanks. \"You\r\nstruck him without premeditation in a fit of passion. Now if we can make\r\nout that he provoked you beyond bearing--\"\r\n\r\n\"That he did,\" said Tom Cutter.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I say,\" continued Mr. Shanks, \"if we can make out that he\r\nprovoked you beyond bearing while you were doing nothing unlawful and\r\nwrong, that isn't murder, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" said Tom Cutter, \"but how will you get that up, Mr. Shanks? I've\r\na notion that what I went to him about was devilish unlawful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but nobody knew any thing of that but you and he, and John Ayliffe\r\nand I. We must keep that quite close, and get up a likely story about\r\nthe quarrel. You will have to tell it yourself, you know, Tom, though\r\nwe'll make counsellor Twistem let the jury see it beforehand in his\r\nexaminations.\"\r\n\r\nA gleam of hope seemed to lighten the man's face, and Mr. Shanks\r\ncontinued, \"We can prove, I dare say, that this fellow Scantling had a\r\ngreat hatred for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, he had not,\" said Tom Cutter, \"he was more civil to me than\r\nmost, for we had been boys together.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter,\" said Mr. Shanks, \"we must prove it; for that's\r\nyour only chance, Tom. If we can prove that you always spoke well of\r\nhim, so much the better; but we must show that he was accustomed to\r\nabuse you, and to call you a damned ruffian and a poacher. We'll do\r\nit--we'll do it; and then if you stick tight to your story, we'll get\r\nyou off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what's the story to be, master Shanks?\" asked Tom Cutter, \"I can't\r\nlearn a long one; I never was good at learning by heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; it shall be as short and simple as possible,\" replied Shanks;\r\n\"you must admit having gone over to see him, and that you struck the\r\nblow that killed him. We can't get over that, Tom; but then you must say\r\nyou're exceedingly sorry, and was so the very moment after.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I was,\" replied Tom Cutter.\r\n\r\n\"And your story must refer,\" continued Mr. Shanks, \"to nothing but what\r\ntook place just before the blow was struck. You must say that you heard\r\nhe accused you of putting wires in Lord Selby's woods, and that you went\r\nover to clear yourself; but that he abused you so violently, and\r\ninsulted you so grossly, your blood got up and you struck him, only\r\nintending to knock him down. Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well--quite well,\" replied Tom Cutter, his face brightening; \"I\r\ndo think that may do, 'specially if you can make out that I was\r\naccustomed to speak well of him, and he to abuse me. It's an accident\r\nthat might happen to any man.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" replied Mr. Shanks; \"we will take care to corroborate your\r\nstory, only you get it quite right. Now let us hear what you will say.\"\r\n\r\nTom Cutter repeated the tale he had been taught very accurately; for it\r\nwas just suited to his comprehension, and Shanks rubbed his hands,\r\nsaying, \"That will do--that will do.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ayliffe, however, was still not without his anxieties, and after a\r\nlittle hesitation as to how he should put the question which he\r\nmeditated, he said, \"Of course, Tom, I suppose you have not told any of\r\nthe fellows here what you came over for?\"\r\n\r\nThe ruffian knew him better than he thought, and understood his object\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, John,\" he said, \"I have'nt peached, and shall not; be you sure\r\nof that. If I am to die, I'll die game, depend upon it; but I do think\r\nthere's a chance now, and we may as well make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure--to be sure,\" answered the more prudent Shanks; \"you don't\r\nthink, Mr. Ayliffe, that he would be fool enough to go and cut his own\r\nthroat by telling any one what would be sure to hang him. That is a very\r\ngreen notion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, nor would I say a word that could serve that Sir Philip\r\nHastings,\" said Tom Cutter; \"he's been my enemy for the last ten years,\r\nand I could see he would be as glad to twist my neck as I have been to\r\ntwist his hares. Perhaps I may live to pay him yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure you might not give him a gentle rub in your defence,\" said\r\nJohn Ayliffe; \"he would not like to hear that his pretty proud daughter\r\nEmily came down to see me, as I'm sure she did, let her say what she\r\nwill, when I was ill at the cottage by the park gates. You were in the\r\nhouse, don't you recollect, getting a jug of beer, while I was sitting\r\nat the door when she came down?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember, I remember,\" replied Tom Cutter, with a malicious smile; \"I\r\ngave him one rub which he didn't like when he committed me, and I'll do\r\nthis too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" said Mr. Shanks, \"you had better not mix up other things\r\nwith your defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can do it quite easily,\" replied the other with a triumphant\r\nlook; \"I could tell what happened then, and how I heard there that\r\npeople suspected me of poaching still, though I had quite given it up,\r\nand how I determined to find out from that minute who it was accused\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"That can do no harm,\" said Shanks, who had not the least objection to\r\nsee Sir Philip Hastings mortified; and after about half an hour's\r\nfarther conversation, having supplied Tom Cutter with a small sum of\r\nmoney, the lawyer and his young companion prepared to withdraw. Shanks\r\nwhistled through the key-hole of the door, producing a shrill loud sound\r\nas if he were blowing over the top of a key; and Dionysius Cram\r\nunderstanding the signal, hastened to let them out.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed farther, however, with any other personage, we may as\r\nwell trace the fate of Mr. Thomas Cutter.\r\n\r\nThe assizes were approaching near at this time, and about a fortnight\r\nafter, he was brought to trial; not all the skill of counsellor Twistem,\r\nhowever, nor the excellent character which Mr. Shanks tried to procure\r\nfor him, had any effect; his reputation was too well established to be\r\naffected by any scandalous reports of his being a peaceable and orderly\r\nman. His violence and irregular life were too well known for the jury to\r\ncome to any other conclusion than that it would be a good thing to rid\r\nthe country of him, and whether very legally or not, I cannot say, they\r\nbrought in a verdict of wilful murder without quitting the box. His\r\ndefence, however, established for him the name of a very clever fellow,\r\nand one portion of it certainly sent Sir Philip Hastings from the Court\r\nthoughtful and gloomy. Nevertheless, no recommendation to mercy having\r\nissued from the Judge, Tom Cutter was hanged in due form of law, and to\r\nuse his own words, \"died game.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nWe must go back a little, for we have somewhat anticipated our tale.\r\nNever did summons strike more joyfully on the ear of mortal than came\r\nthat of her recall home to Emily Hastings. As so often happens to all in\r\nlife, the expected pleasure had turned to ashes on the lip, and her\r\nvisit to Mrs. Hazleton offered hardly one point on which memory could\r\nrest happily. Nay, more, without being able definitely to say why, when\r\nshe questioned her own heart, the character of her beautiful hostess had\r\nsuffered by close inspection. She was not the same in Emily's esteem as\r\nshe had been before. She could not point out what Mrs. Hazleton had said\r\nor done to produce such an impression; but she was less amiable,--less\r\nreverenced. It was not alone that the trappings in which a young\r\nimagination had decked her were stripped off; but it was that a baser\r\nmetal beneath had here and there shown doubtfully through the gilding\r\nwith which she concealed her real character.\r\n\r\nIf the summons was joyful to Emily, it was a surprise and an unpleasant\r\none to Mrs. Hazleton. Not that she wished to keep her young guest with\r\nher long; for she was too keen and shrewd not to perceive that Emily\r\nwould not be worked upon so easily as she had imagined; and that under\r\nher very youthfulness there was a strength of character which must\r\nrender one part of the plans against her certainly abortive. But Mrs.\r\nHazleton was taken by surprise. She could have wished to guard against\r\nconstruction of some parts of her conduct which must be the more\r\nunpleasant, because the more just. She had fancied she would have time\r\nto give what gloss she chose to her conduct in Emily's eyes, and to\r\nprevent dangerous explanations between the father and the daughter.\r\nMoreover, the suddenness of the call alarmed her and raised doubts.\r\nWhereever there is something to be concealed there is something to be\r\nfeared, and Mrs. Hazleton asked herself if Emily had found means to\r\ncommunicate to Sir Philip Hastings what had occurred with John Ayliffe.\r\n\r\nThat, however, she soon concluded was impossible. Some knowledge of the\r\nfacts, nevertheless, might have reached him from other sources, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton grew uneasy. Sir Philip's letter to his daughter, which Emily\r\nat once suffered her hostess to see, threw no light upon the subject. It\r\nwas brief, unexplicit, and though perfectly kind and tender, peremptory.\r\nIt merely required her to return to the Hall, as some business rendered\r\nher presence at home necessary.\r\n\r\nLittle did Mrs. Hazleton divine the business to which Sir Philip\r\nalluded. Had she known it, what might have happened who can say? There\r\nwere terribly strong passions within that fair bosom, and there were\r\nmoments when those strong passions mastered even strong worldly sense\r\nand habitual self-control.\r\n\r\nThere was not much time, however, for even thought, and less for\r\npreparation. Emily departed, after having received a few words of\r\naffectionate caution from Mrs. Hazleton, delicately and skilfully put,\r\nin such a manner as to produce the impression that she was speaking of\r\nsubjects personally indifferent to herself--except in so much as her\r\nyoung friend's own happiness was concerned.\r\n\r\nShall we say the truth? Emily attended but little. Her thoughts were\r\nfull of her father's letter, and of the joy of returning to a home where\r\ndays passed peacefully in an even quiet course, very different from that\r\nin which the stream of time had flowed at Mrs. Hazleton's. The love of\r\nstrong emotions--the brandy-drinking of the mind--is an acquired taste.\r\nFew, very few have it from nature. Poor Emily, she little knew how many\r\nstrong emotions were preparing for her.\r\n\r\nGladly she saw the carriage roll onward through scenes more and more\r\nfamiliar at every step. Gladly she saw the forked gates appear, and\r\nmarked the old well-known hawthorns as they flitted by her; and the look\r\nof joy with which she sprang into her father's arms, might have\r\nconvinced any heart that there was but one home she loved.\r\n\r\n\"Now go and dress for dinner at once, my child,\" said Sir Philip, \"we\r\nhave delayed two hours for you. Be not long.\"\r\n\r\nNor was Emily long; she could not have been more rapid had she known\r\nthat Marlow was waiting eagerly for her appearance. Well pleased,\r\nindeed, was she to see him, when she entered the drawing-room; but for\r\nthe first time since she had known him--from some cause or other--a\r\nmomentary feeling of embarrassment--of timidity, came upon her; and the\r\ncolor rose slightly in her cheek. Her eyes spoke, however, more than her\r\nlips could say, and Marlow must have been satisfied, if lovers ever\r\ncould be satisfied.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was lying languidly on a couch, not knowing how to\r\nintimate to her daughter her disapproval of a suit yet unknown to Emily\r\nherself. She could not venture to utter openly one word in opposition;\r\nfor Sir Philip Hastings had desired her not to do so, and she had given\r\na promise to forbear, but she thought it would be perfectly consistent\r\nwith that promise, and perfectly fair and right to show in other ways\r\nthan by words, that Mr. Marlow was not the man she would have chosen for\r\nher daughter's husband, and even to insinuate objections which she dare\r\nnot state directly.\r\n\r\nIn her manner to Marlow therefore, Lady Hastings, though perfectly\r\ncourteous and polite--for such was Sir Philip's pleasure--was as cold as\r\nice, always added \"Sir\" to her replies, and never forgot herself so far\r\nas to call him by his name.\r\n\r\nEmily remarked this demeanor; but she knew--I should rather have said\r\nshe was aware; for it was a matter more of sensation than thought--a\r\nconviction that had grown up in her mind without reflection--she was\r\naware that her mother was somewhat capricious in her friendships. She\r\nhad seen it in the case of servants and of some of the governesses she\r\nhad had when she was quite young. One day they would be all that was\r\nestimable and charming in Lady Hastings' eyes, and another, from some\r\nslight offence--some point of demeanor which she did not like--or some\r\nmoody turn of her own mind, they would be all that was detestable. It\r\nhad often been the same, too, with persons of a higher station; and\r\ntherefore it did not in the least surprise her to find that Mr. Marlow,\r\nwho had been ever received by Lady Hastings before as a familiar friend,\r\nshould now be treated almost as a stranger.\r\n\r\nIt grieved her, nevertheless, and she thought that Marlow must feel her\r\nmother's conduct painfully. She would fain have made up for it by any\r\nmeans in her power, and thus the demeanor of Lady Hastings had an effect\r\nthe direct reverse of that which she intended. Nor did her innuendos\r\nproduce any better results, for she soon saw that they grieved and\r\noffended her husband, while her daughter showed marvellous stupidity, as\r\nshe thought, in not comprehending them.\r\n\r\nFull of love, and now full of hope likewise, Marlow, it must be\r\nconfessed, thought very little of Lady Hastings at all. He was one of\r\nthose men upon whom love sits well--they are but few in the world--and\r\nwhatever agitation he might feel at heart, there was none apparent in\r\nhis manner. His attention to Emily was decided, pointed, not to be\r\nmistaken by any one well acquainted with such matters; but he was quite\r\ncalm and quiet about it; there was no flutter about it--no forgetfulness\r\nof proprieties; and his conversation had never seemed to Emily so\r\nagreeable as that night, although the poor girl knew not what was the\r\nadditional charm. Delightful to her, however, it was; and in enjoying it\r\nshe forgot altogether that she had been sent for about business--nay,\r\neven forgot to wonder what that business could be.\r\n\r\nThus passed the evening; and when the usual time for retiring came,\r\nEmily was a little surprised that there was no announcement of Mr.\r\nMarlow's horse, or Mr. Marlow's carriage, as had ever been the case\r\nbefore, but that Mr. Marlow was going to spend some days at the hall.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Hastings rose to go to rest, and her daughter rose to go with\r\nher, another thing struck Emily as strange. Sir Philip, as his wife\r\npassed him, addressed to her the single word \"Beware!\" with a very\r\nmarked emphasis. Lady Hastings merely bowed her head, in reply; but when\r\nshe and Emily arrived at her dressing-room, where the daughter had\r\ngenerally stayed to spend a few minutes with her mother alone, Lady\r\nHastings kissed her, and wished her good night, declaring that she felt\r\nmuch fatigue, and would ring for her maid at once.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was a very good woman, and wished to obey her husband's\r\ninjunctions to the letter, but she felt afraid of herself, and would not\r\ntrust herself with Emily alone.\r\n\r\nDear Emily lay awake for half an hour after she had sought her pillow,\r\nbut not more, and then she fell into a sleep as soft and calm as that of\r\nchildhood, and the next morning rose as blooming as the flower of June.\r\nSir Philip was up when she went down stairs, and walking on the terrace\r\nwith Marlow. Lady Hastings sent word that she would breakfast in her own\r\nroom, when she had obtained a few hours' rest, as she had not slept all\r\nnight. Thus Emily had to attend to the breakfast-table in her mother's\r\nplace; but in those days the lady's functions at the morning meal were\r\nnot so various and important as at present; and the breakfast passed\r\nlightly and pleasantly. Still there was no mention of the business which\r\nhad caused Emily to be summoned so suddenly, and when the breakfast was\r\nover, Sir Philip retired to his library, without asking Emily to follow,\r\nand merely saying, \"You had better not disturb your mother, my dear\r\nchild. If you take a walk I will join you ere long.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time, a doubt, a notion--for I must not call it a\r\nsuspicion--came across the mind of Emily, that the business for which\r\nshe had been sent might have something to do with Mr. Marlow. How her\r\nlittle heart beat! She sat quite still for a minute or two, for she did\r\nnot know, if she rose, what would become of her.\r\n\r\nAt length the voice of Marlow roused her from her gently-troubled\r\nreverie, as he said, \"Will you not come out to take a walk?\"\r\n\r\nShe consented at once, and went away to prepare. Nor was she long, for\r\nin less than ten minutes, she and Marlow were crossing the park, towards\r\nthe older and thicker trees amidst which they had rambled once before.\r\nBut it was Marlow who now led her on a path which he chose himself. I\r\nknow not whether it was some memory of his walk with Mrs. Hazleton, or\r\nwhether it was that instinct which leads love to seek shady places, or\r\nwhether, like a skilful general, he had previously reconnoitred the\r\nground; but something or other in his own breast induced him to deviate\r\nfrom the more direct track which they had followed on their previous\r\nwalk, and guide his fair companion across the short dry turf towards the\r\nthickest part of the wood, through which there penetrated, winding in\r\nand out amongst the trees, a small path, just wide enough for two,\r\nbowered overhead by crossing branches, and gaining sweet woodland scenes\r\nof light and shade at every step, as the eye dived into the deep green\r\nstillness between the large old trunks, carefully freed from underwood,\r\nand with their feet carpeted with moss, and flowers, and fern. It was\r\ncalled the deer's track, from the fact that along it, morning and\r\nevening, all the bucks and does which had herded on that side of the\r\npark might be seen walking stately down to or from a bright,\r\nclear-running trout-stream, that wandered along about a quarter of a\r\nmile farther on; and often, in the hot weather, a person standing half\r\nway down the walk might see a tall antlered fellow standing with his\r\nforefeet in the water and his hind-quarters raised upon the bank, gazing\r\nat himself in the liquid mirror below, with all his graceful beauties\r\ndisplayed to the uttermost by a burst of yellow light, which towards\r\nnoon always poured upon the stream at that place.\r\n\r\nMarlow and Emily, however, were quite alone upon the walk. Not even a\r\nhind or shart was there; and after the first two or three steps, Marlow\r\nasked his fair companion to take his arm. She did so, readily; for she\r\nneeded it, not so much because the long gnarled roots of the trees\r\ncrossed the path from time to time, and offered slight impediments, for\r\nusually her foot was light as air, but because she felt an unaccountable\r\nlanguor upon her, a tremulous, agitated sort of unknown happiness unlike\r\nany thing else she had ever before experienced.\r\n\r\nMarlow drew her little hand through his then, and she rested upon it,\r\nnot with the light touch of a mere acquaintance, but with a gentle\r\nconfiding pressure which was very pleasant to him, and yet the\r\ncapricious man must needs every two or three minutes, change that kindly\r\nposition as the trees and irregularities of the walk afforded an excuse.\r\nNow he placed Emily on the one side, now on the other, and if she had\r\nthought at all (but by this time she was far past thought,) she might\r\nhave fancied that he did so solely for the purpose of once more taking\r\nher hand in his to draw it through his arm again.\r\n\r\nAt the spot where the walk struck the stream, and before it proceeded\r\nonward by the bank, there was a little irregular open space not twenty\r\nyards broad in any direction, canopied over by the tall branches of an\r\noak, and beneath the shade about twelve yards from the margin of the\r\nstream, was a pure, clear, shallow well of exceedingly cold water, which\r\nas it quietly flowed over the brink went on to join the rivulet below.\r\nThe well was taken care of, kept clean, and basined in plain flat\r\nstones; but there was no temple over it, Gothic or Greek. On the side\r\nfarthest from the stream was a plain wooden bench placed for the\r\nconvenience of persons who came to drink the waters which were supposed\r\nto have some salutary influence, and there by tacit consent Marlow and\r\nEmily seated themselves side by side.\r\n\r\nThey gazed into the clear little well at their feet, seeing all the\r\nround variegated pebbles at the bottom glistening like jewels as the\r\nbranches above, moved by a fresh wind that was stirring in the sky, made\r\nthe checkered light dance over the surface. There was a green leaf\r\nbroken by some chance from a bough above which floated about upon the\r\nwater as the air fanned it gently, now hither, now thither, now gilded\r\nby the sunshine, now covered with dim shadow. After pausing in silence\r\nfor a moment or two, Marlow pointed to the leaf with a light and\r\nseemingly careless smile, saying, \"See how it floats about, Emily. That\r\nleaf is like a young heart full of love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Emily, looking full in his face with a look of inquiry,\r\nfor perhaps she thought that in his smile she might find an\r\ninterpretation of what was going on in her own bosom. \"Indeed! How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see,\" said Marlow, \"how it is blown about by the softest\r\nbreath, which stirs not the less sensitive things around, how it is\r\ncarried by any passing air now into bright hopeful light, now into dim\r\nmelancholy shadow?\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that like love?\" asked Emily. \"I should have thought it was all\r\nbrightness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, happy love--love returned,\" replied Marlow, \"but where there is\r\nuncertainty, a doubt, there hope and fear make alternately the light and\r\nshade of love, and the lightest breath will bear the heart from the one\r\nextreme to the other--I know it from the experience of the last three\r\ndays, Emily; for since last we met I too have fluctuated between the\r\nlight and shade. Your father's consent has given a momentary gleam of\r\nhope, but it is only you who can make the light permanent.\"\r\n\r\nEmily shook, and her eyes were bent down upon the water; but she\r\nremained silent so long that Marlow became even more agitated than\r\nherself. \"I know not what I feel,\" she murmured at length,--\"it is very\r\nstrange.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hear me, Emily,\" said Marlow, taking her unresisting hand, \"I do\r\nnot ask an immediate answer to my suit. If you regard me with any\r\nfavor--if I am not perfectly indifferent to you, let me try to improve\r\nany kindly feelings in your heart towards me in the bright hope of\r\nwinning you at last for my own, my wife. The uncertainty may be\r\npainful--must be painful; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Marlow,\" cried Emily, raising her eyes to his face for an\r\ninstant with her cheek all glowing, \"there must be no uncertainty. Do\r\nyou think I would keep you--you, in such a painful state as you have\r\nmentioned? Heaven forbid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what am I to think?\" asked Marlow, pressing closer to her side and\r\ngliding his arm round her. \"I am almost mad to dream of such happiness,\r\nand yet your tone, your look, my Emily, make me so rash. Tell me\r\nthen--tell me at once, am I to hope or to despair?--Will you be mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she answered, \"can you doubt it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can almost doubt my senses,\" said Marlow; but he had no occasion to\r\ndoubt them.\r\n\r\nThey sat there for nearly half an hour; they then wandered on, with\r\nmarvellous meanderings in their course, for more than an hour and a half\r\nmore, and when they returned, Emily knew more of love than ever could be\r\nlearned from books. Marlow drew her feelings forth and gave them\r\ndefinite form and consistency. He presented them to her by telling what\r\nhe himself felt in a plain and tangible shape, which required no long\r\nreverie--none of their deep fits of thoughtfulness to investigate and\r\ncomprehend. From the rich store of his own imagination, and the treasury\r\nof deep feeling in his breast, he poured forth illustrations that\r\nbrightened as if with sunshine every sensation which had been dark and\r\nmysterious in her bosom before; and ere they turned their steps back\r\ntowards the house, Emily believed--nay, she felt; and that is much\r\nmore--that without knowing it, she had loved him long.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThis must be a chapter of rapid action, comprising in its brief space\r\nthe events of many months--events which might not much interest the\r\nreader in minute detail, but which produced important results to all the\r\npersons concerned, and drew on the coming catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe news that Mr. Marlow was about to be married to Emily, the beautiful\r\nheiress of Sir Philip Hastings, spread far and wide over the country;\r\nand if joy and satisfaction reigned in the breasts of three persons in\r\nEmily's dwelling, discontent and annoyance were felt more and more\r\nstrongly every hour by Lady Hastings. A Duke, she thought, would not\r\nhave been too high a match for her daughter, with all the large estates\r\nshe was to inherit; and the idea of her marrying a simple commoner was\r\nin itself very bitter. She was not a woman to bear a disappointment\r\ngracefully; and Emily soon had the pain of discovering that her\r\nengagement to Marlow was much disapproved by her mother. She consoled\r\nherself, however, by the full approval of her father, who was somewhat\r\nmore than satisfied.\r\n\r\nSir Philip for his part, considering his daughter's youth, required that\r\nthe marriage should be delayed at least two years, and, in his\r\ntheoretical way, he soon built up a scheme, which was not quite so\r\nsuccessful as he could have wished. Marlow's character was, in most\r\nrespects, one after his own heart; but as I have shown, he had thought\r\nfrom the first, that there were weak points in it,--or rather points\r\nrendered weak by faults of education and much mingling with the world.\r\nHe wanted, in short, some of that firmness--may I not say hardness of\r\nthe old Roman, which Sir Philip so peculiarly admired; and the scheme\r\nnow was, to re-educate Marlow, if I may use the term, during the next\r\ntwo years, to mould him in short after Sir Philip's own idea of\r\nperfection. How this succeeded, or failed, we shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to show.\r\n\r\nTidings of Emily's engagement were communicated to Mrs. Hazleton, first\r\nby rumor, and immediately after by more certain information in a letter\r\nfrom Lady Hastings. I will not dwell upon the effect produced in her. I\r\nwill not lift up the curtain with which she covered her own breast, and\r\nshow all the dark and terrible war of passions within. For three days\r\nMrs. Hazleton was really ill, remained shut up in her room, had the\r\nwindows darkened, admitted no one but the maid and the physician; and\r\nwell for her was it, perhaps, that the bitter anguish she endured\r\noverpowered her corporeal powers, and forced seclusion upon her. During\r\nthose three days she could not have concealed her feelings from all eyes\r\nhad she been forced to mingle with society; but in her sickness she had\r\ntime for thought--space to fight the battle in, and she came forth\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nWhen she at length appeared in her own drawing-room no one could have\r\nimagined that the illness was of the heart. She was a little paler than\r\nbefore, there was a soft and pleasing languor about her carriage, but\r\nshe was, to all appearance, as calm and cheerful as ever.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she thought it better to go to London for a short time. She\r\ndid not yet dare to meet Emily Hastings. She feared _herself_.\r\n\r\nYet the letter of Lady Hastings was a treasure to her, for it gave her\r\nhopes of vengeance. In it the mother showed but too strongly her dislike\r\nof her daughter's choice, and Mrs. Hazleton resolved to cultivate the\r\nfriendship of Lady Hastings, whom she had always despised, and to use\r\nher weakness for her own purposes.\r\n\r\nShe was destined, moreover, to have other sources of consolation, and\r\nthat more rapidly than she expected. It was shortly before her return to\r\nthe country that the trial of Tom Cutter took place; and not long after\r\nshe came back that he was executed. Many persons at the trial had\r\nremarked the effect which some parts of the evidence had produced on Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings. He was not skilful in concealing the emotions that he\r\nfelt, and although it was sometimes difficult, from the peculiarities of\r\nhis character, to discover what was their precise nature, they always\r\nleft some trace by which it might be seen that he was greatly moved.\r\n\r\nInformation of the facts was given to Mrs. Hazleton by Shanks the\r\nattorney, and young John Ayliffe, who dwelt with pleasure upon the pain\r\nhis successful artifice had inflicted; and Mrs. Hazleton was well\r\npleased too.\r\n\r\nBut the wound was deeper than they thought. It was like that produced by\r\nthe bite of a snake--insignificant in itself, but carrying poison into\r\nevery vein.\r\n\r\nCould his child deceive him? Sir Philip Hastings asked himself. Could\r\nEmily have long known this vulgar youth--gone secretly down to see him\r\nat a distant cottage--conferred with him unknown to either father or\r\nmother? It seemed monstrous to suppose such a thing; and yet what could\r\nhe believe? She had never named John Ayliffe since her return from Mrs.\r\nHazleton's; and yet it was certain from Marlow's own account, that she\r\nhad seen him there. Did not that show that she was desirous of\r\nconcealing the acquaintance from her parents?\r\n\r\nSir Philip had asked no questions, leaving her to speak if she thought\r\nfit. He was now sorry for it, and resolved to inquire; as the fact of\r\nher having seen the young man, for whom he felt an inexpressible\r\ndislike, had been openly mentioned in a court of justice. But as he rode\r\nhome he began to argue on the other side of the question. The man who\r\nhad made the assertion was a notorious liar--a convicted felon. Besides,\r\nhe knew him to be malicious; he had twice before thrown out insinuations\r\nwhich Sir Philip believed to be baseless, and could only be intended to\r\nproduce uneasiness. Might not these last words of his be traced to the\r\nsame motive? He would inquire in the first place, he thought, what was\r\nthe connection between the convict and John Ayliffe, and stopping on the\r\nway for that purpose, he soon satisfied himself that the two were boon\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his own dwelling, he found Emily seated by Marlow in one\r\nof her brightest, happiest moods. There was frank candor, graceful\r\ninnocence, bright open-hearted truth in every look and every word. It\r\nwas impossible to doubt her; and Sir Philip cast the suspicion from him,\r\nbut, alas! not for ever. They would return from time to time to grieve\r\nand perplex him; and he would often brood for hours over his daughter's\r\ncharacter, puzzling himself more and more. Yet he would not say a\r\nword--he blamed himself for even thinking of the matter; and he would\r\nnot show a suspicion. Yet he continued to think and to doubt, while poor\r\nunconscious Emily would have been ready, if asked, to solve the whole\r\nmystery in a moment. She had been silent from an unwillingness to begin\r\na painful subject herself; and though she had yielded no assent to Mrs.\r\nHazleton's arguments, they had made her doubt whether she ought to\r\nmention, unquestioned, John Ayliffe's proposal and conduct. She had made\r\nup her mind to tell all, if her father showed the slightest desire to\r\nknow any thing regarding her late visit; but there was something in the\r\neffects which that visit had produced on her mind, which she could not\r\nexplain to herself.\r\n\r\nWhy did she love Mrs. Hazleton less? Why had she lost so greatly her\r\nesteem for her? What had that lady done or said which justified so great\r\na change of feeling towards her? Emily could not tell. She could fix\r\nupon no word, no act, she could entirely blame--but yet there had been a\r\ngeneral tone in her whole demeanor which had opened the poor girl's eyes\r\ntoo much. She puzzled herself sadly with her own thoughts; and probably\r\nwould have fallen into more than one of her deep self-absorbed reveries,\r\nhad not sweet new feelings, Marlow's frequent presence, kept her awake\r\nto a brighter, happier world of thought.\r\n\r\nShe was indeed very happy; and, could she have seen her mother look\r\nbrighter and smile upon her, she would have been perfectly so. Her\r\nfather's occasional moodiness she did not heed; for he often seemed\r\ngloomy merely from intense thought. Emily had got a key to such dark\r\nreveries in her own heart, and she knew well that they were no true\r\nindications either of discontent or grief, for very often when to the\r\neyes of others she seemed the most dull and melancholy, she was enjoying\r\nintense delight in the activity of her own mind. She judged her father\r\nfrom herself, and held not the slightest idea that any word, deed or\r\nthought of hers had given him the slightest uneasiness.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the various contending feelings and passions which were\r\ngoing on in the little circle on which our eyes are fixed, the course of\r\nlife had gone on with tolerable smoothness as far as Emily and Marlow\r\nwere concerned, for about two months, when, one morning, Sir Philip\r\nHastings received a letter in a hand which he did not know. It reached\r\nhim at the breakfast table, and evidently affected him considerably with\r\nsome sort of emotion. His daughters instantly caught the change of his\r\ncountenance, but Sir Philip did not choose that any one should know he\r\ncould be moved by any thing on earth, and he instantly repressed all\r\nagitation, quietly folded up the letter again, concluded his breakfast,\r\nand then retired to his own study.\r\n\r\nEmily was not deceived, however. There were moments in Sir Philip's life\r\nwhen he was unable to conceal altogether the strong feelings of his\r\nheart under the veil of stoicism--or as he would have termed it--to curb\r\nand restrain them by the power of philosophy. Emily had seen such\r\nmoments, and knew, that whatever were the emotions produced by that\r\nletter, whether of anger or grief or apprehension--her father was\r\ngreatly moved.\r\n\r\nIn his own study, Sir Philip Hastings seated himself, spread the letter\r\nbefore him, and read it over attentively. But now it did not seem to\r\naffect him in the least. He was, in fact, ashamed of the feelings he had\r\nexperienced and partly shown. \"How completely,\" said he to himself,\r\n\"does a false and fictitious system of society render us the mere slaves\r\nof passion, infecting even those who tutor themselves from early years\r\nto resist its influence. Here an insolent young man lays claim to my\r\nname, and my inheritance, and coolly assumes not only that he has a\r\ntitle to do so, but that I know it; and this instead of producing calm\r\ncontempt, makes my heart beat and my blood boil, as if I were the\r\nveriest schoolboy.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was all that Sir Philip stated; but it was something more. It\r\nwas a very artful epistle, drawn up by the joint shrewdness of Mr.\r\nShanks, Mr. John Ayliffe, and Mrs. Hazleton. It concisely stated the\r\nclaims of the young man who signed it, to all the property of the late\r\nSir John Hastings and to the baronetcy. It made no parade of proofs, but\r\nassumed that those in the writer's possession were indisputable, and\r\nalso that Sir Philip Hastings was well aware that John Ayliffe was his\r\nelder brother's legitimate son. The annuity which had been bought for\r\nhimself and his mother was broadly stated to have been the\r\npurchase-money of her silence, negotiated by her father, who had no\r\nmeans to carry on a suit at law. As long as his mother lived, the writer\r\nsaid, he had been silent out of deference to her wishes, but now that\r\nshe was dead in France, he did not feel himself bound to abide by an\r\narrangement which deprived him at once of fortune and station, and which\r\nhad been entered into without his knowledge or consent. He then went on\r\nto call upon Sir Philip Hastings in the coolest terms to give up\r\npossession and acknowledge his right without what the writer called \"the\r\npainful ceremony of a lawsuit;\" and in two parts of the letter allusion\r\nwas made to secret information which the writer had obtained by the kind\r\nconfidence of a friend whom he would not name.\r\n\r\nIt was probably intended to give point to this insinuation at an after\r\nperiod, but if it was aimed at poor Emily, it fell harmless for the\r\ntime, as no one knew better than Sir Philip that she had never been\r\ninformed of any thing which could affect the case in question.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the subject of the annuity was one which he had never mentioned\r\nto any one since the transaction had been completed many years before;\r\nand the name of John Ayliffe had never passed his lips till Marlow\r\nmentioned having seen that young man at Mrs. Hazleton's house.\r\n\r\nWhen he had read the letter, and as soon as he thought he had mastered\r\nthe last struggle of passion, he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the\r\nfew following words:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Philip Hastings has received the letter signed John Ayliffe\r\nHastings. He knows no person of that name, but has heard of a young man\r\nof the name of John Ayliffe. If that person thinks he has any just claim\r\non Sir Philip Hastings, or his estate, he had better pursue it in the\r\nlegal and ordinary course, as Sir Philip Hastings begs to disclaim all\r\nprivate communication with him.\"\r\n\r\nHe addressed the letter to \"Mr. John Ayliffe,\" and sent it to the post.\r\nThis done, he rejoined Marlow and Emily, and to all appearance was more\r\ncheerful and conversable than he had been for many a previous day.\r\nPerhaps it cost him an effort to be cheerful at all, and the effort went\r\na little beyond its mark. Emily was not altogether satisfied, but Lady\r\nHastings, when she came down, which, as usual, was rather late in the\r\nday, remarked how gay her husband was.\r\n\r\nSir Philip said nothing to any one at the time regarding the contents of\r\nthe letter he had received. He consulted no lawyer even, and tried to\r\ntreat the subject with contemptuous forgetfulness; but his was a\r\nbrooding and tenacious mind, and he often thought of the epistle, and\r\nthe menaces it implied, against his own will. Nor could he or any one\r\nconnected with him long remain unattentive or ignorant of the matter,\r\nfor in a few weeks the first steps were taken in a suit against him,\r\nand, spreading from attorneys' offices in every direction, the news of\r\nsuch proceedings travelled far and wide, till the great Hastings case\r\nbecame the talk of the whole country round.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Sir Philip's reply was very speedily shown to Mrs.\r\nHazleton, and that lady triumphed a good deal. Sir Philip was now in the\r\nsame position with John Ayliffe, she thought, that she had been in some\r\ntime before with Mr. Marlow; and already he began to show, in her\r\nopinion, a disposition to treat the case very differently in his own\r\ninstance and in hers.\r\n\r\nThere he had strongly supported private negotiation; here he rejected it\r\naltogether; and she chose to forget that circumstances, though broadly\r\nthe same, were in detail very different.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" she said to herself, \"we shall see whether, when the\r\nproofs are brought forward, he will act with that rigid sense of\r\njustice, which he assumed here.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first processes had been issued, however, and common rumor\r\njustified a knowledge of the transaction, without private information,\r\nMrs. Hazleton set out at once to visit \"poor dear Lady Hastings,\" and\r\ncondole with her on the probable loss of fortune. How pleasant it is to\r\ncondole with friends on such occasions. What an accession of importance\r\nwe get in our own eyes, especially if the poor people we comfort have\r\nbeen a little bit above us in the world.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Hazleton had higher objects in view; she wanted no accession of\r\nimportance. She was quite satisfied with her own position in society.\r\nShe sought to see and prompt Lady Hastings--to sow dissension where she\r\nknew there must already be trouble; and she found Sir Philip's wife just\r\nin the fit frame of mind for her purpose. Sir Philip himself and Emily\r\nhad ridden out together; and though Mrs. Hazleton would willingly have\r\nfound an opportunity of giving Sir Philip a sly friendly kick, and of\r\njust reminding him of his doctrines announced in the case between\r\nherself and Mr. Marlow, she was not sorry to have Lady Hastings alone\r\nfor an hour or two. They remained long in conference, and I need not\r\ndetail all that passed. Lady Hastings poured forth all her grief and\r\nindignation at Emily's engagement to Mr. Marlow, and Mrs. Hazleton did\r\nnothing to diminish either. She agreed that it was a very unequal match,\r\nthat Emily with her beauty and talents, and even with her mother's\r\nfortune alone, might well marry into the highest family of the land.\r\nNay, she said, could the match be broken off, she might still take her\r\nrank among the peeresses. She did not advise, indeed, actual resistance\r\non the part of her friend; she feared Lady Hastings' discretion; but she\r\ninsinuated that a mother and a wife by unwavering and constant\r\nopposition, often obtained her own way, even in very difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour Mrs. Hazleton was Lady Hastings' best friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL REVELATION.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED B.

GEORGES.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 70._\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE ENTERTAINMENT.\r\n\r\nThe name of Count Monte-Leone produced great sensation in the numerous\r\nassemblage. The adventures of the Count and the report of his trial had\r\nbeen published in all the Parisian papers, and in the eyes of some he\r\nwas a lucky criminal, and of others a victim and a martyr to his\r\nopinions, whom God alone had preserved. The women especially were\r\ninterested in the hero of this judicial drama, on account of the\r\nexaggerated representations of his personal attractions. Received with\r\ngeneral curiosity, which, however, he did not seem to notice, and\r\ncrossing the rooms with his usual dignified air, Monte-Leone approached\r\nthe Duchess of Palma and expressed his gratitude for her kindness in\r\nincluding him among her guests. The Duchess recognized the Count\r\npolitely, and replied to him with a few meaningless phrases. She then\r\nleft him to meet the young Marquise de Maulear, who came in leaning on\r\nthe arm of her father, the old Prince. The Prince knew the Neapolitan\r\nAmbassador, whom he had often seen with the Duchess. He had been one of\r\nthe first to visit the Duchess of Palma. A man of intelligence and\r\ndevotion to pleasure, he thought he did not at all derogate from his\r\ndignity by civility to a young and beautiful woman, who bore so nobly\r\nthe name which was conferred on her by love and hymen.\r\n\r\n\"Duchess,\" said the Prince, presenting Aminta, \"you have often\r\nquestioned me about my daughter-in-law, and know what I told you. I am,\r\nI confess, proud for you to be able now to judge for yourself.\" In the\r\n_interim_ La Felina had taken in the whole person of Aminta at a single\r\nglance, and the result of this rapid examination exerted a strange\r\ninfluence on her. She grew pale, and her voice trembled, as she told the\r\nPrince that the praises he had bestowed on the Marquise were far less\r\nthan the truth.\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis de Maulear,\" added she, \"is an old acquaintance,\" and\r\nbowing kindly to him, she offered Aminta a seat and then left her, under\r\nthe influence of an emotion which, actress as she was, she could repress\r\nwith great difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Prince sat by his daughter-in-law, and passing in review before her\r\nthe distinguished personages of the room, described them with that\r\nskeptical wit, that courteous irony, of which the nobles of other days\r\nwere so completely the masters. He spoke like the Duke d'Ayer of old,\r\nthat caustic wit, of whom a lady of the court said that she was amazed\r\nthat his tongue was not torn out twenty times a day, so full of pointed\r\nneedles was all he said. Aminta smiled at the pencil sketches of the\r\nPrince, or rather at his dagger blow. Had the old man, however, been\r\ntwenty times as bitter, she would not have found fault with her\r\nfather-in-law, for she knew he was kind and she was grateful to him--one\r\nday we shall know whence these sentiments originated in his mind. The\r\nMarquis de Maulear had left his young wife to speak to his numerous\r\nacquaintances: and while the Prince for Aminta's amusement flayed alive\r\nthe various personages who were led before him by their evil fate, Count\r\nMonte-Leone, who had seen the Ambassador, sought in vain to pierce the\r\ncrowd which surrounded him. The Duke was not in the room when\r\nMonte-Leone was announced. It was then with surprise and almost with\r\nterror that he saw the Count approach him.\r\n\r\n\"I have not had the honor,\" said he, \"to approach your Excellency since\r\nthe visit paid me at the Castle _Del Uovo_. And I am doubly gratified at\r\nbeing able to return it in your hotel amid so splendid a festival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the Duke, seeking to conquer the emotion caused by the\r\nunexpected presence of Monte-Leone, \"I dared not hope that you would\r\nhonor me by accepting my invitation; for you cannot be ignorant that an\r\nAmbassador represents his king. It is then, in some degree, as if we\r\nmeet to-day in the palace of his Majesty Fernando King of Naples: and I\r\nthink I may venture to tell you, in the name of my Sovereign, that if\r\nyour conduct is a token of reconciliation offered by you to his cause,\r\nFernando IV will acknowledge it as cheerfully as I do now.\"\r\n\r\nCount Monte-Leone appreciated the graceful perfidy of the language of\r\nthe Duke, and was ready to curse the secret motive which had led him to\r\nthe Embassy. His eyes, however, turned, almost contrary to his wishes,\r\nto the other side of the room, and there he seemed to find something to\r\nsustain him. He replied to the Duke as naturally as possible, that in\r\ncoming to his house, he had remembered only the urbanity of his host and\r\nhis frankness, being aware that the Duke would never convert a mere\r\nvisit of pleasure into a political question.\r\n\r\nThe Duke bit his lips when he heard this evasive answer, and saw that he\r\nhad met his equal in diplomacy. A young man then approached and passed\r\nhis arm into that of Monte-Leone's, thus putting an end to this annoying\r\ninterview. This young man had an eloquent and _distingué_ air, and\r\nhandsome features, though they were delicate and betokened but feeble\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my dear Duke,\" said the new comer to the Ambassador, \"that\r\none must have a very perfect character, and be invited to a very\r\ncharming ball, to come as I do to your house, after the manner we parted\r\neighteen months ago at Naples. Listen!--one goes for health-sake to\r\nNaples to pass the winter, to enjoy the Carnival in peace. After one or\r\ntwo intrigues with beautiful women having dark eyes, not, however,\r\ncomparable with those of the Duchess of Palma, one fine night in the\r\nmiddle of a Pulcinello supper, you send us in place of a dessert a\r\ncompany of black-looking _sbirri_, who rush like vultures upon us, and\r\nrust with dirty hands our Venetian daggers which they wrest from us.\r\nTwelve to three, they then separate Taddeo, Von Apsbury and myself, and\r\nplacing us in rickety carriages, take one of us to prison, another to\r\nthe frontier, and hurry me on board a miserable little vessel, from\r\nwhich they tumble me like a package of damaged goods on the _quai_ of\r\nMarseilles. I had expected to make the tour of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vicompte,\" said the Duke, with a smile, \"the air of Italy was not\r\nhealthy for you. Very excellent physicians told me your life was unsafe\r\nin that country, and that you should leave it as soon as possible. So\r\ncomplain to the faculty, but thank me for having followed their\r\ndirections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what mistakes,\" said the young man, \"people make. I have always\r\nheard that the climate of Naples was excellent for the chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Duke, \"but it is bad for the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that I know something,\" said Monte-Leone, bowing to the Duke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, suppose it is,\" continued d'Harcourt, who wished at any\r\nprice to avenge himself on the _sbirri_ of his Excellency, in the person\r\nof the Duke himself. \"It may be the climate exaggerates and sometimes\r\ndestroys the head, but it is excellent for the heart--a suffering\r\nheart--a heart which is attacked is easily cured in Naples. True, the\r\nremedies are sometimes priceless, but patients in desperate cases do not\r\nhesitate on that account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope, Count,\" said the Duke, who would not understand the allusion of\r\nthe young man to his marriage, \"that the climate of Paris suits you\r\nbetter than that of Naples. Besides, the Duc d'Harcourt, your father,\r\nthat most influential nobleman, will prevent you henceforth from\r\nendangering an existence you held too cheaply in Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily,\" said D'Harcourt, with a smile, \"your Excellency watched over\r\nme, and it is no slight honor to have as a physician the minister of\r\npolice of a kingdom. Excuse me, however,\" added he to the Duke, \"I hear\r\nthe prelude of Collinet's orchestra, and I have a family duty to fulfil:\r\nmy sister Mary has promised to dance this contradance with me, and I\r\nmust humor the whim of a spoiled child.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild young man hurried to take his sister's arm, and to get into\r\nplace with her. Marie d'Harcourt, René's sister, was a charming girl,\r\nwith blonde hair and a rosy complexion, fair and lithe as a northern\r\nelf. The blue veins were visible beneath her transparent skin, so fair\r\nthat one might often have fancied the blood was about to come gushing\r\nthrough it. The Duke d'Harcourt had lost two of his sons of that\r\nterrible pulmonary disease against which medicine, alas, is powerless.\r\nThe distress of the father was intense, for two of the scions of this\r\nfamily had been cut off by death; and of the five offshoots from the\r\nfamily tree, but two remained. All his love was therefore centred in\r\nRené, now his only son, and in Marie, the young girl of whom we have\r\njust spoken. From a sentiment of tender respect, the Duke had not\r\npermitted his last son to assume the title of those he had lost, and\r\nRené continued to be called the Vicompte d'Harcourt. There were already\r\napparent sad indications that René would become a prey to the monster\r\nwhich had devoured his two brothers: Marie, a few years younger, gave\r\nher father great uneasiness, on account of the excessive delicacy of her\r\nconstitution and organization. All Paris had participated in the grief\r\nof the Duke d'Harcourt; for all Paris respected him. Rich, kind, and\r\nbenevolent, in an enlightened manner, and within the bounds of reason,\r\nrejecting all social Utopias, popular as they might make all who\r\nsustained them, the Duke d'Harcourt was a Christian philanthropist, that\r\nis to say, a charitable man. Charity is the holiest and purest of\r\nearthly virtues, and that in which this patriarch indulged shunned noise\r\nand renown. He did not wait until misfortune came to him to soothe it,\r\nbut sought it out. When this second providence was known to those whom\r\nhe aided, the Duke imposed secrecy on them as a reward for all he had\r\ndone. He was, so to say, an impersonation of French honor, and the\r\narbiter of all the differences which arose between the members of the\r\ngreat aristocratic families of France. His word was law, and his\r\ndecisions sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Maulear had determined to marry his son to the daughter of\r\nthis noble old man, and had been forced by the Marquis's marriage to\r\nabandon the plan. The Duke still remained the friend of the Prince,\r\nthough he had not unfrequently blamed his somewhat lax principles.\r\nWhenever he discovered the Prince in any peccadillo, he used to say,\r\n\"Well, we must be lenient to youth.\" Now, the Prince de Maulear was a\r\nyoung man of seventy. The beauty of Aminta, her extreme paleness alone,\r\nwould have sufficed to fix attention, and created a very revolution in\r\nthe saloons of the Embassy. The Duchess of Palma did not produce her\r\nordinary effect. The animation she experienced in the beginning of the\r\nevening gradually left her, and the sadness under which she had\r\npreviously suffered, but which she had thrown off during the early hours\r\nof the entertainment, began again to take possession of her features and\r\nperson. One man alone remarked the Duchess, for he had never lost sight\r\nof her. Leaning against the door of the boudoir, his eye followed her\r\nwherever she went, and appeared to sympathize with all the constraint\r\ninflicted on her as mistress of the house. When, however, the Duchess\r\nthought she had paid sufficient personal attention, and was satisfied\r\nthat the pleasures of the evening would be sustained without her, the\r\nman who examined her with such care, saw her come towards the boudoir\r\nwhere he was. He went in without being seen by her, and yielding to one\r\nof those promptings which a man in his cooler moments would resist, went\r\nbehind a drapery which covered a door leading into a gallery of\r\npictures, and waited motionless. The Duchess of Palma entered the\r\nboudoir, and assuring herself by a glance that she was alone, fell\r\nrather than sat on a divan, and suffered two streams of tears to flow\r\nfrom her eyes. \"I was strangling,\" said she. \"I would die a thousand\r\ndeaths. My cruel experiment has succeeded. _He loves her yet_--I am sure\r\nof it. For her sake he came to this entertainment, to which he would not\r\nhave come for mine. He would have made an excuse of his old difficulties\r\nwith the Duke, of his political position. I would have believed him, and\r\nhave sacrificed my wish to see him to propriety and his honor. He never\r\nceases to look at her. He thinks of her alone. He is busied with her\r\nalone, yet he has no look, no thought for me.\" The Duchess began to weep\r\nagain. Steps were heard in the gallery--the drapery at the door was\r\nagitated. \"Oh, my God!\" said the Duchess, \"if met with here, and in this\r\ncondition, what shall I do and say!\" The steps approached. Hurrying then\r\nto one of the outlets of the boudoir, she opened it hastily, and went\r\ninto the garden. The steps the Duchess had heard were those of two\r\npersons, who, after having been the rounds of the room, were about to go\r\ninto the picture-gallery. The two persons were René d'Harcourt and Count\r\nMonte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah ha!\" said the Count, \"what the devil is Taddeo doing there against\r\nthe drapery, there like a jealous Spaniard at a corner of Seville,\r\nlistening to a serenade given by his rival?\"\r\n\r\n\"True! true!\" replied d'Harcourt, \"but I think the serenade has been\r\ngiven, for his features express the most malevolent expression.\"\r\n\r\nThe emotion of Taddeo was so violent when he heard the words of the\r\nDuchess, that he had not strength to leave. He, however, restrained\r\nhimself, and listened to the raillery of his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Like yourselves,\" said he, with a quivering voice, \"I was in search of\r\nfresh air, for it is fearfully warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not get sick here,\" said d'Harcourt, \"for Doctor Matheus is not here\r\nto cure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence,\" said Taddeo, changing his expression at once, \"how imprudent\r\nyou are to pronounce his name.\"\r\n\r\nAll three of them entered the boudoir.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said d'Harcourt, \"my tongue is always quicker than my mind. I\r\nwill however try and make them keep time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When will there be a consultation?\" asked Taddeo, trying to be calm.\r\n\r\n\"Eight days hence!\"\r\n\r\n\"At what hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Midnight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there many patients?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than ever,\" said the Count, \"and the poor devils are anxious as\r\npossible to be cured!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said d'Harcourt, \"the practice of the Doctor increases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every day. He will soon be unable to turn around.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not make me uneasy,\" said d'Harcourt, \"our Doctor is a\r\nskilful man, a great philosopher, and fully acquainted with the new\r\nmedicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very new;--he treats the mind, rather than the body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is its very essence,\" replied the Vicompte, \"and I know some\r\nwonderful cures of his--so wonderful, indeed, that on the other day I\r\npresented him to my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Duke?\" said Monte-Leone,--\"introduce Doctor Matheus to the Duke\r\nd'Harcourt?\" Then in a low voice he continued, \"Why did you present him\r\nto the Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a reason which was important and very dear to my heart. My young\r\nsister was suffering; my father, who consulted in behalf of my brothers\r\nthe most eminent practitioners of Paris, lost all confidence in the\r\nfaculty when he lost his sons. He did not know whom to consult about his\r\ndaughter; I spoke to him of Matheus, and told him several wonderful\r\ncures he had effected, and the Duke became very anxious to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did the stern Matheus consent to go to your father's house?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was anxious to do so, and as his house is not far from ours, I in a\r\nfew minutes was able to introduce him into the patient's room; and would\r\nyou believe it, a few of the simplest remedies possible exerted a great\r\neffect. The agitation of my sister was calmed--her cough arrested--and\r\nthis evening you see her dancing and waltzing, pretty and gay as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the three friends was soon interrupted by the\r\nentrance of two other of the personages of our story. The Prince de\r\nMaulear entered with the _Marquise_ on his arm, seeking in this retired\r\nspot some repose from the fatigues of the ball, and a less heated air\r\nthan that of the ball-rooms. Aminta leaned heavily on the arm of the\r\nPrince when she saw Monte-Leone thus unexpectedly. She had observed him\r\nduring the evening, and in the course of the winter they had more than\r\nonce met together. The Count, however, had never referred to their\r\nparting at Sorrento. Far from seeking her out, Monte-Leone seemed to\r\navoid her. Satisfied with saluting her respectfully as often as they\r\nmet, the Count used always to leave her. This reserved and proper\r\nconduct was sufficiently explained by the old rivalry of the Marquis de\r\nMaulear and the Count. Recollection of this rivalry, without doubt,\r\ncaused in Aminta's mind the great emotion she always felt when in the\r\npresence of Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" said the Prince, when he saw the Count, \"are you here, my dear\r\ncolleague? This chance delights me. My daughter,\" said he to the young\r\nMarquise, \"let me introduce to you the Count Monte-Leone, a great\r\ntraveller, to whom I am indebted for the best chapter of my Italian\r\nvoyages; all action, I will read it to you one of these days! Ah! but\r\nfor the Count, I would never have perfected it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said Monte-Leone, with a low bow, \"I have the honor of the\r\n_Marquise_'s acquaintance; and Signora Rovero, her mother, deigned\r\nsometimes to receive me at her house before the marriage of the Marquis\r\nde Maulear and Madame--\"\r\n\r\nThe Count as he spoke felt as if his heart would burst. The Prince,\r\nhowever, did not perceive it.\r\n\r\n\"You know my daughter,\" said the Count, \"yes, you have not called on\r\nher, you did not seek to see me, who am so glad to see you. This is bad,\r\nCount--you will not, however, remain away any longer, and I will not\r\nquit you until you promise me a speedy visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know if I should,\" said the Count, with a hesitation which was\r\nnot natural to him--and looking timidly at Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be happy to receive the Count; but you know, Monsieur, I\r\nreceive no one without the consent of the Marquis--\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Marquis,\" said the Prince, \"will be delighted to receive so\r\ncharming a gentleman and erudite a traveller as Count Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I also know M. de Maulear,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! then you know every one,\" said the old man. \"Why then be so\r\nceremonious? People of our rank easily understand each other. Besides,\r\nif the invitation of my son is all you need, here he comes to speak for\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nD'Harcourt and Taddeo, especially the latter, who knew how devotedly\r\nMonte-Leone had loved Aminta, participated in the embarrassment of the\r\nscene. Aminta trembled. \"Ah! you here at last, Monsieur,\" said the\r\nPrince to his son, as he appeared at the door of the boudoir. \"You are a\r\nlucky fellow to have your father as your wife's _cavalier servente_, for\r\nyou have not been near her during the whole evening.\" The Marquis turned\r\npale, and said with agitation, \"Excuse me, sir, but I met some old\r\nfriends who kept possession of me all the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Prince, \"_apropo_ of old friends--or old acquaintances,\r\nif you will, here is one of yours--the Count Monte-Leone, who wants only\r\nfor a word from your mouth to renew his acquaintance and visit me.\"\r\n\r\nHenri looked at Monte-Leone, whom he had not seen before.\r\n\r\nWithout trouble, without agitation, or any apparent effort, he said,\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone will always be welcome whenever he pleases to visit\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nAminta cast a glance full of surprise, grief, and reproach on the\r\nMarquis, and a secret voice repeated in her very heart:--\"He is no\r\nlonger jealous, and therefore does not love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Prince to his son, and turning to Monte-Leone, and\r\ngiving him his hand, he said, \"We shall meet again, my dear colleague.\"\r\nHe continued, \"We will talk of our travels, and especially of the\r\nchapter of Ceprano.\"\r\n\r\nThen taking the arm of Aminta, who could scarcely support herself, he\r\nreturned to the ball-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--JOURNAL OF A HEART.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment continued, and the joyous sounds of the orchestra\r\nreached the very extremity of the garden of the Hotel, where the Duchess\r\nof Palma had taken refuge to conceal her tears from all observers. She\r\nheard a faint noise beneath a neighboring hedge, and looking towards it,\r\nsaw Taddeo gazing at her with an expression of great grief.\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the young man, \"Taddeo, who pities and suffers with you\r\nbecause he knows all and suffers all that unappreciated love can inflict\r\non the heart--\"\r\n\r\nThis was said with an expression of deep pity.\r\n\r\n\"Who has told you,\" said the Duchess proudly, \"that I suffered as you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your tears,\" said Taddeo, \"and the memory of the past. Better still,\r\nyourself. The words you uttered not long ago in the boudoir, and which\r\nby chance I heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" replied the Duchess with indignation, \"do not attribute to\r\nchance what you owe to ignoble curiosity. To watch a woman--to surprise\r\nthe secrets of her heart, is infamous, and betrays the hospitality\r\nextended to you. It shows a want of respect for me, and absence of honor\r\nin yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signora, my only excuse is my ardent passion, which has lasted in spite\r\nof time and contempt. I have no motive for my fault but my sad interest\r\nin your suffering, the cruel progress of which I have read on your\r\nfeatures since the commencement of the entertainment;--that is all----\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Signor, what have I said? What words have I uttered?\" said the\r\nDuchess, every feature being instinct with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, alas! that my heart has not long been aware of. He that you\r\nloved, you love still, and his coldness and insensibility for your\r\ndevotion, makes you lament his ingratitude and indifference.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess seemed, as it were, relieved of an enormous burden which\r\noppressed her. She breathed more freely and murmured these words with a\r\nburst of gratitude to God who had preserved her--\"He knows nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said she, giving him her hand, \"I pardon you, for I am myself\r\nguilty, very guilty in still preserving my old sentiments in the face of\r\nmy new obligations, voluntarily contracted. I have, I am certain, lost\r\nthe right to reproach you with a fault, which passion induced you to\r\ncommit, while I commit one far greater. For pity's sake forget what you\r\nhave heard, and to ask me to explain it would be an offence. Pity me in\r\nyour heart. Ah! pity me, for I am most unfortunate.\" Then drying her\r\neyes, she continued, \"No more of this--be a friend to me as you promised\r\nsix months ago, when we came to Paris. On this condition alone you know\r\nthat I permitted you to see me. Now give me your arm, and let us return\r\nto the ball-room, whence, probably, our absence has been remarked.\" They\r\nwalked in silence down the alley which led to the ball-room.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after, all was calm and silent where every thing had been gay\r\nand brilliant. The lights were out, and the darkness of night replaced\r\nthe thousand lamps which a few minutes before were seen to glitter\r\nwithin the palace windows. But one person in all the Hotel of the Duke\r\nof Palma was awake. A woman sat alone, in a room of rare elegance, still\r\nwearing her ball attire, but with her hair dishevelled and her heart\r\ncrushed. Her eyes were fixed and dry, and yet red with the tears she had\r\nshed. She was in all the brilliancy of youth and beauty, but which was\r\nalready defaced somewhat, by the iron claws of sorrow, which by\r\nsleepless nights and the ravages of jealousy seemed resolved yet more to\r\nlacerate her. With her head resting on her hands, beautiful and touching\r\nas Canova's Magdalen, she looked with sorrow over the papers which lay\r\nstrewn on a rich ebony desk before her. A lamp, the upper portion of\r\nwhich was shrouded in blue tulle, cast a pale and sad light over her\r\nbrow. Her fine white hand rested on the papers which she seemed afraid\r\nto touch. \"No,\" said she, \"it is impossible; all that these contain are\r\nbut falsehoods. No, this journal of my heart, written by myself, day by\r\nday, cannot be a romance created by the imagination in its delirium. No!\r\nall I wrote there was true. I felt the joys and bitternesses, yet it now\r\nseems to me a dream. A dream! can it be a dream?\"\r\n\r\nTaking up the papers convulsively she read as follows:--\"It is he. I\r\nhave seen him again and free. I thought that he, like myself, had\r\ncontracted a life-long obligation. Is this joy or grief? The ties he was\r\nabout to form, the ties the mere thought of which caused me a terrible\r\nanguish, were imposed on me by myself. Oh my God! what have I done? What\r\nperfidious demon inspired me when I yielded to another than to him the\r\n_right_ to love me? When I promised a love I knew could be given to no\r\nother than to him? Why on the day of that fatal marriage did I see him\r\nonly when I was about to leave the church? I would have broken off had I\r\nstood at the foot of the altar--I would have told him who was about to\r\ngive me his name--ask me not to perjure myself! do not ask me to pledge\r\nyou a faith I cannot keep! my heart, my soul, my love are his. I\r\nthought, alas! because he was not free that I too might cease to be. I\r\nfancied my agony to be power, my spite to be courage. When, however, I\r\nsaw him pale and sombre, leaning against the door of the temple, I felt\r\nthe coldness of death take possession of me, and I doubted long after\r\nthat sad day, if I had seen a shadow, if some hallucinations of my\r\nsenses had not evoked a phantom of my vanished love, to inspire me with\r\neternal regret. Yet HE it was! HE it was! and when at the risk of my\r\nvery life I would have flown towards that man, I was forced to follow\r\nanother.\" The poor woman paused; for a mist obscured her sight, a\r\ndistillation of burning tears. She resumed her task:--\"I am a Duchess\r\nbut of what value is that vain title which I sought, as an ægis against\r\nmemory, to me? Have I found it such? For a long time, I thought so. I\r\nshould, however, never have seen him again. I should have passed no\r\nhappy days near him, and have been ignorant of the delirium and\r\nintoxication of his presence, which I never can forget. I had been the\r\nwife of the Duke of Palma six months, when a mission of the King of\r\nNaples forced him to leave me at a villa on the _Lago di Como_, while he\r\nwent in a foreign country to discharge the duties his monarch had\r\nimposed on him. I scarcely dared to confess to myself, in spite of the\r\nkindness of the Duke, how I was delighted during his absence, for it\r\ngave me a liberty of mind and thought which was absolutely necessary to\r\nmy heart. Resolved to discharge all my duties, I lived, or rather\r\nvegetated, in this existence, so unoccupied and objectless as all\r\nmarriages contracted without love must be. Amid, however, the dead calm\r\nof a marriage contracted without love, there glittered sometimes a burst\r\nof passion repressed, but alas! not stifled. Dark passions filled my\r\nbosom, and I felt the poison of regret. I found myself often longing for\r\nmy independence, which, however, would not have contributed to my\r\nhappiness, but would at least have permitted me to indulge in my secret\r\nsorrow. My temporary solitude, therefore, became precious to me, for I\r\nwas about to abandon myself to sadness without annoying any one, and\r\nwithout exciting a curiosity which it was impossible for me to satisfy.\r\nWhen one evening I had been wandering alone on the banks of the lake, I\r\nwas terrified by a terrible scene on the water. At a great distance a\r\nman made every effort to approach the shore--for his boat was evidently\r\nsinking beneath him. Some opening, beyond doubt, permitted the water to\r\npenetrate, and his danger became every moment more imminent. I was too\r\nfar from the villa to send him any assistance, and as a secret\r\npresentiment was joined to the horror and pity caused by the spectacle,\r\nI felt the greatest anxiety about the stranger. The night was near, and\r\nthe sky became darker every moment. By the flashes of lights here and\r\nthere, I saw the bark almost sinking, and ere long, it was entirely\r\ngone--and the tranquil waves of the lake, calm as they are wont to be,\r\nrolled over it. My strength deserted me, and almost in a fainting\r\ncondition, I fell on the strand. I did not absolutely lose\r\nconsciousness; for far in the distance I heard the sound of sudden blows\r\non the water, for which at the time I could not account. The noise\r\napproached, and grew every moment more distinct. I then heard the sound,\r\nas it were, of a body falling on the sand, accompanied by a painful cry.\r\nI heard no more. Soon I saw the light of the torches of my servants, who\r\nbeing uneasy, had come to look for me. They found me, and also a half\r\ninanimate body, dripping with water. It was doubtless the person whose\r\nboat had foundered in the water, and I ordered him to be taken to the\r\nvilla and carefully attended to. It was late, and I returned. A few\r\nhours had passed since the event, and I was sitting alone at the piano.\r\nFancy bore me back to my last appearance at San-Carlo, where a mad and\r\ninfatuated public had bade me so enthusiastic an adieu. While all that\r\ncrowd had eyes, for him alone I wished to be beautiful--for him alone to\r\nbe worthy of the admiration I excited. Dreaming this, my fingers run\r\nover the keys, and joining my voice to the instrument, I sang almost\r\nunconsciously that touching air in which I had been so much applauded.\r\nMy song was at first low and half-whispered, but gradually increased in\r\npower. I thought I spoke to him, and that his eyes were fixed on mine.\r\nAt last I paused, pale with surprise, joy and terror. In the glass\r\nbefore me I saw Count Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\nThe memory of this event was so distinct and exciting, that the Duchess\r\npaused and looked around for the apparition which had caused her such\r\nkeen emotion. Then, as if she delighted to place the knife in the wound,\r\nshe took up the manuscript, and continued:--\r\n\r\n\"'Excuse me, Madame,' said the Count, 'for having thus introduced myself\r\ninto your house; but I am come to thank you for the cares I have\r\nreceived in your name.'\r\n\r\n\"'You--you here?' said I, yet doubting my eyes. 'Is it a dream or\r\nvision? Speak, speak once more, that, I may be sure I do not dream.'\r\n\r\n\"'Felina,' said he, in a tone full of melancholy, 'I know not why our\r\nfate should thus constantly bring us together. But one might think, that\r\nstill faithful to your old oath, you continue the providence you used to\r\nbe to me. When a few months since, after the wreck of all my hopes of\r\nhappiness, after having been misconceived by those for whom I had done\r\nso much, when sad and desperate, I cursed my egotistical and cold\r\ncareer, you appeared to me in the Church of Ferentino and cast on me, in\r\nthe face of your marriage vows, one of those deep-loving looks which\r\ncheer the heart and attach it to life. And when on the lake, exhausted\r\nwith fatigue and ready to yield under the struggle necessary to avert my\r\nthreatened fate, you again came to my relief. You see, then,' continued\r\nhe, smiling sadly, 'that in becoming the good angel of the Duke of\r\nPalma, you do not cease to be mine.'\r\n\r\n\"Never had the Count spoken thus to me. He had always been cold, and\r\nseemed most unwillingly to acknowledge the services I had rendered him.\r\nI had never received an affectionate word from his mouth before. He saw\r\nthe trouble he gave me, and taking my hand, said, with a voice full of\r\nsensibility, 'Are you happy?' At this question, it seemed as if my heart\r\nwould break, and I burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"'Felina,' said he, 'why do you weep? what is the meaning of this?'\r\n\r\n\"'Do not question me,' said I. 'Let me keep the cause of those tears a\r\nsecret, for you can neither dry up nor understand them. Tell me though\r\nabout yourself, said I. Tell me of your marriage.'\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone grew pale, and said, 'I am not married, I am free.'\r\n\r\n\"I could not repress a feeling of joy.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' said he, bitterly, 'Do you enjoy my misfortune?'\r\n\r\n\"This word restored me to my _sang-froid_. I became more calm, and\r\nquestioned him. The Count told me all.\r\n\r\n\"For many months, he had travelled and returned to Europe to arrange\r\nsome pecuniary matters previous to his return to France, where he\r\npurposed to remain. Passing by _la Tremezzina_, he learned, indirectly,\r\nthat certain malevolent reports had been circulated in relation to him\r\nby the brothers of the powerful association, of which he had been the\r\nchief. A venta was to meet on the opposite shore of Lake Como. Taking a\r\nrude costume--he had gone thither, for the purpose of protesting against\r\nthe perfidious insinuations of his enemies. Afraid, however, of being\r\nwatched by some agent of his enemies, he resolved to cross the lake\r\nalone and at night. Thus he became so near being lost. The Count wished\r\nto leave me that night, for he was aware of the absence of the Duke of\r\nPalma, and was afraid of compromising me. I, however, retained him for\r\nseveral days in the villa, for the purpose of throwing off the vigilance\r\nof his enemies. Alas! how have I regretted those days, the only happy\r\nones of my life. How rapidly they passed away! The Count knew the\r\nmystery I wished to hide from him. He read it in my soul, the only\r\nthought of which he long had been. He knew why I had married, what tears\r\nand sorrow I had known, and what anguish it had caused me. Touched by\r\nthis vast sacrifice, understanding the extent of my love, I saw the ice\r\nof his heart gradually begin to melt. But as his heart warmed to mine, a\r\nsecret terror took possession of me. Tasting all the joy of seeing arise\r\nin the heart of the Count, sentiments which, when I was free I could not\r\nhave heard without pride and satisfaction, I trembled at the idea of\r\nbeing able to listen to them only with crime. Soon it was I who besought\r\nthe Count to fly--to leave me--to see me no more. Strange, however, is\r\nthe human heart; the passion of Monte-Leone seemed to feed on my\r\nopposition. He forgot the past, he could not realize it to have existed.\r\n\r\n\"Sitting by my side during the long days, beneath the flowery bowers of\r\nthe villa, the Count, as he said, saw through the darkness in which he\r\nhad been enveloped--his eyes recovered their vision, and at last I\r\nappeared to him, for the first time, the most charming, the most\r\nadorable of women. Never was there a more eloquent tenderness than\r\nhis--and to me who lived for him alone--whose image was ever before me,\r\nwho had loved him in spite of his coldness and indifference, almost his\r\ncontempt, to me he used this language of entreaty.... Yet he did so to a\r\nwoman who loved him. A month passed in this cruel contest of love and\r\nduty. The contest was not equal, and passion triumphed. The Count had\r\nleft the villa, but was concealed in the vicinity, and I saw him every\r\nday become more tender and affectionate. One must have suffered as I\r\nhave to understand the intoxication of my happiness. To be loved by him\r\nhad never seemed possible; and to possess this life-dream, to read in\r\nhis looks a passion I alone had experienced hitherto, was a veil, thin\r\nindeed, but this prevented me from discerning how great was my fault. If\r\nit did become known to me, I loved it; for in my delirium I thought that\r\nI gave to this man a heart which belonged to him, and a person of which,\r\nin defiance of his rights, another was possessed. The other though, whom\r\nI doubly injured by this thought, had given me truly, loyally, and\r\nnobly, his heart, his rank, his name. So completely, however, was I led\r\nastray, that I censured the Duke for this very generosity. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, my life of love had its sorrows. The Count would be sad, and in\r\nhis moments of melancholy, forgot my presence, and spoke slightingly on\r\nthe volatility of women and of their caprices. I used to look at him\r\nwith surprise, and seek to discover his secret thoughts. One day it was\r\nrevealed to me.\r\n\r\n\"'When women are young,' said he, 'they suffer themselves to be led away\r\nby brilliant exterior, and by that studied gallantry of which the French\r\nmake such a display.' A few words full of venom escaped him\r\ninvoluntarily in relation to a rival that she whom he _had_ loved\r\npreferred to him. So shocked was I, that I asked him, if ill-humor at\r\nhis repulse alone had led him to my feet. Without knowing how he had\r\ndone so, the Count saw he had wounded me, and by increased care and\r\ntenderness lulled a suspicion which ultimately was to rise in all its\r\npower and agony.\r\n\r\n\"One day, we were to separate. The Count was obliged to go to Naples,\r\nwhere he was impatiently waited for. My despair at this intelligence was\r\nterrible. How could I leave this sweet happiness which had grown around\r\nme in two months! It seemed above my power and ability. Nothing seemed\r\nto influence the Count. I knew him well, and was aware that he never\r\nyielded. I soon ceased to contend, and he left me--not, however, without\r\nthe tenderest oaths of constancy. 'We will soon meet again,' he\r\nremarked, 'and in Paris: in that vast city where mystery is so easy,\r\nand where secret love finds an impenetrable shelter, we will reside--you\r\nstill as beautiful, I devoted as ever.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\"Vain promises,\" said La Felina, crushing the papers in her hands. \"I\r\nwished to read these pages once more. I wrote them after he had gone,\r\nand they are the history of my fleeting happiness. I wished to be\r\nsatisfied that I had been happy. I doubt it sometimes, for during the\r\nthree months the Count has been here, I see him every day resume more\r\nand more his old coldness to me. Formerly, I could reproach myself with\r\nnothing. I had betrayed no one; and he, in his disdain, had violated no\r\npromise. Now, though, he has created eternal remorse and regret. He has\r\nrevived in my heart a flame which was nearly out--yet has nothing but\r\nindifference and contempt for me. He forgets, though, how dangerous it\r\nis to offend an Italian woman. He has forgotten what he read in my\r\nletter to his friend: 'Had I been to the Count but an ordinary woman,\r\nthe charms of whom would have fixed him for a time, but whom he would\r\nrepudiate as he has his other conquests, _I would have killed him_.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--DOCTOR MATHEUS.\r\n\r\nAt the time we write of, there was in _la rue Babylonne_, near the\r\nfaubourg Saint-Germain, an old house, the owner of which was really to\r\nbe pitied. In consequence of a kind of fate which overhung this house,\r\nno room had been occupied for many years, and the persons who went\r\nthither in search of room, terrified at their sombre air, heard,\r\nsubsequently, such stories of what had happened within its walls, took\r\ngood care not to take up their abode there, even if they had given the\r\n_denier-à-Dieu_, an important matter in Paris, and a kind of bargain\r\nbetween the lodger and landlord, made in the presence of the porter, who\r\nis the notary, witness, and depository of the contract. If, however, any\r\nquiet family, led astray by the retirement of the house, established\r\nthemselves in it, the servants soon heard such stories from their\r\nneighbors in No. 15, that they lived in perpetual terror--madame grew\r\npale, and as often as monsieur sang louder than usual, or came in\r\nwithout noise, had nervous attacks. The unfortunate lodgers, menaced by\r\njaundice or some other bilious complaint, in consequence of the repeated\r\nemotions to which they were subjected, were anxious always to go, even\r\nunder the penalty of indemnifying the landlord. The latter saw himself\r\nagain forced to submit to the reign of solitude in the old halls, which\r\nwere gilt and painted _à la Louis XV._, and saw the mildew and dust\r\nagain rest on the windows and cells, as soon as the fires ceased to\r\nburn; not even the presence of a trunk, belonging to a chance sojourner\r\nin this desert isle, relieved the landlord from apprehensions of the\r\nrecurrence of his old calamity. The Crusoe of this desert island had\r\ndeclared that he had rather pay the lodging three, six, or nine-fold,\r\nthan live in such proximity with the miserable ideas which the house\r\nsuggested. True, the Crusoe was an Englishman, predisposed to the\r\n_spleen_, and the sadness of his abode would soon have led him to\r\naugment by a new scene the dramas which had already happened in this\r\nhouse. The landlord, afraid that he would do so, hurried to conclude\r\nmatters as soon as possible with the islander.\r\n\r\nThe following was the reason of the bad repute of No. 13:\r\n\r\n     A man had hung himself there for love. This was a horrid story,\r\n     but it was not the whole drama. Three years after, two very old\r\n     men, who were very rich, and said to be retired merchants, were\r\n     found stifled beneath their mattress, and the criminal was\r\n     never found out. The people of the quartier, however, knew all\r\n     about it, and said who was the murderer. They maintained it was\r\n     the old suicide, the shadow of whom was ill at ease, and had a\r\n     mortal aversion to any one who disagreed with him about a\r\n     suitable and pleasant residence.\r\n\r\nYet for some time No. 13 had looked like all the other houses in the\r\nvicinity. People went in and came out, just as if it had been the\r\ndomicile of no ghost. The knocker on the door was often heard, and when\r\nthe porter opened his door, a little flower-garden was seen, with\r\nvarious horticultural treasures, expanding beneath the spring sun.\r\n\r\nAt length a lodger was found, a very godsend to No. 13, whose lofty\r\nreason was superior to all the fables told of the house, and, by his\r\npresence defended it from the calumny which had been circulated about\r\nit; not by words but deeds, for he lived there, and was neither hung nor\r\nstifled, like the old merchants, who had several very evil disposed\r\nnephews, and who, to say the least, assisted the man that was hung in\r\nprocuring the rich inheritance for them. This house had a large\r\nground-floor, and many handsome rooms on the first story. The second\r\nstory was very expensive, having previously been the _studio_ of a\r\npainter, but which had been appropriated by the new lodger to an object\r\nwhich we will describe by and by. We will not attempt a description of\r\nthis new lodger, but will introduce to our readers one more competent to\r\ndo it. This person is Mlle. Celestine Crepineau, an old maid between\r\nthirty-seven and forty-nine years of age. She was tall and thin, and had\r\nall her life rejoiced at this, for she had a form three fingers in\r\ndiameter. True, a broomstick can be grasped between the thumb and index\r\nfinger, and yet is not very graceful. Let not any one think, though, in\r\nspite of this infantine vanity, that Mlle. Crepineau was of those\r\nvirgins whom the Bible condemns _as foolish about their beauty_. She was\r\na prudent honest-minded girl, the heart of whom if it ever spoke, did so\r\nin such low terms, that no one ever heard it. Mademoiselle Celestine's\r\nvirtue was a proverb. Mothers in all that part of the town spoke of her\r\nas a model of prudence, and fathers pointed her out to their sons as a\r\nwarning against the passions of youth. Without father or mother, from\r\nher very childhood Mlle. Crepeneau had no protector but her god-father,\r\nan old lawyer, who owned No. 13 of Babylonne-street. The worthy lawyer\r\nhad provided for the youth of Mlle. Celestine, and had long intrusted\r\nher with the control of his kitchen: discovering, however, how\r\nlittle talent his god-daughter had for the art of _Cussy_ and\r\n_Brillot-Savarin_, and wishing to provide an honorable and comfortable\r\nhome for her, he removed her from the charge of her personal to that of\r\nhis real property. We will see how fully Mlle. Celestine justified the\r\nesteem of her god-father: with what martial courage she took possession\r\nof this kingdom of shadows; and how, after sprinkling the whole house\r\nwith holy water and hung a bough of a blessed tree, she had declared\r\nthat this asylum, thus purified, henceforth would be unapproachable to\r\nthe man who had been hung.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, for three years, neither the suicide nor any one else had\r\nviolated this sanctuary of virtue. But Mlle. Celestine was not only a\r\nvirtuous and sensible woman, but a woman of eloquence. Nothing could be\r\nmore attractive than the harangues she made use of to induce lodgers to\r\noccupy her rooms. Honey flowed from her mouth, and many persons were led\r\naway by the siren's song. But generally they soon became terrified and\r\nfled from the terrors which besieged them. Mlle. Celestine Crepeneau\r\ntherefore could not praise her new lodger too highly. \"What a charming\r\nman,\" said she to her neighbors in 11 and 51, the porters of which\r\nlooked on her as an oracle. \"Doctor Matheus is an angel, pure as those\r\nof Paradise. God forgive me for saying so, for I think he is handsomer\r\nthan they, with his magnificent whiskers and moustache. I do not see why\r\nangels do not wear them! I am sure they are very becoming. Besides, he\r\nis so kind to other people. Only the other day he wished to set\r\n_Tamburin's_ leg, which some Jacobin had broken.\" In Mlle. Crepeneau's\r\nmind, a Jacobin was capable of any thing. \"And what a magnificent room\r\nhe has! how beautiful: all full of noble skeletons, Jacobins' heads, and\r\nbooks enough to fill all the Place Louis XV. He has also a fine\r\npractice, and patients of every kind coming on horseback, in carriages,\r\non foot, and in wooden shoes. He refuses no one, and cures every\r\nbody--even _Tamburin_. The poor animal is very fond of him, never\r\nbarking when he passes, but wagging his tail as if he knew his\r\nphysician. I alone attend to Doctor Matheus,\" continued Mlle. Crepeneau,\r\n\"and I flatter myself he is well waited on. He has a great deal of\r\ntrouble, too, especially on his consultation days. One would think then\r\nall Paris met at his house. He is a brave man, and is not afraid of\r\nghosts! Yet he said the other day, 'I have killed so many people that\r\none more would run me mad.'\"\r\n\r\nYet while Mlle. Crepineau was thus prodigal of her praises, in front of\r\nNo. 13, her lodger, as she called him, was in the third story of the\r\nhouse, and was shut up in his room engaged in the strangest manner. The\r\nstudio had preserved nothing of its original destination but its name.\r\nInstead of pictures, plaster casts, statuettes, and manikins, the table\r\nwas covered with manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and loose papers; on\r\nthis battle-field, where science, art and politics seemed to contend\r\ntogether, stood a noble Japan vase from which arose a noble bouquet of\r\nwhite camelias--above this hung the portrait of a protestant preacher.\r\n\r\nDoctor Matheus, as Mlle. Celestine had said, was young and handsome. He\r\nhad luxuriant fair hair, hanging in clusters around his face and falling\r\non his shoulders, so as to give a seraphic air to his face, very well\r\ncalculated to touch the heart of pious Celestine. In his mild blue eyes,\r\nhowever, there was an expression of will, decision and daring which\r\nstrangely contrasted with the rest of his face. The Doctor was tall and\r\nelegantly formed, and wore at home the costume yet popular at Leipsig,\r\nGottingen and Heidelberg, a doublet of velvet and a kind of cap\r\nsurmounted by a plume. He had suppressed the plume. This is exactly the\r\ncostume of Karl de Moor in Schiller's robber; and in 1847 we saw the\r\npupils of those venerable universities strolling through the streets of\r\nthe German capitals in this very theatrical costume, precisely that of\r\nWilhelm Meister's actors when they met Mignon on the Ingolstadt road\r\njust after their unfortunate representation of Hamlet. The Doctor, we\r\nhave said, was strangely engaged. He leaned over a vast chart of Europe,\r\nextended before him like a body waiting for the knife of the anatomist.\r\nHis eyes were expanded, his brow flushed, and from time to time he stuck\r\nblack pins into this chart, and whenever he did so consulted the\r\nmanuscripts which he held in his hand. When he had inserted the last\r\npin, he arose, and with a cry of joy looked around like a conqueror; as\r\ngreat men are wont to survey their fields of triumphs. \"Europe is ours,\"\r\nsaid he, \"and the world is Europe's.\" The vaccine of _Carbonarism_ has\r\ntaken, and courses from vein to vein, to the very noblest portion of the\r\nsocial body. It has reached and taken possession of the heart. The old\r\nman is dead and a new being is about to be born. Better still, Lazarus,\r\nregenerated, is about to burst from the tomb.\r\n\r\nAfraid to yield to a false hope, trembling lest he should be deceived in\r\nhis calculations, the Doctor leaned again over his chart, and began to\r\ncompute the black pins which, like a mourning cloak, covered the map of\r\nEurope. And indeed the terrible monster he had named was a pall thrown\r\nover the happiness of the people of the world. The idealists and\r\nambitious men who sought to extend it were the murderers of all\r\nprosperity. A Gothic clock which leaned against the wall struck eleven.\r\nThe features of the Doctor at once changed their expression, and\r\ninfinite grief replaced the enthusiasm which pervaded them. He hurried\r\nto a low window of his cabinet, and pushing aside the curtain, looked\r\nanxiously into a garden which was behind the house he dwelt in, and from\r\nwhich he was separated only by the _parterre_ of which we have spoken\r\nbefore. This garden belonged to a magnificent hotel in the street of\r\nVerennes. A large portal decked with flower vases led to rooms on the\r\nground-floor. This door was just then opened and a beautiful girl\r\nhurried past, when the Doctor went to the window of his cabinet. The\r\nyoung girl walked down an alley well lighted; she seemed to seek for the\r\ngenerous heat of the sun, and turned toward it like a true Heliotrope.\r\nShe seemed to take no care of her complexion, for her head was scarcely\r\ncovered by a straw-hat which could not avert the heat. A thin dress of\r\nembroidered muslin with short sleeves displayed her arms, and a blue\r\nsash surrounded her thin and delicate form. She gathered a few flowers,\r\nand cut away a few bad branches of the rose-trees with an elegant\r\nEnglish pruning-knife. Then after having passed two or three times up\r\nand down the alley in front of the portal, she put her hand to her brow\r\nas if to make a visor to shield her eyes from the burning rays of the\r\nsun. Just in front of her was the window--the curtain of which Doctor\r\nMatheus had drawn aside, and there he stood more beautiful and radiant\r\nthan ever. The young girl blushed slightly and looked hastily away, for\r\nthe sun probably appeared too bright just then. The Doctor seemed\r\nfascinated by what he had seen, and we cannot say how long his ecstasy\r\ncontinued. At last a well-known voice exclaimed on the other side of the\r\ndoor, which was closed even to Mlle. Celestine Crepineau, \"Doctor--you\r\nare wanted in the parlor. A gentleman--a patient. He has given me his\r\ncard to bring you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Doctor, \"I am coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, if you will open the door I will give you his card.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep it,\" said the Doctor, \"as I am coming down and do not need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" said the inquisitive porteress.--\"Monsieur may wish to know the\r\nname in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" said the Doctor, \"and hope Mlle. Crepineau that you will go\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" said Mlle. Celestine, terrified at the Doctor's manner. \"What\r\nis the matter with my new lodger? Why will he not let me enter his\r\ncabinet? Perhaps though he is cutting up some human body, and has\r\nrespect for my sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor left his room, and locked the door carefully; putting the key\r\nin his pocket, he went down. When he entered the room he was amazed to\r\nsee who was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke d'Harcourt here!\" said he, bowing respectfully to his visitor.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said, \"My visit should not surprise you, for I came, after all,\r\nonly to thank you for your services to my dear Marie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duke,\" said Doctor Matheus, \"your benevolent reception, when I had the\r\nhonor to be presented to you, has converted a duty into a pleasure. The\r\nnatural interest,\" added he, with profound emotion, \"with which your\r\ndaughter inspires all who see her, would make me most proud of her\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said the Duke, looking most earnestly at the physician, \"you\r\ninspire me with a confidence I have had in none of your brethren. Your\r\nreply, therefore, to my question, I shall look on as a sentence. Do not\r\nfear to be frank, Doctor, for I am prepared for every misfortune;\r\nalready crushed by my sufferings, my heart looks forward to no earthly\r\nhappiness. The lives of my two surviving children are the objects of my\r\nown life, but uncertainty is too much for me. Reply therefore, I beg\r\nyou, sincerely to me whether the life of my child is in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duke,\" said Doctor Matheus, \"the hand of God is more powerful than that\r\nof science.--HE often strikes down the strong, and preserves the weak,\r\nso that none here can tell when to expect his blows. I can, however,\r\nassure you on my honor, that your daughter, delicate as she is, at this\r\ntime has not even a germ of the terrible malady which has ravaged your\r\nhearth. This germ is always in the blood of members of the same family.\r\nArt establishes this, though it can provide no remedy.--This secret\r\nenemy, however,\" said the physician, with a kind of pride, \"before which\r\nall known remedies are powerless, I can perhaps oppose and conquer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Doctor, tell me!\" said the Duke, clasping the Doctor's hands,\r\n\"save my child, grant her life, and my fortune is yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duke,\" said Matheus, \"if I had the honor of a better acquaintance with\r\nyou, I would not listen to such language as you have used.--Gold has\r\nlittle value in my eyes, and reputation no more, for I do not place my\r\nhopes for the future in my profession. Since, however, study has\r\nrevealed to me the art of assisting those who suffer, and of saving\r\nthose who are in danger, I would esteem it a crime not to do so; and I\r\npromise this art shall be employed in the cure of Mlle. d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said the Duke, \"will this be a secret to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Duke; I will use it in your presence. I will also own that I have\r\nalready made use of it, though but slightly, in the case of Mlle.\r\nd'Harcourt; what I have done, satisfies me that I may hope to see her\r\ncompletely restored.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true;\" said the Duke. \"The interview and the simple remedies you\r\nprescribed, have sufficed to soothe the sufferings of my daughter. Ah!\r\nMonsieur,\" added he, clasping the Doctor's hand kindly, \"how can I\r\ndischarge my obligations towards you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By granting me a boon, invaluable to me, and which all Paris will envy,\r\nand of which I know you are prodigal indeed, your esteem--the respect\r\nof the Duke d'Harcourt--the most honorable and virtuous of men. You see,\r\nMonsieur, I place a great value on my consultations; and few persons\r\nhave received so noble a recompense from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said the Duke d'Harcourt, with a smile, \"in that case you are\r\nalready paid; for I know all that you do in Paris, and especially in\r\nthis neighborhood. I know that want meets here with a better reception\r\nthan opulence, and that you look on all sufferers as having an equal\r\nclaim on your attention. You must be aware, that knowing this I have\r\nalready given you all you ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the Doctor, \"let me continue to have your respect,\r\nand we shall be equal.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Mlle. Celestine Crepineau knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said Doctor Matheus.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there are in the reception-room an English Milord, and two\r\nmiserable creatures waiting to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are the latter?\"\r\n\r\n\"One is an Auvergnat, very badly dressed, with a bandage over his eye,\r\nwho has already been here once or twice.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Matheus seemed annoyed, and turned away lest the Duke should\r\nobserve it.\r\n\r\n\"The other is a peasant from the environs, who has a handkerchief over\r\nhis face as if he _enjoyed a fluxion_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go,\" said the Duke, \"for your visitors are impatient, and sorrow\r\nshould not wait. I will give place to Milord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the Doctor, \"show in the poor wretches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Duke, \"the poor before the rich, I expected that.\"\r\nBowing kindly to the Doctor, the old nobleman left.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the reception room, he saw the Doctor's visitors,\r\neach of whom looked towards him. The _Milord_ rushed towards a window,\r\nwhich luckily was closed. The other two were introduced to the Doctor's\r\nroom. No sooner were they there, than the one threw off his\r\nhandkerchief, and the Auvergnat his bandage. The Doctor gave them his\r\nhand and exclaimed, \"MONTE-LEONE! Taddeo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here, too, am I,\" said the Milord, entering the room and throwing\r\naside his red wig and burning whiskers.\r\n\r\n\"D'Harcourt, too\"--said the Doctor, hurrying to meet the new comer--and\r\nthen closing the curtains, \"Here we all are,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Von Apsbury,\" said the Count, embracing him. \"_The Pulcinelli\r\nof the Etruscan villa are again united._\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin's father had seventeen children. He was the fifteenth. He\r\nsays in his autobiography, that his father died at the age of\r\neighty-nine, and his mother at the age of eighty-five, and that neither\r\nwere ever known to have any sickness except that of which they died.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer\r\n& Townsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nLIFE AT A WATERING PLACE.\r\n\r\nTHE DOG OF ALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nBY C. ASTOR BRISTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Tom Edwards mysteriously swallowed up, like a stage ghost down a\r\ntrap-door. And do you know, reader, I am very near leaving him so for\r\ngood and all, and suspending these sketches indefinitely,--yea, even to\r\nthe time of the Mississippi dividends, or any other period beyond the\r\nGreek Calends that your imagination can conjure up. For the wise\r\nmen--and the wise women, too--of Gotham are wroth with me, and one says\r\nthat I am writing on purpose to libel this man or puff that woman, and\r\nanother charges me with sketching my own life in _Fraser_, for\r\nself-glorification, and a third holds up the last number of _Pendennis_\r\nat me and says, \"If you could write like _that_, there would be some\r\nexcuse for you, but you won't as long as you live.\" \"Alas, no!\" said I,\r\nand was just going to burn my unfinished papers, and vow that I would\r\nnever again turn aside from my old craft of reviewing. But then came\r\nreflection in the shape of a bottle of true Dutch courage--genuine\r\nKnickerbocker Madeira--and said, \"Why should you be responsible for\r\nresemblances you never meant, if people will insist on finding them?\r\nConsider how prone readers, and still more hearers who take their\r\nreading at second-hand, are to suppose that the author, be he great or\r\nsmall, must have represented himself in some one of his personages.\"\r\nTrue enough, Mr. Bottle; for instance, any one of our fashionables will\r\ntell you that \"our _spirituel_ and accomplished friend\" (as Slingsby\r\ncalls him), M. Le Vicomte Vincent Le Roi, is the hero of his thrilling\r\nromance, _Le Chevalier Bazalion_--why they should, or what possible\r\nresemblance they can find between the real man in New-York, and the\r\nideal one in the novel, it passeth my poor understanding to discover.\r\nBazalion is a stalwart six-footer, who goes about knocking people's\r\nbrains out, scaling inaccessible precipices, defending castles\r\nsingle-handed against a regiment or two, and, by way of relaxation after\r\nthis hard work, victimizing all the fair dames and blooming damsels that\r\ncome in his way--breaking the hearts of all the women when he has broken\r\nthe heads of all the men. Le Roi is a nice gentlemanly man, of the\r\nordinary size, who sings prettily and talks well, and makes himself\r\ngenerally agreeable, and not at all dangerous in society--much the more\r\nChristian and laudable occupation, it seems to me. If ever he does bore\r\nyou, it is with his long stories, not with a long pike as Bazalion used\r\nto do. Be the absurdity, then, on the head of him who makes it; _Qui\r\nvult decipi decipiatur_: if any one chooses to think that I am bodied\r\nforth under the character of Harry Benson, and am, in consequence, a\r\nhandsome young man, who can do a little of every thing instead of----but\r\nnever mind what; your actor has not yet sufficient standing to come down\r\nbefore the footlights, and have his little bit of private chaff with\r\nthe audience. Only this will I say, so help me N. P. Willis, I mean to\r\ngo on with these sketches till they are finished, provided always that\r\n_Fraser_ will take them so long and that you continue to read them, or\r\nfall into a sweet and soothing slumber over them, as the case may be.\r\nFor if we are all to shut up shop until we can write as well as Mr.\r\nTitmarsh, there will be too extensive a bankruptcy of literary\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nBefore Ashburner could form any conjecture to account for the\r\nevanishment of Edwards--indeed before he could altogether realize it to\r\nhimself--the little man's head reappeared above the ground, though there\r\nwere no signs of his horse; and at the same time Benson began to ride\r\nround the scene of the catastrophe, at an easy canter, laughing\r\nimmoderately. The Englishman shook up his brute into the best gallop he\r\ncould get out of him, and a few more strides brought him near enough to\r\nsee the true state of things. There was a marsh at no great distance,\r\nwhich rendered the grass in the immediate vicinity moist and sloppy, and\r\njust in this particular spot the action of the water had caved away a\r\nhole precisely large enough to receive a horse and rider--it could\r\nhardly have made a more accurate grave had they been measured for\r\nit--and so marked by a slight elevation in front, that it was ten to one\r\nany person riding over the ground at such a rate, and unacquainted with\r\nthe position of this trap, but must fall headlong into it, as Edwards\r\nhad done. There was some reason to suspect that our friend Harry, who\r\nwas an habitual rider, and knew all the environs of Oldport pretty well,\r\nand was fonder of short cuts and going over grass than most American\r\nhorsemen are, had not been altogether ignorant of the existence of the\r\npitfall; it looked very much as if he had led Edwards, who was no\r\nparticular friend of his, purposely into it: but if such was the case,\r\nhe kept his own counsel. When the fallen man and mare had scrambled out\r\nof the hole, which they did before Benson had offered to help them, or\r\nAshburner had time to be of any assistance, it appeared that she had\r\nsprained her off foreankle, and he his nigh wrist. But they were close\r\nto the main road; by good luck a boy was found to conduct the animal\r\nhome, and by a still greater piece of good luck the Robinsons' carriage\r\nhappened to be coming along just then, so the little man, who did not\r\ntake up much room, was popped into it, and as much pitied and mourned\r\nover by the lady occupants as was _père Guilleri_ in the French song.\r\nAnd, to do him justice, even without this consolation, he had taken his\r\nmishap very quietly from the first, as soon as he found himself not\r\ninjured in any vital, _i. e._ dancing part.\r\n\r\nHaving finished their road at a more leisurely pace, our two horsemen\r\narrived at the glen after most of the company were assembled there. And\r\nas the place was one of general resort, they noticed traces of other\r\nparties, people of the Simpson class, hail-fellow-well-met men, who\r\ndidn't dance but took it out in drinking, and who in their intercourse\r\nwith the other sex, betrayed more vulgar familiarity and less refined\r\nindecency than characterized the men and boys of White, Edwards,\r\nRobinson, and Co.'s set. But of these it may be supposed that the set\r\ntook no heed. There was some really pretty scenery about the glen, but\r\nthey took no heed of that either--to be sure, most of them had seen it\r\nat least once before. They had gone straight to the largest parlor of\r\nthe house, and led, as usual, by the indefatigable Edwards, had begun\r\ntheir tricks with the chairs. Booted and spurred as he was, and with his\r\narm in a sling, the ever-ready youth had already arranged the German\r\ncotillion, taking the head himself, and constituting Sumner his second\r\nin command. Benson was left out of this dance for coming too late, one\r\nof the ladies told him; but he did not find the punishment very severe,\r\nas he rather preferred walking with Ashburner, and showing him the\r\nadjacent woods. As they passed out through several specimens of the\r\nSimpson species, who were smoking and lounging around the door,\r\nAshburner nearly ran over a very pretty young woman who was coming up\r\nthe steps. She was rather rustically, but not unbecomingly dressed, and\r\naltogether so fresh and rosy that it was a treat to see her after the\r\nfine town ladies, even the youngest of whom were beginning to look faded\r\nand jaded from the dissipation of the season. But when she opened her\r\nmouth in reply to Benson's affable salutation, it was like the girl in\r\nthe fairy tale dropping toads and adders, so nasal, harsh, and\r\ninharmonious was the tone in which she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"That's Mrs. Simpson,\" said Harry, as they went on, \"the Bird's wife.\r\nPretty little woman: what a pity she has that vulgar accent! She belongs\r\nto New England originally; one finds many such girls here, every way\r\ncharming until they begin to talk. But I suppose you saw no difference\r\nbetween her and any of us. In your ears we all speak with a barbarous\r\naccent--at least you feel bound to think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think yourself? You have known a good many of my\r\ncountrymen, and heard them talk, and are able to make the comparison. Do\r\nyou, or do you not, find a difference?\"\r\n\r\n\"To say the truth, I do; it is a thing I never think seriously of\r\ndenying, for it seems to me neither singular nor to be ashamed of. You\r\ncan tell an Irishman from a Londoner by his accent; so you can a\r\nScotchman; or a Yorkshireman for that matter: why should you not be able\r\nto tell an American? The error of your countrymen consists in\r\nattributing to all our people the nasal twang, which is almost peculiar\r\nto one section of the country. If I were asked the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of a New-Yorker's speech, I should say _monotone_.\r\nNotice any one of our young men--you will find his conversational voice\r\npitched in the same key. Sumner goes on at the same uniform growl,\r\nEdwards in an unvaried buzz. When I first landed in England, I was\r\nstruck with the much greater variety of tone one hears in ordinary\r\nconversation. Your women, especially, seemed to me always just going to\r\nsing. And I fancied the address of the men affected--just as, very\r\nlikely, this monotone of ours seems affected to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I remark most is a hardness and dryness of voice, as if the\r\nextremes of climate here had an injurious effect on the vocal organs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they do; and yet I think you will find a better average of\r\nsingers, male and female, in our society than in yours, notwithstanding\r\nour fashionables are so engrossed by dancing. Holla! here's Harrison.\r\nHow are you, old fellow? and how are the Texas Inconvertibles?\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the broker, wandering moodily alone. What had he in common\r\nwith the rest of the company--the fops and flirts, the dancing men and\r\ndancing women? The males all snubbed and despised him, from tall White\r\ndown to little Robinson; the women were hardly conscious of his\r\nexistence. He knew, too, that he could thrash any man there in a fair\r\nstand-up fight, or buy out any three of them, ay, or talk any of them\r\ndown in the society of sensible and learned people; and this very\r\nconsciousness of superiority only served to embitter his position the\r\nmore. There were other sets, doubtless, who would have welcomed him\r\ngladly, but either they were not sufficiently to his taste to attract\r\nhim, or he was in no mood to receive consolation from their sympathy. So\r\nhe had wandered alone, untouched by the charming scenery about him--a\r\nman whom nobody cared for; and when Benson addressed him genially, and\r\nin an exuberance of spirits threw his arm over the other's neck as they\r\nwalked side by side, the broker's heart seemed to expand towards the man\r\nwho had shown him even this slight profession of kindness, his\r\nintelligent eyes lighted up, and he began to talk out cheerfully and\r\nunassumingly all that was in him.\r\n\r\nHarrison's own narrative of his personal prowess, as well as the\r\nqualified panegyric pronounced upon him by Benson, had led Ashburner to\r\nexpect to find in him a manly person with some turn for athletic sports\r\nand good living, but no particular intellectual endowments beyond such\r\nas his business demanded. He was, therefore, not a little astonished at\r\n(inasmuch as he was altogether unprepared for) the variety of knowledge\r\nand the extent of mental cultivation which the broker displayed as their\r\nconversation went on. They talked of the hills and valleys, and ravines\r\nand water-courses around them, and Harrison compared this place with\r\nothers in a way that showed a ready observer of the beauties of nature.\r\nThey talked of Italy, and Harrison had at his fingers' ends the\r\nprincipal palaces in every city, and the best pictures in every palace.\r\nThey talked of Greece, and Harrison quoted Plato. They talked of England\r\nand France, and Harrison displayed a familiar acquaintance, not merely\r\nwith the statistics of the two countries, but also with the habits and\r\ncharacteristics of their people. Finally, they talked on the puzzling\r\ntopic of American society--puzzling in its transition state and its\r\nsingular contrasts--and, whether the broker's views were correct or not,\r\nthey were any thing but commonplace or conventional.\r\n\r\n\"Our fashionable society has been all a mistake hitherto,\" said Harry\r\n(Ashburner could not well make out whether there was a spice of irony in\r\nhis observation); \"Mrs. Benson and some others are going to reform it\r\nindifferently. The women thus far have been lost sight of after\r\nmarriage, and have left the field to the young girls. Now they are\r\nbeginning to wake up to their rights and privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not remedy any of the present evils in that way,\" answered\r\nHarrison, apparently addressing himself to Ashburner, but he seemed to\r\nbe talking at Benson and through him at Benson's wife, or his own, or\r\nboth of them. \"Our theory and practice was that a young girl should\r\nenjoy herself in all freedom; that her age and condition were those of\r\npleasure and frolic--of dissipation, if you will--that after her\r\nmarriage she, comparatively speaking, retired from the world, not\r\nthrough any conventional rule or imaginary standard of propriety, but of\r\nher own free will, and in the natural course of things; because the\r\ncares of maternity and her household gave her sufficient employment at\r\nhome. A woman who takes a proper interest in her family gives them the\r\nfirst place in her thoughts, and is always ready to talk about them. Now\r\nthese domestic details are the greatest possible bore to a mere\r\nfashionable casual drawing-room acquaintance. Hence you see that the\r\nFrench, whose chief aim is to talk well in a drawing-room or an opera\r\nbox, utterly detest and unmercifully ridicule every thing connected with\r\ndomesticity or home life. On the other hand, if a married woman never\r\ntalks of these things or lets you think of them, she does not take a\r\nproper interest in her family. No, the fault of youth is with the other\r\nsex. There are too few men about, and too many boys. And the more\r\nmarried belles there are the more will the boys be encouraged. For your\r\nmarried belles like to have men about them younger than themselves--it\r\nmakes them appear younger, or at least they think so; and besides, such\r\nyouths are more easily managed and more subservient. But, still worse,\r\nthe more these boys usurp the place of men in society, the more boyish\r\nand retrograde will the few men become who continue to divide the honors\r\nof society with them. When Plato enumerated among the signs of a\r\nrepublic in the last stage of decadence, that the youth imitate and\r\nrival old men, and the old men let themselves down to a level with the\r\nyouth, he anticipated exactly the state of things that has come to pass\r\namong us. Look at that little friend of yours with the beard--I don't\r\nmean Edwards, but an older man about his size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dicky Bleecker, I suppose you mean,\" growled Benson: \"he's as much your\r\nfriend--or your wife's--as he is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is my contemporary, I may say; perhaps five years at most my\r\njunior. What perceptible sign of mature age or manliness is there about\r\nhim? In what is he superior to or distinguishable from young Snelling,\r\nwho but this season rejoices in his first white tie and first horse, and\r\nin the fruits of his first course of dancing lessons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but consider,\" said Benson, who was always ready to take up any\r\nside of an argument--it was one of the first criticisms Ashburner made\r\non American conversation, that the men seemed to talk for victory rather\r\nthan for truth--\"it stands to reason, that an intelligent married woman\r\nmust be better able than a girl to converse with a mature man, and her\r\nconversation must have more attraction for him. As to our boys coming\r\nout too soon, doubtless they do, but that depends not on the persons\r\nready to receive them, but on the general social system of the country\r\nwhich pushes them into the world so early. For instance, I was left my\r\nown master at twenty-one. So, too, with the want of proper progress and\r\ngrowth in knowledge of the men. It is and must be so with the man of\r\nfashion every where, for he is not occupied in learning things that have\r\na tendency to develop or improve his mind, but the contrary. I myself\r\nhave seen Frenchmen of fifty as easily amused and as eager after trifles\r\nas boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frenchmen?\" sneered the other; \"yes, but they _are_ boys all their\r\nlives, except in innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very amusing and pleasant, at any rate; the best people for travelling\r\nacquaintances that I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly--very pleasant to know for a little while. I have met with a\r\ngreat many Frenchmen who impressed me favorably, and I used to think as\r\nyou say, what amusing people they were, but I never had occasion to live\r\nwith one for any length of time without finding him a bore and a\r\nnuisance. A Frenchman turns himself inside out, as it were, at once. He\r\nshows off all that there is to show on first acquaintance. You see the\r\nbest of him immediately, and afterwards there is nothing left but\r\nrepetitions of the same things, and eternal dissertations on himself and\r\nhis own affairs. He is like a wide, shallow house, with a splendid front\r\nexternally, and scanty furniture inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, and an Englishman (don't blush Ashburner) is like a suite of\r\ncollege-rooms in one of his own university towns--a rusty exterior, a\r\ndark, narrow passage along which you find your way with difficulty; and\r\nwhen you do get in, jolly and comfortable apartments open suddenly upon\r\nyou; and as you come to examine them more carefully, you discover all\r\nsorts of snug, little, out-of-the-way closets and recesses, full of old\r\nbooks and old wine, and all things rich and curious. But the entrance is\r\nuninviting to a casual acquaintance. Now, when you find an American of\r\nthe right stamp (here Benson's hands were accidentally employed in\r\nadjusting his cravat), he hits the proper medium, and is accessible as a\r\nFrenchman and as true as an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner was going to express a doubt as to the compatibility of the\r\ntwo qualities, when Harrison struck in again.\r\n\r\n\"On that account I never could see why Frenchmen should be dreaded as\r\ndangerous in society. They fling out all their graces at once, exhaust\r\nall their powers of fascination, and soon begin to be tiresome. How many\r\ncases I have seen where a Frenchman fancied he was making glorious\r\nheadway in a lady's affections, and that she was just ready to fall into\r\nhis arms, when she was only ready to fall asleep in his face, and was\r\ncivil to him only from a great sacrifice of inclination to politeness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very pleasant it must be to a lady,\" said Ashburner, \"that a man should\r\nbe at the same time wearying her to death with his company, and\r\nperilling her reputation out of doors by his language.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, it's dinner time!\" exclaimed Benson, pulling out a microscopic\r\nGeneva watch. \"I thought the clock of my inner man said as much.\" And\r\nback they hurried through the woods to the Glen House, but were as late\r\nfor the dinner as they had been for the dance. Harrison and Benson found\r\nseats at the lower end of the table, where they established themselves\r\ntogether and began, _à propos_ of Edwards's misadventure, to talk horse,\r\neither because they had exhausted all other subjects, or because they\r\ndid not think the company worthy a better one. Mrs. Benson beckoned\r\nAshburner up to a place by her, but, somehow, he found himself opposite\r\nMrs. Harrison's eyes, and though he could not remember any thing she\r\nsaid ten minutes after, her conversation, or looks, or both, had the\r\neffect of transferring to her all the interest he was beginning to feel\r\nfor her husband--of whom, by the way, she took no more notice than if he\r\nhad not belonged to her.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Harrison!\" said Benson, as he and Ashburner were walking their\r\nhorses leisurely homeward that evening (they both had too much sense to\r\nride fast after dinner), \"he is twice thrown away! He might have been a\r\nliterary gentleman and a lover of art, living quietly on a respectable\r\nfortune; but his father would make him go into business. He might be a\r\nmodel family man, and at the same time a very entertaining member of\r\nsociety; but his wife has snubbed and suppressed him for her own\r\nexaltation. If, instead of treating him thus, she would only show him a\r\nlittle gratitude as the source of all her luxury and magnificence, her\r\ndresses and her jewelry, her carriage and horses (what a pair of\r\niron-grays she does drive!), and all her other splendors--if she would\r\nonly be proud of him as the great broker--not to speak of his varied\r\nknowledge, of which she might also well be proud--if she would take some\r\nlittle pains to interest herself in his pleasures and to bring him\r\nforward in society--how easily she could correct and soften his little\r\nuncouthnesses of person and dress, if she would take the trouble! Why\r\nshould she be ashamed of him? He is older than she--how much? ten years\r\nperhaps, or twelve at most. He is not a beauty; but in a man, I should\r\nsay, mind, comes before good looks; and how infinitely superior he is in\r\nmind and soul to any of the frivolous little beaux, native or foreign,\r\nwhom she delights to draw about her!\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I shall never be able to regard Mr. Harrison with as much\r\nrespect as you do. It may be ignorance, but I never could see much\r\ndifference between a speculator in stocks and a gambler.\"\r\n\r\n\"When a man is in his predicament domestically there are three things,\r\nto one, two, or all of which he is pretty sure to take--drink, gambling,\r\nand horses. Harrison is too purely intellectual a man to be led away by\r\nthe vulgar animal temptation of liquor, though he has a good cellar, and\r\nsometimes consoles himself with a snug bachelor dinner. Stock-jobbing\r\nis, as you say, only another sort of gambling, and this is his vice: at\r\nthe same time you will consider that it is his business, to which he was\r\nbrought up. Then, for absolute relaxation, he has his 'fast crab.' Put\r\nhim behind his 2' 45\" stepper and he is happy for an hour or two, and\r\nforgets his miseries--that is to say, his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you talk as if his marriage was the cause of his speculations,\r\nwhereas you told me the other day that his speculations were the\r\nindirect cause of his marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right: I believe the beginning of that bad habit must be set\r\ndown to his father's account; but the continuance of it is still\r\nchargeable on his wife. I have heard him say myself that he would have\r\nretired from business long ago but for Mrs. Harrison--that is to say, he\r\nhad to go on making money to supply her extravagance.\"\r\n\r\nOne fine morning there was a great bustle and flurry; moving of trunks,\r\nand paying of bills, and preparations for departure. The fashionables\r\nwere fairly starved out, and had gone off in a body. The brilliant\r\nequipages of Ludlow and Löwenberg, the superfine millinery of the\r\nRobinsons, the song and story of the Vicomte, the indefatigable\r\nrevolutions of Edwards, were all henceforth to be lost to the sojourners\r\nat Oldport. Mr. Grabster heeded not this practical protest against the\r\nerror of his ways. He had no difficulty in filling the vacant rooms, for\r\na crowd of people from all parts of the Union constantly thronged\r\nOldport, attracted by its reputation for coolness and salubrity; and he\r\nrather preferred people from the West and South, as they knew less about\r\ncivilized life, and were more easily imposed upon. To be sure, even they\r\nwould find out in time the deficiencies of his establishment, and report\r\nthem at home; but meanwhile he hoped to fill his pockets for two or\r\nthree seasons under cover of _The Sewer's_ puffs, and then, when\r\nbusiness fell off, to impose on his landlord with some plausible story,\r\nand obtain a lowering of his rent.\r\n\r\nSome few--a very few--of \"our set\" were left. Our friend Harry stayed,\r\nbecause the air of the place agreed remarkably with the infant hope of\r\nthe Bensons; and a few of the beaux remained--among them Sumner, White,\r\nand Sedley--either out of friendship for Benson, or retained by the\r\nattractions of Mrs. Benson, or those of Mrs. Harrison; for the _lionne_\r\nstayed of course, it being her line to do just whatever the exclusives\r\ndid not do. But though Benson remained, he was not disposed to suffer in\r\nsilence. All this while _The Sewer_ had been filled with letters lauding\r\nevery thing about the Bath Hotel; and communications equally\r\ndisinterested, and couched in the same tone, had found their way into\r\nsome more respectable prints. Benson undertook the thankless task of\r\nundeceiving the public. He sat down one evening and wrote off a spicy\r\nepistle to _The Blunder and Bluster_, setting forth how things really\r\nwere at Oldport. Two days after, when the New-York mail arrived, great\r\nwas the wrath of Mr. Grabster. He called into council the old gentleman\r\nwith the melodious daughter, _The Sewer_ reporters, and some other\r\nboarders who were in his confidence; and made magnificent, but rather\r\nvague promises, of what he would do for the man who should discover the\r\ndaring individual who had thus bearded him in his very den;\r\nsimultaneously he wrote to _The Blunder and Bluster_, demanding the name\r\nof the offender. With most American editors such a demand (especially if\r\nfollowed up with a good dinner or skilfully-applied tip to the reporter\r\nor correspondent) would have been perfectly successful. But he of _The\r\nBlunder and Bluster_ was a much higher style of man. As Benson once said\r\nof him, he had, in his capacity of the first political journalist in the\r\ncountry, associated so much with gentlemen, that he had learned to be\r\nsomething of a gentleman himself. Accordingly he replied to Mr.\r\nGrabster, in a note more curt than courteous, that it was impossible to\r\ncomply with his request. So the indignant host was obliged to content\r\nhimself for the time with ordering _The Sewer_ to abuse the incognito.\r\nBefore many days, however, he obtained the desired information through\r\nanother source, in this wise.\r\n\r\nOldport had its newspaper, of course. Every American village of more\r\nthan ten houses has its newspaper. Mr. Cranberry Fuster, who presided\r\nover the destinies of _The Oldport Daily Twaddler_, added to this\r\nhonorable and amiable occupation the equally honorable and amiable one\r\nof village attorney. Though his paper was in every sense a small one,\r\nhe felt and talked as big as if it had been _The Times_, or _The\r\nMoniteur_, or _The Blunder and Bluster_. He held the President of the\r\nUnited States as something almost beneath his notice, and was in the\r\nhabit of lecturing the Czar of Russia, the Emperor of Austria, and other\r\nforeign powers, in true Little Pedlington style. Emboldened by the\r\nimpunity which attended these assaults, he undertook to try his hand on\r\nmatters nearer home, and boldly essayed one season to write down the\r\npolka and redowa as indecent and immoral. But here he found, as\r\nAlexander, Napoleon, and other great men, had done before him, that\r\nthere is a limit to all human power. He might better have tried to write\r\noff the roof of the Bath Hotel, which was rather a fragile piece of\r\nwork, and might have been carried away by much less wind than usually\r\nserved to distend the columns of _The Twaddler_. The doughty Tom Edwards\r\nsnapped his heels, so to speak, in the face of the mighty editor, and\r\nthe exclusives continued to polk more frantically than ever in the teeth\r\nof his direst fulminations. One practical effect, however, these home\r\ndiatribes had, which his luminous sallies on foreign affairs altogether\r\nfailed to effect--they put money into his pocket. The next thing\r\nAmericans like to hearing themselves well praised, is to hear somebody,\r\neven if it be themselves, well abused; and accordingly, on the mornings\r\nwhen Mr. Fuster let out an anti-polka article, the usually small\r\ncirculation of his small sheet was multiplied by a very large\r\nfactor--almost every stranger bought a copy, the million to see the\r\nabuse of the fashionables, the fashionables to see the abuse of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBenson, in the course of his almost annual visits to Oldport Springs,\r\nhad been frequently amused by the antics of this formidable gentleman,\r\nand had laudably contributed to make them generally known. Once, when\r\nMr. Fuster had politely denominated the Austrian emperor \"a scoundrel,\"\r\nHarry moved _The Blunder and Bluster_ to say, that it was very sorry for\r\nthat potentate, who would undoubtedly be overwhelmed with mortification\r\nwhen he learned that _The Twaddler_ entertained such an opinion of him.\r\nWhereupon Fuster, who was of a literal dulness absolutely joke-proof,\r\nstruck off a flaming article on \"the aristocratic sympathies\" of _The\r\nBlunder and Bluster_, which, like a British Whig and Federal journal as\r\nit was, always came to the rescue of tyrants and despots, &c. &c. On\r\nanother occasion--the very morning of a State election--_The Twaddler_\r\nhad announced, with a great flourish, \"that before its next sheet was\r\nissued Mr. Brown would be invested with the highest honors that the\r\nState could confer upon him.\" But even American editors are not always\r\ninfallible; Mr. Brown came out sadly in the minority, and the day after\r\n_The Blunder and Bluster_ had a little corner paragraph to this\r\neffect:--\r\n\r\n\"_We sincerely regret to see that our amusing little contemporary, THE\r\nOLDPORT DAILY TWADDLER, has suspended publication_.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Mr. Fuster flared up fearfully, and threatened to sue _The\r\nBlunder and Bluster_ for libel.\r\n\r\nNow this magniloquent editor, who professed to be a great moral reformer\r\nat home, and to regulate the destinies of nations abroad, was in truth\r\nthe mere creature and toady of Mr. Grabster, the greater part of the\r\nrevenue of his small establishment being derived from printing the bills\r\nand advertisements of the Bath Hotel. As in duty bound, therefore, he\r\nset to work to abuse the anonymous assailant of that atrociously-kept\r\nhouse, calling him a quantity of heterogeneous names, and more than\r\ninsinuating that he was a person who had never been in good society, and\r\ndid not know what good living was, _because_ he found fault with the\r\nliving at the Bath Hotel. The leader wound up with a more than ever\r\nexaggerated eulogy of Mr. Grabster and his \"able and gentlemanly\r\nassistants.\" Benson happened to get hold of this number of _The\r\nTwaddler_ one evening when he had nothing to do, and those dangerous\r\nimplements, pen, ink, and paper, were within his reach. Beginning to\r\nnote down the absurdities and _non sequiturs_ in Mr. Fuster's article,\r\nhe found himself writing a very chaffy letter to _The Twaddler_. He had\r\nan unfortunate talent for correspondence had Benson, like most of his\r\ncountrymen; so, giving the reins to his whim, he finished the epistle,\r\nmaking it very spicy and satirical, with a garnish of similes and\r\nclassical quotations--altogether rather a neat piece of work, only it\r\nmight have been objected to as a waste of cleverness, and building a\r\nlarge wheel to break a very small bug upon. Then he dropped it into the\r\npost-office himself, never dreaming that Cranberry would publish it, but\r\nmerely anticipating the wrath of the little-great man on receiving such\r\na communication. It chanced, however, not long before, that Benson, in\r\nthe course of some legal proceedings, had been to sign papers, and \"take\r\nfifty cents' worth of affidavit,\" as he himself phrased it, before Mr.\r\nFuster in his legal capacity. The latter gentleman had thus the means of\r\nidentifying by comparison, the handwriting of the pseudonymous letter.\r\nIn a vast fit of indignation, not unmingled with satisfaction, he\r\nbrought out next day Harry's letter at full length, to the great peril\r\nof the Latin quotations, and then followed it up with a rejoinder of his\r\nown, in which he endeavored to take an attitude of sublime dignity,\r\nbacked up by classical quotations also, to show that he understood Latin\r\nas well as Benson. But the attempt was as unsuccessful as it was\r\nelaborate, for his anger broke through in every other sentence, making\r\nthe intended \"smasher\" an extraordinary compound of superfine writing\r\nand vulgar abuse.\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of human events (he began) it becomes necessary for\r\nmen holding our lofty and responsible position to stoop to the\r\nchastisement of pretentious ignorance and imbecility, we shall not be\r\nfound to shrink from the task. The writer of the above letter is Mr.\r\nHenry Benson, a young man of property, and a Federal Whig. He\r\ninsinuates that we are very stupid. It's no such thing; we are not\r\nstupid a bit, and we mean to show Mr. B. as much before we have done\r\nwith him. Mr. Benson is a pompous young aristocrat, and Mr. Grabster is\r\nmore of a gentleman than he is--and so are we too for that matter. He\r\nsays the Bath Hotel is a badly kept house. We say it isn't, and we know\r\na great deal better than he does. We have dined there very often, and\r\nfound the fare and attendance excellent: and so did the Honorable\r\nTheophilus Q. Smith, of Arkansas, last summer, when he came to enjoy the\r\ninvigorating breezes of this healthful locality. That distinguished and\r\nremarkable man expressed himself struck with the arrangements of the\r\nBath Hotel, which left him no cause, he said, to regret the comforts of\r\nhis western home. But this establishment cannot please the fastidious\r\nMr. Benson! _O tempora, O Moses!_ as Cicero said to Catiline, _quousque\r\ntandem_?\r\n\r\nAnd so on for three columns.\r\n\r\nLikewise, _The Sewer_, which had begun to blackguard _The Blunder and\r\nBluster's_ correspondent while he remained under the shelter of his\r\npseudonym, now that his name was known, came out with double virulence,\r\nand filled half a sheet with filthy abuse of Harry, including collateral\r\nassaults on his brother, grandmother, and second cousins, and most of\r\nthe surviving members of his wife's family. But as Benson never read\r\n_The Sewer_, this part of the attack was an utter waste of Billingsgate\r\nso far as he was concerned. What did surprise and annoy him was to find\r\nthat _The Inexpressible_, which, though well-known to be a stupid, was\r\ngenerally considered a decent paper, had taken the enemy's side, and\r\npublished some very impertinent paragraphs about him. Afterwards he\r\ndiscovered that he had been the victim of a principle. _The\r\nInexpressible_ and _Blunder and Bluster_ had a little private quarrel of\r\ntheir own, and the former felt bound to attack every thing in any way\r\nconnected with the latter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Benson was not very much distressed even at this\r\noccurrence, for a reason which we shall now give at length, and which\r\nwill at the same time explain the propriety of the heading we have given\r\nto this number. While every body was reading _The Sewer_ and _The\r\nTwaddler_, and the more benevolent were pitying Harry for having started\r\nsuch a nest of editorial and other blackguards about his ears, and the\r\nmore curious were wondering whether he would leave the hotel and resign\r\nthe field of battle to the enemy, our friend really cared very little\r\nabout the matter, except so far as he could use it for a blind to divert\r\nattention from another affair which he had on hand, and which it was of\r\nthe greatest importance to keep secret, lest it should draw down the\r\ninterference of the local authorities: in short, he had a defiance to\r\nmortal combat impending over him, which dangerous probability he had\r\nbrought upon himself in this wise.\r\n\r\nAmong the beaux who remained after the Hegira of the fashionables was a\r\nMr. Storey Hunter, who had arrived at Oldport only just before that\r\ngreat event, for he professed to be a traveller and travelling man, and,\r\nto keep up the character never came to a place when other people did,\r\nbut always popped up unexpectedly in the middle, or at the end, of a\r\nseason, as if he had just dropped from the moon, or arrived from the\r\nantipodes. He had an affectation of being foreign--not English, or\r\nFrench, or German, or like any particular European nation, but foreign\r\nin a general sort of way, something not American; and always, on\r\nwhichever side of the Atlantic he was, hailed from some locality; at one\r\ntime describing himself in hotel books as from England, at another as\r\nfrom Paris, at another from Baden--from anywhere, in short, except his\r\nown native village in Connecticut. In accordance with this principle,\r\nmoreover, he carefully eschewed the indigenous habits of dress; and\r\nwhile all the other men appeared at the balls in dress coats, and black\r\nor white cravats, he usually displayed a flaming scarlet or blue tie, a\r\nshort frock coat, and yellow or brown trousers. A man six feet high, and\r\nnearly as many round, is a tolerably conspicuous object in most places,\r\neven without any marked peculiarities of dress; and when to this it is\r\nadded, that Mr. Hunter exhibited on his shirt-front and watch-chain\r\ntrinkets enough to stock a jeweller's shop, and that he was always\r\nredolent of the most fashionable perfumes, it may be supposed that he\r\nwas not likely to escape notice at Oldport. His age no one knew exactly;\r\nsome of the old stagers gave him forty years and more, but he was in a\r\nstate of wonderful preservation, had a miraculous dye for his whiskers,\r\nand a perpetually fresh color in his cheeks. Sedley used to say he\r\nrouged, and that you might see the marks of it inside his collar; but\r\nthis may have been only an accident in shaving. He rather preferred\r\nFrench to English in conversation; and with good reason, for when he\r\nused the former language, you might suppose (with your eyes shut) that\r\nyou were talking to a very refined gentleman, whereas, so soon as he\r\nopened his mouth in the vernacular, the provincial Yankee stood revealed\r\nbefore you. As to his other qualities and merits, he appeared to have\r\nplenty of money, and was an excellent and indefatigable dancer.\r\nAshburner, when he saw him spin round morning after morning, and night\r\nafter night, till he all but melted away himself, and threatened to\r\ndrown his partner, thought he must have the laudable motive of wishing\r\nto reduce his bulk, which, however, continued undiminished.\r\nNotwithstanding his travels and accomplishments, which, especially the\r\ndancing, were sufficient to give him a passport to the best society,\r\nthere were some who regarded him with very unfavorable eyes, more\r\nparticularly Sumner and Benson. Supposing this to be merely another of\r\nthe frivolous feuds that existed in the place, and among \"our set,\"\r\nAshburner was not over-anxious or curious to know the cause of it. Nor,\r\nif he had been, did the parties seem disposed to afford him much\r\ninformation. Benson had, indeed, observed one day, that _that_ Storey\r\nHunter was the greatest blackguard in Oldport, except _The Sewer_\r\nreporters; but as he had already said the same thing of half-a-dozen\r\nmen, his friend was not deterred thereby from making Hunter's\r\nacquaintance--or rather, from accepting it; the difficulty at Oldport\r\nbeing, _not_ to make the acquaintance of any man in society. And he\r\nfound the fat dandy, to all appearance, an innocent and good-natured\r\nperson, rather childish for his years, and well illustrating Harrison's\r\nassertion, that the men in fashionable life rather retrograded than\r\ndeveloped from twenty to forty; but in no apparent respect formidable,\r\nsave for a more than American tendency to gossip. He had some story to\r\nthe prejudice of every one, but seemed to tell all these stories just as\r\nan _enfant terrible_ might, without fully understanding them, or at all\r\nheeding the possible consequences of repeating them.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the balls had departed with Edwards and the Robinsons, but\r\nthe remaining fashionables kept up their amusement with much vigor; and\r\nthe absence of the others, though detracting much from the brilliancy of\r\nthe place, was in some respects the gain of a loss. White came out in\r\nall his glory now that most of the young men were gone. With his\r\ngraceful figure, neat dress, and ever-ready smile and compliment, he\r\nlooked the very ideal of the well-drilled man of fashion. Sumner, though\r\nhe could not have talked less if he had been an English heavy\r\ndragoon-officer, or an Hungarian refugee, understanding no language but\r\nhis own, was very useful for a quiet way he had of arranging every thing\r\nbeforehand without fuss or delay, and, moreover, had the peculiar merit\r\n(difficult to explain, but which we have all observed in some person at\r\nsome period of our lives) of _being good company without talking_.\r\nBenson, with less pretence and display than he had before exhibited,\r\nshowed an energy and indefatigableness almost equal to Le Roi's;\r\nwhatever he undertook, he \"kept the pot a-boiling.\" In short, the people\r\nof \"our set,\" who were left, went on among themselves much better than\r\nbefore, because the men's capabilities were not limited to dancing, and\r\nthe women had less temptation to be perpetually dressing. Besides, the\r\nremoval of most of the fashionables had encouraged the other portions of\r\nthe transient population to come more forward, and exhibit various\r\nprimitive specimens of dancing, and other traits worth observing. One\r\nevening there was a \"hop\" at the Bellevue. Ashburner made a point of\r\nalways looking in at these assemblies for an hour or so, and\r\nscrutinizing the company with the coolness and complacency which an\r\nEnglishman usually assumes in such places, as if all the people there\r\nwere made merely for his amusement. Benson, who had literally polked the\r\nheel off one of his boots, and thereby temporarily disabled himself, was\r\nlounging about with him, making observations on men, women, and things\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't think that was only a girl of seventeen,\" said Harry, as a\r\nlanguishing brunette, with large, liquid black eyes, and a voluptuous\r\nfigure, glided by them in the waltz. \"How soon these Southerners\r\ndevelope into women! They beat the Italians even.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder the young lady has time to grow, she dances so much. I have\r\nwatched her two or three evenings, and she has never rested a moment\r\nexcept when the music stopped.--Something must suffer, it seems to me.\r\nDoes her mind develope uniformly with her person? She is a great centre\r\nof attraction, I observe; is it only for her beauty and dancing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose a beautiful young woman, with fifty or sixty thousand a year,\r\nmay consider mental accomplishments as superfluous. She knows, perhaps,\r\nas much as a Russian woman of five-and-twenty. How much that is, you,\r\nwho have been on the Continent, know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, an heiress; acres of cotton-fields, thousands of negroes, and so\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I put the income down at half of what popular report makes it;\r\nthese southern fortunes are so uncertain: the white part of the property\r\n(that is to say, the cotton) varies with the seasons; and the black part\r\ntakes to itself legs, and runs off occasionally. But, at any rate, there\r\nis quite enough to make her a great prize, and an object of admiration\r\nand attention to all the little men--not to the old hands, like White\r\nand Sumner; they are built up in their own conceit, and wouldn't marry\r\nSam Weller's 'female marchioness,' unless she made love to them first,\r\nlike one of Knowles's heroines. But the juveniles are crazy about her.\r\nRobinson went off more ostentatiously love-sick than a man of his size I\r\never saw; and Sedley is always chanting her praises--the only man,\r\nwoman, or child, he was ever known to speak well of. I don't think any\r\nof them will catch her. Edwards might dance into her heart, perhaps, if\r\nhe were a little bigger; but as it is, she will, probably, make happy\r\nand rich some one in her own part of the world. She says the young men\r\nthere suit her better, because they are 'more gentlemanly' than we\r\nNortherners.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard many strangers say the same thing,\" said Ashburner,\r\nprudently refraining from expressing any opinion of his own for he knew\r\nBenson's anti-southern feelings.\r\n\r\n\"If education has any thing to do with being a gentleman, then, whether\r\nyou take _education_ in the highest sense, as the best discipline and\r\nexpansion of the mind by classical and scientific study; or in the\r\nutilitarian sense, as the acquisition of useful knowledge, and a\r\npractical acquaintance with men and things; or in the fine lady sense,\r\nas the mastery of airs, and graces, and drawing-room accomplishments; or\r\nin the moralist's sense, as the curbing of our mischievous propensities,\r\nand the energizing of our good ones--in every case, we are more of\r\ngentlemen than the Southerners. If the mere possession of wealth, and\r\nprogress in the grosser and more material arts of civilization, have any\r\nthing to do with it, then, too, we are more of gentlemen. Their claims\r\nrest on two grounds: first, they live on the unpaid labor of others,\r\nwhile we all work, more or less, for ourselves, holding idleness as\r\ndisgraceful as they do labor; secondly, they are all the time fighting\r\nduels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there no duels ever fought in this part of the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely any since Burr shot Hamilton. Alexander Hamilton was one of\r\nour greatest men, and his death excited a feeling throughout the\r\nNorthern States which put down the practice almost entirely; and I\r\ncertainly think it a step forward in real civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that it is with you as with us, where, if a man\r\nbecomes so involved in a quarrel that he is challenged, it is against\r\nhim and almost ruin to him whether he fights or does not fight? Or is\r\npublic opinion decidedly in favor of the man who does not fight, and\r\nagainst the man who does? For instance, suppose you were challenged\r\nyourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man can't say beforehand what he would do in an emergency of the\r\nkind; but my impression is that I should not fight, and that the opinion\r\nof society would bear me out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose a man insulted your wife or sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is next door to impossible that an American gentleman should do such\r\na thing; but if he did, I should consider that he had reduced himself to\r\nthe level of a snob, and should treat him as I would any snob in the\r\nstreets,--knock him down, if I was able; and if I wasn't, take the law\r\nof him: and if a man had wronged me irreparably, I fancy I should do as\r\nthese uncivilized Southerners themselves do in such a case,--shoot him\r\ndown in the street, wherever I could catch him. What sense or justice is\r\nthere in a duel? It is as if a man stole your coat, and instead of\r\nhaving him put into prison, you drew lots with him whether you or he\r\nshould go.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose a man was spreading false reports about you; suppose he\r\nsaid you were no gentleman, or that you had cheated somebody?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" replied Benson, dexterously evading the most important part of\r\nthe question, \"if I were to fight all the people that spread false\r\nreports about me, I should have my hands full. There is a man in this\r\nroom that slandered me as grossly as he could four years ago, and was\r\nvery near breaking off my marriage. That fat man there, with all the\r\njewelry--Storey Hunter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the other, really surprised, for he had just seen\r\nMrs. Benson conversing with the ponderous exquisite, apparently on most\r\namicable terms.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it was entirely gratuitous. I never gave the scamp any\r\nprovocation. By Jupiter!\" Benson turned very white and then very red,\r\n\"if he isn't dancing with my wife! His impudence is too much, and----. I\r\nbelieve one of our women would put up with any thing from a man here if\r\nhe can only dance well. They have no self-respect.\"\r\n\r\nBenson appeared to have very little himself at that moment, and not to\r\ncare much what he said or did. He trembled all over with rage, and his\r\nfriend expected to see an immediate outbreak; but, as if recollecting\r\nhimself, he suddenly stammered out something about the necessity of\r\nchanging his boots, and limped off accordingly for that purpose. He was\r\nnot gone more than five minutes, but in that time had contrived not only\r\nto supply his pedal deficiency, but also to take a drink by way of\r\ncalming himself; and after the drink he took a turn with Miss Friskin,\r\nand whirled her about the room, till he knocked over two or three\r\ninnocent bystanders, all of which tended very much to compose his\r\nfeelings. Ashburner had a presentiment that something would happen, and\r\nstayed longer that night than his wont; indeed, till the end of the\r\nball, which, as there was now no German cotillion, lasted till only one\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nBut the universal panacea of the polka had its mollifying effect on\r\nBenson, and every thing might have passed off quietly but for an unlucky\r\naccident. Some of the young Southerners had ordered up sundry bottles of\r\nchampagne, and were drinking the same in a corner. Hunter, who was much\r\ngiven to toadying Southerners (another reason for Benson's dislike of\r\nhim), mingled among them, and partook of the inspiring beverage. _In\r\nvino veritas_ is true as gospel, if you understand it rightly as meaning\r\nthat wine develops a man's real nature. Hunter, being by nature gossipy\r\nand mendacious, waxed more and more so with every glass of Heidseck he\r\ntook down. Ashburner chancing to pass near the group, had his attention\r\narrested by hearing Benson's name. He stopped, and listened: Hunter was\r\ngoing on with a prolix and somewhat confused story of some horse that\r\nBenson had sold to somebody, in which transaction Sumner was somehow\r\nmixed up, and the horse hadn't turned out well, and the purchaser wasn't\r\nsatisfied, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"If Benson hear this!\" thought Ashburner.\r\n\r\nAnd Benson did hear it very promptly, for Sedley was within ear-shot,\r\nand, delighted at having a piece of mischief to communicate, he tracked\r\nHarry out at the further extremity of the room, to inform him of the\r\nliberties Storey Hunter was taking with his name. Whereupon the\r\nslandered one, with all his wrath reawakened, traversed the apartment in\r\ntime to hear the emphatic peroration that, \"bad as Sumner was, Benson\r\nwas a thousand times worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand this,\" exclaimed he. \"Where is Frank Sumner?\" Sumner was\r\nnot visible. \"Ashburner, will you stand by me if there's a row?\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the ball was breaking up, and Benson, on going back to look\r\nfor his party, found that Mrs. B., like a true watering-place _belle_,\r\nhad gone off without waiting for him. This was exactly what he wanted.\r\nKeeping his eye on Hunter, he followed him out to the head of the\r\nstaircase, where he had just been bidding good night to some ladies. No\r\none was in sight but Ashburner, who happened to be standing just outside\r\nthe door-way. The fat man nodded to Harry as if they had been the best\r\nfriends in the world.\r\n\r\n\"Curse his impudence!\" exclaimed Benson, now fairly boiling over.\r\n\"Holloa, you Hunter! did you know you were an infernal scoundrel?\r\nBecause you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" quoth the individual in question, half sobered and half\r\ndisconcerted by this unceremonious address.\r\n\r\n\"And a contemptible blackguard,\" continued Benson, following up his\r\nverbal attack.\r\n\r\n\"You're another,\" retorted Hunter.\r\n\r\nAshburner wondered if the two men were going to stand slanging each\r\nother all night.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have pulled your nose three years ago, and now take that!\"\r\nand Benson, who had been working at his glove ever since the parley\r\nbegan, twitched it off and slapped Hunter in the face with it.\r\n\r\nWhen an Irishman sees two people fighting, or going to fight, his\r\nnatural impulse is to urge them on. A Scotchman or an American tries to\r\npart them. A Frenchman runs after the armed force. An Englishman does\r\nnothing but look quietly on, unless one side meets with foul play. Thus\r\nit was with Ashburner in the present instance. He took Benson's request\r\n\"to stand by him in case of a row,\" _au pied de la lettre_. He stood by\r\nhim, and that was all.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hunter felt the glove in his face he struck out at Benson,\r\nwho stopped the blow very neatly, and seemed about to return it with a\r\nleft-hander; then suddenly changing his style of attack, he rushed\r\nwithin the other's guard, and catching him by the throat with both\r\nhands, did his best to strangle him. Hunter, unable to call for help or\r\nto loosen the throttling grasp of his assailant, threw himself bodily\r\nupon him. As he was about twice Benson's size and weight, the experiment\r\nsucceeded. Harry was thrown off his feet and precipitated against the\r\nbanisters, which being of slight material, gave way like so much paper,\r\nand both men tumbled over into the landing-place below amid a great\r\nscattering of splinters. Lighting on their feet, they began to pummel\r\neach other without doing more damage than a couple of children, for they\r\nwere at such close quarters and so blinded by rage that they hit wild;\r\nbut Benson had caught his man by the throat again and was just getting\r\nhim into chancery, when White, Sedley, and some of the Southerners,\r\nattracted by the noise, ran down stairs, calling on the \"gentlemen\" to\r\n\"behave as such,\" and words proving ineffectual, endeavoring to pull\r\nthem apart; which was no easy matter, for Benson hung on like grim\r\ndeath, and when his hand was removed from Hunter's collar, caught him\r\nagain by the nose, nor would he give up till Mr. Simson, who was one of\r\nthe stoutest and most active men in the place, caught him up from behind\r\nand fairly carried him off to the hall below. Then he seemed to come to\r\nhimself all at once, and recollected that he had invited the remains of\r\n\"our set\" to supper that night. And accordingly, after taking a rapid\r\nsurvey of himself in a glass, and finding that his face bore no mark of\r\nthe conflict, and that his dress was not more disordered than a man's\r\nusually is when he has been polkaing all the evening, he went off to\r\nmeet his company, and a very merry time they had of it. Ashburner was\r\nsurprised to find that the spectators of the fray were able to ignore it\r\nso completely. If they had been old men and old soldiers, they could not\r\nhave acted with more discretion, and it was impossible to suspect from\r\ntheir conversation or manner that any thing unpleasant had occurred.\r\n\"These people do know how to hold their tongues sometimes,\" thought he.\r\n\r\nNext morning while strolling about before breakfast (he was the earliest\r\nriser of the young men in the place, as he did not dance or gamble), he\r\nheard firing in the pistol-gallery. He thought of his conversation with\r\nBenson and the occurrences of last night, and then recollected that he\r\nwas out of practice himself, and that there would be no harm in trying a\r\nfew shots. So he strode over to the gallery, and there, to his\r\nastonishment, found on one side of the door the keeper, on the other\r\nFrank Sumner (who had given a most devoted proof of friendship by\r\ngetting up two hours earlier in the morning than he had ever been known\r\nto do before); and between them Benson, blazing away at the figure, and\r\nswearing at himself for not making better shots.\r\n\r\n\"Take time by the forelock, you see,\" said he as he recognized\r\nAshburner. \"_Nunquam non paratus_. The fellow will send me a challenge\r\nthis morning, I suppose, and I want to be ready for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know,\" said the Englishman, \"if after this you should kill\r\nyour man, we in our country would call it something very like murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" answered Harry, as he let fly again, this time ringing\r\nthe bell; \"but we only call it practice.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, in his Diary, states, that out of eight prominent members of\r\nthe Boston bar in 1763, with whom he was one evening discussing the\r\nencroachments of England upon the colonies, only one, Adams himself,\r\nlived through the Revolution, as an advocate of American independence.\r\nFive adhered to Great Britain: Gridley, Auchmuty, Fitch, Kent, and\r\nHutchinson. Thatcher died in 1765, and Otis became incapacitated in\r\n1771.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Colburn's New Monthly Magazine\r\n\r\nTHE TWIN SISTERS.\r\n\r\nA TRUE STORY.\r\n\r\nBY W. WILKIE COLLINS, AUTHOR OF \"ANTONINA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those who attended the first of the King's _levées_, during the\r\nLondon season of 18--, was an unmarried gentleman of large fortune,\r\nnamed Streatfield. While his carriage was proceeding slowly down St.\r\nJames's Street, he naturally sought such amusement and occupation as he\r\ncould find in looking on the brilliant scene around him. The day was\r\nunusually fine; crowds of spectators thronged the street and the\r\nbalconies of the houses on either side, all gazing at the different\r\nequipages with as eager a curiosity and interest, as if fine vehicles\r\nand fine people inside them were the rarest objects of contemplation in\r\nthe whole metropolis. Proceeding at a slower and slower pace, Mr.\r\nStreatfield's carriage had just arrived at the middle of the street,\r\nwhen a longer stoppage than usual occurred. He looked carelessly up at\r\nthe nearest balcony; and there among some eight or ten ladies, all\r\nstrangers to him, he saw one face that riveted his attention\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHe had never beheld any thing so beautiful, any thing which struck him\r\nwith such strange, mingled, and sudden sensations, as this face. He\r\ngazed and gazed on it, hardly knowing where he was, or what he was\r\ndoing, until the line of vehicles began again to move on. Then--after\r\nfirst ascertaining the number of the house--he flung himself back in the\r\ncarriage, and tried to examine his own feelings, to reason himself into\r\nself-possession; but it was all in vain. He was seized with that amiable\r\nform of social monomania, called \"love at first sight.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered the palace, greeted his friends, and performed all the\r\nnecessary Court ceremonies, feeling the whole time like a man in a\r\ntrance. He spoke mechanically, and moved mechanically--the lovely face\r\nin the balcony occupied his thoughts, to the exclusion of every thing\r\nelse. On his return home, he had engagements for the afternoon and the\r\nevening--he forgot and broke them all; and walked back to St. James's\r\nStreet as soon as he had changed his dress.\r\n\r\nThe balcony was empty; the sight-seers, who had filled it but a few\r\nhours before, had departed--but obstacles of all sorts now tended only\r\nto stimulate Mr. Streatfield; he was determined to ascertain the\r\nparentage of the young lady, determined to look on the lovely face\r\nagain--the thermometer of his heart had risen already to Fever Heat!\r\nWithout loss of time, the shopkeeper to whom the house belonged was\r\nbribed to loquacity by a purchase. All that he could tell, in answer to\r\ninquiries, was that he had let his lodgings to an elderly gentleman and\r\nhis wife, from the country, who had asked some friends into their\r\nbalcony to see the carriages go to the _levée_. Nothing daunted, Mr.\r\nStreatfield questioned and questioned again. What was the old\r\ngentleman's name?--Dimsdale.--Could he see Mr. Dimsdale's servant?--The\r\nobsequious shopkeeper had no doubt that he could: Mr. Dimsdale's servant\r\nshould be sent for immediately.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the servant, the all-important link in the chain of\r\nLove's evidence, made his appearance. He was a pompous, portly man, who\r\nlistened with solemn attention, with a stern judicial calmness, to Mr.\r\nStreatfield's rapid and somewhat confused inquiries, which were\r\naccompanied by a minute description of the young lady, and by several\r\nexplanatory statements, all very fictitious, and all very plausible.\r\nStupid as the servant was, and suspicious as all stupid people are, he\r\nhad nevertheless sense enough to perceive that he was addressed by a\r\ngentleman, and gratitude enough to feel considerably mollified by the\r\nhandsome _douceur_ which was slipped into his hand. After much pondering\r\nand doubting, he at last arrived at the conclusion that the fair object\r\nof Mr. Streatfield's inquiries was a Miss Langley, who had joined the\r\nparty in the balcony that morning, with her sister; and who was the\r\ndaughter of Mr. Langley, of Langley Hall, in ----shire. The family were\r\nnow staying in London, at ---- Street. More information than this, the\r\nservant stated that he could not afford--he was certain that he had made\r\nno mistake, for the Miss Langleys were the only very young ladies in the\r\nhouse that morning--however, if Mr. Streatfield wished to speak to his\r\nmaster, he was ready to carry any message with which he might be\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Streatfield had already heard enough for his purpose, and\r\ndeparted at once for his club, determined to discover some means of\r\nbeing introduced in due form to Miss Langley, before he slept that\r\nnight--though he should travel round the whole circle of his\r\nacquaintance--high and low, rich and poor--in making the attempt.\r\nArrived at the club, he began to inquire resolutely, in all directions,\r\nfor a friend who knew Mr. Langley, of Langley Hall. He disturbed\r\ngastronomic gentlemen at their dinner; he interrupted agricultural\r\ngentlemen who were moaning over the prospects of the harvest; he\r\nstartled literary gentlemen who were deep in the critical mysteries of\r\nthe last Review; he invaded billiard-room, dressing-room, smoking-room;\r\nhe was more like a frantic ministerial whipper-in, hunting up stray\r\nmembers for a division, than an ordinary man; and the oftener he was\r\ndefeated in his object, the more determined he was to succeed. At last,\r\njust as he had vainly inquired of every body that he knew, just as he\r\nwas standing in the hall of the clubhouse thinking where he should go\r\nnext, a friend entered, who at once relieved him of all his\r\ndifficulties--a precious, an estimable man, who was on intimate terms\r\nwith Mr. Langley, and had been lately staying at Langley Hall. To this\r\nfriend all the lover's cares and anxieties were at once confided; and a\r\nfitter depositary for such secrets of the heart could hardly have been\r\nfound. He made no jokes--for he was not a bachelor; he abstained from\r\nshaking his head and recommending prudence--for he was not a seasoned\r\nhusband, or an experienced widower; what he really did was to enter\r\nheart and soul into his friend's projects--for he was precisely in that\r\nposition, the only position, in which the male sex generally take a\r\nproper interest in match-making: he was a newly married man.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, Mr. Streatfield was the happiest of mortals--he was\r\nintroduced to the lady of his love--to Miss Jane Langley. He really\r\nenjoyed the priceless privilege of looking again on the face in the\r\nbalcony, and looking on it almost as often as he wished. It was perfect\r\nElysium. Mr. and Mrs. Langley saw little or no company--Miss Jane was\r\nalways accessible, never monopolized--the light of her beauty shone, day\r\nafter day, for her adorer alone; and his love blossomed in it, fast as\r\nflowers in a hot-house. Passing quickly by all the minor details of the\r\nwooing to arrive the sooner at the grand fact of the winning, let us\r\nsimply relate that Mr. Streatfield's object in seeking an introduction\r\nto Mr. Langley was soon explained, and was indeed visible enough long\r\nbefore the explanation. He was a handsome man, an accomplished man, and\r\na rich man. His two first qualifications conquered the daughter, and his\r\nthird the father. In six weeks Mr. Streatfield was the accepted suitor\r\nof Miss Jane Langley.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-day was fixed--it was arranged that the marriage should take\r\nplace at Langley Hall, whither the family proceeded, leaving the\r\nunwilling lover in London, a prey to all the inexorable business\r\nformalities of the occasion. For ten days did the ruthless\r\nlawyers--those dead weights that burden the back of Hymen--keep their\r\nvictim imprisoned in the metropolis, occupied over settlements that\r\nnever seemed likely to be settled. But even the long march of the law\r\nhas its end like other mortal things: at the expiration of the ten days\r\nall was completed, and Mr. Streatfield found himself at liberty to start\r\nfor Langley Hall.\r\n\r\nA large party was assembled at the house to grace the approaching\r\nnuptials. There were to be _tableaux_, charades, boating-trips,\r\nriding-excursions, amusements of all sorts--the whole to conclude (in\r\nthe play-bill phrase) with the grand climax of the wedding. Mr.\r\nStreatfield arrived late; dinner was ready: he had barely time to dress,\r\nand then bustle into the drawing-room, just as the guests were leaving\r\nit, to offer his arm to Miss Jane--all greetings with friends and\r\nintroductions to strangers being postponed till the party met round the\r\ndining-table.\r\n\r\nGrace had been said; the covers were taken off; the loud, cheerful hum\r\nof conversation was just beginning, when Mr. Streatfield's eyes met the\r\neyes of a young lady who was seated opposite, at the table. The guests\r\nnear him, observing at the same moment, that he continued standing after\r\nevery one else had been placed, glanced at him inquiringly. To their\r\nastonishment and alarm, they observed that his face had suddenly become\r\ndeadly pale--his rigid features looked struck by paralysis. Several of\r\nhis friends spoke to him; but for the first few moments he returned no\r\nanswer. Then, still fixing his eyes upon the young lady opposite, he\r\nabruptly exclaimed, in a voice, the altered tones of which startled\r\nevery one who heard him:--\"_That_ is the face I saw in the\r\nbalcony!--_that_ woman is the only woman I can ever marry!\" The next\r\ninstant, without a word more of either explanation or apology, he\r\nhurried from the room.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the guests mechanically started up, as if to follow him;\r\nthe rest remained at the table, looking on each other in speechless\r\nsurprise. But before any one could either act or speak, almost at the\r\nmoment when the door closed on Mr. Streatfield, the attention of all was\r\npainfully directed to Jane Langley. She had fainted. Her mother and\r\nsisters removed her from the room immediately, aided by the servants. As\r\nthey disappeared, a dead silence again sank down over the company--they\r\nall looked around with one accord to the master of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Langley's face and manner sufficiently revealed the suffering and\r\nsuspense that he was secretly enduring. But he was a man of the\r\nworld--neither by word nor action did he betray what was passing within\r\nhim. He resumed his place at the table, and begged his guests to do the\r\nsame. He affected to make light of what had happened; entreated every\r\none to forget it, or, if they remembered it at all, to remember it only\r\nas a mere accident which would no doubt be satisfactorily explained.\r\nPerhaps it was only a jest on Mr. Streatfield's part--rather too serious\r\na one, he must own. At any rate, whatever was the cause of the\r\ninterruption to the dinner which had just happened, it was not important\r\nenough to require every body to fast around the table of the feast. He\r\nasked it as a favor to himself, that no further notice might be taken of\r\nwhat had occurred. While Mr. Langley was speaking thus, he hastily wrote\r\na few lines on a piece of paper, and gave it to one of the servants. The\r\nnote was directed to Mr. Streatfield; the lines contained only these\r\nwords:--\"Two hours hence, I shall expect to see you alone in the\r\nlibrary.\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner proceeded; the places occupied by the female members of the\r\nLangley family, and by the young lady who had attracted Mr.\r\nStreatfield's notice in so extraordinary a manner, being left vacant.\r\nEvery one present endeavored to follow Mr. Langley's advice, and go\r\nthrough the business of the dinner, as if nothing had occurred; but the\r\nattempt failed miserably. Long, blank pauses occurred in the\r\nconversation; general topics were started, but never pursued; it was\r\nmore like an assembly of strangers, than a meeting of friends; people\r\nneither ate nor drank, as they were accustomed to eat and drink; they\r\ntalked in altered voices, and sat with unusual stillness, even in the\r\nsame positions. Relatives, friends, and acquaintances, all alike\r\nperceived that some great domestic catastrophe had happened; all\r\nforeboded that some serious, if not fatal, explanation of Mr.\r\nStreatfield's conduct would ensue: and it was vain and hopeless--a very\r\nmockery of self-possession--to attempt to shake off the sinister and\r\nchilling influences that recent events had left behind them, and resume\r\nat will the thoughtlessness and hilarity of ordinary life.\r\n\r\nStill, however, Mr. Langley persisted in doing the honors of his table,\r\nin proceeding doggedly through all the festive ceremonies of the hour,\r\nuntil the ladies rose and retired. Then, after looking at his watch, he\r\nbeckoned to one of his sons to take his place; and quietly left the\r\nroom. He only stopped once, as he crossed the hall, to ask news of his\r\ndaughter from one of the servants. The reply was, that she had had a\r\nhysterical fit; that the medical attendant of the family had been sent\r\nfor; and that since his arrival she had become more composed. When the\r\nman had spoken, Mr. Langley made no remark, but proceeded at once to the\r\nlibrary. He locked the door behind him, as soon as he entered the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Streatfield was already waiting there--he was seated at the table,\r\nendeavoring to maintain an appearance of composure, by mechanically\r\nturning over the leaves of the books before him. Mr. Langley drew a\r\nchair near him; and in low, but very firm tones, began the conversation\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"I have given you two hours, sir, to collect yourself, to consider your\r\nposition fully--I presume, therefore, that you are now prepared to favor\r\nme with an explanation of your conduct at my table, to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What explanation can I make?--what can I say, or think of this most\r\nterrible of fatalities?\" exclaimed Mr. Streatfield, speaking faintly and\r\nconfusedly; and still not looking up--\"There has been an unexampled\r\nerror committed!--a fatal mistake, which I could never have anticipated,\r\nand over which I had no control!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, sir, of the language of romance,\" interrupted Mr. Langley,\r\ncoldly; \"I am neither of an age nor a disposition to appreciate it. I\r\ncome here to ask plain questions honestly, and I insist, as my right, on\r\nreceiving answers in the same spirit. _You_, Mr. Streatfield, sought an\r\nintroduction to _me_--you professed yourself attached to my daughter\r\nJane--your proposals were (I fear unhappily for _us_) accepted--your\r\nwedding-day was fixed--and now, after all this, when you happen to\r\nobserve my daughter's twin-sister sitting opposite to you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Her twin-sister!\" exclaimed Mr. Streatfield; and his trembling hand\r\ncrumpled the leaves of the book, which he still held while he spoke.\r\n\"Why is it, intimate as I have been with your family, that I now know\r\nfor the first time that Miss Jane Langley has a twin-sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you descend, sir, to a subterfuge, when I ask you for an\r\nexplanation?\" returned Mr. Langley, angrily. \"You must have heard, over\r\nand over again, that my children, Jane and Clara, were twins.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word and honor, I declare that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare me all appeals to your word or your honor, sir; I am beginning to\r\ndoubt both.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not make the unhappy situation in which we are all placed, still\r\nworse, by answering your last words, as I might, at other times, feel\r\ninclined to answer them,\" said Mr. Streatfield, assuming a calmer\r\ndemeanor than he had hitherto displayed. \"I tell you the truth, when I\r\ntell you that, before to-day, I never knew that any of your children\r\nwere twins. Your daughter Jane has frequently spoken to me of her absent\r\nsister Clara, but never spoke to me of her as her twin-sister. Until\r\nto-day, I have had no opportunity of discovering the truth; for until\r\nto-day, I have never met Miss Clara Langley since I saw her in the\r\nbalcony of the house in St. James's street. The only one of your\r\nchildren who was never present during my intercourse with your family in\r\nLondon, was your daughter Clara--the daughter whom I now know, for the\r\nfirst time, as the young lady who really arrested my attention on my way\r\nto the _levée_--whose affections it was really my object to win in\r\nseeking an introduction to you. To _me_, the resemblance between the\r\ntwin-sisters has been a fatal resemblance; the long absence of one, a\r\nfatal absence.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause, as Mr. Streatfield sadly and calmly\r\npronounced the last words. Mr. Langley appeared to be absorbed in\r\nthought. At length he proceeded, speaking to himself:--\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ strange! I remember that Clara left London on the day of the\r\n_levée_, to set out on a visit to her aunt; and only returned here two\r\ndays since, to be present at her sister's marriage. Well, sir,\" he\r\ncontinued, addressing Mr. Streatfield, \"granting what you say, granting\r\nthat we all mentioned my absent daughter to you, as we are accustomed to\r\nmention her among ourselves, simply as 'Clara,' you have still not\r\nexcused your conduct in my eyes. Remarkable as the resemblance is\r\nbetween the sisters, more remarkable even, I am willing to admit, than\r\nthe resemblance usually is between twins, there is yet a difference,\r\nwhich, slight, indescribable though it may be, is nevertheless\r\ndiscernible to all their relations and to all their friends. How is it\r\nthat you, who represent yourself as so vividly impressed by your first\r\nsight of my daughter Clara, did not discover the error when you were\r\nintroduced to her sister Jane, as the lady who had so much attracted\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, sir,\" rejoined Mr. Streatfield, \"that I have never beheld\r\nthe sisters together until to-day. Though both were in the balcony when\r\nI first looked up at it, it was Miss Clara Langley alone who attracted\r\nmy attention. Had I only received the smallest hint that the absent\r\nsister of Miss Jane Langley was her _twin-sister_, I would have seen\r\nher, at any sacrifice, before making my proposals. For it is my duty to\r\nconfess to you, Mr. Langley (with the candor which is your undoubted\r\ndue), that when I was first introduced to your daughter Jane, I felt an\r\nunaccountable impression that she was the same as, and yet different\r\nfrom, the lady whom I had seen in the balcony. Soon, however, this\r\nimpression wore off. Under the circumstances, could I regard it as any\r\nthing but a mere caprice, a lover's wayward fancy? I dismissed it from\r\nmy mind; it ceased to affect me, until to-day, when I first discovered\r\nthat it was a warning which I had most unhappily disregarded; that a\r\nterrible error had been committed, for which no one of us was to blame,\r\nbut which was fraught with misery, undeserved misery, to us all!\"\r\n\r\n\"These, Mr. Streatfield, are explanations which may satisfy _you_,\" said\r\nMr. Langley, in a milder tone, \"but they cannot satisfy _me_; they will\r\nnot satisfy the world. You have repudiated, in the most public and most\r\nabrupt manner, an engagement, in the fulfilment of which the honor and\r\nthe happiness of my family are concerned. You have given me reasons for\r\nyour conduct, it is true; but will those reasons restore to my daughter\r\nthe tranquillity which she has lost, perhaps for ever? Will they stop\r\nthe whisperings of calumny? Will they carry conviction to those\r\nstrangers to me, or enemies of mine, whose pleasure it may be to\r\ndisbelieve them? You have placed both yourself and me, sir, in a\r\nposition of embarrassment--nay, a position of danger and disgrace, from\r\nwhich the strongest reasons and the best excuses cannot extricate us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you to believe,\" replied Mr. Streatfield, \"that I deplore\r\nfrom my heart the error--the fault, if you will--of which I have been\r\nunconsciously guilty. I implore your pardon, both for what I said and\r\ndid at your table to-day; but I cannot do more. I cannot and I dare not\r\npronounce the marriage vows to your daughter, with my lips, when I know\r\nthat neither my conscience nor my heart can ratify them. The commonest\r\njustice, and the commonest respect towards a young lady who deserves\r\nboth, and more than both, from every one who approaches her, strengthen\r\nme to persevere in the only course which it is consistent with honor and\r\nintegrity for me to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to forget,\" said Mr. Langley, \"that it is not merely your\r\nown honor, but the honor of others, that is to be considered in the\r\ncourse of conduct which you are now to pursue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have by no means forgotten what is due to _you_,\" continued Mr.\r\nStreatfield, \"or what responsibilities I have incurred from the nature\r\nof my intercourse with your family. Do I put too much trust in your\r\nforbearance, if I now assure you, candidly and unreservedly, that I\r\nstill place all my hopes of happiness in the prospect of becoming\r\nconnected by marriage with a daughter of yours? Miss Clara Langley--\"\r\n\r\nHere the speaker paused. His position was becoming a delicate and a\r\ndangerous one; but he made no effort to withdraw from it. Almost\r\nbewildered by the pressing and perilous emergency of the moment,\r\nharassed by such a tumult of conflicting emotions within him as he had\r\nnever known before, he risked the worst, with all the blindfold\r\ndesperation of love. The angry flush was rising on Mr. Langley's cheek;\r\nit was evidently costing him a severe struggle to retain his assumed\r\nself-possession; but he did not speak. After an interval, Mr.\r\nStreatfield proceeded thus:--\r\n\r\n\"However unfortunately I may express myself, I am sure you will do me\r\nthe justice to believe that I am now speaking from my heart on a subject\r\n(to _me_) of the most vital importance. Place yourself in my situation,\r\nconsider all that has happened, consider that this may be, for aught I\r\nknow to the contrary, the last opportunity I may have of pleading my\r\ncause; and then say whether it is possible for me to conceal from you\r\nthat I can only look to your forbearance and sympathy for permission to\r\nretrieve my error, to--to--Mr. Langley! I cannot choose expressions at\r\nsuch a moment as this. I can only tell you that the feeling with which I\r\nregarded your daughter Clara, when I first saw her, still remains what\r\nit was. I cannot analyze it; I cannot reconcile its apparent\r\ninconsistencies and contradictions; I cannot explain how, while I may\r\nseem to you and to every one to have varied and vacillated with insolent\r\ncaprice, I have really remained, in my own heart and to my own\r\nconscience, true to my first sensations and my first convictions. I can\r\nonly implore you not to condemn me to a life of disappointment and\r\nmisery, by judging me with hasty irritation. Favor me, so far at least,\r\nas to relate the conversation which has passed between us to your two\r\ndaughters. Let me hear how it affects each of them towards me. Let me\r\nknow what they are willing to think and ready to do under such\r\nunparalleled circumstances as have now occurred. I will wait _your_\r\ntime, and _their_ time; I will abide by _your_ decision and _their_\r\ndecision, pronounced after the first poignant distress and irritation of\r\nthis day's events have passed over.\"\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Langley remained silent; the angry word was on his tongue; the\r\ncontemptuous rejection of what he regarded for the moment as a\r\nproposition equally ill-timed and insolent, seemed bursting to his lips;\r\nbut once more he restrained himself. He rose from his seat, and walked\r\nslowly backwards and forwards, deep in thought. Mr. Streatfield was too\r\nmuch overcome by his own agitation to plead his cause further by another\r\nword. There was a silence in the room now, which lasted for some time.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Mr. Langley was a man of the world. He was strongly\r\nattached to his children; but he had a little of the selfishness and\r\nmuch of the reverence for wealth of a man of the world. As he now\r\nendeavored to determine mentally on his proper course of action--to\r\ndisentangle the whole case from all its mysterious intricacies--to view\r\nit, extraordinary as it was, in its proper bearings, his thoughts began\r\ngradually to assume what is called, \"a practical turn.\" He reflected\r\nthat he had another daughter, besides the twin-sisters, to provide for;\r\nand that he had two sons to settle in life. He was not rich enough to\r\nportion three daughters; and he had not interest enough to start his\r\nsons favorably in a career of eminence. Mr. Streatfield, on the\r\ncontrary, was a man of great wealth, and of great \"connections\" among\r\npeople in power. Was such a son-in-law to be rejected, even after all\r\nthat had happened, without at least consulting his wife and daughters\r\nfirst? He thought not. Had not Mr. Streatfield, in truth, been the\r\nvictim of a remarkable fatality, of an incredible accident, and were no\r\nallowances, under such circumstances, to be made for him? He began to\r\nthink there were. Reflecting thus, he determined at length to proceed\r\nwith moderation and caution at all hazards; and regained composure\r\nenough to continue the conversation in a cold, but still in a polite\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"I will commit myself, sir, to no agreement or promise whatever,\" he\r\nbegan, \"nor will I consider this interview in any respect as a\r\nconclusive one, either on your side or mine; but if I think, on\r\nconsideration, that it is desirable that our conversation should be\r\nrepeated to my wife and daughters, I will make them acquainted with it,\r\nand will let you know the result. In the mean time, I think you will\r\nagree with me, that it is most fit that the next communications between\r\nus should take place by letter alone.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Streatfield was not slow in taking the hint conveyed by Mr.\r\nLangley'a last words. After what had occurred, and until something was\r\ndefinitely settled, he felt that the suffering and suspense which he was\r\nalready enduring would be increased tenfold if he remained longer in the\r\nsame house with the twin sisters--the betrothed of one, the lover of the\r\nother! Murmuring a few inaudible words of acquiescence in the\r\narrangement which had just been proposed to him, he left the room. The\r\nsame evening he quitted Langley Hall.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the remainder of the guests departed, their curiosity\r\nto know all the particulars of what had happened remaining ungratified.\r\nThey were simply informed that an extraordinary and unexpected obstacle\r\nhad arisen to delay the wedding; that no blame attached to any one in\r\nthe matter; and that as soon as every thing had been finally determined,\r\nevery thing would be explained. Until then, it was not considered\r\nnecessary to enter in any way into particulars. By the middle of the day\r\nevery visitor had left the house; and a strange and melancholy spectacle\r\nit presented when they were all gone. Rooms were now empty and silent,\r\nwhich the day before had been filled with animated groups, and had\r\nechoed with merry laughter. In one apartment, the fittings for the\r\nseries of \"Tableaux\" which had been proposed, remained half completed:\r\nthe dresses that were to have been worn, lay scattered on the floor; the\r\ncarpenter who had come to proceed with his work, gathered up his tools\r\nin ominous silence, and departed as quickly as he could. Here lay books\r\nstill open at the last page read; there was an album, with the drawing\r\nof the day before unfinished, and the color-box unclosed by its side. On\r\nthe deserted billiard-table, the positions of the \"cues\" and balls\r\nshowed traces of an interrupted game. Flowers were scattered on the\r\nrustic tables in the garden, half made into nosegays, and beginning to\r\nwither already. The very dogs wandered in a moody, unsettled way about\r\nthe house, missing the friendly hands that had fondled and fed them for\r\nso many days past, and whining impatiently in the deserted\r\ndrawing-rooms. The social desolation of the scene was miserably complete\r\nin all its aspects.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the departure of his guests, Mr. Langley had a long\r\ninterview with his wife. He repeated to her the conversation which had\r\ntaken place between Mr. Streatfield and himself, and received from her\r\nin return such an account of the conduct of his daughter, under the\r\ntrial that had befallen her, as filled him with equal astonishment and\r\nadmiration. It was a new revelation to him of the character of his own\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the violent symptoms had subsided,\" said Mrs. Langley, in\r\nanswer to her husband's first inquiries, \"as soon as the hysterical fit\r\nwas subdued, Jane seemed suddenly to assume a new character, to become\r\nanother person. She begged that the Doctor might be released from his\r\nattendance, and that she might be left alone with me and with her sister\r\nClara. When every one else had quitted the room, she continued to sit in\r\nthe easy-chair where we had at first placed her, covering her face with\r\nher hands. She entreated us not to speak to her for a short time, and,\r\nexcept that she shuddered occasionally, sat quite still and silent. When\r\nshe at last looked up, we were shocked to see the deadly paleness of her\r\nface, and the strange alteration that had come over her expression; but\r\nshe spoke to us so coherently, so solemnly even, that we were amazed; we\r\nknew not what to think or what to do; it hardly seemed to be _our_ Jane\r\nwho was now speaking to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\" asked Mr. Langley, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"She said that the first feeling of her heart, at that moment, was\r\ngratitude on her own account. She thanked God that the terrible\r\ndiscovery had not been made too late, when her married life might have\r\nbeen a life of estrangement and misery. Up to the moment when Mr.\r\nStreatfield had uttered that one fatal exclamation, she had loved him,\r\nshe told us, fondly and fervently; _now_, no explanation, no repentance\r\n(if either were tendered), no earthly persuasion or command (in case\r\nMr. Streatfield should think himself bound, as a matter of atonement, to\r\nhold to his rash engagement), could ever induce her to become his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Streatfield will not test her resolution,\" said Mr. Langley,\r\nbitterly; \"he deliberately repeated his repudiation of his engagement in\r\nthis room; nay, more, he--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have something important to say to you from Jane on this point,\"\r\ninterrupted Mrs. Langley. \"After she had spoken the first few words\r\nwhich I have already repeated to you, she told us that she had been\r\nthinking--thinking more calmly perhaps than we could imagine--on all\r\nthat had happened; on what Mr. Streatfield had said at the dinner-table;\r\non the momentary glance of recognition which she had seen pass between\r\nhim and her sister Clara, whose accidental absence, during the whole\r\nperiod of Mr. Streatfield's intercourse with us in London, she now\r\nremembered and reminded me of. The cause of the fatal error, and the\r\nmanner in which it had occurred, seemed to be already known to her, as\r\nif by intuition. We entreated her to refrain from speaking on the\r\nsubject for the present; but she answered that it was her duty to speak\r\non it--her duty to propose something which should alleviate the suspense\r\nand distress we were all enduring on her account. No words can describe\r\nto you her fortitude, her noble endurance--.\" Mrs. Langley's voice\r\nfaltered as she pronounced the last words. It was some minutes ere she\r\nbecame sufficiently composed to proceed thus:\r\n\r\n\"I am charged with a message to you from Jane--I should say, charged\r\nwith her entreaties, that you will not suspend our intercourse with Mr.\r\nStreatfield, or view his conduct in any other than a merciful light--as\r\nconduct for which accident and circumstances are alone to blame. After\r\nshe had given me this message to you, she turned to Clara, who sat\r\nweeping by her side, completely overcome; and said that _they_ were to\r\nblame, if any one was to be blamed in the matter, for being so much\r\nalike as to make all who saw them apart doubt which was Clara and which\r\nwas Jane. She said this with a faint smile, and an effort to speak\r\nplayfully, which touched us to the heart. Then, in a tone and manner\r\nwhich I can never forget, she asked her sister--charging her, on their\r\nmutual affection and mutual confidence, to answer sincerely--if _she_\r\nhad noticed Mr. Streatfield on the day of the _levée_, and had\r\nafterwards remembered him at the dinner-table, as _he_ had noticed and\r\nremembered _her_? It was only after Jane had repeated this appeal, still\r\nmore earnestly and affectionately, that Clara summoned courage and\r\ncomposure enough to confess that she _had_ noticed Mr. Streatfield on\r\nthe day of the _levée_, had thought of him afterwards during his absence\r\nfrom London, and had recognized him at our table, as he had recognized\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible! I own I had not anticipated--not thought for one moment\r\nof that,\" said Mr. Langley.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" continued his wife, \"it is best that you should see Jane now,\r\nand judge for yourself. For _my_ part, her noble resignation under this\r\ngreat trial, has so astonished and impressed me, that I only feel\r\ncompetent to advise, as she advises, to act as she thinks fit. I begin\r\nto think that it is not _we_ who are to guide _her_, but _she_ who is to\r\nguide _us_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Langley lingered irresolute for a few minutes; then quitted the\r\nroom, and proceeded along to Jane Langley's apartment.\r\n\r\nWhen he knocked at the door, it was opened by Clara. There was an\r\nexpression partly of confusion, partly of sorrow on her face; and when\r\nher father stopped as if to speak to her, she merely pointed into the\r\nroom, and hurried away without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nMr. Langley had been prepared by his wife for the change that had taken\r\nplace in his daughter since the day before; but he felt startled, almost\r\noverwhelmed, as he now looked on her. One of the poor girl's most\r\nprominent personal attractions, from her earliest years, had been the\r\nbeauty of her complexion; and now, the freshness and the bloom had\r\nentirely departed from her face; it seemed absolutely colorless. Her\r\nexpression, too, appeared to Mr. Langley's eye, to have undergone a\r\nmelancholy alteration; to have lost its youthfulness suddenly; to have\r\nassumed a strange character of firmness and thoughtfulness, which he had\r\nnever observed in it before. She was sitting by an open window,\r\ncommanding a lovely view of wide, sunny landscape; a Bible which her\r\nmother had given her, lay open on her knees; she was reading in it as\r\nher father entered. For the first time in his life, he paused,\r\nspeechless, as he approached to speak to one of his own children.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I look very ill,\" she said, holding out her hand to him;\r\n\"but I am better than I look; I shall be quite well in a day or two.\r\nHave you heard my message, father? have you been told?\"--\r\n\r\n\"My love, we will not speak of it yet; we will wait a few days,\" said\r\nMr. Langley.\r\n\r\n\"You have always been so kind to me,\" she continued, in less steady\r\ntones, \"that I am sure you will let me go on. I have very little to say,\r\nbut that little must be said now, and then we need never recur to it\r\nagain. Will you consider all that has happened, as something forgotten?\r\nYou have heard already what it is that I entreat you to do; will you let\r\n_him_--Mr. Streatfield--\" (She stopped, her voice failed for a moment,\r\nbut she recovered herself again almost immediately.) \"Will you let Mr.\r\nStreatfield remain here, or recall him if he is gone, and give him an\r\nopportunity of explaining himself to my sister? If poor Clara should\r\nrefuse to see him for my sake, pray do not listen to her. I am sure this\r\nis what ought to be done; I have been thinking of it very calmly, and I\r\nfeel that it is right. And there is something more I have to beg of you,\r\nfather; it is, that, while Mr. Streatfield is here, you will allow me\r\nto go and stay with my aunt.--You know how fond she is of me. Her house\r\nis not a day's journey from home. It is best for every body (much the\r\nbest for _me_) that I should not remain here at present; and--and--dear\r\nfather! I have always been your spoiled child; and I know you will\r\nindulge me still. If you will do what I ask you, I shall soon get over\r\nthis heavy trial. I shall be well again if I am away at my aunt's--if--\"\r\n\r\nShe paused; and putting one trembling arm round her father's neck, hid\r\nher face on his breast. For some minutes, Mr. Langley could not trust\r\nhimself to answer her. There was something, not deeply touching only,\r\nbut impressive and sublime, about the moral heroism of this young girl,\r\nwhose heart and mind--hitherto wholly inexperienced in the harder and\r\ndarker emergencies of life--now rose in the strength of their native\r\npurity superior to the bitterest, cruellest trial that either could\r\nundergo; whose patience and resignation, called forth for the first time\r\nby a calamity which suddenly thwarted the purposes and paralyzed the\r\naffections that had been destined to endure for a life, could thus\r\nappear at once in the fullest maturity of virtue and beauty. As the\r\nfather thought on these things; as he vaguely and imperfectly estimated\r\nthe extent of the daughter's sacrifice; as he reflected on the nature of\r\nthe affliction that had befallen her--which combined in itself a\r\nfatality that none could have foreseen, a fault that could neither be\r\nrepaired nor resented, a judgment against which there was no appeal--and\r\nthen remembered how this affliction had been borne, with what words and\r\nwhat actions it had been met, he felt that it would be almost a\r\nprofanation to judge the touching petition just addressed to him, by the\r\ncriterion of _his_ worldly doubts and _his_ worldly wisdom. His eye fell\r\non the Bible, still open beneath it; he remembered the little child who\r\nwas set in the midst of the disciples, as teacher and example to all;\r\nand when at length he spoke in answer to his daughter, it was not to\r\ndirect or to advise, but to comfort and comply.\r\n\r\nThey delayed her removal for a few days, to see if she faltered in her\r\nresolution, if her bodily weakness increased; but she never wavered;\r\nnothing in her appearance changed, either for better or for worse. A\r\nweek after the startling scene at the dinner-table, she was living in\r\nthe strictest retirement in the house of her aunt.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of her departure, a letter was received from Mr.\r\nStreatfield. It was little more than a recapitulation of what he had\r\nalready said to Mr. Langley--expressed, however, on this occasion, in\r\nstronger and, at the same time, in more respectful terms. The letter was\r\nanswered briefly: he was informed that nothing had, as yet, been\r\ndetermined on, but that the next communication would bring him a final\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nTwo months passed. During that time, Jane Langley was frequently visited\r\nat her aunt's house, by her father and mother. She still remained calm\r\nand resolved; still looked pale and thoughtful, as at first. Doctors\r\nwere consulted: they talked of a shock to the nervous system; of great\r\nhope from time, and their patient's strength of mind; and of the\r\nnecessity of acceding to her wishes in all things. Then, the advice of\r\nthe aunt was sought. She was a woman of an eccentric, masculine\r\ncharacter, who had herself experienced a love-disappointment in early\r\nlife, and had never married. She gave her opinion unreservedly and\r\nabruptly, as she always gave it. \"Do as Jane tells you!\" said the old\r\nlady, severely; \"that poor child has more moral courage and\r\ndetermination than all the rest of you put together! I know better than\r\nany body what a sacrifice she has had to make; but she has made it, and\r\nmade it nobly--like a heroine, as some people would say; like a good,\r\nhigh-minded, courageous girl, as _I_ say! Do as she tells you! Let that\r\npoor, selfish fool of a man have his way, and marry her sister--he has\r\nmade one mistake already about a face--see if he doesn't find out, some\r\nday, that he has made another, about a wife! Let him!--Jane is too good\r\nfor _him_, or for any man! Leave her to me; let her stop here; she\r\nshan't lose by what happened! You know this place is mine--I mean it is\r\nto be hers, when I'm dead. You know I've got some money--I shall leave\r\nit to her. I've made my will: it's all done and settled! Go back home;\r\nsend for the man, and tell Clara to marry him without any more fuss! You\r\nwanted my opinion--There it is for you!\"\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Langley decided. The important letter was written, which\r\nrecalled Mr. Streatfield to Langley Hall. As Jane had foreseen, Clara at\r\nfirst refused to hold any communication with him; but a letter from her\r\nsister, and the remonstrances of her father, soon changed her\r\nresolution. There was nothing in common between the twin-sisters but\r\ntheir personal resemblance. Clara had been guided all her life by the\r\nopinions of others, and she was guided by them now.\r\n\r\nOnce permitted the opportunity of pleading his cause, Mr. Streatfield\r\ndid not neglect his own interests. It would be little to our purpose to\r\ndescribe the doubts and difficulties which delayed at first the progress\r\nof his second courtship--pursued as it was under circumstances, not only\r\nextraordinary, but unprecedented. It is no longer with him, or with\r\nClara Langley, that the interest of our story is connected. Suffice it\r\nto say, that he ultimately overcame all the young lady's scruples; and\r\nthat, a few months afterwards, some of Mr. Langley's intimate friends\r\nfound themselves again assembled round his table as wedding-guests, and\r\ncongratulating Mr. Streatfield on his approaching union with Clara, as\r\nthey had already congratulated him, scarcely a year back, on his\r\napproaching union with Jane!\r\n\r\nThe social ceremonies of the wedding-day were performed soberly--almost\r\nsadly. Some of the guests (especially the unmarried ladies) thought\r\nthat Miss Clara had allowed herself to be won too easily--others were\r\npicturing to themselves the situation of the poor girl who was absent;\r\nand contributed little toward the gayety of the party. On this occasion,\r\nhowever, nothing occurred to interrupt the proceedings; the marriage\r\ntook place; and, immediately after it, Mr. Streatfield and his bride\r\nstarted for a tour on the Continent.\r\n\r\nOn their departure, Jane Langley returned home. She made no reference\r\nwhatever to her sister's marriage; and no one mentioned it in her\r\npresence. Still the color did not return to her cheek, or the old gayety\r\nto her manner. The shock that she had suffered had left its traces on\r\nher for life. But there was no evidence that she was sinking under the\r\nremembrances which neither time nor resolution could banish. The strong,\r\npure heart had undergone a change, but not a deterioration. All that had\r\nbeen brilliant in her character was gone; but all that was noble in it\r\nremained. Never had her intercourse with her family and her friends been\r\nso affectionate and so kindly as it was now.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a long absence, Mr. Streatfield and his wife returned to\r\nEngland, it was observed, at her first meeting with them, that the\r\nmomentary confusion and embarrassment were on _their_ side, not on\r\n_hers_. During their stay at Langley Hall, she showed not the slightest\r\ndisposition to avoid them. No member of the family welcomed them more\r\ncordially, entered into all their plans and projects more readily, or\r\nbade them farewell with a kinder or better grace, when they departed for\r\ntheir own home.\r\n\r\nOur tale is nearly ended: what remains of it, must comprise the history\r\nof many years in a few words.\r\n\r\nTime passed on; and Death and Change told of its lapse among the family\r\nat Langley Hall. Five years after the events above related, Mr. Langley\r\ndied; and was followed to the grave, shortly afterwards, by his wife. Of\r\ntheir two sons, the eldest was rising into good practice at the bar; the\r\nyoungest had become _attaché_ to a foreign embassy. Their third daughter\r\nwas married, and living at the family seat of her husband, in Scotland.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Streatfield had children of their own, now, to occupy their\r\ntime and absorb their care. The career of life was over for some--the\r\npurposes of life had altered for others--Jane Langley alone, still\r\nremained unchanged.\r\n\r\nShe now lived entirely with her aunt. At intervals--as their worldly\r\nduties and avocations permitted them--the other members of her family,\r\nor one or two intimate friends, came to the house. Offers of marriage\r\nwere made to her, but were all declined. The first, last love of her\r\ngirlish days--abandoned as a hope, and crushed as a passion; living only\r\nas a quiet grief, as a pure remembrance--still kept its watch, as\r\nguardian and defender, over her heart. Years passed on and worked no\r\nchange in the sad uniformity of her life, until the death of her aunt\r\nleft her mistress of the house in which she had hitherto been a guest.\r\nThen it was observed that she made fewer and fewer efforts to vary the\r\ntenor of her existence, to forget her old remembrances for awhile in the\r\nsociety of others. Such invitations as reached her from relations and\r\nfriends were more frequently declined than accepted. She was growing old\r\nherself now; and, with each advancing year, the busy pageant of the\r\nouter world presented less and less that could attract her eye.\r\n\r\nSo she began to surround herself, in her solitude, with the favorite\r\nbooks that she had studied, with the favorite music that she had played,\r\nin the days of her hopes and her happiness. Every thing that was\r\nassociated, however slightly, with that past period, now acquired a\r\ncharacter of inestimable value in her eyes, as aiding her mind to\r\nseclude itself more and more strictly in the sanctuary of its early\r\nrecollections. Was it weakness in her to live thus; to abandon the world\r\nand the world's interests, as one who had no hope, or part in either?\r\nHad she earned the right, by the magnitude and resolution of her\r\nsacrifice, thus to indulge in the sad luxury of fruitless remembrance?\r\nWho shall say!--who shall presume to decide that cannot think with _her_\r\nthoughts, and look back with _her_ recollections!\r\n\r\nThus she lived--alone, and yet not lonely; without hope, but with no\r\ndespair; separate and apart from the world around her, except when she\r\napproached it by her charities to the poor, and her succor to the\r\nafflicted; by her occasional interviews with the surviving members of\r\nher family and a few old friends, when they sought her in her calm\r\nretreat; and by the little presents which she constantly sent to\r\nbrothers' and sisters' children, who worshipped, as their invisible good\r\ngenius, \"the kind lady\" whom most of them had never seen. Such was her\r\nexistence throughout the closing years of her life: such did it\r\ncontinue--calm and blameless--to the last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader, when you are told, that what is impressive and pathetic in the\r\nDrama of Human Life has passed with a past age of Chivalry and Romance,\r\nremember Jane Langley, and quote in contradiction the story of the TWIN\r\nSISTERS!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen about nine years old, Southey attended a school at Bristol, kept by\r\none Williams, a Welshman, the one, he says, of all his schoolmasters,\r\nwhom he remembered with the kindliest feelings. This Williams used\r\nsometimes to infuse more passion into his discipline than was becoming,\r\nof which Southey records a most ridiculous illustration. One of his\r\nschoolmates--a Creole, with a shade of African color and negro\r\nfeatures--was remarkable for his stupidity. Williams, after flogging him\r\none day, made him pay a half-penny for the use of the rod, because he\r\nrequired it so much oftener than any other boy in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nALFIERI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVittorio Alfieri was born at Asti, a city of Piedmont, on the 17th of\r\nJanuary, 1749,--the year in which his great contemporary, Goëthe, first\r\nsaw the light. His father, Antonio Alfieri, was a nobleman of high rank\r\nin his own country; his mother, whose name was Monica Maillard di\r\nTournon, was of Savoyard descent. At the time of Vittorio's birth his\r\nfather was sixty years of age; and as until then he had had no son, the\r\nentrance of the future poet into the world was to him a subject of\r\nunspeakable delight: but his happiness was of short duration, for he\r\noverheated himself one day by going to see the child at a neighboring\r\nvillage where he was at nurse, and died of the illness that ensued, his\r\nson being at the time less than a year old. The countess, his widow, did\r\nnot long remain so, as she very shortly married again, her third husband\r\n(she was a widow when the count married her) being the Cavalier Giacinto\r\nAlfieri, a distant member of the same family.\r\n\r\nWhen about six years old, Alfieri was placed under the care of a priest\r\ncalled Don Ivaldi, who taught him writing, arithmetic, Cornelius Nepos,\r\nand Phædrus. He soon discovered, however, that the worthy priest was an\r\nignoramus, and congratulates himself on having escaped from his hands at\r\nthe age of nine, otherwise he believes that he should have been an\r\nabsolute and irreclaimable dunce. His mother and father-in-law were\r\nconstantly repeating the maxim then so popular among the Italian\r\nnobility, that it was not necessary that a gentleman should be a doctor.\r\nIt was at this early age that he was first attacked by that melancholy\r\nwhich gradually assumed entire dominion over him, and throughout life\r\nremained a most prominent feature in his character. When only seven\r\nyears of age, he made an attempt to poison himself by eating some\r\nnoxious herbs, being impelled to this strange action by an undefined\r\ndesire to die. He was well punished for his silliness by being made very\r\nunwell, and by being, moreover, shut up in his room for some days. No\r\npunishment for his youthful transgressions was, however, so effectual as\r\nbeing sent in a nightcap to a neighboring church. \"Who knows,\" says he,\r\n\"whether I am not indebted to that blessed nightcap for having turned\r\nout one of the most truthful men I ever knew?\"\r\n\r\nIn 1758, his paternal uncle and guardian, seeing what little progress he\r\nwas making, determined to send him to the Turin Academy, and accordingly\r\nhe started in the month of July.\r\n\r\n\"I cried (he says, in his autobiography) during the whole of the first\r\nstage. On arriving at the post-house, I got out of the carriage while\r\nthe horses were being changed, and feeling thirsty, instead of asking\r\nfor a glass, or requesting any body to fetch me some water, I marched up\r\nto the horse-trough, dipped the corner of my cap in the water, and drank\r\nto my heart's content. The postilions, seeing this, told my attendant,\r\nwho ran up and began rating me soundly; but I told him that travellers\r\nought to accustom themselves to such things, and that no good soldier\r\nwould drink in any other manner. Where I fished up these Achilles-like\r\nideas I know not, as my mother had always educated me with the greatest\r\ntenderness, and with really ludicrous care for my health.\"\r\n\r\nHe describes his character at this period, where he ends what he calls\r\nthe epoch of childhood, and begins that of adolescence, as having been\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I was taciturn and placid for the most part, but occasionally very\r\ntalkative and lively; in fact, I generally ran from one extreme to\r\nanother. I was obstinate and restive when force was exerted, most docile\r\nunder kind treatment; restrained more by fear of being scolded than by\r\nany thing else; susceptible of shame even to excess, and inflexible when\r\nrubbed against the grain.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered the Academy on the 1st of August. It was a magnificent\r\nquadrangular building, of which two of the sides were occupied by the\r\nKing's Theatre and the Royal Archives; another side was appropriated to\r\nthe younger students, who composed what were called the second and third\r\napartments, while the fourth contained the first apartment, or the older\r\nstudents, who were mostly foreigners, besides the king's pages, to the\r\nnumber of twenty or twenty-five. Alfieri was at first placed in the\r\nthird apartment, and the fourth class, from which he was promoted to the\r\nthird at the end of three months. The master of this class was a certain\r\nDon Degiovanni, a priest even more ignorant than his good friend Ivaldi.\r\nIt may be supposed that under such auspices he did not make much\r\nprogress in his studies. Let us hear his own account:\r\n\r\n\"Being thus an ass, in the midst of asses, and under an ass, I\r\ntranslated Cornelius Nepos, some of Virgil's _Eclogues_, and such-like;\r\nwe wrote stupid, nonsensical themes, so that in any well-directed school\r\nwe should have been a wretched fourth class. I was never at the bottom;\r\nemulation spurred me on until I surpassed or equalled the head boy; but\r\nas soon as I reached the top, I fell back into a state of torpor. I was\r\nperhaps to be excused, as nothing could equal the dryness and insipidity\r\nof our studies. It is true that we translated Cornelius Nepos; but none\r\nof us, probably not even the master himself, knew who the men were whose\r\nlives we were translating, nor their countries, nor the times in which\r\nthey lived, nor the governments under which they flourished, nor even\r\nwhat a government was. All our ideas were contracted, false, or\r\nconfused; the master had no object in view; his pupils took not the\r\nslightest interest in what they learned. In short, all were as bad as\r\nbad could be; no one looked after us, or if they did, knew what they\r\nwere about.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1759, he was promoted to the humanity class, the master of\r\nwhich was a man of some learning. His emulation was excited in this\r\nclass by his meeting a boy who could repeat 600 lines of the _Georgics_\r\nwithout a single mistake, while he could never get beyond 400. These\r\ndefeats almost suffocated him with anger, and he often burst out crying,\r\nand occasionally abused his rival most violently. He found some\r\nconsolation, however, for his inferior memory, in always writing the\r\nbest themes. About this time he obtained possession of a copy of Ariosto\r\nin four volumes, which he rather believes he purchased, a volume at a\r\ntime, with certain half-fowls that were given the students on Sundays,\r\nhis first Ariosto thus costing him two fowls in the space of four weeks.\r\nHe much regrets that he is not certain on the point, feeling anxious to\r\nknow whether he imbibed his first draughts of poetry at the expense of\r\nhis stomach. Notwithstanding that he was at the head of the humanity\r\nclass, and could translate the _Georgics_ into Italian prose, he found\r\ngreat difficulty in understanding the easiest of Italian poets. The\r\nmaster, however, soon perceived him reading the book by stealth, and\r\nconfiscated it, leaving the future poet deprived for the present of all\r\npoetical guidance.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he was in a wretched state of health, being\r\nconstantly attacked by various extraordinary diseases. He describes\r\nhimself as not growing at all, and as resembling a very delicate and\r\npale wax taper. In 1760 he passed in the class of rhetoric, and\r\nsucceeded, moreover, in recovering his Ariosto, but read very little of\r\nit, partly from the difficulty he found in understanding it, and partly\r\nbecause the continued breaks in the story disgusted him. As to Tasso, he\r\nhad never even heard his name. He obtained a few of Metastasio's plays\r\nas _libretti_ of the Opera at carnival time, and was much pleased with\r\nthem, and also with some of Goldoni's comedies that were lent to him.\r\n\r\n\"But the dramatic genius, of which the germs perhaps existed in me, was\r\nsoon buried or extinguished for want of food, of encouragement, and\r\nevery thing else. In short, my ignorance and that of my instructors, and\r\nthe carelessness of every body in every thing exceeded all conception.\"\r\n\r\nThe following year he was promoted into the class of philosophy, which\r\nmet in the adjoining university. The following is his description of the\r\ncourse:\r\n\r\n\"This school of peripatetic philosophy was held after dinner. During the\r\nfirst half-hour we wrote out the lecture at the dictation of the\r\nprofessor, and in the subsequent three-quarters of an hour, when he\r\ncommented upon it, Heaven knows how, in Latin, we scholars wrapped\r\nourselves up comfortably in our mantles, and went fast asleep; and among\r\nthe assembled philosophers, not a sound was heard except the drawling\r\nvoice of the professor himself, half asleep, and the various notes of\r\nthe snorers, who formed a most delightful concert in every possible\r\nkey.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his holidays this year, his uncle took him to the Opera for the\r\nfirst time, where he heard the _Mercato di Malmantile_. The music\r\nproduced a most extraordinary effect upon him, and for several weeks\r\nafterwards he remained immersed in a strange but not unpleasing\r\nmelancholy, followed by an absolute loathing of his usual studies. Music\r\nall through life affected him most powerfully, and he states that his\r\ntragedies were almost invariably planned by him when under its\r\ninfluence. It was about this time that he composed his first sonnet,\r\nwhich was made up of whole or mutilated verses of Metastasio and\r\nAriosto, the only two Italian poets of whom he knew any thing. It was in\r\npraise of a certain lady to whom his uncle was paying his addresses, and\r\nwhom he himself admired. Several persons, including the lady herself,\r\npraised it, so that he already fancied himself a poet. His uncle,\r\nhowever, a military man, and no votary of the Muses, laughed at him so\r\nmuch, that his poetical vein was soon dried up, and he did not renew his\r\nattempts in the line till he was more than twenty-five years old. \"How\r\nmany good or bad verses did my uncle suffocate, together with my\r\nfirst-born sonnet!\"\r\n\r\nHe next studied physics and ethics--the former under the celebrated\r\nBeccaria, but not a single definition remained in his head. These\r\nstudies, however, as well as those in civil and canon law, which he had\r\ncommenced, were interrupted by a violent illness, which rendered it\r\nnecessary for him to have his head shaved, and to wear a wig. His\r\ncompanions, at first, tormented him greatly about this wig, and used to\r\ntear it from his head; but he soon succeeded in appeasing the public\r\nindignation, by being always the first to throw the unhappy ornament in\r\nquestion up in the air, calling it by every opprobrious epithet. From\r\nthat time he remained the least persecuted wig-wearer among the two or\r\nthree who were in this predicament.\r\n\r\nHe now took lessons on the piano, and in geography, fencing, and\r\ndancing. He imbibed the most invincible dislike to the latter, which he\r\nattributed to the grimaces and extraordinary contortions of the master,\r\na Frenchman just arrived from Paris. He dates from this period that\r\nextreme hatred of the French nation which remained with him through\r\nlife, and which was one of the strangest features in his character. His\r\nuncle died this year (1763), and as he was now fourteen, the age at\r\nwhich, by the laws of Piedmont, minors are freed from the care of their\r\nguardians, and are placed under curators, who leave them masters of\r\ntheir income, and can only prevent the alienation of their real estates,\r\nhe found himself possessed of considerable property, which was still\r\nfarther increased by his uncle's fortune. Having obtained the degree of\r\nmaster of arts, by passing a public examination in logic, physics, and\r\ngeometry, he was rewarded by being allowed to attend the riding-school,\r\na thing he had always ardently desired. He became an expert horseman,\r\nand attributes to this exercise the recovery of his health, which now\r\nrapidly improved.\r\n\r\n\"Having buried my uncle, changed my guardian into a curator, obtained my\r\nmaster's degree, got rid of my attendant Andrea, and mounted a steed, it\r\nis incredible how proud I became. I told the authorities plainly that I\r\nwas sick of studying law, and that I would not go on with it. After a\r\nconsultation, they determined to remove me into the first apartment,\r\nwhich I entered on the 8th May, 1763.\"\r\n\r\nHe now led an extremely idle life, being little looked after. A crowd of\r\nflatterers, the usual attendants upon wealth, sprung up around him, and\r\nhe indulged in amusements and dissipations of every kind. A temporary\r\nfit of industry, which lasted for two or three months, came over him,\r\nand he plunged deeply into the thirty-six volumes of Fleury's\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_. Soon, however, he resumed his old course, and\r\nconducted himself so badly that the authorities found it necessary to\r\nplace him under arrest, and he remained for some months a prisoner in\r\nhis own apartment, obstinately refusing to make any apology, and leading\r\nthe life of a wild beast, never putting on his clothes, and spending\r\nmost of his time in sleep. He was at length released, on the occasion of\r\nhis sister Giulia's marriage to the Count Giacinto di Cumiana, in May,\r\n1764.\r\n\r\nOn regaining his former position he bought his first horse, and soon\r\nafterwards another, on the pretence of its being delicate. He next\r\npurchased two carriage horses, and went on thus till in less than a year\r\nhe had eight in his possession. He also had an elegant carriage built\r\nfor him, but used it very seldom, because his friends were obliged to\r\nwalk, and he shrunk from offending them by a display of ostentation. His\r\nhorses, however, were at the service of all, and as his love for them\r\ncould not excite any feelings of envy, he took the greatest delight in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was now that he first felt the symptoms of love, excited by a lady\r\nwho was the wife of an elder brother of some intimate friends of his, to\r\nwhom he was on a visit. His transient passion, however, soon passed\r\naway, without leaving any trace behind it. The period had now arrived\r\nfor his leaving the academy, and in May, 1766, he was nominated ensign\r\nin the provincial regiment of Asti, which met only twice a-year for a\r\nfew days, thus allowing ample opportunity for doing nothing; the only\r\nthing, he says, he had made up his mind to do. But he soon got tired of\r\neven this slight restraint. \"I could not adapt myself to that chain of\r\ngraduated dependence which is called subordination, and which although\r\nthe soul of military discipline, could never be the soul of a future\r\ntragic poet.\" He therefore obtained permission, though with great\r\ndifficulty, to accompany an English Catholic tutor, who was about to\r\nvisit Rome and Naples with two of his fellow-students. He chooses this\r\nmoment for commencing the epoch of youth, which he describes as\r\nembracing ten years of travel and dissipation.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Milan, the travellers visited the Ambrosian library.\r\n\r\n\"Here the librarian placed in my hands a manuscript of Petrarch, but,\r\nlike a true Goth, I threw it aside, saying it was nothing to me. The\r\nfact was, I had a certain spite against the aforesaid Petrarch; for\r\nhaving met with a copy of his works some years before, when I was a\r\nphilosopher, I found on opening it at various places by chance that I\r\ncould not understand the meaning in the least; accordingly I joined with\r\nthe French and other ignorant pretenders in condemning him, and as I\r\nconsidered him a dull and prosy writer, I treated his invaluable\r\nmanuscript in the manner above described.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time he always spoke and wrote in French, and read nothing but\r\nFrench books.\r\n\r\n\"As I knew still less of Italian, I gathered the necessary fruit of my\r\nbirth in an amphibious country, and of the precious education I had\r\nreceived.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded afterwards to Florence, Rome, and Naples. At the latter\r\nplace he obtained permission from his own court, through the\r\nintercession of the Sardinian minister, to leave the tutor, and travel\r\nfor the future alone. Attended only by his faithful servant Elia, who\r\nhad taken the place of the worthless Andrea, and for whom he felt a\r\ngreat affection, he returned to Rome, and had the honor of kissing the\r\nPope's toe. The pontiff's manner pleased him so much, that he felt no\r\nrepugnance to going through the ceremony, although he had read Fleury,\r\nand knew the real value of the aforesaid toe.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained leave to travel for another year, he determined to visit\r\nFrance, England, and Holland. He went first to Venice, and there was\r\nassailed by that melancholy, _ennui_, and restlessness, peculiar to his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"I spent many days without leaving the house, my chief employment being\r\nto stand at the window, and make signs, and hold brief dialogues with a\r\nyoung lady opposite; the rest of the day I spent in sleeping, in\r\nthinking of I know not what, and generally crying, I knew not why.\"\r\n\r\nAll through life he was subject to these periodical fits, which came on\r\nevery spring, and materially influenced his powers of composition.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded afterwards to France, expecting to be delighted with Paris;\r\nbut on arriving there he found it so unlike what he had anticipated,\r\nthat he burst into a violent fit of passion at having made so much\r\nhaste, undergone so much fatigue, and had his fancy excited to such a\r\npitch of frenzy, only to plunge into that filthy sewer, as he calls it!\r\nHis anger is quite ludicrous; but he, notwithstanding, remained there\r\nfive months, during which time he was presented to Louis XV. at\r\nVersailles, but the cold reception he met with greatly annoyed him.\r\n\r\n\"Although I had been told that the king did not speak to ordinary\r\nforeigners, and although I did not care much for his notice, yet I could\r\nnot swallow the Jove-like superciliousness of the monarch, who surveyed\r\nfrom head to foot the people presented to him, without appearing to\r\nreceive the slightest impression. It was as if somebody said to a giant,\r\n'I beg to present an ant to you;' and he were either to stare or to\r\nsmile, or to say, it may be, 'Oh, what a little creature!'\"\r\n\r\nHe was as much delighted with England as he had been disgusted with\r\nFrance. He falls into perfect raptures when speaking of our national\r\ncharacter and our national institutions, and regrets that it was not in\r\nhis power to remain here for ever. In June, 1768, he went to Holland,\r\nand at the Hague fell violently in love with the wife of a rich\r\ngentleman whom he knew. When the lady was obliged to go into\r\nSwitzerland, he was thrown into such a state of frenzy that he attempted\r\nto commit suicide, by tearing off the bandages from the place where he\r\nhad had himself bled, under pretence of illness. His servant, however,\r\nsuspected his intentions, and prevented him from carrying his resolution\r\ninto effect. He gradually recovered his spirits, and determined to\r\nreturn to Italy. On reaching Turin, he was seized by a desire to study.\r\nThe book in which he took most delight was Plutarch's Lives:\r\n\r\n\"Some of these, such as Timoleon, Cæsar, Brutus, Pelopidas, and Cato, I\r\nread four or five times over, with such transports of shouting, crying,\r\nand fury, that any person in the next room must have thought me mad. On\r\nreading any particular anecdotes of those great men, I used often to\r\nspring to my feet in the greatest agitation, and quite beside myself,\r\nshedding tears of grief and rage at seeing myself born in Piedmont, and\r\nin an age and under a government where nothing noble could be said or\r\ndone, and where it was almost useless to think or to feel.\"\r\n\r\nHis brother-in-law now strongly urged him to marry, and he consented,\r\nalthough unwillingly, that negotiations should be entered into on his\r\nbehalf with the family of a young, noble, and rich heiress, whose\r\nbeautiful black eyes would, doubtless, soon have driven Plutarch out of\r\nhis head. The end, however, was that she married somebody else, to\r\nAlfieri's internal satisfaction. \"Had I been tied down by a wife and\r\nchildren, the Muses would certainly have bid me good bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment he felt himself free he determined to start again on his\r\ntravels. On reaching Vienna, the Sardinian minister offered to introduce\r\nhim to Metastasio; but he cared nothing at that time for any Italian\r\nauthor, and, moreover, had taken a great dislike to the poet, from\r\nhaving seen him make a servile genuflexion to the Empress Maria Theresa\r\nin the Imperial Gardens at Schönbrunn. On entering the dominions of\r\nFrederick the Great, he was made extremely indignant by the military\r\ndespotism that reigned there. When presented to the king he did not\r\nappear in uniform.\r\n\r\n\"The minister asked me the reason of this, seeing that I was in the\r\nservice of my own sovereign. I replied, 'Because there are already\r\nenough uniforms here.' The king said to me his usual four words; I\r\nwatched him attentively, fixing my eyes respectfully on his, and thanked\r\nHeaven that I was not born his slave.\"\r\n\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Russia, were then successively visited by him. He\r\nhad heard so much of the latter country, that when he reached St.\r\nPetersburgh his expectations were wrought up to a great pitch.\r\n\r\n\"But, alas! no sooner did I set foot in this Asiatic encampment of\r\ntents, than I called to mind Rome, Genoa, Venice, and Florence, and\r\nbegan to laugh. The longer I remained in the country, the more were my\r\nfirst impressions confirmed, and I left it with the precious conviction\r\nthat it was not worth seeing.\"\r\n\r\nHe refused to be presented to the celebrated female autocrat, Catherine\r\nII., whom he stigmatizes as \"a philosophical Clytemnestra.\"\r\n\r\nHe next visited England for the second time, arriving at the end of\r\n1770. During his stay in London, which lasted for seven months, he\r\nbecame involved in an affair which excited an extraordinary sensation at\r\nthe time, and which is even remembered by the scandal-mongers of the\r\npresent day. He formed the acquaintance of the wife of an officer of\r\nhigh rank in the Guards, and this intimacy soon assumed a criminal\r\ncharacter. Her husband, a man of a very jealous temperament, suspected\r\nhis wife's infidelity, and had them watched. On finding his suspicions\r\nconfirmed, he challenged Alfieri, and they fought a duel with swords in\r\nthe Green Park, in which the future poet was wounded in the arm. The\r\nhusband pressed for a divorce, and Alfieri announced his intention of\r\nmarrying the lady as soon as she was free; but, to his horror, she\r\nconfessed to him one day, what was already known to the public through\r\nthe newspapers, although he was ignorant of it, that before she knew him\r\nshe had been engaged in an intrigue with a groom of her husband! Despite\r\nthis discovery, it was some time before his affection for her abated;\r\nbut at length, on her announcing her determination to enter a convent in\r\nFrance, he quitted her at Rochester, and left this country himself\r\nalmost immediately afterwards. He went to Paris, and there bought a\r\ncollection of the principal Italian poets and prose-writers in\r\nthirty-six volumes, which from that time became his inseparable\r\ncompanions, although he did not make much use of them for two or three\r\nyears. However, he now learned to know at least something of the six\r\ngreat luminaries, Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, Tasso, Boccaccio, and\r\nMachiavelli.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeded to Spain and Portugal. At Lisbon he formed the\r\nacquaintance of the Abate Tommaso di Caluso, younger brother of the\r\nSardinian minister. The society of this distinguished man produced the\r\nmost beneficial effect on him. One evening, when the Abate was reading\r\nto him the fine _Ode to Fortune_ of Alessandro Guidi, a poet whose name\r\nhe had never even heard, some of the stanzas produced such extraordinary\r\ntransports in him, that the former told him that he was born to write\r\nverses. This sudden impulse of Apollo, as he calls it, was however only\r\na momentary flush, which was soon extinguished, and remained buried for\r\na long time to come.\r\n\r\nHe now bent his steps homewards, and reached Turin in May, 1772, after\r\nan absence of three years. He took a magnificent house in the Piazza di\r\nSan Carlo, furnished it sumptuously, and commenced leading a merry life\r\nwith about a dozen friends, who formed a society, which met at his house\r\nevery week. This Society was governed by strict rules, one of which was\r\nthat all should contribute something in writing for their reciprocal\r\namusement; these contributions being placed in a chest, of which the\r\npresident for the time being kept the key, and read aloud by him at\r\ntheir meetings. They were all written in French, and Alfieri mentions\r\none of his which was very successful. It described the Deity at the last\r\njudgment demanding from every soul an account of itself, and the\r\ncharacters he drew were all those of well-known individuals, both male\r\nand female, in Turin.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he fell in love for the third time, the object of\r\nhis passion now being a lady some years older than himself, and of\r\nsomewhat doubtful reputation. For the space of nearly two years she\r\nexercised unbounded dominion over him. Feeling that he could not support\r\nthe fetters of Venus and of Mars at one and the same time, he with some\r\nlittle difficulty obtained permission to throw up his commission in the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nWhile attending at his mistress's bedside, during an illness by which\r\nshe was attacked in January, 1744, the idea first struck him of writing\r\na dramatic sketch. He wrote it without the slightest plan, in the form\r\nof a dialogue between three persons, called respectively, Photinus,\r\nLachesis, and Cleopatra. He gives a specimen of it in a note, and it is\r\ncertainly not of the very highest order of merit. On the recovery of the\r\nlady he placed it under the cushion of her couch, where it remained\r\nforgotten for a year, and thus were the first fruits of his tragic\r\ngenius brooded over, as it were, by the lady and all who chanced to sit\r\nupon the couch.\r\n\r\nAt length he threw off the chains which had so long bound him. The\r\nexertion was, however, so great that he was actually obliged to get his\r\nservant Elia to tie him to his chair, that he might not quit the house.\r\nWhen his friends came to see him, he dropped his dressing gown over the\r\nbandages, so that his forced imprisonment was not perceived. His first\r\nappearance in public was at the carnival of 1775, where he dressed\r\nhimself up as Apollo, and recited at the public ball at the theatre a\r\nmasquerade he had composed on the subject of love, twanging a guitar\r\nvigorously all the time. He was afterwards heartily ashamed of this\r\nfreak, which he wonders he could ever have been guilty of. An ardent\r\ndesire for glory now seized him, and after some months spent in constant\r\npoetical studies, and in fingering grammars and dictionaries, he\r\nsucceeded in producing his first tragedy; which, like the sketch already\r\nmentioned, he entitled _Cleopatra_. It was performed at Turin, on the\r\n16th June, 1775, at the Carignan Theatre, and was followed by a comic\r\nafter-piece, also written by him, called _The Poets_, in which he\r\nintroduced himself under the name of Giusippus, and was the first to\r\nridicule his own tragedy; which, he says, differed from those of his\r\npoetical rivals, inasmuch as their productions were the mature offspring\r\nof an erudite incapacity, whilst his was the premature child of a not\r\nunpromising ignorance. These two pieces were performed with considerable\r\nsuccess for two successive evenings, when he withdrew them from the\r\nstage, ashamed at having so rashly exposed himself to the public. He\r\nnever considered this _Cleopatra_ worthy of preservation, and it is not\r\npublished with his other works. From this moment, however, he felt every\r\nvein swollen with the most burning thirst for real theatrical laurels,\r\nand here terminates the epoch of Youth and commences that of Manhood.\r\n\r\nUp to this point we have seen Alfieri's character as formed by nature,\r\nand before it was influenced by study, or softened down by intercourse\r\nwith the world. We have seen him ardent, restless beyond all belief,\r\npassionate, oppressed by unaccountable melancholy, acting under the\r\ntoiling impulse of the moment, whether in love or hate, and, what is of\r\nextreme disadvantage to him as respects the career he is about to enter\r\nupon, suffering from a deficient education. We have now to see how he\r\novercame all the obstacles arising from his natural character, and from\r\na youth wasted in idleness and dissipation; and how he gradually won his\r\nway from victory to victory, until he at length attained the noble and\r\nenviable eminence which is assigned to him by universal consent as the\r\ngreatest, we had almost said the only, modern Italian poet.\r\n\r\nHe describes the capital with which he commenced his undertaking as\r\nconsisting in a resolute, indomitable, and extremely obstinate mind, and\r\na heart full to overflowing with every species of emotion, particularly\r\nlove, with all its furies, and a profound and ferocious hatred of\r\ntyranny. To this was added a faint recollection of various French\r\ntragedies. On the other hand, he was almost entirely ignorant of the\r\nrules of tragic art, and understood his own language most imperfectly.\r\nThe whole was enveloped in a thick covering of presumption, or rather\r\npetulance, and a violence of character so great as to render it most\r\ndifficult for him to appreciate truth. He considers these elements\r\nbetter adapted for forming a bad monarch than a good author.\r\n\r\nHe began by studying grammar vigorously; and his first attempt was to\r\nput into Italian two tragedies, entitled _Filippo_ and _Polinice_, which\r\nhe had some time before written in French prose. At the same time he\r\nread Tasso, Ariosto, Dante, and Petrarch, making notes as he proceeded,\r\nand occupying a year in the task. He then commenced reading Latin with a\r\ntutor; and shortly afterwards went to Tuscany in order to acquire a\r\nreally good Italian idiom. He returned to Turin in October, 1776, and\r\nthere composed several sonnets, having in the meantime made considerable\r\nprogress with several of his tragedies. The next year he again went to\r\nTuscany, and on reaching Florence in October, intending to remain there\r\na month, an event occurred which--to use his own words--\"fixed and\r\nenchained me there for many years; an event which, happily for me,\r\ndetermined me to expatriate myself for ever, and which by fastening upon\r\nme new, self-sought, and golden chains, enabled me to acquire that real\r\nliterary freedom, without which I should never have done any good, if so\r\nbe that I _have_ done good.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Edward, the Young Pretender, was at that time residing in\r\nFlorence, in company with his wife, the Countess of Albany, whose maiden\r\nname was Louisa Stolberg, of the princely house of that name. The\r\nfollowing is Alfieri's description of her:--\r\n\r\n\"The sweet fire of her very dark eyes, added (a thing of rare\r\noccurrence) to a very white skin and fair hair, gave an irresistible\r\nbrilliancy to her beauty. She was twenty-five years of age, was much\r\nattached to literature and the fine arts, had an angelic temper, and, in\r\nspite of her wealth, was in the most painful domestic circumstances, so\r\nthat she could not be as happy as she deserved. How many reasons for\r\nloving her!\"\r\n\r\nHer husband appears to have been of a most violent and ungovernable\r\ntemper, and to have always treated her in the harshest manner.--No\r\nwonder, then, that an impassioned and susceptible nature like Alfieri's\r\nshould have been attracted by such charms! A friendship of the closest\r\nand most enduring description ensued between them; and although a\r\ncertain air of mystery always surrounded the story of their mutual\r\nattachment, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it partook in\r\nthe slightest degree of a dishonorable character.\r\n\r\nInstead of finding his passion for the Countess an obstacle to literary\r\nglory and useful occupations, as had always been the case previously\r\nwith him, when under the influence of similar emotions, he found that it\r\nincited and spurred him on to every good work, and accordingly he\r\nabandoned himself, without restraint, to its indulgence. That he might\r\nhave no inducement to return to his own country, he determined to\r\ndissolve every tie that united him to it, and with that intent made an\r\nabsolute donation for life of the whole of his estates, both in fee and\r\nfreehold, to his natural heir, his sister Giulia, wife of the Count di\r\nCumiana. He merely stipulated for an annual pension, and a certain sum\r\nin ready money, the whole amounting to about one-half of the value of\r\nhis property. The negotiations were finally brought to a conclusion in\r\nNovember, 1778. He also sold his furniture and plate which he had left\r\nin Turin; and, unfortunately for himself, invested almost the whole of\r\nthe money he now found himself possessed of in French life annuities. At\r\none period of the negotiations he was in great fear lest he should lose\r\nevery thing, and revolved in his mind what profession he should adopt in\r\ncase he should be left penniless.\r\n\r\n\"The art that presented itself to me as the best for gaining a living\r\nby, was that of a horse-breaker, in which I consider myself a\r\nproficient. It is certainly one of the least servile, and it appeared to\r\nme to be more compatible than any other with that of a poet, for it is\r\nmuch easier to write tragedies in a stable than in a court.\"\r\n\r\nHe now commenced living in the simplest style, dismissed all his\r\nservants, save one; sold or gave away all his horses, and wore the\r\nplainest clothing. He continued his studies without intermission, and by\r\nthe beginning of 1782 had nearly finished the whole of the twelve\r\ntragedies which he had from the first made up his mind to write, and not\r\nto exceed. These were entitled respectively _Filippo_, _Polinice_,\r\n_Antigone_, _Agamennone_, _Oreste_, _Don Garzia_, _Virginia_, _La\r\nCongiura de' Pazzi_, _Maria Stuarda_, _Ottavia_, _Timoleone_ and\r\n_Rosmunda_.--Happening, however, to read the _Merope_ of Maffei, then\r\nconsidered the best Italian tragedy, he felt so indignant, that he set\r\nto work, and very shortly produced his tragedy of that name, which was\r\nsoon followed by the _Saul_, which is incomparably the finest of his\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe Countess had obtained permission at the end of 1780 to leave her\r\nhusband, in consequence of the brutal treatment she experienced at his\r\nhands, and to retire to Rome. It was not long before Alfieri followed\r\nher, and took up his habitation there also. At the end of 1782, his\r\n_Antigone_ was performed by a company of amateurs--he himself being\r\none--before an audience consisting of all the rank and fashion of Rome.\r\nIts success was unequivocal, and he felt so proud of his triumph, that\r\nhe determined to send four of his tragedies to press, getting his friend\r\nGori, at Siena, to superintend the printing; and they were accordingly\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between Alfieri and the Countess now inflamed the anger of\r\nCharles Edward and his brother, Cardinal York, to such a pitch, that\r\nAlfieri found it prudent to leave Rome, which he did in May, 1783, in a\r\nstate of bitter anguish. He first made pilgrimages to the tombs of\r\nDante, Petrarch, and Ariosto, at Ravenna, Arquà, and Ferrara; at each of\r\nwhich he spent some time in dreaming, praying, and weeping, at the same\r\ntime pouring forth a perfect stream of impassioned poetry. On getting to\r\nSiena, he superintended personally the printing of six more of his\r\ntragedies, and for the first time felt all the cares of authorship,\r\nbeing driven nearly distracted by the sad realities of censors, both\r\nspiritual and temporal, correctors of the press, compositors, pressmen,\r\n&c., and the worry he experienced brought on a sharp attack of gout. On\r\nrecovering, he determined to start off once more on his travels, making\r\nas a plea his desire to purchase a stud of horses in England, his\r\nequestrian propensities having returned with violence. He accordingly\r\nleft his tragedies, both published and unpublished, to shift for\r\nthemselves, and proceeded to England, where, in a few weeks, he bought\r\nno less than fourteen horses. That being the exact number of the\r\ntragedies he had written, he used to amuse himself by saying, \"For each\r\ntragedy you have got a horse,\" in reference to the punishment inflicted\r\non naughty schoolboys in Italy, where the culprit is mounted on the\r\nshoulders of another boy, while the master lays on the cane.\r\n\r\nHe experienced almost endless trouble and difficulty in conveying his\r\nacquisitions safely back to Italy. The account he gives of the passage\r\nof the Alps by Mount Cenis, from Lanslebourg to the Novalese, is really\r\nquite romantic; and he compares himself to Hannibal on the occasion, but\r\nsays that if the passage of the latter cost him a great deal of vinegar,\r\nit cost him (Alfieri) no small quantity of wine, as the whole party\r\nconcerned in conveying the horses over the mountain, guides, farriers,\r\ngrooms, and adjutants, drank like fishes.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Turin, he was present at a performance of his _Virginia_ at\r\nthe same theatre where, nine years before, his early play of _Cleopatra_\r\nhad been acted. He shortly received intelligence that the Countess had\r\nbeen permitted to leave Rome and to go to Switzerland. He could not\r\nrefrain from following her, and accordingly rejoined her at Colmar, a\r\ncity of Alsace, after a separation of sixteen months. The sight of her\r\nwhom he loved so dearly again awakened his poetic genius, and gave\r\nbirth, at almost one and the same moment, to his three tragedies of\r\n_Agide_, _Sofonisba_, and _Mirra_, despite his previous resolve to write\r\nno more. When obliged to leave the Countess, he returned to Italy, but\r\nthe following year again visited her, remaining in Alsace when she\r\nproceeded to Paris. She happened to mention in a letter that she had\r\nbeen much pleased with seeing Voltaire's _Brutus_ performed on the\r\nstage. This excited his emulation. \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"_Brutuses_\r\nwritten by a Voltaire? I'll write _Brutuses_, and two at once, moreover,\r\ntime will show whether such subjects for tragedy are better adapted for\r\nme or for a plebeian-born Frenchman, who for more than sixty years\r\nsubscribed himself _Voltaire, Gentleman in Ordinary to the King_.\"\r\nAccordingly he set to work, and planned on the spot his _Bruto Primo_\r\nand _Bruto Secondo_; after which he once more renewed his vow to Apollo\r\nto write no more tragedies. About this period he also sketched his\r\n_Abel_, which he called by the whimsical title of a _Tramelogedy_. He\r\nnext went to Paris, and made arrangements with the celebrated Didot for\r\nprinting the whole of his tragedies in six volumes. On returning to\r\nAlsace, in company with the Countess, he was joined by his old friend\r\nthe Abate di Caluso, who brought with him a letter from his mother,\r\ncontaining proposals for his marriage with a rich young lady of Asti,\r\nwhose name was not mentioned. Alfieri told the Abate, smilingly, that he\r\nmust decline the proffered match, and had not even the curiosity to\r\ninquire who the lady was. Shortly afterwards he was attacked by a\r\ndangerous illness, which reduced him to the point of death. On\r\nrecovering, he went with his friends to Kehl, and was so much pleased\r\nwith the printing establishment of the well-known Beaumarchais, that he\r\nresolved to have the whole of his works, with the exception of his\r\ntragedies, which were in Didot's hands, printed there; and accordingly,\r\nby August, 1789, all his writings, both in prose and poetry, were\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Countess of Albany had heard of the death of her\r\nhusband, which took place at Rome, on the 31st January, 1788. This event\r\nset her entirely free, and it is generally believed that she was shortly\r\nafterwards united in marriage to Alfieri; but the fact was never known,\r\nand to the last the poet preserved the greatest mystery on the subject.\r\n\r\nParis now became their regular residence, and it was not long before the\r\nrevolutionary troubles commenced. In April, 1791, they determined to pay\r\na visit to England, where the Countess had never been. They remained\r\nhere some months, and on their embarking at Dover on their return,\r\nAlfieri chanced to notice among the people collected on the beach to see\r\nthe vessel off, the very lady, his intrigue with whom twenty years\r\nbefore had excited so great a sensation. He did not speak to her, but\r\nsaw that she recognized him. Accordingly, on reaching Calais, he wrote\r\nto her to inquire into her present situation. He gives her reply at full\r\nlength in his _Memoirs_. It is in French; and we regret that its length\r\nprecludes us from giving it here, as it is a very remarkable production.\r\nIt indicates a decisive and inflexible firmness of character, very\r\nunlike what is usually met with in her sex.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Holland and Belgium, Alfieri and the Countess returned to\r\nParis. In March, 1792, he received intelligence of his mother's death.\r\nIn the mean time the war with the emperor commenced, and matters\r\ngradually got worse and worse. Alfieri witnessed the events of the\r\nterrible 10th of August, when the Tuileries was taken by the mob after a\r\nbloody conflict, and Louis XVI. virtually ceased to reign. Seeing the\r\ngreat danger to which they would be exposed if they remained longer in\r\nParis, they determined on a hasty flight; and after procuring the\r\nnecessary passports, started on the 18th of the same month. They had a\r\nnarrow escape on passing the barriers. A mob of the lowest order\r\ninsisted on their carriage being stopped, and on their being conducted\r\nback to Paris, exclaiming that all the rich were flying away, taking\r\ntheir treasures with them, and leaving the poor behind in want and\r\nmisery. The few soldiers on the spot would have been soon overpowered;\r\nand nothing saved the travellers except Alfieri's courage. He at length\r\nsucceeded in forcing a passage; but there is little doubt that if they\r\nhad been obliged to return, they would have been thrown into prison, in\r\nwhich case they would have been among the unhappy victims who were so\r\nbarbarously murdered by the populace on the 2d September.\r\n\r\nThey reached Calais in two days and a half, having had to show their\r\npassports more than forty times. They afterwards learned that they were\r\nthe first foreigners who had escaped from Paris and from France after\r\nthe catastrophe of the 10th August. After stopping some time at\r\nBrussels, they proceeded to Italy, and reached Florence in November.\r\nThat city remained Alfieri's dwelling-place, nearly uninterruptedly,\r\nfrom this moment to the period of his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, when he was forty-six years old, a feeling of shame came over\r\nhim at his ignorance of Greek, and he determined to master that\r\nlanguage. He applied himself with such industry to the task, that before\r\nvery long he could read almost any Greek author. There are few instances\r\non record of such an effort being made at so advanced a period of life.\r\nYet, perhaps, a still more remarkable case than that of our poet is that\r\nof Mehemet Ali, who did not learn to read or write till more than forty\r\nyears of age. His son, Ibrahim, never did even that. At the same time\r\nthat he was learning Greek, Alfieri amused himself by writing satires,\r\nof which he had completed seventeen by the end of 1797. The fruit of his\r\nGreek studies appeared in his tragedies of _Alceste Prima_ and _Alceste\r\nSeconda_, which he composed after reading Euripides' fine play of that\r\nname. He calls these essays his final perjuries to Apollo. We have\r\ncertainly seen him break his vow sufficiently often. The twelve\r\ntragedies he pledged himself not to exceed had now grown to their\r\npresent number of twenty-one, besides the tramelogedy of _Abel_.\r\n\r\nHe remained quietly and happily at Florence till the French invasion in\r\nMarch, 1799, when he and the Countess retired to a villa in the country.\r\nHe marked his hatred of the French nation by writing his _Misogallo_, a\r\nmiscellaneous collection in prose and verse of the most violent and\r\nindiscriminate abuse of France, and every thing connected with it, as\r\nits name imports. On the evacuation of Florence by the French in July,\r\nthey returned to the city, but again left it on the second invasion in\r\nOctober, 1800. The French commander-in-chief wrote to Alfieri,\r\nrequesting the honor of the acquaintance of a man who had rendered such\r\ndistinguished services to literature: but he told him in reply, that if\r\nhe wrote in his quality as Commandant of Florence, he would yield to his\r\nsuperior authority; but that if it was merely as an individual curious\r\nto see him, he must beg to be excused.\r\n\r\nWe now find him irresistibly impelled to try his hand at comedy, and he\r\naccordingly wrote the six which are published with his other works. They\r\nare entitled respectively, _L'Uno_, _I Pochi_, _Il Troppo_, _Tre Velene\r\nrimesta avrai l'Antido_, _La Finestrina_, and _Il Divorzio_. The first\r\nfour are political in their character, and written in iambics, like his\r\ntragedies. The last is the only one that can be ranked with modern\r\ncomedies. Sismondi truly remarks, that in these dramas he exhibits the\r\npowers of a great satirist, not of a successful dramatist.\r\n\r\nHis health was by this time seriously impaired, and he felt it necessary\r\nto cease entirely from his labors. On the 8th December, 1802, he put the\r\nfinishing stroke to his works, and amused himself for the short\r\nremainder of his life in writing the conclusion of his _Memoirs_.\r\nFeeling extremely proud at having overcome the difficulties of the Greek\r\nlanguage in his later years, he invented a collar, on which were\r\nengraved the names of twenty-three ancient and modern poets, and to\r\nwhich was attached a cameo representing Homer. On the back of it he\r\nwrote the following distich:\r\n\r\n[Greek:\r\n\r\n    Auton poiêsas Alphêrios hippe Homêron\r\n    Koiranikês timên êlphane zeioteran,]\r\n\r\nwhich may be thus Englished:\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance Alfieri made no great misnomer\r\n    When he dubb'd himself Knight of the Order of Homer.\"\r\n\r\nWith the account of this amusing little incident, Alfieri terminates the\r\nhistory of his life. The date it bears is the 14th of May, 1803, and on\r\nthe 8th October of the same year he breathed his last, in the\r\nfifty-fifth year of his age. The particulars of his death are given in a\r\nletter addressed by the Abate di Caluso to the Countess of Albany. An\r\nattack of gout in the stomach was the immediate cause of it. The\r\ndelicate state of his health greatly accelerated the progress of the\r\ndisease, which was still further promoted by his insisting on proceeding\r\nwith the correction of his works almost to the very last. He was so\r\nlittle aware of his impending dissolution, that he took a drive in a\r\ncarriage on the 3d October, and tried to the last moment to starve his\r\ngout into submission. He refused to allow leeches to be applied to his\r\nlegs, as the physicians recommended, because they would have prevented\r\nhim from walking. At this period, all his studies and labors of the last\r\nthirty years rushed through his mind; and he told the Countess, who was\r\nattending him, that a considerable number of Greek verses from the\r\nbeginning of Hesiod, which he had only read once in his life, recurred\r\nmost distinctly to his memory. His mortal agony came on so suddenly,\r\nthat there was not time to administer to him the last consolations of\r\nreligion. He was buried in the church of Santa Croce at Florence, where\r\nalready reposed the remains of Machiavelli, of Michael Angelo, and of\r\nGalileo. A monument to his memory, the work of the great Canova, was\r\nraised over his ashes by direction of the Countess of Albany.\r\n\r\nSuch then was Alfieri! And may we not draw a moral from the story of his\r\nlife as faintly and imperfectly shadowed forth in the preceding sketch?\r\nDoes it not show us how we may overcome obstacles deemed by us\r\ninsuperable, and how we may seek to become something better than what we\r\nare? The poet's name will go down to future ages as the idol of his\r\ncountrymen; may the beneficial effect produced by a mind like his upon\r\nthe character and aspirations of the world be enduring!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Dublin University Magazine\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF PAGANINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaganini was in all respects a very singular being, and an interesting\r\nsubject to study. His talents were by no means confined to his wonderful\r\npowers as a musician. On other subjects he was well informed, acute, and\r\nconversible, of bland and gentle manners, and in society, perfectly well\r\nbred. All this contrasted strangely with the dark, mysterious stories\r\nwhich were bruited abroad, touching some passages in his early life. But\r\noutward semblance and external deportment are treacherous as quicksands,\r\nwhen taken as guides by which to sound the real depths of human\r\ncharacter. Lord Byron remarks, that his pocket was once picked by the\r\ncivilest gentleman he ever conversed with, and that by far the mildest\r\nindividual of his acquaintance was the remorseless Ali Pacha of Yanina.\r\nThe expressive lineaments of Paganini told a powerful tale of passions\r\nwhich had been fearfully excited, which might be roused again from\r\ntemporary slumber, or were exhausted by indulgence and premature decay,\r\nleaving deep furrows to mark their intensity. Like the generality of his\r\ncountrymen, he looked much older than he was. With them, the elastic\r\nvigor of youth and manhood rapidly subside into an interminable and\r\njoyless old age, numbering as many years but with far less both of\r\nphysical and mental faculty, to render them endurable, than the more\r\nequally poised gradations of our northern clime. It is by no means\r\nunusual to encounter a well-developed Italian, whiskered to the\r\neyebrows, and \"bearded like the pard,\" who tells you, to your utter\r\nastonishment, that he is scarcely seventeen, when you have set him down\r\nfrom his appearance as, at least, five-and-thirty.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Colonel Montgomery Maxwell's book of Military\r\nReminiscences, entitled, \"My Adventures,\" dated Genoa, February 22nd,\r\n1815, supplies the earliest record which has been given to the public\r\nrespecting Paganini, and affords authentic evidence that some of the\r\nmysterious tales which heralded his coming were not without foundation.\r\nHe could scarcely have been at this time thirty years old. \"Talking of\r\nmusic, I have become acquainted with the most _outré_, most extravagant,\r\nand strangest character I ever beheld, or heard, in the musical line. He\r\nhas just been emancipated from durance vile, where he has been for a\r\nlong time incarcerated on suspicion of murder. His long figure, long\r\nneck, long face, and long forehead; his hollow and deadly pale cheek,\r\nlarge black eye, hooked nose, and jet black hair, which is long, and\r\nmore than half hiding his expressive, Jewish face; all these rendered\r\nhim the most extraordinary person I ever beheld. There is something\r\nscriptural in the _tout ensemble_ of the strange physiognomy of this\r\nuncouth and unearthly figure. Not that, as in times of old, he plays, as\r\nHoly Writ tells us, on a ten-stringed instrument; on the contrary, he\r\nbrings the most powerful, the most wonderful, and the most heart-rending\r\ntones from one string. His name is Paganini; he is very improvident and\r\nvery poor. The D----s, and the Impressario of the theatre got up a\r\nconcert for him the other night, which was well attended, and on which\r\noccasion he electrified the audience. He is a native of Genoa, and if I\r\nwere a judge of violin playing, I would pronounce him the most\r\nsurprising performer in the world!\"\r\n\r\nThat Paganini was either innocent of the charge for which he suffered\r\nthe incarceration Colonel Maxwell mentions, or that it could not be\r\nproved against him, may be reasonably inferred from the fact that he\r\nescaped the gallies of the executioner. In Italy, there was then, _par\r\nexcellence_ (whatever there may be now), a law for the rich, and another\r\nfor the poor. As he was without money, and unable to buy immunity, it is\r\ncharitable to suppose he was entitled to it from innocence. A nobleman,\r\nwith a few _zecchini_, was in little danger of the law, which confined\r\nits practice entirely to the lower orders. I knew a Sicilian prince, who\r\nmost wantonly blew a vassal's brains out, merely because he put him in a\r\npassion. The case was not even inquired into. He sent half a dollar to\r\nthe widow of the defunct (which, by the way, he borrowed from me, and\r\nnever repaid), and there the matter ended. Lord Nelson once suggested to\r\nFerdinand IV. of Naples, to try and check the daily increase of\r\nassassination, by a few salutary executions. \"No, no,\" replied old\r\nNasone, who was far from being as great a fool as he looked, \"that is\r\nimpossible. If I once began that system, my kingdom would soon be\r\ndepopulated. One half my subjects would be continually employed in\r\nhanging the remainder.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other peculiarities, Paganini was an incarnation of avarice and\r\nparsimony, with a most contradictory passion for gambling. He would\r\nhaggle with you for sixpence, and stake a rouleau on a single turn at\r\n_rouge et noir_. He screwed you down in a bargain as tightly as if you\r\nwere compressed in a vice; yet he had intervals of liberality, and\r\nsometimes did a generous action. In this he bore some resemblance to the\r\ncelebrated John Elwes, of miserly notoriety, who deprived himself of the\r\ncommon necessaries of life, and lived on a potato skin, but sometimes\r\ngave a check for £100 to a public charity, and contributed largely to\r\nprivate subscriptions. I never heard that Paganini actually did this,\r\nbut once or twice he played for nothing, and sent a donation to the\r\nMendicity, when he was in Dublin.\r\n\r\nWhen he made his engagement with me, we mutually agreed to write no\r\norders, expecting the house to be quite full every night, and both being\r\naware that the \"sons of freedom,\" while they add nothing to the\r\nexchequer, seldom assist the effect of the performance. They are not\r\ngiven to applaud vehemently; or, as Richelieu observes, \"in the right\r\nplaces.\" What we can get for nothing we are inclined to think much less\r\nof than that which we must purchase. He who invests a shilling will not\r\ndo it rashly, or without feeling convinced that value received will\r\naccrue from the risk. The man who pays is the real enthusiast; he comes\r\nwith a pre-determination to be amused, and his spirit is exalted\r\naccordingly. Paganini's valet surprised me one morning, by walking into\r\nmy room, and with many \"_eccellenzas_\" and gesticulations of respect,\r\nasking me to give him an order. I said, \"Why do you come to me? Apply to\r\nyour master--won't he give you one?\" \"Oh, yes; but I don't like to ask\r\nhim.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because he'll stop the amount out of my wages!\" My\r\nheart relented; I gave him the order, and paid Paganini the dividend. I\r\ntold him what it was, thinking, as a matter of course, he would return\r\nit. He seemed uncertain for a moment, paused, smiled sardonically,\r\nlooked at the three and sixpence, and with a spasmodic twitch, deposited\r\nit in his own waistcoat pocket instead of mine. Voltaire says, \"no man\r\nis a hero to his valet de chambre,\" meaning, thereby, as I suppose, that\r\nbeing behind the scenes of every-day life, he finds out that Marshal\r\nSaxe, or Frederick the Great, is as subject to the common infirmities of\r\nour nature, as John Nokes or Peter Styles. Whether Paganini's squire of\r\nthe body looked on his master as a hero in the vulgar acceptation of the\r\nword, I cannot say, but in spite of his stinginess, which he writhed\r\nunder, he regarded him with mingled reverence and terror. \"A strange\r\nperson, your master,\" observed I. \"_Signor_,\" replied the faithful\r\nSancho Panza, \"_e veramente grand uomo, ma da non potersi comprendere_.\"\r\n\"He is truly a great man, but quite incomprehensible.\" It was edifying\r\nto observe the awful importance with which Antonio bore the instrument\r\nnightly intrusted to his charge to carry to and from the theatre. He\r\nconsidered it an animated something, whether demon or angel he was\r\nunable to determine, but this he firmly believed, that it could speak in\r\nactual dialogue when his master pleased, or become a dumb familiar by\r\nthe same controlling volition. This especial violin was Paganini's\r\ninseparable companion. It lay on his table before him as he sat\r\nmeditating in his solitary chamber; it was placed by his side at dinner,\r\nand on a chair within his reach when in bed. If he woke, as he\r\nconstantly did, in the dead of night, and the sudden _estro_ of\r\ninspiration seized him, he grasped his instrument, started up, and on\r\nthe instant perpetuated the conception which otherwise he would have\r\nlost for ever. This marvellous Cremona, valued at four hundred guineas,\r\nPaganini, on his death-bed, gave to De Kontski, his nephew and only\r\npupil, himself an eminent performer, and in his possession it now\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nWhen Paganini was in Dublin, at the musical festival of 1830, the\r\nMarquis of Anglesea, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, came every night\r\nto the concerts at the theatre, and was greatly pleased with his\r\nperformance. On the first evening, between the acts, his Excellency\r\ndesired that he might be brought round to his box, to be introduced, and\r\npaid him many compliments. Lord Anglesea was at that time residing in\r\nperfect privacy with his family at Sir Harcourt Lee's country house,\r\nnear Blackrock, and expressed a wish to get an evening from the great\r\nviolinist, to gratify his domestic circle. The negotiation was rather a\r\ndifficult one, as Paganini was, of all others, the man who did nothing\r\nin the way of business without an explicit understanding, and a\r\nclearly-defined con-si-de-ra-tion. He was alive to the advantages of\r\nhonor, but he loved money with a paramount affection. I knew that he had\r\nreceived enormous terms, such as £150 and £200 for fiddling at private\r\nparties in London, and I trembled for the vice-regal purse; but I\r\nundertook to manage the affair, and went to work accordingly. The\r\naid-de-camp in waiting called with me on Paganini, was introduced in due\r\nform, and handed him a card of invitation to dinner, which, of course,\r\nhe received and accepted with ceremonious politeness. Soon after the\r\nofficer had departed, he said suddenly, \"This is a great honor, but am I\r\nexpected to bring my instrument?\" \"Oh, yes,\" I replied, \"as a matter of\r\ncourse--the Lord Lieutenant's family wish to hear you in private.\"\r\n\"_Caro amico_,\" rejoined he, with petrifying composure, \"_Paganini con\r\nviolino e Paganini senza violino,--ecco due animali distinti_.\"\r\n\"Paganini with his fiddle and Paganini without it are two very different\r\npersons.\" I knew perfectly what he meant, and said, \"The Lord Lieutenant\r\nis a nobleman of exalted rank and character, liberal in the extreme, but\r\nhe is not Croesus; nor do I think you could with any consistency\r\nreceive such an honor as dining at his table, and afterwards send in a\r\nbill for playing two or three tunes in the evening.\" He was staggered,\r\nand asked, \"What do you advise?\" I said, \"Don't you think a present, in\r\nthe shape of a ring, or a snuff-box, or something of that sort, with a\r\nshort inscription, would be a more agreeable mode of settlement?\" He\r\nseemed tickled by this suggestion, and closed with it at once. I\r\ndispatched the intelligence through the proper channel, that the violin\r\nand the _grand maestro_ would both be in attendance. He went in his very\r\nchoicest mood, made himself extremely agreeable, played away,\r\nunsolicited, throughout the evening, to the delight of the whole party,\r\nand on the following morning a gold snuff-box was duly presented to him,\r\nwith a few complimentary words engraved on the lid.\r\n\r\nA year or two after this, when Paganini was again in England, I thought\r\nanother engagement might be productive, as his extraordinary attraction\r\nappeared still to increase. I wrote to him on the subject, and soon\r\nreceived a very courteous communication, to the effect, that although he\r\nhad not contemplated including Ireland in his tour, yet he had been so\r\nimpressed by the urbanity of the Dublin public, and had moreover\r\nconceived such a personal esteem for my individual character, that he\r\nmight be induced to alter his plans, at some inconvenience, provided\r\nalways I could make him a more enticing proposal than the former one. I\r\nwas here completely puzzled, as on that occasion I gave him a clear\r\ntwo-thirds of each receipt, with a bonus of twenty-five pounds per night\r\nin addition, for two useless coadjutors. I replied, that having duly\r\ndeliberated on his suggestion, and considered the terms of our last\r\ncompact, I saw no possible means of placing the new one in a more\r\nalluring shape, except by offering him the entire produce of the\r\nengagement. After I had dispatched my letter, I repented bitterly, and\r\nwas terrified lest he should think me serious, and hold me to the\r\nbargain; but he deigned no answer, and this time I escaped for the\r\nfright I had given myself. When in London, I called to see him, and met\r\nwith a cordial reception; but he soon alluded to the late\r\ncorrespondence, and half seriously said, \"That was a curious letter you\r\nwrote to me, and the joke with which you concluded it by no means a good\r\none.\" \"Oh,\" said I, laughing, \"it would have been much worse if you had\r\ntaken me at my word.\" He then laughed too, and we parted excellent\r\nfriends. I never saw him again. He returned to the Continent, and died,\r\nhaving purchased the title of Baron, with a patent of nobility, from\r\nsome foreign potentate, which, with his accumulated earnings, somewhat\r\ndilapidated by gambling, he bequeathed to his only son. Paganini was the\r\nfounder of his school, and the original inventor of those extraordinary\r\n_tours de force_ with which all his successors and imitators are\r\naccustomed to astonish the uninitiated. But he still stands at the head\r\nof the list, although eminent names are included in it, and is not\r\nlikely to be pushed from his pedestal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJulius Cornet of Hamburgh understands thirty-eight different languages,\r\nnot in the superficial manner of Elihu Burritt, but so well that he is\r\nable to write them with correctness, and to make translations from one\r\ninto the other. He has issued a circular to the German public, offering\r\nhis services as a universal translator, and refers to some of the most\r\nprominent publishers of Leipsic, whom he has many years served in that\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY OF FRENCH JOURNALISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFraser's magazine contains a reviewal of Texier's new book on the Paris\r\njournals and editors, from which we copy the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DÉBATS.\r\n\r\nThe _Débats_ is chiefly read by wealthy landed proprietors, public\r\nfunctionaries, the higher classes of the magistracy, the higher classes\r\nof merchants and manufacturers, by the agents de change, barristers,\r\nnotaries, and what we in England would call country gentlemen. Its\r\ncirculation we should think 10,000. If it circulate 12,000 now, it\r\ncertainly must have considerably risen since 1849.\r\n\r\nThe chief editor of the _Débats_ is Armand Bertin. He was brought up in\r\nthe school of his father, and is now about fifty years of age, or\r\nprobably a little more. M. Bertin is a man of _esprit_, and of literary\r\ntastes, with the habits, feelings, and demeanor of a well-bred\r\ngentleman. Of an agreeable and facile commerce, the editor of the\r\n_Débats_ is a man of elegant and Epicurean habits; but does not allow\r\nhis luxurious tastes to interfere with the business of this nether\r\nworld. According to M. Texier, he reads with his own proprietary and\r\neditorial eyes all the voluminous correspondence of the office on his\r\nreturn from the _salon_ in which he has been spending the evening. If in\r\nthe forenoon there is any thing of importance to learn in any quarter of\r\nParis, M. Bertin is on the scent, and seldom fails to run down his game.\r\nAt a certain hour in the day he appears in the Rue des Prêtres, in which\r\nthe office of the _Débats_ is situate, and there assigns to his\r\ncollaborators their daily task. The compiler of the volume before us,\r\nwho, as we stated, is himself connected with the Parisian press, writing\r\nin the _Siècle_, and who, it may therefore be supposed, has had good\r\nopportunities for information, states that, previous to the passing of\r\nthe Tinguy law, M. Bertin never wrote in his own journal, but contented\r\nhimself with giving to the products of so many pens the necessary\r\nhomogeneity. But be this as it may, it is certain he has often written\r\nsince the law requires the _signature obligatoire_.\r\n\r\nUnder the Monarchy of the Barricades the influence of M. Bertin was most\r\nconsiderable, yet he only used this influence to obtain orders and\r\ndecorations for his contributors. As to himself, to his honor and glory\r\nbe it stated, that he never stuck the smallest bit of riband to his own\r\nbuttonhole, or, during the seventeen years of the monarchy of July, ever\r\nonce put his feet inside the Tuileries. At the Italian Opera or the\r\nVariétés, sometimes at the Café de Paris, the Maison Dorée, or the Trois\r\nFrères, M. Bertin may be seen enjoying the music, or his dinner and\r\nwine, but never was he a servile courtier or trencher-follower of the\r\nMonarch of the Barricades. It is after these enjoyments, or after his\r\n_petit souper_, that M. Bertin proceeds for the last time for the day,\r\nor rather the night, to the office of the paper. There shutting himself\r\nup in his cabinet, he calls for proofs, reads them, and when he has seen\r\nevery thing, and corrected every thing, he then gives the final and\r\nauthoritative order to go to press, and towards two o'clock in the\r\nmorning turns his steps homeward. M. Bertin, says our author with some\r\nmalice, belongs to that class of corpulent men so liked by Cæsar and\r\nLouis Phillippe. Personally, M. Bertin has no reverence for what is\r\ncalled nobility, either ancient or modern. He is of the school of\r\nChaussée d'Antin, which would set the rich and intelligent middle\r\nclasses in the places formerly occupied by _Messieurs les Grands\r\nSeigneurs_.\r\n\r\nThe ablest man, connected with the _Débats_, or indeed, at this moment,\r\nwith the press of France, is M. DE SACY. De Sacy is an advocate by\r\nprofession, and pleaded in his youth some causes with considerable\r\nsuccess. At a very early period of his professional existence he allied\r\nhimself with the _Débats_. His articles are distinguished by ease and\r\nflow, yet by a certain gravity and weight, which is divested, however,\r\nof the disgusting doctoral tone. He is, in truth, a solid and serious\r\nwriter, without being in the least degree heavy. Political men of the\r\nold school read his papers with pleasure, and most foreigners may read\r\nthem with profit and instruction. M. de Sacy is a simple, modest, and\r\nretiring gentleman, of great learning, and a taste and tact very\r\nuncommon for a man of so much learning. Though he has been for more than\r\na quarter of a century influentially connected with the _Débats_, and\r\nhas, during eighteen or twenty years of the period, had access to men in\r\nthe very highest positions--to ministers, ambassadors, to the sons of a\r\nking, and even to the late king himself, it is much to his credit that\r\nhe has contented himself with a paltry riband and a modest place, as\r\nConservateur de la Bibliothèque Mazarine. M. de Sacy belongs to a\r\nJansenist family. _Apropos_ of this, M. Texier tells a pleasant story\r\nconcerning him. A Roman Catholic writer addressing him one day in the\r\nsmall gallery reserved for the journalist at the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nsaid, \"You are a man, M. de Sacy, of too much cleverness, and of too\r\nmuch honesty, not to be one of us, sooner or later.\" \"Not a bit of it,\"\r\nreplied promptly M. de Sacy; \"_je veux vivre et mourir avec un pied dans\r\nle doute et l'autre dans la foi_.\"\r\n\r\nSAINT-MARC GIRARDIN is certainly, next to De Sacy, the most\r\ndistinguished writer connected with the _Débats_. He was originally a\r\n_maître d'étude_ at the College of Henry IV., and sent one fine morning\r\nan article to the _Débats_, which produced a wonderful sensation. The\r\narticle was without name or address; but old Bertin so relished and\r\nappreciated it, that he was not to be foiled in finding out the author.\r\nAn advertisement was inserted on the following day, requesting the\r\nwriter to call at the editor's study, when M. Saint-Marc Girardin was\r\nattached as a regular _soldat de plume_ to the establishment--a\r\nprofitable engagement, which left him at liberty to leave his miserable\r\n_métier_ of _maître d'étude_. The articles written in 1834 against the\r\nEmperor of Russia and the Russian system were from the pen of M.\r\nGirardin.--The _maître d'étude_ of former days became professor at the\r\nCollege of France--became deputy, and exhibited himself, able writer and\r\ndialectician as he was and is, as a mediocre speaker, and ultimately\r\nbecame academician and _un des quarante_.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished writer in the _Débats_ is Michel Chevalier.\r\nChevalier is an _élève_ of the Polytechnic School, who originally wrote\r\nin the _Globe_. When editor and _gérant_ of the _Globe_, he was\r\ncondemned to six months' imprisonment for having developed in that\r\njournal the principles of St. Simonianism. Before the expiration of his\r\nsentence he was appointed by the Government to a sort of travelling\r\ncommission to America; and from that country he addressed a series of\r\nmemorable letters to the _Débats_, which produced at the time immense\r\neffect. Since that period, Chevalier was appointed Professor of\r\nPolitical Economy at the College of France, a berth from whence he was\r\nremoved by Carnot, Minister of Public Instruction, but afterwards\r\nreinstated by subsequent ministers. Chevalier, though an able man, is\r\nyet more of an economic writer than a political disquisitionist. His\r\nbrother Augustus is Secretary-general of the Elysée.\r\n\r\nAmong the other contributors are PHILARETE CHASLES, an excellent\r\nclassical scholar, and a man well acquainted with English literature;\r\nCuvillier Fleury, unquestionably a man of taste and talent; and the\r\ncelebrated Jules Janin. The productions of the latter as a\r\n_feuilletoniste_ are so well known that we do not stop to dwell upon\r\nthem. Janin is not without merit, and he is highly popular with a\r\ncertain class of writers: but his articles after all, apart from the\r\ncircumstances of the day, are but a _rechauffé_ of the style of\r\nMarivaux.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONNEL.\r\n\r\nThe history of the _Constitutionnel_ follows that of the _Débats_. The\r\n_Débats_, says M. Texier, is ingenious, has tact without enthusiasm,\r\nbanters with taste, and scuds before the wind with a grace which only\r\nbelongs to a _fin voilier_--to a fast sailing clipper. But, on the other\r\nhand, none of these qualities are found in the _Constitutionnel_, which,\r\nthough often hot, and not seldom vehement and vulgar, is almost\r\nuniformly heavy. For three-and-thirty years--that is to say, from 1815\r\nto 1848--the _Constitutionnel_ traded in Voltairien principles, in\r\nvehement denunciations of the _Parti Prêtre_ and of the Jesuits, and in\r\nthe intrigues of the emigrants and royalist party _quand même_. For many\r\nyears the literary giant of this Titanic warfare was Etienne, who had\r\nbeen in early life secretary to Maret, duke of Bassano, himself a\r\nmediocre journalist, though an excellent reporter and stenographer.\r\nEtienne was a man of _esprit_ and talent, who had commenced his career\r\nas a writer in the _Minerve Française_. In this miscellany, his letters\r\non Paris acquired as much vogue as his comedies. About 1818, Etienne\r\nacquired a single share in the _Constitutionnel_, and after a year's\r\nservice became impregnated with the air of the Rue Montmartre--with the\r\nspirit of the _genius loci_. When one has been some time writing for a\r\ndaily newspaper, this result is sure to follow. One gets habituated to\r\nset phrases--to pet ideas--to the traditions of the locality--to the\r\nprejudices of the readers, political or religious, as the case may be.\r\nIndependently of this, the daily toil of newspaper writing is such, and\r\nso exhausting, that a man obliged to undergo it for any length of time\r\nis glad occasionally to find refuge in words without ideas, which have\r\noccasionally much significancy with the million, or in topics on which\r\nthe public love to dwell fondly. Under the reign of Louis XVIII. and\r\nCharles X. it lost no opportunity, by indirection and innuendo, of\r\nhinting at the \"Petit Caporal,\" and this circumstance during the life of\r\nthe emperor, and long after his death, caused the journal to be\r\nadored--that is really the word--by the old army, by the _vieux de\r\nvieille_, and by the _durs à cuirs_. In these good old bygone times the\r\nwriters in the _Constitutionel_ wore a blue frock closely buttoned up to\r\nthe chin, to the end that they might pass for officers of the old army\r\non half-pay. In 1830 the fortunes of the _Constitutionnel_ had reached\r\nthe culminant point. It then counted 23,000 subscribers, at 80 francs a\r\nyear. At that period a single share in the property was a fortune. But\r\nthe avatar of the Citizen King spoiled in a couple of years the sale of\r\nthe citizen journal. The truth is, that the heat of the Revolution of\r\nJuly had engendered and incubated a multitude of journals, great and\r\nlittle, bounding with young blood and health--journals whose editors and\r\nwriters did not desire better sport than to attack the _Constitutionnel_\r\nat right and at left, and to tumble the dear, fat, rubicund, old\r\ngentleman, head over heels. Among these was the _Charivari_, which\r\nincontinently laughed at the whole system of the establishment, from the\r\ncrapulous, corpulent, and Voltairien Etienne, down to the lowest\r\nprinter's devil. The metaphors, the puffs, _canards_, the _réclames_,\r\n&c. of the _Constitutionnel_ were treated mercilessly and as\r\nnothing--not even Religion itself can stand the test of ridicule among\r\nso mocking a people as the French; the result was, that the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ diminished wonderfully in point of circulation. Yet\r\nthe old man wrote and spoke well, and had, from 1824 to 1829, as an ally\r\nthe sharp and clever Thiers, and the better read, the better informed,\r\nand the more judicious Mignet. It was during the Vitelle administration\r\nthat the _Constitutionnel_ attained the very highest acme of its fame.\r\nIt was then said to have had 30,000 subscribers, and to have maintained\r\nthem with the cry of \"Down with the Jesuits!\" In 1827-28, during its\r\npalmiest days, the _Constitutionnel_ had no _Roman feuilleton_. It\r\ndepended then on its leading articles, nor was it till its circulation\r\ndeclined, in 1843, to about 3500, that the proprietors determined to\r\nreduce the price one-half. They then, too, adopted the _Roman\r\nfeuilleton_, giving as much as 500 francs for an article of this kind to\r\nDumas or Sue. From 1845 or 1846 to 1848, the _Consitutionnel_ had most\r\nable contributors of leading articles; Thiers, De Remusat, and Duvergier\r\nd'Hauranne, having constantly written in its columns. The circulation of\r\nthe journal was then said to amount to 24,000. When the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ entered into the hands of its present proprietor,\r\nDocteur Louis Veron, it was said to be reduced to 3000 subscribers. How\r\nmany subscribers it has now we have no very accurate means of knowing,\r\nbut we should say, at a rough guess, it may have 9000 or 10,000. It\r\nshould be remembered, that from being an anti-sacerdotal journal it has\r\nbecome a priests' paper and the organ of priests; from being an opponent\r\nof the executive, it has become the organ and the apologist of the\r\nexecutive in the person of M. L. N. Buonaparte, and the useful\r\ninstrument, it is said, of M. Achille Fould. Every body knows, says M.\r\nTexier, with abundant malice prepense, that Dr. Veron, the chief editor\r\nof the _Constitutionnel_, has declared that France may henceforth place\r\nher head on the pillow and go quietly to sleep, for the doctor\r\nconfidently answers for the good faith and wisdom of the president.\r\n\r\nBut who is DOCTOR VERON, the editor-in-chief, when one finds his\r\nexcellency _chezelle_? The ingenuous son of Esculapius tells us himself\r\nthat he has known the _coulisses_ (the phrase is a queer one) of\r\nscience, of the arts, of politics, and even of the opera. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the dear doctor is the son of a stationer of the Rue du\r\nBac, who began his career by studying medicine. If we are to believe\r\nhimself, his career was a most remarkable one. In 1821 he was received\r\nwhat is called an _interne_ of the Hôtel Dieu. After having walked the\r\nhospitals, he enrolled himself in the Catholic and Apostolic Society of\r\n'_bonnes lettres_,' collaborated with the writers in the _Quotidienne_,\r\nand, thanks to Royalist patronage, was named physician-in-chief of the\r\nRoyal Museums. Whether any of the groups in the pictures of Rubens,\r\nSalvator Rosa, Teniers, Claude, or Poussin--whether any of the Torsos of\r\nPraxiteles, or even of a more modern school, required the assiduous care\r\nor attention of a skilful physician, we do not pretend to state. But we\r\nrepeat that the practice of Dr. Veron, according to M. Texier, was\r\nconfined to these dumb yet not inexpressive personages. In feeling the\r\npulse of the Venus de Medici, or looking at the tongue of the Laocoon,\r\nor the Apollo Belvidere, it is said the chief, if not the only practice\r\nof Dr. Louis Veron consisted. True, the doctor invented a _pâte\r\npectorale_, approved by all the emperors and kings in Europe, and very\r\nrenowned, too, among the commonalty; but so did Dr. Solomon, of Gilead\r\nHouse, near Liverpool, invent a balm of Gilead, and Mrs. Cockle invent\r\nanti-bilious pills, taken by many of the judges, a majority of the\r\nbench of bishops, and some admirals of the blue, and general officers\r\nwithout number, yet we have never heard that Moses Solomon or Tabitha\r\nCockle were renowned in the practice of physic, notwithstanding the said\r\nGilead and the before-mentioned pills. Be this, however, as it may,\r\nVeron, after having doctored the pictures and statues, and\r\npatepectoraled the Emperor, the Pope, the Grand Turk, the Imaum of\r\nMuscat, the Shah of Persia, and the Great Mogul himself, next\r\nestablished the _Review of Paris_, which in its turn he abandoned to\r\nbecome the director of the Opera. Tired of the Opera after four or five\r\nyears' service, the doctor became a candidate of the dynastic opposition\r\nat Brest. This was the \"artful dodge\" before the Revolution of July\r\n1848, if we may thus translate an untranslateable phrase of the\r\ndoctor's. At Brest the professor of the healing art failed, and the\r\nconsequence was, that instead of being a deputy he became the proprietor\r\nof the _Constitutionnel_. Fortunate man that he is! In _Robert le\r\nDiable_ at the Opera, which he would not at first have at any price, the\r\nson of Esculapius found the principal source of his fortune, and by the\r\n_Juif Errant_ of Eugène Sue, for which he gave 100,000 francs, he saved\r\nthe _Constitutionnel_ from perdition. _Apropos_ of this matter, there is\r\na pleasant story abroad. When Veron purchased the _Constitutionnel_,\r\nThiers was writing his _Histoire du Consulat_, for which the booksellers\r\nhad agreed to give 500,000 francs. Veron wished to have the credit of\r\npublishing the book in the _Constitutionnel_, and with this view waited\r\non Thiers, offering to pay down, _argent comptant_, one-half the money.\r\nThiers, though pleased with the proposition, yet entrenched himself\r\nbehind his engagement with the booksellers. To one of the leading\r\nbooksellers Veron trotted off post-haste, and opened the business. \"Oh!\"\r\nsaid the sensible publisher, \"you have mistaken your _coup_ altogether.\"\r\n\"How so?\" said the doctor. \"Don't you see,\" said the Libraire Editeur,\r\n\"that the rage is Eugène Sue, and that the _Débats_ and the _Presse_ are\r\nat fistycuffs to obtain the next novelty of the author of the _Mystères\r\nde Paris_? Go you and offer as much again for this novel, whatever it\r\nmay be, as either the one or other of them, and the fortune of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ is made.\" The doctor took the advice, and purchased\r\nthe next novelty of Sue at 100,000 francs. This turned out to be the\r\n_Juif Errant_, which raised the circulation of the _Constitutionnel_ to\r\n24,000.\r\n\r\nVeron is a puffy-faced little man, with an overgrown body, and midriff\r\nsustained upon an attenuated pair of legs; his visage is buried in an\r\nimmense shirt collar, stiff and starched as a Norman cap. Dr. Veron\r\nbelieves himself the key-stone of the Elyséan arch, and that the weight\r\nof the government is on his shoulders. Look at him as he enters the Café\r\nde Paris to eat his _purée à la Condé_, and his _suprême de volaille_,\r\nand his _filet de chevreuil piqué aux truffes_, and you would say that\r\nhe is not only the prime, but the favorite minister of Louis Napoleon,\r\n_par la grace de Dieu et Monsieur le Docteur Président de la\r\nRépublique_. \"_Après tout c'est un mauvais drôle, que ce pharmacien_,\"\r\nto use the term applied to the doctor by General Changarnier.\r\n\r\nA short man of the name of Boilay washes the dirty linen of Dr. Veron,\r\nand corrects his faults of grammar, of history, &c. Boilay is a small,\r\nsharp, stout, little man, self-possessed, self-satisfied, with great\r\nreadiness and tact. Give him but the heads of a subject and he can make\r\nout a very readable and plausible article. Boilay is the real working\r\neditor of the _Constitutionnel_, and is supported by a M. Clarigny, a M.\r\nMalitourne, and others not more known or more respected. Garnier de\r\nCassagnac, of the _Pouvoir_, a man of very considerable talent, though\r\nnot of very fixed principle, writes occasionally in the\r\n_Constitutionnel_, and more ably than any of the other contributors. M.\r\nSt. Beuve is the literary critic, and he performs his task with eminent\r\nability.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _National_, founded by Carrel, Mignet, and Thiers. It\r\nwas agreed between the triad that each should take the place of\r\n_rédacteur en chef_ for a year. Thiers, as the oldest and most\r\nexperienced, was the first installed, and conducted the paper with zest\r\nand spirit till the Revolution of 1830 broke out. The _National_ set out\r\nwith the idea of changing the incorrigible dynasty, and instituting\r\nOrléanism in the place of it. The refusal to pay taxes and to contribute\r\nto a budget was a proposition of the _National_, and it is not going too\r\nfar to say, that the crisis of 1830 was hastened by this journal. It was\r\nat the office of the _National_ that the famous protest, proclaiming the\r\nright of resistance, was composed and signed by Thiers, De Remusat, and\r\nCanchois Lemaire. On the following day the office of the journal was\r\nbombarded by the police and an armed force, when the presses were\r\nbroken. Against this illegal violence the editors protested. After the\r\nRevolution, Carrel assumed the conduct of the journal, and became the\r\nfirmest as well as the ablest organ of democracy. To the arbitrary and\r\narrogant Perier, he opposed a firm and uncompromising resistance. Every\r\none acquainted with French politics at that epoch is aware of the\r\nstrenuous and stand-up fight he made for five years for his principles.\r\nHe it was who opposed a bold front to military bullies, and who invented\r\nthe epithet _traîneurs de sabre_. This is not the place to speak of the\r\ntalent of Carrel. He was shot in a miserable quarrel in 1836, by Emile\r\nGirardin, then, as now, the editor of the _Presse_. On the death of\r\nCarrel, the shareholders of the paper assembled together to name a\r\nsuccessor. M. Trelat, subsequently minister, was fixed upon. But as he\r\nwas then a _détenu_ at Clairvaux, Bastide and Littré filled the\r\neditorial chair during the interregnum. On the release of Trelat, it was\r\nsoon discovered that he had not the peculiar talent necessary. The\r\nsceptre of authority passed into the hands of M. Bastide, named\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs in the ending of 1848, or the beginning of\r\n1849. M. Bastide, then a _marchand de bois_, divided his editorial\r\nempire with M. Armand Marrast, who had been a political prisoner and a\r\nrefugee in England, and who returned to France on the amnesty granted on\r\nthe marriage of the Duke of Orleans. M. Marrast, though a disagreeable,\r\nself-sufficient, and underbred person, was unquestionably a writer of\r\npoint, brilliancy, and vigor. From 1837 to the Revolution of 1848 he was\r\nconnected with the _National_, and was the author of a series of\r\narticles which have not been equalled since. Like all low, vulgar-bred,\r\nand reptile-minded persons, Marrast forgot himself completely when\r\nraised to the position of President of the Chamber of Deputies. In this\r\nposition he made irreconcileable enemies of all his old colleagues, and\r\nof most persons who came into contact with him. The fact is, that your\r\nschoolmaster and pedagogue can rarely become a gentleman, or any thing\r\nlike a gentleman. The writers in the _National_ at the present moment\r\nare, M. Léopold Duras, M. Alexandre Rey, Caylus, Cochut, Forques,\r\nLittré, Paul de Musset, Colonel Charras, and several others whose names\r\nit is not necessary to mention here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIÈCLE.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the _Siècle_, a journal which, though only established in\r\n1836, has, we believe, a greater sale than any journal in Paris--at\r\nleast, had a greater sale previous to the Revolution of February 1848.\r\nThe _Siècle_ was the first journal that started at the low price of 40\r\nfrancs a-year, when almost every other newspaper was purchased at a cost\r\nof 70 or 80 francs. It should also be recollected, that it was published\r\nunder the auspices of the deputies of the constitutional opposition. The\r\n_Siècle_ was said, in 1846, to have had 42,000 subscribers. Its then\r\neditor was M. Chambolle, who abandoned the concern in February or March\r\n1849, not being able to agree with M. Louis Perrée, the _directeur_ of\r\nthe journal. Since Chambolle left a journal which he had conducted for\r\nthirteen years, M. Perrée has died in the flower of his age, mourned by\r\nthose connected with the paper, and regretted by the public at large.\r\nPrevious to the Revolution of 1848, Odillon Barrot and Gustave de\r\nBeaumont took great interest and an active part in the management of the\r\n_Siècle_. That positive, dogmatical, self-opinioned, and indifferent\r\nnewspaper writer, Léon Faucher, was then one of the principal\r\ncontributors to this journal. The _Siècle_ of 1851 is somewhat what the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ was in 1825, 6, and 7. It is eminently City-like and\r\nof the _bourgeoisie_, \"earth, earthy,\" as a good, reforming, economic\r\nNational Guard ought to be. The success of the journal is due to this\r\nspirit, and to the eminently fair, practical, and business-like manner\r\nin which it has been conducted. Perrée, the late editor and manager of\r\nthe journal, who died at the early age of 34, was member for the Manche.\r\nThe writers in the journal are Louis Jourdan, formerly a St. Simonian;\r\nPierre Bernard, who was secretary to Armand Carrel; Hippolite Lamarche,\r\nan ex-cavalry captain; Auguste Jullien (son of Jullien de Paris, one of\r\nthe commissaries of Robespierre); and others whom it is needless to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESSE.\r\n\r\nThe _Presse_ was founded in 1836, about the same time as the _Siècle_,\r\nby Emile de Girardin, a son of General de Girardin, it is said, by an\r\nEnglish mother. Till that epoch of fifteen years ago, people in Paris or\r\nin France had no idea of a journal exceeding in circulation 25,000\r\ncopies, the circulation of the _Constitutionnel_, or of a newspaper\r\ncosting less than seventy or eighty francs per annum. Many journals had\r\ncontrived to live on respectably enough on a modest number of 4000 or\r\n5000 _abonnés_. But the conductors of the _Presse_ and of the _Siècle_\r\nwere born to operate a revolution in this routine and jog-trot of\r\nnewspaper life. They reduced the subscription to newspapers from eighty\r\nto forty francs per annum, producing as good if not a better article.\r\nThis was a great advantage to the million, and it induced parties to\r\nsubscribe for, and read a newspaper, more especially in the country, who\r\nnever thought of reading a newspaper before. In constituting his new\r\npress, M. Girardin entirely upset and rooted out all the old notions\r\ntheretofore prevailing as to the conduct of a journal. The great feature\r\nin the new journal was not its leading articles, but its _Roman\r\nfeuilleton_, by Dumas, Sue, &c. This it was that first brought Socialism\r\ninto extreme vogue among the working classes. True the _Presse_ was not\r\nthe first to publish Socialist _feuilletons_, but the _Débats_ and the\r\n_Constitutionnel_. But the _Presse_ was the first to make the leading\r\narticle subsidiary to the _feuilleton_. It was, even when not a\r\nprofessed Socialist, a great promoter of Socialism, by the thorough\r\nsupport which it lent to all the slimy, jesuitical corruptions of\r\nGuizoism, and all the turpitudes and chicanery of Louis Philippism. When\r\nthe _Presse_ was not a year old it had 15,000 subscribers, and before it\r\nwas twelve years old the product of its advertisements amounted to\r\n150,000 francs a-year. Indeed this journal has the rare merit of being\r\nthe first to teach the French the use, and we must add the abuse, of\r\nadvertisements. We fear the _Presse_, during these early days of the\r\ngentle Emile and Granier Cassagnac, was neither a model of virtue,\r\ndisinterestedness, nor self-denial. Nor do we know that it is so now,\r\neven under the best of Republics. There are strange tales abroad, even\r\nallowing for the exaggeration of Rumor with her hundred tongues. One\r\nthing, however, is clear; that the _Presse_ was a liberal paymaster to\r\nits _feuilletonistes_. To Dumas, Sand, De Balzac, Théophile Gautier, and\r\nJules Sandeau, it four years ago paid 300 francs per day for\r\ncontributions. The _Presse_, as M. Texier says, is now less the\r\ncollective reason of a set of writers laboring to a common intent, than\r\nthe expression of the individual activity, energy, and wonderful\r\nmobility of M. Girardin himself. The _Presse_ is Emile de Girardin, with\r\nhis boldness, his audacity, his rampant agility, his Jim Crowism, his\r\ninexhaustible cleverness, wonderful fecundity, and indisputable talent.\r\nThe _Presse_ is bold and daring; but no man can tell the color of its\r\npolitics to-day, much less three days, or three months hence. On the\r\n25th of July, 1848, it was as audacious, as unabashed, and as little\r\ndisconcerted as two days before. When the workmen arrived in crowds to\r\nbreak its presses, the ingenious Emile threw open the doors of the\r\npress-room, talked and reasoned with the greasy rogues, and sent them\r\ncontented away.\r\n\r\nThe number of journals in Paris is greater--much greater,\r\nrelatively--than the number existing in London. The people of Paris love\r\nand study a newspaper more than the people of London, and take a greater\r\ninterest in public affairs, and more especially in questions of foreign\r\npolicy. Previous to the Revolution of February 1848, it cannot, we\r\nthink, be denied that newspaper writers in France held a much higher\r\nrank than contributors to the daily press in England, and even still\r\nthey continue to hold a higher and more influential position, though\r\nthere can be no good reason why they should have done so at either time.\r\nFor the last fifteen years there cannot be any doubt or question that\r\nthe leading articles in the four principal daily London morning papers\r\nexhibit an amount of talent, energy, information, readiness, and\r\ncompression, which are not found in such perfect and wonderful\r\ncombination in the French press.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, however, the press of France has wonderfully\r\ndeteriorated. It is no longer what it was antecedent to the Revolution.\r\nThere is not the literary skill, the artistical ability, the energy, the\r\nlearning, and the eloquence which theretofore existed. The class of\r\nwriters in newspapers now are an inferior class in attainments, in\r\nscholarship, and in general ability. There can be little doubt, we\r\nconceive, that the press greatly increased and abused its power, for\r\nsome years previous to 1848. This led to the decline of its\r\ninfluence--an influence still daily diminishing; but withal, even still\r\nthe press in France has more influence, and enjoys more social and\r\nliterary consideration, than the press in England. We believe that\r\nnewspaper writers in France are not now so generally well paid as they\r\nwere twenty or thirty years ago. Two or three eminent writers can always\r\ncommand in Paris what would be called a sporting price, but the great\r\nmass of leading-article writers receive considerably less in money than\r\na similar class in London, though they exercise a much greater influence\r\non public opinion, and enjoy from the peculiar constitution of French\r\nsociety a higher place in the social scale.\r\n\r\n--We see by the last papers from Paris that Veron and the President have\r\nquarreled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Cincinnati Commercial Advertiser.\r\n\r\nPROPHECY.\r\n\r\nBY ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think thou lovest me--yet a prophet said\r\n      To-day, Elhadra, if thou laidest dead,\r\n    From thy white forehead would he fold the shroud,\r\n      And thereon lay his sorrow, like a crown.\r\n    The drenching rain from out the chilly cloud,\r\n      In the gray ashes beats the red flame down!\r\n    And when the crimson folds the kiss away\r\n      No longer, and blank dulness fills the eyes,\r\n    Lifting its beauty from the crumbling clay,\r\n      Back to the light of earth life's angel flies.\r\n\r\n    So, with my large faith unto gloom allied,\r\n      Sprang up a shadow sunshine could not quell,\r\n    And the voice said, Would'st haste to go outside\r\n      This continent of being, it were well:\r\n    Where finite, growing toward the Infinite,\r\n      Gathers its robe of glory out of dust,\r\n    And looking down the radiances white,\r\n      Sees all God's purposes about us, just.\r\n    Canst thou, Elhadra, reach out of the grave,\r\n      And draw the golden waters of love's well?\r\n    _His_ years are chrisms of brightness in time's wave--\r\n      Thine are as dewdrops in the nightshade's bell!\r\n\r\n    Then straightening in my hands the rippled length\r\n      Of all my tresses, slowly one by one,\r\n    I took the flowers out.--Dear one, in thy strength\r\n      Pray for my weakness. Thou hast seen the sun\r\n    Large in the setting, drive a column of light\r\n      Down through the darkness: so, within death's night,\r\n    O my beloved, when I shall have gone,\r\n    If it might be so, would my love burn on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN HAROUN-AL-RASCHID.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the district of Ferdj' Onah (which signifies _Fine Country_),\r\nAlgeria, lives a Scheik named Bou-Akas-ben-Achour. He is also\r\ndistinguished by the surname of _Bou-Djenoni_ (the Man of the Knife),\r\nand may be regarded as a type of the eastern Arab. His ancestors\r\nconquered Ferdj' Onah, but he has been forced to acknowledge the\r\nsupremacy of France, by paying a yearly tribute of 80,000 francs. His\r\ndominion extends from Milah to Rabouah, and from the southern point of\r\nBabour to within two leagues of Gigelli. He is forty-nine years old, and\r\nwears the Rahyle costume; that is to say, a woollen _gandoura_, confined\r\nby a leathern belt. He carries a pair of pistols in his girdle, by his\r\nside the Rahyle _flissa_, and suspended from his neck a small black\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nBefore him walks a negro carrying his gun, and a huge greyhound bounds\r\nalong by his side. He holds despotic sway over twelve tribes; and should\r\nany neighboring people venture to make an incursion on his territory,\r\nBou-Akas seldom condescends to march against them in person, but sends\r\nhis negro into the principal village. This envoy just displays the gun\r\nof Bou-Akas, and the injury is instantly repaired.\r\n\r\nHe keeps in pay two or three hundred Tolbas to read the Koran to the\r\npeople; every pilgrim going to Mecca, and passing through Ferdj' Onah,\r\nreceives three francs, and may remain as long as he pleases to enjoy the\r\nhospitality of Bou-Akas. But whenever the Scheik discovers that he has\r\nbeen deceived by a pretended pilgrim, he immediately dispatches\r\nemissaries after the impostor; who, wherever he is, find him, throw him\r\ndown, and give him fifty blows on the soles of his feet.\r\n\r\nBou-Akas sometimes entertains three hundred persons at dinner; but\r\ninstead of sharing their repast, he walks round the tables with a baton\r\nin his hand, seeing that the servants attend properly to his guests.\r\nAfterwards, if any thing is left, he eats; but not until the others have\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nWhen the governor of Constantinople, the only man whose power he\r\nrecognizes, sends him a traveller; according to the rank of the latter,\r\nor the nature of the recommendation Bou-Akas gives him his gun, his dog,\r\nor his knife. If the gun, the traveller takes it on his shoulder; if the\r\ndog, he leads it in a leash; or if the knife, he hangs it round his\r\nneck: and with any one of these potent talismans, of which each bears\r\nits own degree of honor, the stranger passes through the region of the\r\ntwelve tribes, not only unscathed, but as the guest of Bou-Akas, treated\r\nwith the utmost hospitality. When the traveller is about to leave Ferdj'\r\nOnah, he consigns the knife, the dog, or the gun to the care of the\r\nfirst Arab he meets. If the Arab is hunting, he leaves the chase; if\r\nlaboring in the field, he leaves his plough; and, taking the precious\r\ndeposit, hastens to restore it to the Bou-Akas.\r\n\r\nThe black-handled knife is so well known, that it has given the surname\r\nof \"Bou-Djenoni, _the man of the knife_,\" to its owner. With this\r\nimplement he is accustomed to cut off heads, whenever he takes a fancy\r\nto perform that agreeable office with his own hand.\r\n\r\nWhen first Bou-Akas assumed the government, the country was infested\r\nwith robbers, but he speedily found means to extirpate them. He\r\ndisguised himself as a poor merchant; walked out, and dropped a _douro_\r\n(a gold coin) on the ground, taking care not to lose sight of it. If the\r\nperson who happened to pick up the _douro_, put it into his pocket and\r\npassed on, Bou-Akas made a sign to his _chinaux_ (who followed him, also\r\nin disguise, and knew the Scheik's will) rushed forward immediately, and\r\ndecapitated the offender. In consequence of this summary method of\r\nadministering justice, it is a saying amongst the Arabs that a child\r\nmight traverse the regions which own Bou-Akas's sway, wearing a golden\r\ncrown on his head, without a single hand being stretched out to take it.\r\n\r\nThe Scheik has great respect for women, and has ordered that when the\r\nfemales of Ferdj' Onah go out to draw water, every man who meets them\r\nshall turn away his head. Wishing one day to ascertain whether his\r\ncommands were attended to, he went out in disguise: and, meeting a\r\nbeautiful Arab maiden on her way to the well, approached and saluted\r\nher. The girl looked at him with amazement, and said: \"Pass on,\r\nstranger; thou knowest not the risk them hast run.\" And when Bou-Akas\r\npersisted in speaking to her, she added: \"Foolish man, and reckless of\r\nthy life; knowest thou not that we are in the country of Bou-Djenoni,\r\nwho causes all women to be held in respect?\"\r\n\r\nBou-Akas is very strict in his religious observances; he never omits his\r\nprayers and ablutions, and has four wives, the number permitted by the\r\nKoran. Having heard that the Cadi of one of his twelve tribes\r\nadministered justice in an admirable manner, and pronounced decisions in\r\na style worthy of King Solomon himself, Bou-Akas, like a second\r\nHaroun-Al-Raschid, determined to judge for himself as to the truth of\r\nthe report. Accordingly, dressed like a private individual, without arms\r\nor attendants, he set out for the Cadi's towns, mounted on a docile\r\nArabian steed. He arrived there, and was just entering the gate, when a\r\ncripple seizing the border of his burnous, asked him for alms in the\r\nname of the prophet. Bou-Akas gave him money, but the cripple still\r\nmaintained his hold. \"What dost thou want?\" asked the Scheik; \"I have\r\nalready given thee alms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the beggar, \"but the law says, not only--'Thou shalt give\r\nalms to thy brother,' but also, 'Thou shalt do for thy brother\r\nwhatsoever thou canst.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! and what can I do for thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou canst save me,--poor crawling creature that I am!--from being\r\ntrodden under the feet of men, horses, mules and camels, which would\r\ncertainly happen to me in passing through the crowded square, in which a\r\nfair is now going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can I save thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"By letting me ride behind you, and putting me down safely in the\r\nmarket-place, where I have business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" replied Bou-Akas. And stooping down, he helped the cripple\r\nto get up behind him; a business which was not accomplished without much\r\ndifficulty. The strangely assorted riders attracted many eyes as they\r\npassed through the crowded streets; and at length they reached the\r\nmarket-place. \"Is this where you wish to stop?\" asked Bou-Akas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then get down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get down yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To leave me the horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"To leave you my horse! What mean you by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that he belongs to me. Know you not that we are now in the town\r\nof the just Cadi, and that if we bring the case before him, he will\r\ncertainly decide in my favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he do so, when the animal belongs to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that when he sees us two,--you with your strong\r\nstraight limbs, which Allah has given you for the purpose of walking,\r\nand I with my weak legs and distorted feet,--he will decree that the\r\nhorse shall belong to him who has most need of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Should, he do so, he would not be the _just_ Cadi,\" said Bou-Akas.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! as to that,\" replied the cripple, laughing, \"although he is just,\r\nhe is not infallible.\"\r\n\r\n\"So!\" thought the Scheik to himself, \"this will be a capital opportunity\r\nof judging the judge.\" He said aloud, \"I am content--we will go before\r\nthe Cadi.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the tribunal, where the judge, according to the eastern\r\ncustom, was publicly administering justice, they found that two trials\r\nwere about to go on, and would of course take precedence of theirs. The\r\nfirst was between a _taleb_ or learned man, and a peasant. The point in\r\ndispute was the _taleb's_ wife, whom the peasant had carried off, and\r\nwhom he asserted to be his own better half, in the face of the\r\nphilosopher who demanded her restoration. The woman, strange\r\ncircumstance! remained obstinately silent, and would not declare for\r\neither; a feature in the case which rendered its decision excessively\r\ndifficult. The judge heard both sides attentively, reflected for a\r\nmoment, and then said, \"Leave the woman here, and return to-morrow.\" The\r\n_savant_ and the laborer each bowed and retired; and the next cause was\r\ncalled. This was a difference between a butcher and an oil-seller. The\r\nlatter appeared covered with oil, and the former was sprinkled with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe butcher spoke first:--\"I went to buy some oil from this man, and in\r\norder to pay him for it, I drew a handful of money from my purse. The\r\nsight of the money tempted him. He seized me by the wrist. I cried out,\r\nbut he would not let me go; and here we are, having come before your\r\nworship, I holding my money in my hand, and he still grasping my wrist.\r\nNow, I swear by the Prophet, that this man is a liar, when he says that\r\nI stole his money, for the money is truly mine own.\"\r\n\r\nThen spoke the oil-merchant:--\"This man came to purchase oil from me.\r\nWhen his bottle was filled, he said, 'Have you change for a piece of\r\ngold?' I searched my pocket, and drew out my hand full of money, which I\r\nlaid on a bench in my shop. He seized it, and was walking off with my\r\nmoney and my oil, when I caught him by the wrist, and cried out\r\n'Robber!' In spite of my cries, however, he would not surrender the\r\nmoney, so I brought him here, that your worship might decide the case.\r\nNow, I swear by the Prophet that this man is a liar, when he says that I\r\nwant to steal his money, for it is truly mine own.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cadi caused each plaintiff to repeat his story, but neither varied\r\none jot from his original statement. He reflected for a moment, and then\r\nsaid, \"Leave the money with me, and return to-morrow.\" The butcher\r\nplaced the coins, which he had never let go, on the edge of the Cadi's\r\nmantle. After which he and his opponent bowed to the tribunal, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of Bou-Akas and the cripple. \"My lord Cadi,\" said\r\nthe former, \"I came hither from a distant country, with the intention of\r\npurchasing merchandise. At the city gate I met this cripple, who first\r\nasked for alms, and then prayed me to allow him to ride behind me\r\nthrough the streets, lest he should be trodden down in the crowd. I\r\nconsented, but when we reached the market-place, he refused to get down,\r\nasserting that my horse belonged to him, and that your worship would\r\nsurely adjudge it to him, who wanted it most. That, my lord Cadi, is\r\nprecisely the state of the case--I swear it by Mahomet!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said the cripple, \"as I was coming on business to the market,\r\nand riding this horse, which belongs to me, I saw this man seated by the\r\nroadside, apparently half dead from fatigue. I good naturedly offered to\r\ntake him on the crupper, and let him ride as far as the market-place,\r\nand he eagerly thanked me. But what was my astonishment, when, on our\r\narrival, he refused to get down, and said that my horse was his. I\r\nimmediately required him to appear before your worship, in order that\r\nyou might decide between us. That is the true state of the case--I swear\r\nit by Mahomet!\"\r\n\r\nHaving made each repeat his deposition, and having reflected for a\r\nmoment, the Cadi said, \"Leave the horse here, and return to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt was done, and Bou-Akas and the cripple withdrew in different\r\ndirections. On the morrow, a number of persons besides those immediately\r\ninterested in the trials assembled to hear the judge's decisions. The\r\n_taleb_ and the peasant were called first.\r\n\r\n\"Take away thy wife,\" said the Cadi to the former, \"and keep her, I\r\nadvise thee, in good order.\" Then turning towards his _chinaux_, he\r\nadded, pointing to the peasant, \"Give this man fifty blows.\" He was\r\ninstantly obeyed, and the _taleb_ carried off his wife.\r\n\r\nThen came forward the oil-merchant and the butcher. \"Here,\" said the\r\nCadi to the butcher, \"is thy money; it is truly thine, and not his.\"\r\nThen pointing to the oil-merchant, he said to his _chinaux_, \"Give this\r\nman fifty blows.\" It was done, and the butcher went away in triumph with\r\nhis money.\r\n\r\nThe third cause was called, and Bou-Akas and the cripple came forward.\r\n\"Would'st thou recognize thy horse amongst twenty others?\" said the\r\njudge to Bou-Akas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my lord,\" replied the cripple.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" said the Cadi to Bou-Akas.\r\n\r\nThey entered a large stable, and Bou-Akas pointed out his horse amongst\r\ntwenty which were standing side by side.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well,\" said the judge. \"Return now to the tribunal, and send me\r\nthine adversary hither.\"\r\n\r\nThe disguised Scheik obeyed, delivered his message, and the cripple\r\nhastened to the stable, as quickly as his distorted limbs allowed. He\r\npossessed quick eyes and a good memory, so that he was able, without the\r\nslightest hesitation, to place his hand on the right animal.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well,\" said the Cadi; \"return to the tribunal.\"\r\n\r\nHis worship resumed his place, and when the cripple arrived, judgment\r\nwas pronounced. \"The horse is thine,\" said the Cadi to Bou-Akas. \"Go to\r\nthe stable, and take him.\" Then to the _chinaux_, \"Give this cripple\r\nfifty blows.\" It was done; and Bou-Akas went to take his horse.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cadi, after concluding the business of the day, was retiring\r\nto his house, he found Bou-Akas waiting for him. \"Art thou discontented\r\nwith my award?\" asked the judge.\r\n\r\n\"No, quite the contrary,\" replied the Scheik. \"But I want to ask by what\r\ninspiration thou hast rendered justice; for I doubt not that the other\r\ntwo cases were decided as equitably as mine. I am not a merchant; I am\r\nBou-Akas, Scheik of Ferdj' Onah, and I wanted to judge for myself of thy\r\nreputed wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cadi bowed to the ground, and kissed his master's hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious,\" said Bou-Akas, \"to know the reasons which determined\r\nyour three decisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, my lord, can be more simple. Your highness saw that I detained\r\nfor a night the three things in dispute?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, early in the morning I caused the woman to be called, and I said\r\nto her suddenly--'Put fresh ink in my inkstand.' Like a person who had\r\ndone the same thing a hundred times before, she took the bottle, removed\r\nthe cotton, washed them both, put in the cotton again, and poured in\r\nfresh ink, doing it all with the utmost neatness and dexterity. So I\r\nsaid to myself, 'A peasant's wife would known nothing about\r\ninkstands--she must belong to the _taleb_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Bou-Akas, nodding his head. \"And the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did your highness remark that the merchant had his clothes and hands\r\ncovered with oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; I took the money, and placed it in a vessel filled with water.\r\nThis morning I looked at it, and not a particle of oil was to be seen on\r\nthe surface of the water. So I said to myself, 'If this money belonged\r\nto the oil-merchant it would be greasy from the touch of his hands; as\r\nit is not so, the butcher's story must be true.'\"\r\n\r\nBou-Akas nodded in token of approval.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said he. \"And my horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that was a different business; and, until this morning, I was\r\ngreatly puzzled.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cripple, I suppose, did not recognize the animal?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, he pointed him out immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then did you discover that he was not the owner?\"\r\n\r\n\"My object in bringing you separately to the stable, was not to see\r\nwhether you would know the horse, but whether the horse would\r\nacknowledge you. Now, when you approached him, the creature turned\r\ntowards you, laid back his ears, and neighed with delight; but when the\r\ncripple touched him, he kicked. Then I knew that you were truly his\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\nBou-Akas thought for a moment, and then said: \"Allah has given thee\r\ngreat wisdom. Thou oughtest to be in my place, and I in thine. And yet,\r\nI know not; thou art certainly worthy to be Scheik, but I fear that I\r\nshould but badly fill thy place as Cadi!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Manchester Examiner.\r\n\r\nLOVE.--A SONNET.\r\n\r\nBY J. C. PRINCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Love is an odor from the heavenly bowers,\r\n      Which stirs our senses tenderly, and brings\r\n      Dreams which are shadows of diviner things\r\n    Beyond this grosser atmosphere of ours.\r\n    An oasis of verdure and of flowers,\r\n      Love smiteth on the Pilgrim's weary way;\r\n      There fresher air, there sweeter waters play,\r\n    There purer solace charms the quiet hours.\r\n    This glorious passion, unalloyed, endowers\r\n      With moral beauty all who feel its fire;\r\n      Maid, wife, and offspring, brother, mother, sire,\r\n    Are names and symbols of its hallowed powers.\r\n      Love is immortal. From our head may fly\r\n      Earth's other blessings; Love can never die!\r\n\r\n    _Ashton, 5th March._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Spectator.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF SORCERY AND MAGIC.[I]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rationale of magic, when a combination of skill and fraud imposed\r\nupon the vulgar, is easily settled. The priests of the ancient\r\nmythology, the adepts of the middle ages, turned their knowledge of\r\nchemistry and mechanics and their proficiency in legerdemain to account;\r\nand before we denounce the latter as impostors, we should bear in mind\r\nthe ignorance of the times in which they lived. People would not have\r\nbelieved any natural explanation, though they might have felt inclined\r\nto persecute the man when stripped of his magical character: we should\r\nalso consider how far the general belief might influence even the man\r\nhimself; how far he could in his inmost mind draw the distinction\r\nbetween what we call natural philosophy and what the age considered\r\nmagic--a lawful if a riskful power over nature and spirits, by means of\r\noccult knowledge. An allowance is further to be made for the stories as\r\nthey have come down to us; a distinction is to be drawn between the\r\nactual facts and the fancy of the narrator, between the reality and the\r\nromance of magic.\r\n\r\nSorcery and witchcraft (to which, notwithstanding its title, Mr.\r\nWright's book chiefly relates) was a more vulgar pursuit, and is a more\r\ndifficult matter to determine. The true magician was a master over both\r\nthe seen and the unseen world. His art could _compel_ spirits or demons\r\nto obey him, however much against their will. It seems a question\r\nwhether a spell of sufficient potency could not control Satan himself.\r\nThe witch or wizard was a vulgar being, a mere slave of the Evil One,\r\nwith no original power, very limited in derived power, and, it would\r\nappear, with no means of acting directly except upon the elements. The\r\nfacts relating to witchcraft, being often matter of legal record, are\r\nmore numerous and more correctly narrated than those relating to magic.\r\nThe difficulty of fixing the exact boundary between truth and falsehood,\r\nguilt and innocence, in the case of witchcraft, is not so easily settled\r\nas the sciolist in liberal philosophy imagines. Of course we all know\r\nthat men and women could not travel through the air on broomsticks, or\r\ncause storms, or afflict cattle. Their innocence of the intention is\r\nnot always so certain: their power over a nervous or weakly person,\r\nespecially in bad health, might really, through the influence of\r\nimagination, produce the death threatened, and the miserable patient\r\nmight pine away as his real or supposed waxen image slowly melted before\r\nthe fire. At a time when the belief in witchcraft was entertained by\r\nsociety in general, as well as by the majority of educated men, it is\r\nnot likely that the persons who were generally accused of it were\r\nskeptical on the subject. Their innocence would lie, not in their\r\ndisbelief of its power, but in their rejection of the practice. That an\r\naccusation of witchcraft was sometimes made from political, religious,\r\nor personal motives, is true; and numbers of innocent victims were\r\nsacrificed in times of public mania on the subject. The question is,\r\nwhether many did not attempt unlawful arts in full belief of their\r\nefficacy; and whether some, a compound of the self-dupe and the\r\nimpostor, did not make use of their reputed power to indulge in the\r\ngrossest license and to perpetrate abominable crimes.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty, however, is the confessions. In many cases, no\r\ndoubt, the victims, worn down by terror and torture, said whatever their\r\nexaminers seemed to wish them to say; in other cases, their statements\r\nwere exaggerated by the reporters. Yet enough remains, after every\r\ndeduction, to render witches' confessions a very curious mental problem.\r\nWas it vision, or monomania, or nervous delusion, all influenced by\r\nforegone conclusion? or was it, as the mesmerists seem to hold, an\r\ninstance of clairvoyance in a high degree? The case of Gaufridi is of\r\nthis puzzling nature. Gaufridi was a French priest of licentious\r\ncharacter, who succeeded by the opportunities which his priestly\r\ninfluence gave him, or by some pretended supernatural arts. His crimes\r\nwere discovered through the confession of one of his victims, a nun whom\r\nhe had abused before profession. After a time, she appeared to be\r\npossessed; and, under treatment by a celebrated exorcist, (an inferior\r\nhand having failed,) she, or the demon in possession, among other things\r\naccused Gaufridi. _Her_ revelations may be resolved into an imposture\r\ninstigated by revenge, or a pious fraud caused by remorse, or hysterical\r\nfits, with utterance shaped by memory; but what can be said of\r\nGaufridi's, made with a full knowledge of consequences?\r\n\r\n     \"The priests who conducted this affair seem almost to have lost\r\n     sight of Louis Gaufridi, in their anxiety to collect these\r\n     important evidences of the true faith. It was not till towards\r\n     the close of winter that the reputed wizard was again thought\r\n     of. A warrant was then obtained against him, and he was taken\r\n     into custody, and confined in the prison of the conciergerie at\r\n     Marseilles. On the fifth of March he was for the first time\r\n     confronted with sister Magdalen, but without producing the\r\n     result anticipated by his persecutors. Little information is\r\n     given as to the subsequent proceedings against him; but he\r\n     appears to have been treated with great severity, and to have\r\n     persevered in asserting his innocence. Sister Magdalen, or\r\n     rather the demon within her, gave information of certain marks\r\n     on his body which had been placed there by the Evil One; and on\r\n     search they were found exactly as described. It is not to be\r\n     wondered at, if, after the intercourse which had existed\r\n     between them, sister Magdalen were able to give such\r\n     information. Still Gaufridi continued unshaken, and he made no\r\n     confession; until at length, on Easter Eve, the twenty-sixth of\r\n     March, 1611, a full avowal of his guilt was drawn from him, we\r\n     are not told through what means, by two Capuchins of the\r\n     Convent of Aix, to which place he had been transferred for his\r\n     trial. At the beginning of April, another witness, the\r\n     Demoiselle Victoire de Courbier, came forward to depose that\r\n     she had been bewitched by the renegade priest, who had obtained\r\n     her love by his charms; and he made no objection to their\r\n     adding this new incident to his confession.\r\n\r\n     \"Gaufridi acknowledged the truth of all that had been said by\r\n     sister Magdalen or by her demon. He said that an uncle, who had\r\n     died many years ago, had left him his books, and that one day,\r\n     about five or six years before his arrest on this accusation,\r\n     he was looking them over, when he found amongst them a volume\r\n     of magic, in which were some writings in French verse,\r\n     accompanied with strange characters. His curiosity was excited,\r\n     and he began to read it; when, to his great astonishment and\r\n     consternation, the demon appeared in a human form, and said to\r\n     him, 'What do you desire of me, for it is you who have called\r\n     me?' Gaufridi was young, and easily tempted; and when he had\r\n     recovered from his surprise and was reassured by the manner and\r\n     conversation of his visitor, he replied to his offer, 'If you\r\n     have power to give me what I desire, I ask for two things:\r\n     first, that I shall prevail with all the women I like;\r\n     secondly, that I shall be esteemed and honored above all the\r\n     priests of this country, and enjoy the respect of men of wealth\r\n     and honor.' We may see, perhaps, through these wishes, the\r\n     reason why Gaufridi was persecuted by the rest of the clergy.\r\n     The demon promised to grant him his desires, on condition that\r\n     he would give up to him entirely his 'body, soul, and works;'\r\n     to which Gaufridi agreed, excepting only from the latter the\r\n     administration of the holy sacrament, to which he was bound by\r\n     his vocation as a priest of the church.\r\n\r\n     \"From this time Louis Gaufridi felt an extreme pleasure in\r\n     reading the magical book, and it always had the effect of\r\n     bringing the demon to attend upon him. At the end of two or\r\n     three days the agreement was arranged and completed, and, it\r\n     having been fairly written on parchment, the priest signed it\r\n     with his blood. The tempter then told him, that whenever he\r\n     breathed on maid or woman, provided his breath reached their\r\n     nostrils, they would immediately become desperately in love\r\n     with him. He soon made a trial of the demon's gift, and used it\r\n     so copiously that, he became in a short time a general object\r\n     of attraction to the women of the district. He said that he\r\n     often amused himself with exciting their passions when he had\r\n     no intention of requiting them, and he declared that he had\r\n     already made more than a thousand victims.\r\n\r\n     \"At length he took an extraordinary fancy to the young Magdalen\r\n     de la Palude; but he found her difficult of approach, on\r\n     account of the watchfulness of her mother, and he only overcame\r\n     the difficulty by breathing on the mother before he seduced the\r\n     daughter. He thus gained his purpose; took the girl to the cave\r\n     in the manner she had already described, and became so much\r\n     attached to her that he often repeated his charm on her, to\r\n     make her more devoted in her love. Three days after their first\r\n     visit to the cave, he gave her a familiar named Esmodes.\r\n     Finding her now perfectly devoted to his will, he determined to\r\n     marry her to Beelzebub, the prince of the demons; and she\r\n     readily agreed to his proposal. He immediately called the demon\r\n     prince, who appeared in the form of a handsome gentleman; and\r\n     she then renounced her baptism and Christianity, signed the\r\n     agreement with her blood, and received the demon's mark....\r\n\r\n     \"The priest gave an account of the Sabbaths, at which he was a\r\n     regular attendant. When he was ready to go--it was usually at\r\n     night--he either went to the open window of his chamber, or\r\n     left the chamber, locking the door, and proceeded into the open\r\n     air. There Lucifer made his appearance, and took him in an\r\n     instant to their place of meeting, where the orgies of the\r\n     witches and sorcerers lasted usually from three to four hours.\r\n     Gaufridi divided the victims of the Evil One into three\r\n     classes: the masqués, (perhaps the novices,) the sorcerers, and\r\n     the magicians. On arriving at the meeting, they all worshipped\r\n     the demon according to their several ranks; the masqués falling\r\n     flat on their faces, the sorcerers kneeling with their heads\r\n     and bodies humbly bowed down, and the magicians, who stood\r\n     highest in importance, only kneeling. After this they all went\r\n     through the formality of denying God and the Saints. Then they\r\n     had a diabolical service in burlesque of that of the church, at\r\n     which the Evil One served as priest in a violet chasuble; the\r\n     elevation of the demon host was announced by a wooden bell, and\r\n     the sacrament itself was made of unleavened bread. The scenes\r\n     which followed resembled those of other witch-meetings.\r\n     Gaufridi acknowledged that he took Magdalen thither, and that\r\n     he made her swallow magical 'characters' that were to increase\r\n     her love to him; yet he proved unfaithful to her at these\r\n     Sabbaths with a multitude of persons, and among the rest with\r\n     'a princess of Friesland.' The unhappy sorcerer confessed,\r\n     among other things, that his demon was his constant companion,\r\n     though generally invisible to all but himself; and that he only\r\n     left him when he entered the church of the Capuchins to perform\r\n     his religious duties, and then he waited for him outside the\r\n     church door.\r\n\r\n     \"Gaufridi was tried before the Court of Parliament of Provence\r\n     at Aix. His confession, the declaration of the demons, the\r\n     marks on his body, and other circumstances, left him no hope of\r\n     mercy. Judgment was given against him on the last day of April,\r\n     and the same day it was put in execution. He was burnt alive.\"\r\n\r\n_Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_ is a skilful and popular selection of\r\nstories or narratives relating to the subject, not a philosophic\r\ntreatise. We are carried to France, Germany, England, Ireland, Scotland,\r\nSpain, and America, by turns. We have the most remarkable trials for\r\nwitchcraft in these countries, as well as cases in which supernatural\r\nagency was only an incidental part,--as that of the Earl and Countess of\r\nSomerset, for the murder of Overbury.\r\n\r\nBy way of showing that Mr. Wright is by no means an indifferent\r\nstory-teller, we may refer to the following legend:\r\n\r\n     \"The demons whom the sorcerer served seem rarely to have given\r\n     any assistance to their victims when the latter fell into the\r\n     hands of the judicial authorities; but if they escaped\r\n     punishment by the agency of the law, they were only reserved\r\n     for a more terrible end. We have already seen the fate of the\r\n     woman of Berkeley. A writer of the thirteenth century has\r\n     preserved a story of a man who, by his compact with the Evil\r\n     One, had collected together great riches. One day, while he was\r\n     absent in the fields, a stranger of suspicious appearance came\r\n     to his house and asked for him. His wife replied that he was\r\n     not at home. The stranger said, 'Tell him when he returns, that\r\n     to-night he must pay me my debt.' The wife replied that she was\r\n     not aware that he owed any thing to him. 'Tell, him,' said the\r\n     stranger, with a ferocious look, 'that I will have my debt\r\n     to-night.' The husband returned, and when informed of what had\r\n     taken place, merely remarked that the demand was just. He then\r\n     ordered his bed to be made that night in an outhouse, where he\r\n     had never slept before, and he shut himself in it with a\r\n     lighted candle. The family were astonished, and could not\r\n     resist the impulse to gratify their curiosity by looking\r\n     through the holes in the door. They beheld the same stranger,\r\n     who had entered without opening the door, seated beside his\r\n     victim, and they appeared to be counting large sums of money.\r\n     Soon they began to quarrel about their accounts, and were\r\n     proceeding from threats to blows, when the servants, who were\r\n     looking through the door, burst it open, that they might help\r\n     their master. The light was instantly extinguished; and when\r\n     another was brought, no traces could be found of either of the\r\n     disputants, nor were they ever afterwards heard of. The\r\n     suspicious-looking stranger was the demon himself, who had\r\n     carried away his victim.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] Narratives of Sorcery and Magic, from the most Authentic Sources. By\r\nThomas Wright, Esq., M.A., F.S.A., &c., &c. In two volumes. Published by\r\nBentley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Examiner.\r\n\r\nHARTLEY COLERIDGE AND HIS GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHartley Coleridge was a poet whose life was so deplorable a\r\ncontradiction to the strength and subtlety of his genius, and the\r\ncapability and range of his intellect, that perhaps no such sad example\r\nhas ever found similar record.[J] Indeed we are obliged with sincere\r\ngrief to doubt, whether, as written here, the memoir should have been\r\nwritten at all. With much respect for Mr. Derwent Coleridge, who is\r\nhimself no unworthy inheritor of a great name, his white neckcloth is\r\nsomewhat too prominently seen in the matter. There are too many labored\r\nexplainings, starched apologies, and painful accountings for this and\r\nthat. The writer was probably not conscious of the effort he was making,\r\nyet the effort is but too manifest, A simple statement of facts, a\r\nkindly allowance for circumstances, a mindful recollection of what his\r\nfather was in physical as well as mental organization, extracts from\r\nHartley's own letters, recollections of those among whom his latter life\r\nwas passed--this, as it seems to us, should have sufficed. Mr. Derwent\r\nColeridge brings too many church-bred and town-bred notions to the grave\r\ndesign of moralizing and philosophizing his brother's simple life and\r\nwayward self-indulgences. His motives will be respected, and his real\r\nkindness not misunderstood; but it will be felt that a quiet and\r\nunaffected little memoir of that strange and sorry career, and of those\r\nnoble nor wholly wasted powers, remains still to be written.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we gratefully accept the volumes before us, which in their\r\ncontents are quite as decisive of Hartley Coleridge's genius as of what\r\nit might have achieved in happier circumstances. A more beautiful or\r\nmore sorrowful book has not been published in our day.\r\n\r\n    \"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,\r\n    And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,\r\n    That sometime grew within this learned man.\"\r\n\r\nHartley Coleridge was the eldest son of the poet, and with much of his\r\nfather's genius (which in him, however, took a more simple and practical\r\nshape than consisted with the wider and more mystical expanse of his\r\nfather's mind), inherited also the defects of his organization and\r\ntemperament. What would have become of the elder Coleridge but for the\r\nfriends in whose home his later years found a refuge, no one can say.\r\nWith no such friends or home, poor Hartley became a cast-away. After a\r\nchildhood of singular genius, manifested in many modes and forms, and\r\ndescribed with charming effect by his brother in the best passages and\r\nanecdotes of the memoir, he was launched without due discipline or\r\npreparation into the University of Oxford, where the catastrophe of his\r\nlife befell. He had first fairly shown his powers when the hard doom\r\nwent forth which condemned them to waste and idleness. He obtained a\r\nfellowship-elect at Oriel, was dismissed on the ground of intemperance\r\nbefore his probationary year had passed, and wandered for the rest of\r\nhis days by the scenes with which his father most wished to surround his\r\nchildhood--\r\n\r\n    (\"But thou, my babe, shall wander like a breeze\r\n    By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags\r\n    Of ancient mountains, and beneath the clouds\r\n    Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores\r\n    And mountain crags\")\r\n\r\n--listening with hardly less than his father's delight to the sounds and\r\nvoices of nature, in homely intimacy with all homely folk, uttering now\r\nand then piercing words of wisdom or regret, teaching little children in\r\nvillage schools, and----.\r\n\r\nWell, it would be perhaps too much to say that he continued to justify\r\nthe rejection of the Oriel fellows. Who knows how largely that event may\r\nitself have contributed to what it too hastily anticipated and too\r\nfinally condemned? It appears certain that the weakness had not thus\r\nearly made itself known to Hartley's general acquaintance at the\r\nUniversity. Mr. Dyce had nothing painful to remember of him, but\r\ndescribes him as a young man possessing an intellect of the highest\r\norder, with great simplicity of character and considerable oddity of\r\nmanner; and he hints that the college authorities had probably resented,\r\nin the step they took, certain attacks more declamatory than serious\r\nwhich Hartley had got into the habit of indulging against all\r\nestablished institutions. Mr. Derwent Coleridge touches this part of the\r\nsubject very daintily. \"My brother was, however, _I am afraid_, more\r\nsincere in his invectives against establishments, as they appeared to\r\nhis eyes at Oxford, and elsewhere, _than Mr. Dyce kindly supposes_.\" How\r\npoor Hartley would have laughed at that!\r\n\r\nOne thing to the last he continued. The simplicity of character which\r\nMr. Dyce attributes to his youth remained with him till long after his\r\nhair was prematurely white. As Wordsworth hoped for him in his\r\nchildhood, he kept\r\n\r\n    \"A young lamb's heart among the full-grown flock;\"\r\n\r\n--and some delightful recollections of his ordinary existence from day\r\nto day among the lakes and mountains, and in the service of the village\r\nschools, are contributed to his brother's Memoir. Here is one, from one\r\nof the scholars he taught:\r\n\r\n     \"I first saw Hartley in the beginning, I think, of 1837, when I\r\n     was at Sedbergh, and he heard us our lesson in Mr. Green's\r\n     parlor. My impression of him was what I conceived Shakespeare's\r\n     idea of a gentleman to be, something which we like to have in a\r\n     picture. He was dressed in black, his hair, just touched with\r\n     gray, fell in thick waves down his back, and he had a frilled\r\n     shirt on; and there was a sort of autumnal ripeness and\r\n     brightness about him. His shrill voice, and his quick,\r\n     authoritative 'right! right!' and the chuckle with which he\r\n     translated 'rerum repetundarum' as 'peculation, a very common\r\n     vice in governors of all ages,' after which he took a turn\r\n     round the sofa--all struck me amazingly; his readiness\r\n     astonished us all, and even himself, as he afterwards told me;\r\n     for, during the time he was at the school, he never had to use\r\n     a dictionary once, though we read Dalzell's selections from\r\n     Aristotle and Longinus, and several plays of Sophocles. He took\r\n     his idea, so he said, from what De Quincy says of one of the\r\n     Eton masters fagging the lesson, to the great amusement of the\r\n     class, and, while waiting for the lesson, he used to read a\r\n     newspaper. While acting as second master he seldom occupied the\r\n     master's desk, but sat among the boys on one of the school\r\n     benches. He very seldom came to school in a morning, never till\r\n     about eleven, and in the afternoon about an hour after we had\r\n     begun. I never knew the least liberty taken with him, though he\r\n     was kinder and more familiar than was then the fashion with\r\n     masters. His translations were remarkably vivid; of [Greek:\r\n     mogera mogerôs] 'toiling and moiling;' and of some ship or\r\n     other in the Philoctetes, which he pronounced to be 'scudding\r\n     under main-top sails,' our conceptions became intelligible.\r\n     Many of his translations were written down with his initials,\r\n     and I saw some, not a long while ago, in the Sophocles of a\r\n     late Tutor at Queen's College, Oxford, who had them from\r\n     tradition. He gave most attention to our themes; out of those\r\n     sent in he selected two or three, which he then read aloud and\r\n     criticised; and once, when they happened to agree, remarked\r\n     there was always a coincidence of thought amongst great men.\r\n     Out of school he never mixed with the boys, but was sometimes\r\n     seen, to their astonishment, running along the fields with his\r\n     arms outstretched, and talking to himself. He had no pet\r\n     scholars except one, a little fair-haired boy, who he said\r\n     ought to have been a girl. He told me that was the only boy he\r\n     ever loved, though he always loved little girls. He was\r\n     remarkably fond of the travelling shows that occasionally\r\n     visited the village. I have seen him clap his hands with\r\n     delight; indeed, in most of the simple delights of country\r\n     life, he was like a child. This is what occurs to me at present\r\n     of what he was when I first knew him; and, indeed, my after\r\n     recollections are of a similarly fragmentary kind, consisting\r\n     only of those little, numerous, noiseless, every-day acts of\r\n     kindness, the sum of which makes a Christian life. His love of\r\n     little children, his sympathy with the poor and suffering, his\r\n     hatred of oppression, the beauty and the grace of his\r\n     politeness before women, and his high manliness,--these are the\r\n     features which I shall never forget while I have any thing to\r\n     remember.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer afterwards tells us:\r\n\r\n     \"On his way to one of these parties he called on me, and I\r\n     could not help saying, 'How well you look in a white\r\n     neckcloth!' 'I wish you could see me sometimes,' he replied;\r\n     'if I had only black-silk stockings and shoe-buckles I should\r\n     be quite a gentleman.' Those who had only seen him in the\r\n     careless dress that he chose to adopt in the lanes--his\r\n     trowsers, which were generally too long, doubled half way up\r\n     the leg, unbrushed, and often splashed; his hat brushed the\r\n     wrong way, for he never used an umbrella; and his wild,\r\n     unshaven, weather-beaten look--were amazed at his metamorphose\r\n     into such a faultless gentleman as he appeared when he was\r\n     dressed for the evening. 'I hate silver forks with fish,' he\r\n     said; 'I can't manage them.' So did Dr. Arnold, I told him.\r\n     'That's capital; I am glad of such an authority. Do you know I\r\n     never understood the gladiator's excellence till the other day.\r\n     The way in which my brother eats fish with a silver fork made\r\n     the thing quite clear.'\r\n\r\n     \"He often referred to his boyish days, when he told me he\r\n     nearly poisoned half the house with his chemical infusions, and\r\n     spoiled the pans, with great delight. The 'Pilgrim's Progress'\r\n     was an early favorite with him. 'It was strange,' he said, 'how\r\n     it had been overlooked. Children are often misunderstood. When\r\n     I was a baby I have often been in the greatest terror, when, to\r\n     all appearance, I was quite still;--so frightened that I could\r\n     not make a noise. Crying, I believe, is oftener a sign of\r\n     happiness than the reverse. I was looked upon as a remarkable\r\n     child. My mother told me, when I was born she thought me an\r\n     ugly red thing; but my father took me up and said, 'There's no\r\n     sweeter baby any where than this.' He always thought too much\r\n     of me. I was very dull at school, and hated arithmetic; I\r\n     always had to count on my fingers.\r\n\r\n     \"He once took me to the little cottage where he lived by the\r\n     Brathey, when Charles Lloyd and he were school-companions. Mrs.\r\n     Nicholson, of Ambleside, told me of a donkey-race which they\r\n     had from the market-cross to the end of the village and back,\r\n     and how Hartley came in last, and minus his white straw hat.\"\r\n\r\nThose who remember the ordinary (and most extraordinary) dress that hung\r\nabout his small eager person, will smile at this entry in his journal of\r\na visit to Rydal chapel, and the reflections awakened therein:\r\n\r\n     \"17th.--Sunday.--At Rydal chapel. Alas! I have been _Parcus\r\n     Deorum cultor et infrequens_ of late. Would I could say with\r\n     assurance, _Nunc interare cursus cogor relictos_. I never saw\r\n     Axiologus (Wordsworth) look so venerable. His cape cloak has\r\n     such a gravity about it. Old gentlemen should never wear light\r\n     great coats unless they be military; and even then Uncle Toby's\r\n     Roquelaure would be more becoming than all the frogs in Styx.\r\n     On the other hand, loose trowsers should never invest the\r\n     nether limbs of led. It looks as if the Septuagenarian were\r\n     ashamed of a diminished calf. The sable silk is good and\r\n     clerical, so are the gray pearl and the partridge. I revere\r\n     gray worsted and ridge and furrow for [Greek: Omak rites] his\r\n     sake, but perhaps the bright white lamb's wool doth most set\r\n     off the leg of an elderly man. The hose should be drawn over\r\n     the knees, unless the rank and fortune require diamond buckles.\r\n     Paste or Bristol stones should never approach a gentleman of\r\n     any age. Roomy shoes, not of varnished leather. Broad\r\n     shoe-buckles, well polished. Cleanliness is an ornament to\r\n     youth, but an indispensable necessity to old age. Breeches,\r\n     velvet or velveteen, or some other solid stuff. There may be\r\n     serious objections to reviving the trunk breeches of our\r\n     ancestors. I am afraid that hoops would follow in their train.\r\n     But the flapped waistcoat, the deep cuffs, and guarded\r\n     pocket-holes, the low collar, I should hail with pleasure; that\r\n     is, for grandfathers and men of grandfatherly years. I was\r\n     about to add the point-lace ruffles, cravat, and frill, but I\r\n     pause in consideration of the miseries and degraded state of\r\n     the lace makers.\"\r\n\r\nOccasional passages in his letters are very beautiful, and very sad.\r\nHere is one--adverting to some attack made upon him:\r\n\r\n     \"'This jargon,' said my orthodox reviewer, 'might be excused in\r\n     an alderman of London, but not in a Fellow elect of Oriel,' or\r\n     something to the same purpose, evidently designing to recall to\r\n     memory the most painful passage of a life not over happy. But\r\n     perhaps it is as well to let it alone. The writer might be some\r\n     one in whom my kindred are interested; for I am as much alone\r\n     in my revolt as Abdiel in his constancy.\"\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see valuable testimony borne by Mr. James Spedding as to\r\nhis habits having left unimpaired his moral and spiritual sensibility:\r\n\r\n     \"Of his general character and way of life I might have been\r\n     able to say something to the purpose, if I had seen more of\r\n     him. But though he was a person so interesting to me in\r\n     himself, and with so many subjects of interest in common with\r\n     me, that a little intercourse went a great way; so that I feel\r\n     as if I knew him much better than many persons of whom I have\r\n     seen much more; yet I have in fact been very seldom in his\r\n     company. If I should say ten times altogether, I should not be\r\n     understating the number; and this is not enough to qualify me\r\n     for a reporter, when there must be so many competent observers\r\n     living, who really knew him well. One very strong impression,\r\n     however, with which I always came away from him, may be worth\r\n     mentioning; I mean, that his moral and spiritual sensibilities\r\n     seemed to be absolutely untouched by the life he was leading.\r\n     The error of his life sprung, I suppose, from moral incapacity\r\n     of some kind--his way of life seemed in some things destructive\r\n     of self-respect; and was certainly regarded by himself with a\r\n     feeling of shame, which in his seasons of self-communion became\r\n     passionate; and yet it did not at all degrade his mind. It\r\n     left, not his understanding only, but also his imagination and\r\n     feelings, perfectly healthy,--free, fresh, and pure. His\r\n     language might be sometimes what some people would call gross,\r\n     but that I think was not from any want of true delicacy, but\r\n     from a masculine disdain of false delicacy; and his opinions,\r\n     and judgment, and speculations, were in the highest degree\r\n     refined and elevated--full of chivalrous generosity, and\r\n     purity, and manly tenderness. Such, at least, was my invariable\r\n     impression. It always surprised me, but fresh observations\r\n     always confirmed it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Wordsworth heard of his death, he was much affected, and gave the\r\ntouching direction to his brother:--\"Let him lie by us: he would have\r\nwished it.\" It was accordingly so arranged.\r\n\r\n     \"The day following he walked over with me to Grasmere--to the\r\n     churchyard, a plain enclosure of the olden time, surrounding\r\n     the old village church, in which lay the remains of his wife's\r\n     sister, his nephew, and his beloved daughter. Here, having\r\n     desired the sexton to measure out the ground for his own and\r\n     for Mrs. Wordsworth's grave, he bade him measure out the space\r\n     of a third grave for my brother, immediately beyond.\r\n\r\n     \"'When I lifted up my eyes from my daughter's grave,' he\r\n     exclaimed, 'he was standing there!' pointing to the spot where\r\n     my brother had stood on the sorrowful occasion to which he\r\n     alluded. Then turning to the sexton, he said, 'Keep the ground\r\n     for us,--we are old people, and it cannot be for long.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"In the grave thus marked out, my brother's remains were laid\r\n     on the following Thursday, and in little more than a\r\n     twelvemonth his venerable and venerated friend was brought to\r\n     occupy his own. They lie in the south-east angle of the\r\n     churchyard, not far from a group of trees, with the little\r\n     beck, that feeds the lake with its clear waters, murmuring by\r\n     their side. Around them are the quiet mountains.\"\r\n\r\nWe have often expressed a high opinion of Hartley Coleridge's poetical\r\ngenius. It was a part of the sadness of his life that he could not\r\nconcentrate his powers, in this or any other department of his\r\nintellect, to high and continuous aims--but we were not prepared for\r\nsuch rich proof of its exercise, within the limited field assigned to\r\nit, as these volumes offer. They largely and lastingly contribute to the\r\nrare stores of true poetry. In the sonnet Hartley Coleridge was a master\r\nunsurpassed by the greatest. To its \"narrow plot of ground\" his habits,\r\nwhen applied in the cultivation of the muse, most naturally led him--and\r\nhere he may claim no undeserved companionship even with Shakespeare,\r\nMilton, and Wordsworth. We take a few--with affecting personal reference\r\nin all of them.\r\n\r\n    Hast thou not seen an aged rifted tower,\r\n    Meet habitation for the Ghost of Time,\r\n    Where fearful ravage makes decay sublime,\r\n    And destitution wears the face of power?\r\n    Yet is the fabric deck'd with many a flower\r\n    Of fragrance wild, and many-dappled hues,\r\n    Gold streak'd with iron-brown and nodding blue,\r\n    Making each ruinous chink a fairy bower.\r\n    E'en such a thing methinks I fain would be,\r\n    Should Heaven appoint me to a lengthen'd age;\r\n    So old in look, that Young and Old may see\r\n    The record of my closing pilgrimage:\r\n    Yet, to the last, a rugged wrinkled thing\r\n    To which young sweetness may delight to cling!\r\n\r\n    Pains I have known, that cannot be again,\r\n    And pleasures too that never can be more:\r\n    For loss of pleasure I was never sore,\r\n    But worse, far worse is to feel no pain.\r\n    The throes and agonies of a heart explain\r\n    Its very depth of want at inmost core;\r\n    Prove that it does believe, and would adore,\r\n    And doth with ill for ever strive and strain.\r\n    I not lament for happy childish years,\r\n    For loves departed, that have had their day,\r\n    Or hopes that faded when my head was gray;\r\n    For death hath left me last of my compeers:\r\n    But for the pain I felt, the gushing tears\r\n    I used to shed when I had gone astray.\r\n\r\n    A lonely wanderer upon the earth am I,\r\n    The waif of nature--like uprooted weed\r\n    Borne by the stream, or like a shaken reed,\r\n    A frail dependent of the fickle sky.\r\n    Far, far away, are all my natural kin;\r\n    The mother that erewhile hath hush'd my cry,\r\n    Almost hath grown a mere fond memory.\r\n    Where is my sister's smile? my brother's boisterous din?\r\n    Ah! nowhere now. A matron grave and sage,\r\n    A holy mother is that sister sweet.\r\n    And that bold brother is a pastor meet\r\n    To guide, instruct, reprove a sinful age,\r\n    Almost I fear, and yet I fain would greet;\r\n    So far astray hath been my pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n    How shall a man fore-doom'd to lone estate,\r\n    Untimely old, irreverently gray,\r\n    Much like a patch of dusky snow in May,\r\n    Dead sleeping in a hollow--all too late--\r\n    How shall so poor a thing congratulate\r\n    The blest completion of a patient wooing,\r\n    Or how commend a younger man for doing\r\n    What ne'er to do hath been his fault or fate?\r\n    There is a fable, that I once did read.\r\n    Of a bad angel that was someway good,\r\n    And therefore on the brink of Heaven he stood,\r\n    Looking each way, and no way could proceed;\r\n    Till at the last he purged away his sin\r\n    By loving all the joy he saw within.\r\n\r\nHere is another poem of very touching reference to his personal story:\r\n\r\n    \"When I received this volume small,\r\n      My years were barely seventeen;\r\n    When it was hoped I should be all\r\n      Which once, alas! I might have been.\r\n\r\n    \"And now my years are thirty-five,\r\n      And every mother hopes her lamb,\r\n    And every happy child alive,\r\n      May never be what now I am.\r\n\r\n    \"But yet should any chance to look\r\n      On the strange medley scribbled here.\r\n    I charge thee, tell them, little book,\r\n      I am not vile as I appear.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! tell them though thy purpose lame\r\n      In fortune's race, was still behind,--\r\n    Though earthly blots my name defiled,\r\n      They ne'er abused my better mind.\r\n\r\n    \"Of what men are, and why they are\r\n      So weak, so wofully beguiled,\r\n    Much I have learned, but better far,\r\n      I know my soul is reconciled.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we shut the volumes--which will often and often be re-opened by\r\ntheir readers--we may instance, in proof of the variety of his verse,\r\nsome masterly heroic couplets on the character of Dryden, which will be\r\nseen in a series of admirable \"sketches of English poets\" found written\r\non the fly-leaves and covers of his copy of _Anderson's British Poets_.\r\nThe successors of Dryden are not less admirably handled, and there are\r\nsome sketches of Wilkie, Dodsley, Langhorne, and rhymers of that class,\r\ninimitable for their truth and spirit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[J] Poems by Hartley Coleridge.

well-a-day!\r\n    What time spring thaws the wold,\r\n    And in the dead leaves come up sprouts of gold,\r\n    And green and ribby blue, that after hours\r\n    Encrown with flowers;\r\n    Heavily lies my heart\r\n    From all delights apart,\r\n    Even as an echo hungry for the wind,\r\n    When fail the silver-kissing waves to unbind\r\n    The music bedded in the drowsy strings\r\n      Of the sea's golden shells--\r\n    That, sometimes, with their honeyed murmurings\r\n      Fill all its underswells:\r\n    For o'er the sunshine fell a shadow wide\r\n    When Lyra died.\r\n    When sober Autumn, with his mist-bound brows,\r\n    Sits drearily beneath the fading boughs,\r\n    And the rain, chilly cold,\r\n    Wrings from his beard of gold,\r\n    And as some comfort for his lonesome hours,\r\n    Hides in his bosom stalks of withered flowers,\r\n    I think about what leaves are drooping round\r\n    A smoothly shapen mound;\r\n    And if the wild wind cries\r\n    Where Lyra lies,\r\n    Sweet shepherds, softly blow\r\n    Ditties most sad and low--\r\n    Piping on hollow reeds to your pent sheep--\r\n    Calm be my Lyra's sleep.\r\n    Unvexed with dream of the rough briers that pull\r\n    From his strayed lambs the wool!\r\n    O, star, that tremblest dim\r\n    Upon the welkin's rim,\r\n    Send with thy milky shadows from above\r\n    Tidings about my love;\r\n    If that some envious wave\r\n    Made his untimely grave,\r\n    Or if, so softening half my wild regrets,\r\n    Some coverlid of bluest violets\r\n    Was softly put aside,\r\n    What time he died!\r\n    Nay, come not, piteous maids,\r\n    Out of the murmurous shades;\r\n    But keep your tresses crowned as you may\r\n    With eglantine and daffodillies gay,\r\n    And with the dews of myrtles wash your cheek,\r\n    When flamy streaks,\r\n    Uprunning the gray orient, tell of morn--\r\n    While I, forlorn,\r\n    Pour all my heart in tears and plaints, instead,\r\n    FOR LYRA, DEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 126._\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.--CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Dale had been more than a quarter of an hour conversing with Mrs.\r\nAvenel, and had seemingly made little progress in the object of his\r\ndiplomatic mission, for now, slowly drawing on his gloves, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"I grieve to think, Mrs. Avenel, that you should have so hardened your\r\nheart--yes--you must pardon me--it is my vocation to speak stern truths.\r\nYou cannot say that I have not kept faith with you, but I must now\r\ninvite you to remember that I specially reserved to myself the right of\r\nexercising a discretion to act as I judged best, for the child's\r\ninterests, on any future occasion; and it was upon this understanding\r\nthat you gave me the promise, which you would now evade, of providing\r\nfor him when he came into manhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say I will provide for him. I say that you may 'prentice him in any\r\ndistant town, and by-and-by we will stock a shop for him. What would you\r\nhave more, sir, from folks like us, who have kept shop ourselves? It\r\nain't reasonable what you ask, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend,\" said the Parson, \"what I ask of you at present is but\r\nto see him--to receive him kindly--to listen to his conversation--to\r\njudge for yourselves. We can have but a common object--that your\r\ngrandson should succeed in life, and do you credit. Now, I doubt very\r\nmuch whether we can effect this by making him a small shopkeeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has Jane Fairfield, who married a common carpenter, brought him up\r\nto despise small shopkeepers?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid! Some of the first men in England have been the sons of\r\nsmall shopkeepers. But is it a crime in them, or their parents, if their\r\ntalents have lifted them into such rank or renown as the haughtiest duke\r\nmight envy? England were not England if a man must rest where his father\r\nbegan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said, or rather grunted, an approving voice, but neither Mrs.\r\nAvenel nor the Parson heard it.\r\n\r\n\"All very fine,\" said Mrs. Avenel, bluntly. \"But to send a boy like that\r\nto the university--where's the money to come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Avenel,\" said the Parson, coaxingly, \"the cost need not be\r\ngreat at a small college at Cambridge; and if you will pay half the\r\nexpense, I will pay the other half. I have no children of my own, and\r\ncan afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very handsome in you, sir,\" said Mrs. Avenel, somewhat touched,\r\nyet still not graciously, \"But the money is not the only point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once at Cambridge,\" continued Mr. Dale, speaking rapidly, \"at\r\nCambridge, where the studies are mathematical--that is, of a nature for\r\nwhich he has shown so great an aptitude--and I have no doubt he will\r\ndistinguish himself; if he does, he will obtain, on leaving, what is\r\ncalled a fellowship--that is a collegiate dignity accompanied by an\r\nincome on which he could maintain himself until he made his way in life.\r\nCome, Mrs. Avenel, you are well off; you have no relations nearer to you\r\nin want of your aid. Your son, I hear, has been very fortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Mrs. Avenel, interrupting the Parson, \"it is not because my\r\nson Richard is an honor to us, and is a good son, and has made his\r\nfortin, that we are to rob him of what we have to leave, and give it to\r\na boy whom we know nothing about, and who, in spite of what you say,\r\ncan't bring upon us any credit at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? I don't see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, fiercely--\"why? you know why. No, I don't\r\nwant him to rise in life; I don't want folks to be speiring and asking\r\nabout him. I think it is a very wicked thing to have put fine notions in\r\nhis head, and I am sure my daughter Fairfield could not have done it\r\nherself. And now, to ask me to rob Richard, and bring out a great\r\nboy--who's been a gardener, or ploughman, or such like--to disgrace a\r\ngentleman who keeps his carriage, as my son Richard does--I would have\r\nyou to know, sir, no! I won't do it, and there's an end to the matter.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last two or three minutes, and just before that approving\r\n\"good\" had responded to the Parson's popular sentiment, a door\r\ncommunicating with an inner room had been gently opened, and stood ajar;\r\nbut this incident neither party had even noticed. But now the door was\r\nthrown boldly open, and the traveller whom the Parson had met at the inn\r\nwalked up to Mr. Dale, and said, \"No! that's not the end of the matter.\r\nYou say the boy's a cute, clever lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard, have you been listening?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess, yes--the last few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what have you heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that this reverend gentleman thinks so highly of my sister\r\nFairfield's boy that he offers to pay half of his keep at college. Sir,\r\nI'm very much obliged to you, and there's my hand, if you'll take it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson jumped up, overjoyed, and, with a triumphant glance towards\r\nMrs. Avenel, shook hands heartily with Mr. Richard.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the latter, \"just put on your hat, sir, and take a stroll\r\nwith me, and we'll discuss the thing business-like. Women don't\r\nunderstand business; never talk to women on business.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Richard drew out a cigar-case, selected a cigar,\r\nwhich he applied to the candle, and walked into the hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel caught hold of the Parson. \"Sir, you'll be on your guard\r\nwith Richard. Remember your promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not know all, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He? No! And you see he did not overhear more than what he says. I'm\r\nsure you're a gentleman, and won't go agin your word.\"\r\n\r\n\"My word was conditional; but I will promise you never to break the\r\nsilence without more reason than I think there is here for it. Indeed,\r\nMr. Richard Avenel seems to save all necessity for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming, sir?\" cried Richard, as he opened the street door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Parson joined Mr. Richard Avenel on the road. It was a fine night,\r\nand the moon clear and shining.\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" said Mr. Richard, thoughtfully, \"poor Jane, who was always\r\nthe drudge of the family, has contrived to bring up her son well; and\r\nthe boy is really what you say, eh?--could make a figure at college?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" said the Parson, hooking himself on to the arm which\r\nMr Avenel proffered.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see him,\" said Richard. \"Has he any manner? Is he\r\ngenteel, or a mere country lout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, he speaks with so much propriety, and has so much modest\r\ndignity, I might say, about him, that there's many a rich gentleman who\r\nwould be proud of such a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is odd,\" observed Richard, \"what difference there is in families.\r\nThere's Jane now--who can't read nor write, and was just fit to be a\r\nworkman's wife--had not a thought above her station; and when I think of\r\nmy poor sister Nora--you would not believe it, sir, but _she_ was the\r\nmost elegant creature in the world--yes, even as a child, (she was but a\r\nchild when I went off to America.) And often, as I was getting on in\r\nlife, often I used to say to myself, 'My little Nora shall be a lady\r\nafter all. Poor thing--but she died young.'\"\r\n\r\nRichard's voice grew husky.\r\n\r\nThe Parson kindly pressed the arm on which he leaned, and said, after a\r\npause--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing refines us like education, sir. I believe your sister Nora had\r\nreceived much instruction, and had the talents to profit by it. It is\r\nthe same with your nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see him,\" said Richard, stamping his foot firmly on the ground,\r\n\"and if I like him, I'll be as good as a father to him. Look you,\r\nMr.--what's your name, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dale, look you, I'm a single man. Perhaps I may marry some day;\r\nperhaps I shan't. I'm not going to throw myself away. If I can get a\r\nlady of quality, why--but that's neither here nor there; meanwhile, I\r\nshould be glad of a nephew whom I need not be ashamed of. You see, sir,\r\nI'm a new man, the builder of my own fortunes; and, though I have picked\r\nup a little education--I don't well know how--as I scrambled on, still,\r\nnow I come back to the old country, I'm well aware that I am not exactly\r\na match for those d----d aristocrats--don't show so well in a\r\ndrawing-room as I could wish. I could be a Parliament man if I liked,\r\nbut I might make a goose of myself; so, all things considered, if I can\r\nget a sort of junior partner to do the polite work, and show off the\r\ngoods, I think the house of Avenel & Co. might become a pretty\r\nconsiderable honor to the Britishers. You understand me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" answered Mr. Dale, smiling, though rather gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued the New Man, \"I'm not ashamed to have risen in life by\r\nmy own merits; and I don't disguise what I've been. And, when I'm in my\r\nown grand house, I'm fond of saying, 'I landed at New-York with ten\r\npounds in my purse, and here I am!' But it would not do to have the old\r\nfolks with me. People take you with all your faults, if you're rich, but\r\nthey won't swallow your family into the bargain. So, if I don't have my\r\nown father and mother, whom I love dearly, and should like to see\r\nsitting at table, with my servants behind their chairs, I could still\r\nless have sister Jane. I recollect her very well, and she can't have got\r\ngenteeler as she's grown older. Therefore I beg you'll not set her on\r\ncoming after me; it won't do by any manner of means. Don't say a word\r\nabout me to her. But send the boy down here to his grandfather, and I'll\r\nsee him quietly, you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it will be hard to separate her from the boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! all boys are separated from their parents when they go into the\r\nworld. So that's settled. Now, just tell me. I know the old folks always\r\nsnubbed Jane--that is, mother did. My poor dear father never snubbed any\r\nof us. Perhaps mother has not behaved altogether well to Jane. But we\r\nmust not blame her for that; you see this is how it happened. There were\r\na good many of us, while father and mother kept shop in the High Street,\r\nso we were all to be provided for, anyhow; and Jane, being very useful\r\nand handy at work, got a place when she was a little girl, and had no\r\ntime for learning. Afterwards my father made a lucky hit, in getting my\r\nLord Lansmere's custom after an election, in which he did a great deal\r\nfor the Blues, (for he was a famous electioneerer, my poor father.) My\r\nLady stood godmother to Nora; and then most of my brothers and sisters\r\ndied off, and father retired from business; and when he took Jane from\r\nservice, she was so common-like that mother could not help contrasting\r\nher with Nora. You see Jane was their child when they were poor little\r\nshop people, with their heads scarce above water; and Nora was their\r\nchild when they were well off, and had retired from trade, and lived\r\ngenteel: so that makes a great difference. And mother did not quite look\r\non her as on her own child. But it was Jane's own fault; for mother\r\nwould have made it up with her if she had married the son of our\r\nneighbor the great linen-draper, as she might have done; but she would\r\ntake Mark Fairfield, a common carpenter. Parents like best those of\r\ntheir children who succeed best in life. Natural. Why, they did not care\r\nfor me until I came back the man I am. But to return to Jane: I'm afraid\r\nthey've neglected her. How is she off?\"\r\n\r\n\"She earns her livelihood, and is poor, but contented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, just be good enough to give her this,\" and Richard took a bank-note\r\nof fifty pounds from his pocket-book. \"You can say the old folks sent it\r\nto her; or that it is a present from Dick, without telling her he had\r\ncome back from America.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the Parson, \"I am more and more thankful to have\r\nmade your acquaintance. This is a very liberal gift of yours; but your\r\nbest plan will be to send it through your mother. For, though I don't\r\nwant to betray any confidence you place in me, I should not know what to\r\nanswer if Mrs. Fairfield began to question me about her brother. I never\r\nhad but one secret to keep, and I hope I shall never have another. A\r\nsecret is very like a lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"You had a secret, then,\" said Richard, as he took back the bank-note.\r\nHe had learned, perhaps, in America, to be a very inquisitive man. He\r\nadded point-blank, \"Pray what was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what it would not be if I told you,\" said the Parson, with a\r\nforced laugh,--\"a secret!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess we're in a land of liberty. Do as you like. Now, I\r\ndaresay you think me a very odd fellow to come out of my shell to you in\r\nthis off-hand way. But I liked the look of you, even when we were at the\r\ninn together. And just now I was uncommonly pleased to find that, though\r\nyou are a parson, you don't want to keep a man's nose down to a\r\nshop-board, if he has any thing in him. You're not one of the\r\naristocrats--\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said the Parson with imprudent warmth, \"it is not the\r\ncharacter of the aristocracy of this country to keep people down. They\r\nmake way amongst themselves for any man, whatever his birth, who has the\r\ntalent and energy to aspire to their level. That's the especial boast of\r\nthe British constitution, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think so do you!\" said Mr. Richard, looking sourly at the\r\nParson. \"I daresay those are the opinions in which you have brought up\r\nthe lad. Just keep him yourself, and let the aristocracy provide for\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nThe parson's generous and patriotic warmth evaporated at once, at this\r\nsudden inlet of cold air into the conversation. He perceived that he had\r\nmade a terrible blunder; and, as it was not his business at that moment\r\nto vindicate the British constitution, but to serve Leonard Fairfield,\r\nhe abandoned the cause of the aristocracy with the most poltroon and\r\nscandalous abruptness. Catching at the arm which Mr. Avenel had\r\nwithdrawn from him, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir, you are mistaken; I have never attempted to influence your\r\nnephew's political opinions. On the contrary, if, at his age, he can be\r\nsaid to have formed any opinion, I am greatly afraid--that is, I think\r\nhis opinions are by no means sound--that is constitutional. I mean, I\r\nmean--\" And the poor Parson, anxious to select a word that would not\r\noffend his listener, stopped short in lamentable confusion of idea.\r\n\r\nMr. Avenel enjoyed his distress for a moment, with a saturnine smile,\r\nand then said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I calculate he's a Radical. Natural enough, if he has not got a\r\nsixpence to lose--all come right by-and-by. I'm not a Radical--at least\r\nnot a destructive--much too clever a man for that, I hope. But I wish to\r\nsee things very different from what they are. Don't fancy that I want\r\nthe common people, who've got nothing, to pretend to dictate to their\r\nbetters, because I hate to see a parcel of fellows, who are called lords\r\nand squires, trying to rule the roast. I think, sir, that it is men like\r\nme who ought to be at the top of the tree! and that's the long and short\r\nof it. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've not the least objection,\" said the crestfallen Parson basely. But,\r\nto do him justice, I must add that he did not the least know what he was\r\nsaying!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nUnconscious of the change in his fate which the diplomacy of the Parson\r\nsought to effect, Leonard Fairfield was enjoying the first virgin\r\nsweetness of fame; for the principal town in his neighborhood had\r\nfollowed the then growing fashion of the age, and set up a Mechanic's\r\nInstitute; and some worthy persons interested in the formation of that\r\nprovincial Athenæum had offered a prize for the best Essay on the\r\nDiffusion of Knowledge,--a very trite subject, on which persons seem to\r\nthink they can never say too much, and on which there is, nevertheless,\r\na great deal yet to be said. This prize Leonard Fairfield had recently\r\nwon. His Essay had been publicly complimented by a full meeting of the\r\nInstitute; it had been printed at the expense of the Society, and had\r\nbeen rewarded by a silver medal--delineative of Apollo crowning Merit,\r\n(poor Merit had not a rag to his back; but Merit, left only to the care\r\nof Apollo, never is too good a customer to the tailor!) And the County\r\nGazette had declared that Britain had produced another prodigy in the\r\nperson of Dr. Riccabocca's self-educated gardener.\r\n\r\nAttention was now directed to Leonard's mechanical contrivances. The\r\nSquire, ever eagerly bent on improvements, had brought an engineer to\r\ninspect the lad's system of irrigation, and the engineer had been\r\ngreatly struck by the simple means by which a very considerable\r\ntechnical difficulty had been overcome. The neighboring farmers now\r\ncalled Leonard \"_Mr._ Fairfield,\" and invited him on equal terms, to\r\ntheir houses. Mr. Stirn had met him on the high road, touched his hat,\r\nand hoped that \"he bore no malice.\" All this, I say, was the first\r\nsweetness of fame; and if Leonard Fairfield comes to be a great man, he\r\nwill never find such sweets in the after fruit. It was this success\r\nwhich had determined the Parson on the step which he had just taken, and\r\nwhich he had long before anxiously meditated. For, during the last year\r\nor so, he had renewed his old intimacy with the widow and the boy; and\r\nhe had noticed, with great hope and great fear, the rapid growth of an\r\nintellect, which now stood out from the lowly circumstances that\r\nsurrounded it in bold and unharmonizing relief.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening after his return home that the Parson strolled up to\r\nthe Casino. He put Leonard Fairfield's Prize Essay in his pocket. For he\r\nfelt that he could not let the young man go forth into the world without\r\na preparatory lecture, and he intended to scourge poor Merit with the\r\nvery laurel wreath which it had received from Apollo. But in this he\r\nwanted Riccabocca's assistance; or rather he feared that, if he did not\r\nget the Philosopher on his side, the Philosopher might undo all the work\r\nof the Parson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA sweet sound came through the orange boughs, and floated to the ears of\r\nthe Parson, as he wound slowly up the gentle ascent--so sweet, so\r\nsilvery, he paused in delight--unaware, wretched man! that he was\r\nthereby conniving at Papistical errors. Soft it came, and sweet: softer\r\nand sweeter--\"Ave Maria!\" Violante was chanting the evening hymn to the\r\nVirgin Mother. The Parson at last distinguished the sense of the words,\r\nand shook his head with the pious shake of an orthodox Protestant. He\r\nbroke from the spell resolutely, and walked on with a sturdy step.\r\nGaining the terrace he found the little family seated under an awning.\r\nMrs. Riccabocca knitting; the Signor with his arms folded on his breast:\r\nthe book he had been reading a few moments before had fallen on the\r\nground, and his dark eyes were soft and dreamy. Violante had finished\r\nher hymn, and seated herself on the ground between the two, pillowing\r\nher head on her step-mother's lap, but with her hand resting on her\r\nfather's knee, and her gaze fixed fondly on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" said Mr. Dale. Violante stole up to him, and, pulling\r\nhim so as to bring his ear nearer to her lip, whispered,--\"Talk to papa,\r\ndo--and cheerfully; he is sad.\"\r\n\r\nShe escaped from him, as she said this, and appeared to busy herself\r\nwith watering the flowers arranged on stands round the awning. But she\r\nkept her swimming lustrous eyes wistfully on her father.\r\n\r\n\"How fares it with you, my dear friend?\" said the Parson kindly, as he\r\nrested his hand on the Italian's shoulder. \"You must not let him get out\r\nof spirits, Mrs. Riccabocca.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very ungrateful to her if I ever am so,\" said the poor Italian,\r\nwith all his natural gallantry. Many a good wife, who thinks it is a\r\nreproach to her if her husband is ever 'out of spirits,' might have\r\nturned peevishly from that speech more elegant than sincere, and so have\r\nmade bad worse. But Mrs. Riccabocca took her husband's proffered hand\r\naffectionately, and said with great _naïveté_:\r\n\r\n\"You see I am so stupid, Mr. Dale; I never knew I was so stupid till I\r\nmarried. But I am very glad you are come. You can get on some learned\r\nsubject together, and then he will not miss so much his--\"\r\n\r\n\"His what?\" asked Riccabocca, inquisitively.\r\n\r\n\"His country. Do you think that I cannot sometimes read your thoughts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very often. But you did not read them just then. The tongue touches\r\nwhere the tooth aches, but the best dentist cannot guess at the tooth\r\nunless one opens one's mouth. _Basta!_ Can we offer you some wine of our\r\nown making, Mr. Dale?--it is pure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather have some tea,\" quoth the Parson hastily.\r\n\r\nMrs. Riccabocca, too pleased to be in her natural element of domestic\r\nuse, hurried into the house to prepare our national beverage. And the\r\nParson, sliding into her chair, said--\r\n\r\n\"But you are dejected, then? Fie! If there's a virtue in the world at\r\nwhich we should always aim, it is cheerfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't dispute it,\" said Riccabocca, with a heavy sigh. \"But though it\r\nis said by some Greek, who, I think, is quoted by your favorite Seneca,\r\nthat a wise man carries his country with him at the soles of his feet,\r\nhe can't carry also the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is,\" said the Parson bluntly, \"you would have a much\r\nkeener sense of happiness if you had much less esteem for philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said the Doctor, rousing himself. \"Just explain, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does not the search after wisdom induce desires not satisfied in this\r\nsmall circle to which your life is confined? It is not so much your\r\ncountry for which you yearn, as it is for space to your intellect,\r\nemployment for your thoughts, career for your aspirations.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed at the tooth which aches,\" said Riccabocca with\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\"Easy to do that,\" answered the Parson. \"Our wisdom teeth come last, and\r\ngive us the most pain. And if you would just starve the mind a little,\r\nand nourish the heart more, you would be less of a philosopher, and more\r\nof a--\" The Parson had the word \"Christian\" at the tip of his tongue: he\r\nsuppressed a word that, so spoken, would have been exceedingly\r\nirritating, and substituted, with inelegant antithesis, \"and more of a\r\nhappy man!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do all I can with my heart,\" quoth the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Not you! For a man with such a heart as yours should never feel the\r\nwant of the sunshine. My friend, we live in an age of over mental\r\ncultivation. We neglect too much the simple healthful outer life, in\r\nwhich there is so much positive joy. In turning to the world within us,\r\nwe grow blind to this beautiful world without; in studying ourselves as\r\nmen, we almost forget to look up to heaven, and warm to the smile of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosopher mechanically shrugged his shoulders, as he always did\r\nwhen another man moralised--especially if the moraliser were a priest;\r\nbut there was no irony in his smile, as he answered thoughtfully--\r\n\r\n\"There is some truth in what you say. I own that we live too much as if\r\nwe were all brain. Knowledge has its penalties and pains, as well as its\r\nprizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I want you to say to Leonard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How have you settled the object of your journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you as we walk down to him after tea. At present, I am\r\nrather too much occupied with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? The tree is formed--try only to bend the young twig!\"\r\n\r\n\"Trees are trees, and twigs twigs,\" said the Parson dogmatically; \"but\r\nman is always growing till he falls into the grave. I think I have heard\r\nyou say that you once had a narrow escape of a prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very narrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just suppose that you were now in that prison, and that a fairy\r\nconjured up the prospect of this quiet home in a safe land; that you saw\r\nthe orange trees in flower, felt the evening breeze on your cheek;\r\nbeheld your child gay or sad, as you smiled or knit your brow; that\r\nwithin this phantom home was a woman, not, indeed, all your young\r\nromance might have dreamed of, but faithful and true, every beat of her\r\nheart all your own--would you not cry from the depth of the dungeon, \"O\r\nfairy! such a change were a paradise.\" Ungrateful man! you want\r\ninterchange for your mind, and your heart should suffice for all!\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was touched and silent.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, my child,\" said Mr. Dale, turning round to Violante, who\r\nstill stood among the flowers, out of hearing, but with watchful eyes.\r\n\"Come hither,\" he said, opening big arms.\r\n\r\nViolante bounded forward, and nestled to the good man's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Violante, when you are alone in the fields or the garden, and\r\nhave left your father looking pleased and serene, so that you have no\r\ncare for him at your heart,--tell me, Violante, though you are all\r\nalone, with the flowers below and the birds singing overhead, do you\r\nfeel that life itself is happiness or sorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Happiness!\" answered Violante, half shutting her eyes, and in a\r\nmeasured voice.\r\n\r\n\"Can you explain what kind of happiness it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, impossible! and it is never the same. Sometimes it is so\r\nstill--so still--and sometimes so joyous, that I long for wings to fly\r\nup to God, and thank him!\"\r\n\r\n\"O friend,\" said the Parson, \"this is the true sympathy between life and\r\nnature, and thus we should feel ever, did we take more care to preserve\r\nthe health and innocence of a child. We are told that we must become as\r\nchildren to enter into the kingdom of heaven; methinks we should also\r\nbecome as children to know what delight there is in our heritage of\r\nearth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe maid servant (for Jackeymo was in the fields) brought the table\r\nunder the awning, and, with the English luxury of tea, there were other\r\ndrinks as cheap and as grateful on summer evenings--drinks which\r\nJackeymo had retained and taught from the customs of the\r\nsouth--unebriate liquors, pressed from cooling fruits, sweetened with\r\nhoney, and deliciously iced; ice should cost nothing in a country in\r\nwhich one is frozen up half the year! And Jackeymo, too, had added to\r\nour good, solid, heavy English bread, preparations of wheat much\r\nlighter, and more propitious to digestion--with those crisp _grissins_,\r\nwhich seem to enjoy being eaten, they make so pleasant a noise between\r\none's teeth.\r\n\r\nThe Parson esteemed it a little treat to drink tea with the Riccaboccas.\r\nThere was something of elegance and grace in that homely meal, at the\r\npoor exile's table, which pleased the eye as well as taste. And the very\r\nutensils, plain Wedgewood though they were, had a classical simplicity,\r\nwhich made Mrs. Hazeldean's old India delf, and Mrs. Dale's best\r\nWorcester china look tawdry and barbarous in comparison. For it was a\r\nFlaxman who gave designs to Wedgewood, and the most truly refined of all\r\nour manufactures in porcelain (if we do not look to the mere material)\r\nis in the reach of the most thrifty.\r\n\r\nThe little banquet was at first rather a silent one; but Riccabocca\r\nthrew off his gloom, and became gay and animated. Then poor Mrs.\r\nRiccabocca smiled, and pressed the _grissins_; and Violante, forgetting\r\nall her stateliness, laughed and played tricks on the Parson, stealing\r\naway his cup of warm tea when his head was turned, and substituting iced\r\ncherry juice. Then the Parson got up and ran after Violante, making\r\nangry faces, and Violante dodged beautifully, till the Parson, fairly\r\ntired out, was too glad to cry \"Peace,\" and come back to the cherry\r\njuice. Thus time rolled on, till they heard afar the stroke of the\r\ndistant church clock, and Mr. Dale started up and cried, \"But we shall\r\nbe too late for Leonard. Come, naughty little girl, get your father his\r\nhat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And umbrella!\" said Riccabocca, looking up at the cloudless moonlit\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"Umbrella against the stars?\" asked the Parson laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The stars are no friends of mine,\" said Riccabocca, \"and one never\r\nknows what may happen!\"\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher and the Parson walked on amicably.\r\n\r\n\"You have done me good,\" said Riccabocca, \"but I hope I am not always so\r\nunreasonably melancholic as you seem to suspect. The evenings will\r\nsometimes appear long, and dull too, to a man whose thoughts on the past\r\nare almost his sole companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sole companions?--your child?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is so young.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is so--,\" the bland Italian appeared to check some disparaging\r\nadjective, and mildly added, \"so good, I allow; but you must own that we\r\ncannot have much in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"I own nothing of the sort. You have your house and your interests, your\r\nhappiness and your lives, in common. We men are so exacting, we expect\r\nto find ideal nymphs and goddesses when we condescend to marry a mortal;\r\nand if we did, our chickens would be boiled to rags, and our mutton come\r\nup as cold as a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Per Bacco, you are an oracle,\" said Riccabocca, laughing. \"But I am not\r\nso sceptical you are. I honor the fair sex too much. There are a great\r\nmany women who realize the ideal of men to be found in--the poets!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my dear Mrs. Dale,\" resumed the Parson, not heeding this\r\nsarcastic compliment to the sex, but sinking his voice into a whisper,\r\nand looking round cautiously--\"there's my dear Mrs. Dale, the best woman\r\nin the world--an angel I would say, if the word was not profane; BUT--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the BUT?\" asked the Doctor, demurely.\r\n\r\n\"BUT I too might say that 'we have not much in common,' if I were only\r\nto compare mind to mind, and, when my poor Carry says something less\r\nprofound than Madame de Staël might have said, smile on her in contempt\r\nfrom the elevation of logic and Latin. Yet, when I remember all the\r\nlittle sorrows and joys that we have shared together, and feel how\r\nsolitary I should have been without her--oh, then I am instantly aware\r\nthat there _is_ between us in common something infinitely closer and\r\nbetter than if the same course of study had given us the same equality\r\nof ideas; and I was forced to brace myself for a combat of intellect, as\r\nI am when I fall in with a tiresome sage like yourself. I don't pretend\r\nto say that Mrs. Riccabocca is a Mrs. Dale,\" added the Parson, with\r\nlofty candor--\"there is but one Mrs. Dale in the world; but still, you\r\nhave drawn a prize in the wheel matrimonial! Think of Socrates, and yet\r\nhe was content even with his--Xantippe!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca called to mind Mrs. Dale's \"little tempers,\" and inly\r\nrejoiced that no second Mrs. Dale had existed to fall to his own lot.\r\nHis placid Jemima gained by the contrast. Nevertheless, he had the ill\r\ngrace to reply, \"Socrates was a man beyond all imitation!--Yet I believe\r\nthat even he spent very few of his evenings at home. But, _revenons à\r\nnos moutons_, we are nearly at Mrs. Fairfield's cottage, and you have\r\nnot yet told me what you have settled as to Leonard.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson halted, took Riccabocca by the button, and informed him, in\r\nvery few words, that Leonard was to go to Lansmere to see some relations\r\nthere, who had the fortune, if they had the will, to give full career to\r\nhis abilities.\r\n\r\n\"The great thing, in the meanwhile,\" said the Parson, \"would be to\r\nenlighten him a little as to what he calls--enlightenment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Riccabocca, diverted, and rubbing his hands, \"I shall listen\r\nwith interest to what you say on that subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"And must aid me; for the first step in this modern march of\r\nenlightenment is to leave the poor Parson behind; and if one calls out,\r\n'Hold! and look at the sign-post.' the traveller hurries on the faster,\r\nsaying to himself, 'Pooh, pooh!--that is only the cry of the Parson!'\r\nBut my gentleman, when he doubts me, will listen to you--you're a\r\nphilosopher!\"\r\n\r\n\"We philosophers are of some use now and then, even to Parsons!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were not so conceited a set of deluded poor creatures already, I\r\nwould say 'Yes,'\" replied the Parson generously; and, taking hold of\r\nRiccabocca's umbrella, he applied the brass handle thereof, by way of a\r\nknocker, to the cottage door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is a glorious fever that desire To Know! And there are few\r\nsights in the moral world more sublime than that which many a garret\r\nmight afford, if Asmodeus would bare the roofs to our survey--viz., a\r\nbrave, patient, earnest human being, toiling his own arduous way,\r\nathwart the iron walls of penury, into the magnificent Infinite, which\r\nis luminous with starry souls.\r\n\r\nSo there sits Leonard the Self-taught in the little cottage alone; for\r\nthough scarcely past the hour in which great folks dine, it is the hour\r\nin which small folks go to bed, and Mrs. Fairfield has retired to rest,\r\nwhile Leonard has settled to his books.\r\n\r\nHe had placed his table under the lattice, and from time to time he\r\nlooked up and enjoyed the stillness of the moon. Well for him that, in\r\nreparation for those hours stolen from night, the hardy physical labor\r\ncommenced with dawn. Students would not be the sad dyspeptics they are\r\nif they worked as many hours in the open air as my scholar-peasant. But\r\neven in him you could see that the mind had begun a little to affect the\r\nframe. They who task the intellect must pay the penalty with the body.\r\nIll, believe me, would this work-day world get on if all within it were\r\nhard-reading, studious animals, playing the deuce with the ganglionic\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nLeonard started as he heard the knock at the door; the Parson's\r\nwell-known voice reassured him. In some surprise he admitted his\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\"We are come to talk to you, Leonard,\" said Mr. Dale, \"but I fear we\r\nshall disturb Mrs. Fairfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir! the door to the staircase is shut, and she sleeps soundly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is a French book--do you read French, Leonard?\" asked\r\nRiccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"I have not found French difficult, sir. Once over the grammar, and the\r\nlanguage is so clear; it seems the very language for reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. Voltaire said justly, 'Whatever is obscure is not French,'\"\r\nobserved Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could say the same of English,\" muttered the Parson.\r\n\r\n\"But what is this?--Latin too?--Virgil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. But I find I make little way there without a master. I fear I\r\nmust give it up,\" (and Leonard sighed.)\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen exchanged looks and seated themselves. The young\r\npeasant remained standing modestly, and in his air and mien there was\r\nsomething that touched the heart while it pleased the eye. He was no\r\nlonger the timid boy who had sunk from the frown of Mr. Stirn, nor that\r\nrude personation of simple physical strength, roused to undisciplined\r\nbravery, which had received its downfall on the village-green of\r\nHazeldean. The power of thought was on his brow--somewhat unquiet still,\r\nbut mild and earnest. The features had attained that refinement which is\r\noften attributed to race, but comes, in truth, from elegance of idea,\r\nwhether caught from our parents or learned from books. In his rich brown\r\nhair, thrown carelessly from his temples, and curling almost to the\r\nshoulders--in his large blue eye, which was deepened to the hue of the\r\nviolet by the long dark lash--in that firmness of lip, which comes from\r\nthe grapple with difficulties, there was considerable beauty, but no\r\nlonger the beauty of the mere peasant. And yet there was still about the\r\nwhole countenance that expression of goodness and purity which the\r\npainter would give to his ideal of the peasant lover--such as Tasso\r\nwould have placed in the _Aminta_, or Fletcher have admitted to the side\r\nof the Faithful Shepherdess.\r\n\r\n\"You must draw a chair here, and sit down between us, Leonard,\" said the\r\nParson.\r\n\r\n\"If any one,\" said Riccabocca, \"has a right to sit, it is the one who\r\nis to hear the sermon; and if any one ought to stand, it is the one who\r\nis about to preach it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened, Leonard,\" said the Parson, graciously; \"it is only\r\na criticism, not a sermon,\" and he pulled out Leonard's Prize Essay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"You take for your motto this aphorism[K]--'_Knowledge is\r\nPower._'--BACON.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Bacon make such an aphorism! The last man in the world\r\nto have said any thing so pert and so shallow.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (astonished).--\"Do you mean to say, sir, that that aphorism is\r\nnot in Lord Bacon! Why, I have seen it quoted as his in almost every\r\nnewspaper, and in almost every speech in favor of popular education.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Then that should be a warning to you never again to fall\r\ninto the error of the would-be scholar--viz. quote second-hand. Lord\r\nBacon wrote a great book to show in what knowledge is power, how that\r\npower should be defined, in what it might be mistaken. And, pray, do you\r\nthink so sensible a man would ever have taken the trouble to write a\r\ngreat book upon the subject, if he could have packed up all he had to\r\nsay into the portable dogma, 'Knowledge is power?' Pooh! no such\r\naphorism is to be found in Bacon from the first page of his writings to\r\nthe last.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson_ (candidly).--\"Well, I supposed it was Lord Bacon's, and I am\r\nvery glad to hear that the aphorism has not the sanction of his\r\nauthority.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (recovering his surprise).--\"But why so?\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Because it either says a great deal too much, or\r\njust--nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"At least, sir, it seems to be undeniable.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Well, grant that it is undeniable. Does it prove much in\r\nfavor of knowledge? Pray, is not ignorance power too?\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"And a power that has had much the best end of the\r\nquarter-staff.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"All evil is power, and does its power make it any thing the\r\nbetter?\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Fanaticism is power--and a power that has often swept\r\naway knowledge like a whirlwind. The Mussulman burns the library of a\r\nworld--and forces the Koran and the sword from the schools of Byzantium\r\nto the colleges of Hindostan.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson_ (bearing on with a new column of illustration).--\"Hunger is\r\npower. The barbarians, starved out of their energy by their own swarming\r\npopulation, swept into Italy and annihilated letters. The Romans,\r\nhowever degraded, had more knowledge, at least, than the Gaul and the\r\nVisigoth.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca_ (bringing up the reserve).--\"And even in Greece, when Greek\r\nmet Greek, the Athenians--our masters in all knowledge--were beat by the\r\nSpartans, who held learning in contempt.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Wherefore you see, Leonard, that though knowledge be power,\r\nit is only _one_ of the powers of the world; that there are others as\r\nstrong, and often much stronger; and the assertion either means but a\r\nbarren truism, not worth so frequent a repetition, or it means something\r\nthat you would find it very difficult to prove.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"One nation may be beaten by another that has more physical\r\nstrength and more military discipline; which last, permit me to say,\r\nsir, is a species of knowledge;--\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Yes; but your knowledge-mongers at present call upon us\r\nto discard military discipline, and the qualities that produce it, from\r\nthe list of the useful arts. And in your own essay, you insist upon\r\nknowledge as the great disbander of armies, and the foe of all military\r\ndiscipline.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Let the young man proceed. Nations, you say, may be beaten\r\nby other nations less learned and civilized?\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"But knowledge elevates a class. I invite my own humble\r\norder to knowledge, because knowledge will lift them into power.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"What do you say to that, Mr. Dale?\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"In the first place, is it true that the class which has the\r\nmost knowledge gets the most power? I suppose philosophers, like my\r\nfriend Dr. Riccabocca, think they have the most knowledge. And pray, in\r\nwhat age have philosophers governed the world? Are they not always\r\ngrumbling that nobody attends to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Per Bacco,\" said Riccabocca, \"if people had attended to us, it would\r\nhave been a droll sort of world by this time!\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Very likely. But, as a general rule, those have the most\r\nknowledge who give themselves up to it the most. Let us put out of the\r\nquestion philosophers (who are often but ingenious lunatics), and speak\r\nonly of erudite scholars, men of letters and practical science,\r\nprofessors, tutors, and fellows of colleges. I fancy any member of\r\nParliament would tell us that there is no class of men which has less\r\nactual influence on public affairs. They have more knowledge than\r\nmanufacturers and ship-owners, squires and farmers; but, do you find\r\nthat they have more power over the Government and the votes of the House\r\nof Commons!\"\r\n\r\n\"They ought to have,\" said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\"Ought they?\" said the Parson: \"we'll consider that later. Meanwhile,\r\nyou must not escape from your own proposition, which is that knowledge\r\n_is_ power--not that it _ought_ to be. Now, even granting your\r\ncorollary, that the power of a class is therefore proportioned to its\r\nknowledge--pray, do you suppose that while your order, the operatives,\r\nare instructing themselves, all the rest of the community are to be at a\r\nstand-still? Diffuse knowledge as you may, you will never produce\r\nequality of knowledge. Those who have most leisure, application, and\r\naptitude for learning, will still know the most. Nay, by a very natural\r\nlaw, the more general the appetite for knowledge, the more the increased\r\ncompetition would favor those most adapted to excel by circumstances and\r\nnature. At this day, there is a vast increase of knowledge spread over\r\nall society, compared with that in the Middle Ages; but is there not a\r\nstill greater distinction between the highly-educated gentleman and the\r\nintelligent mechanic, than there was then between the baron who could\r\nnot sign his name and the churl at the plough? between the accomplished\r\nstatesman, versed in all historical law, and the voter whose politics\r\nare formed by his newspaper, than there was between the legislator who\r\npassed laws against witches, and the burgher who defended his guild from\r\nsome feudal aggression? between the enlightened scholar and the dunce of\r\nto-day, than there was between the monkish alchemist and the blockhead\r\nof yesterday? Peasant, voter, and dunce of this century are no doubt\r\nwiser than the churl, burgher, and blockhead of the twelfth. But the\r\ngentleman, statesman, and scholar of the present age are at least quite\r\nas favorable a contrast to the alchemist, witch-burner, and baron of\r\nold. As the progress of enlightenment has done hitherto, so will it ever\r\ndo. Knowledge is like capital: the more there is in a country, the\r\ngreater the disparities in wealth between one man and another.\r\nTherefore, if the working class increase in knowledge, so do the other\r\nclasses; and if the working class rise peacefully and legitimately into\r\npower, it is not in proportion to their own knowledge alone, but rather\r\naccording as it seems to the knowledge of the other orders of the\r\ncommunity, that such augmentation of proportional power is just, and\r\nsafe, and wise.\"\r\n\r\nPlaced between the Parson and the Philosopher, Leonard felt that his\r\nposition was not favorable to the display of his forces. Insensibly he\r\nedged his chair somewhat away, and said mournfully:\r\n\r\n\"Then, according to you, the reign of knowledge would be no great\r\nadvance in the aggregate freedom and welfare of man?\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Let us define. By knowledge, do you mean intellectual\r\ncultivation?--by the reign of knowledge, the ascendency of the most\r\ncultivated minds?\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (after a pause).--\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Oh indiscreet young man, that is an unfortunate\r\nconcession of yours; for the ascendency of the most cultivated minds\r\nwould be a terrible obligarchy!\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Perfectly true; and we now reply to your exclamation, that\r\nmen who, by profession, have most learning ought to have more influence\r\nthan squires and merchants, farmers and mechanics. Observe, all the\r\nknowledge that we mortals can acquire is not knowledge positive and\r\nperfect, but knowledge comparative, and subject to all the errors and\r\npassions of humanity. And suppose that you could establish, as the sole\r\nregulators of affairs, those who had the most mental cultivation, do you\r\nthink they would not like that power well enough to take all means their\r\nsuperior intelligence could devise to keep it to themselves? The\r\nexperiment was tried of old by the priests of Egypt; and in the empire\r\nof China, at this day, the aristocracy are elected from those who have\r\nmost distinguished themselves in learned colleges. If I may call myself\r\na member of that body, 'the people,' I would rather be an Englishman,\r\nhowever much displeased with dull Ministers and blundering Parliaments,\r\nthan I would be a Chinese under the rule of the picked sages of the\r\nCelestial Empire. Happily, therefore, my dear Leonard, nations are\r\ngoverned by many things besides what is commonly called knowledge; and\r\nthe greatest practical ministers, who, like Themistocles, have made\r\nsmall states great--and the most dominant races who, like the Romans,\r\nhave stretched their rule from a village half over the universe--have\r\nbeen distinguished by various qualities which a philosopher would sneer\r\nat, and a knowledge-monger would call 'sad prejudices,' and 'lamentable\r\nerrors of reason.'\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (bitterly).--\"Sir, you make use of knowledge itself to argue\r\nagainst knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"I make use of the little I know to prove the foolishness of\r\nidolatry. I do not argue against knowledge; I argue against\r\nknowledge-worship. For here, I see in your Essay, that you are not\r\ncontented with raising human knowledge into something like divine\r\nomnipotence, you must also confound her with virtue. According to you,\r\nwe have only to diffuse the intelligence of the few among the many, and\r\nall at which we preachers aim is accomplished. Nay more; for whereas we\r\nhumble preachers have never presumed to say, with the heathen Stoic,\r\nthat even virtue is sure of happiness below (though it be the best road\r\nto it), you tell us plainly that this knowledge of yours gives not only\r\nthe virtue of a saint, but bestows the bliss of a God. Before the steps\r\nof your idol the evils of life disappear. To hear you, one has but 'to\r\nknow,' in order to be exempt from the sins and sorrows of the ignorant.\r\nHas it ever been so? Grant that you diffuse amongst the many all the\r\nknowledge ever attained by the few. Have the wise few been so unerring\r\nand so happy? You supposed that your motto was accurately cited from\r\nBacon. What was Bacon himself? The poet tells you:\r\n\r\n    'The wisest, brightest, _meanest_ of mankind.'\r\n\r\nCan you hope to bestow upon the vast mass of your order the luminous\r\nintelligence of this 'Lord Chancellor of nature?' Grant that you do\r\nso--and what guarantee have you for the virtue and the happiness which\r\nyou assume as the concomitants of the gift? See Bacon himself; what\r\nblack ingratitude! what miserable self-seeking! what truckling\r\nservility! what abject and pitiful spirit! So far from intellectual\r\nknowledge, in its highest form and type, insuring virtue and bliss, it\r\nis by no means uncommon to find great mental cultivation combined with\r\ngreat moral corruption.\" (Aside to Riccabocca)--\"Push on, will you?\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"A combination remarkable in eras as in individuals.\r\nPetronius shows us a state of morals at which a commonplace devil would\r\nblush, in the midst of a society more intellectually cultivated than\r\ncertainly was that which produced Regulus or the Horatii. And the most\r\nlearned eras in modern Italy were precisely those which brought the\r\nvices into the most ghastly refinement.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (rising in great agitation, and clasping his hands).--\"I\r\ncannot contend with you, who produce against information so slender and\r\ncrude as mine the stores which have been locked from my reach. But I\r\nfeel that there must be another side to this shield--a shield that you\r\nwill not even allow to be silver. And, oh, if you thus speak of\r\nknowledge, why have you encouraged me to know?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my son!\" said the Parson, \"if I wished to prove the value of\r\nReligion, would you think I served it much, if I took as my motto,\r\n'Religion is power?' Would not that be a base and sordid view of its\r\nadvantages? And would you not say he who regards religion as a power,\r\nintends to abuse it as a priestcraft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well put!\" said Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment--let me think. Ah--I see, sir!\" said Leonard.\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"If the cause be holy, do not weigh it in the scales of the\r\nmarket; if its objects be peaceful, do not seek to arm it with the\r\nweapons of strife; if it is to be the cement of society, do not vaunt it\r\nas the triumph of class against class.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_ (ingenuously).--\"You correct me nobly, sir. Knowledge is\r\npower, but not in the sense in which I have interpreted the saying.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Knowledge is _one_ of the powers in the moral world, but one\r\nthat, in its immediate result, is not always of the most worldly\r\nadvantage to the possessor. It is one of the slowest, because one of the\r\nmost durable, of agencies. It may take a thousand years for a thought to\r\ncome into power; and the thinker who originated it might have died in\r\nrags or in chains.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Our Italian proverb saith that 'the teacher is like the\r\ncandle, which lights others in consuming itself.'\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Therefore he who has the true ambition of knowledge should\r\nentertain it for the power of his idea, not for the power it may bestow\r\non himself; it should be lodged in the conscience, and, like the\r\nconscience, look for no certain reward on this side the grave. And since\r\nknowledge is compatible with good and with evil, would not it be better\r\nto say, 'Knowledge is a trust?'\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Leonard cheerfully; \"pray proceed.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"You ask me why we encourage you to KNOW. First, because (as\r\nyou say yourself in your Essay), knowledge, irrespective of gain, is in\r\nitself a delight, and ought to be something far more. Like liberty, like\r\nreligion, it may be abused; but I have no more right to say that the\r\npoor shall be ignorant, than I have to say that the rich only shall be\r\nfree, and that the clergy alone shall learn the truths of redemption.\r\nYou truly observe in your treatise that knowledge opens to us other\r\nexcitements than those of the senses, and another life than that of the\r\nmoment. The difference between us is this, that you forget that the same\r\nrefinement which brings us new pleasures exposes us to new pains--the\r\nhorny hand of the peasant feels not the nettles which sting the fine\r\nskin of the scholar. You forget also, that whatever widens the sphere of\r\nthe desires, opens to them also new temptations. Vanity, the desire of\r\napplause, pride, the sense of superiority--gnawing discontent where that\r\nsuperiority is not recognized--morbid susceptibility, which comes with\r\nall new feelings--the underrating of simple pleasures apart from the\r\nintellectual--the chase of the imagination, often unduly stimulated, for\r\nthings unattainable below--all these are surely amongst the first\r\ntemptations that beset the entrance into knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard shaded his face with his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Hence,\" continued the Parson, benignantly--\"hence, so far from\r\nconsidering that we do all that is needful to accomplish ourselves as\r\nmen, when we cultivate only the intellect, we should remember that we\r\nthereby continually increase the range of our desires, and therefore of\r\nour temptations; and we should endeavor, simultaneously, to cultivate\r\nboth those affections of the heart which prove the ignorant to be God's\r\nchildren no less than the wise, and those moral qualities which have\r\nmade men great and good when reading and writing were scarcely known: to\r\nwit, patience and fortitude under poverty and distress; humility and\r\nbeneficence amidst grandeur and wealth; and, in counteraction to that\r\negotism which all superiority, mental or worldly, is apt to inspire,\r\nJustice, the father of all the more solid virtues, softened by Charity,\r\nwhich is their loving mother. Thus accompanied, knowledge indeed becomes\r\nthe magnificent crown of humanity--not the imperious despot, but the\r\nchecked and tempered sovereign of the soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson paused, and Leonard, coming near him, timidly took his hand,\r\nwith a child's affectionate and grateful impulse.\r\n\r\n_Riccabacca._--\"And if, Leonard, you are not satisfied with our Parson's\r\nexcellent definitions, you have only to read what Lord Bacon himself has\r\nsaid upon the true ends of knowledge, to comprehend at once how angry\r\nthe poor great man, whom Mr. Dale treats so harshly, would have been\r\nwith those who have stinted his elaborate distinctions and provident\r\ncautions into that coxcombical little aphorism, and then misconstrued\r\nall he designed to prove in favor of the commandant, and authority of\r\nlearning. For,\" added the sage, looking up as a man does when he is\r\ntaxing his memory, \"I think it is thus that after saying the greatest\r\nerror of all is the mistaking or misplacing the end of knowledge, and\r\ndenouncing the various objects for which it is vulgarly sought;--I think\r\nit is thus that he proceeds.... 'Knowledge is not a shop for profit or\r\nsale, but a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator, and the relief\r\nof men's estate.'\"[L]\r\n\r\n_Parson_ (remorsefully)--\"Are those Lord Bacon's words? I am very sorry\r\nI spoke so uncharitably of his life. I must examine it again. I may find\r\nexcuses for it now that I could not when I first formed my judgment. I\r\nwas then a raw lad at Oxford. But I see, Leonard, there is still\r\nsomething on your mind.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"It is true, sir. I would but ask whether it is not by\r\nknowledge that we arrive at the qualities and virtues you so well\r\ndescribe, but which you seem to consider as coming to us through\r\nchannels apart from knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"If you mean by the word knowledge something very different\r\nfrom what you express in your essay, and which those contending for\r\nmental instruction, irrespective of religion and ethics, appear also to\r\nconvey by the word ---- you are right; but, remember, we have already\r\nagreed that by the word knowledge we mean culture purely intellectual.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"That is true--we so understood it.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Thus, when this great Lord Bacon erred, you may say that he\r\nerred from want of knowledge--the knowledge that moralists and preachers\r\nwould convey. But Lord Bacon had read all that moralists and preachers\r\ncould say on such matters; and he certainly did not err from want of\r\nintellectual cultivation. Let me here, my child, invite you to observe,\r\nthat He who knew most of our human hearts and our immortal destinies,\r\ndid not _insist_ on this intellectual culture as essential to the\r\nvirtues that form our well-being here, and conduce to our salvation\r\nhereafter. Had it been essential, the Allwise One would not have\r\nselected humble fishermen for the teachers of his doctrine, instead of\r\nculling his disciples from Roman portico or Athenian academy. And this,\r\nwhich distinguishes so remarkably the Gospel from the ethics of heathen\r\nphilosophy, wherein knowledge is declared to be necessary to virtue, is\r\na proof how slight was the heathen sage's insight into the nature of\r\nmankind, when compared with the Saviour's; for hard indeed would it be\r\nto men, whether high or low, rich or poor, if science and learning, or\r\ncontemplative philosophy, were the sole avenues to peace and redemption;\r\nsince, in this state of ordeal, requiring active duties, very few in any\r\nage, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, ever are or can be\r\ndevoted to pursuits merely mental. Christ does not represent heaven as a\r\ncollege for the learned. Therefore the rules of the Celestial Legislator\r\nare rendered clear to the simplest understanding as to the deepest.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"And that which Plato and Zeno, Pythagoras and Socrates,\r\ncould not do, was done by men whose ignorance would have been a by-word\r\nin the schools of the Greek. The gods of the vulgar were dethroned; the\r\nface of the world was changed! This thought may make us allow, indeed,\r\nthat there are agencies more powerful than mere knowledge, and ask,\r\nafter all, what is the mission which knowledge should achieve?\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"The Sacred Book tells us even that; for after establishing\r\nthe truth that, for the multitude, knowledge is not essential to\r\nhappiness and good, it accords still to knowledge its sublime part in\r\nthe revelation prepared and announced. When an instrument of more than\r\nordinary intelligence was required for a purpose divine--when the\r\nGospel, recorded by the simple, was to be explained by the acute,\r\nenforced by the energetic, carried home to the doubts of the\r\nGentile--the Supreme Will joined to the zeal of the earlier apostles the\r\nlearning and genius of St. Paul--not holier than the others--calling\r\nhimself the least, yet laboring more abundantly than them all--making\r\nhimself all things unto all men, so that some might be saved. The\r\nignorant may be saved no less surely than the wise; but here comes the\r\nwise man who helps to save! And how the fulness and animation of this\r\ngrand Presence, of this indomitable Energy, seem to vivify the toil, and\r\nto speed the work! 'In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils\r\nof robbers, in perils of mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen,\r\nin perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the\r\nsea, in perils amongst false brethren.' Behold, my son! does not Heaven\r\nhere seem to reveal the true type of knowledge--a sleepless activity, a\r\npervading agency, a dauntless heroism, an all-supporting faith? A\r\npower--a power indeed--a power apart from the aggrandizement of self--a\r\npower that brings to him who owns and transmits it but 'weariness and\r\npainfulness; in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings\r\noften, in cold and nakedness'--but a power distinct from the mere\r\ncircumstance of the man, rushing from him as rays from a sun--borne\r\nthrough the air, and clothing it with light--piercing under earth, and\r\ncalling forth the harvest! Worship not knowledge--worship not the sun, O\r\nmy child! Let the sun but proclaim the Creator; let the knowledge but\r\nillumine the worship!\"\r\n\r\nThe good man, overcome by his own earnestness, paused; his head drooped\r\non the young student's breast, and all three were long silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWhatever ridicule may be thrown upon Mr. Dale's dissertations by the wit\r\nof the enlightened, they had a considerable, and I think a beneficial,\r\neffect upon Leonard Fairfield--an effect which may perhaps create less\r\nsurprise, when the reader remembers that Leonard was unaccustomed to\r\nargument, and still retained many of the prejudices natural to his\r\nrustic breeding. Nay, he actually thought it possible that, as both\r\nRiccabocca and Mr. Dale were more than double his age, and had had\r\nopportunities not only of reading twice as many books, but of\r\ncontracting experience in wider ranges of life--he actually, I say,\r\nthought it possible that they might be better acquainted with the\r\nproperties and distinctions of knowledge than himself. At all events,\r\nthe Parson's words were so far well-timed, that they produced in Leonard\r\nvery much of that state of mind which Mr. Dale desired to effect, before\r\ncommunicating to him the startling intelligence that he was to visit\r\nrelations whom he had never seen, of whom he had heard but little, and\r\nthat it was at least possible that the result of that visit might be to\r\nopen to him greater facilities for instruction, and a higher degree in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWithout some such preparation, I fear that Leonard would have gone forth\r\ninto the world with an exaggerated notion of his own acquirements, and\r\nwith a notion yet more exaggerated as to the kind of power that such\r\nknowledge as he possessed would obtain for itself. As it was, when Mr.\r\nDale broke to him the news of the experimental journey before him,\r\ncautioning him against being over sanguine, Leonard received the\r\nintelligence with a serious meekness, and thoughts that were nobly\r\nsolemn.\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed on his visitors, he remained for some moments\r\nmotionless, and in deep meditation; then he unclosed the door, and stole\r\nforth. The night was already far advanced, the heavens were luminous\r\nwith all the host of stars. \"I think,\" said the student, referring, in\r\nlater life, to that crisis in his destiny--\"I think it was then, as I\r\nstood alone, yet surrounded by worlds so numberless, that I first felt\r\nthe distinction between _mind_ and _soul_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Riccabocca, as he parted company with Mr. Dale, \"whether\r\nyou think we should have given to Frank Hazeldean, on entering life, the\r\nsame lecture on the limits and ends of knowledge which we have bestowed\r\non Leonard Fairfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" quoth the Parson, with a touch of human conceit, \"I have\r\nridden on horseback, and I know that some horses should be guided by the\r\nbridle, and some should be urged by the spur.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said Riccabocca; \"you contrive to put every experience of\r\nyours to some use--even your journey on Mr. Hazeldean's pad. And I see\r\nnow why, in this little world of a village, you have picked up so\r\ngeneral an acquaintance with life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever read White's _Natural History of Selborne_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, and you will find that you need not go far to learn the habits\r\nof birds, and know the difference between a swallow and a swift. Learn\r\nthe difference in a village, and you know the difference wherever\r\nswallows and swifts skim the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swallows and swifts!--true; but men--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are with us all the year round--which is more than we can say of\r\nswallows and swifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dale,\" said Riccabocca, taking off his hat with great formality,\r\n\"if ever again I find myself in a dilemma, I will come to you instead of\r\nto Machiavelli.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the Parson, \"if I could but have a calm hour's talk with you\r\non the errors of the Papal relig--\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was off like a shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Mr. Dale had a long conversation with Mrs. Fairfield. At\r\nfirst, he found some difficulty in getting over her pride, and inducing\r\nher to accept overtures from parents who had so long slighted both\r\nLeonard and herself. And it would have been in vain to have put before\r\nthe good woman the worldly advantages which such overtures implied. But\r\nwhen Mr. Dale said, almost sternly, \"Your parents are old, your father\r\ninfirm; their least wish should be as binding to you as their command,\"\r\nthe Widow bowed her head, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"God bless them, sir, I was very sinful--'Honor your father and mother.'\r\nI'm no scollard, but I know the Commandments. Let Lenny go. But he'll\r\nsoon forget me, and mayhap he'll learn to be ashamed of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There I will trust him,\" said the Parson; and he contrived easily to\r\nreassure and soothe her.\r\n\r\nIt was not till all this was settled that Mr. Dale drew forth an\r\nunsealed letter, which Mr. Richard Avenel, taking his hint, had given to\r\nhim, as from Leonard's grandparents, and said,--\"This is for you, and it\r\ncontains an inclosure of some value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you read it, sir? As I said before, I'm no scollard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Leonard is, and he will read it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard returned home that evening, Mrs. Fairfield showed him the\r\nletter. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Jane,--Mr. Dale will tell you that we wish Leonard to\r\n     come to us. We are glad to hear you are well. We forward, by\r\n     Mr. Dale, a bank-note for £50, which comes from Richard, your\r\n     brother. So no more at present from your affectionate parents,\r\n\r\n    \"JOHN AND MARGARET AVENEL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter was in a stiff female scrawl, and Leonard observed that two\r\nor three mistakes in spelling had been corrected, either in another pen\r\nor in a different hand.\r\n\r\n\"Dear brother Dick, how good in him!\" cried the widow. \"When I saw there\r\nwas money, I thought it must be him. How I should like to see Dick\r\nagain. But I s'pose he's still in Amerikay. Well, well, this will buy\r\nclothes for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you must keep it all, mother, and put it in the Savings' Bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite so silly as that,\" cried Mrs. Fairfield, with contempt;\r\nand she put the fifty pounds into a cracked teapot.\r\n\r\n\"It must not stay there when I'm gone. You may be robbed, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, dear me, that's true. What shall I do with it?--what do I want\r\nwith it, too! Dear me! I wish they hadn't sent it. I shan't sleep in\r\npeace. You must e'en put it in your own pouch, and button it up tight,\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nLenny smiled, and took the note; but he took it to Mr. Dale, and begged\r\nhim to put it into the Savings' Bank for his mother.\r\n\r\nThe day following he went to take leave of his master, of Jackeymo, of\r\nthe fountain, the garden. But, after he had gone through the first of\r\nthese adieus with Jackeymo,--who, poor man, indulged in all the lively\r\ngesticulations of grief which make half the eloquence of his countrymen;\r\nand then, absolutely blubbering, hurried away--Leonard himself was so\r\naffected that he could not proceed at once to the house, but stood\r\nbeside the fountain, trying hard to keep back his tears.\r\n\r\n\"You, Leonard--and you are going!\" said a soft voice; and the tears fell\r\nfaster than ever, for he recognized the voice of Violante.\r\n\r\n\"Do not cry,\" continued the child, with a kind of tender gravity. \"You\r\nare going, but papa says it would be selfish in us to grieve, for it is\r\nfor your good; and we should be glad. But I am selfish, Leonard, and I\r\ndo grieve. I shall miss you sadly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, young lady--you miss me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I do not cry, Leonard, for I envy you, and I wish I were a\r\nboy: I wish I could do as you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl clasped her hands, and reared her slight form, with a kind of\r\npassionate dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Do as me, and part from all those you love!\"\r\n\r\n\"But to serve those you love. One day you will come back to your\r\nmother's cottage, and say, 'We have conquered fortune.' Oh that I could\r\ngo forth and return, as you will. But my father has no country, and his\r\nonly child is a useless girl.\"\r\n\r\nAs Violante spoke, Leonard had dried his tears; her emotion distracted\r\nhim from his own.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" continued Violante, again raising her head loftily, \"what it is to\r\nbe a man! A woman sighs, 'I wish,' but man should say, 'I will.'\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally before, Leonard had noted fitful flashes of a nature grand\r\nand heroic, in the Italian child, especially of late--flashes the more\r\nremarkable from their contrast to a form most exquisitely feminine, and\r\nto a sweetness of temper which made even her pride gentle. But now it\r\nseemed as if the child spoke with the command of a queen--almost with\r\nthe inspiration of a muse. A strange and new sense of courage entered\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n\"May I remember these words!\" he murmured half audibly.\r\n\r\nThe girl turned and surveyed him with eyes brighter for their moisture.\r\nShe then extended her hand to him, with a quick movement, and, as he\r\nbent over it, with a grace taught to him by genuine emotion, she\r\nsaid,--\"And if you do, then, girl and child as I am, I shall think I\r\nhave aided a brave heart in the great strife for honor!\"\r\n\r\nShe lingered a moment, smiled as if to herself, and then, gliding away,\r\nwas lost amongst the trees.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, in which Leonard recovered slowly from the surprise\r\nand agitation into which Violante had thrown his spirits--previously\r\nexcited as they were--he went, murmuring to himself, towards the house.\r\nBut Riccabocca was from home. Leonard turned mechanically to the\r\nterrace, and busied himself with the flowers. But the dark eyes of\r\nViolante shone on his thoughts, and her voice rang in his ear.\r\n\r\nAt length Riccabocca appeared, followed up the road by a laborer, who\r\ncarried something indistinct under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe Italian beckoned to Leonard to follow him into the parlor; and after\r\nconversing with him kindly, and at some length, and packing up, as it\r\nwere, a considerable provision of wisdom in the portable shape of\r\naphorisms and proverbs, the sage left him alone for a few moments.\r\nRiccabocca then returned with his wife, and bearing a small knapsack:--\r\n\r\n\"It is not much we can do for you, Leonard, and money is the worst gift\r\nin the world for a keepsake; but my wife and I have put our heads\r\ntogether to furnish you with a little outfit. Giacomo, who was in our\r\nsecret, assures us that the clothes will fit: and stole, I fancy, a coat\r\nof yours for the purpose. Put them on when you go to your relations: it\r\nis astonishing what a difference it makes in the ideas people form of\r\nus, according as our coats are cut one way or another. I should not be\r\npresentable in London thus; and nothing is more true than that a tailor\r\nis often the making of a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"The shirts, too, are very good holland,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca, about to\r\nopen the knapsack.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind details, my dear,\" cried the wise man; \"shirts are\r\ncomprehended in the general principle of clothes. And, Leonard, as a\r\nremembrance somewhat more personal, accept this, which I have worn many\r\na year when time was a thing of importance to me, and nobler fates than\r\nmine hung on a moment. We missed the moment, or abused it, and here I\r\nam, a waif on a foreign shore. Methinks I have done with Time.\"\r\n\r\nThe exile, as he thus spoke, placed in Leonard's reluctant hands a watch\r\nthat would have delighted an antiquary, and shocked a dandy. It was\r\nexceedingly thick, having an outer case of enamel, and an inner one of\r\ngold. The hands and the figures of the hours had originally been formed\r\nof brilliants; but the brilliants had long since vanished. Still, even\r\nthus bereft, the watch was much more in character with the giver than\r\nthe receiver, and was as little suited to Leonard as would have been the\r\nred silk umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"It is old-fashioned,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca, \"but it goes better than\r\nany clock in the country. I really think it will last to the end of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Carissima mia!_\" cried the Doctor, \"I thought I had convinced you that\r\nthe world is by no means come to its last legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not mean any thing, Alphonso,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca,\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\n\"And that is all we do mean when we talk about that of which we can know\r\nnothing,\" said the Doctor, less gallantly than usual, for he resented\r\nthat epithet of \"old-fashioned,\" as applied to the watch.\r\n\r\nLeonard, we see, had been silent all this time; he could not\r\nspeak--literally and truly, he could not speak. How he got out of his\r\nembarrassment, and how he got out of the room, he never explained to my\r\nsatisfaction. But, a few minutes afterwards, he was seen hurrying down\r\nthe road very briskly.\r\n\r\nRiccabocca and his wife stood at the window gazing after him.\r\n\r\n\"There is a depth in that boy's heart,\" said the sage, \"which might\r\nfloat an Argosy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor dear boy! I think we have put every thing into the knapsack that\r\nhe can possibly want,\" said good Mrs. Riccabocca musingly.\r\n\r\n_The Doctor_ (continuing his soliloquy).--\"They are strong, but they are\r\nnot immediately apparent.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Riccabocca_ (resuming hers.)--\"They are at the bottom of the\r\nknapsack.\"\r\n\r\n_The Doctor._--\"They will stand long wear and tear.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Riccabocca._--\"A year, at least, with proper care at the wash.\"\r\n\r\n_The Doctor_ (startled).--\"Care at the wash! What on earth are you\r\ntalking of, ma'am?\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Riccabocca_ (mildly).--\"The shirts, to be sure, my love? And you?\"\r\n\r\n_The Doctor_ (with a heavy sigh).--\"The feelings, ma'am!\" Then, after a\r\npause, taking his wife's hand affectionately--\"But you did quite right\r\nto think of the shirts; Mr. Dale said very truly--\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Riccabocca._--\"What?\"\r\n\r\n_The Doctor._--\"That there was a great deal in common between us--even\r\nwhen I think of feelings, and you but of--shirts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Avenel sat within the parlor--Mr. Richard stood on the\r\nhearth-rug, whistling Yankee Doodle. \"The Parson writes word that the\r\nlad will come to-day,\" said Richard suddenly--\"let me see the\r\nletter--ay, to-day. If he took the coach as far as ----, he might walk\r\nthe rest of the way in two or three hours. He should be pretty nearly\r\nhere. I have a great mind to go and meet him: it will save his asking\r\nquestions, and hearing about me. I can clear the town by the back-way,\r\nand get out at the high road.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll not know him from any one else said Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a good one! Not know an Avenel! We've all the same cut of\r\nthe jib--have not we, father?\"\r\n\r\nPoor John laughed heartily, till the tears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"We were always a well-favored family,\" said John, recomposing himself.\r\n\"There was Luke, but he's gone; and Harry, but he's dead too; and Dick,\r\nbut he's in Amerikay--no, he's here; and my darling Nora, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" interrupted Mrs. Avenel; \"hush, John!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at her, and then put his tremulous hand to his brow.\r\n\"And Nora's gone too!\" said he, in a voice of profound woe. Both hands\r\nthen fell on his knees, and his head drooped on his breast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel rose, kissed her husband on the forehead, and then walked\r\naway to the window. Richard took up his hat, and brushed the nap\r\ncarefully with his handkerchief; but his lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going,\" said he, abruptly. \"Now mind, mother, not a word about\r\nUncle Richard yet; we must first see how we like each other, and (in a\r\nwhisper) you'll try and get that into my poor father's head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Richard,\" said Mrs. Avenel, quietly. Richard put on his hat, and\r\nwent out by the back way. He stole along the fields that skirted the\r\ntown, and had only once to cross the street before he got into the high\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHe walked on until he came to the first milestone. There he seated\r\nhimself, lighted his cigar, and awaited his nephew. It was now nearly\r\nthe hour of sunset, and the road before him lay westward. Richard from\r\ntime to time looked along the road, shading his eyes with his hand; and\r\nat length, just as the disc of the sun had half sunk down the horizon, a\r\nsolitary figure came up the way. It emerged suddenly from the turn in\r\nthe road; the reddening beams colored all the atmosphere around it.\r\nSolitary and silent it came as from a Land of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\"You have been walking far, young man,\" said Richard Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, not very. That is Lansmere before me, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is Lansmere; you stop there, I guess?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard made a sign in the affirmative, and walked on a few paces; then\r\nseeing the stranger who had accosted him still by his side, he said--\r\n\r\n\"If you know the town, sir, perhaps you will have the goodness to tell\r\nme whereabouts Mr. Avenel lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can put you into a straight cut across the fields, that will bring\r\nyou just behind the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, but it will take you out of your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is in my way. So you are going to Mr. Avenel's?--a good old\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always heard so; and Mrs. Avenel--\"\r\n\r\n\"A particular superior woman,\" said Richard. \"Any one else to ask\r\nafter--I know the family well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a son, I believe; but he's in America, is not he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see the Parson has kept faith with me,\" muttered Richard.\r\n\r\n\"If you can tell me any thing about him,\" said Leonard, \"I should be\r\nvery glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, young man?--perhaps he is hanged by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a sad dog, I am told.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have been told very falsely,\" said Leonard, coloring.\r\n\r\n\"A sad wild dog--his parents were so glad when he cut and run--went off\r\nto the States. They say he made money; but, if so, he neglected his\r\nrelations shamefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Leonard, \"you are wholly misinformed. He has been most\r\ngenerous to a relative who had little claim on him; and I never heard\r\nhis name mentioned but with love and praise.\"\r\n\r\nRichard instantly fell to whistling Yankee Doodle, and walked on several\r\npaces without saying a word. He then made a slight apology for his\r\nimpertinence--hoped no offence--and with his usual bold but astute style\r\nof talk, contrived to bring out something of his companion's mind. He\r\nwas evidently struck with the clearness and propriety with which Leonard\r\nexpressed himself, raised his eyebrows in surprise more than once, and\r\nlooked him full in the face with an attentive and pleased survey.\r\nLeonard had put on the new clothes with which Riccabocca and wife had\r\nprovided him. They were those appropriate to a young country tradesman\r\nin good circumstances; but as he did not think about the clothes, so he\r\nhad unconsciously something of the ease of the gentleman.\r\n\r\nThey now came into the fields. Leonard paused before a slip of ground\r\nsown with rye.\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought grass land would have answered better, so near a\r\ntown,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it would,\" answered Richard; \"but they are sadly behind-hand\r\nin these parts. You see that great park yonder, on the other side of the\r\nroad? That would answer better for rye than grass; but then what would\r\nbecome of my Lord's deer? The aristocracy eat us up, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the aristocracy did not sow this piece with rye, I suppose?\" said\r\nLeonard, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you conclude from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let every man look to his own ground,\" said Leonard, with a cleverness\r\nof repartee caught from Doctor Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"'Cute lad you are,\" said Richard; \"and we'll talk more of these matters\r\nanother time.\"\r\n\r\nThey now came within sight of Mr. Avenel's house.\r\n\r\n\"You can get through the gap in the hedge, by the old pollard oak,\" said\r\nRichard; \"and come round by the front of the house. Why, you're not\r\nafraid--are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I introduce you? I told you that I knew the old couple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir! I would rather meet them alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go; and--wait a bit,--harkye, young man, Mrs. Avenel is a cold-mannered\r\nwoman; but don't be abashed by that.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard thanked the good-natured stranger, crossed the field, passed the\r\ngap, and paused a moment under the stinted shade of the old\r\nhollow-hearted oak. The ravens were returning to their nests. At the\r\nsight of a human form under the tree, they wheeled round, and watched\r\nhim afar. From the thick of the boughs, the young ravens sent their\r\nhoarse low cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThe young man entered the neat, prim, formal parlor.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome!\" said Mrs. Avenel, in a firm voice.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman is heartily welcome,\" cried poor John.\r\n\r\n\"It is your grandson, Leonard Fairfield,\" said Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\nBut John, who had risen with knocking knees, gazed hard at Leonard, and\r\nthen fell on his breast, sobbing aloud--\"Nora's eyes!--he has a blink in\r\nhis eyes like Nora's.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel approached with a steady step, and drew away the old man\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\n\"He is a poor creature,\" she whispered to Leonard--\"you excite him. Come\r\naway, I will show you your room.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard followed her up the stairs, and came into a room--neatly, and\r\neven prettily furnished. The carpet and curtains were faded by the sun,\r\nand of old-fashioned pattern, but there was a look about the room as if\r\nit had long been disused.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel sank down on the first chair on entering.\r\n\r\nLeonard drew his arm round her waist affectionately: \"I fear that I have\r\nput you out sadly--my dear grandmother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel glided hastily from his arm, and her countenance worked\r\nmuch--every nerve in it twitching as it were; then, placing her hand on\r\nhis locks, she said with passion, \"God bless you, my grandson,\" and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nLeonard dropped his knapsack on the floor, and looked around him\r\nwistfully. The room seemed as if it had once been occupied by a female.\r\nThere was a work-box on the chest of drawers, and over it hanging\r\nshelves for books, suspended by ribbons that had once been blue, with\r\nsilk and fringe appended to each shelf, and knots and tassels here and\r\nthere--the taste of a woman, or rather of a girl, who seeks to give a\r\ngrace to the commonest things around her. With the mechanical habit of a\r\nstudent, Leonard took down one or two of the volumes still left on the\r\nshelves. He found SPENSER'S _Fairy Queen_, RACINE in French, TASSO in\r\nItalian; and on the fly-leaf of each volume, in the exquisite\r\nhandwriting familiar to his memory, the name \"Leonora.\" He kissed the\r\nbooks, and replaced them with a feeling akin both to tenderness and awe.\r\n\r\nHe had not been alone in his room more than a quarter of an hour, before\r\nthe maid-servant knocked at his door and summoned him to tea.\r\n\r\nPoor John had recovered his spirits, and his wife sate by his side\r\nholding his hand in hers. Poor John was even gay. He asked many\r\nquestions about his daughter Jane, and did not wait for the answers.\r\nThen he spoke about the Squire, whom he confounded with Audley Egerton,\r\nand talked of elections and the Blue party, and hoped Leonard would\r\nalways be a good Blue; and then he fell to his tea and toast, and said\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel spoke little, but she eyed Leonard askant, as it were, from\r\ntime to time; and after each glance the nerves of the poor severe face\r\ntwitched again.\r\n\r\nA little after nine o'clock, Mrs. Avenel lighted a candle, and placing\r\nit in Leonard's hand, \"You must be tired--you know your own room now.\r\nGood night.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard took the light, and, as was his wont with his mother, kissed\r\nMrs. Avenel on the cheek. Then he took John's hand and kissed him too.\r\nThe old man was half asleep, and murmured dreamily, \"That's Nora.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard had retired to his room about half an hour, when Richard Avenel\r\nentered the house softly, and joined his parents.\r\n\r\n\"Well, mother?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Richard--you have seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"And like him. Do you know he has a great look of poor Nora?--more like\r\nher than Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he is handsomer than Jane ever was, but more like your father than\r\nany one. John was so comely. You take to the boy, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that I do. Just tell him in the morning that he is to go with a\r\ngentleman who will be his friend, and don't say more. The chaise shall\r\nbe at the door after breakfast. Let him get into it: I shall wait for\r\nhim out of the town. What's the room you give him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The room you would not take.\"\r\n\r\n\"The room in which Nora slept? Oh, no! I could not have slept a wink\r\nthere. What a charm there was in that girl!--how we all loved her! But\r\nshe was too beautiful and good for us--too good to live!\"\r\n\r\n\"None of us are too good,\" said Mrs. Avenel with great austerity, \"and I\r\nbeg you will not talk in that way. Good night--I must get your poor\r\nfather to bed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard opened his eyes the next morning, they rested on the face\r\nof Mrs. Avenel, which was bending over his pillow. But it was long\r\nbefore he could recognize that countenance, so changed was its\r\nexpression--so tender, so motherlike. Nay, the face of his own mother\r\nhad never seemed to him so soft with a mother's passion.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he murmured, half rising and flinging his young arms round her\r\nneck. Mrs. Avenel, this time, and for the first, taken by surprise,\r\nwarmly returned the embrace; she clasped him to her breast, she kissed\r\nhim again and again. At length with a quick start she escaped, and\r\nwalked up and down the room, pressing her hands tightly together. When\r\nshe halted, her face had recovered its usual severity and cold\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for you to rise, Leonard,\" said she. \"You will leave us\r\nto-day. A gentleman has promised to take charge of you, and do for you\r\nmore than we can. A chaise will be at the door soon--make haste.\"\r\n\r\nJohn was absent from the breakfast-table. His wife said that he never\r\nrose till late, and must not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe meal was scarce over, before a chaise and pair came to the door.\r\n\r\n\"You must not keep the chaise waiting--the gentleman is very punctual.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he has walked on before, and will get in after you are out of the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name, and why should he care for me, grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will tell you himself. Now, come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will bless me again, grandmother? I love you already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do bless you,\" said Mrs. Avenel firmly. \"Be honest and good, and\r\nbeware of the first false step.\" She pressed his hand with a convulsive\r\ngrasp, and led him to the outer door.\r\n\r\nThe postboy clanked his whip, the chaise rattled off. Leonard put his\r\nhead out of the window to catch a last glimpse of the old woman. But the\r\nboughs of the pollard oak, and its gnarled decaying trunk, hid her from\r\nhis eye. And look as he would, till the road turned, he saw but the\r\nmelancholy tree.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] This aphorism has been probably assigned to Lord Bacon upon the mere\r\nauthority of the index to his works. It is the aphorism of the\r\nindex-maker, certainly not of the great master of inductive philosophy.\r\nBacon has, it is true, repeatedly dwelt on the power of knowledge, but\r\nwith so many explanations and distinctions, that nothing could be more\r\nunjust to his general meaning than to attempt to cramp into a sentence\r\nwhat it costs him a volume to define. Thus, if in one page he appears to\r\nconfound knowledge with power, in another he sets them in the strongest\r\nantithesis to each other; as follows, \"Adeo, signanter Deus opera\r\npotentiæ et sapientiæ discriminavit.\" But it would be as unfair to Bacon\r\nto convert into an aphorism the sentence that discriminates between\r\nknowledge and power as it is to convert into an aphorism any sentence\r\nthat confounds them.\r\n\r\n[L] \"But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or\r\nmisplacing of the last or farthest end of knowledge:--for men have\r\nentered into a desire of learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a\r\nnatural curiosity and inquisitive appetite: sometimes to entertain their\r\nminds with variety and delight; sometimes for ornament and reputation;\r\nand sometimes to enable them to victory of wit and contradiction; and\r\nmost times for lucre and profession,\"--(that is, for most of those\r\nobjects which are meant by the ordinary citers of the saying, 'Knowledge\r\nis power;') \"and seldom sincerely to give a true account of these gifts\r\nof reason to the benefit and use of men; as if there were sought in\r\nknowledge a couch whereon to rest a searching and restless spirit; or a\r\nterrace for a wandering and variable mind to walk up and down, with a\r\nfair prospect; or a tower of state for a proud mind to raise itself\r\nupon; or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention; or a\r\nshop for profit or sale--and not a rich storehouse for the glory of the\r\nCreator, and the relief of men's estate.\"--ADVANCEMEMT OF LEARNING, Book\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the new novel, \"Rose Douglass.\"\r\n\r\nA FAMILY OF OLD MAIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a family of old maids! The youngest mistress was forty, and the two\r\nservants were somewhat older. They had each their pets too, except I\r\nthink the eldest, who was the clearest-headed of the family. The\r\nservants had the same Christian name, which was rather perplexing, as\r\nneither would consent to be called by her surname. How their mistresses\r\nmanaged to distinguish them I do not recollect; but the country people\r\nsettled it easily amongst themselves by early naming them according to\r\ntheir different heights, \"lang Jenny,\" and \"little Jenny.\" They were\r\ncharacters in their way as well as their mistresses. They had served\r\nthem for upwards of twenty years, and knew every secret of the family,\r\nbeing as regularly consulted as any of the members of it. They regulated\r\nthe expenses too, much as they liked, which was in a very frugal,\r\neconomical manner. The two Jennies had not much relished their removal\r\nto the country, and still often sighed with regret for the gossipings\r\nthey once enjoyed in the Castlegate of Lanark. But they could not bear\r\nto part from the family; so they now boomed at their wheels or mended\r\nthe household linen in the damp dull kitchen of Burnside, instead of\r\nperforming the same work in their old cosy, comfortable one in the burgh\r\ntown, and tried to indemnify themselves for their privations by\r\nestablishing a kind of patronizing familiarity with various of the\r\ncottagers' wives.\r\n\r\nMiss Jess and Miss Jean were the names of the younger ladies. There was\r\nthat species of resemblance among all the sisters, both mental and\r\npersonal, which is often to be observed in members of the same family.\r\nMenie, the eldest sister, was, however, much superior to the others in\r\nforce of character, but her mind had not been cultivated by reading.\r\nJess, the second, was a large coarse-looking woman, with a masculine\r\nvoice, and tastes decidedly so. An excellent wright or smith she would\r\nhave made, if unfortunately she had not been born a gentlewoman. She had\r\na habit of wandering about the grounds with a small hammer and nails in\r\nher huge pocket, examining the fences, and mending them if necessary.\r\nShe could pick a lock too, when needed, with great neatness and\r\ndispatch. I rather think she could repair one also. I have still in my\r\npossession a small box of her making, which, for execution and\r\ndurability, I will match against the performance of any rival amateur of\r\nthe opposite sex. In spite, however, of such freaks, and as if to make\r\namends for them, Miss Jess possessed one of the softest and most\r\nimpressionable hearts which ever fell to the lot of a mature maiden of\r\nforty-five. She had suffered from no less than six different attachments\r\nduring her life (she made me her confidante), and most unfortunately\r\nthey had never been to the right individual, for they were not returned.\r\nBut poor Miss Jess cherished no malice; she freely forgave them their\r\ninsensibility. Indeed, she had not the heart to kill a fly. Every beggar\r\nimposed on her, and her sisters were obliged for her own sake to\r\nrestrain her charities. Her dress, like her pursuits, had always a\r\ncertain masculine air about it. She wore large rough boots, coarse\r\ngloves, and a kind of man's cravat constantly twisted about her neck\r\nwhen out of doors. In short, she was one of those persons one cannot\r\nhelp liking, yet laughing at. Jean, the youngest sister, had been a\r\nbeauty in her time, and she still laid claim to the distinction\r\nresulting from it. It was a pity, considering the susceptibility of her\r\nsecond sister, that her charms had not been shared by her. Jean was\r\ncoquettish, and affected a somewhat youthful manner and style of dress,\r\nwhich contrasted ill with her time of life. But the rest of the family,\r\nin which of course I include the servants, evidently considered her a\r\nyoung thoughtless thing for whom much allowance must be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical Review of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the Executive Session of the Senate and the departure\r\nof the members for their homes, Washington has relapsed into the usual\r\nquiet of its summer season. Mr. Corwin, Secretary of the Treasury, has\r\nbeen dangerously ill, but is now slowly recovering. The duties of the\r\noffice were temporarily performed by the Chief Clerk of the Department.\r\nSeñor Molina, Chargé to the United States from the Central American\r\nState of Costa Rica, has presented his credentials to the President. M.\r\nBois le Comte, the French Minister Plenipotentiary, having been\r\nsuperseded by the appointment of M. de Sartiges, has sold his furniture\r\nand gone to Havana. A public dinner was given to Mr. Webster at\r\nAnnapolis, Maryland, on the 24th of March, by the Delegates of the\r\nMaryland State Convention. It was attended by a large number of\r\ndistinguished persons. Mr. Webster then proceeded to Harrisburgh, where\r\nhe had been invited by the Legislature of Pennsylvania. A grand\r\nreception was given him in the Hall of the House of Representatives.\r\nGov. Johnson introduced the distinguished guest in a brief address of\r\nwelcome, to which Mr. Webster responded in a speech of an hour's length.\r\nHe spoke of the commanding physical position of Pennsylvania, forming,\r\nas it were, the key-stone between the North and the South, the waters of\r\nthe Atlantic and the Mississippi. Occupying, thus, a middle ground\r\nbetween the two conflicting portions of the Union, he considered her\r\ndisposed to do her duty to both, regardless of the suggestions of local\r\nprejudices. He then pronounced a most glowing and eloquent eulogium on\r\nthe Constitution, and concluded by affirming his belief that ages hence\r\nthe United States will be free and republican, still making constant\r\nprogress in general confidence, respect, and prosperity. Mr. Webster is\r\nat present on his Marshfield estate, recovering from an indisposition\r\nconsequent on his labors during the past winter.\r\n\r\nThe State Convention of Ohio has framed a new Constitution, which is to\r\nbe submitted to the people for acceptance. It provides for the\r\nmaintenance of religious freedom, equality of political rights, liberty\r\nof speech and of the press, and no imprisonment for debt. The members of\r\neach branch of the Legislature are chosen biennially. The Governor,\r\nLieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, and Attorney\r\nGeneral, are to be chosen by the people for a term of two years, and the\r\nJudges for a term of five years. The Legislature is to provide a system\r\nof Free Education, and Institutions for the Insane, Blind, Deaf and Dumb\r\nare to be supported by the State. The Ohio Legislature has passed\r\nresolutions in favor of the repeal or modification of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, principally on account of its denial of a trial by jury to the\r\nfugitive.\r\n\r\nThe Union feeling is entirely in the ascendant throughout the Southern\r\nStates. A Committee of the Virginia Legislature, to whom the resolutions\r\nof the South Carolina Convention were referred, reported a preamble and\r\nseries of resolutions of the most patriotic character. They declare that\r\nwhile Virginia deeply sympathizes with South Carolina, she cannot join\r\nin any action calculated to impair the integrity of the Union. She\r\nbelieves the Constitution sufficient for the remedy of all grievances,\r\nand invokes all who live under it to adhere more strictly to it, and to\r\npreserve inviolate its safeguards. Virginia also declines to send\r\nDelegates to the proposed Southern Congress. In Georgia, a number of\r\nDelegates have been elected to a State Convention of the Union party for\r\nthe nomination of a Candidate for Governor. The State Convention of\r\nMissouri has adopted an address and resolutions fully sustaining Mr.\r\nBenton in his course in opposition to the Disunionists. In Mississippi,\r\nthe Union party have taken measures for a thorough organization.\r\nDelegates have been chosen to a State Convention for the nomination of a\r\nticket. The Southern party are about forming a similar organization, the\r\nold party lines having been almost entirely abandoned. The only\r\ncounter-movement in the North, is the assembling of a State Convention\r\nin Massachusetts, in opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law, without\r\ndistinction of party. In Tennessee, the friends of the Free School\r\nSystem have called a General State Convention, to be held at Knoxville.\r\nThe New-Jersey Legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the employment\r\nof children under ten years of age in factories, and providing that ten\r\nhours shall be considered a legal day's labor in all manufacturing\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Election in Rhode Island resulted in the choice of Philip\r\nAllen, the Democratic Candidate for Governor, by 600 majority. The\r\nLegislature stands--Senate, 14 Democrats and 13 Whigs; Assembly, 31\r\nDemocrats and 25 Whigs. The Election in Connecticut gave the following\r\nreturns for the next Legislature: Senate, 13 Whigs and 8 Democrats;\r\nLegislature 113 Whigs and 110 Democrats. As the election of Governor\r\nfalls upon the Legislature, the probability is that the Governor and the\r\nUnited States Senator for the next six years will be chosen from the\r\nWhig party. The Legislature of New-York paid a visit to the cities of\r\nNew-York and Brooklyn, about the end of March. They remained four days,\r\nduring which time they visited all the charitable institutions on the\r\nisland, in company with the city authorities. This is the first instance\r\non record of an official visit of the Legislature to the commercial\r\nmetropolis of the State.\r\n\r\nBoston has been the theatre of some disturbing and exciting proceedings,\r\ngrowing out of the anti-slavery feeling of a portion of the community. A\r\nfugitive slave named Sims, who had escaped from Savannah, and had been\r\nin Boston about a month, was arrested by the Deputy United States\r\nMarshal, at the instance of an agent of the owner. On being taken, he\r\ndrew a knife and inflicted a severe wound on one of the officers in\r\nattendance. An abolitionist lawyer, who attempted to interfere, was\r\narrested and sent to the watch-house. Fletcher Webster, Esq., son of the\r\nSecretary of State, was also seized and taken to jail, on account of\r\nhaving attempted to prevent a watchman from ringing the bell of King's\r\nChapel, under the supposition that it was a trick of the Abolitionists\r\nto collect a mob. The next day, this sect called a meeting on Boston\r\nCommon, which was largely attended. Rev. Theodore Parker, Wendell\r\nPhillips, and other speakers, addressed the meeting, urging instant and\r\narmed resistance to the operation of the law. The Police, on the other\r\nhand, took every precaution to prevent a forcible rescue of the\r\nprisoner. The Court-House, in which he was confined, was surrounded by\r\nchains to keep off the crowd, and guarded by a strong force; several\r\nmilitary companies were also kept in readiness. The friends of the\r\nfugitive endeavored to make use of the case for the purpose of testing\r\nthe constitutionality of the law, and a hearing was had before the\r\nUnited States Commissioner, in which the question was argued at length.\r\nIn order to prevent the delivery of Sims, a complaint was instituted for\r\nassault and battery with intent to kill the officer who arrested him.\r\nChief Justice Shaw, of the Supreme Court, however, decided that a writ\r\nof habeas corpus could not be granted, and the United States\r\nCommissioner having, from the evidence adduced, remanded Sims to the\r\nkeeping of his claimant, authority was given to take him back to\r\nSavannah. As an assault was feared from the abolitionists and colored\r\npeople in Boston, the brig Acorn was chartered to proceed to Savannah,\r\nand Sims taken on board, in custody of the United States Deputy Marshal\r\nand several police officers. A large number of persons offered their\r\nservices in case any attack should be made. A large crowd collected on\r\nthe wharf as the party embarked, and a clergyman present knelt down and\r\npronounced a prayer for the rescue of the fugitive. No open act of\r\nviolence was committed, and after laying a day off Nantasket Beach, the\r\nschooner proceeded on her way to Savannah.\r\n\r\nThe Equinoctial storm, this spring, commenced on the 16th of March, and\r\nraged for three days with unusual violence. It was severely felt along\r\nthe Atlantic coast, and did much damage to the shipping. Amin Bey, the\r\nTurkish Envoy to the United States, sailed from Boston on the 9th of\r\nApril, on his return to Constantinople. The election of a United States\r\nSenator by the Massachusetts Legislature has twice again been tried,\r\nunsuccessfully. On the last ballot, Mr. Sumner lacked 12 votes of an\r\nelection. It was then further postponed to the 23d of April. The census\r\nof Virginia has been completed, showing an aggregate population of\r\n1,421,081, about 473,000 of whom are slaves. At the last accounts Jenny\r\nLind was in Cincinnati, after having given two very successful concerts\r\nin Nashville and two in Louisville. She has also paid a visit to the\r\nMammoth Cave. Several large crevasses have broken out on the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and another overflow of the plantations is threatened.\r\n\r\nThe latest mails from Texas bring us little news beyond the continuance\r\nof Indian depredations on the frontier. Several American outlaws, who\r\nhad crossed the Rio Grande for the purposes of plunder, were captured by\r\nthe Mexicans and executed. Major Bartlett, the United States Boundary\r\nCommissioner, arrived at San Antonio from El Paso, on the 17th of March,\r\nwith a train of fifty wagons. He immediately proceeded to New Orleans\r\nfor the purpose of arranging for the transmission of supplies. Four\r\npersons, who were concerned in the murder of Mr. Clark and others, at a\r\nsmall village near El Paso, have been captured, convicted by a jury\r\nsummoned on the instant, and hung. The Boundary Commissioners have at\r\nlast agreed on the starting point of the survey, which will secure to\r\nthe United States a much larger and more valuable tract of territory\r\nthan was anticipated. The point established is the intersection of the\r\nparallel of 32° with the Rio Grande, which is about 18 miles north of El\r\nPaso. From this place the line runs due west till it strikes some branch\r\nof the Gila, or if no branch is met, to the point nearest the Gila\r\nRiver, whence it runs due north to the river. It is ascertained that the\r\nonly branch of the Gila which this line can strike is about one hundred\r\nand fifty miles west of the gold and copper mines, leaving that rich\r\nmineral region within the United States. This boundary lies to the south\r\nof the old limits of New Mexico, and takes in a large region that has\r\nalways belonged to the State of Chihuahua.\r\n\r\nWe have accounts from Santa Fe to the 17th of February. The winter had\r\nbeen unusually mild, and the prospects of the spring trade were very\r\nfavorable. The United States Marshal had completed the census of the\r\nTerritory. The total population is 61,574, of whom only 650 are\r\nAmericans. Of the Mexicans over 21 years of age, only one in 103 is able\r\nto read. The number of square miles in the Territory is 199,027-1/2. The\r\ndepredations of the Indians are on the increase. The tribes have become\r\nbolder than ever, and the amount of stock driven off by them, is\r\nenormous. Great preparations are making at Fort Laramie, on the Platte,\r\nand all the other stations on the overland route, to accommodate the\r\nsummer emigration. A substantial bridge has been built over the North\r\nFork of the Platte, 100 miles above Fort Laramie. Here, also,\r\nblacksmith's shops have been erected to accommodate those who need\r\nrepairs to their wagons.\r\n\r\nTwo mails and about $3,000,000 in gold dust have arrived from California\r\nduring the past month. The accounts from San Francisco are to the 5th of\r\nMarch. The Joint Convention of the Legislature, which assembled on the\r\n17th of February for the purpose of choosing a United States Senator,\r\nadjourned till the first day of January next, after one hundred and\r\nforty-four ineffectual ballots. On the last ballot, the Hon. T. Butler\r\nKing, the Whig candidate, had twenty votes, lacking four of an election;\r\nCol. Fremont nine, and Col. Weller eighteen. Another Legislature is to\r\nbe elected before the next session. The bonds offered by Gen. Vallejo\r\nhave been accepted, so that nothing but their fulfilment remains to\r\nsecure the seat of government for the yet unbuilt city.\r\n\r\nThe weather still continued to be remarkably dry and mild, owing to\r\nwhich cause, the miners were doing less than usual, and business was\r\nconsequently dull. In many localities, the miners, after waiting in vain\r\nfor showers enough to enable them to wash out their piles of dirt, set\r\nthemselves to work at constructing races to lead off the mountain\r\nstreams. In some places mountains have been tunneled to divert the water\r\ninto the desired channels. The yield of gold, wherever mining can be\r\ndiligently carried on, has in nowise diminished, and new placers of\r\nremarkable richness are announced as having been discovered on the Yuba,\r\nFeather, Scott and Klamath Rivers, and in the neighborhood of Monterey,\r\nLos Angeles and San Diego. Veins of gold in quartz are far more abundant\r\nand of richer character than was anticipated; several companies have\r\nbeen formed for working them with machinery. Dredging-machines, attached\r\nto steamboats, have also been introduced on the Yuba River, the bed of\r\nwhich has been dug up and washed out in some places, with much success.\r\nThe excitement in relation to the Gold Bluff is over. Several vessels\r\nhave returned filled with disappointed adventurers. The black sand on\r\nthe beach contains a large quantity of gold, but in particles so fine as\r\nto prevent its being separated by the ordinary process of washing. On\r\nPitt River, the principal affluent of the Upper Sacramento, a hill of\r\npure carbonate of magnesia, 100 feet high, has been discovered. Large\r\nmasses are easily detached, and thousands of wagons could be loaded with\r\nvery little labor.\r\n\r\nThe Indian hostilities have not yet ceased. After the taking of the\r\nstronghold on Fresno Creek, Major Burney and Mr. Savage returned to\r\nMariposa for provisions. They raised a force of 150 men, which they\r\ndivided into two parties, one of which met the Indians on San Joaquin\r\nRiver, when a running fight ensued that lasted all day. The Indians were\r\ndriven off, after the loss of forty men. The Legislature has passed a\r\nlaw authorizing a loan of $500,000 for the purpose of prosecuting the\r\nwar, but upon such terms that it is doubtful whether the money can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe condition of society in California shows an alarming tendency among\r\nthe people to take the law into their own hands. The papers ascribe this\r\nstate of things to the imperfect and corrupt manner in which the\r\nofficers of the law have discharged their functions. Acts of violence\r\nand crime are frequent in all parts of the country, and the mining\r\ncommunities, with few exceptions, administer summary punishment wherever\r\nthe offender is captured. Sacramento City has been the scene of a case\r\nof this kind, where the people, having no confidence in the ordinary\r\nprocess of the law, took the avenging power in their own hands. A\r\ngambler named Roe having shot an inoffensive miner, an immense crowd\r\nassembled around the guard-house where he was kept, a jury of the\r\ncitizens was chosen, witnesses summoned, and the case formally\r\ninvestigated. The jury decided that Roe was guilty of the act, and\r\nremanded him for trial. This, however, did not satisfy the crowd, who\r\nclamored for instant punishment, and finally succeeded in forcing the\r\ndoors of the jail and overcoming the officers. The prisoner was hurried\r\nforth, amid the shouts and execrations of the multitude, a scaffold was\r\nerected, and at nine o'clock the same evening he was hung, with the\r\nceremonies usually observed. An attempt at lynching was made in San\r\nFrancisco about the same time. Two ruffians, having attempted to rob and\r\nmurder a merchant of that city, the people assembled on the plaza and\r\ndemanded an instant trial, with the understanding that if found guilty,\r\nthe prisoners should be immediately hung. An examination was held, but\r\nthe jury could not agree, after which the accused were given into the\r\ncharge of the regular tribunal.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate catastrophe occurred in the Bay of San Francisco, on the\r\n4th of March. The steamer Santa Clara, lying at Central Wharf, took\r\nfire, which communicated to the steamer Hartford, lying near, and to the\r\nrigging of several vessels. The latter boat was considerably damaged\r\nbefore the conflagration could be extinguished; the Santa Clara was\r\nentirely destroyed. She was the first steamboat ever built in San\r\nFrancisco, and was running on the line between that port and Stockton.\r\nThe loss by the fire was about $90,000.\r\n\r\nNews from Oregon to the 1st of March state that the Legislature had\r\nadjourned, having established the seat of Government at Salem, in\r\nMaryland county, the Penitentiary at Portland, in Washington county, and\r\nthe University at Marysville, in Benton county. The Governor, however,\r\nhad refused to sign this act. The agricultural prospects, both of\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, are very flattering. During the past winter a\r\ngreat deal of land has been broken up and planted, and the fields\r\npromise abundant harvests.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial crisis in ENGLAND terminated on the 3d of March by the\r\nrecall of the Russell Cabinet, entire and unchanged. In making this\r\nannouncement in the House of Commons, Lord John Russell stated that a\r\ncoalition between himself and the party of Sir James Graham and Lord\r\nAberdeen was impossible, on account of the refusal of the latter to\r\nconsent to the Papal Aggression Bill. In returning to power, however,\r\nthe whigs brought up this bill in a modified and milder form. The\r\nsituation of the ministry was hardly less precarious than before their\r\nresignation. They were again defeated in the Commons, on a motion to\r\nreform the administration of the woods and forests, 120 voting for the\r\nreform, and 119 voting with the ministers against it. The Papal\r\nAggression Bill has been the cause of several exciting debates in the\r\nHouse of Commons, Mr. Drummond, an ultra Protestant member, created\r\nquite a disturbance by ridiculing the relics which have lately been\r\ndisplayed in various parts of the Continent. At the latest dates the\r\nbill had passed to a second reading by a vote of 438 to 95, the radical\r\nmembers voting in the minority. The fate of the bill is still far from\r\nbeing decided; the ministry are weak, and it is predicted that the\r\nCabinet will not last longer than the session of Parliament. Lord John\r\nRussell has brought in a bill reforming the administration of the Court\r\nof Chancery, but the new budget, which has been looked for with a great\r\ndeal of interest, has not yet made its appearance. During the debate on\r\nthe Papal Aggression Bill, Mr. Berkley Craven demanded legal\r\ninterference in the case of his step-daughter, the Hon. Miss Talbot,\r\nwho, being an heiress in her own right to eighty thousand pounds, had\r\nbeen prevailed upon to enter a convent for the purpose of taking the\r\nveil. As the ceremony was to be performed before she had attained her\r\nmajority, this sum would in all probability go to the funds of the\r\nCatholic Church. The statement of this case produced a strong sensation\r\nthroughout England, and added to the violent excitement on the Catholic\r\nQuestion.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the World's Fair are going on with great energy,\r\nworkmen being employed, day and night in finishing the building and\r\narranging the goods. The severest tests have been used to try the\r\nstrength of the galleries, which sustained an immense weight without the\r\nleast deflection. In rainy weather the roof leaks in places, a defect\r\nwhich it has been found almost impossible to remedy. Several changes\r\nhave been made in the exhibition regulations, to which the American\r\ndelegates in London take exceptions, and they have appointed a Committee\r\nto confer with the Commissioners on the subject. A splendid dinner was\r\ngiven to Macready, the actor, on the 1st of March, on the occasion of\r\nhis retirement from the stage. Sir E. Bulwer Lytton presided, and\r\nspeeches were made by Charles Dickens, Chevalier Bunsen, Mr. Thackeray,\r\nand others. Three hundred Hungarian exiles recently arrived at\r\nLiverpool, from Constantinople, on their way to the United States. A\r\nlarge number of them, of Polish origin, preferred remaining in England,\r\nto wait a new revolution on the Continent. A terrible accident took\r\nplace at a coal-pit near Paisley, in Scotland. Sixty-three men and boys\r\nwere at work when an explosion took place, supposed to have been caused\r\nby fire-damp. Of the whole number in the pit but two were rescued alive.\r\n\r\nThe third anniversary of the Republic was celebrated in FRANCE with\r\nimposing ceremonies. During the Carnival week, however, the people in\r\nvarious localities chose to hang the President in effigy, and utter\r\nsocialist cries. For these offences arrests were made in more than fifty\r\ntowns. These facts, with the suspension of Michelet as Professor of\r\nHistory in the College of France, because his lectures were considered\r\ntoo democratic, denote an unquiet state of things in the Republic. As\r\nthe term of Louis Napoleon approaches its termination, the position of\r\nparties becomes more nervous and uncertain. In the Assembly, the\r\nproposition of M. Creton to take into consideration the abolition of the\r\nlaw exiling the Orleans family, brought on the most violent debate of\r\nthe session. The adherents of the Mountain were strongly in favor of\r\ncontinuing the exile. Negotiations have been carried on for some time\r\npast between the Orleanists and the Legitimists, and early in March it\r\nwas announced that an alliance had been effected, the Orleanists to\r\nacknowledge the right of precedence of the Count de Chambord, (Henri\r\nV.,) who, in his turn, was to proclaim the young Count of Paris as his\r\nsuccessor. The Count de Chambord was at this time dangerously ill, and\r\nhis recovery was scarcely hoped for. Since then it appears that there is\r\nmuch confusion between the two parties, the duchess of Orleans refusing\r\nto set aside the claims of her son, on any consideration whatever. The\r\nparty of Louis Napoleon are intriguing to prolong the presidential term,\r\nand it is said that in this they will be joined by the Orleanists. No\r\npermanent ministry has yet been organized. It is rumored that Odillon\r\nBarrot refused to accept the principal place, which was tendered to him,\r\nunless Louis Napoleon would agree to leave his office at the end of his\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nA quarrel has broken out in the French Catholic Church. Some time ago\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris issued a pastoral letter, recommending the\r\nclergy to avoid engaging in political agitations, and appearing to the\r\nworld as party men. The letter was mild but decisive in its tone, and\r\nmet with general approval. Lately, the Bishop of Chartres has published\r\na sort of counter-blast, in the shape of a pastoral to his own clergy,\r\nwritten in the most severe and denunciatory forms. This letter he\r\nordered to be published in the religious journals of Paris; and the\r\nArchbishop has referred the matter to the Provincial Council, which will\r\nbe called this year.\r\n\r\nGERMANY is still pursuing her ignis-fatuus of Unity, which is no nearer\r\nthan when she first set out. The Dresden Conference is still in session,\r\nand up to the 20th of March had not adopted any plan of a Federal Diet.\r\nIt is almost impossible to conjecture what will be the basis of the\r\nsettlement. More than twenty of the smaller states protested against the\r\nplans proposed by Austria; and Prussia, assuming the character of\r\nprotector, refused to allow their further arrangement. The King of\r\nPrussia also refuses to accede to an agreement which his delegates had\r\nmade, allowing Austria to bring her non-German provinces to the\r\nconfederacy. In this he is sustained by Russia, who would not willingly\r\nsee the former country restored to virtual independence by the supremacy\r\nwhich this plan would give her. A return to the old Diet is spoken of in\r\nsome quarters, but perhaps the most likely result will be the concession\r\nof the presidency to Austria, on the part of Prussia. A meeting between\r\nthe ministers of the two countries is contemplated. The entire\r\npopulation of Prussia, by the census taken last year, is 16,331,000. A\r\nfire in Berlin has destroyed the building in which the Upper House of\r\nParliament held its meetings.\r\n\r\nThe old order reigns in HESSE-CASSEL, Baron Haynau having issued a\r\nproclamation to the Hessian army, in which he declares that _he_ is the\r\nConstitution, and will crush under foot the \"God-abandoned, pernicious\r\ngang, which threatens the welfare of the State.\" Nevertheless, the\r\npopular feeling remains unchanged. Lately, the citizens of Cassel were\r\nforbidden to shout or make any demonstration, on the return of a\r\nregiment which had been marked by the Government for its sympathy with\r\nthe popular cause. The people preserved silence, but adroitly expressed\r\ntheir feelings by chalking the word \"Hurrah!\" in large letters on the\r\nbacks of their coats and walking in front of the regiment. The\r\nGovernment of SWITZERLAND has at last yielded to the demands of Austria\r\nand Prussia, and authorized the Cantons to refuse shelter to political\r\nrefugees. Those already there may be expelled, should the Cantons see\r\nfit. After the insurrection in Baden, the refugees who entered the Swiss\r\nterritory, amounted to about 11,000, but they have so decreased by\r\nemigration to England and America, that at present there are but 482\r\nremaining. The Government of Switzerland lately endeavored to procure\r\npassage through Piedmont for some Austrian deserters from the army in\r\nLombardy, who wished to sail from Genoa for Montevideo; but the\r\nPiedmontese Government refused to allow it.\r\n\r\nITALY is fermenting with the elements of revolution. The bandits, who\r\nhave been committing such depredations in the Roman States, are not\r\nrobbers, it now appears, but revolutionary bands. Their extermination is\r\nalmost impossible, on account of the secrecy and adroitness with which\r\nthe peasants are enrolled into the service of their chief, Il Passatore.\r\nThey only meet at a general rendezvous, when some important expedition\r\nis contemplated, and afterwards return to their own avocations. They\r\nreceive regular pay from the moment of their enlistment, and as the\r\nlinks of the organization extend over a wide extent of country, the\r\nsystem must require a considerable amount of money. It is conjectured\r\nthat this band is the preparative of a political revolution, instigated\r\nby the agents of Mazzini. In Lombardy the most severe restrictions have\r\nbeen issued by Radetsky. An interdict has been laid upon a hat of\r\nparticular form, and a republican song in favor of Mazzini. The\r\npopulace, however, inserted the name of Radetsky in place of the\r\ntriumvir, and now sing the song with impunity. A plot has been\r\ndiscovered among the aristocratic party of Piedmont, to deliver the\r\ncountry into the hands of the Absolutists. The army of the kingdom is to\r\nbe put upon a war footing. Washington's birthday was celebrated in Rome,\r\nwith interesting ceremonies. About one hundred Americans met in the\r\nPalazzo Poli, where they partook of a splendid banquet, at which Mr.\r\nCass, the U. S. Chargé, presided.\r\n\r\nIn NORWAY the Thirteenth _Storthing_, or National Assembly, has been\r\nopened by King Oscar. In his speech, he spoke of the tranquillity which\r\nthe Scandinavian Peninsula had enjoyed, while the other nations of\r\nEurope had been convulsed with revolutions, and warned the people\r\nagainst delusive theories and ideas which lead only to discontent with\r\nexisting relations. He also recommended the construction of a railroad\r\nfrom the city of Christiana to Lake Mjösen. Several serious riots have\r\ntaken place in Stockholm, and Drontheim, in Norway. On February 14th,\r\nthe students of the University of Upsala, to the number of 500, paraded\r\nthe streets of Stockholm, and were not dispersed till a collision took\r\nplace between them and the police. The same scenes were renewed next\r\nday, when the students were joined by the people; the streets were\r\ncleared by squadrons of cavalry, and the principal rioters arrested.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between TURKEY and EGYPT is still far from being settled.\r\nAbbas Pacha, however, is not at present in a condition to come to an\r\nopen rupture with the Sublime Porte, and these differences will probably\r\nbe quietly settled. The Pacha is also involved in a dispute with the\r\nFrench Consul-General, in relation to the claims of certain French\r\nofficers, who were dismissed from the Egyptian service before the\r\nexpiration of their terms. Late advices from Constantinople state that a\r\ndefinite arrangement has been made with regard to the Hungarian\r\nrefugees. The Emperor of Austria has granted a full amnesty to all\r\nexcept eight, among whom are Kossuth and Bathyany, on condition that\r\nthey shall make no attempt to return to Hungary. The eight proscribed\r\npersons are to remain at Kutahya until further orders. General\r\nDembinski had reached Constantinople, where he was well received, and\r\nwould shortly leave for Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nAn interesting election has just been held in the county of Haldimand,\r\nCanada West, to supply a vacancy in the Canadian Parliament, occasioned\r\nby the death of David Thompson, Esq. There were four candidates, one of\r\nwhom was the noted William Lyon Mackenzie, leader of the Rebellion of\r\n1837. The election resulted in the choice of Mackenzie, who, after an\r\nexile of twelve years, resumes his seat in the Legislative Assembly. The\r\nGovernment had previously recognized his claim for $1,000, with\r\ninterest, for services rendered antecedent to the rebellion. The\r\nannexation feeling is reviving in some portions of Lower Canada. At a\r\npublic meeting recently held in the county of Huntingdon, several of the\r\nspeakers expressed themselves very strongly in favor of annexation to\r\nthe United States. The Catholic clergy oppose the movement. One of the\r\nleading Canadian politicians has drawn up a scheme of Federal Union for\r\nthe British Provinces, including the Hudson's Bay Company's Territories,\r\nmodelled on the federal system of the United States. The Canadian\r\nGovernment recently had under consideration the expediency of closing\r\nthe Welland Canal against American vessels, on account of the refusal of\r\nthe United States Government to adopt reciprocity measures. This course,\r\nwhich would seriously injure our commercial interests on the Lakes, has\r\nnot yet been pursued, and the Government will probably abandon the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Gen. Arista is still a subject of much interest\r\nand some curiosity. According to the representations of his friends, he\r\nis about to take a firm stand in the accomplishment of his leading\r\nmeasures; while, on the other hand, he is charged with weakness and\r\nsubjection to the influence of irresponsible favorites. Our latest\r\naccounts from the Mexican capital predict that the Government will soon\r\nbe in a state of great embarrassment. The American indemnity money was\r\nnearly spent, and there was already a deficiency of near $2,000,000 in\r\nthe Treasury. In consequence of the many robberies recently committed in\r\nand around the city of Mexico and on the road to Vera Cruz, the most\r\nstringent measures have been adopted for the preservation of order.\r\nCongress is still in session, but has made no modification in the Tariff\r\nbill, as was anticipated. It is feared that the Tehuantepec Railroad\r\nTreaty will be rejected, notwithstanding that Arista is known to be\r\nstrongly in its favor. The exclusive privilege of a railroad from Vera\r\nCruz to Medellin, has been granted for one hundred years to Don José\r\nMaria Estera.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary difficulties in the State of Oaxaca, have not yet been\r\nsettled. A treaty was made not long since, between Muñoz, the Governor\r\nof the State, and the rebel, Melendez, which gave great offence to the\r\npeople. In order to reinstate himself in their favor, Muñoz pretended\r\nthat the treaty had been violated on the part of Melendez, marched\r\nagainst him, and drove him and his followers into the mountains of\r\nChimalapa, where he has since remained concealed. The Tehuantepec\r\nSurveying Expedition is now encamped at La Ventosa, a port on the\r\nPacific. The route of the Railroad across the mountains has not yet been\r\ndecided upon, the survey being a matter of difficulty on account of the\r\ndense forests with which the country is covered.\r\n\r\nIn YUCATAN, the war between the Spanish and Indian races is raging with\r\ngreat ferocity. The Indians, who are supplied with arms and ammunition\r\nby the English at Belize, have advanced to within thirty miles of\r\nMerida, where a line of defence has been established by the Spaniards.\r\nFourteen thousand soldiers are there opposed to more than twenty\r\nthousand Indians, and the subjugation of the latter, without help from\r\nabroad, is impossible. The troops of Yucatan are destitute of clothing\r\nand supplies, and as most of the wealthy citizens of the State have been\r\nreduced to beggary by these reverses, the threatened extermination of\r\nthe Spanish race seems near at hand. A conspiracy to burn the city of\r\nMerida, formed by some of the soldiers, in conjunction with the convicts\r\nin the city prison, was discovered but a short time before it was to\r\nhave been carried into effect. The conspirators were condemned to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe hostilities between Guatemala on the one hand and the States of\r\nHonduras and San Salvador on the other, have been temporarily suspended,\r\nsince the defeat of the latter States. The armies met at a little\r\nvillage called La Arada. The battle lasted four hours, when the allied\r\narmy, commanded by Vasconcelos, President of San Salvador, was\r\ncompletely routed, with a loss of 500 men. His arrival at the capital\r\nwas the occasion of a riot among the lower classes, and he did not\r\nimmediately resume his executive functions. Carrera in the mean time\r\nadvanced to Santa Anna, thirty miles from the frontier, where he made\r\npropositions for peace. The provisional President of San Salvador\r\nreplied that no negotiations could take place until the troops were\r\nwithdrawn from the territory. This was done, but at the last accounts no\r\ntreaty had been made. The President of the National Diet of Central\r\nAmerica has issued a proclamation demanding the cessation of\r\nhostilities. The blockade of the port of Amapala, in Honduras, has been\r\nabandoned by the British fleet. Three iron steamers, intended for the\r\nnavigation of the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua, are now building in\r\nWilmington, Delaware, and will be placed upon the route on the 1st of\r\nJuly, at which time the line will be complete, and steamships will leave\r\nNew-York and San Francisco direct for Central America. The journey from\r\nsea to sea will be made in about twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nThe Island of CUBA is at present in an excited state on account of\r\nrumors that another piratical expedition was being fitted out in the\r\nUnited States, the vessels of which were to rendezvous at Apalachicola\r\nBay. This was at first looked upon as entirely groundless, but letters\r\nfrom Georgia and Alabama have since partially confirmed the statement.\r\nThere is an active force of 25,000 men on the island, and any attempt at\r\ninvasion will be unsuccessful. The Captain-General, Concha, continues\r\nhis course of reform, abolishing all useless restrictions, and\r\nestablishing needful regulations, so far as his power extends. The\r\nVenezuelan Consul at Havana has been discharged from his functions, and\r\nordered to leave the island in eight days, in consequence of having\r\nfurnished money to Gen. Lopez, with whom he is connected by marriage.\r\nMr. Clay, during his stay on the island, was honored with every\r\nexpression of respect.\r\n\r\nIn HAYTI, the efforts of the American, English, and French Consuls have\r\nthus far succeeded in preventing a war between the Haytiens and the\r\nDominicans. A commission of four persons has been appointed to confer\r\nwith the Consuls in regard to this subject. Several of the Dominican\r\nchiefs have arrived at Port-au-Prince, where they were very kindly\r\nreceived, and it was believed that peace will be speedily established. A\r\npolitical conspiracy has been detected at Port-au-Prince. Among the\r\npersons concerned in it was the late Chief Justice, M. Francisque, and\r\none of the three ministers of Soulouque. A large number of arrests were\r\nmade, and the prisoners tried by court-martial. Eight of them, including\r\nthe Chief Justice, were condemned and publicly shot.\r\n\r\nThe cholera has not yet wholly disappeared from JAMAICA. The budget for\r\nthe island estimates the liabilities at £248,300, and the income at\r\n£215,850, leaving a deficiency in the revenue of £32,450.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThere are now about 900 persons employed on the Panama Railroad, and the\r\ntrack to Gatun, a distance of twenty-six miles, will be ready for the\r\nlocomotive by the 1st of July next. There was much excitement on the\r\nIsthmus towards the close of March, caused by a report that the specie\r\ntrain, carrying $1,000,000 in silver for the British steamer, had been\r\nattacked by robbers. It happened, however, that only a single mule-load\r\nwas taken, which was afterwards abandoned by the robbers and recovered.\r\nThree of the boatmen arrested for the murder of passengers on the\r\nChagres River have been found guilty and sentenced to be shot. A large\r\nfire broke out on the island of Taboga, in the bay of Panama, destroying\r\nfifty huts, and property to the amount of $50,000. Several parties have\r\nreturned to Panama from the gold region of Choco, in New Grenada. They\r\nfound the rivers of the region abounding in rich gold-washings, but were\r\nforced to abandon the enterprise from want of supplies.\r\n\r\nIn CHILI, the 12th of February, the anniversary of Chilian independence,\r\nwas celebrated with imposing ceremonies. The municipality of Valparaiso\r\nare making exertions to establish a general system of primary\r\ninstruction for the children of the city. The survey of the railroad to\r\nSantiago has been carried about fifty miles, to which distance a\r\nfavorable line has been obtained. The island of Chilöe, in the southern\r\npart of the Republic, was suffering from a protracted drought. The\r\nelection for President was to take place in the month of March.\r\n\r\nIn BUENOS AYRES, the opening of the Legislature and the Annual Message\r\nof the President have been postponed by mutual agreement. The financial\r\naffairs of the republic are in an exceedingly prosperous condition, the\r\navailable resources on hand for the present year amounting to more than\r\n$36,000,000. By order of the government, the civil and military officers\r\nwere directed to wear the customary mourning on the 24th of January, \"as\r\na token of grief for the death and respect for the memory of the\r\nillustrious General Zachary Taylor, late President of the United States\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\nA terrible accident occurred in the harbor of Rio Janeiro on the 8th of\r\nFebruary. The French schooner Eliza, while at anchor near the fort, with\r\na large quantity of gunpowder on board, blew up with a tremendous\r\nexplosion, and soon after sank. She had 240 passengers, only a few of\r\nwhom were on board at the time. Ten were killed and twenty wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA.\r\n\r\nIn BRITISH INDIA, a portion of the Nizam's territory has been made over\r\nto the East India Company, as an equivalent for a debt of £60,000 due to\r\nit. Lord Dalhousie is engaged in introducing a system of education into\r\nthe Punjaub. The Sikhs warmly second him in his endeavors. The English\r\nauthorities are also engaged in constructing 350 miles of canal in this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nLate news from CHINA confirms the intelligence of the death of\r\nCommissioner Lin. Key-ing, the former Commissioner, has been disgraced,\r\non account of his liberal course towards the Europeans. A system of\r\nsmuggling, on a very extensive scale, has been discovered in the\r\nneighborhood of Shanghai. It is announced that a race of Jews has been\r\ndiscovered by some agents of the London Missionary Society in the\r\ninterior of China, about 350 miles beyond Pekin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICA.\r\n\r\nA fierce and devastating war has broken out at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nbetween the British Colonists and the native tribe of the Kaffirs. The\r\nsavages arose in large bands and commenced a general attack on all the\r\nfarms along the frontier. The native servants of the settlers joined\r\nthem, and they had penetrated into the older and more thickly populated\r\ndistricts on the coast, before they received any check from the\r\nGovernment forces. Several battles have taken place, in which the\r\nKaffirs were generally routed, but they are a brave and warlike race,\r\nand cannot be subdued without a stronger force than has yet been sent\r\nagainst them. In the Beaufort and Fort Cradock districts, the country\r\nfor the distance of 150 miles was abandoned, the homesteads burnt, and\r\nthe stock driven off. At the latest dates, the Governor, Sir Harry\r\nSmith, was raising a force of 10,000 men.\r\n\r\nWe have news from LIBERIA to the 23d of January. At a late trial for a\r\ncapital offence in Monrovia, several native Africans sat on the jury.\r\nOther natives hold commissions as policemen and other minor\r\nfunctionaries. Bassa Cove, on the coast, had been very unhealthy for\r\nsome months.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYNESIA.\r\n\r\nSome difficulty has arisen at the Sandwich Islands, between the\r\ncommander of the French frigate Sérieuse and the Hawaiian Government.\r\nThe French commander demanded the payment of $25,000 as a commutation\r\nfor customs alleged to have been collected contrary to treaty\r\nobligations. The King refused to accede to this claim, and threw himself\r\non the protection of Great Britain and the United States. Upon this the\r\nFrench commander landed his men at Honolulu, where he has prevented\r\nseveral Hawaiian vessels from proceeding to sea.\r\n\r\nSeveral different parties of exploration are now endeavoring to\r\npenetrate into the interior of the African continent. Mr. Livingston, at\r\nthe last accounts, was proceeding northward from Lake Ngami. Dr. Beke,\r\nin Abyssinia, and the Rev. Mr. Thompson, on the Gaboon River, have also\r\nmade some very interesting discoveries in African geography and natural\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Record of Scientific Discovery._\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MOTORS.--Sir JOHN SCOTT LILLIE, Companion of the Bath, of Paris, has\r\njust received an English patent for improvements in the application of\r\nmotive powers. One of these improvements consists in directing currents\r\nof air, or other gaseous fluids, through inverted troughs or channels,\r\nfor the propulsion of boats and barges in the conveyance of goods and\r\npassengers. The troughs are placed longitudinally, one on each side of\r\nthe vessel; or one may be placed between two vessels having one deck.\r\nTheir form may be either square or oblong; and they are left open so\r\nthat the currents of air in their passage to, and escape at or near, the\r\nstern of the vessel, may act upon the water, until they pass off into\r\nthe air. They are supplied by air through a shaft, passing vertically\r\nthrough the centre of the deck. Another of the improvements consists in\r\nsuspending paddle-wheels at or near the stern of the vessel, which are\r\nset in motion by the action of the currents as they pass off into the\r\nair, thereby increasing the motive power; or such paddle-wheels may be\r\nmoved without the intervention of the troughs or channels, by the motion\r\nof currents of air or other gaseous fluids, forced through tubes or\r\ncylinders. The patent was enrolled in the early part of March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWATER GAS.--The English patent for Paine's Light was enrolled on the\r\n12th of December, in the name of Alfred Vincent Newton, of Chancery\r\nLane, Middlesex. The _London Patent Journal_ publishes the\r\nspecifications and figures, remarking that the report has been ready for\r\nsome time, but was not published at the particular request of the\r\nassignee of the patent in England. It states that the invention is for\r\ndecomposing water by means of electricity, and producing therefrom a\r\ngas, which, after being made to pass through spirits of turpentine or\r\nother hydro-carbonous fluids, will, when ignited, burn with great\r\nbrilliancy. The invention is known by the name of \"Paine's Light\"--this\r\nbeing, in fact, Mr. Paine's specification, in which he states, that\r\nalthough water has been spoken of as decomposed by the electric\r\ncurrents, he wishes it to be understood that this is merely to accord\r\nwith the generally received chemical doctrines and phraseology, and that\r\nwater, after all, may be a simple element; however that may be, the\r\npatentee wishes, at present, to lay it down as certain that by\r\ndischarging electricity through water, large quantities of gases are\r\nevolved; and that one of such gases, at least, when passed through\r\nturpentine, in the manner described, will burn and give a highly\r\nilluminating light. Mr. Paine's affairs in England being thus adjusted,\r\nit is possible that more will be heard of it on this side. The benefits\r\nof the invention are hid under a bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN THE STEAM-ENGINE.--An English patent has been granted to\r\nMr. GEORGE SMITH, of Manchester, engineer, for four improvements upon\r\nthe steam-engine. The first is an improved arrangement of apparatus by\r\nwhich cold water is made to enter the exhaust passages of steam\r\ncylinders, as near the valves as possible; by condensing a portion of\r\nthe exhausted steam it becomes hot and then passes off, while the\r\nuncondensed steam passes either into the condenser or the atmosphere.\r\nThis improvement is applicable to marine, stationary, and locomotive\r\nengines. The second improvement consists in an improved apparatus\r\napplied to low-pressure boilers, by which the water in the boiler is\r\nmaintained at a regular height, and by which the danger of explosions\r\nfrom deficiency of water is removed. The third, consists of hot and cold\r\nwater pumps, and is also applicable to air-pumps and lifting-pumps. The\r\nfourth is in the construction of metallic packing of pistons for steam\r\ncylinders, air-pumps, and other similar pistons, by which greater\r\nstrength and elasticity are obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEW APPLICATIONS OF ZINC AND ITS OXIDES.--Mr. WILLIAM EDWARD NORTON has\r\nobtained a patent in England for improvements in obtaining, preparing\r\nand applying zinc and other volatile metals, and their oxides, and in\r\nthe application of zinc, to the preparation of certain metals, and\r\nalloys of metals. The improvements are six in number; consisting of an\r\nimproved furnace for the preparation of zinc and its white oxide, with\r\nnew forms of front and rear walls--a mode of dispensing with the common\r\nretorts for the reduction of the ores of zinc into oxides, and replacing\r\nthem by one large retort, in which the ore is more advantageously\r\ntreated--the application of zinc to the alloy of iron and steel, which\r\nare thereby rendered more malleable and less liable to oxidation--a\r\nsaving of the products of distillation and oxidation of zinc and other\r\nvolatile metals, by means of a cotton, woollen, flaxen, or other similar\r\nfabric, in connection with a suitable exhausting apparatus,--the\r\napplication of zinc to the formation of pigments,--and, lastly, the\r\napplication of the ore called Franklinite to the reduction of iron from\r\nits ores, and its subsequent purification, and in saving the volatile\r\nproducts by means of a suitable condensing or receiving apparatus.\r\nFranklinite, which has hitherto only been found in any quantity near the\r\nFranklin forge, Sussex county, in the State of New Jersey, consists of\r\nthe following substances, according to Berthier and Thomson: Peroxide of\r\niron, 66; oxide of zinc, 17; sesqui-oxide of manganese, 16; total, 99.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new adaptation of _Lithography_ to the process of printing in oil has\r\nlately been invented by M. Kronheim of Paternoster-row, London. Hitherto\r\nno strictly mechanical means have existed for successfully producing\r\ncopies of paintings, combining the colors and brilliant effects as well\r\nas the outlines and shadings of the original. The ingenious invention of\r\nMr. Kronheim, while it enables him to supply copies of the great masters\r\nwonderfully accurate in every respect, reduces the cost of such copies\r\nto one-half the price of steel-engravings, and is a far more expeditious\r\nprocess. The invention has reduced to a certainty the practice of a new\r\nprocess by which the appreciation of art may be more widely extended,\r\nand the works of great artists popularized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUAL OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, (published in Boston by Gould and\r\nLincoln), is an excellent abstract of all the chief movements and\r\ndiscoveries in the scientific world for the year 1850. We advise all our\r\nreaders interested in any of the sciences to procure it, and its\r\ncompanion volume for the previous year. The work will be continued, and\r\nit will be invaluable as a library of facts and suggestions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOXYGEN FROM ATMOSPHERIC AIR.--M. BOUSSINGAULT has recently obtained some\r\ninteresting results from his investigations in relation to oxygen. The\r\nproblem upon which he has been engaged was the extraction of oxygen gas,\r\nin a state of purity and in a considerable quantity, from the azote in\r\nthe atmosphere. For this purpose, a preference was given to baryte,\r\nowing to its property of remaining in oxygen of a moderate temperature,\r\nand abandoning it under the influence of a heat sufficiently intense.\r\nTen kilogrammes of baryte, completely oxidized, were found able to take\r\nand afterward return 730 litres of gas. This is the number indicated by\r\ntheory; for celerity of operation, more than 600 litres can be counted\r\non. In that limit, and in operating on 100 kilos. of matter, 6,000\r\nlitres of oxygen gas might be disengaged at each disoxidization; four or\r\nfive operations might be performed in 24 hours, which would thus furnish\r\nfrom 24,000 to 30,000 litres of gas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the virtues of a _Whitened Camera for Photography_,\r\nannounced in our last issue, has excited a remarkable sensation in\r\nEngland. Mr. Kilburn, photographer to the Queen, who has experimented\r\nupon the new plan with great success, is sparring with M. Claudet. The\r\npoint in dispute is the tendency of the improved method to weaken the\r\nimage. If the statements of those who claim to have succeeded are\r\nreliable, it is evident that the ordinary form of camera may be\r\nabandoned, and any image be received directly from the lens upon plates\r\nor paper exposed to a diffused light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. LABORDE states, in a paper on Photography read before the Paris\r\nSociety for the Encouragement of Arts, that the nitrate of zinc may be\r\nsubstituted for acetic acid in the preparation of photographs on paper;\r\nthat it increases the sensitiveness of the silver coating, and even\r\nallows an alkaline reaction to the iodide of potassium bath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA paper was lately read by Professor ABICH, before the Geographical\r\nSociety of London, on the _Climate of the Country between the Black and\r\nCaspian Seas_. Professor Abich noticed the outlines of the extraordinary\r\nvariety of climate in the lands between these bodies of water, and\r\nsketched the geological and orological structure of the country, which\r\nhe has minutely examined for several years by order of the Russian\r\nGovernment. The whole tract is divided by three different lines of\r\nelevation--viz. that of S. E. to N. W.--that of W. to E., and that of S.\r\nW. to N. E. The isothermal line of 57° and 59°, after traversing the\r\ncountry between the Black and the Caspian Seas, inflects abruptly toward\r\nthe South again, reaching the Caspian. The mean temperature along the\r\nshores of the two seas is for the year about equal; but the difference\r\nof the temperature of the seasons is very great. Lenkoran, in the same\r\nlatitude as Palermo and Smyrna, with an annual temperature of 61° and\r\n63°, has the summer of Montpellier 76°, and the winter of Maestricht and\r\nTurin, 35°. In Calchis, there is the winter of the British Isles, 41°\r\nand 42°, and the summer of Constantinople, 72° and 73°. Tiflis, with the\r\nwinter of Padua, 37°, has the summer of Madrid and Naples, 74°. The\r\nextremes of Asiatic climate are found on the volcanic highlands of\r\nArmenia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences at Paris has recently heard a report on certain\r\nexplorations made in 1847-8-9 by M. Rochet d'Hericourt, a traveller in\r\nnorth-eastern Africa. This traveller has, by repeated observations,\r\ndetermined the latitude of Mt. Sinai to be 28° 33' 16\", of Suez 29° 57'\r\n58\", of Devratabor 11° 51' 12\", and of Gondar 12° 36' 1\". Mt. Sinai is\r\n1978 metres (about 6500 feet) high. Mt. Dieu 2174 metres (7200 feet),\r\nand the highest of the Horch Mountains 2477 metres (8100 feet). The Lake\r\nof Frana, south of Gondar, is 1750 metres (5700 feet) below the level of\r\nthe sea, and its depth in one place is 197 metres (645 feet).\r\nRar-Bonahite, the highest peak in Abyssinia, is 4330 metres (14,200\r\nfeet) high, but not high enough to have snow. The traveller describes a\r\ngreat variety of hot-springs, some of which contained living fish an\r\ninch long. The geology of Abyssinia he has thoroughly investigated. In\r\nthe north, the principal rocks are granite and syenite. Among the plants\r\nhe describes is a magnificent lobelia, almost large enough to be called\r\na tree, which is found to the very summits of the mountains, and to a\r\nheight which would not be supposed to admit of such a growth. He also\r\nfinds the plant whose root has been found to be a specific against\r\nhydrophobia. Of this he brought back seeds, which have been planted in\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes with success. A peculiar breed of sheep M. Rochet\r\nd'Hericourt thought worthy of being transferred to France, but of the\r\npair he sent the female died on the route. This sheep has a very long\r\nand silky fleece. On the shores of Lake Frana he also found a very large\r\nsort of spiders, whose cocoons, he said, were converted into excellent\r\nsilk. He thinks these spiders might be brought to Europe, and employed\r\nin producing silk, but in this he probably does not enough consider the\r\ndifficulty, or rather the impossibility, of domesticating and feeding\r\nthese insects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnormous fossil eggs were found a few weeks since subjects of curious\r\ndiscussion in Paris, and several notices were translated for the\r\nNew-York papers. The eggs were discovered in Madagascar. M. Isodore\r\nGeoffrey St. Hilliare, in a recent report to the _Academie des\r\nSciences_, furnished further details; and three eggs and some bones\r\nbelonging to a gigantic bird, which have been presented to the Museum of\r\nNatural History in Paris, would seem to leave no room for doubt. Fairy\r\ntales are daily thrown into shade by the authentic records of science.\r\nThis discovery appears to have been stumbled on curiously enough. The\r\ncaptain of a merchant vessel trading to Madagascar noticed one day a\r\nnative who was using for domestic purposes a vase which much resembled\r\nan enormous egg, and on questioning him was informed that many such were\r\nto be found in the interior of the island. The largest of these eggs\r\nwould hold two gallons. The volume equals that of 135 hen's eggs. Some\r\ndoubts were at first entertained as to the nature of the animal to which\r\nthe fossil bones belonged; but M. St Hilliare--a competent judge in such\r\nmatters--has pronounced them to be those of a bird to which he has given\r\nthe name of _Epiornis_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sum of £1000 has been placed by the British Government at the\r\ndisposal of the _Royal Institution_, for scientific purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the PARIS ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (first meeting in March), M. Leverrier\r\nsubmitted a communication from Mr. W. C. Bond, entitled Observations on\r\nthe Comet of Faye, made at the Observatory of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r\nEvery thing is prized that comes from that quarter. M. Boussingault, the\r\nscientific agriculturist, read an extract from his memoir on the\r\nextraction of oxygen gas from atmospheric air. His undertaking was to\r\nextract, in a state of purity and in considerable quantity, the oxygen\r\ngas mixed with azote in atmospheric air, and he thinks that he has fully\r\nsucceeded, by a process not attended with much difficulty. He details\r\nsome unexpected results from his experiments. Cauchy made profound\r\nreports (from committees) respecting the _Researches on Algebraic\r\nFunctions_ by M. Puiseux, and the studies of Crystallography by M.\r\nBravais. Papers on the speed of sound in iron, and on respiration in\r\nplants, and new schemes of atmospheric railroads were submitted.\r\nAttention was given to M. Burg's new observations concerning the\r\nadvantageous use to be made of metallic bands in various nervous\r\ndisorders in which the ordinary therapeutic expedients are found\r\nineffectual. M. Peligot mentioned a memoir which he was soon to put\r\nforth as a sequel to the Researches on the nature and properties of the\r\ndifferent Sugars, which he published in 1838. He has succeeded in\r\nextracting, by means of lime, the crystallizable sugar, in large\r\nquantity, contained in molasses. He got twenty-five per cent., by the\r\nagency of lime, carbonic acid, or sulphuric acid. Lime is cheap and\r\nharmless. Other circumstances recommend his series of experiments. A\r\nscientific reporter writes mysteriously of the discovery of a very\r\nsimple and easy method of extracting sugar from the beet-root; with an\r\napparatus which costs very little, any one may make his sugar with as\r\nmuch facility as he boils his pot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the EXPEDITION TO CENTRAL AFRICA, we learn from the _Athenæum_ that\r\nletters from Dr. Barth and Dr. Overweg have been received in London by\r\nChevalier Bunsen, by which it appears that up to October last the\r\ntravellers were still detained in the kingdom of Aïr. A previous\r\ncommunication gave an account of difficulties and dangers which they had\r\nmet with on entering that country; the inhabitants of which had shown\r\nthemselves hostile to them, so that their fate seemed entirely to depend\r\non the protection of the Prince En-Nur, sultan of the Kelvës. This\r\nhoped-for protection they have been fortunate enough to secure; though\r\nit appears not to have been sufficient to insure their safety beyond\r\nTin-Tellus, the residence of the Prince, in consequence of which they\r\nhave been obliged to forego the exploration of the country, and to\r\nremain with the Prince. They have however been enabled, while thus\r\nstationary, to collect a good deal of oral information,--especially\r\nrespecting the tract of country to the west and southwest of Ghat:\r\nwhich, instead of being a monotonous desert, proves to be intersected by\r\nmany fertile wadys with plenty of water. Among these novel features, not\r\nthe least interesting is a lake, between Ghat and Tuat, infested with\r\ncrocodiles. At the date of Dr. Barth's letter (2d of October) the\r\ntravellers were on the point of setting out on an excursion to Aghades,\r\nthe capital of Aïr; the new sultan having promised them his protection,\r\nand the valiant son-in-law of En-Nur accompanying them on their\r\njourney. The latitude of Tin-Tellus has been found to be 18° 34' N.; the\r\nlongitude has not been finally determined. The rainy season lasts till\r\nSeptember, and thunder-storms occur daily in the afternoon between two\r\nand three o'clock, accompanied by a west wind, while at other times it\r\nblows from the east. It seems yet uncertain when the expedition will be\r\nable to start for lake Tchad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEN. RADOWITZ, the late Minister of Prussian Affairs in Prussia, and\r\nundeniably one of the most brilliant Germans now living, recently\r\nappeared with great success in the character of a philologist before the\r\nAcademy of Useful Sciences at Erfurt. A much larger audience than usual\r\npresent, drawn thither by the oratorical reputation of the General, who\r\nwas announced to deliver an essay on the Development of the Celtic Race\r\nin England, and especially in Wales. Great was the astonishment, when,\r\ninstead of the usual thick manuscript, the General drew forth a single\r\nsheet containing his notes, and proceeded to speak from it for above an\r\nhour. He dwelt with pride on the fact that a German (Dr. Meyer, the\r\nprivate secretary of Prince Albert) had cast a reconciling light on the\r\nlong contest between English and Erse archæologists. He then said there\r\nhad been two Celtic immigrations, an eastern and a western. The latter\r\nwas the more ancient and important; its route was through Syria,\r\nNorthern Africa, and Spain, to England, where it appeared in three\r\nphases, one under _Alv_, whence the name of the country Albion (_ion_, a\r\ncircle, an isolated thing, an island); another under _Edin_, whence\r\n_Edinburgh_, in old documents _Car Edin_ (_Car_ Breton, _Ker_ burgh, as\r\nin Carnaervon, Carmarthen, &c.); and the third under _Pryd_, whence\r\n_Britain_ (_ain--ion_). Such etymologic analyses marked this brilliant\r\ndiscourse. _Fingal_ he derived from _fin_ fair, and _gal_ a stranger,\r\nand proved the affinity between the _Gauls_ and _Gael_, the later word\r\nmeaning vassal, while Gaul comes from _gal_. In the second part of his\r\nessay he demonstrated that the Celts were the inventors of rhyme, and in\r\nthe discussion which followed maintained this position against several\r\ndistinguished philologists who were present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. CAGNIARD LATOUR has brought to the notice of the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences a process for making artificial coal, by putting different\r\nwoods in a closed tube, and slowly charring them over burning charcoal.\r\nThe coal varies in character according to the age and hygrometric state\r\nof the woods employed. The wood of young trees is converted into a\r\nglutinous coal; the old wood, of dry fire, into a dry coal. But these\r\nlast, if soaked in water before being placed in the tube, give a\r\nglutinous coal like the young wood, and sometimes a brown rosin, similar\r\nto asphaltum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA scientific Congress has been sitting in Paris. Several men of high\r\nreputation, Mr. Walsh says, took part in its proceedings, which gave\r\npromise of unusual interest. Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, was\r\nprominent as an orator. Recently, he could rally but two votes in the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, as a candidate for a vacant seat. The man is not so\r\nmuch prized, we may believe, as the ornithologist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. EOELMEN, the director of the national porcelain manufactory of\r\nSevres, has succeeded in producing crystalized minerals, resembling very\r\nclosely those produced by nature--chiefly precious and rare stones\r\nemployed by jewelers. To obtain this result, he has dissolved in boric\r\nacid, alum, zinc, magnesia, oxydes of iron, and chrome, and then\r\nsubjecting the solution to evaporation during three days, has obtained\r\ncrystals of a mineral substance, equaling in hardness and in beauty and\r\nclearness of color the natural stones. With chrome, M. Eoelmen has made\r\nmost brilliant rubies, from two to three millimetres in length, and\r\nabout as thick as a grain of corn. If rubies can be artificially made,\r\nsecrets which were pursued by the alchemists of old cannot be very far\r\noff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the _Liverpool Polytechnic Society_, Captain\r\nPURNELL read a paper in explanation of his plan for preventing vessels\r\nbeing water-logged at sea.

Dr. Jarvis was born in Middletown, where his father\r\n(afterward Bishop Jarvis) was then rector of Christ's Church, on the\r\n20th of January, 1787. His childhood and early youth (we compile from\r\nthe Hartford _Calendar_), were passed at Middletown till the Bishop\r\nremoved with him to Cheshire, where, in the Academy established by\r\nBishop Seabury, he completed his preparation for College. He entered at\r\nYale, in 1802, commenced Bachelor of Arts in 1805, and proceeded Master\r\nin 1808. On the 18th of March, 1810, he was ordained Deacon by his\r\nfather, in New Haven; and on the fifth of April, in the year following,\r\nin the same place, was admitted Priest. Immediately after, he became\r\nRector of St. Michael's and St. James' Churches, on the island of\r\nNew-York. In 1819, he was appointed Professor of Biblical Criticism, in\r\nthe General Theological Seminary, with the understanding that he was to\r\nperform also, all the duties of instruction, except those relating to\r\nEcclesiastical History. For various reasons, in 1820 he resigned this\r\nposition, and removing to Boston, became the first Rector of St. Paul's\r\nChurch in that city. In 1826, he sailed with his family for Europe, in\r\ndifferent parts of which he remained nine years. Here he chiefly devoted\r\nhimself to studies connected with Theology and the History of the\r\nChurch. He by no means, however, omitted the proper duties of his\r\noffice. His longest and most continuous service was in Siena; on leaving\r\nwhich place, the congregation presented to him a paten and chalice of\r\nexquisite workmanship, as a testimony of respect for his character, and\r\nof appreciation of his services.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence abroad, he was appointed Professor of Oriental\r\nLanguages and Literature in Trinity College, Hartford, and on returning\r\nto the United States in 1835, he established himself at the College;\r\nattending not only to various duties in connection with the College\r\nClasses, but also instructing the students in Theology. Those who were\r\nthere under his instruction, will not soon forget the delightful\r\nevenings in his study, when the recitation being over, conversation took\r\nits place, and stores of the most useful and varied learning were opened\r\nto them, with a kindness and unreservedness, which never could have been\r\nsurpassed. In 1837, he became Rector of Christ Church, Middletown, and\r\nin this position--having with him during the last year of its\r\ncontinuance only, an Assistant Minister--he remained till the spring of\r\n1842. He then resigned the Rectorship, and devoted himself to the\r\nespecial work to which the Church had called him. Still he evinced the\r\nsame readiness as ever to perform at all times and in all places, the\r\nduties of his sacred office; and his missionary labors during this\r\nperiod, will ever attest his faithfulness to his vows as a priest of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Dr. Jarvis went to England, with a view to certain arrangements\r\nin connection with the publication of his Chronological Introduction,\r\nand returned in time for the General Convention of 1844. From this\r\nperiod, he was steadily engaged in the prosecution of the first volume\r\nof his History: though his attention was frequently called off by other\r\ndemands upon his time and knowledge, among which may be particularly\r\nmentioned the compilation of a Harmony of the Gospels, the preparation\r\nof a work on Egypt--neither of which have yet been published--and the\r\ndrawing up a reply to Milner's End of Controversy. At the same time, he\r\nwas serving the Church as a Trustee of Trinity College, and of the\r\nGeneral Theological Seminary; as the Secretary of the Standing Committee\r\nof the Diocese of Connecticut, and Secretary and Treasurer of the\r\nChristian Knowledge Society; and as a member of Diocesan and General\r\nConventions. Besides all this, there was a large field of service and\r\nusefulness--the labor and worth of which can only be estimated by one\r\nwho should see the correspondence which it entailed--which was opened to\r\nhim, by the requests continually made from all quarters, for his\r\nopinions on matters of Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship. His life was\r\none of constant labor, and labor and trial wrought their work upon him.\r\nScarcely had his last work (the first volume of his History) been issued\r\nfrom the press, when aggravated disease came upon him; and after\r\nlingering for some time, with unmurmuring patience and resignation, he\r\ndied on the 26th of March, 1851, at the age of sixty-four.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BURNSIDE, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of\r\nPennsylvania, died in Germantown on the twenty-fifth of March. He was\r\nborn in the county of Tyrone, Ireland, July 28th, 1782, and came to this\r\ncountry, with his father's family, in 1792. In November, 1800, he\r\ncommenced the study of the law, with Mr. Robert Porter, in Philadelphia,\r\nand in the early part of 1804 was admitted to the bar, and removed to\r\nBellefonte. In 1811 he was elected to the state Senate, and was an\r\nactive supporter of the administration of Governor Snyder in all its war\r\nmeasures. In 1815 he was elected to Congress, and served during the\r\nmemorable session of 1816. In the summer of the same year he was\r\nappointed by Governor Snyder President Judge of the Luzerne district. He\r\nresigned this post in 1818, and resumed the practice of his profession\r\nat Bellefonte. In 1823 he was again elected to the State Senate, of\r\nwhich body he was made speaker. In 1826 he was appointed President Judge\r\nof the Seventh Judicial District, which office he held until 1841. He\r\nwas then appointed President Judge of the Fourth Judicial District,\r\ncomprising the counties of Bucks and Montgomery. On the first of\r\nJanuary, 1845, he was commissioned one of the Judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Pennsylvania, an office which he filled at the time of his\r\ndeath. Judge Burnside was a man of fine social qualities, and few\r\npersons have had more friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISAAC HILL, Governor of New Hampshire, United States senator, &c., was\r\nborn at Cambridge, the part now called Somerville, Mass., April 6th,\r\n1788. He was a descendant of Abraham Hill of Charlestown, who was\r\nadmitted _freeman_ 1640, and died at Malden, February 13, 1670, leaving\r\ntwo sons, Isaac and Abraham. From the latter of these, and fifth in\r\ndescent, was Isaac, the father of Governor Hill. His mother was Hannah\r\nRussell, a descendant of the Cambridge family of that name, \"ever\r\ndistinguished in the annals of Massachusetts.\"[M] His ancestors were\r\nstanch patriots, on both sides, and served with credit in the old French\r\nand Indian wars, and his immediate predecessors were among the earliest\r\nand the most efficient of the \"Sons of Liberty,\" well known for their\r\nundaunted spirit in encouraging resistance to the arbitrary and\r\noppressive acts which occasioned the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which the war and other calamities had placed his\r\nfamily were extremely unfavorable to the enjoyment of any educational\r\nprivileges, and he was debarred from most opportunities of acquiring\r\neven the rudiments of that culture now common and free to all. But he\r\nstruggled manfully with these difficulties, the sharp discipline of\r\nNecessity giving to him an early training well calculated to impress his\r\ncharacter with the seal of manliness and self-reliance. His intellectual\r\nconstitution was early accustomed to the keen atmosphere of wholesome\r\nseverity; and it nerved and braced him for the warfare of his subsequent\r\ncareer. In it, too, we may find the origin of his peculiar traits as a\r\nwriter and a politician. He wrote in a vigorous but not polished style,\r\nand all his productions were more forcible than elegant. But their very\r\nbareness and sinewy proportions opened their way to the hearts of the\r\npeople whom he addressed. His prejudices were their prejudices, and in\r\nthe most earnest expression of his own strongest feeling and passion he\r\nfound the echo from the multitude of the democracy of his adopted state.\r\n\r\nHis childhood and early youth thus formed, his next step was in the\r\nlearning his trade, or acquiring his profession: for if any occupation\r\nin life combines more elements of professional knowledge than another,\r\nit is that of a printer-editor.\r\n\r\nThough not an indented apprentice, he served his _seven years' time_\r\nwith faithfulness, and acquired those habits of patient, persevering\r\nindustry which characterized his whole subsequent career. The\r\nprinting-office has been the college and university to many of the most\r\ndistinguished of our citizens: and that which he founded at Concord has\r\nbeen the _Alma Mater_ of a series of graduates, of whom old Dartmouth\r\nmight justly be proud, could she enroll them among her Alumni. Although\r\nthe paper published by Mr. Cushing, with whom young Hill learned his\r\nprofession, was strongly federal, he retained the strong democratic\r\nprejudices of his father's house, which he afterwards so zealously\r\nadvocated in more responsible positions.\r\n\r\nHe went to Concord, N. H, on the 5th April 1809, the day before he\r\nattained his majority. He bought an establishment of six months'\r\nstanding, from which had been issued the _American Patriot_, a\r\ndemocratic paper, but not conducted with any great efficiency, and\r\ntherefore not considered as yet \"a useful auxiliary in the cause of\r\nrepublicanism.\" On the 18th of April, 1809, was issued the first number\r\nof the _New Hampshire Patriot_, a paper destined to exert an immense\r\ninfluence in that state from that time to the present. The press on\r\nwhich it was printed was the identical old _Ramage_ press on which had\r\nbeen struck off the first numbers of the old _Connecticut Courant_,\r\nforty-five years before, that is, in 1764. The first number of the paper\r\nis before us. It bears for its motto the following sentiment of Madison,\r\n\"Indulging no passions which trespass on the rights of others, it shall\r\nbe our true glory to cultivate peace by observing justice.\" Among the\r\nselections is a portion of the famous speech of William B. Giles, in the\r\nSenate, February 13th, 1809, in support of the resolution for a repeal\r\nof the Embargo, and substituting non-intercourse with the aggressing\r\nbelligerents, offered by him on the 8th of the same month. In the next\r\nnumber of the paper the editor expresses the opinion that \"the man, who,\r\nafter reading this lucid exposition of British aggressions, can blame\r\nhis own government--can accuse the administration of a want of\r\nforbearance, and a wish to provoke a war with England without cause,\r\nmust be wilfully blind or perversely foolish.\" This recalls at once the\r\ncircumstances of the time, shortly after the beginning of Madison's\r\nadministration, and during the Embargo. Democracy was odious in New\r\nEngland, where the prostration of her commercial interests, the ruin of\r\nmany and serious injury of all her citizens, had rendered the\r\nadministration exceedingly unpopular. The _Patriot_, however, steadily\r\ndefended the administration and the war which followed. Probably there\r\nwill always exist a difference of opinion with respect to the necessity\r\nor expediency of the war of 1812; but public opinion has given its\r\nsanction to what is now known as the \"Second War of Independence.\" Since\r\nthat time its advocates have been steadily supported by the country, and\r\namong them the subject of this sketch, who always referred with peculiar\r\npride to that portion of his career--\"the dark and portentous period\r\nwhich preceded the war.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill continued to edit the Patriot until 1829, a period of twenty\r\nyears; during which time he was twice chosen clerk of the State Senate,\r\nonce Representative from the town of Concord, and State Senator four\r\ntimes. In 1828, he was the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senator, but\r\nwas not elected. In 1829, he received the appointment of Second\r\nComptroller of the Treasury Department from General Jackson, and\r\ndischarged the duties of that office until April, 1830, when his\r\nnomination was rejected by the Senate of the United States. The light in\r\nwhich his rejection was regarded in New Hampshire, may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that its result was his triumphant election to represent that\r\nState in the body which had rejected him. He continued in the Senate\r\nuntil 1836, when he was elected Governor of the State of New Hampshire\r\nby a very large majority. He was twice reëlected, in 1837 and 1838.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, he was appointed Sub Treasurer at Boston, which he held until\r\nremoved, in March, 1841, by the Harrison administration.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the policy of the radical party in New Hampshire, to\r\nwhich Mr. Hill had always adhered, became tainted with an ultraism,\r\nwhich he could not approve. He opposed their hostility to railroad and\r\nother corporations, with the same vigor which had always characterized\r\nhis career. He was subjected to the proscription of the party, and\r\nformally \"read out\" of the church of the New Hampshire Democracy. He\r\nestablished a new paper, \"Hill's New Hampshire Patriot,\" in which he\r\nrevived his old reputation as an editor and political writer. The\r\nimportance of the great internal improvements which he advocated, to the\r\nprosperity of the State, brought back the party from their wanderings\r\ninto abstractions, and with this return to the old ways, came also the\r\nacknowledgment of the political orthodoxy of Mr. Hill. The new paper was\r\nunited with the old Patriot--and one of his sons associated in the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of his life, he also published and edited the\r\nFarmer's Monthly Visiter, an agricultural paper. It was commenced\r\nJanuary 15, 1839, and has been continued to the present time. It was\r\ndevoted to the farming and producing interests, and its volumes contain\r\nmuch valuable matter; of which Gov. Hill's own personal sketches and\r\nreminiscences form no small portion.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of his life he suffered much from the disease\r\nwhich finally conquered his vigorous constitution. He bore little active\r\npart in political affairs--but took a lively interest in the success of\r\nthe compromise measures--to which he referred in his last hours, as, in\r\nhis opinion, most important in their bearing on the safety of the Union.\r\nHe made great efforts to promote their passage, and probably did some\r\nservice in the cause of the Union, to which he was ardently devoted. He\r\nrecognized the compromises of the Constitution, with unwavering fidelity\r\nto its spirit. We regret our inability to give in this place some\r\nextracts from a letter of Daniel Webster, addressed to one of Mr. Hill's\r\nsons, upon the occasion of his death, which reflects equal honor upon\r\nthe writer and its subject, in its recognition of the services to which\r\nwe have referred.\r\n\r\nThe present occasion affords no opportunity to review more particularly\r\nthe events of Mr. Hill's political career of public service. It is to be\r\nhoped that some one may hereafter prepare the history of his life and\r\ntimes--which involves an important part of the political history of New\r\nHampshire, and a corresponding connection with that of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following concluding paragraph of the notice in the New\r\nHampshire Patriot of the 27th March, written by the present editor, Mr.\r\nButterfield:\r\n\r\n\"We have thus hastily and imperfectly noticed the prominent events in\r\nGovernor Hill's life. Few men in this country have exerted so great an\r\ninfluence over the people of their States as he has over those of New\r\nHampshire. He possessed great native talent, indomitable energy,\r\nindustry and perseverance. As a political editor he had few equals, and\r\nhis reputation in that field extended throughout the country. As a son,\r\na husband, a brother, and a father, he has left a reputation honorable\r\nto himself, and which will cause his memory to be cherished. Although\r\nafflicted for many years with a painful disease, exerting at times an\r\nunfavorable influence upon his equanimity, yet we believe the \"sober\r\nsecond thought\" of those who reflect upon his past history and services\r\nand trials, will accord with what we have said of his estimable private\r\ncharacter, and his naturally kind and amiable disposition. And now that\r\nhis spirit has gone to another, and, we trust, a better world, the\r\nunkindness engendered by political and personal differences will be\r\nforgotten, the faults and errors of the dead will be forgiven, and our\r\nthoughts will rest only upon his many private virtues and eminent public\r\nservices.\"\r\n\r\nThe last illness of Mr. Hill was of about five weeks duration. He died\r\nof catarrhal consumption, in the city of Washington, Saturday, the 22d\r\nof March, 1851, at four o'clock, P. M.

D., son of Thomas Daggett, of Attleborough,\r\nMassachusetts, was born in that town on the last day of the year 1764.\r\nHe entered Yale College at fourteen, and graduated there with\r\ndistinction in 1783. Pursuing his legal studies in New Haven, while he\r\nheld the rectorship of the Hopkins Grammar School, he was admitted to\r\nthe bar in 1785. For sixty-five years his life was identified with the\r\nhistory and prosperity of New Haven and of Connecticut. Besides the\r\nmunicipal offices which he held, including that of Mayor of New Haven,\r\nhe was long a Professor of Yale College, in the Law School of which he\r\nwas especially eminent. His last public station was that of Chief\r\nJustice of the State, from the duties of which he retired at the age of\r\nseventy, through the jealous wisdom of the constitution of Connecticut.\r\nHis connection with the law school, however, continued till within a\r\nvery few years, when his health became gradually impaired through the\r\nadvance of age, though for the last year he enjoyed an unusual exemption\r\nfrom his infirmities. About the end of March his family became\r\napprehensive of a change for the worse, and on Saturday, April 12th, he\r\ndied, at the advanced age of eighty-six years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAJOR JAMES REES, born in Philadelphia in 1766, died at Geneva,\r\nNew-York, on the 24th of March. He was in his youth a confidential\r\ncleric to Robert Morris, the financier; during the Whiskey Insurrection\r\nin Pennsylvania, he was a Deputy Quarter-Master General under\r\nWashington, and he held the same office under Wilkinson and under Izard,\r\nin the war of 1812.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMORDECAI M. NOAH, who for nearly half a century had been eminent as a\r\npolitician and a journalist, and who was one of the most distinguished\r\nJews of the present age, died in New-York on the 2nd of March. He was\r\nborn in Philadelphia on the 19th of July, 1785, and at an early age was\r\napprenticed to a carver and gilder in that city; but a love of\r\nliterature and affairs induced the abandonment of that vocation for the\r\nmore congenial one to which he devoted the chief part of his life. His\r\neditorial career commenced in Charleston, S. C., and some interesting\r\npassages of his history there are given in the first volume of Thomas's\r\n_Reminiscences_. In 1811 Mr. Madison appointed him consul at Riga, but\r\nhe declined the place. In 1813 he was appointed by Mr. Monroe consul to\r\nTunis, with a mission to Algiers. On the voyage his vessel was captured\r\nby a British frigate and taken to Plymouth. His diplomatic position\r\nexempted him from imprisonment, but he was detained several weeks, and\r\ndid not reach his destination until February, 1814. Having accomplished\r\nthe object of his mission, he crossed the Pyrenees, and visited Paris.\r\nAfter a brief residence in that city, he proceeded to Tunis, where he\r\nremained until recalled, in 1816. In 1819 he published a book of\r\n_Travels_, containing the result of his observations in Europe and\r\nNorthern Africa, during a three years' residence in those countries. He\r\nnow became one of the editors and proprietors of the _National\r\nAdvocate_, in which he published the _Essays on Domestic Economy_,\r\nsigned \"Howard,\" which were subsequently printed in a volume. The next\r\npaper with which he was connected was the _Enquirer_, afterwards Courier\r\n& Enquirer, in the management of which he was associated with Colonel\r\nWebb. The several papers of which he was at various times editor or\r\nproprietor, or both, were the _National Advocate_, _Enquirer_, _Courier\r\n& Enquirer_, _Evening Star_, _Sun_, _Morning Star_, and _Weekly\r\nMessenger_. His most successful journal was the _Evening Star_, but he\r\nwas eminently popular at all times as an editorial writer, and was very\r\nfortunate when he had, as in the _Evening Star_, or the _Sunday Times_,\r\njudicious business partners. Soon after his return from Africa occurred\r\nhis celebrated attempt to assemble all the Jews of the world on this\r\ncontinent, and build a new Jerusalem at Grand Island, in the Niagara\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 he was elected sheriff of the city and county of New-York.\r\nDuring his term of office the yellow fever broke out, and he opened the\r\ndoors of the prisons and let go all who were confined for debt--an act\r\nof generous humanity which cost him several thousand dollars. He was\r\nadmitted to the bar of this city in 1823, and to the bar of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States in 1829. In 1829 he was also appointed, by\r\nPresident dent Jackson, Surveyor of the Port of New-York, which office\r\nhe shortly afterward resigned. In the political contest of 1840, he took\r\npart against Mr. Van Buren, whom he had long regarded with distrust, and\r\nvoted for General Harrison. In 1841 he was appointed by Governor Seward,\r\nJudge of the Court of Sessions. He was probably the only Hebrew who\r\noccupied a judicial station in Christendom. During the same year he was\r\nmade Supreme Court Commissioner. When a change in the organization of\r\nthe Court of Sessions took place he resigned his seat on the bench, and\r\nsoon returned to his old profession. In 1843 he became one of the\r\neditors and proprietors of the _Sunday Times_, with which he was\r\nconnected when he died.\r\n\r\nMajor Noah was a very rapid and an industrious writer. Besides his\r\n_Travels in England, France, Spain, and the Barbary States, in the Years\r\n1813, 1814, and 1815_, and the _Howard Papers on Domestic Economy_, he\r\npublished several orations and addresses on political, religious and\r\nantiquarian subjects; edited _The Book of Jasher_, and wrote numerous\r\nsuccessful plays, of which an account may be found in Dunlap's _History\r\nof the Stage_. The most prominent of them were, _She would be a Soldier,\r\nor the Plains of Chippewa_; _Ali Pacha, or the Signet Ring_; _Marion, or\r\nthe Hero of Lake George_; _Nathalie, or the Frontier Maid_; _Yusef\r\nCaramali, or the Siege of Tripoli_; _The Castle of Sorrento_, _The Siege\r\nof Daramatta_, _The Grecian Captive_, and _Ambition._ He for a long time\r\ncontemplated writing _Memoirs of his Times_, and he published in the\r\n_Evening Star_ many interesting reminiscences intended to form part of\r\nsuch work.\r\n\r\nMajor Noah was a man of remarkable generosity of character, and in all\r\nperiods of his life was liberal of his means, to Christians as well as\r\nto Jews: holding the place of President in the Hebrew Benevolent\r\nSociety, and being frequently selected as adviser in other temporary or\r\npermanent associations for the relief of distress. As a politician he\r\nwas perhaps not the most scrupulous in the world, but there was rarely\r\nif ever any bitterness in his controversies. In religion he was sincere\r\nand earnest, and the Hebrews in America we believe uniformly held his\r\ncharacter in respect\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN S.

He had held the\r\nappointment of Post-Master at Baltimore for a period of twenty years,\r\nthough removed from it fifteen years ago, and he was afterward Assistant\r\nPost-Master General. Intending to hurry out from the Baltimore\r\nPost-Office--which he had entered for some business with his\r\nsuccessor--into the street, he inadvertently opened a door leading to\r\nthe basement of the building, and before he could recover himself,\r\nplunged head foremost down the flight of steps.

He was the son of an\r\napothecary of Rudkjobing, in the province of Larzeland. Fourteen days\r\nbefore his death he gave a scientific lecture at the University of\r\nCopenhagen, where he was Professor of Natural Science. He was nearly of\r\nthe same age with Thorwaldsen and Oehlenschlager. His last work, _Der\r\nGeist in der Natur_, was not long since the subject of remark in these\r\npages. His fame as the discoverer of electro-magnetism, (which discovery\r\nhe made, after laborious researches, on the fifth of June 1821,) and as\r\na profound and genial thinker, will be immortal.\r\n\r\nAt Rudkjobing he received his early education with his brother Anders\r\nSandöe Oersted, a distinguished senator of Denmark, and for some years\r\none of the ministers of state. Christian Oersted was sent to Copenhagen\r\nto study medicine. After completing his course of pharmacy, he directed\r\nhis powers to the study of natural philosophy, and greatly distinguished\r\nhimself in that science, of which he subsequently became University\r\nProfessor. His grand discovery of electro-magnetism led to the\r\nsubsequent development of the electric telegraph. In 1807 he wrote his\r\nwork reviving the hypothesis of the identity of magnetism and\r\nelectricity, in which he arrived at the conclusion--that \"in galvanism\r\nthe force is more latent than in electricity, and still more so in\r\nmagnetism than in galvanism; it is necessary, therefore, to try whether\r\nelectricity, in its latent state, will not affect the magnetic needle.\"\r\nNo experiment appears, however, to have been made to determine the\r\nquestion until 1820, when Oersted placed a magnetic needle within the\r\ninfluence of a wire connecting the extremities with a voltaic battery.\r\nThe voltaic current was now, for the first time, observed to produce a\r\ndeviation of the magnetic needle in different directions, and in\r\ndifferent degrees, according to the relative situation of the wire and\r\nneedle. By subsequent experiment Oersted proved that the wire became,\r\nduring the time the battery was in action, magnetic, and that it\r\naffected a magnetic needle through glass, and every other non-conducting\r\nbody, but that it had no action on a needle similarly suspended, that\r\nwas not magnetic. To Professor Oersted is also due the important\r\ndiscovery, that electro-magnetic effects do not depend upon the\r\nintensity of the electricity, but solely on its quantity. By these\r\ndiscoveries an entirely new branch of science was established, and all\r\nthe great advances which have been made in our knowledge of the laws\r\nwhich regulate the magnetic forces in their action upon matter, are to\r\nbe referred to the discovery by Oersted, that by an electric current\r\nmagnetism could be induced. He promulgated a theory of light, in which\r\nhe referred luminous phenomena to electricity in motion; it has not,\r\nhowever, been favorably received.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important observations first made by him, and since then\r\nconfirmed by others, was, that a body falling from a height not only\r\nfell a little to the east of the true perpendicular--which is, no doubt,\r\ndue to the earth's motion--but that it fell to the _south_ of that line;\r\nthe cause of this is at present unexplained. It is, no doubt, connected\r\nwith some great phenomena of gravitation which yet remain to be\r\ndiscovered. At the meeting of the British Association at Southampton,\r\nProfessor Oersted communicated to the Chemical Section some curious\r\nexamples of the influence of time in determining chemical change, as\r\nshown in the action of mercury upon glass in hermetically sealed\r\nvessels. The character of Professor Oersted's mind was essentially\r\nsearching and minute; thus he observed results which escaped detection\r\nin the hands of those who took more general and enlarged views of\r\nnatural phenomena. To this was due the discovery of electro-magnetism,\r\nwhich will for ever connect his name with the history of inductive\r\nscience. As Director of the Polytechnic Institution of Copenhagen, of\r\nwhich he was the founder, and of the Society for the Diffusion of\r\nNatural Sciences, and as Perpetual Secretary of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences since 1815, his labors were unceasing and of great benefit to\r\nhis country. He was for many years attached to the Military College of\r\nCadets of Copenhagen, and only resigned when he could be succeeded by\r\none of his own pupils. His manners and demeanor were extremely modest\r\nand unobtrusive. The British Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal\r\nfor his discovery in electro-magnetism, and the Academy of Sciences of\r\nParis presented him with their Gold Medal. Both Societies elected him a\r\nForeign Member.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRI DELATOUCHE, who died early in March at Aulnay, France, was born\r\nFebruary 3d, 1785. His first work was _Fragoletta_, a book treating in\r\nan original way the revolution of Naples in 1799; it was the fruit of a\r\nlong sojourn in Italy, a genuine production of genius, in which the\r\nchapters devoted to antique art are especially remarkable. During the\r\nHundred Days he was the secretary of Marshal Brune, and was made\r\nsub-prefect of Toulon. The downfall of Napoleon deprived him of office,\r\nand restored him to literature and general politics. During the\r\nRestoration he gained great applause by his eloquent and successful\r\ndefence of his father, who was tried before a political court, and but\r\nfor his son would have been one of the victims of that bloody period. He\r\nwas prominent in the agitation of public questions through that time,\r\nand through the ten first years of Louis Philippe. He was intimate with\r\nB. Constant Chateaubriand, Madame Recamier, Gros, Gerard, Armand Carrel,\r\nGodfrey Cavaignac, Beranger, and George Sand. He was one of the editors\r\nof the _National_, and the chief writer of the brilliant and effective\r\n_Figaro_. His books were _Fragoletta_, _Aymar_, _France et Marie_,\r\n_Lettres de Clement XIV. et de Carlo Bertinazzi_, _Les Adieux_. Though\r\nhe adopted the form of romance, the purpose of his writings was\r\nhistorical and didactic. In the latter part of his life he made\r\npreparations to write a _Histoire des Conjurations pour la Liberté_, but\r\ndid not accomplish it. He was a man of noble character and remarkable\r\ngenius. His conversation was brilliant and fascinating. Since Diderot,\r\nit is said that France has produced no talker to be compared with him.\r\nGeorge Sand frequently compares him to Rousseau. Like that philosopher,\r\ntoward the close of his life he manifested a passionate love of nature\r\nand solitude. He spent his time laboring in his garden, and living in\r\nthe most frugal manner. The aged and manly poet was beloved of the\r\nneighboring peasants, as well as by the friends he had left behind him\r\nin the great world; and though he had often criticised his\r\ncontemporaries with extreme severity, sometimes even with injustice, he\r\nleft no enemies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the persons lately deceased who are worthy of mention is Madame DE\r\nSERMETZY, who died at her country seat, near the French city of Lyons,\r\nat the age of eighty-one years. Had circumstances favored the\r\ndevelopment of her genius, she would have acquired a name among the\r\nsculptors of the time. She left behind her a number of works in terra\r\ncotta. A Psyche of life-size is said to be full of expression and grace;\r\na Plato is remarkable for anatomical correctness and manly force. Both\r\nare in the Academy at St. Pierre. She also modelled a Sappho, a Lesbia,\r\nand some dozen busts. Of smaller works, statuettes and groups, she has\r\nleft some two hundred in terra cotta, among them a St Augustine, said to\r\nbe admirable for expression and nobleness. The churches constantly\r\nreceived from her gifts of beautiful angels and madonnas. A few years\r\nbefore her death she modelled a madonna of the size of life, which is\r\none of her best works. Want of means alone prevented her from executing\r\nher productions in marble. She was also familiar with the literature,\r\nnot only of her own nation, but of the Latin, Spanish, Italian, and\r\nEnglish languages, which she spoke with fluency and correctness, a rare\r\naccomplishment for a French woman. During the Empire and the Restoration\r\nshe was intimate with Madame Recamier and Madame de Staël, and for\r\npenetration and readiness of mind and charm of manners was not unworthy\r\nto be named with these remarkable women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARSHAL DODE DE LA BRUNIERE, one of the soldiers of Napoleon, who raised\r\nhim to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and employed him in many\r\nimportant services, died at Paris on the 28th February, aged\r\nseventy-seven. He served in the campaign of Egypt as a lieutenant of\r\nengineers. After the siege of Saragossa he was made a colonel. He\r\nparticipated in all the great battles of the empire, and was finally\r\nmade a peer of France and a marshal by Louis Philippe, after having\r\ndirected the construction of the gigantic fortifications around Paris.\r\nHe was a frank, affable, and kind-hearted man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. MAILLAU, one of the most productive of Paris dramatists, died in that\r\ncity March, twelfth, aged forty-five. He was born in Guadaloupe, and\r\nbegan life in France as a lawyer, but soon abandoned that profession to\r\nwrite for the stage. He wrote a large number of dramas, some of which\r\nwere very successful. The last one, called _La Révolution Française_,\r\nhas run a hundred and fifty nights, and is still performing. He was an\r\nexcellent fellow, and nobody's enemy but his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. HENRY DE BRESLAU, senior of the Faculty of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Munich, died lately. He was second medical officer on the\r\nstaff of Napoleon, under Larrey, and followed the French army in the\r\nRussian campaign. He was made prisoner on the field of Waterloo. France,\r\nBavaria, Saxony, Greece, and Portugal, had recognized his scientific\r\neminence by severally enrolling his name among their orders of chivalry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER LIN, whose seizure and destruction of the opium in 1839 led\r\nto the war with China, died suddenly on the eighteenth of November last,\r\nwhile on his way to the insurrectionary district of Quan-si.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN LOUIS YANOSKI was born at Lons-le-Saulnier, France, March 9, 1813,\r\nand died at Paris early in February last. Though not known much out of\r\nhis own country, few literary men have possessed more admirable and\r\nsubstantial qualities. He was feeble in bodily powers, but endowed with\r\nindefatigable ardor in the pursuit of intellectual objects, and a mind\r\nat once penetrating and judicious. He was educated in the College of\r\nVersailles. In 1836 he became a tutor in history at the University at\r\nParis. Subsequently he was selected by Thierry to assist in the\r\npreparation of his history of the Tiers-Etat, and spent four years in\r\nworking upon it. At the same time he labored assiduously in other\r\ndirections. In 1839 he gained two prizes from the Academy of Moral and\r\nPolitical Sciences, one for a memoir on the organization of the national\r\nforces from the twelfth century to the reign of Charles VII; the other\r\nfor an essay on the abolition of slavery in antiquity. In 1841 the\r\nAcademy selected him to prepare, under the direction of M. Mignet, a\r\nview of the progress of the moral and political sciences, a work which\r\nwas not completed when he died. In 1840 he was made professor of history\r\nin Stanislas College; in 1842 Michelet chose him for his substitute at\r\nthe College of France, but in that capacity he gave but a single\r\nlecture, being seized while speaking with hemorrhage of the lungs, from\r\nwhich he did not recover for several months. Notwithstanding the labors\r\nrequired by all these occupations he found time to write for Didot's\r\n_Univers Pittoresque_ a history of Carthage from the second Punic war to\r\nthe Vandal invasion, a history of the Vandal rule and the Byzantine\r\nrestoration, another of the African Church, and one of the Church of\r\nAncient Syria. He also furnished many important articles to the\r\nEncyclopedic Dictionary, wrote often for the _National_ newspaper, and\r\nfor two years was chief editor of the _Nouvelle Revue Encyclopédique_.\r\nHe was a republican in sentiment, and a character of exceeding nobleness\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLONEL COUNT D'HOZIER, a distinguished French officer, who was\r\ncompromised in the affair of Georges Cadoudal, died early in March, in\r\nParis, aged seventy-seven. On the occasion of the conspiracy referred\r\nto, he was sentenced to death, but obtained his pardon through the\r\ninterference of the Empress Josephine, and as a commutation of his\r\npunishment was imprisoned until the year 1814 in the prison of the\r\nChateau d'If--the scene of the confinement of Dumas' hero, the Comte de\r\nMontechristo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

FENIMORE COOPER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the delightful home which in the above engraving is reflected with\r\nequal spirit and fidelity, our great novelist has composed the larger\r\nportion of those admirable tales and histories that display his own\r\ncapacities, and the characteristics and tendencies of our people.\r\n\r\nHere also was written the beautiful work by Mr. COOPER'S daughter,\r\nentitled \"Rural Hours.\" Could any thing tempt to such authorship more\r\nstrongly than a residence thus quiet, and surrounded with birds, and\r\nflowers, and trees, and all the picturesque varieties of land and water\r\nwhich render Cooperstown a paradise to the lover of nature?\r\n\r\nIn the last _International_ we sketched the career of Mr. Cooper, and\r\ngave an account of his writings, and an estimate of their value. What we\r\nadd here shall relate to the work which entitles his daughter to share\r\nhis eminence. \"Rural Hours\" is one of the most charming contributions\r\nliterature has ever received from the hand of a woman. Though in the\r\nsimple form of a diary, it is scarcely less than Thomson's \"Seasons\" a\r\npoem; yet while seeming continually to reflect the most poetical phases\r\nof nature and of rural life--so delicate is the appreciation of natural\r\nbeauty, and so pure and unaffected and exquisitely graceful the style of\r\ncomposition--it has throughout even a Flemish truth and particularity of\r\ndetail. If we were called upon to name a literary performance that is\r\nmore than any other American in its whole character, we cannot now think\r\nof one that would sooner receive this praise. A record of real\r\nobservations during the daily walks of many years in a secluded town, or\r\nof the changes which the seasons brought with their various gifts and\r\nforces into domestic experience, it is a series of pictures which could\r\nno more have been made in another country than so many paintings on\r\ncanvas of scenes by Otsego lake. The leaves are blown over by Otsego\r\nairs, or if the eye grows heavy and the pages are unturned it is for\r\nslumberous spells that attach to delineations of the sunshine and\r\nsilence of Otsego's August noons. And the views Miss Cooper gives us of\r\nthe characters and occupations of the agricultural population in that\r\npart of the country, who wear curiously interblended the old English and\r\nDutch habits with here and there a sign of the French, and the\r\nrepublican freedom which in three generations has taken the tone of\r\nnature, are as distinctive as the descriptions of changes which the\r\nmaple assumes in the autumn, or of the harvest of Indian corn, or a deer\r\nhunt in the snow. Upon a careless reading of \"Rural Hours\" we might\r\nfancy that Miss Cooper was less familiar than perhaps should be for such\r\na task with botany and other sciences, but a closer study of the book\r\nreveals the most minute and comprehensive knowledge, so interfused that\r\nit is without technical forms only, and never deficient in precision.\r\nThe style is everywhere not only delightfully free, while artistically\r\nfinished, but it is remarkably pure, so that there is in the literature\r\nof this country not a specimen of more genuine English. In this respect\r\nthe work of one of the most highly and variously educated women of our\r\ntime, to whom the languages of the politest nations were through all her\r\nyouth familiar in their courts, may be well compared with the\r\ncompositions which \"literary ladies\" with Phrase Books make half French\r\nor half Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. DEWEY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf our younger and minor poets no one has more natural grace and\r\ntenderness than GEORGE W. DEWEY. The son of a painter, and himself the\r\nSecretary of the Philadelphia Art Union, it may be supposed that he is\r\nwell instructed in the principles upon which effect depends; but while\r\nnative genius, as it is called, is of little value without art, no man\r\nwas ever made a poet by art alone, and it is impossible to read \"Blind\r\nLouise,\" \"A Memory,\" or \"A Blighted May,\" without perceiving that Mr.\r\nDewey's commission has both the sign and the countersign, in due form,\r\nso that his right to the title of poet is in every respect\r\nunquestionable. He has not written much, but whatever he has given to\r\nthe public is written well, and all his compositions have the signs of a\r\ngenuineness that never fails to please. There is no collection of his\r\npoems, but from the journals to which he contributes we have selected\r\nthe following specimens:\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEMORY.\r\n\r\n    It was a bright October day--\r\n      Ah, well do I remember!\r\n    One rose yet bore the bloom of May,\r\n      Down toward the dark December.\r\n\r\n    One rose that near the lattice grew,\r\n      With fragrance floating round it:\r\n    Incarnardined, it blooms anew\r\n      In dreams of her who found it.\r\n\r\n    Pale, withered rose, bereft and shorn\r\n      Of all thy primal glory,\r\n    All leafless now, thy piercing thorn\r\n      Reveals a sadder story.\r\n\r\n    It was a dreary winter day;\r\n      Too well do I remember!\r\n    They bore her frozen form away,\r\n      And gave her to December!\r\n\r\n    There were no perfumes on the air,\r\n      No bridal blossoms round her,\r\n    Save one pale lily in her hair\r\n      To tell how pure Death found her.\r\n\r\n    The thistle on the summer air\r\n      Hath shed its iris glory,\r\n    And thrice the willows weeping there\r\n      Have told the seasons' story,\r\n\r\n    Since she, who bore the blush of May,\r\n      Down towards the dark December\r\n    Pass'd like the thorn-tree's bloom away,\r\n      A pale, reluctant ember.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLIND LOUISE.\r\n\r\n    She knew that she was growing blind--\r\n      Forsaw the dreary night\r\n    That soon would fall, without a star,\r\n      Upon her fading sight:\r\n\r\n    Yet never did she make complaint,\r\n      But pray'd each day might bring\r\n    A beauty to her waning eyes--\r\n      The loveliness of Spring!\r\n\r\n    She dreaded that eclipse which might\r\n      Perpetually inclose\r\n    Sad memories of a leafless world--\r\n      A spectral realm of snows.\r\n\r\n    She'd rather that the verdure left\r\n      An evergreen to shine\r\n    Within her heart, as summer leaves\r\n      Its memory on the pine.\r\n\r\n    She had her wish: for when the sun\r\n      O'erhung his eastern towers,\r\n    And shed his benediction on\r\n      A world of May-time flowers--\r\n\r\n    We found her seated, as of old,\r\n      In her accustom'd place,\r\n    A midnight in her sightless eyes,\r\n      And morn upon her face!\r\n\r\n\r\nA BLIGHTED MAY.\r\n\r\n    Call not this the month of roses--\r\n      There are none to bud and bloom;\r\n    Morning light, alas! discloses\r\n      But the winter of the tomb.\r\n    All that should have deck'd a bridal\r\n    Rest upon the bier--how idle!\r\n      Dying in their own perfume.\r\n\r\n    Every bower is now forsaken--\r\n      There's no bird to charm the air!\r\n    From the bough of youth is shaken\r\n      Every hope that blossom'd there;\r\n    And my soul doth now inrobe her\r\n    In the leaves of sere October\r\n      Under branches swaying bare.\r\n\r\n    When the midnight falls beside me,\r\n      Like the gloom which in me lies,\r\n    To the stars my feelings guide me,\r\n      Seeking there thy sainted eyes;\r\n    Stars whose rays seem ever bringing\r\n    Down the soothing air, the singing\r\n      Of thy soul in paradise.\r\n\r\n    Oh, that I might stand and listen\r\n      To that music ending never,\r\n    While those tranquil stars should glisten\r\n      On my life's o'erfrozen river,\r\n    Standing thus, for ever seeming\r\n    Lost in what the world calls dreaming,\r\n      Dreaming, love, of thee, forever!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHADY SIDE.\r\n\r\n    I sat and gazed upon thee, ROSE,\r\n      Across the pebbled way,\r\n    And thought the very wealth of mirth\r\n      Was thine that winter day;\r\n    For while I saw the truant rays\r\n      Within thy window glide,\r\n    Remember'd beams reflected came\r\n      Upon the shady side.\r\n\r\n    I sat and gazed upon thee, ROSE,\r\n      And thought the transient beams\r\n    Were leaving on thy braided brow\r\n      The trace of golden dreams;\r\n    Those dreams, which like the ferry-barge\r\n      On youth's beguiling tide,\r\n    Will leave us when we reach old age,\r\n      Upon the shady side.\r\n\r\n    Ah! yes, methought while thus I gazed\r\n      Across the noisy way,\r\n    The stream of life between us flow'd\r\n      That cheerful winter day;\r\n    And that the bark whereon I cross'd\r\n      The river's rapid tide,\r\n    Had left me in the quietness\r\n      Upon the shady side.\r\n\r\n    Then somewhat of a sorrow, ROSE,\r\n      Came crowding on my heart,\r\n    Revealing how that current sweeps\r\n      The fondest ones apart;\r\n    But while you stood to bless me there,\r\n      In beauty, like a bride,\r\n    I felt my own contentedness,\r\n      Though on the shady side.\r\n\r\n    The crowd and noise divide us, ROSE,\r\n      But there will come a day\r\n    When you, with light and timid feet,\r\n      Must cross the busy way;\r\n    And when you sit, as I do now,\r\n      To happy thoughts allied,\r\n    May some bright angel shed her light\r\n      Upon the shady side!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Fashions for the Early Summer._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Costume for a Young Girl._--In the above engraving the largest figure\r\nhas boots of pale violet cachmere and morocco; trowsers of worked\r\ncambric; and dress of a pale chocolate cachmere, trimmed with narrow\r\nsilk fringe, the double robings on each side of the front as well as the\r\ncape, on the half-high corsage, ornamented with a double row of narrow\r\nsilk fringe, this trimming repeated round the lower part of the loose\r\nsleeve; the chemisette of plaited cambric, headed with a broad frill of\r\nembroidery; full under sleeves of cambric, with a row of embroidery\r\nround the wrist; open bonnet of pink satin, a row of white lace\r\nencircling the interior next the face. The second miss has button gaiter\r\nboots of chocolate cachmere; trowsers and undersleeves of white\r\nembroidered cambric; frock of plaided cachmere; _paletot_ of purple\r\nvelvet; hat of a round shape, of white satin, the low crown adorned with\r\na long white ostrich feather.\r\n\r\n_The Boy's Dress_ is made to correspond as nearly as may be with that of\r\nthe youngest girl--embroidered pantalettes, and under sleeves trimmed\r\nwith pointed lace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Morning Promenade Costume._--A high dress of black satin, the\r\nbody fitting perfectly tight; has a small jacket cut on the _biais_,\r\nwith row of black velvet laid on a little distance from the edge; the\r\nsleeves are rather large, and have a broad cuff turned back, which is\r\ntrimmed to correspond with the jacket; the skirt is long and full; the\r\ndress is ornamented up the front in its whole length by rich fancy silk\r\ntrimmings, graduating in size from the bottom of the skirt to the waist,\r\nand again increasing to the throat. _Capote_ of plum-colored satin;\r\nsometimes plain, sometimes with a bunch of hearts-ease, intermixed with\r\nribbon, placed low on the left side, the same flowers, but somewhat\r\nsmaller, ornamenting the interior.\r\n\r\n_Evening Dress_ of white _tulle_, worn over a _jape_ of rich pink satin;\r\nthe waist and point of a moderate length; the sleeves and front of the\r\ncorsage covered with fullings of _tulle_, clasped at equal distances by\r\nnarrow bands of green satin; the skirt extremely full, and looped up on\r\neach side; the trimming, which reaches from the waist on each side the\r\npoint to the bottom of the skirt, composed of loops of green satin\r\nribbon edged with gold. Magnificent ribbons or beautiful flowers\r\naccompany the light trimmings which ornament the lighter evening\r\ndresses. A young lady is never more beautiful than when dressed in one\r\nof those robes, so rich in their simplicity, and distinguished by their\r\nembroideries, form, and trimmings. A robe of tarlatane, trimmed with\r\nseven flounces, deeply scalloped and worked with straw colored silk, is\r\nmuch in vogue. The same trimming, proportionably narrow, covers the\r\nberthe and sleeves. When worked with white silk, this dress is still\r\nmore stylish. White or black lace canezous, worn with low-bodied silk\r\ndresses, are very much admired. They are open over the chest, and more\r\nor less worn with basques or straight trimmings round the waist, with\r\nhalf long sleeves, fastened up on the front, for the arm, by a ribbon\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n_Dress Hats_ are principally made of _tulle_ or gauze _lisse_--those of\r\nthe latter texture, made in white, of folds with rows of white gauze\r\nribbon.",
