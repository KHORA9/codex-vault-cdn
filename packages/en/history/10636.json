I can give him no higher praise than to say\r\nthat he has laboured in Yule’s own spirit.\r\n\r\nThe slight Memoir which I have contributed (for which I accept all\r\nresponsibility), attempts no more than a rough sketch of my father’s\r\ncharacter and career, but it will, I hope, serve to recall pleasantly\r\nhis remarkable individuality to the few remaining who knew him in his\r\nprime, whilst it may also afford some idea of the man, and his work and\r\nenvironment, to those who had not that advantage.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more conscious than myself of its many shortcomings,\r\nwhich I will not attempt to excuse. I can, however, honestly say that\r\nthese have not been due to negligence, but are rather the blemishes\r\nalmost inseparable from the fulfilment under the gloom of bereavement\r\nand amidst the pressure of other duties, of a task undertaken in more\r\nfavourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of all defects, I believe this sketch to be such\r\na record as my father would himself have approved, and I know also that\r\nhe would have chosen my hand to write it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may note that the first edition of this work was\r\ndedicated to that very noble lady, the Queen (then Crown Princess)\r\nMargherita of Italy. In the second edition the Dedication was\r\nreproduced within brackets (as also the original preface), but not\r\nrenewed. That precedent is again followed.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, felt at liberty to associate the present edition\r\nof my father’s work with the Name MURCHISON, which for more than a\r\ngeneration was the name most generally representative of British\r\nScience in Foreign Lands, as of Foreign Science in Britain.\r\n\r\n                                                          A. F. YULE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did I think, some thirty years ago, when I received a copy\r\nof the first edition of this grand work, that I should be one day\r\nentrusted with the difficult but glorious task of supervising the\r\nthird edition. When the first edition of the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_\r\nreached “Far Cathay,” it created quite a stir in the small circle\r\nof the learned foreigners, who then resided there, and became a\r\nstarting-point for many researches, of which the results have been\r\nmade use of partly in the second edition, and partly in the present.\r\nThe Archimandrite PALLADIUS and Dr. E. BRETSCHNEIDER, at Peking, ALEX.\r\nWYLIE, at Shang-hai—friends of mine who have, alas! passed away, with\r\nthe exception of the Right Rev. Bishop G. E. MOULE, of Hang-chau, the\r\nonly survivor of this little group of hard-working scholars,—were the\r\nfirst to explore the Chinese sources of information which were to yield\r\na rich harvest into their hands.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home from China in 1876, I was introduced to Colonel\r\nHENRY YULE, at the India Office, by our common friend, Dr. REINHOLD\r\nROST, and from that time we met frequently and kept up a correspondence\r\nwhich terminated only with the life of the great geographer, whose\r\nfriend I had become. A new edition of the travels of Friar Odoric\r\nof Pordenone, our “mutual friend,” in which Yule had taken the\r\ngreatest interest, was dedicated by me to his memory. I knew that Yule\r\ncontemplated a third edition of his _Marco Polo_, and all will regret\r\nthat time was not allowed to him to complete this labour of love, to\r\nsee it published. If the duty of bringing out the new edition of _Marco\r\nPolo_ has fallen on one who considers himself but an unworthy successor\r\nof the first illustrious commentator, it is fair to add that the work\r\ncould not have been entrusted to a more respectful disciple. Many of\r\nour tastes were similar; we had the same desire to seek the truth,\r\nthe same earnest wish to be exact, perhaps the same sense of humour,\r\nand, what is necessary when writing on Marco Polo, certainly the same\r\nlove for Venice and its history. Not only am I, with the late CHARLES\r\nSCHEFER, the founder and the editor of the _Recueil de Voyages et de\r\nDocuments pour servir à l’Histoire de la Géographie depuis le XIIIᵉ\r\njusqu’à la fin du XVIᵉ siècle_, but I am also the successor, at the\r\nÉcole des langues Orientales Vivantes, of G. PAUTHIER, whose book on\r\nthe Venetian Traveller is still valuable, so the mantle of the last two\r\neditors fell upon my shoulders.\r\n\r\nI therefore, gladly and thankfully, accepted Miss AMY FRANCIS YULE’S\r\nkind proposal to undertake the editorship of the third edition of the\r\n_Book of Ser Marco Polo_, and I wish to express here my gratitude to\r\nher for the great honour she has thus done me.[1]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his successor, Sir Henry Yule, evidently trusting\r\nto his own good memory, left but few notes. These are contained in an\r\ninterleaved copy obligingly placed at my disposal by Miss Yule, but I\r\nluckily found assistance from various other quarters. The following\r\nworks have proved of the greatest assistance to me:—The articles of\r\nGeneral HOUTUM-SCHINDLER in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_,\r\nand the excellent books of Lord CURZON and of Major P. MOLESWORTH\r\nSYKES on Persia, M. GRENARD’S account of DUTREUIL de RHINS’ Mission\r\nto Central Asia, BRETSCHNEIDER’S and PALLADIUS’ remarkable papers\r\non Mediæval Travellers and Geography, and above all, the valuable\r\nbooks of the Hon. W. W. ROCKHILL on Tibet and Rubruck, to which the\r\ndistinguished diplomatist, traveller, and scholar kindly added a list\r\nof notes of the greatest importance to me, for which I offer him my\r\nhearty thanks.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are also due to H.H. Prince ROLAND BONAPARTE, who kindly\r\ngave me permission to reproduce some of the plates of his _Recueil\r\nde Documents de l’Époque Mongole_, to M. LÉOPOLD DELISLE, the\r\nlearned Principal Librarian of the Bibliothèque Nationale, who gave\r\nme the opportunity to study the inventory made after the death of\r\nthe Doge Marino Faliero, to the Count de SEMALLÉ, formerly French\r\nChargé d’Affaires at Peking, who gave me for reproduction a number\r\nof photographs from his valuable personal collection, and last, not\r\nleast, my old friend Comm. NICOLÒ BAROZZI, who continued to lend me the\r\nassistance which he had formerly rendered to Sir Henry Yule at Venice.\r\n\r\nSince the last edition was published, more than twenty-five years\r\nago, Persia has been more thoroughly studied; new routes have been\r\nexplored in Central Asia, Karakorum has been fully described, and\r\nWestern and South-Western China have been opened up to our knowledge\r\nin many directions. The results of these investigations form the main\r\nfeatures of this new edition of _Marco Polo_. I have suppressed hardly\r\nany of Sir Henry Yule’s notes and altered but few, doing so only when\r\nthe light of recent information has proved him to be in error, but\r\nI have supplemented them by what, I hope, will be found useful, new\r\ninformation.[2]\r\n\r\nBefore I take leave of the kind reader, I wish to thank sincerely Mr.\r\nJOHN MURRAY for the courtesy and the care he has displayed while this\r\nedition was going through the press.\r\n\r\n                                                       HENRI CORDIER.\r\n  PARIS, _1st of October, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Miss Yule has written the Memoir of her father and the new\r\n    Dedication.\r\n\r\n[2] Paragraphs which have been altered are marked thus ✛; my own\r\n    additions are placed between brackets [ ].—H. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    “=Now strike your Sailes yee jolly Mariners,\r\n    For we be come into a quiet Rode=”....\r\n\r\n                          —THE FAERIE QUEENE, I. xii. 42.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unexpected amount of favour bestowed on the former edition of this\r\nWork has been a great encouragement to the Editor in preparing this\r\nsecond one.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the kind friends and correspondents who lent their aid\r\nbefore have continued it to the present revision. The contributions\r\nof Mr. A. WYLIE of Shang-hai, whether as regards the amount of labour\r\nwhich they must have cost him, or the value of the result, demand\r\nabove all others a grateful record here. Nor can I omit to name again\r\nwith hearty acknowledgment Signor Comm. G. BERCHET of Venice, the Rev.\r\nDr. CALDWELL, Colonel (now Major-General) R. MACLAGAN, R.E., Mr. D.\r\nHANBURY, F.R.S., Mr. EDWARD THOMAS, F.R.S. (Corresponding Member of the\r\nInstitute), and Mr. R. H. MAJOR.\r\n\r\nBut besides these old names, not a few new ones claim my thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Baron F. VON RICHTHOFEN, now President of the Geographical Society\r\nof Berlin, a traveller who not only has trodden many hundreds of miles\r\nin the footsteps of our Marco, but has perhaps travelled over more of\r\nthe Interior of China than Marco ever did, and who carried to that\r\nsurvey high scientific accomplishments of which the Venetian had not\r\neven a rudimentary conception, has spontaneously opened his bountiful\r\nstores of new knowledge in my behalf. Mr. NEY ELIAS, who in 1872\r\ntraversed and mapped a line of upwards of 2000 miles through the almost\r\nunknown tracts of Western Mongolia, from the Gate in the Great Wall at\r\nKalghan to the Russian frontier in the Altai, has done likewise.[1] To\r\nthe Rev. G. MOULE, of the Church Mission at Hang-chau, I owe a mass\r\nof interesting matter regarding that once great and splendid city,\r\nthe KINSAY of our Traveller, which has enabled me, I trust, to effect\r\ngreat improvement both in the Notes and in the Map, which illustrate\r\nthat subject. And to the Rev. CARSTAIRS DOUGLAS, LL.D., of the English\r\nPresbyterian Mission at Amoy, I am scarcely less indebted. The learned\r\nProfessor BRUUN, of Odessa, whom I never have seen, and have little\r\nlikelihood of ever seeing in this world, has aided me with zeal and\r\ncordiality like that of old friendship. To Mr. ARTHUR BURNELL, Ph.D.,\r\nof the Madras Civil Service, I am grateful for many valuable notes\r\nbearing on these and other geographical studies, and particularly for\r\nhis generous communication of the drawing and photograph of the ancient\r\nCross at St. Thomas’s Mount, long before any publication of that\r\nsubject was made on his own account. My brother officer, Major OLIVER\r\nST. JOHN, R.E., has favoured me with a variety of interesting remarks\r\nregarding the Persian chapters, and has assisted me with new data, very\r\nmaterially correcting the Itinerary Map in Kerman.\r\n\r\nMr. BLOCHMANN of the Calcutta Madrasa, Sir DOUGLAS FORSYTH, C.B.,\r\nlately Envoy to Kashgar, M. de MAS LATRIE, the Historian of Cyprus,\r\nMr. ARTHUR GROTE, Mr. EUGENE SCHUYLER of the U.S. Legation at St.\r\nPetersburg, Dr. BUSHELL and Mr. W. F. MAYERS, of H.M.’s Legation at\r\nPeking, Mr. G. PHILLIPS of Fuchau, Madame OLGA FEDTCHENKO, the widow of\r\na great traveller too early lost to the world, Colonel KEATINGE, V.C.,\r\nC.S.I., Major-General KEYES, C.B., Dr. GEORGE BIRDWOOD, Mr. BURGESS, of\r\nBombay, my old and valued friend Colonel W. H. GREATHED, C.B., and the\r\nMaster of Mediæval Geography, M. D’AVEZAC himself, with others besides,\r\nhave kindly lent assistance of one kind or another, several of them\r\nspontaneously, and the rest in prompt answer to my requests.\r\n\r\nHaving always attached much importance to the matter of\r\nillustrations,[2] I feel greatly indebted to the liberal action of Mr.\r\nMurray in enabling me largely to increase their number in this edition.\r\nThough many are original, we have also borrowed a good many;[3]\r\na proceeding which seems to me entirely unobjectionable when the\r\nengravings are truly illustrative of the text, and not hackneyed.\r\n\r\nI regret the augmented bulk of the volumes. There has been some\r\nexcision, but the additions visibly and palpably preponderate. The\r\ntruth is that since the completion of the first edition, just four\r\nyears ago, large additions have been made to the stock of our knowledge\r\nbearing on the subjects of this Book; and how these additions have\r\ncontinued to come in up to the last moment, may be seen in Appendix\r\nL,[4] which has had to undergo repeated interpolation after being put\r\nin type. KARAKORUM, for a brief space the seat of the widest empire\r\nthe world has known, has been visited; the ruins of SHANG-TU, the\r\n“Xanadu of Cublay Khan,” have been explored; PAMIR and TANGUT have been\r\npenetrated from side to side; the famous mountain Road of SHEN-SI has\r\nbeen traversed and described; the mysterious CAINDU has been unveiled;\r\nthe publication of my lamented friend Lieutenant Garnier’s great\r\nwork on the French Exploration of Indo-China has provided a mass of\r\nillustration of that YUN-NAN for which but the other day Marco Polo\r\nwas well-nigh the most recent authority. Nay, the last two years have\r\nthrown a promise of light even on what seemed the wildest of Marco’s\r\nstories, and the bones of a veritable RUC from New Zealand lie on the\r\ntable of Professor Owen’s Cabinet!\r\n\r\nM. VIVIEN de St. MARTIN, during the interval of which we have been\r\nspeaking, has published a History of Geography. In treating of Marco\r\nPolo, he alludes to the first edition of this work, most evidently with\r\nno intention of disparagement, but speaks of it as merely a revision\r\nof Marsden’s Book. The last thing I should allow myself to do would be\r\nto apply to a Geographer, whose works I hold in so much esteem, the\r\ndisrespectful definition which the adage quoted in my former Preface[5]\r\ngives of the _vir qui docet quod non sapit_; but I feel bound to say\r\nthat on this occasion M. Vivien de St. Martin has permitted himself to\r\npronounce on a matter with which he had not made himself acquainted;\r\nfor the perusal of the very first lines of the Preface (I will say\r\nnothing of the Book) would have shown him that such a notion was\r\nutterly unfounded.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these “forewords” I am probably taking leave of Marco\r\nPolo,[6] the companion of many pleasant and some laborious hours,\r\nwhilst I have been contemplating with him (“_vôlti a levante_”) that\r\nOrient in which I also had spent years not a few.\r\n\r\n                     •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nAnd as the writer lingered over this conclusion, his thoughts wandered\r\nback in reverie to those many venerable libraries in which he had\r\nformerly made search for mediæval copies of the Traveller’s story;\r\nand it seemed to him as if he sate in a recess of one of these with\r\na manuscript before him which had never till then been examined with\r\nany care, and which he found with delight to contain passages that\r\nappear in no version of the Book hitherto known. It was written in\r\nclear Gothic text, and in the Old French tongue of the early 14th\r\ncentury. Was it possible that he had lighted on the long-lost original\r\nof Ramusio’s Version? No; it proved to be different. Instead of the\r\ntedious story of the northern wars, which occupies much of our Fourth\r\nBook, there were passages occurring in the later history of Ser Marco,\r\nsome years after his release from the Genoese captivity. They appeared\r\nto contain strange anachronisms certainly; but we have often had\r\noccasion to remark on puzzles in the chronology of Marco’s story![7]\r\nAnd in some respects they tended to justify our intimated suspicion\r\nthat he was a man of deeper feelings and wider sympathies than the book\r\nof Rusticiano had allowed to appear.[8] Perhaps this time the Traveller\r\nhad found an amanuensis whose faculties had not been stiffened by\r\nfifteen years of Malapaga?[9] One of the most important passages ran\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n  “_Bien est voirs que, après ce que |Messires Marc Pol| avoit pris\r\n  fame et si estoit demouré plusours ans de sa vie a |Venysse|, il\r\n  avint que mourut |Messires Mafés| qui oncles |Monseignour Marc|\r\n  estoit: (et mourut ausi ses granz chiens mastins qu’avoit amenei\r\n  dou Catai,[10] et qui avoit non |Bayan| pour l’amour au bon\r\n  chievetain |Bayan Cent-iex|); adonc n’avoit oncques puis |Messires\r\n  Marc| nullui, fors son esclave |Piere le Tartar|, avecques lequel\r\n  pouvoit penre soulas à s’entretenir de ses voiages et des choses\r\n  dou Levant.

Negri. Strongly as\r\n    I feel the too generous appreciation of these labours implied\r\n    in such awards, I confess to have been yet more deeply touched\r\n    and gratified by practical evidence of the approval of the two\r\n    distinguished Travellers mentioned above; as shown by Baron von\r\n    Richthofen in his spontaneous proposal to publish a German version\r\n    of the book under his own immediate supervision (a project in\r\n    abeyance, owing to circumstances beyond his or my control); by Mr.\r\n    Ney Elias in the fact of his having carried these ponderous volumes\r\n    with him on his solitary journey across the Mongolian wilds!\r\n\r\n[2] I am grateful to Mr. de Khanikoff for his especial recognition of\r\n    these in a kindly review of the first edition in the _Academy_.\r\n\r\n[3] Especially from Lieutenant Garnier’s book, mentioned further on;\r\n    the only existing source of illustration for many chapters of Polo.\r\n\r\n[4] [Merged into the notes of the present edition.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[5] See page xxix.\r\n\r\n[6] Writing in Italy, perhaps I ought to write, according to too\r\n    prevalent modern Italian custom, _Polo Marco_. I have already\r\n    _seen_, and in the work of a writer of reputation, the Alexandrian\r\n    geographer styled _Tolomeo Claudio_! and if this preposterous\r\n    fashion should continue to spread, we shall in time have _Tasso\r\n    Torquato_, _Jonson Ben_, Africa explored by _Park Mungo_, Asia\r\n    conquered by _Lane Tamer_, Copperfield David by _Dickens Charles_,\r\n    Homer Englished by _Pope Alexander_, and the Roman history done\r\n    into French from the original of _Live Tite_!\r\n\r\n[7] Introduction p. _24_, and _passim_ in the notes.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._, p. _112_.\r\n\r\n[9] See Introduction, pp. _51_, _57_.\r\n\r\n[10] See Title of present volumes.\r\n\r\n[11] Which quite agrees with the story of the document quoted at p.\r\n    _77_ of Introduction.\r\n\r\n[12] Vol. i. p. 64, and p. 67.\r\n\r\n[13] _I.e._ 1306; see Introduction, pp. _68–69_.\r\n\r\n[14] The form which Marco gives to this word was probably a\r\n    reminiscence of the Oriental corruption _failsúf_. It recalls to\r\n    my mind a Hindu who was very fond of the word, and especially of\r\n    applying it to certain of his fellow-servants. But as he used it,\r\n    _bara failsúf_,—“great philosopher”—meant exactly the same as the\r\n    modern slang “_Artful Dodger_”!\r\n\r\n[15] See for the explanation of _Karma_, “the power that controls the\r\n    universe,” in the doctrine of atheistic Buddhism, Hardy’s _Eastern\r\n    Monachism_, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[16] Vol. ii. p. 316 (see also i. 348).\r\n\r\n[17] Vol. ii. pp. 318–319.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ORIGINAL PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of appropriate material, and of acquaintance with the\r\nmediæval geography of some parts of Asia, which was acquired during the\r\ncompilation of a work of kindred character for the Hakluyt Society,[1]\r\ncould hardly fail to suggest as a fresh labour in the same field\r\nthe preparation of a new English edition of Marco Polo. Indeed one\r\nkindly critic (in the _Examiner_) laid it upon the writer as a duty to\r\nundertake that task.\r\n\r\nThough at least one respectable English edition has appeared since\r\nMarsden’s,[2] the latter has continued to be the standard edition, and\r\nmaintains not only its reputation but its market value. It is indeed\r\nthe work of a sagacious, learned, and right-minded man, which can never\r\nbe spoken of otherwise than with respect. But since Marsden published\r\nhis quarto (1818) vast stores of new knowledge have become available\r\nin elucidation both of the contents of Marco Polo’s book and of its\r\nliterary history. The works of writers such as Klaproth, Abel Rémusat,\r\nD’Avezac, Reinaud, Quatremère, Julien, I. J. Schmidt, Gildemeister,\r\nRitter, Hammer-Purgstall, Erdmann, D’Ohsson, Defrémery, Elliot,\r\nErskine, and many more, which throw light directly or incidentally\r\non Marco Polo, have, for the most part, appeared since then. Nor, as\r\nregards the literary history of the book, were any just views possible\r\nat a time when what may be called the _Fontal_ MSS. (in French) were\r\nunpublished and unexamined.\r\n\r\nBesides the works which have thus occasionally or incidentally\r\nthrown light upon the Traveller’s book, various editions of the book\r\nitself have since Marsden’s time been published in foreign countries,\r\naccompanied by comments of more or less value. All have contributed\r\nsomething to the illustration of the book or its history; the last and\r\nmost learned of the editors, M. Pauthier, has so contributed in large\r\nmeasure. I had occasion some years ago[3] to speak freely my opinion\r\nof the merits and demerits of M. Pauthier’s work; and to the latter at\r\nleast I have no desire to recur here.\r\n\r\nAnother of his critics, a much more accomplished as well as more\r\nfavourable one,[4] seems to intimate the opinion that there would\r\nscarcely be room in future for new commentaries. Something of the\r\nkind was said of Marsden’s at the time of its publication. I imagine,\r\nhowever, that whilst our libraries endure the _Iliad_ will continue\r\nto find new translators, and Marco Polo—though one hopes not so\r\nplentifully—new editors.\r\n\r\nThe justification of the book’s existence must however be looked\r\nfor, and it is hoped may be found, in the book itself, and not in\r\nthe Preface. The work claims to be judged as a whole, but it may be\r\nallowable, in these days of scanty leisure, to indicate below a few\r\ninstances of what is believed to be new matter in an edition of Marco\r\nPolo; by which however it is by no means intended that all such matter\r\nis claimed by the editor as his own.[5]\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the work it was felt that the task was\r\none which no man, though he were far better equipped and much more\r\nconveniently situated than the present writer, could satisfactorily\r\naccomplish from his own resources, and help was sought on special\r\npoints wherever it seemed likely to be found. In scarcely any quarter\r\nwas the application made in vain. Some who have aided most materially\r\nare indeed very old and valued friends; but to many others who have\r\ndone the same the applicant was unknown; and some of these again, with\r\nwhom the editor began correspondence on this subject as a stranger, he\r\nis happy to think that he may now call friends.\r\n\r\nTo none am I more indebted than to the Comm. GUGLIELMO BERCHET, of\r\nVenice, for his ample, accurate, and generous assistance in furnishing\r\nme with Venetian documents, and in many other ways. Especial thanks\r\nare also due to Dr. WILLIAM LOCKHART, who has supplied the materials\r\nfor some of the most valuable illustrations; to Lieutenant FRANCIS\r\nGARNIER, of the French Navy, the gallant and accomplished leader\r\n(after the death of Captain Doudart de la Grée) of the memorable\r\nexpedition up the Mekong to Yun-nan; to the Rev.

He was named after an _aunt_ who, like Miss Ferrier’s\r\nimmortal heroine, owned a man’s name.\r\n\r\nOn his father’s side he came of a hardy agricultural stock,[1] improved\r\nby a graft from that highly-cultured tree, Rose of Kilravock.[2]\r\nThrough his mother, a somewhat prosaic person herself, he inherited\r\nstrains from Huguenot and Highland ancestry. There were recognisable\r\ntraces of all these elements in Henry Yule, and as was well said\r\nby one of his oldest friends: “He was one of those curious racial\r\ncompounds one finds on the east side of Scotland, in whom the hard\r\nTeutonic grit is sweetened by the artistic spirit of the more genial\r\nCelt.”[3] His father, an officer of the Bengal army (born 1764, died\r\n1839), was a man of cultivated tastes and enlightened mind, a good\r\nPersian and Arabic scholar, and possessed of much miscellaneous\r\nOriental learning. During the latter years of his career in India, he\r\nserved successively as Assistant Resident at the (then independent)\r\ncourts of Lucknow[4] and Delhi. In the latter office his chief was the\r\nnoble Ouchterlony. William Yule, together with his younger brother\r\nUdny,[5] returned home in 1806. “A recollection of their voyage was\r\nthat they hailed an outward bound ship, somewhere off the Cape, through\r\nthe trumpet: ‘What news?’ Answer: ‘The King’s mad, and Humfrey’s beat\r\nMendoza’ (two celebrated prize-fighters and often matched). ‘Nothing\r\nmore?’ ‘Yes, Bonapart_y_’s made his _Mother_ King of Holland!’\r\n\r\n“Before his retirement, William Yule was offered the\r\nLieut.-Governorship of St. Helena. Two of the detailed privileges\r\nof the office were residence at Longwood (afterwards the house of\r\nNapoleon), and the use of a certain number of the Company’s slaves.\r\nMajor Yule, who was a strong supporter of the anti-slavery cause\r\ntill its triumph in 1834, often recalled both of these offers with\r\namusement.”[6]\r\n\r\nWilliam Yule was a man of generous chivalrous nature, who took large\r\nviews of life, apt to be unfairly stigmatised as Radical in the narrow\r\nTory reaction that prevailed in Scotland during the early years of the\r\n19th century.[7] Devoid of literary ambition, he wrote much for his\r\nprivate pleasure, and his knowledge and library (rich in Persian and\r\nArabic MSS.) were always placed freely at the service of his friends\r\nand correspondents, some of whom, such as Major C. Stewart and Mr.\r\nWilliam Erskine, were more given to publication than himself. He never\r\ntravelled without a little 8vo MS. of Hafiz, which often lay under his\r\npillow. Major Yule’s only printed work was a lithographed edition of\r\nthe _Apothegms_ of ’Ali, the son of Abu Talib, in the Arabic, with an\r\nold Persian version and an English translation interpolated by himself.\r\n“This was privately issued in 1832, when the Duchesse d’Angoulême was\r\nliving at Edinburgh, and the little work was inscribed to her, with\r\nwhom an accident of neighbourhood and her kindness to the Major’s\r\nyoungest child had brought him into relations of goodwill.”[8]\r\n\r\nHenry Yule’s childhood was mainly spent at Inveresk. He used to say\r\nthat his earliest recollection was sitting with the little cousin,\r\nwho long after became his wife, on the doorstep of her father’s house\r\nin George Street, Edinburgh (now the Northern Club), listening to the\r\nperformance of a passing piper. There was another episode which he\r\nrecalled with humorous satisfaction. Fired by his father’s tales of\r\nthe jungle, Yule (then about six years old) proceeded to improvise an\r\nelephant pit in the back garden, only too successfully, for soon, with\r\nmingled terror and delight, he saw his uncle John[9] fall headlong\r\ninto the snare. He lost his mother before he was eight, and almost his\r\nonly remembrance of her was the circumstance of her having given him\r\na little lantern to light him home on winter nights from his first\r\nschool. On Sundays it was the Major’s custom to lend his children,\r\nas a picture-book, a folio Arabic translation of the Four Gospels,\r\nprinted at Rome in 1591, which contained excellent illustrations from\r\nItalian originals.[10] Of the pictures in this volume Yule seems never\r\nto have tired. The last page bore a MS. note in Latin to the effect\r\nthat the volume had been read in the Chaldæan Desert by _Georgius\r\nStrachanus_, _Milnensis_, _Scotus_, who long remained unidentified, not\r\nto say mythical, in Yule’s mind. But George Strachan never passed from\r\nhis memory, and having ultimately run him to earth, Yule, sixty years\r\nlater, published the results in an interesting article.[11]\r\n\r\nTwo or three years after his wife’s death, Major Yule removed to\r\nEdinburgh, and established himself in Regent’s Terrace, on the face\r\nof the Calton Hill.[12] This continued to be Yule’s home until his\r\nfather’s death, shortly before he went to India. “Here he learned to\r\nlove the wide scenes of sea and land spread out around that hill—a\r\nlove he never lost, at home or far away. And long years after, with\r\nbeautiful Sicilian hills before him and a lovely sea, he writes words\r\nof fond recollection of the bleak Fife hills, and the grey Firth of\r\nForth.”[13]\r\n\r\nYule now followed his elder brother, Robert, to the famous High School,\r\nand in the summer holidays the two made expeditions to the West\r\nHighlands, the Lakes of Cumberland, and elsewhere. Major Yule chose his\r\nboys to have every reasonable indulgence and advantage, and when the\r\nBritish Association, in 1834, held its first Edinburgh meeting, Henry\r\nreceived a member’s ticket. So, too, when the passing of the Reform\r\nBill was celebrated in the same year by a great banquet, at which Lord\r\nGrey and other prominent politicians were present, Henry was sent to\r\nthe dinner, probably the youngest guest there.[14]\r\n\r\nAt this time the intention was that Henry should go to Cambridge (where\r\nhis name was, indeed, entered), and after taking his degree study for\r\nthe Bar. With this view he was, in 1833, sent to Waith, near Ripon, to\r\nbe coached by the Rev. H. P. Hamilton, author of a well-known treatise,\r\n_On Conic Sections_, and afterwards Dean of Salisbury. At his tutor’s\r\nhospitable rectory Yule met many notabilities of the day. One of them\r\nwas Professor Sedgwick.\r\n\r\nThere was rumoured at this time the discovery of the first known (?)\r\nfossil monkey, but its tail was missing. “Depend upon it, Daniel\r\nO’Conell’s got hold of it!” said ‘Adam’ briskly.[15] Yule was very\r\nhappy with Mr. Hamilton and his kind wife, but on his tutor’s removal\r\nto Cambridge other arrangements became necessary, and in 1835 he was\r\ntransferred to the care of the Rev. James Challis, rector of Papworth\r\nSt. Everard, a place which “had little to recommend it except a\r\ndulness which made reading almost a necessity.”[16] Mr. Challis had at\r\nthis time two other resident pupils, who both, in most diverse ways,\r\nattained distinction in the Church. These were John Mason Neale, the\r\nfuture eminent ecclesiologist and founder of the devoted Anglican\r\nSisterhood of St. Margaret, and Harvey Goodwin, long afterwards the\r\nstudious and large-minded Bishop of Carlisle. With the latter, Yule\r\nremained on terms of cordial friendship to the end of his life. Looking\r\nback through more than fifty years to these boyish days, Bishop Goodwin\r\nwrote that Yule then “showed much more liking for Greek plays and for\r\nGerman than for mathematics, though he had considerable geometrical\r\ningenuity.”[17] On one occasion, having solved a problem that puzzled\r\nGoodwin, Yule thus discriminated the attainments of the three pupils:\r\n“The difference between you and me is this: You like it and can’t do\r\nit; I don’t like it and can do it. Neale neither likes it nor can do\r\nit.” Not bad criticism for a boy of fifteen.[18]\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Challis being appointed Plumerian Professor at Cambridge, in the\r\nspring of 1836, Yule had to leave him, owing to want of room at the\r\nObservatory, and he became for a time, a most dreary time, he said, a\r\nstudent at University College, London.\r\n\r\nBy this time Yule had made up his mind that not London and the Law,\r\nbut India and the Army should be his choice, and accordingly in Feb.\r\n1837 he joined the East India Company’s Military College at Addiscombe.\r\nFrom Addiscombe he passed out, in December 1838, at the head of the\r\ncadets of his term (taking the prize sword[19]), and having been duly\r\nappointed to the Bengal Engineers, proceeded early in 1839 to the\r\nHeadquarters of the Royal Engineers at Chatham, where, according to\r\ncustom, he was enrolled as a “local and temporary Ensign.” For such\r\nwas then the invidious designation at Chatham of the young Engineer\r\nofficers of the Indian army, who ranked as full lieutenants in their\r\nown Service, from the time of leaving Addiscombe.[20] Yule once\r\naudaciously tackled the formidable Pasley on this very grievance. The\r\nvenerable Director, after a minute’s pondering, replied: “Well, I don’t\r\nremember what the reason was, but I have _no_ doubt (_staccato_) it ...\r\nwas ... a very ... _good_ reason.”[21]\r\n\r\n“When Yule appeared among us at Chatham in 1839,” said his friend\r\nCollinson, “he at once took a prominent place in our little Society by\r\nhis slightly advanced age [he was then 18½], but more by his strong\r\ncharacter.... His earlier education ... gave him a better classical\r\nknowledge than most of us possessed; then he had the reserve and\r\nself-possession characteristic of his race; but though he took small\r\npart in the games and other recreations of our time, his knowledge,\r\nhis native humour, and his good comradeship, and especially his strong\r\nsense of right and wrong, made him both admired and respected.... Yule\r\nwas not a scientific engineer, though he had a good general knowledge\r\nof the different branches of his profession; his natural capacity lay\r\nrather in varied knowledge, combined with a strong understanding and\r\nan excellent memory, and also a peculiar power as a draughtsman, which\r\nproved of great value in after life.... Those were nearly the last\r\ndays of the old _régime_, of the orthodox double sap and cylindrical\r\npontoons, when Pasley’s genius had been leading to new ideas, and when\r\nLintorn Simmons’ power, G. Leach’s energy, W. Jervois’ skill, and\r\nR. Tylden’s talent were developing under the wise example of Henry\r\nHarness.”[22]\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Engineer mess of those days (the present anteroom), the\r\nportrait of Henry Yule now faces that of his first chief, Sir Henry\r\nHarness. General Collinson said that the pictures appeared to eye each\r\nother as if the subjects were continuing one of those friendly disputes\r\nin which they so often engaged.[23]\r\n\r\nIt was in this room that Yule, Becher, Collinson, and other young\r\nR.E.’s, profiting by the temporary absence of the austere Colonel\r\nPasley, acted some plays, including _Pizarro_. Yule bore the humble\r\npart of one of the Peruvian Mob in this performance, of which he has\r\nleft a droll account.[24]\r\n\r\nOn the completion of his year at Chatham, Yule prepared to sail for\r\nIndia, but first went to take leave of his relative, General White. An\r\naccident prolonged his stay, and before he left he had proposed to and\r\nbeen refused by his cousin Annie. This occurrence, his first check,\r\nseems to have cast rather a gloom over his start for India. He went\r\nby the then newly-opened Overland Route, visiting Portugal, stopping\r\nat Gibraltar to see his cousin, Major (afterwards General) Patrick\r\nYule, R.E.[25] He was under orders “to stop at Aden (then recently\r\nacquired), to report on the water supply, and to deliver a set of\r\nmeteorological and magnetic instruments for starting an observatory\r\nthere. The overland journey then really meant so; tramping across the\r\ndesert to Suez with camels and Arabs, a proceeding not conducive to the\r\npreservation of delicate instruments; and on arriving at Aden he found\r\nthat the intended observer was dead, the observatory not commenced, and\r\nthe instruments all broken. There was thus nothing left for him but to\r\ngo on at once” to Calcutta,[26] where he arrived at the end of 1840.\r\n\r\nHis first service lay in the then wild Khasia Hills, whither he was\r\ndetached for the purpose of devising means for the transport of the\r\nlocal coal to the plains. In spite of the depressing character of\r\nthe climate (Cherrapunjee boasts the highest rainfall on record),\r\nYule thoroughly enjoyed himself, and always looked back with special\r\npleasure on the time he spent here. He was unsuccessful in the object\r\nof his mission, the obstacles to cheap transport offered by the dense\r\nforests and mighty precipices proving insurmountable, but he gathered\r\na wealth of interesting observations on the country and people, a\r\nvery primitive Mongolian race, which he subsequently embodied in two\r\nexcellent and most interesting papers (the first he ever published).[27]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1842, Yule was transferred to the irrigation\r\ncanals of the north-west with head-quarters at Kurnaul. Here he had\r\nfor chief Captain (afterwards General Sir William) Baker, who became\r\nhis dearest and most steadfast friend. Early in 1843 Yule had his\r\nfirst experience of field service. The death without heir of the\r\nKhytul Rajah, followed by the refusal of his family to surrender the\r\nplace to the native troops sent to receive it, obliged Government to\r\nsend a larger force against it, and the canal officers were ordered\r\nto join this. Yule was detailed to serve under Captain Robert Napier\r\n(afterwards F.-M. Lord Napier of Magdala). Their immediate duty was to\r\nmark out the route for a night march of the troops, barring access to\r\nall side roads, and neither officer having then had any experience of\r\nwar, they performed the duty “with all the elaborate care of novices.”\r\nSuddenly there was an alarm, a light detected, and a night attack\r\nawaited, when the danger resolved itself into Clerk Sahib’s _khansamah_\r\nwith welcome hot coffee![28] Their hopes were disappointed, there\r\nwas no fighting, and the Fort of Khytul was found deserted by the\r\nenemy. It “was a strange scene of confusion—all the paraphernalia and\r\naccumulation of odds and ends of a wealthy native family lying about\r\nand inviting loot. I remember one beautiful crutch-stick of ebony with\r\ntwo rams’ heads in jade. I took it and sent it in to the political\r\nauthority, intending to buy it when sold. There was a sale, but my\r\nstick never appeared. Somebody had a more developed taste in jade....\r\nAmid the general rummage that was going on, an officer of British\r\nInfantry had been put over a part of the palace supposed to contain\r\ntreasure, and they—officers and all—were helping themselves. Henry\r\nLawrence was one of the politicals under George Clerk. When the news of\r\nthis affair came to him I was present. It was in a white marble loggia\r\nin the palace, where was a white marble chair or throne on a basement.\r\nLawrence was sitting on this throne in great excitement. He wore an\r\nAfghan _choga_, a sort of dressing-gown garment, and this, and his thin\r\nlocks, and thin beard were streaming in the wind. He always dwells in\r\nmy memory as a sort of pythoness on her tripod under the afflatus.”[29]\r\n\r\nDuring his Indian service, Yule had renewed and continued by letters\r\nhis suit to Miss White, and persistency prevailing at last, he soon\r\nafter the conclusion of the Khytul affair applied for leave to go home\r\nto be married. He sailed from Bombay in May, 1843, and in September of\r\nthe same year was married, at Bath, to the gifted and large-hearted\r\nwoman who, to the end, remained the strongest and happiest influence in\r\nhis life.[30]\r\n\r\nYule sailed for India with his wife in November 1843. The next two\r\nyears were employed chiefly in irrigation work, and do not call\r\nfor special note. They were very happy years, except in the one\r\ncircumstance that the climate having seriously affected his wife’s\r\nhealth, and she having been brought to death’s door, partly by illness,\r\nbut still more by the drastic medical treatment of those days, she was\r\nimperatively ordered back to England by the doctors, who forbade her\r\nreturn to India.\r\n\r\nHaving seen her on board ship, Yule returned to duty on the canals.\r\nThe close of that year, December, 1845, brought some variety to his\r\nwork, as the outbreak of the first Sikh War called nearly all the\r\ncanal officers into the field. “They went up to the front by long\r\nmarches, passing through no stations, and quite unable to obtain any\r\nnews of what had occurred, though on the 21st December the guns of\r\nFerozshah were distinctly heard in their camp at Pehoa, at a distance\r\nof 115 miles south-east from the field, and some days later they came\r\nsuccessively on the fields of Moodkee and of Ferozshah itself, with\r\nall the recent traces of battle. When the party of irrigation officers\r\nreached head-quarters, the arrangements for attacking the Sikh army\r\nin its entrenchments at Sobraon were beginning (though suspended till\r\nweeks later for the arrival of the tardy siege guns), and the opposed\r\nforces were lying in sight of each other.”[31]\r\n\r\nYule’s share in this campaign was limited to the sufficiently arduous\r\ntask of bridging the Sutlej for the advance of the British army. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the man that for this reason he always abstained\r\nfrom wearing his medal for the Sutlej campaign.\r\n\r\nHis elder brother, Robert Yule, then in the 16th Lancers, took part in\r\nthat magnificent charge of his regiment at the battle of Aliwal (Jan.\r\n28, 1846) which the Great Duke is said to have pronounced unsurpassed\r\nin history. From particulars gleaned from his brother and others\r\npresent in the action, Henry Yule prepared a spirited sketch of the\r\nepisode, which was afterwards published as a coloured lithograph by\r\nM‘Lean (Haymarket).\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, Yule succeeded his friend Strachey as\r\nExecutive Engineer of the northern division of the Ganges Canal, with\r\nhis head-quarters at Roorkee, “the division which, being nearest the\r\nhills and crossed by intermittent torrents of great breadth and great\r\nvolume when in flood, includes the most important and interesting\r\nengineering works.”[32]\r\n\r\nAt Roorkee were the extensive engineering workshops connected with the\r\ncanal. Yule soon became so accustomed to the din as to be undisturbed\r\nby the noise, but the unpunctuality and carelessness of the native\r\nworkmen sorely tried his patience, of which Nature had endowed him with\r\nbut a small reserve. Vexed with himself for letting temper so often get\r\nthe better of him, Yule’s conscientious mind devised a characteristic\r\nremedy. Each time that he lost his temper, he transferred a fine of\r\ntwo rupees (then about five shillings) from his right to his left\r\npocket. When about to leave Roorkee, he devoted this accumulation of\r\nself-imposed fines to the erection of a sun-dial, to teach the natives\r\nthe value of time. The late Sir James Caird, who told this legend of\r\nRoorkee as he heard it there in 1880, used to add, with a humorous\r\ntwinkle of his kindly eyes, “It was a _very_ handsome dial.”[33]\r\n\r\nFrom September, 1845, to March, 1847, Yule was much occupied\r\nintermittently, in addition to his professional work, by service on a\r\nCommittee appointed by Government “to investigate the causes of the\r\nunhealthiness which has existed at Kurnal, and other portions of the\r\ncountry along the line of the Delhi Canal,” and further, to report\r\n“whether an injurious effect on the health of the people of the Doab\r\nis, or is not, likely to be produced by the contemplated Ganges Canal.”\r\n\r\n“A very elaborate investigation was made by the Committee, directed\r\nprincipally to ascertaining what relation subsisted between certain\r\nphysical conditions of the different districts, and the liability of\r\ntheir inhabitants to miasmatic fevers.” The principal conclusion of the\r\nCommittee was, “that in the extensive epidemic of 1843, when Kurnaul\r\nsuffered so seriously ... the greater part of the evils observed had\r\nnot been the necessary and unavoidable results of canal irrigation,\r\nbut were due to interference with the natural drainage of the country,\r\nto the saturation of stiff and retentive soils, and to natural\r\ndisadvantages of site, enhanced by excess of moisture. As regarded\r\nthe Ganges Canal, they were of opinion that, with due attention to\r\ndrainage, improvement rather than injury to the general health might\r\nbe expected to follow the introduction of canal irrigation.”[34] In an\r\nunpublished note written about 1889, Yule records his ultimate opinion\r\nas follows: “At this day, and after the large experience afforded by\r\nthe Ganges Canal, I feel sure that a verdict so favourable to the\r\nsanitary results of canal irrigation would not be given.” Still the\r\nfact remains that the Ganges Canal has been the source of unspeakable\r\nblessings to an immense population.\r\n\r\nThe Second Sikh War saw Yule again with the army in the field,\r\nand on 13th Jan. 1849, he was present at the dismal ‘Victory’ of\r\nChillianwallah, of which his most vivid recollection seemed to be the\r\nsudden apparition of Henry Lawrence, fresh from London, but still clad\r\nin the legendary Afghan cloak.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the Punjab campaign, Yule, whose health had\r\nsuffered, took furlough and went home to his wife. For the next three\r\nyears they resided chiefly in Scotland, though paying occasional visits\r\nto the Continent, and about 1850 Yule bought a house in Edinburgh.\r\nThere he wrote “The African Squadron vindicated” (a pamphlet which was\r\nafterwards re-published in French), translated Schiller’s _Kampf mit\r\ndem Drachen_ into English verse, delivered Lectures on Fortification at\r\nthe, now long defunct, Scottish Naval and Military Academy, wrote on\r\nTibet for his friend Blackwood’s Magazine, attended the 1850 Edinburgh\r\nMeeting of the British Association, wrote his excellent lines, “On\r\nthe Loss of the _Birkenhead_,” and commenced his first serious study\r\nof Marco Polo (by whose wondrous tale, however, he had already been\r\ncaptivated as a boy in his father’s library—in Marsden’s edition\r\nprobably). But the most noteworthy literary result of these happy\r\nyears was that really fascinating volume, entitled _Fortification for\r\nOfficers of the Army and Students of Military History_, a work that has\r\nremained unique of its kind. This was published by Blackwood in 1851,\r\nand seven years later received the honour of (unauthorised) translation\r\ninto French. Yule also occupied himself a good deal at this time with\r\nthe practice of photography, a pursuit to which he never after reverted.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1852, Yule made an interesting little\r\nsemi-professional tour in company with a brother officer, his\r\naccomplished friend, Major R. B. Smith. Beginning with Kelso, “the\r\nonly one of the Teviotdale Abbeys which I had not as yet seen,” they\r\nmade their way leisurely through the north of England, examining\r\nwith impartial care abbeys and cathedrals, factories, brick-yards,\r\nfoundries, timber-yards, docks, and railway works. On this occasion\r\nYule, contrary to his custom, kept a journal, and a few excerpts may be\r\ngiven here, as affording some notion of his casual talk to those who\r\ndid not know him.\r\n\r\nAt Berwick-on-Tweed he notes the old ramparts of the town: “These,\r\nerected in Elizabeth’s time, are interesting as being, I believe, the\r\nonly existing sample in England of the bastioned system of the 16th\r\ncentury.... The outline of the works seems perfect enough, though both\r\nearth and stone work are in great disrepair. The bastions are large\r\nwith obtuse angles, square orillons, and double flanks originally\r\ncasemated, and most of them crowned with cavaliers.” On the way to\r\nDurham, “much amused by the discussions of two passengers, one a\r\nsmooth-spoken, semi-clerical looking person; the other a brusque\r\nwell-to-do attorney with a Northumbrian burr. Subject, among others,\r\nProtection. The Attorney all for ‘cheap bread’— ‘You wouldn’t rob the\r\npoor man of his loaf,’ and so forth. ‘You must go with the _stgheam_,\r\nsir, you must go with the stgheam.’ ‘I never did, Mr. Thompson, and I\r\nnever will,’ said the other in an oily manner, singularly inconsistent\r\nwith the sentiment.” At Durham they dined with a dignitary of the\r\nChurch, and Yule was roasted by being placed with his back to an\r\nenormous fire. “Coals are cheap at Durham,” he notes feelingly, adding,\r\n“The party we found as heavy as any Edinburgh one. Smith, indeed,\r\nevidently has had little experience of really stupid Edinburgh parties,\r\nfor he had never met with anything approaching to this before.” (Happy\r\nSmith!) But thanks to the kindness and hospitality of the astronomer,\r\nMr. Chevalier, and his gifted daughter, they had a delightful visit\r\nto beautiful Durham, and came away full of admiration for the (then\r\nnewly established) University, and its grand _locale_. They went on\r\nto stay with an uncle by marriage of Yule’s, in Yorkshire. At dinner\r\nhe was asked by his host to explain Foucault’s pendulum experiment.\r\n“I endeavoured to explain it somewhat, I hope, to the satisfaction of\r\nhis doubts, but not at all to that of Mr. G. M., who most resolutely\r\ndeclined to take in _any_ elucidation, coming at last to the conclusion\r\nthat he entirely differed with me as to what North meant, and that\r\nit was useless to argue until we could agree about that!” They\r\nwent next to Leeds, to visit Kirkstall Abbey, “a mediæval fossil,\r\ncuriously embedded among the squalid brickwork and chimney stalks of\r\na manufacturing suburb. Having established ourselves at the hotel, we\r\nwent to deliver a letter to Mr. Hope, the official assignee, a very\r\nhandsome, aristocratic-looking gentleman, who seemed as much out of\r\nplace at Leeds as the Abbey.” At Leeds they visited the flax mills\r\nof Messrs. Marshall, “a firm noted for the conscientious care they\r\ntake of their workpeople.... We mounted on the roof of the building,\r\nwhich is covered with grass, and formerly was actually grazed by a\r\nfew sheep, until the repeated inconvenience of their tumbling through\r\nthe glass domes put a stop to this.” They next visited some tile and\r\nbrickworks on land belonging to a friend. “The owner of the tile works,\r\na well-to-do burgher, and the apparent model of a West Riding Radical,\r\nreceived us in rather a dubious way: ‘There are a many people has\r\ncome and brought introductions, and looked at all my works, and then\r\ngone and set up for themselves close by. Now des you mean to say that\r\nyou be really come all the way from Beng_u_l?’ ‘Yes, indeed we have,\r\nand we are going all the way back again, though we didn’t exactly\r\ncome from there to look at your brickworks.’ ‘Then you’re not in the\r\nbrick-making line, are you?’ ‘Why we’ve had a good deal to do with\r\nmaking bricks, and may have again; but we’ll engage that if we set up\r\nfor ourselves, it shall be ten thousand miles from you.’ This seemed in\r\nsome degree to set his mind at rest....”\r\n\r\n“A dismal day, with occasional showers, prevented our seeing Sheffield\r\nto advantage. On the whole, however, it is more cheerful and has more\r\nof a country-town look than Leeds—a place utterly without beauty of\r\naspect. At Leeds you have vast barrack-like factories, with their usual\r\nsuburbs of squalid rows of brick cottages, and everywhere the tall\r\nspiracles of the steam, which seems the pervading power of the place.\r\nEverything there is machinery—the machine is the intelligent agent, it\r\nwould seem, the man its slave, standing by to tend it and pick up a\r\nbroken thread now and then. At Sheffield ... you might go through most\r\nof the streets without knowing anything of the kind was going on. And\r\nsteam here, instead of being a ruler, is a drudge, turning a grindstone\r\nor rolling out a bar of steel, but all the accuracy and skill of hand\r\nis the Man’s. And consequently there was, we thought, a healthier\r\naspect about the men engaged. None of the Rodgers remain who founded\r\nthe firm in my father’s time. I saw some pairs of his scissors in the\r\nshow-room still kept under the name of _Persian_ scissors.”[35]\r\n\r\nFrom Sheffield Yule and his friend proceeded to Boston, “where there\r\nis the most exquisite church tower I have ever seen,” and thence to\r\nLincoln, Peterborough, and Ely, ending their tour at Cambridge, where\r\nYule spent a few delightful days.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn the great Duke of Wellington died, and Yule witnessed the\r\nhistoric pageant of his funeral. His furlough was now nearly expired,\r\nand early in December he again embarked for India, leaving his wife\r\nand only child, of a few weeks old, behind him. Some verses dated\r\n“Christmas Day near the Equator,” show how much he felt the separation.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to Bengal, Yule received orders to proceed\r\nto Aracan, and to examine and report upon the passes between Aracan\r\nand Burma, as also to improve communications and select suitable\r\nsites for fortified posts to hold the same. These orders came to Yule\r\nquite unexpectedly late one Saturday evening, but he completed all\r\npreparations and started at daybreak on the following Monday, 24th Jan.\r\n1853.\r\n\r\nFrom Calcutta to Khyook Phyoo, Yule proceeded by steamer, and thence\r\nup the river in the _Tickler_ gunboat to Krenggyuen. “Our course lay\r\nthrough a wilderness of wooded islands (50 to 200 feet high) and bays,\r\nsailing when we could, anchoring when neither wind nor tide served\r\n... slow progress up the river. More and more like the creeks and\r\nlagoons of the Niger or a Guiana river rather than anything I looked\r\nfor in India. The densest tree jungle covers the shore down into the\r\nwater. For miles no sign of human habitation, but now and then at\r\nrare intervals one sees a patch of hillside rudely cleared, with the\r\nbare stems of the burnt trees still standing.... Sometimes, too, a\r\ndark tunnel-like creek runs back beneath the thick vault of jungle,\r\nand from it silently steals out a slim canoe, manned by two or three\r\nwild-looking Mugs or Kyens (people of the Hills), driving it rapidly\r\nalong with their short paddles held vertically, exactly like those of\r\nthe Red men on the American rivers.”\r\n\r\nAt the military post of Bokhyong, near Krenggyuen, he notes (5th Feb.)\r\nthat “Captain Munro, the adjutant, can scarcely believe that I was\r\npresent at the Duke of Wellington’s funeral, of which he read but a\r\nfew days ago in the newspapers, and here am I, one of the spectators,\r\na guest in this wild spot among the mountains—2½ months since I left\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nYule’s journal of his arduous wanderings in these border wilds is\r\nfull of interest, but want of space forbids further quotation. From\r\na note on the fly-leaf it appears that from the time of quitting the\r\ngun-boat at Krenggyuen to his arrival at Toungoop he covered about 240\r\nmiles on foot, and that under immense difficulties, even as to food.\r\nHe commemorated his tribulations in some cheery humorous verse, but\r\nultimately fell seriously ill of the local fever, aided doubtless by\r\nprevious exposure and privation. His servants successively fell ill,\r\nsome died and others had to be sent back, food supplies failed, and\r\nthe route through those dense forests was uncertain; yet under all\r\ndifficulties he seems never to have grumbled or lost heart. And when\r\nthings were nearly at the worst, Yule restored the spirits of his\r\nlocal escort by improvising a wappenshaw, with a Sheffield gardener’s\r\nknife, which he happened to have with him, for prize! When at last Yule\r\nemerged from the wilds and on 25th March marched into Prome, he was\r\ntaken for his own ghost! “Found Fraser (of the Engineers) in a rambling\r\nphoongyee house, just under the great gilt pagoda. I went up to him\r\nannouncing myself, and his astonishment was so great that he would\r\nscarcely shake hands!” It was on this occasion at Prome that Yule first\r\nmet his future chief Captain Phayre—“a very young-looking man—very\r\ncordial,” a description no less applicable to General Sir Arthur Phayre\r\nat the age of seventy!\r\n\r\nAfter some further wanderings, Yule embarked at Sandong, and returned\r\nby water, touching at Kyook Phyoo and Akyab, to Calcutta, which he\r\nreached on 1st May—his birthday.\r\n\r\nThe next four months were spent in hard work at Calcutta. In August,\r\nYule received orders to proceed to Singapore, and embarked on the 29th.\r\nHis duty was to report on the defences of the Straits Settlements, with\r\na view to their improvement. Yule’s recommendations were sanctioned by\r\nGovernment, but his journal bears witness to the prevalence then, as\r\nsince, of the penny-wise-pound-foolish system in our administration. On\r\nall sides he was met by difficulties in obtaining sites for batteries,\r\netc., for which heavy compensation was demanded, when by the exercise\r\nof reasonable foresight, the same might have been secured earlier at a\r\nnominal price.\r\n\r\nYule’s journal contains a very bright and pleasing picture of\r\nSingapore, where he found that the majority of the European population\r\n“were evidently, from their tongues, from benorth the Tweed, a\r\ncircumstance which seems to be true of four-fifths of the Singaporeans.\r\nIndeed, if I taught geography, I should be inclined to class Edinburgh,\r\nGlasgow, Dundee, and Singapore together as the four chief towns of\r\nScotland.”\r\n\r\nWork on the defences kept Yule in Singapore and its neighbourhood until\r\nthe end of November, when he embarked for Bengal. On his return to\r\nCalcutta, Yule was appointed Deputy Consulting Engineer for Railways\r\nat Head-quarters. In this post he had for chief his old friend Baker,\r\nwho had in 1851 been appointed by the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie,\r\nConsulting Engineer for Railways to Government. The office owed its\r\nexistence to the recently initiated great experiment of railway\r\nconstruction under Government guarantee.\r\n\r\nThe subject was new to Yule, “and therefore called for hard and anxious\r\nlabour. He, however, turned his strong sense and unbiased view to the\r\ngeneral question of railway communication in India, with the result\r\nthat he became a vigorous supporter of the idea of narrow gauge and\r\ncheap lines in the parts of that country outside of the main trunk\r\nlines of traffic.”[36]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Yule, and that of his intimate friends and ultimate\r\nsuccessors in office, Colonels R. Strachey and Dickens, led to the\r\nadoption of the narrow (metre) gauge over a great part of India. Of\r\nthis matter more will be said further on; it is sufficient at this\r\nstage to note that it was occupying Yule’s thoughts, and that he had\r\nalready taken up the position in this question that he thereafter\r\nmaintained through life. The office of Consulting Engineer to\r\nGovernment for Railways ultimately developed into the great Department\r\nof Public Works.\r\n\r\nAs related by Yule, whilst Baker “held this appointment, Lord Dalhousie\r\nwas in the habit of making use of his advice in a great variety of\r\nmatters connected with Public Works projects and questions, but which\r\nhad nothing to do with guaranteed railways, there being at that time no\r\nofficer attached to the Government of India, whose proper duty it was\r\nto deal with such questions. In August, 1854, the Government of India\r\nsent home to the Court of Directors a despatch and a series of minutes\r\nby the Governor-General and his Council, in which the constitution of\r\nthe Public Works Department as a separate branch of administration,\r\nboth in the local governments and the government of India itself, was\r\nurged on a detailed plan.”\r\n\r\nIn this communication Lord Dalhousie stated his desire to appoint Major\r\nBaker to the projected office of Secretary for the Department of Public\r\nWorks. In the spring of 1855 these recommendations were carried out by\r\nthe creation of the Department, with Baker as Secretary and Yule as\r\nUnder Secretary for Public Works.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Yule’s services were called to a very different field, but\r\nwithout his vacating his new appointment, which he was allowed to\r\nretain. Not long after the conclusion of the second Burmese War, the\r\nKing of Burma sent a friendly mission to the Governor-General, and\r\nin 1855 a return Embassy was despatched to the Court of Ava, under\r\nColonel Arthur Phayre, with Henry Yule as Secretary, an appointment\r\nthe latter owed as much to Lord Dalhousie’s personal wish as to\r\nPhayre’s good-will. The result of this employment was Yule’s first\r\ngeographical book, a large volume entitled _Mission to the Court of Ava\r\nin 1855_, originally printed in India, but subsequently re-issued in\r\nan embellished form at home (see over leaf). To the end of his life,\r\nYule looked back to this “social progress up the Irawady, with its many\r\nquaint and pleasant memories, as to a bright and joyous holiday.”[37]\r\nIt was a delight to him to work under Phayre, whose noble and lovable\r\ncharacter he had already learned to appreciate two years before in\r\nPegu. Then, too, Yule has spoken of the intense relief it was to escape\r\nfrom the monotonous scenery and depressing conditions of official\r\nlife in Bengal (Resort to Simla was the exception, not the rule, in\r\nthese days!) to the cheerfulness and unconstraint of Burma, with its\r\nfine landscapes and merry-hearted population. “It was such a relief\r\nto find natives who would laugh at a joke,” he once remarked in the\r\nwriter’s presence to the lamented E. C. Baber, who replied that he had\r\nexperienced exactly the same sense of relief in passing from India to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nYule’s work on Burma was largely illustrated by his own sketches. One\r\nof these represents the King’s reception of the Embassy, and another,\r\nthe King on his throne. The originals were executed by Yule’s ready\r\npencil, surreptitiously within his cocked hat, during the audience.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter sketch Yule had a small oil-painting executed under his\r\ndirection by a German artist, then resident in Calcutta, which he gave\r\nto Lord Dalhousie.[38]\r\n\r\nThe Government of India marked their approval of the Embassy by an\r\nunusual concession. Each of the members of the mission received a\r\nsouvenir of the expedition. To Yule was given a very beautiful and\r\nelaborately chased small bowl, of nearly pure gold, bearing the signs\r\nof the Zodiac in relief.[39]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Calcutta, Yule threw himself heart and soul into the\r\nwork of his new appointment in the Public Works Department. The nature\r\nof his work, the novelty and variety of the projects and problems\r\nwith which this new branch of the service had to deal, brought Yule\r\ninto constant, and eventually very intimate association with Lord\r\nDalhousie, whom he accompanied on some of his tours of inspection.\r\nThe two men thoroughly appreciated each other, and, from first to\r\nlast, Yule experienced the greatest kindness from Lord Dalhousie. In\r\nthis intimacy, no doubt the fact of being what French soldiers call\r\n_pays_ added something to the warmth of their mutual regard: their\r\nforefathers came from the same _airt_, and neither was unmindful of the\r\ncircumstance. It is much to be regretted that Yule preserved no sketch\r\nof Lord Dalhousie, nor written record of his intercourse with him, but\r\nthe following lines show some part of what he thought:\r\n\r\n“At this time [1849] there appears upon the scene that vigorous and\r\nmasterful spirit, whose arrival to take up the government of India had\r\nbeen greeted by events so inauspicious. No doubt from the beginning the\r\nGovernor-General was desirous to let it be understood that although new\r\nto India he was, and meant to be, master; ... Lord Dalhousie was by no\r\nmeans averse to frank dissent, provided _in the manner_ it was never\r\nforgotten that he was Governor-General. Like his great predecessor Lord\r\nWellesley, he was jealous of all familiarity and resented it.... The\r\ngeneral sentiment of those who worked under that ἄναξ ανδρῶν was one of\r\nstrong and admiring affection ... and we doubt if a Governor-General\r\never embarked on the Hoogly amid deeper feeling than attended him who,\r\nshattered by sorrow and physical suffering, but erect and undaunted,\r\nquitted Calcutta on the 6th March 1856.”[40]\r\n\r\nHis successor was Lord Canning, whose confidence in Yule and personal\r\nregard for him became as marked as his predecessor’s.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1856, Yule took leave and came home. Much of his\r\ntime while in England was occupied with making arrangements for the\r\nproduction of an improved edition of his book on Burma, which so\r\nfar had been a mere government report. These were completed to his\r\nsatisfaction, and on the eve of returning to India, he wrote to his\r\npublishers[41] that the correction of the proof sheets and general\r\nsupervision of the publication had been undertaken by his friend the\r\nRev. W. D. Maclagan, formerly an officer of the Madras army (and now\r\nArchbishop of York).\r\n\r\nWhilst in England, Yule had renewed his intimacy with his old friend\r\nColonel Robert Napier, then also on furlough, a visitor whose kindly\r\nsympathetic presence always brought special pleasure also to Yule’s\r\nwife and child. One result of this intercourse was that the friends\r\ndecided to return together to India. Accordingly they sailed from\r\nMarseilles towards the end of April, and at Aden were met by the\r\nastounding news of the outbreak of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Calcutta Yule, who retained his appointment of Under\r\nSecretary to Government, found his work indefinitely increased. Every\r\navailable officer was called into the field, and Yule’s principal\r\ncentre of activity was shifted to the great fortress of Allahabad,\r\nforming the principal base of operations against the rebels. Not only\r\nhad he to strengthen or create defences at Allahabad and elsewhere,\r\nbut on Yule devolved the principal burden of improvising accommodation\r\nfor the European troops then pouring into India, which ultimately\r\nmeant providing for an army of 100,000 men. His task was made the\r\nmore difficult by the long-standing chronic friction, then and long\r\nafter, existing between the officers of the Queen’s and the Company’s\r\nservices. But in a far more important matter he was always fortunate.\r\nAs he subsequently recorded in a Note for Government: “Through all\r\nconsciousness of mistakes and shortcomings, I have felt that I had the\r\nconfidence of those whom I served, a feeling which has lightened many a\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\nIt was at Allahabad that Yule, in the intervals of more serious work,\r\nput the last touches to his Burma book. The preface of the English\r\nedition is dated, “Fortress of Allahabad, Oct. 3, 1857,” and contains\r\na passage instinct with the emotions of the time. After recalling\r\nthe “joyous holiday” on the Irawady, he goes on: “But for ourselves,\r\nstanding here on the margin of these rivers, which a few weeks ago were\r\nred with the blood of our murdered brothers and sisters, and straining\r\nthe ear to catch the echo of our avenging artillery, it is difficult to\r\nturn the mind to what seem dreams of past days of peace and security;\r\nand memory itself grows dim in the attempt to repass the gulf which\r\nthe last few months has interposed between the present and the time to\r\nwhich this narrative refers.”[42]\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote these lines, the first relief had just taken place, and\r\nthe second defence of Lucknow was beginning. The end of the month saw\r\nSir Colin Campbell’s advance to the second—the real—relief of Lucknow.\r\nOf Sir Colin, Yule wrote and spoke with warm regard: “Sir Colin was\r\ndelightful, and when in a good humour and at his best, always reminded\r\nme very much, both in manner and talk, of the General (_i.e._ General\r\nWhite, his wife’s father). The voice was just the same and the quiet\r\ngentle manner, with its underlying keen dry humour. But then if you did\r\nhappen to offend Sir Colin, it was like treading on crackers, which was\r\nnot our General’s way.”\r\n\r\nWhen Lucknow had been relieved, besieged, reduced, and finally\r\nremodelled by the grand Roads and Demolitions Scheme of his friend\r\nNapier, the latter came down to Allahabad, and he and Yule sought\r\ndiversion in playing quoits and skittles, the only occasion on which\r\neither of them is known to have evinced any liking for games.\r\n\r\nBefore this time Yule had succeeded his friend Baker as _de facto_\r\nSecretary to Government for Public Works, and on Baker’s retirement\r\nin 1858, Yule was formally appointed his successor.[43] Baker and\r\nYule had, throughout their association, worked in perfect unison,\r\nand the very differences in their characters enhanced the value of\r\ntheir co-operation; the special qualities of each friend mutually\r\nstrengthened and completed each other. Yule’s was by far the more\r\noriginal and creative mind, Baker’s the more precise and, at least in\r\na professional sense, the more highly-trained organ. In chivalrous\r\nsense of honour, devotion to duty, and natural generosity, the men\r\nstood equal; but while Yule was by nature impatient and irritable, and\r\nliable, until long past middle age, to occasional sudden bursts of\r\nuncontrollable anger, generally followed by periods of black depression\r\nand almost absolute silence,[44] Baker was the very reverse. Partly by\r\nnatural temperament, but also certainly by severe self-discipline, his\r\nmanner was invincibly placid and his temper imperturbable.[45] Yet none\r\nwas more tenacious in maintaining whatever he judged right.\r\n\r\nBaker, whilst large-minded in great matters, was extremely conventional\r\nin small ones, and Yule must sometimes have tried his feelings\r\nin this respect. The particulars of one such tragic occurrence\r\nhave survived. Yule, who was colour-blind,[46] and in early life\r\nwhimsically obstinate in maintaining his own view of colours, had\r\nselected some cloth for trousers undeterred by his tailor’s timid\r\nremonstrance of “Not _quite_ your usual taste, sir.” The result was\r\nthat the Under-Secretary to Government startled official Calcutta by\r\nappearing in brilliant claret-coloured raiment. Baker remonstrated:\r\n“Claret-colour! Nonsense, my trousers are silver grey,” said Yule, and\r\nentirely declined to be convinced. “I think I _did_ convince him at\r\nlast,” said Baker with some pride, when long after telling the story to\r\nthe present writer. “And _then_ he gave them up?” “Oh, no,” said Sir\r\nWilliam ruefully, “he wore those claret-coloured trousers to the very\r\nend.” That episode probably belonged to the Dalhousie period.\r\n\r\nWhen Yule resumed work in the Secretariat at Calcutta at the close of\r\nthe Mutiny, the inevitable arrears of work were enormous. This may be\r\nthe proper place to notice more fully his action with respect to the\r\nchoice of gauge for Indian railways already adverted to in brief. As\r\nwe have seen, his own convictions led to the adoption of the metre\r\ngauge over a great part of India. This policy had great disadvantages\r\nnot at first foreseen, and has since been greatly modified. In\r\njustice to Yule, however, it should be remembered that the conditions\r\nand requirements of India have largely altered, alike through the\r\nextraordinary growth of the Indian export, especially the grain, trade,\r\nand the development of new necessities for Imperial defence. These new\r\nfeatures, however, did but accentuate defects inherent in the system,\r\nbut which only prolonged practical experience made fully apparent.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the supporters of the narrow gauge seemed to have the\r\nstronger position, as they were able to show that the cost was much\r\nless, the rails employed being only about ⅔rds the weight of those\r\nrequired by the broad gauge, and many other subsidiary expenses also\r\nproportionally less. On the other hand, as time passed and practical\r\nexperience was gained, its opponents were able to make an even stronger\r\ncase against the narrow gauge. The initial expenses were undoubtedly\r\nless, but the durability was also less. Thus much of the original\r\nsaving was lost in the greater cost of maintenance, whilst the small\r\ncarrying capacity of the rolling stock and loss of time and labour in\r\nshifting goods at every break of gauge, were further serious causes of\r\nwaste, which the internal commercial development of India daily made\r\nmore apparent. Strategic needs also were clamant against the dangers\r\nof the narrow gauge in any general scheme of Indian defence. Yule’s\r\nconnection with the Public Works Department had long ceased ere the\r\nquestion of the gauges reached its most acute stage, but his interest\r\nand indirect participation in the conflict survived. In this matter\r\na certain parental tenderness for a scheme which he had helped to\r\noriginate, combined with his warm friendship for some of the principal\r\nsupporters of the narrow gauge, seem to have influenced his views\r\nmore than he himself was aware. Certainly his judgment in this matter\r\nwas not impartial, although, as always in his case, it was absolutely\r\nsincere and not consciously biased.\r\n\r\nIn reference to Yule’s services in the period following the Mutiny,\r\nLord Canning’s subsequent Minute of 1862 may here be fitly quoted. In\r\nthis the Governor-General writes: “I have long ago recorded my opinion\r\nof the value of his services in 1858 and 1859, when with a crippled\r\nand overtaxed staff of Engineer officers, many of them young and\r\ninexperienced, the G.-G. had to provide rapidly for the accommodation\r\nof a vast English army, often in districts hitherto little known, and\r\nin which the authority of the Government was barely established, and\r\nalways under circumstances of difficulty and urgency. I desire to\r\nrepeat that the Queen’s army in India was then greatly indebted to\r\nLieut.-Colonel Yule’s judgment, earnestness, and ability; and this to\r\nan extent very imperfectly understood by many of the officers who held\r\ncommands in that army.\r\n\r\n“Of the manner in which the more usual duties of his office have\r\nbeen discharged it is unnecessary for me to speak. It is, I believe,\r\nknown and appreciated as well by the Home Government as by the\r\nGovernor-General in Council.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1859 Yule felt the urgent need of a rest, and took\r\nthe, at that time, most unusual step of coming home on three months’\r\nleave, which as the voyage then occupied a month each way, left him\r\nonly one month at home. He was accompanied by his elder brother George,\r\nwho had not been out of India for thirty years. The visit home of the\r\ntwo brothers was as bright and pleasant as it was brief, but does not\r\ncall for further notice.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Yule’s health having again suffered, he took short leave to\r\nJava. His journal of this tour is very interesting, but space does\r\nnot admit of quotation here. He embodied some of the results of his\r\nobservations in a lecture he delivered on his return to Calcutta.\r\n\r\nDuring these latter years of his service in India, Yule owed much\r\nhappiness to the appreciative friendship of Lord Canning and the ready\r\nsympathy of Lady Canning. If he shared their tours in an official\r\ncapacity, the intercourse was much more than official. The noble\r\ncharacter of Lady Canning won from Yule such wholehearted chivalrous\r\ndevotion as, probably, he felt for no other friend save, perhaps in\r\nafter days, Sir Bartle Frere. And when her health failed, it was to\r\nYule’s special care that Lord Canning entrusted his wife during a tour\r\nin the Hills. Lady Canning was known to be very homesick, and one day\r\nas the party came in sight of some ilexes (the evergreen oak), Yule\r\nsought to cheer her by calling out pleasantly: “Look, Lady Canning!\r\nThere are _oaks_!” “No, no, Yule, _not_ oaks,” cried Sir C. B. “They\r\nare (solemnly) IBEXES.” “No, _not_ Ibexes, Sir C., you mean SILEXES,”\r\ncried Capt. ——, the A.D.C.; Lady Canning and Yule the while almost\r\nchoking with laughter.\r\n\r\nOn another and later occasion, when the Governor-General’s camp was\r\npeculiarly dull and stagnant, every one yawning and grumbling, Yule\r\neffected a temporary diversion by pretending to tap the telegraph\r\nwires, and circulating through camp, what purported to be, the usual\r\ntelegraphic abstract of news brought to Bombay by the latest English\r\nmail. The news was of the most astounding character, with just enough\r\nair of probability, in minor details, to pass muster with a dull\r\nreader. The effect was all he could wish—or rather more—and there was\r\na general flutter in the camp. Of course the Governor-General and one\r\nor two others were in the secret, and mightily relished the diversion.\r\nBut this pleasant and cheering intercourse was drawing to its mournful\r\nclose. On her way back from Darjeeling, in November, 1861, Lady Canning\r\n(not then in Yule’s care) was unavoidably exposed to the malaria of a\r\nspecially unhealthy season. A few days’ illness followed, and on 18th\r\nNovember, 1861, she passed calmly to\r\n\r\n    “That remaining rest where night and tears are o’er.”[47]\r\n\r\nIt was to Yule that Lord Canning turned in the first anguish of his\r\nloss, and on this faithful friend devolved the sad privilege of\r\npreparing her last resting-place. This may be told in the touching\r\nwords of Lord Canning’s letter to his only sister, written on the day\r\nof Lady Canning’s burial, in the private garden at Barrackpoor[48]:—\r\n\r\n“The funeral is over, and my own darling lies buried in a spot which\r\nI am sure she would have chosen of all others.... From the grave can\r\nbe seen the embanked walk leading from the house to the river’s edge,\r\nwhich she made as a landing-place three years ago, and from within 3\r\nor 4 paces of the grave there is a glimpse of the terrace-garden and\r\nits balustrades, which she made near the house, and of the part of\r\nthe grounds with which she most occupied herself.... I left Calcutta\r\nyesterday ... and on arriving here, went to look at the precise spot\r\nchosen for the grave. I could see by the clear full moon ... that it\r\nwas exactly right. Yule was there superintending the workmen, and\r\nbefore daylight this morning a solid masonry vault had been completely\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n“Bowie [Military Secretary] and Yule have done all this for me. It\r\nhas all been settled since my poor darling died. She liked Yule.\r\nThey used to discuss together her projects of improvement for this\r\nplace, architecture, gardening, the Cawnpore monument, etc., and they\r\ngenerally agreed. He knew her tastes well....”\r\n\r\nThe coffin, brought on a gun-carriage from Calcutta, “was carried by\r\ntwelve soldiers of the 6th Regiment (Queen’s), the A.D.C.’s bearing\r\nthe pall. There were no hired men or ordinary funeral attendants of\r\nany kind at any part of the ceremony, and no lookers-on.... Yule was\r\nthe only person not of the household staff. Had others who had asked”\r\nto attend “been allowed to do so, the numbers would have been far too\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n“On coming near the end of the terrace walk I saw that the turf\r\nbetween the walk and the grave, and for several yards all round the\r\ngrave, was strewed thick with palm branches and bright fresh-gathered\r\nflowers—quite a thick carpet. It was a little matter, but so exactly\r\nwhat she would have thought of.”[49]\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, Yule thought of this for her! He also recorded the\r\nscene two days later in some graceful and touching lines, privately\r\nprinted, from which the following may be quoted:\r\n\r\n    “When night lowered black, and the circling shroud\r\n     Of storm rolled near, and stout hearts learned dismay;\r\n     Not Hers! To her tried Lord a Light and Stay\r\n     Even in the Earthquake and the palpable cloud\r\n     Of those dark months; and when a fickle crowd\r\n     Panted for blood and pelted wrath and scorn\r\n     On him she loved, her courage never stooped:\r\n     But when the clouds were driven, and the day\r\n     Poured Hope and glorious Sunshine, she who had borne,\r\n     The night with such strong Heart, withered and drooped,\r\n     Our queenly lily, and smiling passed away.\r\n     Now! let no fouling touch profane her clay,\r\n     Nor odious pomps and funeral tinsels mar\r\n     Our grief. But from our England’s cannon car\r\n     Let England’s soldiers bear her to the tomb\r\n     Prepared by loving hands. Before her bier\r\n     Scatter victorious palms; let Rose’s bloom\r\n     Carpet its passage....”\r\n\r\nYule’s deep sympathy in this time of sorrow strengthened the friendship\r\nLord Canning had long felt for him, and when the time approached for\r\nthe Governor-General to vacate his high office, he invited Yule, who\r\nwas very weary of India, to accompany him home, where his influence\r\nwould secure Yule congenial employment. Yule’s weariness of India at\r\nthis time was extreme. Moreover, after serving under such leaders as\r\nLord Dalhousie and Lord Canning, and winning their full confidence and\r\nfriendship, it was almost repugnant to him to begin afresh with new\r\nmen and probably new measures, with which he might not be in accord.\r\nIndeed, some little clouds were already visible on the horizon. In\r\nthese circumstances, it is not surprising that Yule, under an impulse\r\nof lassitude and impatience, when accepting Lord Canning’s offer,\r\nalso ‘burnt his boats’ by sending in his resignation of the service.\r\nThis decision Yule took against the earnest advice of his anxious and\r\ndevoted wife, and for a time the results justified all her misgivings.\r\nShe knew well, from past experience, how soon Yule wearied in the\r\nabsence of compulsory employment. And in the event of the life in\r\nEngland not suiting him, for even Lord Canning’s good-will might\r\nnot secure perfectly congenial employment for his talents, she knew\r\nwell that his health and spirits would be seriously affected. She,\r\ntherefore, with affectionate solicitude, urged that he should adopt the\r\ncourse previously followed by his friend Baker, that is, come home on\r\nfurlough, and only send in his resignation after he saw clearly what\r\nhis prospects of home employment were, and what he himself wished in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nLord Canning and Yule left Calcutta late in March, 1862; at Malta\r\nthey parted never to meet again in this world. Lord Canning proceeded\r\nto England, and Yule joined his wife and child in Rome. Only a few\r\nweeks later, at Florence, came as a thunderclap the announcement of\r\nLord Canning’s unexpected death in London, on 17th June. Well does\r\nthe present writer remember the day that fatal news came, and Yule’s\r\ndeep anguish, not assuredly for the loss of his prospects, but for\r\nthe loss of a most noble and magnanimous friend, a statesman whose\r\ntrue greatness was, both then and since, most imperfectly realised by\r\nthe country for which he had worn himself out.[50] Shortly after Yule\r\nwent to England,[51] where he was cordially received by Lord Canning’s\r\nrepresentatives, who gave him a touching remembrance of his lost\r\nfriend, in the shape of the silver travelling candlesticks, which had\r\nhabitually stood on Lord Canning’s writing-table.[52] But his offer to\r\nwrite Lord Canning’s _Life_ had no result, as the relatives, following\r\nthe then recent example of the Hastings family, in the case of another\r\ngreat Governor-General, refused to revive discussion by the publication\r\nof any Memoir.\r\n\r\nNor did Yule find any suitable opening for employment in England, so\r\nafter two or three months spent in visiting old friends, he rejoined\r\nhis family in the Black Forest, where he sought occupation in renewing\r\nhis knowledge of German. But it must be confessed that his mood both\r\nthen and for long after was neither happy nor wholesome. The winter\r\nof 1862 was spent somewhat listlessly, partly in Germany and partly\r\nat the Hôtel des Bergues, Geneva, where his old acquaintance Colonel\r\nTronchin was hospitably ready to open all doors. The picturesque figure\r\nof John Ruskin also flits across the scene at this time. But Yule was\r\nunoccupied and restless, and could neither enjoy Mr. Ruskin’s criticism\r\nof his sketches nor the kindly hospitality of his Genevan hosts. Early\r\nin 1863 he made another fruitless visit to London, where he remained\r\nfour or five months, but found no opening. Though unproductive of work,\r\nthis year brought Yule official recognition of his services in the\r\nshape of the C.B., for which Lord Canning had long before recommended\r\nhim.[53]\r\n\r\nOn rejoining his wife and child at Mornex in Savoy, Yule found the\r\nhealth of the former seriously impaired. During his absence, the kind\r\nand able English Doctor at Geneva had felt obliged to inform Mrs. Yule\r\nthat she was suffering from disease of the heart, and that her life\r\nmight end suddenly at any moment. Unwilling to add to Yule’s anxieties,\r\nshe made all necessary arrangements, but did not communicate this\r\nintelligence until he had done all he wished and returned, when she\r\nbroke it to him very gently. Up to this year Mrs. Yule, though not\r\nstrong and often ailing, had not allowed herself to be considered an\r\ninvalid, but from this date doctor’s orders left her no choice in the\r\nmatter.[54]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Yule took in hand the first of his studies of mediæval\r\ntravellers. His translation of the _Travels of Friar Jordanus_ was\r\nprobably commenced earlier; it was completed during the leisurely\r\njourney by carriage between Chambéry and Turin, and the Dedication\r\nto Sir Bartle Frere written during a brief halt at Genoa, from which\r\nplace it is dated. Travelling slowly and pleasantly by _vetturino_\r\nalong the Riviera di Levante, the family came to Spezzia, then little\r\nmore than a quiet village. A chance encounter with agreeable residents\r\ndisposed Yule favourably towards the place, and a few days later he\r\nopened negotiations for land to build a house! Most fortunately for\r\nhimself and all concerned these fell through, and the family continued\r\ntheir journey to Tuscany, and settled for the winter in a long rambling\r\nhouse, with pleasant garden, at Pisa, where Yule was able to continue\r\nwith advantage his researches into mediæval travel in the East. He paid\r\nfrequent visits to Florence, where he had many pleasant acquaintances,\r\nnot least among them Charles Lever (“Harry Lorrequer”), with whom\r\nacquaintance ripened into warm and enduring friendship. At Florence he\r\nalso made the acquaintance of the celebrated Marchese Gino Capponi, and\r\nof many other Italian men of letters. To this winter of 1863–64 belongs\r\nalso the commencement of a lasting friendship with the illustrious\r\nItalian historian, Villari, at that time holding an appointment at\r\nPisa. Another agreeable acquaintance, though less intimate, was formed\r\nwith John Ball, the well-known President of the Alpine Club, then\r\nresident at Pisa, and with many others, among whom the name of a very\r\ncultivated German scholar, H. Meyer, specially recurs to memory.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1864, Yule took a spacious and delightful old villa,\r\nsituated in the highest part of the Bagni di Lucca,[55] and commanding\r\nlovely views over the surrounding chestnut-clad hills and winding river.\r\n\r\nHere he wrote much of what ultimately took form in _Cathay and\r\nthe Way Thither_. It was this summer, too, that Yule commenced his\r\ninvestigations among the Venetian archives, and also visited the\r\nprovince of Friuli in pursuit of materials for the history of one\r\nof his old travellers, the _Beato Odorico_. At Verona—then still\r\nAustrian—he had the amusing experience of being arrested for sketching\r\ntoo near the fortifications. However, his captors had all the usual\r\nAustrian _bonhomie_ and courtesy, and Yule experienced no real\r\ninconvenience. He was much more disturbed when, a day or two later, the\r\nold mother of one of his Venetian acquaintances insisted on embracing\r\nhim on account of his supposed likeness to Garibaldi!\r\n\r\nAs winter approached, a warmer climate became necessary for Mrs. Yule,\r\nand the family proceeded to Sicily, landing at Messina in October,\r\n1864. From this point, Yule made a very interesting excursion to the\r\nthen little known group of the Lipari Islands, in the company of that\r\neminent geologist, the late Robert Mallet, F.R.S., a most agreeable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nOn Martinmas Day, the Yules reached the beautiful capital of Sicily,\r\nPalermo, which, though they knew it not, was to be their home—a very\r\nhappy one—for nearly eleven years.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing winter and spring, Yule continued the preparation\r\nof _Cathay_, but his appetite for work not being satisfied by this,\r\nhe, when in London in 1865, volunteered to make an Index to the third\r\ndecade of the _Journal of the Royal Geographical Society_, in exchange\r\nfor a set of such volumes as he did not possess. That was long before\r\nany Index Society existed; but Yule had special and very strong views\r\nof his own as to what an Index should be, and he spared no labour\r\nto realise his ideal.[56] This proved a heavier task than he had\r\nanticipated, and he got very weary before the Index was completed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1866, _Cathay and the Way Thither_ appeared, and\r\nat once took the high place which it has ever since retained. In the\r\nautumn of the same year Yule’s attention was momentarily turned in a\r\nvery different direction by a local insurrection, followed by severe\r\nreprisals, and the bombardment of Palermo by the Italian Fleet. His\r\nsick wife was for some time under rifle as well as shell fire; but\r\ncheerfully remarking that “every bullet has its billet,” she remained\r\nperfectly serene and undisturbed. It was the year of the last war with\r\nAustria, and also of the suppression of the Monastic Orders in Sicily;\r\ntwo events which probably helped to produce the outbreak, of which Yule\r\ncontributed an account to _The Times_, and subsequently a more detailed\r\none to the _Quarterly Review_.[57]\r\n\r\nYule had no more predilection for the Monastic Orders than most of\r\nhis countrymen, but his sense of justice was shocked by the cruel\r\nincidence of the measure in many cases, and also by the harshness with\r\nwhich both it and the punishment of suspected insurgents was carried\r\nout. Cholera was prevalent in Italy that year, but Sicily, which had\r\nmaintained stringent quarantine, entirely escaped until large bodies\r\nof troops were landed to quell the insurrection, when a devastating\r\nepidemic immediately ensued, and re-appeared in 1867. In after years,\r\nwhen serving on the Army Sanitary Committee at the India Office, Yule\r\nmore than once quoted this experience as indicating that quarantine\r\nrestrictions may, in some cases, have more value than British medical\r\nauthority is usually willing to admit.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, on his return from London, Yule commenced systematic work on\r\nhis long projected new edition of the _Travels of Marco Polo_. It was\r\napparently in this year that the scheme first took definite form, but\r\nit had long been latent in his mind. The Public Libraries of Palermo\r\nafforded him much good material, whilst occasional visits to the\r\nLibraries of Venice, Florence, Paris, and London, opened other sources.\r\nBut his most important channel of supply came from his very extensive\r\nprivate correspondence, extending to nearly all parts of Europe\r\nand many centres in Asia. His work brought him many new and valued\r\nfriends, indeed too many to mention, but amongst whom, as belonging\r\nspecially to this period, three honoured names must be recalled here:\r\nCommendatore (afterwards Baron) CRISTOFORO NEGRI, the large-hearted\r\nFounder and First President of the Geographical Society of Italy,\r\nfrom whom Yule received his first public recognition as a geographer,\r\nCommendatore GUGLIELMO BERCHET (affectionately nicknamed _il Bello e\r\nBuono_), ever generous in learned help, who became a most dear and\r\nhonoured friend, and the Hon. GEORGE P. MARSH, U.S. Envoy to the Court\r\nof Italy, a man, both as scholar and friend, unequalled in his nation,\r\nperhaps almost unique anywhere.\r\n\r\nThose who only knew Yule in later years, may like some account of\r\nhis daily life at this time. It was his custom to rise fairly early;\r\nin summer he sometimes went to bathe in the sea,[58] or for a walk\r\nbefore breakfast; more usually he would write until breakfast, which\r\nhe preferred to have alone. After breakfast he looked through his\r\nnotebooks, and before ten o’clock was usually walking rapidly to the\r\nlibrary where his work lay. He would work there until two or three\r\no’clock, when he returned home, read the _Times_, answered letters,\r\nreceived or paid visits, and then resumed work on his book, which he\r\noften continued long after the rest of the household were sleeping. Of\r\ncourse his family saw but little of him under these circumstances, but\r\nwhen he had got a chapter of _Marco_ into shape, or struck out some\r\nnew discovery of interest, he would carry it to his wife to read. She\r\nalways took great interest in his work, and he had great faith in her\r\nliterary instinct as a sound as well as sympathetic critic.\r\n\r\nThe first fruits of Yule’s Polo studies took the form of a review of\r\nPauthier’s edition of _Marco Polo_, contributed to the _Quarterly\r\nReview_ in 1868.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the great work itself appeared, and received prompt generous\r\nrecognition by the grant of the very beautiful gold medal of the\r\nGeographical Society of Italy,[59] followed in 1872 by the award of\r\nthe Founder’s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, while the\r\nGeographical and Asiatic Societies of Paris, the Geographical Societies\r\nof Italy and Berlin, the Academy of Bologna, and other learned bodies,\r\nenrolled him as an Honorary Member.\r\n\r\nReverting to 1869, we may note that Yule, when passing through Paris\r\nearly in the spring, became acquainted, through his friend M. Charles\r\nMaunoir, with the admirable work of exploration lately performed by\r\nLieut. Francis Garnier of the French Navy. It was a time of much\r\npolitical excitement in France, the eve of the famous _Plébiscite_,\r\nand the importance of Garnier’s work was not then recognised by his\r\ncountrymen. Yule saw its value, and on arrival in London went straight\r\nto Sir Roderick Murchison, laid the facts before him, and suggested\r\nthat no other traveller of the year had so good a claim to one of the\r\ntwo gold medals of the R.G.S. as this French naval Lieutenant. Sir\r\nRoderick was propitious, and accordingly in May the Patron’s medal\r\nwas assigned to Garnier, who was touchingly grateful to Yule; whilst\r\nthe French Minister of Marine marked his appreciation of Yule’s good\r\noffices by presenting him with the magnificent volumes commemorating\r\nthe expedition.[60]\r\n\r\nYule was in Paris in 1871, immediately after the suppression of the\r\nCommune, and his letters gave interesting accounts of the extraordinary\r\nstate of affairs then prevailing. In August, he served as President of\r\nthe Geographical Section of the British Association at its Edinburgh\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Palermo, he devoted himself specially to the\r\ngeography of the Oxus region, and the result appeared next year in his\r\nintroduction and notes to Wood’s _Journey_. Soon after his return to\r\nPalermo, he became greatly interested in the plans, about which he was\r\nconsulted, of an English church, the gift to the English community of\r\ntwo of its oldest members, Messrs Ingham and Whitaker. Yule’s share in\r\nthe enterprise gradually expanded, until he became a sort of volunteer\r\nclerk of the works, to the great benefit of his health, as this\r\noccupation during the next three years, whilst adding to his interests,\r\nalso kept him longer in the open air than would otherwise have been the\r\ncase. It was a real misfortune to Yule (and one of which he was himself\r\nat times conscious) that he had no taste for any out-of-door pursuits,\r\nneither for any form of natural science, nor for gardening, nor for\r\nany kind of sport nor games. Nor did he willingly ride.[61] He was\r\nalways restless away from his books. There can be no doubt that want of\r\nsufficient air and exercise, reacting on an impaired liver, had much\r\nto do with Yule’s unsatisfactory state of health and frequent extreme\r\ndepression. There was no lack of agreeable and intelligent society\r\nat Palermo (society that the present writer recalls with cordial\r\nregard), to which every winter brought pleasant temporary additions,\r\nboth English and foreign, the best of whom generally sought Yule’s\r\nacquaintance. Old friends too were not wanting; many found their way to\r\nPalermo, and when such came, he was willing to show them hospitality\r\nand to take them excursions, and occasionally enjoyed these. But though\r\nthe beautiful city and surrounding country were full of charm and\r\ninterest, Yule was too much pre-occupied by his own special engrossing\r\npursuits ever really to get the good of his surroundings, of which\r\nindeed he often seemed only half conscious.\r\n\r\nBy this time Yule had obtained, without ever having sought it, a\r\ndistinct and, in some respects, quite unique position in geographical\r\nscience. Although his _Essay on the Geography of the Oxus Region_\r\n(1872) received comparatively little public attention at home, it had\r\nyet made its mark once for all,[62] and from this time, if not earlier,\r\nYule’s high authority in all questions of Central Asian geography was\r\ngenerally recognised. He had long ere this, almost unconsciously,\r\nlaid the broad foundations of that “Yule method,” of which Baron von\r\nRichthofen has written so eloquently, declaring that not only in his\r\nown land, “but also in the literatures of France, Italy, Germany,\r\nand other countries, the powerful stimulating influence of the Yule\r\nmethod is visible.”[63] More than one writer has indeed boldly compared\r\nCentral Asia before Yule to Central Africa before Livingstone!\r\n\r\nYule had wrought from sheer love of the work and without expectation\r\nof public recognition, and it was therefore a great surprise as well\r\nas gratification to him, to find that the demand for his _Marco Polo_\r\nwas such as to justify the appearance of a second edition only a few\r\nyears after the first. The preparation of this enlarged edition, with\r\nmuch other miscellaneous work (see subjoined bibliography), and the\r\nsuperintendence of the building of the church already named, kept him\r\nfully occupied for the next three years.\r\n\r\nAmongst the parerga and miscellaneous occupations of Yule’s leisure\r\nhours in the period 1869–74, may be mentioned an interesting\r\ncorrespondence with Professor W. W. Skeat on the subject of _William of\r\nPalerne_ and Sicilian examples of the Werwolf; the skilful analysis and\r\nexposure of Klaproth’s false geography;[64] the purchase and despatch\r\nof Sicilian seeds and young trees for use in the Punjab, at the request\r\nof the Indian Forestry Department; translations (prepared for friends)\r\nof tracts on the cultivation of Sumach and the collection of Manna as\r\npractised in Sicily; also a number of small services rendered to the\r\nSouth Kensington Museum, at the request of the late Sir Henry Cole.\r\nThese latter included obtaining Italian and Sicilian bibliographic\r\ncontributions to the Science and Art Department’s _Catalogue of Books\r\non Art_, selecting architectural subjects to be photographed;[65]\r\nnegotiating the purchase of the original drawings illustrative of\r\nPadre B. Gravina’s great work on the Cathedral of Monreale; and\r\nsuperintending the execution of a copy in mosaic of the large mosaic\r\npicture (in the Norman Palatine Chapel, Palermo,) of the Entry of our\r\nLord into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1875, just after the publication of the second\r\nedition of _Marco Polo_, Yule had to mourn the loss of his noble wife.\r\nHe was absent from Sicily at the time, but returned a few hours after\r\nher death on 30th April. She had suffered for many years from a severe\r\nform of heart disease, but her end was perfect peace. She was laid to\r\nrest, amid touching tokens of both public and private sympathy, in the\r\nbeautiful camposanto on Monte Pellegrino. What her loss was to Yule\r\nonly his oldest and closest friends were in a position to realise.\r\nLong years of suffering had impaired neither the soundness of her\r\njudgment nor the sweetness, and even gaiety, of her happy, unselfish\r\ndisposition. And in spirit, as even in appearance, she retained to the\r\nvery last much of the radiance of her youth. Nor were her intellectual\r\ngifts less remarkable. Few who had once conversed with her ever forgot\r\nher, and certainly no one who had once known her intimately ever ceased\r\nto love her.[66]\r\n\r\nShortly after this calamity, Yule removed to London, and on the\r\nretirement of his old friend, Sir William Baker, from the India Council\r\nearly that autumn, Lord Salisbury at once selected him for the vacant\r\nseat. Nothing would ever have made him a party-man, but he always\r\nfollowed Lord Salisbury with conviction, and worked under him with\r\nsteady confidence.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Yule married, as his second wife, the daughter of an old\r\nfriend,[67] a very amiable woman twenty years his junior, who made\r\nhim very happy until her untimely death in 1881. From the time of his\r\njoining the India Council, his duties at the India Office of course\r\noccupied a great part of his time, but he also continued to do an\r\nimmense amount of miscellaneous literary work, as may be seen by\r\nreference to the subjoined bibliography, (itself probably incomplete).\r\nIn Council he invariably “showed his strong determination to endeavour\r\nto deal with questions on their own merits and not only by custom and\r\nprecedent.”[68] Amongst subjects in which he took a strong line of his\r\nown in the discussions of the Council, may be specially instanced his\r\naction in the matter of the cotton duties (in which he defended native\r\nIndian manufactures as against hostile Manchester interests); the\r\nVernacular Press Act, the necessity for which he fully recognised; and\r\nthe retention of Kandahar, for which he recorded his vote in a strong\r\nminute. In all these three cases, which are typical of many others,\r\nhis opinion was overruled, but having been carefully and deliberately\r\nformed, it remained unaffected by defeat.\r\n\r\nIn all matters connected with Central Asian affairs, Yule’s opinion\r\nalways carried great weight; some of his most competent colleagues\r\nindeed preferred his authority in this field to that of even Sir Henry\r\nRawlinson, possibly for the reason given by Sir M. Grant Duff, who has\r\nepigrammatically described the latter as good in Council but dangerous\r\nin counsel.[69]\r\n\r\nYule’s courageous independence and habit of looking at all public\r\nquestions by the simple light of what appeared to him right, yet\r\nwithout fads or doctrinairism, earned for him the respect of the\r\nsuccessive Secretaries of State under whom he served, and the warm\r\nregard and confidence of his other colleagues. The value attached to\r\nhis services in Council was sufficiently shown by the fact that when\r\nthe period of ten years (for which members are usually appointed),\r\nwas about to expire, Lord Hartington (now Duke of Devonshire), caused\r\nYule’s appointment to be renewed for life, under a special Act of\r\nParliament passed for this purpose in 1885.\r\n\r\nHis work as a member of the Army Sanitary Committee, brought him into\r\ncommunication with Miss Florence Nightingale, a privilege which he\r\ngreatly valued and enjoyed, though he used to say: “She is worse than a\r\nRoyal Commission to answer, and, in the most gracious charming manner\r\npossible, immediately finds out all I don’t know!” Indeed his devotion\r\nto the “Lady-in-Chief” was scarcely less complete than Kinglake’s.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Yule was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the Government\r\nIndian Engineering College at Cooper’s Hill, a post which added to his\r\nsphere of interests without materially increasing his work. In 1882, he\r\nwas much gratified by being named an Honorary Fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries of Scotland, more especially as it was to fill one of the\r\ntwo vacancies created by the deaths of Thomas Carlyle and Dean Stanley.\r\n\r\nYule had been President of the Hakluyt Society from 1877, and in\r\n1885 was elected President also of the Royal Asiatic Society. He\r\nwould probably also have been President of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, but for an untoward incident. Mention has already been made\r\nof his constant determination to judge all questions by the simple\r\ntouchstone of what he believed to be right, irrespective of personal\r\nconsiderations. It was in pursuance of these principles that, at the\r\ncost of great pain to himself and some misrepresentation, he in 1878\r\nsundered his long connection with the Royal Geographical Society,\r\nby resigning his seat on their Council, solely in consequence of\r\ntheir adoption of what he considered a wrong policy. This severance\r\noccurred just when it was intended to propose him as President. Some\r\nyears later, at the personal request of the late Lord Aberdare, a\r\nPresident in all respects worthy of the best traditions of that great\r\nSociety, Yule consented to rejoin the Council, which he re-entered as a\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, the University of Edinburgh celebrated its Tercentenary, when\r\nYule was selected as one of the recipients of the honorary degree\r\nof LL.D. His letters from Edinburgh, on this occasion, give a very\r\npleasant and amusing account of the festivity and of the celebrities\r\nhe met. Nor did he omit to chronicle the envious glances cast, as he\r\nalleged, by some British men of science on the splendours of foreign\r\nAcademic attire, on the yellow robes of the Sorbonne, and the Palms\r\nof the Institute of France! Pasteur was, he wrote, the one most\r\nenthusiastically acclaimed of all who received degrees.\r\n\r\nI think it was about the same time that M. Renan was in England, and\r\ncalled upon Sir Henry Maine, Yule, and others at the India Office.\r\nOn meeting just after, the colleagues compared notes as to their\r\ndistinguished but unwieldy visitor. “It seems that _le style n’est\r\npas l’homme même_ in _this_ instance,” quoth “Ancient Law” to\r\n“Marco Polo.” And here it may be remarked that Yule so completely\r\nidentified himself with his favourite traveller that he frequently\r\nsigned contributions to the public press as MARCUS PAULUS VENETUS or\r\nM.P.V. His more intimate friends also gave him the same _sobriquet_,\r\nand once, when calling on his old friend, Dr. John Brown (the beloved\r\nchronicler of _Rab and his Friends_), he was introduced by Dr. John to\r\nsome lion-hunting American visitors as “our Marco Polo.” The visitors\r\nevidently took the statement in a literal sense, and scrutinised Yule\r\nclosely.[70]\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Yule published his delightful _Anglo-Indian Glossary_, with the\r\nwhimsical but felicitous sub-title of _Hobson-Jobson_ (the name given\r\nby the rank and file of the British Army in India to the religious\r\nfestival in celebration of Hassan and Husaïn).\r\n\r\nThis _Glossary_ was an abiding interest to both Yule and the present\r\nwriter. Contributions of illustrative quotations came from most diverse\r\nand unexpected sources, and the arrival of each new word or happy\r\nquotation was quite an event, and gave such pleasure to the recipients\r\nas can only be fully understood by those who have shared in such\r\npursuits. The volume was dedicated in affecting terms to his elder\r\nbrother, Sir George Yule, who, unhappily, did not survive to see it\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn July 1885, the two brothers had taken the last of many happy\r\njourneys together, proceeding to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. A few\r\nmonths later, on 13th January 1886, the end came suddenly to the elder,\r\nfrom the effects of an accident at his own door.[71]\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted if Yule ever really got over the shock of this\r\nloss, though he went on with his work as usual, and served that year\r\nas a Royal Commissioner on the occasion of the Indian and Colonial\r\nExhibition of 1886.\r\n\r\nFrom 1878, when an accidental chill laid the foundations of an\r\nexhausting, though happily quite painless, malady, Yule’s strength\r\nhad gradually failed, although for several years longer his general\r\nhealth and energies still appeared unimpaired to a casual observer.\r\nThe condition of public affairs also, in some degree, affected his\r\nhealth injuriously. The general trend of political events from 1880 to\r\n1886 caused him deep anxiety and distress, and his righteous wrath at\r\nwhat he considered the betrayal of his country’s honour in the cases of\r\nFrere, of Gordon, and of Ireland, found strong, and, in a noble sense,\r\npassionate expression in both prose and verse. He was never in any\r\nsense a party man, but he often called himself “one of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nconverts,” _i.e._ one whom Gladstonian methods had compelled to break\r\nwith liberal tradition and prepossessions.\r\n\r\nNothing better expresses Yule’s feeling in the period referred to\r\nthan the following letter, written in reference to the R. E. Gordon\r\nMemorial,[72] but of much wider application: “Will you allow me an inch\r\nor two of space to say to my brother officers, ‘Have nothing to do with\r\nthe proposed Gordon Memorial.’\r\n\r\n“That glorious memory is in no danger of perishing and needs no\r\nmemorial. Sackcloth and silence are what it suggests to those who\r\nhave guided the action of England; and Englishmen must bear the\r\nresponsibility for that action and share its shame. It is too early for\r\natoning memorials; nor is it possible for those who take part in them\r\nto dissociate themselves from a repulsive hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n“Let every one who would fain bestow something in honour of the great\r\nvictim, do, in silence, some act of help to our soldiers or their\r\nfamilies, or to others who are poor and suffering.\r\n\r\n“In later days our survivors or successors may look back with softened\r\nsorrow and pride to the part which men of our corps have played in\r\nthese passing events, and Charles Gordon far in the front of all; and\r\nthen they may set up our little tablets, or what not—not to preserve\r\nthe memory of our heroes, but to maintain the integrity of our own\r\nrecord of the illustrious dead.”\r\n\r\nHappily Yule lived to see the beginning of better times for his\r\ncountry. One of the first indications of that national awakening was\r\nthe right spirit in which the public, for the most part, received Lord\r\nWolseley’s stirring appeal at the close of 1888, and Yule was so much\r\nstruck by the parallelism between Lord Wolseley’s warning and some\r\nwords of his own contained in the pseudo-Polo fragment (see above, end\r\nof Preface), that he sent Lord Wolseley the very last copy of the 1875\r\nedition of _Marco Polo_, with a vigorous expression of his sentiments.\r\n\r\nThat was probably Yule’s last utterance on a public question. The sands\r\nof life were now running low, and in the spring of 1889, he felt it\r\nright to resign his seat on the India Council, to which he had been\r\nappointed for life. On this occasion Lord Cross, then Secretary of\r\nState for India, successfully urged his acceptance of the K.C.S.I.,\r\nwhich Yule had refused several years before.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords, Viscount Cross subsequently referred to his\r\nresignation in the following terms. He said: “A vacancy on the Council\r\nhad unfortunately occurred through the resignation from ill-health of\r\nSir Henry Yule, whose presence on the Council had been of enormous\r\nadvantage to the natives of the country. A man of more kindly\r\ndisposition, thorough intelligence, high-minded, upright, honourable\r\ncharacter, he believed did not exist; and he would like to bear\r\ntestimony to the estimation in which he was held, and to the services\r\nwhich he had rendered in the office he had so long filled.”[73]\r\n\r\nThis year the Hakluyt Society published the concluding volume of Yule’s\r\nlast work of importance, the _Diary of Sir William Hedges_. He had for\r\nseveral years been collecting materials for a full memoir of his great\r\npredecessor in the domain of historical geography, the illustrious\r\nRennell.[74] This work was well advanced as to preliminaries, but was\r\nnot sufficiently developed for early publication at the time of Yule’s\r\ndeath, and ere it could be completed its place had been taken by a\r\nlater enterprise.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1889, Yule occupied much of his leisure by\r\ncollecting and revising for re-issue many of his miscellaneous\r\nwritings. Although not able to do much at a time, this desultory work\r\nkept him occupied and interested, and gave him much pleasure during\r\nmany months. It was, however, never completed. Yule went to the seaside\r\nfor a few weeks in the early summer, and subsequently many pleasant\r\ndays were spent by him among the Surrey hills, as the guest of his old\r\nfriends Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker. Of their constant and unwearied\r\nkindness, he always spoke with most affectionate gratitude. That\r\nautumn he took a great dislike to the English climate; he hankered\r\nafter sunshine, and formed many plans, eager though indefinite, for\r\nwintering at Cintra, a place whose perfect beauty had fascinated him\r\nin early youth. But increasing weakness made a journey to Portugal,\r\nor even the South of France, an alternative of which he also spoke,\r\nvery inexpedient, if not absolutely impracticable. Moreover, he\r\nwould certainly have missed abroad the many friends and multifarious\r\ninterests which still surrounded him at home. He continued to take\r\ndrives, and occasionally called on friends, up to the end of November,\r\nand it was not until the middle of December that increasing weakness\r\nobliged him to take to his bed. He was still, however, able to enjoy\r\nseeing his friends—some to the very end, and he had a constant stream\r\nof visitors, mostly old friends, but also a few newer ones, who were\r\nscarcely less welcome. He also kept up his correspondence to the last,\r\nthree attached brother R.E.’s, General Collinson, General Maclagan, and\r\nMajor W. Broadfoot, taking it in turn with the present writer to act as\r\nhis amanuensis.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 27th December, Yule received a telegram from Paris,\r\nannouncing his nomination that day as Corresponding Member of the\r\nInstitute of France (Académie des Inscriptions), one of the few\r\ndistinctions of any kind of which it can still be said that it has at\r\nno time lost any of its exalted dignity.\r\n\r\nAn honour of a different kind that came about the same time, and was\r\nscarcely less prized by him, was a very beautiful letter of farewell\r\nand benediction from Miss Florence Nightingale,[75] which he kept\r\nunder his pillow and read many times. On the 28th, he dictated to the\r\npresent writer his acknowledgment, also by telegraph, of the great\r\nhonour done him by the Institute. The message was in the following\r\nwords: “Reddo gratias, Illustrissimi Domini, ob honores tanto nimios\r\nquanto immeritos! Mihi robora deficiunt, vita collabitur, accipiatis\r\nvoluntatem pro facto. Cum corde pleno et gratissimo moriturus vos,\r\nIllustrissimi Domini, saluto.                                 YULE.”\r\n\r\nSunday, 29th December, was a day of the most dense black fog, and he\r\nfelt its oppression, but was much cheered by a visit from his ever\r\nfaithful friend, Collinson, who, with his usual unselfishness, came to\r\nhim that day at very great personal inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, 30th December, the day was clearer, and Henry Yule awoke\r\nmuch refreshed, and in a peculiarly happy and even cheerful frame\r\nof mind. He said he felt so comfortable. He spoke of his intended\r\nbook, and bade his daughter write about the inevitable delay to his\r\npublisher: “Go and write to John Murray,” were indeed his last words to\r\nher. During the morning he saw some friends and relations, but as noon\r\napproached his strength flagged, and after a period of unconsciousness,\r\nhe passed peacefully away in the presence of his daughter and of an\r\nold friend, who had come from Edinburgh to see him, but arrived too\r\nlate for recognition. Almost at the same time that Yule fell asleep,\r\nhis “stately message,”[76] was being read under the great Dome in\r\nParis. Some two hours after Yule had passed away, F.-M. Lord Napier\r\nof Magdala, called on an errand of friendship, and at his desire\r\nwas admitted to see the last of his early friend. When Lord Napier\r\ncame out, he said to the present writer, in his own reflective way:\r\n“He looks as if he had just settled to some great work.” With these\r\nsuggestive words of the great soldier, who was so soon, alas, to follow\r\nhis old friend to the work of another world, this sketch may fitly\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe following excellent verses (of unknown authorship) on Yule’s death,\r\nsubsequently appeared in the _Academy_:[77]\r\n\r\n    “‘Moriturus vos saluto’\r\n     Breathes his last the dying scholar—\r\n     Tireless student, brilliant writer;\r\n     He ‘salutes his age’ and journeys\r\n     To the Undiscovered Country.\r\n     There await him with warm welcome\r\n     All the heroes of old Story—\r\n     The Venetians, the Cà Polo,\r\n     Marco, Nicolo, Maffeo,\r\n     Odoric of Pordenone,\r\n     Ibn Batuta, Marignolli,\r\n     Benedict de Goës—‘Seeking\r\n     Lost Cathay and finding Heaven.’\r\n     Many more whose lives he cherished\r\n     With the piety of learning;\r\n     Fading records, buried pages,\r\n     Failing lights and fires forgotten,\r\n     By his energy recovered,\r\n     By his eloquence re-kindled.\r\n     ‘Moriturus vos saluto’\r\n     Breathes his last the dying scholar,\r\n     And the far off ages answer:\r\n     _Immortales te salutant_.                 D. M.”\r\n\r\nThe same idea had been previously embodied, in very felicitous\r\nlanguage, by the late General Sir William Lockhart, in a letter which\r\nthat noble soldier addressed to the present writer a few days after\r\nYule’s death. And Yule himself would have taken pleasure in the idea of\r\nthose meetings with his old travellers, which seemed so certain to his\r\nsurviving friends.[78]\r\n\r\nHe rests in the old cemetery at Tunbridge Wells, with his second wife,\r\nas he had directed. A great gathering of friends attended the first\r\npart of the burial service which was held in London on 3rd January,\r\n1890. Amongst those present were witnesses of every stage of his\r\ncareer, from his boyish days at the High School of Edinburgh downwards.\r\nHis daughter, of course, was there, led by the faithful, peerless\r\nfriend who was so soon to follow him into the Undiscovered Country.[79]\r\nShe and his youngest nephew, with two cousins and a few old friends,\r\nfollowed his remains over the snow to the graveside. The epitaph\r\nsubsequently inscribed on the tomb was penned by Yule himself, but is\r\nby no means representative of his powers in a kind of composition in\r\nwhich he had so often excelled in the service of others. As a composer\r\nof epitaphs and other monumental inscriptions few of our time have\r\nsurpassed, if any have equalled him, in his best efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SIR GEORGE UDNY YULE, C.B., K.C.S.I.[80]\r\n\r\nGeorge Udny Yule, born at Inveresk in 1813, passed through Haileybury\r\ninto the Bengal Civil Service, which he entered at the age of 18 years.\r\nFor twenty-five years his work lay in Eastern Bengal. He gradually\r\nbecame known to the Government for his activity and good sense, but\r\nwon a far wider reputation as a mighty hunter, alike with hog-spear\r\nand double barrel. By 1856 the roll of his slain tigers exceeded four\r\nhundred, some of them of special fame; after that he continued slaying\r\nhis tigers, but ceased to count them. For some years he and a few\r\nfriends used annually to visit the plains of the Brahmaputra, near the\r\nGarrow Hills—an entirely virgin country then, and swarming with large\r\ngame. Yule used to describe his once seeing seven rhinoceroses at once\r\non the great plain, besides herds of wild buffalo and deer of several\r\nkinds. One of the party started the theory that Noah’s Ark had been\r\nshipwrecked there! In those days George Yule was the only man to whom\r\nthe Maharajah of Nepaul, Sir Jung Bahadur, conceded leave to shoot\r\nwithin his frontier.\r\n\r\nYule was first called from his useful obscurity in 1856. The year\r\nbefore, the Sonthals in insurrection disturbed the long unbroken\r\npeace of the Delta. These were a numerous non-Aryan, uncivilised,\r\nbut industrious race, driven wild by local mismanagement, and the\r\noppressions of Hindoo usurers acting through the regulation courts.\r\nAfter the suppression of their rising, Yule was selected by Sir F.\r\nHalliday, who knew his man, to be Commissioner of the Bhagulpoor\r\nDivision, containing some six million souls, and embracing the hill\r\ncountry of the Sonthals. He obtained sanction to a code for the latter,\r\nwhich removed these people entirely from the Court system, and its\r\ntribe of leeches, and abolished all intermediaries between the Sahib\r\nand the Sonthal peasant. Through these measures, and his personal\r\ninfluence, aided by picked assistants, he was able to effect, with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, not only their entire pacification, but such\r\na beneficial change in their material condition, that they have risen\r\nfrom a state of barbarous penury to comparative prosperity and comfort.\r\n\r\nGeorge Yule was thus engaged when the Mutiny broke out, and it soon\r\nmade itself felt in the districts under him. To its suppression within\r\nhis limits, he addressed himself with characteristic vigour. Thoroughly\r\ntrusted by every class—by his Government, by those under him, by\r\nplanters and by Zemindars—he organised a little force, comprising a\r\nsmall detachment of the 5th Regiment, a party of British sailors,\r\nmounted volunteers from the districts, etc., and of this he became\r\npractically the captain. Elephants were collected from all quarters to\r\nspare the legs of his infantry and sailors; while dog-carts were turned\r\ninto limbers for the small three-pounders of the seamen. And with this\r\nlittle army George Yule scoured the Trans-Gangetic districts, leading\r\nit against bodies of the Mutineers, routing them upon more than one\r\noccasion, and out-manœuvring them by his astonishing marches, till\r\nhe succeeded in driving them across the Nepaul frontier. No part of\r\nBengal was at any time in such danger, and nowhere was the danger more\r\nspeedily and completely averted.\r\n\r\nAfter this Yule served for two or three years as Chief Commissioner\r\nof Oudh, where in 1862 he married Miss Pemberton, the daughter of a\r\nvery able father, and the niece of Sir Donald MacLeod, of honoured\r\nand beloved memory. Then for four or five years he was Resident at\r\nHyderabad, where he won the enduring friendship of Sir Salar Jung.\r\n“Everywhere he showed the same characteristic firm but benignant\r\njustice. Everywhere he gained the lasting attachment of all with whom\r\nhe had intimate dealings—except tigers and scoundrels.”\r\n\r\nMany years later, indignant at the then apparently supine attitude\r\nof the British Government in the matter of the Abyssinian captives,\r\nGeorge Yule wrote a letter (necessarily published without his name,\r\nas he was then on the Governor-General’s Council), to the editor of\r\nan influential Indian paper, proposing a private expedition should\r\nbe organised for their delivery from King Theodore, and inviting the\r\neditor (Dr. George Smith) to open a list of subscriptions in his paper\r\nfor this purpose, to which Yule offered to contribute £2000 by way of\r\nbeginning. Although impracticable in itself, it is probable that, as in\r\nother cases, the existence of such a project may have helped to force\r\nthe Government into action. The particulars of the above incident were\r\nprinted by Dr. Smith in his _Memoir of the Rev. John Wilson_, but are\r\ngiven here from memory.\r\n\r\nFrom Hyderabad he was promoted in 1867 to the Governor-General’s\r\nCouncil, but his health broke down under the sedentary life, and he\r\nretired and came home in 1869.\r\n\r\nAfter some years of country life in Scotland, where he bought a small\r\nproperty, he settled near his brother in London, where he was a\r\nprincipal instrument in enabling Sir George Birdwood to establish the\r\ncelebration of Primrose Day (for he also was “one of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nconverts”). Sir George Yule never sought ‘London Society’ or public\r\nemployment, but in 1877 he was offered and refused the post of\r\nFinancial Adviser to the Khedive under the Dual control. When his\r\nfeelings were stirred he made useful contributions to the public press,\r\nwhich, after his escape from official trammels, were always signed.\r\nThe very last of these (_St. James Gazette_, 24th February 1885) was\r\na spirited protest against the snub administered by the late Lord\r\nDerby, as Secretary of State, to the Colonies, when they had generously\r\noffered assistance in the Soudan campaign. He lived a quiet, happy, and\r\nuseful life in London, where he was the friend and unwearied helper of\r\nall who needed help. He found his chief interests in books and flowers,\r\nand in giving others pleasure. Of rare unselfishness and sweet nature,\r\nsingle in mind and motive, fearing God and knowing no other fear, he\r\nwas regarded by a large number of people with admiring affection. He\r\nmet his death by a fall on the frosty pavement at his door, in the very\r\nact of doing a kindness. An interesting sketch of Sir George Yule’s\r\nIndian career, by one who knew him thoroughly, is to be found in Sir\r\nEdward Braddon’s _Thirty Years of Shikar_. An account of his share in\r\nthe origin of Primrose Day appeared in the _St. James’ Gazette_ during\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] There is a vague tradition that these Yules descend from the same\r\n    stock as the Scandinavian family of the same name, which gave\r\n    Denmark several men of note, including the great naval hero Niels\r\n    Juel. The portraits of these old Danes offer a certain resemblance\r\n    of type to those of their Scots namesakes, and Henry Yule liked\r\n    to play with the idea, much in the same way that he took humorous\r\n    pleasure in his reputed descent from Michael Scott, the Wizard!\r\n    (This tradition was more historical, however, and stood thus:\r\n    Yule’s great grandmother was a Scott of Ancrum, and the Scotts of\r\n    Ancrum had established their descent from Sir Michael Scott of\r\n    Balwearie, reputed to be the Wizard.) Be their origin what it may,\r\n    Yule’s forefathers had been already settled on the Border hills\r\n    for many generations, when in the time of James VI. they migrated\r\n    to the lower lands of East Lothian, where in the following reign\r\n    they held the old fortalice of Fentoun Tower of Nisbet of Dirleton.\r\n    When Charles II. empowered his Lord Lyon to issue certificates of\r\n    arms (in place of the Lyon records removed and lost at sea by the\r\n    Cromwellian Government), these Yules were among those who took out\r\n    confirmation of arms, and the original document is still in the\r\n    possession of the head of the family.\r\n\r\n    Though Yules of sorts are still to be found in Scotland, the\r\n    present writer is the only member of the Fentoun Tower family now\r\n    left in the country, and of the few remaining out of it most are to\r\n    be found in the Army List.\r\n\r\n[2] The literary taste which marked William Yule probably came to him\r\n    from his grandfather, the Rev. James Rose, Episcopal Minister of\r\n    Udny, in Aberdeenshire. James Rose, a non-jurant (_i.e._ one who\r\n    refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Hanoverian King), was\r\n    a man of devout, large, and tolerant mind, as shown by writings\r\n    still extant. His father, John Rose, was the younger son of the\r\n    14th Hugh of Kilravock. He married Margaret Udny of Udny, and\r\n    was induced by her to sell his pleasant Ross-shire property\r\n    and invest the proceeds in her own bleak Buchan. When George\r\n    Yule (about 1759) brought home Elizabeth Rose as his wife, the\r\n    popular feeling against the Episcopal Church was so strong and\r\n    bitter in Lothian, that all the men of the family—themselves\r\n    Presbyterians—accompanied Mrs. Yule as a bodyguard on the occasion\r\n    of her first attendance at the Episcopal place of worship. Years\r\n    after, when dissensions had arisen in the Church of Scotland,\r\n    Elizabeth Yule succoured and protected some of the dissident\r\n    Presbyterian ministers from their persecutors.\r\n\r\n[3] General Collinson in _Royal Engineers’ Journal_, 1st Feb. 1890. The\r\n    gifted author of this excellent sketch himself passed away on 22nd\r\n    April 1902.\r\n\r\n[4] The grave thoughtful face of William Yule was conspicuous in the\r\n    picture of a Durbar (by an Italian artist, but _not_ Zoffany),\r\n    which long hung on the walls of the Nawab’s palace at Lucknow. This\r\n    picture disappeared during the Mutiny of 1857.\r\n\r\n[5] Colonel Udny Yule, C.B. “When he joined, his usual _nomen_ and\r\n    _cognomen_ puzzled the staff-sergeant at Fort-William, and after\r\n    much boggling on the cadet parade, the name was called out _Whirly\r\n    Wheel_, which produced no reply, till some one at a venture\r\n    shouted, ‘sick in hospital.’” (_Athenæum_, 24th Sept. 1881.) The\r\n    ship which took Udny Yule to India was burnt at sea. After keeping\r\n    himself afloat for several hours in the water, he was rescued by a\r\n    passing ship and taken back to the Mauritius, whence, having lost\r\n    everything but his cadetship, he made a fresh start for India,\r\n    where he and William for many years had a common purse. Colonel\r\n    Udny Yule commanded a brigade at the Siege of Cornelis (1811),\r\n    which gave us Java, and afterwards acted as Resident under Sir\r\n    Stamford Raffles. Forty-five years after the retrocession of Java,\r\n    Henry Yule found the memory of his uncle still cherished there.\r\n\r\n[6] Article on the Oriental Section of the British Museum Library in\r\n    _Athenæum_, 24th Sept. 1881. Major Yule’s Oriental Library was\r\n    presented by his sons to the British Museum a few years after his\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n[7] It may be amusing to note that he was considered an almost\r\n    dangerous person because he read the _Scotsman_ newspaper!\r\n\r\n[8] _Athenæum_, 24th Sept. 1881.

He was one\r\n    of the earliest corresponding members of the Society of Antiquaries\r\n    of Scotland, and the author of some botanical tracts.\r\n\r\n[10] According to Brunet, by Lucas Pennis after Antonio Tempesta.\r\n\r\n[11] _Concerning some little-known Travellers in the East_. ASIATIC\r\n    QUARTERLY, vol. v. (1888).\r\n\r\n[12] William Yule died in 1839, and rests with his parents, brothers,\r\n    and many others of his kindred, in the ruined chancel of the\r\n    ancient Norman Church of St. Andrew, at Gulane, which had been\r\n    granted to the Yule family as a place of burial by the Nisbets\r\n    of Dirleton, in remembrance of the old kindly feeling subsisting\r\n    for generations between them and their tacksmen in Fentoun\r\n    Tower. Though few know its history, a fragrant memorial of this\r\n    wise and kindly scholar is still conspicuous in Edinburgh. The\r\n    magnificent wall-flower that has, for seventy summers, been a\r\n    glory of the Castle rock, was originally all sown by the patient\r\n    hand of Major Yule, the self-sowing of each subsequent year, of\r\n    course, increasing the extent of bloom. Lest the extraordinarily\r\n    severe spring of 1895 should have killed off much of the old\r\n    stock, another (but much more limited) sowing on the northern\r\n    face of the rock was in that year made by his grand-daughter, the\r\n    present writer, with the sanction and active personal help of\r\n    the lamented General (then Colonel) Andrew Wauchope of Niddrie\r\n    Marischal. In Scotland, where the memory of this noble soldier is\r\n    so greatly revered, some may like to know this little fact. May the\r\n    wall-flower of the Castle rock long flourish a fragrant memorial of\r\n    two faithful soldiers and true-hearted Scots.\r\n\r\n[13] Obituary notice of Yule, by Gen. R.

He was a man of\r\n    distinguished presence, and great charm of manner to those whom he\r\n    liked, which were by no means all. The present writer holds him in\r\n    affectionate remembrance, and owes to early correspondence with\r\n    him much of the information embodied in preceding notes. He served\r\n    on the Canadian Boundary Commission of 1817, and on the Commission\r\n    of National Defence of 1859, was prominent in the Ordnance Survey,\r\n    and successively Commanding R.E. in Malta and Scotland. He was\r\n    Engineer to Sir C. Fellows’ Expedition, which gave the nation the\r\n    Lycian Marbles, and while Commanding R.E. in Edinburgh, was largely\r\n    instrumental in rescuing St. Margaret’s Chapel in the Castle\r\n    from desecration and oblivion. He was a thorough Scot, and never\r\n    willingly tolerated the designation N.B. on even a letter. He had\r\n    cultivated tastes, and under a somewhat austere exterior he had a\r\n    most tender heart. When already past sixty, he made a singularly\r\n    happy marriage to a truly good woman, who thoroughly appreciated\r\n    him. He was the author of several Memoirs on professional subjects.\r\n    He rests in St. Andrew’s, Gulane.\r\n\r\n[26] Collinson’s _Memoir of Yule_.\r\n\r\n[27] Notes on the Iron of the Khasia Hills and Notes on the Khasia\r\n    Hills and People, both in Journal of the R.

Scissors of elaborate design,\r\n    usually damascened or gilt, used to form a most important item in\r\n    every set of Oriental writing implements. Even long after adhesive\r\n    envelopes had become common in European Turkey, their use was\r\n    considered over familiar, if not actually disrespectful, for formal\r\n    letters, and there was a particular traditional knack in cutting\r\n    and folding the special envelope for each missive, which was\r\n    included in the instruction given by every competent _Khoja_ as the\r\n    present writer well remembers in the quiet years that ended with\r\n    the disasters of 1877.\r\n\r\n[36] Collinson’s _Memoir of Yule, Royal Engineer Journal_.\r\n\r\n[37] Extract from Preface to _Ava_, edition of 1858.\r\n\r\n[38] The present whereabouts of this picture is unknown to the writer.\r\n    It was lent to Yule in 1889 by Lord Dalhousie’s surviving daughter\r\n    (for whom he had strong regard and much sympathy), and was returned\r\n    to her early in 1890, but is not named in the catalogue of Lady\r\n    Susan’s effects, sold at Edinburgh in 1898 after her death. At\r\n    that sale the present writer had the satisfaction of securing for\r\n    reverent preservation the watch used throughout his career by the\r\n    great Marquess.\r\n\r\n[39] Now in the writer’s possession. It was for many years on\r\n    exhibition in the Edinburgh and South Kensington Museums.\r\n\r\n[40] Article by Yule on Lord Lawrence, _Quarterly Review_ for April,\r\n    1883.\r\n\r\n[41] Messrs. Smith & Elder.\r\n\r\n[42] Preface to _Narrative of a Mission to the Court of Ava_. Before\r\n    these words were written, Yule had had the sorrow of losing his\r\n    elder brother Robert, who had fallen in action before Delhi (19th\r\n    June, 1857), whilst in command of his regiment, the 9th Lancers.\r\n    Robert Abercromby Yule (born 1817) was a very noble character and\r\n    a fine soldier. He had served with distinction in the campaigns in\r\n    Afghanistan and the Sikh Wars, and was the author of an excellent\r\n    brief treatise on Cavalry Tactics. He had a ready pencil and\r\n    a happy turn for graceful verse. In prose his charming little\r\n    allegorical tale for children, entitled _The White Rhododendron_,\r\n    is as pure and graceful as the flower whose name it bears. Like\r\n    both his brothers, he was at once chivalrous and devout, modest,\r\n    impulsive, and impetuous. No officer was more beloved by his men\r\n    than Robert Yule, and when some one met them carrying back his\r\n    covered body from the field and enquired of the sergeant: “Who\r\n    have you got there?” the reply was: “Colonel Yule, and better have\r\n    lost half the regiment, sir.” It was in the chivalrous effort to\r\n    extricate some exposed guns that he fell. Some one told afterwards\r\n    that when asked to go to the rescue, he turned in the saddle,\r\n    looked back wistfully on his regiment, well knowing the cost of\r\n    such an enterprise, then gave the order to advance and charge. “No\r\n    stone marks the spot where Yule went down, but no stone is needed\r\n    to commemorate his valour” (Archibald Forbes, in _Daily News_,\r\n    8th Feb. 1876). At the time of his death Colonel R. A. Yule had\r\n    been recommended for the C.B. His eldest son, Colonel J. H. Yule,\r\n    C.B., distinguished himself in several recent campaigns (on the\r\n    Burma-Chinese frontier, in Tirah, and South Africa).\r\n\r\n[43] Baker went home in November, 1857, but did not retire until the\r\n    following year.\r\n\r\n[44] Nothing was more worthy of respect in Yule’s fine character\r\n    than the energy and success with which he mastered his natural\r\n    temperament in the last ten years of his life, when few would have\r\n    guessed his original fiery disposition.\r\n\r\n[45] Not without cause did Sir J. P. Grant officially record that “to\r\n    his imperturbable temper the Government of India owed much.”\r\n\r\n[46] Yule’s colour-blindness was one of the cases in which Dalton,\r\n    the original investigator of this optical defect, took special\r\n    interest. At a later date (1859) he sent Yule, through Professor\r\n    Wilson, skeins of coloured silks to name. Yule’s elder brother\r\n    Robert had the same peculiarity of sight, and it was also present\r\n    in two earlier and two later generations of their mother’s\r\n    family—making five generations in all. But in no case did it pass\r\n    from parent to child, always passing in these examples, by a sort\r\n    of Knight’s move, from uncle to nephew. Another peculiarity of\r\n    Yule’s more difficult to describe was the instinctive association\r\n    of certain architectural forms or images with the days of the\r\n    week. He once, and once only (in 1843), met another person, a\r\n    lady who was a perfect stranger, with the same peculiarity. About\r\n    1878–79 he contributed some notes on this obscure subject to\r\n    one of the newspapers, in connection with the researches of Mr.\r\n    Francis Galton, on Visualisation, but the particulars are not now\r\n    accessible.\r\n\r\n[47] From Yule’s verses on her grave.\r\n\r\n[48] Lord Canning to Lady Clanricarde: Letter dated Barrackpoor, 19th\r\n    Nov. 1861, 7 A.M., printed in _Two Noble Lives_, by A. J. C. Hare,\r\n    and here reproduced by Mr. Hare’s permission.\r\n\r\n[49] Lord Canning’s letter to Lady Clanricarde. He gave to Yule Lady\r\n    Canning’s own silver drinking-cup, which she had constantly used.\r\n    It is carefully treasured, with other Canning and Dalhousie relics,\r\n    by the present writer.\r\n\r\n[50] Many years later Yule wrote of Lord Canning as follows: “He had\r\n    his defects, no doubt. He had not at first that entire grasp of\r\n    the situation that was wanted at such a time of crisis. But there\r\n    is a virtue which in these days seems unknown to Parliamentary\r\n    statesmen in England—Magnanimity. Lord Canning was an English\r\n    statesman, and he was surpassingly magnanimous. There is another\r\n    virtue which in Holy Writ is taken as the type and sum of all\r\n    righteousness—Justice—and he was eminently just. The misuse\r\n    of special powers granted early in the Mutiny called for Lord\r\n    Canning’s interference, and the consequence was a flood of savage\r\n    abuse; the violence and bitterness of which it is now hard to\r\n    realise.” (_Quarterly Review_, April, 1883, p. 306.)\r\n\r\n[51] During the next ten years Yule continued to visit London annually\r\n    for two or three months in the spring or early summer.\r\n\r\n[52] Now in the writer’s possession. They appear in the well-known\r\n    portrait of Lord Canning reading a despatch.\r\n\r\n[53] Lord Canning’s recommendation had been mislaid, and the India\r\n    Office was disposed to ignore it. It was Lord Canning’s old friend\r\n    and Eton chum, Lord Granville, who obtained this tardy justice for\r\n    Yule, instigated thereto by that most faithful friend, Sir Roderick\r\n    Murchison.\r\n\r\n[54] I cannot let the mention of this time of lonely sickness and\r\n    trial pass without recording here my deep gratitude to our dear\r\n    and honoured friend, John Ruskin. As my dear mother stood on the\r\n    threshold between life and death at Mornex that sad spring, he\r\n    was untiring in all kindly offices of friendship. It was her old\r\n    friend, Principal A. J. Scott (then eminent, now forgotten), who\r\n    sent him to call. He came to see us daily when possible, sometimes\r\n    bringing MSS. of Rossetti and others to read aloud (and who could\r\n    equal his reading?), and when she was too ill for this, or himself\r\n    absent, he would send not only books and flowers to brighten the\r\n    bare rooms of the hillside inn (then very primitive), but his own\r\n    best treasures of Turner and W. Hunt, drawings and illuminated\r\n    missals. It was an anxious solace; and though most gratefully\r\n    enjoyed, these treasures were never long retained.\r\n\r\n[55] Villa Mansi, nearly opposite the old Ducal Palace. With its\r\n    private chapel, it formed three sides of a small _place_ or court.\r\n\r\n[56] He also at all times spared no pains to enforce that ideal on\r\n    other index-makers, who were not always grateful for his sound\r\n    doctrine!\r\n\r\n[57] He saw a good deal of the outbreak when taking small comforts to a\r\n    friend, the Commandant of the Military School, who was captured and\r\n    imprisoned by the insurgents.\r\n\r\n[58] After 1869 he discontinued sea-bathing.\r\n\r\n[59] This was Yule’s first geographical honour, but he had been elected\r\n    into the Athenæum Club, under “Rule II.,” in January, 1867.\r\n\r\n[60] Garnier took a distinguished part in the Defence of Paris in\r\n    1870–71, after which he resumed his naval service in the East,\r\n    where he was killed in action. His last letter to Yule contained\r\n    the simple announcement “_J’ai pris Hanoï_” a modest terseness of\r\n    statement worthy of the best naval traditions.\r\n\r\n[61] One year the present writer, at her mother’s desire, induced him\r\n    to take walks of 10 to 12 miles with her, but interesting and\r\n    lovely as the scenery was, he soon wearied for his writing-table\r\n    (even bringing his work with him), and thus little permanent good\r\n    was effected. And it was just the same afterwards in Scotland,\r\n    where an old Highland gillie, describing his experience of the Yule\r\n    brothers, said: “I was liking to take out Sir George, for _he_\r\n    takes the time to enjoy the hills, but (plaintively), the Kornel is\r\n    no good, for he’s just as restless as a water-wagtail!” If there\r\n    be any _mal de l’écritoire_ corresponding to _mal du pays_, Yule\r\n    certainly had it.\r\n\r\n[62] The Russian Government in 1873 paid the same work the very\r\n    practical compliment of circulating it largely amongst their\r\n    officers in Central Asia.\r\n\r\n[63] “Auch in den Literaturen von Frankreich, Italien, Deutschland und\r\n    andere Ländern ist der mächtig treibende Einfluss der Yuleschen\r\n    Methode, welche wissenschaftliche Grundlichkeit mit anmuthender\r\n    Form verbindet, bemerkbar.” (_Verhandlungen der Gesellschaft für\r\n    Erdkunde zu Berlin_, Band XVII. No. 2.)\r\n\r\n[64] This subject is too lengthy for more than cursory allusion here,\r\n    but the patient analytic skill and keen venatic instinct with\r\n    which Yule not only proved the forgery of the alleged _Travels of\r\n    Georg Ludwig von ——_ (that had been already established by Lord\r\n    Strangford, whose last effort it was, and Sir Henry Rawlinson),\r\n    but step by step traced it home to the arch-culprit Klaproth, was\r\n    nothing less than masterly.\r\n\r\n[65] This is probably the origin of the odd misstatement as to Yule\r\n    occupying himself at Palermo with photography, made in the\r\n    delightful _Reminiscences_ of the late Colonel Balcarres Ramsay.\r\n    Yule never attempted photography after 1852.\r\n\r\n[66] She was a woman of fine intellect and wide reading; a skilful\r\n    musician, who also sang well, and a good amateur artist in the\r\n    style of Aug. Delacroix (of whom she was a favourite pupil). Of\r\n    French and Italian she had a thorough and literary mastery, and\r\n    how well she knew her own language is shown by the sound and pure\r\n    English of a story she published in early life, under the pseudonym\r\n    of Max Lyle (_Fair Oaks, or The Experiences of Arnold Osborne,\r\n    M.D._, 2 vols., 1856). My mother was partly of Highland descent on\r\n    both sides, and many of her fine qualities were very characteristic\r\n    of that race. Before her marriage she took an active part in many\r\n    good works, and herself originated the useful School for the Blind\r\n    at Bath, in a room which she hired with her pocket-money, where she\r\n    and her friend Miss Elwin taught such of the blind poor as they\r\n    could gather together.\r\n\r\n    In the tablet which he erected to her memory in the family\r\n    burial-place of St. Andrew’s, Gulane, her husband described her\r\n    thus:—“A woman singular in endowments, in suffering, and in faith;\r\n    to whom to live was Christ, to die was gain.”\r\n\r\n[67] Mary Wilhelmina, daughter of F.

E. Journal_ in 1881. He was extremely proud of\r\n    the circumstance that Rennell’s surviving grand-daughter presented\r\n    to him a beautiful wax medallion portrait of the great geographer.\r\n    This wonderfully life-like presentment was bequeathed by Yule to\r\n    his friend Sir Joseph Hooker, who presented it to the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[75] Knowing his veneration for that noble lady, I had written to tell\r\n    her of his condition, and to ask her to give him this last pleasure\r\n    of a few words. The response was such as few but herself could\r\n    write. This letter was not to be found after my father’s death,\r\n    and I can only conjecture that it must either have been given away\r\n    by himself (which is most improbable), or was appropriated by some\r\n    unauthorised outsider.\r\n\r\n[76] So Sir M.

OBSCURITIES IN THE HISTORY OF HIS LIFE AND BOOK.\r\n                         RAMUSIO’S STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obscurities of Polo’s Book, and personal History.]\r\n\r\n1. With all the intrinsic interest of Marco Polo’s Book it may perhaps\r\nbe doubted if it would have continued to exercise such fascination on\r\nmany minds through successive generations were it not for the difficult\r\nquestions which it suggests. It is a great book of puzzles, whilst our\r\nconfidence in the man’s veracity is such that we feel certain every\r\npuzzle has a solution.\r\n\r\nAnd such difficulties have not attached merely to the identification\r\nof places, the interpretation of outlandish terms, or the illustration\r\nof obscure customs; for strange entanglements have perplexed also the\r\nchief circumstances of the Traveller’s life and authorship. The time\r\nof the dictation of his Book and of the execution of his Last Will\r\nhave been almost the only undisputed epochs in his biography. The year\r\nof his birth has been contested, and the date of his death has not\r\nbeen recorded; the critical occasion of his capture by the Genoese, to\r\nwhich we seem to owe the happy fact that he did not go down mute to\r\nthe tomb of his fathers, has been made the subject of chronological\r\ndifficulties; there are in the various texts of his story variations\r\nhard to account for; the very tongue in which it was written down\r\nhas furnished a question, solved only in our own age, and in a most\r\nunexpected manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ramusio, his earliest biographer. His account of Polo.]\r\n\r\n2. The first person who attempted to gather and string the facts of\r\nMarco Polo’s personal history was his countryman, the celebrated John\r\nBaptist Ramusio. His essay abounds in what we now know to be errors of\r\ndetail, but, prepared as it was when traditions of the Traveller were\r\nstill rife in Venice, a genuine thread runs through it which could\r\nnever have been spun in later days, and its presentation seems to me an\r\nessential element in any full discourse upon the subject.\r\n\r\nRamusio’s preface to the Book of Marco Polo, which opens the second\r\nvolume of his famous Collection of Voyages and Travels, and is\r\naddressed to his learned friend Jerome Fracastoro, after referring to\r\nsome of the most noted geographers of antiquity, proceeds:[1]—\r\n\r\n  “Of all that I have named, Ptolemy, as the latest, possessed\r\n  the greatest extent of knowledge. Thus, towards the North, his\r\n  knowledge carries him beyond the Caspian, and he is aware of its\r\n  being shut in all round like a lake,—a fact which was unknown\r\n  in the days of Strabo and Pliny, though the Romans were already\r\n  lords of the world. But though his knowledge extends so far, a\r\n  tract of 15 degrees beyond that sea he can describe only as Terra\r\n  Incognita; and towards the South he is fain to apply the same\r\n  character to all beyond the Equinoxial. In these unknown regions,\r\n  as regards the South, the first to make discoveries have been the\r\n  Portuguese captains of our own age; but as regards the North and\r\n  North-East the discoverer was the Magnifico Messer Marco Polo, an\r\n  honoured nobleman of Venice, nearly 300 years since, as may be\r\n  read more fully in his own Book. And in truth it makes one marvel\r\n  to consider the immense extent of the journeys made, first by the\r\n  Father and Uncle of the said Messer Marco, when they proceeded\r\n  continually towards the East-North-East, all the way to the Court\r\n  of the Great Can and the Emperor of the Tartars; and afterwards\r\n  again by the three of them when, on their return homeward, they\r\n  traversed the Eastern and Indian Seas. Nor is that all, for one\r\n  marvels also how the aforesaid gentleman was able to give such an\r\n  orderly description of all that he had seen; seeing that such an\r\n  accomplishment was possessed by very few in his day, and he had\r\n  had a large part of his nurture among those uncultivated Tartars,\r\n  without any regular training in the art of composition. His Book\r\n  indeed, owing to the endless errors and inaccuracies that had\r\n  crept into it, had come for many years to be regarded as fabulous;\r\n  and the opinion prevailed that the names of cities and provinces\r\n  contained therein were all fictitious and imaginary, without any\r\n  ground in fact, or were (I might rather say) mere dreams.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ramusio vindicates Polo’s Geography.]\r\n\r\n  3. “Howbeit, during the last hundred years, persons acquainted\r\n  with Persia have begun to recognise the existence of Cathay. The\r\n  voyages of the Portuguese also towards the North-East, beyond\r\n  the Golden Chersonese, have brought to knowledge many cities and\r\n  provinces of India, and many islands likewise, with those very\r\n  names which our Author applies to them; and again, on reaching\r\n  the Land of China, they have ascertained from the people of that\r\n  region (as we are told by Sign. John de Barros, a Portuguese\r\n  gentleman, in his Geography) that Canton, one of the chief cities\r\n  of that kingdom, is in 30⅔° of latitude, with the coast running\r\n  N.E. and S.W.; that after a distance of 275 leagues the said coast\r\n  turns towards the N.W.; and that there are three provinces along\r\n  the sea-board, Mangi, Zanton, and Quinzai, the last of which is\r\n  the principal city and the King’s Residence, standing in 46° of\r\n  latitude. And proceeding yet further the coast attains to 50°.[2]\r\n  Seeing then how many particulars are in our day becoming known of\r\n  that part of the world concerning which Messer Marco has written,\r\n  I have deemed it reasonable to publish his book, with the aid of\r\n  several copies written (as I judge) more than 200 years ago, in a\r\n  perfectly accurate form, and one vastly more faithful than that in\r\n  which it has been heretofore read. And thus the world shall not\r\n  lose the fruit that may be gathered from so much diligence and\r\n  industry expended upon so honourable a branch of knowledge.”\r\n\r\n4. Ramusio, then, after a brief apologetic parallel of the marvels\r\nrelated by Polo with those related by the Ancients and by the modern\r\ndiscoverers in the West, such as Columbus and Cortes, proceeds:—\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ramusio compares Polo with Columbus.]\r\n\r\n  “And often in my own mind, comparing the land explorations of these\r\n  our Venetian gentlemen with the sea explorations of the aforesaid\r\n  Signor Don Christopher, I have asked myself which of the two were\r\n  really the more marvellous. And if patriotic prejudice delude me\r\n  not, methinks good reason might be adduced for setting the land\r\n  journey above the sea voyage. Consider only what a height of\r\n  courage was needed to undertake and carry through so difficult an\r\n  enterprise, over a route of such desperate length and hardship,\r\n  whereon it was sometimes necessary to carry food for the supply\r\n  of man and beast, not for days only but for months together.\r\n  Columbus, on the other hand, going by sea, readily carried with\r\n  him all necessary provision; and after a voyage of some 30 or 40\r\n  days was conveyed by the wind whither he desired to go, whilst the\r\n  Venetians again took a whole year’s time to pass all those great\r\n  deserts and mighty rivers. Indeed that the difficulty of travelling\r\n  to Cathay was so much greater than that of reaching the New World,\r\n  and the route so much longer and more perilous, may be gathered\r\n  from the fact that, since those gentlemen twice made this journey,\r\n  no one from Europe has dared to repeat it,[3] whereas in the very\r\n  year following the discovery of the Western Indies many ships\r\n  immediately retraced the voyage thither, and up to the present day\r\n  continue to do so, habitually and in countless numbers. Indeed\r\n  those regions are now so well known, and so thronged by commerce,\r\n  that the traffic between Italy, Spain, and England is not greater.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recounts a tradition of the travellers’ return to Venice.]\r\n\r\n5. Ramusio goes on to explain the light regarding the first part or\r\nprologue of Marco Polo’s book that he had derived from a recent piece\r\nof luck which had made him partially acquainted with the geography\r\nof Abulfeda, and to make a running commentary on the whole of the\r\npreliminary narrative until the final return of the travellers to\r\nVenice:—\r\n\r\n  “And when they got thither the same fate befel them as befel\r\n  Ulysses, who, when he returned, after his twenty years’ wanderings,\r\n  to his native Ithaca, was recognized by nobody. Thus also those\r\n  three gentlemen who had been so many years absent from their\r\n  native city were recognized by none of their kinsfolk, who were\r\n  under the firm belief that they had all been dead for many a year\r\n  past, as indeed had been reported. Through the long duration and\r\n  the hardships of their journeys, and through the many worries and\r\n  anxieties that they had undergone, they were quite changed in\r\n  aspect, and had got a certain indescribable smack of the Tartar\r\n  both in air and accent, having indeed all but forgotten their\r\n  Venetian tongue. Their clothes too were coarse and shabby, and of\r\n  a Tartar cut. They proceeded on their arrival to their house in\r\n  this city in the confine of St. John Chrysostom, where you may\r\n  see it to this day. The house, which was in those days a very\r\n  lofty and handsome palazzo, is now known by the name of the _Corte\r\n  del Millioni_ for a reason that I will tell you presently. Going\r\n  thither they found it occupied by some of their relatives, and\r\n  they had the greatest difficulty in making the latter understand\r\n  who they should be. For these good people, seeing them to be in\r\n  countenance so unlike what they used to be, and in dress so shabby,\r\n  flatly refused to believe that they were those very gentlemen of\r\n  the Ca’ Polo whom they had been looking upon for ever so many years\r\n  as among the dead.[4] So these three gentlemen,—this is a story I\r\n  have often heard when I was a youngster from the illustrious Messer\r\n  GASPARO MALPIERO, a gentleman of very great age, and a Senator\r\n  of eminent virtue and integrity, whose house was on the Canal of\r\n  Santa Marina, exactly at the corner over the mouth of the Rio di S.\r\n  Giovanni Chrisostomo, and just midway among the buildings of the\r\n  aforesaid Corte del Millioni, and he said he had heard the story\r\n  from his own father and grandfather, and from other old men among\r\n  the neighbours,—the three gentlemen, I say, devised a scheme by\r\n  which they should at once bring about their recognition by their\r\n  relatives, and secure the honourable notice of the whole city; and\r\n  this was it:—\r\n\r\n  “They invited a number of their kindred to an entertainment, which\r\n  they took care to have prepared with great state and splendour\r\n  in that house of theirs; and when the hour arrived for sitting\r\n  down to table they came forth of their chamber all three clothed\r\n  in crimson satin, fashioned in long robes reaching to the ground\r\n  such as people in those days wore within doors. And when water\r\n  for the hands had been served, and the guests were set, they took\r\n  off those robes and put on others of crimson damask, whilst the\r\n  first suits were by their orders cut up and divided among the\r\n  servants. Then after partaking of some of the dishes they went\r\n  out again and came back in robes of crimson velvet, and when\r\n  they had again taken their seats, the second suits were divided\r\n  as before. When dinner was over they did the like with the robes\r\n  of velvet, after they had put on dresses of the ordinary fashion\r\n  worn by the rest of the company.[5] These proceedings caused much\r\n  wonder and amazement among the guests. But when the cloth had\r\n  been drawn, and all the servants had been ordered to retire from\r\n  the dining hall, Messer Marco, as the youngest of the three, rose\r\n  from table, and, going into another chamber, brought forth the\r\n  three shabby dresses of coarse stuff which they had worn when\r\n  they first arrived. Straightway they took sharp knives and began\r\n  to rip up some of the seams and welts, and to take out of them\r\n  jewels of the greatest value in vast quantities, such as rubies,\r\n  sapphires, carbuncles, diamonds and emeralds, which had all been\r\n  stitched up in those dresses in so artful a fashion that nobody\r\n  could have suspected the fact. For when they took leave of the\r\n  Great Can they had changed all the wealth that he had bestowed\r\n  upon them into this mass of rubies, emeralds, and other jewels,\r\n  being well aware of the impossibility of carrying with them so\r\n  great an amount in gold over a journey of such extreme length\r\n  and difficulty. Now this exhibition of such a huge treasure of\r\n  jewels and precious stones, all tumbled out upon the table, threw\r\n  the guests into fresh amazement, insomuch that they seemed quite\r\n  bewildered and dumbfounded. And now they recognized that in spite\r\n  of all former doubts these were in truth those honoured and worthy\r\n  gentlemen of the Ca’ Polo that they claimed to be; and so all paid\r\n  them the greatest honour and reverence. And when the story got\r\n  wind in Venice, straightway the whole city, gentle and simple,\r\n  flocked to the house to embrace them, and to make much of them,\r\n  with every conceivable demonstration of affection and respect.\r\n  On Messer Maffio, who was the eldest, they conferred the honours\r\n  of an office that was of great dignity in those days; whilst the\r\n  young men came daily to visit and converse with the ever polite and\r\n  gracious Messer Marco, and to ask him questions about Cathay and\r\n  the Great Can, all which he answered with such kindly courtesy that\r\n  every man felt himself in a manner his debtor. And as it happened\r\n  that in the story, which he was constantly called on to repeat, of\r\n  the magnificence of the Great Can, he would speak of his revenues\r\n  as amounting to ten or fifteen _millions_ of gold; and in like\r\n  manner, when recounting other instances of great wealth in those\r\n  parts, would always make use of the term _millions_, so they gave\r\n  him the nickname of MESSER MARCO MILLIONI: a thing which I have\r\n  noted also in the Public Books of this Republic where mention\r\n  is made of him.[6] The Court of his House, too, at S. Giovanni\r\n  Chrisostomo, has always from that time been popularly known as the\r\n  Court of the Millioni.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Recounts Marco’s capture by the Genoese.]\r\n\r\n  6. “Not many months after the arrival of the travellers at Venice,\r\n  news came that LAMPA DORIA, Captain of the Genoese Fleet, had\r\n  advanced with 70 galleys to the Island of Curzola, upon which\r\n  orders were issued by the Prince of the Most Illustrious Signory\r\n  for the arming of 90 galleys with all the expedition possible, and\r\n  Messer Marco Polo for his valour was put in charge of one of these.\r\n  So he with the others, under the command of the Most Illustrious\r\n  MESSER ANDREA DANDOLO, Procurator of St. Mark’s, as Captain\r\n  General, a very brave and worthy gentleman, set out in search of\r\n  the Genoese Fleet. They fought on the September feast of Our Lady,\r\n  and, as is the common hazard of war, our fleet was beaten, and Polo\r\n  was made prisoner. For, having pressed on in the vanguard of the\r\n  attack, and fighting with high and worthy courage in defence of his\r\n  country and his kindred, he did not receive due support, and being\r\n  wounded, he was taken, along with Dandolo, and immediately put in\r\n  irons and sent to Genoa.\r\n\r\n  “When his rare qualities and marvellous travels became known\r\n  there, the whole city gathered to see him and to speak with him,\r\n  and he was no longer entreated as a prisoner but as a dear friend\r\n  and honoured gentleman. Indeed they showed him such honour and\r\n  affection that at all hours of the day he was visited by the\r\n  noblest gentlemen of the city, and was continually receiving\r\n  presents of every useful kind. Messer Marco finding himself in\r\n  this position, and witnessing the general eagerness to hear all\r\n  about Cathay and the Great Can, which indeed compelled him daily to\r\n  repeat his story till he was weary, was advised to put the matter\r\n  in writing. So having found means to get a letter written to his\r\n  father here at Venice, in which he desired the latter to send the\r\n  notes and memoranda which he had brought home with him, after the\r\n  receipt of these, and assisted by a Genoese gentleman, who was a\r\n  great friend of his, and who took great delight in learning about\r\n  the various regions of the world, and used on that account to spend\r\n  many hours daily in the prison with him, he wrote this present book\r\n  (to please him) in the Latin tongue.\r\n\r\n  “To this day the Genoese for the most part write what they have to\r\n  write in that language, for there is no possibility of expressing\r\n  their natural dialect with the pen.[7] Thus then it came to pass\r\n  that the Book was put forth at first by Messer Marco in Latin; but\r\n  as many copies were taken, and as it was rendered into our vulgar\r\n  tongue, all Italy became filled with it, so much was this story\r\n  desired and run after.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ramusio’s account of Marco’s liberation and marriage.]\r\n\r\n  7. “The captivity of Messer Marco greatly disturbed the minds\r\n  of Messer Maffio and his father Messer Nicolo. They had decided,\r\n  whilst still on their travels, that Marco should marry as soon as\r\n  they should get to Venice; but now they found themselves in this\r\n  unlucky pass, with so much wealth and nobody to inherit it. Fearing\r\n  that Marco’s imprisonment might endure for many years, or, worse\r\n  still, that he might not live to quit it (for many assured them\r\n  that numbers of Venetian prisoners had been kept in Genoa a score\r\n  of years before obtaining liberty); seeing too no prospect of being\r\n  able to ransom him,—a thing which they had attempted often and\r\n  by various channels,—they took counsel together, and came to the\r\n  conclusion that Messer Nicolo, who, old as he was, was still hale\r\n  and vigorous, should take to himself a new wife. This he did; and\r\n  at the end of four years he found himself the father of three sons,\r\n  Stefano, Maffio, and Giovanni. Not many years after, Messer Marco\r\n  aforesaid, through the great favour that he had acquired in the\r\n  eyes of the first gentlemen of Genoa, and indeed of the whole city,\r\n  was discharged from prison and set free. Returning home he found\r\n  that his father had in the meantime had those three other sons.\r\n  Instead of taking this amiss, wise and discreet man that he was,\r\n  he agreed also to take a wife of his own. He did so accordingly,\r\n  but he never had any son, only two girls, one called Moreta and the\r\n  other Fantina.\r\n\r\n  “When at a later date his father died, like a good and dutiful son\r\n  he caused to be erected for him a tomb of very honourable kind for\r\n  those days, being a great sarcophagus cut from the solid stone,\r\n  which to this day may be seen under the portico before the Church\r\n  of S. Lorenzo in this city, on the right hand as you enter, with\r\n  an inscription denoting it to be the tomb of Messer Nicolo Polo of\r\n  the contrada of S. Gio. Chrisostomo. The arms of his family consist\r\n  of a _Bend_ with three birds on it, and the colours, according to\r\n  certain books of old histories in which you see all the coats of\r\n  the gentlemen of this city emblazoned, are the field _azure_, the\r\n  bend _argent_, and the three birds _sable_. These last are birds of\r\n  that kind vulgarly termed _Pole_,[8] or, as the Latins call them,\r\n  _Gracculi_.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ramusio’s account of the Family Polo and its\r\n  termination.]\r\n\r\n  8. “As regards the after duration of this noble and worthy family,\r\n  I find that Messer Andrea Polo of San Felice had three sons,\r\n  the first of whom was Messer Marco, the second Maffio, the third\r\n  Nicolo. The two last were those who went to Constantinople first,\r\n  and afterwards to Cathay, as has been seen. Messer Marco the elder\r\n  being dead, the wife of Messer Nicolo who had been left at home\r\n  with child, gave birth to a son, to whom she gave the name of Marco\r\n  in memory of the deceased, and this is the Author of our Book. Of\r\n  the brothers who were born from his father’s second marriage, viz.\r\n  Stephen, John, and Matthew, I do not find that any of them had\r\n  children, except Matthew. He had five sons and one daughter called\r\n  Maria; and she, after the death of her brothers without offspring,\r\n  inherited in 1417 all the property of her father and her brothers.\r\n  She was honourably married to Messer AZZO TREVISANO of the parish\r\n  of Santo Stazio in this city, and from her sprung the fortunate\r\n  and honoured stock of the Illustrious Messer DOMENICO TREVISANO,\r\n  Procurator of St. Mark’s, and valorous Captain General of the Sea\r\n  Forces of the Republic, whose virtue and singular good qualities\r\n  are represented with augmentation in the person of the Most\r\n  Illustrious Prince Ser MARC’ANTONIO TREVISANO, his son.[9]\r\n\r\n  “Such has been the history of this noble family of the Ca’ Polo,\r\n  which lasted as we see till the year of our Redemption 1417, in\r\n  which year died childless Marco Polo, the last of the five sons of\r\n  Maffeo, and so it came to an end.

(See below, p. _67_.)\r\n\r\n[7] This rather preposterous skit at the Genoese dialect naturally\r\n    excites a remonstrance from the Abate Spotorno.

SKETCH OF THE STATE OF THE EAST AT THE TIME OF THE\r\n                     JOURNEYS OF THE POLO FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. The story of the travels of the Polo family opens in 1260.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State of the Levant.]\r\n\r\nChristendom had recovered from the alarm into which it had been\r\nthrown some 18 years before when the Tartar cataclysm had threatened\r\nto engulph it. The Tartars themselves were already becoming an object\r\nof curiosity rather than of fear, and soon became an object of hope,\r\nas a possible help against the old Mahomedan foe. The frail Latin\r\nthrone in Constantinople was still standing, but tottering to its fall.\r\nThe successors of the Crusaders still held the Coast of Syria from\r\nAntioch to Jaffa, though a deadlier brood of enemies than they had yet\r\nencountered was now coming to maturity in the Dynasty of the Mamelukes,\r\nwhich had one foot firmly planted in Cairo, the other in Damascus.\r\nThe jealousies of the commercial republics of Italy were daily waxing\r\ngreater. The position of Genoese trade on the coasts of the Aegean was\r\ngreatly depressed, through the predominance which Venice had acquired\r\nthere by her part in the expulsion of the Greek Emperors, and which won\r\nfor the Doge the lofty style of Lord of Three-Eighths of the Empire\r\nof Romania. But Genoa was biding her time for an early revenge, and\r\nyear by year her naval strength and skill were increasing. Both these\r\nrepublics held possessions and establishments in the ports of Syria,\r\nwhich were often the scene of sanguinary conflicts between their\r\ncitizens. Alexandria was still largely frequented in the intervals of\r\nwar as the great emporium of Indian wares, but the facilities afforded\r\nby the Mongol conquerors who now held the whole tract from the Persian\r\nGulf to the shores of the Caspian and of the Black Sea, or nearly so,\r\nwere beginning to give a great advantage to the caravan routes which\r\ndebouched at the ports of Cilician Armenia in the Mediterranean and\r\nat Trebizond on the Euxine. Tana (or Azov) had not as yet become the\r\noutlet of a similar traffic; the Venetians had apparently frequented to\r\nsome extent the coast of the Crimea for local trade, but their rivals\r\nappear to have been in great measure excluded from this commerce, and\r\nthe Genoese establishments which so long flourished on that coast, are\r\nfirst heard of some years after a Greek dynasty was again in possession\r\nof Constantinople.[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The various Mongol Sovereignties in Asia and Eastern Europe.]\r\n\r\n10. In Asia and Eastern Europe scarcely a dog might bark without\r\nMongol leave, from the borders of Poland and the Gulf of Scanderoon\r\nto the Amur and the Yellow Sea. The vast empire which Chinghiz had\r\nconquered still owned a nominally supreme head in the Great Kaan,[2]\r\nbut practically it was splitting up into several great monarchies under\r\nthe descendants of the four sons of Chinghiz, Juji, Chaghatai, Okkodai,\r\nand Tuli; and wars on a vast scale were already brewing between them.\r\nHulaku, third son of Tuli, and brother of two Great Kaans, Mangku\r\nand Kúblái, had become practically independent as ruler of Persia,\r\nBabylonia, Mesopotamia, and Armenia, though he and his sons, and his\r\nsons’ sons, continued to stamp the name of the Great Kaan upon their\r\ncoins, and to use the Chinese seals of state which he bestowed upon\r\nthem. The Seljukian Sultans of Iconium, whose dominion bore the proud\r\ntitle of Rúm (Rome), were now but the struggling bondsmen of the\r\nIlkhans. The Armenian Hayton in his Cilician Kingdom had pledged a\r\nmore frank allegiance to the Tartar, the enemy of his Moslem enemies.\r\n\r\nBarka, son of Juji, the first ruling prince of the House of Chinghiz to\r\nturn Mahomedan, reigned on the steppes of the Volga, where a standing\r\ncamp, which eventually became a great city under the name of Sarai, had\r\nbeen established by his brother and predecessor Batu.\r\n\r\nThe House of Chaghatai had settled upon the pastures of the Ili and the\r\nvalley of the Jaxartes, and ruled the wealthy cities of Sogdiana.\r\n\r\nKaidu, the grandson of Okkodai who had been the successor of Chinghiz\r\nin the Kaanship, refused to acknowledge the transfer of the supreme\r\nauthority to the House of Tuli, and was through the long life of Kúblái\r\na thorn in his side, perpetually keeping his north-western frontier in\r\nalarm. His immediate authority was exercised over some part of what we\r\nshould now call Eastern Turkestan and Southern Central Siberia; whilst\r\nhis hordes of horsemen, force of character, and close neighbourhood\r\nbrought the Khans of Chaghatai under his influence, and they generally\r\nacted in concert with him.\r\n\r\nThe chief throne of the Mongol Empire had just been ascended by Kúblái,\r\nthe most able of its occupants after the Founder. Before the death of\r\nhis brother and predecessor Mangku, who died in 1259 before an obscure\r\nfortress of Western China, it had been intended to remove the seat\r\nof government from Kara Korum on the northern verge of the Mongolian\r\nDesert to the more populous regions that had been conquered in the\r\nfurther East, and this step, which in the end converted the Mongol Kaan\r\ninto a Chinese Emperor,[3] was carried out by Kúblái.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: China.]\r\n\r\n11. For about three centuries the Northern provinces of China had been\r\ndetached from native rule, and subject to foreign dynasties; first\r\nto the _Khitan_, a people from the basin of the Sungari River, and\r\nsupposed (but doubtfully) to have been akin to the Tunguses, whose rule\r\nsubsisted for 200 years, and originated the name of KHITAI, Khata, or\r\nCATHAY, by which for nearly 1000 years China has been known to the\r\nnations of Inner Asia, and to those whose acquaintance with it was\r\ngot by that channel.[4] The Khitan, whose dynasty is known in Chinese\r\nhistory as the _Liao_ or “Iron,” had been displaced in 1123 by the\r\nChúrchés or Niu-chen, another race of Eastern Tartary, of the same\r\nblood as the modern Manchus, whose Emperors in their brief period of\r\nprosperity were known by the Chinese name of Tai-_Kin_, by the Mongol\r\nname of the _Altun_ Kaans, both signifying “Golden.” Already in the\r\nlifetime of Chinghiz himself the northern Provinces of China Proper,\r\nincluding their capital, known as Chung-tu or Yen-King, now Peking, had\r\nbeen wrenched from them, and the conquest of the dynasty was completed\r\nby Chinghiz’s successor Okkodai in 1234.\r\n\r\nSouthern China still remained in the hands of the native dynasty of\r\nthe Sung, who had their capital at the great city now well known as\r\nHang-chau fu. Their dominion was still substantially untouched, but its\r\nsubjugation was a task to which Kúblái before many years turned his\r\nattention, and which became the most prominent event of his reign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: India, and Indo-China.]\r\n\r\n12. In India the most powerful sovereign was the Sultan of Delhi,\r\nNassir-uddin Mahmud of the Turki House of Iltitmish;[5] but, though both\r\nSind and Bengal acknowledged his supremacy, no part of Peninsular India\r\nhad yet been invaded, and throughout the long period of our Traveller’s\r\nresidence in the East the Kings of Delhi had their hands too full,\r\nowing to the incessant incursions of the Mongols across the Indus, to\r\nventure on extensive campaigning in the south. Hence the Dravidian\r\nKingdoms of Southern India were as yet untouched by foreign conquest,\r\nand the accumulated gold of ages lay in their temples and treasuries,\r\nan easy prey for the coming invader.\r\n\r\nIn the Indo-Chinese Peninsula and the Eastern Islands a variety of\r\nkingdoms and dynasties were expanding and contracting, of which we\r\nhave at best but dim and shifting glimpses. That they were advanced\r\nin wealth and art, far beyond what the present state of those\r\nregions would suggest, is attested by vast and magnificent remains of\r\nArchitecture, nearly all dating, so far as dates can be ascertained,\r\nfrom the 12th to the 14th centuries (that epoch during which an\r\narchitectural afflatus seems to have descended on the human race),\r\nand which are found at intervals over both the Indo-Chinese continent\r\nand the Islands, as at Pagán in Burma, at Ayuthia in Siam, at Angkor\r\nin Kamboja, at Borobodor and Brambánan in Java. All these remains are\r\ndeeply marked by Hindu influence, and, at the same time, by strong\r\npeculiarities, both generic and individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Hayton, King of Armenia, _circa_ A.D. 1243.\r\n\r\n  “... =e por so qui cestes lettres soient fermes e establis ci avuns\r\n  escrit l’escrit de notre main vermoil e sayelé de notre ceau\r\n  pendant=....”]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] See Heyd, _Le Colonie Commerciali degli Italiani_, etc., passim.\r\n\r\n[2] We endeavour to preserve throughout the book the distinction\r\n    that was made in the age of the Mongol Empire between _Khán_ and\r\n    _Ḳaán_ (خان and قآان, as written by Arabic and Persian authors).\r\n    The former may be rendered _Lord_, and was applied generally to\r\n    Tartar chiefs whether sovereign or not; it has since become in\r\n    Persia, and especially in Afghanistan, a sort of “Esq.,” and in\r\n    India is now a common affix in the names of (Musulman) Hindustanis\r\n    of all classes; in Turkey alone it has been reserved for the\r\n    Sultan. _Ḳaán_, again, appears to be a form of _Kháḳán_, the\r\n    Χαγάνος of the Byzantine historians, and was the peculiar title\r\n    of the supreme sovereign of the Mongols; the Mongol princes of\r\n    Persia, Chaghatai, etc., were entitled only to the former affix\r\n    (Khán), though _Ḳaán_ and _Ḳhaḳán_ are sometimes applied to them\r\n    in adulation. Polo always writes _Kaan_ as applied to the Great\r\n    Khan, and does not, I think, use _Khan_ in any form, styling the\r\n    subordinate princes by their name only, as _Argon_, _Alau_, etc.\r\n    _Ilkhan_ was a special title assumed by Huláku and his successors\r\n    in Persia; it is said to be compounded from a word _Il_, signifying\r\n    tribe or nation. The relation between _Khán_ and _Khaḳán_ seems to\r\n    be probably that the latter signifies “_Khán of Kháns_,” Lord of\r\n    Lords. Chinghiz, it is said, did not take the higher title; it was\r\n    first assumed by his son Okkodai. But there are doubts about this.\r\n    (See _Quatremère’s Rashid_, pp. 10 _seqq._ and _Pavet de\r\n    Courteille, Dict. Turk-Oriental._) The tendency of swelling titles\r\n    is always to degenerate, and when the value of Khan had sunk, a new\r\n    form, _Khán-khánán_, was devised at the Court of Delhi, and applied\r\n    to one of the high officers of state.\r\n\r\n    [Mr. Rockhill writes (_Rubruck_, p. 108, note): “The title _Khan_,\r\n    though of very great antiquity, was only used by the Turks after\r\n    A.D. 560, at which time the use of the word _Khatun_ came in use\r\n    for the wives of the Khan, who himself was termed _Ilkhan_. The\r\n    older title of _Shan-yü_ did not, however, completely disappear\r\n    among them, for Albiruni says that in his time the chief of the\r\n    Ghuz Turks, or Turkomans, still bore the title of _Jenuyeh_, which\r\n    Sir Henry Rawlinson (_Proc. R. G. S._, v. 15) takes to be the same\r\n    word as that transcribed _Shan-yü_ by the Chinese (see _Ch’ien\r\n    Han shu_, Bk. 94, and _Chou shu_, Bk. 50, 2). Although the word\r\n    _Khakhan_ occurs in Menander’s account of the embassy of Zemarchus,\r\n    the earliest mention I have found of it in a Western writer is in\r\n    the _Chronicon_ of Albericus Trium Fontium, where (571), under\r\n    the year 1239, he uses it in the form _Cacanus_”—Cf. _Terrien de\r\n    Lacouperie, Khan, Khakan, and other Tartar Titles_. Lond., Dec.\r\n    1888.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[3] “China is a sea that salts all the rivers that flow into it.”—_P.\r\n    Parrenin_ in _Lett. Édif._ XXIV. 58.\r\n\r\n[4] _E.g._ the Russians still call it Khitai. The pair of names,\r\n    _Khitai_ and _Machin_, or Cathay and China, is analogous to the\r\n    other pair, _Seres_ and _Sinae_. _Seres_ was the name of the great\r\n    nation in the far East as known by land, _Sinae_ as known by sea;\r\n    and they were often supposed to be diverse, just as Cathay and\r\n    China were afterwards.\r\n\r\n[5] There has been much doubt about the true form of this name.\r\n    _Iltitmish_ is that sanctioned by Mr. Blochmann (see _Proc. As.\r\n    Soc. Bengal_, 1870, p. 181).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       III. THE POLO FAMILY. PERSONAL HISTORY OF THE TRAVELLERS\r\n               DOWN TO THEIR FINAL RETURN FROM THE EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alleged origin of the Polos.]\r\n\r\n13. In days when History and Genealogy were allowed to draw largely\r\non the imagination for the _origines_ of states and families, it\r\nwas set down by one Venetian Antiquary that among the companions of\r\nKing Venetus, or of Prince Antenor of Troy, when they settled on the\r\nnorthern shores of the Adriatic, there was one LUCIUS POLUS, who became\r\nthe progenitor of our Traveller’s Family;[1] whilst another deduces it\r\nfrom PAOLO the first Doge[2] (Paulus Lucas Anafestus of Heraclea, A.D.\r\n696).\r\n\r\nMore trustworthy traditions, recorded among the Family Histories of\r\nVenice, but still no more it is believed than traditions, represent the\r\nFamily of Polo as having come from Sebenico in Dalmatia, in the 11th\r\ncentury.[3] Before the end of the century they had taken seats in the\r\nGreat Council of the Republic; for the name of Domenico Polo is said to\r\nbe subscribed to a grant of 1094, that of Pietro Polo to an act of the\r\ntime of the Doge Domenico Michiele in 1122, and that of a Domenico Polo\r\nto an acquittance granted by the Doge Domenico Morosini and his Council\r\nin 1153.[4]\r\n\r\nThe ascertained genealogy of the Traveller, however, begins only with\r\nhis grandfather, who lived in the early part of the 13th century.\r\n\r\nTwo branches of the Polo Family were then recognized, distinguished by\r\nthe _confini_ or Parishes in which they lived, as Polo of S. Geremia,\r\nand Polo of S. Felice. ANDREA POLO of S. Felice was the father of three\r\nsons, MARCO, NICOLO, and MAFFEO. And Nicolo was the Father of our Marco.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claims to be styled noble.]\r\n\r\n14. Till quite recently it had never been precisely ascertained whether\r\nthe immediate family of our Traveller belonged to the _Nobles_ of\r\nVenice properly so called, who had seats in the Great Council and were\r\nenrolled in the Libro d’Oro. Ramusio indeed styles our Marco _Nobile_\r\nand _Magnifico_, and Rusticiano, the actual scribe of the Traveller’s\r\nrecollections, calls him “_sajes et noble citaiens de Venece_,”\r\nbut Ramusio’s accuracy and Rusticiano’s precision were scarcely to\r\nbe depended on. Very recently, however, since the subject has been\r\ndiscussed with accomplished students of the Venice Archives, proofs\r\nhave been found establishing Marco’s personal claim to nobility,\r\ninasmuch as both in judicial decisions and in official resolutions of\r\nthe Great Council, he is designated _Nobilis Vir_, a formula which\r\nwould never have been used in such documents (I am assured) had he not\r\nbeen technically noble.[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marco the Elder.]\r\n\r\n15. Of the three sons of Andrea Polo of S. Felice, Marco seems to have\r\nbeen the eldest, and Maffeo the youngest.[6] They were all engaged\r\nin commerce, and apparently in a partnership, which to some extent\r\nheld good even when the two younger had been many years absent in\r\nthe Far East.[7] Marco seems to have been established for a time at\r\nConstantinople,[8] and also to have had a house (no doubt of business)\r\nat Soldaia, in the Crimea, where his son and daughter, Nicolo and\r\nMaroca by name, were living in 1280. This year is the date of the Elder\r\nMarco’s Will, executed at Venice, and when he was “weighed down by\r\nbodily ailment.” Whether he survived for any length of time we do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicolo and Maffeo commence their travels.]\r\n\r\n16. Nicolo Polo, the second of the Brothers, had two legitimate sons,\r\nMARCO, the Author of our Book, born in 1254,[9] and MAFFEO, of whose\r\nplace in the family we shall have a few words to say presently. The\r\nstory opens, as we have said, in 1260, when we find the two brothers,\r\nNicolo and Maffeo the Elder, at Constantinople. How long they had been\r\nabsent from Venice we are not distinctly told. Nicolo had left his wife\r\nthere behind him; Maffeo apparently was a bachelor. In the year named\r\nthey started on a trading venture to the Crimea, whence a succession\r\nof openings and chances, recounted in the Introductory chapters of\r\nMarco’s work, carried them far north along the Volga, and thence first\r\nto Bokhara, and then to the Court of the Great Kaan Kúblái in the Far\r\nEast, on or within the borders of CATHAY. That a great and civilized\r\ncountry so called existed in the extremity of Asia had already been\r\nreported in Europe by the Friars Plano Carpini (1246) and William\r\nRubruquis (1253), who had not indeed reached its frontiers, but had\r\nmet with its people at the Court of the Great Kaan in Mongolia; whilst\r\nthe latter of the two with characteristic acumen had seen that they\r\nwere identical with the Seres of classic fame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their intercourse with Kúblái Kaan.]\r\n\r\n17. Kúblái had never before fallen in with European gentlemen. He was\r\ndelighted with these Venetians, listened with strong interest to all\r\nthat they had to tell him of the Latin world, and determined to send\r\nthem back as his ambassadors to the Pope, accompanied by an officer\r\nof his own Court. His letters to the Pope, as the Polos represent\r\nthem, were mainly to desire the despatch of a large body of educated\r\nmissionaries to convert his people to Christianity. It is not likely\r\nthat religious motives influenced Kúblái in this, but he probably\r\ndesired religious aid in softening and civilizing his rude kinsmen of\r\nthe Steppes, and judged, from what he saw in the Venetians and heard\r\nfrom them, that Europe could afford such aid of a higher quality than\r\nthe degenerate Oriental Christians with whom he was familiar, or the\r\nTibetan Lamas on whom his patronage eventually devolved when Rome so\r\ndeplorably failed to meet his advances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their return home, and Marco’s appearance on the scene.]\r\n\r\n18. The Brothers arrived at Acre in April,[10] 1269, and found that\r\nno Pope existed, for Clement IV. was dead the year before, and no new\r\nelection had taken place. So they went home to Venice to see how things\r\nstood there after their absence of so many years.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Nicolo was no longer among the living, but he found his son\r\nMarco a fine lad of fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe best and most authentic MSS. tell us no more than this. But\r\none class of copies, consisting of the Latin version made by our\r\nTraveller’s contemporary, Francesco Pipino, and of the numerous\r\neditions based indirectly upon it, represents that Nicolo had left\r\nVenice when Marco was as yet unborn, and consequently had never seen\r\nhim till his return from the East in 1269.[11]\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that Nicolo Polo had another legitimate son, by name\r\nMaffeo, and him we infer to have been younger than Marco, because he\r\nis named last (_Marcus et Matheus_) in the Testament of their uncle\r\nMarco the Elder. We do not know if they were by the same mother. They\r\ncould not have been so if we are right in supposing Maffeo to have been\r\nthe younger, and if Pipino’s version of the history be genuine. If\r\nhowever we reject the latter, as I incline to do, no ground remains for\r\nsupposing that Nicolo went to the East much before we find him there\r\nviz., in 1260, and Maffeo may have been born of the same mother during\r\nthe interval between 1254 and 1260. If on the other hand Pipino’s\r\nversion be held to, we must suppose that Maffeo (who is named by his\r\nuncle in 1280, during his father’s second absence in the East) was born\r\nof a marriage contracted during Nicolo’s residence at home after his\r\nfirst journey, a residence which lasted from 1269 to 1271.[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Piazzetta at Venice. (From the Bodleian MS. of\r\n  Polo.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Journey of the Polo Brothers, accompanied by Marco.]\r\n\r\n19. The Papal interregnum was the longest known, at least since the\r\ndark ages. Those two years passed, and yet the Cardinals at Viterbo\r\nhad come to no agreement. The brothers were unwilling to let the Great\r\nKaan think them faithless, and perhaps they hankered after the virgin\r\nfield of speculation that they had discovered; so they started again\r\nfor the East, taking young Mark with them. At Acre they took counsel\r\nwith an eminent churchman, TEDALDO (or Tebaldo) VISCONTI, Archdeacon\r\nof Liège, whom the Book represents to have been Legate in Syria, and\r\nwho in any case was a personage of much gravity and influence. From him\r\nthey got letters to authenticate the causes of the miscarriage of their\r\nmission, and started for the further East. But they were still at the\r\nport of Ayas on the Gulf of Scanderoon, which was then becoming one of\r\nthe chief points of arrival and departure for the inland trade of Asia,\r\nwhen they were overtaken by the news that a Pope was at last elected,\r\nand that the choice had fallen upon their friend Archdeacon Tedaldo.\r\nThey immediately returned to Acre, and at last were able to execute the\r\nKaan’s commission, and to obtain a reply. But instead of the hundred\r\nable teachers of science and religion whom Kúblái is said to have asked\r\nfor, the new Pope, Gregory X., could supply but two Dominicans; and\r\nthese lost heart and drew back when they had barely taken the first\r\nstep of the journey.\r\n\r\nJudging from certain indications we conceive it probable that the three\r\nVenetians, whose second start from Acre took place about November\r\n1271, proceeded by Ayas and Sivas, and then by Mardin, Mosul, and\r\nBaghdad, to Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, with the view of\r\ngoing on by sea, but that some obstacle arose which compelled them to\r\nabandon this project and turn north again from Hormuz.[13] They then\r\ntraversed successively Kerman and Khorasan, Balkh and Badakhshan,\r\nwhence they ascended the Panja or upper Oxus to the Plateau of Pamir, a\r\nroute not known to have been since followed by any European traveller\r\nexcept Benedict Goës, till the spirited expedition of Lieutenant John\r\nWood of the Indian Navy in 1838.[14] Crossing the Pamir highlands the\r\ntravellers descended upon Kashgar, whence they proceeded by Yarkand and\r\nKhotan, and the vicinity of Lake Lob, and eventually across the Great\r\nGobi Desert to Tangut, the name then applied by Mongols and Persians\r\nto territory at the extreme North-west of China, both within and\r\nwithout the Wall. Skirting the northern frontier of China they at last\r\nreached the presence of the Kaan, who was at his usual summer retreat\r\nat Kai-ping fu, near the base of the Khingan Mountains, and nearly 100\r\nmiles north of the Great Wall at Kalgan. If there be no mistake in\r\nthe time (three years and a half) ascribed to this journey in all the\r\nexisting texts, the travellers did not reach the Court till about May\r\nof 1275.[15]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marco’s employment by Kúblái Kaan; and his journeys.]\r\n\r\n20. Kúblái received the Venetians with great cordiality, and took\r\nkindly to young Mark, who must have been by this time one-and-twenty.\r\nThe _Joenne Bacheler_, as the story calls him, applied himself to\r\nthe acquisition of the languages and written characters in chief use\r\namong the multifarious nationalities included in the Kaan’s Court\r\nand administration; and Kúblái after a time, seeing his discretion\r\nand ability, began to employ him in the public service. M. Pauthier\r\nhas found a record in the Chinese Annals of the Mongol Dynasty,\r\nwhich states that in the year 1277, a certain POLO was nominated a\r\nsecond-class commissioner or agent attached to the Privy Council,\r\na passage which we are happy to believe to refer to our young\r\ntraveller.[16]\r\n\r\nHis first mission apparently was that which carried him through the\r\nprovinces of Shan-si, Shen-si, and Sze-ch’wan, and the wild country on\r\nthe East of Tibet, to the remote province of Yun-nan, called by the\r\nMongols Karájàng, and which had been partially conquered by an army\r\nunder Kúblái himself in 1253, before his accession to the throne.[17]\r\nMark, during his stay at court, had observed the Kaan’s delight in\r\nhearing of strange countries, their marvels, manners, and oddities,\r\nand had heard his Majesty’s frank expressions of disgust at the\r\nstupidity of his commissioners when they could speak of nothing but\r\nthe official business on which they had been sent. Profiting by these\r\nobservations, he took care to store his memory or his note-books with\r\nall curious facts that were likely to interest Kúblái, and related them\r\nwith vivacity on his return to Court. This first journey, which led\r\nhim through a region which is still very nearly a _terra incognita_,\r\nand in which there existed and still exists, among the deep valleys of\r\nthe Great Rivers flowing down from Eastern Tibet, and in the rugged\r\nmountain ranges bordering Yun-nan and Kwei-chau, a vast Ethnological\r\nGarden, as it were, of tribes of various race and in every stage of\r\nuncivilisation, afforded him an acquaintance with many strange products\r\nand eccentric traits of manners, wherewith to delight the Emperor.\r\n\r\nMark rose rapidly in favour, and often served Kúblái again on distant\r\nmissions, as well as in domestic administration, but we gather few\r\ndetails as to his employments. At one time we know that he held for\r\nthree years the government of the great city of Yang-chau, though we\r\nneed not try to magnify this office, as some commentators have done,\r\ninto the viceroyalty of one of the great provinces of the Empire; on\r\nanother occasion we find him with his uncle Maffeo, passing a year at\r\nKan-chau in Tangut; again, it would appear, visiting Kara Korum, the\r\nold capital of the Kaans in Mongolia; on another occasion in Champa\r\nor Southern Cochin China; and again, or perhaps as a part of the last\r\nexpedition, on a mission to the Indian Seas, when he appears to have\r\nvisited several of the southern states of India. We are not informed\r\nwhether his father and uncle shared in such employments;[18] and the\r\nstory of their services rendered to the Kaan in promoting the capture\r\nof the city of Siang-yang, by the construction of powerful engines of\r\nattack, is too much perplexed by difficulties of chronology to be cited\r\nwith confidence. Anyhow they were gathering wealth, and after years of\r\nexile they began to dread what might follow old Kúblái’s death, and\r\nlonged to carry their gear and their own grey heads safe home to the\r\nLagoons. The aged Emperor growled refusal to all their hints, and but\r\nfor a happy chance we should have lost our mediæval Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circumstances of the Departure of the Polos from the Kaan’s\r\nCourt.]\r\n\r\n21. Arghún Khan of Persia, Kúblái’s great-nephew, had in 1286 lost his\r\nfavourite wife the Khatun Bulughán; and, mourning her sorely, took\r\nsteps to fulfil her dying injunction that her place should be filled\r\nonly by a lady of her own kin, the Mongol Tribe of Bayaut. Ambassadors\r\nwere despatched to the Court of Kaan-baligh to seek such a bride. The\r\nmessage was courteously received, and the choice fell on the lady\r\nKokáchin, a maiden of 17, “_moult bele dame et avenant_.” The overland\r\nroad from Peking to Tabriz was not only of portentous length for such\r\na tender charge, but was imperilled by war, so the envoys desired to\r\nreturn by sea. Tartars in general were strangers to all navigation; and\r\nthe envoys, much taken with the Venetians, and eager to profit by their\r\nexperience, especially as Marco had just then returned from his Indian\r\nmission, begged the Kaan as a favour to send the three _Firinghis_\r\nin their company. He consented with reluctance, but, having done so,\r\nfitted the party out nobly for the voyage, charging the Polos with\r\nfriendly messages for the potentates of Europe, including the King of\r\nEngland. They appear to have sailed from the port of Zayton (as the\r\nWesterns called T’swan-chau or Chin-cheu in Fo-kien) in the beginning\r\nof 1292. It was an ill-starred voyage, involving long detentions on\r\nthe coast of Sumatra, and in the South of India, to which, however,\r\nwe are indebted for some of the best chapters in the book; and two\r\nyears or upwards passed before they arrived at their destination in\r\nPersia.[19] The three hardy Venetians survived all perils, and so did\r\nthe lady, who had come to look on them with filial regard; but two of\r\nthe three envoys, and a vast proportion of the suite, had perished by\r\nthe way.[20] Arghún Khan too had been dead even before they quitted\r\nChina;[21] his brother Kaikhátú reigned in his stead; and his son\r\nGházán succeeded to the lady’s hand. We are told by one who knew both\r\nthe princes well that Arghún was one of the handsomest men of his time,\r\nwhilst Gházán was, among all his host, one of the most insignificant in\r\nappearance. But in other respects the lady’s change was for the better.\r\nGházán had some of the highest qualities of a soldier, a legislator and\r\na king, adorned by many and varied accomplishments; though his reign\r\nwas too short for the full development of his fame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They pass by Persia to Venice. Their relations there.]\r\n\r\n22. The princess, whose enjoyment of her royalty was brief, wept as she\r\ntook leave of the kindly and noble Venetians. They went on to Tabriz,\r\nand after a long halt there proceeded homewards, reaching Venice,\r\naccording to all the texts some time in 1295.[22]\r\n\r\nWe have related Ramusio’s interesting tradition, like a bit out of the\r\nArabian Nights, of the reception that the Travellers met with from\r\ntheir relations, and of the means that they took to establish their\r\nposition with those relations, and with Venetian society.[23] Of the\r\nrelations, Marco the Elder had probably been long dead;[24] Maffeo\r\nthe brother of our Marco was alive, and we hear also of a cousin\r\n(_consanguineus_) Felice Polo, and his wife Fiordelisa, without being\r\nable to fix their precise position in the family. We know also that\r\nNicolo, who died before the end of the century, left behind him two\r\nillegitimate sons, Stefano and Zannino. It is not unlikely that these\r\nwere born from some connection entered into during the long residence\r\nof the Polos in Cathay, though naturally their presence in the\r\ntravelling company is not commemorated in Marco’s Prologue.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] _Zurla_, I. 42, quoting a MS. entitled _Petrus Ciera S. R. E. Card,\r\n    de Origine Venetorum et de Civitate Venetiarum_. Cicogna says he\r\n    could not find this MS. as it had been carried to England; and then\r\n    breaks into a diatribe against foreigners who purchase and carry\r\n    away such treasures, “not to make a serious study of them, but\r\n    for mere vain-glory ... or in order to write books contradicting\r\n    the very MSS. that they have bought, and with that dishonesty and\r\n    untruth which are so notorious!” (IV. 227.)\r\n\r\n[2] _Campidoglio Veneto_ of Cappellari (MS. in St. Mark’s Lib.),\r\n    quoting “the Venetian Annals of Giulio Faroldi.”\r\n\r\n[3] The _Genealogies_ of Marco Barbaro specify 1033 as the year of the\r\n    migration to Venice; on what authority does not appear (MS. copy in\r\n    _Museo Civico_ at Venice).\r\n\r\n[4] _Cappellari_, u.s., and _Barbaro_. In the same century we find\r\n    (1125, 1195) indications of Polos at Torcello, and of others (1160)\r\n    at Equileo, and (1179, 1206) Lido Maggiore; in 1154 a Marco Polo of\r\n    Rialto. Contemporary with these is a family of Polos (1139, 1183,\r\n    1193, 1201) at Chioggia (_Documents and Lists of Documents from\r\n    various Archives at_ Venice).\r\n\r\n[5] See Appendix C, Nos. 4, 5, and 16. It was supposed that an\r\n    autograph of Marco as member of the Great Council had been\r\n    discovered, but this proves to be a mistake, as will be explained\r\n    further on (see p. _74_, note). In those days the demarcation\r\n    between Patrician and non-Patrician at Venice, where all classes\r\n    shared in commerce, all were (generally speaking) of one race, and\r\n    where there were neither castles, domains, nor trains of horsemen,\r\n    formed no wide gulf. Still it is interesting to establish the\r\n    verity of the old tradition of Marco’s technical nobility.\r\n\r\n[6] Marco’s seniority rests only on the assertion of Ramusio, who also\r\n    calls Maffeo older than Nicolo. But in Marco the Elder’s Will these\r\n    two are always (3 times) specified as “_Nicolaus et Matheus_.”\r\n\r\n[7] This seems implied in the Elder Marco’s Will (1280): “_Item\r\n    de bonis quæ me habere contingunt_ de fraternâ Compagniâ _a\r\n    suprascriptis Nicolao et Matheo Paulo_,” etc.\r\n\r\n[8] In his Will he terms himself “Ego Marcus Polo quondam de\r\n    Constantinopoli.”\r\n\r\n[9] There is no real ground for doubt as to this. All the extant MSS.\r\n    agree in making Marco fifteen years old when his father returned to\r\n    Venice in 1269.\r\n\r\n[10] Baldelli and Lazari say that the Bern MS. specifies 30th April;\r\n    but this is a mistake.\r\n\r\n[11] Pipino’s version runs: “Invenit Dominus Nicolaus Paulus uxorem\r\n    suam esse defunctam, quae in recessu suo fuit praegnans.\r\n    Invenitque filium, Marcum nomine, qui jam annos xv. habebat\r\n    aetatis, qui post discessum ipsius de Venetiis natus fuerat de\r\n    uxore sua praefatâ.” To this Ramusio adds the further particular\r\n    that the mother died in giving birth to Mark.\r\n\r\n    The interpolation is older even than Pipino’s version, for we find\r\n    in the rude Latin published by the Société de Géographie “quam cum\r\n    Venetiis primo recessit praegnantem dimiserat.” But the statement\r\n    is certainly an _interpolation_, for it does not exist in any of\r\n    the older texts; nor have we any good reason for believing that\r\n    it was an _authorised_ interpolation. I suspect it to have been\r\n    introduced to harmonise with an erroneous date for the commencement\r\n    of the travels of the two brothers.\r\n\r\n    Lazari prints: “Messer Nicolò trovò che la sua donna era morta, e\r\n    n’era rimasto un fanciullo di _dodici_ anni per nome Marco, _che\r\n    il padre non avea veduto mai, perchè non era ancor nato quando\r\n    egli partì_.” These words have no equivalent in the French Texts,\r\n    but are taken from one of the Italian MSS. in the Magliabecchian\r\n    Library, and are I suspect also interpolated. The _dodici_ is pure\r\n    error (see p. 21 _infra_).\r\n\r\n[12] The last view is in substance, I find, suggested by Cicogna (ii.\r\n    389).\r\n\r\n    The matter is of some interest, because in the Will of the\r\n    younger Maffeo, which is extant, he makes a bequest to his uncle\r\n    (_Avunculus_) Jordan Trevisan. This seems an indication that\r\n    his mother’s name may have been Trevisan. The same Maffeo had a\r\n    daughter _Fiordelisa_. And Marco the Elder, in his Will (1280),\r\n    appoints as his executors, during the absence of his brothers,\r\n    the same Jordan Trevisan and his own sister-in-law _Fiordelisa_\r\n    (“Jordanum Trivisanum de confinio S. Antonini: et Flordelisam\r\n    cognatam meam”). Hence I conjecture that this _cognata Fiordelisa_\r\n    (Trevisan?) was the wife of the absent Nicolo, and the mother of\r\n    Maffeo. In that case of course Maffeo and Marco were the sons\r\n    of different mothers. With reference to the above suggestion of\r\n    Nicolo’s second marriage in 1269 there is a curious variation in\r\n    a fragmentary Venetian Polo in the Barberini Library at Rome.\r\n    It runs, in the passage corresponding to the latter part of ch.\r\n    ix. of Prologue: “i qual do fratelli steteno do anni in Veniezia\r\n    aspettando la elletion de nuovo Papa, _nel qual tempo Mess. Nicolo\r\n    si tolse moier et si la lasò graveda._” I believe, however, that it\r\n    is only a careless misrendering of Pipino’s statement about Marco’s\r\n    birth.\r\n\r\n[13] [Major Sykes, in his remarkable book on _Persia_, ch. xxiii. pp.\r\n    262–263, does not share Sir Henry Yule’s opinion regarding this\r\n    itinerary, and he writes:\r\n\r\n    “To return to our travellers, who started on their second great\r\n    journey in 1271, Sir Henry Yule, in his introduction,[A] makes\r\n    them travel _viâ_ Sivas to Mosul and Baghdád, and thence by sea\r\n    to Hormuz, and this is the itinerary shown on his sketch map.\r\n    This view I am unwilling to accept for more than one reason. In\r\n    the first place, if, with Colonel Yule, we suppose that Ser Marco\r\n    visited Baghdád, is it not unlikely that he should term the River\r\n    Volga the Tigris,[B] and yet leave the river of Baghdád nameless?\r\n    It may be urged that Marco believed the legend of the reappearance\r\n    of the Volga in Kurdistán, but yet, if the text be read with care\r\n    and the character of the traveller be taken into account, this\r\n    error is scarcely explicable in any other way, than that he was\r\n    never there.\r\n\r\n    “Again, he gives no description of the striking buildings of\r\n    Baudas, as he terms it, but this is nothing to the inaccuracy of\r\n    his supposed onward journey. To quote the text, ‘A very great river\r\n    flows through the city, ... and merchants descend some eighteen days\r\n    from Baudas, and then come to a certain city called Kisi,[C] where\r\n    they enter the Sea of India.’ Surely Marco, had he travelled down\r\n    the Persian Gulf, would never have given this description of the\r\n    route, which is so untrue as to point to the conclusion that it was\r\n    vague information given by some merchant whom he met in the course\r\n    of his wanderings.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, apart from the fact that Baghdád, since its fall, was\r\n    rather off the main caravan route, Marco so evidently travels east\r\n    from Yezd and thence south to Hormuz, that unless his journey\r\n    be described backwards, which is highly improbable, it is only\r\n    possible to arrive at one conclusion, namely, that the Venetians\r\n    entered Persia near Tabriz, and travelled to Sultania, Kashán, and\r\n    Yezd. Thence they proceeded to Kermán and Hormuz, where, probably\r\n    fearing the sea voyage, owing to the manifest unseaworthiness of\r\n    the ships, which he describes as ‘wretched affairs,’ the Khorasán\r\n    route was finally adopted. Hormuz, in this case, was not visited\r\n    again until the return from China, when it seems probable that\r\n    the same route was retraced to Tabriz, where their charge, the\r\n    Lady Kokachin, ‘moult bele dame et avenant,’ was married to Gházan\r\n    Khán, the son of her fiancé Arghun. It remains to add that Sir\r\n    Henry Yule may have finally accepted this view in part, as in the\r\n    plate showing _Probable View of Marco Polo’s own Geography_,[D] the\r\n    itinerary is not shown as running to Baghdád.”\r\n\r\n    I may be allowed to answer that when Marco Polo _started_ for the\r\n    East, Baghdád was not rather off the main caravan route. The fall\r\n    of Baghdád was not immediately followed by its decay, and we have\r\n    proof of its prosperity at the beginning of the 14th century.\r\n    Tauris had not yet the importance it had reached when the Polos\r\n    visited it on their _return_ journey. We have the will of the\r\n    Venetian Pietro Viglioni, dated from Tauris, 10th December, 1264\r\n    (_Archiv. Veneto_, xxvi. 161–165), which shows that he was but\r\n    a pioneer. It was only under Arghún Khan (1284–1291) that Tauris\r\n    became the great market for foreign, especially Genoese, merchants,\r\n    as Marco Polo remarks on his return journey; with Gházán and the\r\n    new city built by that prince, Tauris reached a very high degree\r\n    of prosperity, and was then really the chief emporium on the route\r\n    from Europe to Persia and the far East. Sir Henry Yule had not\r\n    changed his views, and if in the plate showing _Probable View of\r\n    Marco Polo’s own Geography_, the itinerary is not shown as running\r\n    to Baghdád, it is mere neglect on the part of the\r\n    draughtsman.—H.

It is noticeable that John of Pian\r\n        de Carpine, who travelled 1245 to 1247, names it correctly.\r\n\r\n    [C] The modern name is Keis, an island lying off Linga.\r\n\r\n    [D] Vol. i. p. 110 (Introduction).\r\n\r\n[14] It is stated by Neumann that this most estimable traveller once\r\n    intended to have devoted a special work to the elucidation of\r\n    Marco’s chapters on the Oxus Provinces, and it is much to be\r\n    regretted that this intention was never fulfilled. Pamir has been\r\n    explored more extensively and deliberately, whilst this book was\r\n    going through the press, by Colonel Gordon, and other officers,\r\n    detached from Sir Douglas Forsyth’s Mission. [We have made use\r\n    of the information given by these officers and by more recent\r\n    travellers.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[15] Half a year earlier, if we suppose the three years and a half to\r\n    count from Venice rather than Acre. But at that season (November)\r\n    Kúblái would not have been at Kai-ping fu (otherwise Shang-tu).\r\n\r\n[16] _Pauthier_, p. ix., and p. 361.\r\n\r\n[17] That this was Marco’s first mission is positively stated in the\r\n    Ramusian edition; and though this may be only an editor’s gloss\r\n    it seems well-founded. The French texts say only that the Great\r\n    Kaan, “l’envoia en un message en une terre ou bien avoit vj. mois\r\n    de chemin.” The traveller’s actual Itinerary affords to Vochan\r\n    (Yung-ch’ang), on the frontier of Burma, 147 days’ journey, which\r\n    with halts might well be reckoned six months in round estimate.\r\n    And we are enabled by various circumstances to fix the date of\r\n    the Yun-nan journey between 1277 and 1280. The former limit is\r\n    determined by Polo’s account of the battle with the Burmese, near\r\n    Vochan, which took place according to the Chinese Annals in 1277.\r\n    The latter is fixed by his mention of Kúblái’s son, Mangalai, as\r\n    governing at Kenjanfu (Si-ngan fu), a prince who died in 1280. (See\r\n    vol. ii. pp. 24, 31, also 64, 80.)\r\n\r\n[18] Excepting in the doubtful case of Kan-chau, where one reading\r\n    says that the three Polos were there on business of their own not\r\n    necessary to mention, and another, that only Maffeo and Marco were\r\n    there, “_en légation_.”\r\n\r\n[19] Persian history seems to fix the arrival of the lady Kokáchin\r\n    in the North of Persia to the winter of 1293–1294. The voyage to\r\n    Sumatra occupied three months (vol. i. p. 34); they were five\r\n    months detained there (ii. 292); and the remainder of the voyage\r\n    extended to eighteen more (i. 35),—twenty-six months in all.\r\n\r\n    The data are too slight for unexceptional precision, but the\r\n    following adjustment will fairly meet the facts. Say that they\r\n    sailed from Fo-kien in January 1292. In April they would be in\r\n    Sumatra, and find the S.W. Monsoon too near to admit of their\r\n    crossing the Bay of Bengal. They remain in port till September\r\n    (five months), and then proceed, touching (perhaps) at Ceylon, at\r\n    Kayal, and at several ports of Western India. In one of these,\r\n    _e.g._ Kayal or Tana, they pass the S.W. Monsoon of 1293, and then\r\n    proceed to the Gulf. They reach Hormuz in the winter, and the camp\r\n    of the Persian Prince Gházán, the son of Arghún, in March,\r\n    twenty-six months from their departure.\r\n\r\n    I have been unable to trace Hammer’s authority (not Wassáf I find),\r\n    which perhaps gives the precise date of the Lady’s arrival in\r\n    Persia (see _infra_, p. 38). From his narrative, however (_Gesch.\r\n    der Ilchane_, ii. 20), March 1294 is perhaps too late a date.\r\n    But the five months’ stoppage in Sumatra _must_ have been in the\r\n    S.W. Monsoon; and if the arrival in Persia is put earlier, Polo’s\r\n    numbers can scarcely be held to. Or, the eighteen months mentioned\r\n    at vol. i. p. 35, must _include_ the five months’ stoppage. We may\r\n    then suppose that they reached Hormuz about November 1293, and\r\n    Gházán’s camp a month or two later. [20] The French text which\r\n    forms the _basis_ of my translation says that, excluding mariners,\r\n    there were 600 souls, out of whom only 8 survived. The older MS.\r\n    which I quote as G. T., makes the number 18, a fact that I had\r\n    overlooked till the sheets were printed off.\r\n\r\n[21] Died 12th March, 1291.\r\n\r\n[22] All dates are found so corrupt that even in this one I do not feel\r\n    absolute confidence. Marco in dictating the book is aware that\r\n    Gházán had attained the throne of Persia (see vol. i. p. 36, and\r\n    ii. pp. 50 and 477), an event which did not occur till October,\r\n    1295. The date assigned to it, however, by Marco (ii. 477) is 1294,\r\n    or the year _before_ that assigned to the return home.\r\n\r\n    The travellers may have stopped some time at Constantinople on\r\n    their way, or even may have visited the northern shores of the\r\n    Black Sea; otherwise, indeed, how did Marco acquire his knowledge\r\n    of that Sea (ii. 486–488) and of events in Kipchak (ii. 496\r\n    _seqq._)? If 1296 was the date of return, moreover, the\r\n    six-and-twenty years assigned in the preamble as the period of\r\n    Marco’s absence (p. 2) would be nearer accuracy. For he left Venice\r\n    in the spring or summer of 1271.\r\n\r\n[23] Marco Barbaro, in his account of the Polo family, tells what seems\r\n    to be the same tradition in a different and more mythical version:—\r\n\r\n    “From ear to ear the story has past till it reached mine, that\r\n    when the three Kinsmen arrived at their home they were dressed in\r\n    the most shabby and sordid manner, insomuch that the wife of one\r\n    of them gave away to a beggar that came to the door one of those\r\n    garments of his, all torn, patched, and dirty as it was. The next\r\n    day he asked his wife for that mantle of his, in order to put away\r\n    the jewels that were sewn up in it; but she told him she had given\r\n    it away to a poor man, whom she did not know. Now, the stratagem he\r\n    employed to recover it was this. He went to the Bridge of Rialto,\r\n    and stood there turning a wheel, to no apparent purpose, but as if\r\n    he were a madman, and to all those who crowded round to see what\r\n    prank was this, and asked him why he did it, he answered: ‘He’ll\r\n    come if God pleases.’ So after two or three days he recognised his\r\n    old coat on the back of one of those who came to stare at his mad\r\n    proceedings, and got it back again. Then, indeed, he was judged to\r\n    be quite the reverse of a madman! And from those jewels he built\r\n    in the contrada of S. Giovanni Grisostomo a very fine palace for\r\n    those days; and the family got among the vulgar the name of the\r\n    _Ca’ Million_, because the report was that they had jewels to the\r\n    value of a million of ducats; and the palace has kept that name to\r\n    the present day—_viz._, 1566.” (_Genealogies_, MS. copy in _Museo\r\n    Civico_; quoted also by _Baldelli Boni, Vita_, p. xxxi.)\r\n\r\n[24] The Will of the Elder Marco, to which we have several times\r\n    referred, is dated at Rialto 5th August, 1280.\r\n\r\n    The testator describes himself as formerly of Constantinople, but\r\n    now dwelling in the confine of S. Severo.\r\n\r\n    His brothers _Nicolo_ and _Maffeo_, if at Venice, are to be his\r\n    sole trustees and executors, but in case of their continued\r\n    absence he nominates _Jordano Trevisano_, and his sister-in-law\r\n    _Fiordelisa_ of the confine of S. Severo.\r\n\r\n    The proper tithe to be paid. All his clothes and furniture to be\r\n    sold, and from the proceeds his funeral to be defrayed, and the\r\n    balance to purchase masses for his soul at the discretion of his\r\n    trustees.\r\n\r\n    Particulars of money due to him from his partnership with Donato\r\n    Grasso, now of Justinople (Capo d’Istria), 1200 _lire_ in all.\r\n    (Fifty-two lire due by said partnership to Angelo di Tumba of S.\r\n    Severo.)\r\n\r\n    The above money bequeathed to his son _Nicolo_, living at\r\n    _Soldachia_, or failing him, to his beloved brothers _Nicolo_ and\r\n    _Maffeo_. Failing them, to the sons of his said brothers (_sic_)\r\n    _Marco_ and _Maffeo_. Failing them, to be spent for the good of his\r\n    soul at the discretion of his trustees.\r\n\r\n    To his son Nicolo he bequeaths a silver-wrought girdle of vermilion\r\n    silk, two silver spoons, a silver cup without cover (or saucer?\r\n    _sine cembalo_), his desk, two pairs of sheets, a velvet quilt, a\r\n    counterpane, a feather-bed—all on the same conditions as above, and\r\n    to remain with the trustees till his son returns to Venice.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile the trustees are to invest the money at his son’s risk\r\n    and benefit, but only here in Venice (_investiant seu investire,\r\n    faciant_).\r\n\r\n    From the proceeds to come in from his partnership with his brothers\r\n    Nicolo and Maffeo, he bequeaths 200 lire to his daughter Maroca.\r\n\r\n    From same source 100 lire to his natural son Antony.\r\n\r\n    Has in his desk (_capsella_) two hyperperae (Byzantine gold coins),\r\n    and three golden florins, which he bequeaths to the sister-in-law\r\n    _Fiordelisa_.\r\n\r\n    Gives freedom to all his slaves and handmaidens.\r\n\r\n    Leaves his house in Soldachia to the Minor Friars of that place,\r\n    reserving life-occupancy to his son Nicolo and daughter Maroca.\r\n\r\n    The rest of his goods to his son Nicolo.\r\n\r\n[25] The terms in which the younger Maffeo mentions these half-brothers\r\n    in his Will (1300) seem to indicate that they were still young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       IV. DIGRESSION CONCERNING THE MANSION OF THE POLO FAMILY\r\n                              AT VENICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Probable period of their establishment at S. Giovanni\r\nGrisostomo.]\r\n\r\n23. We have seen that Ramusio places the scene of the story recently\r\nalluded to at the mansion in the parish of S. Giovanni Grisostomo,\r\nthe court of which was known in his time as the Corte del Millioni;\r\nand indeed he speaks of the Travellers as at once on their arrival\r\nresorting to that mansion as their family residence. Ramusio’s details\r\nhave so often proved erroneous that I should not be surprised if this\r\nalso should be a mistake. At least we find (so far as I can learn) no\r\nprevious intimation that the family were connected with that locality.\r\nThe grandfather Andrea is styled of _San Felice_. The will of Maffeo\r\nPolo the younger, made in 1300, which we shall give hereafter in\r\nabstract, appears to be the first document that connects the family\r\nwith S. Giovanni Grisostomo. It indeed styles the testator’s father\r\n“the late Nicolo Paulo of the confine of St. John Chrysostom,” but that\r\nonly shows what is not disputed, that the Travellers after their return\r\nfrom the East settled in this locality. And the same will appears\r\nto indicate a surviving connexion with S. Felice, for the priests\r\nand clerks who drew it up and witness it are all of the church of S.\r\nFelice, and it is to the parson of S. Felice and his successor that\r\nMaffeo bequeaths an annuity to procure their prayers for the souls\r\nof his father, his mother, and himself, though after the successor\r\nthe annuity is to pass on the same condition to the senior priest of\r\nS. Giovanni Grisostomo. Marco Polo the Elder is in his will described\r\nas of _S. Severo_, as is also his sister-in-law Fiordelisa, and the\r\ndocument contains no reference to S. Giovanni. On the whole therefore\r\nit seems probable that the Palazzo in the latter parish was purchased\r\nby the Travellers after their return from the East.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corte del Milione, Venice.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relic of the Casa Polo in the Corte Sabbionera.]\r\n\r\n24. The Court which was known in the 16th century as the Corte del\r\nMillioni has been generally understood to be that now known as the\r\nCorte Sabbionera, and here is still pointed out a relic of Marco Polo’s\r\nmansion. [Indeed it is called now (1899) _Corte del Milione_; see p.\r\n_30_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\nM. Pauthier’s edition is embellished with a good engraving which\r\npurports to represent the House of Marco Polo. But he has been misled.\r\nHis engraving in fact exhibits, at least as the prominent feature, an\r\nembellished representation of a small house which exists on the _west\r\nside_ of the Sabbionera, and which had at one time perhaps that pointed\r\nstyle of architecture which his engraving shows, though its present\r\ndecoration is paltry and unreal. But it is on the _north side_ of the\r\nCourt, and on the foundations now occupied by the Malibran theatre,\r\nthat Venetian tradition and the investigations of Venetian antiquaries\r\nconcur in indicating the site of the Casa Polo. At the end of the\r\n16th century a great fire destroyed the Palazzo,[2] and under the\r\ndescription of “an old mansion ruined from the foundation” it passed\r\ninto the hands of one Stefano Vecchia, who sold it in 1678 to Giovanni\r\nCarlo Grimani. He built on the site of the ruins a theatre which was\r\nin its day one of the largest in Italy, and was called the Theatre\r\nof S. Giovanni Grisostomo; afterwards the _Teatro Emeronitio_. When\r\nmodernized in our own day the proprietors gave it the name of Malibran,\r\nin honour of that famous singer, and this it still bears.[3]\r\n\r\n[In 1881, the year of the Venice International Geographical Congress, a\r\nTablet was put up on the Theatre with the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n                          QVI FURONO LE CASE\r\n                                  DI\r\n                              MARCO POLO\r\n             CHE VIAGGIÒ LE PIÙ LONTANE REGIONI DELL’ASIA\r\n                            E LE DESCRISSE\r\n\r\n                        PER DECRETO DEL COMUNE\r\n                             MDCCCLXXXI].\r\n\r\nThere is still to be seen on the north side of the Court an arched\r\ndoorway in Italo-Byzantine style, richly sculptured with scrolls,\r\ndisks, and symbolical animals, and on the wall above the doorway is a\r\ncross similarly ornamented.[4] The style and the decorations are those\r\nwhich were usual in Venice in the 13th century. The arch opens into a\r\npassage from which a similar doorway at the other end, also retaining\r\nsome scantier relics of decoration, leads to the entrance of the\r\nMalibran Theatre. Over the archway in the Corte Sabbionera the building\r\nrises into a kind of tower. This, as well as the sculptured arches and\r\ncross, Signor Casoni, who gave a good deal of consideration to the\r\nsubject, believed to be a relic of the old Polo House. But the tower\r\n(which Pauthier’s view does show) is now entirely modernized.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Malibran Theatre, Venice.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The site of the CA’ POLO.\r\n\r\n  Fig. A.

Scale 1 to 1315.]\r\n\r\nOther remains of Byzantine sculpture, which are probably fragments of\r\nthe decoration of the same mansion, are found imbedded in the walls of\r\nneighbouring houses.[6] It is impossible to determine anything further\r\nas to the form or extent of the house of the time of the Polos, but\r\nsome slight idea of its appearance about the year 1500 may be seen\r\nin the extract (fig. A) which we give from the famous pictorial map\r\nof Venice attributed erroneously to Albert Dürer. The state of the\r\nbuildings in the last century is shown in (fig. B) an extract from the\r\nfine Map of Ughi; and their present condition in one (fig. C) reduced\r\nfrom the Modern Official Map of the Municipality.\r\n\r\n[Coming from the Church of S. G. Grisostomo to enter the calle del\r\nTeatro on the left and the passage (_Sottoportico_) leading to the\r\n_Corte del Milione_, one has in front of him a building with a door of\r\nthe epoch of the Renaissance; it was the office of the _provveditori_\r\nof silk; on the architrave are engraved the words:\r\n\r\n                           PROVISORES SERICI\r\n\r\nand below, above the door, is the Tablet which] in the year 1827 the\r\nAbate Zenier caused to be put up with this inscription:—\r\n\r\n               AEDES PROXIMA THALIAE CVLTVI MODO ADDICTA\r\n               MARCI POLO P.

I believe that of late years some doubts have been thrown on\r\nthe tradition of the site indicated as that of the Casa Polo, though\r\nI am not aware of the grounds of such doubts. But a document recently\r\ndiscovered at Venice by Comm. Barozzi, one of a series relating to the\r\ntestamentary estate of Marco Polo, goes far to confirm the tradition.\r\nThis is the copy of a technical definition of two pieces of house\r\nproperty adjoining the property of Marco Polo and his brother Stephen,\r\nwhich were sold to Marco Polo by his wife Donata[7] in June 1321.\r\nThough the definition is not decisive, from the rarity of topographical\r\nreferences and absence of points of the compass, the description of\r\nDonata’s tenements as standing on the Rio (presumably that of S.\r\nGiovanni Grisostomo) on one side, opening by certain porticoes and\r\nstairs on the other to the Court and common alley leading to the Church\r\nof S. Giovanni Grisostomo, and abutting in two places on the CA’ POLO,\r\nthe property of her husband and Stefano, will apply perfectly to a\r\nbuilding occupying the western portion of the area on which now stands\r\nthe Theatre, and perhaps forming the western side of a Court of which\r\nCasa Polo formed the other three sides.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to the Corte del Milione, Venice.]\r\n\r\nWe know nothing more of Polo till we find him appearing a year or two\r\nlater in rapid succession as the Captain of a Venetian Galley, as a\r\nprisoner of war, and as an author.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Marco Barbaro’s story related at p. _25_ speaks of the Ca’ Million\r\n    as _built_ by the travellers.\r\n\r\n    From a list of parchments existing in the archives of the _Casa di\r\n    Ricovero_, or Great Poor House, at Venice, Comm. Berchet obtained\r\n    the following indication:—\r\n\r\n    “_No. 94. Marco Galetti invests_ Marco Polo _S. of_ Nicolo\r\n    _with the ownership of his possessions_ (beni) _in_ S. Giovanni\r\n    Grisostomo; _10 September, 1319; drawn up by the Notary Nicolo,\r\n    priest of S. Canciano._”\r\n\r\n    This document would perhaps have thrown light on the matter, but\r\n    unfortunately recent search by several parties has failed to\r\n    trace it. [The document has been discovered since: see vol. ii.,\r\n    _Calendar_, No. 6.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[2] ——“Sua casa che era posta nel confin di S.

DIGRESSION CONCERNING THE WAR-GALLEYS OF THE\r\n               MEDITERRANEAN STATES IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangement of the Rowers in Mediæval Galleys: a separate\r\noar to every man.]\r\n\r\n25. And before entering on this new phase of the Traveller’s biography\r\nit may not be without interest that we say something regarding the\r\nequipment of those galleys which are so prominent in the mediæval\r\nhistory of the Mediterranean.[1]\r\n\r\nEschewing that “Serbonian Bog, where armies whole have sunk” of Books\r\nand Commentators, the theory of the classification of the Biremes and\r\nTriremes of the Ancients, we can at least assert on secure grounds\r\nthat in _mediæval_ armament, up to the middle of the 16th century or\r\nthereabouts, the characteristic distinction of galleys of different\r\ncalibres, so far as such differences existed, was based _on the number\r\nof rowers that sat on one bench pulling each his separate oar, but\r\nthrough one_ portella _or rowlock-port_.[2] And to the classes of\r\ngalleys so distinguished the Italians, of the later Middle Age at\r\nleast, did certainly apply, rightly or wrongly, the classical terms of\r\n_Bireme_, _Trireme_, and _Quinquereme_, in the sense of galleys having\r\ntwo men and two oars to a bench, three men and three oars to a bench,\r\nand five men and five oars to a bench.[3]\r\n\r\nThat this was the mediæval arrangement is very certain from the details\r\nafforded by Marino Sanudo the Elder, confirmed by later writers and by\r\nworks of art. Previous to 1290, Sanudo tells us, almost all the galleys\r\nthat went to the Levant had but two oars and men to a bench; but as it\r\nhad been found that three oars and men to a bench could be employed\r\nwith great advantage, after that date nearly all galleys adopted this\r\narrangement, which was called _ai Terzaruoli_.[4]\r\n\r\nMoreover experiments made by the Venetians in 1316 had shown that four\r\nrowers to a bench could be employed still more advantageously. And\r\nwhere the galleys could be used on inland waters, and could be made\r\nmore bulky, Sanudo would even recommend five to a bench, or have gangs\r\nof rowers on two decks with either three or four men to the bench on\r\neach deck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change of System in the 16th century.]\r\n\r\n26. This system of grouping the oars, and putting only one man to an\r\noar, continued down to the 16th century, during the first half of which\r\ncame in the more modern system of using great oars, equally spaced,\r\nand requiring from four to seven men each to ply them, in the manner\r\nwhich endured till late in the last century, when galleys became\r\naltogether obsolete. Captain Pantero Pantera, the author of a work\r\non Naval Tactics (1616), says he had heard, from veterans who had\r\ncommanded galleys equipped in the antiquated fashion, that _three_ men\r\nto a bench, with separate oars, answered better than three men to one\r\ngreat oar, but four men to one great oar (he says) were certainly more\r\nefficient than four men with separate oars. The new-fashioned great\r\noars, he tells us, were styled _Remi di Scaloccio_, the old grouped\r\noars _Remi a Zenzile_,—terms the etymology of which I cannot explain.[5]\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the four-banked and five-banked galleys,\r\nof which Marino Sanudo speaks, really then came into practical use.\r\nA great five-banked galley on this system, built in 1529 in the\r\nVenice Arsenal by Vettor Fausto, was the subject of so much talk and\r\nexcitement, that it must evidently have been something quite new and\r\nunheard of.[6] So late as 1567 indeed the King of Spain built at\r\nBarcelona a galley of thirty-six benches to the side, and seven men\r\nto the bench, with a separate oar to each in the old fashion. But it\r\nproved a failure.[7]\r\n\r\nDown to the introduction of the great oars the usual system appears to\r\nhave been three oars to a bench for the larger galleys, and two oars\r\nfor lighter ones. The _fuste_ or lighter galleys of the Venetians, even\r\nto about the middle of the 16th century, had their oars in pairs from\r\nthe stern to the mast, and single oars only from the mast forward.[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some details of the 13th century Galleys.]\r\n\r\n27. Returning then to the three-banked and two-banked galleys of the\r\nlatter part of the 13th century, the number of benches on each side\r\nseems to have run from twenty-five to twenty-eight, at least as I\r\ninterpret Sanudo’s calculations. The 100-oared vessels often mentioned\r\n(_e.g._ by _Muntaner_, p. 419) were probably two-banked vessels with\r\ntwenty-five benches to a side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe galleys were very narrow, only 15½ feet in beam.[9] But to give\r\nroom for the play of the oars and the passage of the fighting-men, &c.,\r\nthis width was largely augmented by an _opera-morta_, or outrigger\r\ndeck, projecting much beyond the ship’s sides and supported by timber\r\nbrackets.[10] I do not find it stated how great this projection was in\r\nthe mediæval galleys, but in those of the 17th century it was _on each\r\nside_ as much as ²⁄₉ths of the true beam. And if it was as great in the\r\n13th-century galleys the total width between the false gunnels would be\r\nabout 22¼ feet.\r\n\r\nIn the centre line of the deck ran, the whole length of the vessel, a\r\nraised gangway called the _corsia_, for passage clear of the oars.\r\n\r\nThe benches were arranged as in this diagram. The part of the\r\nbench next the gunnel was at right angles to it, but the other\r\ntwo-thirds of the bench were thrown forward obliquely. _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\nindicate the position of the three rowers. The shortest oar _a_ was\r\ncalled _Terlicchio_, the middle one _b Posticcio_, the long oar _c\r\nPiamero_.[11]\r\n\r\nI do not find any information as to how the oars worked on the gunnels.\r\nThe Siena fresco (see p. _35_) appears to show them attached by loops\r\nand pins, which is the usual practice in boats of the Mediterranean\r\nnow. In the cut from D. Tintoretto (p. _37_) the groups of oars\r\nprotrude through regular ports in the bulwarks, but this probably\r\nrepresents the use of a later day. In any case the oars of each bench\r\nmust have worked in very close proximity. Sanudo states the length of\r\nthe galleys of his time (1300–1320) as 117 feet. This was doubtless\r\nlength of _keel_, for that is specified (“_da ruoda a ruoda_”) in\r\nother Venetian measurements, but the whole oar space could scarcely\r\nhave been so much, and with twenty-eight benches to a side there\r\ncould not have been more than 4 feet gunnel-space to each bench. And\r\nas one of the objects of the grouping of the oars was to allow room\r\nbetween the benches for the action of cross-bowmen, &c., it is plain\r\nthat the rowlock space for the three oars must have been very much\r\ncompressed.[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galley-Fight, from a Mediæval Fresco at Siena. (See p.\r\n  _36_.)]\r\n\r\nThe rowers were divided into three classes, with graduated pay.\r\nThe highest class, who pulled the poop or stroke oars, were called\r\n_Portolati_; those at the bow, called _Prodieri_, formed the second\r\nclass.[13]\r\n\r\nSome elucidation of the arrangements that we have tried to describe\r\nwill be found in our cuts. That at p. _35_ is from a drawing, by the\r\naid of a very imperfect photograph, of part of one of the frescoes\r\nof Spinello Aretini in the Municipal Palace at Siena, representing a\r\nvictory of the Venetians over the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa’s fleet,\r\ncommanded by his son Otho, in 1176; but no doubt the galleys, &c., are\r\nof the artist’s own age, the middle of the 14th century.[14] In this\r\nwe see plainly the projecting _opera-morta_, and the rowers sitting two\r\nto a bench, each with his oar, for these are two-banked. We can also\r\ndiscern the Latin rudder on the quarter. (See this volume, p. 119.) In\r\na picture in the Uffizj, at Florence, of about the same date, by Pietro\r\nLaurato (it is in the corridor near the entrance), may be seen a small\r\nfigure of a galley with the oars also very distinctly coupled.[15]\r\nCasoni has engraved, after Cristoforo Canale, a pictorial plan of a\r\nVenetian trireme of the 16th century, which shows the arrangement of\r\nthe oars in _triplets_ very plainly.\r\n\r\nThe following cut has been sketched from an engraving of a picture by\r\nDomenico Tintoretto in the Doge’s palace, representing, I believe,\r\nthe same action (real or imaginary) as Spinello’s fresco, but with\r\nthe costume and construction of a later date. It shows, however, very\r\nplainly, the projecting _opera-morta_ and the arrangement of the oars\r\nin fours, issuing through row-ports in high bulwarks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of a Sea Fight, after Dom. Tintoretto.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fighting Arrangements.]\r\n\r\n28. Midships in the mediæval galley a castle was erected, of the width\r\nof the ship, and some 20 feet in length; its platform being elevated\r\nsufficiently to allow of free passage under it and over the benches.\r\nAt the bow was the battery, consisting of mangonels (see vol. ii. p.\r\n161 _seqq._) and great cross-bows with winding gear,[16] whilst there\r\nwere shot-ports[17] for smaller cross-bows along the gunnels in the\r\nintervals between the benches. Some of the larger galleys had openings\r\nto admit horses at the stern, which were closed and caulked for the\r\nvoyage, being under water when the vessel was at sea.[18]\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been a very usual piece of tactics, in attacking as\r\nwell as in awaiting attack, to connect a large number of galleys by\r\nhawsers, and sometimes also to link the oars together, so as to render\r\nit difficult for the enemy to break the line or run aboard. We find\r\nthis practised by the Genoese on the defensive at the battle of Ayas\r\n(_infra_, p. _43_), and it is constantly resorted to by the Catalans in\r\nthe battles described by Ramon de Muntaner.[19]\r\n\r\nSanudo says the toil of rowing in the galleys was excessive, almost\r\nunendurable. Yet it seems to have been performed by freely-enlisted\r\nmen, and therefore it was probably less severe than that of the\r\ngreat-oared galleys of more recent times, which it was found\r\nimpracticable to work by free enlistment, or otherwise than by slaves\r\nunder the most cruel driving.[20] I am not well enough read to say\r\nthat war-galleys were never rowed by slaves in the Middle Ages, but\r\nthe only doubtful allusion to such a class that I have met with is\r\nin one passage of Muntaner, where he says, describing the Neapolitan\r\nand Catalan fleets drawing together for action, that the gangs\r\nof the galleys had to toil _like_ “forçats” (p. 313). Indeed, as\r\nregards Venice at least, convict rowers are stated to have been first\r\nintroduced in 1549, previous to which the gangs were of _galeotti\r\nassoldati_.[21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crew of a Galley and Staff of a Fleet.]\r\n\r\n29. We have already mentioned that Sanudo requires for his three-banked\r\ngalley a ship’s company of 250 men. They are distributed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Comito_ or Master              1\r\n  Quartermasters                  8\r\n  Carpenters                      2\r\n  Caulkers                        2\r\n  In charge of stores and arms    4\r\n  Orderlies                       2\r\n  Cook                            1\r\n  Arblasteers                    50\r\n  Rowers                        180\r\n                                ———\r\n                                250[22]\r\n\r\nThis does not include the _Sopracomito_, or Gentleman-Commander, who\r\nwas expected to be _valens homo et probus_, a soldier and a gentleman,\r\nfit to be consulted on occasion by the captain-general. In the Venetian\r\nfleet he was generally a noble.[23]\r\n\r\nThe aggregate pay of such a crew, not including the sopracomito,\r\namounted monthly to 60 _lire de’ grossi_, or 600 florins, equivalent\r\nto 280_l._ at modern gold value; and the cost for a year to nearly\r\n3160_l._, exclusive of the victualling of the vessel and the pay of\r\nthe gentleman-commander. The build or purchase of a galley complete is\r\nestimated by the same author at 15,000 florins, or 7012_l._\r\n\r\nWe see that war cost a good deal in money even then.\r\n\r\nBesides the ship’s own complement Sanudo gives an estimate for\r\nthe general staff of a fleet of 60 galleys. This consists of a\r\ncaptain-general, two (vice) admirals, and the following:—\r\n\r\n     6 _Probi homines_, or gentlemen of character, forming a council to\r\n       the Captain-General;\r\n     4 Commissaries of Stores;\r\n     2 Commissaries over the Arms;\r\n     3 Physicians;\r\n     3 Surgeons;\r\n     5 Master Engineers and Carpenters;\r\n    15 Master Smiths;\r\n    12 Master Fletchers;\r\n     5 Cuirass men and Helmet-makers;\r\n    15 Oar-makers and Shaft-makers;\r\n    10 Stone cutters for stone shot;\r\n    10 Master Arblast-makers;\r\n    20 Musicians;\r\n    20 Orderlies, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Music; and other particulars.]\r\n\r\n30. The musicians formed an important part of the equipment. Sanudo\r\nsays that in going into action every vessel should make the greatest\r\npossible display of colours; gonfalons and broad banners should float\r\nfrom stem to stern, and gay pennons all along the bulwarks; whilst it\r\nwas impossible to have too much of noisy music, of pipes, trumpets,\r\nkettle-drums, and what not, to put heart into the crew and strike fear\r\ninto the enemy.[24]\r\n\r\nSo Joinville, in a glorious passage, describes the galley of his\r\nkinsman, the Count of Jaffa, at the landing of St. Lewis in Egypt:—\r\n\r\n  “That galley made the most gallant figure of them all, for it was\r\n  painted all over, above water and below, with scutcheons of the\r\n  count’s arms, the field of which was _or_ with a cross _patée\r\n  gules_.[25] He had a good 300 rowers in his galley, and every man\r\n  of them had a target blazoned with his arms in beaten gold. And,\r\n  as they came on, the galley looked to be some flying creature,\r\n  with such spirit did the rowers spin it along;—or rather, with\r\n  the rustle of its flags, and the roar of its nacaires and drums\r\n  and Saracen horns, you might have taken it for a rushing bolt of\r\n  heaven.”[26]\r\n\r\nThe galleys, which were very low in the water,[27] could not keep the\r\nsea in rough weather, and in winter they never willingly kept the sea\r\nat night, however fair the weather might be. Yet Sanudo mentions that\r\nhe had been with armed galleys to Sluys in Flanders.\r\n\r\nI will mention two more particulars before concluding this digression.\r\nWhen captured galleys were towed into port it was stern foremost, and\r\nwith their colours dragging on the surface of the sea.[28] And the\r\ncustom of saluting at sunset (probably by music) was in vogue on board\r\nthe galleys of the 13th century.[29]\r\n\r\nWe shall now sketch the circumstances that led to the appearance of our\r\nTraveller in the command of a war-galley.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] I regret not to have had access to Jal’s learned memoirs\r\n    (_Archéologie Navale_, Paris, 1839) whilst writing this section,\r\n    nor since, except for a hasty look at his Essay on the difficult\r\n    subject of the oar arrangements. I see that he rejects so great\r\n    a number of oars as I deduce from the statements of Sanudo and\r\n    others, and that he regards a large number of the rowers as\r\n    supplementary.\r\n\r\n[2] It seems the more desirable to elucidate this, because writers on\r\n    mediæval subjects so accomplished as Buchon and Capmany have (it\r\n    would seem) entirely misconceived the matter, assuming that all the\r\n    men on one bench pulled at one oar.\r\n\r\n[3] See _Coronelli, Atlante Veneto_, I. 139, 140. Marino Sanudo the\r\n    Elder, though not using the term _trireme_, says it was well\r\n    understood from ancient authors that the Romans employed their\r\n    rowers _three to a bench_ (p. 59).\r\n\r\n[4] “_Ad terzarolos_” (_Secreta Fidelium Crucis_, p. 57). The Catalan\r\n    Worthy, Ramon de Muntaner, indeed constantly denounces the practice\r\n    of manning _all_ the galleys with _terzaruoli_, or _tersols_,\r\n    as his term is. But his reason is that these thirds-men were\r\n    taken from the oar when crossbowmen were wanted, to act in that\r\n    capacity, and as such they were good for nothing; the crossbowmen,\r\n    he insists, should be men specially enlisted for that service and\r\n    kept to that. He would have some 10 or 20 per cent. only of the\r\n    fleet built very light and manned in threes. He does not seem to\r\n    have contemplated oars three-banked, and crossbowmen _besides_, as\r\n    Sanudo does. (See below; and _Muntaner_, pp. 288, 323, 525, etc.)\r\n\r\n    In Sanudo we have a glimpse worth noting of the word _soldiers_\r\n    advancing towards the modern sense; he expresses a strong\r\n    preference for _soldati_ (viz. _paid_ soldiers) over _crusaders_\r\n    (viz. volunteers), p. 74.\r\n\r\n[5] _L’Armata Navale_, Roma, 1616, pp. 150–151.\r\n\r\n[6] See a work to which I am indebted for a good deal of light and\r\n    information, the Engineer Giovanni Casoni’s Essay: “_Dei Navigli\r\n    Poliremi usati nella Marina dagli Antichi Veneziani_,” in\r\n    “_Esercitazioni dell’Ateneo Veneto_,” vol. ii. p. 338. This great\r\n    _Quinquereme_, as it was styled, is stated to have been struck by a\r\n    fire-arrow, and blown up, in January 1570.\r\n\r\n[7] _Pantera_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[8] _Lazarus Bayfius de Re Navali Veterum_, in _Gronovii Thesaurus_,\r\n    Ven. 1737, vol. xi. p. 581. This writer also speaks of the\r\n    Quinquereme mentioned above (p. 577).\r\n\r\n[9] _Marinus Sanutius_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[10] See the woodcuts opposite and at p. 37; also _Pantera_, p. 46\r\n    (who is here, however, speaking of the great-oared galleys), and\r\n    _Coronelli_, i. 140.\r\n\r\n[11] _Casoni_, p. 324. He obtains these particulars from a manuscript\r\n    work of the 16th century by Cristoforo Canale.\r\n\r\n[12] Signor Casoni (p. 324) expresses his belief that no galley of\r\n    the 14th century had more than 100 oars. I differ from him with\r\n    hesitation, and still more as I find M. Jal agrees in this view. I\r\n    will state the grounds on which I came to a different conclusion.\r\n    (1) Marino Sanudo assigns 180 rowers for a galley equipped _ai\r\n    Terzaruoli_ (p. 75). This seemed to imply something near 180 oars,\r\n    for I do not find any allusion to reliefs being provided. In the\r\n    French galleys of the 18th century there were no reliefs except in\r\n    this way, that in long runs without urgency only half the oars were\r\n    pulled. (See _Mém. d’un Protestant condamné aux Galères_, etc.,\r\n    Réimprimés, Paris, 1865, p. 447.) If four men to a bench were to be\r\n    employed, then Sanudo seems to calculate for his smaller galleys\r\n    220 men actually rowing (see pp. 75–78). This seems to assume 55\r\n    benches, _i.e._, 28 on one side and 27 on the other, which with\r\n    3-banked oars would give 165 rowers. (2) Casoni himself refers to\r\n    Pietro Martire d’Anghieria’s account of a Great Galley of Venice\r\n    in which he was sent ambassador to Egypt from the Spanish Court in\r\n    1503. The crew amounted to 200, of whom 150 were for working the\r\n    sails and oars, _that being the number of oars in each galley_,\r\n    one man to each oar and three to each bench. Casoni assumes that\r\n    this vessel must have been much larger than the galleys of the 14th\r\n    century; but, however that may have been, Sanudo to his galley\r\n    assigns the larger crew of 250, of whom almost exactly the same\r\n    proportion (180) were rowers. And in the _galeazza_ described by\r\n    Pietro Martire the oars were used only as an occasional auxiliary.\r\n    (See his _Legationis Babylonicæ Libri Tres_, appended to his 3\r\n    Decads concerning the New World; _Basil_. 1533, f. 77 _ver._) (3)\r\n    The galleys of the 18th century, with their great oars 50 feet\r\n    long pulled by six or seven men each, had 25 benches to the side,\r\n    and only 4′ 6″ (French) gunnel-space to each oar. (See _Mém. d’un\r\n    Protest._, p. 434.) I imagine that a smaller space would suffice\r\n    for the 3 light oars of the mediæval system, so that this need\r\n    scarcely be a difficulty in the face of the preceding evidence.\r\n    Note also the _three hundred rowers_ in Joinville’s description\r\n    quoted at p. _40_. The great galleys of the Malay Sultan of Achin\r\n    in 1621 had, according to Beaulieu, from 700 to 800 rowers, but I\r\n    do not know on what system.\r\n\r\n[13] _Marinus Sanutius_, p. 78. These titles occur also in the\r\n    _Documenti d’ Amore_ of Fr. Barberino referred to at p. 117 of this\r\n    volume:—\r\n\r\n    “Convienti qui manieri _Portolatti e prodieri_ E presti galeotti\r\n    Aver, e forti e dotti.”\r\n\r\n[14] Spinello’s works, according to Vasari, extended from 1334 till\r\n    late in the century. A religious picture of his at Siena is\r\n    assigned to 1385, so the frescoes may probably be of about the same\r\n    period. Of the battle represented I can find no record.\r\n\r\n[15] Engraved in Jal, i. 330; with other mediæval illustrations of the\r\n    same points.\r\n\r\n[16] To these Casoni adds _Sifoni_ for discharging Greek fire; but this\r\n    he seems to take from the Greek treatise of the Emperor Leo. Though\r\n    I have introduced Greek fire in the cut at p. _49_, I doubt if\r\n    there is evidence of its use by the Italians in the thirteenth\r\n    century. Joinville describes it like something strange and new.\r\n\r\n    In after days the artillery occupied the same position, at the bow\r\n    of the galley.\r\n\r\n    Great beams, hung like battering rams, are mentioned by Sanudo, as\r\n    well as iron crow’s-feet with fire attached, to shoot among the\r\n    rigging, and jars of quick-lime and soft soap to fling in the eyes\r\n    of the enemy. The lime is said to have been used by Doria against\r\n    the Venetians at Curzola (_infra_, p. _48_), and seems to have been\r\n    a usual provision. Francesco Barberini specifies among the stores\r\n    for his galley: “_Calcina_, con lancioni, Pece, pietre, e ronconi”\r\n    (p. 259). And Christine de Pisan, in her _Faiz du Sage Roy Charles_\r\n    (V. of France), explains also the use of the soap: “_Item_, on\r\n    doit avoir pluseurs vaisseaulx legiers à rompre, comme _poz plains\r\n    de chauls_ ou pouldre, et gecter dedens; et, par ce, seront comme\r\n    avuglez, au brisier des poz. _Item_, on doit avoir autres _poz\r\n    de mol savon_ et gecter es nefzs des adversaires, et quant les\r\n    vaisseaulx brisent, le savon est glissant, si ne se peuent en piez\r\n    soustenir et chiéent en l’eaue” (pt. ii. ch. 38).\r\n\r\n[17] _Balistariæ_, whence no doubt _Balistrada_ and our _Balustrade_.\r\n    Wedgwood’s etymology is far-fetched. And in his new edition (1872),\r\n    though he has shifted his ground, he has not got nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[18] _Sanutius_, p. 53; _Joinville_, p. 40; _Muntaner_, 316, 403.\r\n\r\n[19] See pp. 270, 288, 324, and especially 346.\r\n\r\n[20] See the _Protestant_, cited above, p. 441, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[21] _Venezia e le sue Lagune_, ii. 52.\r\n\r\n[22] _Mar.

He\r\n    said, ‘God forbid that I should attack them, all asleep as they\r\n    are! Let the trumpets and nacaires sound to awaken them, and I will\r\n    tarry till they be ready for action. No man shall have it to say,\r\n    if I beat them, that it was by catching them asleep.’” (_Munt._ p.\r\n    287.) It is what Nelson might have done!\r\n\r\n    The Turkish admiral Sidi ’Ali, about to engage a Portuguese\r\n    squadron in the Straits of Hormuz, in 1553, describes the Franks as\r\n    “dressing their vessels with flags and coming on.” (_J.

Jealousies, too characteristic of the Italian communities, were,\r\nin the case of the three great trading republics of Venice, Genoa,\r\nand Pisa, aggravated by commercial rivalries, whilst, between the two\r\nfirst of those states, and also between the two last, the bitterness of\r\nsuch feelings had been augmenting during the whole course of the 13th\r\ncentury.[1]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant part played by Venice in the conquest of Constantinople\r\n(1204), and the preponderance she thus acquired on the Greek shores,\r\nstimulated her arrogance and the resentment of her rivals. The three\r\nstates no longer stood on a level as bidders for the shifting favour\r\nof the Emperor of the East. By treaty, not only was Venice established\r\nas the most important ally of the empire and as mistress of a large\r\nfraction of its territory, but all members of nations at war with her\r\nwere prohibited from entering its limits. Though the Genoese colonies\r\ncontinued to exist, they stood at a great disadvantage, where their\r\nrivals were so predominant and enjoyed exemption from duties, to which\r\nthe Genoese remained subject. Hence jealousies and resentments reached\r\na climax in the Levantine settlements, and this colonial exacerbation\r\nreacted on the mother States.\r\n\r\nA dispute which broke out at Acre in 1255 came to a head in a war which\r\nlasted for years, and was felt all over Syria. It began in a quarrel\r\nabout a very old church called St. Sabba’s, which stood on the common\r\nboundary of the Venetian and Genoese estates in Acre,[2] and this flame\r\nwas blown by other unlucky occurrences. Acre suffered grievously.[3]\r\nVenice at this time generally kept the upper hand, beating Genoa by\r\nland and sea, and driving her from Acre altogether.✛ Four ancient\r\nporphyry figures from St. Sabba’s were sent in triumph to Venice, and\r\nwith their strange devices still stand at the exterior corner of St.\r\nMark’s, towards the Ducal Palace.[4]\r\n\r\nBut no number of defeats could extinguish the spirit of Genoa, and the\r\ntables were turned when in her wrath she allied herself with Michael\r\nPalaeologus to upset the feeble and tottering Latin Dynasty, and with\r\nit the preponderance of Venice on the Bosphorus. The new emperor handed\r\nover to his allies the castle of their foes, which they tore down with\r\njubilations, and now it was their turn to send its stones as trophies\r\nto Genoa. Mutual hate waxed fiercer than ever; no merchant fleet of\r\neither state could go to sea without convoy, and wherever their ships\r\nmet they fought.[5] It was something like the state of things between\r\nSpain and England in the days of Drake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures from St. Sabba’s, sent to Venice.]\r\n\r\nThe energy and capacity of the Genoese seemed to rise with their\r\nsuccess, and both in seamanship and in splendour they began almost\r\nto surpass their old rivals. The fall of Acre (1291), and the total\r\nexpulsion of the Franks from Syria, in great measure barred the\r\nsouthern routes of Indian trade, whilst the predominance of Genoa in\r\nthe Euxine more or less obstructed the free access of her rival to the\r\nnorthern routes by Trebizond and Tana.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle in Bay of Ayas in 1294.]\r\n\r\n32. Truces were made and renewed, but the old fire still smouldered. In\r\nthe spring of 1294 it broke into flame, in consequence of the seizure\r\nin the Grecian seas of three Genoese vessels by a Venetian fleet.\r\nThis led to an action with a Genoese convoy which sought redress. The\r\nfight took place off Ayas in the Gulf of Scanderoon,[6] and though the\r\nGenoese were inferior in strength by one-third they gained a signal\r\nvictory, capturing all but three of the Venetian galleys, with rich\r\ncargoes, including that of Marco Basilio (or Basegio), the commodore.\r\n\r\nThis victory over their haughty foe was in its completeness evidently\r\na surprise to the Genoese, as well as a source of immense exultation,\r\nwhich is vigorously expressed in a ballad of the day, written in a\r\nstirring salt-water rhythm.[7] It represents the Venetians, as they\r\nenter the bay, in arrogant mirth reviling the Genoese with very\r\nunsavoury epithets as having deserted their ships to skulk on shore.\r\nThey are described as saying:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Off they’ve slunk! and left us nothing;\r\n       We shall get nor prize nor praise;\r\n       Nothing save those crazy timbers\r\n         Only fit to make a blaze.’”\r\n\r\nSo they advance carelessly—\r\n\r\n    “On they come! But lo their blunder!\r\n       When our lads start up anon,\r\n      Breaking out like unchained lions,\r\n       With a roar, ‘Fall on! Fall on!’”[8]\r\n\r\nAfter relating the battle and the thoroughness of the victory, ending\r\nin the conflagration of five-and-twenty captured galleys, the poet\r\nconcludes by an admonition to the enemy to moderate his pride and curb\r\nhis arrogant tongue, harping on the obnoxious epithet _porci leproxi_,\r\nwhich seems to have galled the Genoese.[9] He concludes:—\r\n\r\n    “Nor can I at all remember\r\n      Ever to have heard the story\r\n     Of a fight wherein the Victors\r\n      Reaped so rich a meed of glory!”[10]\r\n\r\nThe community of Genoa decreed that the victory should be commemorated\r\nby the annual presentation of a golden pall to the monastery of St.\r\nGerman’s, the saint on whose feast (28th May) it had been won.[11]\r\n\r\nThe startling news was received at Venice with wrath and grief, for\r\nthe flower of their navy had perished, and all energies were bent at\r\nonce to raise an overwhelming force.[12] The Pope (Boniface VIII.)\r\ninterfered as arbiter, calling for plenipotentiaries from both sides.\r\nBut spirits were too much inflamed, and this mediation came to nought.\r\n\r\nFurther outrages on both sides occurred in 1296. The Genoese\r\nresidences at Pera were fired, their great alum works on the coast of\r\nAnatolia were devastated, and Caffa was stormed and sacked; whilst\r\non the other hand a number of the Venetians at Constantinople were\r\nmassacred by the Genoese, and Marco Bembo, their Bailo, was flung from\r\na house-top. Amid such events the fire of enmity between the cities\r\nwaxed hotter and hotter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lamba Doria’s Expedition to the Adriatic.]\r\n\r\n33. In 1298 the Genoese made elaborate preparations for a great blow at\r\nthe enemy, and fitted out a powerful fleet which they placed under the\r\ncommand of LAMBA DORIA, a younger brother of Uberto of that illustrious\r\nhouse, under whom he had served fourteen years before in the great rout\r\nof the Pisans at Meloria.\r\n\r\nThe rendezvous of the fleet was in the Gulf of Spezia, as we learn\r\nfrom the same pithy Genoese poet who celebrated Ayas. This time the\r\nGenoese were bent on bearding St. Mark’s Lion in his own den; and after\r\ntouching at Messina they steered straight for the Adriatic:—\r\n\r\n    “Now, as astern Otranto bears,\r\n       Pull with a will! and, please the Lord,\r\n       Let them who bragged, with fire and sword,\r\n     To waste our homesteads, look to theirs!”[13]\r\n\r\nOn their entering the gulf a great storm dispersed the fleet. The\r\nadmiral with twenty of his galleys got into port at Antivari on the\r\nAlbanian coast, and next day was rejoined by fifty-eight more, with\r\nwhich he scoured the Dalmatian shore, plundering all Venetian property.\r\nSome sixteen of his galleys were still missing when he reached the\r\nisland of Curzola, or Scurzola as the more popular name seems to have\r\nbeen, the Black Corcyra of the Ancients—the chief town of which, a rich\r\nand flourishing place, the Genoese took and burned.[14] Thus they were\r\nengaged when word came that the Venetian fleet was in sight.\r\n\r\nVenice, on first hearing of the Genoese armament, sent Andrea Dandolo\r\nwith a large force to join and supersede Maffeo Quirini, who was\r\nalready cruising with a squadron in the Ionian sea; and, on receiving\r\nfurther information of the strength of the hostile expedition, the\r\nSignory hastily equipped thirty-two more galleys in Chioggia and the\r\nports of Dalmatia, and despatched them to join Dandolo, making the\r\nwhole number under his command up to something like ninety-five.\r\nRecent drafts had apparently told heavily upon the Venetian sources of\r\nenlistment, and it is stated that many of the complements were made up\r\nof rustics swept in haste from the Euganean hills. To this the Genoese\r\npoet seems to allude, alleging that the Venetians, in spite of their\r\nhaughty language, had to go begging for men and money up and down\r\nLombardy. “Did _we_ do like that, think you?” he adds:—\r\n\r\n    “Beat up for aliens? _We_ indeed?\r\n       When lacked we homeborn Genoese?\r\n       Search all the seas, no salts like these,\r\n     For Courage, Seacraft, Wit at need.”[15]\r\n\r\nOf one of the Venetian galleys, probably in the fleet which sailed\r\nunder Dandolo’s immediate command, went Marco Polo as _Sopracomito_ or\r\nGentleman-Commander.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fleets come in sight of each other at Curzola.]\r\n\r\n34. It was on the afternoon of Saturday the 6th September that the\r\nGenoese saw the Venetian fleet approaching, but, as sunset was not far\r\noff, both sides tacitly agreed to defer the engagement.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Genoese would appear to have occupied a position near the eastern\r\nend of the Island of Curzola, with the Peninsula of Sabbioncello behind\r\nthem, and Meleda on their left, whilst the Venetians advanced along the\r\nsouth side of Curzola. (See map on p. _50_).\r\n\r\nAccording to Venetian accounts the Genoese were staggered at the sight\r\nof the Venetian armaments, and sent more than once to seek terms,\r\noffering finally to surrender galleys and munitions of war, if the\r\ncrews were allowed to depart. This is an improbable story, and that\r\nof the Genoese ballad seems more like truth. Doria, it says, held\r\na council of his captains in the evening at which they all voted\r\nfor attack, whilst the Venetians, with that overweening sense of\r\nsuperiority which at this time is reflected in their own annals as\r\ndistinctly as in those of their enemies, kept scout-vessels out to\r\nwatch that the Genoese fleet, which they looked on as already their\r\nown, did not steal away in the darkness. A vain imagination, says the\r\npoet:—\r\n\r\n    “Blind error of vainglorious men\r\n       To dream that we should seek to flee\r\n       After those weary leagues of sea\r\n     Crossed, but to hunt them in their den!”[18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Venetians defeated, and Marco Polo a prisoner.]\r\n\r\n35. The battle began early on Sunday and lasted till the afternoon. The\r\nVenetians had the wind in their favour, but the morning sun in their\r\neyes. They made the attack, and with great impetuosity, capturing ten\r\nGenoese galleys; but they pressed on too wildly, and some of their\r\nvessels ran aground. One of their galleys too, being taken, was cleared\r\nof her crew and turned against the Venetians. These incidents caused\r\nconfusion among the assailants; the Genoese, who had begun to give\r\nway, took fresh heart, formed a close column, and advanced boldly\r\nthrough the Venetian line, already in disorder. The sun had begun\r\nto decline when there appeared on the Venetian flank the fifteen or\r\nsixteen missing galleys of Doria’s fleet, and fell upon it with fresh\r\nforce. This decided the action. The Genoese gained a complete victory,\r\ncapturing all but a few of the Venetian galleys, and including the\r\nflagship with Dandolo. The Genoese themselves lost heavily, especially\r\nin the early part of the action, and Lamba Doria’s eldest son Octavian\r\nis said to have fallen on board his father’s vessel.[19] The number of\r\nprisoners taken was over 7000, and among these was Marco Polo.[20]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marco Polo’s Galley going into action at Curzola.\r\n\r\n  ... “=il sembloit que la galie volast, par les nageurs qui la\r\n  contreingnoient aux avirons, et sembloit que foudre cheist des ciex,\r\n  au bruit que les pennonciaus menoient; et que les nacaires les tabours\r\n  et les cors sarrazinnois menoient, qui estoient en sa galie.=”\r\n\r\n  (_Joinville_, vide _ante_, p. 40.)]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, even of the highest rank, appear to have been chained.\r\nDandolo, in despair at his defeat, and at the prospect of being carried\r\ncaptive into Genoa, refused food, and ended by dashing his head against\r\na bench.[21] A Genoese account asserts that a noble funeral was given\r\nhim after the arrival of the fleet at Genoa, which took place on the\r\nevening of the 16th October.[22] It was received with great rejoicing,\r\nand the City voted the annual presentation of a pallium of gold brocade\r\nto the altar of the Virgin in the Church of St. Matthew, on every\r\n8th of September, the Madonna’s day, on the eve of which the Battle\r\nhad been won. To the admiral himself a Palace was decreed. It still\r\nstands, opposite the Church of St. Matthew, though it has passed from\r\nthe possession of the Family. On the striped marble façades, both of\r\nthe Church and of the Palace, inscriptions of that age, in excellent\r\npreservation, still commemorate Lamba’s achievement.[23] Malik al\r\nMansúr, the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, as an enemy of Venice, sent a\r\ncomplimentary letter to Doria accompanied by costly presents.[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene of the Battle of Curzola.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Church of San Matteo, Genoa.]\r\n\r\nThe latter died at Savona 17th October, 1323, a few months before\r\nthe most illustrious of his prisoners, and his bones were laid in a\r\nsarcophagus which may still be seen forming the sill of one of the\r\nwindows of S. Matteo (on the right as you enter). Over this sarcophagus\r\nstood the Bust of Lamba till 1797, when the mob of Genoa, in idiotic\r\nimitation of the French proceedings of that age, threw it down. All\r\nof Lamba’s six sons had fought with him at Meloria. In 1291 one of\r\nthem, Tedisio, went forth into the Atlantic in company with Ugolino\r\nVivaldi on a voyage of discovery, and never returned. Through Cæsar,\r\nthe youngest, this branch of the Family still survives, bearing the\r\ndistinctive surname of _Lamba-Doria_.[25]\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of the prisoners, accounts differ; a thing usual in\r\nsuch cases. The Genoese Poet asserts that the hearts of his countrymen\r\nwere touched, and that the captives were treated with compassionate\r\ncourtesy. Navagiero the Venetian, on the other hand, declares that most\r\nof them died of hunger.[26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marco Polo in prison dictates his book to Rusticiano of\r\nPisa. Release of Venetian prisoners.]\r\n\r\n36. Howsoever they may have been treated, here was Marco Polo one of\r\nthose many thousand prisoners in Genoa; and here, before long, he\r\nappears to have made acquaintance with a man of literary propensities,\r\nwhose destiny had brought him into the like plight, by name RUSTICIANO\r\nor RUSTICHELLO of Pisa. It was this person perhaps who persuaded\r\nthe Traveller to defer no longer the reduction to writing of his\r\nnotable experiences; but in any case it was he who wrote down those\r\nexperiences at Marco’s dictation; it is he therefore to whom we owe the\r\npreservation of this record, and possibly even that of the Traveller’s\r\nvery memory. This makes the Genoese imprisonment so important an\r\nepisode in Polo’s biography.\r\n\r\nTo Rusticiano we shall presently recur. But let us first bring to\r\na conclusion what may be gathered as to the duration of Polo’s\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear whether Pope Boniface made any new effort for\r\naccommodation between the Republics; but other Italian princes did\r\ninterpose, and Matteo Visconti, Captain-General of Milan, styling\r\nhimself Vicar-General of the Holy Roman Empire in Lombardy, was\r\naccepted as Mediator, along with the community of Milan. Ambassadors\r\nfrom both States presented themselves at that city, and on the 25th\r\nMay, 1299, they signed the terms of a Peace.\r\n\r\nThese terms were perfectly honourable to Venice, being absolutely\r\nequal and reciprocal; from which one is apt to conclude that the\r\ndamage to the City of the Sea was rather to her pride than to her\r\npower; the success of Genoa, in fact, having been followed up by no\r\nsystematic attack upon Venetian commerce.[27] Among the terms was the\r\nmutual release of prisoners on a day to be fixed by Visconti after the\r\ncompletion of all formalities. This day is not recorded, but as the\r\nTreaty was ratified by the Doge of Venice on the 1st July, and the\r\nlatest extant document connected with the formalities appears to be\r\ndated 18th July, we may believe that before the end of August Marco\r\nPolo was restored to the family mansion in S. Giovanni Grisostomo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grounds on which the story of Marco Polo’s capture at\r\nCurzola rests.]\r\n\r\n37. Something further requires to be said before quitting this event in\r\nour Traveller’s life. For we confess that a critical reader may have\r\nsome justification in asking what evidence there is that Marco Polo\r\never fought at Curzola, and ever was carried a prisoner to Genoa from\r\nthat unfortunate action?\r\n\r\nA learned Frenchman, whom we shall have to quote freely in the\r\nimmediately ensuing pages, does not venture to be more precise in\r\nreference to the meeting of Polo and Rusticiano than to say of the\r\nlatter: “In 1298, being in durance in the Prison of Genoa, he there\r\nbecame acquainted with Marco Polo, whom the Genoese had deprived of his\r\nliberty _from motives equally unknown_.”[28]\r\n\r\nTo those who have no relish for biographies that round the meagre\r\nskeleton of authentic facts with a plump padding of what _might have\r\nbeen_, this sentence of Paulin Paris is quite refreshing in its stern\r\nlimitation to positive knowledge. And certainly no contemporary\r\nauthority has yet been found for the capture of our Traveller at\r\nCurzola. Still I think that the fact is beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nRamusio’s biographical notices certainly contain many errors of detail;\r\nand some, such as the many years’ interval which he sets between the\r\nBattle of Curzola and Marco’s return, are errors which a very little\r\ntrouble would have enabled him to eschew. But still it does seem\r\nreasonable to believe that the main fact of Marco’s command of a galley\r\nat Curzola, and capture there, was derived from a genuine tradition, if\r\nnot from documents.\r\n\r\nLet us then turn to the words which close Rusticiano’s preamble (see\r\n_post_, p. 2):—“Lequel (Messire Marc) puis demorant en le charthre de\r\nJene, fist retraire toutes cestes chouses a Messire Rustacians de Pise\r\nque en celle meissme charthre estoit, au tens qu’il avoit 1298 anz que\r\nJezu eut vesqui.” These words are at least thoroughly consistent with\r\nMarco’s capture at Curzola, as regards both the position in which they\r\npresent him, and the year in which he is thus presented.\r\n\r\nThere is however another piece of evidence, though it is curiously\r\nindirect.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican Friar Jacopo of Acqui was a contemporary of Polo’s,\r\nand was the author of a somewhat obscure Chronicle called _Imago\r\nMundi_.[29] Now this Chronicle does contain mention of Marco’s capture\r\nin action by the Genoese, but attributes it to a different action\r\nfrom Curzola, and one fought at a time when Polo could not have been\r\npresent. The passage runs as follows in a manuscript of the Ambrosian\r\nLibrary, according to an extract given by Baldelli Boni:—\r\n\r\n  “In the year of Christ MCCLXXXXVI, in the time of Pope Boniface\r\n  VI., of whom we have spoken above, a battle was fought in Arminia,\r\n  at the place called Layaz, between xv. galleys of Genoese merchants\r\n  and xxv. of Venetian merchants; and after a great fight the galleys\r\n  of the Venetians were beaten, and (the crews) all slain or taken;\r\n  and among them was taken Messer Marco the Venetian, who was in\r\n  company with those merchants, and who was called _Milono_, which\r\n  is as much as to say ‘a thousand thousand pounds,’ for so goes\r\n  the phrase in Venice. So this Messer Marco Milono the Venetian,\r\n  with the other Venetian prisoners, is carried off to the prison\r\n  of Genoa, and there kept for a long time. This Messer Marco was a\r\n  long time with his father and uncle in Tartary, and he there saw\r\n  many things, and made much wealth, and also learned many things,\r\n  for he was a man of ability. And so, being in prison at Genoa,\r\n  he made a Book concerning the great wonders of the World, _i.e._,\r\n  concerning such of them as he had seen. And what he told in the\r\n  Book was not as much as he had really seen, because of the tongues\r\n  of detractors, who, being ready to impose their own lies on others,\r\n  are over hasty to set down as lies what they in their perversity\r\n  disbelieve, or do not understand. And because there are many great\r\n  and strange things in that Book, which are reckoned past all\r\n  credence, he was asked by his friends on his death-bed to correct\r\n  the Book by removing everything that went beyond the facts. To\r\n  which his reply was that he had not told _one-half_ of what he had\r\n  really seen!”[30]\r\n\r\nThis statement regarding the capture of Marco _at the Battle of\r\nAyas_ is one which cannot be true, for we know that he did not reach\r\nVenice till 1295, travelling from Persia by way of Trebizond and the\r\nBosphorus, whilst the Battle of Ayas of which we have purposely given\r\nsome detail, was fought in May, 1294. The date MCCLXXXXVI assigned\r\nto it in the preceding extract has given rise to some unprofitable\r\ndiscussion. Could that date be accepted, no doubt it would enable us\r\nalso to accept this, the sole statement from the Traveller’s own age\r\nof the circumstances which brought him into a Genoese prison; it would\r\nenable us to place that imprisonment within a few months of his return\r\nfrom the East, and to extend its duration to three years, points which\r\nwould thus accord better with the general tenor of Ramusio’s tradition\r\nthan the capture of Curzola. But the matter is not open to such a\r\nsolution. The date of the Battle of Ayas is not more doubtful than that\r\nof the Battle of the Nile. It is clearly stated by several independent\r\nchroniclers, and is carefully established in the Ballad that we have\r\nquoted above.[31] We shall see repeatedly in the course of this Book\r\nhow uncertain are the transcriptions of dates in Roman numerals, and in\r\nthe present case the LXXXXVI is as certainly a mistake for LXXXXIV as\r\nis Boniface VI. in the same quotation a mistake for Boniface VIII.\r\n\r\nBut though we cannot accept the statement that Polo was taken prisoner\r\nat _Ayas, in the spring of 1294_, we may accept the passage as evidence\r\nfrom a contemporary source that he was _taken prisoner in some\r\nsea-fight with the Genoese_, and thus admit it in corroboration of the\r\nRamusian Tradition of his capture in a sea-fight at Curzola in 1298,\r\nwhich is perfectly consistent with all other facts in our possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] In this part of these notices I am repeatedly indebted to _Heyd._\r\n    (See _supra_, p. 9.)\r\n\r\n[2] On or close to the Hill called _Monjoie_; see the plan from Marino\r\n    Sanudo at p. 18.\r\n\r\n[3] “Throughout that year there were not less than 40 machines all at\r\n    work upon the city of Acre, battering its houses and its towers,\r\n    and smashing and overthrowing everything within their range.\r\n    There were at least ten of those engines that shot stones so big\r\n    and heavy that they weighed a good 1500 lbs. by the weight of\r\n    Champagne; insomuch that nearly all the towers and forts of Acre\r\n    were destroyed, and only the religious houses were left.

The\r\n    gallant defence of the place against the Algerines in 1571 won\r\n    for Curzola from the Venetian Senate the honourable title in all\r\n    documents of _fedelissima_.

But this was\r\n    before the return of the travellers from the East, and just after\r\n    the battle of Ayas. (_Romanin_, ii. 332; this author misdates Ayas,\r\n    however.) When a levy was required in Venice for any expedition\r\n    the heads of each _contrada_ divided the male inhabitants, between\r\n    the ages of twenty and sixty, into groups of twelve each, called\r\n    _duodene_. The dice were thrown to decide who should go first on\r\n    service. He who went received five _lire_ a month from the State,\r\n    and one _lira_ from each of his colleagues in the _duodena_. Hence\r\n    his pay was sixteen _lire_ a month, about 2_s._ a day in silver\r\n    value, if these were _lire ai grossi_, or 1_s._ 4_d._ if _lire dei\r\n    piccoli_. (See _Romanin_, ii. 393–394.)\r\n\r\n    Money on such occasions was frequently raised by what was called an\r\n    _Estimo_ or _Facion_, which was a force loan levied on the citizens\r\n    in proportion to their estimated wealth; and for which they were\r\n    entitled to interest from the State.\r\n\r\n[17] Several of the Italian chroniclers, as Ferreto of Vicenza and\r\n    Navagiero, whom Muratori has followed in his “Annals,” say the\r\n    battle was fought on the 8th September, the so-called Birthday of\r\n    the Madonna. But the inscription on the Church of St. Matthew at\r\n    Genoa, cited further on, says the 7th, and with this agree both\r\n    Stella and the Genoese poet. For the latter, though not specifying\r\n    the day of the month, says it was on a Sunday:—\r\n\r\n        “Lo di de Domenga era\r\n          Passa prima en l’ora bona\r\n          Stormezam fin provo nona\r\n         Con bataio forte e fera.”\r\n\r\n    Now the 7th September, 1298, fell on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n[18]\r\n\r\n        _Ma li pensavam grande error\r\n          Che in fuga se fussem tuti metui\r\n          Che de si lonzi eram vegnui\r\n        Per cerchali a casa lor._\r\n\r\n[19] “Note here that the Genoese generally, commonly, and by nature,\r\n    are the most covetous of Men, and the Love of Gain spurs them to\r\n    every Crime. Yet are they deemed also the most valiant Men in the\r\n    World. Such an one was Lampa, of that very Doria family, a man\r\n    of an high Courage truly. For when he was engaged in a Sea-Fight\r\n    against the Venetians, and was standing on the Poop of his Galley,\r\n    his Son, fighting valiantly at the Forecastle, was shot by an Arrow\r\n    in the Breast, and fell wounded to the Death; a Mishap whereat\r\n    his Comrades were sorely shaken, and Fear came upon the whole\r\n    Ship’s Company. But Lampa, hot with the Spirit of Battle, and more\r\n    mindful of his Country’s Service and his own Glory than of his Son,\r\n    ran forward to the spot, loftily rebuked the agitated Crowd, and\r\n    ordered his Son’s Body to be cast into the Deep, telling them for\r\n    their Comfort that the Land could never have afforded his Boy a\r\n    nobler Tomb. And then, renewing the Fight more fiercely than ever,\r\n    he achieved the Victory.” (_Benvenuto of Imola_, in _Comment. on\r\n    Dante, in Muratori, Antiq._ i. 1146.)\r\n\r\n        (“Yet like an English General will I die,\r\n            And all the Ocean make my spacious Grave;\r\n          Women and Cowards on the Land may lie,\r\n            The Sea’s the Tomb that’s proper for the Brave!”\r\n                                                  —_Annus Mirabilis_.)\r\n\r\n[20] The particulars of the battle are gathered from _Ferretus\r\n    Vicentinus_, in _Murat._ ix. 985 _seqq._; _And. Dandulo_, in xii.\r\n    407–408; _Navagiero_, in xxiii. 1009–1010; and the Genoese Poem as\r\n    before.\r\n\r\n[21] _Navagiero_, u.s. Dandulo says, “after a few days he died of\r\n    grief”; Ferretus, that he was killed in the action and buried at\r\n    Curzola.\r\n\r\n[22] For the funeral, a MS. of Cibo Recco quoted by _Jacopo Doria_ in\r\n    _La Chiesa di San Matteo descritta_, etc., Genova, 1860, p. 26. For\r\n    the date of arrival the poem so often quoted:—\r\n\r\n        “_De Oitover_, a zoia, _a seze di_\r\n           Lo nostro ostel, con gran festa\r\n           En nostro porto, a or di sesta\r\n         Domine De restitui.”\r\n\r\n[23] S. Matteo was built by Martin Doria in 1125, but pulled down\r\n    and rebuilt by the family in a slightly different position in\r\n    1278. On this occasion is recorded a remarkable anticipation of\r\n    the feats of American engineering: “As there was an ancient and\r\n    very fine picture of Christ upon the apse of the Church, it was\r\n    thought a great pity that so fine a work should be destroyed. And\r\n    so they contrived an ingenious method by which the apse bodily was\r\n    transported without injury, picture and all, for a distance of 25\r\n    ells, and firmly set upon the foundations where it now exists.”\r\n    (_Jacopo de Varagine_ in _Muratori_, vol. ix. 36.)\r\n\r\n    The inscription on S. Matteo regarding the battle is as\r\n    follows:—“_Ad Honorem Dei et Beate Virginis Marie Anno MCCLXXXXVIII\r\n    Die Dominico VII Septembris iste Angelus captus fuit in Gulfo\r\n    Venetiarum in Civitate Scursole et ibidem fuit prelium Galearum\r\n    LXXVI Januensium cum Galeis LXXXXVI Veneciarum.

Musulm._ ix. 217.\r\n\r\n[25] _Jacopo Doria_, p. 280.\r\n\r\n[26] _Murat._ xxiii. 1010. I learn from a Genoese gentleman, through\r\n    my friend Professor Henry Giglioli (to whose kindness I owe the\r\n    transcript of the inscription just given), that a faint tradition\r\n    exists as to the place of our traveller’s imprisonment. It is\r\n    alleged to have been a massive building, standing between the\r\n    _Grazie_ and the Mole, and bearing the name of the _Malapaga_,\r\n    which is now a barrack for Doganieri, but continued till\r\n    comparatively recent times to be used as a civil prison. “It is\r\n    certain,” says my informant, “that men of fame in arms who had\r\n    fallen into the power of the Genoese _were_ imprisoned there, and\r\n    among others is recorded the name of the Corsican Giudice dalla\r\n    Rocca and Lord of Cinarca, who died there in 1312;” a date so\r\n    near that of Marco’s imprisonment as to give some interest to the\r\n    hypothesis, slender as are its grounds. Another Genoese, however,\r\n    indicates as the scene of Marco’s captivity certain old prisons\r\n    near the Old Arsenal, in a site still known as the _Vico degli\r\n    Schiavi_. (_Celesia, Dante in Liguria_, 1865, p. 43.) [Was not the\r\n    place of Polo’s captivity the basement of the _Palazzo del Capitan\r\n    del Popolo_, afterwards _Palazzo del Comune al Mare_, where the\r\n    Customs (_Dogana_) had their office, and from the 15th century the\r\n    _Casa_ or _Palazzo di S. Giorgio?_—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[27] The Treaty and some subsidiary documents are printed in the\r\n    Genoese _Liber Jurium_, forming a part of the _Monumenta Historiae\r\n    Patriae_, published at Turin. (See _Lib. Jur._ II. 344, _seqq._)\r\n    Muratori in his Annals has followed John Villani (Bk. VIII. ch. 27)\r\n    in representing the terms as highly unfavourable to Venice. But for\r\n    this there is no foundation in the documents. And the terms are\r\n    stated with substantial accuracy in Navagiero. (_Murat. Script._\r\n    xxiii. 1011.)\r\n\r\n[28] _Paulin Paris, Les Manuscrits François de la Bibliothèque du Roi_,\r\n    ii. 355.\r\n\r\n[29] Though there is no precise information as to the birth or death\r\n    of this writer, who belonged to a noble family of Lombardy, the\r\n    Bellingeri, he can be traced with tolerable certainty as in life in\r\n    1289, 1320, and 1334. (See the Introduction to his Chronicle in the\r\n    Turin _Monumentà_, _Scriptores_ III.)\r\n\r\n[30] There is another MS. of the _Imago Mundi_ at Turin, which has\r\n    been printed in the _Monumenta_. The passage about Polo in that\r\n    copy differs widely in wording, is much shorter, and contains no\r\n    date. But it relates his capture as having taken place at _Là\r\n    Glazà_, which I think there can be no doubt is also intended for\r\n    Ayas (sometimes called _Giàzza_), a place which in fact is called\r\n    _Glaza_ in three of the MSS. of which various readings are given in\r\n    the edition of the Société de Géographie (p. 535).\r\n\r\n[31]\r\n\r\n        “_E per meio esse aregordenti\r\n           De si grande scacho mato\r\n         Correa mille duxenti\r\n           Zonto ge novanta e quatro._”\r\n\r\nThe Armenian Prince Hayton or Héthum has put it under 1293.

RUSTICIANO OR RUSTICHELLO OF PISA, MARCO POLO’S FELLOW-PRISONER\r\n         AT GENOA, THE SCRIBE WHO WROTE DOWN THE TRAVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. We have now to say something of that Rusticiano to whom all who\r\nvalue Polo’s book are so much indebted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rusticiano, perhaps a prisoner from Meloria.]\r\n\r\nThe relations between Genoa and Pisa had long been so hostile that it\r\nwas only too natural in 1298 to find a Pisan in the gaol of Genoa. An\r\nunhappy multitude of such prisoners had been carried thither fourteen\r\nyears before, and the survivors still lingered there in vastly dwindled\r\nnumbers. In the summer of 1284 was fought the battle from which Pisa\r\nhad to date the commencement of her long decay. In July of that year\r\nthe Pisans, at a time when the Genoese had no fleet in their own\r\nimmediate waters, had advanced to the very port of Genoa and shot their\r\ndefiance into the proud city in the form of silver-headed arrows, and\r\nstones belted with scarlet.[1] They had to pay dearly for this insult.\r\nThe Genoese, recalling their cruisers, speedily mustered a fleet of\r\neighty-eight galleys, which were placed under the command of another of\r\nthat illustrious House of Doria, the Scipios of Genoa as they have been\r\ncalled, Uberto, the elder brother of Lamba. Lamba himself with his six\r\nsons, and another brother, was in the fleet, whilst the whole number of\r\nDorias who fought in the ensuing action amounted to 250, most of them\r\non board one great galley bearing the name of the family patron, St.\r\nMatthew.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Pisans, more than one-fourth inferior in strength, came out boldly,\r\nand the battle was fought off the Porto Pisano, in fact close in front\r\nof Leghorn, where a lighthouse on a remarkable arched basement still\r\nmarks the islet of MELORIA, whence the battle got its name. The day\r\nwas the 6th of August, the feast of St. Sixtus, a day memorable in\r\nthe Pisan Fasti for several great victories. But on this occasion the\r\ndefeat of Pisa was overwhelming. Forty of their galleys were taken or\r\nsunk, and upwards of 9000 prisoners carried to Genoa. In fact so vast\r\na sweep was made of the flower of Pisan manhood that it was a common\r\nsaying then: “_Che vuol veder Pisa, vada a Genova_!” Many noble ladies\r\nof Pisa went in large companies on foot to Genoa to seek their husbands\r\nor kinsmen: “And when they made enquiry of the Keepers of the Prisons,\r\nthe reply would be, ‘Yesterday there died thirty of them, to-day there\r\nhave died forty; all of whom we have cast into the sea; and so it is\r\ndaily.’”[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seal of the Pisan Prisoners.]\r\n\r\nA body of prisoners so numerous and important naturally exerted\r\nthemselves in the cause of peace, and through their efforts, after many\r\nmonths of negotiation, a formal peace was signed (15th April, 1288).\r\nBut through the influence, as was alleged, of Count Ugolino (Dante’s)\r\nwho was then in power at Pisa, the peace became abortive; war almost\r\nimmediately recommenced, and the prisoners had no release.[4] And,\r\nwhen the 6000 or 7000 Venetians were thrown into the prisons of Genoa\r\nin October 1298, they would find there the scanty surviving remnant\r\nof the Pisan Prisoners of Meloria, and would gather from them dismal\r\nforebodings of the fate before them.\r\n\r\nIt is a fair conjecture that to that remnant Rusticiano of Pisa may\r\nhave belonged.\r\n\r\nWe have seen Ramusio’s representation of the kindness shown to Marco\r\nduring his imprisonment by a certain Genoese gentleman who also\r\nassisted him to reduce his travels to writing. We may be certain\r\nthat this Genoese gentleman is only a distorted image of Rusticiano,\r\nthe Pisan prisoner in the gaol of Genoa, whose name and part in the\r\nhistory of his hero’s book Ramusio so strangely ignores. Yet patriotic\r\nGenoese writers in our own times have striven to determine the identity\r\nof this their imaginary countryman![5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rusticiano, a person known from other sources.]\r\n\r\n39. Who, then, was Rusticiano, or, as the name actually is read in the\r\noldest type of MS., “Messire Rustacians de Pise”?\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of him is but scanty. Still something is known of him\r\nbesides the few words concluding his preamble to our Traveller’s Book,\r\nwhich you may read at pp. 1–2 of the body of this volume.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Walter Scott’s “Essay on Romance,” when he speaks of the new\r\nmould in which the subjects of the old metrical stories were cast by\r\nthe school of prose romancers which arose in the 13th century, we find\r\nthe following words:—\r\n\r\n  “Whatever fragments or shadows of true history may yet remain\r\n  hidden under the mass of accumulated fable which had been heaped\r\n  upon them during successive ages, must undoubtedly be sought in\r\n  the metrical romances.... But those prose authors who wrote under\r\n  the imaginary names of RUSTICIEN DE PISE, Robert de Borron, and\r\n  the like, usually seized upon the subject of some old minstrel;\r\n  and recomposing the whole narrative after their own fashion, with\r\n  additional character and adventure, totally obliterated in that\r\n  operation any shades which remained of the original and probably\r\n  authentic tradition,” &c.[6]\r\n\r\nEvidently, therefore, Sir Walter regarded Rustician of Pisa as a person\r\nbelonging to the same ghostly company as his own Cleishbothams and\r\nDryasdusts. But in this we see that he was wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the great Paris Library and elsewhere there are manuscript volumes\r\ncontaining the stories of the Round Table abridged and somewhat\r\nclumsily combined from the various Prose Romances of that cycle,\r\nsuch as _Sir Tristan_, _Lancelot_, _Palamedes_, _Giron le Courtois_,\r\n&c., which had been composed, it would seem, by various Anglo-French\r\ngentlemen at the court of Henry III., styled, or styling themselves,\r\nGasses le Blunt, Luces du Gast, Robert de Borron, and Hélis de Borron.\r\nAnd these abridgments or recasts are professedly the work of _Le\r\nMaistre Rusticien de Pise_. Several of them were printed at Paris in\r\nthe end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries as the works of\r\nRusticien de Pise; and as the preambles and the like, especially in the\r\nform presented in those printed editions, appear to be due sometimes to\r\nthe original composers (as Robert and Hélis de Borron) and sometimes to\r\nRusticien de Pise the recaster, there would seem to have been a good\r\ndeal of confusion made in regard to their respective personalities.\r\n\r\nFrom a preamble to one of those compilations which undoubtedly belongs\r\nto Rustician, and which we shall quote at length by and bye, we learn\r\nthat Master Rustician “translated” (or perhaps _transferred?_) his\r\ncompilation from a book belonging to King Edward of England, at the\r\ntime when that prince went beyond seas to recover the Holy Sepulchre.\r\nNow Prince Edward started for the Holy Land in 1270, spent the winter\r\nof that year in Sicily, and arrived in Palestine in May 1271. He\r\nquitted it again in August, 1272, and passed again by Sicily, where in\r\nJanuary, 1273, he heard of his father’s death and his own consequent\r\naccession. Paulin Paris supposes that Rustician was attached to the\r\nSicilian Court of Charles of Anjou, and that Edward “may have deposited\r\nwith that king the Romances of the Round Table, of which all the\r\nworld was talking, but the manuscripts of which were still very rare,\r\nespecially those of the work of Helye de Borron[7] ... whether by\r\norder, or only with permission of the King of Sicily, our Rustician\r\nmade haste to read, abridge, and re-arrange the whole, and when Edward\r\nreturned to Sicily he recovered possession of the book from which the\r\nindefatigable Pisan had extracted the contents.”\r\n\r\nBut this I believe is, in so far as it passes the facts stated in\r\nRustician’s own preamble, pure hypothesis, for nothing is cited that\r\nconnects Rustician with the King of Sicily. And if there be not some\r\nsuch confusion of personality as we have alluded to, in another of the\r\npreambles, which is quoted by Dunlop as an utterance of Rustician’s,\r\nthat personage would seem to claim to have been a comrade in arms of\r\nthe two de Borrons. We might, therefore, conjecture that Rustician\r\nhimself had accompanied Prince Edward to Syria.[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Rustician’s Romance compilations.]\r\n\r\n40. Rustician’s literary work appears from the extracts and remarks of\r\nPaulin Paris to be that of an industrious simple man, without method\r\nor much judgment. “The haste with which he worked is too perceptible;\r\nthe adventures are told without connection; you find long stories of\r\nTristan followed by adventures of his father Meliadus.” For the latter\r\nderangement of historical sequence we find a quaint and ingenuous\r\napology offered in Rustician’s epilogue to Giron le Courtois:—\r\n\r\n  “Cy fine le Maistre Rusticien de Pise son conte en louant et\r\n  regraciant le Père le Filz et le Saint Esperit, et ung mesme Dieu,\r\n  Filz de la Benoiste Vierge Marie, de ce qu’il m’a doné grace, sens,\r\n  force, et mémoire, temps et lieu, de me mener à fin de si haulte\r\n  et si noble matière come ceste-cy dont j’ay traicté les faiz et\r\n  proesses recitez et recordez à mon livre. Et se aucun me demandoit\r\n  pour quoy j’ay parlé de Tristan avant que de son père le Roy\r\n  Meliadus, je respons que ma matière n’estoist pas congneue. Car je\r\n  ne puis pas scavoir tout, ne mettre toutes mes paroles par ordre.\r\n  Et ainsi fine mon conte. Amen.”[9]\r\n\r\nIn a passage of these compilations the Emperor Charlemagne is asked\r\nwhether in his judgment King Meliadus or his son Tristan were the\r\nbetter man? The Emperor’s answer is: “I should say that the King\r\nMeliadus was the better man, and I will tell you why I say so. As far\r\nas I can see, everything that Tristan did was done for Love, and his\r\ngreat feats would never have been done but under the constraint of\r\nLove, which was his spur and goad. Now that never can be said of King\r\nMeliadus! For what deeds he did, he did them not by dint of Love, but\r\nby dint of his strong right arm. Purely out of his own goodness he\r\ndid good, and not by constraint of Love.” “It will be seen,” remarks\r\non this Paulin Paris, “that we are here a long way removed from the\r\nordinary principles of Round Table Romances. And one thing besides will\r\nbe manifest, viz., that Rusticien de Pise was no Frenchman!”[10]\r\n\r\nThe same discretion is shown even more prominently in a passage of one\r\nof his compilations, which contains the romances of Arthur, Gyron, and\r\nMeliadus (No. 6975—see last note but one):—\r\n\r\n  “No doubt,” Rustician says, “other books tell the story of the\r\n  Queen Ginevra and Lancelot differently from this; and there were\r\n  certain passages between them of which the Master, in his concern\r\n  for the honour of both those personages, will say not a word.”\r\n  Alas, says the French Bibliographer, that the copy of Lancelot,\r\n  which fell into the hands of poor Francesca of Rimini, was not one\r\n  of those _expurgated_ by our worthy friend Rustician![11]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Identity of the Romance Compiler with Polo’s\r\nfellow-prisoner.]\r\n\r\n41. A question may still occur to an attentive reader as to the\r\nidentity of this Romance-compiler Rusticien de Pise with the Messire\r\n_Rustacians de Pise_, of a solitary MS. of Polo’s work (though the\r\noldest and most authentic), a name which appears in other copies as\r\n_Rusta Pisan_, _Rasta Pysan_, _Rustichelus Civis Pisanus_, _Rustico_,\r\n_Restazio da Pisa_, _Stazio da Pisa_, and who is stated in the preamble\r\nto have acted as the Traveller’s scribe at Genoa.\r\n\r\nM. Pauthier indeed[12] asserts that the French of the MS. Romances\r\nof Rusticien de Pise is of the same barbarous character as that of\r\nthe early French MS. of Polo’s Book to which we have just alluded,\r\nand which we shall show to be the nearest presentation of the work as\r\noriginally dictated by the Traveller. The language of the latter MS. is\r\nso peculiar that this would be almost perfect evidence of the identity\r\nof the writers, if it were really the fact. A cursory inspection which\r\nI have made of two of those MSS. in Paris, and the extracts which\r\nI have given and am about to give, do not, however, by any means\r\nsupport M. Pauthier’s view. Nor would that view be consistent with the\r\njudgment of so competent an authority as Paulin Paris, implied in his\r\ncalling Rustician a _nom recommandable_ in old French literature, and\r\nhis speaking of him as “versed in the secrets of the French Romance\r\nTongue.”[13] In fact the difference of language in the two cases would\r\nreally be a difficulty in the way of identification, if there were room\r\nfor doubt. This, however, Paulin Paris seems to have excluded finally,\r\nby calling attention to the peculiar formula of preamble which is\r\ncommon to the Book of Marco Polo and to one of the Romance compilations\r\nof Rusticien de Pise.\r\n\r\nThe former will be found in English at pp. 1, 2, of our Translation;\r\nbut we give a part of the original below[14] for comparison with the\r\npreamble to the Romances of Meliadus, Tristan, and Lancelot, as taken\r\nfrom MS. 6961 (Fr. 340) of the Paris Library:—\r\n\r\n  “_Seigneurs Empereurs et Princes, Ducs et Contes et Barons et\r\n  Chevaliers et Vavasseurs et Bourgeois, et tous les preudommes de\r\n  cestui monde qui avez talent de vous deliter en rommans, si prenez\r\n  cestui (livre) et le faites lire de chief en chief, si orrez toutes\r\n  les grans aventure_ qui advindrent entre les Chevaliers errans\r\n  du temps au Roy Uter Pendragon, jusques à le temps au Roy Artus\r\n  son fils, et des compaignons de la Table Ronde. Et sachiez tout\r\n  vraiment que cist livres fust translatez du livre Monseigneur\r\n  Edouart le Roy d’Engleterre en cellui temps qu’il passa oultre la\r\n  mer au service nostre Seigneur Damedieu pour conquester le Sant\r\n  Sepulcre, et Maistre Rusticiens de Pise, lequel est ymaginez yci\r\n  dessus,[15] compila ce rommant, car il en translata toutes les\r\n  merveilleuses nouvelles et aventures qu’il trouva en celle livre\r\n  et traita tout certainement de toutes les aventures du monde, et\r\n  si sachiez qu’il traitera plus de Monseigneur Lancelot du Lac, et\r\n  Monsʳ Tristan le fils au Roy Meliadus de Leonnoie que d’autres,\r\n  porcequ’ilz furent sans faille les meilleurs chevaliers qui à ce\r\n  temps furent en terre; et li Maistres en dira de ces deux pluseurs\r\n  choses et pluseurs nouvelles que l’en treuvera escript en tous les\r\n  autres livres; et porce que le Maistres les trouva escript au Livre\r\n  d’Engleterre.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palazzo di S. Giorgio Genoa.]\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Paulin Paris observes, “there is a singular analogy\r\nbetween these two prefaces. And it must be remarked that the formula is\r\nnot an ordinary one with translators, compilers, or authors of the 13th\r\nand 14th centuries. Perhaps you would not find a single other example\r\nof it.”[16]\r\n\r\nThis seems to place beyond question the identity of the\r\nRomance-compiler of Prince Edward’s suite in 1270, and the Prisoner of\r\nGenoa in 1298.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further particulars concerning Rustician.]\r\n\r\n42. In Dunlop’s History of Fiction a passage is quoted from the\r\npreamble of _Meliadus_, as set forth in the Paris printed edition of\r\n1528, which gives us to understand that Rusticien de Pise had received\r\nas a reward for some of his compositions from King Henry III. the\r\nprodigal gift of two _chateaux_. I gather, however, from passages in\r\nthe work of Paulin Paris that this must certainly be one of those\r\nconfusions of persons to which I have referred before, and that the\r\nrecipient of the chateaux was in reality Helye de Borron, the author of\r\nsome of the originals which Rustician manipulated.[17] This supposed\r\nincident in Rustician’s scanty history must therefore be given up.\r\n\r\nWe call this worthy _Rustician_ or _Rusticiano_, as the nearest\r\nprobable representation in Italian form of the _Rusticien_ of the\r\nRound-Table MSS. and the _Rustacians_ of the old text of Polo. But\r\nit is highly probable that his real name was _Rustichello_, as is\r\nsuggested by the form _Rustichelus_ in the early Latin version\r\npublished by the _Société de Géographie_. The change of one liquid for\r\nanother never goes for much in Italy,[18] and Rustichello might easily\r\nGallicize himself as Rusticien. In a very long list of Pisan officials\r\nduring the Middle Ages I find several bearing the name of _Rustichello_\r\nor _Rustichelli_, but no _Rusticiano_ or _Rustigiano_.[19]\r\n\r\nRespecting him we have only to add that the peace between Genoa and\r\nVenice was speedily followed by a treaty between Genoa and Pisa. On the\r\n31st July, 1299, a truce for twenty-five years was signed between those\r\ntwo Republics. It was a very different matter from that between Genoa\r\nand Venice, and contained much that was humiliating and detrimental to\r\nPisa. But it embraced the release of prisoners; and those of Meloria,\r\nreduced it is said to less than one tithe of their original number,\r\nhad their liberty at last. Among the prisoners then released no doubt\r\nRustician was one. But we hear of him no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] _B.

Jacopo D’Oria. Many of the\r\n    Baptismal names are curious, and show how far sponsors wandered\r\n    from the Church Calendar. _Assan, Alton, Turco, Soldan_ seem to\r\n    come of the constant interest in the East. _Alaone_, a name which\r\n    remained in the family for several generations, I had thought\r\n    certainly borrowed from the fierce conqueror of the Khalif\r\n    (_infra_, p. 63). But as one Alaone, present at this battle, had a\r\n    son also there, he must surely have been christened before the\r\n    fame of Hulaku could have reached Genoa. (See _La Chiesa di S.\r\n    Matteo_, pp. 250, _seqq._)\r\n\r\n    In documents of the kingdom of Jerusalem there are names still more\r\n    anomalous, _e.g._, _Gualterius Baffumeth_, _Joannes Mahomet_. (See\r\n    _Cod. Dipl. del Sac. Milit. Ord. Gerosol._ I. 2–3, 62.)\r\n\r\n[3] _Memorial. Potestat. Regiens._ in _Muratori_, viii. 1162.\r\n\r\n[4] See _Fragm. Hist.

The cut in the text represents\r\n    a striking memorial of those Pisan Prisoners, which perhaps\r\n    still survives, but which at any rate existed last century in a\r\n    collection at Lucca. It is the seal of the prisoners as a body\r\n    corporate: SIGILLUM UNIVERSITATIS CARCERATORUM PISANORUM JANUE\r\n    DETENTORUM, and was doubtless used in their negotiations for peace\r\n    with the Genoese Commissioners. It represents two of the prisoners\r\n    imploring the Madonna, Patron of the Duomo at Pisa. It is from\r\n    _Manni, Osserv. Stor. sopra Sigilli Antichi_, etc., Firenze, 1739,\r\n    tom. xii. The seal is also engraved in _Dal Borgo_, _op. cit._ ii.\r\n    316.\r\n\r\n[5] The Abate Spotorno in his _Storia Letteraria della Liguria_, II.\r\n    219, fixes on a Genoese philosopher called Andalo del Negro,\r\n    mentioned by Boccaccio.\r\n\r\n[6] I quote from Galignani’s ed. of Prose Works, v. 712. This has\r\n    “Rusticien de _Puise_.” In this view of the fictitious character of\r\n    the names of Rusticien and the rest, Sir Walter seems to have been\r\n    following Ritson, as I gather from a quotation in Dunlop’s H. of\r\n    Fiction. (_Liebrecht’s_ German Version, p. 63.)\r\n\r\n[7] _Giron le Courtois_, and the conclusion of _Tristan_.\r\n\r\n[8] The passage runs thus as quoted (from the preamble of the\r\n    _Meliadus_—I suspect in one of the old printed editions):—\r\n\r\n    “Aussi Luces du Gau (Gas) translata en langue Françoise une\r\n    partie de l’Hystoire de Monseigneur Tristan, et moins assez qu’il\r\n    ne deust. Moult commença bien son livre et si ny mist tout les\r\n    faicts de Tristan, ains la greigneur partie. Après s’en entremist\r\n    Messire Gasse le Blond, qui estoit parent au Roy Henry, et divisa\r\n    l’Hystoire de Lancelot du Lac, et d’autre chose ne parla il mye\r\n    grandement en son livre.

If this passage be\r\n    authentic it would set beyond doubt the age of the de Borrons and\r\n    the other writers of Anglo-French Round Table Romances, who are\r\n    placed by the _Hist. Littéraire de la France_, and apparently by\r\n    Fr. Michel, under Henry II. I have no means of pursuing the matter,\r\n    and have preferred to follow Paulin Paris, who places them under\r\n    Henry III. I notice, moreover, that the _Hist. Litt._ (xv. p. 498)\r\n    puts not only the de Borrons but Rustician himself under Henry II.;\r\n    and, as the last view is certainly an error, the first is probably\r\n    so too.\r\n\r\n[9] Transc. from MS. 6975 (now Fr. 355) of Paris Library.\r\n\r\n[10] _MSS.

A few very disconnected notices are all that can be collected of\r\nmatter properly biographical in relation to the quarter century during\r\nwhich Marco Polo survived the Genoese captivity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Marco’s Father before 1300. Will of his brother\r\nMaffeo.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that he would probably reach Venice in the course of\r\nAugust, 1299. Whether he found his aged father alive is not known; but\r\nwe know at least that a year later (31st August, 1300) Messer Nicolo\r\nwas no longer in life.\r\n\r\nThis we learn from the Will of the younger Maffeo, Marco’s brother,\r\nwhich bears the date just named, and of which we give an abstract\r\nbelow.[1] It seems to imply strong regard for the testator’s brother\r\nMarco, who is made inheritor of the bulk of the property, failing the\r\npossible birth of a son. I have already indicated some conjectural\r\ndeductions from this document. I may add that the terms of the second\r\nclause, as quoted in the note, seem to me to throw considerable doubt\r\non the genealogy which bestows a large family of sons upon this brother\r\nMaffeo. If he lived to have such a family it seems improbable that the\r\ndraft which he thus left in the hands of a notary, to be converted into\r\na Will in the event of his death (a curious example of the validity\r\nattaching to all acts of notaries in those days), should never have\r\nbeen superseded, but should actually have been so converted after his\r\ndeath, as the existence of the parchment seems to prove. But for this\r\ncircumstance we might suppose the Marcolino mentioned in the ensuing\r\nparagraph to have been a son of the younger Maffeo.\r\n\r\nMesser Maffeo, the uncle, was, we see, alive at this time. We do not\r\nknow the year of his death. But it is alluded to by Friar Pipino in the\r\nPreamble to his Translation of the Book, supposed to have been executed\r\nabout 1315–1320; and we learn from a document in the Venetian archives\r\n(see p. 77) that it must have been previous to 1318, and subsequent\r\nto February 1309, the date of his last Will. The Will itself is not\r\nknown to be extant, but from the reference to it in this document we\r\nlearn that he left 1000 _lire_ of public debt[2] (_? imprestitorum_)\r\nto a certain Marco Polo, called _Marcolino_. The relationship of this\r\nMarco to old Maffeo is not stated, but we may suspect him to have been\r\nan illegitimate son. [Marcolino was a son of Nicolo, son of Marco the\r\nElder; see vol. ii., _Calendar_, No. 6.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Documentary notices of Polo at this time. The sobriquet of\r\nMilione.]\r\n\r\n44. In 1302 occurs what was at first supposed to be a glimpse of\r\nMarco as a citizen, slight and quaint enough; being a resolution on\r\nthe Books of the Great Council to exempt the respectable Marco Polo\r\nfrom the penalty incurred by him on account of the omission to have\r\nhis water-pipe duly inspected. But since our Marco’s claims to the\r\ndesignation of _Nobilis Vir_ have been established, there is a doubt\r\nwhether the _providus vir_ or _prud’-homme_ here spoken of may not have\r\nbeen rather his namesake Marco Polo of Cannareggio or S. Geremia, of\r\nwhose existence we learn from another entry of the same year.[3] It is,\r\nhowever, possible that Marco the Traveller was called to the Great\r\nCouncil _after_ the date of the document in question.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Traveller, and after him his House and his Book,\r\nacquired from his contemporaries the surname, or nickname rather, of\r\n_Il Milione_. Different writers have given different explanations\r\nof the origin of this name; some, beginning with his contemporary\r\nFra Jacopo d’Acqui, (_supra_, p. _54_), ascribing it to the family’s\r\nhaving brought home a fortune of a million of _lire_, in fact to their\r\nbeing _millionaires_. This is the explanation followed by Sansovino,\r\nMarco Barbaro, Coronelli, and others.[4] More far-fetched is that of\r\nFontanini, who supposes the name to have been given to the Book as\r\ncontaining a great number of stories, like the _Cento Novelle_ or the\r\n_Thousand and One Nights!_ But there can be no doubt that Ramusio’s\r\nis the true, as it is the natural, explanation; and that the name was\r\nbestowed on Marco by the young wits of his native city, because of\r\nhis frequent use of a word which appears to have been then unusual,\r\nin his attempts to convey an idea of the vast wealth and magnificence\r\nof the Kaan’s Treasury and Court.[5] Ramusio has told us (_supra_, p.\r\n_6_) that he had seen Marco styled by this sobriquet in the Books of\r\nthe Signory; and it is pleasant to be able to confirm this by the next\r\ndocument which we cite. This is an extract from the Books of the Great\r\nCouncil under 10th April, 1305, condoning the offence of a certain\r\nBonocio of Mestre in smuggling wine, for whose penalty one of the\r\nsureties had been the NOBILIS VIR MARCHUS PAULO MILIONI.[6]\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that long after our Traveller’s death there was always,\r\nin the Venetian Masques, one individual who assumed the character of\r\nMarco Milioni, and told Munchausenlike stories to divert the vulgar.\r\nSuch, if this be true, was the honour of our prophet among the populace\r\nof his own country.[7]\r\n\r\n45. A little later we hear of Marco once more, as presenting a copy of\r\nhis Book to a noble Frenchman in the service of Charles of Valois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polo’s relations with Thibault de Cepoy.]\r\n\r\nThis Prince, brother of Philip the Fair, in 1301 had married Catharine,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Philip de Courtenay, titular Emperor of\r\nConstantinople, and on the strength of this marriage had at a later\r\ndate set up his own claim to the Empire of the East. To this he was\r\nprompted by Pope Clement V., who in the beginning of 1306 wrote to\r\nVenice, stimulating that Government to take part in the enterprise. In\r\nthe same year, Charles and his wife sent as their envoys to Venice, in\r\nconnection with this matter, a noble knight called THIBAULT DE CEPOY,\r\nalong with an ecclesiastic of Chartres called Pierre le Riche, and\r\nthese two succeeded in executing a treaty of alliance with Venice,\r\nof which the original, dated 14th December, 1306, exists at Paris.\r\nThibault de Cepoy eventually went on to Greece with a squadron of\r\nVenetian Galleys, but accomplished nothing of moment, and returned to\r\nhis master in 1310.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miracle of S. Lorenzo.]\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of Thibault at Venice he seems to have made\r\nacquaintance with Marco Polo, and to have received from him a copy\r\nof his Book. This is recorded in a curious note which appears on two\r\nexisting MSS. of Polo’s Book, viz., that of the Paris Library (10,270\r\nor Fr. 5649), and that of Bern, which is substantially identical in its\r\ntext with the former, and is, as I believe, a copy of it.[9] The note\r\nruns as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Here you have the Book of which My Lord THIEBAULT, Knight and LORD\r\n  OF CEPOY, (whom may God assoil!) requested a copy from SIRE MARC\r\n  POL, Burgess and Resident of the City of Venice. And the said Sire\r\n  Marc Pol, being a very honourable Person, of high character and\r\n  respect in many countries, because of his desire that what he had\r\n  witnessed should be known throughout the World, and also for the\r\n  honour and reverence he bore to the most excellent and puissant\r\n  Prince my Lord CHARLES, Son of the King of France and COUNT OF\r\n  VALOIS, gave and presented to the aforesaid Lord of Cepoy the first\r\n  copy (that was taken) of his said Book after he had made the same.\r\n  And very pleasing it was to him that his Book should be carried\r\n  to the noble country of France and there made known by so worthy\r\n  a gentleman. And from that copy which the said Messire Thibault,\r\n  Sire de Cepoy above-named, did carry into France, Messire John, who\r\n  was his eldest son and is the present Sire de Cepoy,[10] after his\r\n  Father’s decease did have a copy made, and that very first copy\r\n  that was made of the Book after its being carried into France he\r\n  did present to his very dear and dread Lord Monseigneur de Valois.\r\n  Thereafter he gave copies of it to such of his friends as asked for\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  “And the copy above-mentioned was presented by the said Sire Marc\r\n  Pol to the said Lord de Cepoy when the latter went to Venice, on\r\n  the part of Monseigneur de Valois and of Madame the Empress his\r\n  wife, as Vicar General for them both in all the Territories of the\r\n  Empire of Constantinople. And this happened in the year of the\r\n  Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand three hundred and\r\n  seven, and in the month of August.”\r\n\r\nOf the bearings of this memorandum on the literary history of Polo’s\r\nBook we shall speak in a following section.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His marriage and his daughters. Marco as a merchant.]\r\n\r\n46. When Marco married we have not been able to ascertain, but it was\r\nno doubt early in the 14th century, for in 1324, we find that he had\r\ntwo married daughters besides one unmarried. His wife’s Christian name\r\nwas _Donata_, but of her family we have as yet found no assurance. I\r\nsuspect, however, that her name may have been Loredano (_vide infra_,\r\np. _77_).\r\n\r\nUnder 1311 we find a document which is of considerable interest,\r\nbecause it is the only one yet discovered which exhibits Marco under\r\nthe aspect of a practical trader. It is the judgment of the Court of\r\nRequests upon a suit brought by the NOBLE MARCO POLO of the parish of\r\nS. Giovanni Grisostomo against one Paulo Girardo of S. Apollinare. It\r\nappears that Marco had entrusted to the latter as a commission agent\r\nfor sale, on an agreement for half profits, a pound and a half of\r\nmusk, priced at six _lire of grossi_ (about 22_l._ 10_s._ in value of\r\nsilver) the pound. Girardo had sold half-a-pound at that rate, and the\r\nremaining pound which he brought back was deficient of a _saggio_, or,\r\none-sixth of an ounce, but he had accounted for neither the sale nor\r\nthe deficiency. Hence Marco sues him for three _lire of Grossi_, the\r\nprice of the half-pound sold, and for twenty _grossi_ as the value of\r\nthe saggio. And the Judges cast the defendant in the amount with costs,\r\nand the penalty of imprisonment in the common gaol of Venice if the\r\namounts were not paid within a suitable term.[11]\r\n\r\nAgain in May, 1323, probably within a year of his death, Ser Marco\r\nappears (perhaps only by attorney), before the Doge and his judicial\r\nexaminers, to obtain a decision respecting a question touching the\r\nrights to certain stairs and porticoes in contact with his own house\r\nproperty, and that obtained from his wife, in S. Giovanni Grisostomo.\r\nTo this allusion has been already made (_supra_, p. _31_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCO POLO’S LAST WILL\r\n\r\n  (_Dimensions of Original, 26·4 inches by 9·4 inches_)\r\n\r\n  FROM A PHOTOGRAPH SPECIALLY TAKEN IN ST.

It is on the 9th of\r\nJanuary, 1324; he is labouring with disease, under which he is sinking\r\nday by day; and he has sent for Giovanni Giustiniani, Priest of S.\r\nProculo and Notary, to make his Last Will and Testament. It runs thus:—\r\n\r\n                 “IN THE NAME OF THE ETERNAL GOD AMEN!\r\n\r\n  “In the year from the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ 1323, on\r\n  the 9th day of the month of January, in the first half of the 7th\r\n  Indiction,[12] at Rialto.\r\n\r\n  “It is the counsel of Divine Inspiration as well as the judgment\r\n  of a provident mind that every man should take thought to make a\r\n  disposition of his property before death become imminent, lest in\r\n  the end it should remain without any disposition:\r\n\r\n  “Wherefore I MARCUS PAULO of the parish of St. John Chrysostom,\r\n  finding myself to grow daily feebler through bodily ailment, but\r\n  being by the grace of God of a sound mind, and of senses and\r\n  judgment unimpaired, have sent for JOHN GIUSTINIANI, Priest of S.\r\n  Proculo and Notary, and have instructed him to draw out in complete\r\n  form this my Testament:\r\n\r\n  “Whereby I constitute as my Trustees DONATA my beloved wife, and\r\n  my dear daughters FANTINA, BELLELA, and MORETA,[13] in order that\r\n  after my decease they may execute the dispositions and bequests\r\n  which I am about to make herein.\r\n\r\n  “First of all: I will and direct that the proper Tithe be paid.[14]\r\n  And over and above the said tithe I direct that 2000 _lire_ of\r\n  Venice denari be distributed as follows:[15]\r\n\r\n  “_Viz._, 20 _soldi_ of Venice _grossi_ to the Monastery of St.\r\n  Lawrence where I desire to be buried.\r\n\r\n   “Also 300 _lire_ of Venice denari to my sister-in-law YSABETA\r\n  QUIRINO,[16] that she owes me.\r\n\r\n  “Also 40 _soldi_ to each of the Monasteries and Hospitals all the\r\n  way from Grado to Capo d’Argine.[17]\r\n\r\n  “Also I bequeath to the Convent of SS. Giovanni and Paolo, of the\r\n  Order of Preachers, that which it owes me, and also 10 _lire_ to\r\n  Friar RENIER, and 5 _lire_ to Friar BENVENUTO the Venetian, of the\r\n  Order of Preachers, in addition to the amount of his debt to me.\r\n\r\n  “I also bequeath 5 _lire_ to every Congregation in Rialto, and 4\r\n  _lire_ to every Guild or Fraternity of which I am a member.[18]\r\n\r\n  “Also I bequeath 20 _soldi_ of Venetian grossi to the Priest\r\n  Giovanni Giustiniani the Notary, for his trouble about this my\r\n  Will, and in order that he may pray the Lord in my behalf.\r\n\r\n  “Also I release PETER the Tartar, my servant, from all bondage, as\r\n  completely as I pray God to release mine own soul from all sin and\r\n  guilt. And I also remit him whatever he may have gained by work\r\n  at his own house; and over and above I bequeath him 100 _lire_ of\r\n  Venice denari.[19]\r\n\r\n   “And the residue of the said 2000 _lire_ free of tithe, I direct\r\n  to be distributed for the good of my soul, according to the\r\n  discretion of my trustees.\r\n\r\n  “Out of my remaining property I bequeath to the aforesaid Donata,\r\n  my Wife and Trustee, 8 _lire_ of Venetian grossi annually during\r\n  her life, for her own use, over and above her settlement, and the\r\n  linen and all the household utensils,[20] with 3 beds garnished.\r\n\r\n  “And all my other property movable and immovable that has not\r\n  been disposed of [here follow some lines of mere technicality]\r\n  I specially and expressly bequeath to my aforesaid Daughters\r\n  Fantina, Bellela, and Moreta, freely and absolutely, to be divided\r\n  equally among them. And I constitute them my heirs as regards all\r\n  and sundry my property movable and immovable, and as regards all\r\n  rights and contingencies tacit and expressed, of whatsoever kind\r\n  as hereinbefore detailed, that belong to me or may fall to me.\r\n  Save and except that before division my said daughter Moreta shall\r\n  receive the same as each of my other daughters hath received for\r\n  dowry and outfit [here follow many lines of technicalities, ending]\r\n\r\n  “And if any one shall presume to infringe or violate this Will, may\r\n  he incur the malediction of God Almighty, and abide bound under the\r\n  anathema of the 318 Fathers; and farthermore he shall forfeit to\r\n  my Trustees aforesaid five pounds of gold;[21] and so let this my\r\n  Testament abide in force. The signature of the above named Messer\r\n  Marco Paulo who gave instructions for this deed.\r\n\r\n  “‡ I Peter Grifon, Priest, Witness.\r\n\r\n  “* I Humfrey Barberi, Witness.\r\n\r\n  “† I John Giustiniani, Priest of S. Proculo, and Notary, have\r\n  completed and authenticated (this testament).”[22]\r\n\r\nWe do not know, as has been said, how long Marco survived the making\r\nof this will, but we know, from a scanty series of documents commencing\r\nin June of the following year (1325), that he had _then_ been some time\r\ndead.[23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Place of Sepulture. Professed Portraits of Polo.]\r\n\r\n48. He was buried, no doubt, according to his declared wish, in the\r\nChurch of S. Lorenzo; and indeed Sansovino bears testimony to the fact\r\nin a confused notice of our Traveller.[24] But there does not seem to\r\nhave been any monument to Marco, though the sarcophagus which had been\r\nerected to his father Nicolo, by his own filial care, existed till\r\nnear the end of the 16th century in the porch or corridor leading to\r\nthe old Church of S. Lorenzo, and bore the inscription: “SEPULTURA\r\nDOMINI NICOLAI PAULO DE CONTRATA S. IOANNIS GRISOSTEMI.” The church\r\nwas renewed from its foundations in 1592, and then, probably, the\r\nsarcophagus was cast aside and lost, and with it all certainty as to\r\nthe position of the tomb.[25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pavement in front of San Lorenzo, Venice.]\r\n\r\nThere is no portrait of Marco Polo in existence with any claim to\r\nauthenticity. The quaint figure which we give in the _Bibliography_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 555, extracted from the earliest printed edition of his\r\nbook, can certainly make no such pretension. The oldest one after this\r\nis probably a picture in the collection of Monsignor Badia at Rome, of\r\nwhich I am now able, by the owner’s courtesy, to give a copy. It is set\r\ndown in the catalogue to Titian, but is probably a work of 1600, or\r\nthereabouts, to which the aspect and costume belong. It is inscribed\r\n“_Marcus Polvs Venetvs Totivs Orbis et Indie Peregrator Primus._” Its\r\nhistory unfortunately cannot be traced, but I believe it came from a\r\ncollection at Urbino. A marble statue was erected in his honour by a\r\nfamily at Venice in the 17th century, and is still to be seen in the\r\nPalazzo Morosini-Gattemburg in the Campo S. Stefano in that city. The\r\nmedallion portrait on the wall of the _Sala dello Scudo_ in the ducal\r\npalace, and which was engraved in Bettom’s “Collection of Portraits of\r\nIllustrious Italians,” is a work of imagination painted by Francesco\r\nGriselini in 1761.[26] From this, however, was taken the medal by\r\nFabris, which was struck in 1847 in honour of the last meeting of the\r\nItalian Congresso Scientifico; and from the medal again is copied,\r\nI believe, the elegant woodcut which adorns the introduction to M.\r\nPauthier’s edition, though without any information as to its history.\r\nA handsome bust, by Augusto Gamba, has lately been placed among the\r\nillustrious Venetians in the inner arcade of the Ducal Palace.[27]\r\nThere is also a mosaic portrait of Polo, opposite the similar portrait\r\nof Columbus in the Municipio at Genoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. Lorenzo as it was in the 15th century]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further History of the Polo Family.]\r\n\r\n49. From the short series of documents recently alluded to,[28] we\r\ngather all that we know of the remaining history of Marco Polo’s\r\nimmediate family. We have seen in his will an indication that the two\r\nelder daughters, Fantina and Bellela, were married before his death. In\r\n1333 we find the youngest, Moreta, also a married woman, and Bellela\r\ndeceased. In 1336 we find that their mother Donata had died in the\r\ninterval. We learn, too, that Fantina’s husband was MARCO BRAGADINO,\r\nand Moreta’s, RANUZZO DOLFINO.[29] The name of Bellela’s husband does\r\nnot appear.\r\n\r\nFantina’s husband is probably the Marco Bragadino, son of Pietro, who\r\nin 1346 is mentioned to have been sent as Provveditore-Generale to\r\nact against the Patriarch of Acquileia.[30] And in 1379 we find Donna\r\nFantina herself, presumably in widowhood, assessed as a resident of S.\r\nGiovanni Grisostomo, on the _Estimo_ or forced loan for the Genoese\r\nwar, at 1300 _lire_, whilst Pietro Bragadino of the same parish—her son\r\nas I imagine—is assessed at 1500 _lire_.[31] [See vol. ii., _Calendar_.]\r\n\r\nThe documents show a few other incidents which may be briefly noted.\r\nIn 1326 we have the record of a charge against one Zanino Grioni for\r\ninsulting Donna Moreta in the Campo of San Vitale; a misdemeanour\r\npunished by the Council of Forty with two months’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mosaic Portrait of Marco Polo at Genoa.]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1328, Marco Polo, called Marcolino, of St. John Chrysostom\r\n(see p. _66_), represents before the _Domini Advocatores_ of the\r\nRepublic that certain _imprestita_ that had belonged to the late Maffeo\r\nPolo the Elder, had been alienated and transferred in May 1318, by\r\nthe late Marco Polo of St. John Chrysostom and since his death by his\r\nheirs, without regard to the rights of the said Marcolino, to whom the\r\nsaid Messer Maffeo had bequeathed 1000 _lire_ by his will executed\r\non 6th February, 1308 (_i.e._ 1309). The Advocatores find that the\r\ntransfer was to that extent unjust and improper, and they order that\r\nto the same extent it should be revoked and annulled. Two months later\r\nthe Lady Donata makes rather an unpleasant figure before the Council\r\nof Forty. It would seem that on the claim of Messer Bertuccio Quirino\r\na mandate of sequestration had been issued by the Court of Requests\r\naffecting certain articles in the Ca’ Polo; including two bags of\r\nmoney which had been tied and sealed, but left in custody of the Lady\r\nDonata. The sum so sealed was about 80 _lire_ of grossi (300_l._ in\r\nsilver value), but when opened only 45 _lire_ and 22 _grossi_ (about\r\n170_l._) were found therein, and the Lady was accused of abstracting\r\nthe balance _non bono modo_. Probably she acted, as ladies sometimes\r\ndo, on a strong sense of her own rights, and a weak sense of the claims\r\nof law. But the Council pronounced against her, ordering restitution,\r\nand a fine of 200 _lire_ over and above “_ut ceteris transeat in\r\nexemplum._”[32]\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that there is nothing in the amounts mentioned\r\nin Marco’s will to bear out the large reports as to his wealth, though\r\nat the same time there is no positive ground for a deduction to the\r\ncontrary.[33]\r\n\r\nThe mention in two of the documents of Agnes Loredano as the sister\r\nof the Lady Donata suggests that the latter may have belonged to the\r\nLoredano family, but as it does not appear whether Agnes was maid or\r\nwife this remains uncertain.[34]\r\n\r\nRespecting the further history of the family there is nothing certain,\r\nnor can we give unhesitating faith to Ramusio’s statement that the\r\nlast male descendant of the Polos of S. Giovanni Grisostomo was Marco,\r\nwho died Castellano of Verona in 1417 (according to others, 1418,\r\nor 1425),[35] and that the family property then passed to Maria (or\r\n_Anna_, as she is styled in a MS. statement furnished to me from\r\nVenice), who was married in 1401 to Benedetto Cornaro, and again in\r\n1414 to Azzo Trevisan. Her descendant in the fourth generation by the\r\nlatter was Marc Antonio Trevisano,[36] who was chosen Doge in 1553.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arms of the Trevisan family.]\r\n\r\nThe genealogy recorded by Marco Barbaro, as drawn up from documents\r\nby Ramusio, makes the Castellano of Verona a grandson of our Marco by\r\na son Maffeo, whom we may safely pronounce not to have existed, and\r\nmakes Maria the daughter of Maffeo, Marco’s brother—that is to say,\r\nmakes a lady marry in 1414 and have children, whose father was born\r\nin 1271 at the very latest! The genealogy is given in several other\r\nways, but as I have satisfied myself that they all (except perhaps\r\nthis of Barbaro’s, which we see to be otherwise erroneous) confound\r\ntogether the two distinct families of Polo of S. Geremia and Polo of\r\nS. Giov. Grisostomo, I reserve my faith, and abstain from presenting\r\nthem. Assuming that the Marco or Marcolino Polo, spoken of in the\r\npreceding page, was a near relation (as is probable, though perhaps\r\nan illegitimate one), he is the only male descendant of old Andrea of\r\nSan Felice whom we can indicate as having survived Marco himself; and\r\nfrom a study of the links in the professed genealogies I think it not\r\nunlikely that both Marco the Castellano of Verona and Maria Trevisan\r\nbelonged to the branch of S. Geremia.[37] [See vol. ii., _App. C_, p.\r\n510.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pseudo Marco Polo at Canton.]\r\n\r\n[49. _bis._—It is interesting to note some of the _reliques_ left by\r\nour traveller.\r\n\r\nI. The unfortunate Doge of Venice, Marino Faliero, seems to have\r\npossessed many souvenirs of Marco Polo, and among them two manuscripts,\r\none in the handwriting of his celebrated fellow-citizen(?), and one\r\nadorned with miniatures.

He had drafted his will with his own hand, sealed the draft,\r\n    and made it over to Pietro Pagano, priest of S.

(“Ego Matheus Paulo ... volens ire in Cretam, ne repentinus\r\n    casus hujus vite fragilis me subreperet intestatum, mea propria\r\n    manu meum scripsi et condidi testamentum, rogans Petrum Paganum\r\n    ecclesie Scti.

Leaves 20 _soldi_ to each of the Monasteries from Grado to Capo\r\n    d’Argine; and 150 _lire_ to all the congregations of Rialto, on\r\n    condition that the priests of these maintain an annual service in\r\n    behalf of the souls of his father, mother, and self.\r\n\r\n    5. To his daughter Fiordelisa 2000 _lire_ to marry her withal. To\r\n    be invested in safe mortgages in Venice, and the interest to go to\r\n    her.\r\n\r\n    Also leaves her the interest from 1000 _lire_ of his funds in\r\n    Public Debt (? _de meis imprestitis_) to provide for her till she\r\n    marries. After her marriage this 1000 _lire_ and its interest shall\r\n    go to his male heir if he has one, and failing that to his brother\r\n    Marco.\r\n\r\n    6. To his wife Catharine 400 _lire_ and all her clothes as they\r\n    stand now. To the Lady Maroca 100 _lire_.\r\n\r\n    7. To his natural daughter Pasqua 400 _lire_ to marry her withal.\r\n    Or, if she likes to be a nun, 200 _lire_ shall go to her convent\r\n    and the other 200 shall purchase securities for her benefit. After\r\n    her death these shall come to his male heir, or failing that be\r\n    sold, and the proceeds distributed for the good of the souls of his\r\n    father, mother, and self.\r\n\r\n    8. To his natural brothers Stephen and Giovannino he leaves 500\r\n    _lire_. If one dies the whole to go to the other. If both die\r\n    before marrying, to go to his male heir; failing such, to his\r\n    brother Marco or _his_ male heir.\r\n\r\n    9. To his uncle Giordano Trevisano 200 _lire_. To Marco de Tumba\r\n    100. To Fiordelisa, wife of Felix Polo, 100. To Maroca, the\r\n    daughter of the late Pietro Trevisano, living at Negropont, 100. To\r\n    Agnes, wife of Pietro Lion, 100; and to Francis, son of the late\r\n    Pietro Trevisano, in Negropont, 100.\r\n\r\n    10. To buy Public Debt producing an annual 20 _lire ai grossi_ to\r\n    be paid yearly to Pietro Pagano, Priest of S. Felice, who shall\r\n    pray for the souls aforesaid: on death of said Pietro the income to\r\n    go to Pietro’s cousin Lionardo, Clerk of S. Felice; and after him\r\n    always to the senior priest of S. Giovanni Grisostomo with the same\r\n    obligation.\r\n\r\n    11. Should his wife prove with child and bear a son or sons they\r\n    shall have his whole property not disposed of. If a daughter, she\r\n    shall have the same as Fiordelisa.\r\n\r\n    12. If he have no male heir his Brother Marco shall have the\r\n    Testator’s share of his Father’s bequest, and 2000 _lire_ besides.\r\n    Cousin Nicolo shall have 500 _lire_, and Uncle Maffeo 500.\r\n\r\n    13. Should Daughter Fiordelisa die unmarried her 2000 _lire_ and\r\n    interest to go to his male heir, and failing such to Brother Marco\r\n    and his male heir. But in that case Marco shall pay 500 _lire_ to\r\n    Cousin Nicolo or his male heir.\r\n\r\n    14. Should his wife bear him a male heir or heirs, but these should\r\n    die under age, the whole of his undisposed property shall go to\r\n    Brother Marco or his male heir. But in that case 500 _lire_ shall\r\n    be paid to Cousin Nicolo.\r\n\r\n    15. Should his wife bear a daughter and she die unmarried, her\r\n    2000 _lire_ and interest shall go to Brother Marco, with the same\r\n    stipulation in behalf of Cousin Nicolo.\r\n\r\n    16. Should the whole amount of his property between cash and goods\r\n    not amount to 10,000 _lire_ (though he believes he has fully as\r\n    much), his bequests are to be ratably diminished, except those to\r\n    his own children which he does not wish diminished. Should any\r\n    legatee die before receiving the bequest, its amount shall fall to\r\n    the Testator’s heir male, and failing such, the half to go to Marco\r\n    or his male heir, and the other half to be distributed for the good\r\n    of the souls aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    The witnesses are Lionardo priest of S. Felice, Lionardo clerk of\r\n    the same, and the Notary Pietro Pagano priest of the same.\r\n\r\n[2] According to Romanin (I. 321) the _lira dei grossi_ was also called\r\n    _Lira d’imprestidi_, and if the _lire_ here are to be so taken, the\r\n    sum will be 10,000 ducats, the largest amount by far that occurs in\r\n    any of these Polo documents, unless, indeed, the 1000 _lire_ in § 5\r\n    of Maffeo Junior’s Will be the like; but I have some doubt if such\r\n    lire are intended in either case.\r\n\r\n[3] “(Resolved) That grace be granted to the respectable MARCO PAULO,\r\n    relieving him of the penalty he has incurred for neglecting to have\r\n    his water-pipe examined, seeing that he was ignorant of the order\r\n    on that subject.” (See _Appendix C._ No. 3.) The other reference,\r\n    to M. Polo, of S. Geremia, runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n    [_MCCCII. indic. XV. die VIII. Macii q̄ fiat grā Gūillō aurifici q̄\r\n    ipe absolvat a pena ī qua dicit icurisse p̄ uno spōtono sibi iūeto\r\n    veuiēdo de Mestre p̄p̄e domū Macī Pauli de Canaregio ūi descenderat\r\n    ad bibendū._]\r\n\r\n    “That grace be granted to William the Goldsmith, relieving him of\r\n    the penalty which he is stated to have incurred on account of a\r\n    spontoon (_spontono_, a loaded bludgeon) found upon him near the\r\n    house of MARCO PAULO of Cannareggio, where he had landed to drink\r\n    on his way from Mestre.” (See _Cicogna_, V. p. 606.)\r\n\r\n[4] _Sansovino, Venezia, Città Nobilissima e Singolare, Descritta_,\r\n    etc., Ven. 1581, f. 236 _v._; _Barbaro, Alberi; Coronelli, Allante\r\n    Veneto_, I. 19.\r\n\r\n[5] The word _Millio_ occurs several times in the Chronicle of the\r\n    Doge Andrea Dandolo, who wrote about 1342; and _Milion_ occurs at\r\n    least once (besides the application of the term to Polo) in the\r\n    History of Giovanni Villani; viz. when he speaks of the Treasury\r\n    of Avignon:— “_diciotto_ milioni _di fiorini d’oro_ ec. _che ogni_\r\n    milione _è mille migliaja di fiorini d’ oro la valuta_.” (xi. 20,\r\n    § 1; _Ducange_, and _Vocab. Univ. Ital._). But the definition,\r\n    thought necessary by Villani, in itself points to the use of the\r\n    word as rare. _Domilion_ occurs in the estimated value of houses\r\n    at Venice in 1367, recorded in the _Cronaca Magna_ in St. Mark’s\r\n    Library. (_Romanin_, III. 385).\r\n\r\n[6] “Also; that Pardon be granted to Bonocio of Mestre for that 152\r\n    _lire_ in which he stood condemned by the Captains of the Posts,\r\n    on account of wine smuggled by him, in such wise: to wit, that he\r\n    was to pay the said fine in 4 years by annual instalments of one\r\n    fourth, to be retrenched from the pay due to him on his journey in\r\n    the suite of our ambassadors, with assurance that anything then\r\n    remaining deficient of his instalments should be made good by\r\n    himself or his securities. And his securities are the Nobles Pietro\r\n    Morosini and MARCO PAULO MILION̄.” Under _Milion̄_ is written in an\r\n    ancient hand “_mortuus_.” (See _Appendix C_, No. 4.)\r\n\r\n[7] Humboldt tells this (_Examen_, II. 221), alleging _Jacopo d’Acqui_\r\n    as authority; and Libri (_H. des Sciences Mathématiques_, II. 149),\r\n    quoting _Doglioni, Historia Veneziana_. But neither authority bears\r\n    out the citations. The story seems really to come from Amoretti’s\r\n    commentary on the _Voyage du Cap. L. F. Maldonado_, Plaisance,\r\n    1812, p. 67. Amoretti quotes as authority _Pignoria, Degli Dei\r\n    Antichi_.\r\n\r\n    An odd revival of this old libel was mentioned to me recently by\r\n    Mr. George Moffatt. When he was at school it was common among the\r\n    boys to express incredulity by the phrase: “Oh, what a Marco Polo!”\r\n\r\n[8] Thibault, according to Ducange, was in 1307 named Grand Master\r\n    of the Arblasteers of France; and Buchon says his portrait is at\r\n    Versailles among the Admirals (No. 1170). Ramon de Muntaner fell\r\n    in with the Seigneur de Cepoy in Greece, and speaks of him as “but\r\n    a Captain of the Wind, as his Master was King of the Wind.” (See\r\n    _Ducange, H. de l’Empire de Const. sous les Emp. François_, Venice\r\n    ed. 1729, pp. 109, 110; _Buchon, Chroniques Etrangères_, pp. lv.\r\n    467–470.)\r\n\r\n[9] The note is not found in the Bodleian MS., which is the third known\r\n    one of this precise type.\r\n\r\n[10] Messire Jean, the son of Thibault, is mentioned in the accounts of\r\n    the latter in the _Chambre des Comptes_ at Paris, as having been\r\n    with his Father in Romania. And in 1344 he commanded a confederate\r\n    Christian armament sent to check the rising power of the Turks,\r\n    and beat a great Turkish fleet in the Greek seas. (_Heyd._ I. 377;\r\n    _Buchon_, 468.)\r\n\r\n[11] The document is given in _Appendix C_, No. 5. It was found by\r\n    Comm. Barozzi, the Director of the Museo Civico, when he had most\r\n    kindly accompanied me to aid in the search for certain other\r\n    documents in the archives of the _Casa di Ricovero_, or Poor House\r\n    of Venice. These archives contain a great mass of testamentary\r\n    and other documents, which probably have come into that singular\r\n    depository in connection with bequests to public charities.\r\n\r\n    The document next mentioned was found in as strange a site, viz.,\r\n    the _Casa degli Esposti_ or Foundling Hospital, which possesses\r\n    similar muniments. This also I owe to Comm. Barozzi, who had\r\n    noted it some years before, when commencing an arrangement of the\r\n    archives of the Institution.\r\n\r\n[12] The Legal Year at Venice began on the 1st of March. And 1324 was\r\n    7th of the Indiction. Hence the date is, according to the modern\r\n    Calendar, 1324.\r\n\r\n[13] Marsden says of Moreta and Fantina, the only daughters named\r\n    by Ramusio, that these may be thought rather familiar terms of\r\n    endearment than baptismal names. This is a mistake however.\r\n    _Fantina_ is from one of the parochial saints of Venice, S.\r\n    Fantino, and the male name was borne by sundry Venetians, among\r\n    others by a son of Henry Dandolo’s. Moreta is perhaps a variation\r\n    of Maroca, which seems to have been a family name among the Polos.\r\n    We find also the male name of Bellela, written _Bellello_,\r\n    _Bellero_, _Belletto_.\r\n\r\n[14] The _Decima_ went to the Bishop of Castello (eventually converted\r\n    into Patriarch of Venice) to divide between himself, the Clergy,\r\n    the Church, and the Poor. It became a source of much bad feeling,\r\n    which came to a head after the plague of 1348, when some families\r\n    had to pay the tenth three times within a very short space. The\r\n    existing Bishop agreed to a composition, but his successor Paolo\r\n    Foscari (1367) claimed that on the death of every citizen an exact\r\n    inventory should be made, and a full tithe levied. The Signory\r\n    fought hard with the Bishop, but he fled to the Papal Court and\r\n    refused all concession. After his death in 1376 a composition was\r\n    made for 5500 ducats yearly. (_Romanin_, II. 406; III. 161, 165.)\r\n\r\n[15] There is a difficulty about estimating the value of these sums\r\n    from the variety of Venice pounds or _lire_. Thus the _Lira dei\r\n    piccoli_ was reckoned 3 to the ducat or zecchin, the _Lira ai\r\n    grossi_ 2 to the ducat, but the _Lira_ dei _grossi_ or _Lira\r\n    d’imprestidi_ was equal to 10 ducats, or (allowing for higher\r\n    value of silver then) about 3_l._ 15_s._; a little more than\r\n    the equivalent of the then Pound sterling. This last money is\r\n    _specified_ in some of the bequests, as in the 20 soldi (or 1\r\n    lira) to St. Lorenzo, and in the annuity of 8 lire to Polo’s wife;\r\n    but it seems doubtful what money is meant when _libra_ only or\r\n    _libra denariorum venetorum_ is used. And this doubt is not new.\r\n    Gallicciolli relates that in 1232 Giacomo Menotto left to the\r\n    Church of S. Cassiano as an annuity _libras denariorum venetorum\r\n    quatuor_. Till 1427 the church received the income as of _lire dei\r\n    piccoli_, but on bringing a suit on the subject it was adjudged\r\n    that _lire ai grossi_ were to be understood. (_Delle Mem. Venet.\r\n    Ant._ II. 18.) This story, however, cuts both ways, and does not\r\n    decide our doubt.\r\n\r\n[16] The form of the name _Ysabeta_ aptly illustrates the transition\r\n    that seems so strange from _Elizabeth_ into the _Isabel_ that the\r\n    Spaniards made of it.\r\n\r\n[17] _I.e._ the extent of what was properly called the Dogado, all\r\n    along the Lagoons from Grado on the extreme east to Capo d’Argine\r\n    (Cavarzere at the mouth of the Adige) on the extreme west.\r\n\r\n[18] The word rendered _Guilds_ is “_Scholarum_.” The crafts at Venice\r\n    were united in corporations called _Fraglie_ or _Scholae_, each\r\n    of which had its statutes, its head called the _Gastald_, and its\r\n    place of meeting under the patronage of some saint. These acted as\r\n    societies of mutual aid, gave dowries to poor girls, caused masses\r\n    to be celebrated for deceased members, joined in public religious\r\n    processions, etc., nor could any craft be exercised except by\r\n    members of such a guild. (_Romanin_, I. 390.)\r\n\r\n[19] A few years after Ser Marco’s death (1328) we find the Great\r\n    Council granting to this Peter the rights of a natural Venetian, as\r\n    having been a long time at Venice, and well-conducted. (See App. C,\r\n    _Calendar of Documents_, No. 13.) This might give some additional\r\n    colour to M. Pauthier’s supposition that this Peter the Tartar was\r\n    a faithful servant who had accompanied Messer Marco from the East\r\n    30 years before. But yet the supposition is probably unfounded.\r\n    Slavery and slave-trade were very prevalent at Venice in the Middle\r\n    Ages, and V. Lazari, a writer who examined a great many records\r\n    connected therewith, found that by far the greater number of slaves\r\n    were described as _Tartars_. There does not seem to be any clear\r\n    information as to how they were imported, but probably from the\r\n    factories on the Black Sea, especially Tana after its establishment.\r\n\r\n    A tax of 5 ducats per head was set on the export of slaves in 1379,\r\n    and as the revenue so received under the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo\r\n    (1414–1423) amounted (so says Lazari) to 50,000 ducats, the\r\n    startling conclusion is that 10,000 slaves yearly were exported!\r\n    This it is difficult to accept. The slaves were chiefly employed\r\n    in domestic service, and the records indicate the women to have\r\n    been about twice as numerous as the men. The highest price recorded\r\n    is 87 ducats paid for a Russian girl sold in 1429. All the higher\r\n    prices are for young women; a significant circumstance. With the\r\n    existence of this system we may safely connect the extraordinary\r\n    frequence of mention of illegitimate children in Venetian wills and\r\n    genealogies. (See _Lazari, Del Traffico degli Schiavi in Venezia_,\r\n    etc., in _Miscellanea di Storia Italiana_, I. 463 _seqq._) In 1308\r\n    the Khan Toktai of Kipchak (see Polo, II. 496), hearing that the\r\n    Genoese and other Franks were in the habit of carrying off Tartar\r\n    children to sell, sent a force against Caffa, which was occupied\r\n    without resistance, the people taking refuge in their ships. The\r\n    Khan also seized the Genoese property in Sarai. (_Heyd._ II. 27.)\r\n\r\n[20] “_Stracium et omne capud massariciorum_”; in Scotch phrase\r\n    “_napery and plenishing_.” A Venetian statute of 1242 prescribes\r\n    that a bequest of _massariticum_ shall be held to carry to the\r\n    legatee all articles of common family use except those of gold\r\n    and silver plate or jeweller’s work. (See _Ducange, sub voce._)\r\n    _Stracci_ is still used technically in Venice for “household linen.”\r\n\r\n[21] In the original _aureas libras quinque_. According to Marino\r\n    Sanudo the Younger (_Vite dei Dogi_ in _Muratori_, xxii. 521) this\r\n    should be pounds or _lire_ of _aureole_, the name of a silver\r\n    coin struck by and named after the Doge _Aurio_ Mastropietro\r\n    (1178–1192): “Ancora fu fatta una Moneta d’argento che si chiamava\r\n    _Aureola_ per la casata del Doge; _è quella Moneta che i Notai de\r\n    Venezia mettevano di pena sotto i loro instrumenti_.” But this was\r\n    a vulgar error. An example of the penalty of 5 pounds of gold is\r\n    quoted from a decree of 960; and the penalty is sometimes expressed\r\n    “_auri purissimi librae_ 5.” A coin called the _lira d’oro_ or\r\n    _redonda_ is alleged to have been in use before the ducat was\r\n    introduced. (See _Gallicciolli_, II. 16.) But another authority\r\n    seems to identify the _lira a oro_ with the _lira dei grossi_. (See\r\n    _Zanetti, Nuova Racc. delle Monete &c. d’Italia_, 1775. I. 308.)\r\n\r\n[22] We give a photographic reduction of the original document. This,\r\n    and the other two Polo Wills already quoted, had come into the\r\n    possession of the Noble Filippo Balbi, and were by him presented in\r\n    our own time to the St. Mark’s Library. They are all on parchment,\r\n    in writing of that age, and have been officially examined and\r\n    declared to be originals. They were first published by _Cicogna,\r\n    Iscrizioni Veneziane_, III. 489–493. We give Marco’s in the\r\n    original language, line for line with the facsimile, in _Appendix\r\n    C_.\r\n\r\n    There is no signature, as may be seen, except those of the\r\n    Witnesses and the Notary. The sole presence of a Notary was held\r\n    to make a deed valid, and from about the middle of the 13th\r\n    century in Italy it is common to find no actual signature (even of\r\n    witnesses) except that of the Notary. The peculiar flourish before\r\n    the Notary’s name is what is called the _Tabellionato_, a fanciful\r\n    distinctive monogram which each Notary adopted. Marco’s Will is\r\n    unfortunately written in a very cramp hand with many contractions.\r\n    The other two Wills (of Marco the Elder and Maffeo) are in\r\n    beautiful and clear Gothic penmanship.\r\n\r\n[23] We have noticed formerly (pp. _14–15_, _note_) the recent\r\n    discovery of a document bearing what was supposed to be the\r\n    autograph signature of our Traveller. The document in question is\r\n    the Minute of a Resolution of the Great Council, attested by the\r\n    signatures of three members, of whom the last is MARCUS PAULLO.\r\n    But the date alone, 11th March, 1324, is sufficient to raise the\r\n    gravest doubts as to this signature being that of our Marco. And\r\n    further examination, as I learn from a friend at Venice, has shown\r\n    that the same name occurs in connection with analogous entries on\r\n    several subsequent occasions up to the middle of the century. I\r\n    presume that this Marco Polo is the same that is noticed in our\r\n    _Appendix B_, II. as a voter in the elections of the Doges Marino\r\n    Faliero and Giovanni Gradenigo. I have not been able to ascertain\r\n    his relation to either branch of the Polo family; but I suspect\r\n    that he belonged to that of S. Geremia, of which there _was_\r\n    certainly a Marco about the middle of the century.\r\n\r\n[24] “Under the _angiporta_ (of S. Lorenzo) [see plate] is buried\r\n    that Marco Polo surnamed Milione, who wrote the Travels in the\r\n    New World, and who was the first before Christopher Columbus to\r\n    discover new countries. No faith was put in him because of the\r\n    extravagant things that he recounted; but in the days of our\r\n    Fathers Columbus augmented belief in him, by discovering that\r\n    part of the world which eminent men had heretofore judged to be\r\n    uninhabited.” (_Venezia ... Descritta_, etc., f. 23 _v._) Marco\r\n    Barbaro attests the same inscription in his Genealogies (copy in\r\n    Museo Civico at Venice).\r\n\r\n[25] _Cicogna_, II. 385.\r\n\r\n[26] _Lazari_, xxxi.\r\n\r\n[27] In the first edition I noticed briefly a statement that had\r\n    reached me from China that, in the Temple at Canton vulgarly called\r\n    “of the 500 gods,” there is a foreign figure which from the name\r\n    attached had been supposed to represent Marco Polo! From what I\r\n    have heard from Mr. Wylie, a very competent authority, this is\r\n    nonsense. The temple contains 500 figures of _Arhans_ or Buddhist\r\n    saints, and one of these attracts attention from having a hat like\r\n    a sailor’s straw hat. Mr. Wylie had not remarked the name. [A\r\n    model of this figure was exhibited at Venice at the international\r\n    Geographical Congress, in 1881. I give a reproduction of this\r\n    figure and of the Temple of 500 Genii (_Fa Lum Sze_) at Canton,\r\n    from drawings by Félix Régamey made after photographs sent to me\r\n    by my late friend, M. Camille Imbault Huart, French Consul at\r\n    Canton.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[28] These documents are noted in Appendix C, Nos. 9–12, 14, 17, 18.\r\n\r\n[29] I can find no _Ranuzzo_ Dolfino among the Venetian genealogies,\r\n    but several _Reniers_. And I suspect Ranuzzo may be a form of the\r\n    latter name.\r\n\r\n[30] _Cappellari_ (see p. 77, footnote) under _Bragadino_.\r\n\r\n[31] _Ibid._ and _Gallicciolli_, II. 146.\r\n\r\n[32] The _lire_ of the fine are not specified; but probably _ai\r\n    grossi_, which would be = 37_l._ 10_s._; not, we hope, _dei_ grossi!\r\n\r\n[33] Yet, if the family were so wealthy as tradition represents, it is\r\n    strange that Marco’s brother Maffeo, _after_ receiving a share of\r\n    his father’s property, should have possessed barely 10,000 _lire_,\r\n    probably equivalent to 5000 ducats at most. (See p. _65_, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n[34] An Agnes Loredano, Abbess of S. Maria delle Vergini, died in 1397.\r\n    (_Cicogna_, V. 91 and 629.) The interval of 61 years makes it\r\n    somewhat improbable that it should be the same.\r\n\r\n[35] In the _Museo Civico_ (No. 2271 of the Cicogna collection) there\r\n    is a commission addressed by the Doge Michiel Steno in 1408,\r\n    “_Nobili Viro Marcho Paulo_,” nominating him Podestà of Arostica (a\r\n    Castello of the Vicentino). This is probably the same Marco.\r\n\r\n[36] The descent runs: (1) Azzo = Maria Polo; (2) Febo, Captain at\r\n    Padua; (3) Zaccaria, Senator; (4) Domenico, Procurator of St.\r\n    Mark’s; (5) Marc’Antonio, Doge (_Cappellari_, _Campidoglio\r\n    Veneto_, MS. St. Mark’s Lib.).\r\n\r\n    Marc’Antonio _nolebat ducari_ and after election desired to\r\n    renounce. His friends persuaded him to retain office, but he lived\r\n    scarcely a year after. (_Cicogna_, IV. 566.) [See p. _8_.]\r\n\r\n[37] In Appendix B will be found tabulated all the facts that seem to\r\n    be positively ascertained as to the Polo genealogies.\r\n\r\n    In the Venetian archives occurs a procuration executed by the Doge\r\n    in favour of the _Nobilis Vir_ SER MARCO PAULO that he may present\r\n    himself before the king of Sicily; under date, Venice 9th November,\r\n    1342. And some years later we have in the Sicilian Archives an\r\n    order by King Lewis of Sicily, directed to the Maestri Procuratori\r\n    of Messina, which grants to MARCO POLO of Venice, on account of\r\n    services rendered to the king’s court, the privilege of free import\r\n    and export at the port of Messina, without payment of customs of\r\n    goods to the amount annually of 20 ounces. Dated in Catania 13th\r\n    January, 1346 (1347?).\r\n\r\n    For the former notice I am indebted to the courtesy of Signor B.\r\n    Cecchetti of the Venetian Archives, who cites it as “transcribed\r\n    in the _Commemor._ IV. p. 5”; for the latter to that of the Abate\r\n    Carini of the _Reale Archivio_ at Palermo; it is in _Archivio della\r\n    Regia Cancellaria_ 1343–1357, f. 58.\r\n\r\n    The mission of this MARCO POLO is mentioned also in a rescript of\r\n    the Sicilian king Peter II., dated Messina, 14th November, 1340, in\r\n    reference to certain claims of Venice, about which the said Marco\r\n    appeared as the Doge’s ambassador. This is printed in F. TESTA, _De\r\n    Vitâ et Rebus Gestis Federici II., Siciliæ Regis_, Panormi, 1775,\r\n    pp. 267 _seqq._ The Sicilian Antiquary Rosario Gregorio identifies\r\n    the Envoy with our Marco, dead long before. (See _Opere scelte del\r\n    Canon Ros. Gregorio_, Palermo, 1845, 3za ediz., p. 352.)\r\n\r\n    It is possible that this Marco, who from the latter notice seems\r\n    to have been engaged in mercantile affairs, may have been the\r\n    Marcolino above mentioned, but it is perhaps on the whole more\r\n    probable that this _nobilis vir_ is the Marco spoken of in the note\r\n    at p. _74_.\r\n\r\n[38] _La Collezione del Doge Marin Faliero e i Tesori di Marco Polo_,\r\n    pp. 98–103. I have seen this article.—H. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IX. MARCO POLO’S BOOK; AND THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT WAS\r\n                            FIRST WRITTEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General statement of what the Book contains.]\r\n\r\n50. The Book itself consists essentially of Two Parts. _First_, of\r\na Prologue, as it is termed, the only part which is actual personal\r\nnarrative, and which relates, in a very interesting but far too brief\r\nmanner, the circumstances which led the two elder Polos to the Kaan’s\r\nCourt, and those of their second journey with Mark, and of their return\r\nto Persia through the Indian Seas. _Secondly_, of a long series of\r\nchapters of very unequal length, descriptive of notable sights and\r\nproducts, of curious manners and remarkable events, relating to the\r\ndifferent nations and states of Asia, but, above all, to the Emperor\r\nKúblái, his court, wars, and administration. A series of chapters near\r\nthe close treats in a verbose and monotonous manner of sundry wars that\r\ntook place between the various branches of the House of Chinghiz in the\r\nlatter half of the 13th century. This last series is either omitted\r\nor greatly curtailed in all the copies and versions except one; a\r\ncircumstance perfectly accounted for by the absence of interest as well\r\nas value in the bulk of these chapters. Indeed, desirous though I have\r\nbeen to give the Traveller’s work complete, and sharing the dislike\r\nthat every man who _uses_ books must bear to abridgments, I have felt\r\nthat it would be sheer waste and dead-weight to print these chapters in\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Porcelain Incense-Burner, from the Louvre.]\r\n\r\nThis second and main portion of the Work is in its oldest forms\r\nundivided, the chapters running on consecutively to the end.[1] In some\r\nvery early Italian or Venetian version, which Friar Pipino translated\r\ninto Latin, it was divided into three Books, and this convenient\r\ndivision has generally been adhered to. We have adopted M. Pauthier’s\r\nsuggestion in making the final series of chapters, chiefly historical,\r\ninto a Fourth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Language of the original Work.]\r\n\r\n51. As regards the language in which Marco’s Book was first\r\ncommitted to writing, we have seen that Ramusio assumed, somewhat\r\narbitrarily, that it was _Latin_; Marsden supposed it to have been\r\nthe _Venetian_ dialect; Baldelli Boni first showed, in his elaborate\r\nedition (Florence, 1827), by arguments that have been illustrated and\r\ncorroborated by learned men since, that it was _French_.\r\n\r\nThat the work was originally written in _some_ Italian dialect was a\r\nnatural presumption, and slight contemporary evidence can be alleged in\r\nits favour; for Fra Pipino, in the Latin version of the work, executed\r\nwhilst Marco still lived, describes his task as a translation _de\r\nvulgari_. And in one MS. copy of the same Friar Pipino’s Chronicle,\r\nexisting in the library at Modena, he refers to the said version\r\nas made “_ex vulgari idiomate_ Lombardico.” But though it may seem\r\nimprobable that at so early a date a Latin version should have been\r\nmade at second hand, I believe this to have been the case, and that\r\nsome internal evidence also is traceable that Pipino translated _not_\r\nfrom the original but from an Italian _version_ of the original.\r\n\r\nThe oldest MS. (it is supposed) in any Italian dialect is one in\r\nthe Magliabecchian Library at Florence, which is known in Italy as\r\n_L’Ottima_, on account of the purity of its Tuscan, and as _Della\r\nCrusca_ from its being one of the authorities cited by that body\r\nin their Vocabulary.[2] It bears on its face the following note in\r\nItalian:—\r\n\r\n  “This Book called the Navigation of Messer Marco Polo, a noble\r\n  Citizen of Venice, was written in Florence by Michael Ormanni my\r\n  great grandfather by the Mother’s side, who died in the Year of\r\n  Grace One Thousand Three Hundred and Nine; and my mother brought it\r\n  into our Family of Del Riccio, and it belongs to me Pier del Riccio\r\n  and to my Brother; 1452.”\r\n\r\nAs far as I can learn, the age which this note implies is considered to\r\nbe supported by the character of the MS. itself.[3] If it be accepted,\r\nthe latter is a performance going back to within eleven years _at most_\r\nof the first dictation of the Travels. At first sight, therefore, this\r\nwould rather argue that the original had been written in pure Tuscan.\r\nBut when Baldelli came to prepare it for the press he found manifest\r\nindications of its being a Translation from the _French_. Some of these\r\nhe has noted; others have followed up the same line of comparison. We\r\ngive some detailed examples in a note.[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Temple of 500 Genii, at Canton, _after a Drawing by_\r\n  FÉLIX RÉGAMEY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Old French Text published by the Société de Géographie.]\r\n\r\n52. The French Text that we have been quoting, published by the\r\nGeographical Society of Paris in 1824, affords on the other hand\r\nthe strongest corresponding proof that it is an original and not a\r\nTranslation. Rude as is the language of the manuscript (Fr. 1116,\r\nformerly No. 7367, of Paris Library), it is, in the correctness of the\r\nproper names, and the intelligible exhibition of the itineraries, much\r\nsuperior to any form of the Work previously published.\r\n\r\nThe language is very peculiar. We are obliged to call it French, but it\r\nis not “Frenche of Paris.” “Its style,” says Paulin Paris, “is about as\r\nlike that of good French authors of the age, as in our day the natural\r\naccent of a German, an Englishman, or an Italian, is like that of a\r\ncitizen of Paris or Blois.” The author is at war with all the practices\r\nof French grammar; subject and object, numbers, moods, and tenses, are\r\nin consummate confusion. Even readers of his own day must at times\r\nhave been fain to guess his meaning. Italian words are constantly\r\nintroduced, either quite in the crude or rudely Gallicized.[5] And\r\nwords also, we may add, sometimes slip in which appear to be purely\r\nOriental, just as is apt to happen with Anglo-Indians in these days.[6]\r\nAll this is perfectly consistent with the supposition that we have\r\nin this MS. a copy at least of the original words as written down\r\nby Rusticiano a Tuscan, from the dictation of Marco an Orientalized\r\nVenetian, in French, a language foreign to both.\r\n\r\nBut the character of the language _as French_ is not its only\r\npeculiarity. There is in the style, apart from grammar or vocabulary, a\r\nrude angularity, a rough dramatism like that of oral narrative; there\r\nis a want of proportion in the style of different parts, now over curt,\r\nnow diffuse and wordy, with at times even a hammering reiteration; a\r\nconstant recurrence of pet colloquial phrases (in which, however, other\r\nliterary works of the age partake); a frequent change in the spelling\r\nof the same proper names, even when recurring within a few lines, as if\r\ncaught by ear only; a literal following to and fro of the hesitations\r\nof the narrator; a more general use of the third person in speaking\r\nof the Traveller, but an occasional lapse into the first. All these\r\ncharacteristics are strikingly indicative of the unrevised product of\r\ndictation, and many of them would _necessarily_ disappear either in\r\ntranslation or in a revised copy.\r\n\r\nOf changes in representing the same proper name, take as an example\r\nthat of the Kaan of Persia whom Polo calls _Quiacatu_ (Kaikhátú), but\r\nalso _Acatu, Catu_, and the like.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the literal following of dictation take the following:—\r\n\r\n  “Let us leave Rosia, and I will tell you about the Great Sea (the\r\n  Euxine), and what provinces and nations lie round about it, all\r\n  in detail; and we will begin with Constantinople—First, however,\r\n  I should tell you about a province, etc.... There is nothing more\r\n  worth mentioning, so I will speak of other subjects,—but there is\r\n  one thing more to tell you about Rosia that I had forgotten.... Now\r\n  then let us speak of the Great Sea as I was about to do. To be sure\r\n  many merchants and others have been here, but still there are many\r\n  again who know nothing about it, so it will be well to include it\r\n  in our Book. We will do so then, and let us begin first with the\r\n  Strait of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n  “At the Straits leading into the Great Sea, on the West Side, there\r\n  is a hill called the Faro.—But since beginning on this matter I\r\n  have changed my mind, because so many people know all about it, so\r\n  we will not put it in our description but go on to something else.”\r\n  (See vol. ii. p. 487 _seqq._)\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of tautology and hammering reiteration the following\r\ncan scarcely be surpassed. The Traveller is speaking of the _Chughi_,\r\n_i.e._ the Indian Jogis:—\r\n\r\n  “And there are among them certain devotees, called _Chughi_; these\r\n  are longer-lived than the other people, for they live from 150 to\r\n  200 years; and yet they are so hale of body that they can go and\r\n  come wheresoever they please, and do all the service needed for\r\n  their monastery or their idols, and do it just as well as if they\r\n  were younger; and that comes of the great abstinence that they\r\n  practise, in eating little food and only what is wholesome; for\r\n  they use to eat rice and milk more than anything else. And again I\r\n  tell you that these Chughi who live such a long time as I have told\r\n  you, do also eat what I am going to tell you, and you will think\r\n  it a great matter. For I tell you that they take quicksilver and\r\n  sulphur, and mix them together, and make a drink of them, and then\r\n  they drink this, and they say that it adds to their life; and in\r\n  fact they do live much longer for it; and I tell you that they do\r\n  this twice every month. And let me tell you that these people use\r\n  this drink from their infancy in order to live longer, and without\r\n  fail those who live so long as I have told you use this drink of\r\n  sulphur and quicksilver.” (See G. T. p. 213.)\r\n\r\nSuch talk as this does not survive the solvent of translation; and\r\nwe may be certain that we have here the nearest approach to the\r\nTraveller’s reminiscences as they were taken down from his lips in the\r\nprison of Genoa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusive proof that the Old French Text is the source of\r\nall the others.]\r\n\r\n53. Another circumstance, heretofore I believe unnoticed, is in itself\r\nenough to demonstrate the Geographic Text to be the source of all other\r\nversions of the Work. It is this.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the various classes or types of texts of Polo’s Book,\r\nwhich we shall hereafter attempt to discriminate, there are certain\r\nproper names which we find in the different texts to take very\r\ndifferent forms, each class adhering in the main to one particular form.\r\n\r\nThus the names of the Mongol ladies introduced at pp. 32 and 36 of this\r\nvolume, which are in proper Oriental form _Bulughán_ and _Kukáchin_,\r\nappear in the class of MSS. which Pauthier has followed as _Bolgara_\r\nand _Cogatra_; in the MSS. of Pipino’s version, and those founded\r\non it, including Ramusio, the names appear in the correcter forms\r\n_Bolgana_ or _Balgana_ and _Cogacin_. Now _all the forms_ Bolgana,\r\nBalgana, Bolgara, _and_ Cogatra, Cocacin _appear in the Geographic\r\nText_.\r\n\r\nKaikhátú Kaan appears in the Pauthier MSS. as _Chiato_, in the Pipinian\r\nas _Acatu_, in the Ramusian as _Chiacato. All three forms_, Chiato,\r\nAchatu, and Quiacatu _are found in the Geographic Text_.\r\n\r\nThe city of Koh-banan appears in the Pauthier MSS. as _Cabanant_, in\r\nthe Pipinian and Ramusian editions as _Cobinam_ or _Cobinan_. _Both\r\nforms are found in the Geographic Text_.\r\n\r\nThe city of the Great Kaan (Khanbalig) is called in the Pauthier MSS.\r\n_Cambaluc_, in the Pipinian and Ramusian less correctly _Cambalu_.\r\n_Both forms appear in the Geographic Text_.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal People on the Burmese Frontier who received from the\r\nWestern officers of the Mongols the Persian name (translated from that\r\napplied by the Chinese) of _Zardandán_, or Gold-Teeth, appear in the\r\nPauthier MSS. most accurately as Zardandan, but in the Pipinian as\r\n_Ardandan_ (still further corrupted in some copies into _Arcladam_).\r\nNow _both forms are found in the Geographic Text_. Other examples might\r\nbe given, but these I think may suffice to prove that this Text was the\r\ncommon source of both classes.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the French original too we must remember\r\nwhat has been already said regarding Rusticien de Pise and his other\r\nFrench writings; and we shall find hereafter an express testimony borne\r\nin the next generation that Marco’s Book was composed _in vulgari\r\nGallico_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greatly diffused employment of French in that age.]\r\n\r\n54. But, after all, the circumstantial evidence that has been adduced\r\nfrom the texts themselves is the most conclusive. We have then every\r\nreason to believe both that the work was written in French, and that\r\nan existing French Text is a close representation of it as originally\r\ncommitted to paper. And that being so we may cite some circumstances\r\nto show that the use of French or quasi-French for the purpose was not\r\na fact of a very unusual or surprising nature. The French language had\r\nat that time almost as wide, perhaps relatively a wider, diffusion than\r\nit has now. It was still spoken at the Court of England, and still\r\nused by many English writers, of whom the authors or translators of\r\nthe Round Table Romances at Henry III.’s Court are examples.[7] In\r\n1249 Alexander III. King of Scotland, at his coronation spoke in Latin\r\nand French; and in 1291 the English Chancellor addressing the Scotch\r\nParliament did so in French. At certain of the Oxford Colleges as late\r\nas 1328 it was an order that the students should converse _colloquio\r\nlatino vel saltem gallico_.[8] Late in the same century Gower had not\r\nceased to use French, composing many poems in it, though apologizing\r\nfor his want of skill therein:—\r\n\r\n    “Et si jeo nai de François la faconde\r\n         *       *        *       *\r\n     Jeo suis Englois; si quier par tiele voie\r\n     Estre excusé.”[9]\r\n\r\nIndeed down to nearly 1385, boys in the English grammar-schools\r\nwere taught to construe their Latin lessons into French.[10] St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi is said by some of his biographers to have had his\r\noriginal name changed to Francesco because of his early mastery of\r\nthat language as a qualification for commerce. French had been the\r\nprevalent tongue of the Crusaders, and was that of the numerous Frank\r\nCourts which they established in the East, including Jerusalem and\r\nthe states of the Syrian coast, Cyprus, Constantinople during the\r\nreign of the Courtenays, and the principalities of the Morea. The\r\nCatalan soldier and chronicler Ramon de Muntaner tells us that it was\r\ncommonly said of the Morean chivalry that they spoke as good French as\r\nat Paris.[11] Quasi-French at least was still spoken half a century\r\nlater by the numerous Christians settled at Aleppo, as John Marignolli\r\ntestifies;[12] and if we may trust Sir John Maundevile the Soldan\r\nof Egypt himself and four of his chief Lords “_spak Frensche righte\r\nwel!_”[13] Gházán Kaan, the accomplished Mongol Sovereign of Persia,\r\nto whom our Traveller conveyed a bride from Cambaluc, is said by the\r\nhistorian Rashiduddin to have known something of the Frank tongue,\r\nprobably French.[14] Nay, if we may trust the author of the Romance\r\nof Richard Cœur-de-Lion, French was in his day the language of still\r\nhigher spheres![15]\r\n\r\nNor was Polo’s case an exceptional one even among writers on the East\r\nwho were not Frenchmen. Maundevile himself tells us that he put his\r\nbook first “out of Latyn into Frensche,” and then out of French into\r\nEnglish.[16] The History of the East which the Armenian Prince and Monk\r\nHayton dictated to Nicolas Faulcon at Poictiers in 1307 was taken down\r\nin French. There are many other instances of the employment of French\r\nby foreign, and especially by Italian authors of that age. The Latin\r\nchronicle of the Benedictine Amato of Monte Cassino was translated into\r\nFrench early in the 13th century by another monk of the same abbey, at\r\nthe particular desire of the Count of Militrée (or Malta), “_Pour ce\r\nqu’il set lire et entendre fransoize et s’en delitte._”[17] Martino da\r\nCanale, a countryman and contemporary of Polo’s, during the absence\r\nof the latter in the East wrote a Chronicle of Venice in the same\r\nlanguage, as a reason for which he alleges its general popularity.[18]\r\nThe like does the most notable example of all, Brunetto Latini, Dante’s\r\nmaster, who wrote in French his encyclopædic and once highly popular\r\nwork _Li Tresor_.[19] Other examples might be given, but in fact such\r\nillustration is superfluous when we consider that Rusticiano himself\r\nwas a compiler of French Romances.\r\n\r\nBut why the language of the Book as we see it in the Geographic Text\r\nshould be so much more rude, inaccurate, and Italianized than that of\r\nRusticiano’s other writings, is a question to which I can suggest no\r\nreply quite satisfactory to myself. Is it possible that we have in it a\r\nliteral representation of Polo’s own language in dictating the story,—a\r\nrough draft which it was intended afterwards to reduce to better form,\r\nand which was so reduced (after a fashion) in French copies of another\r\ntype, regarding which we shall have to speak presently?[20] And, if\r\nthis be the true answer, why should Polo have used a French jargon in\r\nwhich to tell his story? Is it possible that his own mother Venetian,\r\nsuch as he had carried to the East with him and brought back again,\r\nwas so little intelligible to Rusticiano that French of some kind was\r\nthe handiest medium of communication between the two? I have known\r\nan Englishman and a Hollander driven to converse in Malay; Chinese\r\nChristians of different provinces are said sometimes to take to English\r\nas the readiest means of intercommunication; and the same is said even\r\nof Irish-speaking Irishmen from remote parts of the Island.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark how many notable narratives of the Middle Ages\r\nhave been dictated instead of being written by their authors, and\r\nthat in cases where it is impossible to ascribe this to ignorance\r\nof writing. The Armenian Hayton, though evidently a well-read man,\r\npossibly could not write in Roman characters. But Joinville is an\r\nillustrious example. And the narratives of four of the most famous\r\nMediæval Travellers[21] seem to have been drawn from them by a kind\r\nof pressure, and committed to paper by other hands. I have elsewhere\r\nremarked this as indicating how little diffused was literary ambition\r\nor vanity; but it would perhaps be more correct to ascribe it to that\r\nintense dislike which is still seen on the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nto the use of pen and ink. On certain of those shores at least there\r\nis scarcely any inconvenience that the majority of respectable and\r\ngood-natured people will not tolerate—inconvenience to their neighbours\r\nbe it understood—rather than put pen to paper for the purpose of\r\npreventing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] 232 chapters in the oldest French which we quote as the _Geographic\r\n    Text_ (or G. T.), 200 in Pauthier’s Text, 183 in the Crusca Italian.\r\n\r\n[2] The MS. has been printed by Baldelli as above, and again by Bartoli\r\n    in 1863.\r\n\r\n[3] This is somewhat peculiar. I traced a few lines of it, which with\r\n    Del Riccio’s note were given in facsimile in the First Edition.\r\n\r\n[4] The Crusca is cited from Bartoli’s edition.\r\n\r\n    French idioms are frequent, as _l’uomo_ for the French _on_;\r\n    _quattro-vinti_ instead of _ottanta_; etc.\r\n\r\n    We have at p. 35, “_Questo piano è molto_ cavo,” which is nonsense,\r\n    but is explained by reference to the French (G. T.) “_Voz di qu’il\r\n    est celle plaingne mout_ chaue” (_chaude_).\r\n\r\n    The bread in Kerman is bitter, says the G. T. “_por ce que l’eive\r\n    hi est_ amer,” because the water there is bitter. The Crusca\r\n    mistakes the last word and renders (p. 40) “_e questi è per lo_\r\n    mare _che vi viene_.”\r\n\r\n    “_Sachiés de voir qe_ endementiers,” know for a truth that\r\n    whilst——, by some misunderstanding of the last word becomes (p.\r\n    129) “_Sappiate di vero_ sanza mentire.”\r\n\r\n    “_Mès de sel_ font-il monoie”—“They make money of salt,” becomes\r\n    (p. 168) “_ma fannole_ da loro,” _sel_ being taken for a pronoun,\r\n    whilst in another place _sel_ is transferred bodily without\r\n    translation.\r\n\r\n    “_Chevoil_,” “hair” of the old French, appears in the Tuscan (p.\r\n    20) as _cavagli_, “horses.”—“_La Grant Provence_ Jereraus,” the\r\n    great general province, appears (p. 68) as a province whose proper\r\n    name is _Ienaraus_. In describing Kúblái’s expedition against Mien\r\n    or Burma, Polo has a story of his calling on the Jugglers at his\r\n    court to undertake the job, promising them a Captain and other\r\n    help, “_Cheveitain et aide_.” This has fairly puzzled the Tuscan,\r\n    who converts these (p. 186) into two Tartar tribes, “_quegli\r\n    d’_Aide _e quegli di_ Caveità.”\r\n\r\n    So also we have _lievre_ for hare transferred without change;\r\n    _lait_, milk, appearing as _laido_ instead of _latte_; _très_,\r\n    rendered as “three”; _bue_, “mud,” Italianised as _buoi_, “oxen,”\r\n    and so forth. Finally, in various places when Polo is explaining\r\n    Oriental terms we find in the Tuscan MS. “_cioè a dire in_\r\n    Francesco.”\r\n\r\n    The blunders mentioned are intelligible enough as in a version\r\n    _from the French_; but in the description of the Indian\r\n    pearl-fishery we have a startling one not so easy to account for.\r\n    The French says, “the divers gather the sea-oysters (_hostrige de\r\n    Mer_), and in these the pearls are found.” This appears in the\r\n    Tuscan in the extraordinary form that the divers catch those fishes\r\n    called _Herrings_ (Aringhe), and in those Herrings are found the\r\n    Pearls!\r\n\r\n[5] As examples of these Italianisms: “_Et ont del_ olio _de la lanpe\r\n    dou_ sepolchro _de Crist_”; “_L’Angel ven en vision pour mesajes\r\n    de Deu à un_ Veschevo _qe mout estoient home de_ sante vite”;\r\n    “_E certes il estoit bien_ beizongno”; “_ne trop caut ne trop_\r\n    fredo”; “_la_ crense” (_credenza_); “remort” for noise (_rumore_);\r\n    “inverno”; “jorno”; “dementiqué” (_dimenticato_); “enferme” for\r\n    sickly; “leign” (_legno_); “devisce” (_dovizia_); “ammalaide”\r\n    (_ammalato_), etc. etc.\r\n\r\n    Professor Bianconi points out that there are also traces of\r\n    _Venetian_ dialect, as _Pare_ for _père_; _Mojer_ for wife;\r\n    _Zabater_, cobbler; _cazaor_, huntsman, etc.\r\n\r\n    I have not been able to learn to what extent books in this kind\r\n    of mixed language are extant. I have observed one, a romance in\r\n    verse called _Macaire_ (_Altfranzösische Gedichte aus Venez.\r\n    Handschriften_, von _Adolf Mussafia_, Wien, 1864), the language of\r\n    which is not unlike this jargon of Rustician’s, _e.g._:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Dama,’ fait-il, ‘molto me poso merviler De ves enfant quant le fi\r\n    batecer De un signo qe le vi sor la spal’a droiturer Qe non ait nul\r\n    se no filz d’inperer.’”—(p. 41)\r\n\r\n[6] As examples of such Orientalisms: _Bonus_, “ebony,” and _calamanz_,\r\n    “pencases,” seem to represent the Persian _abnús_ and _ḳalamdàn_;\r\n    the dead are mourned by _les mères et les_ Araines, the _Harems_;\r\n    in speaking of the land of the Ismaelites or Assassins, called\r\n    _Mulhete_, _i.e._ the Arabic _Muláhidah_, “Heretics,” he explains\r\n    this term as meaning “des _Aram_” (_Ḥarám_, “the reprobate”).\r\n    Speaking of the Viceroys of Chinese Provinces, we are told that\r\n    they rendered their accounts yearly to the _Safators_ of the\r\n    Great Kaan. This is certainly an Oriental word. Sir H. Rawlinson\r\n    has suggested that it stands for _dafátir_ (“registers or public\r\n    books”), pl. of _daftar_. This seems probable, and in that case the\r\n    true reading may have been _dafators_.\r\n\r\n[7] Luces du Gast, one of the first of these, introduces himself thus:—\r\n    “Je Luces, Chevaliers et Sires du Chastel du Gast, voisins prochain\r\n    de Salebieres, comme chevaliers amoureus enprens à translater du\r\n    Latin en François une partie de cette estoire, non mie pour ce que\r\n    je sache gramment de François, ainz apartient plus ma langue et ma\r\n    parleure à la manière de l’Engleterre que à celle de France, comme\r\n    cel qui fu en Engleterre nez, mais tele est ma volentez et mon\r\n    proposement, que je en langue françoise le translaterai.” (_Hist.\r\n    Litt. de La France_, xv. 494.)\r\n\r\n[8] _Hist.

VARIOUS TYPES OF TEXT OF MARCO POLO’S BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four Principal Types of Text. First, that of the Geographic,\r\nor oldest French.]\r\n\r\n55. In treating of the various Texts of Polo’s Book we must necessarily\r\ngo into some irksome detail.\r\n\r\nThose Texts that have come down to us may be classified under Four\r\nprincipal Types.\r\n\r\nI. The First Type is that of the Geographic Text of which we have\r\nalready said so much. This is found nowhere _complete_ except in the\r\nunique MS. of the Paris Library, to which it is stated to have come\r\nfrom the old Library of the French Kings at Blois. But the Italian\r\n_Crusca_, and the old Latin version (No. 3195 of the Paris Library)\r\npublished with the Geographic Text, are evidently derived entirely from\r\nit, though both are considerably abridged. It is also demonstrable that\r\nneither of these copies has been translated from the other, for each\r\nhas passages which the other omits, but that both have been taken, the\r\none as a copy more or less loose, the other as a translation, from an\r\nintermediate _Italian_ copy.[1] A special difference lies in the fact\r\nthat the Latin version is divided into three Books, whilst the Crusca\r\nhas no such division. I shall show in a tabular form the _filiation_ of\r\nthe texts which these facts seem to demonstrate (see Appendix G).\r\n\r\nThere are other Italian MSS. of this type, some of which show signs of\r\nhaving been derived independently from the French;[2] but I have not\r\nbeen able to examine any of them with the care needful to make specific\r\ndeductions regarding them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second; the remodelled French Text, followed by Pauthier.]\r\n\r\n56. II. The next Type is that of the French MSS. on which M. Pauthier’s\r\nText is based, and for which he claims the highest authority, as having\r\nhad the mature revision and sanction of the Traveller. There are, as\r\nfar as I know, five MSS. which may be classed together under this type,\r\nthree in the Great Paris Library, one at Bern, and one in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\nThe high claims made by Pauthier on behalf of this class of MSS. (on\r\nthe first three of which his Text is formed) rest mainly upon the kind\r\nof certificate which two of them bear regarding the presentation of a\r\ncopy by Marco Polo to Thibault de Cepoy, which we have already quoted\r\n(_supra_, p. _69_). This certificate is held by Pauthier to imply that\r\nthe original of the copies which bear it, and of those having a general\r\ncorrespondence with them, had the special seal of Marco’s revision and\r\napproval. To some considerable extent their character is corroborative\r\nof such a claim, but they are far from having the perfection which\r\nPauthier attributes to them, and which leads him into many paradoxes.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to interpret rigidly the bearing of this so-called\r\ncertificate, as if no copies had previously been taken of _any_ form\r\nof the Book; nor can we allow it to impugn the authenticity of the\r\nGeographic Text, which demonstratively represents an older original,\r\nand has been (as we have seen) the parent of all other versions,\r\nincluding some very old ones, Italian and Latin, which certainly owe\r\nnothing to this revision.\r\n\r\nThe first idea apparently entertained by d’Avezac and Paulin Paris was\r\nthat the Geographic Text was _itself_ the copy given to the Sieur de\r\nCepoy, and that the differences in the copies of the class which we\r\ndescribe as Type II. merely resulted from the modifications which would\r\nnaturally arise in the process of transcription into purer French.\r\nBut closer examination showed the differences to be too great and too\r\nmarked to admit of this explanation. These differences consist not\r\nonly in the conversion of the rude, obscure, and half Italian language\r\nof the original into good French of the period. There is also very\r\nconsiderable curtailment, generally of tautology, but also extending\r\noften to circumstances of substantial interest; whilst we observe the\r\nomission of a few notably erroneous statements or expressions; and a\r\nfew insertions of small importance. None of the MSS. of this class\r\ncontain more than a few of the historical chapters which we have formed\r\ninto Book IV.\r\n\r\nThe only _addition_ of any magnitude is that chapter which in our\r\ntranslation forms chapter xxi. of Book II. It will be seen that\r\nit contains no new facts, but is only a tedious recapitulation of\r\ncircumstances already stated, though scattered over several chapters.\r\nThere are a few minor additions. I have not thought it worth while to\r\ncollect them systematically here, but two or three examples are given\r\nin a note.[3]\r\n\r\nThere are also one or two corrections of erroneous statements in the\r\nG. T. which seem not to be accidental and to indicate some attempt at\r\nrevision. Thus a notable error in the account of Aden, which seems to\r\nconceive of the Red Sea as a _river_, disappears in Pauthier’s MSS.\r\nA and B.[4] And we find in these MSS. one or two interesting names\r\npreserved which are not found in the older Text.[5]\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand this class of MSS. contains many erroneous\r\nreadings of names, either adopting the worse of two forms occurring in\r\nthe G. T. or originating blunders of its own.[6]\r\n\r\nM. Pauthier lays great stress on the character of these MSS. as\r\nthe sole authentic form of the work, from their claim to have been\r\nspecially revised by Marco Polo. It is evident, however, from what has\r\nbeen said, that this revision can have been only a very careless and\r\nsuperficial one, and must have been done in great measure by deputy,\r\nbeing almost entirely confined to curtailment and to the improvement of\r\nthe expression, and that it is by no means such as to allow an editor\r\nto dispense with a careful study of the Older Text.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bern MS. and two others form a sub-class of this Type.]\r\n\r\n57. There is another curious circumstance about the MSS. of this\r\ntype, viz., that they clearly divide into two distinct recensions,\r\nof which both have so many peculiarities and errors in common that\r\nthey must necessarily have been both derived from _one_ modification\r\nof the original text, whilst at the same time there are such\r\ndifferences between the two as cannot be set down to the accidents of\r\ntranscription. Pauthier’s MSS. A and B (Nos. 16 and 15 of the List\r\nin App. F) form one of these subdivisions: his C (No. 17 of List),\r\nBern (No. 56), and Oxford (No. 6), the other. Between A and B the\r\ndifferences are only such as seem constantly to have arisen from the\r\nwhims of transcribers or their dialectic peculiarities. But between\r\nA and B on the one side, and C on the other, the differences are\r\nmuch greater. The readings of proper names in C are often superior,\r\nsometimes worse; but in the latter half of the work especially it\r\ncontains a number of substantial passages[7] which are to be found in\r\nthe G. T., but are altogether absent from the MSS. A and B; whilst in\r\none case at least (the history of the Siege of Saianfu, vol. ii. p.\r\n159) it diverges considerably from the G. T. _as well_ as from A and\r\nB.[8]\r\n\r\nI gather from the facts that the MS. C represents an older form of the\r\nwork than A and B. I should judge that the latter had been derived from\r\nthat older form, but intentionally modified from it. And as it is the\r\nMS. C, with its copy at Bern, that alone presents the certificate of\r\nderivation from the Book given to the Sieur de Cepoy, there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is the true representative of that recension.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third; Friar Pipino’s Latin.]\r\n\r\n58. III. The next Type of Text is that found in Friar Pipino’s Latin\r\nversion. It is the type of which MSS. are by far the most numerous.\r\nIn it condensation and curtailment are carried a good deal further\r\nthan in Type II. The work is also divided into three Books. But this\r\ndivision does not seem to have originated with Pipino, as we find it\r\nin the ruder and perhaps older Latin version of which we have already\r\nspoken under Type I. And we have demonstrated that this ruder Latin is\r\na translation from an Italian copy. It is probable therefore that an\r\nItalian version similarly divided was the common source of what we call\r\nthe Geographic Latin and of Pipino’s more condensed version.[9]\r\n\r\nPipino’s version appears to have been executed in the later years of\r\nPolo’s life.[10] But I can see no ground for the idea entertained by\r\nBaldelli-Boni and Professor Bianconi that it was executed with Polo’s\r\ncognizance and retouched by him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Latin of Grynæus a translation at fifth hand.]\r\n\r\n59. The absence of effective publication in the Middle Ages led to a\r\ncurious complication of translation and retranslation. Thus the Latin\r\nversion published by Grynæus in the _Novus Orbis_ (Basle, 1532) is\r\ndifferent from Pipino’s, and yet clearly traceable to it as a base.\r\nIn fact it is a retranslation into Latin from some version (Marsden\r\nthinks the printed Portuguese one) of Pipino. It introduces many minor\r\nmodifications, omitting specific statements of numbers and values,\r\ngeneralizing the names and descriptions of specific animals, exhibiting\r\nfrequent sciolism and self-sufficiency in modifying statements which\r\nthe Editor disbelieved.[11] It is therefore utterly worthless as a\r\nText, and it is curious that Andreas Müller, who in the 17th century\r\ndevoted himself to the careful editing of Polo, should have made so\r\nunfortunate a choice as to reproduce this fifth-hand Translation. I\r\nmay add that the French editions published in the middle of the 16th\r\ncentury are _translations_ from Grynæus. Hence they complete this\r\ncurious and vicious circle of translation: French—Italian—Pipino’s\r\nLatin—Portuguese?—Grynæus’s Latin—French![12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fourth; Ramusio’s Italian.]\r\n\r\n60. IV. We now come to a Type of Text which deviates largely from\r\nany of those hitherto spoken of, and the history and true character\r\nof which are involved in a cloud of difficulty. We mean that Italian\r\nversion prepared for the press by G. B. Ramusio, with most interesting,\r\nthough, as we have seen, not always accurate preliminary dissertations,\r\nand published at Venice two years after his death, in the second volume\r\nof the _Navigationi e Viaggi_.[13]\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of this version are very remarkable. Ramusio seems\r\nto imply that he used as one basis at least the Latin of Pipino; and\r\nmany circumstances, such as the division into Books, the absence of\r\nthe terminal historical chapters and of those about the Magi, and\r\nthe form of many proper names, confirm this. But also many additional\r\ncircumstances and anecdotes are introduced, many of the names assume\r\na new shape, and the whole style is more copious and literary in\r\ncharacter than in any other form of the work.\r\n\r\nWhilst some of the changes or interpolations seem to carry us further\r\nfrom the truth, others contain facts of Asiatic nature or history, as\r\nwell as of Polo’s own experiences, which it is extremely difficult to\r\nascribe to any hand but the Traveller’s own. This was the view taken\r\nby Baldelli, Klaproth, and Neumann;[14] but Hugh Murray, Lazari, and\r\nBartoli regard the changes as interpolations by another hand; and\r\nLazari is rash enough to ascribe the whole to a _rifacimento_ of\r\nRamusio’s own age, asserting it to contain interpolations not merely\r\nfrom Polo’s own contemporary Hayton, but also from travellers of later\r\ncenturies, such as Conti, Barbosa, and Pigafetta. The grounds for these\r\nlast assertions have not been cited, nor can I trace them. But I admit\r\n_to a certain extent_ indications of modern tampering with the text,\r\nespecially in cases where proper names seem to have been identified\r\nand more modern forms substituted. In days, however, where an Editor’s\r\nduties were ill understood, this was natural.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Injudicious tamperings in Ramusio.]\r\n\r\n61. Thus we find substituted for the _Bastra_ (or _Bascra_) of the\r\nolder texts the more modern and incorrect _Balsora_, dear to memories\r\nof the Arabian Nights; among the provinces of Persia we have _Spaan_\r\n(Ispahan) where older texts read _Istanit_; for _Cormos_ we have\r\n_Ormus_; for _Herminia_ and _Laias_, _Armenia_ and _Giazza_; _Coulam_\r\nfor the older _Coilum_; _Socotera_ for _Scotra_. With these changes may\r\nbe classed the chapter-headings, which are undisguisedly modern, and\r\nprobably Ramusio’s own. In some other cases this editorial spirit has\r\nbeen over-meddlesome and has gone astray. Thus _Malabar_ is substituted\r\nwrongly for _Maabar_ in one place, and by a grosser error for _Dalivar_\r\nin another. The age of young Marco, at the time of his father’s first\r\nreturn to Venice, has been arbitrarily altered from 15 to 19, in\r\norder to correspond with a date which is itself erroneous. Thus also\r\nPolo is made to describe Ormus as on an Island, contrary to the old\r\ntexts and to the fact; for the city of Hormuz was not transferred to\r\nthe island, afterwards so famous, till some years after Polo’s return\r\nfrom the East. It is probably also the editor who in the notice of\r\nthe oil-springs of Caucasus (i. p. 46) has substituted _camel-loads_\r\nfor _ship-loads_, in ignorance that the site of those alluded to was\r\nprobably Baku on the Caspian.\r\n\r\nOther erroneous statements, such as the introduction of window-glass as\r\none of the embellishments of the palace at Cambaluc, are probably due\r\nonly to accidental misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Genuine statements peculiar to Ramusio.]\r\n\r\n62. Of circumstances certainly genuine, which are peculiar to this\r\nedition of Polo’s work, and which it is difficult to assign to any\r\none but himself, we may note the specification of the woods east of\r\nYezd as composed of _date trees_ (vol. i pp. 88–89); the unmistakable\r\nallusion to the subterranean irrigation channels of Persia (p. 123);\r\nthe accurate explanation of the term _Mulehet_ applied to the sect of\r\nAssassins (pp. 139–142); the mention of the Lake (Sirikul?) on the\r\nplateau of Pamer, of the wolves that prey on the wild sheep, and of the\r\npiles of wild rams’ horns used as landmarks in the snow (pp. 171–177).\r\nTo the description of the Tibetan Yak, which is in all the texts,\r\nRamusio’s version alone adds a fact probably not recorded again till\r\nthe present century, viz., that it is the practice to cross the Yak\r\nwith the common cow (p. 274). Ramusio alone notices the prevalence of\r\n_goître_ at Yarkand, confirmed by recent travellers (i. p. 187); the\r\nvermilion seal of the Great Kaan imprinted on the paper-currency, which\r\nmay be seen in our plate of a Chinese note (p. 426); the variation in\r\nChinese dialects (ii. p. 236); the division of the hulls of junks into\r\nwater-tight compartments (ii. p. 249); the introduction into China from\r\nEgypt of the art of refining sugar (ii. p. 226). Ramusio’s account of\r\nthe position of the city of Sindafu (Ch’êng-tu fu) encompassed and\r\nintersected by many branches of a great river (ii. p. 40), is much\r\nmore just than that in the old text, which speaks of but one river\r\nthrough the middle of the city. The intelligent notices of the Kaan’s\r\ncharities as originated by his adoption of “idolatry” or Buddhism; of\r\nthe astrological superstitions of the Chinese, and of the manners and\r\ncharacter of the latter nation, are found in Ramusio alone. To whom but\r\nMarco himself, or one of his party, can we refer the brief but vivid\r\npicture of the delicious atmosphere and scenery of the Badakhshan\r\nplateaux (i. p. 158), and of the benefit that Messer Marco’s health\r\nderived from a visit to them? In this version alone again we have an\r\naccount of the oppressions exercised by Kúblái’s Mahomedan Minister\r\nAhmad, telling how the Cathayans rose against him and murdered him,\r\nwith the addition that Messer Marco was on the spot when all this\r\nhappened. Now not only is the whole story in substantial accordance\r\nwith the Chinese Annals, even to the name of the chief conspirator,[15]\r\nbut those annals also tell of the courageous frankness of “Polo,\r\nassessor of the Privy Council,” in opening the Kaan’s eyes to the truth.\r\n\r\nMany more such examples might be adduced, but these will suffice. It\r\nis true that many of the passages peculiar to the Ramusian version,\r\nand indeed the whole version, show a freer utterance and more of a\r\nliterary faculty than we should attribute to Polo, judging from the\r\nearlier texts. It is possible, however, that this may be almost, if not\r\nentirely, due to the fact that the version is the result of a double\r\ntranslation, and probably of an editorial fusion of several documents;\r\nprocesses in which angularities of expression would be dissolved.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hypothesis of the sources of the Ramusian Version.]\r\n\r\n63. Though difficulties will certainly remain,[17] the most probable\r\nexplanation of the origin of this text seems to me to be some such\r\nhypothesis as the following:—I suppose that Polo in his latter years\r\nadded with his own hand supplementary notes and reminiscences,\r\nmarginally or otherwise, to a copy of his book; that these, perhaps\r\nin his lifetime, more probably after his death, were digested and\r\ntranslated into Latin;[18] and that Ramusio, or some friend of his,\r\nin retranslating and fusing them with Pipino’s version for the\r\n_Navigationi_, made those minor modifications in names and other\r\nmatters which we have already noticed. The mere facts of digestion\r\nfrom memoranda and double translation would account for a good deal of\r\nunintentional corruption.\r\n\r\nThat more than one version was employed in the composition of Ramusio’s\r\nedition we have curious proof in at least one passage of the latter.\r\nWe have pointed out at p. 410 of this volume a curious example of\r\nmisunderstanding of the old French Text, a passage in which the term\r\n_Roi des Pelaines_, or “King of Furs,” is applied to the Sable, and\r\nwhich in the Crusca has been converted into an imaginary Tartar phrase\r\n_Leroide pelame_, or as Pipino makes it _Rondes_ (another indication\r\nthat Pipino’s Version and the Crusca passed through a common medium).\r\nBut Ramusio exhibits _both_ the true reading and the perversion: “_E li\r\nTartari la chiamano_ Regina delle pelli” (there is the true reading),\r\n“_E gli animali si chiamano_ Rondes” (and there the perverted one).\r\n\r\nWe may further remark that Ramusio’s version betrays indications that\r\none of its bases either was in the Venetian dialect, or had passed\r\nthrough that dialect; for a good many of the names appear in Venetian\r\nforms, _e.g._, substituting the _z_ for the sound of _ch_, _j_, or\r\nsoft _g_, as in _Goza_, _Zorzania_, _Zagatay_, _Gonza_ (for Giogiu),\r\n_Quenzanfu_, _Coiganzu_, _Tapinzu_, _Zipangu_, _Ziamba_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary in regard to Text of Polo.]\r\n\r\n64. To sum up. It is, I think, beyond reasonable dispute that we\r\nhave, in what we call the Geographic Text, as nearly as may be an\r\nexact transcript of the Traveller’s words as originally taken down in\r\nthe prison of Genoa. We have again in the MSS. of the second type an\r\nedition pruned and refined, probably under instructions from Marco\r\nPolo, but not with any critical exactness. And lastly, I believe,\r\nthat we have, imbedded in the Ramusian edition, the supplementary\r\nrecollections of the Traveller, noted down at a later period of his\r\nlife, but perplexed by repeated translation, compilation, and editorial\r\nmishandling.\r\n\r\nAnd the most important remaining problem in regard to the text of\r\nPolo’s work is the discovery of the supplemental manuscript from which\r\nRamusio derived those passages which are found only in his edition. It\r\nis possible that it may still exist, but no trace of it in anything\r\nlike completeness has yet been found; though when my task was all but\r\ndone I discovered a small part of the Ramusian peculiarities in a MS.\r\nat Venice.[19]\r\n\r\n65. Whilst upon this subject of manuscripts of our Author, I will give\r\nsome particulars regarding a very curious one, containing a version in\r\nthe _Irish_ language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notice of a curious Irish Version of Polo.]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable document is found in the _Book of Lismore_, belonging\r\nto the Duke of Devonshire. That magnificent book, finely written on\r\nvellum of the largest size, was discovered in 1814, enclosed in a\r\nwooden box, along with a superb crozier, on opening a closed doorway in\r\nthe castle of Lismore. It contained Lives of the Saints, the (Romance)\r\nHistory of Charlemagne, the History of the Lombards, histories and\r\ntales of Irish wars, etc., etc., and among the other matter this\r\nversion of Marco Polo. A full account of the Book and its mutilations\r\nwill be found in _O’Curry’s Lectures on the MS. Materials of Ancient\r\nIrish History_, p. 196 _seqq._, Dublin, 1861. The _Book of Lismore_\r\nwas written about 1460 for Finghin MacCarthy and his wife Catharine\r\nFitzgerald, daughter of Gerald, Eighth Earl of Desmond.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Translation of Polo is not known, but it may be\r\nsupposed to have been executed about the above date, probably in the\r\nMonastery of Lismore (county of Waterford).\r\n\r\nFrom the extracts that have been translated for me, it is obvious that\r\nthe version was made, with an astounding freedom certainly, from Friar\r\nFrancesco Pipino’s Latin.\r\n\r\nBoth beginning and end are missing. But what remains opens thus;\r\ncompare it with Friar Pipino’s real prologue as we give it in the\r\nAppendix![20]\r\n\r\n  [Irish text] &c.\r\n\r\n  ——“Kings and chieftains of that city. There was then in the city a\r\n  princely Friar in the habit of St. Francis, named Franciscus, who\r\n  was versed in many languages. He was brought to the place where\r\n  those nobles were, and they requested of him to translate the book\r\n  from the Tartar (!) into the Latin language. ‘It is an abomination\r\n  to me,’ said he, ‘to devote my mind or labour to works of Idolatry\r\n  and Irreligion.’ They entreated him again. ‘It shall be done,’ said\r\n  he; ‘for though it be an irreligious narrative that is related\r\n  therein, yet the things are miracles of the True God; and every one\r\n  who hears this much against the Holy Faith shall pray fervently for\r\n  their conversion. And he who will not pray shall waste the vigour\r\n  of his body to convert them.’ I am not in dread of this Book of\r\n  Marcus, for there is no lie in it. My eyes beheld him bringing the\r\n  relics of the holy Church with him, and he left [his testimony],\r\n  whilst tasting of death, that it was true. And Marcus was a devout\r\n  man. What is there in it, then, but that Franciscus translated this\r\n  Book of Marcus from the Tartar into Latin; and the years of the\r\n  Lord at that time were fifteen years, two score, two hundred, and\r\n  one thousand” (1255).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt then describes _Armein Bec_ (Little Armenia), _Armein Mor_ (Great\r\nArmenia), _Musul_, _Taurisius_, _Persida_, _Camandi_, and so forth. The\r\nlast chapter is that on _Abaschia_:—\r\n\r\n  “ABASCHIA also is an extensive country, under the government of\r\n  Seven  Kings, four of whom worship the true God, and each of them\r\n  wears a golden cross on the forehead; and they are valiant in\r\n  battle, having been brought up fighting against the Gentiles of\r\n  the other three kings, who are Unbelievers and Idolaters. And the\r\n  kingdom of ADEN; a Soudan rules over them.\r\n\r\n  “The king of Abaschia once took a notion to make a pilgrimage to\r\n  the Sepulchre of Jesus. ‘Not at all,’ said his nobles and warriors\r\n  to him, ‘for we should be afraid lest the infidels through whose\r\n  territories you would have to pass, should kill you. There is a\r\n  Holy Bishop with you,’ said they; ‘send him to the Sepulchre of\r\n  Jesus, and much gold with him’”——\r\n\r\nThe rest is wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] In the following citations, the Geographic Text (G.

T. “_Lequel fist\r\n    faire_ jadis _un rois qe fu apellés le Roi Dor_,” renders “_Lo\r\n    quale fa fare_ Jaddis _uno re_,” a mistake which is not in the\r\n    Crusca nor in the Latin, and seems to imply derivation from the\r\n    French directly, or by some other channel (_Baldelli Boni_).\r\n\r\n[3] In the Prologue (vol. i. p. 34) this class of MSS. alone names the\r\n    King of England.\r\n\r\n    In the account of the Battle with Nayan (i. p. 337) this class\r\n    alone speaks of the two-stringed instruments which the Tartars\r\n    played whilst awaiting the signal for battle. But the circumstance\r\n    appears elsewhere in the G. T. (p. 250).\r\n\r\n    In the chapter on _Malabar_ (vol. ii. p. 390), it is said that the\r\n    ships which go with cargoes towards Alexandria are not one-tenth of\r\n    those that go to the further East. This is not in the older French.\r\n\r\n    In the chapter on _Coilun_ (ii. p. 375), we have a notice of the\r\n    Columbine ginger so celebrated in the Middle Ages, which is also\r\n    absent from the older text.\r\n\r\n[4] See vol. ii. p. 439. It is, however, remarkable that a like mistake\r\n    is made about the Persian Gulf (see i. 63, 64). Perhaps Polo\r\n    _thought_ in Persian, in which the word _darya_ means either _sea_\r\n    or a _large river_. The same habit and the ambiguity of the Persian\r\n    _sher_ led him probably to his confusion of lions and tigers (see\r\n    i. 397).\r\n\r\n[5] Such are Pasciai-_Dir_ and _Ariora_ Kesciemur (i. p. 98.)\r\n\r\n[6] Thus the MSS. of this type have elected the erroneous readings\r\n    _Bolgara, Cogatra, Chiato, Cabanant_, etc., instead of the\r\n    correcter _Bolgana, Cocacin, Quiacatu, Cobinan_, where the G. T.\r\n    presents both (_supra_, p. _86_). They read _Esanar_ for the\r\n    correct _Etzina_; _Chascun_ for _Casvin_; _Achalet_ for _Acbalec_;\r\n    _Sardansu_ for _Sindafu_, _Kayteu, Kayton, Sarcon_ for _Zaiton_ or\r\n    _Caiton_; _Soucat_ for _Locac_; _Falec_ for _Ferlec_, and so on,\r\n    the worse instead of the better. They make the _Mer Occeane_ into\r\n    _Mer Occident_; the wild asses (_asnes_) of the Kerman Desert into\r\n    wild geese (_oes_); the _escoillez_ of Bengal (ii. p. 115) into\r\n    _escoliers_; the _giraffes_ of Africa into _girofles_, or cloves,\r\n    etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[7] There are about five-and-thirty such passages altogether.\r\n\r\n[8] The Bern MS. I have satisfied myself is an actual _copy_ of the\r\n    Paris MS. C.\r\n\r\n    The Oxford MS. closely resembles both, but I have not made the\r\n    comparison minutely enough to say if it is an exact copy of either.\r\n\r\n[9] The following comparison will also show that these two Latin\r\n    versions have probably had a common source, such as is here\r\n    suggested.\r\n\r\n    At the end of the Prologue the Geographic Text reads simply:—\r\n\r\n    “Or puis que je voz ai contez tot le fat dou prolegue ensi con voz\r\n    avés oï, adonc (commencerai) le Livre.”\r\n\r\n    Whilst the Geographic Latin has:—\r\n\r\n    “_Postquam recitavimus et diximus facta et condictiones morum,\r\n    itinerum_ et ea quae nobis contigerunt per vias, _incipiemus dicere\r\n    ea quae vidimus. Et primo dicemus de Minore Hermenia_.”\r\n\r\n    And Pipino:—\r\n\r\n    “_Narratione facta nostri itineris, nunc ad ea narranda quae\r\n    vidimus accedamus. Primo autem Armeniam Minorem describemus\r\n    breviter_.”\r\n\r\n[10] Friar Francesco Pipino of Bologna, a Dominican, is known also\r\n    as the author of a lengthy chronicle from the time of the Frank\r\n    Kings down to 1314; of a Latin Translation of the French History\r\n    of the Conquest of the Holy Land, by Bernard the Treasurer; and of\r\n    a short Itinerary of a Pilgrimage to Palestine in 1320. Extracts\r\n    from the Chronicle, and the version of Bernard, are printed in\r\n    Muratori’s Collection. As Pipino states himself to have executed\r\n    the translation of Polo by order of his Superiors, it is probable\r\n    that the task was set him at a general chapter of the order which\r\n    was held at Bologna in 1315. (See _Muratori_, IX. 583; and _Quétif,\r\n    Script. Ord. Praed._ I. 539). We do not know why Ramusio assigned\r\n    the translation specifically to 1320, but he may have had grounds.\r\n\r\n[11] See _Bianconi_, 1st Mem. 29 _seqq._\r\n\r\n[12] C. Dickens somewhere narrates the history of the equivalents\r\n    for a sovereign as changed and rechanged at every frontier on\r\n    a continental tour. The final equivalent received at Dover on\r\n    his return was some 12 or 13 shillings; a fair parallel to the\r\n    comparative value of the first and last copies in the circle of\r\n    translation.\r\n\r\n[13] The Ramusios were a family of note in literature for several\r\n    generations. Paolo, the father of Gian Battista, came originally\r\n    from Rimini to Venice in 1458, and had a great repute as a jurist,\r\n    besides being a littérateur of some eminence, as was also his\r\n    younger brother Girolamo. G. B. Ramusio was born at Treviso in\r\n    1485, and early entered the public service. In 1533 he became one\r\n    of the Secretaries of the Council of X. He was especially devoted\r\n    to geographical studies, and had a school for such studies in his\r\n    house. He retired eventually from public duties, and lived at\r\n    Villa Ramusia, near Padua. He died in the latter city, 10th July,\r\n    1557, but was buried at Venice in the Church of S. Maria dell’Orto.\r\n    There was a portrait of him by Paul Veronese in the Hall of the\r\n    Great Council, but it perished in the fire of 1577; and that\r\n    which is now seen in the Sala dello Scudo is, like the companion\r\n    portrait of Marco Polo, imaginary. Paolo Ramusio, his son, was the\r\n    author of the well-known History of the Capture of Constantinople.\r\n    (_Cicogna_, II. 310 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n[14] The old French texts were unknown in Marsden’s time. Hence this\r\n    question did not present itself to him.\r\n\r\n[15] _Wangcheu_ in the Chinese Annals; _Vanchu_ in Ramusio. I assume\r\n    that Polo’s _Vanchu_ was pronounced as in English; for in Venetian\r\n    the _ch_ very often has that sound. But I confess that I can adduce\r\n    no other instance in Ramusio where I suppose it to have this\r\n    sound, except in the initial sound of _Chinchitalas_ and twice in\r\n    _Choiach_ (see II. 364).\r\n\r\nProfessor Bianconi, who has treated the questions connected with the\r\n    Texts of Polo with honest enthusiasm and laborious detail, will\r\n    admit nothing genuine in the Ramusian interpolations beyond the\r\n    preservation of some _oral traditions_ of Polo’s supplementary\r\n    recollections. But such a theory is out of the question in face of\r\n    a chapter like that on Ahmad.\r\n\r\n[16] Old Purchas appears to have greatly relished Ramusio’s comparative\r\n    lucidity: “I found (says he) this Booke translated by Master\r\n    Hakluyt out of the Latine (_i.e._ among Hakluyt’s MS. collections).\r\n    But where the blind leade the blind both fall: as here the corrupt\r\n    _Latine_ could not but yeeld a corruption of truth in _English_.\r\n    Ramusio, Secretarie to the _Decemviri_ in _Venice_, found a better\r\n    Copie and published the same, whence you have the worke in manner\r\n    new: so renewed, that I have found the Proverbe true, that it is\r\n    better to pull downe an old house and to build it anew, then to\r\n    repaire it; as I also should have done, had I knowne that which in\r\n    the event I found. The _Latine_ is Latten, compared to _Ramusio’s_\r\n    Gold. And hee which hath the _Latine_ hath but _Marco Polo’s_\r\n    carkasse or not so much, but a few bones, yea, sometimes stones\r\n    rather then bones; things divers, averse, adverse, perverted in\r\n    manner, disjoynted in manner, beyond beliefe. I have seene some\r\n    Authors maymed, but never any so mangled and so mingled, so present\r\n    and so absent, as this vulgar _Latine_ of _Marco Polo_; not so like\r\n    himselfe, as the Three _Polo’s_ were at their returne to _Venice_,\r\n    where none knew them.... Much are wee beholden to _Ramusio_, for\r\n    restoring this _Pole_ and Load-starre of _Asia_, out of that mirie\r\n    poole or puddle in which he lay drouned.” (III. p. 65.)\r\n\r\n[17] Of these difficulties the following are some of the more\r\n    prominent:—\r\n\r\n    1. The mention of the death of Kúblái (see note 7, p. 38 of this\r\n    volume), whilst throughout the book Polo speaks of Kúblái as if\r\n    still reigning.\r\n\r\n    2. Mr. Hugh Murray objects that whilst in the old texts Polo\r\n    appears to look on Kúblái with reverence as a faultless Prince, in\r\n    the Ramusian we find passages of an opposite tendency, as in the\r\n    chapter about Ahmad.\r\n\r\n    3. The same editor points to the manner in which one of the\r\n    Ramusian additions represents the traveller to have visited the\r\n    Palace of the Chinese Kings at Kinsay, which he conceives to be\r\n    inconsistent with Marco’s position as an official of the Mongol\r\n    Government. (See vol. ii. p. 208.)\r\n\r\n    If we could conceive the Ramusian additions to have been originally\r\n    notes written by old Maffeo Polo on his nephew’s book, this\r\n    hypothesis would remove almost all difficulty.\r\n\r\n    One passage in Ramusio seems to bear a reference to the date at\r\n    which these interpolated notes were amalgamated with the original.\r\n    In the chapter on Samarkand (i. p. 191) the conversion of the\r\n    Prince Chagatai is said in the old texts to have occurred “not a\r\n    great while ago” (_il ne a encore grament de tens_). But in Ramusio\r\n    the supposed event is fixed at “one hundred and twenty-five years\r\n    since.” This number could not have been uttered with reference to\r\n    1298, the year of the dictation at Genoa, nor to any year of Polo’s\r\n    own life. Hence it is probable that the original note contained a\r\n    date or definite term which was altered by the compiler to suit the\r\n    date of his own compilation, some time in the 14th century.\r\n\r\n[18] In the first edition of Ramusio the preface contained the\r\n    following passage, which is omitted from the succeeding editions;\r\n    but as even the first edition was issued after Ramusio’s own death,\r\n    I do not see that any stress can be laid on this:\r\n\r\n    “A copy of the Book of Marco Polo, as it was originally written\r\n    in Latin, marvellously old, and perhaps directly copied from the\r\n    original as it came from M. Marco’s own hand, has been often\r\n    consulted by me and compared with that which we now publish, having\r\n    been lent me by a nobleman of this city, belonging to the Ca’\r\n    Ghisi.”\r\n\r\n[19] For a moment I thought I had been lucky enough to light on a part\r\n    of the missing original of Ramusio in the Barberini Library at\r\n    Rome. A fragment of a Venetian version in that library (No. 56 in\r\n    our list of MSS.) bore on the fly-leaf the title “_Alcuni primi\r\n    capi del Libro di S. Marco Polo, copiati dall esemplare manoscritto\r\n    di PAOLO RANNUSIO._” But it proved to be of no importance. One\r\n    brief passage of those which have been thought peculiar to Ramusio,\r\n    viz., the reference to the Martyrdom of St. Blaize at Sebaste (see\r\n    p. 43 of this volume), is found also in the Geographic Latin.\r\n\r\n    It was pointed out by Lazari, that another passage (vol. i. p. 60)\r\n    of those otherwise peculiar to Ramusio, is found in a somewhat\r\n    abridged Latin version in a MS. which belonged to the late eminent\r\n    antiquary Emanuel Cicogna. (See List in Appendix F, No. 35.)\r\n    This fact induced me when at Venice in 1870 to examine the MS.\r\n    throughout, and, though I could give little time to it, the result\r\n    was very curious.\r\n\r\n    I find that this MS. contains, not one only, but at least _seven_\r\n    of the passages otherwise peculiar to Ramusio, and must have been\r\n    one of the elements that went to the formation of his text. Yet of\r\n    his more important interpolations, such as the chapter on Ahmad’s\r\n    oppressions and the additional matter on the City of Kinsay, there\r\n    is no indication. The seven passages alluded to are as follows; the\r\n    words corresponding to Ramusian peculiarities are in italics, the\r\n    references are to my own volumes.\r\n\r\n    1. In the chapter on Georgia:\r\n\r\n    “Mare quod dicitur Gheluchelan _vel ABACU_”....\r\n\r\n    “Est ejus stricta via et dubia. Ab una parte est mare _quod dixi de\r\n    ABACU_ et ab aliâ nemora invia,” etc. (See I. p. 59, note 8.)\r\n\r\n    2. “Et ibi optimi austures _dicti AVIGI_” (I. 50).\r\n\r\n    3. After the chapter on Mosul is another short chapter, already\r\n    alluded to:\r\n\r\n    “_Prope hanc civitatem (est) alia provincia dicta MUS e MEREDIEN in\r\n    quâ nascitur magna quantitas bombacis, et hic fiunt bocharini et\r\n    alia multa, et sunt mercatores homines et artiste_.” (See i. p. 60.)\r\n\r\n    4. In the chapter on _Tarcan_ (for Carcan, _i.e._ Yarkand):\r\n\r\n    “_Et maior pars horum habent unum ex pedibus grossum et habent\r\n    gosum in gulâ_; et est hic fertilis contracta.” (See i. p. 187.)\r\n\r\n    5. In the Desert of Lop:\r\n\r\n    “_Homines trasseuntes appendunt bestiis suis capanullas_ [_i.e._\r\n    campanellas] _ut ipsas senciant et ne deviare possint_” (i. p. 197.)\r\n\r\n    6. “Ciagannor, _quod sonat in Latino STAGNUM ALBUM_.” (i. p. 296.)\r\n\r\n    7. “Et in medio hujus viridarii est palacium sive logia, _tota\r\n    super columpnas. Et in summitate cujuslibet columnæ est draco\r\n    magnus circundans totam columpnam, et hic substinet eorum\r\n    cohoperturam cum ore et pedibus_; et est cohopertura tota de cannis\r\n    hoc modo,” etc. (See i. p. 299.)\r\n\r\n[20] My valued friend Sir Arthur Phayre made known to me the passage\r\n    in _O’Curry’s Lectures_. I then procured the extracts and further\r\n    particulars from Mr. J. Long, Irish Transcriber and Translator\r\n    in Dublin, who took them from the Transcript of the _Book of\r\n    Lismore_, in the possession of the Royal Irish Academy.

SOME ESTIMATE OF THE CHARACTER OF POLO AND HIS BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grounds of Polo’s pre-eminence among mediæval travellers.]\r\n\r\n66. That Marco Polo has been so universally recognised as the King of\r\nMediæval Travellers is due rather to the width of his experience, the\r\nvast compass of his journeys, and the romantic nature of his personal\r\nhistory, than to transcendent superiority of character or capacity.\r\n\r\nThe generation immediately preceding his own has bequeathed to us, in\r\nthe Report of the Franciscan Friar William de Rubruquis,[1] on the\r\nMission with which St. Lewis charged him to the Tartar Courts, the\r\nnarrative of one great journey, which, in its rich detail, its vivid\r\npictures, its acuteness of observation and strong good sense, seems\r\nto me to form a Book of Travels of much higher claims than _any one\r\nseries_ of Polo’s chapters; a book, indeed, which has never had justice\r\ndone to it, for it has few superiors in the whole Library of Travel.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic Biographers, beginning with Ramusio, have placed Polo on\r\nthe same platform with Columbus. But where has our Venetian Traveller\r\nleft behind him any trace of the genius and lofty enthusiasm, the\r\nardent and justified previsions which mark the great Admiral as one\r\nof the lights of the human race?[2] It is a juster praise that the\r\nspur which his Book eventually gave to geographical studies, and the\r\nbeacons which it hung out at the Eastern extremities of the Earth\r\nhelped to guide the aims, though scarcely to kindle the fire, of the\r\ngreater son of the rival Republic. His work was at least a link in the\r\nProvidential chain which at last dragged the New World to light.[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His true claims to glory.]\r\n\r\n67. Surely Marco’s real, indisputable, and, in their kind, unique\r\nclaims to glory may suffice! _He was the first Traveller to trace a\r\nroute across the whole longitude of_ ASIA, _naming and describing\r\nkingdom after kingdom which he had seen with his own eyes; the Deserts\r\nof_ PERSIA, _the flowering plateaux and wild gorges of_ BADAKHSHAN,\r\n_the jade-bearing rivers of_ KHOTAN, _the_ MONGOLIAN _Steppes, cradle\r\nof the power that had so lately threatened to swallow up Christendom,\r\nthe new and brilliant Court that had been established at_ CAMBALUC:\r\n_The first Traveller to reveal_ CHINA _in all its wealth and vastness,\r\nits mighty rivers, its huge cities, its rich manufactures, its swarming\r\npopulation, the inconceivably vast fleets that quickened its seas and\r\nits inland waters; to tell us of the nations on its borders with all\r\ntheir eccentricities of manners and worship; of_ TIBET _with its sordid\r\ndevotees; of_ BURMA _with its golden pagodas and their tinkling crowns;\r\nof_ LAOS, _of_ SIAM, _of_ COCHIN CHINA, _of_ JAPAN, _the Eastern Thule,\r\nwith its rosy pearls and golden-roofed palaces; the first to speak\r\nof that Museum of Beauty and Wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked,\r\nthe_ INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO, _source of those aromatics then so highly\r\nprized and whose origin was so dark; of_ JAVA _the Pearl of Islands;\r\nof_ SUMATRA _with its many kings, its strange costly products, and its\r\ncannibal races; of the naked savages of_ NICOBAR _and_ ANDAMAN; _of_\r\nCEYLON _the Isle of Gems with its Sacred Mountain and its Tomb of Adam;\r\nof_ INDIA THE GREAT, _not as a dream-land of Alexandrian fables, but\r\nas a country seen and partially explored, with its virtuous Brahmans,\r\nits obscene ascetics, its diamonds and the strange tales of their\r\nacquisition, its sea-beds of pearl, and its powerful sun; the first in\r\nmediæval times to give any distinct account of the secluded Christian\r\nEmpire of_ ABYSSINIA, _and the semi-Christian Island of_ SOCOTRA; _to\r\nspeak, though indeed dimly, of_ ZANGIBAR _with its negroes and its\r\nivory, and of the vast and distant_ MADAGASCAR, _bordering on the Dark\r\nOcean of the South, with its Ruc and other monstrosities; and, in a\r\nremotely opposite region, of_ SIBERIA _and the_ ARCTIC OCEAN, _of\r\ndog-sledges, white bears, and reindeer-riding Tunguses_.\r\n\r\nThat all this rich catalogue of discoveries should belong to the\r\nrevelations of one Man and one Book is surely ample ground enough to\r\naccount for and to justify the Author’s high place in the roll of Fame,\r\nand there can be no need to exaggerate his greatness, or to invest him\r\nwith imaginary attributes.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His personal attributes seen but dimly.]\r\n\r\n68. What manner of man was Ser Marco? It is a question hard to answer.\r\nSome critics cry out against personal detail in books of Travel; but as\r\nregards him who would not welcome a little more egotism! In his Book\r\nimpersonality is carried to excess; and we are often driven to discern\r\nby indirect and doubtful indications alone, whether he is speaking of\r\na place from personal knowledge or only from hearsay. In truth, though\r\nthere are delightful exceptions, and nearly every part of the book\r\nsuggests interesting questions, a desperate meagreness and baldness\r\ndoes extend over considerable tracts of the story. In fact his book\r\nreminds us sometimes of his own description of Khorasan:—“_On chevauche\r\npar beaus plains et belles costieres, là où il a moult beaus herbages\r\net bonne pasture et fruis assez.... Et aucune fois y treuve l’en un\r\ndesert de soixante milles ou de mains, esquels desers ne treuve l’en\r\npoint d’eaue; mais la convient porter o lui!_”\r\n\r\nStill, some shadowy image of the man may be seen in the Book; a\r\npractical man, brave, shrewd, prudent, keen in affairs, and never\r\nlosing his interest in mercantile details, very fond of the chase,\r\nsparing of speech; with a deep wondering respect for Saints, even\r\nthough they be Pagan Saints, and their asceticism, but a contempt for\r\nPatarins and such like, whose consciences would not run in customary\r\ngrooves, and on his own part a keen appreciation of the World’s pomps\r\nand vanities. See, on the one hand, his undisguised admiration of\r\nthe hard life and long fastings of Sakya Muni; and on the other how\r\nenthusiastic he gets in speaking of the great Kaan’s command of the\r\ngood things of the world, but above all of his matchless opportunities\r\nof sport![5]\r\n\r\nOf humour there are hardly any signs in his Book. His almost solitary\r\njoke (I know but one more, and it pertains to the οὐκ ἀνήκοντα)\r\noccurs in speaking of the Kaan’s paper-money when he observes that\r\nKúblái might be said to have the true Philosopher’s Stone, for he\r\nmade his money at pleasure out of the bark of Trees.[6] Even the\r\noddest eccentricities of outlandish tribes scarcely seem to disturb\r\nhis gravity; as when he relates in his brief way of the people called\r\nGold-Teeth on the frontier of Burma, that ludicrous custom which Mr.\r\nTylor has so well illustrated under the name of the _Couvade_. There is\r\nmore savour of laughter in the few lines of a Greek Epic, which relate\r\nprecisely the same custom of a people on the Euxine:—\r\n\r\n              ————“In the Tibarenian Land\r\n    When some good woman bears her lord a babe,\r\n    ’Tis _he_ is swathed and groaning put to bed;\r\n    Whilst _she_, arising, tends his baths, and serves\r\n    Nice possets for her husband in the straw.”[7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Probable View OF MARCO POLO’S OWN GEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Lit. Frauenfelder, Palermo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absence of scientific notions.]\r\n\r\n69. Of scientific notions, such as we find in the unveracious\r\nMaundevile, we have no trace in truthful Marco. The former, “lying with\r\na circumstance,” tells us boldly that he was in 33° of South Latitude;\r\nthe latter is full of wonder that some of the Indian Islands where he\r\nhad been lay so far to the south that you lost sight of the Pole-star.\r\nWhen it rises again on his horizon he estimates the Latitude by the\r\nPole-star’s being so many _cubits_ high. So the gallant Baber speaks\r\nof the sun having mounted _spear-high_ when the onset of battle began\r\nat Paniput. Such expressions convey no notion at all to such as have\r\nhad their ideas sophisticated by angular perceptions of altitude, but\r\nsimilar expressions are common among Orientals,[8] and indeed I have\r\nheard them from educated Englishmen. In another place Marco states\r\nregarding certain islands in the Northern Ocean that they lie so\r\nvery far to the north that in going thither one actually leaves the\r\nPole-star a trifle behind towards the south; a statement to which we\r\nknow only one parallel, to wit, in the voyage of that adventurous Dutch\r\nskipper who told Master Moxon, King Charles II.’s Hydrographer, that he\r\nhad sailed two degrees beyond the Pole!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Map constructed on Polo’s data.]\r\n\r\n70. The Book, however, is full of bearings and distances, and I have\r\nthought it worth while to construct a map from its indications, in\r\norder to get some approximation to Polo’s own idea of the face of that\r\nworld which he had traversed so extensively. There are three allusions\r\nto maps in the course of his work (II. 245, 312, 424).\r\n\r\nIn his own bearings, at least on land journeys, he usually carries us\r\nalong a great general traverse line, without much caring about small\r\nchanges of direction. Thus on the great outward journey from the\r\nfrontier of Persia to that of China the line runs almost continuously\r\n“_entre Levant et Grec_” or E.N.E. In his journey from Cambaluc or\r\nPeking to Mien or Burma, it is always _Ponent_ or W.; and in that\r\nfrom Peking to Zayton in Fo-kien, the port of embarkation for India,\r\nit is _Sceloc_ or S.E. The line of bearings in which he deviates most\r\nwidely from truth is that of the cities on the Arabian Coast from Aden\r\nto Hormuz, which he makes to run steadily _vers Maistre_ or N.W., a\r\nconception which it has not been very easy to realise on the map.[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Singular omissions of Polo in regard to China; Historical\r\ninaccuracies.]\r\n\r\n71. In the early part of the Book we are told that Marco acquired\r\nseveral of the languages current in the Mongol Empire, and no less than\r\nfour written characters. We have discussed what these are likely to\r\nhave been (i. pp. 28–29), and have given a decided opinion that Chinese\r\nwas not one of them. Besides intrinsic improbability, and positive\r\nindications of Marco’s ignorance of Chinese, in no respect is his\r\nbook so defective as in regard to Chinese manners and peculiarities.\r\nThe Great Wall is never mentioned, though we have shown reason for\r\nbelieving that it was in his mind when one passage of his book was\r\ndictated.[10] The use of Tea, though he travelled through the Tea\r\ndistricts of Fo-kien, is never mentioned;[11] the compressed feet of\r\nthe women and the employment of the fishing cormorant (both mentioned\r\nby Friar Odoric, the contemporary of his later years), artificial\r\negg-hatching, printing of books (though the notice of this art seems\r\npositively challenged in his account of paper-money), besides a score\r\nof remarkable arts and customs which one would have expected to recur\r\nto his memory, are never alluded to. Neither does he speak of the great\r\ncharacteristic of the Chinese writing. It is difficult to account\r\nfor these omissions, especially considering the comparative fulness\r\nwith which he treats the manners of the Tartars and of the Southern\r\nHindoos; but the impression remains that his associations in China\r\nwere chiefly with foreigners. Wherever the place he speaks of had a\r\nTartar or Persian name he uses that rather than the Chinese one. Thus\r\n_Cathay_, _Cambaluc_, _Pulisanghin_, _Tangut_, _Chagannor_, _Saianfu_,\r\n_Kenjanfu_, _Tenduc_, _Acbalec_, _Carajan_, _Zardandan_, _Zayton_,\r\n_Kemenfu_, _Brius_, _Caramoran_, _Chorcha_, _Juju_, are all Mongol,\r\nTurki, or Persian forms, though all have Chinese equivalents.[12]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the then recent history of Asia, Marco is often\r\ninaccurate, _e.g._ in his account of the death of Chinghiz, in the list\r\nof his successors, and in his statement of the relationship between\r\nnotable members of that House.[13] But the most perplexing knot in the\r\nwhole book lies in the interesting account which he gives of the Siege\r\nof Sayanfu or Siang-yang, during the subjugation of Southern China by\r\nKúblái. I have entered on this matter in the notes (vol. ii. p. 167),\r\nand will only say here that M. Pauthier’s solution of the difficulty\r\nis no solution, being absolutely inconsistent with the story as told\r\nby Marco himself, and that I see none; though I have so much faith in\r\nMarco’s veracity that I am loath to believe that the facts admit of no\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nOur faint attempt to appreciate some of Marco’s qualities, as gathered\r\nfrom his work, will seem far below the very high estimates that have\r\nbeen pronounced, not only by some who have delighted rather to enlarge\r\nupon his frame than to make themselves acquainted with his work,[14]\r\nbut also by persons whose studies and opinions have been worthy of all\r\nrespect. Our estimate, however, does not abate a jot of our intense\r\ninterest in his Book and affection for his memory. And we have a strong\r\nfeeling that, owing partly to his reticence, and partly to the great\r\ndisadvantages under which the Book was committed to writing, we have in\r\nit a singularly imperfect image of the Man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was Polo’s Book materially affected by the Scribe\r\nRusticiano?]\r\n\r\n72. A question naturally suggests itself, how far Polo’s narrative,\r\nat least in its expression, was modified by passing under the pen of\r\na professed littérateur of somewhat humble claims, such as Rusticiano\r\nwas. The case is not a singular one, and in our own day the ill-judged\r\nuse of such assistance has been fatal to the reputation of an\r\nadventurous Traveller.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, already expressed our own view that in the\r\nGeographic Text we have the nearest possible approach to a photographic\r\nimpression of Marco’s oral narrative. If there be an exception to\r\nthis we should seek it in the descriptions of battles, in which we\r\nfind the narrator to fall constantly into a certain vein of bombastic\r\ncommonplaces, which look like the stock phrases of a professed\r\nromancer, and which indeed have a strong resemblance to the actual\r\nphraseology of certain metrical romances.[15] Whether this feature\r\nbe due to Rusticiano I cannot say, but I have not been able to trace\r\nanything of the same character in a cursory inspection of some of his\r\nromance-compilations. Still one finds it impossible to conceive of\r\nour sober and reticent Messer Marco pacing the floor of his Genoese\r\ndungeon, and seven times over rolling out this magniloquent bombast,\r\nwith sufficient deliberation to be overtaken by the pen of the faithful\r\namanuensis!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marco’s reading embraced the Alexandrian Romances. Examples.]\r\n\r\n73. On the other hand, though Marco, who had left home at fifteen\r\nyears of age, naturally shows very few signs of reading, there are\r\nindications that he had read romances, especially those dealing with\r\nthe fabulous adventures of Alexander.\r\n\r\nTo these he refers explicitly or tacitly in his notices of the Irongate\r\nand of Gog and Magog, in his allusions to the marriage of Alexander\r\nwith Darius’s daughter, and to the battle between those two heroes,\r\nand in his repeated mention of the _Arbre Sol_ or _Arbre Sec_ on the\r\nKhorasan frontier.\r\n\r\nThe key to these allusions is to be found in that Legendary History\r\nof Alexander, entirely distinct from the true history of the\r\nMacedonian Conqueror, which in great measure took the place of the\r\nlatter in the imagination of East and West for more than a thousand\r\nyears. This fabulous history is believed to be of Græco-Egyptian\r\norigin, and in its earliest extant compiled form, in the Greek of the\r\nPseudo-Callisthenes, can be traced back to at least about A.D. 200.\r\nFrom the Greek its marvels spread eastward at an early date; some part\r\nat least of their matter was known to Moses of Chorene, in the 5th\r\ncentury;[16] they were translated into Armenian, Arabic, Hebrew, and\r\nSyriac; and were reproduced in the verses of Firdusi and various other\r\nPersian Poets; spreading eventually even to the Indian Archipelago,\r\nand finding utterance in Malay and Siamese. At an early date they had\r\nbeen rendered into Latin by Julius Valerius; but this work had probably\r\nbeen lost sight of, and it was in the 10th century that they were\r\nre-imported from Byzantium to Italy by the Archpriest Leo, who had\r\ngone as Envoy to the Eastern Capital from John Duke of Campania.[17]\r\nRomantic histories on this foundation, in verse and prose, became\r\ndiffused in all the languages of Western Europe, from Spain to\r\nScandinavia, rivalling in popularity the romantic cycles of the Round\r\nTable or of Charlemagne. Nor did this popularity cease till the 16th\r\ncentury was well advanced.\r\n\r\nThe heads of most of the Mediæval Travellers were crammed with these\r\nfables as genuine history.[18] And by the help of that community of\r\nlegend on this subject which they found wherever Mahomedan literature\r\nhad spread, Alexander Magnus was to be traced everywhere in Asia.\r\nFriar Odoric found Tana, near Bombay, to be the veritable City of King\r\nPorus; John Marignolli’s vainglory led him to imitate King Alexander\r\nin setting up a marble column “in the corner of the world over against\r\nParadise,” _i.e._ somewhere on the coast of Travancore; whilst Sir\r\nJohn Maundevile, with a cheaper ambition, borrowed wonders from the\r\nTravels of Alexander to adorn his own. Nay, even in after days, when\r\nthe Portuguese stumbled with amazement on those vast ruins in Camboja,\r\nwhich have so lately become familiar to us through the works of Mouhot,\r\nThomson, and Garnier, they ascribed them to Alexander.[19]\r\n\r\nProminent in all these stories is the tale of Alexander’s shutting up\r\na score of impure nations, at the head of which were Gog and Magog,\r\nwithin a barrier of impassable mountains, there to await the latter\r\ndays; a legend with which the disturbed mind of Europe not unnaturally\r\nconnected that cataclysm of unheard-of Pagans that seemed about to\r\ndeluge Christendom in the first half of the 13th century. In these\r\nstories also the beautiful Roxana, who becomes the bride of Alexander,\r\nis _Darius’s_ daughter, bequeathed to his arms by the dying monarch.\r\nConspicuous among them again is the Legend of the Oracular Trees of the\r\nSun and Moon, which with audible voice foretell the place and manner of\r\nAlexander’s death. With this Alexandrian legend some of the later forms\r\nof the story had mixed up one of Christian origin about the Dry Tree,\r\n_L’Arbre Sec_. And they had also adopted the Oriental story of the Land\r\nof Darkness and the mode of escape from it, which Polo relates at p.\r\n484 of vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Injustice long done to Polo. Singular modern instance.]\r\n\r\n74. We have seen in the most probable interpretation of the nickname\r\n_Milioni_ that Polo’s popular reputation in his lifetime was of a\r\nquestionable kind; and a contemporary chronicler, already quoted,\r\nhas told us how on his death-bed the Traveller was begged by anxious\r\nfriends to retract his extraordinary stories.[20] A little later one\r\nwho copied the Book “_per passare tempo e malinconia_” says frankly\r\nthat he puts no faith in it.[21] Sir Thomas Brown is content “to carry\r\na wary eye” in reading “Paulus Venetus”; but others of our countrymen\r\nin the last century express strong doubts whether he ever was in\r\nTartary or China.[22] Marden’s edition might well have extinguished\r\nthe last sparks of scepticism.[23] Hammer meant praise in calling Polo\r\n“_der Vater orientalischer Hodogetik_,” in spite of the uncouthness of\r\nthe eulogy. But another grave German writer, ten years after Marsden’s\r\npublication, put forth in a serious book that the whole story was a\r\nclumsy imposture![24]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] M. d’Avezac has refuted the common supposition that this admirable\r\n    traveller was a native of Brabant.\r\n\r\n    The form _Rubruquis_ of the name of the traveller William de Rubruk\r\n    has been habitually used in this book, perhaps without sufficient\r\n    consideration, but it is the most familiar in England, from its\r\n    use by Hakluyt and Purchas. The former, who first published the\r\n    narrative, professedly printed from an imperfect MS. belonging to\r\n    the Lord Lumley, which does not seem to be now known. But all the\r\n    MSS. collated by Messrs. Francisque-Michel and Wright, in preparing\r\n    their edition of the Traveller, call him simply Willelmus de Rubruc\r\n    or Rubruk.\r\n\r\n    Some old authors, apparently without the slightest ground, having\r\n    called him _Risbroucke_ and the like, it came to be assumed that he\r\n    was a native of Ruysbroeck, a place in South Brabant.\r\n\r\n    But there is a place still called _Rubrouck_ in French Flanders.\r\n    This is a commune containing about 1500 inhabitants, belonging to\r\n    the Canton of Cassel and _arrondissement_ of Hazebrouck, in the\r\n    Department du Nord. And we may take for granted, till facts are\r\n    alleged against it, that _this_ was the place from which the envoy\r\n    of St. Lewis drew his origin. Many documents of the Middle Ages,\r\n    referring expressly to this place Rubrouck, exist in the Library\r\n    of St. Omer, and a detailed notice of them has been published by\r\n    M. Edm. Coussemaker, of Lille. Several of these documents refer\r\n    to persons bearing the same name as the Traveller, _e.g._, in 1190,\r\n    Thierry de Rubrouc; in 1202 and 1221, Gauthier du Rubrouc; in\r\n    1250, Jean du Rubrouc; and in 1258, Woutermann de Rubrouc. It is\r\n    reasonable to suppose that Friar William was of the same stock.\r\n    See _Bulletin de la Soc. de Géographie_, 2nd vol. for 1868, pp.\r\n    569–570, in which there are some remarks on the subject by M.\r\n    d’Avezac; and I am indebted to the kind courtesy of that eminent\r\n    geographer himself for the indication of this reference and the\r\n    main facts, as I had lost a note of my own on the subject.\r\n\r\n    It seems a somewhat complex question whether a native even of\r\n    _French_ Flanders at that time should be necessarily claimable\r\n    as a Frenchman;[A] but no doubt on this point is alluded to by\r\n    M. d’Avezac, so he probably had good ground for that assumption.\r\n    [See also _Yule’s_ article in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, and\r\n    _Rockhill’s Rubruck_, Int., p. xxxv.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n    That cross-grained Orientalist, I. J. Schmidt, on several occasions\r\n    speaks contemptuously of this veracious and delightful traveller,\r\n    whose evidence goes in the teeth of some of his crotchets. But I am\r\n    glad to find that Professor Peschel takes a view similar to that\r\n    expressed in the text: “The narrative of Ruysbroek [Rubruquis],\r\n    almost immaculate in its freedom from fabulous insertions, may\r\n    be indicated on account of its truth to nature as the greatest\r\n    geographical masterpiece of the Middle Ages.” (_Gesch. der\r\n    Erdkunde_, 1865, p. 151.)\r\n\r\n    [A] The County of Flanders was at this time in large part a fief of\r\n        the French Crown. (See _Natalis de Wailly_, notes to Joinville,\r\n        p. 576.) But that would not much affect the question either one\r\n        way or the other.\r\n\r\n[2] High as Marco’s name deserves to be set, his place is not beside\r\n    the writer of such burning words as these addressed to Ferdinand\r\n    and Isabella: “From the most tender age I went to sea, and to\r\n    this day I have continued to do so. Whosoever devotes himself to\r\n    this craft must desire to know the secrets of Nature here below.\r\n    For 40 years now have I thus been engaged, and wherever man has\r\n    sailed hitherto on the face of the sea, thither have I sailed also.\r\n    I have been in constant relation with men of learning, whether\r\n    ecclesiastic or secular, Latins and Greeks, Jews and Moors, and\r\n    men of many a sect besides. To accomplish this my longing (to\r\n    know the Secrets of the World) I found the Lord favourable to my\r\n    purposes; it is He who hath given me the needful disposition and\r\n    understanding. He bestowed upon me abundantly the knowledge of\r\n    seamanship: and of Astronomy He gave me enough to work withal,\r\n    and so with Geometry and Arithmetic.... In the days of my youth\r\n    I studied works of all kinds, history, chronicles, philosophy,\r\n    and other arts, and to apprehend these the Lord opened my\r\n    understanding. Under His manifest guidance I navigated hence to the\r\n    Indies; for it was the Lord who gave me the will to accomplish that\r\n    task, and it was in the ardour of that will that I came before your\r\n    Highnesses. All those who heard of my project scouted and derided\r\n    it; all the acquirements I have mentioned stood me in no stead;\r\n    and if in your Highnesses, and in you alone, Faith and Constancy\r\n    endured, to Whom are due the Lights that have enlightened you as\r\n    well as me, but to the Holy Spirit?” (Quoted in _Humboldt’s Examen\r\n    Critique_, I. 17, 18.)\r\n\r\n[3] Libri, however, speaks too strongly when he says: “The finest\r\n    of all the results due to the influence of Marco Polo is that\r\n    of having stirred Columbus to the discovery of the New World.\r\n    Columbus, jealous of Polo’s laurels, spent his life in preparing\r\n    means to get to that Zipangu of which the Venetian traveller had\r\n    told such great things; his desire was to reach China by sailing\r\n    westward, and in his way he fell in with America.” (_H. des\r\n    Sciences Mathém._ etc. II. 150.)\r\n\r\n    The fact seems to be that Columbus knew of Polo’s revelations only\r\n    at second hand, from the letters of the Florentine Paolo Toscanelli\r\n    and the like; and I cannot find that he _ever_ refers to Polo by\r\n    name. [How deep was the interest taken by Colombus in Marco Polo’s\r\n    travels is shown by the numerous marginal notes of the Admiral in\r\n    the printed copy of the latin version of Pipino kept at the Bib.\r\n    Colombina at Seville. See _Appendix H_. p. 558.—H. C.] Though to\r\n    the day of his death he was full of imaginations about Zipangu and\r\n    the land of the Great Kaan as being in immediate proximity to his\r\n    discoveries, these were but accidents of his great theory. It was\r\n    the intense conviction he had acquired of the absolute smallness\r\n    of the Earth, of the vast extension of Asia eastward, and of the\r\n    consequent narrowness of the Western Ocean, on which his life’s\r\n    project was based. This conviction he seems to have derived\r\n    chiefly from the works of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly. But the latter\r\n    borrowed his collected arguments from Roger Bacon, who has stated\r\n    them, erroneous as they are, very forcibly in his _Opus Majus_ (p.\r\n    137), as Humboldt has noticed in his _Examen_ (vol. i. p. 64). The\r\n    Spanish historian Mariana makes a strange jumble of the alleged\r\n    guides of Columbus, saying that some ascribed his convictions\r\n    to “the information given by _one Marco Polo, a Florentine\r\n    Physician!_” (“como otros dizen, por aviso que le dio _un cierto\r\n    Marco Polo, Medico Florentin_;” _Hist. de España_, lib. xxvi. cap\r\n    3). Toscanelli is called by Columbus _Maestro Paulo_, which seems\r\n    to have led to this mistake; see Sign. _G. Uzielli_, in _Boll.\r\n    della Soc. Geog. Ital._ IX. p. 119. [Also by the same: _Paolo dal\r\n    Pozzo Toscanelli iniziatore della scoperta d’America_, Florence,\r\n    1892; _Toscanelli_, No. 1; _Toscanelli_, Vol. V. of the _Raccolta\r\n    Colombiana_, 1894.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[4] “C’est diminuer l’expression d’un éloge que de l’exagérer.”\r\n    (_Humboldt, Examen_, III. 13.)\r\n\r\n[5] See vol. ii. p. 318, and vol. i. p. 404.\r\n\r\n[6] Vol. i. p. 423.\r\n\r\n[7] Vol. ii. p. 85, and _Apollonius Rhodius, Argonaut_. II. 1012.\r\n\r\n[8] Chinese Observers record the length of Comets’ tails by _cubits_!\r\n\r\n[9] The map, perhaps, gives too favourable an idea of Marco’s\r\n    geographical conceptions. For in such a construction much has to\r\n    be supplied for which there are no data, and that is apt to take\r\n    mould from modern knowledge. Just as in the book illustrations of\r\n    ninety years ago we find that Princesses of Abyssinia, damsels of\r\n    Otaheite, and Beauties of Mary Stuart’s Court have all somehow a\r\n    savour of the high waists, low foreheads, and tight garments of\r\n    1810.\r\n\r\n    We are told that Prince Pedro of Portugal in 1426 received from the\r\n    Signory of Venice a map which was supposed to be either an original\r\n    or a copy of one by Marco Polo’s own hand. (_Major’s P. Henry_, p.\r\n    62.) There is no evidence to justify any absolute expression of\r\n    disbelief; and if any map-maker with the spirit of the author of\r\n    the Carta Catalana then dwelt in Venice, Polo certainly could not\r\n    have gone to his grave uncatechised. But I should suspect the map\r\n    to have been a copy of the old one that existed in the Sala dello\r\n    Scudo of the Ducal Palace.\r\n\r\n    The maps now to be seen painted on the walls of that Hall, and on\r\n    which Polo’s route is marked, are not of any great interest. But in\r\n    the middle of the 15th century there was an old _Descriptio Orbis\r\n    sive Mappamundus_ in the Hall, and when the apartment was renewed\r\n    in 1459 a decree of the Senate ordered that such a map should be\r\n    repainted on the new walls. This also perished by a fire in 1483.\r\n    On the motion of Ramusio, in the next century, four new maps were\r\n    painted. These had become dingy and ragged, when, in 1762, the Doge\r\n    Marco Foscarini caused them to be renewed by the painter Francesco\r\n    Grisellini. He professed to have adhered closely to the old maps,\r\n    but he certainly did not, as Morelli testifies. Eastern Asia looks\r\n    as if based on a work of Ramusio’s age, but Western Asia is of\r\n    undoubtedly modern character. (See _Operetti di Iacopo Morelli_,\r\n    Ven. 1820, I. 299.)\r\n\r\n[10] “Humboldt confirms the opinion I have more than once expressed\r\n    that too much must not be inferred from the silence of authors. He\r\n    adduces three important and perfectly undeniable matters of fact,\r\n    as to which no evidence is to be found where it would be most\r\n    anticipated: In the archives of Barcelona no trace of the triumphal\r\n    entry of Columbus into that city; _in Marco Polo no allusion to\r\n    the Chinese Wall_; in the archives of Portugal nothing about\r\n    the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci in the service of that crown.”\r\n    (_Varnhagen_ v. _Ense_, quoted by Hayward, _Essays_, 2nd Ser. I.\r\n    36.) See regarding the Chinese Wall the remarks referred to above,\r\n    at p. 292 of this volume.\r\n\r\n[11] [It is a strange fact that Polo never mentions the use of _Tea_\r\n    in China, although he travelled through the Tea districts in Fu\r\n    Kien, and tea was then as generally drunk by the Chinese as it\r\n    is now. It is mentioned more than four centuries earlier by the\r\n    Mohammedan merchant Soleyman, who visited China about the middle of\r\n    the 9th century. He states (_Reinaud, Relation des Voyages faits\r\n    par les Arabes et les Persans dans l’Inde et à la Chine_, 1845,\r\n    I. 40): “The people of China are accustomed to use as a beverage\r\n    an infusion of a plant, which they call _sakh_, and the leaves of\r\n    which are aromatic and of a bitter taste. It is considered very\r\n    wholesome. This plant (the leaves) is sold in all the cities of the\r\n    empire.” (_Bretschneider, Hist. Bot. Disc._ I. p. 5.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[12] It is probable that Persian, which had long been the language of\r\n    Turanian courts, was also the common tongue of foreigners at that\r\n    of the Mongols. _Pulisanghin_ and _Zardandan_, in the preceding\r\n    list, are pure Persian. So are several of the Oriental phrases\r\n    noted at p. _84_. See also notes on _Ondanique_ and _Vernique_ at\r\n    pp. 93 and 384 of this volume, on _Tacuin_ at p. 448, and a note\r\n    at p. _93_ _supra_. The narratives of Odoric, and others of the\r\n    early travellers to Cathay, afford corroborative examples. Lord\r\n    Stanley of Alderley, in one of his contributions to the Hakluyt\r\n    Series, has given evidence from experience that Chinese Mahomedans\r\n    still preserve the knowledge of numerous Persian words.\r\n\r\n[13] Compare these errors with like errors of Herodotus, _e.g._,\r\n    regarding the conspiracy of the False Smerdis. (See Rawlinson’s\r\n    Introduction, p. 55.) There is a curious parallel between the two\r\n    also in the supposed occasional use of Oriental state records, as\r\n    in Herodotus’s accounts of the revenues of the satrapies, and of\r\n    the army of Xerxes, and in Marco Polo’s account of Kinsay, and of\r\n    the Kaan’s revenues. (Vol. ii pp. 185, 216.)\r\n\r\n[14] An example is seen in the voluminous _Annali Musulmani_ of _G.\r\n    B. Rampoldi_, Milan, 1825. This writer speaks of the Travels of\r\n    Marco Polo with his _brother_ and uncle; declares that he visited\r\n    _Tipango_ (_sic_), Java, Ceylon, and the _Maldives_, collected all\r\n    the geographical notions of his age, traversed the two peninsulas\r\n    of the Indies, examined the islands of _Socotra, Madagascar,\r\n    Sofala_, and traversed with _philosophic eye_ the regions of\r\n    Zanguebar, Abyssinia, Nubia, and Egypt! and so forth (ix. 174).\r\n    And whilst Malte-Brun bestows on Marco the sounding and ridiculous\r\n    title of “_the Humboldt of the 13th century_,” he shows little real\r\n    acquaintance with his Book. (See his _Précis_, ed. of 1836, I. 551\r\n    _seqq._)\r\n\r\n[15] See for example vol. i. p. 338, and note 4 at p. 341; also vol.\r\n    ii. p. 103. The descriptions in the style referred to recur in all\r\n    seven times; but most of them (which are in Book IV.) have been\r\n    omitted in this translation.\r\n\r\n[16] [On the subject of Moses of Chorene and his works, I must refer to\r\n    the clever researches of the late Auguste Carrière, Professor of\r\n    Armenian at the École des Langues Orientales.—H.

P. of Venice, written with mine own hand by me Amalio\r\n    Bonaguisi when Podestà of Cierreto Guidi, to get rid of time and\r\n    _ennui_.

But these\r\n    things, it has seemed to me in copying, are entertaining enough,\r\n    but not things to believe or put any faith in; that at least is my\r\n    opinion. And I finished copying this at Cierreto aforesaid, 12th\r\n    November, A.D. 1392.”\r\n\r\n[22] _Vulgar Errors_, Bk. I. ch. viii.; _Astley’s Voyages_, IV. 583.\r\n\r\n[23] A few years before Marsden’s publication, the Historical branch of\r\n    the R. S. of Science at Göttingen appears to have put forth as the\r\n    subject of a prize Essay the Geography of the Travels of Carpini,\r\n    Rubruquis, and especially of Marco Polo. (See _L. of M. Polo_, by\r\n    _Zurla_, in _Collezione di Vite e Ritratti d’Illustri Italiani_.\r\n    Pad. 1816.)\r\n\r\n[24] See _Städtewesen des Mittelalters_, by _K. D. Hüllmann_, Bonn,\r\n    1829, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n    After speaking of the Missions of Pope Innocent IV. and St.\r\n    Lewis, this author sketches the Travels of the Polos, and then\r\n    proceeds:—“Such are the clumsily compiled contents of this\r\n    ecclesiastical fiction (_Kirchengeschichtlichen Dichtung_)\r\n    disguised as a Book of Travels, a thing devised generally in the\r\n    spirit of the age, but specially in the interests of the Clergy\r\n    and of Trade.... This compiler’s aim was analogous to that of\r\n    the inventor of the Song of Roland, to kindle enthusiasm for the\r\n    conversion of the Mongols, and so to facilitate commerce through\r\n    their dominions.... Assuredly the Poli never got further than Great\r\n    Bucharia, which was then reached by many Italian Travellers. What\r\n    they have related of the regions of the Mongol Empire lying further\r\n    east consists merely of recollections of the bazaar and travel-talk\r\n    of traders from those countries; whilst the notices of India,\r\n    Persia, Arabia, and Ethiopia, are borrowed from Arabic Works. The\r\n    compiler no doubt carries his audacity in fiction a long way, when\r\n    he makes his hero Marcus assert that he had been seventeen years in\r\n    Kúblái’s service,” etc. etc. (pp. 360–362).\r\n\r\n    In the French edition of _Malcolm’s History of Persia_ (II. 141),\r\n    Marco is styled “_prêtre Venetien_”! I do not know whether this is\r\n    due to Sir John or to the translator.\r\n\r\n    [Polo is also called “a Venetian Priest,” in a note, vol. i., p.\r\n    409, of the original edition of London, 1815, 2 vols., 4to.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          XII. CONTEMPORARY RECOGNITION OF POLO AND HIS BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How far was there diffusion of his Book in his own day?]\r\n\r\n75. But we must return for a little to Polo’s own times. Ramusio\r\nstates, as we have seen, that immediately after the first commission of\r\nPolo’s narrative to writing (in Latin as he imagined), many copies of\r\nit were made, it was translated into the vulgar tongue, and in a few\r\nmonths all Italy was full of it.\r\n\r\nThe few facts that we can collect do not justify this view of the\r\nrapid and diffused renown of the Traveller and his Book. The number\r\nof MSS. of the latter dating from the 14th century is no doubt\r\nconsiderable, but a large proportion of these are of Pipino’s condensed\r\nLatin Translation, which was not put forth, if we can trust Ramusio,\r\ntill 1320, and certainly not much earlier. The whole number of MSS.\r\nin various languages that we have been able to register, amounts to\r\nabout eighty. I find it difficult to obtain statistical data as to the\r\ncomparative number of copies of different works existing in manuscript.\r\nWith Dante’s great Poem, of which there are reckoned close upon 500\r\nMSS.,[1] comparison would be inappropriate. But of the Travels of Friar\r\nOdoric, a poor work indeed beside Marco Polo’s, I reckoned thirty-nine\r\nMSS., and could now add at least three more to the list. [I described\r\nseventy-three in my edition of _Odoric_.—H. C.] Also I find that of\r\nthe nearly contemporary work of Brunetto Latini, the _Tresor_, a sort\r\nof condensed Encyclopædia of knowledge, but a work which one would\r\nscarcely have expected to approach the popularity of Polo’s Book, the\r\nEditor enumerates some fifty MSS. And from the great frequency with\r\nwhich one encounters in Catalogues both MSS. and early printed editions\r\nof Sir John Maundevile, I should suppose that the lying wonders of\r\nour English Knight had a far greater popularity and more extensive\r\ndiffusion than the veracious and more sober marvels of Polo.[2] To\r\nSouthern Italy Polo’s popularity certainly does not seem at any time to\r\nhave extended. I cannot learn that any MS. of his Book exists in any\r\nLibrary of the late Kingdom of Naples or in Sicily.[3]\r\n\r\nDante, who lived for twenty-three years after Marco’s work was\r\nwritten, and who touches so many things in the seen and unseen Worlds,\r\nnever alludes to Polo, nor I think to anything that can be connected\r\nwith his Book. I believe that no mention of _Cathay_ occurs in the\r\n_Divina Commedia_. That distant region is indeed mentioned more than\r\nonce in the poems of a humbler contemporary, Francesco da Barberino,\r\nbut there is nothing in his allusions besides this name to suggest any\r\nknowledge of Polo’s work.[4]\r\n\r\nNeither can I discover any trace of Polo or his work in that of his\r\ncontemporary and countryman, Marino Sanudo the Elder, though this\r\nworthy is well acquainted with the somewhat later work of Hayton, and\r\nmany of the subjects which he touches in his own book would seem to\r\nchallenge a reference to Marco’s labours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary references to Polo.]\r\n\r\n76. Of contemporary or nearly contemporary references to our Traveller\r\nby name, the following are all that I can produce, and none of them are\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nFirst there is the notice regarding his presentation of his book to\r\nThibault de Cepoy, of which we need say no more (_supra_, p. _68_).\r\n\r\nNext there is the Preface to Friar Pipino’s Translation, which we give\r\nat length in the Appendix (E) to these notices. The phraseology of this\r\nappears to imply that Marco was still alive, and this agrees with the\r\ndate assigned to the work by Ramusio. Pipino was also the author of a\r\nChronicle, of which a part was printed by Muratori, and this contains\r\nchapters on the Tartar wars, the destruction of the Old Man of the\r\nMountain, etc., derived from Polo. A passage not printed by Muratori\r\nhas been extracted by Prof. Bianconi from a MS. of this Chronicle in\r\nthe Modena Library, and runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “The matters which follow, concerning the magnificence of the\r\n  Tartar Emperors, whom in their language they call _Cham_ as we\r\n  have said, are related by Marcus Paulus the Venetian in a certain\r\n  Book of his which has been translated by me into Latin out of the\r\n  Lombardic Vernacular. Having gained the notice of the Emperor\r\n  himself and become attached to his service, he passed nearly 27\r\n  years in the Tartar countries.”[5]\r\n\r\nAgain we have that mention of Marco by Friar Jacopo d’Acqui, which\r\nwe have quoted in connection with his capture by the Genoese, at\r\np. _54_.[6] And the Florentine historian GIOVANNI VILLANI,[7] when\r\nalluding to the Tartars, says:—\r\n\r\n  “Let him who would make full acquaintance with their history\r\n  examine the book of Friar Hayton, Lord of Colcos in Armenia, which\r\n  he made at the instance of Pope Clement V., and also the Book\r\n  called _Milione_ which was made by Messer Marco Polo of Venice,\r\n  who tells much about their power and dominion, having spent a long\r\n  time among them. And so let us quit the Tartars and return to our\r\n  subject, the History of Florence.”[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further contemporary references.]\r\n\r\n77. Lastly, we learn from a curious passage in a medical work by PIETRO\r\nOF ABANO, a celebrated physician and philosopher, and a man of Polo’s\r\nown generation, that he was personally acquainted with the Traveller.\r\nIn a discussion on the old notion of the non-habitability of the\r\nEquatorial regions, which Pietro controverts, he says:[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Star at the Antarctic as sketched by Marco Polo[10].]\r\n\r\n  “In the country of the ZINGHI there is seen a star as big as a\r\n  sack. I know a man who has seen it, and he told me it had a faint\r\n  light like a piece of a cloud, and is always in the south.[11] I\r\n  have been told of this and other matters by MARCO the Venetian, the\r\n  most extensive traveller and the most diligent inquirer whom I have\r\n  ever known. He saw this same star under the Antarctic; he described\r\n  it as having a great tail, and drew a figure of it _thus_. He\r\n  also told me that he saw the Antarctic Pole at an altitude above\r\n  the earth apparently equal to the length of a soldier’s lance,\r\n  whilst the Arctic Pole was as much below the horizon. ’Tis from\r\n  that place, he says, that they export to us camphor, lign-aloes,\r\n  and brazil. He says the heat there is intense, and the habitations\r\n  few. And these things he witnessed in a certain island at which he\r\n  arrived by Sea. He tells me also that there are (wild?) men there,\r\n  and also certain very great rams that have very coarse and stiff\r\n  wool just like the bristles of our pigs.”[12]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these five I know no other contemporary references to\r\nPolo, nor indeed any other within the 14th century, though such there\r\nmust surely be, excepting in a Chronicle written after the middle of\r\nthat century by JOHN of YPRES, Abbot of St. Bertin, otherwise known\r\nas Friar John the Long, and himself a person of very high merit in\r\nthe history of Travel, as a precursor of the Ramusios, Hakluyts and\r\nPurchases, for he collected together and translated (when needful) into\r\nFrench all of the most valuable works of Eastern Travel and Geography\r\nproduced in the age immediately preceding his own.[13] In his Chronicle\r\nthe Abbot speaks at some length of the adventures of the Polo Family,\r\nconcluding with a passage to which we have already had occasion to\r\nrefer:\r\n\r\n  “And so Messers Nicolaus and Maffeus, with certain Tartars, were\r\n  sent a second time to these parts; but Marcus Pauli was retained by\r\n  the Emperor and employed in his military service, abiding with him\r\n  for a space of 27 years. And the Cham, on account of his ability\r\n  despatched him upon affairs of his to various parts of Tartary\r\n  and India and the Islands, on which journeys he beheld many of\r\n  the marvels of those regions. And concerning these he afterwards\r\n  composed a book in the French vernacular, which said Book of\r\n  Marvels, with others of the same kind, we do possess.” (_Thesaur.\r\n  Nov. Anecdot._ III. 747.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curious borrowings from Polo in the Romance of Bauduin de\r\nSebourc.]\r\n\r\n78. There is, however, a notable work which is ascribed to a rather\r\nearly date in the 14th century, and which, though it contains no\r\nreference to Polo by name, shows a thorough acquaintance with his book,\r\nand borrows themes largely from it. This is the poetical Romance of\r\nBauduin de Sebourc, an exceedingly clever and vivacious production,\r\npartaking largely of that bantering, half-mocking spirit which is,\r\nI believe, characteristic of many of the later mediæval French\r\nRomances.[14] Bauduin is a knight who, after a very wild and loose\r\nyouth, goes through an extraordinary series of adventures, displaying\r\ngreat faith and courage, and eventually becomes King of Jerusalem. I\r\nwill cite some of the traits evidently derived from our Traveller,\r\nwhich I have met with in a short examination of this curious work.\r\n\r\nBauduin, embarked on a dromond in the Indian Sea, is wrecked in the\r\nterritory of Baudas, and near a city called Falise, which stands on the\r\nRiver of Baudas. The people of this city were an unbelieving race.\r\n\r\n    “Il ne créoient Dieu, Mahon, né Tervogant,\r\n      Ydole, cruchéfis, déable, né tirant.”    P. 300.\r\n\r\nTheir only belief was this, that when a man died a great fire should be\r\nmade beside his tomb, in which should be burned all his clothes, arms,\r\nand necessary furniture, whilst his horse and servant should be put to\r\ndeath, and then the dead man would have the benefit of all these useful\r\nproperties in the other world.[15] Moreover, if it was the king that\r\ndied—\r\n\r\n    “Sé li rois de la terre i aloit trespassant,\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n     Si fasoit-on tuer, .viij. jour en un tenant,\r\n     Tout chiaus c’on encontroit par la chité passant,\r\n     Pour tenir compaingnie leur ségnor soffisant.\r\n     Telle estoit le créanche ou païs dont je cant!”[16]    P. 301.\r\n\r\nBaudin arrives when the king has been dead three days, and through\r\ndread of this custom all the people of the city are shut up in their\r\nhouses. He enters an inn, and helps himself to a vast repast, having\r\nbeen fasting for three days. He is then seized and carried before the\r\nking, Polibans by name. We might have quoted this prince at p. _87_ as\r\nan instance of the diffusion of the French tongue:\r\n\r\n    “Polibans sot Fransois, car on le doctrina:\r\n     j. renoiés de Franche .vij. ans i demora,\r\n     Qui li aprist Fransois, si que bel en parla.”    P. 309.\r\n\r\nBauduin exclaims against their barbarous belief, and declares the\r\nChristian doctrine to the king, who acknowledges good points in it, but\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n    “Vassaus, dist Polibans, à le chière hardie,\r\n     Jà ne crerrai vou Dieux, à nul jour de ma vie;\r\n     Né vostre Loy ne vaut une pomme pourie!”    P. 311.\r\n\r\nBauduin proposes to prove his Faith by fighting the prince, himself\r\nunarmed, the latter with all his arms. The prince agrees, but is rather\r\ndismayed at Bauduin’s confidence, and desires his followers, in case\r\nof his own death, to burn with him horses, armour, etc., asking at the\r\nsame time which of them would consent to burn along with him, in order\r\nto be his companions in the other world:\r\n\r\n    “Là en i ot .ijᵉ. dont cascuns s’escria:\r\n     Nous morons volentiers, quant vo corps mort sara!”[17]  P. 313.\r\n\r\nBauduin’s prayer for help is miraculously granted; Polibans is beaten,\r\nand converted by a vision. He tells Bauduin that in his neighbourhood,\r\nbeyond Baudas—\r\n\r\n                      “ou .v. liewes, ou .vi.\r\n    Ché un felles prinches, orgoellieus et despis;\r\n    De la Rouge-Montaingne est Prinches et Marchis.\r\n    Or vous dirai comment il a ses gens nouris:\r\n      Je vous di que chius Roys a fait un Paradis\r\n    Tant noble et gratieus, et plain de tels déliis,\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n    Car en che Paradis est un riex establis,\r\n    Qui se partist en trois, en che noble pourpris:\r\n    En l’un coert li clarés, d’espises bien garnis;\r\n    Et en l’autre li miés, qui les a resouffis;\r\n    Et li vins di pieument i queurt par droit avis—\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n    Il n’i vente, né gèle.

The\r\nroad led by Baudas:\r\n\r\n    “Or avoit à che tamps, sé l’istoire ne ment,\r\n     En le chit de Baudas Kristiens jusqu’à cent;\r\n     Qui manonent illoec par tréu d’argent,\r\n     Que cascuns cristiens au Roy-Calife rent.\r\n       Li pères du Calife, qui régna longement,\r\n     Ama les Crestiens, et Dieu primièrement:\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n     Et lor fist establir. j. monstier noble et gent,\r\n     Où Crestien faisoient faire lor sacrement.\r\n     Une mout noble pière lor donna proprement,\r\n     Où on avoit posé Mahon moult longement.”[20]    P. 322.\r\n\r\nThe story is, in fact, that which Marco relates of Samarkand.[21] The\r\nCaliph dies. His son hates the Christians. His people complain of the\r\ntoleration of the Christians and their minister; but he says his father\r\nhad pledged him not to interfere, and he dared not forswear himself.\r\nIf, without doing so, he could do them an ill turn, he would gladly.\r\nThe people then suggest their claim to the stone:\r\n\r\n    “Or leur donna vos pères, dont che fu mesprisons.\r\n     Ceste pierre, biaus Sire, Crestiens demandons:\r\n     Il ne le porront rendre, pour vrai le vous disons,\r\n     Si li monstiers n’est mis et par pièches et par mons;\r\n     Et s’il estoit desfais, jamais ne le larons\r\n     Refaire chi-endroit. Ensément averons\r\n     Faites et acomplies nostres ententions.”    P. 324.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph accordingly sends for Maistre Thumas, the Priest of the\r\nChristians, and tells him the stone must be given up:\r\n\r\n    “Il a .c. ans ut plus c’on i mist à solas\r\n     Mahon, le nostre Dieu: dont che n’est mie estas\r\n     Que li vous monstiers soit fais de nostre harnas!”    P. 324.\r\n\r\nMaster Thomas, in great trouble, collects his flock, mounts the pulpit,\r\nand announces the calamity. Bauduin and his convert Polibans then\r\narrive. Bauduin recommends confession, fasting, and prayer. They follow\r\nhis advice, and on the third day the miracle occurs:\r\n\r\n    “L’escripture le dist, qui nous achertéfie\r\n     Que le pierre Mahon, qui ou mur fut fiquie,\r\n     Sali hors du piler, coi que nul vous en die,\r\n     Droit enmi le monstier, c’onques ne fut brisie.\r\n     Et demoura li traus, dont le pière ert widie,\r\n     Sans pière est sans quailliel, à cascune partie;\r\n     Chou deseure soustient, par divine maistrie,\r\n     Tout en air proprement, n’el tenés a falie.\r\n       Encore le voit-on en ichelle partie:\r\n     Qui croire ne m’en voelt, si voist; car je l’en prie!”   P. 327.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph comes to see, and declares it to be the Devil’s doing.\r\nSeeing Polibans, who is his cousin, he hails him, but Polibans draws\r\nback, avowing his Christian faith. The Caliph in a rage has him off to\r\nprison. Bauduin becomes very ill, and has to sell his horse and arms.\r\nHis disease is so offensive that he is thrust out of his hostel, and\r\nin his wretchedness sitting on a stone he still avows his faith, and\r\nconfesses that even then he has not received his deserts. He goes to\r\nbeg in the Christian quarter, and no one gives to him; but still his\r\nfaith and love to God hold out:\r\n\r\n    “Ensément Bauduins chelle rue cherqua,\r\n     Tant qu’à .j. chavetier Bauduins s’arresta,\r\n     Qui chavates cousoit; son pain en garigna:\r\n     Jones fu et plaisans, apertement ouvra.\r\n     Bauduins le regarde, c’onques mot ne parla.”    P. 334.\r\n\r\nThe cobler is charitable, gives him bread, shoes, and a grey coat that\r\nwas a foot too short. He then asks Bauduin if he will not learn his\r\ntrade; but that is too much for the knightly stomach:\r\n\r\n    “Et Bauduins respont, li preus et li membrus:\r\n     J’ameroie trop miex que je fuisse pendus!”    P. 335.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph now in his Council expresses his vexation about the miracle,\r\nand says he does not know how to disprove the faith of the Christians.\r\nA very sage old Saracen who knew Hebrew, and Latin, and some thirty\r\nlanguages, makes a suggestion, which is, in fact, that about the moving\r\nof the Mountain, as related by Marco Polo.[22] Master Thomas is sent\r\nfor again, and told that they must transport the high mountain of\r\n_Thir_ to the valley of _Joaquin_, which lies to the westward. He goes\r\naway in new despair and causes his clerk to _sonner le clocke_ for his\r\npeople. Whilst they are weeping and wailing in the church, a voice\r\nis heard desiring them to seek a certain holy man who is at the good\r\ncobler’s, and to do him honour. God at his prayer will do a miracle.\r\nThey go in procession to Bauduin, who thinks they are mocking him. They\r\ntreat him as a saint, and strive to touch his old coat. At last he\r\nconsents to pray along with the whole congregation.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph is in his palace with his princes, taking his ease at a\r\nwindow. Suddenly he starts up exclaiming:\r\n\r\n    “‘Seignour, par Mahoumet que j’aoure et tieng chier,\r\n      Le Mont de Thir enportent le déable d’enfeir!’\r\n      Li Califes s’écrie: ‘Seignour, franc palasin,\r\n      Voïés le Mont de Thir qui ch’est mis au chemin!\r\n      Vés-le-là tout en air, par mon Dieu Apolin;\r\n      Jà bientost le verrons ens ou val Joaquin!’”    P. 345.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph is converted, releases Polibans, and is baptised, taking\r\nthe name of Bauduin, to whom he expresses his fear of the Viex de\r\nla Montagne with his _Hauts-Assis_, telling anew the story of the\r\nAssassin’s Paradise, and so enlarges on the beauty of Ivorine that\r\nBauduin is smitten, and his love heals his malady. Toleration is not\r\nlearned however:\r\n\r\n    “Bauduins, li Califes, fist baptisier sa gent,\r\n     Et qui ne voilt Dieu crore, li teste on li pourfent!”    P. 350.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph gives up his kingdom to Bauduin, proposing to follow him to\r\nthe Wars of Syria. And Bauduin presents the Kingdom to the Cobler.\r\n\r\nBauduin, the Caliph, and Prince Polibans then proceed to visit the\r\nMountain of the Old Man. The Caliph professes to him that they want\r\nhelp against Godfrey of Bouillon. The Viex says he does not give a\r\n_bouton_ for Godfrey; he will send one of his _Hauts-Assis_ straight to\r\nhis tent, and give him a great knife of steel between _fie et poumon!_\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they go out and witness the feat of devotion which we\r\nhave quoted elsewhere.[23] They then see the Paradise and the lovely\r\nIvorine, with whose beauty Bauduin is struck dumb. The lady had never\r\nsmiled before; now she declares that he for whom she had long waited\r\nwas come. Bauduin exclaims:\r\n\r\n    “‘Madame, fu-jou chou qui sui le vous soubgis?’\r\n      Quant la puchelle l’ot, lors li geta .j. ris;\r\n      Et li dist: ‘Bauduins, vous estes mes amis!’”    Pp. 362–363.\r\n\r\nThe Old One is vexed, but speaks pleasantly to his daughter, who\r\nreplies with frightfully bad language, and declares herself to be a\r\nChristian. The father calls out to the Caliph to kill her. The Caliph\r\npulls out a big knife and gives him a blow that nearly cuts him in two.\r\nThe amiable Ivorine says she will go with Bauduin:\r\n\r\n    “‘Sé mes pères est mors, n’en donne .j. paresis!’”    P. 364.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the story further, as I did not trace beyond this\r\npoint any distinct derivation from our Traveller, with the exception\r\nof that allusion to the incombustible covering of the napkin of St.\r\nVeronica, which I have quoted at p. 216 of this volume. But including\r\nthis, here are at least seven different themes borrowed from Marco\r\nPolo’s book, on which to be sure his poetical contemporary plays the\r\nmost extraordinary variations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chaucer and Marco Polo.]\r\n\r\n[78 _bis._—In the third volume of _The Complete Works of Geoffrey\r\nChaucer_, Oxford, 1894, the Rev. Walter W. Skeat gives (pp. 372\r\n_seqq._) an _Account of the Sources of the Canterbury Tales_. Regarding\r\n_The Squieres Tales_, he says that one of his sources was the Travels\r\nof Marco; Mr. Keighley in his _Tales and Popular Fictions_, published\r\nin 1834, at p. 76, distinctly derives Chaucer’s Tale from the travels\r\nof Marco Polo. (_Skeat, l. c._, p. 463, note.) I cannot quote all the\r\narguments given by the Rev. W. W. Skeat to support his theory, pp.\r\n463–477.\r\n\r\nRegarding the opinion of Professor Skeat of Chaucer’s indebtedness to\r\nMarco Polo, cf. _Marco Polo and the Squire’s Tale_, by Professor John\r\nMatthews Manly, vol. xi. of the _Publications of the Modern Language\r\nAssociation of America_, 1896, pp. 349–362. Mr. Manly says (p. 360):\r\n“It seems clear, upon reviewing the whole problem, that if Chaucer used\r\nMarco Polo’s narrative, he either carelessly or intentionally confused\r\nall the features of the setting that could possibly be confused, and\r\nretained not a single really characteristic trait of any person,\r\nplace or event. It is only by twisting everything that any part of\r\nChaucer’s story can be brought into relation with any part of Polo’s.\r\nTo do this might be allowable, if any rational explanation could be\r\ngiven for Chaucer’s supposed treatment of his ‘author,’ or if there\r\nwere any scarcity of sources from which Chaucer might have obtained as\r\nmuch information about Tartary as he seems really to have possessed;\r\nbut such an explanation would be difficult to devise, and there is\r\nno such scarcity. Any one of half a dozen accessible accounts could\r\nbe distorted into almost if not quite as great resemblance to the\r\n_Squire’s Tale_ as Marco Polo’s can.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. W. Pollard, in his edition of _The Squire’s Tale_ (Lond.,\r\n1899) writes: “A very able paper, by Prof. J. M. Manly, demonstrates\r\nthe needlessness of Prof. Skeat’s theory, which has introduced fresh\r\ncomplications into an already complicated story. My own belief is that,\r\nthough we may illustrate the Squire’s Tale from these old accounts\r\nof Tartary, and especially from Marco Polo, because he has been so\r\nwell edited by Colonel Yule, there is very little probability that\r\nChaucer consulted any of them. It is much more likely that he found\r\nthese details where he found more important parts of his story, _i.e._\r\nin some lost romance. But if we must suppose that he provided his own\r\nlocal colour, we have no right to pin him down to using Marco Polo to\r\nthe exclusion of other accessible authorities.” Mr. Pollard adds in a\r\nnote (p. xiii.): “There are some features in these narratives, _e.g._\r\nthe account of the gorgeous dresses worn at the Kaan’s feast, which\r\nChaucer with his love of colour could hardly have helped reproducing if\r\nhe had known them.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] See _Ferrazzi, Manuele Dantesca_, Bassano, 1865, p. 729.\r\n\r\n[2] In Quaritch’s catalogue for Nov. 1870 there is only one old edition\r\n    of Polo; there are _nine_ of Maundevile. In 1839 there were\r\n    nineteen MSS. of the latter author _catalogued_ in the British\r\n    Museum Library. There are _now_ only six of Marco Polo. At least\r\n    twenty-five editions of Maundevile and only five of Polo were\r\n    printed in the 15th century.\r\n\r\n[3] I have made personal enquiry at the National Libraries of Naples\r\n    and Palermo, at the Communal Library in the latter city, and at the\r\n    Benedictine Libraries of Monte Cassino, Monreale, S. Martino, and\r\n    Catania.\r\n\r\n    In the 15th century, when Polo’s book had become more generally\r\n    diffused we find three copies of it in the Catalogue of the Library\r\n    of Charles VI. of France, made at the Louvre in 1423, by order of\r\n    the Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\n    The estimates of value are curious. They are in _sols parisis_,\r\n    which we shall not estimate very wrongly at a shilling each:—\r\n\r\n    “No. 295. _Item_.

The latter passage runs\r\n    thus, on _Slavery_:—\r\n\r\n    “E fu indutta prima da Noé,\r\n     E fu cagion lo vin, perchè si egge:\r\n     Ch’egli è un paese, dove\r\n     Son molti servi in parte di Cathay:\r\n     Che per questa cagione\r\n     Hanno a nimico il vino,\r\n     E non ne beon, nè voglion vedere.”\r\n\r\n    The author was born the year before Dante (1264), and though he\r\n    lived to 1348 it is probable that the poems in question were\r\n    written in his earlier years. _Cathay_ was no doubt known by dim\r\n    repute long before the final return of the Polos, both through\r\n    the original journey of Nicolo and Maffeo, and by information\r\n    gathered by the Missionary Friars. Indeed, in 1278 Pope Nicolas\r\n    III., in consequence of information said to have come from Abaka\r\n    Khan of Persia, that Kúblái was a baptised Christian, sent a party\r\n    of Franciscans with a long letter to the Kaan _Quobley_, as he is\r\n    termed. They never seem to have reached their destination. And in\r\n    1289 Nicolas IV. entrusted a similar mission to Friar John of Monte\r\n    Corvino, which eventually led to very tangible results. Neither of\r\n    the Papal letters, however, mentions _Cathay_. (See _Mosheim_, App.\r\n    pp. 76 and 94.)\r\n\r\n[5] See _Muratori_, IX. 583, _seqq._; _Bianconi_, Mem. I. p. 37.\r\n\r\n[6] This Friar makes a strange hotch-potch of what he had read, _e.g._:\r\n    “The Tartars, when they came out of the mountains, made them a\r\n    king, viz., the son of Prester John, who is thus vulgarly termed\r\n    _Vetulus de la Montagna!_” (_Mon. Hist. Patr._ Script. III. 1557.)\r\n\r\n[7] G. Villani died in the great plague of 1348. But his book was begun\r\n    soon after Marco’s was written, for he states that it was the sight\r\n    of the memorials of greatness which he witnessed at Rome, during\r\n    the Jubilee of 1300, that put it into his head to write the history\r\n    of the rising glories of Florence, and that he began the work after\r\n    his return home.

It often appears in old Persian\r\n    carpets, and also in Chinese designs. Mr. Purdon Clarke tells me\r\n    it is called _nebula_ in heraldry; it is also called in Chinese\r\n    by a term signifying cloud; in Persian, by a term which he called\r\n    _silen-i-khitai_, but of this I can make nothing.—_MS. Note by\r\n    Yule_.]\r\n\r\n[11] The great Magellanic cloud? In the account of Vincent Yanez\r\n    Pinzon’s Voyage to the S.W. in 1499 as given in Ramusio (III. 15)\r\n    after Pietro Martire d’Anghieria, it is said:—“Taking the astrolabe\r\n    in hand, and ascertaining the Antarctic Pole, they did not see any\r\n    star like our Pole Star; but they related that they saw another\r\n    manner of stars very different from ours, and which they could not\r\n    clearly discern because of a certain dimness which diffused itself\r\n    about those stars, and obstructed the view of them.” Also the Kachh\r\n    mariners told Lieutenant Leech that midway to Zanzibar there was a\r\n    town (?) called Marethee, where the North Pole Star sinks below the\r\n    horizon, and they steer by _a fixed cloud in the heavens_. (Bombay\r\n    Govt. Selections, No. XV. N.S. p. 215.)\r\n\r\n    The great Magellan cloud is mentioned by an old Arab writer as a\r\n    white blotch at the foot of Canopus, visible in the Tehama along\r\n    the Red Sea, but not in Nejd or ’Irák. Humboldt, in quoting this,\r\n    calculates that in A.D. 1000 the Great Magellan would have been\r\n    visible at Aden some degrees above the horizon. (_Examen_, V. 235.)\r\n\r\n[12] This passage contains points that are omitted in Polo’s book,\r\n    besides the drawing implied to be from Marco’s own hand! The island\r\n    is of course Sumatra. The animal is perhaps the peculiar Sumatran\r\n    wild-goat, figured by Marsden, the hair of which on the back is\r\n    “coarse and strong, almost like bristles.” (_Sumatra_, p. 115.)\r\n\r\n[13] A splendid example of Abbot John’s Collection is the _Livre des\r\n    Merveilles_ of the Great French Library (No. 18 in our _App. F._).\r\n    This contains Polo, Odoric, William of Boldensel, the Book of the\r\n    Estate of the Great Kaan by the Archbishop of Soltania, Maundevile,\r\n    Hayton, and Ricold of Montecroce, of which all but Polo and\r\n    Maundevile are French versions by this excellent Long John. A list\r\n    of the Polo miniatures is given in _App. F_. of this Edition, p.\r\n    527.\r\n\r\n    It is a question for which there is sufficient ground, whether\r\n    the Persian Historians Rashiduddin and Wassáf, one or other or\r\n    both, did not derive certain information that appears in their\r\n    histories, from Marco Polo personally, he having spent many months\r\n    in Persia, and at the Court of Tabriz, when either or both may\r\n    have been there. Such passages as that about the Cotton-trees of\r\n    Guzerat (vol. ii. p. 393, and note), those about the horse trade\r\n    with Maabar (id. p. 340, and note), about the brother-kings of that\r\n    country (id. p. 331), about the naked savages of Necuveram (id. p.\r\n    306), about the wild people of Sumatra calling themselves subjects\r\n    of the Great Kaan (id. pp. 285, 292, 293, 299), have so strong\r\n    a resemblance to parallel passages in one or both of the above\r\n    historians, as given in the first and third volumes of Elliot, that\r\n    the probability, at least, of the Persian writers having derived\r\n    their information from Polo might be fairly maintained.\r\n\r\n[14] _Li Romans de Bauduin de Sebourc IIIᵉ Roy de Jhérusalem_; Poēme\r\n    du XIVᵉ Siècle; Valenciennes, 1841. 2 vols. 8vo.

NATURE OF POLO’S INFLUENCE ON GEOGRAPHICAL\r\n                              KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tardy operation, and causes thereof.]\r\n\r\n79. Marco Polo contributed such a vast amount of new facts to the\r\nknowledge of the Earth’s surface, that one might have expected his book\r\nto have had a sudden effect upon the Science of Geography: but no such\r\nresult occurred speedily, nor was its beneficial effect of any long\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nNo doubt several causes contributed to the slowness of its action\r\nupon the notions of Cosmographers, of which the unreal character\r\nattributed to the Book, as a collection of romantic marvels rather than\r\nof geographical and historical facts, may have been one, as Santarem\r\nurges. But the essential causes were no doubt the imperfect nature\r\nof publication before the invention of the press; the traditional\r\ncharacter which clogged geography as well as all other branches of\r\nknowledge in the Middle Ages; and the entire absence of scientific\r\nprinciple in what passed for geography, so that there was no organ\r\ncompetent to the assimilation of a large mass of new knowledge.\r\n\r\nOf the action of the first cause no examples can be more striking than\r\nwe find in the false conception of the Caspian as a gulf of the Ocean,\r\nentertained by Strabo, and the opposite error in regard to the Indian\r\nSea held by Ptolemy, who regards it as an enclosed basin, when we\r\ncontrast these with the correct ideas on both subjects possessed by\r\nHerodotus. The later Geographers no doubt knew his statements, but did\r\nnot appreciate them, probably from not possessing the evidence on which\r\nthey were based.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General characteristics of Mediæval Cosmography.]\r\n\r\n80. As regards the second cause alleged, we may say that down nearly to\r\nthe middle of the 15th century cosmographers, as a rule, made scarcely\r\nany attempt to reform their maps by any elaborate search for new\r\nmatter, or by lights that might be collected from recent travellers.\r\nTheir world was in its outline that handed down by the traditions\r\nof their craft, as sanctioned by some Father of the Church, such as\r\nOrosius or Isidore, as sprinkled with a combination of classical and\r\nmediæval legend; Solinus being the great authority for the former.\r\nAlmost universally the earth’s surface is represented as filling the\r\ngreater part of a circular disk, rounded by the ocean; a fashion\r\nthat already existed in the time of Aristotle and was ridiculed by\r\nhim.[1] No dogma of false geography was more persistent or more\r\npernicious than this. Jerusalem occupies the central point, because\r\nit was found written in the Prophet Ezekiel: “_Haec dicit Dominus\r\nDeus: Ista est Jerusalem_, in medio gentium _posui eam, et in circuitu\r\nejus terras_;”[2] a declaration supposed to be corroborated by the\r\nPsalmist’s expression, regarded as prophetic of the death of Our Lord:\r\n“_Deus autem, Rex noster, ante secula operatus est salutem_ in medio\r\nTerrae” (Ps. lxxiii. 12).[3] The Terrestrial Paradise was represented\r\nas occupying the extreme East, because it was found in Genesis that\r\nthe Lord planted a garden eastward in Eden.[4] _Gog and Magog_ were\r\nset in the far north or north-east, because it was said again in\r\nEzekiel: “_Ecce Ego super te Gog Principem capitis Mosoch et Thubal\r\n... et ascendere te faciam de lateribus Aquilonis_,” whilst probably\r\nthe topography of those mysterious nationalities was completed by\r\na girdle of mountains out of the Alexandrian Fables. The loose and\r\nscanty nomenclature was mainly borrowed from Pliny or Mela through\r\nsuch Fathers as we have named; whilst vacant spaces were occupied\r\nby Amazons, Arimaspians, and the realm of Prester John. A favourite\r\nrepresentation of the inhabited earth was this [circled T]; a great O\r\nenclosing a T, which thus divides the circle in three parts; the\r\ngreater or half-circle being Asia, the two quarter circles Europe and\r\nAfrica.[5] These Maps were known to St. Augustine.[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger Bacon as a geographer.]\r\n\r\n81. Even Ptolemy seems to have been almost unknown; and indeed had his\r\nGeography been studied it might, with all its errors, have tended to\r\nsome greater endeavours after accuracy. Roger Bacon, whilst lamenting\r\nthe exceeding deficiency of geographical knowledge in the Latin\r\nworld, and purposing to essay an exacter distribution of countries,\r\nsays he will not attempt to do so by latitude and longitude, for that\r\nis a system of which the Latins have learned nothing. He himself,\r\nwhilst still somewhat burdened by the authoritative dicta of “saints\r\nand sages” of past times, ventures at least to criticise some of the\r\nlatter, such as Pliny and Ptolemy, and declares his intention to\r\nhave recourse to the information of those who have travelled most\r\nextensively over the Earth’s surface. And judging from the good use\r\nhe makes, in his description of the northern parts of the world, of\r\nthe Travels of Rubruquis, whom he had known and questioned, besides\r\ndiligently studying his narrative,[7] we might have expected much in\r\nGeography from this great man, had similar materials been available\r\nto him for other parts of the earth. He did attempt a map with\r\nmathematical determination of places, but it has not been preserved.[8]\r\n\r\nIt may be said with general truth that the world-maps current up\r\nto the end of the 13th century had more analogy to the mythical\r\ncosmography of the Hindus than to any thing properly geographical.\r\nBoth, no doubt, were originally based in the main on real features. In\r\nthe Hindu cosmography these genuine features are symmetrised as in a\r\nkaleidoscope; in the European cartography they are squeezed together in\r\na manner that one can only compare to a pig in brawn. Here and there\r\nsome feature strangely compressed and distorted is just recognisable.\r\nA splendid example of this kind of map is that famous one at Hereford,\r\nexecuted about A.D. 1275, of which a facsimile has lately been\r\npublished, accompanied by a highly meritorious illustrative Essay.[9]\r\n\r\n82. Among the Arabs many able men, from the early days of Islám,\r\ntook an interest in Geography, and devoted labour to geographical\r\ncompilations, in which they often made use of their own observations,\r\nof the itineraries of travellers, and of other fresh knowledge. But\r\nsomehow or other their maps were always far behind their books.\r\nThough they appear to have had an early translation of Ptolemy, and\r\nelaborate Tables of Latitudes and Longitudes form a prominent feature\r\nin many of their geographical treatises, there appears to be no Arabic\r\nmap in existence, laid down with meridians and parallels; whilst\r\n_all_ of their best known maps are on the old system of the circular\r\ndisk. This apparent incapacity for map-making appears to have acted\r\nas a heavy drag and bar upon progress in Geography among the Arabs,\r\nnotwithstanding its early promise among them, and in spite of the\r\napplication to its furtherance of the great intellects of some (such\r\nas Abu Rihán al-Biruni), and of the indefatigable spirit of travel and\r\nomnivorous curiosity of others (such as Mas’udi).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marino Sanudo the Elder.]\r\n\r\n83. Some distinct trace of acquaintance with the Arabian Geography is\r\nto be found in the World-Map of Marino Sanudo the Elder, constructed\r\nbetween 1300 and 1320; and this may be regarded as an exceptionally\r\nfavourable specimen of the cosmography in vogue, for the author was a\r\ndiligent investigator and compiler, who evidently took a considerable\r\ninterest in geographical questions, and had a strong enjoyment and\r\nappreciation of a map.[10] Nor is the map in question without some\r\nresult of these characteristics. His representation of Europe,\r\nNorthern Africa, Syria, Asia Minor, Arabia and its two gulfs, is a\r\nfair approximation to general facts; his collected knowledge has\r\nenabled him to locate, with more or less of general truth, Georgia,\r\nthe Iron Gates, Cathay, the Plain of Moghan, Euphrates and Tigris,\r\nPersia, Bagdad, Kais, Aden (though on the wrong side of the Red Sea),\r\nAbyssinia (_Habesh_), Zangibar (_Zinz_), Jidda (Zede), etc. But after\r\nall the traditional forms are too strong for him. Jerusalem is still\r\nthe centre of the disk of the habitable earth, so that the distance is\r\nas great from Syria to Gades in the extreme West, as from Syria to the\r\nIndia Interior of Prester John which terminates the extreme East. And\r\nAfrica beyond the Arabian Gulf is carried, according to the Arabian\r\nmodification of Ptolemy’s misconception, far to the eastward until it\r\nalmost meets the prominent shores of India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Catalan Map of 1375, the most complete mediæval\r\nembodiment of Polo’s Geography.]\r\n\r\n84. The first genuine mediæval attempt at a geographical construction\r\nthat I know of, absolutely free from the traditional _idola_, is\r\nthe Map of the known World from the Portulano Mediceo (in the\r\nLaurentian Library), of which an extract is engraved in the atlas\r\nof Baldelli-Boni’s Polo. I need not describe it, however, because I\r\ncannot satisfy myself that it makes much use of Polo’s contributions,\r\nand its facts have been embodied in a more ambitious work of the next\r\ngeneration, the celebrated Catalan Map of 1375 in the great Library of\r\nParis. This also, but on a larger scale and in a more comprehensive\r\nmanner, is an honest endeavour to represent the known world on the\r\nbasis of collected facts, casting aside all theories pseudo-scientific\r\nor pseudo-theological; and a very remarkable work it is. In this map it\r\nseems to me Marco Polo’s influence, I will not say on geography, but on\r\nmap-making, is seen to the greatest advantage. His Book is the basis of\r\nthe Map as regards Central and Further Asia, and partially as regards\r\nIndia. His names are often sadly perverted, and it is not always easy\r\nto understand the view that the compiler took of his itineraries. Still\r\nwe have Cathay admirably placed in the true position of China, as a\r\ngreat Empire filling the south-east of Asia. The Eastern Peninsula of\r\nIndia is indeed absent altogether, but the Peninsula of Hither India\r\nis for the first time in the History of Geography represented with a\r\nfair approximation to its correct form and position,[11] and Sumatra\r\nalso (_Jaua_) is not badly placed. Carajan, Vocian, Mien, and Bangala,\r\nare located with a happy conception of their relation to Cathay and to\r\nIndia. Many details in India foreign to Polo’s book,[12] and some in\r\nCathay (as well as in Turkestan and Siberia, which have been entirely\r\nderived from other sources) have been embodied in the Map. But the\r\nstudy of his Book has, I conceive, been essentially the basis of those\r\ngreat portions which I have specified, and the additional matter has\r\nnot been in mass sufficient to perplex the compiler. Hence we really\r\nsee in this Map something like the idea of Asia that the Traveller\r\nhimself would have presented, had he bequeathed a Map to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of the Catalan Map (1375).]\r\n\r\n[Some years ago, I made a special study of the Far East in the Catalan\r\nMap (_L’Extrême-Orient dans l’Atlas catalan de Charles V._, Paris,\r\n1895), and I have come to the conclusion that the cartographer’s\r\nknowledge of Eastern Asia is drawn almost entirely from Marco Polo. We\r\ngive a reproduction of part of the Catalan Map.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusions in Cartography of the 16th century, from the\r\nendeavour to combine new and old information.]\r\n\r\n85. In the following age we find more frequent indications that Polo’s\r\nbook was diffused and read. And now that the spirit of discovery\r\nbegan to stir, it was apparently regarded in a juster light as a\r\nBook of Facts, and not as a mere _Romman du Grant Kaan_.[13] But in\r\nfact this age produced new supplies of crude information in greater\r\nabundance than the knowledge of geographers was prepared to digest or\r\nco-ordinate, and the consequence is that the magnificent Work of Fra\r\nMauro (1459), though the result of immense labour in the collection of\r\nfacts and the endeavour to combine them, really gives a considerably\r\nless accurate idea of Asia than that which the Catalan Map had\r\nafforded.[14]\r\n\r\nAnd when at a still later date the great burst of discovery eastward\r\nand westward took effect, the results of all attempts to combine the\r\nnew knowledge with the old was most unhappy. The first and crudest\r\nforms of such combinations attempted to realise the ideas of Columbus\r\nregarding the identity of his discoveries with the regions of the\r\nGreat Kaan’s dominion;[15] but even after AMERICA had vindicated\r\nits independent position on the surface of the globe, and the new\r\nknowledge of the Portuguese had introduced CHINA where the Catalan Map\r\nof the 14th century had presented CATHAY, the latter country, with the\r\nwhole of Polo’s nomenclature, was shoved away to the north, forming\r\na separate system.[16] Henceforward the influence of Polo’s work on\r\nmaps was simply injurious; and when to his nomenclature was added a\r\nsprinkling of Ptolemy’s, as was usual throughout the 16th century, the\r\nresult was a most extraordinary hotch-potch, conveying no approximation\r\nto any consistent representation of facts.\r\n\r\nThus, in a map of 1522,[17] running the eye along the north of Europe\r\nand Asia from West to East, we find the following succession of names:\r\nGroenlandia, or Greenland, as a great peninsula overlapping that\r\nof Norvegia and Suecia; Livonia, Plescovia and Moscovia, Tartaria\r\nbounded on the South by _Scithia extra Imaum_, and on the East, by\r\nthe Rivers _Ochardes_ and _Bautisis_ (out of Ptolemy), which are made\r\nto flow into the Arctic Sea. South of these are _Aureacithis_ and\r\n_Asmirea_ (Ptolemy’s _Auxacitis_ and _Asmiræa_), and _Serica Regio_.\r\nThen following the northern coast _Balor Regio_,[18] _Judei Clausi_,\r\n_i.e._ the Ten Tribes who are constantly associated or confounded with\r\nthe Shut-up Nations of Gog and Magog. These impinge upon the River\r\n_Polisacus_, flowing into the Northern Ocean in Lat. 75°, but which is\r\nin fact no other than Polo’s _Pulisanghin_![19] Immediately south of\r\nthis is _Tholomon Provincia_ (Polo’s again), and on the coast _Tangut_,\r\n_Cathaya_, the Rivers _Caramoran_ and _Oman_ (a misreading of Polo’s\r\n_Quian_), _Quinsay_ and _Mangi_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gradual disappearance of Polo’s nomenclature.]\r\n\r\n86. The Maps of Mercator (1587) and Magini (1597) are similar in\r\ncharacter, but more elaborate, introducing China as a separate system.\r\nSuch indeed also is Blaeu’s Map (1663) excepting that Ptolemy’s\r\ncontributions are reduced to one or two.\r\n\r\nIn Sanson’s Map (1659) the data of Polo and the mediæval Travellers are\r\nmore cautiously handled, but a new element of confusion is introduced\r\nin the form of numerous features derived from Edrisi.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely worth while to follow the matter further. With the\r\nincrease of knowledge of Northern Asia from the Russian side, and that\r\nof China from the Maps of Martini, followed by the surveys of the\r\nJesuits, and with the real science brought to bear on Asiatic Geography\r\nby such men as De l’Isle and D’Anville, mere traditional nomenclature\r\ngradually disappeared. And the task which the study of Polo has\r\nprovided for the geographers of later days has been chiefly that of\r\ndetermining the true localities that his book describes under obsolete\r\nor corrupted names.\r\n\r\n[My late illustrious friend, Baron _A. E. Nordenskiöld_, who has\r\ndevoted much time and labour to the study of Marco Polo (see his\r\n_Periplus_, Stockholm, 1897), and published a facsimile edition of one\r\nof the French MSS. kept in the Stockholm Royal Library (see vol. ii.\r\n_Bibliography_, p. 570), has given to _The Geographical Journal_ for\r\nApril, 1899, pp. 396–406, a paper on _The Influence of the “Travels\r\nof Marco Polo” on Jacobo Gastaldi’s Maps of Asia_. He writes (p. 398)\r\nthat as far as he knows, none “of the many learned men who have devoted\r\ntheir attention to the discoveries of Marco Polo, have been able to\r\nrefer to any maps in which all or almost all those places mentioned\r\nby Marco Polo are given. All friends of the history of geography will\r\ntherefore be glad to hear that such an atlas from the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century really does exist, viz. Gastaldi’s ‘Prima, seconda\r\ne terza parte dell’Asia.’” All the names of places in Ramusio’s Marco\r\nPolo are introduced in the maps of Asia of Jacobo Gastaldi (1561).

C.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alleged introduction of Block-printed Books into Europe by\r\nMarco Polo.]\r\n\r\n87. Before concluding, it may be desirable to say a few words on the\r\nsubject of important knowledge other than geographical, which various\r\npersons have supposed that Marco Polo must have introduced from Eastern\r\nAsia to Europe.\r\n\r\nRespecting the mariner’s compass and gunpowder I shall say nothing, as\r\nno one now, I believe, imagines Marco to have had anything to do with\r\ntheir introduction. But from a highly respectable source in recent\r\nyears we have seen the introduction of Block-printing into Europe\r\nconnected with the name of our Traveller. The circumstances are stated\r\nas follows:[20]\r\n\r\n  “In the beginning of the 15th century a man named Pamphilo\r\n  Castaldi, of Feltre ... was employed by the Seignory or Government\r\n  of the Republic, to engross deeds and public edicts of various\r\n  kinds ... the initial letters at the commencement of the writing\r\n  being usually ornamented with red ink, or illuminated in gold and\r\n  colours.\r\n\r\n  “According to Sansovino, certain stamps or types had been invented\r\n  some time previously by Pietro di Natali, Bishop of Aquilœa.[21]\r\n  These were made at Murano of glass, and were used to stamp or print\r\n  the outline of the large initial letters of public documents, which\r\n  were afterwards filled up by hand.... Pamphilo Castaldi improved\r\n  on these glass types, by having others made of wood or metal,\r\n  and having seen several Chinese books which the famous traveller\r\n  Marco Polo had brought from China, and of which the entire text\r\n  was printed with wooden blocks, he caused moveable wooden types to\r\n  be made, each type containing a single letter; and with these he\r\n  printed several broadsides and single leaves, at Venice, in the\r\n  year 1426. Some of these single sheets are said to be preserved\r\n  among the archives at Feltre....\r\n\r\n  “The tradition continues that John Faust, of Mayence ... became\r\n  acquainted with Castaldi, and passed some time with him, at his\r\n  _Scriptorium_, ... at Feltre;”\r\n\r\nand in short developed from the knowledge so acquired the great\r\ninvention of printing. Mr. Curzon goes on to say that Panfilo Castaldi\r\nwas born in 1398, and died in 1490, and that he gives the story as\r\nhe found it in an article written by Dr. Jacopo Facen, of Feltre,\r\nin a (Venetian?) newspaper called _Il Gondoliere_, No. 103, of 27th\r\nDecember, 1843.\r\n\r\nIn a later paper Mr. Curzon thus recurs to the subject:[22]\r\n\r\n  “Though none of the early block-books have dates affixed to them,\r\n  many of them are with reason supposed to be more ancient than any\r\n  books printed with moveable types. Their resemblance to Chinese\r\n  block-books is so exact, that they would almost seem to be copied\r\n  from the books commonly used in China. _The impressions are taken\r\n  off on one side of the paper only, and in binding, both the\r\n  Chinese, and ancient German, or Dutch block-books, the blank sides\r\n  of the pages are placed opposite each other_, and sometimes pasted\r\n  together.... The impressions are not taken off with printer’s ink,\r\n  but _with a brown paint or colour, of a much thinner description,\r\n  more in the nature of Indian ink, as we call it, which is used\r\n  in printing Chinese books_. Altogether the German and Oriental\r\n  block-books are so precisely alike, in almost every respect, that\r\n  ... we must suppose that the process of printing then must have\r\n  been copied from ancient Chinese specimens, brought from that\r\n  country by some early travellers, whose names have not been handed\r\n  down to our times.”\r\n\r\nThe writer then refers to the tradition about _Guttemberg_ (so it is\r\nstated on this occasion, not Faust) having learned Castaldi’s art,\r\netc., mentioning a circumstance which he supposes to indicate that\r\nGuttemberg had relations with Venice; and appears to assent to the\r\nprobability of the story of the art having been founded on specimens\r\nbrought home by Marco Polo.\r\n\r\nThis story was in recent years diligently propagated in Northern Italy,\r\nand resulted in the erection at Feltre of a public statue of Panfilo\r\nCastaldi, bearing this inscription (besides others of like tenor):—\r\n\r\n  “_To Panfilo Castaldi the illustrious Inventor of Movable Printing\r\n  Types, Italy renders this Tribute of Honour, too long deferred._”\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book I devoted a special note to the\r\nexposure of the worthlessness of the evidence for this story.[23] This\r\nnote was, with the present Essay, translated and published at Venice by\r\nComm. Berchet, but this challenge to the supporters of the patriotic\r\nromance, so far as I have heard, brought none of them into the lists in\r\nits defence.\r\n\r\nBut since Castaldi has got his statue from the printers of Lombardy,\r\nwould it not be mere equity that the mariners of Spain should set up\r\na statue at Huelva to the Pilot Alonzo Sanchez of that port, who,\r\naccording to Spanish historians, after discovering the New World, died\r\nin the house of Columbus at Terceira, and left the crafty Genoese to\r\nappropriate his journals, and rob him of his fame?\r\n\r\nSeriously; if anybody in Feltre cares for the real reputation of\r\nhis native city, let him do his best to have that preposterous and\r\ndiscreditable fiction removed from the base of the statue. If Castaldi\r\nhas deserved a statue on other and truer grounds let _him_ stand; if\r\nnot, let him be burnt into honest lime! I imagine that the original\r\nstory that attracted Mr. Curzon was more _jeu d’esprit_ than anything\r\nelse; but that the author, finding what a stone he had set rolling, did\r\nnot venture to retract.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frequent opportunities for such introduction in the age\r\nfollowing Polo’s.]\r\n\r\n88. Mr. Curzon’s own observations, which I have italicised about\r\nthe resemblance of the two systems are, however, very striking,\r\nand seem clearly to indicate the derivation of the art from China.\r\nBut I should suppose that in the tradition, if there ever was any\r\ngenuine tradition of the kind at Feltre (a circumstance worthy of all\r\ndoubt), the name of Marco Polo was introduced merely because it was\r\nso prominent a name in Eastern Travel. The fact has been generally\r\noverlooked and forgotten[24] that, for many years in the course of\r\nthe 14th century, not only were missionaries of the Roman Church and\r\nHouses of the Franciscan Order established in the chief cities of\r\nChina, but a regular trade was carried on overland between Italy and\r\nChina, by way of Tana (or Azov), Astracan, Otrar and Kamul, insomuch\r\nthat instructions for the Italian merchant following that route form\r\nthe two first chapters in the Mercantile Handbook of Balducci Pegolotti\r\n(_circa_ 1340).[25] Many a traveller besides Marco Polo might therefore\r\nhave brought home the block-books. And this is the less to be ascribed\r\nto him because he so curiously omits to speak of the art of printing,\r\nwhen his subject seems absolutely to challenge its description.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] “They draw nowadays the map of the world in a laughable manner, for\r\n    they draw the inhabited earth as a circle; but this is impossible,\r\n    both from what we see and from reason.” (_Meteorolog. Lib._ II.\r\n    cap. 5.) Cf. _Herodotus_, iv. 36.\r\n\r\n[2] In Dante’s Cosmography, Jerusalem is the centre of our οἰκουμένη,\r\n    whilst the Mount of Purgatory occupies the middle of the Antipodal\r\n    hemisphere:—\r\n\r\n      “Come ciò sia, se’ l vuoi poter pensare,\r\n         Dentro raccolto immagina Sion\r\n         Con questo monte in su la terra stare,\r\n       Sì, ch’ambodue hann’un solo orrizon\r\n         E diversi emisperi”....\r\n                                —_Purg._ IV. 67.\r\n\r\n[3] The belief, with this latter ground of it, is alluded to in curious\r\n    verses by Jacopo Alighieri, Dante’s son:—\r\n\r\n      “_E molti gran Profeti_\r\n       _Filosofi e Poeti_\r\n       Fanno il colco dell’Emme\r\n       Dov’è Gerusalemme;\r\n       _Se le loro scritture_\r\n       _Hanno vere figure:_\r\n       _E per la Santa fede_\r\n       _Cristiana ancor si vede_\r\n       _Che’ l’ suo principio Cristo_\r\n       Nel suo mezzo _conquisto_\r\n       _Per cui prese morte_\r\n       _E vi pose la sorte_.”\r\n             —(_Rime Antiche Toscane_, III. 9.)\r\n\r\n    Though the general meaning of the second couplet is obvious,\r\n    the expression _il colco dell’Emme_, “the couch of the M,” is\r\n    puzzling. The best solution that occurs to me is this: In looking\r\n    at the world map of Marino Sanudo, noticed on p. _133_, as engraved\r\n    by Bongars in the _Gesta Dei per Francos_, you find geometrical\r\n    lines laid down, connecting the N.E., N.W., S.E., and S.W. points,\r\n    and thus forming a square inscribed in the circular disk of the\r\n    Earth, with its diagonals passing through the Central Zion. The eye\r\n    easily discerns in these a great M inscribed in the circle, with\r\n    its middle angular point at Jerusalem. Gervasius of Tilbury (with\r\n    some confusion in his mind between tropic and equinoxial, like that\r\n    which Pliny makes in speaking of the Indian Mons Malleus) says that\r\n    “some are of opinion that the Centre is in the place where the Lord\r\n    spoke to the woman of Samaria at the well, for there, at the summer\r\n    solstice, the noonday sun descends perpendicularly into the water\r\n    of the well, casting no shadow; a thing which the philosophers say\r\n    occurs at Syene”! (_Otia Imperialia_, by Liebrecht, p. 1.)\r\n\r\n[4] This circumstance does not, however, show in the Vulgate.\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n        “Veggiamo in prima in general la terra\r\n         Come risiede e come il mar la serra.\r\n\r\n         Un T dentro ad un O mostra il disegno\r\n           Come in tre parti fu diviso il Mondo,\r\n           E la superiore è il maggior regno\r\n           Che quasi piglia la metà del tondo.\r\n           ASIA chiamata: il gambo ritto è segno\r\n           Che parte il terzo nome dal secondo\r\n           AFFRICA dico da EUROPA: il mare\r\n           Mediterran tra esse in mezzo appare.”\r\n                  —_La Sfera_, di F.

But besides these maps, he gives,\r\n    in a tabular form of parallel columns, the reigning sovereigns in\r\n    Europe and Asia connected with his historical retrospect, just on\r\n    the plan presented in Sir Harris Nicolas’s Chronology of History.\r\n\r\n[11] I do not see that al-Birúni deserves the credit in this respect\r\n    assigned to him by Professor Peschel, so far as one can judge\r\n    from the data given by Sprenger (_Peschel_, p. 128; _Post und\r\n    Reise-Routen_, 81–82.)\r\n\r\n[12] For example, _Delli_, which Polo does not name; _Diogil_ (Deogír);\r\n    on the Coromandel coast _Setemelti_, which I take to be a clerical\r\n    error for _Sette-Templi_, the Seven Pagodas; round the Gulf of\r\n    Cambay we have _Cambetum_ (Kambayat), _Cocintaya_ (Kokan-Tana, see\r\n    vol. ii. p. 396), _Goga, Baroche, Neruala_ (Anharwala), and to the\r\n    north _Moltan_. Below Multan are _Hocibelch_ and _Bargelidoa_, two\r\n    puzzles. The former is, I think, _Uch-baligh_, showing that part of\r\n    the information was from Perso-Mongol sources.\r\n\r\n[13] I see it stated by competent authority that _Romman_ is often\r\n    applied to any prose composition in a Romance language.\r\n\r\n    In or about 1426, Prince Pedro of Portugal, the elder brother of\r\n    the illustrious Prince Henry, being on a visit to Venice, was\r\n    presented by the Signory with a copy of Marco Polo’s book, together\r\n    with a map already alluded to. (_Major’s P. Henry_, pp. 61, 62.)\r\n\r\n[14] This is partly due also to Fra Mauro’s reversion to the fancy of\r\n    the circular disk limiting the inhabited portion of the earth.\r\n\r\n[15] An early graphic instance of this is Ruysch’s famous map\r\n    (1508). The following extract of a work printed as late as 1533\r\n    is an example of the like confusion in verbal description: “The\r\n    Territories which are beyond the limits of Ptolemy’s Tables have\r\n    not yet been described on certain authority. Behind the Sinae and\r\n    the Seres, and beyond 180° of East Longitude, many countries were\r\n    discovered by one [_quendam_] Marco Polo a Venetian and others,\r\n    and the sea-coasts of those countries have now recently again been\r\n    explored by Columbus the Genoese and Amerigo Vespucci in navigating\r\n    the Western Ocean.... To this part (of Asia) belong the territory\r\n    called that of the _Bachalaos_ [or Codfish, Newfoundland],\r\n    _Florida_, _the Desert of Lop_, _Tangut_, _Cathay_, the realm of\r\n    _Mexico_ (wherein is the vast city of _Temistitan_, built in the\r\n    middle of a great lake, but which the older travellers styled\r\n    QUINSAY), besides _Paria_, _Uraba_, and the countries of the\r\n    _Canibals_.” (_Joannis Schoneri Carolostadtii Opusculum Geogr._,\r\n    quoted by Humboldt, _Examen_, V. 171, 172.)\r\n\r\n[16] In Robert Parke’s Dedication of his Translation of Mendoza’s,\r\n    London, 1st of January, 1589, he identifies China and Japan with\r\n    the regions of which _Paulus Venetus_ and _Sir John Mandeuill_\r\n    “wrote long agoe.”—_MS.

(See _Ughelli,\r\n    Italia Sacra_, X. 87.) There is no ground whatever for connecting\r\n    him with these inventions. The story of the glass types appears\r\n    to rest entirely and solely on one obscure passage of Sansovino,\r\n    who says that under the Doge Marco Corner (1365–1367): “_certe\r\n    Natale Veneto lasciò un libro della materie delle forme da giustar\r\n    intorno alle lettere, ed il modo di formarle di vetro_.” There is\r\n    absolutely nothing more. Some kind of stencilling seems indicated.\r\n\r\n[22] _History of Printing in China and Europe_, in _Philobiblon_, vol.\r\n    vi. p. 23.\r\n\r\n[23] See _Appendix L_. in First Edition.\r\n\r\n[24] Ramusio himself appears to have been entirely unconscious of it,\r\n    _vide supra_, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[25] This subject has been fully treated in _Cathay and the Way\r\n    Thither_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         XIV. EXPLANATIONS REGARDING THE BASIS ADOPTED FOR THE\r\n                         PRESENT TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. It remains to say a few words regarding the basis adopted for our\r\nEnglish version of the Traveller’s record.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Text followed by Marsden and by Pauthier.]\r\n\r\nRamusio’s recension was that which Marsden selected for translation.\r\nBut at the date of his most meritorious publication nothing was known\r\nof the real literary history of Polo’s Book, and no one was aware of\r\nthe peculiar value and originality of the French manuscript texts, nor\r\nhad Marsden seen any of them. A translation from one of those texts is\r\na translation at first hand; a translation from Ramusio’s Italian is,\r\nas far as I can judge, the translation of a translated compilation from\r\ntwo or more translations, and therefore, whatever be the merits of its\r\nmatter, inevitably carries us far away from the spirit and style of\r\nthe original narrator. M. Pauthier, I think, did well in adopting for\r\nthe text of his edition the MSS. which I have classed as of the second\r\nType, the more as there had hitherto been no publication from those\r\ntexts. But editing a text in the original language, and translating,\r\nare tasks substantially different in their demands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eclectic formation of the English Text of this Translation.]\r\n\r\n90. It will be clear from what has been said in the preceding pages\r\nthat I should not regard as a fair or full representation of Polo’s\r\nWork, a version on which the Geographic Text did not exercise a\r\nmaterial influence. But to adopt that Text, with all its awkwardnesses\r\nand tautologies, as the absolute subject of translation, would have\r\nbeen a mistake. What I have done has been, in the first instance, to\r\ntranslate from Pauthier’s Text. The process of abridgment in this text,\r\nhowever it came about, has been on the whole judiciously executed,\r\ngetting rid of the intolerable prolixities of manner which belong\r\nto many parts of the Original Dictation, but _as a general rule_\r\npreserving the matter. Having translated this,—not always from the\r\nText adopted by Pauthier himself, but with the exercise of my own\r\njudgment on the various readings which that Editor lays before us,—I\r\nthen compared the translation with the Geographic Text, and transferred\r\nfrom the latter not only all items of real substance that had been\r\nomitted, but also all expressions of special interest and character,\r\nand occasionally a greater fulness of phraseology where condensation\r\nin Pauthier’s text seemed to have been carried too far. And finally I\r\nintroduced _between brackets_ everything peculiar to Ramusio’s version\r\nthat seemed to me to have a just claim to be reckoned authentic, and\r\nthat could be so introduced without harshness or mutilation. Many\r\npassages from the same source which were of interest in themselves, but\r\nfailed to meet one or other of these conditions, have been given in the\r\nnotes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of rendering proper names.]\r\n\r\n91. As regards the reading of proper names and foreign words, in which\r\nthere is so much variation in the different MSS. and editions, I have\r\ndone my best to select what seemed to be the true reading from the G.\r\nT. and Pauthier’s three MSS., only in some rare instances transgressing\r\nthis limit.\r\n\r\nWhere the MSS. in the repetition of a name afforded a choice of forms,\r\nI have selected that which came nearest the real name when known.\r\nThus the G. T. affords _Baldasciain, Badascian, Badasciam, Badausiam,\r\nBalasian_. I adopt BADASCIAN, or in English spelling BADASHAN, because\r\nit is closest to the real name _Badakhshan_. Another place appears as\r\nCOBINAN, _Cabanat, Cobian_. I adopt the first because it is the truest\r\nexpression of the real name _Koh-benán_. In chapters 23, 24 of Book I.,\r\nwe have in the G. T. _Asisim, Asciscin, Asescin_, and in Pauthier’s\r\nMSS. _Hasisins, Harsisins_, etc. I adopt ASCISCIN, or in English\r\nspelling ASHISHIN, for the same reason as before. So with _Creman,\r\nCrerman, Crermain_, QUERMAN, Anglicè KERMAN; Cormos, HORMOS, and many\r\nmore.[2]\r\n\r\nIn two or three cases I have adopted a reading which I cannot show\r\n_literatim_ in any authority, but because such a form appears to be the\r\njust resultant from the variety of readings which are presented; as in\r\nsurveying one takes the mean of a number of observations when no one\r\ncan claim an absolute preference.\r\n\r\nPolo’s proper names, even in the French Texts, are _in the main_ formed\r\non an Italian fashion of spelling.[3] I see no object in preserving\r\nsuch spelling in an English book, so after selecting the best reading\r\nof the name I express it in English spelling, printing _Badashan,\r\nPashai, Kerman_, instead of _Badascian, Pasciai, Querman_, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd when a little trouble has been taken to ascertain the true form and\r\nforce of Polo’s spelling of Oriental names and technical expressions,\r\nit will be found that they are in the main as accurate as Italian lips\r\nand orthography will admit, and not justly liable either to those\r\ndisparaging epithets[4] or to those exegetical distortions which have\r\nbeen too often applied to them. Thus, for example, _Cocacin, Ghel_\r\nor _Ghelan, Tonocain, Cobinan, Ondanique, Barguerlac, Argon, Sensin,\r\nQuescican, Toscaol, Bularguci, Zardandan, Anin, Caugigu, Coloman,\r\nGauenispola, Mutfili, Avarian, Choiach_, are not, it will be seen,\r\nthe ignorant blunderings which the interpretations affixed by some\r\ncommentators would imply them to be, but are, on the contrary, all but\r\nperfectly accurate utterances of the names and words intended.\r\n\r\nThe _-tchéou_ (of French writers), _-choo_, _-chow_, or _-chau_[5]\r\nof English writers, which so frequently forms the terminal part in\r\nthe names of Chinese cities, is almost invariably rendered by Polo\r\nas _-giu_. This has frequently in the MSS., and constantly in the\r\nprinted editions, been converted into _-gui_, and thence into _-guy_.\r\nThis is on the whole the most constant canon of Polo’s geographical\r\northography, and holds in _Caagiu_ (Ho-chau), _Singiu_ (Sining-chau),\r\n_Cui-giu_ (Kwei-chau), _Sin-giu_ (T’sining-chau), _Pi-giu_ (Pei-chau),\r\n_Coigangiu_ (Hwaingan-chau), _Si-giu_ (Si-chau), _Ti-giu_ (Tai-chau),\r\n_Tin-giu_ (Tung-chau), _Yan-giu_ (Yang-chau), _Sin-giu_ (Chin-chau),\r\n_Cai-giu_ (Kwa-chau), _Chinghi-giu_ (Chang-chau), _Su-giu_ (Su-chau),\r\n_Vu-giu_ (Wu-chau), and perhaps a few more. In one or two instances\r\nonly (as _Sinda-ciu_, _Caiciu_) he has _-ciu_ instead of _-giu_.\r\n\r\nThe chapter-headings I have generally taken from Pauthier’s Text, but\r\nthey are no essential part of the original work, and they have been\r\nslightly modified or enlarged where it seemed desirable.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n      “=Behold!

But I must repeat that\r\n    the duties of a translator, and of the Editor of an original text,\r\n    at least where the various recensions bear so peculiar a relation\r\n    to each other as in this case, are essentially different; and that,\r\n    on reconsidering the matter after an interval of four or five\r\n    years, the plan which I have adopted, whatever be the faults of\r\n    execution, still commends itself to me as the only appropriate one.\r\n\r\n    Let Mr. de Khanikoff consider what course he would adopt if he\r\n    were about to publish Marco Polo in Russian. I feel certain that\r\n    with whatever theory he might set out, before his task should be\r\n    concluded he would have arrived practically at the same system that\r\n    I have adopted.\r\n\r\n[2] In Polo’s diction C frequently represents H., _e.g._, _Cormos_ =\r\n    Hormuz; _Camadi_ probably = Hamadi; _Caagiu_ probably = Hochau;\r\n    _Cacianfu_ = Hochangfu, and so on. This is perhaps attributable to\r\n    Rusticiano’s Tuscan ear. A true Pisan will absolutely contort his\r\n    features in the intensity of his efforts to aspirate sufficiently\r\n    the letter C. Filippo Villani, speaking of the famous Aguto (Sir\r\n    J. Hawkwood), says his name in English was _Kauchouvole_. (_Murat.\r\n    Script._ xiv. 746.)\r\n\r\n[3] In the Venetian dialect _ch_ and _j_ are often sounded as in\r\n    English, not as in Italian. Some traces of such pronunciation I\r\n    think there are, as in _Coja, Carajan_, and in the Chinese name\r\n    _Vanchu_ (occurring only in Ramusio, _supra_, p. _99_). But the\r\n    scribe of the original work being a Tuscan, the spelling is in\r\n    the main Tuscan. The sound of the _Qu_ is, however, French, as in\r\n    _Quescican, Quinsai_, except perhaps in the case of _Quenianfu_,\r\n    for a reason given in vol. ii. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[4] For example, that enthusiastic student of mediæval Geography,\r\n    Joachim Lelewel, speaks of Polo’s “gibberish” (_le baragouinage du\r\n    Venitien_) with special reference to such names as _Zayton_ and\r\n    _Kinsay_, whilst we now know that these names were in universal\r\n    use by all foreigners in China, and no more deserve to be called\r\n    gibberish than _Bocca-Tigris_, _Leghorn_, _Ratisbon_, or _Buda_.\r\n\r\n[5] I am quite sensible of the diffidence with which any outsider\r\n    should touch any question of Chinese language or orthography. A\r\n    Chinese scholar and missionary (Mr. Moule) objects to my spelling\r\n    _chau_, whilst he, I see, uses _chow_. I imagine we mean the same\r\n    sound, according to the spelling which I try to use throughout the\r\n    book. Dr. C. Douglas, another missionary scholar, writes _chau_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCO POLO’S ITINERARIES, Nᵒ. I.

For ye shall find therein all kinds of wonderful things, and\r\nthe divers histories of the Great Hermenia, and of Persia, and of the\r\nLand of the Tartars, and of India, and of many another country of which\r\nour Book doth speak, particularly and in regular succession, according\r\nto the description of Messer Marco Polo, a wise and noble citizen of\r\nVenice, as he saw them with his own eyes. Some things indeed there be\r\ntherein which he beheld not; but these he heard from men of credit and\r\nveracity. And we shall set down things seen as seen, and things heard\r\nas heard only, so that no jot of falsehood may mar the truth of our\r\nBook, and that all who shall read it or hear it read may put full faith\r\nin the truth of all its contents.\r\n\r\nFor let me tell you that since our Lord God did mould with his hands\r\nour first Father Adam, even until this day, never hath there been\r\nChristian, or Pagan, or Tartar, or Indian, or any man of any nation,\r\nwho in his own person hath had so much knowledge and experience of\r\nthe divers parts of the World and its Wonders as hath had this Messer\r\nMarco! And for that reason he bethought himself that it would be a\r\nvery great pity did he not cause to be put in writing all the great\r\nmarvels that he had seen, or on sure information heard of, so that\r\nother people who had not these advantages might, by his Book, get such\r\nknowledge. And I may tell you that in acquiring this knowledge he spent\r\nin those various parts of the World good six-and-twenty years. Now,\r\nbeing thereafter an inmate of the Prison at Genoa, he caused Messer\r\nRusticiano of Pisa, who was in the said Prison likewise, to reduce the\r\nwhole to writing; and this befell in the year 1298 from the birth of\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE TWO BROTHERS POLO SET FORTH FROM CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n                        TO TRAVERSE THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came to pass in the year of Christ 1260, when Baldwin was reigning\r\nat Constantinople,{1} that Messer Nicolas Polo, the father of my lord\r\nMark, and Messer Maffeo Polo, the brother of Messer Nicolas, were at\r\nthe said city of CONSTANTINOPLE, whither they had gone from Venice with\r\ntheir merchants’ wares. Now these two Brethren, men singularly noble,\r\nwise, and provident, took counsel together to cross the GREATER SEA on\r\na venture of trade; so they laid in a store of jewels and set forth\r\nfrom Constantinople, crossing the Sea to SOLDAIA.{2}\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Baldwin II. (de Courtenay), the last Latin Emperor of\r\n  Constantinople, reigned from 1237 to 1261, when he was expelled by\r\n  Michael Palaeologus.\r\n\r\n  The date in the text is, as we see, that of the Brothers’ voyage\r\n  across the Black Sea. It stands 1250 in all the chief texts.\r\n  But the figure is certainly wrong. We shall see that, when the\r\n  Brothers return to Venice in 1269, they find Mark, who, according\r\n  to Ramusio’s version, was _born after their departure_, a lad of\r\n  fifteen. Hence, if we rely on Ramusio, they must have left Venice\r\n  about 1253–54. And we shall see also that they reached the Volga\r\n  in 1261. Hence their start from Constantinople may well have\r\n  occurred in 1260, and this I have adopted as the most probable\r\n  correction. Where they spent the interval between 1254 (if they\r\n  really left Venice so early) and 1260, nowhere appears. But as\r\n  their brother, Mark the Elder, in his Will styles himself “_whilom\r\n  of Constantinople_,” their headquarters were probably there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle of Soldaia or Sudak.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—In the Middle Ages the Euxine was frequently called _Mare\r\n  Magnum_ or _Majus_. Thus Chaucer:—\r\n\r\n                      “In the GRETE SEE,\r\n      At many a noble Armee hadde he be.”\r\n\r\n  The term Black Sea (_Mare Maurum_ v. _Nigrum_) was, however, in\r\n  use, and Abulfeda says it was general in his day. That name has\r\n  been alleged to appear as early as the 10th century, in the form\r\n  Σκοτεινή, “The Dark Sea”; but an examination of the passage cited,\r\n  from Constantine Porphyrogenitus, shows that it refers rather to\r\n  the Baltic, whilst that author elsewhere calls the Euxine simply\r\n  Pontus. (_Reinaud’s Abulf._ I. 38, _Const. Porph. De Adm. Imp._ c.\r\n  31, c. 42.)\r\n\r\n  ✛ _Sodaya, Soldaia_, or _Soldachia_, called by Orientals _Súdák_,\r\n  stands on the S.E. coast of the Crimea, west of Kaffa. It had\r\n  belonged to the Greek Empire, and had a considerable Greek\r\n  population. After the Frank conquest of 1204 it apparently fell to\r\n  Trebizond. It was taken by the Mongols in 1223 for the first time,\r\n  and a second time in 1239, and during that century was the great\r\n  port of intercourse with what is now Russia. At an uncertain date,\r\n  but about the middle of the century, the Venetians established a\r\n  factory there, which in 1287 became the seat of a consul. In 1323\r\n  we find Pope John XXII. complaining to Uzbek Khan of Sarai that\r\n  the Christians had been ejected from Soldaia and their churches\r\n  turned into mosques. Ibn Batuta, who alludes to this strife, counts\r\n  Sudak as one of the four great ports of the World. The Genoese got\r\n  Soldaia in 1365 and built strong defences, still to be seen. Kaffa,\r\n  with a good anchorage, in the 14th century, and later on Tana, took\r\n  the place of Soldaia as chief emporium in South Russia. Some of the\r\n  Arab Geographers call the Sea of Azov the Sea of Sudak.\r\n\r\n  The Elder Marco Polo in his Will (1280) bequeaths to the Franciscan\r\n  Friars of the place a house of his in _Soldachia_, reserving life\r\n  occupation to his own son and daughter, then residing in it.\r\n  Probably this establishment already existed when the two Brothers\r\n  went thither. (_Elie de Laprimaudaie_, passim; _Gold.

So they set forth from\r\nSoldaia and travelled till they came to the Court of a certain Tartar\r\nPrince, BARCA KAAN by name, whose residences were at SARA{1} and at\r\nBOLGARA [and who was esteemed one of the most liberal and courteous\r\nPrinces that ever was among the Tartars.]{2} This Barca was delighted\r\nat the arrival of the Two Brothers, and treated them with great honour;\r\nso they presented to him the whole of the jewels that they had brought\r\nwith them. The Prince was highly pleased with these, and accepted the\r\noffering most graciously, causing the Brothers to receive at least\r\ntwice its value.\r\n\r\nAfter they had spent a twelvemonth at the court of this Prince there\r\nbroke out a great war between Barca and Aláu, the Lord of the Tartars\r\nof the Levant, and great hosts were mustered on either side.{3}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map to illustrate the Geographical Position of the CITY\r\n  of SARAI\r\n\r\n  Part of the Remains of the CITY of SARAI near TZAREV North of the\r\n  AKHTUBA Branch of the VOLGA\r\n\r\n  Lit. Frauenfelder, Palermo]\r\n\r\nBut in the end Barca, the Lord of the Tartars of the Ponent, was\r\ndefeated, though on both sides there was great slaughter. And by reason\r\nof this war no one could travel without peril of being taken; thus it\r\nwas at least on the road by which the Brothers had come, though there\r\nwas no obstacle to their travelling forward. So the Brothers, finding\r\nthey could not retrace their steps, determined to go forward. Quitting\r\nBolgara, therefore, they proceeded to a city called UCACA, which was at\r\nthe extremity of the kingdom of the Lord of the Ponent;{4} and thence\r\ndeparting again, and passing the great River Tigris, they travelled\r\nacross a Desert which extended for seventeen days’ journey, and wherein\r\nthey found neither town nor village, falling in only with the tents of\r\nTartars occupied with their cattle at pasture.{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—✛ Barka Khan, third son of Jújí, the first-born of\r\n  Chinghiz, ruled the _Ulús_ of Juji and Empire of Kipchak (Southern\r\n  Russia) from 1257 to 1265. He was the first Musulman sovereign of\r\n  his race. His chief residence was at SARAI (Sara of the text), a\r\n  city founded by his brother and predecessor Bátú, on the banks of\r\n  the Akhtuba branch of the Volga. In the next century Ibn Batuta\r\n  describes Sarai as a very handsome and populous city, so large that\r\n  it made half a day’s journey to ride through it. The inhabitants\r\n  were Mongols, Aás (or Alans), Kipchaks, Circassians, Russians, and\r\n  Greeks, besides the foreign Moslem merchants, who had a walled\r\n  quarter. Another Mahomedan traveller of the same century says the\r\n  city itself was not walled, but, “The Khan’s Palace was a great\r\n  edifice surmounted by a golden crescent weighing two _kantars_ of\r\n  Egypt, and encompassed by a wall flanked with towers,” etc. Pope\r\n  John XXII., on the 26th February 1322, defined the limits of the\r\n  new Bishopric of Kaffa, which were Sarai to the east and Varna to\r\n  the west.\r\n\r\n  Sarai became the seat of both a Latin and a Russian metropolitan,\r\n  and of more than one Franciscan convent. It was destroyed by Timur\r\n  on his second invasion of Kipchak (1395–6), and extinguished by the\r\n  Russians a century later. It is the scene of Chaucer’s half-told\r\n  tale of Cambuscan:—\r\n\r\n      “At _Sarra_, in the Londe of Tartarie,\r\n       There dwelt a King that werriëd Russie.”\r\n\r\n  [“_Mesalek-al-absar_ (285, 287), says Sarai, meaning ‘the Palace,’\r\n  was founded by Bereké, brother of Batu. It stood in a salty plain,\r\n  and was without walls, though the palace had walls flanked by\r\n  towers. The town was large, had markets, _madrasas_—and baths. It\r\n  is usually identified with Selitrennoyé Gorodok, about 70 miles\r\n  above Astrakhan.” (_Rockhill, Rubruck_, p. 260, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Several sites exhibiting extensive ruins near the banks of the\r\n  Akhtuba have been identified with Sarai; two in particular.\r\n  One of these is not far from the great elbow of the Volga at\r\n  Tzaritzyn: the other much lower down, at Selitrennoyé Gorodok or\r\n  Saltpetre-Town, not far above Astrakhan.\r\n\r\n  The upper site exhibits by far the most extensive traces of\r\n  former population, and is declared unhesitatingly to be the sole\r\n  site of Sarai by M. Gregorieff, who carried on excavations among\r\n  the remains for four years, though with what precise results I\r\n  have not been able to learn. The most dense part of the remains,\r\n  consisting of mounds and earth-works, traces of walls, buildings,\r\n  cisterns, dams, and innumerable canals, extends for about 7½ miles\r\n  in the vicinity of the town of Tzarev, but a tract of 66 miles in\r\n  length and 300 miles in circuit, commencing from near the head\r\n  of the Akhtuba, presents remains of like character, though of\r\n  less density, marking the ground occupied by the villages which\r\n  encircled the capital. About 2½ miles to the N.W. of Tzarev a vast\r\n  mass of such remains, surrounded by the traces of a brick rampart,\r\n  points out the presumable position of the Imperial Palace.\r\n\r\n  M. Gregorieff appears to admit no alternative. Yet it seems certain\r\n  that the indications of Abulfeda, Pegolotti, and others, with\r\n  regard to the position of the capital in the early part of the 14th\r\n  century, are not consistent with a site so far from the Caspian.\r\n  Moreover, F. H. Müller states that the site near Tzarev is known\r\n  to the Tartars as the “Sarai of Janibek Khan” (1341–1357). Now it\r\n  is worthy of note that in the coinage of Janibek we repeatedly\r\n  find as the place of mintage, _New Sarai_. Arabsháh in his History\r\n  of Timur states that 63 years had elapsed from the foundation to\r\n  the destruction of Sarai. But it must have been at least 140 years\r\n  since the foundation of Batu’s city. Is it not possible, therefore,\r\n  that both the sites which we have mentioned were successively\r\n  occupied by the Mongol capital; that the original Sarai of Batu was\r\n  at Selitrennoyé Gorodok, and that the _New Sarai_ of Janibek was\r\n  established by him, or by his father Uzbeg in his latter days, on\r\n  the upper Akhtuba? Pegolotti having carried his merchant from Tana\r\n  (Azov) to Gittarchan (Astrakhan), takes him _one day_ by river to\r\n  Sara, and from Sara to _Saracanco_, also by river, eight days more.\r\n  (_Cathay_, p. 287.) In the work quoted I have taken Saracanco for\r\n  Saraichik, on the Yaik. But it was possibly the Upper or New Sarai\r\n  on the Akhtuba. Ibn Batuta, marching on the frozen river, reached\r\n  Sarai in three days from Astrakhan. This could not have been at\r\n  Tzarev, 200 miles off.\r\n\r\n  In corroboration (_quantum valeat_) of my suggestion that there\r\n  must have been two Sarais near the Volga, Professor Bruun of Odessa\r\n  points to the fact that Fra Mauro’s map presents _two_ cities of\r\n  Sarai on the Akhtuba; only the Sarai of Janibeg is with him no\r\n  longer _New_ Sarai, but _Great_ Sarai.\r\n\r\n  The use of the latter name suggests the possibility that in the\r\n  _Saracanco_ of Pegolotti the latter half of the name may be the\r\n  Mongol _Kúnḳ_ “Great.” (See _Pavet de Courteille_, p. 439.)\r\n\r\n  Professor Bruun also draws attention to the impossibility of Ibn\r\n  Batuta’s travelling from Astrakhan to Tzarev in three days, an\r\n  argument which had already occurred to me and been inserted above.\r\n\r\n  [The Empire of Kipchak founded after the Mongol Conquest of 1224,\r\n  included also parts of Siberia and Khwarizm; it survived nominally\r\n  until 1502.—H.

The old Arab\r\n  writers regarded it as nearly the limit of the habitable world, and\r\n  told wonders of the cold, the brief summer nights, and the fossil\r\n  ivory that was found in its vicinity. This was exported, and with\r\n  peltry, wax, honey, hazel-nuts, and Russia leather, formed the\r\n  staple articles of trade. The last item derived from Bolghar the\r\n  name which it still bears all over Asia. (See Bk. II. ch. xvi.,\r\n  and Note.) Bolghar seems to have been the northern limit of Arab\r\n  travel, and was visited by the curious (by Ibn Batuta among others)\r\n  in order to witness the phenomena of the short summer night, as\r\n  tourists now visit Hammerfest to witness its entire absence.\r\n\r\n  Russian chroniclers speak of an earlier capital of the Bulgarian\r\n  kingdom, Brakhimof, near the mouth of the Kama, destroyed by\r\n  Andrew, Grand Duke of Rostof and Susdal, about 1160; and this may\r\n  have been the city referred to in the earlier Arabic accounts. The\r\n  fullest of these is by Ibn Fozlán, who accompanied an embassy from\r\n  the Court of Baghdad to Bolghar, in A.D. 921. The King and people\r\n  had about this time been converted to Islam, having previously, as\r\n  it would seem, professed Christianity. Nevertheless, a Mahomedan\r\n  writer of the 14th century says the people had then long renounced\r\n  Islam for the worship of the Cross. (_Not. et Extr._ XIII. i. 270.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Ruins of Bolghar.]\r\n\r\n  Bolghar was first captured by the Mongols in 1225. It seems to have\r\n  perished early in the 15th century, after which Kazan practically\r\n  took its place. Its position is still marked by a village called\r\n  Bolgari, where ruins of Mahomedan character remain, and where coins\r\n  and inscriptions have been found. Coins of the Kings of Bolghar,\r\n  struck in the 10th century, have been described by Fraehn, as\r\n  well as coins of the Mongol period struck at Bolghar. Its latest\r\n  known coin is of A.H. 818 (A.D. 1415–16). A history of Bolghar was\r\n  written in the first half of the 12th century by Yakub Ibn Noman,\r\n  Kadhi of the city, but this is not known to be extant.\r\n\r\n  Fraehn shows ground for believing the people to have been a mixture\r\n  of Fins, Slavs, and Turks. Nicephorus Gregoras supposes that they\r\n  took their name from the great river on which they dwelt (Βούλγα).\r\n\r\n  [“The ruins [of Bolghar],” says Bretschneider, in his _Mediæval\r\n  Researches_, published in 1888, vol. ii. p. 82, “still exist, and\r\n  have been the subject of learned investigation by several Russian\r\n  scholars. These remains are found on the spot where now the village\r\n  _Uspenskoye_, called also _Bolgarskoye_ (Bolgari), stands, in the\r\n  district of Spask, province of Kazan. This village is about 4\r\n  English miles distant from the Volga, east of it, and 83 miles from\r\n  Kazan.” Part of the Bulgars removed to the Balkans; others remained\r\n  in their native country on the shores of the Azov Sea, and were\r\n  subjugated by the Khazars. At the beginning of the 9th century,\r\n  they marched northwards to the Volga and the Kama, and established\r\n  the kingdom of Great Bulgaria. Their chief city, Bolghar, was on\r\n  the bank of the Volga, but the river runs now to the west; as the\r\n  Kama also underwent a change in its course, it is possible that\r\n  formerly Bolghar was built at the junction of the two rivers.\r\n  (Cf. _Reclus, Europe russe_, p. 761.) The Bulgars were converted\r\n  to Islam in 922. Their country was first invaded by the Mongols\r\n  under Subutai in 1223; this General conquered it in 1236, the\r\n  capital was destroyed the following year, and the country annexed\r\n  to the kingdom of Kipchak. Bolghar was again destroyed in 1391 by\r\n  Tamerlan. In 1438, Ulugh Mohammed, cousin of Toka Timur, younger\r\n  son of Juji, transformed this country into the khanate of Kazan,\r\n  which survived till 1552. It had probably been the capital of the\r\n  Golden Horde before Sarai.\r\n\r\n  With reference to the early Christianity of the Bulgarians, to\r\n  which Yule refers in his note, the _Laurentian Chronicle_ (A.D.\r\n  1229), quoted by Shpilevsky, adduces evidence to show that in the\r\n  Great City, _i.e._ _Bulgar_, there were Russian Christians and a\r\n  Christian cemetery, and the death of a Bulgarian Christian martyr\r\n  is related in the same chronicle as well as in the Nikon, Tver, and\r\n  Tatischef annals in which his name is given. (Cf. Shpilevsky, _Anc.\r\n  towns and other Bulgaro-Tartar monuments_, Kazan, 1877, p. 158\r\n  seq.; _Rockhill’s Rubruck_, Hakl. Soc. p. 121, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The severe and lasting winter is spoken of by Ibn Fozlán and other\r\n  old writers in terms that seem to point to a modern mitigation\r\n  of climate. It is remarkable, too, that Ibn Fozlán speaks of the\r\n  aurora as of very frequent occurrence, which is not now the case\r\n  in that latitude. We may suspect this frequency to have been\r\n  connected with the greater cold indicated, and perhaps with a\r\n  different position of the magnetic pole. Ibn Fozlán’s account of\r\n  the aurora is very striking:—“Shortly before sunset the horizon\r\n  became all very ruddy, and at the same time I heard sounds in the\r\n  upper air, with a dull rustling. I looked up and beheld sweeping\r\n  over me a fire-red cloud, from which these sounds issued, and in\r\n  it movements, as it were, of men and horses; the men grasping\r\n  bows, lances, and swords. This I saw, or thought I saw. Then there\r\n  appeared a white cloud of like aspect; in it also I beheld armed\r\n  horsemen, and these rushed against the former as one squadron of\r\n  horse charges another. We were so terrified at this that we turned\r\n  with humble prayer to the Almighty, whereupon the natives about us\r\n  wondered and broke into loud laughter. We, however, continued to\r\n  gaze, seeing how one cloud charged the other, remained confused\r\n  with it a while, and then sundered again. These movements lasted\r\n  deep into the night, and then all vanished.”\r\n\r\n  (_Fraehn, Ueber die Wolga Bulgaren_, Petersb. 1832; _Gold.\r\n  Horde_, 8, 9, 423–424; _Not. et Extr._ II. 541; _Ibn Bat._ II.\r\n  398; _Büschings Mag._ V. 492; _Erdmann, Numi Asiat._ I. 315–318,\r\n  333–334, 520–535; _Niceph.

In the Mongol pronunciation guttural\r\n  and palatal consonants are apt to be elided, hence this spelling.\r\n  The same name is written by Pope Alexander IV., in addressing the\r\n  Khan, _Olao_, by Pachymeres and Gregoras Χαλαὺ and Χαλαοῦ, by\r\n  Hayton _Haolon_, by Ibn Batuta _Huláún_, as well as in a letter of\r\n  Hulaku’s own, as given by Makrizi.\r\n\r\n  The war in question is related in Rashíduddín’s history, and by\r\n  Polo himself towards the end of the work. It began in the summer of\r\n  1262, and ended about eight months later. Hence the Polos must have\r\n  reached Barka’s Court in 1261.\r\n\r\n  Marco always applies to the Mongol Khans of Persia the title of\r\n  “Lords of the East” (_Levant_), and to the Khans of Kipchak that of\r\n  “Lords of the West” (_Ponent_). We use the term _Levant_ still with\r\n  a similar specific application, and in another form _Anatolia_. I\r\n  think it best to preserve the terms _Levant_ and _Ponent_ when used\r\n  in this way.\r\n\r\n  [Robert Parke in his translation out of Spanish of Mendoza,\r\n  _The Historie of the great and mightie kingdome of China_ ...\r\n  London, printed by I. Wolfe for Edward White, 1588, uses the word\r\n  _Ponent_: “You shall understande that this mightie kingdome is the\r\n  Orientalest part of all Asia, and his next neighbour towards the\r\n  _Ponent_ is the kingdome of _Quachinchina_ ... (p. 2).”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—UCACA or UKEK was a town on the right bank of the Volga,\r\n  nearly equidistant between Sarai and Bolghar, and about six miles\r\n  south of the modern Saratov, where a village called _Uwek_ still\r\n  exists. Ukek is not mentioned before the Mongol domination, and is\r\n  supposed to have been of Mongol foundation, as the name Ukek is\r\n  said in Mongol to signify a dam of hurdles. The city is mentioned\r\n  by Abulfeda as marking the extremity of “the empire of the Barka\r\n  Tartars,” and Ibn Batuta speaks of it as “one day distant from\r\n  the hills of the Russians.” Polo therefore means that it was the\r\n  frontier of the Ponent towards Russia. Ukek was the site of a\r\n  Franciscan convent in the 14th century; it is mentioned several\r\n  times in the campaigns of Timur, and was destroyed by his army.\r\n  It is not mentioned under the form Ukek after this, but appears\r\n  as _Uwek_ and _Uwesh_ in Russian documents of the 16th century.\r\n  Perhaps this was always the Slavonic form, for it already is\r\n  written _Uguech_ (= Uwek) in Wadding’s 14th century catalogue of\r\n  convents. Anthony Jenkinson, in Hakluyt, gives an observation of\r\n  its latitude, as _Oweke_ (51° 40′), and Christopher Burrough, in\r\n  the same collection, gives a description of it as _Oueak_, and the\r\n  latitude as 51° 30′ (some 7′ too much). In his time (1579) there\r\n  were the remains of a “very faire stone castle” and city, with old\r\n  tombs exhibiting sculptures and inscriptions. All these have long\r\n  vanished. Burrough was told by the Russians that the town “was\r\n  swallowed into the earth by the justice of God, for the wickednesse\r\n  of the people that inhabited the same.” Lepechin in 1769 found\r\n  nothing remaining but part of an earthen rampart and some\r\n  underground vaults of larger bricks, which the people dug out for\r\n  use. He speaks of coins and other relics as frequent, and the like\r\n  have been found more recently. Coins with Mongol-Arab inscriptions,\r\n  struck at Ukek by Tuktugai Khan in 1306, have been described by\r\n  Fraehn and Erdmann.\r\n\r\n  (_Fraehn, Ueber die ehemalige Mong.

It receives the same name from the Monk Pascal of\r\n  Vittoria in 1338. (_Cathay_, p. 234.) Perhaps this arose out of\r\n  some legend that the Tigris was a reappearance of the same river.\r\n  The ecclesiastical historian, Nicephorus Callistus, appears to\r\n  imply that the Tigris coming from Paradise flows under the Caspian\r\n  to emerge in Kurdistan. (See IX. 19.)\r\n\r\n  The “17 days” applies to one stretch of desert. The whole journey\r\n  from Ukek Bokhara would take some 60 days at least. Ibn Batuta is\r\n  58 days from Sarai to Bokhara, and of the last section he says, “we\r\n  entered the desert which extends between Khwarizm and Bokhara, and\r\n  _which has an extent of 18 days’ journey_.” (III. 19.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n      HOW THE TWO BROTHERS, AFTER CROSSING A DESERT, CAME TO THE\r\n        CITY OF BOCARA, AND FELL IN WITH CERTAIN ENVOYS THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter they had passed the desert, they arrived at a very great and\r\nnoble city called BOCARA, the territory of which belonged to a king\r\nwhose name was Barac, and is also called Bocara. The city is the best\r\nin all Persia.{1} And when they had got thither, they found they could\r\nneither proceed further forward nor yet turn back again; wherefore they\r\nabode in that city of Bocara for three years. And whilst they were\r\nsojourning in that city, there came from Alau, Lord of the Levant,\r\nEnvoys on their way to the Court of the Great Kaan, the Lord of all the\r\nTartars in the world. And when the Envoys beheld the Two Brothers they\r\nwere amazed, for they had never before seen Latins in that part of the\r\nworld. And they said to the Brothers: “Gentlemen, if ye will take our\r\ncounsel, ye will find great honour and profit shall come thereof.” So\r\nthey replied that they would be right glad to learn how. “In truth,”\r\nsaid the Envoys, “the Great Kaan hath never seen any Latins, and he\r\nhath a great desire so to do. Wherefore, if ye will keep us company\r\nto his Court, ye may depend upon it that he will be right glad to see\r\nyou, and will treat you with great honour and liberality; whilst in\r\nour company ye shall travel with perfect security, and need fear to be\r\nmolested by nobody.”{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Hayton also calls Bokhara a city of Persia, and I see\r\n  Vámbéry says that, up till the conquest by Chinghiz, Bokhara,\r\n  Samarkand, Balkh, etc., were considered to belong to Persia.\r\n  (_Travels_, p. 377.) The first Mongolian governor of Bokhara was\r\n  Buka Bosha.\r\n\r\n  King Barac is Borrak Khan, great-grandson of Chagatai, and\r\n  sovereign of the Ulús of Chagatai, from 1264 to 1270. The Polos,\r\n  no doubt, reached Bokhara before 1264, but Borrak must have been\r\n  sovereign some time before they left it.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The language of the envoys seems rather to imply that\r\n  they were the Great Kaan’s own people returning from the Court of\r\n  Hulaku. And Rashid mentions that Sartak, the Kaan’s ambassador to\r\n  Hulaku, returned from Persia in the year that the latter prince\r\n  died. It may have been his party that the Venetians joined, for the\r\n  year almost certainly was the same, viz. 1265. If so, another of\r\n  the party was Bayan, afterwards the greatest of Kublai’s captains,\r\n  and much celebrated in the sequel of this book. (See _Erdmann’s\r\n  Temudschin_, p. 214.)\r\n\r\n  Marsden justly notes that Marco habitually speaks of _Latins_,\r\n  never of _Franks_. Yet I suspect his own mental expression was\r\n  _Farangi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n      HOW THE TWO BROTHERS TOOK THE ENVOYS’ COUNSEL, AND WENT TO\r\n                     THE COURT OF THE GREAT KAAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when the Two Brothers had made their arrangements, they set out on\r\ntheir travels, in company with the Envoys, and journeyed for a whole\r\nyear, going northward and north-eastward, before they reached the Court\r\nof that Prince. And on their journey they saw many marvels of divers\r\nand sundry kinds, but of these we shall say nothing at present, because\r\nMesser Mark, who has likewise seen them all, will give you a full\r\naccount of them in the Book which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     HOW THE TWO BROTHERS ARRIVED AT THE COURT OF THE GREAT KAAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Two Brothers got to the Great Kaan, he received them with\r\ngreat honour and hospitality, and showed much pleasure at their visit,\r\nasking them a great number of questions. First, he asked about the\r\nemperors, how they maintained their dignity, and administered justice\r\nin their dominions; and how they went forth to battle, and so forth.\r\nAnd then he asked the like questions about the kings and princes and\r\nother potentates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n         HOW THE GREAT KAAN ASKED ALL ABOUT THE MANNERS OF THE\r\n         CHRISTIANS, AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE POPE OF ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then he inquired about the Pope and the Church, and about all\r\nthat is done at Rome, and all the customs of the Latins. And the Two\r\nBrothers told him the truth in all its particulars, with order and good\r\nsense, like sensible men as they were; and this they were able to do as\r\nthey knew the Tartar language well.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The word generally used for Pope in the original is\r\n  _Apostoille_ (_Apostolicus_), the usual French expression of that\r\n  age.\r\n\r\n  It is remarkable that for the most part the text edited by Pauthier\r\n  has the correcter Oriental form _Tatar_, instead of the usual\r\n  _Tartar_. _Tattar_ is the word used by Yvo of Narbonne, in the\r\n  curious letter given by Matthew Paris under 1243.\r\n\r\n  We are often told that _Tartar_ is a vulgar European error. It is\r\n  in any case a very old one; nor does it seem to be of European\r\n  origin, but rather Armenian;[1] though the suggestion of Tartarus\r\n  may have given it readier currency in Europe. Russian writers, or\r\n  rather writers who have been in Russia, sometimes try to force on\r\n  us a specific limitation of the word _Tartar_ to a certain class of\r\n  Oriental Turkish race, to whom the Russians appropriate the name.\r\n  But there is no just ground for this. _Tátár_ is used by Oriental\r\n  writers of Polo’s age exactly as Tartar was then, and is still,\r\n  used in Western Europe, as a generic title for the Turanian hosts\r\n  who followed Chinghiz and his successors. But I believe the name in\r\n  this sense was unknown to Western Asia before the time of Chinghiz.\r\n  And General Cunningham must overlook this when he connects the\r\n  Ṭáṭaríya coins, mentioned by Arab geographers of the 9th century,\r\n  with “the Scythic or Tátár princes who ruled in Kabul” in the\r\n  beginning of our era. Tartars on the Indian frontier in those\r\n  centuries are surely to be classed with the Frenchmen whom Brennus\r\n  led to Rome, or the Scotchmen who fought against Agricola.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] See _J.

So he urgently desired them to undertake this mission along with\r\none of his Barons; and they replied that they would gladly execute all\r\nhis commands as those of their Sovereign Lord. Then the Prince sent to\r\nsummon to his presence one of his Barons whose name was COGATAL, and\r\ndesired him to get ready, for it was proposed to send him to the Pope\r\nalong with the Two Brothers. The Baron replied that he would execute\r\nthe Lord’s commands to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Prince caused letters from himself to the Pope to be\r\nindited in the Tartar tongue,{1} and committed them to the Two Brothers\r\nand to that Baron of his own, and charged them with what he wished\r\nthem to say to the Pope. Now the contents of the letter were to this\r\npurport: He begged that the Pope would send as many as an hundred\r\npersons of our Christian faith; intelligent men, acquainted with the\r\nSeven Arts,{2} well qualified to enter into controversy, and able\r\nclearly to prove by force of argument to idolaters and other kinds of\r\nfolk, that the Law of Christ was best, and that all other religions\r\nwere false and naught; and that if they would prove this, he and all\r\nunder him would become Christians and the Church’s liegemen. Finally\r\nhe charged his Envoys to bring back to him some Oil of the Lamp which\r\nburns on the Sepulchre of our Lord at Jerusalem.{3}\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—✛ The appearance of the Great Kaan’s letter may be\r\n  illustrated by two letters on so-called Corean paper preserved\r\n  in the French archives; one from Arghún Khan of Persia (1289),\r\n  brought by Buscarel, and the other from his son Oljaitu (May,\r\n  1305), to Philip the Fair. These are both in the Mongol language,\r\n  and according to Abel Rémusat and other authorities, in the Uighúr\r\n  character, the parent of the present Mongol writing. Facsimiles of\r\n  the letters are given in Rémusat’s paper on intercourse with Mongol\r\n  Princes, in _Mém. de l’Acad. des Inscript._ vols. vii. and viii.,\r\n  reproductions in J. B. Chabot’s _Hist. de Mar Jabalaha III._,\r\n  Paris, 1895, and preferably in Prince Roland Bonaparte’s beautiful\r\n  _Documents Mongols_, Pl. XIV., and we give samples of the two in\r\n  vol. ii.[1]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“The Seven Arts,” from a date reaching back nearly to\r\n  classical times, and down through the Middle Ages, expressed the\r\n  whole circle of a liberal education, and it is to these Seven\r\n  Arts that the degrees in arts were understood to apply. They were\r\n  divided into the _Trivium_ of Rhetoric, Logic, and Grammar, and\r\n  the _Quadrivium_ of Arithmetic, Astronomy, Music, and Geometry.\r\n  The 38th epistle of Seneca was in many MSS. (according to Lipsius)\r\n  entitled “_L. Annaei Senecae Liber de Septem Artibus liberalibus._”\r\n  I do not find, however, that Seneca there mentions categorically\r\n  more than five, viz., Grammar, Geometry, Music, Astronomy, and\r\n  Arithmetic. In the 5th century we find the Seven Arts to form\r\n  the successive subjects of the last seven books of the work of\r\n  Martianus Capella, much used in the schools during the early Middle\r\n  Ages. The Seven Arts will be found enumerated in the verses of\r\n  Tzetzes (_Chil. XI._ 525), and allusions to them in the mediæval\r\n  romances are endless. Thus, in one of the “Gestes d’Alexandre,” a\r\n  chapter is headed “_Comment Aristotle aprent à Alixandre les Sept\r\n  Arts._” In the tale of the Seven Wise Masters, Diocletian selects\r\n  that number of tutors for his son, each to instruct him in one of\r\n  the Seven Arts. In the romance of _Erec and Eneide_ we have a dress\r\n  on which the fairies had portrayed the Seven Arts (_Franc. Michel,\r\n  Recherches_, etc. II. 82); in the _Roman de Mahommet_ the young\r\n  impostor is master of all the seven. There is one mediæval poem\r\n  called the _Marriage of the Seven Arts_, and another called the\r\n  _Battle of the Seven Arts_. (See also Dante, _Convito_, Trat. II.\r\n  c. 14; _Not. et Ex._ V., 491 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The Chinghizide Princes were eminently liberal—or\r\n  indifferent—in religion; and even after they became Mahomedan,\r\n  which, however, the Eastern branch never did, they were rarely and\r\n  only by brief fits persecutors. Hence there was scarcely one of the\r\n  non-Mahomedan Khans of whose conversion to Christianity there were\r\n  not stories spread. The first rumours of Chinghiz in the West were\r\n  as of a Christian conqueror; tales may be found of the Christianity\r\n  of Chagatai, Hulaku, Abaka, Arghun, Baidu, Ghazan, Sartak, Kuyuk,\r\n  Mangu, Kublai, and one or two of the latter’s successors in China,\r\n  all probably false, with one or two doubtful exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] See plates with ch. xvii. of Bk.

From a miniature of the 14th century.]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n      HOW THE GREAT KAAN GAVE THEM A TABLET OF GOLD, BEARING HIS\r\n                        ORDERS IN THEIR BEHALF.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince had charged them with all his commission, he caused to\r\nbe given them a Tablet of Gold, on which was inscribed that the three\r\nAmbassadors should be supplied with everything needful in all the\r\ncountries through which they should pass—with horses, with escorts,\r\nand, in short, with whatever they should require. And when they had\r\nmade all needful preparations, the three Ambassadors took their leave\r\nof the Emperor and set out.\r\n\r\nWhen they had travelled I know not how many days, the Tartar Baron\r\nfell sick, so that he could not ride, and being very ill, and unable\r\nto proceed further, he halted at a certain city. So the Two Brothers\r\njudged it best that they should leave him behind and proceed to carry\r\nout their commission; and, as he was well content that they should\r\ndo so, they continued their journey. And I can assure you, that\r\nwhithersoever they went they were honourably provided with whatever\r\nthey stood in need of, or chose to command. And this was owing to that\r\nTablet of Authority from the Lord which they carried with them.{1}\r\n\r\nSo they travelled on and on until they arrived at Layas in Hermenia,\r\na journey which occupied them, I assure you, for three years.{2} It\r\ntook them so long because they could not always proceed, being stopped\r\nsometimes by snow, or by heavy rains falling, or by great torrents\r\nwhich they found in an impassable state.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—On these Tablets, see a note under Bk. II. ch. vii.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—AYAS, called also Ayacio, Aiazzo, Giazza, Glaza, La Jazza,\r\n  and _Layas_, occupied the site of ancient Aegae, and was the chief\r\n  port of Cilician Armenia, on the Gulf of Scanderoon. _Aegae_ had\r\n  been in the 5th century a place of trade with the West, and the\r\n  seat of a bishopric, as we learn from the romantic but incomplete\r\n  story of Mary, the noble slave-girl, told by Gibbon (ch. 33). As\r\n  Ayas it became in the latter part of the 13th century one of the\r\n  chief places for the shipment of Asiatic wares arriving through\r\n  Tabriz, and was much frequented by the vessels of the Italian\r\n  Republics. The Venetians had a _Bailo_ resident there.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Castle of Ayas.]\r\n\r\n  Ayas is the _Leyes_ of Chaucer’s Knight,—\r\n\r\n      (“At LEYES was he and at Satalie”)—\r\n\r\n  and the Layas of Froissart. (Bk. III. ch. xxii.) The Gulf of Layas\r\n  is described in the xix. Canto of Ariosto, where Mafisa and Astolfo\r\n  find on its shores a country of barbarous Amazons:—\r\n\r\n      “Fatto è ’l porto a sembranza d’una luna,” etc.\r\n\r\n  Marino Sanuto says of it: “Laiacio has a haven, and a shoal in\r\n  front of it that we might rather call a reef, and to this shoal\r\n  the hawsers of vessels are moored whilst the anchors are laid out\r\n  towards the land.” (II. IV. ch. xxvi.)\r\n\r\n  The present Ayas is a wretched village of some 15 huts, occupied\r\n  by about 600 Turkmans, and standing inside the ruined walls of the\r\n  castle. This castle, which is still in good condition, was built\r\n  by the Armenian kings, and restored by Sultan Suleiman; it was\r\n  constructed from the remains of the ancient city; fragments of\r\n  old columns are embedded in its walls of cut stone. It formerly\r\n  communicated by a causeway with an advanced work on an island\r\n  before the harbour. The ruins of the city occupy a large space.\r\n  (_Langlois, V. en Cilicie_, pp. 429–31; see also _Beaufort’s\r\n  Karamania_, near the end.) A plan of Ayas will be found at the\r\n  beginning of Bk. I.—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n            HOW THE TWO BROTHERS CAME TO THE CITY OF ACRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey departed from Layas and came to ACRE, arriving there in the month\r\nof April, in the year of Christ 1269, and then they learned that the\r\nPope was dead. And when they found that the Pope was dead (his name was\r\nPope * *),{1} they went to a certain wise Churchman who was Legate\r\nfor the whole kingdom of Egypt, and a man of great authority, by name\r\nTHEOBALD OF PIACENZA, and told him of the mission on which they were\r\ncome. When the Legate heard their story, he was greatly surprised, and\r\ndeemed the thing to be of great honour and advantage for the whole of\r\nChristendom. So his answer to the two Ambassador Brothers was this:\r\n“Gentlemen, ye see that the Pope is dead; wherefore ye must needs\r\nhave patience until a new Pope be made, and then shall ye be able to\r\nexecute your charge.” Seeing well enough that what the Legate said was\r\njust, they observed: “But while the Pope is a-making, we may as well\r\ngo to Venice and visit our households.” So they departed from Acre and\r\nwent to Negropont, and from Negropont they continued their voyage to\r\nVenice.{2} On their arrival there, Messer Nicolas found that his wife\r\nwas dead, and that she had left behind her a son of fifteen years of\r\nage, whose name was MARCO; and ’tis of him that this Book tells.{3} The\r\nTwo Brothers abode at Venice a couple of years, tarrying until a Pope\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACRE _AS IT WAS WHEN LOST_ (A.D. 1291). _FROM THE PLAN\r\n  GIVEN BY_ MARINO SANUTO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The deceased Pope’s name is omitted both in the Geog. Text\r\n  and in Pauthier’s, clearly because neither Rusticiano nor Polo\r\n  remembered it. It is supplied correctly in the Crusca Italian as\r\n  _Clement_, and in Ramusio as _Clement IV._\r\n\r\n  It is not clear that _Theobald_, though generally adopted, is the\r\n  ecclesiastic’s proper name. It appears in different MSS. as _Teald_\r\n  (G. T.), _Ceabo_ for _Teabo_ (Pauthier), _Odoaldo_ (Crusca), and\r\n  in the Riccardian as _Thebaldus de Vice-comitibus de Placentia_,\r\n  which corresponds to Ramusio’s version. Most of the ecclesiastical\r\n  chroniclers call him _Tedaldus_, some _Thealdus_. _Tedaldo_ is a\r\n  real name, occurring in Boccaccio. (Day iii. Novel 7.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—After the expulsion of the Venetians from Constantinople,\r\n  Negropont was the centre of their influence in Romania. On the\r\n  final return of the travellers they again take Negropont on\r\n  their way. [It was one of the ports on the route from Venice to\r\n  Constantinople, Tana, Trebizond.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The _edition_ of the Soc. de Géographie makes Mark’s age\r\n  _twelve_, but I have verified from inspection the fact noticed by\r\n  Pauthier that the _manuscript_ has distinctly xv. like all the\r\n  other old texts. In Ramusio it is _nineteen_, but this is doubtless\r\n  an arbitrary correction to suit the mistaken date (1250) assigned\r\n  for the departure of the father from Constantinople.\r\n\r\n  There is nothing in the old French texts to justify the usual\r\n  statement that Marco was born after the departure of his father\r\n  from Venice. All that the G. T. says is: “Meser Nicolau treuve\r\n  que sa fame estoit morte, et les remès un filz de xv. anz que\r\n  avoit à nom Marc,” and Pauthier’s text is to the same effect.\r\n  Ramusio, indeed, has: “M. Nicolò trovò, che sua moglie era morta,\r\n  la quale nella sua partita haveva partorito un figliuolo,” and the\r\n  other versions that are based on Pipino’s seem all to have like\r\n  statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  HOW THE TWO BROTHERS AGAIN DEPARTED FROM VENICE, ON THEIR WAY BACK TO\r\n    THE GREAT KAAN, AND TOOK WITH THEM MARK, THE SON OF MESSER NICOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Two Brothers had tarried as long as I have told you, and saw\r\nthat never a Pope was made, they said that their return to the Great\r\nKaan must be put off no longer. So they set out from Venice, taking\r\nMark along with them, and went straight back to Acre, where they found\r\nthe Legate of whom we have spoken. They had a good deal of discourse\r\nwith him concerning the matter, and asked his permission to go to\r\nJERUSALEM to get some Oil from the Lamp on the Sepulchre, to carry with\r\nthem to the Great Kaan, as he had enjoined.{1} The Legate giving them\r\nleave, they went from Acre to Jerusalem and got some of the Oil, and\r\nthen returned to Acre, and went to the Legate and said to him: “As we\r\nsee no sign of a Pope’s being made, we desire to return to the Great\r\nKaan; for we have already tarried long, and there has been more than\r\nenough delay.” To which the Legate replied: “Since ’tis your wish to go\r\nback, I am well content.” Wherefore he caused letters to be written for\r\ndelivery to the Great Kaan, bearing testimony that the Two Brothers had\r\ncome in all good faith to accomplish his charge, but that as there was\r\nno Pope they had been unable to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—In a Pilgrimage of date apparently earlier than this, the\r\n  Pilgrim says of the Sepulchre: “The Lamp which had been placed by\r\n  His head (when He lay there) still burns on the same spot day and\r\n  night. _We took a blessing from it_ (_i.e._ apparently took some of\r\n  the oil as a beneficent memorial), and replaced it.” (_Itinerarium\r\n  Antonini Placentini_ in _Bollandists_, May, vol. ii. p. xx.)\r\n\r\n  [“Five great oil lamps,” says Daniel, the Russian Hégoumène,\r\n  1106–1107 (_Itinéraires russes en Orient_, trad. pour la Soc. de\r\n  l’Orient Latin, par Mme. B. de Khitrowo, Geneva, 1889, p. 13),\r\n  “burning continually night and day, are hung in the Sepulchre of\r\n  Our Lord.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE TWO BROTHERS SET OUT FROM ACRE, AND MARK ALONG\r\n                              WITH THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Two Brothers had received the Legate’s letters, they set\r\nforth from Acre to return to the Grand Kaan, and got as far as\r\nLayas. But shortly after their arrival there they had news that the\r\nLegate aforesaid was chosen Pope, taking the name of Pope Gregory of\r\nPiacenza; news which the Two Brothers were very glad indeed to hear.\r\nAnd presently there reached them at Layas a message from the Legate,\r\nnow the Pope, desiring them, on the part of the Apostolic See, not to\r\nproceed further on their journey, but to return to him incontinently.\r\nAnd what shall I tell you? The King of Hermenia caused a galley to be\r\ngot ready for the Two Ambassador Brothers, and despatched them to the\r\nPope at Acre.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait of Pope Gregory X.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The death of Pope Clement IV. occurred on St Andrew’s\r\n  Day (29th November), 1268; the election of Tedaldo or Tebaldo of\r\n  Piacenza, a member of the Visconti family, and Archdeacon of Liège,\r\n  did not take place till 1st September, 1271, owing to the factions\r\n  among the cardinals. And it is said that some of them, anxious only\r\n  to get away, voted for Theobald in full belief that he was dead.\r\n  The conclave, in its inability to agree, had named a committee of\r\n  six with full powers which the same day elected Theobald, on the\r\n  recommendation of the Cardinal Bishop of Portus (John de Toleto,\r\n  said, in spite of his name, to have been an Englishman). This\r\n  facetious dignitary had suggested that the roof should be taken\r\n  off the Palace at Viterbo where they sat, to allow the divine\r\n  influences to descend more freely on their counsels (_quia nequeunt\r\n  ad nos per tot tecta ingredi_). According to some, these doggerel\r\n  verses, current on the occasion, were extemporised by Cardinal John\r\n  in the pious exuberance of his glee:—\r\n\r\n      “Papatûs munus tulit Archidiaconus unus\r\n       Quem Patrem Patrum fecit discordia Fratrum.”\r\n\r\n  The Archdeacon, a man of great weight of character, in consequence\r\n  of differences with his Bishop (of Liège), who was a disorderly\r\n  liver, had gone to the Holy Land, and during his stay there he\r\n  contracted great intimacy with Prince Edward of England (Edward\r\n  I.). Some authors, _e.g._ John Villani (VIII. 39), say that he was\r\n  Legate in Syria; others, as Rainaldus, deny this; but Polo’s\r\n  statement, and the authority which the Archdeacon took on himself\r\n  in writing to the Kaan, seem to show that he had some such position.\r\n\r\n  He took the name of Gregory X., and before his departure from\r\n  Acre, preached a moving sermon on the text, “_If I forget thee, O\r\n  Jerusalem_,” etc. Prince Edward fitted him out for his voyage.\r\n\r\n  Gregory reigned barely four years, dying at Arezzo 10th January,\r\n  1276. His character stood high to the last, and some of the\r\n  Northern Martyrologies enrolled him among the saints, but there\r\n  has never been canonisation by Rome. The people of Arezzo used\r\n  to celebrate his anniversary with torch-light gatherings at his\r\n  tomb, and plenty of miracles were alleged to have occurred there.\r\n  The tomb still stands in the Duomo at Arezzo, a handsome work\r\n  by Margaritone, an artist in all branches, who was the Pope’s\r\n  contemporary. There is an engraving of it in _Gonnelli, Mon.\r\n  Sepolc. di Toscana_.\r\n\r\n  (_Fra Pipino_ in _Muratori_, IX. 700; _Rainaldi Annal._ III. 252\r\n  _seqq._; _Wadding_, sub. an. 1217: _Bollandists_, 10th January;\r\n  _Palatii, Gesta Pontif.

He received them with great honour and satisfaction, and\r\ngave them his blessing. He then appointed two Friars of the Order of\r\nPreachers to accompany them to the Great Kaan, and to do whatever might\r\nbe required of them. These were unquestionably as learned Churchmen as\r\nwere to be found in the Province at that day—one being called Friar\r\nNicolas of Vicenza, and the other Friar William of Tripoli.{1} He\r\ndelivered to them also proper credentials, and letters in reply to the\r\nGreat Kaan’s messages [and gave them authority to ordain priests and\r\nbishops, and to bestow every kind of absolution, as if given by himself\r\nin proper person; sending by them also many fine vessels of crystal\r\nas presents to the Great Kaan].{2} So when they had got all that was\r\nneedful, they took leave of the Pope, receiving his benediction; and\r\nthe four set out together from Acre, and went to Layas, accompanied\r\nalways by Messer Nicolas’s son Marco.\r\n\r\nNow, about the time that they reached Layas, Bendocquedar, the Soldan\r\nof Babylon, invaded Hermenia with a great host of Saracens, and ravaged\r\nthe country, so that our Envoys ran a great peril of being taken or\r\nslain.{3} And when the Preaching Friars saw this they were greatly\r\nfrightened, and said that go they never would. So they made over to\r\nMesser Nicolas and Messer Maffeo all their credentials and documents,\r\nand took their leave, departing in company with the Master of the\r\nTemple.{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Friar William, of Tripoli, of the Dominican convent at\r\n  Acre, appears to have served there as early as 1250. [He was born\r\n  _circa_ 1220, at Tripoli, in Syria, whence his name.—H. C.] He is\r\n  known as the author of a book, _De Statu Saracenorum post Ludovici\r\n  Regis de Syriâ reditum_, dedicated to Theoldus, Archdeacon of\r\n  Liège (_i.e._ Pope Gregory). Of this some extracts are printed in\r\n  Duchesne’s _Hist. Francorum Scriptores_. There are two MSS. of it,\r\n  with different titles, in the Paris Library, and a French version\r\n  in that of Berne. A MS. in Cambridge Univ. Library, which contains\r\n  among other things a copy of Pipino’s Polo, has also the work of\r\n  Friar William:—“_Willelmus Tripolitanus, Aconensis Conventus,\r\n  de Egressu Machometi et Saracenorum, atque progressu eorumdem,\r\n  de Statu Saracenorum_,” etc. It is imperfect; it is addressed\r\n  THEOBALDO _Ecclesiarcho digno Sancte Terre Peregrino Sancto_. And\r\n  from a cursory inspection I imagine that the Tract appended to one\r\n  of the Polo MSS. in the British Museum (Addl. MSS., No. 19,952)\r\n  is the same work or part of it. To the same author is ascribed a\r\n  tract called _Clades Damiatae_. (_Duchesne_, V. 432; _D’Avezac_ in\r\n  _Rec. de Voyages_, IV. 406; _Quétif, Script. Ord. Praed._ I. 264–5;\r\n  _Catal. of MSS. in Camb. Univ. Library_, I. 22.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—I presume that the powers, stated in this passage from\r\n  Ramusio to have been conferred on the Friars, are exaggerated.\r\n  In letters of authority granted in like cases by Pope Gregory’s\r\n  successors, Nicolas III. (in 1278) and Boniface VIII. (in 1299),\r\n  the missionary friars to remote regions are empowered to absolve\r\n  from excommunication and release from vows, to settle matrimonial\r\n  questions, to found churches and appoint _idoneos rectores_,\r\n  to authorise Oriental clergy who should publicly submit to the\r\n  Apostolic See to enjoy the _privilegium clericale_, whilst in the\r\n  absence of bishops those among the missionaries who were priests\r\n  might consecrate cemeteries, altars, palls, etc., admit to the\r\n  Order of Acolytes, but nothing beyond. (See _Mosheim, Hist. Tartar.\r\n  Eccles._ App. Nos. 23 and 42.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The statement here about Bundúḳdár’s invasion of Cilician\r\n  Armenia is a difficulty. He had invaded it in 1266, and his second\r\n  devastating invasion, during which he burnt both Layas and Sis,\r\n  the king’s residence, took place in 1275, a point on which Marino\r\n  Sanuto is at one with the Oriental Historians. Now we know from\r\n  Rainaldus that Pope Gregory left Acre in November or December,\r\n  1271, and the text appears to imply that our travellers left Acre\r\n  before him. The utmost corroboration that I can find lies in the\r\n  following facts stated by Makrizi:—\r\n\r\n  On the 13th Safar, A.H. 670 (20th September 1271), Bundúḳdár\r\n  arrived unexpectedly at Damascus, and after a brief raid against\r\n  the Ismaelians he returned to that city. In the middle of Rabi I.\r\n  (about 20–25 October) the Tartars made an incursion in northern\r\n  Syria, and the troops of Aleppo retired towards Hamah. There was\r\n  great alarm at Damascus; the Sultan sent orders to Cairo for\r\n  reinforcements, and these arrived at Damascus on the 9th November.\r\n  The Sultan then advanced on Aleppo, sending corps likewise towards\r\n  Marash (which was within the Armenian frontier) and Harran. At\r\n  the latter place the Tartars were attacked and those in the town\r\n  slaughtered; the rest retreated. The Sultan was back at Damascus,\r\n  and off on a different expedition, by 7th December. Hence, if the\r\n  travellers arrived at Ayas towards the latter part of November they\r\n  would probably find alarm existing at the advance of Bundúḳdár,\r\n  though matters did not turn out so serious as they imply.\r\n\r\n  “Babylon,” of which Bundúḳdár is here styled Sultan, means Cairo,\r\n  commonly so styled (_Bambellonia d’Egitto_) in that age. Babylon\r\n  of Egypt is mentioned by Diodorus quoting Ctesias, by Strabo, and\r\n  by Ptolemy; it was the station of a Roman Legion in the days of\r\n  Augustus, and still survives in the name of _Babul_, close to old\r\n  Cairo.\r\n\r\n  Malik Dáhir Ruknuddín Bíbars Bundúḳdári, a native of Kipchak, was\r\n  originally sold at Damascus for 800 dirhems (about 18_l._), and\r\n  returned by his purchaser because of a blemish. He was then bought\r\n  by the Amir Aláuddín Aidekín _Bundúḳdár_ (“The Arblasteer”) whose\r\n  surname he afterwards adopted. He became the fourth of the Mameluke\r\n  Sultans, and reigned from 1259 to 1276. The two great objects of\r\n  his life were the repression of the Tartars and the expulsion of\r\n  the Christians from Syria, so that his reign was one of constant\r\n  war and enormous activity. William of Tripoli, in the work above\r\n  mentioned, says: “Bondogar, as a soldier, was not inferior to\r\n  Julius Caesar, nor in malignity to Nero.” He admits, however, that\r\n  the Sultan was sober, chaste, just to his own people, and even kind\r\n  to his Christian subjects; whilst Makrizi calls him one of the best\r\n  princes that ever reigned over Musulmans. Yet if we take Bibars as\r\n  painted by this admiring historian and by other Arabic documents,\r\n  the second of Friar William’s comparisons is justified, for he\r\n  seems almost a devil in malignity as well as in activity. More than\r\n  once he played tennis at Damascus and Cairo within the same week. A\r\n  strange sample of the man is the letter which he wrote to Boemond,\r\n  Prince of Antioch and Tripoli, to announce to him the capture of\r\n  the former city. After an ironically polite address to Boemond as\r\n  having by the loss of his great city had his title changed from\r\n  Princeship (_Al-Brensíyah_) to Countship (_Al-Komasíyah_), and\r\n  describing his own devastations round Tripoli, he comes to the\r\n  attack of Antioch: “We carried the place, sword in hand, at the\r\n  4th hour of Saturday, the 4th day of Ramadhán, ... Hadst thou but\r\n  seen thy Knights trodden under the hoofs of the horses! thy palaces\r\n  invaded by plunderers and ransacked for booty! thy treasures\r\n  weighed out by the hundredweight! thy ladies (_Dámátaka_, ‘tes\r\n  DAMES’) bought and sold with thine own gear, at four for a dinár!\r\n  hadst thou but seen thy churches demolished, thy crosses sawn in\r\n  sunder, thy garbled Gospels hawked about before the sun, the tombs\r\n  of thy nobles cast to the ground; thy foe the Moslem treading thy\r\n  Holy of the Holies; the monk, the priest, the deacon slaughtered\r\n  on the Altar; the rich given up to misery; princes of royal blood\r\n  reduced to slavery! Couldst thou but have seen the flames devouring\r\n  thy halls; thy dead cast into the fires temporal with the fires\r\n  eternal hard at hand; the churches of Paul and of Cosmas rocking\r\n  and going down—, then wouldst thou have said, ‘Would God that I\r\n  were dust!’ ... As not a man hath escaped to tell thee the tale, I\r\n  TELL IT THEE!”\r\n\r\n  A little later, when a mission went to treat with Boemond, Bibars\r\n  himself accompanied it in disguise, to have a look at the defences\r\n  of Tripoli. In drawing out the terms, the Envoys styled Boemond\r\n  _Count_, not _Prince_, as in the letter just quoted. He lost\r\n  patience at their persistence, and made a movement which alarmed\r\n  them. Bibars nudged the Envoy Mohiuddin (who tells the story)\r\n  with his foot to give up the point, and the treaty was made. On\r\n  their way back the Sultan laughed heartily at their narrow escape,\r\n  “sending to the devil all the counts and princes on the face of the\r\n  earth.”\r\n\r\n  (_Quatremère’s Makrizi_, II. 92–101, and 190 _seqq._; _J.

They had, however, considerable possessions and great\r\n  influence in Cilician Armenia, and how much they were mixed up in\r\n  its affairs is shown by a circumstance related by Makrizi. In 1285,\r\n  when Sultan Mansúr, the successor of Bundúḳdár, was besieging\r\n  the Castle of Markab, there arrived in Camp the Commander of the\r\n  Temple (_Kamandúr-ul Dewet_) of the Country of Armenia, charged\r\n  to negotiate on the part of the King of Sis (_i.e._ of Lesser\r\n  Armenia, Leon III. 1268–1289, successor of Hayton I. 1224–1268),\r\n  and bringing presents from him and from the Master of the Temple,\r\n  Berard’s successor, William de Beaujeu (1273–1291).

Their\r\njourney back to the Kaan occupied a good three years and a half, owing\r\nto the bad weather and severe cold that they encountered. And let me\r\ntell you in good sooth that when the Great Kaan heard that Messers\r\nNicolo and Maffeo Polo were on their way back, he sent people a journey\r\nof full 40 days to meet them; and on this journey, as on their former\r\none, they were honourably entertained upon the road, and supplied with\r\nall that they required.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The French texts read _Clemeinfu_, Ramusio _Clemenfu_.\r\n  The Pucci MS. guides us to the correct reading, having _Chemensu_\r\n  (_Kemensu_) for _Chemenfu_. KAIPINGFU, meaning something like\r\n  “City of Peace,” and called by Rashiduddin _Kaiminfu_ (whereby\r\n  we see that Polo as usual adopted the Persian form of the name),\r\n  was a city founded in 1256, four years before Kublai’s accession,\r\n  some distance to the north of the Chinese wall. It became Kublai’s\r\n  favourite summer residence, and was styled from 1264 _Shangtu_\r\n  or “Upper Court.” (See _infra_, Bk. I. ch. lxi.) It was known to\r\n  the Mongols, apparently by a combination of the two names, as\r\n  _Shangdu Keibung_. It appears in D’Anville’s map under the name of\r\n  _Djao-Naiman Sumé_. Dr. Bushell, who visited Shangtu in 1872, makes\r\n  it 1103 _li_ (367 miles) by road distance _viâ_ Kalgan from Peking.\r\n  The busy town of Dolonnúr lies 26 miles S.E. of it, and according\r\n  to Kiepert’s _Asia_ that place is about 180 miles in a direct line\r\n  north of Peking.\r\n\r\n  (See _Klaproth_ in _J. As._ XI. 365; _Gaubil_, p. 115; _Cathay_, p.\r\n  260; _J. R. G.

So they\r\nbent the knee before him, and paid their respects to him, with all\r\npossible reverence [prostrating themselves on the ground]. Then the\r\nLord bade them stand up, and treated them with great honour, showing\r\ngreat pleasure at their coming, and asked many questions as to their\r\nwelfare, and how they had sped. They replied that they had in verity\r\nsped well, seeing that they found the Kaan well and safe. Then they\r\npresented the credentials and letters which they had received from\r\nthe Pope, which pleased him right well; and after that they produced\r\nthe Oil from the Sepulchre, and at that also he was very glad, for he\r\nset great store thereby. And next, spying Mark, who was then a young\r\ngallant,{1} he asked who was that in their company? “Sire,” said his\r\nfather, Messer Nicolo, “’tis my son and your liegeman.”{2} “Welcome is\r\nhe too,” quoth the Emperor. And why should I make a long story? There\r\nwas great rejoicing at the Court because of their arrival; and they met\r\nwith attention and honour from everybody.\r\n\r\nSo there they abode at the Court with the other Barons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“_Joenne Bacheler_.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Sire, il est mon filz et vostre_ homme.” The last word\r\n  in the sense which gives us the word _homage_. Thus in the miracle\r\n  play of Theophilus (13th century), the Devil says to Theophilus:—\r\n\r\n                                        “Or joing\r\n                Tes mains, et si devien _mes hom_.\r\n      _Theoph._ Vez ci que je vous faz _hommage_.”\r\n\r\n  So _infra_ (Bk. I. ch. xlvii.) Aung Khan is made to say of Chinghiz:\r\n  “_Il est_ mon homes _et mon serf_.” (See also Bk. II. ch. iv.\r\n  note.) St. Lewis said of the peace he had made with Henry III.: “Il\r\n  m’est mout grant honneur en la paix que je foiz au Roy d’Angleterre\r\n  pour ce qu’il est _mon home_, ce que n’estoit pas devant.” And\r\n  Joinville says with regard to the king, “Je ne voz faire point\r\n  de serement, car je n’estoie pas _son home_” (being a vassal of\r\n  Champagne). A famous Saturday Reviewer quotes the term applied to\r\n  a lady: “_Eddeva puella_ homo _Stigandi Archiepiscopi_.” (_Théâtre\r\n  Français au Moyen Age_, p. 145; _Joinville_, pp. 21, 37; _S. R._,\r\n  6th September, 1873, p. 305.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n            HOW THE EMPEROR SENT MARK ON AN EMBASSY OF HIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that Marco, the son of Messer Nicolo, sped\r\nwondrously in learning the customs of the Tartars, as well as their\r\nlanguage, their manner of writing, and their practice of war; in fact\r\nhe came in brief space to know several languages, and four sundry\r\nwritten characters. And he was discreet and prudent in every way,\r\ninsomuch that the Emperor held him in great esteem.{1} And so when he\r\ndiscerned Mark to have so much sense, and to conduct himself so well\r\nand beseemingly, he sent him on an ambassage of his, to a country\r\nwhich was a good six months’ journey distant.{2} The young gallant\r\nexecuted his commission well and with discretion. Now he had taken\r\nnote on several occasions that when the Prince’s ambassadors returned\r\nfrom different parts of the world, they were able to tell him about\r\nnothing except the business on which they had gone, and that the\r\nPrince in consequence held them for no better than fools and dolts,\r\nand would say: “I had far liever hearken about the strange things,\r\nand the manners of the different countries you have seen, than merely\r\nbe told of the business you went upon;”—for he took great delight in\r\nhearing of the affairs of strange countries. Mark therefore, as he went\r\nand returned, took great pains to learn about all kinds of different\r\nmatters in the countries which he visited, in order to be able to tell\r\nabout them to the Great Kaan.{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The word Emperor stands here for _Seigneur_.\r\n\r\n  What the four characters acquired by Marco were is open to\r\n  discussion.\r\n\r\n  The Chronicle of the Mongol Emperors rendered by Gaubil mentions,\r\n  as characters used in their Empire, the Uíghúr, the Persian and\r\n  Arabic, that of the Lamas (Tibetan), that of the Niuché, introduced\r\n  by the Kin Dynasty, the Khitán, and the _Báshpah_ character,\r\n  a syllabic alphabet arranged, on the basis of the Tibetan and\r\n  Sanskrit letters chiefly, by a learned chief Lama so-called,\r\n  under the orders of Kublai, and established by edict in 1269 as\r\n  the official character. Coins bearing this character, and dating\r\n  from 1308 to 1354, are extant. The forms of the Niuché and Khitán\r\n  were devised in imitation of Chinese writing, but are supposed to\r\n  be syllabic. Of the Khitán but one inscription was known, and no\r\n  key. “The Khitan had two national scripts, the ‘small characters’\r\n  (_hsiao tzŭ_) and the ‘large characters’ (_ta tzŭ_).” S. W.

Grube,\r\n  Leipzig, 1896, from a polyglot MS. dictionary, discovered by Dr. F.\r\n  Hirth and now kept in the Royal Library, Berlin.—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n  Chinghiz and his first successors used the Uíghúr, and sometimes\r\n  the Chinese character. Of the Uíghúr character we give a specimen\r\n  in Bk. IV. It is of Syriac origin, undoubtedly introduced into\r\n  Eastern Turkestan by the early Nestorian missions, probably in the\r\n  8th or 9th century. The oldest known example of this character so\r\n  applied, the _Kudatku Bilik_, a didactic poem in Uíghúr (a branch\r\n  of Oriental Turkish), dating from A.D. 1069, was published by\r\n  Prof. Vámbéry in 1870. A new edition of the _Kudatku Bilik_ was\r\n  published at St. Petersburg, in 1891, by Dr. W. Radloff. Vámbéry\r\n  had a pleasing illustration of the origin of the Uíghúr character,\r\n  when he received a visit at Pesth from certain Nestorians of\r\n  Urumia on a begging tour. On being shown the original MS. of the\r\n  _Kudatku Bilik_, they read the character easily, whilst much to\r\n  their astonishment they could not understand a word of what was\r\n  written. This Uíghúr is the basis of the modern Mongol and Manchu\r\n  characters. (Cf. E. Bretschneider, _Mediæval Researches_, I. pp.\r\n  236, 263.)—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n  [At the village of Keuyung Kwan, 40 miles north of Peking, in the\r\n  sub-prefecture of Ch’ang Ping, in the Chih-li province, the road\r\n  from Peking to Kalgan runs beyond the pass of Nankau, under an\r\n  archway, a view of which will be found at the end of this volume,\r\n  on which were engraved, in 1345, two large inscriptions in six\r\n  different languages: Sanskrit, Tibetan, Mongol, _Báshpah_, Uíghúr,\r\n  Chinese, and a language unknown till recently. Mr. Wylie’s kindness\r\n  enabled Sir Henry Yule to present a specimen of this. (A much\r\n  better facsimile of these inscriptions than Wylie’s having since\r\n  been published by Prince Roland Bonaparte in his valuable _Recueil\r\n  des Documents de l’Époque Mongole_, this latter is, by permission,\r\n  here reproduced.) The Chinese and Mongol inscriptions have been\r\n  translated by M. Ed. Chavannes; the Tibetan by M. Sylvain Lévi\r\n  (_Jour. Asiat._, Sept.–Oct. 1894, pp. 354–373); the Uíghúr, by\r\n  Prof. W. Radloff (_Ibid._ Nov.–Dec. 1894, pp. 546, 550); the Mongol\r\n  by Prof. G. Huth. (_Ibid._ Mars–Avril 1895, pp. 351–360.) The\r\n  sixth language was supposed by A. Wylie (_J. R. A. S._ vol. xvii.\r\n  p. 331, and N.S., vol. v. p. 14) to be Neuchih, Niuché, Niuchen\r\n  or Juchen. M. Devéria has shown that the inscription is written\r\n  in _Si Hia_, or the language of Tangut, and gave a facsimile of a\r\n  stone stèle (_pei_) in this language kept in the great Monastery\r\n  of the Clouds (Ta Yun Ssŭ) at Liangchau in Kansuh, together with a\r\n  translation of the Chinese text, engraved on the reverse side of\r\n  the slab. M. Devéria thinks that this writing was borrowed by the\r\n  Kings of Tangut from the one derived in 920 by the Khitans from\r\n  the Chinese. (_Stèle Si-Hia de Leang-tcheou_ ... _J.

No. 2, pp. 142, 160) has also made a special study\r\n  of the same subject. The Si Hia writing was adopted by Yuan Ho in\r\n  1036, on which occasion he changed the title of his reign to Ta\r\n  Ch’ing, _i.e._ “Great Good Fortune.” Unfortunately, both the late\r\n  M. Devéria and Dr. S. W. Bushell have deciphered but few of the Si\r\n  Hia characters.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Hexaglot Inscription on the East side of the Kiu-Yong\r\n    Kwan.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Hexaglot Inscription on the West side of the Kiu-Yong\r\n    Kwan.]\r\n\r\n  The orders of the Great Kaan are stated to have been published\r\n  habitually in six languages, viz., Mongol, Uíghúr, Arabic, Persian,\r\n  Tangutan (Si-Hia), and Chinese.—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n  Gházán Khan of Persia is said to have understood Mongol, Arabic,\r\n  Persian, something of Kashmiri, of Tibetan, of Chinese, and a\r\n  little of the _Frank_ tongue (probably French).\r\n\r\n  The annals of the Ming Dynasty, which succeeded the Mongols in\r\n  China, mention the establishment in the 11th moon of the 5th year\r\n  Yong-lo (1407) of the _Sse yi kwan_, a linguistic office for\r\n  diplomatic purposes. The languages to be studied were Niuché,\r\n  Mongol, Tibetan, Sanskrit, Bokharan (Persian?), Uíghúr, Burmese,\r\n  and Siamese. To these were added by the Manchu Dynasty two\r\n  languages called _Papeh_ and _Pehyih_, both dialects of the S.W.\r\n  frontier. (See _infra_, Bk. II. ch. lvi.–lvii., and notes.) Since\r\n  1382, however, official interpreters had to translate Mongol texts;\r\n  they were selected among the Academicians, and their service\r\n  (which was independent of the _Sse yi kwan_ when this was created)\r\n  was under the control of the _Han-lin-yuen_. There may have been\r\n  similar institutions under the Yuen, but we have no proof of it. At\r\n  all events, such an office could not then be called _Sse yi kwan_\r\n  (_Sse yi_, Barbarians from four sides); Niuché (Niuchen) was taught\r\n  in Yong-lo’s office, but not Manchu. The _Sse yi kwan_ must not be\r\n  confounded with the _Hui t’ong kwan_, the office for the reception\r\n  of tributary envoys, to which it was annexed in 1748. (_Gaubil_, p.\r\n  148; _Gold.

I entirely reject\r\n  the Chinese. Sir H. Yule adds: “We shall see no reason to believe\r\n  that he knew either language or character” [Chinese]. The blunders\r\n  Polo made in saying that the name of the city, Suju, signifies\r\n  in our tongue “Earth” and Kinsay “Heaven” show he did not know\r\n  the Chinese characters, but we read in Bk. II. ch. lxviii.: “And\r\n  Messer Marco Polo himself, of whom this Book speaks, did govern\r\n  this city (Yanju) for three full years, by the order of the Great\r\n  Kaan.” It seems to me [H. C.] hardly possible that Marco could have\r\n  for three years been governor of so important and so Chinese a\r\n  city as Yangchau, in the heart of the Empire, without acquiring a\r\n  knowledge of the spoken language.—H. C. The other three languages\r\n  seem highly probable. The fourth may have been Tibetan. But it is\r\n  more likely that he counted separately two varieties of the same\r\n  character (_e.g._ of the Arabic and Persian) as two “_lettres de\r\n  leur escriptures_.”—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—[Ramusio here adds: “Ad und città, detta Carazan,” which,\r\n  as we shall see, refers to the Yun-nan Province.]—H. C.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—From the context no doubt Marco’s employments were\r\n  honourable and confidential; but _Commissioner_ would perhaps\r\n  better express them than Ambassador in the modern sense. The word\r\n  _Ilchi_, which was probably in his mind, was applied to a large\r\n  variety of classes employed on the commissions of Government, as\r\n  we may see from a passage of Rashiduddin in D’Ohsson, which says\r\n  that “there were always to be found in every city from one to two\r\n  hundred _Ilchis_, who forced the citizens to furnish them with free\r\n  quarters,” etc., III. 404. (See also 485.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n           HOW MARK RETURNED FROM THE MISSION WHEREON HE HAD\r\n                              BEEN SENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mark returned from his ambassage he presented himself before the\r\nEmperor, and after making his report of the business with which he\r\nwas charged, and its successful accomplishment, he went on to give an\r\naccount in a pleasant and intelligent manner of all the novelties and\r\nstrange things that he had seen and heard; insomuch that the Emperor\r\nand all such as heard his story were surprised, and said: “If this\r\nyoung man live, he will assuredly come to be a person of great worth\r\nand ability.” And so from that time forward he was always entitled\r\nMESSER MARCO POLO, and thus we shall style him henceforth in this Book\r\nof ours, as is but right.\r\n\r\nThereafter Messer Marco abode in the Kaan’s employment some seventeen\r\nyears, continually going and coming, hither and thither, on the\r\nmissions that were entrusted to him by the Lord [and sometimes, with\r\nthe permission and authority of the Great Kaan, on his own private\r\naffairs.] And, as he knew all the sovereign’s ways, like a sensible\r\nman he always took much pains to gather knowledge of anything that\r\nwould be likely to interest him, and then on his return to Court he\r\nwould relate everything in regular order, and thus the Emperor came\r\nto hold him in great love and favour. And for this reason also he\r\nwould employ him the oftener on the most weighty and most distant of\r\nhis missions. These Messer Marco ever carried out with discretion and\r\nsuccess, God be thanked. So the Emperor became ever more partial to\r\nhim, and treated him with the greater distinction, and kept him so\r\nclose to his person that some of the Barons waxed very envious thereat.\r\nAnd thus it came about that Messer Marco Polo had knowledge of, or had\r\nactually visited, a greater number of the different countries of the\r\nWorld than any other man; the more that he was always giving his mind\r\nto get knowledge, and to spy out and enquire into everything in order\r\nto have matter to relate to the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n       HOW MESSER NICOLO, MESSER MAFFEO, AND MESSER MARCO, ASKED\r\n               LEAVE OF THE GREAT KAAN TO GO THEIR WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Two Brothers and Mark had abode with the Lord all that time\r\nthat you have been told [having meanwhile acquired great wealth\r\nin jewels and gold], they began among themselves to have thoughts\r\nabout returning to their own country; and indeed it was time. [For,\r\nto say nothing of the length and infinite perils of the way, when\r\nthey considered the Kaan’s great age, they doubted whether, in the\r\nevent of his death before their departure, they would ever be able\r\nto get home.{1}] They applied to him several times for leave to\r\ngo, presenting their request with great respect, but he had such a\r\npartiality for them, and liked so much to have them about him, that\r\nnothing on earth would persuade him to let them go.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass in those days that the Queen BOLGANA, wife of\r\nARGON, Lord of the Levant, departed this life. And in her Will she had\r\ndesired that no Lady should take her place, or succeed her as Argon’s\r\nwife, except one of her own family [which existed in Cathay]. Argon\r\ntherefore despatched three of his Barons, by name respectively OULATAY,\r\nAPUSCA, and COJA, as ambassadors to the Great Kaan, attended by a very\r\ngallant company, in order to bring back as his bride a lady of the\r\nfamily of Queen Bolgana, his late wife.{2}\r\n\r\nWhen these three Barons had reached the Court of the Great Kaan, they\r\ndelivered their message, explaining wherefore they were come. The Kaan\r\nreceived them with all honour and hospitality, and then sent for a lady\r\nwhose name was COCACHIN, who was of the family of the deceased Queen\r\nBolgana. She was a maiden of 17, a very beautiful and charming person,\r\nand on her arrival at Court she was presented to the three Barons as\r\nthe Lady chosen in compliance with their demand. They declared that the\r\nLady pleased them well.{3}\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Messer Marco chanced to return from India, whither he had\r\ngone as the Lord’s ambassador, and made his report of all the different\r\nthings that he had seen in his travels, and of the sundry seas over\r\nwhich he had voyaged. And the three Barons, having seen that Messer\r\nNicolo, Messer Maffeo, and Messer Marco were not only Latins, but men\r\nof marvellous good sense withal, took thought among themselves to get\r\nthe three to travel with them, their intention being to return to their\r\ncountry by sea, on account of the great fatigue of that long land\r\njourney for a lady. And the ambassadors were the more desirous to have\r\ntheir company, as being aware that those three had great knowledge and\r\nexperience of the Indian Sea and the countries by which they would have\r\nto pass, and especially Messer Marco. So they went to the Great Kaan,\r\nand begged as a favour that he would send the three Latins with them,\r\nas it was their desire to return home by sea.\r\n\r\nThe Lord, having that great regard that I have mentioned for those\r\nthree Latins, was very loath to do so [and his countenance showed great\r\ndissatisfaction]. But at last he did give them permission to depart,\r\nenjoining them to accompany the three Barons and the Lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Pegolotti, in his chapters on mercantile ventures to\r\n  Cathay, refers to the dangers to which foreigners were always\r\n  liable on the death of the reigning sovereign. (See _Cathay_, p.\r\n  292.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Several ladies of the name of BULUGHAN (“Zibellina”) have\r\n  a place in Mongol-Persian history. The one here indicated, a lady\r\n  of great beauty and ability, was known as the _Great Khátún_ (or\r\n  Lady) Bulughan, and was (according to strange Mongol custom) the\r\n  wife successively of Ábáḳa and of his son ARGHUN, the Argon of the\r\n  text, Mongol sovereign of Persia. She died on the banks of the Kur\r\n  in Georgia, 7th April, 1286. She belonged to the Mongol tribe of\r\n  Bayaut, and was the daughter of Hulákú’s Chief Secretary Gúgah.\r\n  (_Ilchan._ I. 374 _et passim; Erdmann’s Temudschin_, p. 216.)\r\n\r\n  The names of the Envoys, ULADAI, APUSHKA, and KOJA, are all names\r\n  met with in Mongol history. And Rashiduddin speaks of an Apushka\r\n  of the Mongol Tribe of Urnaut, who on some occasion was sent as\r\n  Envoy to the Great Kaan from Persia,—possibly the very person. (See\r\n  _Erdmann_, 205.)\r\n\r\n  Of the Lady Cocachin we shall speak below.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Ramusio here has the following passage, genuine no doubt:\r\n  “So everything being ready, with a great escort to do honour to the\r\n  bride of King Argon, the Ambassadors took leave and set forth. But\r\n  after travelling eight months by the same way that they had come,\r\n  they found the roads closed, in consequence of wars lately broken\r\n  out among certain Tartar Princes; so being unable to proceed, they\r\n  were compelled to return to the Court of the Great Kaan.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE TWO BROTHERS AND MESSER MARCO TOOK LEAVE OF THE\r\n            GREAT KAAN, AND RETURNED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the Prince saw that the Two Brothers and Messer Marco were\r\nready to set forth, he called them all three to his presence, and\r\ngave them two golden Tablets of Authority, which should secure them\r\nliberty of passage through all his dominions, and by means of which,\r\nwhithersoever they should go, all necessaries would be provided for\r\nthem, and for all their company, and whatever they might choose to\r\norder.{1} He charged them also with messages to the King of France,\r\nthe King of England,{2} the King of Spain, and the other kings of\r\nChristendom. He then caused thirteen ships to be equipt, each of which\r\nhad four masts, and often spread twelve sails.{3} And I could easily\r\ngive you all particulars about these, but as it would be so long an\r\naffair I will not enter upon this now, but hereafter, when time and\r\nplace are suitable. [Among the said ships were at least four or five\r\nthat carried crews of 250 or 260 men.]\r\n\r\nAnd when the ships had been equipt, the Three Barons and the Lady, and\r\nthe Two Brothers and Messer Marco, took leave of the Great Kaan, and\r\nwent on board their ships with a great company of people, and with all\r\nnecessaries provided for two years by the Emperor. They put forth to\r\nsea, and after sailing for some three months they arrived at a certain\r\nIsland towards the South, which is called JAVA,{4} and in which there\r\nare many wonderful things which we shall tell you all about by-and-bye.\r\nQuitting this Island they continued to navigate the Sea of India for\r\neighteen months more before they arrived whither they were bound,\r\nmeeting on their way also with many marvels, of which we shall tell\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd when they got thither they found that Argon was dead, so the Lady\r\nwas delivered to CASAN, his son.\r\n\r\nBut I should have told you that it is a fact that, when they embarked,\r\nthey were in number some 600 persons, without counting the mariners;\r\nbut nearly all died by the way, so that only eight survived.{5}\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty when they arrived was held by KIACATU, so they\r\ncommended the Lady to him, and executed all their commission. And when\r\nthe Two Brothers and Messer Marco had executed their charge in full,\r\nand done all that the Great Kaan had enjoined on them in regard to\r\nthe Lady, they took their leave and set out upon their journey.{6}\r\nAnd before their departure, Kiacatu gave them four golden tablets of\r\nauthority, two of which bore gerfalcons, one bore lions, whilst the\r\nfourth was plain, and having on them inscriptions which directed that\r\nthe three Ambassadors should receive honour and service all through the\r\nland as if rendered to the Prince in person, and that horses and all\r\nprovisions, and everything necessary, should be supplied to them. And\r\nso they found in fact; for throughout the country they received ample\r\nand excellent supplies of everything needful; and many a time indeed,\r\nas I may tell you, they were furnished with 200 horsemen, more or\r\nless, to escort them on their way in safety. And this was all the more\r\nneedful because Kiacatu was not the legitimate Lord, and therefore the\r\npeople had less scruple to do mischief than if they had had a lawful\r\nprince.{7}\r\n\r\nAnother thing too must be mentioned, which does credit to those three\r\nAmbassadors, and shows for what great personages they were held. The\r\nGreat Kaan regarded them with such trust and affection, that he had\r\nconfided to their charge the Queen Cocachin, as well as the daughter\r\nof the King of Manzi,{8} to conduct to Argon the Lord of all the\r\nLevant. And those two great ladies who were thus entrusted to them they\r\nwatched over and guarded as if they had been daughters of their own,\r\nuntil they had transferred them to the hands of their Lord; whilst the\r\nladies, young and fair as they were, looked on each of those three as a\r\nfather, and obeyed them accordingly. Indeed, both Casan, who is now the\r\nreigning prince, and the Queen Cocachin his wife, have such a regard\r\nfor the Envoys that there is nothing they would not do for them. And\r\nwhen the three Ambassadors took leave of that Lady to return to their\r\nown country, she wept for sorrow at the parting.\r\n\r\nWhat more shall I say? Having left Kiacatu they travelled day by\r\nday till they came to Trebizond, and thence to Constantinople, from\r\nConstantinople to Negropont, and from Negropont to Venice. And this was\r\nin the year 1295 of Christ’s Incarnation.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have rehearsed all the Prologue as you have heard, we\r\nshall begin the Book of the Description of the Divers Things that\r\nMesser Marco met with in his Travels.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—On these plates or tablets, which have already been\r\n  spoken of, a note will be found further on. (Bk. II. ch. vii.)\r\n  Plano Carpini says of the Mongol practice in reference to royal\r\n  messengers: “Nuncios, quoscunque et quotcunque, et ubicunque\r\n  transmittit, oportet quod dent eis sine morâ equos subductitios et\r\n  expensas” (669).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The mention of the King of England appears for the first\r\n  time in Pauthier’s text. Probably we shall never know if the\r\n  communication reached him. But we have the record of several\r\n  embassies in preceding and subsequent years from the Mongol Khans\r\n  of Persia to the Kings of England; all with the view of obtaining\r\n  co-operation in attack on the Egyptian Sultan. Such messages came\r\n  from Ábáḳa in 1277; from Arghún in 1289 and 1291; from Gházán in\r\n  1302; from Oljaitu in 1307. (See _Rémusat_ in _Mém. de l’Acad._\r\n  VII.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Ramusio has “_nine_ sails.” Marsden thinks even this\r\n  lower number an error of Ramusio’s, as “it is well known that\r\n  Chinese vessels do not carry any kind of topsail.” This is,\r\n  however, a mistake, for they do sometimes carry a small topsail\r\n  of cotton cloth (and formerly, it would seem from Lecomte, even a\r\n  topgallant sail at times), though only in quiet weather. And the\r\n  evidence as to the number of sails carried by the great Chinese\r\n  junks of the Middle Ages, which evidently made a great impression\r\n  on Western foreigners, is irresistible. Friar Jordanus, who saw\r\n  them in Malabar, says: “With a fair wind they carry ten sails;”\r\n  Ibn Batuta: “One of these great junks carries from three sails\r\n  to twelve;” Joseph, the Indian, speaking of those that traded\r\n  to India in the 15th century: “They were very great, and had\r\n  sometimes twelve sails, with innumerable rowers.” (_Lecomte_, I.\r\n  389; _Fr. Jordanus_, Hak. Soc., p. 55; _Ibn Batuta_, IV. 91; _Novus\r\n  Orbis_, p. 148.) A fuller account of these vessels is given at the\r\n  beginning of Bk. III.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Ancient Chinese War Vessel.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—_I.e._ in this case Sumatra, as will appear hereafter. “It\r\n  is quite possible for a fleet of fourteen junks which required\r\n  to keep together to take three months at the present time to\r\n  accomplish a similar voyage. A Chinese trader, who has come\r\n  annually to Singapore in junks for many years, tells us that he\r\n  has had as long a passage as sixty days, although the average is\r\n  eighteen or twenty days.” (_Logan_ in _J. Ind. Archip._ II. 609.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Ramusio’s version here varies widely, and looks more\r\n  probable: “From the day that they embarked until their arrival\r\n  there died of mariners and others on board 600 persons; and of the\r\n  three ambassadors only one survived, whose name was Goza (_Coja_);\r\n  but of the ladies and damsels died but one.”\r\n\r\n  It is worth noting that in the case of an embassy sent to Cathay a\r\n  few years later by Gházán Khan, on the return by this same route\r\n  to Persia, the chief of the two Persian ambassadors, and the Great\r\n  Khan’s envoy, who was in company, both died by the way. Their\r\n  voyage, too, seems to have been nearly as long as Polo’s; for they\r\n  were seven years absent from Persia, and of these only four in\r\n  China. (See _Wassáf_ in _Elliot_, III. 47.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—Ramusio’s version states that on learning Arghún’s death\r\n  (which they probably did on landing at Hormuz), they sent word of\r\n  their arrival to Kiacatu, who directed them to conduct the lady to\r\n  Casan, who was then in the region of the _Arbre Sec_ (the Province\r\n  of Khorasan) guarding the frontier passes with 60,000 men, and that\r\n  they did so, and then turned back to Kiacatu (probably at Tabriz),\r\n  and stayed at his Court nine months. Even the Geog. Text seems to\r\n  imply that they had become personally known to Casan, and I have\r\n  no doubt that Ramusio’s statement is an authentic expansion of the\r\n  original narrative by Marco himself, or on his authority.\r\n\r\n  Arghún Khan died 10th March, 1291. He was succeeded (23rd July) by\r\n  his brother Kaikhátú (_Quiacatu_ of Polo), who was put to death\r\n  24th March, 1295.\r\n\r\n  We learn from Hammer’s History of the Ilkhans that when Gházán,\r\n  the son of Arghún (_Casan_ of Polo), who had the government of the\r\n  Khorasan frontier, was on his return to his post from Tabriz, where\r\n  his uncle Kaikhatu had refused to see him, “he met at Abher the\r\n  ambassador whom he had sent to the Great Khan to obtain in marriage\r\n  a relative of the Great Lady Bulghán. This envoy brought with him\r\n  the Lady KÚKÁCHIN (our author’s _Cocachin_), with presents from the\r\n  Emperor, and the marriage was celebrated with due festivity.” Abher\r\n  lies a little west of Kazvín.\r\n\r\n  Hammer is not, I find, here copying from Wassáf, and I have not\r\n  been able to procure a thorough search of the work of Rashiduddin,\r\n  which probably was his authority. As well as the date can be made\r\n  out from the History of the Ilkhans, Gházán must have met his\r\n  bride towards the end of 1293, or quite the beginning of 1294.\r\n  Rashiduddin in another place mentions the fair lady from Cathay;\r\n  “The _ordu_ (or establishment) of Tukiti Khatun was given to\r\n  KUKACHI KHATUN, who had been brought from the Kaan’s Court, and who\r\n  was a kinswoman of the late chief Queen Bulghán. Kúkáchi, the wife\r\n  of the Padshah of Islam, Gházán Khan, died in the month of Shaban,\r\n  695,” _i.e._ in June, 1296, so that the poor girl did not long\r\n  survive her promotion. (See _Hammer’s Ilch._ II. 20, and 8, and I.\r\n  273; and _Quatremère’s Rashiduddin_, p. 97.) Kukachin was the name\r\n  also of the wife of Chingkim, Kublai’s favourite son; but she was\r\n  of the Kungurát tribe. (_Deguignes_, IV. 179.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—Here Ramusio’s text says: “During this journey Messers\r\n  Nicolo, Maffeo, and Marco heard the news that the Great Khan had\r\n  departed this life; and this caused them to give up all hope of\r\n  returning to those parts.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—This Princess of Manzi, or Southern China, is mentioned\r\n  only in the Geog. Text and in the Crusca, which is based thereon. I\r\n  find no notice of her among the wives of Gházán or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  On the fall of the capital of the Sung Dynasty—the Kinsay of\r\n  Polo—in 1276, the Princesses of that Imperial family were sent to\r\n  Peking, and were graciously treated by Kublai’s favourite Queen,\r\n  the Lady Jamui. This young lady was, no doubt, one of those captive\r\n  princesses who had been brought up at the Court of Khánbálik. (See\r\n  _De Mailla_, IX. 376, and _infra_ Bk. II. ch. lxv., note 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BOOK FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACCOUNT OF REGIONS VISITED OR HEARD OF ON THE JOURNEY FROM THE LESSER\r\n    ARMENIA TO THE COURT OF THE GREAT KAAN AT CHANDU.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aias, the LAIAS of POLO, from an Admiralty Chart.\r\n\r\n  Position of _Diláwar_, the supposed Site of POLO’S DILAVAR\r\n\r\n  Lit. Frauenfelder, Palermo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n        HERE THE BOOK BEGINS; AND FIRST IT SPEAKS OF THE LESSER\r\n                               HERMENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two Hermenias, the Greater and the Less. The Lesser\r\nHermenia is governed by a certain King, who maintains a just rule in\r\nhis dominions, but is himself subject to the Tartar.{1} The country\r\ncontains numerous towns and villages,{2} and has everything in plenty;\r\nmoreover, it is a great country for sport in the chase of all manner\r\nof beasts and birds. It is, however, by no means a healthy region,\r\nbut grievously the reverse.{3} In days of old the nobles there were\r\nvaliant men, and did doughty deeds of arms; but nowadays they are\r\npoor creatures, and good at nought, unless it be at boozing; they are\r\ngreat at that. Howbeit, they have a city upon the sea, which is called\r\nLAYAS, at which there is a great trade. For you must know that all\r\nthe spicery, and the cloths of silk and gold, and the other valuable\r\nwares that come from the interior, are brought to that city. And the\r\nmerchants of Venice and Genoa, and other countries, come thither to\r\nsell their goods, and to buy what they lack. And whatsoever persons\r\nwould travel to the interior (of the East), merchants or others, they\r\ntake their way by this city of Layas.{4}\r\n\r\nHaving now told you about the Lesser Hermenia, we shall next tell you\r\nabout Turcomania.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The _Petite Hermenie_ of the Middle Ages was quite distinct\r\n  from the Armenia Minor of the ancient geographers, which name the\r\n  latter applied to the western portion of Armenia, west of the\r\n  Euphrates, and immediately north of Cappadocia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Coin of King Hetum and his Queen Isabel.]\r\n\r\n  But when the old Armenian monarchy was broken up (1079–80), Rupen,\r\n  a kinsman of the Bagratid Kings, with many of his countrymen, took\r\n  refuge in the Taurus. His first descendants ruled as _barons_, a\r\n  title adopted apparently from the Crusaders, but still preserved in\r\n  Armenia. Leon, the great-great-grandson of Rupen, was consecrated\r\n  King under the supremacy of the Pope and the Western Empire in\r\n  1198. The kingdom was at its zenith under Hetum or Hayton I.,\r\n  husband of Leon’s daughter Isabel (1224–1269); he was, however,\r\n  prudent enough to make an early submission to the Mongols, and\r\n  remained ever staunch to them, which brought his territory\r\n  constantly under the flail of Egypt. It included at one time all\r\n  Cilicia, with many cities of Syria and the ancient Armenia Minor,\r\n  of Isauria and Cappadocia. The male line of Rupen becoming extinct\r\n  in 1342, the kingdom passed to John de Lusignan, of the royal\r\n  house of Cyprus, and in 1375 it was put an end to by the Sultan of\r\n  Egypt. Leon VI., the ex-king, into whose mouth Froissart puts some\r\n  extraordinary geography, had a pension of 1000_l._ a year granted\r\n  him by our Richard II., and died at Paris in 1398.\r\n\r\n  The chief remaining vestige of this little monarchy is the\r\n  continued existence of a _Catholicos_ of part of the Armenian\r\n  Church at Sis, which was the royal residence. Some Armenian\r\n  communities still remain both in hills and plains; and the former,\r\n  the more independent and industrious, still speak a corrupt\r\n  Armenian.\r\n\r\n  Polo’s contemporary, Marino Sanuto, compares the kingdom of the\r\n  Pope’s faithful Armenians to one between the teeth of four fierce\r\n  beasts, the _Lion_ Tartar, the _Panther_ Soldan, the Turkish\r\n  _Wolf_, the Corsair _Serpent_.\r\n\r\n  (_Dulaurier_, in _J. As._ sér. V. tom. xvii.; _St. Martin, Arm._;\r\n  _Mar. San._ p. 32; _Froissart_, Bk. II. ch. xxii. _seqq._;\r\n  _Langlois, V. en Cilicie_, 1861, p. 19.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Maintes villes et maint chasteaux_.” This is a constantly\r\n  recurring phrase, and I have generally translated it as here,\r\n  believing _chasteaux (castelli)_ to be used in the frequent old\r\n  Italian sense of a _walled_ village or small walled town, or like\r\n  the Eastern _Kala’_, applied in Khorasan “to everything—town,\r\n  village, or private residence—surrounded by a wall of earth.”\r\n  (_Ferrier_, p. 292; see also _A. Conolly_, I. p. 211.) Martini,\r\n  in his _Atlas Sinensis_, uses “_Urbes_, _oppida_, castella,” to\r\n  indicate the three classes of Chinese administrative cities.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—“_Enferme durement_.” So Marino Sanuto objects to Lesser\r\n  Armenia as a place of debarkation for a crusade “_quia terra est\r\n  infirma_.” Langlois, speaking of the Cilician plain: “In this region\r\n  once so fair, now covered with swamps and brambles, fever decimates\r\n  a population which is yearly diminishing, has nothing to oppose\r\n  to the scourge but incurable apathy, and will end by disappearing\r\n  altogether,” etc. (_Voyage_, p. 65.) Cilician Armenia retains its\r\n  reputation for sport, and is much frequented by our naval officers\r\n  for that object. Ayas is noted for the extraordinary abundance of\r\n  turtles.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The phrase twice used in this passage for the _Interior_\r\n  is _Fra terre_, an Italianism (_Fra terra_, or, as it stands in the\r\n  Geog. Latin, “_infra terram Orientis_”), which, however, Murray\r\n  and Pauthier have read as an allusion to the _Euphrates_, an error\r\n  based apparently on a marginal gloss in the published edition of\r\n  the Soc. de Géographie. It is true that the province of Comagene\r\n  under the Greek Empire got the name of _Euphratesia_, or in Arabic\r\n  _Furátíyah_, but that was not in question here. The great trade\r\n  of Ayas was with Tabriz, _viâ_ Sivas, Erzingan, and Erzrum, as we\r\n  see in Pegolotti. Elsewhere, too, in Polo we find the phrase _fra\r\n  terre_ used, where Euphrates could possibly have no concern, as in\r\n  relation to India and Oman. (See Bk. III. chs. xxix. and xxxviii.,\r\n  and notes in each case.)\r\n\r\n  With regard to the phrase _spicery_ here and elsewhere, it should\r\n  be noted that the Italian _spezerie_ included a vast deal more than\r\n  ginger and other things “hot i’ the mouth.” In one of Pegolotti’s\r\n  lists of _spezerie_ we find drugs, dye-stuffs, metals, wax, cotton,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF TURCOMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Turcomania there are three classes of people. First, there are the\r\nTurcomans; these are worshippers of Mahommet, a rude people with an\r\nuncouth language of their own.{1} They dwell among mountains and downs\r\nwhere they find good pasture, for their occupation is cattle-keeping.\r\nExcellent horses, known as _Turquans_, are reared in their country, and\r\nalso very valuable mules. The other two classes are the Armenians and\r\nthe Greeks, who live mixt with the former in the towns and villages,\r\noccupying themselves with trade and handicrafts. They weave the finest\r\nand handsomest carpets in the world, and also a great quantity of fine\r\nand rich silks of cramoisy and other colours, and plenty of other\r\nstuffs. Their chief cities are CONIA, SAVAST [where the glorious Messer\r\nSaint Blaise suffered martyrdom], and CASARIA, besides many other towns\r\nand bishops’ sees, of which we shall not speak at present, for it would\r\nbe too long a matter. These people are subject to the Tartar of the\r\nLevant as their Suzerain.{2} We will now leave this province, and speak\r\nof the Greater Armenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Ricold of Montecroce, a contemporary of Polo, calls the\r\n  Turkmans _homines bestiales_. In our day Ainsworth notes of a\r\n  Turkman village: “The dogs were very ferocious; ... the people\r\n  only a little better.” (_J. R. G. S._ X. 292.) The ill report\r\n  of the people of this region did not begin with the Turkmans,\r\n  for the Emperor Constantine Porphyrog. quotes a Greek proverb to\r\n  the disparagement of the three _kappas_, Cappadocia, Crete, and\r\n  Cilicia. (In _Banduri_, I. 6.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—In Turcomania Marco perhaps embraces a great part of Asia\r\n  Minor, but he especially means the territory of the decaying\r\n  Seljukian monarchy, usually then called by Asiatics _Rúm_, as\r\n  the Ottoman Empire is now, and the capital of which was Iconium,\r\n  KUNIYAH, the Conia of the text, and Coyne of Joinville. Ibn\r\n  Batuta calls the whole country Turkey (_Al-Turkíyah_), and the\r\n  people _Turkmán_; exactly likewise does Ricold (_Thurchia_ and\r\n  _Thurchimanni_). Hayton’s account of the various classes of\r\n  inhabitants is quite the same in substance as Polo’s. [The Turkmans\r\n  emigrated from Turkestan to Asia Minor before the arrival of the\r\n  Seljukid Turks. “Their villages,” says Cuinet, _Turquie d’Asie_,\r\n  II. p. 767, “are distinguished by the peculiarity of the houses\r\n  being built of sun-baked bricks, whereas it is the general habit\r\n  in the country to build them of earth or a kind of plaster, called\r\n  _djès_”—H. C.] The migratory and pastoral Turkmans still exist in\r\n  this region, but the Kurds of like habits have taken their place to\r\n  a large extent. The fine carpets and silk fabrics appear to be no\r\n  longer produced here, any more than the excellent horses of which\r\n  Polo speaks, which must have been the remains of the famous old\r\n  breed of Cappadocia. [It appears, however (Vital Cuinet’s _Turquie\r\n  d’Asie_, I. p. 224), that fine carpets are still manufactured at\r\n  Koniah, also a kind of striped cotton cloth, called _Aladja_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  A grant of privileges to the Genoese by Leon II., King of Lesser\r\n  Armenia, dated 23rd December, 1288, alludes to the export of horses\r\n  and mules, etc., from Ayas, and specifies the duties upon them.\r\n  The horses now of repute in Asia as Turkman come from the east of\r\n  the Caspian. And Asia Minor generally, once the mother of so many\r\n  breeds of high repute, is now poorer in horses than any province of\r\n  the Ottoman empire.\r\n\r\n  (_Pereg. Quat._ p. 114; _I. B._ II. 255 _seqq._; _Hayton_, ch.\r\n  xiii.; _Liber Jurium Reip. Januensis_, II. 184; _Tchihatcheff, As.\r\n  Min._, 2ᵈᵉ partie, 631.)\r\n\r\n  [The Seljukian Sultanate of Iconium or Rúm, was founded at the\r\n  expense of the Byzantines by Suleiman (1074–1081); the last three\r\n  sovereigns of the dynasty contemporaneous with Marco Polo are\r\n  Ghiath ed-din Kaïkhosru III. (1267–1283), Ghiath ed-din Mas’ud\r\n  II. (1283–1294), Ala ed-din Kaïkobad III. (1294–1308), when this\r\n  kingdom was destroyed by the Mongols of Persia. Privileges had been\r\n  granted to Venice by Ghiath ed-din Kaïkhosru I. (✛1211), and his\r\n  sons Izz ed-din Kaikaus (1211–1220), and Ala ed-din Kaïkobad I.\r\n  (1220–1237); the diploma of 1220 is unfortunately the only one of\r\n  the three known to be preserved. (Cf. Heyd, I. p. 302.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Though the authors quoted above seem to make no distinction between\r\n  Turks and Turkmans, that which we still understand does appear\r\n  to have been made in the 12th century: “That there may be some\r\n  distinction, at least in name, between those who made themselves a\r\n  king, and thus achieved such glory, and those who still abide in\r\n  their primitive barbarism and adhere to their old way of life, the\r\n  former are nowadays termed _Turks_, the latter by their old name of\r\n  _Turkomans_.” (_William of Tyre_, i. 7.)\r\n\r\n  Casaria is KAISARÍYA, the ancient Caesareia of Cappadocia, close to\r\n  the foot of the great Mount Argaeus. _Savast_ is the Armenian form\r\n  (_Sevasd_) of Sebaste, the modern SIVAS. The three cities, Iconium,\r\n  Caesareia, and Sebaste, were metropolitan sees under the Catholicos\r\n  of Sis.\r\n\r\n  [The ruins of Sebaste are situated at about 6 miles to the east of\r\n  modern Sivas, near the village of Gavraz, on the _Kizil Irmak_.\r\n  In the 11th century, the King of Armenia, Senecherim, made his\r\n  capital of Sebaste. It belonged after to the Seljukid Turks, and\r\n  was conquered in 1397 by Bayezid Ilderim with Tokat, Castambol and\r\n  Sinope. (Cf. _Vital Cuinet_.)\r\n\r\n  One of the oldest churches in Sivas is St. George (_Sourp-Kévork_),\r\n  occupied by the Greeks, but claimed by the Armenians; it is\r\n  situated near the centre of the town, in what is called the\r\n  “Black Earth,” the spot where Timur is said to have massacred the\r\n  garrison. A few steps north of St. George is the Church of St.\r\n  Blasius, occupied by the Roman Catholic Armenians. The tomb of\r\n  St. Blasius, however, is shown in another part of the town, near\r\n  the citadel mount, and the ruins of a very beautiful Seljukian\r\n  Medresseh. (From a MS. Note by Sir H. Yule. The information had\r\n  been supplied by the American Missionaries to General Sir C.\r\n  Wilson, and forwarded by him to Sir H. Yule.)\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that at the time of the Seljuk Turks, there\r\n  were four Medressehs at Sivas, and a university as famous as that\r\n  of Amassia. Children to the number of 1000, each a bearer of a copy\r\n  of the Koran, were crushed to death under the feet of the horses\r\n  of Timur, and buried in the “Black Earth”; the garrison of 4000\r\n  soldiers were buried alive.\r\n\r\n  St. Blasius, Bishop of Sebaste, was martyred in 316 by order of\r\n  Agricola, Governor of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia, during the\r\n  reign of Licinius. His feast is celebrated by the Latin Church\r\n  on the 3rd of February, and by the Greek Church on the 11th of\r\n  February. He is the patron of the Republic of Ragusa in Dalmatia,\r\n  and in France of wool-carders.\r\n\r\n  At the village of Hullukluk, near Sivas, was born in 1676 Mekhitar,\r\n  founder of the well-known Armenian Order, which has convents at\r\n  Venice, Vienna, and Trieste.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                 DESCRIPTION OF THE GREATER HERMENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a great country. It begins at a city called ARZINGA, at which\r\nthey weave the best buckrams in the world. It possesses also the best\r\nbaths from natural springs that are anywhere to be found.{1} The people\r\nof the country are Armenians, and are subject to the Tartar. There are\r\nmany towns and villages in the country, but the noblest of their cities\r\nis Arzinga, which is the See of an Archbishop, and then ARZIRON and\r\nARZIZI.{2}\r\n\r\nThe country is indeed a passing great one, and in the summer it is\r\nfrequented by the whole host of the Tartars of the Levant, because it\r\nthen furnishes them with such excellent pasture for their cattle. But\r\nin winter the cold is past all bounds, so in that season they quit\r\nthis country and go to a warmer region, where they find other good\r\npastures. [At a castle called PAIPURTH, that you pass in going from\r\nTrebizond to Tauris, there is a very good silver mine.{3}]\r\n\r\nAnd you must know that it is in this country of Armenia that the Ark of\r\nNoah exists on the top of a certain great mountain [on the summit of\r\nwhich snow is so constant that no one can ascend;{4} for the snow never\r\nmelts, and is constantly added to by new falls. Below, however, the\r\nsnow does melt, and runs down, producing such rich and abundant herbage\r\nthat in summer cattle are sent to pasture from a long way round about,\r\nand it never fails them. The melting snow also causes a great amount of\r\nmud on the mountain].\r\n\r\nThe country is bounded on the south by a kingdom called Mosul, the\r\npeople of which are Jacobite and Nestorian Christians, of whom I shall\r\nhave more to tell you presently. On the north it is bounded by the\r\nLand of the Georgians, of whom also I shall speak. On the confines\r\ntowards Georgiania there is a fountain from which oil springs in great\r\nabundance, insomuch that a hundred shiploads might be taken from it at\r\none time. This oil is not good to use with food, but ’tis good to burn,\r\nand is also used to anoint camels that have the mange. People come from\r\nvast distances to fetch it, for in all the countries round about they\r\nhave no other oil.{5}\r\n\r\nNow, having done with Great Armenia, we will tell you of Georgiania.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[ERZINJAN, Erzinga, or Eriza, in the vilayet of Erzrum,\r\n  was rebuilt in 1784, after having been destroyed by an earthquake.\r\n  “Arzendjan,” says Ibn Batuta, II. p. 294, “is in possession of\r\n  well-established markets; there are manufactured fine stuffs, which\r\n  are called after its name.” It was at Erzinjan that was fought in\r\n  1244 the great battle, which placed the Seljuk Turks under the\r\n  dependency of the Mongol Khans.—H. C.] I do not find mention of its\r\n  hot springs by modern travellers, but Lazari says Armenians assured\r\n  him of their existence. There are plenty of others in Polo’s route\r\n  through the country, as at Ilija, close to Erzrum, and at Hássan\r\n  Kalá.\r\n\r\n  The _Buckrams_ of Arzinga are mentioned both by Pegolotti (_circa_\r\n  1340) and by Giov. d’Uzzano (1442). But what were they?\r\n\r\n  Buckram in the modern sense is a coarse open texture of cotton\r\n  or hemp, loaded with gum, and used to stiffen certain articles\r\n  of dress. But this was certainly _not_ the mediæval sense. Nor\r\n  is it easy to bring the mediæval uses of the term under a single\r\n  explanation. Indeed Mr. Marsh suggests that probably two different\r\n  words have coalesced. Fr.-Michel says that _Bouqueran_ was _at\r\n  first_ applied to a light cotton stuff of the nature of muslin,\r\n  and _afterwards_ to linen, but I do not see that he makes out\r\n  this history of the application. Douet d’Arcq, in his _Comptes de\r\n  l’Argenterie_, etc., explains the word simply in the modern sense,\r\n  but there seems nothing in his text to bear this out.\r\n\r\n  A quotation in Raynouard’s Romance Dictionary has “_Vestirs de\r\n  polpra e de_ bisso _que est_ bocaran,” where Raynouard renders\r\n  _bisso_ as _lin_; a quotation in Ducange also makes Buckram the\r\n  equivalent of Bissus; and Michel quotes from an inventory of 1365,\r\n  “_unam culcitram pinctam_ (qu. punctam?) _albam factam_ de bisso\r\n  _aliter_ boquerant.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Marsh again produces quotations, in which the word is used as\r\n  a proverbial example of _whiteness_, and inclines to think that it\r\n  was a bleached cloth with a lustrous surface.\r\n\r\n  It certainly was not _necessarily_ linen. Giovanni Villani, in\r\n  a passage which is curious in more ways than one, tells how the\r\n  citizens of Florence established races for their troops, and, among\r\n  other prizes, was one which consisted of a _Bucherame di bambagine_\r\n  (of cotton). Polo, near the end of the Book (Bk. III. ch. xxxiv.),\r\n  speaking of Abyssinia, says, according to Pauthier’s text: “_Et si\r\n  y fait on moult beaux_ bouquerans et autres draps de coton.” The G.\r\n  T. is, indeed, more ambiguous: “_Il hi se font maint biaus dras_\r\n  banbacin e bocaran” (cotton _and_ buckram). When, however, he uses\r\n  the same expression with reference to the delicate stuffs woven\r\n  on the coast of Telingana, there can be no doubt that a cotton\r\n  texture is meant, and apparently a fine muslin. (See Bk. III. ch.\r\n  xviii.) Buckram is _generally_ named as an article of price, _chier\r\n  bouquerant_, _rice boquerans_, etc, but not always, for Polo in one\r\n  passage (Bk. II. ch. xlv.) seems to speak of it as the clothing of\r\n  the poor people of Eastern Tibet.\r\n\r\n  Plano Carpini says the tunics of the Tartars were either of buckram\r\n  (_bukeranum_), of _purpura_ (a texture, perhaps velvet), or of\r\n  _baudekin_, a cloth of gold (pp. 614–615). When the envoys of the\r\n  Old Man of the Mountain tried to bully St. Lewis, one had a case\r\n  of daggers to be offered in defiance, another a _bouqueran_ for a\r\n  winding sheet (_Joinville_, p. 136.)\r\n\r\n  In accounts of materials for the use of Anne Boleyn in the time\r\n  of her prosperity, _bokeram_ frequently appears for “lyning and\r\n  taynting” (?) gowns, lining sleeves, cloaks, a bed, etc., but it\r\n  can scarcely have been for mere stiffening, as the colour of the\r\n  buckram is generally specified as the same as that of the dress.\r\n\r\n  A number of passages seem to point to a _quilted_ material.\r\n  Boccaccio (Day viii. Novel 10) speaks of a quilt (_coltre_)\r\n  of the whitest buckram of Cyprus, and Uzzano enters buckram\r\n  quilts (_coltre di Bucherame_) in a list of _Linajuoli_, or\r\n  linen-draperies. Both his handbook and Pegolotti’s state repeatedly\r\n  that buckrams were sold by the piece or the half-score pieces—never\r\n  by measure. In one of Michel’s quotations (from _Baudouin de\r\n  Sebourc_) we have:\r\n\r\n      “Gaufer li fist premiers armer d’un auqueton\r\n       Qui fu de _bougherant_ et _plaine de bon coton_.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hewitt would appear to take the view that Buckram meant a\r\n  quilted material; for, quoting from a roll of purchases made\r\n  for the Court of Edward I., an entry for Ten Buckrams to make\r\n  sleeves of, he remarks, “The sleeves appear to have been of\r\n  _pourpointerie_,” _i.e._ quilting. (_Ancient Armour_, I. 240.)\r\n\r\n  This signification would embrace a large number of passages\r\n  in which the term is used, though certainly not all. It would\r\n  account for the mode or sale by the piece, and frequent use of the\r\n  expression _a_ buckram, for its habitual application to _coltre_\r\n  or counterpanes, its use in the _auqueton_ of Baudouin, and in the\r\n  jackets of Falstaff’s “men in buckram,” as well as its employment\r\n  in the frocks of the Mongols and Tibetans. The winter _chapkan_,\r\n  or long tunic, of Upper India, a form of dress which, I believe,\r\n  correctly represents that of the Mongol hosts, and is probably\r\n  derived from them, is almost universally of quilted cotton.[1] This\r\n  signification would also facilitate the transfer of meaning to\r\n  the substance now called buckram, for that is used as a _kind_ of\r\n  quilting.\r\n\r\n  The derivation of the word is very uncertain. Reiske says it is\r\n  Arabic, _Abu-Kairám_, “Pannus cum intextis figuris”; Wedgwood,\r\n  attaching the modern meaning, that it is from It., _bucherare_, to\r\n  pierce full of holes, which might be if _bucherare_ could be used\r\n  in the sense of _puntare_, or the French _piquer_; Marsh connects\r\n  it with the _bucking_ of linen; and D’Avezac thinks it was a stuff\r\n  that took its name from _Bokhara_. If the name be local, as so many\r\n  names of stuffs are, the French form rather suggests _Bulgaria_.\r\n  [Heyd, II. 703, says that Buckram (Bucherame) was principally\r\n  manufactured at Erzinjan (Armenia), Mush, and Mardin (Kurdistan),\r\n  Ispahan (Persia), and in India, etc. It was shipped to the west at\r\n  Constantinople, Satalia, Acre, and Famagusta; the name is derived\r\n  from Bokhara.—H.

Arzizi, ARJISH,\r\n  in the vilayet of Van, was destroyed in the middle of the 19th\r\n  century; it was situated on the road from Van to Erzrum. Arjish\r\n  Kalá was one of the ancient capitals of the Kingdom of Armenia; it\r\n  was conquered by Toghrul I., who made it his residence. (Cf. Vital\r\n  Cuinet, _Turquie d’Asie_, II. p. 710).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Arjish is the ancient _Arsissa_, which gave the Lake Van one of its\r\n  names. It is now little more than a decayed castle, with a village\r\n  inside.\r\n\r\n  Notices of Kuniyah, Kaisariya, Sivas, Arzan-ar-Rumi, Arzangan,\r\n  and Arjish, will be found in Polo’s contemporary Abulfeda. (See\r\n  _Büsching_, IV. 303–311.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Paipurth, or Baiburt, on the high road between Trebizond\r\n  and Erzrum, was, according to Neumann, an Armenian fortress in the\r\n  first century, and, according to Ritter, the castle _Baiberdon_\r\n  was fortified by Justinian. It stands on a peninsular hill,\r\n  encircled by the windings of the R. Charok. [According to Ramusio’s\r\n  version Baiburt was the third relay from Trebizund to Tauris, and\r\n  travellers on their way from one of these cities to the other\r\n  passed under this stronghold.—H. C.] The Russians, in retiring\r\n  from it in 1829, blew up the greater part of the defences. The\r\n  nearest silver mines of which we find modern notice, are those of\r\n  _Gumish-Khánah_ (“Silverhouse”), about 35 miles N.W. of Baiburt;\r\n  they are more correctly mines of lead rich in silver, and were once\r\n  largely worked. But the _Masálak-al-absár_ (14th century), besides\r\n  these, speaks of two others in the same province, one of which was\r\n  near _Bajert_. This Quatremère reasonably would read _Babert_ or\r\n  Baiburt. (_Not. et Extraits_, XIII. i. 337; _Texier_, _Arménie_, I.\r\n  59.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Josephus alludes to the belief that Noah’s Ark still\r\n  existed, and that pieces of the pitch were used as amulets. (_Ant._\r\n  I. 3. 6.)\r\n\r\n  Ararat (16,953 feet) was ascended, first by Prof. Parrot, September\r\n  1829; by Spasski Aotonomoff, August 1834; by Behrens, 1835; by\r\n  Abich, 1845; by Seymour in 1848; by Khodzko, Khanikoff, and others,\r\n  for trigonometrical and other scientific purposes, in August 1850.\r\n  It is characteristic of the account from which I take these notes\r\n  (_Longrimoff_, in _Bull. Soc. Géog. Paris_, sér. IV. tom. i. p.\r\n  54), that whilst the writer’s countrymen, Spasski and Behrens, were\r\n  “moved by a noble curiosity,” the Englishman is only admitted to\r\n  have “gratified a tourist’s whim”!\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Though Mr. Khanikoff points out that springs of naphtha are\r\n  abundant in the vicinity of Tiflis, the mention of _ship-loads_\r\n  (in Ramusio indeed altered, but probably by the Editor, to\r\n  _camel-loads_), and the vast quantities spoken of, point to the\r\n  naphtha-wells of the Baku Peninsula on the Caspian. Ricold speaks\r\n  of their supplying the whole country as far as Baghdad, and\r\n  Barbaro alludes to the practice of anointing camels with the oil.\r\n  The quantity collected from the springs about Baku was in 1819\r\n  estimated at 241,000 _poods_ (nearly 4000 tons), the greater part\r\n  of which went to Persia. (_Pereg. Quat._ p. 122; _Ramusio_, II.\r\n  109; _El. de Laprim._ 276; _V. du Chev.

The people are very handsome, capital archers, and most\r\nvaliant soldiers. They are Christians of the Greek Rite, and have a\r\nfashion of wearing their hair cropped, like Churchmen.{2}\r\n\r\nThis is the country beyond which Alexander could not pass when he\r\nwished to penetrate to the region of the Ponent, because that the\r\ndefile was so narrow and perilous, the sea lying on the one hand,\r\nand on the other lofty mountains impassable to horsemen. The strait\r\nextends like this for four leagues, and a handful of people might hold\r\nit against all the world. Alexander caused a very strong tower to be\r\nbuilt there, to prevent the people beyond from passing to attack him,\r\nand this got the name of the IRON GATE. This is the place that the Book\r\nof Alexander speaks of, when it tells us how he shut up the Tartars\r\nbetween two mountains; not that they were really Tartars, however, for\r\nthere were no Tartars in those days, but they consisted of a race of\r\npeople called COMANIANS and many besides.{3}\r\n\r\n[In this province all the forests are of box-wood.{4}] There are\r\nnumerous towns and villages, and silk is produced in great abundance.\r\nThey also weave cloths of gold, and all kinds of very fine silk stuffs.\r\nThe country produces the best goshawks in the world [which are called\r\n_Avigi_].{5} It has indeed no lack of anything, and the people live\r\nby trade and handicrafts. ’Tis a very mountainous region, and full of\r\nstrait defiles and of fortresses, insomuch that the Tartars have never\r\nbeen able to subdue it out and out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mediæval Georgian Fortress, from a drawing dated 1634.\r\n  “La provence est toute plene de grant montagne et d’estroit pas et de\r\n  fort.”]\r\n\r\nThere is in this country a certain Convent of Nuns called St.\r\nLeonard’s, about which I have to tell you a very wonderful\r\ncircumstance. Near the church in question there is a great lake at the\r\nfoot of a mountain, and in this lake are found no fish, great or small,\r\nthroughout the year till Lent come. On the first day of Lent they find\r\nin it the finest fish in the world, and great store too thereof; and\r\nthese continue to be found till Easter Eve. After that they are found\r\nno more till Lent come round again; and so ’tis every year. ’Tis really\r\na passing great miracle!{6}\r\n\r\nThat sea whereof I spoke as coming so near the mountains is called\r\nthe Sea of GHEL or GHELAN, and extends about 700 miles.{7} It is\r\ntwelve days’ journey distant from any other sea, and into it flows\r\nthe great River Euphrates and many others, whilst it is surrounded by\r\nmountains. Of late the merchants of Genoa have begun to navigate this\r\nsea, carrying ships across and launching them thereon. It is from the\r\ncountry on this sea also that the silk called _Ghellé_ is brought.{8}\r\n[The said sea produces quantities of fish, especially sturgeon, at the\r\nriver-mouths salmon, and other big kinds of fish.]{9}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Ramusio has: “One part of the said province is subject to\r\n  the Tartar, and the other part, owing to its fortresses, remains\r\n  subject to the King David.” We give an illustration of one of these\r\n  mediæval Georgian fortresses, from a curious collection of MS.\r\n  notices and drawings of Georgian subjects in the Municipal Library\r\n  at Palermo, executed by a certain P. Cristoforo di Castelli of that\r\n  city, who was a Theatine missionary in Georgia, in the first half\r\n  of the 17th century.\r\n\r\n  The G. T. says the King was _always_ called David. The Georgian\r\n  Kings of the family of Bagratidae claimed descent from King\r\n  David through a prince Shampath, said to have been sent north by\r\n  Nebuchadnezzar; a descent which was usually asserted in their\r\n  public documents. Timur in his Institutes mentions a suit of\r\n  armour given him by the King of Georgia as forged by the hand of\r\n  the Psalmist King. David is a very frequent name in their royal\r\n  lists. [The dynasty of the Bagratidae, which was founded in 786\r\n  by Ashod, and lasted until the annexation of Georgia by Russia on\r\n  the 18th January, 1801, had nine reigning princes named David.\r\n  During the second half of the 12th century the princes were: Dawith\r\n  (David) IV. Narin (1247–1259), Dawith V. (1243–1272), Dimitri II.\r\n  Thawdadebuli (1272–1289), Wakhtang II. (1289–1292), Dawith VI.\r\n  (1292–1308).—H. C.] There were two princes of that name, David,\r\n  who shared Georgia between them under the decision of the Great\r\n  Kaan in 1246, and one of them, who survived to 1269, is probably\r\n  meant here. The name of David was borne by the last titular King of\r\n  Georgia, who ceded his rights to Russia in 1801. It is probable,\r\n  however, as Marsden has suggested, that the statement about\r\n  the King _always_ being called David arose in part out of some\r\n  confusion with the title of _Dadian_, which, according to Chardin\r\n  (and also to P. di Castelli), was always assumed by the Princes of\r\n  Mingrelia, or Colchis as the latter calls it. Chardin refers this\r\n  title to the Persian _Dád_, “equity.” To a portrait of “Alexander,\r\n  King of Iberia,” or Georgia Proper, Castelli attaches the following\r\n  inscription, giving apparently his official style: “With the\r\n  sceptre of David, Crowned by Heaven, First King of the Orient and\r\n  of the World, King of Israel,” adding, “They say that he has on his\r\n  shoulder a small mark of a cross, ‘_Factus est principatus super\r\n  humerum ejus_,’ and they add that he has all his ribs in one piece,\r\n  and not divided.” In another place he notes that when attending the\r\n  King in illness his curiosity moved him strongly to ask if these\r\n  things were true, but he thought better of it! (_Khanikoff; Jour.\r\n  As._ IX. 370, XI. 291, etc.; _Tim. Instit._ p. 143; _Castelli_ MSS.)\r\n\r\n  [A descendant of these Princes was in St. Petersburg about\r\n  1870. He wore the Russian uniform, and bore the title of Prince\r\n  Bagration-Mukransky.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This fashion of tonsure is mentioned by Barbaro and\r\n  Chardin. The latter speaks strongly of the beauty of both sexes, as\r\n  does Della Valle, and most modern travellers concur.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This refers to the Pass of Derbend, apparently the Sarmatic\r\n  Gates of Ptolemy, and _Claustra Caspiorum_ of Tacitus, known to\r\n  the Arab geographers as the “Gate of Gates” (_Báb-ul-abwáb_), but\r\n  which is still called in Turkish _Demír-Kápi_, or the Iron Gate,\r\n  and to the ancient Wall that runs from the Castle of Derbend along\r\n  the ridges of Caucasus, called in the East _Sadd-i-Iskandar_, the\r\n  Rampart of Alexander. Bayer thinks the wall was probably built\r\n  originally by one of the Antiochi, and renewed by the Sassanian\r\n  Kobad or his son Naoshirwan. It is ascribed to the latter by\r\n  Abulfeda; and according to Klaproth’s extracts from the _Derbend\r\n  Námah_, Naoshirwan completed the fortress of Derbend in A.D. 542,\r\n  whilst he and his father together had erected 360 towers upon\r\n  the Caucasian Wall which extended to the Gate of the Alans (_i.e._\r\n  the Pass of Dariel). Mas’udi says that the wall extended for\r\n  40 parasangs over the steepest summits and deepest gorges. The\r\n  Russians must have gained some knowledge as to the actual existence\r\n  and extent of the remains of this great work, but I have not been\r\n  able to meet with any modern information of a very precise kind.\r\n  According to a quotation from _Reinegg’s Kaukasus_ (I. 120, a work\r\n  which I have not been able to consult), the remains of defences\r\n  can be traced for many miles, and are in some places as much as\r\n  120 feet high. M. Moynet indeed, in the _Tour du Monde_ (I. 122),\r\n  states that he traced the wall to a distance of 27 versts (18\r\n  miles) from Derbend, but unfortunately, instead of describing\r\n  remains of such high interest from his own observation, he cites a\r\n  description written by Alex. Dumas, which he says is quite accurate.\r\n\r\n  [“To the west of Narin-Kaleh, a fortress which from the top of\r\n  a promontory rises above the city, the wall, strengthened from\r\n  distance to distance by large towers, follows the ridge of the\r\n  mountains, descends into the ravines, and ascends the slopes to\r\n  take root on some remote peak. If the natives were to be believed,\r\n  this wall, which, however, no longer has any strategetical\r\n  importance, had formerly its towers bristling upon the Caucasus\r\n  chain from one sea to another; at least, this rampart did protect\r\n  all the plains at the foot of the eastern Caucasus, since vestiges\r\n  were found up to 30 kilometres from Derbend.” (_Reclus, Asie\r\n  russe_, p. 160.) It has belonged to Russia since 1813. The first\r\n  European traveller who mentions it is Benjamin of Tudela.\r\n\r\n  Bretschneider (II. p. 117) observes: “Yule complains that he was\r\n  not able to find any modern information regarding the famous\r\n  Caucasian Wall which begins at Derbend. I may therefore observe\r\n  that interesting details on the subject are found in Legkobytov’s\r\n  _Survey of the Russian Dominions beyond the Caucasus_ (in Russian),\r\n  1836, vol. iv. pp. 158–161, and in Dubois de Montpéreux’s _Voyage\r\n  autour du Caucase_, 1840, vol. iv. pp. 291–298, from which I shall\r\n  give here an abstract.”\r\n\r\n  (He then proceeds to give an abstract, of which the following is a\r\n  part:)\r\n\r\n  “The famous _Dagh bary_ (mountain wall) now begins at the village\r\n  of _Djelgan_, 4 versts south-west of Derbend, but we know that\r\n  as late as the beginning of the last century it could be traced\r\n  down to the southern gate of the city. This ancient wall then\r\n  stretches westward to the high mountains of Tabasseran (it seems\r\n  the Tabarestan of Mas’udi).... Dubois de Montpéreux enumerates the\r\n  following sites of remains of the wall:—In the famous defile of\r\n  _Dariel_, north-east of Kazbek. In the valley of the _Assai_ river,\r\n  near Wapila, about 35 versts north-east of Dariel. In the valley\r\n  of the Kizil river, about 15 versts north-west of Kazbek. Farther\r\n  west, in the valley of the _Fiag_ or _Pog_ river, between _Lacz_\r\n  and _Khilak_. From this place farther west about 25 versts, in\r\n  the valley of the _Arredon_ river, in the district of _Valaghir_.\r\n  Finally, the westernmost section of the Caucasian Wall has been\r\n  preserved, which was evidently intended to shut up the maritime\r\n  defile of _Gagry_, on the Black Sea.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  There is another wall claiming the title of _Sadd-i-Iskandar_ at\r\n  the S.E. angle of the Caspian. This has been particularly spoken of\r\n  by Vámbéry, who followed its traces from S.W. to N.E. for upwards\r\n  of 40 miles. (See his _Travels in C. Asia_, 54 _seqq._, and _Julius\r\n  Braun_ in the _Ausland_, No. 22, of 1869.)\r\n\r\n  Yule (II. pp. 537–538) says, “To the same friendly correspondent\r\n  [Professor Braun] I owe the following additional particulars on\r\n  this interesting subject, extracted from _Eichwald, Periplus des\r\n  Kasp. M._ I. 128.\r\n\r\n  “‘At the point on the mountain, at the extremity of the fortress\r\n  (of Derbend), where the double wall terminates, there begins a\r\n  single wall constructed in the same style, only this no longer\r\n  runs in a straight line, but accommodates itself to the contour of\r\n  the hill, turning now to the north and now to the south. At first\r\n  it is quite destroyed, and showed the most scanty vestiges, a few\r\n  small heaps of stones or traces of towers, but all extending in\r\n  a general bearing from east to west.... It is not till you get 4\r\n  versts from Derbend, in traversing the mountains, that you come\r\n  upon a continuous wall. Thenceforward you can follow it over the\r\n  successive ridges ... and through several villages chiefly occupied\r\n  by the Tartar hill-people. The wall ... makes many windings, and\r\n  every ¾ verst it exhibits substantial towers like those of the\r\n  city-wall, crested with loop-holes. Some of these are still in\r\n  tolerably good condition; others have fallen, and with the wall\r\n  itself have left but slight vestiges.’\r\n\r\n  “Eichwald altogether followed it up about 18 versts (12 miles) not\r\n  venturing to proceed further. In later days this cannot have been\r\n  difficult, but my kind correspondent had not been able to lay his\r\n  hand on information.\r\n\r\n  “A letter from Mr. Eugene Schuyler communicates some notes\r\n  regarding inscriptions that have been found at and near Derbend,\r\n  embracing Cufic of A.D. 465, Pehlvi, and even Cuneiform. Alluding\r\n  to the fact that the other _Iron-gate_, south of Shahrsabz, was\r\n  called also _Kalugah_, or _Kohlugah_ he adds: ‘I don’t know what\r\n  that means, nor do I know if the Russian Kaluga, south-west of\r\n  Moscow, has anything to do with it, but I am told there is a\r\n  Russian popular song, of which two lines run:\r\n\r\n      ‘“Ah Derbend, Derbend Kaluga,\r\n        Derbend my little Treasure!”’\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: View of Derbend.\r\n\r\n    “=Alexandre ne poit paser quand il vost aler au Ponent ... car de\r\n    l’un les est la mer, et de l’autre est gran montagne que ne se\r\n    poent cavaucher. La vie est mout estroit entre la montagne et la\r\n    mer.=”]\r\n\r\n  “I may observe that I have seen it lately pointed out that\r\n  _Koluga_ is a Mongol word signifying a _barrier_; and I see that\r\n  Timkowski (I. 288) gives the same explanation of _Kalgan_, the name\r\n  applied by Mongols and Russians to the gate in the Great Wall,\r\n  called Chang-kia-Kau by the Chinese, leading to Kiakhta.”\r\n\r\n  The story alluded to by Polo is found in the mediæval romances\r\n  of Alexander, and in the Pseudo-Callisthenes on which they are\r\n  founded. The hero chases a number of impure cannibal nations within\r\n  a mountain barrier, and prays that they may be shut up therein. The\r\n  mountains draw together within a few cubits, and Alexander then\r\n  builds up the gorge and closes it with gates of brass or iron.\r\n  There were in all twenty-two nations with their kings, and the\r\n  names of the nations were Gōth, Magōth, Anugi, Egēs, Exenach, etc.\r\n  Godfrey of Viterbo speaks of them in his rhyming verses:—\r\n\r\n        “Finibus Indorum species fuit una virorum;\r\n      Goth erat atque Magoth dictum cognomen eorum\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n      Narrat Esias, Isidorus et Apocalypsis,\r\n      Tangit et in titulis Magna Sibylla suis.\r\n      Patribus ipsorum tumulus fuit venter eorum,” etc.\r\n\r\n  Among the questions that the Jews are said to have put, in order\r\n  to test Mahommed’s prophetic character, was one series: “Who are\r\n  Gog and Magog? Where do they dwell? What sort of rampart did\r\n  Zu’lḳarnain build between them and men?” And in the Koran we find\r\n  (ch. xviii. _The Cavern_): “They will question thee, O Mahommed,\r\n  regarding Zu’lḳarnain. Reply: I will tell you his history”—and\r\n  then follows the story of the erection of the Rampart of Yájúj and\r\n  Májúj. In ch. xxi. again there is an allusion to their expected\r\n  issue at the latter day. This last expectation was one of very\r\n  old date. Thus the Cosmography of Aethicus, a work long believed\r\n  (though erroneously) to have been abridged by St. Jerome, and\r\n  therefore to be as old at least as the 4th century, says that the\r\n  _Turks_ of the race of Gog and Magog, a polluted nation, eating\r\n  human flesh and feeding on all abominations, never washing, and\r\n  never using wine, salt, nor wheat, shall come forth in the Day of\r\n  Antichrist from where they lie shut up behind the Caspian Gates,\r\n  and make horrid devastation. No wonder that the irruption of\r\n  the Tartars into Europe, heard of at first with almost as much\r\n  astonishment as such an event would produce now, was connected\r\n  with this prophetic legend![1] The Emperor Frederic II., writing\r\n  to Henry III. of England, says of the Tartars: “’Tis said they are\r\n  descended from the Ten Tribes who abandoned the Law of Moses, and\r\n  worshipped the Golden Calf. They are the people whom Alexander\r\n  Magnus shut up in the Caspian Mountains.”\r\n\r\n  [See the chapter _Gog et Magog dans le roman en alexandrins_, in\r\n  Paul Meyer’s _Alexandre le Grand dans la Littérature française_,\r\n  Paris, 1886, II. pp. 386–389.—H. C.]:\r\n\r\n      “Gos et Margos i vienent de la tiere des Turs\r\n       Et .cccc. m. hommes amenerent u plus,\r\n       Il en jurent la mer dont sire est Neptunus\r\n       Et le porte d’infier que garde Cerberus\r\n       Que l’orguel d’Alixandre torneront a reüs\r\n       Por çou les enclot puis es estres desus.\r\n       Dusc’ al tans Antecrist n’en istera mais nus.”\r\n\r\n  According to some chroniclers, the Emperor Heraclius had already\r\n  let loose the Shut-up Nations to aid him against the Persians, but\r\n  it brought him no good, for he was beaten in spite of their aid,\r\n  and died of grief.\r\n\r\n  The theory that the Tartars were Gog and Magog led to the Rampart\r\n  of Alexander being confounded with the Wall of China (see _infra_,\r\n  Bk. I. ch. lix.), or being relegated to the extreme N.E. of Asia,\r\n  as we find it in the Carta Catalana.\r\n\r\n  These legends are referred to by Rabbi Benjamin, Hayton, Rubruquis,\r\n  Ricold, Matthew Paris, and many more. Josephus indeed speaks of\r\n  the Pass which Alexander fortified with gates of steel. But his\r\n  saying that the King of Hyrcania was Lord of this Pass points to\r\n  the Hyrcanian Gates of Northern Persia, or perhaps to the Wall of\r\n  Gomushtapah, described by Vámbéry.\r\n\r\n  Ricold of Montecroce allows two arguments to connect the Tartars\r\n  with the Jews who were shut up by Alexander; one that the Tartars\r\n  hated the very name of Alexander, and could not bear to hear it;\r\n  the other, that their manner of writing was very like the Chaldean,\r\n  meaning apparently the Syriac (_anté_, p. 29). But he points out\r\n  that they had no resemblance to Jews, and no knowledge of the law.\r\n\r\n  Edrisi relates how the Khalif Wathek sent one Salem the Dragoman\r\n  to explore the Rampart of Gog and Magog. His route lay by Tiflis,\r\n  the Alan country, and that of the Bashkirds, to the far north or\r\n  north-east, and back by Samarkand. But the report of what he saw is\r\n  pure fable.\r\n\r\n  In 1857, Dr. Bellew seems to have found the ancient belief in the\r\n  legend still held by Afghan gentlemen at Kandahar.\r\n\r\n  At Gelath in Imeretia there still exists one valve of a large iron\r\n  gate, traditionally said to be the relic of a pair brought as a\r\n  trophy from Derbend by David, King of Georgia, called the Restorer\r\n  (1089–1130). M. Brosset, however, has shown it to be the gate of\r\n  Ganja, carried off in 1139.\r\n\r\n  (_Bayer_ in _Comment. Petropol._ I. 401 _seqq._; _Pseudo-Callisth._\r\n  by _Müller_, p. 138; _Gott. Viterb._ in _Pistorii Nidani Script.\r\n  Germ._ II. 228; _Alexandriade_, pp. 310–311; _Pereg._ IV. p. 118;\r\n  _Acad. des Insc. Divers Savans_, II. 483; _Edrisi_, II. 416–420,\r\n  etc.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The box-wood of the Abkhasian forests was so abundant, and\r\n  formed so important an article of Genoese trade, as to give the\r\n  name of _Chao de Bux_ (Cavo di Bussi) to the bay of Bambor, N.W.\r\n  of Sukum Kala’, where the traffic was carried on. (See _Elie de\r\n  Laprim._ 243.) Abulfeda also speaks of the Forest of Box (_Shará’\r\n  ul-buḳs_) on the shores of the Black Sea, from which box-wood was\r\n  exported to all parts of the world; but his indication of the exact\r\n  locality is confused. (_Reinaud’s Abulf._ I. 289.)\r\n\r\n  At the present time “Boxwood abounds on the southern coast of the\r\n  Caspian, and large quantities are exported from near Resht to\r\n  England and Russia. It is sent up the Volga to Tsaritzin, from\r\n  thence by rail to the Don, and down that river to the Black Sea,\r\n  from whence it is shipped to England.” (_MS. Note_, H. Y.)\r\n\r\n  [Cf. V. Helm’s _Cultivated Plants_, edited by J. S. Stallybrass,\r\n  Lond., 1891, _The Box Tree_, pp. 176–179.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Jerome Cardan notices that “the best and biggest goshawks\r\n  come from Armenia,” a term often including Georgia and Caucasus.\r\n  The name of the bird is perhaps the same as _’Afçi_, “Falco\r\n  montanus.” (See _Casiri_, I. 320.) Major St. John tells me that\r\n  the _Terlán_, or goshawk, much used in Persia, is still generally\r\n  brought from Caucasus. (_Cardan, de Rer. Varietate_, VII. 35.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—A letter of Warren Hastings, written shortly before\r\n  his death, and after reading Marsden’s Marco Polo, tells how a\r\n  fish-breeder of Banbury warned him against putting pike into his\r\n  fish-pond, saying, “If you should leave them where they are _till\r\n  Shrove Tuesday_ they will be sure to spawn, and then you will never\r\n  get any other fish to breed in it.” (_Romance of Travel_, I. 255.)\r\n  Edward Webbe in his Travels (1590, reprinted 1868) tells us that\r\n  in the “Land of Siria there is a River having great store of fish\r\n  like unto Salmon-trouts, but no Jew can catch them, though either\r\n  Christian and Turk shall catch them in abundance with great ease.”\r\n  The circumstance of fish being got only for a limited time in\r\n  spring is noticed with reference to Lake Van both by Tavernier and\r\n  Mr. Brant.\r\n\r\n  But the exact legend here reported is related (as M. Pauthier has\r\n  already noticed) by Wilibrand of Oldenburg of a stream under the\r\n  Castle of Adamodana, belonging to the Hospitallers, near Naversa\r\n  (the ancient _Anazarbus_), in Cilicia under Taurus. And Khanikoff\r\n  was told the same story of a lake in the district of Akhaltziké\r\n  in Western Georgia, in regard to which he explains the substance\r\n  of the phenomenon as a result of the rise of the lake’s level\r\n  by the melting of the snows, which often coincides with Lent. I\r\n  may add that Moorcroft was told respecting a sacred pond near\r\n  Sir-i-Chashma, on the road from Kabul to Bamian, that the fish\r\n  in the pond were not allowed to be touched, but that they were\r\n  accustomed to desert it for the rivulet that ran through the valley\r\n  regularly every year _on the day of the vernal equinox_, and it was\r\n  then lawful to catch them.\r\n\r\n  Like circumstances would produce the same effect in a variety of\r\n  lakes, and I have not been able to identify the convent of St.\r\n  Leonard’s. Indeed Leonard (_Sant Lienard_, G. T.) seems no likely\r\n  name for an Armenian Saint; and the patroness of the convent (as\r\n  she is of many others in that country) was perhaps Saint _Nina_,\r\n  an eminent personage in the Armenian Church, whose tomb is still a\r\n  place of pilgrimage; or possibly St. _Helena_, for I see that the\r\n  Russian maps show a place called _Elenovka_ on the shores of Lake\r\n  Sevan, N.E. of Erivan. Ramusio’s text, moreover, says that the\r\n  lake was _four days in compass_, and this description will apply,\r\n  I believe, to none but the lake just named. This is, according to\r\n  Monteith, 47 miles in length and 21 miles in breadth, and as far as\r\n  I can make out he travelled round it in three very long marches.\r\n  Convents and churches on its shores are numerous, and a very\r\n  ancient one occupies an island on the lake. The lake is noted for\r\n  its fish, especially magnificent trout.\r\n\r\n  (_Tavern._ Bk. III. ch. iii.; _J. R. G. S._ X. 897; _Pereg. Quat._\r\n  p. 179; _Khanikoff_, 15; _Moorcroft_, II. 382; _J. R. G. S._ III.\r\n  40 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  Ramusio has: “In this province there is a fine city called TIFLIS,\r\n  and round about it are many castles and walled villages. It is\r\n  inhabited by Christians, Armenians, Georgians, and some Saracens\r\n  and Jews, but not many.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—The name assigned by Marco to the Caspian, “Mer de\r\n  Gheluchelan” or “Ghelachelan,” has puzzled commentators. I have no\r\n  doubt that the interpretation adopted above is the correct one. I\r\n  suppose that Marco said that the sea was called “La Mer de Ghel\r\n  ou (de) Ghelan,” a name taken from the districts of the ancient\r\n  _Gelae_ on its south-western shores, called indifferently _Gíl_ or\r\n  _Gílán_, just as many other regions of Asia have like duplicate\r\n  titles (singular and plural), arising, I suppose, from the change\r\n  of a _gentile_ into a _local_ name. Such are Lár, Lárán, Khutl,\r\n  Khutlán, etc., a class to which Badakhshán, Wakhán, Shaghnán,\r\n  Mungán, Chaghánián, possibly Bámián, and many others have formerly\r\n  belonged, as the adjectives in some cases surviving, _Badakhshi,\r\n  Shaghni, Wákhi_, etc., show.[2] The change exemplified in the\r\n  induration of these _gentile plurals_ into _local singulars_ is\r\n  everywhere traced in the passage from earlier to later geography.\r\n  The old Indian geographical lists, such as are preserved in the\r\n  Puránas, and in Pliny’s extracts from Megasthenes, are, in the\r\n  main, lists of _peoples_, not of provinces, and even where the real\r\n  name seems to be local a _gentile_ form is often given. So also\r\n  _Tochari_ and _Sogdi_ are replaced by _Tokháristán_ and _Sughd_;\r\n  the _Veneti_ and _Taurini_ by Venice and Turin; the _Remi_ and the\r\n  _Parisii_, by Rheims and Paris; _East-Saxons_ and _South-Saxons_ by\r\n  Essex and Sussex; not to mention the countless _-ings_ that mark\r\n  the tribal settlement of the Saxons in Britain.\r\n\r\n  Abulfeda, speaking of this territory, uses exactly Polo’s phrase,\r\n  saying that the districts in question are properly called\r\n  _Kíl-o-Kílán_, but by the Arabs _Jíl-o-Jílán_. Teixeira gives\r\n  the Persian name of the sea as _Darya Ghiláni_. (See _Abulf._ in\r\n  _Büsching_, v. 329.)\r\n\r\n  [The province of Gíl (Gílán), which is situated between the\r\n  mountains and the Caspian Sea, and between the provinces of\r\n  Azerbaíján and Mázanderán (H. C.)], gave name to the silk for\r\n  which it was and is still famous, mentioned as _Ghelle_ (_Gílí_)\r\n  at the end of this chapter. This _Seta Ghella_ is mentioned also\r\n  by Pegolotti (pp. 212, 238, 301), and by Uzzano, with an odd\r\n  transposition, as Seta _Leggi_, along with Seta _Masandroni_,\r\n  _i.e._ from the adjoining province of Mázanderán (p. 192). May\r\n  not the Spanish _Geliz_, “a silk-dealer,” which seems to have\r\n  been a puzzle to etymologists, be connected with this? (See _Dozy\r\n  and Engelmann_, 2nd ed. p. 275.) [Prof. F. de Filippi (_Viaggo in\r\n  Persia nel_ 1862, ... Milan, 1865, 8vo) speaks of the silk industry\r\n  of Ghílán (pp. 295–296) as the principal product of the entire\r\n  province.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The dimensions assigned to the Caspian in the text would be very\r\n  correct if length were meant, but the Geog. Text with the same\r\n  figure specifies _circuit_ (_zire_). Ramusio again has “a circuit\r\n  of 2800 miles.” Possibly the original reading was 2700; but this\r\n  would be in excess.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—The Caspian is termed by Vincent of Beauvais _Mare\r\n  Seruanicum_, the Sea of Shirwan, another of its numerous Oriental\r\n  names, rendered by Marino Sanuto as _Mare Salvanicum_. (III. xi.\r\n  ch. ix.) But it was generally known to the Franks in the Middle\r\n  Ages as the SEA OF BACU. Thus Berni:—\r\n\r\n      “Fuor del deserto la diritta strada\r\n       Lungo il Mar di Bacu miglior pareva.”\r\n                                    (_Orl. Innam._ xvii. 60.)\r\n\r\n  And in the _Sfera_ of Lionardo Dati (_circa_ 1390):—\r\n\r\n      “Da Tramontana di quest’Asia Grande\r\n       Tartari son sotto la fredda Zona,\r\n       Gente bestial di bestie e vivande,\r\n       Fin dove _l’Onda di Baccù_ risuona,” etc. (p. 10.)\r\n\r\n  This name is introduced in Ramusio, but probably by interpolation,\r\n  as well as the correction of the statement regarding Euphrates,\r\n  which is perhaps a branch of the notion alluded to in _Prologue_,\r\n  ch. ii. note 5. In a later chapter Marco calls it the _Sea of\r\n  Sarai_, a title also given in the Carta Catalana. [Odorico calls it\r\n  Sea of _Bacuc_ (_Cathay_) and Sea of _Bascon_ (Cordier). The latter\r\n  name is a corruption of Abeskun, a small town and island in the\r\n  S.E. corner of the Caspian Sea, not far from Ashurada.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We have little information as to the Genoese navigation of the\r\n  Caspian, but the great number of names exhibited along its shores\r\n  in the map just named (1375) shows how familiar such navigation had\r\n  become by that date. See also _Cathay_, p. 50, where an account\r\n  is given of a remarkable enterprise by Genoese buccaneers on the\r\n  Caspian about that time. Mas’udi relates an earlier history of\r\n  how about the beginning of the 9th century a fleet of 500 Russian\r\n  vessels came out of the Volga, and ravaged all the populous\r\n  southern and western shores of the Caspian. The unhappy population\r\n  was struck with astonishment and horror at this unlooked-for\r\n  visitation from a sea that had hitherto been only frequented by\r\n  peaceful traders or fishermen. (II. 18–24.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 9.—[The enormous quantity of fish found in the Caspian Sea is\r\n  ascribed to the mass of vegetable food to be found in the shallower\r\n  waters of the North and the mouth of the Volga. According to\r\n  Reclus, the Caspian fisheries bring in fish to the annual value of\r\n  between three and four millions sterling.—H.

It is a very great kingdom, and inhabited{1} by several\r\ndifferent kinds of people whom we shall now describe.\r\n\r\nFirst there is a kind of people called ARABI, and these worship\r\nMahommet. Then there is another description of people who are NESTORIAN\r\nand JACOBITE Christians. These have a Patriarch, whom they call the\r\nJATOLIC, and this Patriarch creates Archbishops, and Abbots, and\r\nPrelates of all other degrees, and sends them into every quarter, as to\r\nIndia, to Baudas, or to Cathay, just as the Pope of Rome does in the\r\nLatin countries. For you must know that though there is a very great\r\nnumber of Christians in those countries, they are all Jacobites and\r\nNestorians; Christians indeed, but not in the fashion enjoined by the\r\nPope of Rome, for they come short in several points of the Faith.{2}\r\n\r\nAll the cloths of gold and silk that are called _Mosolins_ are made in\r\nthis country; and those great Merchants called _Mosolins_, who carry\r\nfor sale such quantities of spicery and pearls and cloths of silk and\r\ngold, are also from this kingdom.{3}\r\n\r\nThere is yet another race of people who inhabit the mountains in that\r\nquarter, and are called CURDS. Some of them are Christians, and some of\r\nthem are Saracens; but they are an evil generation, whose delight it is\r\nto plunder merchants.{4}\r\n\r\n[Near this province is another called MUS and MERDIN, producing an\r\nimmense quantity of cotton, from which they make a great deal of\r\nbuckram{5} and other cloth. The people are craftsmen and traders, and\r\nall are subject to the Tartar King.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Coin of Badruddín of Mausul.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Polo could scarcely have been justified in calling MOSUL a\r\n  very great kingdom. This is a bad habit of his, as we shall have\r\n  to notice again. Badruddín Lúlú, the last Atabeg of Mosul of the\r\n  race of Zenghi had at the age of 96 taken sides with Hulaku, and\r\n  stood high in his favour. His son Malik Sálih, having revolted,\r\n  surrendered to the Mongols in 1261 on promise of life; which\r\n  promise they kept in Mongol fashion by torturing him to death.\r\n  Since then the kingdom had ceased to exist as such. Coins of\r\n  Badruddín remain with the name and titles of Mangku Kaan on their\r\n  reverse, and some of his and of other atabegs exhibit curious\r\n  imitations of Greek art. (_Quat. Rash._ p. 389; _Jour. As._ IV. VI.\r\n  141.).—H. Y. and H. C. [Mosul was pillaged by Timur at the end of\r\n  the 14th century; during the 15th it fell into the hands of the\r\n  Turkomans, and during the 16th, of Ismail, Shah of Persia.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [The population of Mosul is to-day 61,000 inhabitants—(48,000\r\n  Musulmans, 10,000 Christians belonging to various churches, and\r\n  3000 Jews).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The Nestorian Church was at this time and in the preceding\r\n  centuries diffused over Asia to an extent of which little\r\n  conception is generally entertained, having a chain of Bishops and\r\n  Metropolitans from Jerusalem to Peking. The Church derived its\r\n  name from Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who was deposed\r\n  by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The chief “point of the Faith”\r\n  wherein it came short, was (at least in its most tangible form) the\r\n  doctrine that in Our Lord there were two Persons, one of the Divine\r\n  Word, the other of the Man Jesus; the former dwelling in the latter\r\n  as in a Temple, or uniting with the latter “as fire with iron.”\r\n  _Nestorin_, the term used by Polo, is almost a literal transcript\r\n  of the Arab form _Nastúri_. A notice of the Metropolitan sees, with\r\n  a map, will be found in _Cathay_, p. ccxliv.\r\n\r\n  _Játhalík_, written in our text (from G. T.) _Jatolic_, by Fr.\r\n  Burchard and Ricold _Jaselic_, stands for Καθολικóς. No doubt it\r\n  was originally _Gáthalík_, but altered in pronunciation by the\r\n  Arabs. The term was applied by Nestorians to their Patriarch; among\r\n  the Jacobites to the _Mafrián_ or Metropolitan. The Nestorian\r\n  Patriarch at this time resided at Baghdad. (_Assemani_, vol. iii.\r\n  pt. 2; _Per. Quat._ 91, 127.)\r\n\r\n  The Jacobites, or Jacobins, as they are called by writers of that\r\n  age (Ar. _Ya’úbkíy_), received their name from Jacob Baradaeus or\r\n  James Zanzale, Bishop of Edessa (so called, Mas’udi says, because\r\n  he was a maker of _barda’at_ or saddle-cloths), who gave a great\r\n  impulse to their doctrine in the 6th century. [At some time between\r\n  the years 541 and 578, he separated from the Church and became a\r\n  follower of the doctrine of Eutyches.—H. C.] The Jacobites then\r\n  formed an independent Church, which at one time spread over the\r\n  East at least as far as Sístán, where they had a see under the\r\n  Sassanian Kings. Their distinguishing tenet was _Monophysitism_,\r\n  viz., that Our Lord had but one Nature, the Divine. It was in\r\n  fact a rebound from Nestorian doctrine, but, as might be expected\r\n  in such a case, there was a vast number of shades of opinion\r\n  among both bodies. The chief locality of the Jacobites was in the\r\n  districts of Mosul, Tekrit, and Jazírah, and their Patriarch was\r\n  at this time settled at the Monastery of St. Matthew, near Mosul,\r\n  but afterwards, and to the present day, at or near Mardin. [They\r\n  have at present two patriarchates: the Monastery of Zapharan near\r\n  Baghdad and Etchmiadzin.—H. C.] The Armenian, Coptic, Abyssinian,\r\n  and Malabar Churches all hold some shade of the Jacobite doctrine,\r\n  though the first two at least have Patriarchs apart.\r\n\r\n  (_Assemani_, vol. ii.; _Le Quien_, II. 1596; _Mas’udi_, II.\r\n  329–330; _Per. Quat._ 124–129.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—We see here that _mosolin_ or _muslin_ had a very different\r\n  meaning from what it has now. A quotation from Ives by Marsden\r\n  shows it to have been applied in the middle of last century to\r\n  a strong cotton cloth made at Mosul. Dozy says the Arabs use\r\n  _Mauçili_ in the sense of muslin, and refers to passages in ‘The\r\n  Arabian Nights.’ [Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ II. p. 122) observes\r\n  “that in the narrative of Ch’ang Ch’un’s travels to the west in\r\n  1221, it is stated that in Samarkand the men of the lower classes\r\n  and the priests wrap their heads about with a piece of white\r\n  _mo-sze_. There can be no doubt that mo-sze here denotes ‘muslin,’\r\n  and the Chinese author seems to understand by this term the same\r\n  material which we are now used to call muslin.”—H. C.] I have found\r\n  no elucidation of Polo’s application of _mosolini_ to a class of\r\n  merchants. But, in a letter of Pope Innocent IV. (1244) to the\r\n  Dominicans in Palestine, we find classed as different bodies of\r\n  Oriental Christians, “_Jacobitae, Nestoritae, Georgiani, Graeci,\r\n  Armeni, Maronitae, et_ Mosolini.” (_Le Quien_, III. 1342.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—“The Curds,” says Ricold, “exceed in malignant ferocity all\r\n  the barbarous nations that I have seen.... They are called _Curti_,\r\n  not because they are curt in stature, but from the Persian word\r\n  for _Wolves_.... They have three principal vices, viz., Murder,\r\n  Robbery, and Treachery.” Some say they have not mended since,\r\n  but his etymology is doubtful. _Kúrt_ is Turkish for a wolf, not\r\n  Persian, which is _Gurg_; but the name (_Karduchi, Kordiaei_, etc.)\r\n  is older, I imagine, than the Turkish language in that part of\r\n  Asia. Quatremère refers it to the Persian _gurd_, “strong, valiant,\r\n  hero.” As regards the statement that some of the Kurds were\r\n  Christians, Mas’udi states that the Jacobites and certain other\r\n  Christians in the territory of Mosul and Mount Judi were reckoned\r\n  among the Kurds. (_Not. et Ext._ XIII. i. 304.) [The Kurds of Mosul\r\n  are in part nomadic and are called _Kotcheres_, but the greater\r\n  number are sedentary and cultivate cereals, cotton, tobacco, and\r\n  fruits. (_Cuinet._) Old Kurdistan had Shehrizor (Kerkuk, in the\r\n  sanjak of that name) as its capital.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Ramusio here, as in all passages where other texts\r\n  have _Bucherami_ and the like, puts _Boccassini_, a word which\r\n  has become obsolete in its turn. I see both _Bochayrani_ and\r\n  _Bochasini_ coupled, in a Genoese fiscal statute of 1339, quoted by\r\n  Pardessus. (_Lois Maritimes_, IV. 456.)\r\n\r\n  MUSH and MARDIN are in very different regions, but as their actual\r\n  interval is only about 120 miles, they _may_ have been under one\r\n  provincial government. Mush is essentially Armenian, and, though\r\n  the seat of a Pashalik, is now a wretched place. Mardin, on the\r\n  verge of the Mesopotamian Plain, rises in terraces on a lofty hill,\r\n  and there, says Hammer, “Sunnis and Shias, Catholic and Schismatic\r\n  Armenians, Jacobites, Nestorians, Chaldæans, Sun-, Fire-, Calf-,\r\n  and Devil-worshippers dwell one over the head of the other.”\r\n  (_Ilchan._ I. 191.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n          OF THE GREAT CITY OF BAUDAS, AND HOW IT WAS TAKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaudas is a great city, which used to be the seat of the Calif of all\r\nthe Saracens in the world, just as Rome is the seat of the Pope of all\r\nthe Christians.{1} A very great river flows through the city, and by\r\nthis you can descend to the Sea of India. There is a great traffic of\r\nmerchants with their goods this way; they descend some eighteen days\r\nfrom Baudas, and then come to a certain city called KISI, where they\r\nenter the Sea of India.{2} There is also on the river, as you go from\r\nBaudas to Kisi, a great city called BASTRA, surrounded by woods, in\r\nwhich grow the best dates in the world.{3}\r\n\r\nIn Baudas they weave many different kinds of silk stuffs and gold\r\nbrocades, such as _nasich_, and _nac_, and _cramoisy_, and many another\r\nbeautiful tissue richly wrought with figures of beasts and birds. It is\r\nthe noblest and greatest city in all those regions.{4}\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass on a day in the year of Christ 1255, that the Lord\r\nof the Tartars of the Levant, whose name was Alaü, brother to the Great\r\nKaan now reigning, gathered a mighty host and came up against Baudas\r\nand took it by storm.{5} It was a great enterprise! for in Baudas\r\nthere were more than 100,000 horse, besides foot soldiers. And when\r\nAlaü had taken the place he found therein a tower of the Califs, which\r\nwas full of gold and silver and other treasure; in fact the greatest\r\naccumulation of treasure in one spot that ever was known.{6} When he\r\nbeheld that great heap of treasure he was astonished, and, summoning\r\nthe Calif to his presence, he said to him: “Calif, tell me now why\r\nthou hast gathered such a huge treasure? What didst thou mean to do\r\ntherewith? Knewest thou not that I was thine enemy, and that I was\r\ncoming against thee with so great an host to cast thee forth of thine\r\nheritage? Wherefore didst thou not take of thy gear and employ it in\r\npaying knights and soldiers to defend thee and thy city?”\r\n\r\nThe Calif wist not what to answer, and said never a word. So the Prince\r\ncontinued, “Now then, Calif, since I see what a love thou hast borne\r\nthy treasure, I will e’en give it thee to eat!” So he shut the Calif\r\nup in the Treasure Tower, and bade that neither meat nor drink should\r\nbe given him, saying, “Now, Calif, eat of thy treasure as much as thou\r\nwilt, since thou art so fond of it; for never shalt thou have aught\r\nelse to eat!”\r\n\r\nSo the Calif lingered in the tower four days, and then died like a\r\ndog. Truly his treasure would have been of more service to him had\r\nhe bestowed it upon men who would have defended his kingdom and his\r\npeople, rather than let himself be taken and deposed and put to death\r\nas he was.{7} Howbeit, since that time, there has been never another\r\nCalif, either at Baudas or anywhere else.{8}\r\n\r\nNow I will tell you of a great miracle that befell at Baudas, wrought\r\nby God on behalf of the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—This form of the Mediæval Frank name of BAGHDAD, _Baudas_\r\n  [the Chinese traveller, Ch’ang Te, _Si Shi Ki_, XIII. cent., says,\r\n  “the kingdom of _Bao-da_,” H. C.], is curiously like that used by\r\n  the Chinese historians, _Paota_ (_Pauthier; Gaubil_), and both\r\n  are probably due to the Mongol habit of slurring gutturals. (See\r\n  _Prologue_, ch. ii. note 3.) [Baghdad was taken on the 5th of\r\n  February, 1258, and the Khalif surrendered to Hulaku on the 10th of\r\n  February.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Polo is here either speaking without personal knowledge, or\r\n  is so brief as to convey an erroneous impression that the Tigris\r\n  flows to Kisi, whereas three-fourths of the length of the Persian\r\n  Gulf intervene between the river mouth and Kisi. The latter is the\r\n  island and city of KISH or KAIS, about 200 miles from the mouth of\r\n  the Gulf, and for a long time one of the chief ports of trade with\r\n  India and the East. The island, the _Cataea_ of Arrian, now called\r\n  Ghes or Kenn, is singular among the islands of the Gulf as being\r\n  wooded and well supplied with fresh water. The ruins of a city\r\n  [called Harira, according to Lord Curzon,] exist on the north side.\r\n  According to Wassáf, the island derived its name from one Kais,\r\n  the son of a poor widow of Síráf (then a great port of Indian trade\r\n  on the northern shore of the Gulf), who on a voyage to India, about\r\n  the 10th century, made a fortune precisely as Dick Whittington did.\r\n  The proceeds of the cat were invested in an establishment on this\r\n  island. Modern attempts to nationalise Whittington may surely be\r\n  given up! It is one of the tales which, like Tell’s shot, the dog\r\n  Gellert, and many others, are common to many regions. (_Hammer’s\r\n  Ilch._ I. 239; _Ouseley’s Travels_, I. 170; _Notes and Queries_,\r\n  2nd s. XI. 372.)\r\n\r\n  Mr. Badger, in a postscript to his translation of the History of\r\n  Omán (_Hak. Soc._ 1871), maintains that Kish or Kais was at this\r\n  time a city on the mainland, and identical from Síráf. He refers\r\n  to Ibn Batuta (II. 244), who certainly does speak of visiting “the\r\n  city of Kais, called also Síráf.” And Polo, neither here nor in Bk.\r\n  III. ch. xl., speaks of Kisi as an island. I am inclined, however,\r\n  to think that this was from not having visited it. Ibn Batuta says\r\n  nothing of Síráf as a seat of trade; but the historian Wassáf,\r\n  who had been in the service of Jamáluddín al-Thaibi, the Lord of\r\n  Kais, in speaking of the export of horses thence to India, calls\r\n  it “the _Island_ of Kais.” (Elliot, III. 34.) Compare allusions to\r\n  this horse trade in ch. xv. and in Bk. III. ch. xvii. Wassáf was\r\n  precisely a contemporary of Polo.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The name is _Bascra_ in the MSS., but this is almost\r\n  certainly the common error of _c_ for _t_. BASRA is still noted for\r\n  its vast date-groves. “The whole country from the confluence of\r\n  the Euphrates and Tigris to the sea, a distance of 30 leagues, is\r\n  covered with these trees.” (_Tav._ Bk. II. ch. iii.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—From Baudas, or Baldac, _i.e._ Baghdad, certain of these\r\n  rich silk and gold brocades were called _Baldachini_, or in English\r\n  _Baudekins_. From their use in the state canopies and umbrellas\r\n  of Italian dignitaries, the word _Baldacchino_ has come to mean a\r\n  canopy, even when architectural. [_Baldekino, baldacchino_, was\r\n  at first entirely made of silk, but afterwards silk was mixed\r\n  (_sericum mixtum_) with cotton or thread. When Hulaku conquered\r\n  Baghdad part of the tribute was to be paid with that kind of stuff.\r\n  Later on, says Heyd (II. p. 697), it was also manufactured in the\r\n  province of Ahwaz, at Damas and at Cyprus; it was carried as far\r\n  as France and England. Among the articles sent from Baghdad to\r\n  Okkodai Khan, mentioned in the _Yüan ch’ao pi shi_ (made in the\r\n  14th century), quoted by Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ II. p. 124),\r\n  we note: _Nakhut_ (a kind of gold brocade), _Nachidut_ (a silk\r\n  stuff interwoven with gold), _Dardas_ (a stuff embroidered in\r\n  gold). Bretschneider (p. 125) adds: “With respect to _nakhut_ and\r\n  _nachidut_, I may observe that these words represent the Mongol\r\n  plural form of _nakh_ and _nachetti_.... I may finally mention that\r\n  in the _Yüan shi_, ch. lxxviii. (on official dresses), a stuff,\r\n  _na-shi-shi_, is repeatedly named, and the term is explained there\r\n  by _kin kin_ (gold brocade).”—H. C.] The stuffs called _Nasich_\r\n  and _Nac_ are again mentioned by our traveller below (ch. lix.).\r\n  We only know that they were of silk and gold, as he implies here,\r\n  and as Ibn Batuta tells us, who mentions _Nakh_ several times and\r\n  _Nasíj_ once. The latter is also mentioned by Rubruquis (_Nasic_)\r\n  as a present made to him at the Kaan’s court. And Pegolotti speaks\r\n  of both _nacchi_ and _nacchetti_ of silk and gold, the latter\r\n  apparently answering to _Nasich_. _Nac, Nacques, Nachiz, Nacíz,\r\n  Nasís_, appear in accounts and inventories of the 14th century,\r\n  French and English. (See _Dictionnaire des Tissus_, II. 199, and\r\n  _Douet d’Arcq, Comptes de l’Argenterie des Rois de France_, etc.,\r\n  334.) We find no mention of _Nakh_ or _Nasíj_ among the stuffs\r\n  detailed in the _Aín Akbari_, so they must have been obsolete\r\n  in the 16th century. [Cf. Heyd, _Com. du Levant_, II. p. 698;\r\n  _Nacco_, nachetto, comes from the Arabic _nakh_ (_nekh_); _nassit_\r\n  (_nasith_) from the Arabic _nécidj_.—H. C.] _Quermesis_ or Cramoisy\r\n  derived its name from the Kermes insect (Ar. _Kirmiz_) found on\r\n  _Quercus coccifera_, now supplanted by cochineal. The stuff so\r\n  called is believed to have been originally a crimson velvet, but\r\n  apparently, like the mediæval _Purpura_, if not identical with it,\r\n  it came to indicate a tissue rather than a colour. Thus Fr.-Michel\r\n  quotes velvet of vermeil cramoisy, of violet, and of blue\r\n  cramoisy, and _pourpres_ of a variety of colours, though he says\r\n  he has never met with _pourpre blanche_. I may, however, point to\r\n  Plano Carpini (p. 755), who describes the courtiers at Karakorum as\r\n  clad in white _purpura_.\r\n\r\n  The London prices of _Chermisi_ and _Baldacchini_ in the early part\r\n  of the 15th century will be found in Uzzano’s work, but they are\r\n  hard to elucidate.\r\n\r\n  Babylon, of which Baghdad was the representative, was famous\r\n  for its variegated textures in very early days. We do not know\r\n  the nature of the goodly Babylonish garment which tempted Achan\r\n  in Jericho, but Josephus speaks of the affluence of rich stuffs\r\n  carried in the triumph of Titus, “gorgeous with life-like designs\r\n  from the Babylonian loom,” and he also describes the memorable Veil\r\n  of the Temple as a πέπλος Βαβυλώνιος of varied colours marvellously\r\n  wrought. Pliny says King Attalus invented the intertexture of cloth\r\n  with gold; but the weaving of damasks of a variety of colours was\r\n  perfected at Babylon, and thence they were called Babylonian.\r\n\r\n  The brocades wrought with figures of animals in gold, of which\r\n  Marco speaks, are still a _spécialité_ at Benares, where they\r\n  are known by the name of _Shikárgáh_ or hunting-grounds, which\r\n  is nearly a translation of the name _Thard-wahsh_ “beast-hunts,”\r\n  by which they were known to the mediæval Saracens. (See _Q.\r\n  Makrizi_, IV. 69–70.) Plautus speaks of such patterns in carpets,\r\n  the produce of Alexandria—“_Alexandrina_ belluata _conchyliata\r\n  tapetia_.” Athenaeus speaks of Persian carpets of like description\r\n  at an extravagant entertainment given by Antiochus Epiphanes; and\r\n  the same author cites a banquet given in Persia by Alexander, at\r\n  which there figured costly curtains embroidered with animals. In\r\n  the 4th century Asterius, Bishop of Amasia in Pontus, rebukes\r\n  the Christians who indulge in such attire: “You find upon them\r\n  lions, panthers, bears, huntsmen, woods, and rocks; whilst the\r\n  more devout display Christ and His disciples, with the stories of\r\n  His miracles,” etc. And Sidonius alludes to upholstery of like\r\n  character:\r\n\r\n      “Peregrina det supellex\r\n         *     *     *     *\r\n       Ubi torvus, et per artem\r\n       Resupina flexus ora,\r\n       It equo reditque telo\r\n       Simulacra bestiarum\r\n       Fugiens fugansque Parthus.” (_Epist._ ix. 13.)\r\n\r\n  A modern Kashmír example of such work is shown under ch. xvii.\r\n\r\n  (_D’Avezac_, p. 524; _Pegolotti_, in _Cathay_, 295, 306; _I.\r\n  B._ II. 309, 388, 422; III. 81; _Della Decima_, IV. 125–126;\r\n  _Fr.-Michel, Recherches_, etc., II. 10–16, 204–206; _Joseph.

Res._ I. p. 114) says: “Hulagu left\r\n  Karakorum, the residence of his brother, on the 2nd May, 1253,\r\n  and returned to his ordo, in order to organize his army. On the\r\n  19th October of the same year, all being ready, he started for\r\n  the west.” He arrived at Samarkand in September, 1255. For this\r\n  chapter and the following of Polo, see: _Hulagu’s Expedition to\r\n  Western Asia, after the Mohammedan Authors_, pp. 112–122, and\r\n  the _Translation of the Si Shi Ki_ (Ch’ang Te), pp. 122–156, in\r\n  Bretschneider’s _Mediæval Researches_, I.—H.

A great part of the booty, however,\r\n  had been sent to Mangu Khan.” (_Hulagu’s Exp._, Bretschneider,\r\n  _Med. Res._ I. p. 120.) Ch’ang Te says (_Si Shi Ki_, p. 139): “The\r\n  palace of the Ha-li-fa was built of fragrant and precious woods.\r\n  The walls of it were constructed of black and white jade. It is\r\n  impossible to imagine the quantity of gold and precious stones\r\n  found there.”—H.

The memory of the last glorious old man\r\n  must have failed him, when he says the facts were related by some\r\n  merchants who came to King Lewis, when before Saiette (or Sidon),\r\n  viz. in 1253, for the capture of Baghdad occurred five years\r\n  later. Mar. Sanuto says melted gold was poured down the Khalif’s\r\n  throat—a transfer, no doubt, from the old story of Crassus and the\r\n  Parthians. Contemporary Armenian historians assert that Hulaku slew\r\n  him with his own hand.\r\n\r\n  All that Rashiduddin says is: “The evening of Wednesday, the 14th\r\n  of Safar, 656 (20th February, 1258), the Khalif was put to death in\r\n  the village of Wakf, with his eldest son and five eunuchs who had\r\n  never quitted him.” Later writers say that he was wrapt in a carpet\r\n  and trodden to death by horses.\r\n\r\n  [Cf. _The Story of the Death of the last Abbaside Caliph, from\r\n  the Vatican MS. of Ibn-al-Furāt_, by G. le Strange (_Jour. R. As.\r\n  Soc._, April, 1900, pp. 293–300). This is the story of the death of\r\n  the Khalif told by Ibn-al-Furāt (born in Cairo, 1335 A.D.):\r\n\r\n  “Then Hūlagū gave command, and the Caliph was left a-hungering,\r\n  until his case was that of very great hunger, so that he called\r\n  asking that somewhat might be given him to eat. And the accursed\r\n  Hūlagū sent for a dish with gold therein, and a dish with silver\r\n  therein, and a dish with gems, and ordered these all to be set\r\n  before the Caliph al Musta’sim, saying to him, ‘Eat these.’ But\r\n  the Caliph made answer, ‘These be not fit for eating.’ Then said\r\n  Hūlagū: ‘Since thou didst so well know that these be not fit for\r\n  eating, why didst thou make a store thereof? With part thereof\r\n  thou mightest have sent gifts to propitiate us, and with part thou\r\n  shouldst have raised an army to serve thee and defend thyself\r\n  against us! And Hūlagū commanded them to take forth the Caliph and\r\n  his son to a place without the camp, and they were here bound and\r\n  put into two great sacks, being afterwards trampled under foot till\r\n  they both died—the mercy of Allah be upon them.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The foundation of the story, so widely received among the\r\n  Christians, is to be found also in the narrative of Nikbi (and\r\n  Mirkhond), which is cited by D’Ohsson. When the Khalif surrendered,\r\n  Hulaku put before him a plateful of gold, and told him to eat\r\n  it. “But one does not eat gold,” said the prisoner. “Why, then,”\r\n  replied the Tartar, “did you hoard it, instead of expending it\r\n  in keeping up an army? Why did you not meet me at the Oxus?” The\r\n  Khalif could only say, “Such was God’s will!” “And that which has\r\n  befallen you was also God’s will,” said Hulaku.\r\n\r\n  Wassáf’s narrative is interesting:—“Two days after his capture\r\n  the Khalif was at his morning prayer, and began with the verse\r\n  (_Koran_, III. 25), ‘Say God is the Possessor of Dominion! It\r\n  shall be given to whom He will; it shall be taken from whom He\r\n  will: whom He will He raiseth to honour; whom He will He casteth\r\n  to the ground.’ Having finished the regular office he continued\r\n  still in prayer with tears and importunity. Bystanders reported to\r\n  the Ilkhan the deep humiliation of the Khalif’s prayers, and the\r\n  text which seemed to have so striking an application to those two\r\n  princes. Regarding what followed there are different stories. Some\r\n  say that the Ilkhan ordered food to be withheld from the Khalif,\r\n  and that when he asked for food the former bade a dish of gold be\r\n  placed before him, etc. Eventually, after taking counsel with his\r\n  chiefs, the Padishah ordered the execution of the Khalif. It was\r\n  represented that the blood-drinking sword ought not to be stained\r\n  with the gore of Mosta’sim. He was therefore rolled in a carpet,\r\n  just as carpets are usually rolled up, insomuch that his limbs were\r\n  crushed.”\r\n\r\n  The avarice of the Khalif was proverbial. When the Mongol army was\r\n  investing Miafaraḳain, the chief, Malik Kamál, told his people that\r\n  everything he had should be at the service of those in need: “Thank\r\n  God, I am not like Mosta’sim, a worshipper of silver and gold!”\r\n\r\n  (_Hayton_ in _Ram._ ch. xxvi.; _Per.

And such indeed is the truth. But when\r\nthey had got hold of this text they were delighted, for it seemed to\r\nthem the very thing whereby either to force all the Christians to\r\nchange their faith, or to bring destruction upon them all. The Calif\r\ntherefore called together all the Christians in his territories, who\r\nwere extremely numerous. And when they had come before him, he showed\r\nthem the Gospel, and made them read the text which I have mentioned.\r\nAnd when they had read it he asked them if that was the truth? The\r\nChristians answered that it assuredly was so. “Well,” said the Calif,\r\n“since you say that it is the truth, I will give you a choice. Among\r\nsuch a number of you there must needs surely be this small amount of\r\nfaith; so you must either move that mountain there,”—and he pointed to\r\na mountain in the neighbourhood—“or you shall die an ill death; unless\r\nyou choose to eschew death by all becoming Saracens and adopting our\r\nHoly Law. To this end I give you a respite of ten days; if the thing\r\nbe not done by that time, ye shall die or become Saracens.” And when\r\nhe had said this he dismissed them, to consider what was to be done in\r\nthis strait wherein they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The date in the G. Text and Pauthier is 1275, which of\r\n  course cannot have been intended. Ramusio has 1225.\r\n\r\n  [The Khalifs in 1225 were Abu’l Abbas Ahmed VII. en-Nassir lidini\r\n  ’llah (1180–1225) and Abu Nasr Mohammed IX. ed-Dhahir bi-emri ’llah\r\n  (1225–1226).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Cum sez regisles et cum sez casses._” (G. T.) I suppose\r\n  the former expression to be a form of _Regules_, which is used in\r\n  Polo’s book for persons of a religious _rule_ or order, whether\r\n  Christian or Pagan. The latter word (_casses_) I take to be the\r\n  Arabic _Kashísh_, properly a Christian Presbyter, but frequently\r\n  applied by old travellers, and habitually by the Portuguese\r\n  (_caxiz, caxix_), to Mahomedan Divines. (See _Cathay_, p. 568.) It\r\n  may, however, be _Kází_.\r\n\r\n  Pauthier’s text has simply “à ses prestres de la Loi.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE CHRISTIANS WERE IN GREAT DISMAY BECAUSE OF WHAT\r\n                          THE CALIF HAD SAID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christians on hearing what the Calif had said were in great dismay,\r\nbut they lifted all their hopes to God, their Creator, that He would\r\nhelp them in this their strait. All the wisest of the Christians took\r\ncounsel together, and among them were a number of bishops and priests,\r\nbut they had no resource except to turn to Him from whom all good\r\nthings do come, beseeching Him to protect them from the cruel hands of\r\nthe Calif.\r\n\r\nSo they were all gathered together in prayer, both men and women,\r\nfor eight days and eight nights. And whilst they were thus engaged\r\nin prayer it was revealed in a vision by a Holy Angel of Heaven to a\r\ncertain Bishop who was a very good Christian, that he should desire\r\na certain Christian Cobler,{1} who had but one eye, to pray to God;\r\nand that God in His goodness would grant such prayer because of the\r\nCobler’s holy life.\r\n\r\nNow I must tell you what manner of man this Cobler was. He was one who\r\nled a life of great uprightness and chastity, and who fasted and kept\r\nfrom all sin, and went daily to church to hear Mass, and gave daily a\r\nportion of his gains to God. And the way how he came to have but one\r\neye was this. It happened one day that a certain woman came to him to\r\nhave a pair of shoes made, and she showed him her foot that he might\r\ntake her measure. Now she had a very beautiful foot and leg; and the\r\nCobler in taking her measure was conscious of sinful thoughts. And he\r\nhad often heard it said in the Holy Evangel, that if thine eye offend\r\nthee, pluck it out and cast it from thee, rather than sin. So, as soon\r\nas the woman had departed, he took the awl that he used in stitching,\r\nand drove it into his eye and destroyed it. And this is the way he came\r\nto lose his eye. So you can judge what a holy, just, and righteous man\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Here the G. T. uses a strange word: “_Or te vais a tel_\r\n  cralantur.” It does not occur again, being replaced by _chabitier_\r\n  (savetier). It has an Oriental look, but I can make no satisfactory\r\n  suggestion as to what the word meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n          HOW THE ONE-EYED COBLER WAS DESIRED TO PRAY FOR THE\r\n                              CHRISTIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when this vision had visited the Bishop several times, he related\r\nthe whole matter to the Christians, and they agreed with one consent to\r\ncall the Cobler before them. And when he had come they told him it was\r\ntheir wish that he should pray, and that God had promised to accomplish\r\nthe matter by his means. On hearing their request he made many excuses,\r\ndeclaring that he was not at all so good a man as they represented. But\r\nthey persisted in their request with so much sweetness, that at last he\r\nsaid he would not tarry, but do what they desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n           HOW THE PRAYER OF THE ONE-EYED COBLER CAUSED THE\r\n                           MOUNTAIN TO MOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the appointed day was come, all the Christians got up early,\r\nmen and women, small and great, more than 100,000 persons, and went to\r\nchurch, and heard the Holy Mass. And after Mass had been sung, they all\r\nwent forth together in a great procession to the plain in front of the\r\nmountain, carrying the precious cross before them, loudly singing and\r\ngreatly weeping as they went. And when they arrived at the spot, there\r\nthey found the Calif with all his Saracen host armed to slay them if\r\nthey would not change their faith; for the Saracens believed not in the\r\nleast that God would grant such favour to the Christians. These latter\r\nstood indeed in great fear and doubt, but nevertheless they rested\r\ntheir hope on their God Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nSo the Cobler received the Bishop’s benison, and then threw himself on\r\nhis knees before the Holy Cross, and stretched out his hands towards\r\nHeaven, and made this prayer: “Blessed LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, I pray Thee\r\nby Thy goodness that Thou wilt grant this grace unto Thy people,\r\ninsomuch that they perish not, nor Thy faith be cast down, nor abused\r\nnor flouted. Not that I am in the least worthy to prefer such request\r\nunto Thee; but for Thy great power and mercy I beseech Thee to hear\r\nthis prayer from me Thy servant full of sin.”\r\n\r\nAnd when he had ended this his prayer to God the Sovereign Father and\r\nGiver of all grace, and whilst the Calif and all the Saracens, and\r\nother people there, were looking on, the mountain rose out of its place\r\nand moved to the spot which the Calif had pointed out! And when the\r\nCalif and all his Saracens beheld, they stood amazed at the wonderful\r\nmiracle that God had wrought for the Christians, insomuch that a great\r\nnumber of the Saracens became Christians. And even the Calif caused\r\nhimself to be baptised in the name of the Father and of the Son and of\r\nthe Holy Ghost, Amen, and became a Christian, but in secret. Howbeit,\r\nwhen he died they found a little cross hung round his neck; and\r\ntherefore the Saracens would not bury him with the other Califs, but\r\nput him in a place apart. The Christians exulted greatly at this most\r\nholy miracle, and returned to their homes full of joy, giving thanks to\r\ntheir Creator for that which He had done.{1}\r\n\r\nAnd now you have heard in what wise took place this great miracle. And\r\nmarvel not that the Saracens hate the Christians; for the accursed\r\nlaw that Mahommet gave them commands them to do all the mischief in\r\ntheir power to all other descriptions of people, and especially to\r\nChristians; to strip such of their goods, and do them all manner of\r\nevil, because they belong not to their law. See then what an evil\r\nlaw and what naughty commandments they have! But in such fashion the\r\nSaracens act, throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNow I have told you something of Baudas. I could easily indeed have\r\ntold you first of the affairs and the customs of the people there.\r\nBut it would be too long a business, looking to the great and strange\r\nthings that I have got to tell you, as you will find detailed in this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\nSo now I will tell you of the noble city of Tauris.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—We may remember that at a date only three years before\r\n  Marco related this story (viz. in 1295), the cottage of Loreto is\r\n  asserted to have changed its locality for the third and last time\r\n  by moving to the site which it now occupies.\r\n\r\n  Some of the old Latin copies place the scene at Tauris. And I\r\n  observe that a missionary of the 16th century does the same. The\r\n  mountain, he says, is between Tauris and Nakhshiwan, and is called\r\n  _Manhuc_. (_Gravina_, _Christianità nell’Armenia_, etc., Roma,\r\n  1605, p. 91.)\r\n\r\n  The moving of a mountain is one of the miracles ascribed to\r\n  Gregory Thaumaturgus. Such stories are rife among the Mahomedans\r\n  themselves. “I know,” says Khanikoff, “at least half a score of\r\n  mountains which the Musulmans allege to have come from the vicinity\r\n  of Mecca.”\r\n\r\n  Ramusio’s text adds here: “All the Nestorian and Jacobite\r\n  Christians from that time forward have maintained a solemn\r\n  celebration of the day on which the miracle occurred, keeping a\r\n  fast also on the eve thereof.”\r\n\r\n  F. Göring, a writer who contributes three articles on Marco Polo to\r\n  the _Neue Züricher-Zeitung_, 5th, 6th, 8th April, 1878, says: “I\r\n  heard related in Egypt a report which Marco Polo had transmitted\r\n  to Baghdad. I will give it here in connection with another which I\r\n  also came across in Egypt.\r\n\r\n  “‘Many years ago there reigned in Babylon, on the Nile, a haughty\r\n  Khalif who vexed the Christians with taxes and corvées. He was\r\n  confirmed in his hate of the Christians by the Khakam Chacham\r\n  Bashi or Chief Rabbi of the Jews, who one day said to him: “The\r\n  Christians allege in their books that it shall not hurt them to\r\n  drink or eat any deadly thing. So I have prepared a potion that\r\n  one of them shall taste at my hand: if he does not die on the spot\r\n  then call me no more Chacham Bashi!” The Khalif immediately sent\r\n  for His Holiness the Patriarch of Babylon, and ordered him to drink\r\n  up the potion. The Patriarch just blew a little over the cup and\r\n  then emptied it at a draught, and took no harm. His Holiness then\r\n  on his side demanded that the Chacham Bashi should quaff a cup to\r\n  the health of the Khalif, which he (the Patriarch) should first\r\n  taste, and this the Khalif found only fair and right. But hardly\r\n  had the Chacham Bashi put the cup to his lips than he fell down\r\n  and expired.’ Still the Musulmans and Jews thirsted for Christian\r\n  blood. It happened at that time that a mass of the hill Mokattani\r\n  became loose and threatened to come down upon Babylon. This was\r\n  laid to the door of the Christians, and they were ordered to stop\r\n  it. The Patriarch in great distress has a vision that tells him\r\n  summon the saintly cobbler (of whom the same story is told as\r\n  here)—the cobbler bids the rock to stand still and it does so to\r\n  this day. ‘These two stories may still be heard in Cairo’—from\r\n  whom is not said. The hill that threatened to fall on the Egyptian\r\n  Babylon is called in Turkish _Dur Dagh_, ‘Stay, or halt-hill.’\r\n  (_L.c._ April, 1878.)”—_MS. Note_, H. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                     OF THE NOBLE CITY OF TAURIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTauris is a great and noble city, situated in a great province called\r\nYRAC, in which are many other towns and villages. But as Tauris is the\r\nmost noble I will tell you about it.{1}\r\n\r\nThe men of Tauris get their living by trade and handicrafts, for they\r\nweave many kinds of beautiful and valuable stuffs of silk and gold.\r\nThe city has such a good position that merchandize is brought thither\r\nfrom India, Baudas, CREMESOR,{2} and many other regions; and that\r\nattracts many Latin merchants, especially Genoese, to buy goods and\r\ntransact other business there; the more as it is also a great market\r\nfor precious stones. It is a city in fact where merchants make large\r\nprofits.{3}\r\n\r\nThe people of the place are themselves poor creatures; and are a\r\ngreat medley of different classes. There are Armenians, Nestorians,\r\nJacobites, Georgians, Persians, and finally the natives of the city\r\nthemselves, who are worshippers of Mahommet. These last are a very evil\r\ngeneration; they are known as TAURIZI.{4} The city is all girt round\r\nwith charming gardens, full of many varieties of large and excellent\r\nfruits.{5}\r\n\r\nNow we will quit Tauris, and speak of the great country of Persia.\r\n[From Tauris to Persia is a journey of twelve days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Abulfeda notices that TABRÍZ was vulgarly pronounced\r\n  _Tauriz_, and this appears to have been adopted by the Franks. In\r\n  Pegolotti the name is always _Torissi_.\r\n\r\n  Tabriz is often reckoned to belong to Armenia, as by Hayton.\r\n  Properly it is the chief city of _Azerbaiján_, which never was\r\n  included in ’IRÁK. But it may be observed that Ibn Batuta generally\r\n  calls the Mongol Ilkhan of Persia _Sáhib_ or _Malik ul-’Irák_, and\r\n  as Tabriz was the capital of that sovereign, we can account for\r\n  the mistake, whilst admitting it to be one. [The destruction of\r\n  Baghdad by Hulaku made Tabriz the great commercial and political\r\n  city of Asia, and diverted the route of Indian products from the\r\n  Mediterranean to the Euxine. It was the route to the Persian Gulf\r\n  by Kashan, Yezd, and Kermán, to the Mediterranean by Lajazzo, and\r\n  later on by Aleppo,—and to the Euxine by Trebizond. The destruction\r\n  of the Kingdom of Armenia closed to Europeans the route of\r\n  Tauris.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—_Cremesor_, as Baldelli points out, is GARMSIR, meaning a\r\n  hot region, a term which in Persia has acquired several specific\r\n  applications, and especially indicates the coast-country on the\r\n  N.E. side of the Persian Gulf, including Hormuz and the ports in\r\n  that quarter.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—[Of the Italians established at Tabriz, the first whose\r\n  name is mentioned is the Venetian Pietro Viglioni (Vioni); his\r\n  will, dated 10th December, 1264, is still in existence. (_Archiv.\r\n  Venet._ XXVI. pp. 161–165; _Heyd_, French Ed., II. p. 110.)—H. C.]\r\n  At a later date (1341) the Genoese had a factory at Tabriz headed\r\n  by a consul with a council of twenty-four merchants, and in 1320\r\n  there is evidence of a Venetian settlement there. (_Elie de la\r\n  Prim_, 161; _Heyd_, II. 82.)\r\n\r\n  Rashiduddin says of Tabriz that there were gathered there under the\r\n  eyes of the Padishah of Islam “philosophers, astronomers, scholars,\r\n  historians, of all religions, of all sects; people of Cathay, of\r\n  Máchín, of India, of Kashmir, of Tibet, of the Uighúr and other\r\n  Turkish nations, Arabs and Franks.” Ibn Batuta: “I traversed the\r\n  bazaar of the jewellers, and my eyes were dazzled by the varieties\r\n  of precious stones which I beheld. Handsome slaves, superbly\r\n  dressed, and girdled with silk, offered their gems for sale to the\r\n  Tartar ladies, who bought great numbers. [Odoric (ed. Cordier)\r\n  speaks also of the great trade of Tabriz.] Tabriz maintained a\r\n  large population and prosperity down to the 17th century, as may be\r\n  seen in Chardin. It is now greatly fallen, though still a place of\r\n  importance.” (_Quat. Rash._, p. 39; _I. B._ II. 130.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Ghazan Khan’s Mosque at Tabriz.—(From Fergusson.)]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—In Pauthier’s text this is _Touzi_, a mere clerical error,\r\n  I doubt not for _Torizi_, in accordance with the G. Text (“_le\r\n  peuple de la cité que sunt apelés_ Tauriz”), with the Latin, and\r\n  with Ramusio. All that he means to say is that the people are\r\n  called _Tabrízís_. Not recondite information, but ’tis his way.\r\n  Just so he tells us in ch. iii. that the people of Hermenia are\r\n  called Hermins, and elsewhere that the people of Tebet are called\r\n  Tebet. So Hayton thinks it not inappropriate to say that the people\r\n  of Catay are called Cataini, that the people of Corasmia are called\r\n  Corasmins, and that the people of the cities of Persia are called\r\n  Persians.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Hamd Allah Mastaufi, the Geographer, not long after Polo’s\r\n  time, gives an account of Tabriz, quoted in Barbier de Meynard’s\r\n  _Dict. de la Perse_, p. 132. This also notices the extensive\r\n  gardens round the city, the great abundance and cheapness of\r\n  fruits, the vanity, insolence, and faithlessness of the Tabrízís,\r\n  etc. (p. 132 _seqq._). Our cut shows a relic of the Mongol Dynasty\r\n  at Tabriz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n       OF THE MONASTERY OF ST. BARSAMO ON THE BORDERS OF TAURIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the borders of (the territory of) Tauris there is a monastery called\r\nafter Saint Barsamo, a most devout Saint. There is an Abbot, with many\r\nMonks, who wear a habit like that of the Carmelites, and these to\r\navoid idleness are continually knitting woollen girdles. These they\r\nplace upon the altar of St. Barsamo during the service, and when they\r\ngo begging about the province (like the Brethren of the Holy Spirit)\r\nthey present them to their friends and to the gentlefolks, for they are\r\nexcellent things to remove bodily pain; wherefore every one is devoutly\r\neager to possess them.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Barsauma (“The Son of Fasting”) was a native of Samosata,\r\n  and an Archimandrite of the Asiatic Church. He opposed the\r\n  Nestorians, but became himself still more obnoxious to the orthodox\r\n  as a spreader of the Monophysite Heresy. He was condemned by the\r\n  Council of Chalcedon (451), and died in 458. He is a Saint of fame\r\n  in the Jacobite and Armenian Churches, and several monasteries\r\n  were dedicated to him; but by far the most celebrated, and\r\n  doubtless that meant here, was near Malatia. It must have been\r\n  famous even among the Mahomedans, for it has an article in Bákúi’s\r\n  Geog. Dictionary. (_Dír-Barsúma_, see _N. et Ext._ II. 515.) This\r\n  monastery possessed relics of Barsauma and of St. Peter, and\r\n  was sometimes the residence of the Jacobite Patriarch and the\r\n  meeting-place of the Synods.\r\n\r\n  A more marvellous story than Marco’s is related of this monastery\r\n  by Vincent of Beauvais: “There is in that kingdom (Armenia) a place\r\n  called St. Brassamus, at which there is a monastery for 300 monks.\r\n  And ’tis said that if ever an enemy attacks it, the defences of the\r\n  monastery move of themselves, and shoot back the shot against the\r\n  besieger.”\r\n\r\n  (_Assemani_ in vol. ii. _passim; Tournefort_, III. 260; _Vin. Bell.\r\n  Spec. Historiale_, Lib. XXX. c. cxlii.; see also _Mar. Sanut._ III.\r\n  xi. c. 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n       OF THE GREAT COUNTRY OF PERSIA; WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE\r\n                             THREE KINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersia is a great country, which was in old times very illustrious and\r\npowerful; but now the Tartars have wasted and destroyed it.\r\n\r\nIn Persia is the city of SABA, from which the Three Magi set out when\r\nthey went to worship Jesus Christ; and in this city they are buried,\r\nin three very large and beautiful monuments, side by side. And above\r\nthem there is a square building, carefully kept. The bodies are still\r\nentire, with the hair and beard remaining. One of these was called\r\nJaspar, the second Melchior, and the third Balthasar. Messer Marco Polo\r\nasked a great many questions of the people of that city as to those\r\nThree Magi, but never one could he find that knew aught of the matter,\r\nexcept that these were three kings who were buried there in days of\r\nold. However, at a place three days’ journey distant he heard of what I\r\nam going to tell you. He found a village there which goes by the name\r\nof CALA ATAPERISTAN,{1} which is as much as to say, “The Castle of the\r\nFire-worshippers.” And the name is rightly applied, for the people\r\nthere do worship fire, and I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nThey relate that in old times three kings of that country went away\r\nto worship a Prophet that was born, and they carried with them three\r\nmanner of offerings, Gold, and Frankincense, and Myrrh; in order to\r\nascertain whether that Prophet were God, or an earthly King, or a\r\nPhysician. For, said they, if he take the Gold, then he is an earthly\r\nKing; if he take the Incense he is God; if he take the Myrrh he is a\r\nPhysician.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass when they had come to the place where the Child\r\nwas born, the youngest of the Three Kings went in first, and found the\r\nChild apparently just of his own age; so he went forth again marvelling\r\ngreatly. The middle one entered next, and like the first he found\r\nthe Child seemingly of his own age; so he also went forth again and\r\nmarvelled greatly. Lastly, the eldest went in, and as it had befallen\r\nthe other two, so it befell him. And he went forth very pensive. And\r\nwhen the three had rejoined one another, each told what he had seen;\r\nand then they all marvelled the more. So they agreed to go in all three\r\ntogether, and on doing so they beheld the Child with the appearance of\r\nits actual age, to wit, some thirteen days.{2} Then they adored, and\r\npresented their Gold and Incense and Myrrh. And the Child took all the\r\nthree offerings, and then gave them a small closed box; whereupon the\r\nKings departed to return into their own land.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—_Kala’ Atishparastán_, meaning as in the text. (_Marsden_.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—According to the Collectanea ascribed to Bede, Melchior was\r\n  a hoary old man; Balthazar in his prime, with a beard; Gaspar young\r\n  and beardless. (_Inchofer, Tres Magi Evangelici_, Romae, 1639.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n        WHAT BEFELL WHEN THE THREE KINGS RETURNED TO THEIR OWN\r\n                               COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when they had ridden many days they said they would see what the\r\nChild had given them. So they opened the little box, and inside it they\r\nfound a stone. On seeing this they began to wonder what this might be\r\nthat the Child had given them, and what was the import thereof. Now the\r\nsignification was this: when they presented their offerings, the Child\r\nhad accepted all three, and when they saw that they had said within\r\nthemselves that He was the True God, and the True King, and the True\r\nPhysician.{1} And what the gift of the stone implied was that this\r\nFaith which had begun in them should abide firm as a rock. For He well\r\nknew what was in their thoughts. Howbeit, they had no understanding at\r\nall of this signification of the gift of the stone; so they cast it\r\ninto a well. Then straightway a fire from Heaven descended into that\r\nwell wherein the stone had been cast.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Three Kings beheld this marvel they were sore amazed, and\r\nit greatly repented them that they had cast away the stone; for well\r\nthey then perceived that it had a great and holy meaning. So they took\r\nof that fire, and carried it into their own country, and placed it in\r\na rich and beautiful church. And there the people keep it continually\r\nburning, and worship it as a god, and all the sacrifices they offer are\r\nkindled with that fire. And if ever the fire becomes extinct they go to\r\nother cities round about where the same faith is held, and obtain of\r\nthat fire from them, and carry it to the church. And this is the reason\r\nwhy the people of this country worship fire. They will often go ten\r\ndays’ journey to get of that fire.{2}\r\n\r\nSuch then was the story told by the people of that Castle to Messer\r\nMarco Polo; they declared to him for a truth that such was their\r\nhistory, and that one of the three kings was of the city called\r\nSABA, and the second of AVA, and the third of that very Castle where\r\nthey still worship fire, with the people of all the country round\r\nabout.{3}\r\n\r\nHaving related this story, I will now tell you of the different\r\nprovinces of Persia, and their peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“_Mire_.” This was in old French the popular word for a\r\n  Leech; the politer word was _Physicien_. (_N. et E._ V. 505.)\r\n\r\n  Chrysostom says that the Gold, Myrrh, and Frankincense were mystic\r\n  gifts indicating King, Man, God; and this interpretation was the\r\n  usual one. Thus Prudentius:—\r\n\r\n      “Regem, Deumque adnunciant\r\n       Thesaurus et fragrans odor\r\n       Thuris Sabaei, at myrrheus\r\n       Pulvis sepulchrum praedocet.” (_Hymnus Epiphanius_.)\r\n\r\n  And the Paris Liturgy:—\r\n\r\n      “Offert Aurum _Caritas_,\r\n       Et Myrrham _Austeritas_,\r\n         Et Thus _Desiderium_.\r\n       Auro _Rex_ agnoscitur,\r\n       _Homo_ Myrrha, colitur\r\n         Thure _Deus_ gentium.”\r\n\r\n  And in the “Hymns, Ancient and Modern”:—\r\n\r\n      “Sacred gifts of mystic meaning:\r\n       Incense doth their God disclose,\r\n       Gold the King of Kings proclaimeth,\r\n         Myrrh His sepulchre foreshows.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“Feruntque (Magi), si justum est credi, etiam ignem\r\n  caelitus lapsum apud se sempiternis foculis custodire, cujus\r\n  portionem exiguam, ut faustam praeisse quondam Asiaticis Regibus\r\n  dicunt.” (_Ammian. Marcell._ XXIII. 6.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Saba or Sava still exists as SÁVAH, about 50 miles S.W. of\r\n  Tehrân. It is described by Mr. Consul Abbott, who visited it in\r\n  1849, as the most ruinous town he had ever seen, and as containing\r\n  about 1000 families. The people retain a tradition, mentioned by\r\n  Hamd Allah Mastaufi, that the city stood on the shores of a Lake\r\n  which dried up miraculously at the birth of Mahomed. Sávah is\r\n  said to have possessed one of the greatest Libraries in the East,\r\n  until its destruction by the Mongols on their first invasion of\r\n  Persia. Both Sávah and Ávah (or Ábah) are mentioned by Abulfeda\r\n  as cities of Jibal. We are told that the two cities were always\r\n  at loggerheads, the former being Sunni and the latter Shiya. [We\r\n  read in the _Travels_ of Thévenot, a most intelligent traveller,\r\n  “qu’il n’a rien écrit de l’ancienne ville de Sava qu’il trouva sur\r\n  son chemin, et où il a marqué lui-même que son esprit de curiosité\r\n  l’abandonna.” (_Voyages_, éd. 1727, vol. v. p. 343. He died a\r\n  few days after at Miana, in Armenia, 28th November, 1667). (_MS.\r\n  Note._—H. Y.)]\r\n\r\n  As regards the position of AVAH, Abbott says that a village still\r\n  stands upon the site, about 16 miles S.S.E. of Sávah. He did not\r\n  visit it, but took a bearing to it. He was told there was a mound\r\n  there on which formerly stood a Gueber Castle. At Sávah he could\r\n  find no trace of Marco Polo’s legend. Chardin, in whose time Sávah\r\n  was not quite so far gone to decay, heard of an alleged tomb of\r\n  Samuel, at 4 leagues from the city. This is alluded to by Hamd\r\n  Allah.\r\n\r\n  Keith Johnston and Kiepert put Ávah some 60 miles W.N.W. of Sávah,\r\n  on the road between Kazvin and Hamadan. There seems to be some\r\n  great mistake here.\r\n\r\n  Friar Odoric puts the locality of the Magi at _Kashan_, though one\r\n  of the versions of Ramusio and the Palatine MS. (see Cordier’s\r\n  Odoric, pp. xcv. and 41 of his Itinerary), perhaps corrected in\r\n  this, puts it at _Saba_.—H. Y. and H. C.\r\n\r\n  We have no means of fixing the _Kala’ Atishparastán_. It is\r\n  probable, however, that the story was picked up on the homeward\r\n  journey, and as it seems to be implied that this castle was reached\r\n  three days _after leaving_ Sávah, I should look for it between\r\n  Sávah and Abher. Ruins to which the name _Kila’-i-Gabr_, “Gueber\r\n  Castle,” attaches are common in Persia.\r\n\r\n  As regards the Legend itself, which shows such a curious mixture of\r\n  Christian and Parsi elements, it is related some 350 years earlier\r\n  by Mas’udi: “In the Province of Fars they tell you of a Well called\r\n  the Well of Fire, near which there was a temple built. When the\r\n  Messiah was born the King Koresh sent three messengers to him, the\r\n  first of whom carried a bag of Incense, the second a bag of Myrrh,\r\n  and the third a bag of Gold. They set out under the guidance of the\r\n  Star which the king had described to them, arrived in Syria, and\r\n  found the Messiah with Mary His Mother. This story of the three\r\n  messengers is related by the Christians with sundry exaggerations;\r\n  it is also found in the Gospel. Thus they say that the Star\r\n  appeared to Koresh at the moment of Christ’s birth; that it went on\r\n  when the messengers went on, and stopped when they stopped. More\r\n  ample particulars will be found in our Historical Annals, where we\r\n  have given the versions of this legend as current among the Guebers\r\n  and among the Christians. It will be seen that Mary gave the king’s\r\n  messengers a round loaf, and this, after different adventures, they\r\n  hid under a rock in the province of Fars. The loaf disappeared\r\n  underground, and there they dug a well, on which they beheld two\r\n  columns of fire to start up flaming at the surface; in short, all\r\n  the details of the legend will be found in our Annals.” The Editors\r\n  say that Mas’udi had carried the story to Fars by mistaking _Shíz_\r\n  in Azerbaiján (the Atropatenian Ecbatana of Sir H. Rawlinson) for\r\n  _Shiraz_. A rudiment of the same legend is contained in the Arabic\r\n  Gospel of the Infancy. This says that Mary gave the Magi one of the\r\n  bands in which the Child was swathed. On their return they cast\r\n  this into their sacred fire; though wrapt in the flame it remained\r\n  unhurt.\r\n\r\n  We may add that there was a Christian tradition that the Star\r\n  descended into a well between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Gregory\r\n  of Tours also relates that in a certain well, at Bethlehem, from\r\n  which Mary had drawn water, the Star was sometimes seen, by devout\r\n  pilgrims who looked carefully for it, to pass from one side to the\r\n  other. But only such as merited the boon could see it.\r\n\r\n  (See _Abbott_ in _J. R. G. S._ XXV. 4–6; _Assemani_, III. pt. 2,\r\n  750; _Chardin_, II. 407; _N. et Ext._ II. 465; _Dict. de la Perse_,\r\n  2, 56, 298; _Cathay_, p. 51; _Mas’udi_, IV. 80; _Greg. Turon. Libri\r\n  Miraculorum_, Paris, 1858, I. 8.)\r\n\r\n  Several of the fancies that legend has attached to the brief story\r\n  of the Magi in St. Matthew, such as the royal dignity of the\r\n  persons; their location, now in Arabia, now (as here) at Saba in\r\n  Persia, and again (as in Hayton and the Catalan Map) in Tarsia or\r\n  Eastern Turkestan; the notion that one of them was a Negro, and so\r\n  on, probably grew out of the arbitrary application of passages in\r\n  the Old Testament, such as: “_Venient legati ex Aegypto_: AETHIOPIA\r\n  _praevenit manus ejus Deo_” (Ps. lxviii. 31). This produced\r\n  the Negro who usually is painted as one of the Three. “_Reges_\r\n  THARSIS _et Insulae munera offerent: Reges_ ARABUM _et_ SABA _dona\r\n  adducent_” (lxxii. 10). This made the Three into Kings, and fixed\r\n  them in Tarsia, Arabia, and Sava. “_Mundatio Camelorum operiet te,\r\n  dromedarii Madian et_ EPHA: _omnes de_ SABA _venient aurum et thus\r\n  deferentes et laudem Domino annunciantes_” (Is. lx. 6). Here were\r\n  Ava and Sava coupled, as well as the gold and frankincense.\r\n\r\n  One form of the old Church Legend was that the Three were buried at\r\n  _Sessania Adrumetorum_ (Hadhramaut) in Arabia, whence the Empress\r\n  Helena had the bodies conveyed to Constantinople, [and later to\r\n  Milan in the time of the Emperor Manuel Comnenus. After the fall of\r\n  Milan (1162), Frederic Barbarossa gave them to Archbishop Rainald\r\n  of Dassel (1159–1167), who carried them to Cologne (23rd July,\r\n  1164).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The names given by Polo, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, have been\r\n  accepted from an old date by the Roman Church; but an abundant\r\n  variety of other names has been assigned to them. Hyde quotes a\r\n  Syriac writer who calls them Aruphon, Hurmon, and Tachshesh, but\r\n  says that some call them Gudphorbus, Artachshasht, and Labudo;\r\n  whilst in Persian they were termed Amad, Zad-Amad, Drust-Amad,\r\n  _i.e._ _Venit, Cito Venit, Sincerus Venit_. Some called them in\r\n  Greek, Apellius, Amerus, and Damascus, and in Hebrew, Magaloth,\r\n  Galgalath, and Saracia, but otherwise Ator, Sator, and Petatoros!\r\n  The Armenian Church used the same names as the Roman, but in\r\n  Chaldee they were Kaghba, Badadilma, Badada Kharida. (_Hyde, Rel.\r\n  Vet. Pers._ 382–383; _Inchofer, ut supra; J. As._ sér. VI. IX.\r\n  160.)\r\n\r\n  [Just before going to press we have read Major Sykes’ new book on\r\n  _Persia_. Major Sykes (ch. xxiii.) does not believe that Marco\r\n  visited Baghdád, and he thinks that the Venetians entered Persia\r\n  near Tabriz, and travelled to Sultania, Kashán, and Yezd. Thence\r\n  they proceeded to Kerman and Hormuz. We shall discuss this question\r\n  in the Introduction.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n             OF THE EIGHT KINGDOMS OF PERSIA, AND HOW THEY\r\n                              ARE NAMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that Persia is a very great country, and contains\r\neight kingdoms. I will tell you the names of them all.\r\n\r\nThe first kingdom is that at the beginning of Persia, and it is called\r\nCASVIN; the second is further to the south, and is called CURDISTAN;\r\nthe third is LOR; the fourth [SUOLSTAN]; the fifth ISTANIT; the sixth\r\nSERAZY; the seventh SONCARA; the eighth TUNOCAIN, which is at the\r\nfurther extremity of Persia. All these kingdoms lie in a southerly\r\ndirection except one, to wit, Tunocain; that lies towards the east, and\r\nborders on the (country of the) Arbre Sol.{1}\r\n\r\nIn this country of Persia there is a great supply of fine horses;\r\nand people take them to India for sale, for they are horses of great\r\nprice, a single one being worth as much of their money as is equal to\r\n200 livres Tournois; some will be more, some less, according to the\r\nquality.{2} Here also are the finest asses in the world, one of them\r\nbeing worth full 30 marks of silver, for they are very large and fast,\r\nand acquire a capital amble. Dealers carry their horses to Kisi and\r\nCurmosa, two cities on the shores of the Sea of India, and there they\r\nmeet with merchants who take the horses on to India for sale.\r\n\r\nIn this country there are many cruel and murderous people, so that no\r\nday passes but there is some homicide among them. Were it not for the\r\nGovernment, which is that of the Tartars of the Levant, they would do\r\ngreat mischief to merchants; and indeed, maugre the Government, they\r\noften succeed in doing such mischief. Unless merchants be well armed\r\nthey run the risk of being murdered, or at least robbed of everything;\r\nand it sometimes happens that a whole party perishes in this way when\r\nnot on their guard. The people are all Saracens, _i.e._ followers of\r\nthe Law of Mahommet.{3}\r\n\r\nIn the cities there are traders and artizans who live by their labour\r\nand crafts, weaving cloths of gold, and silk stuffs of sundry kinds.\r\nThey have plenty of cotton produced in the country; and abundance of\r\nwheat, barley, millet, panick, and wine, with fruits of all kinds.\r\n\r\n[Some one may say, “But the Saracens don’t drink wine, which is\r\nprohibited by their law.” The answer is that they gloss their text in\r\nthis way, that if the wine be boiled, so that a part is dissipated\r\nand the rest becomes sweet, they may drink without breach of the\r\ncommandment; for it is then no longer called wine, the name being\r\nchanged with the change of flavour.{4}]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The following appear to be Polo’s Eight Kingdoms:—\r\n\r\n  I. KAZVÍN; then a flourishing city, though I know not why he calls\r\n  it a kingdom. Persian ’Irák, or the northern portion thereof, seems\r\n  intended. Previous to Hulaku’s invasion Kazvín seems to have been\r\n  in the hands of the Ismailites or Assassins.\r\n\r\n  II. KURDISTAN. I do not understand the difficulties of Marsden,\r\n  followed by Lazari and Pauthier, which lead them to put forth that\r\n  Kurdistan is not Kurdistan but something else. The boundaries of\r\n  Kurdistan according to Hamd Allah were Arabian ’Irák, Khuzistán,\r\n  Persian ’Irák, Azerbaijan and Diarbekr. (_Dict. de la P._ 480.)\r\n  [Cf. Curzon, _Persia pass._—H. C.] Persian Kurdistan, in modern\r\n  as in mediæval times, extends south beyond Kermanshah to the\r\n  immediate border of Polo’s next kingdom, viz.:\r\n\r\n  III. LÚR or Lúristán. [On Lúristán, see Curzon, _Persia_, II.\r\n  pp. 273–303, with the pedigree of the Ruling Family of the Feili\r\n  Lurs (Pusht-i-Kuh), p. 278.—H. C.] This was divided into two\r\n  principalities, Great Lúr and Little Lúr, distinctions still\r\n  existing. The former was ruled by a Dynasty called the _Faslúyah_\r\n  Atabegs, which endured from about 1155 to 1424, [when it was\r\n  destroyed by the Timurids; it was a Kurd Dynasty, founded by Emad\r\n  ed-din Abu Thaher (1160–1228), and the last prince of which was\r\n  Ghiyas ed-din (1424). In 1258 the general Kitubuka (Hulagu’s _Exp.\r\n  to Persia_, Bretschneider, _Med. Res._ I. p. 121) is reported\r\n  to have reduced the country of Lúr or Lúristán and its Atabeg\r\n  Teghele.—H. C.]. Their territory lay in the mountainous district\r\n  immediately west of Ispahan, and extended to the River of Dizfúl,\r\n  which parted it from Little Lúr. The stronghold of the Atabegs was\r\n  the extraordinary hill fort of Mungasht, and they had a residence\r\n  also at Aidhej or Mal-Amir in the mountains south of Shushan, where\r\n  Ibn Batuta visited the reigning Prince in 1327. Sir H. Rawlinson\r\n  has described Mungasht, and Mr. Layard and Baron de Bode have\r\n  visited other parts, but the country is still very imperfectly\r\n  known. Little Lúristán lay west of the R. Dizfúl, extending nearly\r\n  to the Plain of Babylonia. Its Dynasty, called Kurshid, [was\r\n  founded in 1184 by the Kurd Shodja ed-din Khurshid, and existed\r\n  till Shah-Werdy lost his throne in 1593.—H. C.].\r\n\r\n  The Lúrs are akin to the Kurds, and speak a Kurd dialect, as do all\r\n  those Ilyáts, or nomads of Persia, who are not of Turkish race.\r\n  They were noted in the Middle Ages for their agility and their\r\n  dexterity in thieving. The tribes of Little Lúr “do not affect the\r\n  slightest veneration for Mahomed or the Koran; their only general\r\n  object of worship is their great Saint Baba Buzurg,” and particular\r\n  disciples regard with reverence little short of adoration holy men\r\n  looked on as living representatives of the Divinity. (_Ilchan._ I.\r\n  70 _seqq._; _Rawlinson_ in _J. R. G. S._ IX.; _Layard_ in _Do._\r\n  XVI. 75, 94; _Ld. Strangford_ in _J. R. A. S._ XX. 64; _N. et E._\r\n  XIII. i. 330, _I. B._ II. 31; _D’Ohsson_, IV. 171–172.)\r\n\r\n  IV. SHÚLISTÁN, best represented by Ramusio’s _Suolstan_, whilst\r\n  the old French texts have _Cielstan_ (_i.e._ Shelstán); the name\r\n  applied to the country of the _Shúls_, or _Shauls_, a people who\r\n  long occupied a part of Lúristán, but were expelled by the Lúrs\r\n  in the 12th century, and settled in the country between Shíráz\r\n  and Khuzistán (now that of the Mamaseni, whom Colonel Pelly’s\r\n  information identifies with the Shúls), their central points being\r\n  Naobanján and the fortress called Kala’ Safed or “White Castle.”\r\n  Ibn Batuta, going from Shiraz to Kazerun, encamped the first\r\n  day in the country of the Shúls, “a Persian desert tribe which\r\n  includes some pious persons.” (_Q. R._ p. 385; _N. et E._ XIII. i.\r\n  332–333; _Ilch._ I. 71; _J. R. G. S._ XIII. Map; _I. B._ II. 88.)\r\n  [“Adjoining the Kuhgelus on the East are the tents of the Mamasenni\r\n  (qy. Mohammed Huseini) Lúrs, occupying the country still known as\r\n  Shúlistán, and extending as far east and south-east as Fars and the\r\n  Plain of Kazerun. This tribe prides itself on its origin, claiming\r\n  to have come from Seistán, and to be directly descended from\r\n  Rustam, whose name is still borne by one of the Mamasenni clans.”\r\n  (Curzon, _Persia_, II. p. 318.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  V. ISPAHAN? The name is in Ramusio _Spaan_, showing at least that\r\n  he or some one before him had made this identification. The unusual\r\n  combination _ff_, _i.e._ sf, in manuscript would be so like the\r\n  frequent one _ft_, _i.e._ st, that the change from Isfan to Istan\r\n  would be easy. But why Istan_it_?\r\n\r\n  VI. SHÍRÁZ [(_Shir_ = milk, or _Shir_ = lion)—H. C.] representing\r\n  the province of Fars or Persia Proper, of which it has been for\r\n  ages the chief city. [It was founded after the Arab conquest in\r\n  694 A.D., by Mohammed, son of Yusuf Kekfi. (Curzon, _Persia_, II.\r\n  pp. 93–110.)—H. C.] The last Dynasty that had reigned in Fars\r\n  was that of the Salghur Atabegs, founded about the middle of the\r\n  12th century. Under Abubakr (1226–1260) this kingdom attained\r\n  considerable power, embracing Fars, Kermán, the islands of the\r\n  Gulf and its Arabian shores; and Shíráz then flourished in arts\r\n  and literature; Abubakr was the patron of Saadi. From about 1262,\r\n  though a Salghurian princess, married to a son of Hulaku, had the\r\n  nominal title of Atabeg, the province of Fars was under Mongol\r\n  administration. (_Ilch. passim_.)\r\n\r\n  VII. SHAWÁNKÁRA or Shabánkára. The G. T. has _Soucara_, but the\r\n  Crusca gives the true reading _Soncara_. It is the country of the\r\n  Shawánkárs, a people coupled with the Shúls and Lúrs in mediæval\r\n  Persian history, and like them of Kurd affinities. Their princes,\r\n  of a family Faslúyah, are spoken of as influential before the\r\n  Mahomedan conquest, but the name of the people comes prominently\r\n  forward only during the Mongol era of Persian history. [Shabánkára\r\n  was taken in 1056 from the Buyid Dynasty, who ruled from the\r\n  10th century over a great part of Persia, by Fazl ibn Hassan\r\n  (Fazluïeh-Hasunïeh). Under the last sovereign, Ardeshir, Shabánkára\r\n  was taken in 1355 by the Modhafferians, who reigned in ’Irák, Fars,\r\n  and Kermán, one of the Dynasties established at the expense of\r\n  the Mongol Ilkhans after the death of Abu Saïd (1335), and were\r\n  themselves subjugated by Timur in 1392.—H. C.] Their country lay\r\n  to the south of the great salt lake east of Shíráz, and included\r\n  Niriz and Darábjird, Fassa, Forg, and Tárum. Their capital was\r\n  I′g or I′j, called also Irej, about 20 miles north-west of Daráb,\r\n  with a great mountain fortress; it was taken by Hulaku in 1259.\r\n  The son of the prince was continued in nominal authority, with\r\n  Mongol administrators. In consequence of a rebellion in 1311 the\r\n  Dynasty seems to have been extinguished. A descendant attempted\r\n  to revive their authority about the middle of the same century.\r\n  The latest historical mention of the name that I have found is in\r\n  Abdurrazzák’s _History of Shah Rukh_, under the year H. 807 (1404).\r\n  (See _Jour. As._ 3d. s. vol. ii. 355.) But a note by Colonel Pelly\r\n  informs me that the name Shabánkára is still applied (1) to the\r\n  district round the towns of Runiz and Gauristan near Bandar Abbas;\r\n  (2) to a village near Maiman, in the old country of the tribe; (3)\r\n  to a _tribe_ and district of Dashtistan, 38 farsakhs west of Shíráz.\r\n\r\n  With reference to the form in the text, _Soncara_, I may notice\r\n  that in two passages of the _Masálak-ul-Absár_, translated by\r\n  Quatremère, the name occurs as _Shankárah_. (_Q. R._ pp. 380, 440\r\n  _seqq._; _N. et E._ XIII.; _Ilch._ I. 71 and _passim; Ouseley’s\r\n  Travels_, II. 158 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  VIII. TÚN-O-KÁIN, the eastern Kuhistán or Hill country of Persia,\r\n  of which Tún and Káin are chief cities. The practice of indicating\r\n  a locality by combining two names in this way is common in the\r\n  East. Elsewhere in this book we find _Ariora-Keshemur_ and\r\n  _Kes-macoran_ (Kij-Makrán). Upper Sind is often called in India by\r\n  the Sepoys _Rori-Bakkar_, from two adjoining places on the Indus;\r\n  whilst in former days, Lower Sind was often called _Diul-Sind.\r\n  Karra-Mánikpúr, Uch-Multán, Kunduz-Baghlán_ are other examples.\r\n\r\n  The exact expression _Tún-o-Káin_ for the province here in\r\n  question is used by Baber, and evidently also by some of Hammer’s\r\n  authorities. (_Baber_, pp. 201, 204; see _Ilch._ II. 190; I. 95,\r\n  104, and _Hist. de l’Ordre des Assassins_, p. 245.)\r\n\r\n  [We learn from (Sir) C. Macgregor’s (1875) _Journey through\r\n  Khorasan_ (I. p. 127) that the same territory including Gháín\r\n  or Kaïn is now called by the analogous name of Tabas-o-Tún. Tún\r\n  and Kaïn (Gháín) are both described in their modern state, by\r\n  Macgregor. (_Ibid._ pp. 147 and 161.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Note that the identification of _Suolstan_ is due to Quatremère\r\n  (see _N. et E._ XIII. i. _circa_ p. 332); that of _Soncara_ to\r\n  Defréméry (_J. As._ sér. IV. tom. xi. p. 441); and that of\r\n  _Tunocain_ to Malte-Brun. (_N. Ann. des V._ xviii. p. 261.) I may\r\n  add that the _Lúrs_, the _Shúls_, and the _Shabánkáras_ are the\r\n  subjects of three successive sections in the _Masálak-al-Absár_\r\n  of _Shihábuddin Dimishki_, a work which reflects much of Polo’s\r\n  geography. (See _N. et E._ XIII. i. 330–333; Curzon, _Persia_, II.\r\n  pp. 248 and 251.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The horses exported to India, of which we shall hear more\r\n  hereafter, were probably the same class of “Gulf Arabs” that are\r\n  now carried thither. But the Turkman horses of Persia are also\r\n  very valuable, especially for endurance. Kinneir speaks of one\r\n  accomplishing 900 miles in eleven days, and Ferrier states a still\r\n  more extraordinary feat from his own knowledge. In that case one of\r\n  those horses went from Tehran to Tabriz, returned, and went again\r\n  to Tabriz, within twelve days, including two days’ rest. The total\r\n  distance is about 1100 miles.\r\n\r\n  The _livre tournois_ at this period was equivalent to a little over\r\n  18 francs of modern French silver. But in bringing the value to our\r\n  modern gold standard we must add one-third, as the ratio of silver\r\n  to gold was then 1:12 instead of 1:16. Hence the equivalent in gold\r\n  of the livre tournois is very little less than 1_l._ sterling, and\r\n  the price of the horse would be about 193_l._[1]\r\n\r\n  Mr. Wright quotes an ordinance of Philip III. of France (1270–1285)\r\n  fixing the maximum price that might be given for a palfrey at\r\n  60 _livres tournois_, and for a squire’s _roncin_ at 20 livres.\r\n  Joinville, however, speaks of a couple of horses presented to St.\r\n  Lewis in 1254 by the Abbot of Cluny, which he says would at the\r\n  time of his writing (1309) have been worth 500 livres (the pair, it\r\n  would seem). Hence it may be concluded in a general way that the\r\n  _ordinary_ price of imported horses in India approached that of the\r\n  highest class of horses in Europe. (_Hist. of Dom. Manners_, p.\r\n  317; _Joinville_, p. 205.)\r\n\r\n  About 1850 a very fair Arab could be purchased in Bombay for\r\n  60_l._, or even less; but prices are much higher now.\r\n\r\n  With regard to the donkeys, according to Tavernier, the fine ones\r\n  used by merchants in Persia were imported from Arabia. The mark\r\n  of silver was equivalent to about 44_s._ of our silver money, and\r\n  allowing as before for the lower relative value of gold, 30 marks\r\n  would be equivalent to 88_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\n  _Kisi_ or Kish we have already heard of. _Curmosa_ is Hormuz, of\r\n  which we shall hear more. With a Pisan, as Rusticiano was, the\r\n  sound of _c_ is purely and strongly aspirate. Giovanni d’Empoli, in\r\n  the beginning of the 16th century, another Tuscan, also calls it\r\n  _Cormus_. (See _Archiv. Stor. Ital._ Append. III. 81.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The character of the nomad and semi-nomad tribes of Persia\r\n  in those days—Kurds, Lúrs, Shúls, Karaunahs, etc.—probably deserved\r\n  all that Polo says, and it is not changed now. Take as an example\r\n  Rawlinson’s account of the Bakhtyáris of Luristán: “I believe them\r\n  to be individually brave, but of a cruel and savage character; they\r\n  pursue their blood feuds with the most inveterate and exterminating\r\n  spirit.... It is proverbial in Persia that the Bakhtiyaris have\r\n  been compelled to forego altogether the reading of the _Fatihah_\r\n  or prayer for the dead, for otherwise they would have no other\r\n  occupation. They are also most dextrous and notorious thieves.”\r\n  (_J. R. G. S._ IX. 105.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The Persians have always been lax in regard to the\r\n  abstinence from wine.\r\n\r\n  According to Athenaeus, Aristotle, in his _Treatise on Drinking_\r\n  (a work lost, I imagine, to posterity), says, “If the wine be\r\n  moderately boiled it is less apt to intoxicate.” In the preparation\r\n  of some of the sweet wines of the Levant, such as that of Cyprus,\r\n  the must is boiled, but I believe this is not the case _generally_\r\n  in the East. Baber notices it as a peculiarity among the Kafirs\r\n  of the Hindu Kush. Tavernier, however, says that at Shíráz,\r\n  besides the wine for which that city was so celebrated, a good\r\n  deal of _boiled wine_ was manufactured, and used among the poor\r\n  and by travellers. No doubt what is meant is the sweet liquor or\r\n  syrup called _Dúsháb_, which Della Valle says is just the Italian\r\n  _Mostocotto_, but better, clearer, and not so mawkish (I. 689).\r\n  (_Yonge’s Athen._ X. 34; _Baber_, p. 145; _Tavernier_, Bk. V. ch.\r\n  xxi.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] The _Encyc. Britann._, article “Money,” gives the livre tournois of\r\n    this period as 18.17 francs. A French paper in _Notes and Queries_\r\n    (4th S. IV. 485) gives it under St. Lewis and Philip III. as\r\n    equivalent to 18.24 fr., and under Philip IV. to 17.95. And lastly,\r\n    experiment at the British Museum, made by the kind intervention of\r\n    my friend, Mr. E. Thomas, F.R.S., gave the weights of the _sols_ of\r\n    St. Lewis (1226–1270) and Philip IV. (1285–1314) respectively as 63\r\n    grains and 61½ grains of remarkably pure silver. These trials would\r\n    give the _livres_ (20 sols) as equivalent to 18.14 fr. and 17.70 fr.\r\n    respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                  CONCERNING THE GREAT CITY OF YASDI.\r\n\r\n\r\nYasdi also is properly in Persia; it is a good and noble city, and has\r\na great amount of trade. They weave there quantities of a certain silk\r\ntissue known as _Yasdi_, which merchants carry into many quarters to\r\ndispose of. The people are worshippers of Mahommet.{1}\r\n\r\nWhen you leave this city to travel further, you ride for seven days\r\nover great plains, finding harbour to receive you at three places only.\r\nThere are many fine woods [producing dates] upon the way, such as one\r\ncan easily ride through; and in them there is great sport to be had in\r\nhunting and hawking, there being partridges and quails and abundance\r\nof other game, so that the merchants who pass that way have plenty of\r\ndiversion. There are also wild asses, handsome creatures. At the end of\r\nthose seven marches over the plain you come to a fine kingdom which is\r\ncalled Kerman.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—YEZD, an ancient city, supposed by D’Anville to be the\r\n  _Isatichae_ of Ptolemy, is not called by Marco a kingdom, though\r\n  having a better title to the distinction than some which he classes\r\n  as such. The atabegs of Yezd dated from the middle of the 11th\r\n  century, and their Dynasty was permitted by the Mongols to continue\r\n  till the end of the 13th, when it was extinguished by Ghazan, and\r\n  the administration made over to the Mongol Diwan.\r\n\r\n  Yezd, in pre-Mahomedan times, was a great sanctuary of the Gueber\r\n  worship, though now it is a seat of fanatical Mahomedanism. It is,\r\n  however, one of the few places where the old religion lingers.\r\n  In 1859 there were reckoned 850 families of Guebers in Yezd and\r\n  fifteen adjoining villages, but they diminish rapidly.\r\n\r\n  [Heyd (_Com. du Levant_, II. p. 109) says the inhabitants of Yezd\r\n  wove the finest silk of Taberistan.—H. C.] The silk manufactures\r\n  still continue, and, with other weaving, employ a large part of\r\n  the population. The _Yazdi_, which Polo mentions, finds a place\r\n  in the Persian dictionaries, and is spoken of by D’Herbelot as\r\n  _Ḳumásh-i-Yezdi_, “Yezd stuff.” [“He [Nadir Shah] bestowed upon the\r\n  ambassador [Hakeem Ataleek, the prime minister of Abulfiez Khan,\r\n  King of Bokhara] a donation of a thousand mohurs of Hindostan,\r\n  twenty-five pieces of _Yezdy_ brocade, a rich dress, and a horse\r\n  with silver harness....” (_Memoirs of Khojah Abdulkurreem, a\r\n  Cashmerian of distinction ... transl. from the original Persian_,\r\n  by Francis Gladwin ... Calcutta, 1788, 8vo, p. 36.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Yezd is still a place of important trade, and carries on a thriving\r\n  commerce with India by Bandar Abbási. A visitor in the end of 1865\r\n  says: “The external trade appears to be very considerable, and the\r\n  merchants of Yezd are reputed to be amongst the most enterprising\r\n  and respectable of their class in Persia. Some of their agents have\r\n  lately gone, not only to Bombay, but to the Mauritius, Java, and\r\n  China.”\r\n\r\n  (_Ilch._ I. 67–68; _Khanikoff, Mém._ p. 202; _Report by Major R. M.\r\n  Smith_, R.E.)\r\n\r\n  Friar Odoric, who visited Yezd, calls it the third best city of\r\n  the Persian Emperor, and says (_Cathay_, I. p. 52): “There is very\r\n  great store of victuals and all other good things that you can\r\n  mention; but especially is found there great plenty of figs; and\r\n  raisins also, green as grass and very small, are found there in\r\n  richer profusion than in any other part of the world.” [He also\r\n  gives from the smaller version of Ramusio’s an awful description of\r\n  the Sea of Sand, one day distant from Yezd. (Cf. Tavernier, 1679,\r\n  I. p. 116.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—I believe Della Valle correctly generalises when he says\r\n  of Persian travelling that “you always travel in a plain, but you\r\n  always have mountains on either hand” (I. 462). [Compare Macgregor,\r\n  I. 254: “I really cannot describe the road. Every road in Persia as\r\n  yet seems to me to be exactly alike, so ... my readers will take\r\n  it for granted that the road went over a waste, with barren rugged\r\n  hills in the distance, or near; no water, no houses, no people\r\n  passed.”—H. C.] The distance from Yezd to Kermán is, according to\r\n  Khanikoff’s survey, 314 _kilomètres_, or about 195 miles. Ramusio\r\n  makes the time eight days, which is probably the better reading,\r\n  giving a little over 24 miles a day. Westergaard in 1844, and\r\n  Khanikoff in 1859, took _ten_ days; Colonel Goldsmid and Major\r\n  Smith in 1865 _twelve_. [“The distance from Yezd to Kermán by the\r\n  present high road, 229 miles, is by caravans, generally made in\r\n  nine stages; persons travelling with all comforts do it in twelve\r\n  stages; travellers whose time is of some value do it easily in\r\n  _seven_ days.” (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ pp. 490–491.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Khanikoff observes on this chapter: “This notice of woods easy to\r\n  ride through, covering the plain of Yezd, is very curious. Now\r\n  you find it a plain of great extent indeed from N.W. to S.E., but\r\n  narrow and arid; indeed I saw in it only thirteen inhabited spots,\r\n  counting two caravanserais. Water for the inhabitants is brought\r\n  from a great distance by subterraneous conduits, a practice which\r\n  may have tended to desiccate the soil, for every trace of wood has\r\n  completely disappeared.”\r\n\r\n  Abbott travelled from Yezd to Kermán in 1849, by a road through\r\n  Báfk, _east_ of the usual road, which Khanikoff followed,\r\n  and parallel to it; and it is worthy of note that he found\r\n  circumstances more accordant with Marco’s description. Before\r\n  getting to Báfk he says of the plain that it “extends to a great\r\n  distance north and south, and is probably 20 miles in breadth;”\r\n  whilst Báfk “is remarkable for its _groves of date-trees_, in the\r\n  midst of which it stands, and which occupy a considerable space.”\r\n  Further on he speaks of “wild tufts and bushes growing abundantly,”\r\n  and then of “thickets of the _Ghez_ tree.” He heard of the wild\r\n  asses, but did not see any. In his report to the Foreign Office,\r\n  alluding to Marco Polo’s account, he says: “It is still true that\r\n  wild asses and other game are found in the _wooded spots_ on the\r\n  road.” The ass is the _Asinus Onager_, the _Gor Khar_ of Persia,\r\n  or _Kulan_ of the Tartars. (_Khan. Mém._ p. 200; _Id. sur Marco\r\n  Polo_, p. 21; _J. R. G. S._ XXV. 20–29; _Mr. Abbott’s MS. Report in\r\n  Foreign office_.) [The difficulty has now been explained by General\r\n  Houtum-Schindler in a valuable paper published in the _Jour. Roy.\r\n  As. Soc._ N.S. XIII., October, 1881, p. 490. He says: “Marco Polo\r\n  travelled from Yazd to Kermán _viâ_ Báfk. His description of the\r\n  road, seven days over great plains, harbour at three places only,\r\n  is perfectly exact. The fine woods, producing dates, are at Báfk\r\n  itself. (The place is generally called Báft.) Partridges and quails\r\n  still abound; wild asses I saw several on the western road, and I\r\n  was told that there were a great many on the Báfk road. Travellers\r\n  and caravans now always go by the eastern road _viâ_ Anár and\r\n  Bahrámábád. Before the Sefavíehs (_i.e._ before A.D. 1500) the\r\n  Anár road was hardly, if ever, used; travellers always took the\r\n  Báfk road. The country from Yazd to Anár, 97 miles, seems to have\r\n  been totally uninhabited before the Sefavíehs. Anár, as late as\r\n  A.D. 1340, is mentioned as the frontier place of Kermán to the\r\n  north, on the confines of the Yazd desert. When Sháh Abbás had\r\n  caravanserais built at three places between Yazd and Anár (Zein\r\n  ud-dín, Kermán-sháhán, and Shamsh), the eastern road began to be\r\n  neglected.” (Cf. Major Sykes’ _Persia_, ch. xxiii.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                   CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF KERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nKerman is a kingdom which is also properly in Persia, and formerly\r\nit had a hereditary prince. Since the Tartars conquered the country\r\nthe rule is no longer hereditary, but the Tartar sends to administer\r\nwhatever lord he pleases.{1} In this kingdom are produced the stones\r\ncalled turquoises in great abundance; they are found in the mountains,\r\nwhere they are extracted from the rocks.{2} There are also plenty of\r\nveins of steel and _Ondanique_.{3} The people are very skilful in\r\nmaking harness of war; their saddles, bridles, spurs, swords, bows,\r\nquivers, and arms of every kind, are very well made indeed according\r\nto the fashion of those parts. The ladies of the country and their\r\ndaughters also produce exquisite needlework in the embroidery of silk\r\nstuffs in different colours, with figures of beasts and birds, trees\r\nand flowers, and a variety of other patterns. They work hangings for\r\nthe use of noblemen so deftly that they are marvels to see, as well as\r\ncushions, pillows quilts, and all sorts of things.{4}\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Kerman are found the best falcons in the world.\r\nThey are inferior in size to the Peregrine, red on the breast, under\r\nthe neck, and between the thighs; their flight so swift that no bird\r\ncan escape them.{5}\r\n\r\nOn quitting the city you ride on for seven days, always finding towns,\r\nvillages, and handsome dwelling-houses, so that it is very pleasant\r\ntravelling; and there is excellent sport also to be had by the way in\r\nhunting and hawking. When you have ridden those seven days over a plain\r\ncountry, you come to a great mountain; and when you have got to the top\r\nof the pass you find a great descent which occupies some two days to\r\ngo down. All along you find a variety and abundance of fruits; and in\r\nformer days there were plenty of inhabited places on the road, but now\r\nthere are none; and you meet with only a few people looking after their\r\ncattle at pasture. From the city of Kerman to this descent the cold in\r\nwinter is so great that you can scarcely abide it, even with a great\r\nquantity of clothing.{6}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Kermán is mentioned by Ptolemy, and also by Ammianus\r\n  amongst the cities of the country so called (_Carmania_): “_inter\r\n  quas nitet_ Carmana _omnium mater_.” (XXIII. 6.)\r\n\r\n  M. Pauthier’s supposition that _Sirján_ was in Polo’s time the\r\n  capital, is incorrect. (See _N. et E._ XIV. 208, 290.) Our Author’s\r\n  Kermán is the city still so called; and its proper name would seem\r\n  to have been _Kuwáshír_. (See _Reinaud, Mém. sur l’Inde_, 171; also\r\n  _Sprenger P. and R. R._ 77.) According to Khanikoff it is 5535 feet\r\n  above the sea.\r\n\r\n  Kermán, on the fall of the Beni Búya Dynasty, in the middle of the\r\n  11th century, came into the hands of a branch of the Seljukian\r\n  Turks, who retained it till the conquests of the Kings of Khwarizm,\r\n  which just preceded the Mongol invasion. In 1226 the Amir Borák,\r\n  a Kara Khitaian, who was governor on behalf of Jaláluddin of\r\n  Khwarizm, became independent under the title of Kutlugh Sultan.\r\n  [He died in 1234.] The Mongols allowed this family to retain the\r\n  immediate authority, and at the time when Polo returned from China\r\n  the representative of the house was a lady known as the _Pádishah\r\n  Khátún_ [who reigned from 1291], the wife successively of the\r\n  Ilkhans Abaka and Kaikhatu; an ambitious, clever, and masterful\r\n  woman, who put her own brother Siyurgutmish to death as a rival,\r\n  and was herself, after the decease of Kaikhatu, put to death by\r\n  her brother’s widow and daughter [1294]. The Dynasty continued,\r\n  nominally at least, to the reign of the Ilkhan Khodabanda\r\n  (1304–13), when it was extinguished. [See Major Sykes’ _Persia_,\r\n  chaps, v. and xxiii.]\r\n\r\n  Kermán was a Nestorian see, under the Metropolitan of Fars. (_Ilch.\r\n  passim; Weil_, III. 454; _Lequien_, II. 1256.)\r\n\r\n  [“There is some confusion with regard to the names of Kermán both\r\n  as a town and as a province or kingdom. We have the names Kermán,\r\n  Kuwáshír, Bardshír. I should say the original name of the whole\r\n  country was Kermán, the ancient Karamania. A province of this was\r\n  called Kúreh-i-Ardeshír, which, being contracted, became Kuwáshír,\r\n  and is spoken of as the province in which Ardeshír Bábekán, the\r\n  first Sassanian monarch, resided. A part of Kúreh-i-Ardeshír was\r\n  called Bardshír, or Bard-i-Ardeshír, now occasionally Bardsír,\r\n  and the present city of Kermán was situated at its north-eastern\r\n  corner. This town, during the Middle Ages, was called Bardshír.\r\n  On a coin of Qara Arslán Beg, King of Kermán, of A.H. 462, Mr.\r\n  Stanley Lane Poole reads Yazdashír instead of Bardshír. Of Al\r\n  Idrísí’s Yazdashír I see no mention in histories; Bardshír was\r\n  the capital and the place where most of the coins were struck.\r\n  Yazdashír, if such a place existed, can only have been a place of\r\n  small importance. It is, perhaps, a clerical error for Bardshír;\r\n  without diacritical points, both words are written alike. Later,\r\n  the name of the city became Kermán, the name Bardshír reverting\r\n  to the district lying south-west of it, with its principal place\r\n  Mashíz. In a similar manner Mashíz was often, and is so now,\r\n  called Bardshír. Another old town sometimes confused with Bardshír\r\n  was Sírján or Shírján, once more important than Bardshír; it is\r\n  spoken of as the capital of Kermán, of Bardshír, and of Sardsír.\r\n  Its name now exists only as that of a district, with principal\r\n  place S’aídábád. The history of Kermán, ’Agd-ul-’Olá, plainly\r\n  says Bardshír is the capital of Kermán, and from the description\r\n  of Bardshír there is no doubt of its having been the present town\r\n  Kermán. It is strange that Marco Polo does not give the name of\r\n  the city. In Assemanni’s _Bibliotheca Orientalis_ Kuwáshír and\r\n  Bardashír are mentioned as separate cities, the latter being\r\n  probably the old Mashíz, which as early as A.H. 582 (A.D. 1186)\r\n  is spoken of in the _History of Kermán_ as an important town.\r\n  The Nestorian bishop of the province Kermán, who stood under the\r\n  Metropolitan of Fars, resided at Hormúz.” (_Houtum-Schindler_,\r\n  _l.c._ pp. 491–492.)\r\n\r\n  There does not seem any doubt as to the identity of Bardashir with\r\n  the present city of Kermán. (See _The Cities of Kirmān in the\r\n  time of Hamd-Allah Mustawfi and Marco Polo_, by Guy le Strange,\r\n  _Jour. R. As. Soc._ April, 1901, pp. 281, 290.) Hamd-Allah is\r\n  the author of the Cosmography known as the _Nuzhat-al-Kūlūb_ or\r\n  “Heart’s Delight.” (Cf. Major Sykes’ _Persia_, chap. xvi., and the\r\n  _Geographical Journal_ for February, 1902, p. 166.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—A MS. treatise on precious stones cited by Ouseley mentions\r\n  _Shebavek_ in Kermán as the site of a Turquoise mine. This is\r\n  probably _Shahr-i-Babek_, about 100 miles west of the city of\r\n  Kermán, and not far from _Párez_, where Abbott tells us there is\r\n  a mine of these stones, now abandoned. Goebel, one of Khanikoff’s\r\n  party, found a deposit of turquoises at Taft, near Yezd.\r\n  (_Ouseley’s Travels_, I. 211; _J. R. G. S._ XXVI. 63–65; _Khan.\r\n  Mém._ 203.)\r\n\r\n  [“The province Kermán is still rich in turquoises. The mines of\r\n  Páríz or Párez are at Chemen-i-mó-aspán, 16 miles from Páríz on the\r\n  road to Bahrámábád (principal place of Rafsinján), and opposite\r\n  the village or garden called Gód-i-Ahmer. These mines were worked\r\n  up to a few years ago; the turquoises were of a pale blue. Other\r\n  turquoises are found in the present Bardshír plain, and not far\r\n  from Mashíz, on the slopes of the Chehel tan mountain, opposite\r\n  a hill called the Bear Hill (tal-i-Khers). The Shehr-i-Bábek\r\n  turquoise mines are at the small village Kárík, a mile from\r\n  Medvár-i-Bálá, 10 miles north of Shehr-i-Bábek. They have two\r\n  shafts, one of which has lately been closed by an earthquake, and\r\n  were worked up to about twenty years ago. At another place, 12\r\n  miles from Shehr-i-Bábek, are seven old shafts now not worked for\r\n  a long period. The stones of these mines are also of a very pale\r\n  blue, and have no great value.” (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ 1881,\r\n  p. 491.)\r\n\r\n  The finest turquoises came from Khorasan; the mines were near\r\n  Maaden, about 48 miles to the north of Nishapūr. (Heyd, _Com. du\r\n  Levant_, II. p. 653; Ritter, _Erdk._ pp. 325–330.)\r\n\r\n  It is noticeable that Polo does not mention indigo at Kermán.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Edrisi says that excellent iron was produced in the “cold\r\n  mountains” N.W. of Jiruft, _i.e._ somewhere south of the capital;\r\n  and _Jihán Numá_, or Great Turkish Geography, that the steel mines\r\n  of Niriz, on the borders of Kermán, were famous. These are also\r\n  spoken of by Teixeira. Major St. John enables me to indicate their\r\n  position, in the hills east of Niriz. (_Edrisi_, vol. i. p. 430;\r\n  _Hammer, Mém. sur la Perse_, p. 275; _Teixeira, Relaciones_, p.\r\n  378; and see Map of Itineraries, No. II.)\r\n\r\n  [“Marco Polo’s steel mines are probably the Parpa iron mines on\r\n  the road from Kermán to Shíráz, called even to-day M’aden-i-fúlád\r\n  (steel mine); they are not worked now. Old Kermán weapons, daggers,\r\n  swords, old stirrups, etc., made of steel, are really beautiful,\r\n  and justify Marco Polo’s praise of them” (_Houtum-Schindler_,\r\n  _l.c._ p. 491.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  _Ondanique_ of the Geog. Text, _Andaine_ of Pauthier’s, _Andanicum_\r\n  of the Latin, is an expression on which no light has been thrown\r\n  since Ramusio’s time. The latter often asked the Persian merchants\r\n  who visited Venice, and they all agreed in stating that it was a\r\n  sort of steel of such surpassing value and excellence, that in the\r\n  days of yore a man who possessed a mirror, or sword, of _Andanic_\r\n  regarded it as he would some precious jewel. This seems to me\r\n  excellent evidence, and to give the true clue to the meaning of\r\n  _Ondanique_. I have retained the latter form because it points\r\n  most distinctly to what I believe to be the real word, viz.\r\n  _Hundwáníy_, “Indian Steel.”[1] (See _Johnson’s Pers. Dict._ and\r\n  _De Sacy’s Chrestomathie Arabe_, II. 148.) In the _Vocabulista\r\n  Arabico_, of about A.D. 1200 (Florence, 1871, p. 211), _Hunduwán_\r\n  is explained by _Ensis_. Vüllers explains _Hundwán_ as “anything\r\n  peculiar to India, especially swords,” and quotes from Firdúsi,\r\n  “_Khanjar-i-Hundwán_,” a hanger of Indian steel.\r\n\r\n  The like expression appears in the quotation from Edrisi below\r\n  as _Hindiah_, and found its way into Spanish in the shapes of\r\n  _Alhinde, Alfinde, Alinde_, first with the meaning of _steel_, then\r\n  assuming, that of _steel mirror_, and finally that of metallic\r\n  foil of a glass mirror. (See _Dozy_ and _Engelmann_, 2d ed. pp.\r\n  144–145.) _Hint_ or _Al-hint_ is used in Berber also for steel.\r\n  (See _J. R. A. S._ IX. 255.)\r\n\r\n  The sword-blades of India had a great fame over the East, and\r\n  Indian steel, according to esteemed authorities, continued to be\r\n  imported into Persia till days quite recent. Its fame goes back\r\n  to very old times. Ctesias mentions two wonderful swords of such\r\n  material that he got from the king of Persia and his mother. It\r\n  is perhaps the _ferrum candidum_ of which the Malli and Oxydracae\r\n  sent a 100 talents weight as a present to Alexander.[2] Indian\r\n  Iron and Steel (σíδηρος Ἰνδικòς καì στóμωμα) are mentioned in the\r\n  _Periplus_ as imports into the Abyssinian ports. _Ferrum Indicum_\r\n  appears (at least according to one reading) among the Oriental\r\n  _species_ subject to duty in the Law of Marcus Aurelius and\r\n  Commodus on that matter. Salmasius notes that among surviving Greek\r\n  chemical treatises there was one περì βαφῆς Ἰνδικοῦ σιδήρου, “On\r\n  the Tempering of Indian Steel.” Edrisi says on this subject: “The\r\n  Hindus excel in the manufacture of iron, and in the preparation of\r\n  those ingredients along with which it is fused to obtain that kind\r\n  of soft Iron which is usually styled _Indian Steel_ (HINDIAH).[3]\r\n  They also have workshops wherein are forged the most famous sabres\r\n  in the world.... It is impossible to find anything to surpass the\r\n  edge that you get from Indian Steel (_al-hadíd al-Hindí_).”\r\n\r\n  Allusions to the famous sword-blades of India would seem to be\r\n  frequent in Arabic literature. Several will be found in Hamása’s\r\n  collection of ancient Arabic poems translated by Freytag. The old\r\n  commentator on one of these passages says: “_Ut optimos gladios\r\n  significet_ ... Indicos _esse dixit_,” and here the word used in\r\n  the original is _Hundwániyah_. In Manger’s version of Arabshah’s\r\n  _Life of Timur_ are several allusions of the same kind; one, a\r\n  quotation from _Antar_, recalls the _ferrum candidum_ of Curtius:\r\n\r\n      “Albi (gladii) Indici _meo in sanguine abluuntur_.”\r\n\r\n  In the histories, even of the Mahomedan conquest of India, the\r\n  Hindu infidels are sent to _Jihannam_ with “the well-watered blade\r\n  of the Hindi sword”; or the sword is personified as “a Hindu of\r\n  good family.” Coming down to later days, Chardin says of the steel\r\n  of Persia: “They combine it with Indian steel, which is more\r\n  tractable ... and is much more esteemed.” Dupré, at the beginning\r\n  of this century, tells us: “I used to believe ... that the steel\r\n  for the famous Persian sabres came from certain mines in Khorasan.\r\n  But according to all the information I have obtained, I can assert\r\n  that no mine of steel exists in that province. What is used for\r\n  these blades comes in the shape of disks from Lahore.” Pottinger\r\n  names _steel_ among the imports into Kermán from India. Elphinstone\r\n  the Accurate, in his _Caubul_, confirms Dupré: “Indian Steel [in\r\n  Afghanistan] is most prized for the material; but the best swords\r\n  are made in Persia and in Syria;” and in his _History of India_, he\r\n  repeats: “The steel of India was in request with the ancients; it\r\n  is celebrated in the oldest Persian poem, and is still the material\r\n  of the scimitars of Khorasan and Damascus.”[4]\r\n\r\n  Klaproth, in his _Asia Polyglotta_, gives _Andun_ as the Ossetish\r\n  and _Andan_ as the Wotiak, for Steel. Possibly these are\r\n  essentially the same with _Hundwáníy_ and _Alhinde_, pointing to\r\n  India as the original source of supply. [In the _Sikandar Nāma,e\r\n  Bará_ (or “Book of Alexander the Great,” written A.D. 1200, by Abū\r\n  Muhammad bin Yusuf bin Mu,Ayyid-i-Nizāmu-’d-Dīn), translated by\r\n  Captain H. Wilberforce Clarke (Lond., 1881, large 8vo), steel is\r\n  frequently mentioned: Canto xix. 257, p. 202; xx. 12, p. 211; xlv.\r\n  38, p. 567; lviii. 32, pp. 695, 42, pp. 697, 62, 66, pp. 699; lix.\r\n  28, p. 703.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Avicenna, in his fifth book _De Animâ_, according to Roger Bacon,\r\n  distinguishes three very different species of iron: “1st. Iron\r\n  which is good for striking or bearing heavy strokes, and for being\r\n  forged by hammer and fire, but not for cutting-tools. Of this\r\n  hammers and anvils are made, and this is what we commonly call\r\n  _Iron_ simply. 2nd. That which is purer, has more heat in it, and\r\n  is better adapted to take an edge and to form cutting-tools, but is\r\n  not so malleable, viz. _Steel_. And the 3rd is that which is called\r\n  ANDENA. This is less known among the Latin nations. Its special\r\n  character is that like silver it is malleable and ductile under a\r\n  very low degree of heat. In other properties it is intermediate\r\n  between iron and steel.” (_Fr. R. Baconis Opera Inedita_, 1859,\r\n  pp. 382–383.) The same passage, apparently, of Avicenna is quoted\r\n  by Vincent of Beauvais, but with considerable differences. (See\r\n  _Speculum Naturale_, VII. ch. lii. lx., and _Specul. Doctrinale_,\r\n  XV. ch. lxiii.) The latter author writes _Alidena_, and I have not\r\n  been able to refer to Avicenna, so that I am doubtful whether his\r\n  _Andena_ is the same term with the _Andaine_ of Pauthier and our\r\n  _Ondanique_.\r\n\r\n  The popular view, at least in the Middle Ages, seems to have\r\n  regarded _Steel_ as a distinct natural species, the product of\r\n  a necessarily different _ore_, from iron; and some such view\r\n  is, I suspect, still common in the East. An old Indian officer\r\n  told me of the reply of a native friend to whom he had tried\r\n  to explain the conversion of iron into steel—“What! You would\r\n  have me believe that if I put an ass into the furnace it will\r\n  come forth a horse.” And Indian Steel again seems to have been\r\n  regarded as a distinct natural species from ordinary steel. It is\r\n  in fact made by a peculiar but simple process, by which the iron\r\n  is converted _directly_ into cast-steel, without passing through\r\n  any intermediate stage analogous to that of _blister-steel_. When\r\n  specimens were first examined in England, chemists concluded that\r\n  the steel was made direct from the _ore_. The _Ondanique_ of\r\n  Marco no doubt was a fine steel resembling the Indian article.\r\n  (_Müller’s Ctesias_, p. 80; _Curtius_, IX. 24; _Müller’s Geog. Gr.\r\n  Min._ I. 262; _Digest. Novum_, Lugd. 1551, Lib. XXXIX. Tit. 4;\r\n  _Salmas. Ex. Plinian._ II. 763; _Edrisi_, I. 65–66; _J. R. S. A._\r\n  A. 387 _seqq._; _Hamasae Carmina_, I. 526; _Elliot_, II. 209, 394;\r\n  _Reynolds’s Utbi_, p. 216.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Texture, with Animals, etc., from a Cashmere Scarf in\r\n    the Indian Museum.\r\n\r\n    “=De deverses maineres laborés à bestes et ausiaus mout\r\n    richement.=”]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Paulus Jovius in the 16th century says, I know not on\r\n  what authority, that Kermán was then celebrated for the fine temper\r\n  of its steel in scimitars and lance-points. These were eagerly\r\n  bought at high prices by the Turks, and their quality was such that\r\n  one blow of a Kermán sabre would cleave an European helmet without\r\n  turning the edge. And I see that the phrase, “Kermání blade” is\r\n  used in poetry by Marco’s contemporary Amír Khusrú of Delhi. (_P.\r\n  Jov. Hist. of his own Time_, Bk. XIV.; _Elliot_, III. 537.)\r\n\r\n  There is, or was in Pottinger’s time, still a great manufacture\r\n  of _matchlocks_ at Kermán; but rose-water, shawls, and carpets\r\n  are the staples of the place now. Polo says nothing that points\r\n  to shawl-making, but it would seem from Edrisi that some such\r\n  manufacture already existed in the adjoining district of Bamm. It\r\n  is possible that the “hangings” spoken of by Polo may refer to\r\n  the carpets. I have seen a genuine Kermán carpet in the house of\r\n  my friend, Sir Bartle Frere. It is of very short pile, very even\r\n  and dense; the design, a combination of vases, birds, and floral\r\n  tracery, closely resembling the illuminated frontispiece of some\r\n  Persian MSS.\r\n\r\n  The shawls are inferior to those of Kashmir in exquisite softness,\r\n  but scarcely in delicacy of texture and beauty of design. In\r\n  1850, their highest quality did not exceed 30 _tomans_ (14_l._)\r\n  in price. About 2200 looms were employed on the fabric. A good\r\n  deal of Kermán wool called _Kurk_, goes _viâ_ Bandar Abbási and\r\n  Karáchi to Amritsar, where it is mixed with the genuine Tibetan\r\n  wool in the shawl manufacture. Several of the articles named in the\r\n  text, including _pardahs_ (“cortines”) are woven in shawl-fabric.\r\n  I scarcely think, however, that Marco would have confounded woven\r\n  shawl with needle embroidery. And Mr. Khanikoff states that the\r\n  silk embroidery, of which Marco speaks, is still performed with\r\n  great skill and beauty at Kermán. Our cut illustrates the textures\r\n  figured with animals, already noticed at p. 66.\r\n\r\n  The Guebers were numerous here at the end of last century, but they\r\n  are rapidly disappearing now. The Musulman of Kermán is, according\r\n  to Khanikoff, an epicurean gentleman, and even in regard to wine,\r\n  which is strong and plentiful, his divines are liberal. “In other\r\n  parts of Persia you find the scribblings on the walls of Serais to\r\n  consist of philosophical axioms, texts from the Koran, or abuse\r\n  of local authorities. From Kermán to Yezd you find only rhymes in\r\n  praise of fair ladies or good wine.”\r\n\r\n  (_Pottinger’s Travels_; _Khanik.

Both Mr. Abbott and Major Smith were\r\n  entertained with hawking by Persian hosts in this neighbourhood.\r\n  The late Sir O. St. John identifies the bird described as the\r\n  _Sháhín_ (Falco _Peregrinator_), one variety of which, the _Fársi_,\r\n  is abundant in the higher mountains of S. Persia. It is now little\r\n  used in that region, the _Terlán_ or goshawk being most valued, but\r\n  a few are caught and sent for sale to the Arabs of Oman. (_J. R. G.\r\n  S._ XXV. 50, 63, and _Major St. John’s Notes_.)\r\n\r\n  [“The fine falcons, ‘with red breasts and swift of flight,’ come\r\n  from Páríz. They are, however, very scarce, two or three only\r\n  being caught every year. A well-trained Páríz falcon costs from\r\n  30 to 50 tomans (12_l._ to 20_l._), as much as a good horse.”\r\n  (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ p. 491.) Major Sykes, _Persia_, ch.\r\n  xxiii., writes: “Marco Polo was evidently a keen sportsman, and his\r\n  description of the _Sháhin_, as it is termed, cannot be improved\r\n  upon.” Major Sykes has a list given him by a Khán of seven hawks of\r\n  the province, all black and white, except the _Sháhin_, which has\r\n  yellow eyes, and is the third in the order of size.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—We defer geographical remarks till the traveller reaches\r\n  Hormuz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A learned friend objects to Johnson’s _Hundwáníy_ = “Indian Steel,”\r\n    as too absolute; some word for _steel_ being wanted. Even if it\r\n    be so, I observe that in three places where Polo uses _Ondanique_\r\n    (here, ch. xxi., and ch. xlii.), the phrase is always “_steel\r\n    and ondanique_.” This looks as if his mental expression were\r\n    _Púlád-i-Hundwáni_, rendered by an idiom like Virgil’s _pocula et\r\n    aurum_.\r\n\r\n[2] Kenrick suggests that the “bright iron” mentioned by Ezekiel among\r\n    the wares of Tyre (ch. xxvii. 19) can hardly have been anything else\r\n    than Indian Steel, because named with cassia and _calamus_.\r\n\r\n[3] Literally rendered by Mr. Redhouse: “The Indians do well the\r\n    combining of mixtures of the chemicals with which they (smelt and)\r\n    cast the soft iron, and it becomes _Indian_ (steel), being referred\r\n    to India (in this expression).”\r\n\r\n[4] In _Richardson’s Pers. Dict._, by Johnson, we have a word _Rohan,\r\n    Rohina_ (and other forms). “The finest Indian steel, of which the\r\n    most excellent swords are made; also the swords made of that steel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n        OF THE CITY OF CAMADI AND ITS RUINS; ALSO TOUCHING THE\r\n                           CARAUNA ROBBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you have ridden down hill those two days, you find yourself in a\r\nvast plain, and at the beginning thereof there is a city called CAMADI,\r\nwhich formerly was a great and noble place, but now is of little\r\nconsequence, for the Tartars in their incursions have several times\r\nravaged it. The plain whereof I speak is a very hot region; and the\r\nprovince that we now enter is called REOBARLES.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the country are dates, pistachioes, and apples of\r\nParadise, with others of the like not found in our cold climate. [There\r\nare vast numbers of turtledoves, attracted by the abundance of fruits,\r\nbut the Saracens never take them, for they hold them in abomination.]\r\nAnd on this plain there is a kind of bird called francolin, but\r\ndifferent from the francolin of other countries, for their colour is\r\na mixture of black and white, and the feet and beak are vermilion\r\ncolour.{1}\r\n\r\nThe beasts also are peculiar; and first I will tell you of their oxen.\r\nThese are very large, and all over white as snow; the hair is very\r\nshort and smooth, which is owing to the heat of the country. The horns\r\nare short and thick, not sharp in the point; and between the shoulders\r\nthey have a round hump some two palms high. There are no handsomer\r\ncreatures in the world. And when they have to be loaded, they kneel\r\nlike the camel; once the load is adjusted, they rise. Their load is a\r\nheavy one, for they are very strong animals. Then there are sheep here\r\nas big as asses; and their tails are so large and fat, that one tail\r\nshall weigh some 30 lbs. They are fine fat beasts, and afford capital\r\nmutton.{2}\r\n\r\nIn this plain there are a number of villages and towns which have\r\nlofty walls of mud, made as a defence against the banditti,{3} who are\r\nvery numerous, and are called CARAONAS. This name is given them because\r\nthey are the sons of Indian mothers by Tartar fathers. And you must\r\nknow that when these Caraonas wish to make a plundering incursion, they\r\nhave certain devilish enchantments whereby they do bring darkness over\r\nthe face of day, insomuch that you can scarcely discern your comrade\r\nriding beside you; and this darkness they will cause to extend over a\r\nspace of seven days’ journey. They know the country thoroughly, and\r\nride abreast, keeping near one another, sometimes to the number of\r\n10,000, at other times more or fewer. In this way they extend across\r\nthe whole plain that they are going to harry, and catch every living\r\nthing that is found outside of the towns and villages; man, woman, or\r\nbeast, nothing can escape them! The old men whom they take in this way\r\nthey butcher; the young men and the women they sell for slaves in other\r\ncountries; thus the whole land is ruined, and has become well-nigh a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThe King of these scoundrels is called NOGODAR. This Nogodar had gone\r\nto the Court of Chagatai, who was own brother to the Great Kaan, with\r\nsome 10,000 horsemen of his, and abode with him; for Chagatai was\r\nhis uncle. And whilst there this Nogodar devised a most audacious\r\nenterprise, and I will tell you what it was. He left his uncle who\r\nwas then in Greater Armenia, and fled with a great body of horsemen,\r\ncruel unscrupulous fellows, first through BADASHAN, and then through\r\nanother province called PASHAI-DIR, and then through another called\r\nARIORA-KESHEMUR. There he lost a great number of his people and of\r\nhis horses, for the roads were very narrow and perilous. And when he\r\nhad conquered all those provinces, he entered India at the extremity\r\nof a province called DALIVAR. He established himself in that city and\r\ngovernment, which he took from the King of the country, ASEDIN SOLDAN\r\nby name, a man of great power and wealth. And there abideth Nogodar\r\nwith his army, afraid of nobody, and waging war with all the Tartars in\r\nhis neighbourhood.{4}\r\n\r\nNow that I have told you of those scoundrels and their history, I\r\nmust add the fact that Messer Marco himself was all but caught by\r\ntheir bands in such a darkness as that I have told you of; but, as it\r\npleased God, he got off and threw himself into a village that was hard\r\nby, called CONOSALMI. Howbeit he lost his whole company except seven\r\npersons who escaped along with him. The rest were caught, and some of\r\nthem sold, some put to death.{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Ramusio has “Adam’s apple” for apples of Paradise. This was\r\n  some kind of _Citrus_, though Lindley thinks it impossible to say\r\n  precisely what. According to Jacques de Vitry it was a beautiful\r\n  fruit of the Citron kind, in which the bite of human teeth was\r\n  plainly discernible. (Note to _Vulgar Errors_, II. 211; _Bongars_,\r\n  I. 1099.) Mr. Abbott speaks of this tract as “the districts (of\r\n  Kermán) lying towards the South, which are termed the Ghermseer\r\n  or Hot Region, where the temperature of winter resembles that of\r\n  a charming spring, and where the palm, orange, and lemon-tree\r\n  flourish.” (_MS. Report_; see also _J. R. G. S._ XXV. 56.)\r\n\r\n  [“Marco Polo’s apples of Paradise are more probably the fruits of\r\n  the Konár tree. There are no plantains in that part of the country.\r\n  Turtle doves, now as then, are plentiful, and as they are seldom\r\n  shot, and are said by the people to be unwholesome food, we can\r\n  understand Marco Polo’s saying that the people do not eat them.”\r\n  (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ pp. 492–493.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The Francolin here spoken of is, as Major Smith tells me, the\r\n  _Darráj_ of the Persians, the _Black Partridge_ of English\r\n  sportsmen, sometimes called the Red-legged Francolin. The Darráj\r\n  is found in some parts of Egypt, where its peculiar call is\r\n  interpreted by the peasantry into certain Arabic words, meaning\r\n  “Sweet are the corn-ears! Praised be the Lord!” In India, Baber\r\n  tells us, the call of the Black Partridge was (less piously)\r\n  rendered “_Shír dáram shakrak_,” “I’ve got milk and sugar!” The\r\n  bird seems to be the ἀτταγὰς of Athenaeus, a fowl “speckled like\r\n  the partridge, but larger,” found in Egypt and Lydia. The Greek\r\n  version of its cry is the best of all: “τρìς τοῖς κακούργοις κακά”\r\n  (“Threefold ills to the ill-doers!”). This is really like the\r\n  call of the black partridge in India as I recollect it. [_Tetrao\r\n  francolinus_.—H.

The Aín Akbari also ascribes it\r\n  to a very fine breed in Bengal. The whimsical name _Zebu_, given to\r\n  the humped or Indian ox in books of Zoology, was taken by Buffon\r\n  from the exhibitors of such a beast at a French Fair, who probably\r\n  invented it. That the humped breeds of oxen existed in this part of\r\n  Asia in ancient times is shown by sculptures at Kouyunjik. (See cut\r\n  below.)\r\n\r\n  A letter from Agassiz, printed in the Proc. As. Soc. Bengal (1865),\r\n  refers to wild “zebus,” and calls the species a small one. There is\r\n  no wild “zebu,” and some of the breeds are of enormous size.\r\n\r\n  [“White oxen, with short thick horns and a round hump between the\r\n  shoulders, are now very rare between Kermán and Bender ’Abbás. They\r\n  are, however, still to be found towards Belúchistán and Mekrán,\r\n  and they kneel to be loaded like camels. The sheep which I saw had\r\n  fine large tails; I did not, however, hear of any having so high a\r\n  weight as thirty pounds.” (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ p. 493.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The fat-tailed sheep is well known in many parts of Asia and part\r\n  of Africa. It is mentioned by Ctesias, and by Ælian, who says\r\n  the shepherds used to extract the tallow from the live animal,\r\n  sewing up the tail again; exactly the same story is told by the\r\n  Chinese Pliny, Ma Twan-lin. Marco’s statements as to size do not\r\n  surpass those of the admirable Kämpfer: “In size they so much\r\n  surpass the common sheep that it is not unusual to see them as\r\n  tall as a donkey, whilst all are much more than three feet; and\r\n  as to the tail I shall not exceed the truth, though I may exceed\r\n  belief, if I say that it sometimes reaches 40 lbs. in weight.”\r\n  Captain Hutton was assured by an Afghan sheep-master that tails\r\n  had occurred in his flocks weighing 12 Tabriz _mans_, upwards of\r\n  76 lbs.! The Afghans use the fat as an aperient, swallowing a\r\n  dose of 4 to 6 lbs! Captain Hutton’s friend testified that trucks\r\n  to bear the sheep-tails were sometimes used among the Taimúnis\r\n  (north of Herat). This may help to locate that ancient and slippery\r\n  story. Josafat Barbaro says he had seen the thing, but is vague\r\n  as to place. (_Ælian Nat. An._ III. 3, IV. 32; _Amoen. Exoticae;\r\n  Ferrier_, H. of Afghans, p. 294; _J. A. S._ B.

(See _Cathay_, p. 287, note.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—This is a knotty subject, and needs a long note.\r\n\r\n  The ḲARAUNAHS are mentioned often in the histories of the Mongol\r\n  regime in Persia, first as a Mongol tribe forming a _Tuman_, _i.e._\r\n  a division or corps of 10,000 in the Mongol army (and I suspect it\r\n  was the phrase the _Tuman of the Ḳaraunahs_ in Marco’s mind that\r\n  suggested his repeated use of the number 10,000 in speaking of\r\n  them); and afterwards as daring and savage freebooters, scouring\r\n  the Persian provinces, and having their headquarters on the Eastern\r\n  frontiers of Persia. They are described as having had their\r\n  original seats on the mountains north of the Chinese wall near\r\n  _Ḳaraún Jidun_ or _Khidun_; and their special accomplishment in war\r\n  was the use of Naphtha Fire. Rashiduddin mentions the _Ḳaránut_ as\r\n  a branch of the great Mongol tribe of the Kunguráts, who certainly\r\n  had their seat in the vicinity named, so these may possibly be\r\n  connected with the Ḳaraunahs. The same author says that the Tuman\r\n  of the Ḳaraunahs formed the _Injú_ or _peculium_ of Arghún Khan.\r\n\r\n  Wassáf calls them “a kind of goblins rather than human beings, the\r\n  most daring of all the Mongols”; and Mirkhond speaks in like terms.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bird of Bombay, in discussing some of the Indo-Scythic coins\r\n  which bear the word _Korano_ attached to the prince’s name,\r\n  asserts this to stand for the name of the Ḳaraunah, “who were\r\n  a Græco-Indo-Scythic tribe of robbers in the Punjab, who are\r\n  mentioned by Marco Polo,” a somewhat hasty conclusion which\r\n  Pauthier adopts. There is, Quatremère observes, no mention of the\r\n  Ḳaraunahs before the Mongol invasion, and this he regards as the\r\n  great obstacle to any supposition of their having been a people\r\n  previously settled in Persia. Reiske, indeed, with no reference\r\n  to the present subject, quotes a passage from Hamza of Ispahan, a\r\n  writer of the 10th century, in which mention is made of certain\r\n  troops called _Ḳaráunahs_. But it seems certain that in this and\r\n  other like cases the real reading was _Kazáwinah_, people of\r\n  Kazvin. (See _Reiske’s Constant. Porphyrog._ Bonn. ed. II. 674;\r\n  _Gottwaldt’s Hamza Ispahanensis_, p. 161; and _Quatremère_ in _J.\r\n  A._ sér. V. tom. xv. 173.) Ibn Batuta only once mentions the name,\r\n  saying that Tughlak Sháh of Dehli was “one of those Turks called\r\n  _Ḳaráunas_ who dwell in the mountains between Sind and Turkestan.”\r\n  Hammer has suggested the derivation of the word _Carbine_ from\r\n  _Karáwinah_ (as he writes), and a link in such an etymology is\r\n  perhaps furnished by the fact that in the 16th century the word\r\n  _Carbine_ was used for some kind of irregular horseman.\r\n\r\n  (_Gold. Horde_, 214; _Ilch._ I. 17, 344, etc.; _Erdmann_, 168,\r\n  199, etc.; _J. A. S._ B. X. 96; _Q. R._ 130; _Not. et Ext._ XIV.\r\n  282; _I. B._ III. 201; _Ed. Webbe, his Travailes_, p. 17, 1590.\r\n  Reprinted 1868.)\r\n\r\n  As regards the account given by Marco of the origin of the\r\n  Caraonas, it seems almost necessarily a mistaken one. As Khanikoff\r\n  remarks, he might have confounded them with the Biluchis, whose\r\n  Turanian aspect (at least as regards the Brahuis) shows a strong\r\n  infusion of Turki blood, and who might be rudely described as\r\n  a cross between Tartars and Indians. It is indeed an odd fact\r\n  that the word _Karáni_ (vulgo _Cranny_) is commonly applied in\r\n  India at this day to the mixed race sprung from European fathers\r\n  and Native mothers, and this might be cited in corroboration of\r\n  Marsden’s reference to the Sanskrit _Karana_, but I suspect the\r\n  coincidence arises in another way. _Karana_ is the name applied\r\n  to a particular class of mixt blood, whose special occupation was\r\n  writing and accounts. But the prior sense of the word seems to have\r\n  been “clever, skilled,” and hence a writer or scribe. In this sense\r\n  we find _Karáni_ applied in Ibn Batuta’s day to a ship’s clerk,\r\n  and it is used in the same sense in the _Aín Akbari_. Clerkship is\r\n  also the predominant occupation of the East-Indians, and hence the\r\n  term Karáni is applied to them from their business, and not from\r\n  their mixt blood. We shall see hereafter that there is a Tartar\r\n  term _Arghún_, applied to fair children born of a Mongol mother\r\n  and _white_ father; it is possible that there may have been a\r\n  correlative word like _Ḳaráun_ (from _Ḳará_, black) applied to dark\r\n  children born of Mongol father and black mother, and that this led\r\n  Marco to a false theory.\r\n\r\n  [Major Sykes (_Persia_) devotes a chapter (xxiv.) to _The Karwán\r\n  Expedition_ in which he says: “Is it not possible that the Karwánis\r\n  are the Caraonas of Marco Polo? They are distinct from the\r\n  surrounding Baluchis, and pay no tribute.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Portrait of a Hazára.]\r\n\r\n  Let us turn now to the name of Nogodar. Contemporaneously with the\r\n  Ḳaraunahs we have frequent mention of predatory bands known as\r\n  _Nigúdaris_, who seem to be distinguished from the Ḳaraunahs, but\r\n  had a like character for truculence. Their headquarters were about\r\n  Sijistán, and Quatremère seems disposed to look upon them as a\r\n  tribe indigenous in that quarter. Hammer says they were originally\r\n  the troops of Prince Nigudar, grandson of Chaghatai, and that they\r\n  were a rabble of all sorts, Mongols, Turkmans, Kurds, Shúls, and\r\n  what not. We hear of their revolts and disorders down to 1319,\r\n  under which date Mirkhond says that there had been one-and-twenty\r\n  fights with them in four years. Again we hear of them in 1336 about\r\n  Herat, whilst in Baber’s time they turn up as _Nukdari_, fairly\r\n  established as tribes in the mountainous tracts of Karnúd and Ghúr,\r\n  west of Kabul, and coupled with the Hazáras, who still survive\r\n  both in name and character. “Among both,” says Baber, “there are\r\n  some who speak the Mongol language.” Hazáras and _Takdaris_ (read\r\n  _Nukdaris_) again occur coupled in the _History of Sind_. (See\r\n  _Elliot_, I. 303–304.) [On the struggle against Timur of Toumen,\r\n  veteran chief of the Nikoudrians (1383–84), see Major David Price’s\r\n  _Mahommedan History_, London, 1821, vol. iii. pp. 47–49, H. C.]\r\n  In maps of the 17th century, as of Hondius and Blaeuw, we find\r\n  the mountains north of Kabul termed _Nochdarizari_, in which we\r\n  cannot miss the combination Nigudar-Hazárah, whencesoever it was\r\n  got. The Hazáras are eminently Mongol in feature to this day,\r\n  and it is very probable that they or some part of them are the\r\n  descendants of the Ḳaráunahs or the Nigudaris, or of both, and that\r\n  the origination of the bands so called, from the scum of the Mongol\r\n  inundation, is thus in degree confirmed. The Hazáras generally are\r\n  said to speak an old dialect of Persian. But one tribe in Western\r\n  Afghanistan retains both the name of Mongols and a language of\r\n  which six-sevenths (judging from a vocabulary published by Major\r\n  Leech) appear to be Mongol. Leech says, too, that the Hazáras\r\n  generally are termed _Moghals_ by the Ghilzais. It is worthy of\r\n  notice that Abu’l Fázl, who also mentions the Nukdaris among the\r\n  nomad tribes of Kabul, says the Hazáras were the remains of the\r\n  Chaghataian army which Mangu Kaan sent to the aid of Hulaku, under\r\n  the command of Nigudar Oghlan. (_Not. et Ext._ XIV. 284; _Ilch._ I.\r\n  284, 309, etc,; _Baber_, 134, 136, 140; _J. As._ sér. IV. tom. iv.\r\n  98; _Ayeen Akbery_, II. 192–193.)\r\n\r\n  So far, excepting as to the doubtful point of the relation between\r\n  Ḳaráunahs and Nigudaris, and as to the origin of the former, we\r\n  have a general accordance with Polo’s representations. But it\r\n  is not very easy to identify with certainty the inroad on India\r\n  to which he alludes, or the person intended by Nogodar, nephew\r\n  of Chaghatai. It seems as if two persons of that name had each\r\n  contributed something to Marco’s history.\r\n\r\n  We find in Hammer and D’Ohsson that one of the causes which led\r\n  to the war between Barka Khan and Hulaku in 1262 (see above,\r\n  _Prologue_, ch. ii.) was the violent end that had befallen three\r\n  princes of the House of Juji, who had accompanied Hulaku to Persia\r\n  in command of the contingent of that House. When war actually\r\n  broke out, the contingent made their escape from Persia. One party\r\n  gained Kipchak by way of Derbend; another, in greater force, led\r\n  by NIGUDAR and Onguja, escaped to Khorasan, pursued by the troops\r\n  of Hulaku, and thence eastward, where they seized upon Ghazni and\r\n  other districts bordering on India.\r\n\r\n  But again: Nigudar Aghul, or Oghlan, son of (the younger) Juji, son\r\n  of _Chaghatai_, was the leader of the Chaghataian contingent in\r\n  Hulaku’s expedition, and was still attached to the Mongol-Persian\r\n  army in 1269, when Borrak Khan, of the House of Chaghatai, was\r\n  meditating war against his kinsman, Abaka of Persia. Borrak sent to\r\n  the latter an ambassador, who was the bearer of a secret message to\r\n  Prince Nigudar, begging him not to serve against the head of his\r\n  own House. Nigudar, upon this, made a pretext of retiring to his\r\n  own headquarters in _Georgia_, hoping to reach Borrak’s camp by\r\n  way of Derbend. He was, however, intercepted, and lost many of his\r\n  people. With 1000 horse he took refuge in Georgia, but was refused\r\n  an asylum, and was eventually captured by Abaka’s commander on that\r\n  frontier. His officers were executed, his troops dispersed among\r\n  Abaka’s army, and his own life spared under surveillance. I find\r\n  no more about him. In 1278 Hammer speaks of him as dead, and of\r\n  the Nigudarian bands as having been formed out of his troops. But\r\n  authority is not given.\r\n\r\n  The second Nigudar is evidently the one to whom Abu’l Fázl alludes.\r\n  Khanikoff assumes that the Nigudar who went off towards India\r\n  about 1260 (he puts the date earlier) was Nigudar, the grandson of\r\n  Chaghatai, but he takes no notice of the second story just quoted.\r\n\r\n  In the former story we have bands under _Nigudar_ going off by\r\n  Ghazni, _and conquering country on the Indian frontier_. In the\r\n  latter we have _Nigudar, a descendant of Chaghatai_, trying to\r\n  escape from his camp _on the frontier of Great Armenia_. Supposing\r\n  the Persian historians to be correct, it looks as if Marco had\r\n  rolled two stories into one.\r\n\r\n  Some other passages may be cited before quitting this part of\r\n  the subject. A chronicle of Herat, translated by Barbier de\r\n  Meynard, says, under 1298: “The King Fakhruddin (of Herat) had the\r\n  imprudence to authorise _the Amir Nigudar_ to establish himself\r\n  in a quarter of the city, with 300 adventurers from ’Irák. This\r\n  little troop made frequent raids in Kuhistan, Sijistan, Farrah,\r\n  etc., spreading terror. Khodabanda, at the request of his brother\r\n  Ghazan Khan, came from Mazanderan to demand the immediate surrender\r\n  of these brigands,” etc. And in the account of the tremendous\r\n  foray of the Chaghataian Prince Kotlogh Shah, on the east and south\r\n  of Persia in 1299, we find one of his captains called _Nigudar_\r\n  Bahadur. (_Gold. Horde_, 146, 157, 164; _D’Ohsson_, IV. 378 _seqq._,\r\n  433 _seqq._, 513 _seqq._; _Ilch._ I. 216, 261, 284; II. 104; _J. A._\r\n  sér. V. tom. xvii. 455–456, 507; _Khan. Notice_, 31.)\r\n\r\n  As regards the route taken by Prince Nogodar in his incursion into\r\n  India, we have no difficulty with BADAKHSHAN. PASHAI-DIR is a\r\n  copulate name; the former part, as we shall see reason to believe\r\n  hereafter, representing the country between the Hindu Kush and\r\n  the Kabul River (see _infra_, ch. xxx.); the latter (as Pauthier\r\n  already has pointed out), DIR, the chief town of Panjkora, in the\r\n  hill country north of Peshawar. In _Ariora-Keshemur_ the first\r\n  portion only is perplexing. I will mention the most probable of\r\n  the solutions that have occurred to me, and a second, due to\r\n  that eminent archæologist, General A. Cunningham. (1) _Ariora_\r\n  may be some corrupt or Mongol form of _Aryavartta_, a sacred\r\n  name applied to the Holy Lands of Indian Buddhism, of which\r\n  Kashmir was eminently one to the Northern Buddhists. _Oron_, in\r\n  Mongol, is a Region or Realm, and may have taken the place of\r\n  _Vartta_, giving _Aryoron_ or Ariora. (2) “_Ariora_,” General\r\n  Cunningham writes, “I take to be the _Harhaura_ of Sanscrit—_i.e._\r\n  the Western Panjáb. Harhaura was the North-Western Division of\r\n  the _Nava-Khanda_, or Nine Divisions of Ancient India. It is\r\n  mentioned between _Sindhu-Sauvira_ in the west (_i.e._ Sind), and\r\n  _Madra_ in the north (_i.e._the Eastern Panjáb, which is still\r\n  called _Madar-Des_). The name of Harhaura is, I think, preserved\r\n  in the Haro River. Now, the Sind-Sagor Doab formed a portion\r\n  of the kingdom of Kashmir, and the joint names, like those of\r\n  Sindhu-Sauvira, describe only one State.” The names of the Nine\r\n  Divisions in question are given by the celebrated astronomer,\r\n  Varaha Mihira, who lived in the beginning of the 6th century, and\r\n  are repeated by Al Biruni. (See _Reinaud, Mém. sur l’Inde_, p.\r\n  116.) The only objection to this happy solution seems to lie in\r\n  Al Biruni’s remark, that the names in question were in general no\r\n  longer used even in his time (A.D. 1030).\r\n\r\n  There can be no doubt that _Asidin Soldan_ is, as Khanikoff has\r\n  said, Ghaiassuddin Balban, Sultan of Delhi from 1266 to 1286, and\r\n  for years before that a man of great power in India, and especially\r\n  in the Panjáb, of which he had in the reign of Ruknuddin (1236)\r\n  held independent possession.\r\n\r\n  Firishta records several inroads of Mongols in the Panjáb during\r\n  the reign of Ghaiassuddin, in withstanding one of which that\r\n  King’s eldest son was slain; and there are constant indications of\r\n  their presence in Sind till the end of the century. But we find\r\n  in that historian no hint of the chief circumstances of this part\r\n  of the story, viz., the conquest of Kashmir and the occupation of\r\n  _Dalivar_ or _Dilivar_ (G. T.), evidently (whatever its identity)\r\n  in the plains of India. I do find, however, in the history of\r\n  Kashmir, as given by Lassen (III. 1138), that in the end of\r\n  1259, Lakshamana Deva, King of Kashmir, was killed in a campaign\r\n  against the _Turushka_ (Turks or Tartars), and that their leader,\r\n  who is called Kajjala, got hold of the country and held it till\r\n  1287.[1] It is difficult not to connect this both with Polo’s story\r\n  and with the escapade of Nigudar about 1260, noting also that\r\n  this occupation of Kashmir extended through the whole reign of\r\n  Ghaiassuddin.\r\n\r\n  We seem to have a memory of Polo’s story preserved in one of\r\n  Elliot’s extracts from Wassáf, which states that in 708 (A.D.\r\n  1308), after a great defeat of a Mongol inroad which had passed the\r\n  Ganges, Sultan Ala’uddin Khilji ordered a pillar of Mongol heads to\r\n  be raised before the Badáun gate, “_as was done with the_ Nigudari\r\n  _Moghuls_” (III. 48).\r\n\r\n  We still have to account for the occupation and locality of\r\n  _Dalivar_; Marsden supposed it to be _Lahore_; Khanikoff considers\r\n  it to be _Diráwal_, the ancient desert capital of the Bhattis,\r\n  properly (according to Tod) _Deoráwal_, but by a transposition\r\n  common in India, as it is in Italy, sometimes called _Diláwar_,\r\n  in the modern State of Bháwalpúr. But General Cunningham\r\n  suggests a more probable locality in DILÁWAR on the west bank\r\n  of the Jelam, close to Dárápúr, and opposite to Mung. These two\r\n  sites, Diláwar-Dárápúr on the west bank, and Mung on the east,\r\n  are identified by General Cunningham (I believe justly) with\r\n  Alexander’s Bucephala and Nicaea. The spot, which is just opposite\r\n  the battlefield of Chiliánwála, was visited (15th December, 1868)\r\n  at my request, by my friend Colonel R. Maclagan, R.E. He writes:\r\n  “The present village of Diláwar stands a little above the town of\r\n  Dárápúr (I mean on higher ground), looking down on Dárápúr and on\r\n  the river, and on the cultivated and wooded plain along the river\r\n  bank. The remains of the Old Diláwar, in the form of quantities\r\n  of large bricks, cover the low round-backed spurs and knolls of\r\n  the broken rocky hills around the present village, but principally\r\n  on the land side. They cover a large area of very irregular\r\n  character, and may clearly be held to represent a very considerable\r\n  town. There are no indications of the form of buildings, ... but\r\n  simply large quantities of large bricks, which for a long time\r\n  have been carried away and used for modern buildings.... After\r\n  rain coins are found on the surface.... There can be no doubt of\r\n  a very large extent of ground, of very irregular and uninviting\r\n  character, having been covered at some time with buildings. The\r\n  position on the Jelam would answer well for the Diláwar which the\r\n  Mongol invaders took and held.... The strange thing is that the\r\n  name should not be mentioned (I believe it is not) by any of the\r\n  well-known Mahomedan historians of India. So much for Diláwar....\r\n  The people have no traditions. But there are the remains; and\r\n  there is the name, borne by the existing village on part of the\r\n  old site.” I had come to the conclusion that this was almost\r\n  certainly Polo’s Dalivar, and had mapped it as such, before I\r\n  read certain passages in the _History of Zíyáuddín Barni_, which\r\n  have been translated by Professor Dowson for the third volume of\r\n  Elliot’s _India_. When the comrades of Ghaiassuddin Balban urged\r\n  him to conquests, the Sultan pointed to the constant danger from\r\n  the Mongols,[2] saying: “These accursed wretches have heard of\r\n  the wealth and condition of Hindustan, and have set their hearts\r\n  upon conquering and plundering it. _They have taken and plundered\r\n  Lahor within my territories, and no year passes that they do not\r\n  come here and plunder the villages_.... They even talk about the\r\n  conquest and sack of Delhi.” And under a later date the historian\r\n  says: “The Sultan ... marched to Lahor, and ordered the rebuilding\r\n  of the fort which the Mughals had destroyed in the reigns of the\r\n  sons of Shamsuddin. The towns and villages of Lahor which the\r\n  Mughals had devastated and laid waste he repeopled.” Considering\r\n  these passages, and the fact that Polo had no personal knowledge of\r\n  Upper India, I now think it probable that Marsden was right, and\r\n  that _Dilivar_ is really a misunderstanding of “_Città_ di Livar”\r\n  for _Lahàwar_ or Lahore.\r\n\r\n  The _Magical darkness_ which Marco ascribes to the evil arts of\r\n  the Karaunas is explained by Khanikoff from the phenomenon of _Dry\r\n  Fog_, which he has often experienced in Khorasan, combined with the\r\n  _Dust Storm_ with which we are familiar in Upper India. In Sind\r\n  these phenomena often produce a great degree of darkness. During a\r\n  battle fought between the armies of Sindh and Kachh in 1762, such a\r\n  fog came on, obscuring the light of day for some six hours, during\r\n  which the armies were intermixed with one another and fighting\r\n  desperately. When the darkness dispersed they separated, and the\r\n  consternation of both parties was so great at the events of the day\r\n  that both made a precipitate retreat. In 1844 this battle was still\r\n  spoken of with wonder. (_J. Bomb. Br. R. A. S._ I. 423.)\r\n\r\n  Major St. John has given a note on his own experience of these\r\n  curious Kermán fogs (see _Ocean Highways_, 1872, p. 286): “Not a\r\n  breath of air was stirring, and the whole effect was most curious,\r\n  and utterly unlike any other fog I have seen. No deposit of\r\n  dust followed, and the feeling of the air was decidedly damp. I\r\n  unfortunately could not get my hygrometer till the fog had cleared\r\n  away.”\r\n\r\n  [_General Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ p. 493, writes: “The magical\r\n  darkness might, as Colonel Yule supposes, be explained by\r\n  the curious dry fogs or dust storms, often occurring in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Kermán, but it must be remarked that Marco Polo\r\n  was caught in one of these storms down in Jíruft, where, according\r\n  to the people I questioned, such storms now never occur. On the\r\n  29th of September, 1879, at Kermán, a high wind began to blow from\r\n  S.S.W. at about 5 P.M. First there came thick heavy clouds of dust\r\n  with a few drops of rain. The heavy dust then settled down, the\r\n  lighter particles remained in the air, forming a dry fog of such\r\n  density that large objects, like houses, trees, etc., could not\r\n  even faintly be distinguished at a distance of a hundred paces. The\r\n  barometers suffered no change, the three I had with me remained\r\n  in _statu quo_.” “The heat is over by the middle of September,\r\n  and after the autumnal equinox, there are a few days of what is\r\n  best described as a dense dry fog. This was undoubtedly the haze\r\n  referred to by Marco Polo.” (_Major Sykes_, ch. iv.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Richthofen’s remarkable exposition of the phenomena of the _löss_\r\n  in North China, and of the sub-aerial deposits of the steppes and\r\n  of Central Asia throws some light on this. But this hardly applies\r\n  to St John’s experience of “no deposit of dust.” (See Richthofen,\r\n  _China_, pp. 96–97 s. _MS. Note_, H. Y.)\r\n\r\n  The belief that such opportune phenomena were produced by\r\n  enchantment was a thoroughly Tartar one. D’Herbelot relates (art.\r\n  _Giagathai_) that in an action with a rebel called Mahomed Tarabi,\r\n  the Mongols were encompassed by a dust storm which they attributed\r\n  to enchantment on the part of the enemy, and it so discouraged them\r\n  that they took to flight.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The specification that only _seven_ were saved from Marco’s\r\n  company is peculiar to Pauthier’s Text, not appearing in the G. T.\r\n\r\n  Several names compounded of _Salm_ or _Salmi_ occur on the dry\r\n  lands on the borders of Kermán. Edrisi, however (I. p. 428), names\r\n  a place called ḲANÁT-UL-SHÁM as the first march in going from\r\n  Jíruft to Walashjird. Walashjird is, I imagine, represented by\r\n  _Galashkird_, Major R. Smith’s third march from Jíruft (see my Map\r\n  of Routes from Kermán to Hormuz); and as such an indication agrees\r\n  with the view taken below of Polo’s route, I am strongly disposed\r\n  to identify Ḳanát-ul-Shám with his _castello_ or walled village of\r\n  _Canosalmi_.\r\n\r\n  [“Marco Polo’s Conosalmi, where he was attacked by robbers and lost\r\n  the greater part of his men, is perhaps the ruined town or village\r\n  Kamasal (Kahn-i-asal = the honey canal), near Kahnúj-i-pancheh\r\n  and Vakílábád in Jíruft. It lies on the direct road between\r\n  Shehr-i-Daqíánús (Camadi) and the Nevergún Pass. The road goes in\r\n  an almost due southerly direction. The Nevergún Pass accords with\r\n  Marco Polo’s description of it; it is very difficult, on account\r\n  of the many great blocks of sandstone scattered upon it. Its\r\n  proximity to the Bashakird mountains and Mekrán easily accounts for\r\n  the prevalence of robbers, who infested the place in Marco Polo’s\r\n  time. At the end of the Pass lies the large village Shamíl, with\r\n  an old fort; the distance thence to the site of Hormúz or Bender\r\n  ’Abbás (lying more to the west) is 52 miles, two days’ march. The\r\n  climate of Bender ’Abbás is very bad, strangers speedily fall sick,\r\n  two of my men died there, all the others were seriously ill.”\r\n  (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ pp. 495–496.) Major Sykes (ch. xxiii.)\r\n  says: “Two marches from Camadi was Kahn-i-Panchur, and a stage\r\n  beyond it lay the ruins of Fariáb or Pariáb, which was once a great\r\n  city, and was destroyed by a flood, according to local legend.\r\n  It may have been Alexander’s Salmous, as it is about the right\r\n  distance from the coast, and if so, could not have been Marco’s\r\n  _Cono Salmi_. Continuing on, Galashkird mentioned by Edrisi, is the\r\n  next stage.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The raids of the Mekranis and Biluchis long preceded those of the\r\n  Karaunas, for they were notable even in the time of Mahmud of\r\n  Ghazni, and they have continued to our own day to be prosecuted\r\n  nearly on the same stage and in the same manner. About 1721, 4000\r\n  horsemen of this description plundered the town of Bander Abbási,\r\n  whilst Captain Alex. Hamilton was in the port; and Abbott, in 1850,\r\n  found the dread of Bilúch robbers to extend almost to the gates\r\n  of Ispahan. A striking account of the Bilúch robbers and their\r\n  characteristics is given by General Ferrier. (See _Hamilton_, I.\r\n  109; _J. R. G. S._ XXV.; _Khanikoff’s Mémoire; Macd. Kinneir_, 196;\r\n  _Caravan Journeys_, p. 437 seq.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] _Khajlak_ is mentioned as a leader of the Mongol raids in India by\r\n    the poet Amir Khusrú (A.D. 1289; see _Elliot_ III. 527).\r\n\r\n[2] Professor Cowell compares the Mongol inroads in the latter part\r\n    of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, in their incessant\r\n    recurrence, to the incursions of the Danes in England. A passage\r\n    in Wassáf (_Elliot_, III. 38) shows that the Mongols were, _circa_\r\n    1254–55, already in occupation of Sodra on the Chenab, and districts\r\n    adjoining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                 OF THE DESCENT TO THE CITY OF HORMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plain of which we have spoken extends in a southerly direction\r\nfor five days’ journey, and then you come to another descent some\r\ntwenty miles in length, where the road is very bad and full of peril,\r\nfor there are many robbers and bad characters about. When you have\r\ngot to the foot of this descent you find another beautiful plain\r\ncalled the PLAIN OF FORMOSA. This extends for two days’ journey; and\r\nyou find in it fine streams of water with plenty of date-palms and\r\nother fruit-trees. There are also many beautiful birds, francolins,\r\npopinjays, and other kinds such as we have none of in our country.\r\nWhen you have ridden these two days you come to the Ocean Sea, and on\r\nthe shore you find a city with a harbour which is called HORMOS.{1}\r\nMerchants come thither from India, with ships loaded with spicery and\r\nprecious stones, pearls, cloths of silk and gold, elephants’ teeth, and\r\nmany other wares, which they sell to the merchants of Hormos, and which\r\nthese in turn carry all over the world to dispose of again. In fact,\r\n’tis a city of immense trade. There are plenty of towns and villages\r\nunder it, but it is the capital. The King is called RUOMEDAM AHOMET. It\r\nis a very sickly place, and the heat of the sun is tremendous. If any\r\nforeign merchant dies there, the King takes all his property.\r\n\r\nIn this country they make a wine of dates mixt with spices, which is\r\nvery good. When any one not used to it first drinks this wine, it\r\ncauses repeated and violent purging, but afterwards he is all the\r\nbetter for it, and gets fat upon it. The people never eat meat and\r\nwheaten bread except when they are ill, and if they take such food\r\nwhen they are in health it makes them ill. Their food when in health\r\nconsists of dates and salt-fish (tunny, to wit) and onions, and this\r\nkind of diet they maintain in order to preserve their health.{2}\r\n\r\nTheir ships are wretched affairs, and many of them get lost; for they\r\nhave no iron fastenings, and are only stitched together with twine made\r\nfrom the husk of the Indian nut. They beat this husk until it becomes\r\nlike horse-hair, and from that they spin twine, and with this stitch\r\nthe planks of the ships together. It keeps well, and is not corroded\r\nby the sea-water, but it will not stand well in a storm. The ships are\r\nnot pitched, but are rubbed with fish-oil. They have one mast, one\r\nsail, and one rudder, and have no deck, but only a cover spread over\r\nthe cargo when loaded. This cover consists of hides, and on the top of\r\nthese hides they put the horses which they take to India for sale. They\r\nhave no iron to make nails of, and for this reason they use only wooden\r\ntrenails in their shipbuilding, and then stitch the planks with twine\r\nas I have told you. Hence ’tis a perilous business to go a voyage in\r\none of those ships, and many of them are lost, for in that Sea of India\r\nthe storms are often terrible.{3}\r\n\r\nThe people are black, and are worshippers of Mahommet. The residents\r\navoid living in the cities, for the heat in summer is so great that\r\nit would kill them. Hence they go out (to sleep) at their gardens in\r\nthe country, where there are streams and plenty of water. For all that\r\nthey would not escape but for one thing that I will mention. The fact\r\nis, you see, that in summer a wind often blows across the sands which\r\nencompass the plain, so intolerably hot that it would kill everybody,\r\nwere it not that when they perceive that wind coming they plunge into\r\nwater up to the neck, and so abide until the wind have ceased.{4} [And\r\nto prove the great heat of this wind, Messer Mark related a case that\r\nbefell when he was there. The Lord of Hormos, not having paid his\r\ntribute to the King of Kerman the latter resolved to claim it at the\r\ntime when the people of Hormos were residing away from the city. So he\r\ncaused a force of 1600 horse and 5000 foot to be got ready, and sent\r\nthem by the route of Reobarles to take the others by surprise. Now,\r\nit happened one day that through the fault of their guide they were\r\nnot able to reach the place appointed for their night’s halt, and were\r\nobliged to bivouac in a wilderness not far from Hormos. In the morning\r\nas they were starting on their march they were caught by that wind, and\r\nevery man of them was suffocated, so that not one survived to carry the\r\ntidings to their Lord. When the people of Hormos heard of this they\r\nwent forth to bury the bodies lest they should breed a pestilence. But\r\nwhen they laid hold of them by the arms to drag them to the pits, the\r\nbodies proved to be so _baked_, as it were, by that tremendous heat,\r\nthat the arms parted from the trunks, and in the end the people had to\r\ndig graves hard by each where it lay, and so cast them in.]{5}\r\n\r\nThe people sow their wheat and barley and other corn in the month of\r\nNovember, and reap it in the month of March. The dates are not gathered\r\ntill May, but otherwise there is no grass nor any other green thing,\r\nfor the excessive heat dries up everything.\r\n\r\nWhen any one dies they make a great business of the mourning, for\r\nwomen mourn their husbands four years. During that time they mourn at\r\nleast once a day, gathering together their kinsfolk and friends and\r\nneighbours for the purpose, and making a great weeping and wailing.\r\n[And they have women who are mourners by trade, and do it for hire.]\r\n\r\nNow, we will quit this country. I shall not, however, now go on to tell\r\nyou about India; but when time and place shall suit we shall come round\r\nfrom the north and tell you about it. For the present, let us return\r\nby another road to the aforesaid city of Kerman, for we cannot get at\r\nthose countries that I wish to tell you about except through that city.\r\n\r\nI should tell you first, however, that King Ruomedam Ahomet of Hormos,\r\nwhich we are leaving, is a liegeman of the King of Kerman.{6}\r\n\r\nOn the road by which we return from Hormos to Kerman you meet with some\r\nvery fine plains, and you also find many natural hot baths; you find\r\nplenty of partridges on the road; and there are towns where victual\r\nis cheap and abundant, with quantities of dates and other fruits. The\r\nwheaten bread, however, is so bitter, owing to the bitterness of the\r\nwater, that no one can eat it who is not used to it. The baths that I\r\nmentioned have excellent virtues; they cure the itch and several other\r\ndiseases.{7}\r\n\r\nNow, then, I am going to tell you about the countries towards the\r\nnorth, of which you shall hear in regular order. Let us begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Having now arrived at HORMUZ, it is time to see what can be\r\n  made of the Geography of the route from Kermán to that port.\r\n\r\n  The port of Hormuz, [which had taken the place of Kish as the most\r\n  important market of the Persian Gulf (H. C.),] stood upon the\r\n  mainland. A few years later it was transferred to the island which\r\n  became so famous, under circumstances which are concisely related\r\n  by Abulfeda:—“Hormuz is the port of Kermán, a city rich in palms,\r\n  and very hot. One who has visited it in our day tells me that the\r\n  ancient Hormuz was devastated by the incursions of the Tartars, and\r\n  that its people transferred their abode to an island in the sea\r\n  called Zarun, near the continent, and lying west of the old city.\r\n  At Hormuz itself no inhabitants remain, but some of the lowest\r\n  order.” (In _Büsching_, IV. 261–262.) Friar Odoric, about 1321,\r\n  found Hormuz “on an island some 5 miles distant from the main.”\r\n  Ibn Batuta, some eight or nine years later, discriminates between\r\n  Hormuz or Moghistan on the mainland, and New Hormuz on the Island\r\n  of Jeraun, but describes only the latter, already a great and rich\r\n  city.\r\n\r\n  The site of the Island Hormuz has often been visited and described;\r\n  but I could find no published trace of any traveller having\r\n  verified the site of the more ancient city, though the existence of\r\n  its ruins was known to John de Barros, who says that a little fort\r\n  called _Cuxstac_ (_Kuhestek_ of P. della Valle, II. p. 300) stood\r\n  on the site. An application to Colonel Pelly, the very able British\r\n  Resident at Bushire, brought me from his own personal knowledge\r\n  the information that I sought, and the following particulars are\r\n  compiled from the letters with which he has favoured me:—\r\n\r\n  “The ruins of Old Hormuz, well known as such, stand several miles\r\n  up a creek, and in the centre of the present district of Minao.\r\n  They are extensive (though in large part obliterated by long\r\n  cultivation over the site), and the traces of a long pier or Bandar\r\n  were pointed out to Colonel Pelly. They are about 6 or 7 miles from\r\n  the fort of Minao, and the Minao river, or its stony bed, winds\r\n  down towards them. The creek is quite traceable, but is silted up,\r\n  and to embark goods you have to go a farsakh towards the sea, where\r\n  there is a custom-house on that part of the creek which is still\r\n  navigable. Colonel Pelly collected a few bricks from the ruins.\r\n  From the mouth of the Old Hormuz creek to the New Hormuz town, or\r\n  town of Turumpak on the island of Hormuz, is a sail of about three\r\n  farsakhs. It may be a trifle more, but any native tells you at once\r\n  that it is three farsakhs from Hormuz Island to the creek where\r\n  you land to go up to Minao. _Hormuzdia_ was the name of the region\r\n  in the days of its prosperity. Some people say that Hormuzdia was\r\n  known as _Jerunia_, and Old Hormuz town as _Jerun_.” (In this I\r\n  suspect tradition has gone astray.) “The town and fort of Minao\r\n  lie to the N.E. of the ancient city, and are built upon the lowest\r\n  spur of the Bashkurd mountains, commanding a gorge through which\r\n  the Rudbar river debouches on the plain of Hormuzdia.” In these new\r\n  and interesting particulars it is pleasing to find such precise\r\n  corroboration both of Edrisi and of Ibn Batuta. The former, writing\r\n  in the 12th century, says that Hormuz stood on the banks of a canal\r\n  or creek from the Gulf, by which vessels came up to the city. The\r\n  latter specifies the breadth of sea between Old and New Hormuz as\r\n  _three farsakhs_. (_Edrisi_, I. 424; _I. B._ II. 230.)\r\n\r\n  I now proceed to recapitulate the main features of Polo’s Itinerary\r\n  from Kermán to Hormuz. We have:—\r\n\r\n                                                              Marches.\r\n    1. From Kermán across a plain to the top of a\r\n       mountain-pass, where _extreme cold was\r\n       experienced_      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    7\r\n\r\n    2. A descent, occupying   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    2\r\n\r\n    3. A great plain, called _Reobarles_, in a much warmer\r\n       climate, abounding in francolin partridge, and in\r\n       dates and tropical fruit, with a ruined city of former\r\n       note, called _Camadi_, near the head of the plain,\r\n       which extends for .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    5\r\n\r\n    4. A second very bad pass, descending for 20 miles, say .    1\r\n\r\n    5. A well-watered fruitful plain, which is crossed to\r\n       _Hormuz_, on the shores of the Gulf   .    .    .    .    2\r\n                                                                ——\r\n                              Total                             17\r\n\r\n  No European traveller, so far as I know, has described the most\r\n  direct road from Kermán to Hormuz, or rather to its nearest modern\r\n  representative Bander Abbási,—I mean the road by Báft. But a line\r\n  to the eastward of this, and leading through the plain of Jíruft,\r\n  was followed partially by Mr. Abbott in 1850, and completely by\r\n  Major R. M. Smith, R.E., in 1866. The details of this route, except\r\n  in one particular, correspond closely in essentials with those\r\n  given by our author, and form an excellent basis of illustration\r\n  for Polo’s description.\r\n\r\n  Major Smith (accompanied at first by Colonel Goldsmid, who diverged\r\n  to Mekran) left Kermán on the 15th of January, and reached Bander\r\n  Abbási on the 3rd of February, but, as three halts have to be\r\n  deducted, his total number of marches was exactly the same as\r\n  Marco’s, viz. 17. They divide as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                              Marches.\r\n      1. From Kermán to the caravanserai of Deh Bakri in the\r\n         pass so called. “The ground as I ascended became\r\n         covered with snow, and the weather bitterly cold”\r\n         (_Report_) .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    6\r\n\r\n      2. Two miles _over very deep snow_ brought him to the\r\n         top of the pass; he then descended 14 miles to his\r\n         halt. Two miles to the south of the crest he passed a\r\n         second caravanserai: “The two are evidently built so\r\n         near one another to afford shelter to travellers who may\r\n         be unable to cross the ridge during heavy snow-storms.”\r\n         The next march continued the descent for 14 miles, and\r\n         then carried him 10 miles along the banks of the\r\n         Rudkhanah-i-Shor. The approximate height of the pass\r\n         above the sea is estimated at 8000 feet. We have thus\r\n         for the descent the greater part of .    .    .    .    2\r\n\r\n      3. “Clumps of date-palms growing near the village showed\r\n         that I had now reached a totally different climate.”\r\n         (_Smith’s Report_.) And Mr. Abbott says of the same\r\n         region: “Partly wooded ... and with thickets of reeds\r\n         abounding with francolin and _Jirufti_ partridge....\r\n         The lands yield grain, millet, pulse, French- and\r\n         horse-beans, rice, cotton, henna, Palma Christi, and\r\n         dates, and in part are of great fertility.... Rainy\r\n         season from January to March, after which a luxuriant\r\n         crop of grass.” Across this plain (districts of Jíruft\r\n         and Rudbar), the height of which above the sea, is\r\n         something under 2000 feet .    .    .    .    .    .    6\r\n\r\n      4. 6½ hours, “nearly the whole way over a most difficult\r\n         mountain-pass,” called the Pass of Nevergun   .    .    1\r\n\r\n      5. Two long marches over a plain, part of which is\r\n         described as “continuous cultivation for some 16\r\n         miles,” and the rest as a “most uninteresting plain”    2\r\n                                                                ——\r\n                                Total as before   .    .    .   17\r\n\r\n  In the previous edition of this work I was inclined to identify\r\n  Marco’s route _absolutely_ with this Itinerary. But a communication\r\n  from Major St. John, who surveyed the section from Kermán towards\r\n  Deh Bakri in 1872, shows that this first section does not answer\r\n  well to the description. The road is not all plain, for it crosses\r\n  a mountain pass, though not a formidable one. Neither is it through\r\n  a thriving, populous tract, for, with the exception of two large\r\n  villages, Major St. John found the whole road to Deh Bakri from\r\n  Kermán as desert and dreary as any in Persia. On the other hand,\r\n  the more direct route to the south, which is that always used\r\n  except in seasons of extraordinary severity (such as that of Major\r\n  Smith’s journey, when this route was impassable from snow), answers\r\n  better, as described to Major St. John by muleteers, to Polo’s\r\n  account. The first _six days_ are occupied by a gentle ascent\r\n  through the districts of Bardesir and Kairat-ul-Arab, which are the\r\n  best-watered and most fertile uplands of Kermán. From the crest\r\n  of the pass reached in those six marches (which is probably more\r\n  than 10,000 feet above the sea, for it was closed by snow on 1st\r\n  May, 1872), an easy descent of _two days_ leads to the Garmsir.\r\n  This is traversed in four days, and then a very difficult pass is\r\n  crossed to reach the plains bordering on the sea. The cold of this\r\n  route is much greater than that of the Deh Bakri route. Hence the\r\n  correspondence with Polo’s description, as far as the descent to\r\n  the Garmsir, or Reobarles, seems decidedly better by this route.\r\n  It is admitted to be quite possible that on reaching this plain\r\n  the two routes coalesced. We shall assume this provisionally, till\r\n  some traveller gives us a detailed account of the Bardesir route.\r\n  Meantime all the remaining particulars answer well.\r\n\r\n  [General Houtum-Schindler (_l.c._ pp. 493–495), speaking of the\r\n  Itinerary from Kermán to Hormúz and back, says: “Only two of the\r\n  many routes between Kermán and Bender ’Abbás coincide more or less\r\n  with Marco Polo’s description. These two routes are the one over\r\n  the Deh Bekrí Pass [see above, Colonel Smith], and the one _viâ_\r\n  Sárdú. The latter is the one, I think, taken by Marco Polo. The\r\n  more direct roads to the west are for the greater part through\r\n  mountainous country, and have not twelve stages in plains which we\r\n  find enumerated in Marco Polo’s Itinerary. The road _viâ_ Báft,\r\n  Urzú, and the Zendán Pass, for instance, has only four stages in\r\n  plains; the road, _viâ_ Ráhbur, Rúdbár and the Nevergún Pass only\r\n  six; and the road _viâ_ Sírján also only six.”\r\n\r\n                                                              Marches.\r\n    The Sárdú route, which seems to me to be the one\r\n    followed by Marco Polo, has five stages through fertile\r\n    and populous plains to Sarvízan     .    .    .    .    .    5\r\n\r\n    One day’s march ascends to the top of the Sarvízan Pass .    1\r\n\r\n    Two days’ descent to Ráhjird, a village close to the\r\n    ruins of old Jíruft, now called Shehr-i-Daqíánús   .    .    2\r\n\r\n    Six days’ march over the “vast plain” of Jírúft and Rúdbár\r\n    to Faríáb, joining the Deh Bekrí route at Kerímábád, one\r\n    stage south of the Shehr-i-Daqíánús      .    .    .    .    6\r\n\r\n    One day’s march through the Nevergún Pass to Shamíl,\r\n    descending      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    1\r\n\r\n    Two days’ march through the plain to Bender ’Abbás or\r\n    Hormúz     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    2\r\n                                                                ——\r\n                           In all  .    .    .    .    .    .   17\r\n\r\n  The Sárdú road enters the Jíruft plain at the ruins of the old\r\n  city, the Deh Bekrí route does so at some distance to the eastward.\r\n  The first six stages performed by Marco Polo in seven days go\r\n  through fertile plains and past numerous villages. Regarding the\r\n  cold, “which you can scarcely abide,” Marco Polo does not speak of\r\n  it as existing on the mountains only; he says, “From the city of\r\n  Kermán to this descent the cold in winter is very great,” that is,\r\n  from Kermán to near Jíruft. The winter at Kermán itself is fairly\r\n  severe; from the town the ground gradually but steadily rises,\r\n  the absolute altitudes of the passes crossing the mountains to\r\n  the south varying from 8000 to 11,000 feet. These passes are up\r\n  to the month of March always very cold; in one it froze slightly\r\n  in the beginning of June. The Sárdú Pass lies lower than the\r\n  others. The name is Sárdú, not Sardú from sard, “cold.” Major\r\n  Sykes (_Persia_, ch. xxiii.) comes to the same conclusion: “In\r\n  1895, and again in 1900, I made a tour partly with the object of\r\n  solving this problem, and of giving a geographical existence to\r\n  Sárdu, which appropriately means the ‘Cold Country.’ I found that\r\n  there was a route which exactly fitted Marco’s conditions, as\r\n  at Sarbizan the Sárdu plateau terminates in a high pass of 9200\r\n  feet, from which there is a most abrupt descent to the plain of\r\n  Jíruft, Komádin being about 35 miles, or two days’ journey from\r\n  the top of the pass. Starting from Kermán, the stages would be as\r\n  follows:—I. Jupár (small town); 2. Bahrámjird (large village); 3.\r\n  Gudar (village); 4. Ráin (small town).... Thence to the Sarbizan\r\n  pass is a distance of 45 miles, or three desert stages, thus\r\n  constituting a total of 110 miles for the seven days. This is the\r\n  camel route to the present day, and absolutely fits in with the\r\n  description given.... The question to be decided by this section of\r\n  the journey may then, I think, be considered to be finally and most\r\n  satisfactorily settled, the route proving to lie between the two\r\n  selected by Colonel Yule, as being the most suitable, although he\r\n  wisely left the question open.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In the abstract of Major Smith’s Itinerary as we have given it,\r\n  we do not find Polo’s city of _Camadi_. Major Smith writes to\r\n  me, however, that this is probably to be sought in “the ruined\r\n  city, the traces of which I observed in the plain of Jíruft\r\n  near Kerimabad. The name of the city is now apparently lost.”\r\n  It is, however, known to the natives as the _City of Dakiánús_,\r\n  as Mr. Abbott, who visited the site, informs us. This is a name\r\n  analogous only to the Arthur’s ovens or Merlin’s caves of our own\r\n  country, for all over Mahomedan Asia there are old sites to which\r\n  legend attaches the name of _Dakianus_ or the Emperor Decius, the\r\n  persecuting tyrant of the Seven Sleepers. “The spot,” says Abbott,\r\n  “is an elevated part of the plain on the right bank of the Hali\r\n  Rúd, and is thickly strewn with kiln-baked bricks, and shreds of\r\n  pottery and glass.... After heavy rain the peasantry search amongst\r\n  the ruins for ornaments of stone, and rings and coins of gold,\r\n  silver, and copper. The popular tradition concerning the city is\r\n  that it was destroyed by a flood long before the birth of Mahomed.”\r\n\r\n  [General Houtum-Schindler, in a paper in the _Jour. R. As. Soc._,\r\n  Jan. 1898, p. 43, gives an abstract of Dr. Houtsma’s (of Utrecht)\r\n  memoir, _Zur Geschichte der Saljuqen von Kerman_, and comes to the\r\n  conclusion that “from these statements we can safely identify Marco\r\n  Polo’s Camadi with the suburb Qumādīn, or, as I would read it,\r\n  Qamādīn, of the city of Jíruft.”—(Cf. _Major Sykes’ Persia_, chap.\r\n  xxiii.: “Camadi was sacked for the first time, after the death of\r\n  Toghrul Shah of Kermán, when his four sons reduced the province to\r\n  a condition of anarchy.”)\r\n\r\n  Major P. Molesworth Sykes, _Recent Journeys in Persia_ (_Geog.\r\n  Journal_, X. 1897, p. 589), says: “Upon arrival in Rudbar, we\r\n  turned northwards and left the Farman Farma, in order to explore\r\n  the site of Marco Polo’s ‘Camadi.’... We came upon a huge area\r\n  littered with yellow bricks eight inches square, while not even a\r\n  broken wall is left to mark the site of what was formerly a great\r\n  city, under the name of the Sher-i-Jiruft.”—H. C.] The actual\r\n  distance from Bamm to the City of Dakianus is, by Abbott’s Journal,\r\n  about 66 miles.\r\n\r\n  The name of REOBARLES, which Marco applies to the plain\r\n  intermediate between the two descents, has given rise to many\r\n  conjectures. Marsden pointed to _Rúdbár_, a name frequently\r\n  applied in Persia to a district on a river, or intersected by\r\n  streams—a suggestion all the happier that he was not aware of\r\n  the fact that there is a district of RUDBAR exactly in the\r\n  required position. The last syllable still requires explanation.\r\n  I ventured formerly to suggest that it was the Arabic _Laṣṣ_,\r\n  or, as Marco would certainly have written it, _Les_, a robber.\r\n  Reobarles would then be RUDBAR-I-LAṢṢ, “Robber’s River District.”\r\n  The appropriateness of the name Marco has amply illustrated; and\r\n  it appeared to me to survive in that of one of the rivers of the\r\n  plain, which is mentioned by both Abbott and Smith under the title\r\n  of _Rúdkhánah-i-Duzdi_, or Robbery River, a name also applied to\r\n  a village and old fort on the banks of the stream. This etymology\r\n  was, however, condemned as an inadmissible combination of Persian\r\n  and Arabic by two very high authorities both as travellers and\r\n  scholars—Sir H. Rawlinson and Mr. Khanikoff. The _Les_, therefore,\r\n  has still to be explained.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Major Sykes (_Geog. Journal_, 1902, p. 130) heard of robbers, some\r\n  five miles from Mináb, and he adds: “However, nothing happened, and\r\n  after crossing the Gardan-i-Pichal, we camped at Birinti, which is\r\n  situated just above the junction of Rudkhána Duzdi, or ‘River of\r\n  Theft,’ and forms part of the district of Rudán, in Fars.”\r\n\r\n  “The Jíruft and Rúdbár plains belong to the germsír (hot region),\r\n  dates, pistachios, and konars (apples of Paradise) abound in them.\r\n  Reobarles is Rúdbár or Rüdbáris.” (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ 1881,\r\n  p. 495.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We have referred to Marco’s expressions regarding the great cold\r\n  experienced on the pass which formed the first descent; and it is\r\n  worthy of note that the title of “The Cold Mountains” is applied\r\n  by Edrisi to these very mountains. Mr. Abbott’s MS. Report also\r\n  mentions in this direction, _Sardu_, said to be a cold country (as\r\n  its name seems to express [see above,—H. C.]), which its population\r\n  (Iliyáts) abandon in winter for the lower plains. It is but\r\n  recently that the importance of this range of mountains has become\r\n  known to us. Indeed the _existence_ of the chain, as extending\r\n  continuously from near Kashán, was first indicated by Khanikoff in\r\n  1862. More recently Major St. John has shown the magnitude of this\r\n  range, which rises into summits of 15,000 feet in altitude, and\r\n  after a course of 550 miles terminates in a group of volcanic hills\r\n  some 50 miles S.E. of Bamm. Yet practically this chain is ignored\r\n  on all our maps!\r\n\r\n  Marco’s description of the “Plain of Formosa” does not apply,\r\n  now at least, to the _whole_ plain, for towards Bander Abbási it\r\n  is barren. But to the eastward, about Minao, and therefore about\r\n  Old Hormuz, it has not fallen off. Colonel Pelly writes: “The\r\n  district of Minao is still for those regions singularly fertile.\r\n  Pomegranates, oranges, pistachio-nuts, and various other fruits\r\n  grow in profusion. The source of its fertility is of course the\r\n  river, and you can walk for miles among lanes and cultivated\r\n  ground, partially sheltered from the sun.” And Lieutenant\r\n  Kempthorne, in his notes on that coast, says of the same tract: “It\r\n  is termed by the natives the Paradise of Persia. It is certainly\r\n  most beautifully fertile, and abounds in orange-groves, and\r\n  orchards containing apples, pears, peaches, and apricots; with\r\n  vineyards producing a delicious grape, from which was at one time\r\n  made a wine called _amber-rosolli_”—a name not easy to explain.\r\n  _’Ambar-i-Rasúl_, “The Prophet’s Bouquet!” would be too bold a name\r\n  even for Persia, though names more sacred are so profaned at Naples\r\n  and on the Moselle. Sir H. Rawlinson suggests _’Ambar-’asali_,\r\n  “Honey Bouquet,” as possible.\r\n\r\n  When Nearchus beached his fleet on the shore of _Harmozeia_ at the\r\n  mouth of the _Anamis_ (the River of Minao), Arrian tells us he\r\n  found the country a kindly one, and very fruitful in every way\r\n  except that there were no olives. The weary mariners landed and\r\n  enjoyed this pleasant rest from their toils. (_Indica_, 33; _J. R.\r\n  G. S._ V. 274.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCO POLO’S ITINERARIES Nᵒ. II.\r\n\r\n    Kerman to Hormuz (Bᵏ. I. Ch. 19.)\r\n\r\n    Approximate Section from Yazd to Hormuz]\r\n\r\n  The name Formosa is probably only Rusticiano’s misunderstanding of\r\n  _Harmuza_, aided, perhaps, by Polo’s picture of the beauty of the\r\n  plain. We have the same change in the old _Mafomet_ for Mahomet,\r\n  and the converse one in the Spanish _hermosa_ for _formosa_.\r\n  Teixeira’s Chronicle says that the city of Hormuz was founded by Xa\r\n  Mahamed Dranku, _i.e._ Shah Mahomed Dirhem-Ko, in “a plain of the\r\n  same name.”\r\n\r\n  The statement in Ramusio that Hormuz stood upon an island, is, I\r\n  doubt not, an interpolation by himself or some earlier transcriber.\r\n\r\n  When the ships of Nearchus launched again from the mouth of the\r\n  Anamis, their first day’s run carried them past a certain desert\r\n  and bushy island to another which was large and inhabited. The\r\n  desert isle was called _Organa_; the large one by which they\r\n  anchored _Oaracta_. (_Indica_, 37.) Neither name is quite lost; the\r\n  latter greater island is Kishm or _Brakht_; the former _Jerún_,[2]\r\n  perhaps in old Persian _Gerún_ or _Gerán_, now again desert though\r\n  no longer bushy, after having been for three centuries the site\r\n  of a city which became a poetic type of wealth and splendour. An\r\n  Eastern saying ran, “Were the world a ring, Hormuz would be the\r\n  jewel in it.”\r\n\r\n  [“The _Yüan shi_ mentions several seaports of the Indian Ocean as\r\n  carrying on trade with China; Hormuz is not spoken of there. I may,\r\n  however, quote from the Yüan History a curious statement which\r\n  perhaps refers to this port. In ch. cxxiii., biography of Arsz-lan,\r\n  it is recorded that his grandson Hurdutai, by order of Kubilai\r\n  Khan, accompanied _Bu-lo no-yen_ on his mission to the country of\r\n  _Ha-rh-ma-sz_. This latter name may be intended for Hormuz. I do\r\n  not think that by the Noyen _Bulo_, M. Polo could be meant, for the\r\n  title Noyen would hardly have been applied to him. But Rashid-eddin\r\n  mentions a distinguished Mongol, by name _Pulad_, with whom he was\r\n  acquainted in Persia, and who furnished him with much information\r\n  regarding the history of the Mongols. This may be the _Bu-lo\r\n  no-yen_ of the Yüan History.” (Bretschneider, _Med. Res._ II. p.\r\n  132.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—A spirit is still distilled from dates in Persia, Mekran,\r\n  Sind, and some places in the west of India. It is mentioned by\r\n  Strabo and Dioscorides, according to Kämpfer, who says it was in\r\n  his time made under the name of a medicinal stomachic; the rich\r\n  added _Radix Chinae_, ambergris, and aromatic spices; the poor,\r\n  liquorice and Persian absinth.

(From Eastlake.)]\r\n\r\n  The date and dry-fish diet of the Gulf people is noticed by most\r\n  travellers, and P. della Valle repeats the opinion about its being\r\n  the only wholesome one. Ibn Batuta says the people of Hormuz had\r\n  a saying, “_Khormá wa máhí lút-i-Pádshahi_,” _i.e._ “Dates and fish\r\n  make an Emperor’s dish!” A fish, exactly like the tunny of the\r\n  Mediterranean in general appearance and habits, is one of the\r\n  great objects of fishery off the Sind and Mekran coasts. It comes\r\n  in pursuit of shoals of anchovies, very much like the Mediterranean\r\n  fish also. (_I. B._ II. 231; _Sir B. Frere_.)\r\n\r\n  [Friar Odoric (_Cathay_, I. pp. 55–56) says: “And there you find\r\n  (before arriving at Hormuz) people who live almost entirely on\r\n  dates, and you get forty-two pounds of dates for less than a groat;\r\n  and so of many other things.”]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The stitched vessels of Kermán (πλοιάρια ῥαπτὰ) are noticed\r\n  in the _Periplus_. Similar accounts to those of our text are given\r\n  of the ships of the Gulf and of Western India by Jordanus and John\r\n  of Montecorvino. (_Jord._ p. 53; _Cathay_, p. 217.) “Stitched\r\n  vessels,” Sir B. Frere writes, “are still used. I have seen them\r\n  of 200 tons burden; but they are being driven out by iron-fastened\r\n  vessels, as iron gets cheaper, except where (as on the Malabar and\r\n  Coromandel coasts) the pliancy of a stitched boat is useful in a\r\n  surf. Till the last few years, when steamers have begun to take all\r\n  the best horses, the Arab horses bound to Bombay almost all came\r\n  in the way Marco Polo describes.” Some of them do still, standing\r\n  over a date cargo, and the result of this combination gives rise to\r\n  an extraordinary traffic in the Bombay bazaar. From what Colonel\r\n  Pelly tells me, the stitched build in the Gulf is _now_ confined to\r\n  fishing-boats, and is disused for sea-going craft.\r\n\r\n  [Friar Odoric (_Cathay_, I. p. 57) mentioned these vessels: “In\r\n  this country men make use of a kind of vessel which they call\r\n  _Jase_, which is fastened only with stitching of twine. On one of\r\n  these vessels I embarked, and I could find no iron at all therein.”\r\n  _Jase_ is for the Arabic _Djehaz_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The fish-oil used to rub the ships was whale-oil. The old Arab\r\n  voyagers of the 9th century describe the fishermen of Siraf in the\r\n  Gulf as cutting up the whale-blubber and drawing the oil from it,\r\n  which was mixed with other stuff, and used to rub the joints of\r\n  ships’ planking. (_Reinaud_, I. 146.)\r\n\r\n  Both Montecorvino and Polo, in this passage, specify _one rudder_,\r\n  as if it was a peculiarity of these ships worth noting. The fact\r\n  is that, in the Mediterranean at least, the double rudders of the\r\n  ancients kept their place to a great extent through the Middle\r\n  Ages. A Marseilles MS. of the 13th century, quoted in Ducange,\r\n  says: “A ship requires three rudders, two in place, and one to\r\n  spare.” Another: “Every two-ruddered bark shall pay a groat each\r\n  voyage; every one-ruddered bark shall,” etc. (See Duc. under\r\n  _Timonus_ and _Temo_.) Numerous proofs of the use of two rudders in\r\n  the 13th century will be found in “_Documenti inediti riguardanti\r\n  le due Crociate di S. Ludovico IX., Re di Francia_, etc., da _L. T.\r\n  Belgrano_, Genova, 1859.” Thus in a specification of ships to be\r\n  built at Genoa for the king (p. 7), each is to have “_Timones duo_,\r\n  affaiticos, grossitudinis palmorum viiii et dimidiae, longitudinis\r\n  cubitorum xxiiii.” Extracts given by Capmany, regarding the\r\n  equipment of galleys, show the same thing, for he is probably\r\n  mistaken in saying that one of the _dos timones_ specified was a\r\n  spare one. Joinville (p. 205) gives incidental evidence of the\r\n  same: “Those Marseilles ships have each two rudders, with each a\r\n  tiller (? _tison_) attached to it in such an ingenious way that\r\n  you can turn the ship right or left as fast as you would turn a\r\n  horse. So on the Friday the king was sitting upon one of these\r\n  tillers, when he called me and said to me,” etc.[4] Francesco da\r\n  Barberino, a poet of the 13th century, in the 7th part of his\r\n  _Documenti d’Amore_ (printed at Rome in 1640), which instructs the\r\n  lover to whose lot it may fall to escort his lady on a sea-voyage\r\n  (instructions carried so far as to provide even for the case of her\r\n  death at sea!), alludes more than once to these plural rudders.\r\n  Thus—\r\n\r\n      “———— se vedessi avenire\r\n       Che vento ti rompesse\r\n         _Timoni_ ...\r\n       In luogo di timoni\r\n         Fa spere[5] e in aqua poni.” (P. 272–273.)\r\n\r\n  And again, when about to enter a port, it is needful to be on\r\n  the alert and ready to run in case of a hostile reception, so the\r\n  galley should enter stern foremost—a movement which he reminds his\r\n  lover involves the reversal of the ordinary use of the two rudders:—\r\n\r\n      “_L’un timon leva suso\r\n         L’altro leggier tien giuso_,\r\n       Ma convien levar mano\r\n         Non mica com soleàno,\r\n       Ma per contraro, e face\r\n         Cosi ’l guidar verace.” (P. 275.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    12th Century Illumination.

(_Malacca, l’ Inde mérid. et le Cathay_, Bruxelles, 1882,\r\n  4to, f. 26.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The midship rudder seems to have been the more usual in the western\r\n  seas, and the double quarter-rudders in the Mediterranean. The\r\n  former are sometimes styled _Navarresques_ and the latter _Latins_.\r\n  Yet early seals of some of the Cinque Ports show vessels with the\r\n  double rudder; one of which (that of Winchelsea) is given in the\r\n  cut.\r\n\r\n  In the Mediterranean the latter was still in occasional use late in\r\n  the 16th century. Captain Pantero Pantera in his book, _L’ Armata\r\n  Navale_ (Rome, 1614, p. 44), says that the Galeasses, or great\r\n  galleys, had the helm _alla Navarresca_, but also a great oar on\r\n  each side of it to assist in turning the ship. And I observe that\r\n  the great galeasses which precede the Christian line of battle at\r\n  Lepanto, in one of the frescoes by Vasari in the Royal Hall leading\r\n  to the Sistine Chapel, have the quarter-rudder very distinctly.\r\n\r\n  The Chinese appear occasionally to employ it, as seems to be\r\n  indicated in a woodcut of a vessel of war which I have traced from\r\n  a Chinese book in the National Library at Paris. (See above, p.\r\n  37.) [For the Chinese words for _rudder_, see p. 126 of J. Edkins’\r\n  article on _Chinese Names for Boats and Boat Gear, Jour. N. China\r\n  Br. R. As. Soc._ N.S. XI. 1876.—H. C.] It is also used by certain\r\n  craft of the Indian Archipelago, as appears from Mr. Wallace’s\r\n  description of the Prau in which he sailed from Macassar to the\r\n  Aru Islands. And on the Caspian, it is stated in Smith’s “Dict. of\r\n  Antiquities” (art. _Gubernaculum_), the practice remained in force\r\n  till late times. A modern traveller was nearly wrecked on that sea,\r\n  because the two rudders were in the hands of two pilots who spoke\r\n  different languages, and did not understand each other!\r\n\r\n  (Besides the works quoted see _Jal, Archéologie Navale_, II.\r\n  437–438, and _Capmany, Memorias_, III. 61.)\r\n\r\n  [Major Sykes remarks (_Persia_, ch. xxiii.): “Some unrecorded\r\n  event, probably the sight of the unseaworthy craft, which had not\r\n  an ounce of iron in their composition, made our travellers decide\r\n  that the risks of the sea were too great, so that we have the\r\n  pleasure of accompanying them back to Kermán and thence northwards\r\n  to Khorasán.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—So also at Bander Abbási Tavernier says it was so unhealthy\r\n  that foreigners could not stop there beyond March; everybody left\r\n  it in April. Not a hundredth part of the population, says Kämpfer,\r\n  remained in the city. Not a beggar would stop for any reward! The\r\n  rich went to the towns of the interior or to the cool recesses\r\n  of the mountains, the poor took refuge in the palm-groves at the\r\n  distance of a day or two from the city. A place called ’Ishin, some\r\n  12 miles north of the city, was a favourite resort of the European\r\n  and Hindu merchants. Here were fine gardens, spacious baths, and a\r\n  rivulet of fresh and limpid water.\r\n\r\n  The custom of lying in water is mentioned also by Sir John\r\n  Maundevile, and it was adopted by the Portuguese when they occupied\r\n  Insular Hormuz, as P. della Valle and Linschoten relate. The custom\r\n  is still common during great heats, in Sind and Mekran (Sir B. F.).\r\n\r\n  An anonymous ancient geography (_Liber Junioris Philosophi_) speaks\r\n  of a people in India who live in the Terrestrial Paradise, and\r\n  lead the life of the Golden Age.... The sun is so hot _that they\r\n  remain all day in the river!_\r\n\r\n  The heat in the Straits of Hormuz drove Abdurrazzak into an\r\n  anticipation of a verse familiar to English schoolboys: “Even the\r\n  bird of rapid flight was burnt up in the heights of heaven, as\r\n  well as the fish in the depths of the sea!” (_Tavern._ Bk. V. ch.\r\n  xxiii.; _Am. Exot._ 716, 762; _Müller, Geog. Gr. Min._ II. 514;\r\n  _India in XV. Cent._ p. 49.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—A like description of the effect of the _Simúm_ on the\r\n  human body is given by Ibn Batuta, Chardin, A. Hamilton, Tavernier,\r\n  Thévenot, etc.; and the first of these travellers speaks specially\r\n  of its prevalence in the desert near Hormuz, and of the many graves\r\n  of its victims; but I have met with no reasonable account of its\r\n  poisonous action. I will quote Chardin, already quoted at greater\r\n  length by Marsden, as the most complete parallel to the text: “The\r\n  most surprising effect of the wind is not the mere fact of its\r\n  causing death, but its operation on the bodies of those who are\r\n  killed by it. It seems as if they became decomposed without losing\r\n  shape, so that you would think them to be merely asleep, when they\r\n  are not merely dead, but in such a state that if you take hold of\r\n  any part of the body it comes away in your hand. And the finger\r\n  penetrates such a body as if it were so much dust.” (III. 286.)\r\n\r\n  Burton, on his journey to Medina, says: “The people assured me\r\n  that this wind never killed a man in their Allah-favoured land. I\r\n  doubt the fact. At Bir Abbas the body of an Arnaut was brought in\r\n  swollen, and decomposed rapidly, the true diagnosis of death by\r\n  the poison-wind.” Khanikoff is very distinct as to the immediate\r\n  fatality of the desert wind at Khabis, near Kermán, but does not\r\n  speak of the effect on the body after death. This Major St. John\r\n  does, describing a case that occurred in June, 1871, when he was\r\n  halting, during intense heat, at the post-house of Pasangan, a few\r\n  miles south of Kom. The bodies were brought in of two poor men, who\r\n  had tried to start some hours before sunset, and were struck down\r\n  by the poisonous blast within half-a-mile of the post-house. “It\r\n  was found impossible to wash them before burial.... Directly the\r\n  limbs were touched they separated from the trunk.” (_Oc. Highways,\r\n  ut. sup._) About 1790, when Timúr Sháh of Kabul sent an army under\r\n  the Sirdár-i-Sirdárán to put down a revolt in Meshed, this force\r\n  on its return was struck by Simúm in the Plain of Farrah, and the\r\n  Sirdár perished, with a great number of his men. (_Ferrier, H. of\r\n  the Afghans_, 102; _J. R. G. S._ XXVI. 217; _Khan. Mém._ 210.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The History of Hormuz is very imperfectly known. What\r\n  I have met with on the subject consists of—(1) An abstract by\r\n  Teixeira of a chronicle of Hormuz, written by Thurán Sháh, who\r\n  was himself sovereign of Hormuz, and died in 1377; (2) some\r\n  contemporary notices by Wassáf, which are extracted by Hammer in\r\n  his History of the Ilkhans; (3) some notices from Persian sources\r\n  in the 2nd Decade of De Barros (ch. ii.). The last do not go\r\n  further back than Gordun Sháh, the father of Thurán Sháh, to whom\r\n  they erroneously ascribe the first migration to the Island.\r\n\r\n  One of Teixeira’s Princes is called _Ruknuddin Mahmud_, and with\r\n  him Marsden and Pauthier have identified Polo’s Ruomedam Acomet,\r\n  or as he is called on another occasion in the Geog. Text, _Maimodi\r\n  Acomet_. This, however, is out of the question, for the death of\r\n  Ruknuddin is assigned to A.H. 675 (A.D. 1277), whilst there can, I\r\n  think, be no doubt that Marco’s account refers to the period of his\r\n  return from China, viz. 1293 or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n  We find in Teixeira that the ruler who succeeded in 1290 was _Amir\r\n  Masa’úd_, who obtained the Government by the murder of his brother\r\n  Saifuddin Nazrat. Masa’úd was cruel and oppressive; most of the\r\n  influential people withdrew to Baháuddin Ayaz, whom Saifuddin had\r\n  made Wazir of Kalhát on the Arabian coast. This Wazir assembled a\r\n  force and drove out Masa’úd after he had reigned three years. He\r\n  fled to Kermán and died there some years afterwards.\r\n\r\n  Baháuddin, who had originally been a slave of Saifuddin Nazrat’s,\r\n  succeeded in establishing his authority. But about 1300 great\r\n  bodies of Turks (_i.e._ Tartars) issuing from Turkestan ravaged\r\n  many provinces of Persia, including Kermán and Hormuz. The people,\r\n  unable to bear the frequency of such visitations, retired first\r\n  to the island of Kishm, and then to that of Jerún, on which\r\n  last was built the city of New Hormuz, afterwards so famous.\r\n  This is Teixeira’s account from Thurán Sháh, so far as we are\r\n  concerned with it. As regards the transfer of the city it agrees\r\n  substantially with Abulfeda’s, which we have already quoted\r\n  (_supra_, note 1).\r\n\r\n  Hammer’s account from Wassáf is frightfully confused, chiefly I\r\n  should suppose from Hammer’s own fault; for among other things he\r\n  assumes that Hormuz was always on an island, and he distinguishes\r\n  between the Island of Hormuz and the Island of Jerún! We gather,\r\n  however, that Hormuz before the Mongol time formed a government\r\n  subordinate to the Salghur Atabegs of Fars (see note 1, ch. xv.),\r\n  and when the power of that Dynasty was falling, the governor\r\n  Mahmúd Kalháti, established himself as Prince of Hormuz, and\r\n  became the founder of a petty dynasty, being evidently identical\r\n  with Teixeira’s Ruknuddin Mahmud above-named, who is represented\r\n  as reigning from 1246 to 1277. In Wassáf we find, as in Teixeira,\r\n  Mahmúd’s son Masa’úd killing his brother Nazrat, and Baháuddin\r\n  expelling Masa’úd. It is true that Hammer’s surprising muddle makes\r\n  Nazrat kill Masa’úd; however, as a few lines lower we find Masa’úd\r\n  alive and Nazrat dead, we may safely venture on this correction.\r\n  But we find also that Masa’úd appears as _Ruknuddin_ Masa’úd, and\r\n  that Baháuddin does not assume the princely authority himself,\r\n  but proclaims that of _Fakhruddin Ahmed_ Ben Ibrahim At-Thaibi, a\r\n  personage who does not appear in Teixeira at all. A MS. history,\r\n  quoted by Ouseley, _does_ mention Fakhruddin, and ascribes to him\r\n  the transfer to Jerún. Wassáf seems to allude to Baháuddin as a\r\n  sort of Sea Rover, occupying the islands of Larek and Jerún, whilst\r\n  Fakhruddin reigned at Hormuz. It is difficult to understand the\r\n  relation between the two.\r\n\r\n  It is _possible_ that Polo’s memory made some confusion between the\r\n  names of RUKNUDDIN Masa’úd and Fakhruddin AHMED, but I incline to\r\n  think the latter is his RUOMEDAN AHMED. For Teixeira tells us that\r\n  Masa’úd took refuge at the court of Kermán, and Wassáf represents\r\n  him as supported in his claims by the Atabeg of that province,\r\n  whilst we see that Polo seems to represent Ruomedan Acomat as in\r\n  hostility with that prince. To add to the imbroglio I find in a\r\n  passage of Wassáf Malik Fakhruddin Ahmed at-Thaibi sent by Ghazan\r\n  Khan in 1297 as ambassador to Khanbalig, staying there some years,\r\n  and dying off the Coromandel coast on his return in 1305. (Elliot,\r\n  iii. pp. 45–47.)\r\n\r\n  Masa’úd’s seeking help from Kermán to reinstate him is not the\r\n  first case of the same kind that occurs in Teixeira’s chronicle, so\r\n  there may have been some kind of colour for Marco’s representation\r\n  of the Prince of Hormuz as the vassal of the Atabeg of Kermán\r\n  (“_l’homme de cest roy de Creman;_” see _Prologue_, ch. xiv.\r\n  note 2). M. Khanikoff denies the _possibility_ of the existence\r\n  of any _royal dynasty_ at Hormuz at this period. That there\r\n  _was_ a dynasty of _Maliks_ of Hormuz, however, at this period\r\n  we must believe on the concurring testimony of Marco, of Wassáf,\r\n  and of Thurán Sháh. There was also, it would seem, another\r\n  _quasi_-independent principality in the Island of Kais. (_Hammer’s\r\n  Ilch._ II. 50, 51; _Teixeira, Relacion de los Reyes de Hormuz;\r\n  Khan. Notice_, p. 34.)\r\n\r\n  The ravages of the Tartars which drove the people of Hormuz from\r\n  their city may have begun with the incursions of the Nigudaris and\r\n  Karaunahs, but they probably came to a climax in the great raid in\r\n  1299 of the Chaghataian Prince Kotlogh Shah, son of Dua Khan, a\r\n  part of whose bands besieged the city itself, though they are said\r\n  to have been repulsed by Baháuddin Ayas.\r\n\r\n  [The Dynasty of Hormuz was founded about 1060 by a Yemen chief\r\n  Mohammed Dirhem Ko, and remained subject to Kermán till 1249,\r\n  when Rokn ed-din Mahmúd III. Kalháti (1242–1277) made himself\r\n  independent. The immediate successors of Rokn ed-din were Saif\r\n  ed-din Nazrat (1277–1290), Masa’úd (1290–1293), Bahad ed-din Ayaz\r\n  Sayfin (1293–1311). Hormuz was captured by the Portuguese in 1510\r\n  and by the Persians in 1622.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—The indications of this alternative route to Kermán are\r\n  very vague, but it may probably have been that through Finn,\r\n  Tárum, and the Sírján district, passing out of the plain of Hormuz\r\n  by the eastern flank of the Ginao mountain. This road would pass\r\n  near the hot springs at the base of the said mountain, Sarga,\r\n  Khurkhu, and Ginao, which are described by Kämpfer. Being more or\r\n  less sulphureous they are likely to be useful in skin-diseases:\r\n  indeed, Hamilton speaks of their efficacy in these. (I. 95.) The\r\n  salt-streams are numerous on this line, and dates are abundant. The\r\n  bitterness of the bread was, however, more probably due to another\r\n  cause, as Major Smith has kindly pointed out to me: “Throughout\r\n  the mountains in the south of Persia, which are generally covered\r\n  with dwarf oak, the people are in the habit of making bread of the\r\n  acorns, or of the acorns mixed with wheat or barley. It is dark in\r\n  colour, and very hard, bitter, and unpalatable.”\r\n\r\n  Major St. John also noticed the bitterness of the bread in Kermán,\r\n  but his servants attributed it to the presence in the wheat-fields\r\n  of a bitter leguminous plant, with a yellowish white flower, which\r\n  the Kermánis were too lazy to separate, so that much remained in\r\n  the thrashing, and imparted its bitter flavour to the grain (surely\r\n  the _Tare_ of our Lord’s Parable!).\r\n\r\n  [General Houtum-Schindler says (_l.c._ p. 496): “Marco Polo’s\r\n  return journey was, I am inclined to think, _viâ_ Urzú and Báft,\r\n  the shortest and most direct road. The road _viâ_ Tárum and Sírján\r\n  is very seldom taken by travellers intending to go to Kermán; it\r\n  is only frequented by the caravans going between Bender ’Abbás\r\n  and Bahrámábád, three stages west of Kermán. Hot springs, ‘curing\r\n  itch,’ I noticed at two places on the Urzú-Báft road. There\r\n  were some near Qal’ah Asgher and others near Dashtáb; they were\r\n  frequented by people suffering from skin-diseases, and were highly\r\n  sulphureous; the water of those near Dashtáb turned a silver ring\r\n  black after two hours’ immersion. Another reason of my advocating\r\n  the Urzú road is that the bitter bread spoken of by Marco Polo\r\n  is only found on it, viz. at Báft and in Bardshír. In Sírján, to\r\n  the west, and on the roads to the east, the bread is sweet. The\r\n  bitter taste is from the Khúr, a bitter leguminous plant, which\r\n  grows among the wheat, and whose grains the people are too lazy\r\n  to pick out. There is not a single oak between Bender ’Abbás and\r\n  Kermán; none of the inhabitants seemed to know what an acorn was.\r\n  A person at Báft, who had once gone to Kerbelá _viâ_ Kermánsháh\r\n  and Baghdád, recognised my sketch of tree and fruit immediately,\r\n  having seen oak and acorn between Kermánsháh and Qasr-i-Shírín on\r\n  the Baghdád road.” Major Sykes writes (ch. xxiii.): “The above\r\n  description undoubtedly refers to the main winter route, which\r\n  runs _viâ_ Sírján. This is demonstrated by the fact that under\r\n  the Kuh-i-Ginao, the summer station of Bandar Abbás, there is a\r\n  magnificent sulphur spring, which, welling from an orifice 4 feet\r\n  in diameter, forms a stream some 30 yards wide. Its temperature\r\n  at the source is 113 degrees, and its therapeutic properties are\r\n  highly appreciated. As to the bitterness of the bread, it is\r\n  suggested in the notes that it was caused by being mixed with\r\n  acorns, but, to-day at any rate, there are no oak forests in this\r\n  part of Persia, and I would urge that it is better to accept our\r\n  traveller’s statement, that it was due to the bitterness of the\r\n  water.”—However, I prefer Gen. Houtum-Schindler’s theory.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] It is but fair to say that scholars so eminent as Professors\r\n    Sprenger and Blochmann have considered the original suggestion\r\n    lawful and probable. Indeed, Mr. Blochmann says in a letter: “After\r\n    studying a language for years, one acquires a natural feeling for\r\n    anything un-idiomatic; but I must confess I see nothing un-Persian\r\n    in _rúdbár-i-duzd_, nor in _rúdbár-i-lass_.... How common _lass_\r\n    is, you may see from one fact, that it occurs in children’s\r\n    reading-books.” We must not take _Reobarles_ in Marco’s French\r\n    as rhyming to (French) _Charles_; every syllable sounds. It is\r\n    remarkable that _Lăs_, as the name of a small State near our Sind\r\n    frontier, is said to mean, “in the language of the country,” _a\r\n    level plain_. (_J. A. S. B._ VIII. 195.) It is not clear what is\r\n    meant by the language of the country. The chief is a Brahui, the\r\n    people are Lumri or Numri Bilúchis, who are, according to Tod, of\r\n    Jat descent.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir Henry Rawlinson objects to this identification (which is the\r\n    same that Dr. Karl Müller adopts), saying that _Organa_ is more\r\n    probably “Angan, formerly Argan.” To this I cannot assent. Nearchus\r\n    sails 300 stadia from the mouth of Anamis to Oaracta, and _on his\r\n    way_ passes Organa. Taking 600 stadia to the degree (Dr. Müller’s\r\n    value), I make it just 300 stadia from the mouth of the Hormuz\r\n    creek to the eastern point of Kishm. Organa must have been either\r\n    Jerún or Lárek; Angan (_Hanjám_ of Mas’udi) is out of the question.\r\n    And as a straight run must have passed quite close to Jerún, not to\r\n    Lárek, I find the former most probable. Nearchus next day proceeds\r\n    200 stadia along Oaracta, and anchors in sight of another island\r\n    (Neptune’s) which was separated by 40 stadia from Oaracta. _This_\r\n    was Angan; no other island answers, and for this the distances\r\n    answer with singular precision.\r\n\r\n[3] Moore refers to _Persian Tales_.\r\n\r\n[4] This _tison_ can be seen in the cuts from the tomb of St. Peter\r\n    Martyr and the seal of Winchelsea.\r\n\r\n[5] _Spere_, bundles of spars, etc., dragged overboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n          OF THE WEARISOME AND DESERT ROAD THAT HAS NOW TO BE\r\n                              TRAVELLED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn departing from the city of Kerman you find the road for seven days\r\nmost wearisome; and I will tell you how this is.{1} The first three\r\ndays you meet with no water, or next to none. And what little you do\r\nmeet with is bitter green stuff, so salt that no one can drink it; and\r\nin fact if you drink a drop of it, it will set you purging ten times\r\nat least by the way. It is the same with the salt which is made from\r\nthose streams; no one dares to make use of it, because of the excessive\r\npurging which it occasions. Hence it is necessary to carry water for\r\nthe people to last these three days; as for the cattle, they must needs\r\ndrink of the bad water I have mentioned, as there is no help for it,\r\nand their great thirst makes them do so. But it scours them to such\r\na degree that sometimes they die of it. In all those three days you\r\nmeet with no human habitation; it is all desert, and the extremity of\r\ndrought. Even of wild beasts there are none, for there is nothing for\r\nthem to eat.{2}\r\n\r\nAfter those three days of desert [you arrive at a stream of fresh water\r\nrunning underground, but along which there are holes broken in here and\r\nthere, perhaps undermined by the stream, at which you can get sight of\r\nit. It has an abundant supply, and travellers, worn with the hardships\r\nof the desert, here rest and refresh themselves and their beasts.]{3}\r\n\r\nYou then enter another desert which extends for four days; it is very\r\nmuch like the former except that you do see some wild asses. And at the\r\ntermination of these four days of desert the kingdom of Kerman comes to\r\nan end, and you find another city which is called Cobinan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1. [“The present road from Kermán to Kúbenán is to Zerend\r\n  about 50 miles, to the Sár i Benán 15 miles, thence to Kúbenán 30\r\n  miles—total 95 miles. Marco Polo cannot have taken the direct road\r\n  to Kúbenán, as it took him seven days to reach it. As he speaks of\r\n  waterless deserts, he probably took a circuitous route to the east\r\n  of the mountains, _viâ_ Kúhpáyeh and the desert lying to the north\r\n  of Khabis.” (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ pp. 496–497.) (Cf. _Major\r\n  Sykes_, ch. xxiii.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This description of the Desert of Kermán, says Mr.\r\n  Khanikoff, “is very correct. As the only place in the Desert of Lút\r\n  where water is found is the dirty, salt, bitter, and green water\r\n  of the rivulet called _Shor-Rúd_ (the Salt River), we can have no\r\n  doubt of the direction of Marco Polo’s route from Kermán so far.”\r\n  Nevertheless I do not agree with Khanikoff that the route lay N.E.\r\n  in the direction of Ambar and Kain, for a reason which will appear\r\n  under the next chapter. I imagine the route to have been nearly\r\n  due north from Kermán, in the direction of Tabbas or of Tún. And\r\n  even such a route would, according to Khanikoff’s own map, pass the\r\n  Shor-Rúd, though at a higher point.\r\n\r\n  I extract a few lines from that gentleman’s narrative: “In\r\n  proportion as we got deeper into the desert, the soil became more\r\n  and more arid; at daybreak I could still discover a few withered\r\n  plants of _Caligonum_ and _Salsola_, and not far from the same spot\r\n  I saw a lark and another bird of a whitish colour, the last living\r\n  things that we beheld in this dismal solitude.... The desert had\r\n  now completely assumed the character of a land accursed, as the\r\n  natives call it. Not the smallest blade of grass, no indication of\r\n  animal life vivified the prospect; no sound but such as came from\r\n  our own caravan broke the dreary silence of the void.” (_Mém._ p.\r\n  176.)\r\n\r\n  [Major P. Molesworth Sykes (_Geog. Jour._ X. p. 578) writes: “At\r\n  Tun, I was on the northern edge of the great Dash-i-Lut (Naked\r\n  Desert), which lay between us and Kerman, and which had not been\r\n  traversed, in this particular portion, since the illustrious Marco\r\n  Polo crossed it, in the opposite direction, when travelling from\r\n  Kerman to ‘Tonocain’ _viâ_ Cobinan.” Major Sykes (_Persia_, ch.\r\n  iii.) seems to prove that geographers have, without sufficient\r\n  grounds, divided the great desert of Persia into two regions, that\r\n  to the north being termed Dasht-i-Kavir, and that further south\r\n  the Dasht-i-Lut—and that Lut is the one name for the whole desert,\r\n  Dash-i-Lut being almost a redundancy, and that _Kavir_ (the Arabic\r\n  _Kafr_) is applied to every saline swamp. “This great desert\r\n  stretches from a few miles out of Tehrán practically to the British\r\n  frontier, a distance of about 700 miles.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—I can have no doubt of the genuineness of this passage\r\n  from Ramusio. Indeed some such passage is necessary; otherwise why\r\n  distinguish between three days of desert and four days more of\r\n  desert? The underground stream was probably a subterraneous canal\r\n  (called _Kanát_ or _Kárez_), such as is common in Persia; often\r\n  conducted from a great distance. Here it may have been a relic of\r\n  abandoned cultivation. Khanikoff, on the road between Kermán and\r\n  Yezd, not far west of that which I suppose Marco to be travelling,\r\n  says: “At the fifteen inhabited spots marked upon the map, they\r\n  have water which has been brought from a great distance, and at\r\n  considerable cost, by means of subterranean galleries, to which\r\n  you descend by large and deep wells. Although the water flows at\r\n  some depth, its course is tracked upon the surface by a line of\r\n  more abundant vegetation.” (_Ib._ p. 200.) Elphinstone says he has\r\n  heard of such subterranean conduits 36 miles in length. (I. 398.)\r\n  Polybius speaks of them: “There is no sign of water on the surface;\r\n  but there are many underground channels, and these supply tanks in\r\n  the desert, that are known only to the initiated.... At the time\r\n  when the Persians got the upper hand in Asia, they used to concede\r\n  to such persons as brought spring-water to places previously\r\n  destitute of irrigation, the usufruct for five generations. And\r\n  Taurus being rife with springs, they incurred all the expense and\r\n  trouble that was needed to form these underground channels to great\r\n  distances, insomuch that in these days even the people who make use\r\n  of the water don’t know where the channels begin, or whence the\r\n  water comes.” (X. 28.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n        CONCERNING THE CITY OF COBINAN AND THE THINGS THAT ARE\r\n                              MADE THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCobinan is a large town.{1} The people worship Mahommet. There is much\r\nIron and Steel and _Ondanique_, and they make steel mirrors of great\r\nsize and beauty. They also prepare both _Tutia_ (a thing very good for\r\nthe eyes) and _Spodium_; and I will tell you the process.\r\n\r\nThey have a vein of a certain earth which has the required quality,\r\nand this they put into a great flaming furnace, whilst over the\r\nfurnace there is an iron grating. The smoke and moisture, expelled\r\nfrom the earth of which I speak, adhere to the iron grating, and\r\nthus form _Tutia_, whilst the slag that is left after burning is the\r\n_Spodium_.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—KUH-BANÁN is mentioned by Moḳaddasi (A.D. 985) as one of\r\n  the cities of Bardesír, the most northerly of the five circles into\r\n  which he divides Kermán. (See _Sprenger, Post-und Reise-routen\r\n  des Orients_, p. 77.) It is the subject of an article in the Geog.\r\n  Dictionary of Yáḳút, though it has been there mistranscribed into\r\n  _Kubiyán_ and _Kukiyán_. (See Leipzig ed. 1869, iv. p. 316, and\r\n  _Barbier de Meynard_, _Dict. de la Perse_, p. 498.) And it is also\r\n  indicated by Mr. Abbott (_J. R. G. S._ XXV. 25) as the name of a\r\n  district of Kermán, lying some distance to the east of his route\r\n  when somewhat less than half-way between Yezd and Kermán. It would\r\n  thus, I apprehend, be on or near the route between Kermán and\r\n  Tabbas; one which I believe has been traced by no modern traveller.\r\n  We may be certain that there is now no place at Kuh-Banán deserving\r\n  the title of _une cité grant_, nor is it easy to believe that\r\n  there was in Polo’s time; he applies such terms too profusely. The\r\n  meaning of the name is perhaps “Hill of the Terebinths, or Wild\r\n  Pistachioes,” “a tree which grows abundantly in the recesses of\r\n  bleak, stony, and desert mountains, _e.g._ about Shamákhi, about\r\n  Shiraz, and in the deserts of Luristan and Lar.” (_Kämpfer_, 409,\r\n  413.)\r\n\r\n  [“It is strange that Marco Polo speaks of Kúbenán only on his\r\n  return journey from Kermán; on the down journey he must have been\r\n  told that Kúbenán was in close proximity; it is even probable that\r\n  he passed there, as Persian travellers of those times, when going\r\n  from Kermán to Yazd, and _vice versá_, always called at Kúbenán.”\r\n  (_Houtum-Schindler_, _l.c._ p. 490.) In all histories this name is\r\n  written Kúbenán, not Kúhbenán; the pronunciation to-day is Kóbenán\r\n  and Kobenún.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  I had thought my identification of _Cobinan_ original, but a\r\n  communication from Mr. Abbott, and the opportunity which this\r\n  procured me of seeing his MS. Report already referred to, showed\r\n  that he had anticipated me many years ago. The following is an\r\n  extract: “_Districts of Kerman * * * Kooh Benan_. This is a\r\n  hilly district abounding in fruits, such as grapes, peaches,\r\n  pomegranates, _sinjid_ (sweet-willow), walnuts, melons. A great\r\n  deal of madder and some asafœtida is produced there. _This is\r\n  no doubt the country alluded to by Marco Polo, under the name of\r\n  Cobinam_, as producing iron, brass, and tutty, and which is still\r\n  said to produce iron, copper, and tootea.” There appear to be\r\n  lead mines also in the district, as well as asbestos and sulphur.\r\n  Mr. Abbott adds the names of nine villages, which he was not able\r\n  to verify by comparison. These are Púz, Tarz, Gújard, Aspaj,\r\n  Kuh-i-Gabr, Dahnah, Búghín, Bassab, Radk. The position of Kuh Banán\r\n  is stated to lie between Bahabád (a place also mentioned by Yáḳút\r\n  as producing _Tutia_) and Ráví, but this does not help us, and\r\n  for approximate position we can only fall back on the note in Mr.\r\n  Abbott’s field-book, as published in the _J. R. G. S._, viz. that\r\n  the _District_ lay in the mountains E.S.E. from a caravanserai 10\r\n  miles S.E. of Gudran. To get the seven marches of Polo’s Itinerary\r\n  we must carry the _Town_ of Kuh Banán as far north as this\r\n  indication can possibly admit, for Abbott made only five and a half\r\n  marches from the spot where this observation was made to Kermán.\r\n  Perhaps Polo’s route deviated for the sake of the fresh water.\r\n  That a district, such as Mr. Abbott’s Report speaks of, should lie\r\n  unnoticed, in a tract which our maps represent as part of the Great\r\n  Desert, shows again how very defective our geography of Persia\r\n  still is.\r\n\r\n  [“During the next stage to Darband, we passed ruins that I believe\r\n  to be those of Marco Polo’s ‘Cobinan’ as the modern Kúhbenán does\r\n  not at all fit in with the great traveller’s description, and it\r\n  is just as well to remember that in the East the caravan routes\r\n  seldom change.” (Captain P. M. Sykes, _Geog. Jour._ X. p. 580.—See\r\n  _Persia_, ch. xxiii.)\r\n\r\n  Kuh Banán has been visited by Mr. E. Stack, of the Indian Civil\r\n  Service. (_Six Months in Persia_, London, 1882, I. 230.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—_Tutty_ (_i.e._ Tutia) is in modern English an impure\r\n  oxide of zinc, collected from the flues where brass is made; and\r\n  this appears to be precisely what Polo describes, unless it be\r\n  that in his account the production of tutia from an ore of zinc\r\n  is represented as the object and not an accident of the process.\r\n  What he says reads almost like a condensed translation of Galen’s\r\n  account of _Pompholyx_ and _Spodos_: “Pompholyx is produced in\r\n  copper-smelting as _Cadmia_ is; and it is also produced from\r\n  Cadmia (carbonate of zinc) when put in the furnace, as is done\r\n  (for instance) in Cyprus. The master of the works there, having no\r\n  copper ready for smelting, ordered some pompholyx to be prepared\r\n  from cadmia in my presence. Small pieces of cadmia were thrown into\r\n  the fire in front of the copper-blast. The furnace top was covered,\r\n  with no vent at the crown, and intercepted the soot of the roasted\r\n  cadmia. This, when collected, constitutes _Pompholyx_, whilst that\r\n  which falls on the hearth is called _Spodos_, a great deal of which\r\n  is got in copper-smelting.” Pompholyx, he adds, is an ingredient in\r\n  salves for eye discharges and pustules. (_Galen, De Simpl. Medic._,\r\n  p. ix. in Latin ed., Venice, 1576.) Matthioli, after quoting this,\r\n  says that Pompholyx was commonly known in the laboratories by the\r\n  Arabic name of _Tutia_. I see that pure oxide of zinc is stated to\r\n  form in modern practice a valuable eye-ointment.\r\n\r\n  Teixeira speaks of tutia as found only in Kermán, in a range of\r\n  mountains twelve parasangs from the capital. The ore got here was\r\n  kneaded with water, and set to bake in crucibles in a potter’s\r\n  kiln. When well baked, the crucibles were lifted and emptied, and\r\n  the _tutia_ carried in boxes to Hormuz for sale. This corresponds\r\n  with a modern account in Milburne, which says that the tutia\r\n  imported to India from the Gulf is made from an argillaceous ore of\r\n  zinc, which is moulded into tubular cakes, and baked to a moderate\r\n  hardness. The accurate Garcia da Horta is wrong for once in saying\r\n  that the tutia of Kermán is no mineral, but the ash of a certain\r\n  tree called _Goan_.\r\n\r\n  (_Matth. on Dioscorides_, Ven. 1565, pp. 1338–40; _Teixeira,\r\n  Relacion de Persia_, p. 121; _Milburne’s Or. Commerce_, I. 139;\r\n  _Garcia_, f. 21 v.; _Eng. Cyc._, art. _Zinc_.)\r\n\r\n  [General A. Houtum-Schindler (_Jour. R. As. Soc._ N.S. XIII.\r\n  October, 1881, p. 497) says: “The name Tútíá for collyrium is\r\n  now not used in Kermán. Tútíá, when the name stands alone, is\r\n  sulphate of copper, which in other parts of Persia is known as\r\n  Kát-i-Kebúd; Tútíá-i-sabz (green Tútíá) is sulphate of iron, also\r\n  called Záj-i-síyah. A piece of Tútíá-i-zard (yellow Tútíá) shown\r\n  to me was alum, generally called Záj-i-safíd; and a piece of\r\n  Tútíá-í-safíd (white Tútíá) seemed to be an argillaceous zinc ore.\r\n  Either of these may have been the earth mentioned by Marco Polo\r\n  as being put into the furnace. The lampblack used as collyrium is\r\n  always called Surmah. This at Kermán itself is the soot produced\r\n  by the flame of wicks, steeped in castor oil or goat’s fat, upon\r\n  earthenware saucers. In the high mountainous districts of the\r\n  province, Kúbenán, Páríz, and others, Surmah is the soot of the\r\n  Gavan plant (Garcia’s goan). This plant, a species of Astragalus,\r\n  is on those mountains very fat and succulent; from it also exudes\r\n  the Tragacanth gum. The soot is used dry as an eye-powder, or,\r\n  mixed with tallow, as an eye-salve. It is occasionally collected on\r\n  iron gratings.\r\n\r\n  “Tútíá is the Arabicised word dúdhá, Persian for smokes.\r\n\r\n  “The Shems-ul-loghát calls Tútíá a medicine for eyes, and a\r\n  stone used for the fabrication of Surmah. The Tohfeh says Tútíá\r\n  is of three kinds—yellow and blue mineral Tútíá, Tútíá-i-qalam\r\n  (collyrium) made from roots, and Tútíá resulting from the process\r\n  of smelting copper ore. ‘The best Tútíá-i-qalam comes from Kermán.’\r\n  It adds, ‘Some authors say Surmah is sulphuret of antimony,\r\n  others say it is a composition of iron’; I should say any _black_\r\n  composition used for the eyes is Surmah, be it lampblack, antimony,\r\n  iron, or a mixture of all.\r\n\r\n  “Teixeira’s Tútíá was an impure oxide of zinc, perhaps the\r\n  above-mentioned Tútíá-i-safíd, baked into cakes; it was probably\r\n  the East India Company’s Lapis Tútíá, also called Tutty. The\r\n  Company’s Tutenague and Tutenage, occasionally confounded with\r\n  Tutty, was the so-called ‘Chinese Copper,’ an alloy of copper,\r\n  zinc, and iron, brought from China.”\r\n\r\n  Major Sykes (ch. xxiii.) writes: “I translated Marco’s description\r\n  of _tutia_ (which is also the modern Persian name), to a khán of\r\n  Kubenán, and he assured me that the process was the same to-day;\r\n  spodium he knew nothing about, but the sulphate of zinc is found in\r\n  the hills to the east of Kubenán.”\r\n\r\n  Heyd (_Com._ II. p. 675) says in a note: “Il résulte de l’ensemble\r\n  de ce passage que les matières désignées par Marco Polo sous le nom\r\n  de ‘espodie’ (spodium) étaient des scories métalliques; en général,\r\n  le mot spodium désigne les résidus de la combustion des matières\r\n  végétales ou des os (de l’ivoire).”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n      OF A CERTAIN DESERT THAT CONTINUES FOR EIGHT DAYS’ JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you depart from this City of Cobinan, you find yourself again in a\r\nDesert of surpassing aridity, which lasts for some eight days; here are\r\nneither fruits nor trees to be seen, and what water there is is bitter\r\nand bad, so that you have to carry both food and water. The cattle\r\nmust needs drink the bad water, will they nill they, because of their\r\ngreat thirst. At the end of those eight days you arrive at a Province\r\nwhich is called TONOCAIN. It has a good many towns and villages, and\r\nforms the extremity of Persia towards the North.{1} It also contains an\r\nimmense plain on which is found the ARBRE SOL, which we Christians call\r\nthe _Arbre Sec_; and I will tell you what it is like. It is a tall and\r\nthick tree, having the bark on one side green and the other white; and\r\nit produces a rough husk like that of a chestnut, but without anything\r\nin it. The wood is yellow like box, and very strong, and there are no\r\nother trees near it nor within a hundred miles of it, except on one\r\nside, where you find trees within about ten miles’ distance. And there,\r\nthe people of the country tell you, was fought the battle between\r\nAlexander and King Darius.{2}\r\n\r\nThe towns and villages have great abundance of everything good, for the\r\nclimate is extremely temperate, being neither very hot nor very cold.\r\nThe natives all worship Mahommet, and are a very fine-looking people,\r\nespecially the women, who are surpassingly beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—All that region has been described as “a country divided\r\n  into deserts that are salt, and deserts that are not salt.”\r\n  (_Vigne_, I. 16.) _Tonocain_, as we have seen (ch. xv. note 1), is\r\n  the Eastern Kuhistan of Persia, but extended by Polo, it would seem\r\n  to include the whole of Persian Khorasan. No city in particular\r\n  is indicated as visited by the traveller, but the view I take of\r\n  the position of the _Arbre Sec_, as well as his route through\r\n  Kuh-Banán, would lead me to suppose that he reached the Province of\r\n  TUN-O-KAIN about Tabbas.\r\n\r\n  [“Marco Polo has been said to have traversed a portion of (the\r\n  Dash-i-Kavir, great Salt Desert) on his supposed route from\r\n  Tabbas to Damghan, about 1272; although it is more probable that\r\n  he marched further to the east, and crossed the northern portion\r\n  of the Dash-i-Lut, Great Sand Desert, separating Khorasan in the\r\n  south-east from Kermán, and occupying a sorrowful parallelogram\r\n  between the towns of Neh and Tabbas on the north, and Kermán and\r\n  Yezd on the south.” (Curzon, _Persia_, II. pp. 248 and 251.) Lord\r\n  Curzon adds in a note (p. 248): “The Tunogan of the text which was\r\n  originally mistaken for Damghan, is correctly explained by Yule\r\n  as Tun-o- (_i.e._ and) Káin.” Major Sykes writes (ch. xxiii.): “The\r\n  section of the Lut has not hitherto been rediscovered, but I know\r\n  that it is desert throughout, and it is practically certain that\r\n  Marco ended these unpleasant experiences at Tabas, 150 miles from\r\n  Kubenán. To-day the district is known as Tun-o-Tabas, Káin being\r\n  independent of it.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This is another subject on which a long and somewhat\r\n  discursive note is inevitable.\r\n\r\n  One of the Bulletins of the Soc. de Géographie (sér. III. tom. iii.\r\n  p. 187) contains a perfectly inconclusive endeavour, by M. Roux\r\n  de Rochelle, to identify the _Arbre Sec_ or _Arbre Sol_ with a\r\n  manna-bearing oak alluded to by Q. Curtius as growing in Hyrcania.\r\n  There can be no doubt that the tree described is, as Marsden points\r\n  out, a _Chínár_ or Oriental Plane. Mr. Ernst Meyer, in his learned\r\n  _Geschichte der Botanik_ (Königsberg, 1854–57, IV. 123), objects\r\n  that Polo’s description of the _wood_ does not answer to that\r\n  tree. But, with due allowance, compare with his whole account that\r\n  which Olearius gives of the Chinar, and say if the same tree be\r\n  not meant. “The trees are as tall as the pine, and have very large\r\n  leaves, closely resembling those of the vine. The fruit looks like\r\n  a chestnut, but has no kernel, so it is not eatable. The wood is of\r\n  a very brown colour, and full of veins; the Persians employ it for\r\n  doors and window-shutters, and when these are rubbed with oil they\r\n  are incomparably handsomer than our walnut-wood joinery.” (I. 526.)\r\n  The Chinar-wood is used in Kashmir for gunstocks.\r\n\r\n  The whole tenor of the passage seems to imply that some eminent\r\n  _individual_ Chinar is meant. The appellations given to it vary\r\n  in the different texts. In the G. T. it is styled in this passage,\r\n  “The _Arbre Seule_ which the Christians call the _Arbre Sec_,”\r\n  whilst in ch. cci. of the same (_infra_, Bk. IV. ch. v.) it is\r\n  called “_L’Arbre Sol_, which in the Book of Alexander is called\r\n  _L’Arbre Seche_.” Pauthier has here “_L’Arbre Solque_, que nous\r\n  appelons _L’Arbre Sec_,” and in the later passage “_L’Arbre Seul_,\r\n  que le Livre Alexandre appelle _Arbre Sec_;” whilst Ramusio has\r\n  here “_L’Albero del Sole_ che si chiama per i Cristiani _L’Albor\r\n  Secco_,” and does not contain the later passage. So also I think\r\n  all the old Latin and French printed texts, which are more or less\r\n  based on Pipino’s version, have “The _Tree of the Sun_, which the\r\n  Latins call the _Dry Tree_.”\r\n\r\n  [G. Capus says (_A travers le roy. de Tamerlan_, p. 296) that he\r\n  found at Khodjakent, the remains of an enormous plane-tree or\r\n  _Chinar_, which measured no less than 48 metres (52 yards) in\r\n  circumference at the base, and 9 metres diameter inside the rotten\r\n  trunk; a dozen tourists from Tashkent one day feasted inside, and\r\n  were all at ease.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Pauthier, building as usual on the reading of his own text\r\n  (_Solque_), endeavours to show that this odd word represents\r\n  _Thoulk_, the Arabic name of a tree to which Forskal gave the\r\n  title of _Ficus Vasta_, and this Ficus Vasta he will have to be\r\n  the same as the Chinar. _Ficus Vasta_ would be a strange name\r\n  surely to give to a Plane-tree, but Forskal may be acquitted of\r\n  such an eccentricity. The _Tholaḳ_ (for that seems to be the proper\r\n  vocalisation) is a tree of Arabia Felix, very different from the\r\n  Chinar, for it is the well-known Indian Banyan, or a closely-allied\r\n  species, as may be seen in Forskal’s description. The latter\r\n  indeed says that the Arab botanists called it _Delb_, and that (or\r\n  _Dulb_) is really a synonym for the Chinar. But De Sacy has already\r\n  commented upon this supposed application of the name Delb to the\r\n  _Tholaḳ_ as erroneous. (See _Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica_, pp. cxxiv.\r\n  and 179; _Abdallatif, Rel. de l’Egypte_, p. 80; _J. R. G. S._ VIII.\r\n  275; _Ritter_, VI. 662, 679.)\r\n\r\n  The fact is that the _Solque_ of M. Pauthier’s text is a mere\r\n  copyist’s error in the reduplication of the pronoun _que_. In his\r\n  chief MS. which he cites as A (No. 10,260 of Bibl. Nationale, now\r\n  _Fr_. 5631) we can even see how this might easily happen, for one\r\n  line ends with _Solque_ and the next begins with _que_. The true\r\n  reading is, I doubt not, that which this MS. points to, and which\r\n  the G. Text gives us in the second passage quoted above, viz.\r\n  _Arbre_ SOL, occurring in Ramusio as _Albero del_ SOLE. To make\r\n  this easier of acceptation I must premise two remarks: first, that\r\n  _Sol_ is “the Sun” in both Venetian and Provençal; and, secondly,\r\n  that in the French of that age the prepositional sign is not\r\n  _necessary_ to the genitive. Thus, in Pauthier’s own text we find\r\n  in one of the passages quoted above, “_Le Livre Alexandre_, _i.e._\r\n  Liber Alexandri;” elsewhere, “_Cazan le fils Argon_,” “_à la mère\r\n  sa femme_,” “_Le corps Monseigneur Saint Thomas si est en ceste\r\n  Province_;” in Joinville, “_le commandemant Mahommet_”, “_ceux de\r\n  la_ Haulequa _estoient logiez entour les héberges le soudanc, et\r\n  establiz pour le cors le soudanc garder_;” in Baudouin de Sebourc,\r\n  “_De l’amour Bauduin esprise et enflambée_.”\r\n\r\n  Moreover it is the TREE OF THE SUN that is prominent in the\r\n  legendary History of Alexander, a fact sufficient in itself to rule\r\n  the reading. A character in an old English play says:—\r\n\r\n        “_Peregrine_. Drake was a didapper to Mandevill:\r\n      Candish and Hawkins, Frobisher, all our Voyagers\r\n      Went short of Mandevil. But had he reached\r\n      To this place—here—yes, here—this wilderness,\r\n      And seen the _Trees of the Sun and Moon_, that speak\r\n      And told King Alexander of his death;\r\n      He then\r\n      Had left a passage ope to Travellers\r\n      That now is kept and guarded by Wild Beasts.”\r\n                         (_Broome’s Antipodes_, in _Lamb’s Specimens_.)\r\n\r\n  The same trees are alluded to in an ancient Low German poem in\r\n  honour of St. Anno of Cologne. Speaking of the Four Beasts of\r\n  Daniel’s Vision:—\r\n\r\n      “The third beast was a Libbard;\r\n       Four Eagle’s Wings he had;\r\n       This signified the Grecian Alexander,\r\n       Who with four Hosts went forth to conquer lands\r\n       Even to the World’s End,\r\n       Known by its Golden Pillars.\r\n       In India he the Wilderness broke through\r\n       _With Trees twain he there did speak_,” etc.\r\n                   (In _Schilteri Thesaurus Antiq. Teuton._ tom. i.[1])\r\n\r\n  These oracular Trees of the Sun and Moon, somewhere on the confines\r\n  of India, appear in all the fabulous histories of Alexander, from\r\n  the Pseudo-Callisthenes downwards. Thus Alexander is made to\r\n  tell the story in a letter to Aristotle: “Then came some of the\r\n  towns-people and said, ‘We have to show thee something passing\r\n  strange, O King, and worth thy visiting; for we can show thee trees\r\n  that talk with human speech.’ So they led me to a certain park, in\r\n  the midst of which were the Sun and Moon, and round about them a\r\n  guard of priests of the Sun and Moon. And there stood the two trees\r\n  of which they had spoken, like unto cypress trees; and round about\r\n  them were trees like the myrobolans of Egypt, and with similar\r\n  fruit. And I addressed the two trees that were in the midst of the\r\n  park, the one which was male in the Masculine gender, and the one\r\n  that was female in the Feminine gender. And the name of the Male\r\n  Tree was the Sun, and of the female Tree the Moon, names which\r\n  were in that language _Muthu_ and _Emaūsae_.[2] And the stems were\r\n  clothed with the skins of animals; the male tree with the skins of\r\n  he-beasts, and the female tree with the skins of she-beasts.... And\r\n  at the setting of the Sun, a voice, speaking in the Indian tongue,\r\n  came forth from the (Sun) Tree; and I ordered the Indians who were\r\n  with me to interpret it. But they were afraid and would not,” etc.\r\n  (_Pseudo-Callisth._ ed. Müller, III. 17.)\r\n\r\n  The story as related by Firdusi keeps very near to the Greek as\r\n  just quoted, but does not use the term “Tree of the Sun.” The\r\n  chapter of the Sháh Námeh containing it is entitled _Dídan Sikandar\r\n  dirakht-i-goyárá_, “Alexander’s interview with the Speaking Tree.”\r\n  (_Livre des Rois_, V. 229.) In the _Chanson d’Alixandre_ of Lambert\r\n  le Court and Alex. de Bernay, these trees are introduced as\r\n  follows:—\r\n\r\n      “‘Signor,’ fait Alixandre, ‘je vus voel demander,\r\n       Se des merveilles d’Inde me saves rien conter.’\r\n       Cil li ont respondu: ‘Se tu vius escouter\r\n       Ja te dirons merveilles, s’es poras esprover.\r\n       La sus en ces desers pues ii Arbres trover\r\n       Qui c pies ont de haut, et de grossor sunt per.\r\n       Li Solaus et La Lune les ont fait si serer\r\n       Que sevent tous langages et entendre et parler.’”\r\n                                       (Ed. 1861 (Dinan), p. 357.)\r\n\r\n  Maundevile informs us precisely where these trees are: “A 15\r\n  journeys in lengthe, goynge be the Deserts of the tother side of\r\n  the Ryvere Beumare,” if one could only tell where that is![3] A\r\n  mediæval chronicler also tells us that Ogerus the Dane (_temp.\r\n  Caroli Magni_) conquered all the parts beyond sea from Hierusalem\r\n  to the Trees of the Sun. In the old Italian romance also of\r\n  _Guerino detto il Meschino_, still a chapbook in S. Italy, the Hero\r\n  (ch. lxiii.) visits the Trees of the Sun and Moon. But this is mere\r\n  imitation of the Alexandrian story, and has nothing of interest.\r\n  (_Maundevile_, pp. 297–298; _Fasciculus Temporum_ in _Germ. Script.\r\n  Pistorii Nidani_, II.)\r\n\r\n  It will be observed that the letter ascribed to Alexander describes\r\n  the two oracular trees as resembling two cypress-trees. As such the\r\n  Trees of the Sun and Moon are represented on several extant ancient\r\n  medals, _e.g._ on two struck at Perga in Pamphylia in the time of\r\n  Aurelian. And Eastern story tells us of two vast cypress-trees,\r\n  sacred among the Magians, which grew in Khorasan, one at Kashmar\r\n  near Turshiz, and the other at Farmad near Tuz, and which were said\r\n  to have risen from shoots that Zoroaster brought from Paradise. The\r\n  former of these was sacrilegiously cut down by the order of the\r\n  Khalif Motawakkil, in the 9th century. The trunk was despatched to\r\n  Baghdad on rollers at a vast expense, whilst the branches alone\r\n  formed a load for 1300 camels. The night that the convoy reached\r\n  within one stage of the palace, the Khalif was cut in pieces by his\r\n  own guards. This tree was said to be 1450 years old, and to measure\r\n  33¾ cubits in girth. The locality of _this_ “Arbor Sol” we see\r\n  was in Khorasan, and possibly its fame may have been transferred\r\n  to a representative of another species. The plane, as well as the\r\n  cypress, was one of the distinctive trees of the Magian Paradise.\r\n\r\n  In the Peutingerian Tables we find in the N.E. of Asia the rubric\r\n  “_Hic Alexander Responsum accepit_,” which looks very like an\r\n  allusion to the tale of the Oracular Trees. If so, it is remarkable\r\n  as a suggestion of the antiquity of the Alexandrian Legends, though\r\n  the rubric may of course be an interpolation. The Trees of the Sun\r\n  and Moon appear as located in India Ultima to the east of Persia,\r\n  in a map which is found in MSS. (12th century) of the _Floridus_\r\n  of _Lambertus_; and they are indicated more or less precisely in\r\n  several maps of the succeeding centuries. (_Ouseley’s Travels_, I.\r\n  387; _Dabistan_, I. 307–308; _Santarem, H. de la Cosmog._ II. 189,\r\n  III. 506–513, etc.)\r\n\r\n  Nothing could show better how this legend had possessed men in\r\n  the Middle Ages than the fact that Vincent of Beauvais discerns\r\n  an allusion to these Trees of the Sun and Moon in the blessing of\r\n  Moses on Joseph (as it runs in the Vulgate), “_de pomis fructuum\r\n  Solis ac Lunae_.” (Deut. xxxiii. 14.)\r\n\r\n  Marco has mixt up this legend of the Alexandrian Romance, on the\r\n  authority, as we shall see reason to believe, of some of the\r\n  recompilers of that Romance, with a famous subject of _Christian_\r\n  Legend in that age, the ARBRE SEC or Dry Tree, one form of which\r\n  is related by Maundevile and by Johan Schiltberger. “A lytille fro\r\n  Ebron,” says the former, “is the Mount of Mambre, of the whyche\r\n  the Valeye taketh his name. And there is a Tree of Oke that the\r\n  Saracens clepen _Dirpe_, that is of Abraham’s Tyme, the which men\r\n  clepen THE DRYE TREE.” [Schiltberger adds that the heathen call it\r\n  _Kurru Thereck_, _i.e._ (Turkish) _Ḳúrú Dirakht_ = Dry Tree.] “And\r\n  theye seye that it hathe ben there sithe the beginnynge of the\r\n  World; and was sumtyme grene and bare Leves, unto the Tyme that\r\n  Oure Lord dyede on the Cros; and thanne it dryede; and so dyden\r\n  alle the Trees that weren thanne in the World. And summe seyn be\r\n  hire Prophecyes that a Lord, a Prynce of the West syde of the\r\n  World, shalle wynnen the Lond of Promyssioun, _i.e._ the Holy Lond,\r\n  withe Helpe of Cristene Men, and he schalle do synge a Masse under\r\n  that Drye Tree, and than the Tree shall wexen grene and bere both\r\n  Fruyt and Leves. And thorghe that Myracle manye Sarazines and Jewes\r\n  schulle ben turned to Cristene Feithe. And, therefore, they dou\r\n  gret Worschipe thereto, and kepen it fulle besyly. And alle be it\r\n  so that it be drye, natheless yit he berethe great vertue,” etc.\r\n\r\n  The tradition seems to have altered with circumstances, for a\r\n  traveller of nearly two centuries later (Friar Anselmo, 1509)\r\n  describes the oak of Abraham at Hebron as a tree of dense and\r\n  verdant foliage: “The Saracens make their devotions at it, and\r\n  hold it in great veneration, for it has remained thus green from\r\n  the days of Abraham until now; and they tie scraps of cloth on its\r\n  branches inscribed with some of their writing, and believe that if\r\n  any one were to cut a piece off that tree he would die within the\r\n  year.” Indeed even before Maundevile’s time Friar Burchard (1283)\r\n  had noticed that though the famous old tree was dry, another had\r\n  sprung from its roots. And it still has a representative.\r\n\r\n  As long ago as the time of Constantine a fair was held under the\r\n  Terebinth of Mamre, which was the object of many superstitious\r\n  rites and excesses. The Emperor ordered these to be put a stop to,\r\n  and a church to be erected at the spot. In the time of Arculph (end\r\n  of 7th century) the dry trunk still existed under the roof of this\r\n  church; just as the immortal Banyan-tree of Prág exists to this day\r\n  in a subterranean temple in the Fort of Allahabad.\r\n\r\n  It is evident that the story of the Dry Tree had got a great vogue\r\n  in the 13th century. In the _Jus du Pelerin_, a French drama of\r\n  Polo’s age, the Pilgrim says:—\r\n\r\n      “S’ai puis en maint bon lieu et à maint saint esté,\r\n       S’ai esté au _Sec-Arbre_ et dusc’à Duresté.”\r\n\r\n  And in another play of slightly earlier date (_Le Jus de St.\r\n  Nicolas_), the King of Africa, invaded by the Christians, summons\r\n  all his allies and feudatories, among whom appear the Admirals of\r\n  Coine (_Iconium_) and Orkenie (_Hyrcania_), and the _Amiral d’outre\r\n  l’Arbre-Sec_ (as it were of “the Back of Beyond”) in whose country\r\n  the only current coin is millstones! Friar Odoric tells us that he\r\n  heard at Tabriz that the _Arbor Secco_ existed in a mosque of that\r\n  city; and Clavijo relates a confused story about it in the same\r\n  locality. Of the _Dürre Baum_ at Tauris there is also a somewhat\r\n  pointless legend in a Cologne MS. of the 14th century, professing\r\n  to give an account of the East. There are also some curious verses\r\n  concerning a mystical _Dürre Bom_ quoted by Fabricius from an old\r\n  Low German Poem; and we may just allude to that other mystic _Arbor\r\n  Secco_ of Dante—\r\n\r\n          —“una pianta dispogliata\r\n      Di fiori e d’altra fronda in ciascun ramo,”\r\n\r\n  though the dark symbolism in the latter case seems to have a\r\n  different bearing.\r\n\r\n  (_Maundevile_, p. 68; _Schiltberger_, p. 113; Anselm. in _Canisii\r\n  Thesaurus_, IV. 781; _Pereg. Quat._ p. 81; _Niceph. Callist._ VIII.\r\n  30; _Théâtre Français au Moyen Age_, pp. 97, 173; _Cathay_, p. 48;\r\n  _Clavijo_, p. 90; _Orient und Occident_, Göttingen, 1867, vol.\r\n  i.; _Fabricii Vet. Test. Pseud._, etc., I. 1133; _Dante, Purgat._\r\n  xxxii. 35.)\r\n\r\n  But why does Polo bring this _Arbre Sec_ into connection with the\r\n  Sun Tree of the Alexandrian Legend? I cannot answer this to my own\r\n  entire satisfaction, but I can show that such a connection had been\r\n  imagined in his time.\r\n\r\n  Paulin Paris, in a notice of MS. No. 6985. (_Fonds Ancien_) of\r\n  the National Library, containing a version of the _Chansons de\r\n  Geste d’Alixandre_, based upon the work of L. Le Court and Alex.\r\n  de Bernay, but with additions of later date, notices amongst these\r\n  latter the visit of Alexander to the Valley Perilous, where he\r\n  sees a variety of wonders, among others the _Arbre des Pucelles_.\r\n  Another tree at a great distance from the last is called the ARBRE\r\n  SEC, and reveals to Alexander the secret of the fate which attends\r\n  him in Babylon. (_Les MSS. Français de la Bibl. du Roi_, III.\r\n  105.)[4] Again the English version of _King Alisaundre_, published\r\n  in Weber’s Collection, shows clearly enough that in _its_ French\r\n  original the term _Arbre Sec_ was applied to the Oracular Trees,\r\n  though the word has been miswritten, and misunderstood by Weber.\r\n  The King, as in the Greek and French passages already quoted,\r\n  meeting two old churls, asks if they know of any marvel in those\r\n  parts:—\r\n\r\n      “‘Ye, par ma fay,’ quoth heo,\r\n       ‘A great merveille we wol telle the;\r\n       That is hennes in even way\r\n       The mountas of ten daies journey,\r\n       Thou shalt find trowes[5] two:\r\n       Seyntes and holy they buth bo;\r\n       Higher than in othir countray all.\r\n       ARBESET men heom callith.’\r\n         *     *     *     *     *\r\n       ‘Sire Kyng,’ quod on, ‘by myn eyghe\r\n       Either Trough is an hundrod feet hygh,\r\n       They stondith up into the skye;\r\n       That on to the _Sonne_, sikirlye;\r\n       That othir, we tellith the nowe,\r\n       Is sakret in the _Mone_ vertue.’”\r\n                                (_Weber_, I. 277.)\r\n\r\n  Weber’s glossary gives “_Arbeset_ = Strawberry Tree, _arbous,\r\n  arbousier, arbutus_”; but that is nonsense.\r\n\r\n  Further, in the French Prose Romance of Alexander, which is\r\n  contained in the fine volume in the British Museum known as the\r\n  Shrewsbury Book (Reg. XV. e. 6), though we do not find the Arbre\r\n  Sec so named, we find it described and pictorially represented.\r\n  The Romance (fol. xiiii. v.) describes Alexander and his chief\r\n  companions as ascending a certain mountain by 2500 steps which were\r\n  attached to a golden chain. At the top they find the golden Temple\r\n  of the Sun and an old man asleep within. It goes on:—\r\n\r\n  “Quant le viellart les vit si leur demanda s’ils vouloient veoir\r\n  les Arbres sacrez de la Lune et du Soleil que nous annuncent les\r\n  choses qui sont à avenir. Quant Alexandre ouy ce si fut rempli de\r\n  mult grant ioye. Si lui respondirent, ‘Ouye sur, nous les voulons\r\n  veoir.’ Et cil lui dist, ‘Se tu es nez de prince malle et de\r\n  femelle il te convient entrer en celui lieu.’ Et Alexandre lui\r\n  respondi, ‘Nous somes nez de compagne malle et de femelle.’ Dont\r\n  se leve le viellart du lit ou il gesoit, et leur dist, ‘Hostez\r\n  vos vestemens et vos chauces.’ Et Tholomeus et Antigonus et\r\n  Perdiacas le suivrent. Lors comencèrent à aler parmy la forest qui\r\n  estoit enclose en merveilleux labour. Illec trouvèrent les arbres\r\n  semblables à loriers et oliviers. Et estoient de cent pies de\r\n  haults, et decouroit d’eulz incens ypobaume[6] à grant quantité.\r\n  Après entrèrent plus avant en la forest, et trouvèrent _une arbre\r\n  durement hault qui n’avoit ne fueille ne fruit_. Si seoit sur cet\r\n  arbre une grant oysel qui avoit en son chief une creste qui estoit\r\n  semblable au paon, et les plumes du col resplendissants come fin\r\n  or. Et avoit la couleur de rose. Dont lui dist le viellart, ‘Cet\r\n  oysel dont vous vous merveillez est appelés Fenis, lequel n’a\r\n  nul pareil en tout le monde.’ Dont passèrent outre, et allèrent\r\n  aux Arbres du Soleil et de la Lune. Et quant ils y furent venus,\r\n  si leur dist le viellart, ‘Regardez en haut, et pensez en votre\r\n  coeur ce que vous vouldrez demander, et ne le dites de la bouche.’\r\n  Alisandre luy demanda en quel language donnent les Arbres response\r\n  aux gens. Et il lui respondit, ‘L’Arbre du Soleil commence à\r\n  parler Indien.’ Dont baisa Alexandre les arbres, et comença en son\r\n  ceur à penser s’il conquesteroit tout le monde et retourneroit en\r\n  Macedonie atout son ost. Dont lui respondit l’Arbre du Soleil,\r\n  ‘Alexandre tu seras Roy de tout le monde, mais Macedonie tu ne\r\n  verras jamais,’” etc.\r\n\r\n  The appearance of the Arbre Sec in Maps of the 15th century,\r\n  such as those of Andrea Bianco (1436) and Fra Mauro (1459), may\r\n  be ascribed to the influence of Polo’s own work; but a more\r\n  genuine evidence of the prevalence of the legend is found in the\r\n  celebrated Hereford Map constructed in the 13th century by Richard\r\n  de Haldingham. This, in the vicinity of India and the Terrestrial\r\n  Paradise, exhibits a Tree with the rubric “_Albor Balsami est Arbor\r\n  Sicca_.”\r\n\r\n  The legends of the Dry Tree were probably spun out of the words\r\n  of the Vulgate in Ezekiel xvii. 24: “_Humiliavi lignum sublime et\r\n  exaltavi lignum humile; et siccavi lignum viride_ et frondescere\r\n  feci lignum aridum.” Whether the _Rue de l’Arbre Sec_ in Paris\r\n  derives its name from the legend I know not. [The name of the\r\n  street is taken from an old sign-board; some say it is derived\r\n  from the gibbet placed in the vicinity, but this is more than\r\n  doubtful.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: =Comment les arbres du soleil et De la lune\r\n    prophetiserent la mort alixandre.=]\r\n\r\n  The actual tree to which Polo refers in the text was probably\r\n  one of those so frequent in Persia, to which age, position, or\r\n  accident has attached a character of sanctity, and which are styled\r\n  _Dirakht-i-Fazl_, Trees of Excellence or Grace, and often receive\r\n  titles appropriate to Holy Persons. Vows are made before them, and\r\n  pieces torn from the clothes of the votaries are hung upon the\r\n  branches or nailed to the trunks. To a tree of such a character,\r\n  imposing in decay, Lucan compares Pompey:\r\n\r\n             “Stat magni nominis umbra.\r\n      Qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro,\r\n      _Exuvias veteres populi sacrataque gestans\r\n      Dona ducum_      *     *     *     *     *\r\n      —Quamvis primo nutet casura sub Euro,\r\n      Tot circum silvae firmo se robore tollant,\r\n      Sola tamen colitur.”\r\n                                         (_Pharsalia_, I. 135.)\r\n\r\n  The Tree of Mamre was evidently precisely one of this class; and\r\n  those who have crossed the Suez Desert before railway days will\r\n  remember such a _Dirakht-i-Fazl_, an aged mimosa, a veritable\r\n  _Arbre Seul_ (could we accept that reading), that stood just\r\n  half-way across the Desert, streaming with the _exuviae veteres_ of\r\n  Mecca Pilgrims. The majority of such holy trees in Persia appear\r\n  to be Plane-trees. Admiration for the beauty of this tree seems to\r\n  have occasionally risen into superstitious veneration from a very\r\n  old date. Herodotus relates that the Carians, after their defeat\r\n  by the Persians on the Marsyas, rallied in the sacred grove of\r\n  Plane-trees at Labranda. And the same historian tells how, some\r\n  years later, Xerxes on his march to Greece decorated a beautiful\r\n  Chinar with golden ornaments. Mr. Hamilton, in the same region,\r\n  came on the remains of a giant of the species, which he thought\r\n  might possibly be the very same. Pliny rises to enthusiasm in\r\n  speaking of some noble Plane-trees in Lycia and elsewhere. Chardin\r\n  describes one grand and sacred specimen, called King Hosain’s\r\n  Chinar, and said to be more than 1000 years old, in a suburb of\r\n  Ispahan, and another hung with amulets, rags, and tapers in a\r\n  garden at Shiraz.[7] One sacred tree mentioned by the Persian\r\n  geographer Hamd Allah as distinguishing the grave of a holy man at\r\n  Bostam in Khorasan (the species is not named, at least by Ouseley,\r\n  from whom I borrow this) comes into striking relation with the\r\n  passage in our text. The story went that it had been the staff of\r\n  Mahomed; as such it had been transmitted through many generations,\r\n  until it was finally deposited in the grave of Abu Abdallah\r\n  Dásitáni, where it struck root and put forth branches. And it is\r\n  explicitly called _Dirakht-i-Khushk_, _i.e._ literally _L’ARBRE\r\n  SEC_.\r\n\r\n  This last legend belongs to a large class. The staff of Adam,\r\n  which was created in the twilight of the approaching Sabbath, was\r\n  bestowed on him in Paradise and handed down successively to Enoch\r\n  and the line of Patriarchs. After the death of Joseph it was set\r\n  in Jethro’s garden, and there grew untouched, till Moses came and\r\n  got his rod from it. In another form of the legend it is Seth who\r\n  gets a branch of the Tree of Life, and from this Moses afterwards\r\n  obtains his rod of power. These Rabbinical stories seem in later\r\n  times to have been developed into the Christian legends of the wood\r\n  destined to form the Cross, such as they are told in the Golden\r\n  Legend or by Godfrey of Viterbo, and elaborated in Calderon’s\r\n  _Sibila del Oriente_. Indeed, as a valued friend who has consulted\r\n  the latter for me suggests, probably all the Arbre Sec Legends of\r\n  Christendom bore mystic reference to the Cross. In Calderon’s play\r\n  the Holy Rood, seen in vision, is described as a Tree:—\r\n\r\n        ————“cuyas hojas,\r\n      Secas mustias y marchitas,\r\n      Desnudo el tronco dejaban\r\n      Que, entre mil copas floridas\r\n      De los árboles, el solo\r\n      Sin pompa y sin bizaria\r\n      Era cadáver del prado.”\r\n\r\n  There are several Dry-Tree stories among the wonders of Buddhism;\r\n  one is that of a sacred tree visited by the Chinese pilgrims to\r\n  India, which had grown from the twig which Sakya, in Hindu fashion,\r\n  had used as a tooth-brush; and I think there is a like story in our\r\n  own country of the Glastonbury Thorn having grown from the staff of\r\n  Joseph of Arimathea.\r\n\r\n  [“St Francis’ Church is a large pile, neere which, yet a little\r\n  without the Citty, growes a tree which they report in their legend\r\n  grew from the Saint’s Staff, which on going to sleepe he fixed\r\n  in the ground, and at his waking found it had grown a large tree.\r\n  They affirm that the wood of its decoction cures sundry diseases.”\r\n  (_Evelyn’s Diary_, October, 1644.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In the usual form of the mediæval legend, Adam, drawing near his\r\n  end, sends Seth to the gate of Paradise, to seek the promised Oil\r\n  of Mercy. The Angel allows Seth to put his head in at the gate.\r\n  Doing so (as an old English version gives it)—\r\n\r\n                                         ————“he saw a fair Well,\r\n      Of whom all the waters on earth cometh, as the Book us doth tell;\r\n      Over the Well stood a Tree, with bowës broad and lere\r\n      Ac it _ne bare leaf ne rind, but as it for-olded were_;\r\n      A nadder it had beclipt about, all naked withouten skin,\r\n      That was the Tree and the Nadder that first made Adam do sin!”\r\n\r\n  The Adder or Serpent is coiled about the denuded stem; the upper\r\n  branches reach to heaven, and bear at the top a new-born wailing\r\n  infant, swathed in linen, whilst (here we quote a French version)—\r\n\r\n      “Les larmes qui de lui issoient\r\n       Contreval l’Arbre en avaloient;\r\n       Adonc regarda l’enfant Seth\r\n       Tout contreval de L’ARBRE SECQ;\r\n       Les rachines qui le tenoient\r\n       Jusques en Enfer s’en aloient,\r\n       Les larmes qui de lui issirent\r\n       Jusques dedans Enfer cheïrent.”\r\n\r\n  The Angel gives Seth three kernels from the fruit of the Tree.\r\n  Seth returns home and finds his father dead. He buries him in _the\r\n  valley of Hebron_, and places the three grains under his tongue. A\r\n  triple shoot springs up of Cedar, Cypress, and Pine, symbolising\r\n  the three Persons of the Trinity. The three eventually unite into\r\n  one stem, and this tree survives in various forms, and through\r\n  various adventures in connection with the Scripture History, till\r\n  it is found at the bottom of the Pool of Bethesda, to which it had\r\n  imparted healing Virtue, and is taken thence to form the Cross on\r\n  which Our Lord suffered.\r\n\r\n  The English version quoted above is from a MS. of the 14th century\r\n  in the Bodleian, published by Dr. Morris in his collection of\r\n  _Legends of the Holy Rood_. I have modernised the spelling of the\r\n  lines quoted, without altering the words. The French citation is\r\n  from a MS. in the Vienna Library, from which extracts are given\r\n  by Sign. Adolfo Mussafia in his curious and learned tract (_Sulla\r\n  Legenda del Legno della Croce_, Vienna, 1870), which gives a full\r\n  account of the fundamental legend and its numerous variations. The\r\n  examination of these two works, particularly Sign. Mussafia’s,\r\n  gives an astonishing impression of the copiousness with which such\r\n  Christian Mythology, as it may fairly be called, was diffused and\r\n  multiplied. There are in the paper referred to notices of between\r\n  fifty and sixty different _works_ (not MSS. or _copies_ of works\r\n  merely) containing this legend in various European languages.\r\n\r\n  (_Santarem_, III. 380, II. 348; _Ouseley_, I. 359 _seqq._ and\r\n  391; _Herodotus_, VII. 31; _Pliny_, XII. 5; _Chardin_, VII.\r\n  410, VIII. 44 and 426; _Fabricius_, _Vet. Test. Pseud._ I. 80\r\n  _seqq._; _Cathay_, p. 365; _Beal’s Fah-Hian_, 72 and 78; _Pèlerins\r\n  Bouddhistes_, II. 292; _Della Valle_, II. 276–277.)\r\n\r\n  He who injured the holy tree of Bostam, we are told, perished the\r\n  same day: a general belief in regard to those _Trees of Grace_, of\r\n  which we have already seen instances in regard to the sacred trees\r\n  of Zoroaster and the Oak of Hebron. We find the same belief in\r\n  Eastern Africa, where certain trees, regarded by the natives with\r\n  superstitious reverence, which they express by driving in votive\r\n  nails and suspending rags, are known to the European residents\r\n  by the vulgar name of _Devil Trees_. Burton relates a case of\r\n  the verification of the superstition in the death of an English\r\n  merchant who had cut down such a tree, and of four members of his\r\n  household. It is the old story which Ovid tells; and the tree which\r\n  Erisichthon felled was a _Dirakht-i-Fazl_:\r\n\r\n           “Vittae mediam, memoresque tabellae\r\n      Sertaque cingebant, voti argumenta potentis.”\r\n                                       (_Metamorph._ VIII. 744.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Chinar, or Oriental Plane.]\r\n\r\n  Though the coincidence with our text of Hamd Allah’s Dry Tree is\r\n  very striking, I am not prepared to lay stress on it as an argument\r\n  for the geographical determination of Marco’s _Arbre Sec_. His use\r\n  of the title more than once to characterise the whole frontier of\r\n  Khorasan can hardly have been a mere whim of his own: and possibly\r\n  some explanation of that circumstance will yet be elicited from the\r\n  Persian historians or geographers of the Mongol era.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile it is in the vicinity of Bostam or Damghan that I\r\n  should incline to place this landmark. If no one _very_ cogent\r\n  reason points to this, a variety of minor ones do so; such as the\r\n  direction of the traveller’s journey from Kermán through Kuh Banán;\r\n  the apparent vicinity of a great Ismailite fortress, as will be\r\n  noticed in the next chapter; the connection twice indicated (see\r\n  _Prologue_, ch. xviii. note 6, and Bk. IV. ch. v.) of the Arbre Sec\r\n  with the headquarters of Ghazan Khan in watching the great passes,\r\n  of which the principal ones debouche at Bostam, at which place\r\n  also buildings erected by Ghazan still exist; and the statement\r\n  that the decisive battle between Alexander and Darius was placed\r\n  there by local tradition. For though no such battle took place in\r\n  that region, we know that Darius was murdered near Hecatompylos.\r\n  Some place this city west of Bostam, near Damghan; others east of\r\n  it, about Jah Jerm; Ferrier has strongly argued for the vicinity\r\n  of Bostam itself. Firdusi indeed places the final battle on the\r\n  confines of Kermán, and the death of Darius within that province.\r\n  But this could not have been the tradition Polo met with.\r\n\r\n  I may add that the temperate climate of Bostam is noticed in words\r\n  almost identical with Polo’s by both Fraser and Ferrier.\r\n\r\n  The Chinar abounds in Khorasan (as far as any tree can be said to\r\n  _abound_ in Persia), and even in the Oases of Tun-o-Kain wherever\r\n  there is water. Travellers quoted by Ritter notice Chinars of great\r\n  size and age at Shahrúd, near Bostam, at Meyomid, and at Mehr,\r\n  west of Sabzawar, which last are said to date from the time of\r\n  Naoshirwan (7th century). There is a town to the N.W. of Meshid\r\n  called _Chinárán_, “The Planes.” P. Della Valle, we may note, calls\r\n  Tehran “la città dei platani.”\r\n\r\n  The following note by De Sacy regarding the Chinar has already been\r\n  quoted by Marsden, and though it may be doubtful whether the term\r\n  Arbre Sec had any relation to the idea expressed, it seems to me\r\n  too interesting to be omitted: “Its sterility seems to have become\r\n  proverbial among certain people of the East. For in a collection\r\n  of sundry moral sentences pertaining to the Sabaeans or Christians\r\n  of St. John ... we find the following: ‘The vainglorious man is\r\n  like a showy Plane Tree, rich in boughs but producing nothing, and\r\n  affording no fruit to its owner.’” The same reproach of sterility\r\n  is cast at the Plane by Ovid’s Walnut:—\r\n\r\n      “At postquam platanis, _sterilem praebentibus umbram_,\r\n         Uberior quâvis arbore venit honos;\r\n       Nos quoque fructiferae, si nux modo ponor in illis,\r\n         Coepimus in patulas luxuriare comas.”    (_Nux_, 17–20.)\r\n\r\n  I conclude with another passage from Khanikoff, though put forward\r\n  in special illustration of what I believe to be a mistaken reading\r\n  (_Arbre Seul_): “Where the Chinar is of spontaneous growth, or\r\n  occupies the centre of a vast and naked plain, this tree is even\r\n  in our own day invested with a quite exceptional veneration, and\r\n  the locality often comes to be called ‘The Place of the Solitary\r\n  Tree.’” (_J.

Quibus dicebat: ‘Non est appellata arbor sicca recto\r\n  nomine, sed arbor Seth, quoniam Seth, filius Adae, primi patris\r\n  nostri, eam plantavit.’ Et ad arborem Seth fecit eos ducere,\r\n  prohibens eos, ne arborem transmearent, sed [si?] ad patriam suam\r\n  redire desiderarent. Et cum appropinquassent, de pulcritudine\r\n  arboris mirati sunt; erat enim magnae immensitatis et miri decoris.\r\n  Omnium enim colorum varietas inerat arbori, condensitas foliorum\r\n  et fructuum diversorum; diversitas avium omnium, quae sub coelo\r\n  sunt. Folia vero invicem se repercutientia dulcissimae melodiae\r\n  modulamine resonabant, et aves amoenos cantus ultra quam credi\r\n  potest promebant; et odor suavissimus profudit eos, ita quod\r\n  paradisi amoenitate fuisse. Et cum admirantes tantam pulcritudinem\r\n  aspicerent, unus sociorum aliquo eorum maior aetate, cogitans\r\n  [cogitavit?] intra se, quod senior esset et, si inde rediret, cito\r\n  aliquo casu mori posset. Et cum haec secum cogitasset, coepit\r\n  arborem transire, et cum transisset, advocans socios, iussit eos\r\n  post se ad locum amoenissimum, quem ante se videbat plenum deliciis\r\n  sibi paratum [paratis?] festinare. At illi retrogressi sunt ad\r\n  regem, scilicet presbiterum Iohannem. Quos donis amplis ditavit, et\r\n  qui cum eo morari voluerunt libenter et honorifice detinuit.

(_Ib._ 303.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                CONCERNING THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMulehet is a country in which the Old Man of the Mountain dwelt in\r\nformer days; and the name means “_Place of the Aram_.” I will tell you\r\nhis whole history as related by Messer Marco Polo, who heard it from\r\nseveral natives of that region.\r\n\r\nThe Old Man was called in their language ALOADIN. He had caused a\r\ncertain valley between two mountains to be enclosed, and had turned\r\nit into a garden, the largest and most beautiful that ever was seen,\r\nfilled with every variety of fruit. In it were erected pavilions and\r\npalaces the most elegant that can be imagined, all covered with\r\ngilding and exquisite painting. And there were runnels too, flowing\r\nfreely with wine and milk and honey and water; and numbers of ladies\r\nand of the most beautiful damsels in the world, who could play on all\r\nmanner of instruments, and sung most sweetly, and danced in a manner\r\nthat it was charming to behold. For the Old Man desired to make his\r\npeople believe that this was actually Paradise. So he had fashioned it\r\nafter the description that Mahommet gave of his Paradise, to wit, that\r\nit should be a beautiful garden running with conduits of wine and milk\r\nand honey and water, and full of lovely women for the delectation of\r\nall its inmates. And sure enough the Saracens of those parts believed\r\nthat it _was_ Paradise!\r\n\r\nNow no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those whom he intended\r\nto be his ASHISHIN. There was a Fortress at the entrance to the Garden,\r\nstrong enough to resist all the world, and there was no other way to\r\nget in. He kept at his Court a number of the youths of the country,\r\nfrom 12 to 20 years of age, such as had a taste for soldiering, and to\r\nthese he used to tell tales about Paradise, just as Mahommet had been\r\nwont to do, and they believed in him just as the Saracens believe in\r\nMahommet. Then he would introduce them into his garden, some four, or\r\nsix, or ten at a time, having first made them drink a certain potion\r\nwhich cast them into a deep sleep, and then causing them to be lifted\r\nand carried in. So when they awoke, they found themselves in the\r\nGarden.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Says the venerable Sire de Joinville: “_Le Vieil de la\r\n  Montaingne ne créoit pas en Mahommet, ainçois créoit en la Loi\r\n  de Haali, qui fu Oncle Mahommet._” This is a crude statement,\r\n  no doubt, but it has a germ of truth. Adherents of the family\r\n  of ’Ali as the true successors of the Prophet existed from the\r\n  tragical day of the death of Husain, and among these, probably\r\n  owing to the secrecy with which they were compelled to hold their\r\n  allegiance, there was always a tendency to all manner of strange\r\n  and mystical doctrines; as in one direction to the glorification\r\n  of ’Ali as a kind of incarnation of the Divinity, a character\r\n  in which his lineal representatives were held in some manner to\r\n  partake; in another direction to the development of Pantheism, and\r\n  release from all positive creed and precepts. Of these Aliites,\r\n  eventually called _Shiáhs_, a chief sect, and parent of many\r\n  heretical branches, were the Ismailites, who took their name, from\r\n  the seventh Imam, whose return to earth they professed to expect\r\n  at the end of the World. About A.D. 1090 a branch of the Ismaili\r\n  stock was established by Hassan, son of Sabah, in the mountainous\r\n  districts of Northern Persia; and, before their suppression by the\r\n  Mongols, 170 years later, the power of the quasi-spiritual dynasty\r\n  which Hassan founded had spread over the Eastern Kohistan, at\r\n  least as far as Ḳáïn. Their headquarters were at Alamút (“Eagle’s\r\n  Nest”), about 32 miles north-east of Ḳazwin, and all over the\r\n  territory which they held they established fortresses of great\r\n  strength. De Sacy seems to have proved that they were called\r\n  _Hashíshíya_ or _Hashíshín_, from their use of the preparation\r\n  of hemp called _Hashísh_; and thence, through their system of\r\n  murder and terrorism, came the modern application of the word\r\n  Assassin. The original aim of this system was perhaps that of a\r\n  kind of _Vehmgericht_, to punish or terrify orthodox persecutors\r\n  who were too strong to be faced with the sword. I have adopted\r\n  in the text one of the readings of the G. Text _Asciscin_, as\r\n  expressing the original word with the greatest accuracy that\r\n  Italian spelling admits. In another author we find it as _Chazisii_\r\n  (see _Bollandists_, May, vol. ii. p. xi.); Joinville calls\r\n  them _Assacis_; whilst Nangis and others corrupt the name into\r\n  _Harsacidae_, and what not.\r\n\r\n  The explanation of the name MULEHET as it is in Ramusio, or\r\n  _Mulcete_ as it is in the G. Text (the last expressing in\r\n  Rusticiano’s Pisan tongue the strongly aspirated _Mulhĕtĕ_), is\r\n  given by the former: “This name of Mulehet is as much as to say\r\n  in the Saracen tongue ‘_The Abode of Heretics_,’” the fact being\r\n  that it does represent the Arabic term _Mulhid_, pl. _Muláhidah_,\r\n  “Impii, heretici,” which is in the Persian histories (as of\r\n  Rashíduddín and Wassáf) the title most commonly used to indicate\r\n  this community, and which is still applied by orthodox Mahomedans\r\n  to the Nosairis, Druses, and other sects of that kind, more or\r\n  less kindred to the Ismaili. The writer of the _Tabakat-i-Násiri_\r\n  calls the sectarians of Alamút _Muláhidat-ul-maut_, “Heretics\r\n  of Death.”[1] The curious reading of the G. Text which we have\r\n  preserved “_vaut à dire des_ Aram,” should be read as we have\r\n  rendered it. I conceive that Marco was here unconsciously using one\r\n  Oriental term to explain another. For it seems possible to explain\r\n  _Aram_ only as standing for _Harám_, in the sense of “wicked” or\r\n  “reprobate.”\r\n\r\n  In Pauthier’s Text, instead of _des aram_, we find “_veult dire en\r\n  françois_ Diex Terrien,” or Terrestrial God. This may have been\r\n  substituted, in the correction of the original rough dictation,\r\n  from a perception that the first expression was unintelligible. The\r\n  new phrase does not indeed convey the meaning of _Muláhidah_, but\r\n  it expresses a main characteristic of the heretical doctrine. The\r\n  correction was probably made by Polo himself; it is certainly of\r\n  very early date. For in the romance of Bauduin de Sebourc, which I\r\n  believe dates early in the 14th century, the Caliph, on witnessing\r\n  the extraordinary devotion of the followers of the Old Man (see\r\n  note 1, ch. xxiv.), exclaims:\r\n\r\n      “Par Mahon ...\r\n       Vous estes _Diex en terre_, autre coze n’i a!” (I. p. 360.)\r\n\r\n  So also Fr. Jacopo d’Aqui in the _Imago Mundi_, says of the\r\n  Assassins: “Dicitur iis quod sunt in Paradiso magno _Dei\r\n  Terreni_”—expressions, no doubt, taken in both cases from Polo’s\r\n  book.\r\n\r\n  Khanikoff, and before him J. R. Forster, have supposed that the\r\n  name _Mulehet_ represents _Alamút_. But the resemblance is much\r\n  closer and more satisfactory to _Mulhid_ or _Muláhidah_. _Mulhet_\r\n  is precisely the name by which the kingdom of the Ismailites is\r\n  mentioned in Armenian history, and _Mulihet_ is already applied\r\n  in the same way by Rabbi Benjamin in the 12th century, and by\r\n  Rubruquis in the 13th. The Chinese narrative of Hulaku’s expedition\r\n  calls it the kingdom of _Mulahi_. (_Joinville_, p. 138; _J. As._\r\n  sér. II., tom. xii. 285; _Benj. Tudela_, p. 106; _Rub._ p. 265;\r\n  _Rémusat_, _Nouv. Mélanges_, I. 176; _Gaubil_, p. 128; _Pauthier_,\r\n  pp. cxxxix.–cxli.; _Mon. Hist. Patr. Scriptorum_, III. 1559,\r\n  Turin, 1848.) [Cf. on _Mulehet_, _melahideh_, Heretics, plural\r\n  of _molhid_, Heretic, my note, pp. 476–482 of my ed. of Friar\r\n  Odoric.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  “Old Man of the Mountain” was the title applied by the Crusaders\r\n  to the chief of that branch of the sect which was settled in the\r\n  mountains north of Lebanon, being a translation of his popular\r\n  Arabic title _Shaikh-ul-Jibal_. But according to Hammer this title\r\n  properly belonged, as Polo gives it, to the Prince of Alamút,\r\n  who never called himself Sultan, Malik, or Amir; and this seems\r\n  probable, as his territory was known as the _Balad-ul-Jibal_. (See\r\n  _Abulf._ in _Büsching_, V. 319.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Elliot, II. 290.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n             HOW THE OLD MAN USED TO TRAIN HIS ASSASSINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen therefore they awoke, and found themselves in a place so charming,\r\nthey deemed that it was Paradise in very truth. And the ladies and\r\ndamsels dallied with them to their hearts’ content, so that they had\r\nwhat young men would have; and with their own good will they never\r\nwould have quitted the place.\r\n\r\nNow this Prince whom we call the Old One kept his Court in grand and\r\nnoble style, and made those simple hill-folks about him believe firmly\r\nthat he was a great Prophet. And when he wanted one of his _Ashishin_\r\nto send on any mission, he would cause that potion whereof I spoke to\r\nbe given to one of the youths in the garden, and then had him carried\r\ninto his Palace. So when the young man awoke, he found himself in the\r\nCastle, and no longer in that Paradise; whereat he was not over well\r\npleased. He was then conducted to the Old Man’s presence, and bowed\r\nbefore him with great veneration as believing himself to be in the\r\npresence of a true Prophet. The Prince would then ask whence he came,\r\nand he would reply that he came from Paradise! and that it was exactly\r\nsuch as Mahommet had described it in the Law. This of course gave the\r\nothers who stood by, and who had not been admitted, the greatest desire\r\nto enter therein.\r\n\r\nSo when the Old Man would have any Prince slain, he would say to such a\r\nyouth: “Go thou and slay So and So; and when thou returnest my Angels\r\nshall bear thee into Paradise. And shouldst thou die, natheless even so\r\nwill I send my Angels to carry thee back into Paradise.” So he caused\r\nthem to believe; and thus there was no order of his that they would\r\nnot affront any peril to execute, for the great desire they had to get\r\nback into that Paradise of his. And in this manner the Old One got his\r\npeople to murder any one whom he desired to get rid of. Thus, too,\r\nthe great dread that he inspired all Princes withal, made them become\r\nhis tributaries in order that he might abide at peace and amity with\r\nthem.{1}\r\n\r\nI should also tell you that the Old Man had certain others under him,\r\nwho copied his proceedings and acted exactly in the same manner. One\r\nof these was sent into the territory of Damascus, and the other into\r\nCurdistan.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Romantic as this story is, it seems to be precisely the\r\n  same that was current over all the East. It is given by Odoric at\r\n  length, more briefly by a Chinese author, and again from an Arabic\r\n  source by Hammer in the _Mines de l’Orient_.\r\n\r\n  The following is the Chinese account as rendered by Rémusat: “The\r\n  soldiers of this country (Mulahi) are veritable brigands. When\r\n  they see a lusty youth, they tempt him with the hope of gain, and\r\n  bring him to such a point that he will be ready to kill his father\r\n  or his elder brother with his own hand. After he is enlisted,\r\n  they intoxicate him, and carry him in that state into a secluded\r\n  retreat, where he is charmed with delicious music and beautiful\r\n  women. All his desires are satisfied for several days, and then\r\n  (in sleep) he is transported back to his original position. When\r\n  he awakes, they ask what he has seen. He is then informed that\r\n  if he will become an Assassin, he will be rewarded with the same\r\n  felicity. And with the texts and prayers that they teach him they\r\n  heat him to such a pitch that whatever commission be given him he\r\n  will brave death without regret in order to execute it.”\r\n\r\n  The Arabic narrative is too long to extract. It is from a kind\r\n  of historical romance called _The Memoirs of Hakim_, the date of\r\n  which Hammer unfortunately omits to give. Its close coincidence in\r\n  substance with Polo’s story is quite remarkable. After a detailed\r\n  description of the Paradise, and the transfer into it of the\r\n  aspirant under the influence of _bang_, on his awaking and seeing\r\n  his chief enter, he says, “O chief! am I awake or am I dreaming?”\r\n  To which the chief: “O such an One, take heed that thou tell not\r\n  the dream to any stranger. Know that Ali thy Lord hath vouchsafed\r\n  to show thee the place destined for thee in Paradise.... Hesitate\r\n  not a moment therefore in the service of the Imam who thus deigns\r\n  to intimate his contentment with thee,” and so on.\r\n\r\n  William de Nangis thus speaks of the Syrian Shaikh, who alone was\r\n  known to the Crusaders, though one of their historians (_Jacques\r\n  de Vitry_, in _Bongars_, I. 1062) shows knowledge that the\r\n  headquarters of the sect was in Persia: “He was much dreaded far\r\n  and near, by both Saracens and Christians, because he so often\r\n  caused princes of both classes indifferently to be murdered by his\r\n  emissaries. For he used to bring up in his palace youths belonging\r\n  to his territory, and had them taught a variety of languages, and\r\n  above all things to fear their Lord and obey him unto death, which\r\n  would thus become to them an entrance into the joys of Paradise.\r\n  And whosoever of them thus perished in carrying out his Lord’s\r\n  behests was worshipped as an angel.” As an instance of the implicit\r\n  obedience rendered by the _Fidáwí_ or devoted disciples of the\r\n  Shaikh, Fra Pipino and Marino Sanuto relate that when Henry Count\r\n  of Champagne (titular King of Jerusalem) was on a visit to the Old\r\n  Man of Syria, one day as they walked together they saw some lads\r\n  in white sitting on the top of a high tower. The Shaikh, turning\r\n  to the Count, asked if he had any subjects as obedient as his own?\r\n  and without giving time for reply made a sign to two of the boys,\r\n  who immediately leapt from the tower, and were killed on the spot.\r\n  The same story is told in the _Cento Novelle Antiche_, as happening\r\n  when the Emperor Frederic was on a visit (imaginary) to the Veglio.\r\n  And it is introduced likewise as an incident in the Romance of\r\n  Bauduin de Sebourc:\r\n\r\n      “Vollés veioir merveilles? dist li Rois Seignouris”\r\n\r\n  to Bauduin and his friends, and on their assenting he makes the\r\n  signal to one of his men on the battlements, and in a twinkling\r\n\r\n      “Quant le vinrent en l’air salant de tel avis,\r\n       Et aussi liément, et aussi esjois,\r\n       Qu’il deust conquester mil livres de parisis!\r\n       Ains qu’il venist a tière il fut mors et fenis,\r\n       Sur les roches agues desrompis corps et pis,”[1] etc.\r\n\r\n  (_Cathay_, 153; _Rémusat, Nouv.

Nizum-ul-Mulk, formerly the powerful minister of Malik\r\n  Shah, Seljukian sovereign of Persia, and a little later his two\r\n  sons. 1102. The Prince of Homs, in the chief Mosque of that city.\r\n  1113. Maudúd, Prince of Mosul, in the chief Mosque of Damascus.\r\n  About 1114. Abul Muzafar ’Ali, Wazir of Sanjár Shah, and Chakar\r\n  Beg, grand-uncle of the latter. 1116. Ahmed Yel, Prince of Maragha,\r\n  at Baghdad, in the presence of Mahomed, Sultan of Persia. 1121.\r\n  The Amir Afdhal, the powerful Wazir of Egypt, at Cairo. 1126.\r\n  Kasim Aksonkor, Prince of Mosul and Aleppo, in the Great Mosque at\r\n  Mosul. 1127. Moyin-uddin, Wazir of Sanjár Shah of Persia. 1129.\r\n  Amír Billah, Khalif of Egypt. 1131. Taj-ul Mulúk Buri, Prince of\r\n  Damascus. 1134. Shams-ul-Mulúk, son of the preceding. 1135–38.\r\n  The Khalif Mostarshid, the Khalif Rashíd, and Daùd, Seljukian\r\n  Prince of Azerbaijan. 1149. Raymond, Count of Tripoli. 1191. Kizil\r\n  Arzlan, Prince of Azerbaijan. 1192. Conrad of Montferrat, titular\r\n  King of Jerusalem; a murder which King Richard has been accused of\r\n  instigating. 1217. Oghulmish, Prince of Hamadán.\r\n\r\n  And in 1174 and 1176 attempts to murder the great Saladin. 1271.\r\n  Attempt to murder Ala’uddin Juwaini, Governor of Baghdad, and\r\n  historian of the Mongols. 1272. The attempt to murder Prince Edward\r\n  of England at Acre.\r\n\r\n  In latter years the _Fidáwí_ or Ismailite adepts appear to have\r\n  let out their services simply as hired assassins. Bibars, in a\r\n  letter to his court at Cairo, boasts of using them when needful. A\r\n  Mahomedan author ascribes to Bibars the instigation of the attempt\r\n  on Prince Edward. (_Makrizi_, II. 100; _J. As._ XI. 150.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Hammer mentions as what he chooses to call “Grand Priors”\r\n  under the Shaikh or “Grand Master” at Alamút, the chief, in Syria,\r\n  one in the Kuhistan of E. Persia (Tun-o-Kaïn), one in Kumis (the\r\n  country about Damghan and Bostam), and one in ’Irák; he does not\r\n  speak of any in Kurdistan. Colonel Monteith, however, says,\r\n  though without stating authority or particulars, “There were\r\n  several divisions of them (the Assassins) scattered throughout\r\n  Syria, _Kurdistan_ (near the Lake of Wan), and Asia Minor, but\r\n  all acknowledging as Imaum or High Priest the Chief residing at\r\n  Alamut.” And it may be noted that Odoric, a generation after Polo,\r\n  puts the Old Man at _Millescorte_, which looks like _Malasgird_,\r\n  north of Lake Van. (_H. des Assass._ p. 104; _J. R. G. S._ III. 16;\r\n  _Cathay_, p. ccxliii.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] This story has been transferred to Peter the Great, who is alleged\r\n    to have exhibited the docility of his subjects in the same way to\r\n    the King of Denmark, by ordering a Cossack to jump from the Round\r\n    Tower at Copenhagen, on the summit of which they were standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                   HOW THE OLD MAN CAME BY HIS END.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass, in the year of Christ’s Incarnation, 1252, that\r\nAlaü, Lord of the Tartars of the Levant, heard tell of these great\r\ncrimes of the Old Man, and resolved to make an end of him. So he took\r\nand sent one of his Barons with a great Army to that Castle, and they\r\nbesieged it for three years, but they could not take it, so strong was\r\nit. And indeed if they had had food within it never would have been\r\ntaken. But after being besieged those three years they ran short of\r\nvictual, and were taken. The Old Man was put to death with all his men\r\n[and the Castle with its Garden of Paradise was levelled with the\r\nground]. And since that time he has had no successor; and there was an\r\nend to all his villainies.{1}\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The date in Pauthier is 1242; in the G. T. and in Ramusio\r\n  1262. Neither is right, nor certainly could Polo have meant the\r\n  former.\r\n\r\n  When Mangku Kaan, after his enthronement (1251), determined at a\r\n  great _Kurultai_ or Diet, on perfecting the Mongol conquests, he\r\n  entrusted his brother Kúblái with the completion of the subjugation\r\n  of China and the adjacent countries, whilst his brother Hulaku\r\n  received the command of the army destined for Persia and Syria. The\r\n  complaints that came from the Mongol officers already in Persia\r\n  determined him to commence with the reduction of the Ismailites,\r\n  and Hulaku set out from Karakorum in February, 1254. He proceeded\r\n  with great deliberation, and the Oxus was not crossed till January,\r\n  1256. But an army had been sent long in advance under “one of\r\n  his Barons,” Kitubuka Noyan, and in 1253 it was already actively\r\n  engaged in besieging the Ismailite fortresses. In 1255, during the\r\n  progress of the war, ALA’UDDIN MAHOMED, the reigning Prince of\r\n  the Assassins (mentioned by Polo as Alaodin), was murdered at the\r\n  instigation of his son Ruknuddin Khurshah, who succeeded to the\r\n  authority. A year later (November, 1256) Ruknuddin surrendered to\r\n  Hulaku. [Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ II. p. 109) says that Alamút\r\n  was taken by Hulaku, 20th December, 1256.—H. C.] The fortresses\r\n  given up, all well furnished with provisions and artillery engines,\r\n  were 100 in number. Two of them, however, Lembeser and Girdkuh,\r\n  refused to surrender. The former fell after a year; the latter\r\n  is stated to have held out for _twenty years_—actually, as it\r\n  would seem, about fourteen, or till December, 1270. Ruknuddin was\r\n  well treated by Hulaku, and despatched to the Court of the Kaan.\r\n  The accounts of his death differ, but that most commonly alleged,\r\n  according to Rashiduddin, is that Mangku Kaan was irritated at\r\n  hearing of his approach, asking why his post-horses should be\r\n  fagged to no purpose, and sent executioners to put Ruknuddin\r\n  to death on the road. Alamút had been surrendered without any\r\n  substantial resistance. Some survivors of the sect got hold of\r\n  it again in 1275–1276, and held out for a time. The dominion was\r\n  extinguished, but the sect remained, though scattered indeed and\r\n  obscure. A very strange case that came before Sir Joseph Arnould\r\n  in the High Court at Bombay in 1866 threw much new light on the\r\n  survival of the Ismailis.\r\n\r\n  Some centuries ago a _Dai_ or Missionary of the Ismailis, named\r\n  Sadruddín, made converts from the Hindu trading classes in Upper\r\n  Sind. Under the name of _Khojas_ the sect multiplied considerably\r\n  in Sind, Kach’h, and Guzerat, whence they spread to Bombay and\r\n  to Zanzibar. Their numbers in Western India are now probably not\r\n  less than 50,000 to 60,000. Their doctrine, or at least the books\r\n  which they revere, appear to embrace a strange jumble of Hindu\r\n  notions with Mahomedan practices and Shiah mysticism, but the main\r\n  characteristic endures of deep reverence, if not worship, of the\r\n  person of their hereditary Imám. To his presence, when he resided\r\n  in Persia, numbers of pilgrims used to betake themselves, and large\r\n  remittances of what we may call _Ismail’s Pence_ were made to him.\r\n  Abul Hassan, the last Imám but one of admitted lineal descent from\r\n  the later Shaikhs of Alamút, and claiming (as they did) descent\r\n  from the Imám Ismail and his great ancestor ’Ali Abu Tálib, had\r\n  considerable estates at Meheláti, between Kúm and Hamadán, and at\r\n  one time held the Government of Kermán. His son and successor,\r\n  Shah Khalilullah, was killed in a brawl at Yezd in 1818. Fatteh\r\n  ’Ali Sháh, fearing Ismailite vengeance, caused the homicide to be\r\n  severely punished, and conferred gifts and honours on the young\r\n  Imám, Agha Khan, including the hand of one of his own daughters. In\r\n  1840 Agha Khan, who had raised a revolt at Kermán, had to escape\r\n  from Persia. He took refuge in Sind, and eventually rendered good\r\n  service both to General Nott at Kandahár and to Sir C. Napier in\r\n  Sind, for which he receives a pension from our Government.\r\n\r\n  For many years this genuine Heir and successor of the _Viex de la\r\n  Montaingne_ has had his headquarters at Bombay, where he devotes,\r\n  or for a long time did devote, the large income that he receives\r\n  from the faithful to the maintenance of a racing stable, being the\r\n  chief patron and promoter of the Bombay Turf!\r\n\r\n  A schism among the Khojas, owing apparently to the desire of part\r\n  of the well-to-do Bombay community to sever themselves from the\r\n  peculiarities of the sect and to set up as respectable Sunnis, led\r\n  in 1866 to an action in the High Court, the object of which was to\r\n  exclude Agha Khan from all rights over the Khojas, and to transfer\r\n  the property of the community to the charge of Orthodox Mahomedans.\r\n  To the elaborate addresses of Mr. Howard and Sir Joseph Arnould,\r\n  on this most singular process before an English Court, I owe the\r\n  preceding particulars. The judgment was entirely in favour of the\r\n  Old Man of the Mountain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: H. H. Agha Khán Meheláti, late Representative of the\r\n    Old Man of the Mountain.\r\n\r\n    “=Le Seigneur Viel, que je vous ai dit si tient sa court ... et\r\n    fait à croire à cele simple gent qui li est entour que il est un\r\n    grant prophete.=”]\r\n\r\n  [Sir Bartle Frere writes of Agha Khan in 1875: “Like his ancestor,\r\n  the Old One of Marco Polo’s time, he keeps his court in grand and\r\n  noble style. His sons, popularly known as ‘The Persian Princes,’\r\n  are active sportsmen, and age has not dulled the Agha’s enjoyment\r\n  of horse-racing. Some of the best blood of Arabia is always to be\r\n  found in his stables. He spares no expense on his racers, and no\r\n  prejudice of religion or race prevents his availing himself of\r\n  the science and skill of an English trainer or jockey when the\r\n  races come round. If tidings of war or threatened disturbance\r\n  should arise from Central Asia or Persia, the Agha is always one\r\n  of the first to hear of it, and seldom fails to pay a visit to the\r\n  Governor or to some old friend high in office to hear the news and\r\n  offer the services of a tried sword and an experienced leader to\r\n  the Government which has so long secured him a quiet refuge for\r\n  his old age.” Agha Khan died in April, 1881, at the age of 81. He\r\n  was succeeded by his son Agha Ali Sháh, one of the members of the\r\n  Legislative Council. (See _The Homeward Mail, Overland Times of\r\n  India_, of 14th April, 1881.)]\r\n\r\n  The _Bohras_ of Western India are identified with the\r\n  Imámí-Ismáilís in some books, and were so spoken of in the first\r\n  edition of this work. This is, however, an error, originally\r\n  due, it would seem, to Sir John Malcolm. The nature of their\r\n  doctrine, indeed, seems to be very much alike, and the Bohras,\r\n  like the Ismáilís, attach a divine character to their _Mullah_\r\n  or chief pontiff, and make a pilgrimage to his presence once in\r\n  life. But the _persons_ so reverenced are quite different; and the\r\n  Bohras recognise all the 12 Imáms of ordinary Shiahs. Their first\r\n  appearance in India was early, the date which they assign being\r\n  A.H. 532 (A.D. 1137–1138). Their chief seat was in Yemen, from\r\n  which a large emigration to India took place on its conquest by the\r\n  Turks in 1538. Ibn Batuta seems to have met with Bohras at Gandár,\r\n  near Baroch, in 1342. (_Voyages_, IV. 58.)\r\n\r\n  A Chinese account of the expedition of Hulaku will be found in\r\n  Rémusat’s _Nouveaux Mélanges_ (I.), and in Pauthier’s Introduction.\r\n  (_Q. R._ 115–219, esp. 213; _Ilch._ vol. i.; _J. A. S. B._ VI. 842\r\n  _seqq._) [A new and complete translation has been given by Dr. E.\r\n  Bretschneider, _Med. Res._ I. 112 _seqq._—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  There is some account of the rock of Alamút and its exceedingly\r\n  slender traces of occupancy, by Colonel Monteith, in _J. R. G.\r\n  S._ III. 15, and again by Sir Justin Sheil in vol. viii. p. 431.\r\n  There does not seem to be any specific authority for assigning the\r\n  Paradise of the Shaikh to Alamút; and it is at least worthy of note\r\n  that another of the castles of the Muláhidah, destroyed by Hulaku,\r\n  was called _Firdús_, _i.e._ Paradise. In any case, I see no reason\r\n  to suppose that Polo visited Alamút, which would have been quite\r\n  out of the road that he is following.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that “the Castle,” to which he alludes at the\r\n  beginning of next chapter, and which set him off upon this\r\n  digression, was _Girdkuh_.[1] It has not, as far as I know, been\r\n  identified by modern travellers, but it stood within 10 or 12\r\n  miles of Damghan (to the west or north-west). It is probably the\r\n  _Tigado_ of Hayton, of which he thus speaks: “The Assassins had\r\n  an impregnable castle called Tigado, which was furnished with all\r\n  necessaries, and was so strong that it had no fear of attack on any\r\n  side. Howbeit, Haloön commanded a certain captain of his that he\r\n  should take 10,000 Tartars who had been left in garrison in Persia,\r\n  and with them lay siege to the said castle, and not leave it till\r\n  he had taken it. Wherefore the said Tartars continued besieging\r\n  it for seven whole years, winter and summer, without being able\r\n  to take it. At last the Assassins surrendered, from sheer want of\r\n  clothing, but not of victuals or other necessaries.” So Ramusio;\r\n  other copies read “27 years.” In any case it corroborates the\r\n  fact that Girdkuh was said to have held out for an extraordinary\r\n  length of time. If Rashiduddin is right in naming 1270 as the date\r\n  of surrender, this would be quite a recent event when the Polo\r\n  party passed, and draw special attention to the spot. (_J. As._\r\n  sér. IV. tom. xiii. 48; _Ilch._ I. 93, 104, 274; _Q. R._ p. 278;\r\n  _Ritter_, VIII. 336.) A note which I have from _Djihan Numa_ (I.\r\n  259) connects Girdkuh with a district called _Chinar_. This may be\r\n  a clue to the term _Arbre Sec_; but there are difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] [Ghirdkuh means “round mountain”; it was in the district of Kumis,\r\n    three parasangs west of Damghan. Under the year 1257, the _Yüan\r\n    shi_ mentions the taking of the fortress of _Ghi-rh-du-kie_ by\r\n    _K’ie-di-bu-hua_. (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. p. 122; II.\r\n    110.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                   CONCERNING THE CITY OF SAPURGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Castle, you ride over fine plains and beautiful\r\nvalleys, and pretty hill-sides producing excellent grass pasture, and\r\nabundance of fruits, and all other products. Armies are glad to take\r\nup their quarters here on account of the plenty that exists. This kind\r\nof country extends for six days’ journey, with a goodly number of\r\ntowns and villages, in which the people are worshippers of Mahommet.\r\nSometimes also you meet with a tract of desert extending for 50 or 60\r\nmiles, or somewhat less, and in these deserts you find no water, but\r\nhave to carry it along with you. The beasts do without drink until you\r\nhave got across the desert tract and come to watering places.\r\n\r\nSo after travelling for six days as I have told you, you come to a city\r\ncalled SAPURGAN. It has great plenty of everything, but especially of\r\nthe very best melons in the world. They preserve them by paring them\r\nround and round into strips, and drying them in the sun. When dry\r\nthey are sweeter than honey, and are carried off for sale all over\r\nthe country. There is also abundance of game here, both of birds and\r\nbeasts.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—SAPURGAN may closely express the pronunciation of the\r\n  name of the city which the old Arabic writers call _Sabúrḳán_\r\n  and _Shabúrḳán_, now called _Shibrgán_, lying some 90 miles west\r\n  of Balkh; containing now some 12,000 inhabitants, and situated\r\n  in a plain still richly cultivated, though on the verge of the\r\n  desert.[1] But I have seen no satisfactory solution of the\r\n  difficulties as to the time assigned. This in the G. T. and in\r\n  Ramusio is clearly six days. The point of departure is indeed\r\n  uncertain, but even if we were to place that at Sharakhs on the\r\n  extreme verge of cultivated Khorasan, which would be quite\r\n  inconsistent with other data, it would have taken the travellers\r\n  something like double the time to reach Shibrgán. Where I have\r\n  followed the G. T. in its reading “_quant l’en a chevauchés six\r\n  jornée tel che je vos ai contés, adunc treuve l’en une cité_,”\r\n  etc., Pauthier’s text has “_Et quant l’en a chevauchié_ les vi\r\n  cités, _si treuve l’en une cité qui a nom Sapurgan_,” and to this\r\n  that editor adheres. But I suspect that _cités_ is a mere lapsus\r\n  for _journées_, as in the reading in one of his three MSS. What\r\n  could be meant by “_chevauchier les_ vi _cités_”?\r\n\r\n  Whether the true route be, as I suppose, by Nishapúr and Meshid,\r\n  or, as Khanikoff supposes, by Herat and Badghis, it is strange\r\n  that no one of those famous cities is mentioned. And we feel\r\n  constrained to assume that something has been misunderstood in\r\n  the dictation, or has dropt out of it. As a _probable_ conjecture\r\n  I should apply the six days to the extent of pleasing country\r\n  described in the first lines of the chapter, and identify it with\r\n  the tract between Sabzawur and the cessation of fertile country\r\n  beyond Meshid. The distance would agree well, and a comparison\r\n  with Fraser or Ferrier will show that even now the description,\r\n  allowing for the compression of an old recollection, would be well\r\n  founded; _e.g._ on the first march beyond Nishapúr: “Fine villages,\r\n  with plentiful gardens full of trees, that bear fruit of the\r\n  highest flavour, may be seen all along the foot of the hills, and\r\n  in the little recesses formed by the ravines whence issues the\r\n  water that irrigates them. It was a rich and pleasing scene, and\r\n  out of question by far the most populous and cultivated tract that\r\n  I had seen in Persia.... Next morning we quitted Derrood ... by a\r\n  very indifferent but interesting road, the glen being finely wooded\r\n  with walnut, mulberry, poplar, and willow-trees, and fruit-tree\r\n  gardens rising one above the other upon the mountain-side, watered\r\n  by little rills.... These gardens extended for several miles up the\r\n  glen; beyond them the bank of the stream continued to be fringed\r\n  with white sycamore, willow, ash, mulberry, poplar, and woods that\r\n  love a moist situation,” and so on, describing a style of scenery\r\n  not common in Persia, and expressing diffusely (as it seems to me)\r\n  the same picture as Polo’s two lines. In the valley of Nishapúr,\r\n  again (we quote Arthur Conolly): “‘This is Persia!’ was the vain\r\n  exclamation of those who were alive to the beauty of the scene;\r\n  ‘this is Persia!’ _Bah! Bah!_ What grass, what grain, what water!\r\n  _Bah! Bah!_\r\n\r\n      [‘If there be a Paradise on the face of the Earth,\r\n        This is it! This is it! This is it!’]”—(I. 209.)\r\n\r\n  (See _Fraser_, 405, 432–433, 434, 436.)\r\n\r\n  With reference to the dried melons of Shibrgán, Quatremère cites\r\n  a history of Herat, which speaks of them almost in Polo’s words.\r\n  Ibn Batuta gives a like account of the melons of Khárizm: “The\r\n  surprising thing about these melons is the way the people have of\r\n  slicing them, drying them in the sun, and then packing them in\r\n  baskets, just as Malaga figs are treated in our part of the world.\r\n  In this state they are sent to the remotest parts of India and\r\n  China. There is no dried fruit so delicious, and all the while\r\n  I lived at Delhi, when the travelling dealers came in, I never\r\n  missed sending for these dried strips of melon.” (_Q. R._ 169;\r\n  _I. B._ III. 15.) Here, in the 14th century, we seem to recognise\r\n  the Afghan dealers arriving in the cities of Hindustan with their\r\n  annual camel-loads of dried fruits, just as we have seen them in\r\n  our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] The oldest form of the name is _Asapuragán_, which Rawlinson thinks\r\n    traceable to its being an ancient seat of the _Asa_ or _Asagartii_.\r\n    (_J. R. A. S._ XI. 63.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n                         OF THE CITY OF BALC.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalc is a noble city and a great, though it was much greater in former\r\ndays. But the Tartars and other nations have greatly ravaged and\r\ndestroyed it. There were formerly many fine palaces and buildings of\r\nmarble, and the ruins of them still remain. The people of the city tell\r\nthat it was here that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius.\r\n\r\nHere, you should be told, is the end of the empire of the Tartar\r\nLord of the Levant. And this city is also the limit of Persia in the\r\ndirection between east and north-east.{1}\r\n\r\nNow, let us quit this city, and I will tell you of another country\r\ncalled DOGANA.{2}\r\n\r\nWhen you have quitted the city of which I have been speaking, you ride\r\nsome 12 days between north-east and east, without finding any human\r\nhabitation, for the people have all taken refuge in fastnesses among\r\nthe mountains, on account of the Banditti and armies that harassed\r\nthem. There is plenty of water on the road, and abundance of game;\r\nthere are lions too. You can get no provisions on the road, and must\r\ncarry with you all that you require for these 12 days.{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—BALKH, “the mother of cities,” suffered mercilessly from\r\n  Chinghiz. Though the city had yielded without resistance, the whole\r\n  population was marched by companies into the plain, on the usual\r\n  Mongol pretext of counting them, and then brutally massacred. The\r\n  city and its gardens were fired, and all buildings capable of\r\n  defence were levelled. The province long continued to be harried\r\n  by the Chaghataian inroads. Ibn Batuta, sixty years after Marco’s\r\n  visit, describes the city as still in ruins, and as uninhabited:\r\n  “The remains of its mosques and colleges,” he says, “are still\r\n  to be seen, and the painted walls traced with azure.” It is no\r\n  doubt the Vaeq (_Valq_) of Clavijo, “very large, and surrounded by\r\n  a broad earthen wall, thirty paces across, but breached in many\r\n  parts.” He describes a large portion of the area within as sown\r\n  with cotton. The account of its modern state in Burnes and Ferrier\r\n  is much the same as Ibn Batuta’s, except that they found some\r\n  population; two separate towns within the walls according to the\r\n  latter. Burnes estimates the circuit of the ruins at 20 miles. The\r\n  bulk of the population has been moved since 1858 to Takhtapul, 8\r\n  miles east of Balkh, where the Afghan Government is placed.\r\n\r\n  (_Erdmann_, 404–405; _I. B._ III. 59; _Clavijo_, p. 117; _Burnes_,\r\n  II. 204–206; _Ferrier_, 206–207.)\r\n\r\n  According to the legendary history of Alexander, the beautiful\r\n  Roxana was the daughter of Darius, and her father in a dying\r\n  interview with Alexander requested the latter to make her his wife:—\r\n\r\n      “Une fille ai mult bele; se prendre le voles.\r\n       Vus en seres de l’mont tout li mius maries,” etc.\r\n                               (_Lambert Le Court_, p. 256.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The country called _Dogana_ in the G. Text is a puzzle. In\r\n  the former edition I suggested _Juzgána_, a name which till our\r\n  author’s time was applied to a part of the adjoining territory,\r\n  though not to that traversed in quitting Balkh for the east. Sir H.\r\n  Rawlinson is inclined to refer the name to _Dehgán_, or “villager,”\r\n  a term applied in Bactria, and in Kabul, to Tajik peasantry[1]. I\r\n  may also refer to certain passages in Baber’s “Memoirs,” in which\r\n  he speaks of a place, and apparently a district, called _Dehánah_,\r\n  which seems from the context to have lain in the vicinity of the\r\n  Ghori, or Aksarai River. There is still a village in the Ghori\r\n  territory, called _Dehánah_. Though this is worth mentioning, where\r\n  the true solution is so uncertain, I acknowledge the difficulty of\r\n  applying it. I may add also that Baber calls the River of Ghori\r\n  or Aksarai, the _Dogh_-ábah. (_Sprenger, P. und R. Routen_, p. 39\r\n  and Map; _Anderson_ in _J. A. S. B._ XXII. 161; _Ilch._ II. 93;\r\n  _Baber_, pp. 132, 134, 168, 200, also 146.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Though Burnes speaks of the part of the road that we\r\n  suppose necessarily to have been here followed from Balkh towards\r\n  Taican, as barren and dreary, he adds that the ruins of _aqueducts_\r\n  and houses proved that the land had at one time been peopled,\r\n  though now destitute of water, and consequently of inhabitants. The\r\n  country would seem to have reverted at the time of Burnes’ journey,\r\n  from like causes, nearly to the state in which Marco found it after\r\n  the Mongol devastations.\r\n\r\n  _Lions_ seem to mean here the real king of beasts, and not tigers,\r\n  as hereafter in the book. Tigers, though found on the S. and W.\r\n  shores of the Caspian, do not seem to exist in the Oxus valley.\r\n  On the other hand, Rashiduddin tells us that, when Hulaku was\r\n  reviewing his army after the passage of the river, several lions\r\n  were started, and two were killed. The lions are also mentioned by\r\n  Sidi ’Ali, the Turkish Admiral, further down the valley towards\r\n  Hazárasp: “We were obliged to fight with the lions day and night,\r\n  and no man dared to go alone for water.” Moorcroft says of the\r\n  plain between Kunduz and the Oxus: “Deer, foxes, wolves, hogs, and\r\n  _lions_ are numerous, the latter resembling those in the vicinity\r\n  of Hariana” (in Upper India). Wood also mentions lions in Kuláb,\r\n  and at Kila’chap on the Oxus. Q. Curtius tells how Alexander killed\r\n  a great lion in the country north of the Oxus towards Samarkand. [A\r\n  similar story is told of Timur in _The Mulfuzat Timūry_, translated\r\n  by Major Charles Stewart, 1830 (p. 69): “During the march ‘(near\r\n  Balkh)’ two lions made their appearance, one of them a male, the\r\n  other a female. I (Timur) resolved to kill them myself, and having\r\n  shot them both with arrows, I considered this circumstance as a\r\n  lucky omen.”—H. C.] (_Burnes_, II. 200; _Q.

ALSO OF THE\r\n                          PROVINCE OF CASEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter those twelve days’ journey you come to a fortified place called\r\nTAICAN, where there is a great corn market.{1} It is a fine place, and\r\nthe mountains that you see towards the south are all composed of salt.\r\nPeople from all the countries round, to some thirty days’ journey, come\r\nto fetch this salt, which is the best in the world, and is so hard that\r\nit can only be broken with iron picks. ’Tis in such abundance that it\r\nwould supply the whole world to the end of time. [Other mountains there\r\ngrow almonds and pistachioes, which are exceedingly cheap.]{2}\r\n\r\nWhen you leave this town and ride three days further between north-east\r\nand east, you meet with many fine tracts full of vines and other\r\nfruits, and with a goodly number of habitations, and everything to be\r\nhad very cheap. The people are worshippers of Mahommet, and are an evil\r\nand a murderous generation, whose great delight is in the wine shop;\r\nfor they have good wine (albeit it be boiled), and are great topers; in\r\ntruth, they are constantly getting drunk. They wear nothing on the head\r\nbut a cord some ten palms long twisted round it. They are excellent\r\nhuntsmen, and take a great deal of game; in fact they wear nothing but\r\nthe skins of the beasts they have taken in the chase, for they make of\r\nthem both coats and shoes. Indeed, all of them are acquainted with the\r\nart of dressing skins for these purposes.{3}\r\n\r\nWhen you have ridden those three days, you find a town called CASEM,{4}\r\nwhich is subject to a count. His other towns and villages are on the\r\nhills, but through this town there flows a river of some size. There\r\nare a great many porcupines hereabouts, and very large ones too. When\r\nhunted with dogs, several of them will get together and huddle close,\r\nshooting their quills at the dogs, which get many a serious wound\r\nthereby.{5}\r\n\r\nThis town of Casem is at the head of a very great province, which is\r\nalso called Casem. The people have a peculiar language. The peasants\r\nwho keep cattle abide in the mountains, and have their dwellings in\r\ncaves, which form fine and spacious houses for them, and are made with\r\nease, as the hills are composed of earth.{6}\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the town of Casem, you ride for three days without\r\nfinding a single habitation, or anything to eat or drink, so that you\r\nhave to carry with you everything that you require. At the end of those\r\nthree days you reach a province called Badashan, about which we shall\r\nnow tell you.{7}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The _Taican_ of Polo is the still existing TALIKAN in\r\n  the province of Kataghan or Kunduz, but it bears the former name\r\n  (_Tháîḳán_) in the old Arab geographies. Both names are used by\r\n  Baber, who says it lay in the _Ulugh Bágh_, or Great Garden, a\r\n  name perhaps acquired by the Plains of Talikan in happier days,\r\n  but illustrating what Polo says of the next three days’ march.\r\n  The Castle of Talikan resisted Chinghiz for seven months, and met\r\n  with the usual fate (1221). [In the Travels of Sidi Ali, son of\r\n  Housaïn (_Jour. Asiat._, October, 1826, p. 203), “Talikan, in the\r\n  country of Badakhschan” is mentioned.—H. C.] Wood speaks of Talikan\r\n  in 1838 as a poor place of some 300 or 400 houses, mere hovels; a\r\n  recent account gives it 500 families. Market days are not usual\r\n  in Upper India or Kabul, but are universal in Badakhshan and the\r\n  Oxus provinces. The bazaars are only open on those days, and the\r\n  people from the surrounding country then assemble to exchange\r\n  goods, generally by barter. Wood chances to note: “A market was\r\n  held at Talikan.... The thronged state of the roads leading into\r\n  it soon apprised us that the day was no ordinary one.” (_Abulf._\r\n  in _Büsching_, V. 352; _Sprenger_, p. 50; _P. de la Croix_, I. 63;\r\n  _Baber_, 38, 130; _Burnes_, III. 8; _Wood_, 156; _Pandit Manphul’s\r\n  Report_.)\r\n\r\n  The distance of Talikan from Balkh is about 170 miles, which gives\r\n  very short marches, if twelve days be the correct reading. Ramusio\r\n  has _two_ days, which is certainly wrong. XII. is easily miswritten\r\n  for VII., which would be a just number.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—In our day, as I learn from Pandit Manphul, the mines of\r\n  rock salt are at Ak Bulák, near the Lataband Pass, and at Darúná,\r\n  near the Kokcha, and these supply the whole of Badakhshan, as well\r\n  as Kunduz and Chitrál. These sites are due _east_ of Talikan, and\r\n  are in Badakhshan. But there is a mine at _Chál_, S.E. or S.S.E.\r\n  of Talikan and within the same province. There are also mines\r\n  of rock-salt near the famous “stone bridge” in Kuláb, north of\r\n  the Oxus, and again on the south of the Alaï steppe. (Papers by\r\n  _Manphul_ and by _Faiz Baksh_; also _Notes_ by _Feachenko_.)\r\n\r\n  Both pistachioes and wild almonds are mentioned by Pandit Manphul;\r\n  and see _Wood_ (p. 252) on the beauty and profusion of the latter.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Wood thinks that the Tajik inhabitants of Badakhshan and\r\n  the adjoining districts are substantially of the same race as the\r\n  Kafir tribes of Hindu Kúsh. At the time of Polo’s visit it would\r\n  seem that their conversion to Islam was imperfect. They were\r\n  probably in that transition state which obtains in our own day\r\n  for some of the Hill Mahomedans adjoining the Kafirs on the south\r\n  side of the mountains the reproachful title of _Nímchah Musulmán_,\r\n  or Half-and-halfs. Thus they would seem to have retained sundry\r\n  Kafir characteristics; among others that love of wine which is so\r\n  strong among the Kafirs. The boiling of the wine is noted by Baber\r\n  (a connoisseur) as the custom of Nijrao, adjoining, if not then\r\n  included in, Kafir-land; and Elphinstone implies the continuance\r\n  of the custom when he speaks of the Kafirs as having wine of _the\r\n  consistence of jelly_, and very strong. The wine of _Kápishí_, the\r\n  Greek Kapisa, immediately south of Hindu Kúsh, was famous as early\r\n  as the time of the Hindu grammarian Pánini, say three centuries\r\n  B.C. The cord twisted round the head was probably also a relic of\r\n  Kafir costume: “Few of the Kafirs cover the head, and when they do,\r\n  it is with a narrow band or fillet of goat’s hair ... about a yard\r\n  or a yard and a half in length, wound round the head.” This style\r\n  of head-dress seems to be very ancient in India, and in the Sanchi\r\n  sculptures is that of the supposed Dasyas. Something very similar,\r\n  _i.e._ a scanty turban cloth twisted into a mere cord, and wound\r\n  two or three times round the head, is often seen in the Panjab to\r\n  this day.\r\n\r\n  The _Postín_ or sheepskin coat is almost universal on both sides\r\n  of the Hindu Kúsh; and Wood notes: “The shoes in use resemble\r\n  half-boots, made of goatskin, and mostly of home manufacture.”\r\n  (_Baber_, 145; _J. A. S. B._ XXVIII. 348, 364; _Elphinst._ II. 384;\r\n  _Ind. Antiquary_, I. 22; _Wood_, 174, 220; _J. R. A. S._ XIX. 2.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Marsden was right in identifying _Scassem_ or _Casem_ with\r\n  the _Kechem_ of D’Anville’s Map, but wrong in confounding the\r\n  latter with the _Kishmabad_ of Elphinstone—properly, I believe,\r\n  _Kishnabad_—in the Anderab Valley. Kashm, or Keshm, found its way\r\n  into maps through Pétis de la Croix, from whom probably D’Anville\r\n  adopted it; but as it was ignored by Elphinstone (or by Macartney,\r\n  who constructed his map), and by Burnes, it dropped out of our\r\n  geography. Indeed, Wood does not notice it except as giving name\r\n  to a high hill called the Hill of Kishm, and the position even\r\n  of that he omits to indicate. The frequent mention of Kishm in\r\n  the histories of Timur and Humayun (_e.g._ _P. de la Croix_, I.\r\n  167; _N. et E._ XIV. 223, 491; _Erskine’s Baber and Humayun_, II.\r\n  330, 355, etc.) had enabled me to determine its position within\r\n  tolerably narrow limits; but desiring to fix it definitely,\r\n  application was made through Colonel Maclagan to Pandit Manphul,\r\n  C.S.I., a very intelligent Hindu gentleman, who resided for some\r\n  time in Badakhshan as agent of the Panjab Government, and from him\r\n  arrived a special note and sketch, and afterwards a MS. copy of a\r\n  Report,[1] which set the position of Kishm at rest.\r\n\r\n  KISHM is the _Kilissemo_, _i.e._ Karisma or Krishma, of Hiuen Tsang;\r\n  and Sir H. Rawlinson has identified the Hill of Kishm with the\r\n  Mount Kharesem of the Zend-Avesta, on which Jamshid placed the\r\n  most sacred of all the fires. It is now a small town or large\r\n  village on the right bank of the Varsach river, a tributary of the\r\n  Kokcha. It was in 1866 the seat of a district ruler under the Mír\r\n  of Badakhshan, who was styled the Mír of Kishm, and is the modern\r\n  counterpart of Marco’s _Quens_ or Count. The modern caravan-road\r\n  between Kunduz and Badakhshan does not pass through Kishm, which is\r\n  left some five miles to the right, but through the town of Mashhad,\r\n  which stands on the same river. Kishm is the warmest district of\r\n  Badakhshan. Its fruits are abundant, and ripen a month earlier\r\n  than those at Faizabad, the capital of that country. The Varsach or\r\n  Mashhad river is Marco’s “_Flum auques grant_.” Wood (247) calls it\r\n  “the largest stream we had yet forded in Badakhshan.”\r\n\r\n  It is very notable that in Ramusio, in Pipino, and in one passage\r\n  of the G. Text, the name is written _Scasem_, which has led some\r\n  to suppose the _Ish-Káshm_ of Wood to be meant. That place is much\r\n  too far east—in fact, beyond the city which forms the subject of\r\n  the next chapter. The apparent hesitation, however, between the\r\n  forms _Casem_ and _Scasem_ suggests that the Kishm of our note may\r\n  formerly have been termed S’kăshm or Ish-Kăshm, a form frequent\r\n  in the Oxus Valley, _e.g._ _Ish-Kimish, Ish-Káshm, Ishtrakh,\r\n  Ishpingao_. General Cunningham judiciously suggests (_Ladak_,\r\n  34) that this form is merely a vocal corruption of the initial\r\n  _S_ before a consonant, a combination which always troubles the\r\n  Musulman in India, and converts every Mr. Smith or Mr. Sparks into\r\n  Ismit or Ispak Sahib.\r\n\r\n  [There does not seem to me any difficulty about this note:\r\n  “Shibarkhan (Afghan Turkistan), Balkh, Kunduz, Khanabad, Talikan,\r\n  Kishm, Badakhshan.” I am tempted to look for Dogana at\r\n  Khanabad.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The belief that the porcupine _projected_ its quills at\r\n  its assailants was an ancient and persistent one—“_cum intendit\r\n  cutem missiles_,” says Pliny (VIII. 35, and see also _Aelian. de\r\n  Nat. An._ I. 31), and is held by the Chinese as it was held by the\r\n  ancients, but is universally rejected by modern zoologists. The\r\n  huddling and coiling appears to be a true characteristic, for the\r\n  porcupine always tries to shield its head.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The description of Kishm as a “very great” province is\r\n  an example of a bad habit of Marco’s, which recurs in the next\r\n  chapter. What he says of the cave-dwellings may be illustrated by\r\n  Burnes’s account of the excavations at Bamian, in a neighbouring\r\n  district. These “still form the residence of the greater part of\r\n  the population.... The hills at Bamian are formed of indurated\r\n  clay and pebbles, which renders this excavation a matter of little\r\n  difficulty.” Similar occupied excavations are noticed by Moorcroft\r\n  at Heibak and other places towards Khulm.\r\n\r\n  Curiously, Pandit Manphul says of the districts about the Kokcha:\r\n  “Both their hills and plains are productive, the former _being\r\n  mostly composed of earth, having very little of rocky substance_.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—The capital of Badakhshan is now Faizabad, on the right\r\n  bank of the Kokcha, founded, according to Manphul, by Yarbeg, the\r\n  first Mír of the present dynasty. When this family was displaced\r\n  for a time, by Murad Beg of Kunduz, about 1829, the place was\r\n  abandoned for years, but is now re-occupied. The ancient capital\r\n  of Badakhshan stood in the Dasht (or Plain) of Bahárak, one of\r\n  the most extensive pieces of level in Badakhshan, in which the\r\n  rivers Vardoj, Zardeo, and Sarghalan unite with the Kokcha, and\r\n  was apparently termed _Jaúzgún_. This was probably the city called\r\n  Badakhshan by our traveller.[2] As far as I can estimate, by the\r\n  help of Wood and the map I have compiled, this will be from 100 to\r\n  110 miles distant from Talikan, and will therefore suit fairly with\r\n  the six marches that Marco lays down.\r\n\r\n  Wood, in 1838, found the whole country between Talikan and Faizabad\r\n  nearly as depopulated as Marco found that between Kishm and\r\n  Badakhshan. The modern depopulation was due—in part, at least—to\r\n  the recent oppressions and _razzias_ of the Uzbeks of Kunduz. On\r\n  their decline, between 1840 and 1850, the family of the native\r\n  Mírs was reinstated, and these now rule at Faizabad, under an\r\n  acknowledgment, since 1859, of Afghan supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Since published in _J. K. G. S._ vol. xlii.\r\n\r\n[2] Wilford, in the end of the 18th century, speaks of Faizabad as\r\n    “the new capital of Badakhshan, built near the site of the old\r\n    one.” The Chinese map (_vide_ _J. R. G. S._ vol. xlii.) represents\r\n    the city of _Badakhshan_ to the east of Faizabad. Faiz Bakhsh, in\r\n    an unpublished paper, mentions a tradition that the Lady Zobeidah,\r\n    dear to English children, the daughter of Al-Mansúr and wife of\r\n    Ar-Rashid, delighted to pass the spring at Jaúzgún, and built a\r\n    palace there, “the ruins of which are still visible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n                     OF THE PROVINCE OF BADASHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBadashan is a Province inhabited by people who worship Mahommet, and\r\nhave a peculiar language. It forms a very great kingdom, and the\r\nroyalty is hereditary. All those of the royal blood are descended\r\nfrom King Alexander and the daughter of King Darius, who was Lord of\r\nthe vast Empire of Persia. And all these kings call themselves in the\r\nSaracen tongue ZULCARNIAIN, which is as much as to say _Alexander_; and\r\nthis out of regard for Alexander the Great.{1}\r\n\r\nIt is in this province that those fine and valuable gems the Balas\r\nRubies are found. They are got in certain rocks among the mountains,\r\nand in the search for them the people dig great caves underground, just\r\nas is done by miners for silver. There is but one special mountain that\r\nproduces them, and it is called SYGHINAN. The stones are dug on the\r\nking’s account, and no one else dares dig in that mountain on pain of\r\nforfeiture of life as well as goods; nor may any one carry the stones\r\nout of the kingdom. But the king amasses them all, and sends them to\r\nother kings when he has tribute to render, or when he desires to offer\r\na friendly present; and such only as he pleases he causes to be sold.\r\nThus he acts in order to keep the Balas at a high value; for if he were\r\nto allow everybody to dig, they would extract so many that the world\r\nwould be glutted with them, and they would cease to bear any value.\r\nHence it is that he allows so few to be taken out, and is so strict in\r\nthe matter.{2}\r\n\r\nThere is also in the same country another mountain, in which azure\r\nis found; ’tis the finest in the world, and is got in a vein like\r\nsilver. There are also other mountains which contain a great amount\r\nof silver ore, so that the country is a very rich one; but it is also\r\n(it must be said) a very cold one.{3} It produces numbers of excellent\r\nhorses, remarkable for their speed. They are not shod at all, although\r\nconstantly used in mountainous country, and on very bad roads. [They go\r\nat a great pace even down steep descents, where other horses neither\r\nwould nor could do the like. And Messer Marco was told that not long\r\nago they possessed in that province a breed of horses from the strain\r\nof Alexander’s horse Bucephalus, all of which had from their birth a\r\nparticular mark on the forehead. This breed was entirely in the hands\r\nof an uncle of the king’s; and in consequence of his refusing to let\r\nthe king have any of them, the latter put him to death. The widow then,\r\nin despite, destroyed the whole breed, and it is now extinct.{4}]\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this country also supply Saker falcons of excellent\r\nflight, and plenty of Lanners likewise. Beasts and birds for the chase\r\nthere are in great abundance. Good wheat is grown, and also barley\r\nwithout husk. They have no olive oil, but make oil from sesamé, and\r\nalso from walnuts.{5}\r\n\r\n[In the mountains there are vast numbers of sheep—400, 500, or 600 in a\r\nsingle flock, and all of them wild; and though many of them are taken,\r\nthey never seem to get aught the scarcer.{6}\r\n\r\nThose mountains are so lofty that ’tis a hard day’s work, from morning\r\ntill evening, to get to the top of them. On getting up, you find an\r\nextensive plain, with great abundance of grass and trees, and copious\r\nsprings of pure water running down through rocks and ravines. In those\r\nbrooks are found trout and many other fish of dainty kinds; and the\r\nair in those regions is so pure, and residence there so healthful,\r\nthat when the men who dwell below in the towns, and in the valleys\r\nand plains, find themselves attacked by any kind of fever or other\r\nailment that may hap, they lose no time in going to the hills; and\r\nafter abiding there two or three days, they quite recover their health\r\nthrough the excellence of that air. And Messer Marco said he had proved\r\nthis by experience: for when in those parts he had been ill for about a\r\nyear, but as soon as he was advised to visit that mountain, he did so\r\nand got well at once.{7}]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Silver Patera of debased Greek art, formerly in\r\n  the possession of the Princes of Badakhshan, now in the India Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn this kingdom there are many strait and perilous passes, so difficult\r\nto force that the people have no fear of invasion. Their towns and\r\nvillages also are on lofty hills, and in very strong positions.{8}\r\nThey are excellent archers, and much given to the chase; indeed, most\r\nof them are dependent for clothing on the skins of beasts, for stuffs\r\nare very dear among them. The great ladies, however, are arrayed in\r\nstuffs, and I will tell you the style of their dress! They all wear\r\ndrawers made of cotton cloth, and into the making of these some will\r\nput 60, 80, or even 100 ells of stuff. This they do to make themselves\r\nlook large in the hips, for the men of those parts think that to be a\r\ngreat beauty in a woman.{9}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“The population of Badakhshan Proper is composed of Tajiks,\r\n  Turks, and Arabs, who are all Sunnis, following the orthodox\r\n  doctrines of the Mahomedan law, and speak Persian and Turki, whilst\r\n  the people of the more mountainous tracts are Tajiks of the Shiá\r\n  creed, having separate provincial dialects or languages of their\r\n  own, the inhabitants of the principal places combining therewith\r\n  a knowledge of Persian. Thus, the _Shighnáni_ [sometimes called\r\n  _Shighni_] is spoken in Shignán and Roshán, the _Ishkáshami_ in\r\n  Ishkásham, the _Wakhi_ in Wakhán, the _Sanglichì_ in Sanglich and\r\n  Zebák, and the _Minjáni_ in Minján. All these dialects materially\r\n  differ from each other.” (_Pand. Manphul._) It may be considered\r\n  almost certain that Badakhshan Proper also had a peculiar dialect\r\n  in Polo’s time. Mr. Shaw speaks of the strong resemblance to\r\n  _Kashmírís_ of the Badakhshán people whom he had seen.\r\n\r\n  The Legend of the Alexandrian pedigree of the Kings of Badakhshan\r\n  is spoken of by Baber, and by earlier Eastern authors. This\r\n  pedigree is, or was, claimed also by the chiefs of Karátegín,\r\n  Darwáz, Roshán, Shighnán, Wakhán, Chitrál, Gilgít, Swát, and\r\n  Khapolor in Bálti. Some samples of those genealogies may be seen in\r\n  that strange document called “Gardiner’s Travels.”\r\n\r\n  In Badakhshan Proper the story seems now to have died out. Indeed,\r\n  though Wood mentions one of the modern family of Mírs as vaunting\r\n  this descent, these are in fact _Sáhibzádahs_ of Samarkand, who\r\n  were invited to the country about the middle of the 17th century,\r\n  and were in no way connected with the old kings.\r\n\r\n  The traditional claims to Alexandrian descent were probably due to\r\n  a genuine memory of the Græco-Bactrian kingdom, and might have had\r\n  an origin analogous to the Sultan’s claim to be “Caesar of Rome”;\r\n  for the real ancestry of the oldest dynasties on the Oxus was to\r\n  be sought rather among the Tochari and Ephthalites than among the\r\n  Greeks whom they superseded.\r\n\r\n  The cut on p. 159 presents an interesting memorial of the real\r\n  relation of Bactria to Greece, as well as of the pretence of the\r\n  Badakhshan princes to Grecian descent. This silver patera was sold\r\n  by the family of the Mírs, when captives, to the Minister of the\r\n  Uzbek chief of Kunduz, and by him to Dr. Percival Lord in 1838. It\r\n  is now in the India Museum. On the bottom is punched a word or two\r\n  in Pehlvi, and there is also a word incised in Syriac or Uighúr.\r\n  It is curious that a _pair_ of paterae were acquired by Dr. Lord\r\n  under the circumstances stated. The other, similar in material and\r\n  form, but apparently somewhat larger, is distinctly Sassanian,\r\n  representing a king spearing a lion.\r\n\r\n  _Zu-’lḳarnain_, “the Two-Horned,” is an Arabic epithet of\r\n  Alexander, with which legends have been connected, but which\r\n  probably arose from the horned portraits on his coins. [Capus,\r\n  _l.c._ p. 121, says, “Iskandr Zoulcarneïn or Alexander _le Cornu_,\r\n  horns being the emblem of strength.”—H. C.] The term appears in\r\n  Chaucer (_Troil. and Cress._ III. 931) in the sense of _non plus_:—\r\n\r\n      “I am, till God me better minde send,\r\n       At _dulcarnon_, right at my wittes end.”\r\n\r\n  And it is said to have still colloquial existence in that sense in\r\n  some corners of England. This use is said to have arisen from the\r\n  Arabic application of the term (_Bicorne_) to the 47th Proposition\r\n  of Euclid. (_Baber_, 13; _N. et E._ XIV. 490; _N. An. des V._ xxvi.\r\n  296; _Burnes_, III. 186 _seqq._; _Wood_, 155, 244; _J. A. S. B._\r\n  XXII. 300; _Ayeen Akbery_, II. 185; see _N. and Q._ 1st Series,\r\n  vol. v.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—I have adopted in the text for the name of the country that\r\n  one of the several forms in the G. Text which comes nearest to the\r\n  correct name, viz. _Badascian_. But _Balacian_ also appears both in\r\n  that and in Pauthier’s text. This represents _Balakhshán_, a form\r\n  also sometimes used in the East. Hayton has _Balaxcen_, Clavijo\r\n  _Balaxia_, the Catalan Map _Baldassia_. From the form _Balakhsh_\r\n  the Balas Ruby got its name. As Ibn Batuta says: “The Mountains of\r\n  Badakhshan have given their name to the Badakhshi Ruby, vulgarly\r\n  called _Al Balaksh_.” Albertus Magnus says the _Balagius_ is the\r\n  female of the Carbuncle or Ruby Proper, “and some say it is his\r\n  house, and hath thereby got the name, quasi _Palatium_ Carbunculi!”\r\n  The Balais or Balas Ruby is, like the Spinel, a kind inferior to\r\n  the real Ruby of Ava. The author of the _Masálak al Absár_ says the\r\n  finest Balas ever seen in the Arab countries was one presented to\r\n  Malek ’Adil Ketboga, at Damascus; it was of a triangular form and\r\n  weighed 50 drachms. The prices of _Balasci_ in Europe in that age\r\n  may be found in Pegolotti, but the needful problems are hard to\r\n  solve.\r\n\r\n      “No sapphire in Inde, no Rubie rich of price,\r\n       There lacked than, nor Emeraud so grene,\r\n       _Balès_, Turkès, ne thing to my device.”\r\n                              (_Chaucer, ‘Court of Love.’_)\r\n\r\n      “L’altra letizia, che m’era già nota,\r\n       Preclara cosa mi si fece in vista,\r\n       Qual fin _balascio_ in che lo Sol percuoto.”\r\n                              (_Paradiso_, ix. 67.)\r\n\r\n  Some account of the Balakhsh from Oriental sources will be found in\r\n  _J. As._ sér V. tom. xi. 109.\r\n\r\n  (_I. B._ III. 59, 394; _Alb. Mag. de Mineralibus; Pegol._ p. 307;\r\n  _N. et E._ XIII. i. 246.)\r\n\r\n  [“The Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period mention Badakhshan\r\n  several times in connection with the political and military events\r\n  of that period. Guchluk, the ‘gurkhan of Karakhitai,’ was slain\r\n  in Badakhshan in 1218 (_d’Ohsson_, I. 272). In 1221, the Mongols\r\n  invaded the country (_l.c._ I. 272). On the same page, d’Ohsson\r\n  translates a short account of Badakhshan by Yakut (✛1229), stating\r\n  that this mountainous country is famed for its precious stones, and\r\n  especially rubies, called _Balakhsh_.” (Bretschneider, _Med. Res._\r\n  II. p. 66.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The account of the royal monopoly in working the mines, etc., has\r\n  continued accurate down to our own day. When Murad Beg of Kunduz\r\n  conquered Badakhshan some forty years ago, in disgust at the small\r\n  produce of the mines, he abandoned working them, and sold nearly\r\n  all the population of the place into slavery! They continue still\r\n  unworked, unless clandestinely. In 1866 the reigning Mír had one\r\n  of them opened at the request of Pandit Manphul, but without much\r\n  result.\r\n\r\n  The locality of the mines is on the right bank of the Oxus, in the\r\n  district of Ish Káshm and on the borders of SHIGNAN, the _Syghinan_\r\n  of the text. (_P. Manph.; Wood_, 206; _N. Ann. des. V._ xxvi. 300.)\r\n\r\n  [The ruby mines are really in the Gháran country, which extends\r\n  along both banks of the Oxus. Barshar is one of the deserted\r\n  villages; the boundary between Gháran and Shignán is the Kuguz\r\n  Parin (in Shighai dialect means “holes in the rock”); the Persian\r\n  equivalent is “Rafak-i-Somakh.” (Cf. Captain Trotter, _Forsyth’s\r\n  Mission_, p. 277.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The mines of _Lájwurd_ (whence _l’Azur_ and _Lazuli_)\r\n  have been, like the Ruby mines, celebrated for ages. They lie in\r\n  the Upper Valley of the Kokcha, called Korán, within the Tract\r\n  called _Yamgán_, of which the popular etymology is _Hamah-Kán_, or\r\n  “All-Mines,” and were visited by Wood in 1838. The produce now is\r\n  said to be of very inferior quality, and in quantity from 30 to 60\r\n  _poods_ (36 lbs each) annually. The best quality sells at Bokhara\r\n  at 30 to 60 tillas, or 12_l._ to 24_l._ the pood (_Manphul_).\r\n  Surely it is ominous when a British agent writing of Badakhshan\r\n  products finds it natural to express weights in Russian poods!\r\n\r\n  The Yamgán Tract also contains mines of iron, lead, alum,\r\n  salammoniac, sulphur, ochre, and copper. The last are not worked.\r\n  But I do not learn of any silver mines nearer than those of Paryán\r\n  in the Valley of Panjshir, south of the crest of the Hindu-Kúsh,\r\n  much worked in the early Middle Ages. (See _Cathay_, p. 595.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The Kataghan breed of horses from Badakhshan and Kunduz\r\n  has still a high reputation. They do not often reach India, as the\r\n  breed is a favourite one among the Afghan chiefs, and the horses\r\n  are likely to be appropriated in transit. (_Lumsden, Mission to\r\n  Kandahar_, p. 20.)\r\n\r\n  [The Kirghiz between the Yangi Hissar River and Sirikol are the\r\n  only people using the horse generally in the plough, oxen being\r\n  employed in the plains, and yaks in Sirikol. (Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  Gordon, p. 222, _Forsyth’s Mission_.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  What Polo heard of the Bucephalid strain was perhaps but another\r\n  form of a story told by the Chinese, many centuries earlier, when\r\n  speaking of this same region. A certain cave was frequented by a\r\n  wonderful stallion of supernatural origin. Hither the people yearly\r\n  brought their mares, and a famous breed was derived from the foals.\r\n  (_Rém. N. Mél. As._ I. 245.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The huskless barley of the text is thus mentioned by\r\n  Burnes in the vicinity of the Hindu-Kúsh: “They rear a barley in\r\n  this elevated country which has no husk, and grows like wheat; but\r\n  it is barley.” It is not properly _huskless_, but when ripe it\r\n  bursts the husk and remains so loosely attached as to be dislodged\r\n  from it by a slight shake. It is grown abundantly in Ladak and\r\n  the adjoining Hill States. Moorcroft details six varieties of\r\n  it cultivated there. The kind mentioned by Marco and Burnes is\r\n  probably that named by Royle _Hordeum Ægiceras_, and which has\r\n  been sent to England under the name of Tartarian Wheat, though it\r\n  is a genuine barley. _Naked barley_ is mentioned by Galen as grown\r\n  in Cappadocia; and Matthioli speaks of it as grown in France in his\r\n  day (middle of 16th century). It is also known to the Arabs, for\r\n  they have a name for it—_Sult_. (_Burnes_, III. 205; _Moorc._ II.\r\n  148 _seqq._; _Galen, de Aliment. Facult._ Lat. ed. 13; _Matthioli_,\r\n  Ven. 1585, p. 420; _Eng. Cyc._, art. Hordeum.)\r\n\r\n  Sesamé is mentioned by P. Manphul as one of the products of\r\n  Badakhshan; linseed is another, which is also used for oil.\r\n  Walnut-trees abound, but neither he nor Wood mention the oil.\r\n  We know that walnut oil is largely manufactured in Kashmir.\r\n  (_Moorcroft_, II. 148.)\r\n\r\n  [See on Saker and Lanner Falcons (_F. Sakar_, Briss.; _F.\r\n  lanarius_, Schlegel) the valuable paper by Edouard Blanc, _Sur\r\n  l’utilisation des Oiseaux de proie en Asie centrale_ in _Rev. des\r\n  Sciences natur. appliquées_, 20th June, 1895.\r\n\r\n  “Hawking is the favourite sport of Central Asian Lords,” says\r\n  G. Capus. (_A travers le royaume de Tamerlan_, p. 132. See pp.\r\n  132–134.)\r\n\r\n  The Mirza says (_l.c._ p. 157) that the mountains of Wakhán “are\r\n  only noted for producing a breed of hawks or falcons which the\r\n  hardy Wâkhânis manage to catch among the cliffs. These hawks are\r\n  much esteemed by the chiefs of Badakhshan, Bokhara, etc. They\r\n  are celebrated for their swiftness, and known by their white\r\n  colour.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—These wild sheep are probably the kind called _Kachkár_,\r\n  mentioned by Baber, and described by Mr. Blyth in his Monograph\r\n  of Wild Sheep, under the name of _Ovis Vignei_. It is extensively\r\n  diffused over all the ramifications of Hindu-Kúsh, and westward\r\n  perhaps to the Persian Elburz. “It is gregarious,” says Wood,\r\n  “congregating in herds of _several hundreds_.” In a later chapter\r\n  Polo speaks of a wild sheep apparently different and greater. (See\r\n  _J. A. S. B._, X. 858 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—This pleasant passage is only in Ramusio, but it would be\r\n  heresy to doubt its genuine character. Marco’s recollection of the\r\n  delight of convalescence in such a climate seems to lend an unusual\r\n  enthusiasm and felicity to his description of the scenery. Such a\r\n  region as he speaks of is probably the cool Plateau of Shewá, of\r\n  which we are told as extending about 25 miles eastward from near\r\n  Faizabad, and forming one of the finest pastures in Badakhshan. It\r\n  contains a large lake called by the frequent name Sar-i-Kol. No\r\n  European traveller in modern times (unless Mr. Gardner) has been on\r\n  those glorious table-lands. Burnes says that at Kunduz both natives\r\n  and foreigners spoke rapturously of the vales of Badakhshan, its\r\n  rivulets, romantic scenes and glens, its fruits, flowers, and\r\n  nightingales. Wood is reticent on scenery, naturally, since nearly\r\n  all his journey was made in winter. When approaching Faizabad on\r\n  his return from the Upper Oxus, however, he says: “On entering the\r\n  beautiful lawn at the gorge of its valley I was enchanted at the\r\n  quiet loveliness of the scene. Up to this time, from the day we\r\n  left Talikan, we had been moving in snow; but now it had nearly\r\n  vanished from the valley, and the fine sward was enamelled with\r\n  crocuses, daffodils, and snowdrops.” (_P. Manphul; Burnes_, III.\r\n  176; _Wood_, 252.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—Yet scarcely any country in the world has suffered so\r\n  terribly and repeatedly from invasion. “Enduring decay probably\r\n  commenced with the wars of Chinghiz, for many an instance in\r\n  Eastern history shows the permanent effect of such devastations....\r\n  Century after century saw only progress in decay. Even to our own\r\n  time the progress of depopulation and deterioration has continued.”\r\n  In 1759, two of the Khojas of Kashgar, escaping from the dominant\r\n  Chinese, took refuge in Badakhshan; one died of his wounds, the\r\n  other was treacherously slain by Sultan Shah, who then ruled the\r\n  country. The holy man is said in his dying moments to have invoked\r\n  curses on Badakhshan, and prayed that it might be three times\r\n  depopulated; a malediction which found ample accomplishment. The\r\n  misery of the country came to a climax about 1830, when the Uzbek\r\n  chief of Kunduz, Murad Beg Kataghan, swept away the bulk of the\r\n  inhabitants, and set them down to die in the marshy plains of\r\n  Kunduz. (_Cathay_, p. 542; _Faiz Bakhsh_, etc.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 9.—This “bombasticall dissimulation of their garments,” as\r\n  the author of _Anthropometamorphosis_ calls such a fashion, is\r\n  no longer affected by the ladies of Badakhshan. But a friend in\r\n  the Panjab observes that it still survives _there_. “There are\r\n  ladies’ trousers here which might almost justify Marco’s very\r\n  liberal estimate of the quantity of stuff required to make them;”\r\n  and among the Afghan ladies, Dr. Bellew says, the silken trousers\r\n  almost surpass crinoline in amplitude. It is curious to find the\r\n  same characteristic attaching to female figures on coins of ancient\r\n  kings of these regions, such as Agathocles and Pantaleon. (The last\r\n  name is appropriate!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                       OF THE PROVINCE OF PASHAI.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that ten days’ journey to the south of Badashan there is\r\na Province called PASHAI, the people of which have a peculiar language,\r\nand are Idolaters, of a brown complexion. They are great adepts in\r\nsorceries and the diabolic arts. The men wear earrings and brooches of\r\ngold and silver set with stones and pearls. They are a pestilent people\r\nand a crafty; and they live upon flesh and rice. Their country is very\r\nhot.{1}\r\n\r\nNow let us proceed and speak of another country which is seven days’\r\njourney from this one towards the south-east, and the name of which is\r\nKESHIMUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The name of PASHAI has already occurred (see ch. xviii.)\r\n  linked with DIR, as indicating a tract, apparently of very rugged\r\n  and difficult character, through which the partizan leader Nigúdar\r\n  passed in making an incursion from Badakhshan towards Káshmir. The\r\n  difficulty here lies in the name _Pashai_, which points to the\r\n  south-west, whilst _Dir_ and all other indications point to the\r\n  south-east. But Pashai seems to me the reading to which all texts\r\n  tend, whilst it is clearly expressed in the G. T. (_Pasciai_),\r\n  and it is contrary to all my experience of the interpretation of\r\n  Marco Polo to attempt to torture the name in the way which has been\r\n  common with commentators professed and occasional. But dropping\r\n  this name for a moment, let us see to what the other indications do\r\n  point.\r\n\r\n  In the meagre statements of this and the next chapter, interposed\r\n  as they are among chapters of detail unusually ample for Polo,\r\n  there is nothing to lead us to suppose that the Traveller ever\r\n  personally visited the countries of which these two chapters treat.\r\n  I believe we have here merely an amplification of the information\r\n  already sketched of the country penetrated by the Nigudarian bands\r\n  whose escapade is related in chapter xviii., information which was\r\n  probably derived from a Mongol source. And these countries are in\r\n  my belief _both_ regions famous in the legends of the Northern\r\n  Buddhists, viz. UDYÁNA and KÁSHMIR.\r\n\r\n  Udyána lay to the north of Pesháwar on the Swát River, but from the\r\n  extent assigned to it by Hiuen Tsang, the name probably covered a\r\n  large part of the whole hill-region south of the Hindu-Kúsh from\r\n  Chitrál to the Indus, as indeed it is represented in the Map of\r\n  Vivien de St. Martin (_Pèlerins Bouddhistes_, II.). It is regarded\r\n  by Fahian as the most northerly Province of India, and in his\r\n  time the food and clothing of the people were similar to those of\r\n  Gangetic India. It was the native country of Padma Sambhava, one\r\n  of the chief apostles of Lamaism, _i.e._ of Tibetan Buddhism, and\r\n  a great master of enchantments. The doctrines of Sakya, as they\r\n  prevailed in Udyána in old times, were probably strongly tinged\r\n  with Sivaitic magic, and the Tibetans still regard that locality\r\n  as the classic ground of sorcery and witchcraft.\r\n\r\n  Hiuen Tsang says of the inhabitants: “The men are of a soft\r\n  and pusillanimous character, _naturally inclined to craft and\r\n  trickery_. They are fond of study, but pursue it with no ardour.\r\n  _The science of magical formulae is become a regular professional\r\n  business with them_. They generally wear clothes of white cotton,\r\n  and rarely use any other stuff. Their spoken language, in spite of\r\n  some differences, has a strong resemblance to that of India.”\r\n\r\n  These particulars suit well with the slight description in our\r\n  text, and the Indian atmosphere that it suggests; and the direction\r\n  and distance ascribed to Pashai suit well with Chitral, which may\r\n  be taken as representing Udyána when approached from Badakhshan.\r\n  For it would be quite practicable for a party to reach the town of\r\n  Chitrál in ten days from the position assigned to the old capital\r\n  of Badakhshan. And from Chitrál the road towards Káshmir would lie\r\n  over the high Lahori pass to DIR, which from its mention in chapter\r\n  xviii. we must consider an obligatory point. (_Fah-hian_, p. 26;\r\n  _Koeppen_, I. 70; _Pèlerins Boud._ II. 131–132.)\r\n\r\n  [“Tao-lin (a Buddhist monk like Hiuen Tsang) afterwards left the\r\n  western regions and changed his road to go to Northern India;\r\n  he made a pilgrimage to _Kia-che-mi-louo_ (Káshmir), and then\r\n  entered the country of _U-ch’ang-na_ (Udyána)....” (Ed. Chavannes,\r\n  _I-tsing_, p. 105.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We must now turn to the name _Pashai_. The Pashai Tribe are now\r\n  Mahomedan, but are reckoned among the aboriginal inhabitants of the\r\n  country, which the Afghans are not. Baber mentions them several\r\n  times, and counts their language as one of the dozen that were\r\n  spoken at Kabul in his time. Burnes says it resembles that of the\r\n  Kafirs. A small vocabulary of it was published by Leech, in the\r\n  seventh volume of the _J. A. S. B._, which I have compared with\r\n  vocabularies of Siah-posh Kafir, published by Raverty in vol.\r\n  xxxiii. of the same journal, and by Lumsden in his _Report of the\r\n  Mission to Kandahar_, in 1837. Both are Aryan, and seemingly of\r\n  Professor Max Müller’s class _Indic_, but not _very_ close to one\r\n  another.[1]\r\n\r\n  Ibn Batuta, after crossing the Hindu-Kúsh by one of the passes\r\n  at the head of the Panjshir Valley, reaches the Mountain BASHÁI\r\n  (Pashai). In the same vicinity the Pashais are mentioned by Sidi\r\n  ’Ali, in 1554. And it is still in the neighbourhood of Panjshir\r\n  that the tribe is most numerous, though they have other settlements\r\n  in the hill-country about Nijrao, and on the left bank of the\r\n  Kabul River between Kabul and Jalalabad. _Pasha_ and _Pasha_-gar\r\n  is also named as one of the chief divisions of the Kafirs, and it\r\n  seems a fair conjecture that it represents those of the Pashais who\r\n  resisted or escaped conversion to Islam. (See _Leech’s Reports_ in\r\n  Collection pub. at Calcutta in 1839; _Baber_, 140; _Elphinstone_,\r\n  I. 411; _J. A. S. B._ VII. 329, 731, XXVIII. 317 _seqq._, XXXIII.\r\n  271–272; _I. B._ III. 86; _J. As._ IX. 203, and _J. R. A. S._ N.S.\r\n  V. 103, 278.)\r\n\r\n  The route of which Marco had heard must almost certainly have been\r\n  one of those leading by the high Valley of Zebák, and by the Doráh\r\n  or the Nuksán Pass, over the watershed of Hindu-Kúsh into Chitrál,\r\n  and so to Dir, as already noticed. The difficulty remains as to\r\n  how he came to apply the name _Pashai_ to the country south-east\r\n  of Badakhshan. I cannot tell. But it is at least possible that\r\n  the name of the Pashai tribe (of which the branches even now are\r\n  spread over a considerable extent of country) may have once had a\r\n  wide application over the southern spurs of the Hindu-Kúsh.[2]\r\n  Our Author, moreover, is speaking here from hearsay, and hearsay\r\n  geography without maps is much given to generalising. I apprehend\r\n  that, along with characteristics specially referable to the Tibetan\r\n  and Mongol traditions of Udyána, the term Pashai, as Polo uses\r\n  it, vaguely covers the whole tract from the southern boundary of\r\n  Badakhshan to the Indus and the Kabul River.\r\n\r\n  But even by extending its limits to Attok, we shall not get within\r\n  seven marches of Káshmir. It is 234 miles by road from Attok to\r\n  Srinagar; more than twice seven marches. And, according to Polo’s\r\n  usual system, the marches should be counted from Chitrál, or some\r\n  point thereabouts.\r\n\r\n  Sir H. Rawlinson, in his _Monograph on the Oxus_, has indicated\r\n  the probability that the name _Pashai_ may have been originally\r\n  connected with _Aprasin_ or _Paresín_, the Zendavestian name for\r\n  the Indian Caucasus, and which occurs in the Babylonian version\r\n  of the Behistun Inscription as the equivalent of Gadára in the\r\n  Persian, _i.e._ _Gandhára_, there applied to the whole country\r\n  between Bactria and the Indus. (See _J. R. G. S._ XLII. 502.) Some\r\n  such traditional application of the term Pashai might have survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] The Kafir dialect of which Mr. Trumpp collected some particulars\r\n    shows in the present tense of the substantive verb these remarkable\r\n    forms:— _Ei sŭm_, _Tŭ sis_, _siga sĕ_; _Ima sĭmĭs_, _Wĭ sik_, _Sigĕ\r\n    sin_.\r\n\r\n[2] In the _Tabakāt-i-Násiri_ (_Elliot_, II. 317) we find mention\r\n    of the Highlands of _Pasha-Afroz_, but nothing to define their\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n                     OF THE PROVINCE OF KESHIMUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeshimur also is a Province inhabited by a people who are Idolaters and\r\nhave a language of their own.{1} They have an astonishing acquaintance\r\nwith the devilries of enchantment; insomuch that they make their idols\r\nto speak. They can also by their sorceries bring on changes of weather\r\nand produce darkness, and do a number of things so extraordinary that\r\nno one without seeing them would believe them.{2} Indeed, this country\r\nis the very original source from which Idolatry has spread abroad.{3}\r\n\r\nIn this direction you can proceed further till you come to the Sea of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe men are brown and lean, but the women, taking them as brunettes,\r\nare very beautiful. The food of the people is flesh, and milk, and\r\nrice. The clime is finely tempered, being neither very hot nor very\r\ncold. There are numbers of towns and villages in the country, but also\r\nforests and desert tracts, and strong passes, so that the people have\r\nno fear of anybody, and keep their independence, with a king of their\r\nown to rule and do justice.{4}\r\n\r\nThere are in this country Eremites (after the fashion of those parts),\r\nwho dwell in seclusion and practise great abstinence in eating and\r\ndrinking. They observe strict chastity, and keep from all sins\r\nforbidden in their law, so that they are regarded by their own folk as\r\nvery holy persons. They live to a very great age.{5}\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of idolatrous abbeys and monasteries. [The\r\npeople of the province do not kill animals nor spill blood; so if they\r\nwant to eat meat they get the Saracens who dwell among them to play the\r\nbutcher.{6}] The coral which is carried from our parts of the world has\r\na better sale there than in any other country.{7}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Buddhist Temple at Pandrethan in Káshmir.]\r\n\r\nNow we will quit this country, and not go any further in the same\r\ndirection; for if we did so we should enter India; and that I do not\r\nwish to do at present. For, on our return journey, I mean to tell\r\nyou about India: all in regular order. Let us go back therefore to\r\nBadashan, for we cannot otherwise proceed on our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—I apprehend that in this chapter Marco represents\r\n  Buddhism (which is to be understood by his expression _Idolatry_,\r\n  not always, but usually) as in a position of greater life and\r\n  prosperity than we can believe it to have enjoyed in Káshmir at\r\n  the end of the 13th century, and I suppose that his knowledge of\r\n  it was derived in great part from tales of the Mongol and Tibetan\r\n  Buddhists about its past glories.\r\n\r\n  I know not if the spelling _Kesciemur_ represents any peculiar\r\n  Mongol pronunciation of the name. Plano Carpini, probably the\r\n  first modern European to mention this celebrated region, calls it\r\n  _Casmir_ (p. 708).\r\n\r\n  “The Cashmeerians,” says Abu’l Fazl, “have a language of their own,\r\n  but their books are written in the Shanskrit tongue, although the\r\n  character is sometimes Cashmeerian. They write chiefly upon _Tooz_\r\n  [birch-bark], which is the bark of a tree; it easily divides into\r\n  leaves, and remains perfect for many years.” (_Ayeen Akbery_, II.\r\n  147.) A sketch of Kashmiri Grammar by Mr. Edgeworth will be found\r\n  in vol. x. of the _J. A. S. B._, and a fuller one by Major Leech\r\n  in vol. xiii. Other contributions on the language are in vol.\r\n  xxxv. pt. i. p. 233 (Godwin-Austen); in vol. xxxix. pt. i. p. 95\r\n  (Dr. Elmslie); and in _Proceedings_ for 1866, p. 62, _seqq._ (Sir\r\n  G. Campbell and Bábú Rájendra Lál Mitra). The language, though in\r\n  large measure of Sanskrit origin, has words and forms that cannot\r\n  be traced in any other Indian vernacular. (_Campbell_, pp. 67, 68).\r\n  The character is a modification of the Panjáb Nagari.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The Kashmirian conjurers had made a great impression on\r\n  Marco, who had seen them at the Court of the Great Kaan, and he\r\n  recurs in a later chapter to their weather sorceries and other\r\n  enchantments, when we shall make some remarks. Meanwhile let us\r\n  cite a passage from Bernier, already quoted by M. Pauthier. When\r\n  crossing the Pír Panjál (the mountain crossed on entering Káshmir\r\n  from Lahore) with the camp of Aurangzíb, he met with “an old\r\n  Hermit who had dwelt upon the summit of the Pass since the days\r\n  of Jehangir, and whose religion nobody knew, although it was said\r\n  that he could work miracles, and used at his pleasure to produce\r\n  extraordinary thunderstorms, as well as hail, snow, rain, and\r\n  wind. There was something wild in his countenance, and in his\r\n  long, spreading, and tangled hoary beard. He asked alms fiercely,\r\n  allowing the travellers to drink from earthen cups that he had\r\n  set out upon a great stone, but signing to them to go quickly by\r\n  without stopping. He scolded those who made a noise, ‘for,’ said he\r\n  to me (after I had entered his cave and smoothed him down with a\r\n  half rupee which I put in his hand with all humility), ‘noise here\r\n  raises furious storms. Aurangzíb has done well in taking my advice\r\n  and prohibiting it. Shah Jehan always did the like. But Jehangir\r\n  once chose to laugh at what I said, and made his drums and trumpets\r\n  sound; the consequence was he nearly lost his life.’” (_Bernier_,\r\n  Amst. ed. 1699, II. 290.) A successor of this hermit was found on\r\n  the same spot by P. Desideri in 1713, and another by Vigne in 1837.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Though the earliest entrance of Buddhism into Tibet was\r\n  from India Proper, yet Káshmir twice in the history of Tibetan\r\n  Buddhism played a most important part. It was in Káshmir that was\r\n  gathered, under the patronage of the great King Kanishka, soon\r\n  after our era, the Fourth Buddhistic Council, which marks the point\r\n  of separation between Northern and Southern Buddhism. Numerous\r\n  missionaries went forth from Káshmir to spread the doctrine in\r\n  Tibet and in Central Asia. Many of the Pandits who laboured at the\r\n  translation of the sacred books into Tibetan were Kashmiris, and\r\n  it was even in Káshmir that several of the translations were made.\r\n  But these were not the only circumstances that made Káshmir a holy\r\n  land to the Northern Buddhists. In the end of the 9th century the\r\n  religion was extirpated in Tibet by the Julian of the Lamas, the\r\n  great persecutor Langdarma, and when it was restored, a century\r\n  later, it was from Káshmir in particular that fresh missionaries\r\n  were procured to reinstruct the people in the forgotten Law. (See\r\n  _Koeppen_, II. 12–13, 78; _J. As._ sér. VI. tom. vi. 540.)\r\n\r\n  “The spread of Buddhism to Káshmir is an event of extraordinary\r\n  importance in the history of that religion. Thenceforward that\r\n  country became a mistress in the Buddhist Doctrine and the\r\n  headquarters of a particular school.... The influence of Káshmir\r\n  was very marked, especially in the spread of Buddhism beyond India.\r\n  From Káshmir it penetrated to Kandahar and Kabul, ... and thence\r\n  over Bactria. Tibetan Buddhism also had its essential origin from\r\n  Káshmir; ... so great is the importance of this region in the\r\n  History of Buddhism.” (_Vassilyev, Der Buddhismus_, I. 44.)\r\n\r\n  In the account which the Mahawanso gives of the consecration of\r\n  the great Tope at Ruanwelli, by Dutthagamini, King of Ceylon (B.C.\r\n  157), 280,000 priests (!) come from Káshmir, a far greater number\r\n  than is assigned to any other country except one. (_J. A. S. B._\r\n  VII. 165.)\r\n\r\n  It is thus very intelligible how Marco learned from the Mongols and\r\n  the Lamas with whom he came in contact to regard Káshmir as “the\r\n  very original source from which their Religion had spread abroad.”\r\n  The feeling with which they looked to Káshmir must have been nearly\r\n  the same as that with which the Buddhists of Burma look to Ceylon.\r\n  But this feeling towards Káshmir does not _now_, I am informed,\r\n  exist in Tibet. The reverence for the holy places has reverted to\r\n  Bahár and the neighbouring “cradle-lands” of Buddhism.\r\n\r\n  It is notable that the historian Firishta, in a passage quoted\r\n  by Tod, uses Marco’s expression in reference to Káshmir, almost\r\n  precisely, saying that the Hindoos derived their idolatry from\r\n  Káshmir, “the foundry of magical superstition.” (_Rajasthan_, I.\r\n  219.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The people of Káshmir retain their beauty, but they are\r\n  morally one of the most degraded races in Asia. Long oppression,\r\n  now under the Lords of Jamu as great as ever, has no doubt\r\n  aggravated this. Yet it would seem that twelve hundred years ago\r\n  the evil elements were there as well as the beauty. The Chinese\r\n  traveller says: “Their manners are light and volatile, their\r\n  characters effeminate and pusillanimous.... They are very handsome,\r\n  but their natural bent is to fraud and trickery.” (_Pèl. Boud._ II.\r\n  167–168.) Vigne’s account is nearly the same. (II. 142–143.) “They\r\n  are as mischievous as monkeys, and far more malicious,” says Mr.\r\n  Shaw (p. 292).\r\n\r\n  [Bernier says: “The women [of Kachemire] especially are very\r\n  handsome; and it is from this country that nearly every individual,\r\n  when first admitted to the court of the Great Mogul, selects\r\n  wives or concubines, that his children may be whiter than the\r\n  Indians, and pass for genuine Moguls. Unquestionably, there must\r\n  be beautiful women among the higher classes, if we may judge by\r\n  those of the lower orders seen in the streets and in the shops.”\r\n  (_Travels in the Mogul Empire_, edited by Archibald Constable,\r\n  1891, p. 404.)]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—In the time of Hiuen Tsang, who spent two years studying\r\n  in Káshmir in the first half of the 7th century, though there\r\n  were many Brahmans in the country, Buddhism was in a flourishing\r\n  state; there were 100 convents with about 5000 monks. In the end\r\n  of the 11th century a King (Harshadeva, 1090–1102) is mentioned\r\n  _exceptionally_ as a protector of Buddhism. The supposition has\r\n  been intimated above that Marco’s picture refers to a traditional\r\n  state of things, but I must notice that a like picture is presented\r\n  in the Chinese account of Hulaku’s war. One of the thirty kingdoms\r\n  subdued by the Mongols was “The kingdom of Fo (Buddha) called\r\n  _Kishimi_. It lies to the N.W. of India. There are to be seen the\r\n  men who are counted the successors of Shakia; their ancient and\r\n  venerable air recalls the countenance of Bodi-dharma as one sees\r\n  it in pictures. They abstain from wine, and content themselves\r\n  with a gill of rice for their daily food, and are occupied only in\r\n  reciting the prayers and litanies of Fo.” (_Rém. N. Mél. Asiat._ I.\r\n  179.) Abu’l Fazl says that on his third visit with Akbar to Káshmir\r\n  he discovered some old men of the religion of Buddha, but none of\r\n  them were _literati_. The _Rishis_, of whom he speaks with high\r\n  commendation as abstaining from meat and from female society, as\r\n  charitable and unfettered by traditions, were perhaps a modified\r\n  remnant of the Buddhist Eremites. Colonel Newall, in a paper on the\r\n  Rishis of Káshmir, traces them to a number of Shiáh Sayads, who\r\n  fled to Káshmir in the time of Timur. But evidently the _genus_ was\r\n  of much earlier date, long preceding the introduction of Islam.\r\n  (_Vie et V. de H. T._ p. 390; _Lassen_, III. 709; _Ayeen Akb._ II.\r\n  147, III. 151; _J. A. S. B._ XXXIX. pt. i. 265.)\r\n\r\n  We see from the _Dabistan_ that in the 17th century Káshmir\r\n  continued to be a great resort of Magian mystics and sages of\r\n  various sects, professing great abstinence and credited with\r\n  preternatural powers. And indeed Vámbéry tells us that even in\r\n  our own day the Kashmiri Dervishes are pre-eminent among their\r\n  Mahomedan brethren for cunning, secret arts, skill in exorcisms,\r\n  etc. (_Dab._ I. 113 _seqq._ II. 147–148; _Vámb. Sk. of Cent. Asia_,\r\n  9.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The first precept of the Buddhist Decalogue, or Ten\r\n  Obligations of the Religious Body, is not to take life. But _animal\r\n  food_ is not forbidden, though restricted. Indeed it is one of the\r\n  circumstances in the Legendary History of Sakya Muni, which looks\r\n  as if it _must_ be true, that he is related to have aggravated\r\n  his fatal illness by eating a dish of pork set before him by a\r\n  hospitable goldsmith. Giorgi says the butchers in Tibet are looked\r\n  on as infamous; and people selling sheep or the like will make a\r\n  show of exacting an assurance that these are not to be slaughtered.\r\n  In Burma, when a British party wanted beef, the owner of the\r\n  bullocks would decline to make one over, but would point one out\r\n  that might be shot by the foreigners.\r\n\r\n  In Tibetan history it is told of the persecutor Langdarma that he\r\n  compelled members of the highest orders of the clergy to become\r\n  hunters and butchers. A Chinese collection of epigrams, dating\r\n  from the 9th century, gives a facetious list of _Incongruous\r\n  Conditions_, among which we find a poor Parsi, a sick Physician, a\r\n  fat Bride, a Teacher who does not know his letters, and _a Butcher\r\n  who reads the Scriptures_ (of Buddhism)! (_Alph. Tib._ 445;\r\n  _Koeppen_, I. 74; _N. and Q., C. and J._ III. 33.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—Coral is still a very popular adornment in the Himalayan\r\n  countries. The merchant Tavernier says the people to the north of\r\n  the Great Mogul’s territories and in the mountains of Assam and\r\n  Tibet were the greatest purchasers of coral. (_Tr. in India_, Bk.\r\n  II. ch. xxiii.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                    OF THE GREAT RIVER OF BADASHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn leaving Badashan you ride twelve days between east and north-east,\r\nascending a river that runs through land belonging to a brother of\r\nthe Prince of Badashan, and containing a good many towns and villages\r\nand scattered habitations. The people are Mahommetans, and valiant\r\nin war. At the end of those twelve days you come to a province of no\r\ngreat size, extending indeed no more than three days’ journey in any\r\ndirection, and this is called VOKHAN. The people worship Mahommet, and\r\nthey have a peculiar language. They are gallant soldiers, and they have\r\na chief whom they call NONE, which is as much as to say _Count_, and\r\nthey are liegemen to the Prince of Badashan.{1}\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of wild beasts of all sorts in this region. And when\r\nyou leave this little country, and ride three days north-east, always\r\namong mountains, you get to such a height that ’tis said to be the\r\nhighest place in the world! And when you have got to this height you\r\nfind [a great lake between two mountains, and out of it] a fine river\r\nrunning through a plain clothed with the finest pasture in the world;\r\ninsomuch that a lean beast there will fatten to your heart’s content in\r\nten days. There are great numbers of all kinds of wild beasts; among\r\nothers, wild sheep of great size, whose horns are good six palms in\r\nlength. From these horns the shepherds make great bowls to eat from,\r\nand they use the horns also to enclose folds for their cattle at night.\r\n[Messer Marco was told also that the wolves were numerous, and killed\r\nmany of those wild sheep. Hence quantities of their horns and bones\r\nwere found, and these were made into great heaps by the way-side, in\r\norder to guide travellers when snow was on the ground.]\r\n\r\nThe plain is called PAMIER, and you ride across it for twelve days\r\ntogether, finding nothing but a desert without habitations or any green\r\nthing, so that travellers are obliged to carry with them whatever they\r\nhave need of. The region is so lofty and cold that you do not even see\r\nany birds flying. And I must notice also that because of this great\r\ncold, fire does not burn so brightly, nor give out so much heat as\r\nusual, nor does it cook food so effectually.{2}\r\n\r\nNow, if we go on with our journey towards the east-north-east, we\r\ntravel a good forty days, continually passing over mountains and hills,\r\nor through valleys, and crossing many rivers and tracts of wilderness.\r\nAnd in all this way you find neither habitation of man, nor any green\r\nthing, but must carry with you whatever you require. The country is\r\ncalled BOLOR. The people dwell high up in the mountains, and are savage\r\nIdolaters, living only by the chase, and clothing themselves in the\r\nskins of beasts. They are in truth an evil race.{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[“The length of Little Pamir, according to Trotter, is 68\r\n  miles.... To find the twelve days’ ride in the plain of Marco Polo,\r\n  it must be admitted, says Severtsof (_Bul. Soc. Géog._ XI. 1890,\r\n  pp. 588–589), that he went down a considerable distance along the\r\n  south-north course of the Aksu, in the Aktash Valley, and did not\r\n  turn towards Tásh Kurgán, by the Neza Tash Pass, crossed by Gordon\r\n  and Trotter. The descent from this pass to Tásh Kurgán finishes\r\n  with a difficult and narrow defile, which may well be overflowed at\r\n  the great melting of snow, from the end of May till the middle of\r\n  June, even to July.\r\n\r\n  “Therefore he must have left the Aksu Valley to cross the Pass of\r\n  Tagharma, about 50 or 60 kilometres to the north of the Neza Tash\r\n  Pass; thence to Kashgar, the distance, in a straight line, is about\r\n  200 kilometres, and less than 300 by the shortest route which runs\r\n  from the Tagharma Pass to little Kara Kul, and from there down to\r\n  Yangi Hissar, along the Ghidjik. And Marco Polo assigns _forty_\r\n  days for this route, while he allows but _thirty_ for the journey\r\n  of 500 kilometres (at least) from Jerm to the foot of the Tagharma\r\n  Pass.”\r\n\r\n  Professor Paquier (_Bul. Soc. Géog._ 6ᵉ Sér. XII. pp. 121–125)\r\n  remarks that the Moonshee, sent by Captain Trotter to survey\r\n  the Oxus between Ishkashm and Kila Wamár, could not find at the\r\n  spot marked by Yule on his map, the mouth of the Shakh-Dara, but\r\n  northward 7 or 8 miles from the junction of the Murghab with the\r\n  Oxus, he saw the opening of an important water-course, the Suchnan\r\n  River, formed by the Shakh-Dara and the Ghund-Dara. Marco arrived\r\n  at a place between Northern Wakhán and Shihgnan; from the Central\r\n  Pamir, Polo would have taken a route identical with that of the\r\n  Mirza (1868–1869) by the Chichiklik Pass. Professor Paquier adds:\r\n  “I have no hesitation in believing that Marco Polo was in the\r\n  neighbourhood of that great commercial road, which by the _Vallis\r\n  Comedarum_ reached the foot of the Imaüs. He probably did not\r\n  venture on a journey of fifty marches in an unknown country. At the\r\n  top of the Shihgnan Valley, he doubtless found a road marked out\r\n  to Little Bukharia. This was the road followed in ancient times\r\n  from Bactrian to Serica; and Ptolemy has, so to speak, given us\r\n  its landmarks after Marinus of Tyre, by the _Vallis Comedarum_\r\n  (Valley of actual Shihgnan); the _Turris Lapidea_ and the _Statio\r\n  Mercatorum_, neighbourhood of Tásh Kurgán, capital of the present\r\n  province of Sar-i-kol.”\r\n\r\n  I must say that accepting, as I do, for Polo’s Itinerary, the route\r\n  from Wakhán to Kashgar by the Taghdum-Bash Pamir, and Tásh Kurgán,\r\n  I do not agree with Professor Paquier’s theory. But though I prefer\r\n  Sir H. Yule’s route from Badakhshan, by the River Vardoj, the Pass\r\n  of Ishkashm, the Panja, to Wakhán, I do not accept his views for\r\n  the Itinerary from Wakhán to Kashgar; see p. 175.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The river along which Marco travels from Badakhshan is no doubt\r\n  the upper stream of the Oxus, known locally as the Panja, along\r\n  which Wood also travelled, followed of late by the Mirza and Faiz\r\n  Bakhsh. It is true that the river is reached from Badaskhshan\r\n  Proper by ascending another river (the Vardoj) and crossing the\r\n  Pass of Ishkáshm, but in the brief style of our narrative we must\r\n  expect such condensation.\r\n\r\n  WAKHÁN was restored to geography by Macartney, in the able map\r\n  which he compiled for Elphinstone’s _Caubul_, and was made known\r\n  more accurately by Wood’s journey through it. [The district of\r\n  Wakhán “comprises the valleys containing the two heads of the\r\n  Panjah branch of the Oxus, and the valley of the Panjah itself,\r\n  from the junction at Zung down to Ishkashím. The northern branch\r\n  of the Panjah has its principal source in the Lake Victoria in the\r\n  Great Pamir, which as well as the Little Pamir, belongs to Wakhán,\r\n  the Aktash River forming the well recognized boundary between\r\n  Kashgaria and Wakhán.” (Captain Trotter, _Forsyth’s Mission_, p.\r\n  275.) The southern branch is the Sarhadd Valley.—H. C.] The lowest\r\n  part is about 8000 feet above the sea, and the highest _Kishlak_,\r\n  or village, about 11,500. A few willows and poplars are the only\r\n  trees that can stand against the bitter blasts that blow down the\r\n  valley. Wood estimated the total population of the province at\r\n  only 1000 souls, though it might be capable of supporting 5000.[1]\r\n  He saw it, however, in the depth of winter. As to the peculiar\r\n  language, see note I, ch. xxix. It is said to be a very old dialect\r\n  of Persian. A scanty vocabulary was collected by Hayward. (_J.\r\n  R. G. S._ XXI. p. 29.) The people, according to Shaw, have Aryan\r\n  features, resembling those of the Kashmiris, but harsher.\r\n\r\n  [Cf. Captain Trotter’s _The Oxus below Wakhan, Forsyth’s Mission_,\r\n  p. 276.]\r\n\r\n  We appear to see in the indications of this paragraph precisely the\r\n  same system of government that now prevails in the Oxus valleys.\r\n  The central districts of Faizabad and Jerm are under the immediate\r\n  administration of the Mír of Badakhshan, whilst fifteen other\r\n  districts, such as _Kishm, Rusták, Zebák, Ishkáshm, Wakhán_, are\r\n  dependencies “held by the _relations of the Mír_, or by hereditary\r\n  rulers, on a feudal tenure, conditional on fidelity and military\r\n  service in time of need, the holders possessing supreme authority\r\n  in their respective territories, and paying little or no tribute\r\n  to the paramount power.” (_Pandit Manphul_.) The first part of\r\n  the valley of which Marco speaks as belonging to a brother of the\r\n  Prince, may correspond to Ishkáshm, or perhaps to Vardoj; the\r\n  second, Wakhán, seems to have had a hereditary ruler; but both\r\n  were vassals of the Prince of Badakhshan, and therefore are styled\r\n  _Counts_, not kings or _Seigneurs_.\r\n\r\n  The native title which Marco gives as the equivalent of Count is\r\n  remarkable. _Non_ or _None_, as it is variously written in the\r\n  texts, would in French form represent _Nono_ in Italian. Pauthier\r\n  refers this title to the “_Rao_-nana (or nano) _Rao_” which figures\r\n  as the style of Kanerkes in the Indo-Scythic coinage. But Wilson\r\n  (_Ariana Antiqua_, p. 358) interprets _Raonano_ as most probably\r\n  a genitive plural of Rao, whilst the whole inscription answers\r\n  precisely to the Greek one ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΚΑΝΗΡΚΟΥ, which is\r\n  found on other coins of the same prince. General Cunningham, a very\r\n  competent authority, adheres to this view, and writes: “I do not\r\n  think _None_ or _Non_ can have any connection with the _Nana_ of\r\n  the coins.”\r\n\r\n  It is remarkable, however, that NONO (said to signify “younger,” or\r\n  lesser) is in Tibet the title given to a younger brother, deputy,\r\n  or subordinate prince. In Cunningham’s _Ladak_ (259) we read:\r\n  “_Nono_ is the usual term of respect which is used in addressing\r\n  any young man of the higher ranks, and when prefixed to _Kahlon_\r\n  it means the younger or deputy minister.” And again (p. 352):\r\n  “_Nono_ is the title given to a younger brother. Nono Sungnam was\r\n  the younger brother of Chang Raphtan, the Kahlon of Bazgo.” I have\r\n  recently encountered the word used independently, and precisely in\r\n  Marco’s application of it. An old friend, in speaking of a journey\r\n  that he had made in our Tibetan provinces, said incidentally that\r\n  he had accompanied the commissioner _to the installation of a new_\r\n  NONO (I think in Spiti). The term here corresponds so precisely\r\n  with the explanation which Marco gives of _None_ as a Count subject\r\n  to a superior sovereign, that it is difficult to regard the\r\n  coincidence as accidental. The _Yuechi_ or Indo-Scyths who long\r\n  ruled the Oxus countries are said to have been of Tibetan origin,\r\n  and Al-Biruni repeats a report that this was so. (_Elliot._ II.\r\n  9.)[2] Can this title have been a trace of their rule? Or is it\r\n  Indian?\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This chapter is one of the most interesting in the book,\r\n  and contains one of its most splendid anticipations of modern\r\n  exploration, whilst conversely Lieutenant John Wood’s narrative\r\n  presents the most brilliant confirmation in detail of Marco’s\r\n  narrative.\r\n\r\n  We have very old testimony to the recognition of the great altitude\r\n  of the Plateau of PAMIR (the name which Marco gives it and which\r\n  it still retains), and to the existence of the lake (or lakes)\r\n  upon its surface. The Chinese pilgrims Hwui Seng and Sung Yun,\r\n  who passed this way A.D. 518, inform us that these high lands of\r\n  the Tsung Ling were commonly said to be midway between heaven and\r\n  earth. The more celebrated Hiuen Tsang, who came this way nearly\r\n  120 years later (about 644) on his return to China, “after crossing\r\n  the mountains for 700 _li_, arrived at the valley of _Pomilo_\r\n  (Pamir). This valley is 1000 _li_ (about 200 miles) from east to\r\n  west, and 100 _li_ (20 miles) from north to south, and lies between\r\n  two snowy ranges in the centre of the Tsung Ling mountains. The\r\n  traveller is annoyed by sudden gusts of wind, and the snow-drifts\r\n  never cease, spring or summer. As the soil is almost constantly\r\n  frozen, you see but a few miserable plants, and no crops can live.\r\n  The whole tract is but a dreary waste, without a trace of human\r\n  kind. In the middle of the valley is a great lake 300 _li_ (60\r\n  miles) from east to west, and 500 _li_ from north to south. This\r\n  stands in the centre of Jambudwipa (the Buddhist οἰκουμένη) on a\r\n  plateau of prodigious elevation. An endless variety of creatures\r\n  peoples its waters. When you hear the murmur and clash of its waves\r\n  you think you are listening to the noisy hum of a great market\r\n  in which vast crowds of people are mingling in excitement....\r\n  The lake discharges to the west, and a river runs out of it in\r\n  that direction and joins the _Potsu_ (Oxus).... The lake likewise\r\n  discharges to the east, and a great river runs out, which flows\r\n  eastward to the western frontier of _Kiesha_ (Káshgar), where it\r\n  joins the River Sita, and runs eastward with it into the sea.” The\r\n  story of an eastern outflow from the lake is, no doubt, legend,\r\n  connected with an ancient Hindu belief (see _Cathay_, p. 347), but\r\n  Burnes in modern times heard much the same story. And the Mirza, in\r\n  1868, took up the same impression regarding the smaller lake called\r\n  Pamir Kul, in which the southern branch of the Panja originates.\r\n\r\n  “After quitting the (frozen) surface of the river,” says Wood,\r\n  “we ... ascended a low hill, which apparently bounded the valley\r\n  to the eastward. On surmounting this, at 3 P.M. of the 19th\r\n  February, 1838, we stood, to use a native expression, upon the\r\n  _Bám-i-Duniah_, or ‘Roof of the World,’ while before us lay\r\n  stretched a noble but frozen sheet of water, from whose western\r\n  end issued the infant river of the Oxus. This fine lake (Sirikol)\r\n  lies in the form of a crescent, about 14 miles long from east\r\n  to west, by an average breadth of 1 mile. On three sides it is\r\n  bordered by swelling hills about 500 feet high, while along its\r\n  southern bank they rise into mountains 3500 feet above the lake, or\r\n  19,000 feet above the sea, and covered with perpetual snow, from\r\n  which never-failing source the lake is supplied.... Its elevation,\r\n  measured by the temperature of boiling water, is 15,600 feet.”\r\n\r\n  The absence of birds on Pamir, reported by Marco, probably shows\r\n  that he passed very late or early in the season. Hiuen Tsang, we\r\n  see, gives a different account; Wood was there in the winter, but\r\n  heard that in summer the lake swarmed with water-fowl. [Cf. Captain\r\n  Trotter, p. 263, in _Forsyth’s Mission_.]\r\n\r\n  The Pamir Steppe was crossed by Benedict Goës late in the autumn of\r\n  1603, and the narrative speaks of the great cold and desolation,\r\n  and the difficulty of breathing. We have also an abstract of the\r\n  journey of Abdul Mejid, a British Agent, who passed Pamir on\r\n  his way to Kokan in 1861:—“Fourteen weary days were occupied in\r\n  crossing the steppe; the marches were long, depending on uncertain\r\n  supplies of grass and water, which sometimes wholly failed them;\r\n  food for man and beast had to be carried with the party, for not a\r\n  trace of human habitation is to be met with in those inhospitable\r\n  wilds.... The steppe is interspersed with tamarisk jungle and\r\n  the wild willow, and in the summer with tracts of high grass.”\r\n  (_Neumann_, _Pilgerfahrten Buddh.

S._ X. 150.)\r\n\r\n  There is nothing absolutely to decide whether Marco’s route from\r\n  Wakhán lay by Wood’s Lake “Sirikol,” or Victoria, or by the more\r\n  southerly source of the Oxus in Pamir Kul. These routes would unite\r\n  in the valley of Táshkurgán, and his road thence to Kashgar was,\r\n  I apprehend, nearly the same as the Mirza’s in 1868–1869, by the\r\n  lofty Chichiklik Pass and Kin Valley. But I cannot account for the\r\n  forty days of wilderness. The Mirza was but thirty-four days _from\r\n  Faizabad to Kashgar_, and Faiz Bakhsh only twenty-five.\r\n\r\n  [Severtsof (_Bul. Soc. Géog._ XI. 1890, p. 587), who accepts\r\n  Trotter’s route, by the Pamir Khurd (Little Pamir), says there are\r\n  three routes from Wakhán to Little Pamir, going up the Sarhadd: one\r\n  during the winter, by the frozen river; the two others available\r\n  during the spring and the summer, up and down the snowy chain along\r\n  the right bank of the Sarhadd, until the valley widens out into a\r\n  plain, where a swelling is hardly to be seen, so flat is it; this\r\n  chain is the dividing ridge between the Sarhadd and the Aksu. From\r\n  the summit, the traveller, looking towards the west, sees _at his\r\n  feet_ the mountains he has crossed; to the east, the Pamir Kul and\r\n  the Aksu, the river flowing from it. The pasture grounds around\r\n  the Pamir Kul and the sources of the Sarhadd are magnificent; but\r\n  lower down, the Aksu valley is arid, _dotted_ only with pasture\r\n  grounds of little extent, and few and far between. It is to this\r\n  part of Pamir that Marco Polo’s description applies; more than any\r\n  other part of this _ensemble_ of high valleys, this line of water\r\n  parting, of the Sarhadd and the Aksu, has the aspect of a _Roof of\r\n  the World_ (_Bam-i-dunya_, Persian name of Pamir).—H. C.].\r\n\r\n  [We can trace Marco Polo’s route from Wakhán, on comparing it with\r\n  Captain Younghusband’s Itinerary from Kashgar, which he left on the\r\n  22nd July, 1891, for Little Pamir: Little Pamir at Bozai-Gumbaz,\r\n  joins with the Pamir-i-Wakhán at the Wakhijrui Pass, first explored\r\n  by Colonel Lockhart’s mission. Hence the route lies by the old\r\n  fort of Kurgan-i-Ujadbai at the junction of the two branches of\r\n  the Tagh-dum-bash Pamir (Supreme Head of the Mountains), the\r\n  Tagh-dum-bash Pamir, Tásh Kurgán, Bulun Kul, the Gez Defile and\r\n  Kashgar. (_Proc. R. G. S._ XIV. 1892, pp. 205–234.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We may observe that Severtsof asserts _Pamir_ to be a generic term,\r\n  applied to all high plateaux in the Thian Shan.[3]\r\n\r\n  [“The Pámír plateau may be described as a great, broad, rounded\r\n  ridge, extending north and south, and crossed by thick mountain\r\n  chains, between which lie elevated valleys, open and gently\r\n  sloping towards the east, but narrow and confined, with a rapid\r\n  fall towards the west. The waters which run in all, with the\r\n  exception of the eastern flow from the Tághdúngbásh, collect in the\r\n  Oxus; the Áksú from the Little Pámír lake receiving the eastern\r\n  drainage, which finds an outlet in the Áktásh Valley, and joining\r\n  the Múrgháb, which obtains that from the Alichór and Síríz Pámírs.\r\n  As the eastern Tághdúngbásh stream finds its way into the Yarkand\r\n  river, the watershed must be held as extending from that Pámír,\r\n  down the range dividing it from the Little Pámír, and along the\r\n  Neza Tásh mountains to the Kizil Art Pass, leading to the Alái.”\r\n  (Colonel Gordon, _Forsyth’s Mission_, p. 231.)\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon (_Forsyth’s Mission_, p. 231) says also:\r\n  “Regarding the name ‘Pámír,’ the meaning appears to be wilderness—a\r\n  place depopulated, abandoned, waste, yet capable of habitation.\r\n  I obtained this information on the Great Pámír from one of our\r\n  intelligent guides, who said in explanation—‘In former days, when\r\n  this part was inhabited by Kirghiz, as is shown by the ruins of\r\n  their villages and burial-grounds, the valley was not all called\r\n  Pámír, as it is now. It was known by its village names, as is the\r\n  country beyond Sirikol, which being now occupied by Kirghiz is\r\n  not known by one name, but partly as Chárling, Bas Robát, etc. If\r\n  deserted it would be Pámír.’” In a note Sir T. D. Forsyth adds that\r\n  the same explanation of the word was given to him at Yangi-Hissar,\r\n  and that it is in fact a Khokandi-Turki word.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  It would seem, from such notices as have been received, that there\r\n  is not, strictly speaking, one steppe called Pamir, but a variety\r\n  of _Pamirs_, which are lofty valleys between ranges of hills,\r\n  presenting luxuriant summer pasture, and with floors more or less\r\n  flat, but nowhere more than 5 or 6 miles in width and often much\r\n  less.\r\n\r\n  [This is quite exact; Mr. E. Delmar Morgan writes in the _Scottish\r\n  Geog. Mag._ January, 1892, p. 17: “Following the terminology of\r\n  Yule adopted by geographers, and now well established, we have (1)\r\n  Pamir Alichur; (2) Pamir Khurd (or “Little”); (3) Pamir Kalan (or\r\n  “Great”); (4) Pamir Khargosi (“of the hare”); (5) Pamir Sares; (6)\r\n  Pamir Rang-kul.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Horns of _Ovis Poli_.]\r\n\r\n  Wood speaks of the numerous wolves in this region. And the great\r\n  sheep is that to which Blyth, in honour of our traveller, has\r\n  given the name of _Ovis Poli_.[4] A pair of horns, sent by Wood to\r\n  the Royal Asiatic Society, and of which a representation is given\r\n  above, affords the following dimensions:—Length of one horn on the\r\n  curve, 4 feet 8 inches; round the base 14¼ inches; distance of tips\r\n  apart 3 feet 9 inches. This sheep appears to be the same as the\r\n  _Rass_, of which Burnes heard that the horns were so big that a man\r\n  could not lift a pair, and that foxes bred in them; also that the\r\n  carcass formed a load for two horses. Wood says that these horns\r\n  supply shoes for the Kirghiz horses, and also a good substitute\r\n  for stirrup-irons. “We saw numbers of horns strewed about in\r\n  every direction, the spoils of the Kirghiz hunter. Some of these\r\n  were of an astonishingly large size, and belonged to an animal\r\n  of a species between a goat and a sheep, inhabiting the steppes\r\n  of Pamir. _The ends of the horns projecting above the snow often\r\n  indicated the direction of the road_; and wherever they were heaped\r\n  in large quantities and disposed in a semicircle, there our escort\r\n  recognised the site of a Kirghiz summer encampment.... We came in\r\n  sight of a rough-looking building, decked out with the horns of the\r\n  wild sheep, and all but buried amongst the snow. It was a Kirghiz\r\n  burying-ground.” (Pp. 223, 229, 231.)\r\n\r\n  [With reference to Wood’s remark that the horns of the _Ovis Poli_\r\n  supply shoes for the Kirghiz horses, Mr. Rockhill writes to me that\r\n  a Paris newspaper of 24th November, 1894, observes: “Horn shoes\r\n  made of the horn of sheep are successfully used in Lyons. They are\r\n  especially adapted to horses employed in towns, where the pavements\r\n  are often slippery. Horses thus shod can be driven, it is said, at\r\n  the most rapid pace over the worst pavement without slipping.”\r\n\r\n  (Cf. Rockhill, _Rubruck_, p. 69; _Chasses et Explorations dans\r\n  la Région des Pamirs_, par le Vte. Ed. de Poncins, Paris, 1897,\r\n  8vo.—H. C.).]\r\n\r\n  In 1867 this great sheep was shot by M. Severtsof, on the Plateau\r\n  of Aksai, in the western Thian Shan. He reports these animals to\r\n  go in great herds, and to be very difficult to kill. However, he\r\n  brought back two specimens. The Narin River is stated to be the\r\n  northern limit of the species.[5] Severtsof also states that the\r\n  enemies of the _Ovis Poli_ are the wolves, [and Colonel Gordon says\r\n  that the leopards and wolves prey almost entirely upon them. (On\r\n  the _Ovis Poli_, see Captain Deasy, _In Tibet_, p. 361.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Ovis Poli_, the Great Sheep of Pamir. (After\r\n    Severtsof.)\r\n\r\n    “=Il hi a grant moutitude de mouton sauvages qe sunt grandisme, car\r\n    ont les cornes bien six paumes=” ...]\r\n\r\n  Colonel Gordon, the head of the exploring party detached by Sir\r\n  Douglas Forsyth, brought away a head of _Ovis Poli_, which quite\r\n  bears out the account by its eponymus of horns “good 6 palms in\r\n  length,” say 60 inches. This head, as I learn from a letter of\r\n  Colonel Gordon’s to a friend, has one horn perfect which measures\r\n  65½ inches on the curves; the other, broken at the tip, measures 64\r\n  inches; the straight line between the tips is 55 inches.\r\n\r\n  [Captain Younghusband [1886] “before leaving the Altai Mountains,\r\n  picked up several heads of the _Ovis Poli_, called Argali by\r\n  the Mongols. They were somewhat different from those which I\r\n  afterwards saw at Yarkand, which had been brought in from the\r\n  Pamir. Those I found in the Gobi were considerably thicker at the\r\n  base, there was a less degree of curve, and a shorter length of\r\n  horn.” A full description of the _Ovis Poli_, with a large plate\r\n  drawing of the horns, may be seen in Colonel Gordon’s _Roof of the\r\n  World_. (See p. 81.) (_Proc. R. G. S._ X. 1888, p. 495.) Some years\r\n  later, Captain Younghusband speaks repeatedly of the great sport\r\n  of shooting _Ovis Poli_. (_Proc. R. G. S._ XIV. 1892, pp. 205,\r\n  234.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  As to the pasture, Timkowski heard that “the pasturage of Pamir is\r\n  so luxuriant and nutritious, that if horses are left on it for more\r\n  than forty days they die of repletion.” (I. 421.) And Wood: “The\r\n  grass of Pamir, they tell you, is so rich that a sorry horse is\r\n  here brought into good condition in less than twenty days; and its\r\n  nourishing qualities are evidenced in the productiveness of their\r\n  ewes, which almost invariably bring forth two lambs at a birth.”\r\n  (P. 365.)\r\n\r\n  With regard to the effect upon fire ascribed to the “great cold,”\r\n  Ramusio’s version inserts the expression “_gli fu affermato per\r\n  miracolo_,” “it was asserted to him as a wonderful circumstance.”\r\n  And Humboldt thinks it so strange that Marco should not have\r\n  observed this personally that he doubts whether Polo himself passed\r\n  the Pamir. “How is it that he does not say that he himself had seen\r\n  how the flames disperse and leap about, as I myself have so often\r\n  experienced at similar altitudes in the Cordilleras of the Andes,\r\n  especially when investigating the boiling-point of water?” (_Cent.\r\n  Asia_, Germ. Transl. I. 588.) But the words quoted from Ramusio\r\n  do not exist in the old texts, and they are probably an editorial\r\n  interpolation indicating disbelief in the statement.\r\n\r\n  MM. Huc and Gabet made a like observation on the high passes of\r\n  north-eastern Tibet: “The _argols_ gave out much smoke, but would\r\n  not burn with any flame”; only they adopted the native idea that\r\n  this as well as their own sufferings in respiration was caused by\r\n  some pernicious exhalation.\r\n\r\n  Major Montgomerie, R.E., of the Indian Survey, who has probably\r\n  passed more time nearer the heavens than any man living, sends me\r\n  the following note on this passage: “What Marco Polo says as to\r\n  fire at great altitudes not cooking so effectually as usual is\r\n  perfectly correct as far as anything _boiled_ is concerned, but I\r\n  doubt if it is as to anything _roasted_. The want of brightness in\r\n  a fire at great altitudes is, I think, altogether attributable to\r\n  the poorness of the fuel, which consists of either small sticks or\r\n  bits of roots, or of _argols_ of dung, all of which give out a good\r\n  deal of smoke, more especially the latter if not quite dry; but I\r\n  have often seen a capital blaze made with the argols when perfectly\r\n  dry. As to cooking, we found that rice, _dál_, and potatoes would\r\n  never soften properly, no matter how long they were boiled. This,\r\n  of course, was due to the boiling-point being only from 170° to\r\n  180°. Our tea, moreover, suffered from the same cause, and was\r\n  never good when we were over 15,000 feet. This was very marked.\r\n  Some of my natives made dreadful complaints about the rice and dál\r\n  that they got from the village-heads in the valleys, and vowed that\r\n  they only gave them what was very old and hard, as they could not\r\n  soften it!”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Bolor is a subject which it would take several pages to\r\n  discuss with fulness, and I must refer for such fuller discussion\r\n  to a paper in the _J. R. G. S._ vol. xlii. p. 473.\r\n\r\n  The name _Bolor_ is very old, occurring in Hiuen Tsang’s Travels\r\n  (7th century), and in still older Chinese works of like character.\r\n  General Cunningham has told us that Balti is still termed _Balor_\r\n  by the Dards of Gilghit; and Mr. Shaw, that _Palor_ is an old\r\n  name still sometimes used by the Kirghiz for the upper part of\r\n  Chitrál. The indications of Hiuen Tsang are in accordance with\r\n  General Cunningham’s information; and the fact that Chitrál is\r\n  described under the name of Bolor in Chinese works of the last\r\n  century entirely justifies that of Mr. Shaw. A Pushtu poem of the\r\n  17th century, translated by Major Raverty, assigns the mountains of\r\n  _Bilaur_-istán, as the northern boundary of Swát. The collation of\r\n  these indications shows that the term Bolor must have been applied\r\n  somewhat extensively to the high regions adjoining the southern\r\n  margin of Pamir. And a passage in the _Táríkh Rashídí_, written at\r\n  Kashgar in the 16th century by a cousin of the great Baber, affords\r\n  us a definition of the tract to which, in its larger sense, the\r\n  name was thus applied: “_Malaur_ (_i.e._ Balaur or Bolor) ... is a\r\n  country with few level spots. It has a circuit of four months’\r\n  march. The eastern frontier borders on Kashgar and Yarkand; it has\r\n  Badakhshan to the north, Kabul to the west, and Kashmír to the\r\n  south.” The writer was thoroughly acquainted with his subject, and\r\n  the region which he so defines must have embraced Sirikol and all\r\n  the wild country south of Yarkand, Balti, Gilghit, Yasin, Chitrál,\r\n  and perhaps Kafiristán. This enables us to understand Polo’s use of\r\n  the term.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCO POLO’S ITINERARIES Nᵒ. III. Regions on and near\r\n    the Upper Oxus]\r\n\r\n  The name of Bolor in later days has been in a manner a symbol\r\n  of controversy. It is prominent in the apocryphal travels of\r\n  George Ludwig von ————, preserved in the Military Archives at St.\r\n  Petersburg. That work represents a town of Bolor as existing to\r\n  the north of Badakhshan, with Wakhán still further to the north.\r\n  This geography we now know to be entirely erroneous, but it is in\r\n  full accordance with the maps and tables of the Jesuit missionaries\r\n  and their pupils, who accompanied the Chinese troops to Kashgar in\r\n  1758–1759. The paper in the _Geographical Society’s Journal_, which\r\n  has been referred to, demonstrates how these erroneous data must\r\n  have originated. It shows that the Jesuit geography was founded\r\n  on downright accidental error, and, as a consequence, that the\r\n  narratives which profess _de visu_ to corroborate that geography\r\n  must be downright forgeries. When the first edition was printed, I\r\n  retained the belief in a _Bolor_ where the Jesuits placed it.\r\n\r\n  [The Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (_Desc. de la\r\n  Chine occid._ p. 53), speaks of Bolor, to the west of Yarkand,\r\n  inhabited by Mahomedans who live in huts; the country is sandy\r\n  and rather poor. Severtsof says, (_Bul. Soc. Géog._ XI. 1890, p.\r\n  591) that he believes that the name of _Bolor_ should be expunged\r\n  from geographical nomenclature as a source of confusion and error.\r\n  Humboldt, with his great authority, has too definitely attached\r\n  this name to an erroneous orographical system. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  Gordon says that he “made repeated enquiries from Kirghiz and\r\n  Wakhis, and from the Mír [of Wakhán], Fatteh Ali Shah, regarding\r\n  ‘Bólór,’ as a name for any mountain, country, or place, but all\r\n  professed perfect ignorance of it.” (_Forsyth’s Mission._)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The _J. A. S. Bengal_ for 1853 (vol. xxii.) contains extracts from\r\n  the diary of a Mr. Gardiner in those central regions of Asia.\r\n  These read more like the memoranda of a dyspeptic dream than\r\n  anything else, and the only passage I can find illustrative of\r\n  our traveller is the following; the region is described as lying\r\n  twenty days south-west of Kashgar: “The Keiaz tribe live in caves\r\n  on the highest peaks, subsist by hunting, keep no flocks, said to\r\n  be anthropophagous, but have handsome women; eat their flesh raw.”\r\n  (P. 295; _Pèlerins Boud._ III. 316, 421, etc.; _Ladak_, 34, 45, 47;\r\n  _Mag. Asiatique_, I. 92, 96–97; _Not. et Ext._ II. 475, XIV. 492;\r\n  _J. A. S. B._ XXXI. 279; Mr. R. Shaw in _Geog. Proceedings_, XVI.\r\n  246, 400; _Notes regarding Bolor_, etc., _J. R. G.

Indeed,\r\n    this is a striking accident of the course of modern history. We\r\n    see the Slav and the Englishman—representatives of two great\r\n    branches of the Aryan race, but divided by such vast intervals of\r\n    space and time from the original common starting-point of their\r\n    migration—thus brought back to the lap of Pamir to which so many\r\n    quivering lines point as the centre of their earliest seats, there\r\n    by common consent to lay down limits to mutual encroachment.”\r\n    (_Quarterly Review_, April, 1873, p. 548.)\r\n\r\n[2] Ibn Haukal reckons Wakhán as an Indian country. It is a curious\r\n    coincidence (it can scarcely be more) that _Nono_ in the Garo\r\n    tongue of Eastern Bengal signifies “a younger brother.” (_J. A. S.\r\n    B._ XXII. 153, XVIII. 208.)\r\n\r\n[3] According to Colonel Tod, the Hindu bard Chand speaks of “Pamer,\r\n    chief of mountains.” (I. p. 24.)

The\r\ninhabitants live by trade and handicrafts; they have beautiful gardens\r\nand vineyards, and fine estates, and grow a great deal of cotton.\r\nFrom this country many merchants go forth about the world on trading\r\njourneys. The natives are a wretched, niggardly set of people; they eat\r\nand drink in miserable fashion. There are in the country many Nestorian\r\nChristians, who have churches of their own. The people of the country\r\nhave a peculiar language, and the territory extends for five days’\r\njourney.{1}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Kashgar. (From Shaw’s “Tartary.”)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[There is no longer any difficulty in understanding how the\r\n  travellers, after crossing Pamir, should have arrived at Kashgar if\r\n  they followed the route from Táshkurgán through the Gez Defile.\r\n\r\n  The Itinerary of the Mirza from Badakhshan (Fáizabad) is the\r\n  following: Zebák, Ishkashm, on the Panja, which may be considered\r\n  the beginning of the Wakhán Valley, Panja Fort, in Wakhán, Raz\r\n  Khan, Patur, near Lunghar (commencement of Pamir Steppe), Pamir\r\n  Kul, or Barkút Yassin, 13,300 feet, Aktash, Sirikul Táshkurgán,\r\n  Shukrab, Chichik Dawan, Akul, Kotul, Chahul Station (road to\r\n  Yarkand), Kila Karawal, Aghiz Gah, Yangi-Hissar, Opechan, Yanga\r\n  Shahr, Kashgar, where he arrived on the 3rd February, 1869. (Cf.\r\n  _Report of “The Mirza’s” Exploration from Caubul to Kashgar_. By\r\n  Major T. G. Montgomerie, R.E.... (_Jour. R. Geog. Soc._ XLI. 1871,\r\n  pp. 132–192.)\r\n\r\n  Major Montgomerie (_l.c._ p. 144) says: “The alterations in the\r\n  positions of Kashgar and Yarkund in a great measure explains why\r\n  Marco Polo, in crossing from Badakhshan to Eastern Turkestan,\r\n  went first to Kashgar and then to Yarkund. With the old positions\r\n  of Yarkund and Kashgar it appeared that the natural route from\r\n  Badakhshan would have led first to Yarkund; with the new positions,\r\n  and guided by the light of the Mirza’s route, from which it is seen\r\n  that the direct route to Yarkund is not a good one, it is easy to\r\n  understand how a traveller might prefer going to Kashgar first, and\r\n  then to Yarkund. It is satisfactory to have elicited this further\r\n  proof of the general accuracy of the great traveller’s account of\r\n  his journey through Central Asia.”\r\n\r\n  The Itinerary of Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon (_Sirikol, the Pámírs\r\n  and Wakhán_, ch. vi. of _Forsyth’s Mission to Yarkund in_ 1873)\r\n  runs thus: “Left Káshgar (21st March), Yangi-Hissar, Kaskasú Pass,\r\n  descent to Chihil Gumbaz (forty Domes), where the road branches\r\n  off to Yárkand (110 miles), Torut Pass, Tangi-Tár (defile), ‘to\r\n  the foot of a great elevated slope leading to the Chichiklik Pass,\r\n  plain, and lake (14,700 feet), below the Yámbulák and Kok-Moinok\r\n  Passes, which are used later in the season on the road between\r\n  Yangi-Hissar and Sirikol, to avoid the Tangi-Tár and Shindi\r\n  defiles. As the season advances, these passes become free from\r\n  snow, while the defiles are rendered dangerous and difficult by\r\n  the rush of the melting snow torrents. From the Chichiklik plain\r\n  we proceeded down the Shindi ravine, over an extremely bad stony\r\n  road, to the Sirikol River, up the banks of which we travelled\r\n  to Táshkurgán, reaching it on the tenth day from Yangi-Hissar.\r\n  The total distance is 125 miles.’ Then Táshkurgán (ancient name\r\n  _Várshídi_): ‘the open part of the Sirikol Valley extends from\r\n  about 8 miles below Táshkurgán to apparently a very considerable\r\n  distance towards the Kunjút mountain range;’ left Táshkurgán for\r\n  Wákhan (2nd April, 1873); leave Sirikol Valley, enter the Shindán\r\n  defile, reach the Áktásh Valley, follow the Áktásh stream (called\r\n  Áksú by the Kirghiz) through the Little Pamir to the Gházkul\r\n  (Little Pamir) Lake or Barkat Yássín, from which it takes its rise,\r\n  four days from Táshkurgán. Little Pamir ‘is bounded on the south\r\n  by the continuation of the Neza Tásh range, which separates it\r\n  from the Tághdúngbásh Pámir,’ west of the lake, Langar, Sarhadd,\r\n  30 miles from Langar, and seven days from Sirikol, and Kila Panj,\r\n  twelve days from Sirikol.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [I cannot admit with Professor Paquier (_l.c._ pp. 127–128) that\r\n  Marco Polo did not visit Kashgar.—Grenard (II. p. 17) makes the\r\n  remark that it took Marco Polo seventy days from Badakhshan to\r\n  Kashgar, a distance that, in the Plain of Turkestan, he shall\r\n  cross in sixteen days.—The Chinese traveller, translated by M.\r\n  Gueluy (_Desc. de la Chine occidentale_, p. 45), says that the name\r\n  Kashgar is made of _Kash_, fine colour, and _gar_, brick\r\n  house.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Kashgar was the capital, from 1865 to 1877, of Ya’kúb Kúshbegi, a\r\n  soldier of fortune, by descent it is said a Tajik of Shighnan, who,\r\n  when the Chinese yoke was thrown off, made a throne for himself in\r\n  Eastern Turkestan, and subjected the whole basin to his authority,\r\n  taking the title of _Atalik Gházi_.\r\n\r\n  It is not easy to see how Kashgar should have been subject to the\r\n  Great Kaan, except in the sense in which all territories under\r\n  Mongol rule owed him homage. Yarkand, Polo acknowledges to have\r\n  belonged to Kaidu, and the boundary between Kaidu’s territory and\r\n  the Kaan’s lay between Karashahr and Komul [Bk. I. ch. xli.], much\r\n  further east.\r\n\r\n  [Bretschneider, _Med. Res._ (II. p. 47), says: “Marco Polo states\r\n  with respect to the kingdom of _Cascar_ (I. 189) that it was\r\n  subject to the Great Khan, and says the same regarding _Cotan_ (I.\r\n  196), whilst _Yarcan_ (I. 195), according to Marco Polo, belonged\r\n  to Kaidu. This does not agree with Rashid’s statements about the\r\n  boundary between Kaidu’s territory and the Khan’s.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Kashgar was at this time a Metropolitan See of the Nestorian\r\n  Church. (_Cathay_, etc. 275, ccxlv.)\r\n\r\n  Many strange sayings have been unduly ascribed to our traveller,\r\n  but I remember none stranger than this by Colonel Tod: “_Marco Polo\r\n  calls Cashgar, where he was in the 6th century_, the birthplace\r\n  of the Swedes”! (_Rajasthan_, I. 60.) Pétis de la Croix and Tod\r\n  between them are answerable for this nonsense.

(From a sketch by Mr. Ivanoff.)\r\n  “Samarcan est une grandisme cité et noble.”]\r\n\r\nIt is not a great while ago that SIGATAY, own brother to the Great\r\nKaan, who was Lord of this country and of many an one besides, became\r\na Christian.{2} The Christians rejoiced greatly at this, and they\r\nbuilt a great church in the city, in honour of John the Baptist; and\r\nby his name the church was called. And they took a very fine stone\r\nwhich belonged to the Saracens, and placed it as the pedestal of a\r\ncolumn in the middle of the church, supporting the roof. It came to\r\npass, however, that Sigatay died. Now the Saracens were full of rancour\r\nabout that stone that had been theirs, and which had been set up in\r\nthe church of the Christians; and when they saw that the Prince was\r\ndead, they said one to another that now was the time to get back their\r\nstone, by fair means or by foul. And that they might well do, for they\r\nwere ten times as many as the Christians. So they gat together and went\r\nto the church and said that the stone they must and would have. The\r\nChristians acknowledged that it was theirs indeed, but offered to pay\r\na large sum of money and so be quit. Howbeit, the others replied that\r\nthey never would give up the stone for anything in the world. And words\r\nran so high that the Prince heard thereof, and ordered the Christians\r\neither to arrange to satisfy the Saracens, if it might be, with money,\r\nor to give up the stone. And he allowed them three days to do either\r\nthe one thing or the other.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I tell you? Well, the Saracens would on no account agree\r\nto leave the stone where it was, and this out of pure despite to the\r\nChristians, for they knew well enough that if the stone were stirred\r\nthe church would come down by the run. So the Christians were in\r\ngreat trouble and wist not what to do. But they did do the best thing\r\npossible; they besought Jesus Christ that he would consider their case,\r\nso that the holy church should not come to destruction, nor the name of\r\nits Patron Saint, John the Baptist, be tarnished by its ruin. And so\r\nwhen the day fixed by the Prince came round, they went to the church\r\nbetimes in the morning, and lo, they found the stone removed from under\r\nthe column; the foot of the column was without support, and yet it bore\r\nthe load as stoutly as before! Between the foot of the column and the\r\nground there was a space of three palms. So the Saracens had away their\r\nstone, and mighty little joy withal. It was a glorious miracle, nay, it\r\n_is_ so, for the column still so standeth, and will stand as long as\r\nGod pleaseth.{3}\r\n\r\nNow let us quit this and continue our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Of Kaidu, Kúblái Kaan’s kinsman and rival, and their long\r\n  wars, we shall have to speak later. He had at this time a kind\r\n  of joint occupancy of SAMARKAND and Bokhara with the Khans of\r\n  Chagatai, his cousins.\r\n\r\n  [On Samarkand generally see: _Samarqand_, by W. Radloff, translated\r\n  into French by L. Leger, _Rec. d’Itin. dans l’Asie Centrale_, École\r\n  des Langues Orient., Paris, 1878, p. 284 et seq.; _A travers le\r\n  royaume de Tamerlan (Asie Centrale)_ ... par Guillaume Capus ...\r\n  Paris, 1892, 8vo.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Marco evidently never was at Samarkand, though doubtless it was\r\n  visited by his Father and Uncle on their first journey, when we\r\n  know they were long at Bokhara. Having, therefore, little to say\r\n  descriptive of a city he had not seen, he tells us a story:—\r\n\r\n      “So geographers, in Afric maps,\r\n       With savage pictures fill their gaps,\r\n       And o’er unhabitable downs\r\n       Place elephants for want of towns.”\r\n\r\n  As regards the Christians of Samarkand who figure in the preceding\r\n  story, we may note that the city had been one of the Metropolitan\r\n  Sees of the Nestorian Church since the beginning of the 8th\r\n  century, and had been a bishopric perhaps two centuries earlier.\r\n  Prince Sempad, High Constable of Armenia, in a letter written\r\n  from Samarkand in 1246 or 1247, mentions several circumstances\r\n  illustrative of the state of things indicated in this story: “I\r\n  tell you that we have found many Christians scattered all over\r\n  the East, and many fine churches, lofty, ancient, and of good\r\n  architecture, which have been spoiled by the Turks. Hence, the\r\n  Christians of this country came to the presence of the reigning\r\n  Kaan’s grandfather (_i.e._ Chinghiz); he received them most\r\n  honourably, and granted them liberty of worship, and issued orders\r\n  to prevent their having any just cause of complaint by word or\r\n  deed. _And so the Saracens, who used to treat them with contempt,\r\n  have now the like treatment in double measure._”\r\n\r\n  Shortly after Marco’s time, viz. in 1328, Thomas of Mancasola, a\r\n  Dominican, who had come from Samarkand with a Mission to the Pope\r\n  (John XXII.) from Ilchigadai, Khan of Chagatai, was appointed Latin\r\n  Bishop of that city. (_Mosheim_, p. 110, etc.; _Cathay_, p. 192.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—CHAGATAI, here called Sigatay, was Uncle, not Brother, to\r\n  the Great Kaan (Kúblái). Nor was Kaidu either Chagatai’s son or\r\n  Kúblái’s nephew, as Marco here and elsewhere represents him to\r\n  be. (See Bk. IV. ch. i.) The term used to describe Chagatai’s\r\n  relationship is _frère charnel_, which excludes ambiguity,\r\n  cousinship, or the like (such as is expressed by the Italian\r\n  _fratello cugíno_), and corresponds, I believe, to the _brother\r\n  german_ of Scotch law documents.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—One might say, These things be an allegory! We take the\r\n  fine stone that belongs to the Saracens (or Papists) to build our\r\n  church on, but the day of reckoning comes at last, and our (Irish\r\n  Protestant) Christians are afraid that the Church will come about\r\n  their ears. May it stand, and better than that of Samarkand has\r\n  done!\r\n\r\n  There is a story somewhat like this in D’Herbelot, about the\r\n  Karmathian Heretics carrying off the Black Stone from Mecca, and\r\n  being obliged years after to bring it back across the breadth\r\n  of Arabia; on which occasion the stone conducted itself in a\r\n  miraculous manner.\r\n\r\n  There _is_ a remarkable Stone at Samarkand, the _Kok-Tash_ or\r\n  Green Stone, on which Timur’s throne was set. Tradition says that,\r\n  big as it is, it was brought by him from Brusa;—but tradition may\r\n  be wrong. (See _Vámbéry’s Travels_, p. 206.) [Also _H. Moser, A\r\n  travers l’Asie centrale_, 114–115.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [The Archimandrite Palladius (_Chinese Recorder_, VI. p. 108)\r\n  quotes from the _Chi shun Chin-kiang chi_ (Description of\r\n  Chin-Kiang), 14th century, the following passage regarding the\r\n  pillar: “There is a temple (in Samarcand) supported by four\r\n  enormous wooden pillars, each of them 40 feet high. One of these\r\n  pillars is in a hanging position, and stands off from the floor\r\n  more than a foot.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n                      OF THE PROVINCE OF YARCAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYarcan is a province five days’ journey in extent. The people follow\r\nthe Law of Mahommet, but there are also Nestorian and Jacobite\r\nChristians. They are subject to the same Prince that I mentioned, the\r\nGreat Kaan’s nephew. They have plenty of everything, [particularly\r\nof cotton. The inhabitants are also great craftsmen, but a large\r\nproportion of them have swoln legs, and great crops at the throat,\r\nwhich arises from some quality in their drinking-water.] As there is\r\nnothing else worth telling we may pass on.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Yarkan or Yarken seems to be the general pronunciation of\r\n  the name to this day, though we write YARKAND.\r\n\r\n  [A Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (_Desc. de la Chine\r\n  occidentale_, p. 41), says that the word _Yarkand_ is made of\r\n  _Iar_, earth, and _Kiang_ (_Kand?_), large, vast, but this\r\n  derivation is doubtful. The more probable one is that Yarkand is\r\n  made up of _Yar_, new, and _Kand, Kend_, or _Kent_, city.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Mir ’Izzat Ullah in modern days speaks of the prevalence of goitre\r\n  at Yarkand. And Mr. Shaw informs me that during his recent visit to\r\n  Yarkand (1869) he had numerous applications for iodine as a remedy\r\n  for that disease. The theory which connects it with the close\r\n  atmosphere of valleys will not hold at Yarkand. (_J. R. A. S._ VII.\r\n  303.)\r\n\r\n  [Dr. Sven Hedin says that three-fourths of the population of\r\n  Yarkand are suffering from goitre; he ascribes the prevalence of\r\n  the disease to the bad quality of the water, which is kept in large\r\n  basins, used indifferently for bathing, washing, or draining. Only\r\n  Hindu and “Andijdanlik” merchants, who drink well water, are free\r\n  from goitre.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant Roborovsky, the companion of Pievtsov, in 1889, says:\r\n  “In the streets one meets many men and women with large goitres, a\r\n  malady attributed to the bad quality of the water running in the\r\n  town conduits, and drunk by the inhabitants in its natural state.\r\n  It appears in men at the age of puberty, and in women when they\r\n  marry.” (_Proc. R. G. S._ 2 ser. XII. 1890, p. 36.)\r\n\r\n  Formerly the Mirza (_J. R. G. S._ 1871, p. 181) said: “Goitre is\r\n  very common in the city [of Yarkund], and in the country round, but\r\n  it is unknown in Kashgar.”\r\n\r\n  General Pievtsov gives to the small oasis of Yarkand (264 square\r\n  miles) a population of 150,000, that is, 567 inhabitants per square\r\n  mile. He, after Prjevalsky’s death, started, with V. L. Roborovsky\r\n  (botanist) and P. K. Kozlov (zoologist), who were later joined\r\n  by K. I. Bogdanovich (geologist), on his expedition to Tibet\r\n  (1889–1890). He followed the route Yarkand, Khotan, Kiria, Nia, and\r\n  Charchan.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n                      OF A PROVINCE CALLED COTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCotan is a province lying between north-east and east, and is eight\r\ndays’ journey in length. The people are subject to the Great Kaan,{1}\r\nand are all worshippers of Mahommet.{2} There are numerous towns and\r\nvillages in the country, but Cotan, the capital, is the most noble of\r\nall, and gives its name to the kingdom. Everything is to be had there\r\nin plenty, including abundance of cotton, [with flax, hemp, wheat,\r\nwine, and the like]. The people have vineyards and gardens and estates.\r\nThey live by commerce and manufactures, and are no soldiers.{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[The Buddhist Government of Khotan was destroyed by Boghra\r\n  Khân (about 980–990); it was temporarily restored by the Buddhist\r\n  Kutchluk Khân, chief of the Naïmans, who came from the banks of\r\n  the Ili, destroyed the Mahomedan dynasty of Boghra Khân (1209), but\r\n  was in his turn subjugated by Chinghiz Khan.\r\n\r\n  The only Christian monument discovered in Khotan is a bronze cross\r\n  brought back by Grenard (III. pp. 134–135); see also Devéria,\r\n  _Notes d’Epigraphie Mongole_, p. 80.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Aourent Mahommet_”. Though this is Marco’s usual formula\r\n  to define Mahomedans, we can scarcely suppose that he meant it\r\n  literally. But in other cases it was _very_ literally interpreted.\r\n  Thus in _Baudouin de Sebourc_, the Dame de Pontieu, a passionate\r\n  lady who renounces her faith before Saladin, says:—\r\n\r\n      “‘Et je renoië Dieu, et le pooir qu’il a;\r\n       Et Marie, sa Mère, qu’on dist qui le porta;\r\n       _Mahom voel aourer_, aportez-le-moi chà!’\r\n         *  *  *  *   Li Soudans commanda\r\n       _Qu’on aportast Mahom; et celle l’aoura_.” (I. p. 72.)\r\n\r\n  The same romance brings in the story of the Stone of Samarkand,\r\n  adapted from ch. xxxiv., and accounts for its sanctity in Saracen\r\n  eyes because it had long formed a pedestal for Mahound!\r\n\r\n  And this notion gave rise to the use of _Mawmet_ for an idol in\r\n  general; whilst from the _Mahommerie_ or place of Islamite worship\r\n  the name of _mummery_ came to be applied to idolatrous or unmeaning\r\n  rituals; both very unjust etymologies. Thus of mosques in _Richard\r\n  Cœur-de-Lion_:\r\n\r\n      “Kyrkes they made of Crystene Lawe,\r\n       And her _Mawmettes_ lete downe drawe.”    (_Weber_, II. 228.)\r\n\r\n  So Correa calls a golden idol, which was taken by Da Gama in a ship\r\n  of Calicut, “an image of Mahomed” (372). Don Quixote too, who ought\r\n  to have known better, cites with admiration the feat of Rinaldo in\r\n  carrying off, in spite of forty Moors, a golden image of Mahomed.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—800 _li_ (160 miles) east of _Chokiuka_ or Yarkand, Hiuen\r\n  Tsang comes to _Kiustanna_ (Kustána) or KHOTAN. “The country\r\n  chiefly consists of plains covered with stones and sand. The\r\n  remainder, however, is favourable to agriculture, and produces\r\n  everything abundantly. From this country are got woollen carpets,\r\n  fine felts, well woven taffetas, white and black jade.” Chinese\r\n  authors of the 10th century speak of the abundant grapes and\r\n  excellent wine of Khotan.\r\n\r\n  Chinese annals of the 7th and 8th centuries tell us that the people\r\n  of Khotan had chronicles of their own, a glimpse of a lost branch\r\n  of history. Their writing, laws, and literature were modelled upon\r\n  those of India.\r\n\r\n  Ilchi, the modern capital, was visited by Mr. Johnson, of the\r\n  Indian Survey, in 1865. The country, after the revolt against the\r\n  Chinese in 1863, came first under the rule of Habíb-ullah, an aged\r\n  chief calling himself _Khán Bádshah_ of Khotan; and since the\r\n  treacherous seizure and murder of Habíb-ullah by Ya’kub Beg of\r\n  Kashgar in January 1867, it has formed a part of the kingdom of the\r\n  latter.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Johnson says: “The chief grains of the country are Indian corn,\r\n  wheat, barley of two kinds, _bájra, jowár_ (two kinds of _holcus_),\r\n  buckwheat and rice, all of which are superior to the Indian grains,\r\n  and are of a very fine quality.... The country is certainly\r\n  superior to India, and in every respect equal to Kashmir, over\r\n  which it has the advantage of being less humid, and consequently\r\n  better suited to the growth of fruits. _Olives_ (?), pears, apples,\r\n  peaches, apricots, mulberries, grapes, currants, and melons, all\r\n  exceedingly large in size and of a delicious flavour, are produced\r\n  in great variety and abundance.... Cotton of valuable quality, and\r\n  raw silk, are produced in very large quantities.”\r\n\r\n  [Khotan is the chief place of Turkestan for cotton manufactures;\r\n  its _khàm_ is to be found everywhere. This name, which means raw in\r\n  Persian, is given to a stuff made with cotton thread, which has not\r\n  undergone any preparation; they manufacture also two other cotton\r\n  stuffs: _alatcha_ with blue and red stripes, and _tchekmen_, very\r\n  thick and coarse, used to make dresses and sacks; if _khàm_ is\r\n  better at Khotan, _alatcha_ and _tchekmen_ are superior at Kashgar.\r\n  (_Grenard_, II. pp. 191–192.)\r\n\r\n  Grenard (II. pp. 175–177), among the fruits, mentions apricots\r\n  (_ourouk_), ripe in June, and so plentiful that to keep them they\r\n  are dried up to be used like garlic against mountain sickness;\r\n  melons (_koghoun_); water-melons (_tarbouz_, the best are from\r\n  Hami); vine (_tâl_)—the best grapes (_uzum_) come from Boghâz\r\n  langar, near Keria; the best dried grapes are those from Turfan;\r\n  peaches (_shaptâlou_); pomegranates (_anár_, best from Kerghalyk),\r\n  etc.; the best apples are those of Nia and Sadju; pears are very\r\n  bad; cherries and strawberries are unknown. Grenard (II. p. 106)\r\n  also says that grapes are very good, but that Khotan wine is\r\n  detestable, and tastes like vinegar.\r\n\r\n  The Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (_Desc. de la Chine\r\n  occidentale_, p. 45), says that all the inhabitants of Khotan are\r\n  seeking for precious stones, and that melons and fruits are more\r\n  plentiful than at Yarkand.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Mr. Johnson reports the whole country to be rich in soil and very\r\n  much under-peopled. Ilchi, the capital, has a population of about\r\n  40,000, and is a great place for manufactures. The chief articles\r\n  produced are silks, felts, carpets (both silk and woollen), coarse\r\n  cotton cloths, and paper from the mulberry fibre. The people are\r\n  strict Mahomedans, and speak a Turki dialect. Both sexes are\r\n  good-looking, with a slightly Tartar cast of countenance. (_V. et\r\n  V. de H. T._ 278; _Rémusat, H. de la V. de Khotan_, 37, 73–84;\r\n  _Chin. Repos._ IX. 128; _J. R. G. S._ XXXVII. 6 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  [In 1891, Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard at the small village of\r\n  Yotkàn, about 8 miles to the west of the present Khotan, came\r\n  across what they considered the most important and probably the\r\n  most ancient city of southern Chinese Turkestan. The natives say\r\n  that Yotkàn is the site of the old Capital. (Cf. _Grenard_, III. p.\r\n  127 _et seq._ for a description and drawings of coins and objects\r\n  found at this place.)\r\n\r\n  The remains of the ancient capital of Khotan were accidentally\r\n  discovered, some thirty-five years ago, at Yotkàn, a village of\r\n  the Borazân Tract. A great mass of highly interesting finds of\r\n  ancient art pottery, engraved stones, and early Khotan coins with\r\n  Kharoṣṭhi-Chinese legends, coming from this site, have recently\r\n  been thoroughly examined in Dr. Hoernle’s Report on the “British\r\n  Collection of Central Asian Antiquities.” _Stein_.—(See _Three\r\n  further Collections of Ancient Manuscripts from Central Asia_, by\r\n  Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle ... Calcutta, 1897, 8vo.)\r\n\r\n  “The sacred sites of Buddhist Khotan which Hiuen Tsang and\r\n  Fa-hian describe, can be shown to be occupied now, almost without\r\n  exception, by Mohamedan shrines forming the object of popular\r\n  pilgrimages.” (M. A. Stein, _Archæological Work about Khotan,\r\n  Jour. R. As. Soc._, April, 1901, p. 296.)\r\n\r\n  It may be justly said that during the last few years numerous\r\n  traces of Hindu civilisation have been found in Central Asia,\r\n  extending from Khotan, through the Takla-Makan, as far as Turfan,\r\n  and perhaps further up.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Sven Hedin, in the year 1896, during his second journey through\r\n  Takla-Makan from Khotan to Shah Yar, visited the ruins between the\r\n  Khotan Daria and the Kiria Daria, where he found the remains of the\r\n  city of Takla-Makan now buried in the sands. He discovered figures\r\n  of Buddha, a piece of papyrus with unknown characters, vestiges of\r\n  habitations. This Asiatic Pompei, says the traveller, at least ten\r\n  centuries old, is anterior to the Mahomedan invasion led by Kuteïbe\r\n  Ibn-Muslim, which happened at the beginning of the 8th century. Its\r\n  inhabitants were Buddhist, and of Aryan race, probably originating\r\n  from Hindustan.—Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard discovered in the\r\n  Kumâri grottoes, in a small hill on the right bank of the Karakash\r\n  Daria, a manuscript written on birch bark in _K_harosḥ_t_hi\r\n  characters; these grottoes of Kumâri are mentioned in Hiuen Tsang.\r\n  (II. p. 229.)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Sven Hedin followed the route Kashgar, Yangi-Hissar, Yarkand\r\n  to Khotan, in 1895. He made a stay of nine days at Ilchi, the\r\n  population of which he estimated at 5500 inhabitants (5000\r\n  Musulmans, 500 Chinese).\r\n\r\n  (See also Sven Hedin, _Die Geog. wissenschaft.

If\r\nthe husband of any woman go away upon a journey and remain away for\r\nmore than 20 days, as soon as that term is past the woman may marry\r\nanother man, and the husband also may then marry whom he pleases.{3}\r\n\r\nI should tell you that all the provinces that I have been speaking of,\r\nfrom Cascar forward, and those I am going to mention [as far as the\r\ncity of Lop] belong to GREAT TURKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“In old times,” says the _Haft Iklím._, “travellers used\r\n  to go from Khotan to Cathay in 14 (?) days, and found towns and\r\n  villages all along the road [excepting, it may be presumed,\r\n  on the terrible Gobi], so that there was no need to travel in\r\n  caravans. In later days the fear of the Kalmaks caused this line\r\n  to be abandoned, and the circuitous one occupied 100 days.” This\r\n  directer route between Khotan and China must have been followed by\r\n  Fa-hian on his way to India; by Hiuen Tsang on his way back; and\r\n  by Shah Rukh’s ambassadors on their return from China in 1421. The\r\n  circuitous route alluded to appears to have gone north from Khotan,\r\n  crossed the Tarimgol, and fallen into the road along the base of\r\n  the Thian Shan, eventually crossing the Desert southward from Komul.\r\n\r\n  Former commentators differed very widely as to the position of\r\n  Pein, and as to the direction of Polo’s route from Khotan. The\r\n  information acquired of late years leaves the latter no longer open\r\n  to doubt. It must have been nearly coincident with that of Hiuen\r\n  Tsang.\r\n\r\n  The perusal of Johnson’s Report of his journey to Khotan, and the\r\n  Itineraries attached to it, enabled me to feel tolerable certainty\r\n  as to the position of Charchan (see next chapter), and as to the\r\n  fact that Marco followed a direct route from Khotan to the vicinity\r\n  of Lake Lop. Pein, then, was identical with PIMA,[1] which was the\r\n  first city reached by Hiuen Tsang on his return to China after\r\n  quitting Khotan, and which lay 330 _li_ east of the latter city.[2]\r\n  Other notices of Pima appear in Rémusat’s history of Khotan; some\r\n  of these agree exactly as to the distance from the capital, adding\r\n  that it stood on the banks of a river flowing from the East and\r\n  entering the sandy Desert; whilst one account seems to place it\r\n  at 500 _li_ from Khotan. And in the Turkish map of Central Asia,\r\n  printed in the _Jahán Numá_, as we learn from Sir H. Rawlinson,\r\n  the town of _Pím_ is placed a little way north of Khotan. Johnson\r\n  found Khotan rife with stories of former cities overwhelmed by the\r\n  shifting sands of the Desert, and these sands appear to have been\r\n  advancing for ages; for far to the north-east of Pima, even in the\r\n  7th century, were to be found the deserted and ruined cities of the\r\n  ancient kingdoms of _Tuholo_ and _Shemathona_. “Where anciently\r\n  were the seats of flourishing cities and prosperous communities,”\r\n  says a Chinese author speaking of this region, “is nothing now to\r\n  be seen but a vast desert; all has been buried in the sands, and\r\n  the wild camel is hunted on those arid plains.”\r\n\r\n  Pima cannot have been very far from _Kiria_, visited by Johnson.\r\n  This is a town of 7000 houses, lying east of Ilchi, and about 69\r\n  miles distant from it. The road for the most part lies through\r\n  a highly cultivated and irrigated country, flanked by the sandy\r\n  desert at three or four miles to the left. After passing _eastward_\r\n  by Kiria it is said to make a great elbow, turning north; and\r\n  within this elbow lie the sands that have buried cities and fertile\r\n  country. Here Mr. Shaw supposes Pima lay (perhaps upon the river\r\n  of Kiria). At Pima itself, in A.D. 644, there was a story of the\r\n  destruction of a city lying further north, a judgment on the luxury\r\n  and impiety of the people and their king, who, shocked at the\r\n  eccentric aspect of a holy man, had caused him to be buried in sand\r\n  up to the mouth.\r\n\r\n  (_N. et E._ XIV. 477; _H. de la Ville de Khotan_, 63–66; _Klap.\r\n  Tabl. Historiques_, p. 182; _Proc. R. G. S._ XVI. 243.)\r\n\r\n  [Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard took the road from Khotan to\r\n  Charchan; they left Khotan on the 4th May, 1893, passed Kiria,\r\n  Nia, and instead of going direct to Charchan through the desert,\r\n  they passed Kara Say at the foot of the Altyn tâgh, a route three\r\n  days longer than the other, but one which was less warm, and where\r\n  water, meat, milk, and barley could be found. Having passed Kapa,\r\n  they crossed the Karamuren, and went up from Achan due north to\r\n  Charchan, where they stayed three months. Nowhere do they mention\r\n  Pein, or Pima, for it appears to be _Kiria itself_, which is the\r\n  only real town between Khotan and the Lobnor. Grenard says in\r\n  a note (p. 54, vol. ii.): “_Pi-mo_ (Keria) recalls the Tibetan\r\n  _byé-ma_, which is pronounced _Péma_, or _Tchéma_, and which means\r\n  _sand_. Such is perhaps also the origin of _Pialma_, a village\r\n  near Khotan, and of the old name of Charchan, _Tché-mo-to-na_, of\r\n  which the two last syllables would represent _grong_ (pronounce\r\n  _tong_ = town), or _kr’om_ (_t’om_ = bazaar). Now, not only would\r\n  this etymology be justified because these three places are indeed\r\n  surrounded with sand remarkably deep, but as they were the first\r\n  three important places with which the Tibetans met coming into the\r\n  desert of Gobi, either by the route of Gurgutluk and of Polor, or\r\n  by Karakoram and Sandju, or by Tsadam, and they had thus as good a\r\n  pretext to call them ‘towns of sand’ as the Chinese had to give\r\n  to T’un-hwang the name of _Shachau_, viz. City of Sand. Kiria is\r\n  called _Ou-mi_, under the Han, and the name of Pi-mo is found for\r\n  the first time in Hiuen Tsang, that is to say, before the Tibetan\r\n  invasions of the 8th century. It is not possible to admit that the\r\n  incursion of the Tu-ku-hun in the 5th century could be the cause of\r\n  this change of name. The hypothesis remains that Pi-mo was really\r\n  the ancient name forced by the first Tibetan invaders spoken of\r\n  by legend, that _Ou-mi_ was either another name of the town, or a\r\n  fancy name invented by the Chinese, like Yu-t’ien for Khotan, Su-lo\r\n  for Kashgar....” Sir T. D. Forsyth (_J. R. G. S._, XLVII., 1877, p.\r\n  3) writes: “I should say that Peim or Pima must be identical with\r\n  Kiria.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The Jasper and Chalcedony of our author are probably only\r\n  varieties of the semi-precious mineral called by us popularly\r\n  _Jade_, by the Chinese _Yü_, by the Eastern Turks _Kásh_, by the\r\n  Persians _Yashm_, which last is no doubt the same word with ἴασπις,\r\n  and therefore with _Jasper_. The Greek Jaspis was in reality,\r\n  according to Mr. King, a green Chalcedony.\r\n\r\n  The Jade of Turkestan is largely derived from water-rolled boulders\r\n  fished up by divers in the rivers of Khotan, but it is also got\r\n  from mines in the valley of the Karákásh River. “Some of the\r\n  Jade,” says Timkowski, “is as white as snow, some dark green, like\r\n  the most beautiful emerald (?), others yellow, vermilion, and\r\n  jet black. The rarest and most esteemed varieties are the white\r\n  speckled with red and the green veined with gold.” (I. 395.) The\r\n  Jade of Khotan appears to be first mentioned by Chinese authors in\r\n  the time of the Han Dynasty under Wu-ti (B.C. 140–86). In A.D. 541\r\n  an image of Buddha sculptured in Jade was sent as an offering from\r\n  Khotan; and in 632 the process of fishing for the material in the\r\n  rivers of Khotan, as practised down to modern times, is mentioned.\r\n  The importation of Jade or _Yü_ from this quarter probably gave the\r\n  name of _Kia-yü Kwan_ or “Jade Gate” to the fortified Pass looking\r\n  in this direction on the extreme N.W. of China Proper, between\r\n  Shachau and Suhchau. Since the detachment from China the Jade\r\n  industry has ceased, the Musulmans having no taste for that kind of\r\n  _virtù_. (_H. de la V. de Khotan_, 2, 17, 23; also see _J. R. G.\r\n  S._ XXXVI. 165, and _Cathay_, 130, 564; _Ritter_, II. 213; _Shaw’s\r\n  High Tartary_, pp. 98, 473.)\r\n\r\n  [On the 11th January, 1895, Dr. Sven Hedin visited one of the\r\n  chief places where Jade is to be found. It is to the north-east of\r\n  Khotan, in the old bed of the Yurun Kash. The bed of the river is\r\n  divided into _claims_ like gold-fields; the workmen are Chinese for\r\n  the greater part, some few are Musulmans.\r\n\r\n  Grenard (II. pp. 186–187) says that the finest Jade comes from the\r\n  high Karákásh (black Jade) River and Yurungkásh (white Jade); the\r\n  Jade River is called Su-tásh. At Khotan, Jade is polished up by\r\n  sixty or seventy individuals belonging to twenty-five workshops.\r\n\r\n  “At 18 miles from Su-chau, Kia-yu-kwan, celebrated as one of the\r\n  gates of China, and as the fortress guarding the extreme north-west\r\n  entrance into the empire, is passed.” (_Colonel M. S. Bell, Proc.\r\n  R. G. S._ XII. 1890, p. 75.)\r\n\r\n  According to the Chinese characters, the name of Kia-yü Kwan does\r\n  not mean “Jade Gate,” and as Mr. Rockhill writes to me, it can only\r\n  mean something like “barrier of the pleasant Valley.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Possibly this may refer to the custom of temporary\r\n  marriages which seems to prevail in most towns of Central Asia\r\n  which are the halting-places of caravans, and the morals of which\r\n  are much on a par with those of seaport towns, from analogous\r\n  causes. Thus at Meshid, Khanikoff speaks of the large population of\r\n  young and pretty women ready, according to the accommodating rules\r\n  of Shiah Mahomedanism, to engage in marriages which are perfectly\r\n  lawful, for a month, a week, or even twenty-four hours. Kashgar is\r\n  also noted in the East for its _chaukans_, young women with whom\r\n  the traveller may readily form an alliance for the period of his\r\n  stay, be it long or short. (_Khan. Mém._ p. 98; _Russ. in Central\r\n  Asia_, 52; _J. A. S.

Ramusio has _Peym_.\r\n\r\n[2] M. Vivien de St. Martin, in his map of Hiuen Tsang’s travels,\r\n    places Pima to the _west_ of Khotan. Though one sees how the\r\n    mistake originated, there is no real ground for this in either\r\n    of the versions of the Chinese pilgrim’s journey. (See _Vie et\r\n    Voyages_, p. 288, and _Mémoires_, vol. ii. 242–243.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                     OF THE PROVINCE OF CHARCHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharchan is a Province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east\r\nand east. The people worship Mahommet. There are numerous towns and\r\nvillages, and the chief city of the kingdom bears its name, Charchan.\r\nThe Province contains rivers which bring down Jasper and Chalcedony,\r\nand these are carried for sale into Cathay, where they fetch great\r\nprices. The whole of the Province is sandy, and so is the road all the\r\nway from Pein, and much of the water that you find is bitter and bad.\r\nHowever, at some places you do find fresh and sweet water. When an army\r\npasses through the land, the people escape with their wives, children,\r\nand cattle a distance of two or three days’ journey into the sandy\r\nwaste; and knowing the spots where water is to be had, they are able to\r\nlive there, and to keep their cattle alive, whilst it is impossible to\r\ndiscover them; for the wind immediately blows the sand over their track.\r\n\r\nQuitting Charchan, you ride some five days through the sands, finding\r\nnone but bad and bitter water, and then you come to a place where the\r\nwater is sweet. And now I will tell you of a province called Lop, in\r\nwhich there is a city, also called LOP, which you come to at the end of\r\nthose five days. It is at the entrance of the great Desert, and it is\r\nhere that travellers repose before entering on the Desert.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Though the _Lake_ of Lob or Lop appears on all our maps,\r\n  from Chinese authority, the latter does not seem to have supplied\r\n  information as to a town so called. We have, however, indications\r\n  of the existence of such a place, both mediæval and recent. The\r\n  History of Mirza Haidar, called the Táríkh-i-Rashídí, already\r\n  referred to, in describing the Great Basin of Eastern Turkestan,\r\n  says: “Formerly there were several large cities in this plain;\r\n  the names of two have survived—_Lob_ and _Kank_, but of the rest\r\n  there is no trace or tradition; all is buried under the sand.”\r\n  [Forsyth (_J. R. G. S._ XLVII. 1877, p. 5) says that he thinks\r\n  that this Kank is probably the Katak mentioned by Mirza Haidar.—H.\r\n  C.] In another place the same history says that a boy heir of the\r\n  house of Chaghatai, to save him from a usurper, was sent away to\r\n  Sárígh Uighúr and _Lob-Kank_, far in the East. Again, in the short\r\n  notices of the cities of Turkestan which Mr. Wathen collected at\r\n  Bombay from pilgrims of those regions on their way to Mecca, we\r\n  find the following: “_Lopp_.—Lopp is situated at a great distance\r\n  from Yarkand. The inhabitants are principally Chinese; but a few\r\n  Uzbeks reside there. Lopp is remarkable for a salt-water lake in\r\n  its vicinity.” Johnson, speaking of a road from Tibet into Khotan,\r\n  says: “This route ... leads not only to Ilchi and Yarkand, but\r\n  also _viâ_ _Lob_ to the large and important city of Karashahr.”\r\n  And among the routes attached to Mr. Johnson’s original Report, we\r\n  have:—\r\n\r\n  “Route No. VII. _Kiria_ (see note 1 to last chapter) to CHACHAN and\r\n  LOB (_from native information_).”\r\n\r\n  This first revealed to me the continued existence of Marco’s\r\n  Charchan; for it was impossible to doubt that in the CHACHAN and\r\n  LOB of this Itinerary we had his Charchan and Lop; and his route to\r\n  the verge of the Great Desert was thus made clear.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Johnson’s information made the journey from Kiria to Charchan\r\n  to be 9 marches, estimated by him to amount to 154 miles, and\r\n  adding 69 miles from Ilchi to Kiria (which he actually traversed)\r\n  we have 13 marches or 223 miles for the distance from Ilchi to\r\n  Charchan. Mr. Shaw has since obtained a route between Ilchi and Lob\r\n  on very good authority. This makes the distance to Charchan, or\r\n  _Charchand_, as it is called, 22 marches, which Mr. Shaw estimates\r\n  at 293 miles. Both give 6 marches from Charchand to Lob, which is\r\n  in fair accordance with Polo’s 5, and Shaw estimates the whole\r\n  distance from Ilchi to Lob at 373, or by another calculation at\r\n  384 miles, say roundly 380 miles. This higher estimate is to be\r\n  preferred to Mr. Johnson’s for a reason which will appear under\r\n  next chapter.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Shaw’s informant, Rozi of Khotan, who had lived twelve years\r\n  at Charchand, described the latter as a small town with a district\r\n  extending on both sides of a stream which flows to Lob, _and which\r\n  affords Jade_. The people are Musulmans. They grow wheat, Indian\r\n  corn, pears, and apples, etc., but no cotton or rice. It stands in\r\n  a great plain, but the mountains are not far off. The nature of the\r\n  products leads Mr. Shaw to think it must stand a good deal higher\r\n  than Ilchi (4000), perhaps at about 6000 feet. I may observe that\r\n  the Chinese hydrography of the Kashgar Basin, translated by Julien\r\n  in the _N. An. des Voyages_ for 1846 (vol. iii.), seems to imply\r\n  that mountains from the south approach within some 20 miles of the\r\n  Tarim River, between the longitude of Shayar and Lake Lop. The\r\n  people of Lob are Musulman also, but very uncivilised. The Lake is\r\n  salt. The hydrography calls it about 200 _li_ (say 66 miles) from\r\n  E. to W. and half that from N. to S., and expresses the old belief\r\n  that it forms the subterranean source of the Hwang-Ho. Shaw’s\r\n  Itinerary shows “salt pools” at six of the stations between Kiria\r\n  and Charchand, so Marco’s memory in this also was exact.\r\n\r\n  _Nia_, a town two marches from Kiria according to Johnson, or\r\n  four according to Shaw, is probably the ancient city of Ni-jang\r\n  of the ancient Chinese Itineraries, which lay 30 or 40 miles on\r\n  the China side of Pima, in the middle of a great marsh, and formed\r\n  the eastern frontier of Khotan bordering on the Desert. (_J. R. G.\r\n  S._ XXXVII. pp. 13 and 44; also Sir H. Rawlinson in XLII. p. 503;\r\n  _Erskine’s Baber and Humayun_, I. 42; _Proc. R. G. S._ vol. xvi.\r\n  pp. 244–249; _J. A. S. B._ IV. 656; _H. de la V. de Khotan_, u.s.)\r\n\r\n  [The Charchan of Marco Polo seems to have been built to the west\r\n  of the present oasis, a little south of the road to Kiria, where\r\n  ruined houses have been found. It must have been destroyed before\r\n  the 16th century, since Mirza Haidar does not mention it. It was\r\n  not anterior to the 7th century, as it did not exist at the time of\r\n  Hiuen Tsang. (Cf. _Grenard_, III. p. 146.)\r\n\r\n  Grenard says (pp. 183–184) that he examined the remains of what\r\n  is called the old town of Charchan, traces of the ancient canal,\r\n  ruins of dwellings deep into the sand, of which the walls built\r\n  of large and solid-baked bricks, are pretty well preserved. Save\r\n  these bricks, “I found hardly anything, the inhabitants have\r\n  pillaged everything long ago. I attempted some excavating, which\r\n  turned out to be without result, as far as I was concerned; but\r\n  the superstitious natives declared that they were the cause of a\r\n  violent storm which took place soon after. There are similar ruins\r\n  in the environs, at Yantak Koudouk, at Tatrang, one day’s march\r\n  to the north, and at Ouadjchahari at five days to the north-east,\r\n  which corresponds to the position assigned to Lop by Marco Polo.”\r\n  (See _Grenard’s Haute Asie_ on _Nia_.)\r\n\r\n  Palladius is quite mistaken (_l.c._ p. 3) in saying that the\r\n  “Charchan” of Marco Polo is to be found in the present province of\r\n  Karashar. (Cf. _T. W. Kingsmill’s Notes on Marco Polo’s Route from\r\n  Khoten to China_, _Chinese Recorder_, VII. pp. 338–343; _Notes on\r\n  Doctor Sven Hedin’s Discoveries in the Valley of the Tarim, its\r\n  Cities and Peoples_, _China Review_, XXIV. No. II. pp. 59–64.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n               OF THE CITY OF LOP AND THE GREAT DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLop is a large town at the edge of the Desert, which is called the\r\nDesert of Lop, and is situated between east and north-east. It belongs\r\nto the Great Kaan, and the people worship Mahommet. Now, such persons\r\nas propose to cross the Desert take a week’s rest in this town to\r\nrefresh themselves and their cattle; and then they make ready for\r\nthe journey, taking with them a month’s supply for man and beast. On\r\nquitting this city they enter the Desert.\r\n\r\nThe length of this Desert is so great that ’tis said it would take a\r\nyear and more to ride from one end of it to the other. And here, where\r\nits breadth is least, it takes a month to cross it. ’Tis all composed\r\nof hills and valleys of sand, and not a thing to eat is to be found\r\non it. But after riding for a day and a night you find fresh water,\r\nenough mayhap for some 50 or 100 persons with their beasts, but not for\r\nmore. And all across the Desert you will find water in like manner,\r\nthat is to say, in some 28 places altogether you will find good water,\r\nbut in no great quantity; and in four places also you find brackish\r\nwater.{1}\r\n\r\nBeasts there are none; for there is nought for them to eat. But there\r\nis a marvellous thing related of this Desert, which is that when\r\ntravellers are on the move by night, and one of them chances to lag\r\nbehind or to fall asleep or the like, when he tries to gain his company\r\nagain he will hear spirits talking, and will suppose them to be his\r\ncomrades. Sometimes the spirits will call him by name; and thus shall a\r\ntraveller ofttimes be led astray so that he never finds his party. And\r\nin this way many have perished. [Sometimes the stray travellers will\r\nhear as it were the tramp and hum of a great cavalcade of people away\r\nfrom the real line of road, and taking this to be their own company\r\nthey will follow the sound; and when day breaks they find that a cheat\r\nhas been put on them and that they are in an ill plight.{2}] Even\r\nin the day-time one hears those spirits talking. And sometimes you\r\nshall hear the sound of a variety of musical instruments, and still\r\nmore commonly the sound of drums. [Hence in making this journey ’tis\r\ncustomary for travellers to keep close together. All the animals too\r\nhave bells at their necks, so that they cannot easily get astray. And\r\nat sleeping-time a signal is put up to show the direction of the next\r\nmarch.]\r\n\r\nSo thus it is that the Desert is crossed.{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—LOP appears to be the _Napopo_, _i.e._ _Navapa_, of Hiuen\r\n  Tsang, called also the country of _Leulan_, in the Desert. (_Mém._\r\n  II. p. 247.) _Navapa_ looks like Sanskrit. If so, this carries\r\n  ancient Indian influence to the verge of the great Gobi. [See\r\n  _supra_, p. 190.] It is difficult to reconcile with our maps the\r\n  statement of a thirty days’ journey across the Desert from Lop\r\n  to Shachau. Ritter’s extracts, indeed, regarding this Desert,\r\n  show that the constant occurrence of sandhills and deep drifts\r\n  (our traveller’s “hills and valleys of sand”) makes the passage\r\n  extremely difficult for carts and cattle. (III. 375.) But I suspect\r\n  that there is some material error in the longitude of Lake Lop as\r\n  represented in our maps, and that it should be placed _something\r\n  like three degrees_ more to the westward than we find it (_e.g._)\r\n  in Kiepert’s Map of Asia. By that map Khotan is not far short of\r\n  600 miles from the western extremity of Lake Lop. By Johnson’s\r\n  Itinerary (including his own journey to Kiria) it is only 338 miles\r\n  from Ilchi to Lob. Mr. Shaw, as we have seen, gives us a little\r\n  more, but it is only even then 380. Polo unfortunately omits his\r\n  usual estimate for the extent of the “Province of Charchan,” so he\r\n  affords us no complete datum. But his distance between Charchan and\r\n  Lob agrees fairly, as we have seen, with that both of Johnson and\r\n  of Shaw, and the elbow on the road from Kiria to Charchan (_supra_,\r\n  p. 192) necessitates our still further abridging the longitude\r\n  between Khotan and Lop. (See Shaw’s remarks in _Proc. R. G. S._\r\n  XVI. 243.)\r\n\r\n  [This desert was known in China of old by the name of _Lew-sha_,\r\n  _i.e._ “Quicksand,” or literally, “Flowing sands.” (_Palladius,\r\n  Jour. N. China B. R. As. Soc._ N.S. X. 1875, p. 4.)\r\n\r\n  A most interesting problem is connected with the situation of\r\n  Lob-nor which led to some controversy between Baron von Richthofen\r\n  and Prjevalsky. The latter placed the lake one degree more to the\r\n  south than the Chinese did, and found that its water was sweet.\r\n  Richthofen agreed with the Chinese Topographers and wrote in a\r\n  letter to Sir Henry Yule: “I send you two tracings; one of them is\r\n  a true copy of the Chinese map, the other is made from a sketch\r\n  which I constructed to-day, and on which I tried to put down the\r\n  Chinese Topography together with that of Prjevalsky. It appears\r\n  evident—(1) That Prjevalsky travelled by the ancient road to a\r\n  point south of the true Lop-noor; (2) that long before he reached\r\n  this point he found the river courses quite different from what\r\n  they had been formerly; and (3) that following one of the new\r\n  rivers which flows due south by a new road, he reached the two\r\n  sweet-water lakes, one of which answers to the ancient Khas-omo.\r\n  I use the word ‘new’ merely by way of comparison with the state\r\n  of things in Kien-long’s time, when the map was made. It appears\r\n  that the Chinese map shows the Khas Lake too far north to cover the\r\n  Kara-Koshun. The bifurcation of the roads south of the lake nearly\r\n  resembles that which is marked by Prjevalsky.” (Preface of E. D.\r\n  Morgan’s transl. of _From Kulja across the Tian Shan to Lob-nor_,\r\n  by Colonel N. Prjevalsky, London, 1879, p. iv.) In this same volume\r\n  Baron von Richthofen’s remarks are given (pp. 135–159, with a\r\n  map, p. 144), showing comparison between Chinese and Prjevalsky’s\r\n  Geography from tracings by Baron von Richthofen and (pp. 160–165) a\r\n  translation of Prjevalsky’s replies to the Baron’s criticisms.\r\n\r\n  Now the Swedish traveller, Dr. Sven Hedin, claims to have settled\r\n  this knotty point. Going from Korla, south-west of Kara-shahr, by\r\n  a road at the foot of the Kurugh-tagh and between these mountains\r\n  and the Koncheh Daria, he discovered the ruins of two fortresses,\r\n  and a series of milestones (potaïs). These tall pyramids of clay\r\n  and wood, indicating distances in _lis_, show the existence at an\r\n  ancient period of a road with a large traffic between Korla and\r\n  an unknown place to the south-east, probably on the shores of the\r\n  Chinese Lob-nor. Prjevalsky, who passed between the Lower Tarim and\r\n  the Koncheh Daria, could not see a lake or the remains of a lake\r\n  to the east of this river. The Koncheh Daria expands into a marshy\r\n  basin, the Malta Kul, from which it divides into two branches, the\r\n  Kuntiekkich Tarim (East River) and the Ilek (river) to the E.S.E.\r\n  Dr. Sven Hedin, after following the course of the Ilek for three\r\n  days (4th April, 1896) found a large sheet of water in the valley\r\n  at the very place marked by the Chinese Topographers and Richthofen\r\n  for the Lob-nor. This mass of water is divided up by the natives\r\n  into Avullu Kul, Kara Kul, Tayek Kul, and Arka Kul, which are\r\n  actually almost filled up with reeds. Dr. Sven Hedin afterwards\r\n  visited the Lob-nor of Prjevalsky, and reached its western\r\n  extremity, the Kara-buran (black storm) on the 17th April. In 1885,\r\n  Prjevalsky had found the Lob-nor an immense lake; four years later\r\n  Prince Henri d’Orléans saw it greatly reduced in size, and Dr. Sven\r\n  Hedin discovered but pools of water. In the meantime, since 1885,\r\n  the northern (Chinese) Lob-nor has gradually filled up, so the lake\r\n  is somewhat vagrant. Dr. Sven Hedin says that from his observations\r\n  he can assert that Prjevalsky’s lake is of recent formation.\r\n\r\n  So Marco Polo’s Lob-nor should be the northern or Chinese lake.\r\n\r\n  Another proof of this given by Dr. Sven Hedin is that the Chinese\r\n  give the name of Lob to the region between Arghan and Tikkenlik,\r\n  unknown in the country of the southern lake. The existence of two\r\n  lakes shows what a quantity of water from the Thian Shan, the\r\n  Eastern Pamir, and Northern Tibet flows into the basin of the\r\n  Tarim. The Russian Lieutenant K. P. Kozlov has tried since to prove\r\n  that the Chinese Lob-nor is the Kara-Koshun (Black district),\r\n  which is a second lake formed by the Tarim, which discharges\r\n  into and issues from the lake Kara-buran. Kozlov’s arguments are\r\n  published in the _Isvestia_ of the Russian Geographical Society,\r\n  and in a separate pamphlet. _The Geog. Jour._ (June, 1898, pp.\r\n  652–658) contains _The Lob-nor Controversy_, a full statement\r\n  of the case, summarising Kozlov’s pamphlet. Among the documents\r\n  relating to the controversy, Kozlov “quotes passages from the\r\n  Chinese work _Si-yui-shui-dao-tsi_, published in 1823, relative to\r\n  the region, and gives a reduced copy of the Chinese Map published\r\n  by Dr. Georg Wegener in 1863, upon which map Richthofen and Sven\r\n  Hedin based their arguments.” Kozlov’s final conclusions (_Geog.\r\n  Jour._ _l.c._ pp. 657–658) are the following: “The Koncheh-daria,\r\n  since very remote times till the present day, has moved a long way.\r\n  The spot Gherelgan may be taken as a spot of relative permanence\r\n  of its bed, while the basis of its delta is a line traced from the\r\n  farthest northern border of the area of salt clays surrounding the\r\n  Lob-nor to the Tarim. At a later period the Koncheh-daria mostly\r\n  influenced the lower Tarim, and each time a change occurred in the\r\n  latter’s discharge, the Koncheh took a more westward course, to\r\n  the detriment of its old eastern branch (Ilek). Always following\r\n  the gradually receding humidity, the vegetable life changed too,\r\n  while moving sands were taking its place, conquering more and more\r\n  ground for the desert, and marking their conquest by remains of old\r\n  shore-lines....\r\n\r\n  “The facts noticed by Sven Hedin have thus another meaning—the\r\n  desert to the east of the lakes, which he discovered, was formed,\r\n  not by Lob-nor, which is situated 1° southwards, but by the\r\n  Koncheh-daria, in its unremitted deflection to the west. The old\r\n  bed Ilek, lake-shaped in places, and having a belt of salt lagoons\r\n  and swamps along its eastern shores, represents remains of waters\r\n  belonging, not to Lob-nor, but to the shifting river which has\r\n  abandoned this old bed.\r\n\r\n  “These facts and explanations refute the second point of the\r\n  arguments which were brought forward by Sven Hedin in favour of his\r\n  hypothesis, asserting the existence of some other Lob-nor.\r\n\r\n  “I accept the third point of his objections, namely, that the\r\n  grandfathers of the present inhabitants of the Lob-nor lived by\r\n  a lake whose position was more to the north of Lob-nor; that was\r\n  mentioned already by Pievtsov, and the lake was Uchu-Kul.\r\n\r\n  “Why Marco Polo never mentioned the Lob-nor, I leave to more\r\n  competent persons to decide.\r\n\r\n  “The only inference which I can make from the preceding account is\r\n  that the Kara-Koshun-Kul is not only the Lob-nor of my lamented\r\n  teacher, N. M. Prjevalsky, but also _the ancient, the historical,\r\n  and the true Lob-nor_ of the Chinese geographers. So it was during\r\n  the last thousand years, and so will it remain, if ‘the river of\r\n  time’ in its running has not effaced it from the face of the Earth.”\r\n\r\n  To Kozlov’s query: “Why Marco Polo never mentioned the Lob-nor,\r\n  I leave to more competent persons to decide,” I have little\r\n  hesitation in replying that he did not mention the Lob-nor because\r\n  he did not see it. From Charchan, he followed, I believe, neither\r\n  Prjevalsky’s nor Pievtsov’s route, but the old route from Khotan to\r\n  Si-ngan fu, in the old bed of the Charchan daria, above and almost\r\n  parallel to the new bed, to the Tarim,—then between Sven Hedin’s\r\n  and Prjevalsky’s lakes, and across the desert to Shachau to join\r\n  the ancient Chinese road of the Han Dynasty, partly explored by M.\r\n  Bonin from Shachau.\r\n\r\n  There is no doubt as to the discovery of Prjevalsky’s Lob-nor, but\r\n  this does not appear to be the old Chinese Lob-nor; in fact, there\r\n  may have been several lakes co-existent; probably there was one to\r\n  the east of the mass of water described by Dr. Sven Hedin, near\r\n  the old route from Korla to Shachau; there is no fixity in these\r\n  waterspreads and the soil of this part of Asia, and in the course\r\n  of a few years some discrepancies will naturally arise between the\r\n  observations of different travellers. But as I think that Marco\r\n  Polo did not see one of the Lob-nor, but travelled between them,\r\n  there is no necessity to enlarge on this question, fully treated of\r\n  in this note.\r\n\r\n  See besides the works mentioned above: _Nord—Tibet und Lob-nur\r\n  Gebiet_.... herausg. von Dr. G. Wegener. Berlin, 1893. (Sep. abd.\r\n  _Zeit. Ges. f. Erdk._)—_Die Geog. wiss. Ergebnisse meiner Reisen in\r\n  Zentralasien_, 1894–1897, von Dr. Sven Hedin, Gotha, J. Perthes,\r\n  1900.\r\n\r\n  Bonvalot and Prince Henri d’Orléans (_De Paris au Tonkin, à\r\n  travers le Tibet inconnu_, Paris, 1892) followed this Itinerary:\r\n  Semipalatinsk, Kulja, Korla, Lob-nor, Charkalyk, Altyn Tagh,\r\n  almost a straight line to Tengri Nor, then to Batang, Ta Tsien lu,\r\n  Ning-yuan, Yun-nan-fu, Mong-tsŭ, and Tung-King.\r\n\r\n  Bonvalot (28th October, 1889) describes Lob in this manner: “The\r\n  village of Lob is situated at some distance from [the Charchan\r\n  daria]; its inhabitants come to see us; they are miserable,\r\n  hungry, _étiques_; they offer us for sale smoked fish, duck taken\r\n  with _lacet_. Some small presents soon make friends of them.\r\n  They apprize us that news has spread that Pievtsov, the Russian\r\n  traveller, will soon arrive” (_l.c._ p. 75). From Charkalyk, Prince\r\n  Henri d’Orléans and Father Dedeken visited Lob-nor (_l.c._ p.\r\n  77 _et seq._), but it was almost dry; the water had receded since\r\n  Prjevalsky’s visit, thirteen years before. The Prince says the\r\n  Lob-nor he saw was not Prjevalsky’s, nor was the latter’s lake the\r\n  mass of water on Chinese maps; an old sorceress gave confirmation\r\n  of the fact to the travellers. According to a tradition known from\r\n  one generation to another, there was at this place a large inland\r\n  sea without reeds, and the elders had seen in their youth large\r\n  ponds; they say that the earth impregnated with saltpetre absorbs\r\n  the water. The Prince says, according to tradition, _Lob_ is a\r\n  local name meaning “wild animals,” and it was given to the country\r\n  at the time it was crossed by Kalmuk caravans; they added to the\r\n  name _Lob_ the Mongol word _Nor_ (Great Lake). The travellers (p.\r\n  109) note that in fact the name Lob-nor does not apply to a Lake,\r\n  but to the whole marshy part of the country watered by the Tarim,\r\n  from the village of Lob to end of the river.\r\n\r\n  The Pievtsov expedition “visited the Lob-nor (2650 feet) and the\r\n  Tarim, whose proper name is Yarkend-daria (_tarim_ means ‘a tilled\r\n  field’ in Kashgarian). The lake is rapidly drying up, and a very\r\n  old man, 110 years old, whom Pievtsov spoke to (his son, 52 years\r\n  old, was the only one who could understand the old man), said\r\n  that he would not have recognized the land if he had been absent\r\n  all this time. Ninety years ago there was only a narrow strip of\r\n  rushes in the south-west part of the lake, and the Yarkend-daria\r\n  entered it 2½ miles to the west of its present mouth, where now\r\n  stands the village of Abdal. The lake was then much deeper, and\r\n  several villages, now abandoned, stood on its shores. There was\r\n  also much more fish, and otters, which used to live there, but\r\n  have long since disappeared. As to the Yarkend-daria, tradition\r\n  says that two hundred years ago it used to enter another smaller\r\n  lake, Uchukul, which was connected by a channel with the Lob-nor.\r\n  This old bed, named Shirga-chapkan, can still be traced by the\r\n  trees which grew along it. The greater previous extension of the\r\n  Lob-nor is also confirmed by the freshwater molluscs (_Limnaea\r\n  uricularia_, var. _ventricosa_, _L. stagnalis_, _L. peregra_, and\r\n  _Planorbis sibiricus_), which are found at a distance from its\r\n  present banks. Another lake, 400 miles in circumference, Kara-boyön\r\n  (_black isthmus_), lies, as is known, 27 miles to the south-west\r\n  of Lob-nor. To the east of the lake, a salt desert stretches for a\r\n  seven days’ march, and further on begin the Kum-tagh sands, where\r\n  wild camels live.” (_Geog. Jour._ IX. 1897, p. 552.)\r\n\r\n  Grenard (III. pp. 194–195) discusses the Lob-nor question and the\r\n  formation of four new lakes by the Koncheh-daria called by the\r\n  natives beginning at the north; Kara Kul, Tayek Kul, Sugut Kul,\r\n  Tokum Kul. He does not accept Baron v. Richthofen’s theory, and\r\n  believes that the old Lob is the lake seen by Prjevalsky.\r\n\r\n  He says (p. 149): “Lop must be looked for on the actual road from\r\n  Charchan to Charkalyk. Ouash Shahri, five days from Charchan,\r\n  and where small ruins are to be found, corresponds well to the\r\n  position of Lop according to Marco Polo, a few degrees of the\r\n  compass near. But the stream which passes at this spot could\r\n  never be important enough for the wants of a considerable centre\r\n  of habitation and the ruins of Ouash Shahri are more of a hamlet\r\n  than of a town. Moreover, Lop was certainly the meeting point of\r\n  the roads of Kashgar, Urumtsi, Shachau, L’Hasa, and Khotan, and it\r\n  is to this fact that this town, situated in a very poor country,\r\n  owed its relative importance. Now, it is impossible that these\r\n  roads crossed at Ouash Shahri. I believe that Lop was built on the\r\n  site of Charkalyk itself. The Venetian traveller gives five days’\r\n  journey between Charchan and Lop, whilst Charkalyk is really seven\r\n  days from Charchan; but the objection does not appear sufficient to\r\n  me: Marco Polo may well have made a mistake of two days.” (III. pp.\r\n  149–150.)\r\n\r\n  The Chinese Governor of Urumtsi found some years ago to the\r\n  north-west of the Lob-nor, on the banks of the Tarim, and within\r\n  five days of Charkalyk, a town bearing the same name, though not on\r\n  the same site as the Lop of Marco Polo.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“The waste and desert places of the Earth are, so to speak,\r\n  the characters which sin has visibly impressed on the outward\r\n  creation; its signs and symbols there.... Out of a true feeling\r\n  of this, men have ever conceived of the Wilderness as the haunt\r\n  of evil spirits. In the old Persian religion Ahriman and his evil\r\n  Spirits inhabit the steppes and wastes of Turan, to the north of\r\n  the happy Iran, which stands under the dominion of Ormuzd; exactly\r\n  as with the Egyptians, the evil Typhon is the Lord of the Libyan\r\n  sand-wastes, and Osiris of the fertile Egypt.” (_Archbp. Trench,\r\n  Studies in the Gospels_, p. 7.) Terror, and the seeming absence of\r\n  a beneficent Providence, are suggestions of the Desert which must\r\n  have led men to associate it with evil spirits, rather than the\r\n  figure with which this passage begins; no spontaneous conception\r\n  surely, however appropriate as a moral image.\r\n\r\n  “According to the belief of the nations of Central Asia,” says\r\n  I. J. Schmidt, “the earth and its interior, as well as the\r\n  encompassing atmosphere, are filled with Spiritual Beings, which\r\n  exercise an influence, partly beneficent, partly malignant, on\r\n  the whole of organic and inorganic nature.... Especially are\r\n  Deserts and other wild or uninhabited tracts, or regions in\r\n  which the influences of nature are displayed on a gigantic and\r\n  terrible scale, regarded as the chief abode or rendezvous of evil\r\n  Spirits.... And hence the steppes of Turan, and in particular\r\n  the great sandy Desert of Gobi have been looked on as the\r\n  dwelling-place of malignant beings, from days of hoar antiquity.”\r\n\r\n  The Chinese historian Ma Twan-lin informs us that there were two\r\n  roads from China into the Uighúr country (towards Karashahr). The\r\n  longest but easiest road was by Kamul. The other was much shorter,\r\n  and apparently corresponded, as far as Lop, to that described in\r\n  this chapter. “By this you have to cross a plain of sand, extending\r\n  for more than 100 leagues. You see nothing in any direction but\r\n  the sky and the sands, without the slightest trace of a road; and\r\n  travellers find nothing to guide them but the bones of men and\r\n  beasts and the droppings of camels. During the passage of this\r\n  wilderness you hear sounds, sometimes of singing, sometimes of\r\n  wailing; and it has often happened that travellers going aside to\r\n  see what those sounds might be have strayed from their course and\r\n  been entirely lost; for they were voices of spirits and goblins.\r\n  ’Tis for these reasons that travellers and merchants often prefer\r\n  the much longer route by Kamul.” (_Visdelou_, p. 139.)\r\n\r\n  “In the Desert” (this same desert), says Fa-hian, “there are a\r\n  great many evil demons; there are also sirocco winds, which kill\r\n  all who encounter them. There are no birds or beasts to be seen;\r\n  but so far as the eye can reach, the route is marked out by the\r\n  bleached bones of men who have perished in the attempt to cross.”\r\n\r\n  [“The Lew-sha was the subject of various most exaggerated stories.\r\n  We find more trustworthy accounts of it in the _Chow shu_; thus it\r\n  is mentioned in that history, that there sometimes arises in this\r\n  desert a ‘burning wind,’ pernicious to men and cattle; in such\r\n  cases the old camels of the caravan, having a presentiment of its\r\n  approach, flock shrieking to one place, lie down on the ground and\r\n  hide their heads in the sand. On this signal, the travellers also\r\n  lie down, close nose and mouth, and remain in this position until\r\n  the hurricane abates. Unless these precautions are taken, men and\r\n  beasts inevitably perish.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 4.)\r\n\r\n  A friend writes to me that he thinks that the accounts of strange\r\n  noises in the desert would find a remarkable corroboration in the\r\n  narratives of travellers through the central desert of Australia.\r\n  They conjecture that they are caused by the sudden falling of\r\n  cliffs of sand as the temperature changes at night time.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Hiuen Tsang, in his passage of the Desert, both outward and\r\n  homeward, speaks of visual illusions; such as visions of troops\r\n  marching and halting with gleaming arms and waving banners,\r\n  constantly shifting, vanishing, and reappearing, “imagery created\r\n  by demons.” A voice behind him calls, “Fear not! fear not!”\r\n  Troubled by these fantasies on one occasion, he prays to Kwan-yin\r\n  (a Buddhist divinity); still he could not entirely get rid of them;\r\n  but as soon as he had pronounced a few words from the _Prajna_ (a\r\n  holy book), they vanished in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\n  These Goblins are not peculiar to the Gobi, though that appears\r\n  to be their most favoured haunt. The awe of the vast and solitary\r\n  Desert raises them in all similar localities. Pliny speaks of the\r\n  phantoms that appear and vanish in the deserts of Africa; Aethicus,\r\n  the early Christian cosmographer, speaks, though incredulous, of\r\n  the stories that were told of the voices of singers and revellers\r\n  in the desert; Mas’udi tells of the _Ghúls_, which in the deserts\r\n  appear to travellers by night and in lonely hours; the traveller,\r\n  taking them for comrades, follows and is led astray. But the wise\r\n  revile them and the Ghúls vanish. Thus also Apollonius of Tyana\r\n  and his companions, in a desert near the Indus by moonlight, see\r\n  an _Empusa_ or Ghúl taking many forms. They revile it, and it goes\r\n  off uttering shrill cries. Mas’udi also speaks of the mysterious\r\n  voices heard by lone wayfarers in the Desert, and he gives a\r\n  rational explanation of them. Ibn Batuta relates a like legend of\r\n  the Western Sahara: “If the messenger be solitary, the demons sport\r\n  with him and fascinate him, so that he strays from his course and\r\n  perishes.” The Afghan and Persian wildernesses also have their\r\n  _Ghúl-i-Beában_ or Goblin of the Waste, a gigantic and fearful\r\n  spectre which devours travellers; and even the Gael of the West\r\n  Highlands have the _Direach Ghlinn Eitidh_, the Desert Creature\r\n  of Glen Eiti, which, one-handed, one-eyed, one-legged, seems\r\n  exactly to answer to the Arabian Nesnás or _Empusa_. Nicolò Conti\r\n  in the Chaldaean desert is aroused at midnight by a great noise,\r\n  and sees a vast multitude pass by. The merchants tell him that\r\n  these are demons who are in the habit of traversing the deserts.\r\n  (_Schmidt’s San. Setzen_, p. 352; _V. et V. de H.

[See _supra_.] A\r\n  very striking account of a phenomenon of this kind regarded as\r\n  supernatural is given by Friar Odoric, whose experience I fancy I\r\n  have traced to the _Reg Ruwán_ or “Flowing Sand” north of Kabul.\r\n  Besides this celebrated example, which has been described also by\r\n  the Emperor Baber, I have noted that equally well-known one of the\r\n  _Jibal Naḳús_, or “Hill of the Bell,” in the Sinai Desert; Wadi\r\n  Hamade, in the vicinity of the same Desert; the _Jibal-ul-Thabúl_,\r\n  or “Hill of the Drums,” between Medina and Mecca; one on the\r\n  Island of Eigg, in the Hebrides, discovered by Hugh Miller; one\r\n  among the Medanos or Sandhills of Arequipa, described to me by Mr.\r\n  C. Markham; the Bramador or rumbling mountain of Tarapaca; one\r\n  in hills between the Ulba and the Irtish, in the vicinity of the\r\n  Altai, called the Almanac Hills, because the sounds are supposed\r\n  to prognosticate weather-changes; and a remarkable example near\r\n  Kolberg on the shore of Pomerania. A Chinese narrative of the 10th\r\n  century mentions the phenomenon as known near Kwachau, on the\r\n  eastern border of the Lop Desert, under the name of the “Singing\r\n  Sands”; and Sir F. Goldsmid has recently made us acquainted with\r\n  a second _Reg Ruwán_, on a hill near the Perso-Afghan frontier,\r\n  a little to the north of Sístán. The place is frequented in\r\n  pilgrimage. (See _Cathay_, pp. ccxliv. 156, 398; _Ritter_, II. 204;\r\n  _Aus der Natur_, Leipzig, No. 47 [of 1868], p. 752; _Rémusat, H. de\r\n  Khotan_, p. 74; _Proc. R. G. S._ XVII. 91.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—[We learn from Joseph Martin, quoted by Grenard, p. 170\r\n  (who met this unfortunate French traveller at Khotan, on his way\r\n  from Peking to Marghelan, where he died), that from Shachau to\r\n  Abdal, on the Lob-nor, there are twelve days of desert, sandy\r\n  only during the first two days, stony afterwards. Occasionally a\r\n  little grass is to be found for the camels; water is to be found\r\n  everywhere. M. Bonin went from Shachau to the north-west towards\r\n  the Kara-nor, then to the west, but lack of water compelled him to\r\n  go back to Shachau. Along this road, every five _lis_, are to be\r\n  found towers built with clay, and about 30 feet high, abandoned by\r\n  the Chinese, who do not seem to have kept a remembrance of them\r\n  in the country; this route seems to be a continuation of the Kan\r\n  Suh Imperial highway. A wall now destroyed connected these towers\r\n  together. “There is no doubt,” writes M. Bonin, “that all these\r\n  remains are those of the great route, vainly sought after till now,\r\n  which, under the Han Dynasty, ran to China through Bactria, Pamir,\r\n  Eastern Turkestan, the Desert of Gobi, and Kan Suh: it is in part\r\n  the route followed by Marco Polo, when he went from Charchan to\r\n  Shachau, by the city of Lob.” The route of the Han has been also\r\n  looked for, more to the south, and it was believed that it was\r\n  the same as that of the Astyn Tagh, followed by Mr. Littledale in\r\n  1893, who travelled one month from Abdal (Lob-nor) to Shachau; M.\r\n  Bonin, who explored also this route, and was twenty-three days from\r\n  Shachau to Lob-nor, says it could not be a commercial road. Dr.\r\n  Sven Hedin saw four or five towers eastward of the junction of the\r\n  Tarim and the Koncheh-daria; it may possibly have been another part\r\n  of the road seen by M. Bonin.

The Idolaters\r\nhave a peculiar language, and are no traders, but live by their\r\nagriculture.{2} They have a great many abbeys and minsters full of\r\nidols of sundry fashions, to which they pay great honour and reverence,\r\nworshipping them and sacrificing to them with much ado. For example,\r\nsuch as have children will feed up a sheep in honour of the idol, and\r\nat the New Year, or on the day of the Idol’s Feast, they will take\r\ntheir children and the sheep along with them into the presence of the\r\nidol with great ceremony. Then they will have the sheep slaughtered\r\nand cooked, and again present it before the idol with like reverence,\r\nand leave it there before him, whilst they are reciting the offices\r\nof their worship and their prayers for the idol’s blessing on their\r\nchildren. And, if you will believe them, the idol feeds on the meat\r\nthat is set before it! After these ceremonies they take up the flesh\r\nand carry it home, and call together all their kindred to eat it with\r\nthem in great festivity [the idol-priests receiving for their portion\r\nthe head, feet, entrails, and skin, with some part of the meat]. After\r\nthey have eaten, they collect the bones that are left and store them\r\ncarefully in a hutch.{3}\r\n\r\nAnd you must know that all the Idolaters in the world burn their dead.\r\nAnd when they are going to carry a body to the burning, the kinsfolk\r\nbuild a wooden house on the way to the spot, and drape it with cloths\r\nof silk and gold. When the body is going past this building they call\r\na halt and set before it wine and meat and other eatables; and this\r\nthey do with the assurance that the defunct will be received with the\r\nlike attentions in the other world. All the minstrelsy in the town goes\r\nplaying before the body; and when it reaches the burning-place the\r\nkinsfolk are prepared with figures cut out of parchment and paper in\r\nthe shape of men and horses and camels, and also with round pieces of\r\npaper like gold coins, and all these they burn along with the corpse.\r\nFor they say that in the other world the defunct will be provided with\r\nslaves and cattle and money, just in proportion to the amount of such\r\npieces of paper that has been burnt along with him.{4}\r\n\r\nBut they never burn their dead until they have [sent for the\r\nastrologers, and told them the year, the day, and the hour of the\r\ndeceased person’s birth, and when the astrologers have ascertained\r\nunder what constellation, planet, and sign he was born, they declare\r\nthe day on which, by the rules of their art, he ought to be burnt].\r\nAnd till that day arrive they keep the body, so that ’tis sometimes a\r\nmatter of six months, more or less, before it comes to be burnt.{5}\r\n\r\nNow the way they keep the body in the house is this: They make a\r\ncoffin first of a good span in thickness, very carefully joined and\r\ndaintily painted. This they fill up with camphor and spices, to keep\r\noff corruption [stopping the joints with pitch and lime], and then they\r\ncover it with a fine cloth. Every day as long as the body is kept, they\r\nset a table before the dead covered with food; and they will have it\r\nthat the soul comes and eats and drinks: wherefore they leave the food\r\nthere as long as would be necessary in order that one should partake.\r\nThus they do daily. And worse still! Sometimes those soothsayers shall\r\ntell them that ’tis not good luck to carry out the corpse by the door,\r\nso they have to break a hole in the wall, and to draw it out that way\r\nwhen it is taken to the burning.{6} And these, I assure you, are the\r\npractices of all the Idolaters of those countries.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will quit this subject, and I will tell you of another city\r\nwhich lies towards the north-west at the extremity of the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[The Natives of this country were called by the Chinese\r\n  _T’ang-hiang_, and by the Mongols _T’angu_ or _T’ang-wu_, and with\r\n  the plural suffix _Tangut_. The kingdom of Tangut, or in Chinese,\r\n  _Si Hia_ (Western Hia), or _Ho si_ (West of the Yellow River), was\r\n  declared independent in 982 by Li Chi Ch’ien, who had the dynastic\r\n  title or _Miao Hao_ of Tai Tsu. “The rulers of Tangut,” says Dr.\r\n  Bushell, “were scions of the Toba race, who reigned over North\r\n  China as the Wei Dynasty (A.D. 386–557), as well as in some of\r\n  the minor dynasties which succeeded. Claiming descent from the\r\n  ancient Chinese Hsia Dynasty of the second millennium B.C., they\r\n  adopted the title of _Ta Hsia_ (‘Great Hsia’), and the dynasty is\r\n  generally called by the Chinese Hsi Hsia, or Western Hsia.” This is\r\n  a list of the Tangut sovereigns, with the date of their accession\r\n  to the throne: Tai Tsu (982), Tai Tsung (1002), Ching Tsung (1032),\r\n  Yi Tsung (1049), Hui Tsung (1068), Ch’ung Tsung (1087), Jen Tsung\r\n  (1140), Huan Tsung (1194), Hsiang Tsung (1206), Shên Tsung (1213),\r\n  Hien Tsung (1223), Mo Chu (1227). In fact, the real founder of\r\n  the Dynasty was Li Yuan-hao, who conquered in 1031, the cities\r\n  of Kanchau and Suhchau from the Uighúr Turks, declaring himself\r\n  independent in 1032, and who adopted in 1036 a special script of\r\n  which we spoke when mentioning the archway at Kiuyung Kwan. His\r\n  capital was Hia chau, now Ning hia, on the Yellow River. Chinghiz\r\n  invaded Tangut three times, in 1206, 1217, and at last in 1225;\r\n  the final struggle took place the following year, when Kanchau,\r\n  Liangchau, and Suhchau fell into the hands of the Mongols. After\r\n  the death of Chinghiz (1227), the last ruler of Tangut, Li H’ien,\r\n  who surrendered the same year to Okkodaï, son of the conqueror,\r\n  was killed. The dominions of Tangut in the middle of the 11th\r\n  century, according to the _Si Hia Chi Shih Pên Mo_, quoted by Dr.\r\n  Bushell, “were bounded, according to the map, by the Sung Empire\r\n  on the south and east, by the Liao (Khitan) on the north-east, the\r\n  Tartars (Tata) on the north, the Uighúr Turks (Hui-hu) on the west,\r\n  and the Tibetans on the south-west. The Alashan Mountains stretch\r\n  along the northern frontier, and the western extends to the Jade\r\n  Gate (Yü Mên Kwan) on the border of the Desert of Gobi.” Under the\r\n  Mongol Dynasty, Kan Suh was the official name of one of the twelve\r\n  provinces of the Empire, and the popular name was Tangut.\r\n\r\n  (Dr. S. W. Bushell: _Inscriptions in the Juchen and Allied Scripts_\r\n  and _The Hsi Hsia Dynasty of Tangut_. See above, p. 29.)\r\n\r\n  “The word Tangutan applied by the Chinese and by Colonel Prjevalsky\r\n  to a Tibetan-speaking people around the Koko-nor has been explained\r\n  to me in a variety of ways by native Tangutans. A very learned lama\r\n  from the Gserdkog monastery, south-east of the Koko-nor, told me\r\n  that Tangutan, Amdoans, and Sifan were interchangeable terms, but I\r\n  fear his geographical knowledge was a little vague. The following\r\n  explanation of the term Tangut is taken from the _Hsi-tsang-fu_.\r\n  ‘The Tangutans are descendants of the _Tang-tu-chüeh_. The origin\r\n  of this name is as follows: In early days, the Tangutans lived in\r\n  the Central Asian Chin-shan, where they were workers of iron. They\r\n  made a model of the Chin-shan, which, in shape, resembled an iron\r\n  helmet. Now, in their language, “iron helmet” is _Tang-küeh_, hence\r\n  the name of the country. To the present day, the Tangutans of the\r\n  Koko-nor wear a hat shaped like a pot, high crowned and narrow,\r\n  rimmed with red fringe sewn on it, so that it looks like an iron\r\n  helmet, and this is a proof of [the accuracy of the derivation].’\r\n  Although the proof is not very satisfactory, it is as good as we\r\n  are often offered by authors with greater pretension to learning.\r\n\r\n  “If I remember rightly, Prjevalsky derives the name from two words\r\n  meaning ‘black tents.’” (_W. W. Rockhill, China Br. R. As. Soc._,\r\n  XX. pp. 278–279.)\r\n\r\n  “Chinese authorities tell us that the name [Tangut] was originally\r\n  borne by a people living in the Altaï, and that the word is\r\n  Turkish.... The population of Tangut was a mixture of Tibetans,\r\n  Turks, Uighúrs, Tukuhuns, Chinese, etc.” (_Rockhill_, _Rubruck_, p.\r\n  150, note.—H. C.)]\r\n\r\n  _Sachiu_ is SHACHAU, “Sand-district,” an outpost of China Proper,\r\n  at the eastern verge of the worst part of the Sandy Desert. It is\r\n  recorded to have been fortified in the 1st century as a barrier\r\n  against the Hiongnu.\r\n\r\n  [The name of Shachau dates from A.D. 622, when it was founded by\r\n  the first emperor of the T’ang Dynasty. Formerly, Shachau was one\r\n  of the Chinese colonies established by the Han, at the expense of\r\n  the Hiongnu; it was called T’ung hoang (B.C. 111), a name still\r\n  given to Shachau; the other colonies were Kiu-kaan (Suhchau, B.C.\r\n  121) and Chang-yé (Kanchau, B.C. 111). (See _Bretschneider, Med.\r\n  Res._ II. 18.)\r\n\r\n  “Sha-chow, the present _Tun-hwang-hien_ (a few _li_ east of the\r\n  ancient town).... In 1820, or about that time, an attempt was made\r\n  to re-establish the ancient direct way between Sha-chow and Khotan.\r\n  With this object in view, an exploring party of ten men was sent\r\n  from Khotan towards Sha-chow; this party wandered in the desert\r\n  over a month, and found neither dwellings nor roads, but pastures\r\n  and water everywhere. M. Polo omits to mention a remarkable place\r\n  at Sha-chow, a sandy hillock (a short distance south of this town)\r\n  known under the name of _Ming-sha shan_—the ‘rumbling sandhill.’\r\n  The sand, in rolling down the hill, produces a particular sound,\r\n  similar to that of distant thunder. In M. Polo’s time (1292),\r\n  Khubilaï removed the inhabitants of Sha-chow to the interior of\r\n  China; fearing, probably, the aggression of the seditious princes;\r\n  and his successor, in 1303, placed there a garrison of ten thousand\r\n  men.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 5.)\r\n\r\n  “Sha-chau is one of the best oases of Central Asia. It is situated\r\n  at the foot of the Nan-shan range, at a height of 3700 feet above\r\n  the sea, and occupies an area of about 200 square miles, the whole\r\n  of which is thickly inhabited by Chinese. Sha-chau is interesting\r\n  as the meeting-place of three expeditions started independently\r\n  from Russia, India, and China. Just two months before Prjevalsky\r\n  reached this town, it was visited by Count Szechényi [April, 1879],\r\n  and eighteen months afterwards Pundit A-k, whose report of it\r\n  agrees fairly well with that of our traveller, also stayed here.\r\n  Both Prejevalsky and Szechényi remark on some curious caves in a\r\n  valley near Sha-chau containing Buddhistic clay idols.[1] These\r\n  caves were in Marco Polo’s time the resort of numerous worshippers,\r\n  and are said to date back to the Han Dynasty.” (_Prejevalsky’s\r\n  Journeys_ ... by E. Delmar Morgan, _Proc. R. G. S._ IX. 1887, pp.\r\n  217–218.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  (_Ritter_, II. 205; _Neumann_, p. 616; _Cathay_, 269, 274;\r\n  _Erdmann_, 155; _Erman_, II. 267; _Mag. Asiat._ II. 213.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—By _Idolaters_, Polo here means Buddhists, as generally.\r\n  We do not know whether the Buddhism here was a recent introduction\r\n  from Tibet, or a relic of the old Buddhism of Khotan and other\r\n  Central Asian kingdoms, but most probably it was the former, and\r\n  the “peculiar language” ascribed to them may have been, as Neumann\r\n  supposes, Tibetan. This language in modern Mongolia answers to the\r\n  Latin of the Mass Book, indeed with a curious exactness, for in\r\n  both cases the holy tongue is not that of the original propagators\r\n  of the respective religions, but that of the hierarchy which has\r\n  assumed their government. In the Lamaitic convents of China and\r\n  Manchuria also the Tibetan only is used in worship, except at one\r\n  privileged temple at Peking. (_Koeppen_, II. 288.) The language\r\n  intended by Polo may, however, have been a Chinese dialect. (See\r\n  notes 1 and 4.) The Nestorians must have been tolerably numerous in\r\n  Tangut, for it formed a metropolitan province of their Church.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—A practice resembling this is mentioned by Pallas as\r\n  existing among the Buddhist Kalmaks, a relic of their old Shaman\r\n  superstitions, which the Lamas profess to decry, but sometimes\r\n  take part in. “Rich Kalmaks select from their flock a ram for\r\n  dedication, which gets the name of _Tengri Tockho_, ‘Heaven’s Ram.’\r\n  It must be a white one with a yellow head. He must never be shorn\r\n  or sold, but when he gets old, and the owner chooses to dedicate\r\n  a fresh one, then the old one must be sacrificed. This is usually\r\n  done in autumn, when the sheep are fattest, and the neighbours are\r\n  called together to eat the sacrifice. A fortunate day is selected,\r\n  and the ram is slaughtered amid the cries of the sorcerer directed\r\n  towards the sunrise, and the diligent sprinkling of milk for the\r\n  benefit of the Spirits of the Air. The flesh is eaten, but the\r\n  skeleton with a part of the fat is burnt on a turf altar erected on\r\n  four pillars of an ell and a half high, and the skin, with the head\r\n  and feet, is then hung up in the way practised by the Buraets.”\r\n  (_Sammlungen_, II. 346.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Several of the customs of Tangut mentioned in this chapter\r\n  are essentially Chinese, and are perhaps introduced here because\r\n  it was on entering Tangut that the traveller first came in contact\r\n  with Chinese peculiarities. This is true of the manner of forming\r\n  coffins, and keeping them with the body in the house, serving food\r\n  before the coffin whilst it is so kept, the burning of paper\r\n  and papier-maché figures of slaves, horses, etc., at the tomb.\r\n  Chinese settlers were very numerous at Shachau and the neighbouring\r\n  Kwachau, even in the 10th century. (_Ritter_, II. 213.) [“Keeping\r\n  a body unburied for a considerable time is called _khǹg koan_,\r\n  ‘to conceal or store away a coffin,’ or _thîng koan_, ‘to detain\r\n  a coffin.’ It is, of course, a matter of necessity in such cases\r\n  to have the cracks and fissures, and especially the seam where\r\n  the case and the lid join, hermetically caulked. This is done by\r\n  means of a mixture of chunam and oil. The seams, sometimes even the\r\n  whole coffin, are pasted over with linen, and finally everything is\r\n  varnished black, or, in case of a mandarin of rank, red. In process\r\n  of time, the varnishing is repeated as many times as the family\r\n  think desirable or necessary. And in order to protect the coffin\r\n  still better against dust and moisture, it is generally covered\r\n  with sheets of oiled paper, over which comes a white pall.” (_De\r\n  Groot_, I. 106.)—H. C.] Even as regards the South of China many\r\n  of the circumstances mentioned here are strictly applicable, as\r\n  may be seen in _Doolittle’s Social Life of the Chinese_. (See, for\r\n  example, p. 135; also _Astley_, IV. 93–95, or Marsden’s quotations\r\n  from _Duhalde_.) The custom of burning the dead has been for\r\n  several centuries disused in China, but we shall see hereafter that\r\n  Polo represents it as general in his time. On the custom of burning\r\n  gilt paper in the form of gold coin, as well as of paper clothing,\r\n  paper houses, furniture, slaves, etc., see also _Medhurst_, p.\r\n  213, and _Kidd_, 177–178. No one who has read Père Huc will forget\r\n  his ludicrous account of the Lama’s charitable distribution of\r\n  paper horses for the good of disabled travellers. The manufacture\r\n  of mock money is a large business in Chinese cities. In Fuchau\r\n  there are more than thirty large establishments where it is kept\r\n  for sale. (_Doolittle_, 541.) [The Chinese believe that sheets\r\n  of paper, partly tinned over on one side, are, “according to the\r\n  prevailing conviction, turned by the process of fire into real\r\n  silver currency available in the world of darkness, and sent there\r\n  through the smoke to the soul; they are called _gûn-tsoá_, ‘silver\r\n  paper.’ Most families prefer to previously fold every sheet in\r\n  the shape of a hollow ingot, a ‘silver ingot,’ _gûn-khò_, as they\r\n  call it. This requires a great amount of labour and time, but\r\n  increases the value of the treasure immensely.” (_De Groot_, I.\r\n  25.) “Presenting paper money when paying a visit of condolence\r\n  is a custom firmly established, and accordingly complied with by\r\n  everybody with great strictness.... The paper is designed for\r\n  the equipment of the coffin, and, accordingly, always denoted by\r\n  the term _koan-thaô-tsoá_, ‘coffin paper.’ But as the receptacle\r\n  of the dead is, of course, not spacious enough to hold the whole\r\n  mass offered by so many friends, it is regularly burned by lots by\r\n  the side of the corpse, the ashes being carefully collected to be\r\n  afterwards wrapped in paper and placed in the coffin, or at the\r\n  side of the coffin, in the tomb.” (_De Groot_, I. 31–32.)—H. C.]\r\n  There can be little doubt that these latter customs are symbols of\r\n  the ancient sacrifices of human beings and valuable property on\r\n  such occasions; so Manetho states that the Egyptians in days of\r\n  yore used human sacrifices, but a certain King Amosis abolished\r\n  them and substituted images of wax. Even when the present Manchu\r\n  Dynasty first occupied the throne of China, they still retained\r\n  the practice of human sacrifice. At the death of Kanghi’s mother,\r\n  however, in 1718, when four young girls offered themselves for\r\n  sacrifice on the tomb of their mistress, the emperor would not\r\n  allow it, and prohibited for the future the sacrifice of life or\r\n  the destruction of valuables on such occasions. (_Deguignes, Voy._\r\n  I. 304.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Even among the Tibetans and Mongols burning is only one\r\n  of the modes of disposing of the dead. “They sometimes bury their\r\n  dead: often they leave them exposed in their coffins, or cover them\r\n  with stones, paying regard to the sign under which the deceased\r\n  was born, his age, the day and hour of his death, which determine\r\n  the mode in which he is to be interred (or otherwise disposed\r\n  of). For this purpose they consult some books which are explained\r\n  to them by the Lamas.” (_Timk._ II. 312.) The extraordinary and\r\n  complex absurdities of the books in question are given in detail by\r\n  Pallas, and curiously illustrate the paragraph in the text. (See\r\n  _Sammlungen_, II. 254 _seqq._) [“The first seven days, including\r\n  that on which the demise has taken place, are generally deemed to\r\n  be lucky for the burial, especially the odd ones. But when they\r\n  have elapsed, it becomes requisite to apply to a day-professor....\r\n  The popular almanac which chiefly wields sway in Amoy and the\r\n  surrounding country, regularly stigmatises a certain number of\r\n  days as _tîng-sng jít_: ‘days of reduplication of death,’ because\r\n  encoffining or burying a dead person on such a day will entail\r\n  another loss in the family shortly afterwards.” (_De Groot_, I.\r\n  103, 99–100.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The Chinese have also, according to Duhalde, a custom of\r\n  making a new opening in the wall of a house by which to carry\r\n  out the dead; and in their prisons a special hole in the wall\r\n  is provided for this office. This same custom exists among the\r\n  Esquimaux, as well as, according to Sonnerat, in Southern India,\r\n  and it used to exist in certain parts both of Holland and of\r\n  Central Italy. In the “clean village of Broek,” near Amsterdam,\r\n  those special doors may still be seen. And in certain towns of\r\n  Umbria, such as Perugia, Assisi, and Gubbio, this opening was\r\n  common, elevated some feet above the ground, and known as the “Door\r\n  of the Dead.”\r\n\r\n  I find in a list, printed by Liebrecht, of popular French\r\n  superstitions, amounting to 479 in number, condemned by Maupas du\r\n  Tour, Bishop of Evreux in 1664, the following: “When a woman lies\r\n  in of a dead child, it must not be taken out by the door of the\r\n  chamber but by the window, for if it were taken out by the door the\r\n  woman would never lie in of any but dead children.” The Samoyedes\r\n  have the superstition mentioned in the text, and act exactly as\r\n  Polo describes.\r\n\r\n  [“The body [of the Queen of Bali, 17th century] was drawn out of a\r\n  large aperture made in the wall to the right hand side of the door,\r\n  in the absurd opinion of _cheating the devil_, whom these islanders\r\n  believe to lie in wait in the ordinary passage.” (_John Crawford,\r\n  Hist. of the Indian Archipelago_, II. p. 245.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  And the Rev. Mr. Jaeschke writes to me from Lahaul, in British\r\n  Tibet: “Our Lama (from Central Tibet) tells us that the owner of\r\n  a house and the members of his family when they die are carried\r\n  through the house-door; but if another person dies in the house his\r\n  body is removed by some other aperture, such as a window, or the\r\n  smokehole in the roof, or a hole in the wall dug expressly for the\r\n  purpose. Or a wooden frame is made, fitting into the doorway, and\r\n  the body is then carried through; it being considered that by this\r\n  contrivance the evil consequences are escaped that might ensue,\r\n  were it carried through the ordinary, and, so to say, _undisguised_\r\n  house-door! Here, in Lahaul and the neighbouring countries, we have\r\n  not heard of such a custom.”\r\n\r\n  (_Duhalde_, quoted by Marsden; _Semedo_, p. 175; _Mr. Sala_ in\r\n  _N. and Q._, 2nd S.

Bonin visited in 1899 these caves which he calls “Grottoes of\r\n    Thousand Buddhas” (_Tsien Fo tung_). (_La Géographie_, 15th March,\r\n    1901, p. 171.) He found a stèle dated 1348, bearing a Buddhist\r\n    prayer in six different scripts like the inscription at Kiu Yung\r\n    Kwan. (_Rev. Hist. des Religions_, 1901, p. 393.)—H. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n                       OF THE PROVINCE OF CAMUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCamul is a province which in former days was a kingdom. It contains\r\nnumerous towns and villages, but the chief city bears the name of\r\nCAMUL. The province lies between the two deserts; for on the one side\r\nis the Great Desert of Lop, and on the other side is a small desert\r\nof three days’ journey in extent.{1} The people are all Idolaters, and\r\nhave a peculiar language. They live by the fruits of the earth, which\r\nthey have in plenty, and dispose of to travellers. They are a people\r\nwho take things very easily, for they mind nothing but playing and\r\nsinging, and dancing and enjoying themselves.{2}\r\n\r\nAnd it is the truth that if a foreigner comes to the house of one of\r\nthese people to lodge, the host is delighted, and desires his wife to\r\nput herself entirely at the guest’s disposal, whilst he himself gets\r\nout of the way, and comes back no more until the stranger shall have\r\ntaken his departure. The guest may stay and enjoy the wife’s society as\r\nlong as he lists, whilst the husband has no shame in the matter, but\r\nindeed considers it an honour. And all the men of this province are\r\nmade wittols of by their wives in this way.{3} The women themselves are\r\nfair and wanton.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass during the reign of MANGU KAAN, that as lord of\r\nthis province he came to hear of this custom, and he sent forth an\r\norder commanding them under grievous penalties to do so no more [but\r\nto provide public hostelries for travellers]. And when they heard this\r\norder they were much vexed thereat. [For about three years’ space\r\nthey carried it out. But then they found that their lands were no\r\nlonger fruitful, and that many mishaps befell them.] So they collected\r\ntogether and prepared a grand present which they sent to their Lord,\r\npraying him graciously to let them retain the custom which they had\r\ninherited from their ancestors; for it was by reason of this usage that\r\ntheir gods bestowed upon them all the good things that they possessed,\r\nand without it they saw not how they could continue to exist.{4} When\r\nthe Prince had heard their petition his reply was “Since ye must needs\r\nkeep your shame, keep it then,” and so he left them at liberty to\r\nmaintain their naughty custom. And they always have kept it up, and do\r\nso still.\r\n\r\nNow let us quit Camul, and I will tell you of another province which\r\nlies between north-west and north, and belongs to the Great Kaan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Kamul (or Komul) does not fall into the great line of\r\n  travel towards Cathay which Marco is following. His notice of it,\r\n  and of the next province, forms a digression like that which he\r\n  has already made to Samarkand. It appears very doubtful if Marco\r\n  himself had visited it; his father and uncle may have done so on\r\n  their first journey, as one of the chief routes to Northern China\r\n  from Western Asia lies through this city, and has done so for many\r\n  centuries. This was the route described by Pegolotti as that of the\r\n  Italian traders in the century following Polo; it was that followed\r\n  by Marignolli, by the envoys of Shah Rukh at a later date, and\r\n  at a much later by Benedict Goës. The people were in Polo’s time\r\n  apparently Buddhist, as the Uighúrs inhabiting this region had been\r\n  from an old date: in Shah Rukh’s time (1420) we find a mosque and a\r\n  great Buddhist Temple cheek by jowl; whilst Ramusio’s friend Hajji\r\n  Mahomed (_circa_ 1550) speaks of Kamul as the first Mahomedan city\r\n  met with in travelling from China.\r\n\r\n  Kamul stands on an oasis carefully cultivated by aid of reservoirs\r\n  for irrigation, and is noted in China for its rice and for some of\r\n  its fruits, especially melons and grapes. It is still a place of\r\n  some consequence, standing near the bifurcation of two great roads\r\n  from China, one passing north and the other south of the Thian\r\n  Shan, and it was the site of the Chinese Commissariat depôts for\r\n  the garrisons to the westward. It was lost to the Chinese in 1867.\r\n\r\n  Kamul appears to have been the see of a Nestorian bishop. A Bishop\r\n  of Kamul is mentioned as present at the inauguration of the\r\n  Catholicos Denha in 1266. (_Russians in Cent. Asia_, 129; _Ritter_,\r\n  II. 357 _seqq._; _Cathay, passim_; _Assemani_, II. 455–456.)\r\n\r\n  [_Kamul_ is the Turkish name of the province called by the Mongols\r\n  _Khamil_, by the Chinese _Hami_; the latter name is found for the\r\n  first time in the _Yuen Shi_, but it is first mentioned in Chinese\r\n  history in the 1st century of our Era under the name of _I-wu-lu_\r\n  or _I-wu_ (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ II. p. 20); after the death\r\n  of Chinghiz, it belonged to his son Chagataï. From the Great Wall,\r\n  at the Pass of Kia Yü, to Hami there is a distance of 1470 _li_.\r\n  (_C. Imbault-Huart. Le Pays de Hami ou Khamil_ ... d’après les\r\n  auteurs chinois, _Bul. de Géog. hist. et desc._, Paris, 1892, pp.\r\n  121–195.) The Chinese general Chang Yao was in 1877 at Hami, which\r\n  had submitted in 1867 to the Athalik Ghazi, and made it the basis\r\n  of his operations against the small towns of Chightam and Pidjam,\r\n  and Yakúb Khan himself stationed at Turfan. The Imperial Chinese\r\n  Agent in this region bears the title of _K’u lun Pan She Ta Ch’en_\r\n  and resides at K’urun (Urga); of lesser rank are the agents (_Pan\r\n  She Ta Ch’en_) of Kashgar, Kharashar, Kuché, Aksu, Khotan, and\r\n  Hami. (See a description of Hami by Colonel M. S. Bell, _Proc. R.\r\n  G. S._ XII. 1890, p. 213.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Expressed almost in the same words is the character\r\n  attributed by a Chinese writer to the people of Kuché in the same\r\n  region. (_Chin. Repos._ IX. 126.) In fact, the character seems to\r\n  be generally applicable to the people of East Turkestan, but sorely\r\n  kept down by the rigid Islam that is now enforced. (See _Shaw,\r\n  passim_, and especially the Mahrambáshi’s lamentations over the\r\n  jolly days that were no more, pp. 319, 376.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Pauthier’s text has “_sont si_ honni _de leur moliers\r\n  comme vous avez ouy_.” Here the Crusca has “_sono_ bozzi _delle\r\n  loro moglie_,” and the Lat. Geog. “_sunt_ bezzi _de suis\r\n  uxoribus_.” The Crusca Vocab. has inserted _bozzo_ with the meaning\r\n  we have given, on the strength of this passage. It occurs also in\r\n  Dante (_Paradiso_, XIX. 137), in the general sense of _disgraced_.\r\n\r\n  The shameful custom here spoken of is ascribed by Polo also to a\r\n  province of Eastern Tibet, and by popular report in modern times\r\n  to the Hazaras of the Hindu-Kush, a people of Mongolian blood, as\r\n  well as to certain nomad tribes of Persia, to say nothing of the\r\n  like accusation against our own ancestors which has been drawn from\r\n  Laonicus Chalcondylas. The old Arab traveller Ibn Muhalhal (10th\r\n  century) also relates the same of the Hazlakh (probably _Kharlikh_)\r\n  Turks: “Ducis alicujus uxor vel filia vel soror, quum mercatorum\r\n  agmen in terram venit, eos adit, eorumque lustrat faciem. Quorum\r\n  siquis earum afficit admiratione hunc domum suam ducit, eumque apud\r\n  se hospitio excipit, eique benigne facit. Atque marito suo et filio\r\n  fratrique rerum necessariarum curam demandat; neque dum hospes\r\n  apud eam habitat, nisi necessarium est, maritus eam adit.” A like\r\n  custom prevails among the Chukchis and Koryaks in the vicinity of\r\n  Kamtchatka. (_Elphinstone’s Caubul; Wood_, p. 201; _Burnes_, who\r\n  discredits, II. 153, III. 195; _Laon. Chalcond._ 1650, pp. 48–49;\r\n  _Kurd de Schloezer_, p. 13; _Erman_, II. 530.)\r\n\r\n  [“It is remarkable that the Chinese author, _Hung Hao_, who lived\r\n  a century before M. Polo, makes mention in his memoirs nearly in\r\n  the same words of this custom of the Uighúrs, with whom he became\r\n  acquainted during his captivity in the kingdom of the _Kin_.\r\n  According to the chronicle of the Tangut kingdom of Si-hia, Hami\r\n  was the nursery of Buddhism in Si-hia, and provided this kingdom\r\n  with Buddhist books and monks.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 6.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—So the Jewish rabble to Jeremiah: “Since we left\r\n  off to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out\r\n  drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been\r\n  consumed by the sword and by famine.” (_Jerem._ xliv. 18.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n                   OF THE PROVINCE OF CHINGINTALAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChingintalas is also a province at the verge of the Desert, and lying\r\nbetween north-west and north. It has an extent of sixteen days’\r\njourney, and belongs to the Great Kaan, and contains numerous towns and\r\nvillages. There are three different races of people in it—Idolaters,\r\nSaracens, and some Nestorian Christians.{1} At the northern extremity\r\nof this province there is a mountain in which are excellent veins of\r\nsteel and ondanique.{2} And you must know that in the same mountain\r\nthere is a vein of the substance from which Salamander is made.{3}\r\nFor the real truth is that the Salamander is no beast, as they allege\r\nin our part of the world, but is a substance found in the earth; and I\r\nwill tell you about it.\r\n\r\nEverybody must be aware that it can be no animal’s nature to live in\r\nfire, seeing that every animal is composed of all the four elements.{4}\r\nNow I, Marco Polo, had a Turkish acquaintance of the name of Zurficar,\r\nand he was a very clever fellow. And this Turk related to Messer Marco\r\nPolo how he had lived three years in that region on behalf of the Great\r\nKaan, in order to procure those Salamanders for him.{5} He said that\r\nthe way they got them was by digging in that mountain till they found\r\na certain vein. The substance of this vein was then taken and crushed,\r\nand when so treated it divides as it were into fibres of wool, which\r\nthey set forth to dry. When dry, these fibres were pounded in a great\r\ncopper mortar, and then washed, so as to remove all the earth and to\r\nleave only the fibres like fibres of wool. These were then spun, and\r\nmade into napkins. When first made these napkins are not very white,\r\nbut by putting them into the fire for a while they come out as white\r\nas snow. And so again whenever they become dirty they are bleached by\r\nbeing put in the fire.\r\n\r\nNow this, and nought else, is the truth about the Salamander, and the\r\npeople of the country all say the same. Any other account of the matter\r\nis fabulous nonsense. And I may add that they have at Rome a napkin of\r\nthis stuff, which the Grand Kaan sent to the Pope to make a wrapper for\r\nthe Holy Sudarium of Jesus Christ.{6}\r\n\r\nWe will now quit this subject, and I will proceed with my account of\r\nthe countries lying in the direction between north-east and east.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The identification of this province is a difficulty,\r\n  because the geographical definition is vague, and the name assigned\r\n  to it has not been traced in other authors. It is said to lie\r\n  _between north-west and north_, whilst Kamul was said to lie\r\n  _towards the north-west_. The account of both provinces forms a\r\n  digression, as is clear from the last words of the present chapter,\r\n  where the traveller returns to take up his regular route “in the\r\n  direction between north-east and east.” The point from which he\r\n  digresses, and to which he reverts, is Shachau, and ’tis presumably\r\n  from Shachau that he assigns bearings to the two provinces forming\r\n  the subject of the digression. Hence, as Kamul lies _vers maistre_,\r\n  _i.e._ north-west, and Chingintalas _entre maistre et tramontaine_,\r\n  _i.e._ nor’-nor’-west, Chingintalas can scarcely lie due west of\r\n  Kamul, as M. Pauthier would place it, in identifying it with an\r\n  obscure place called _Saiyintala_, in the territory of Urumtsi.\r\n  Moreover, the province is said to belong to the Great Kaan. Now,\r\n  _Urumtsi_ or Bishbalik seems to have belonged, not to the Great\r\n  Kaan, but to the empire of Chagatai, or possibly at this time to\r\n  Kaidu. Rashiduddin, speaking of the frontier between the Kaan and\r\n  Kaidu, says:—“From point to point are posted bodies of troops\r\n  under the orders of princes of the blood or other generals, and\r\n  they often come to blows with the troops of Kaidu. Five of these\r\n  are cantoned on the verge of the Desert; a sixth in Tangut, near\r\n  Chagan-Nor (White Lake); a seventh in the vicinity of Karakhoja,\r\n  a city of the Uighúrs, which lies between the two States, and\r\n  maintains neutrality.”\r\n\r\n  Karakhoja, this neutral town, is near Turfan, to the south-east of\r\n  Urumtsi, which thus would lie _without_ the Kaan’s boundary; Kamul\r\n  and the country north-east of it would lie within it. This country,\r\n  to the north and north-east of Kamul, has remained till quite\r\n  recently unexplored by any modern traveller, unless we put faith in\r\n  Mr. Atkinson’s somewhat hazy narrative. But it is here that I would\r\n  seek for Chingintalas.\r\n\r\n  Several possible explanations of this name have suggested\r\n  themselves or been suggested to me. I will mention two.\r\n\r\n  1. Klaproth states that the Mongols applied to Tibet the name of\r\n  _Baron-tala_, signifying the “Right Side,” _i.e._ the south-west\r\n  or south quarter, whilst Mongolia was called _Dzöhn_ (or _Dzegun_)\r\n  _Tala_, _i.e._ the “Left,” or north-east side. It is possible\r\n  that _Chigin-talas_ might represent _Dzegun Tala_ in some like\r\n  application. The etymology of _Dzungaria_, a name which in modern\r\n  times covers the territory of which we are speaking, is similar.\r\n\r\n  2. Professor Vámbéry thinks that it is probably _Chingin Tala_,\r\n  “The Vast Plain.” But nothing can be absolutely satisfactory in\r\n  such a case except historical evidence of the application of the\r\n  name.\r\n\r\n  I have left the identity of this name undecided, though pointing to\r\n  the general position of the region so-called by Marco, as indicated\r\n  by the vicinity of the Tangnu-Ola Mountains (p. 215). A passage\r\n  in the Journey of the Taouist Doctor, Changchun, as translated by\r\n  Dr. Bretschneider (_Chinese Recorder and Miss. Journ._, Shanghai,\r\n  Sept.–Oct., 1874, p. 258), suggests to me the strong probability\r\n  that it may be the _Kem-kém-jút_ of Rashiduddin, called by the\r\n  Chinese teacher _Kien-kien_-chau.\r\n\r\n  Rashiduddin couples the territory of the Kirghiz with Kemkemjút,\r\n  but defines the country embracing both with some exactness: “On one\r\n  side (south-east?), it bordered on the Mongol country; on a second\r\n  (north-east?), it was bounded by the Selenga; on a third (north),\r\n  by the ‘great river called Angara, which flows on the confines of\r\n  Ibir-Sibir’ (_i.e._ of Siberia); on a fourth side by the territory\r\n  of the Naimans. This great country contained _many towns and\r\n  villages_, as well as many nomad inhabitants.” Dr. Bretschneider’s\r\n  Chinese Traveller speaks of it as a country where _good iron was\r\n  found_, where (grey) squirrels abounded, and wheat was cultivated.\r\n  Other notices quoted by him show that it lay to the south-east of\r\n  the Kirghiz country, and had its name from the _Kien_ or _Ken_ R.\r\n  (_i.e._ the Upper Yenisei).\r\n\r\n  The name (_Kienkien_), the general direction, the existence of\r\n  good iron (“steel and ondanique”), the many towns and villages in\r\n  a position where we should little look for such an indication, all\r\n  point to the identity of this region with the Chingintalas of our\r\n  text. The only alteration called for in the Itinerary Map (No. IV.)\r\n  would be to spell the name _Hinkin_, or _Ghinghin_ (as it _is_ in\r\n  the Geographic Text), and to shift it a very little further to the\r\n  north.\r\n\r\n  (See _Chingin_ in _Kovalevski’s Mongol Dict._, No. 2134; and for\r\n  _Baron-tala_, etc., see _Della Penna, Breve Notizia del Regno\r\n  del Thibet_, with Klaproth’s notes, p. 6; _D’Avezac_, p. 568;\r\n  _Relation_ prefixed to D’Anville’s Atlas, p. 11; _Alphabetum\r\n  Tibetanum_, 454; and _Kircher, China Illustrata_, p. 65.)\r\n\r\n  Since the first edition was published, Mr. Ney Elias has traversed\r\n  the region in question from east to west; and I learn from him that\r\n  at Kobdo he found the most usual name for that town among Mongols,\r\n  Kalmaks, and Russians to be SANKIN-hoto. He had not then thought\r\n  of connecting this name with Chinghin-talas, and has therefore no\r\n  information as to its origin or the extent of its application. But\r\n  he remarks that Polo’s bearing of between north and north-west, if\r\n  understood to be _from Kamul_, would point exactly to Kobdo. He\r\n  also calls attention to the Lake _Sankin_-dalai, to the north-east\r\n  of Uliasut’ai, of which Atkinson gives a sketch. The recurrence of\r\n  this name over so wide a tract may have something to do with the\r\n  Chinghin-talas of Polo. But we must still wait for further light.[1]\r\n\r\n  [“Supposing that M. Polo mentions this place on his way\r\n  from Sha-chow to Su-chow, it is natural to think that it is\r\n  _Chi-kin-talas_, _i.e._ ‘Chi-kin plain’ or valley; Chi-kin was the\r\n  name of a lake, called so even now, and of a defile, which received\r\n  its name from the lake. The latter is on the way from Kia-yü kwan\r\n  to Ansi chow.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 7.) “_Chikin_, or more\r\n  correctly _Chigin_, is a Mongol word meaning ‘ear.’” (_Ibid._)\r\n  Palladius (p. 8) adds: “The Chinese accounts of Chi-kin are not\r\n  in contradiction to the statements given by M. Polo regarding the\r\n  same subject; but when the distances are taken into consideration,\r\n  a serious difficulty arises; Chi-kin is two hundred and fifty or\r\n  sixty _li_ distant from Su-chow, whilst, according to M. Polo’s\r\n  statement, ten days are necessary to cross this distance. One\r\n  of the three following explanations of this discrepancy must be\r\n  admitted: either Chingintalas is not Chi-kin, or the traveller’s\r\n  memory failed, or, lastly, an error crept into the number of days’\r\n  journey. The two last suppositions I consider the most probable;\r\n  the more so that similar difficulties occur several times in Marco\r\n  Polo’s narrative.” (_L.c._ p. 8.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—[_Ondanique_.—We have already referred to this word,\r\n  _Kermán_, p. 90. _Cobinan_, p. 124. La Curne de Sainte-Palaye\r\n  (_Dict._), F. Godefroy (_Dict._), Du Cange (_Gloss._), all give\r\n  to _andain_ the meaning of _enjambée_, from the Latin _andare_.\r\n  Godefroy, _s.v. andaine_, calls it _sorte d’acier ou de fer_, and\r\n  quotes besides Marco Polo:\r\n\r\n      “I. espiel, ou ot fer d’andaine,\r\n       Dont la lamele n’iert pas trouble.”\r\n\r\n  (Huon de Mery, _Le Tornoiement de l’Antechrist_, p. 3, Tarbé.)\r\n\r\n  There is a forest in the department of Orne, arrondissement of\r\n  Domfront, which belonged to the Crown before 1669, and is now State\r\n  property, called Forêt d’Andaine; it is situated near some bed of\r\n  iron. Is this the origin of the name?—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The Altai, or one of its ramifications, is probably the\r\n  mountain of the text, but so little is known of this part of the\r\n  Chinese territory that we can learn scarcely anything of its\r\n  mineral products. Still Martini does mention that asbestos is found\r\n  “in the Tartar country of _Tangu_,” which probably is the _Tangnu\r\n  Oola_ branch of the Altai to the south of the Upper Yenisei, and in\r\n  the very region we have indicated as Chingintalas. Mr. Elias tells\r\n  me he inquired for asbestos by its Chinese name at Uliasut’ai, but\r\n  without success.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—\r\n\r\n      “Degli elementi quattro principali,\r\n       Che son la Terra, e l’Acqua, e l’Aria, e ’l Foco,\r\n       Composti sono gli universi Animali,\r\n       Pigliando di ciascuno assai o poco.”\r\n                                     (_Dati_, _La Sfera_, p. 9.)\r\n\r\n  _Zurficar_ in the next sentence is a Mahomedan name, _Zu’lfiḳár_,\r\n  the title of [the edge of] Ali’s sword.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Here the G. Text adds: “_Et je meisme le vi_,” intimating,\r\n  I conceive, his having himself seen specimens of the asbestos—not\r\n  to his having been at the place.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The story of the Salamander passing unhurt through fire\r\n  is at least as old as Aristotle. But I cannot tell when the fable\r\n  arose that asbestos was a substance derived from the animal. This\r\n  belief, however, was general in the Middle Ages, both in Asia and\r\n  Europe. “The fable of the Salamander,” says Sir Thomas Browne,\r\n  “hath been much promoted by stories of incombustible napkins and\r\n  textures which endure the fire, whose materials are called by the\r\n  name of Salamander’s wool, which many, too literally apprehending,\r\n  conceive some investing part or integument of the Salamander....\r\n  Nor is this Salamander’s wool desumed from any animal, but a\r\n  mineral substance, metaphorically so called for this received\r\n  opinion.”\r\n\r\n  Those who knew that the Salamander was a lizard-like animal were\r\n  indeed perplexed as to its woolly coat. Thus the Cardinal de Vitry\r\n  is fain to say the creature “_profert ex cute_ quasi quamdam lanam\r\n  _de quâ zonae contextae comburi non possunt igne._” A Bestiary,\r\n  published by Cahier and Martin, says of it: “_De lui naist une\r\n  cose qui n’est ne soie ne lin ne laine._” Jerome Cardan looked in\r\n  vain, he says, for hair on the Salamander! Albertus Magnus calls\r\n  the incombustible fibre _pluma Salamandri_; and accordingly Bold\r\n  Bauduin de Sebourc finds the Salamander in the Terrestrial Paradise\r\n  _a kind of bird covered with the whitest plumage_; of this he takes\r\n  some, which he gets woven into a cloth; this he presents to the\r\n  Pope, and the Pontiff applies it to the purpose mentioned in the\r\n  text, viz. to cover the holy napkin of St. Veronica.\r\n\r\n  Gervase of Tilbury writes: “I saw, when lately at Rome, a broad\r\n  strap of Salamander skin, like a girdle for the loins, which had\r\n  been brought thither by Cardinal Peter of Capua. When it had become\r\n  somewhat soiled by use, I myself saw it cleaned perfectly, and\r\n  without receiving harm, by being put in the fire.”\r\n\r\n  In Persian the creature is called _Samandar_, _Samandal_, etc., and\r\n  some derive the word from _Sam_, “fire,” and _Andar_, “within.”\r\n  Doubtless it is a corruption of the Greek Σαλαμάνδρα, whatever be\r\n  the origin of that. Bakui says the animal is found at Ghur, near\r\n  Herat, and is _like a mouse_. Another author, quoted by D’Herbelot,\r\n  says it is _like a marten_.\r\n\r\n  [Sir T. Douglas Forsyth, in his _Introductory Remarks_ to\r\n  Prjevalsky’s _Travels to Lob-nor_ (p. 20), at Aksu says: “The\r\n  asbestos mentioned by Marco Polo as a utilized product of this\r\n  region is not even so known in this country.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  ✛ Interesting details regarding the fabrication of cloth and paper\r\n  from amianth or asbestos are contained in a report presented to the\r\n  French Institute by M. Sage (_Mém. Ac. Sciences_, 2e Sem., 1806, p.\r\n  102), of which large extracts are given in the _Diction. général\r\n  des Tissus_, par M. Bezon, 2e éd. vol. ii. Lyon, 1859, p. 5. He\r\n  mentions that a _Sudarium_ of this material is still shown at the\r\n  Vatican; we hope it is the cover which Kúblái sent.\r\n\r\n  [This hope is not to be realized. Mgr. Duchesne, of the Institut\r\n  de France, writes to me from Rome, from information derived from\r\n  the keepers of the Vatican Museum, that there is no sudarium from\r\n  the Great Khan, that indeed part of a sudarium made of asbestos is\r\n  shown (under glass) in this Museum, about 20 inches long, but it is\r\n  ancient, and was found in a Pagan tomb of the Appian Way.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  M. Sage exhibited incombustible paper made from this material,\r\n  and had himself seen a small furnace of Chinese origin made from\r\n  it. Madame Perpenté, an Italian lady, who experimented much with\r\n  asbestos, found that from a crude mass of that substance threads\r\n  could be elicited which were ten times the length of the mass\r\n  itself, and were indeed sometimes several metres in length, the\r\n  fibres seeming to be involved, like silk in a cocoon. Her process\r\n  of preparation was much like that described by Marco. She succeeded\r\n  in carding and reeling the material, made gloves and the like, as\r\n  well as paper, from it, and sent to the Institute a work printed on\r\n  such paper.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. A. Williamson mentions asbestos as found in Shantung. The\r\n  natives use it for making stoves, crucibles, and so forth.\r\n\r\n  (_Sir T.

I\r\n    take the opportunity of saying that Mr. Ney Elias, a most competent\r\n    judge, who has travelled across the region in question whilst\r\n    admitting, as every one must, Atkinson’s vagueness and sometimes\r\n    very careless statements, is not at all disposed to discredit the\r\n    truth of his narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n                      OF THE PROVINCE OF SUKCHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the province of which I spoke before,{1} you ride ten days\r\nbetween north-east and east, and in all that way you find no human\r\ndwelling, or next to none, so that there is nothing for our book to\r\nspeak of.\r\n\r\nAt the end of those ten days you come to another province called\r\nSUKCHUR, in which there are numerous towns and villages. The chief\r\ncity is called SUKCHU.{2} The people are partly Christians and partly\r\nIdolaters, and all are subject to the Great Kaan.\r\n\r\nThe great General Province to which all these three provinces belong is\r\ncalled TANGUT.\r\n\r\nOver all the mountains of this province rhubarb is found in great\r\nabundance, and thither merchants come to buy it, and carry it thence\r\nall over the world.{3} [Travellers, however, dare not visit those\r\nmountains with any cattle but those of the country, for a certain plant\r\ngrows there which is so poisonous that cattle which eat it lose their\r\nhoofs.

The whole of the province is healthy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Referring apparently to Shachau; see Note 1 and the closing\r\n  words of last chapter.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—There is no doubt that the province and city are those of\r\n  SUHCHAU, but there is a great variety in the readings, and several\r\n  texts have a marked difference between the name of the province\r\n  and that of the city, whilst others give them as the same. I have\r\n  adopted those to which the resultants of the readings of the best\r\n  texts seem to point, viz. _Succiur_ and _Succiu_, though with\r\n  considerable doubt whether they should not be identical. Pauthier\r\n  declares that _Suctur_, which is the reading of his favourite MS.,\r\n  is the exact pronunciation, after the vulgar Mongol manner, of\r\n  _Suh-chau-lu_, the _Lu_ or circuit of Suhchau; whilst Neumann says\r\n  that the Northern Chinese constantly add an euphonic particle _or_\r\n  to the end of words. I confess to little faith in such refinements,\r\n  when no evidence is produced.\r\n\r\n  [Suhchau had been devastated and its inhabitants massacred by\r\n  Chinghiz Khan in 1226.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Suhchau is called by Rashiduddin, and by Shah Rukh’s ambassadors,\r\n  _Sukchú_, in exact correspondence with the reading we have adopted\r\n  for the name of the city, whilst the Russian Envoy Boikoff, in the\r\n  17th century, calls it “_Suktsey_, where the rhubarb grows”; and\r\n  Anthony Jenkinson, in Hakluyt, by a slight metathesis, _Sowchick_.\r\n  Suhchau lies just within the extreme north-west angle of the Great\r\n  Wall. It was at Suhchau that Benedict Goës was detained, waiting\r\n  for leave to go on to Peking, eighteen weary months, and there he\r\n  died just as aid reached him.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The real rhubarb [_Rheum palmatum_] grows wild, on very\r\n  high mountains. The central line of its distribution appears to be\r\n  the high range dividing the head waters of the Hwang-Ho, Yalung,\r\n  and Min-Kiang. The chief markets are Siningfu (see ch. lvii.), and\r\n  Kwan-Kian in Szechwan. In the latter province an inferior kind is\r\n  grown in fields, but the genuine rhubarb defies cultivation. (See\r\n  _Richthofen_, Letters, No. VII. p. 69.) Till recently it was almost\r\n  all exported by Kiakhta and Russia, but some now comes _viâ_ Hankau\r\n  and Shanghai.\r\n\r\n  [“See, on the preparation of the root in China, Gemelli-Careri.\r\n  (_Churchill’s Collect._, Bk. III. ch. v. 365.) It is said that when\r\n  Chinghiz Khan was pillaging Tangut, the only things his minister,\r\n  Yeh-lü Ch’u-ts’ai, would take as his share of the booty were a few\r\n  Chinese books and a supply of rhubarb, with which he saved the\r\n  lives of a great number of Mongols, when, a short time after, an\r\n  epidemic broke out in the army.” (_D’Ohsson_, I. 372.—_Rockhill,\r\n  Rubruck_, p. 193, note.)\r\n\r\n  “With respect to rhubarb ... the _Suchowchi_ also makes the remark,\r\n  that the best rhubarb, with golden flowers in the breaking, is\r\n  gathered in this province (district of _Shan-tan_), and that it\r\n  is equally beneficial to men and beasts, preserving them from the\r\n  pernicious effects of the heat.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 9.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—_Erba_ is the title applied to the poisonous growth, which\r\n  may be either “plant” or “grass.” It is not unlikely that it was\r\n  a plant akin to the _Andromeda ovalifolia_, the tradition of the\r\n  poisonous character of which prevails everywhere along the Himalaya\r\n  from Nepal to the Indus.\r\n\r\n  It is notorious for poisoning sheep and goats at Simla and other\r\n  hill sanitaria; and Dr. Cleghorn notes the same circumstance\r\n  regarding it that Polo heard of the plant in Tangut, viz. that its\r\n  effects on flocks imported from the plains are highly injurious,\r\n  whilst those of the hills do not appear to suffer, probably because\r\n  they shun the young leaves, which alone are deleterious. Mr. Marsh\r\n  attests the like fact regarding the _Kalmia angustifolia_ of New\r\n  England, a plant of the same order (_Ericaceae_). Sheep bred where\r\n  it abounds almost always avoid browsing on its leaves, whilst those\r\n  brought from districts where it is unknown feed upon it and are\r\n  poisoned.\r\n\r\n  Firishta, quoting from the _Zafar-Námah_, says: “On the road from\r\n  Kashmir towards Tibet there is a plain on which no other vegetable\r\n  grows but a poisonous grass that destroys all the cattle that taste\r\n  of it, and therefore no horsemen venture to travel that route.”\r\n  And Abbé Desgodins, writing from E. Tibet, mentions that sheep and\r\n  goats are poisoned by rhododendron leaves. (_Dr. Hugh Cleghorn_\r\n  in _J. Agricultural and Hortic. Society of India_, XIV. part 4;\r\n  _Marsh’s Man and Nature_, p. 40; _Brigg’s Firishta_, IV. 449; _Bul.\r\n  de la Soc. de Géog._ 1873, I. 333.)\r\n\r\n  [“This poisonous plant seems to be the _Stipa inebrians_ described\r\n  by the late Dr. Hance in the _Journal of Bot._ 1876, p. 211, from\r\n  specimens sent to me by Belgian Missionaries from the Ala Shan\r\n  Mountains, west of the Yellow River.” (_Bretschneider, Hist. of\r\n  Bot. Disc._ I. p. 5.)\r\n\r\n  “M. Polo notices that the cattle not indigenous to the province\r\n  lose their hoofs in the Suh-chau Mountains; but that is probably\r\n  not on account of some poisonous grass, but in consequence of the\r\n  stony ground.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 9.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n                       OF THE CITY OF CAMPICHU.\r\n\r\n\r\nCampichu is also a city of Tangut, and a very great and noble one.\r\nIndeed it is the capital and place of government of the whole province\r\nof Tangut.{1} The people are Idolaters, Saracens, and Christians,\r\nand the latter have three very fine churches in the city, whilst the\r\nIdolaters have many minsters and abbeys after their fashion. In these\r\nthey have an enormous number of idols, both small and great, certain\r\nof the latter being a good ten paces in stature; some of them being\r\nof wood, others of clay, and others yet of stone. They are all highly\r\npolished, and then covered with gold. The great idols of which I speak\r\nlie at length.{2} And round about them there are other figures of\r\nconsiderable size, as if adoring and paying homage before them.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have not yet given you particulars about the customs of these\r\nIdolaters, I will proceed to tell you about them.\r\n\r\nYou must know that there are among them certain religious recluses\r\nwho lead a more virtuous life than the rest. These abstain from all\r\nlechery, though they do not indeed regard it as a deadly sin; howbeit\r\nif any one sin against nature they condemn him to death. They have an\r\nEcclesiastical Calendar as we have; and there are five days in the\r\nmonth that they observe particularly; and on these five days they would\r\non no account either slaughter any animal or eat flesh meat. On those\r\ndays, moreover, they observe much greater abstinence altogether than on\r\nother days.{3}\r\n\r\nAmong these people a man may take thirty wives, more or less, if he\r\ncan but afford to do so, each having wives in proportion to his wealth\r\nand means; but the first wife is always held in highest consideration.\r\nThe men endow their wives with cattle, slaves, and money, according\r\nto their ability. And if a man dislikes any one of his wives, he just\r\nturns her off and takes another. They take to wife their cousins and\r\ntheir fathers’ widows (always excepting the man’s own mother), holding\r\nto be no sin many things that we think grievous sins, and, in short,\r\nthey live like beasts.{4}\r\n\r\nMesser Maffeo and Messer Marco Polo dwelt a whole year in this city\r\nwhen on a mission.{5}\r\n\r\nNow we will leave this and tell you about other provinces towards the\r\nnorth, for we are going to take you a sixty days’ journey in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Campichiu is undoubtedly Kanchau, which was at this time,\r\n  as Pauthier tells us, the chief city of the administration of\r\n  _Kansuh_, corresponding to Polo’s Tangut. _Kansuh_ itself is a name\r\n  compounded of the names of the two cities _Kan_-chau and _Suh_-chau.\r\n\r\n  [Kanchau fell under the Tangut dominion in 1208. (_Palladius_,\r\n  p. 10.) The Musulmans mentioned by Polo at Shachau and Kanchau\r\n  probably came from Khotan.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The difficulties that have been made about the form of the name\r\n  _Campiciou_, etc., in Polo, and the attempts to explain these,\r\n  are probably alike futile. Quatremère writes the Persian form\r\n  of the name after Abdurrazzak as _Kamtcheou_, but I see that\r\n  Erdmann writes it after Rashid, I presume on good grounds, as\r\n  _Ckamidschu_, _i.e._ _Ḳamiju_ or _Ḳamichu_. And that this _was_\r\n  the Western pronunciation of the name is shown by the form which\r\n  Pegolotti uses, _Camexu_, _i.e._ Camechu. The _p_ in Polo’s spelling\r\n  is probably only a superfluous letter, as in the occasional old\r\n  spelling of _dampnum_, _contempnere_, _hympnus_, _tirampnus_,\r\n  _sompnour_, _Dampne Deu_. In fact, Marignolli writes Polo’s\r\n  _Quinsai_ as _Campsay_.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of notice that though Ramusio’s text prints the\r\n  names of these two cities as _Succuir_ and _Campion_, his own\r\n  pronunciation of them appears to have been quite well understood\r\n  by the Persian traveller Hajji Mahomed, for it is perfectly clear\r\n  that the latter recognized in these names Suhchau and Kanchau.\r\n  (See _Ram._ II. f. 14v.) The second volume of the _Navigationi_,\r\n  containing Polo, was published after Ramusio’s death, and it is\r\n  possible that the names as he himself read them were more correct\r\n  (_e.g._ _Succiur, Campjou_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Colossal Figure, Buddha entering Nirvana.\r\n\r\n    “=Et si voz di qu’il ont de ydres que sunt grant dix pas.... Ceste\r\n    grant ydres gigent.=” ...]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This is the meaning of the phrase in the G. T.: “_Ceste\r\n  grande ydre_ gigent,” as may be seen from Ramusio’s _giaciono\r\n  distesi_. Lazari renders the former expression, “giganteggia\r\n  un idolo,” etc., a phrase very unlike Polo. The circumstance\r\n  is interesting, because this recumbent Colossus at Kanchau is\r\n  mentioned both by Hajji Mahomed and by Shah Rukh’s people. The\r\n  latter say: “In this city of Kanchú there is an Idol-Temple 500\r\n  cubits square. In the middle is an idol lying at length which\r\n  measures 50 paces. The sole of the foot is nine paces long, and the\r\n  instep is 21 cubits in girth. Behind this image and overhead are\r\n  other idols of a cubit (?) in height, besides figures of _Bakshis_\r\n  as large as life. The action of all is hit off so admirably that\r\n  you would think they were alive.” These great recumbent figures\r\n  are favourites in Buddhist countries still, _e.g._ in Siam, Burma,\r\n  and Ceylon. They symbolise Sakya Buddha entering _Nirvána_. Such a\r\n  recumbent figure, perhaps the prototype of these, was seen by Hiuen\r\n  Tsang in a Vihara close to the Sál Grove at Kusinágara, where Sakya\r\n  entered that state, _i.e._ died. The stature of Buddha was, we are\r\n  told, 12 cubits; but Brahma, Indra, and the other gods vainly tried\r\n  to compute his dimensions. Some such rude metaphor is probably\r\n  embodied in these large images. I have described one 69 feet long\r\n  in Burma (represented in the cut), but others exist of much greater\r\n  size, though probably none equal to that which Hiuen Tsang, in the\r\n  7th century, saw near Bamian, which was 1000 feet in length! I have\r\n  heard of but one such image remaining in India, viz. in one of the\r\n  caves at Dhamnár in Málwa. This is 15 feet long, and is popularly\r\n  known as “Bhim’s Baby.” (_Cathay_, etc., pp. cciii., ccxviii.;\r\n  _Mission to Ava_, p. 52; _V. et V. de H. T._, p. 374: _Cunningham’s\r\n  Archæl. Reports_, ii. 274; _Tod_, ii. 273.)\r\n\r\n  [“The temple, in which M. Polo saw an idol of Buddha, represented\r\n  in a lying position, is evidently _Wo-fo-sze_, _i.e._ ‘Monastery of\r\n  the lying Buddha.’ It was built in 1103 by a Tangut queen, to place\r\n  there three idols representing Buddha in this posture, which have\r\n  since been found in the ground on this very spot.” (_Palladius_,\r\n  _l.c._ p. 10.)\r\n\r\n  Rubruck (p. 144) says: “A Nestorian, who had come from Cathay told\r\n  me that in that country there is an idol so big that it can be\r\n  seen from two days off.” Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 144, _note_)\r\n  writes: “The largest stone image I have seen is in a cave temple at\r\n  Yung-kán, about 10 miles north-west of Ta t’ung Fu in Shan-si. Père\r\n  Gerbillon says the Emperor K’ang-hsi measured it himself and found\r\n  it to be 57 _chih_ high (61 feet). (_Duhalde, Description_, IV.\r\n  352.) I have seen another colossal statue in a cave near Pinchou in\r\n  north-west Shan-si, and there is another about 45 miles south of\r\n  Ning-hsia Fu, near the left bank of the Yellow River. (_Rockhill,\r\n  Land of the Lamas_, 26, and _Diary_, 47.) The great recumbent\r\n  figure of the ‘Sleeping Buddha’ in the Wo Fo ssŭ, near Peking, is\r\n  of clay.”\r\n\r\n  King Haython (Brosset’s ed. p. 181) mentions the statue in clay, of\r\n  an extraordinary height, of a God (Buddha) aged 3040 years, who is\r\n  to live 370,000 years more, when he will be superseded by another\r\n  god called _Madri_ (Maitreya).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Great Lama Monastery.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Marco is now speaking of the Lamas, or clergy of Tibetan\r\n  Buddhism. The customs mentioned have varied in details, both\r\n  locally and with the changes that the system has passed through in\r\n  the course of time.\r\n\r\n  The institutes of ancient Buddhism set apart the days of new and\r\n  full moon to be observed by the _Sramanas_ or monks, by fasting,\r\n  confession, and listening to the reading of the law. It became\r\n  usual for the laity to take part in the observance, and the number\r\n  of days was increased to three and then to four, whilst Hiuen Tsang\r\n  himself speaks of “the six fasts of every month,” and a Chinese\r\n  authority quoted by Julien gives the days as the 8th, 14th, 15th,\r\n  23rd, 29th, and 30th. Fahian says that in Ceylon preaching took\r\n  place on the 8th, 14th, and 15th days of the month. Four is the\r\n  number now most general amongst Buddhist nations, and the days\r\n  may be regarded as a kind of Buddhist Sabbath. In the southern\r\n  countries and in Nepal they occur at the moon’s changes. In Tibet\r\n  and among the Mongol Buddhists they are not at equal intervals,\r\n  though I find the actual days differently stated by different\r\n  authorities. Pallas says the Mongols observed the 13th, 14th, and\r\n  15th, the three days being brought together, he thought, on account\r\n  of the distance many Lamas had to travel to the temple—just as in\r\n  some Scotch country parishes they used to give two sermons in one\r\n  service for like reason! Koeppen, to whose work this note is much\r\n  indebted, says the Tibetan days are the 14th, 15th, 29th, 30th,\r\n  and adds as to the manner of observance: “On these days, by rule,\r\n  among the Lamas, nothing should be tasted but farinaceous food and\r\n  tea; the very devout refrain from all food from sunrise to sunset.\r\n  The Temples are decorated, and the altar tables set out with the\r\n  holy symbols, with tapers, and with dishes containing offerings\r\n  in corn, meal, tea, butter, etc., and especially with small\r\n  pyramids of dough, or of rice or clay, and accompanied by much\r\n  burning of incense-sticks. The service performed by the priests\r\n  is more solemn, the music louder and more exciting, than usual.\r\n  The laity make their offerings, tell their beads, and repeat _Om\r\n  mani padma hom_,” etc. In the _concordat_ that took place between\r\n  the Dalai-Lama and the Altun Khaghan, on the reconversion of the\r\n  Mongols to Buddhism in the 16th century, one of the articles was\r\n  the entire prohibition of hunting and the slaughter of animals on\r\n  the monthly fast days. The practice varies much, however, even in\r\n  Tibet, with different provinces and sects—a variation which the\r\n  Ramusian text of Polo implies in these words: “For five days, or\r\n  _four days_, or _three_ in each month, they shed no blood,” etc.\r\n\r\n  In Burma the Worship Day, as it is usually called by Europeans,\r\n  is a very gay scene, the women flocking to the pagodas in their\r\n  brightest attire. (_H. T. Mémoires_, I. 6, 208; _Koeppen_, I.\r\n  563–564, II. 139, 307–308; _Pallas, Samml._ II. 168–169).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—These matrimonial customs are the same that are afterwards\r\n  ascribed to the Tartars, so we defer remark.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—So Pauthier’s text, “_en legation_.” The G. Text includes\r\n  Nicolo Polo, and says, “on business of theirs that is not worth\r\n  mentioning,” and with this Ramusio agrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n                        OF THE CITY OF ETZINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you leave the city of Campichu you ride for twelve days, and then\r\nreach a city called ETZINA, which is towards the north on the verge\r\nof the Sandy Desert; it belongs to the Province of Tangut.{1} The\r\npeople are Idolaters, and possess plenty of camels and cattle, and the\r\ncountry produces a number of good falcons, both Sakers and Lanners. The\r\ninhabitants live by their cultivation and their cattle, for they have\r\nno trade. At this city you must needs lay in victuals for forty days,\r\nbecause when you quit Etzina, you enter on a desert which extends forty\r\ndays’ journey to the north, and on which you meet with no habitation\r\nnor baiting-place.{2} In the summer-time, indeed, you will fall in with\r\npeople, but in the winter the cold is too great. You also meet with\r\nwild beasts (for there are some small pine-woods here and there), and\r\nwith numbers of wild asses.{3} When you have travelled these forty days\r\nacross the Desert you come to a certain province lying to the north.\r\nIts name you shall hear presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wild Ass of Mongolia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Deguignes says that YETSINA is found in a Chinese Map of\r\n  Tartary of the Mongol era, and this is confirmed by Pauthier, who\r\n  reads it _Itsinai_, and adds that the text of the Map names it\r\n  as one of the seven _Lu_ or Circuits of the Province of Kansuh\r\n  (or Tangut). Indeed, in D’Anville’s Atlas we find a river called\r\n  _Etsina Pira_, running northward from Kanchau, and a little below\r\n  the 41st parallel joining another from Suhchau. Beyond the\r\n  junction is a town called _Hoa-tsiang_, which probably represents\r\n  Etzina. Yetsina is also mentioned in Gaubil’s History of Chinghiz\r\n  as taken by that conqueror in 1226, on his last campaign against\r\n  Tangut. This capture would also seem from Pétis de la Croix to be\r\n  mentioned by Rashiduddin. Gaubil says the Chinese Geography places\r\n  Yetsina north of Kanchau and north-east of Suhchau, at a distance\r\n  of 120 leagues from Kanchau, but observes that this is certainly\r\n  too great. (_Gaubil_, p. 49.)\r\n\r\n  [I believe there can be no doubt that Etzina must be looked for\r\n  on the river _Hei-shui_, called _Etsina_ by the Mongols, east of\r\n  Suhchau. This river empties its waters into the two lakes Soho-omo\r\n  and Sopo-omo. Etzina would have been therefore situated on the\r\n  river on the border of the Desert, at the top of a triangle whose\r\n  bases would be Suhchau and Kanchau. This river was once part\r\n  of the frontier of the kingdom of Tangut. (Cf. _Devéria, Notes\r\n  d’épigraphie mongolo-chinoise_, p. 4.) Reclus (_Géog. Univ., Asie\r\n  Orientale_, p. 159) says: “To the east [of Hami], beyond the Chukur\r\n  Gobi, are to be found also some permanent villages and the remains\r\n  of cities. One of them is perhaps the ‘cité d’Etzina’ of which\r\n  Marco Polo speaks, and the name is to be found in that of the river\r\n  Az-sind.”\r\n\r\n  “Through Kanchau was the shortest, and most direct and convenient\r\n  road to _I-tsi-nay_.... I-tsi-nay, or _Echiné_, is properly the\r\n  name of a lake. Khubilaï, disquieted by his factious relatives on\r\n  the north, established a military post near lake I-tsi-nay, and\r\n  built a town, or a fort on the south-western shore of this lake.\r\n  The name of I-tsi-nay appears from that time; it does not occur\r\n  in the chronicle of the Tangut kingdom; the lake had then another\r\n  name. Vestiges of the town are seen to this day; the buildings\r\n  were of large dimensions, and some of them were very fine. In\r\n  Marco Polo’s time there existed a direct route from I-tsi-nay to\r\n  Karakorum; traces of this road are still noticeable, but it is\r\n  no more used. This circumstance, _i.e._ the existence of a road\r\n  from I-tsi-nay to Karakorum, probably led Marco Polo to make an\r\n  excursion (a mental one, I suppose) to the residence of the Khans\r\n  in Northern Mongolia.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ pp. 10–11.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Erberge_” (G. T.). Pauthier has _Herbage_.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The Wild Ass of Mongolia is the _Dshiggetai_ of Pallas\r\n  (_Asinus hemionus_ of Gray), and identical with the Tibetan _Kyang_\r\n  of Moorcroft and Trans-Himalayan sportsmen. It differs, according\r\n  to Blyth, only in shades of colour and unimportant markings from\r\n  the _Ghor Khar_ of Western India and the Persian Deserts, the\r\n  _Kulan_ of Turkestan, which Marco has spoken of in a previous\r\n  passage (_suprà_, ch. xvi.; _J. A. S. B._ XXVIII. 229 _seqq._).\r\n  There is a fine Kyang in the Zoological Gardens, whose portrait,\r\n  after Wolf, is given here. But Mr. Ney Elias says of this animal\r\n  that he has little of the aspect of his nomadic brethren. [The wild\r\n  ass (Tibetan _Kyang_, Mongol _Holu_ or _Hulan_) is called by the\r\n  Chinese _yeh ma_, “wild horse,” though “every one admits that it is\r\n  an ass, and should be called _yeh lo-tzŭ_.” (_Rockhill, Land of the\r\n  Lamas_, 151, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Captain Younghusband (1886) saw in the Altaï Mountains\r\n  “considerable numbers of wild asses, which appeared to be perfectly\r\n  similar to the Kyang of Ladak and Tibet, and wild horses too—the\r\n  _Equus Prejevalskii_—roaming about these great open plains.”\r\n  (_Proc. R. G. S._ X. 1888, p. 495.) Dr. Sven Hedin says the\r\n  _habitat_ of the _Kulan_ is the heights of Tibet as well as the\r\n  valley of the Tarim; it looks like a mule with the mane and tail of\r\n  an ass, but shorter ears, longer than those of a horse; he gives a\r\n  picture of it.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n                       OF THE CITY OF CARACORON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaracoron is a city of some three miles in compass. [It is surrounded\r\nby a strong earthen rampart, for stone is scarce there. And beside it\r\nthere is a great citadel wherein is a fine palace in which the Governor\r\nresides.] ’Tis the first city that the Tartars possessed after they\r\nissued from their own country. And now I will tell you all about how\r\nthey first acquired dominion and spread over the world.{1}\r\n\r\nOriginally the Tartars{2} dwelt in the north on the borders of\r\nCHORCHA.{3} Their country was one of great plains; and there were no\r\ntowns or villages in it, but excellent pasture-lands, with great rivers\r\nand many sheets of water; in fact it was a very fine and extensive\r\nregion. But there was no sovereign in the land. They did, however, pay\r\ntax and tribute to a great prince who was called in their tongue UNC\r\nCAN, the same that we call Prester John, him in fact about whose great\r\ndominion all the world talks.{4} The tribute he had of them was one\r\nbeast out of every ten, and also a tithe of all their other gear.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that the Tartars multiplied exceedingly. And when\r\nPrester John saw how great a people they had become, he began to\r\nfear that he should have trouble from them. So he made a scheme to\r\ndistribute them over sundry countries, and sent one of his Barons to\r\ncarry this out. When the Tartars became aware of this they took it\r\nmuch amiss, and with one consent they left their country and went off\r\nacross a desert to a distant region towards the north, where Prester\r\nJohn could not get at them to annoy them. Thus they revolted from his\r\nauthority and paid him tribute no longer. And so things continued for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—KARÁKORUM, near the upper course of the River Orkhon, is\r\n  said by Chinese authors to have been founded by Búkú Khan of the\r\n  Hoei-Hu or Uigúrs, in the 8th century. In the days of Chinghiz, we\r\n  are told that it was the headquarters of his ally, and afterwards\r\n  enemy, Togrul Wang Khan, the Prester John of Polo. [“The name of\r\n  this famous city is Mongol, _Kara_, ‘black,’ and _Kuren_, ‘a camp,’\r\n  or properly ‘pailing.’” It was founded in 1235 by Okkodai, who\r\n  called it Ordu Balik, or “the City of the Ordu,” otherwise “The\r\n  Royal City.” Mohammedan authors say it took its name of Karákorum\r\n  from the mountains to the south of it, in which the Orkhon had\r\n  its source. (_D’Ohsson_, ii. 64.) The Chinese mention a range of\r\n  mountains from which the Orkhon flows, called _Wu-tê kien shan_.\r\n  (_T’ang shu_, bk. 43_b_.) Probably these are the same. Rashiduddin\r\n  speaks of a tribe of Utikien Uigúrs living in this country.\r\n  (_Bretschneider, Med. Geog._ 191; _D’Ohsson_, i. 437; _Rockhill,\r\n  Rubruck_, 220, note.)—Karákorum was called by the Chinese _Ho-lin_\r\n  and was chosen by Chinghiz, in 1206, as his capital; the full\r\n  name of it, _Ha-la Ho-lin_, was derived from a river to the west.\r\n  (_Yuen shi_, ch. lviii.) Gaubil (_Holin_, p. 10) says that the\r\n  river, called in his days in Tartar _Karoha_, was, at the time\r\n  of the Mongol Emperors, named by the Chinese _Ha-la Ho-lin_, in\r\n  Tartar language _Ka la Ko lin_, or _Cara korin_, or _Kara Koran_.\r\n  In the spring of 1235, Okkodai had a wall raised round Ho-lin\r\n  and a palace called _Wang an_, built inside the city. (_Gaubil,\r\n  Gentchiscan_, 89.) After the death of Kúblái, _Ho-lin_ was altered\r\n  into _Ho-Ning_, and, in 1320, the name of the province was changed\r\n  into _Ling-pé_ (mountainous north, _i.e._ the _Yin-shan_ chain,\r\n  separating China Proper from Mongolia). In 1256, Mangu Kaan decided\r\n  to transfer the seat of government to Kaipingfu, or Shangtu, near\r\n  the present Dolonnor, north of Peking. (_Suprà_ in Prologue, ch.\r\n  xiii. note 1.) In 1260, Kúblái transferred his capital to _Ta-Tu_\r\n  (Peking).\r\n\r\n  Plano Carpini (1246) is the first Western traveller to mention it\r\n  by name which he writes _Caracoron_; he visited the Sira Orda, at\r\n  half a day’s journey from Karákorum, where Okkodai used to pass the\r\n  summer; it was situated at a place Ormektua. (_Rockhill, Rubruck_,\r\n  21, 111.) Rubruquis (1253) visited the city itself; the following\r\n  is his account of it: “As regards the city of Caracoron, you must\r\n  understand that if you set aside the Kaan’s own Palace, it is not\r\n  as good as the Borough of St. Denis; and as for the Palace, the\r\n  Abbey of St. Denis is worth ten of it! There are two streets in\r\n  the town; one of which is occupied by the Saracens, and in that is\r\n  the marketplace. The other street is occupied by the Cathayans,\r\n  who are all craftsmen. Besides these two streets there are some\r\n  great palaces occupied by the court secretaries. There are also\r\n  twelve idol temples belonging to different nations, two Mahummeries\r\n  in which the Law of Mahomet is preached, and one church of the\r\n  Christians at the extremity of the town. The town is enclosed by\r\n  a mud-wall and has four gates. At the east gate they sell millet\r\n  and other corn, but the supply is scanty; at the west gate they\r\n  sell rams and goats; at the south gate oxen and waggons; at the\r\n  north gate horses.... Mangu Kaan has a great Court beside the Town\r\n  Rampart, which is enclosed by a brick wall, just like our priories.\r\n  Inside there is a big palace, within which he holds a drinking-bout\r\n  twice a year; ... there are also a number of long buildings like\r\n  granges, in which are kept his treasures and his stores of victual”\r\n  (345–6; 334).\r\n\r\n  Where was Karákorum situated?\r\n\r\n  The Archimandrite Palladius is very prudent (_l.c._ p. 11):\r\n  “Everything that the studious Chinese authors could gather and\r\n  say of the situation of Karakhorum is collected in two Chinese\r\n  works, _Lo fung low wen kao_ (1849), and _Mungku yew mu ki_\r\n  (1859). However, no positive conclusion can be derived from these\r\n  researches, chiefly in consequence of the absence of a tolerably\r\n  correct map of Northern Mongolia.”\r\n\r\n  Abel Rémusat (_Mém. sur Géog. Asie Centrale_, p. 20) made a\r\n  confusion between Karábalgasun and Karákorum which has misled most\r\n  writers after him.\r\n\r\n  Sir Henry Yule says: “The evidence adduced in Abel Rémusat’s paper\r\n  on Karákorum (_Mém. de l’Acad. R. des Insc._ VII. 288) establishes\r\n  the site on the north bank of the Orkhon, and about five days’\r\n  journey above the confluence of the Orkhon and Tula. But as we have\r\n  only a very loose knowledge of these rivers, it is impossible to\r\n  assign the geographical position with accuracy. Nor is it likely\r\n  that ruins exist beyond an outline perhaps of the Kaan’s Palace\r\n  walls.”\r\n\r\n  In the _Geographical Magazine_ for July, 1874 (p. 137), Sir Henry\r\n  Yule has been enabled, by the kind aid of Madame Fedtchenko in\r\n  supplying a translation from the Russian, to give some account of\r\n  Mr. Paderin’s visit to the place, in the summer of 1873, along with\r\n  a sketch-map.\r\n\r\n  “The site visited by Mr. Paderin is shown, by the particulars\r\n  stated in that paper, to be sufficiently identified with Karákorum.\r\n  It is precisely that which Rémusat indicated, and which bears in\r\n  the Jesuit maps, as published by D’Anville, the name of _Talarho\r\n  Hara Palhassoun_ (_i.e._ Kará Balghásun), standing 4 or 5 miles from\r\n  the left bank of the Orkhon, in lat. (by the Jesuit Tables) 47° 32′\r\n  24″. It is now known as Kara-Khărăm (Rampart) or Kara Balghasun\r\n  (city). The remains consist of a quadrangular rampart of mud and\r\n  sun-dried brick, of about 500 paces to the side, and now about 9\r\n  feet high, with traces of a higher tower, and of an inner rampart\r\n  parallel to the other. But these remains probably appertain to the\r\n  city as re-occupied by the descendants of the Yuen in the end of\r\n  the 14th century, after their expulsion from China.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ I. p. 123) rightly observes: “It\r\n  seems, however, that Paderin is mistaken in his supposition.\r\n  At least it does not agree with the position assigned to the\r\n  ancient Mongol residence in the Mongol annals _Erdenin erikhe_,\r\n  translated into Russian, in 1883, by Professor Pozdneiev. It is\r\n  there positively stated (p. 110, note 2) that the monastery of\r\n  _Erdenidsu_, founded in 1585, was erected on the ruins of that\r\n  city, which once had been built by order of Ogotai Khan, and where\r\n  he had established his residence; and where, after the expulsion\r\n  of the Mongols from China, Toghon Temur again had fixed the Mongol\r\n  court. This vast monastery still exists, one English mile, or more,\r\n  east of the Orkhon. It has even been astronomically determined by\r\n  the Jesuit missionaries, and is marked on our maps of Mongolia.\r\n  Pozdneiev, who visited the place in 1877, obligingly informs\r\n  me that the square earthen wall surrounding the monastery of\r\n  Erdenidsu, and measuring about an English mile in circumference,\r\n  may well be the very wall of ancient Karákorum.”\r\n\r\n  Recent researches have fully confirmed the belief that the Erdeni\r\n  Tso, or Erdeni Chao, Monastery occupies the site of Karákorum, near\r\n  the bank of the Orkhon, between this river and the Kokchin (old)\r\n  Orkhon. (See map in _Inscriptions de l’Orkhon_, Helsingfors, 1892;\r\n  a plan of the vicinity and of the Erdeni Tso is given (plate 36) in\r\n  _W. Radloff’s Atlas der Alterthümer der Mongolei_, St. Pet., 1892.)\r\n\r\n  According to a work of the 13th century quoted by the late\r\n  Professor G. Devéria, the distance between the old capital of the\r\n  Uighúr, Kara Balgasún, on the left bank of the Orkhon, north of\r\n  Erdeni Tso, and the Ho-lin or Karákorum of the Mongols, would be\r\n  70 _li_ (about 30 miles), and such is the space between Erdeni\r\n  Tso and Kara Balgasún. M. Marcel Monnier (_Itinéraires_, p. 107)\r\n  estimates the bird’s-eye distance from Erdeni Tso to Kara Balgasún\r\n  at 33 kilom. (about 20½ miles). “When the brilliant epoch of the\r\n  power of the Chinghizkhanides,” says Professor Axel Heikel, “was\r\n  at an end, the city of Karákorum fell into oblivion, and towards\r\n  the year 1590 was founded, in the centre of this historically\r\n  celebrated region of the Orkhon, the most ancient of Buddhist\r\n  monasteries of Mongolia, this of Erdeni Tso [Erdeni Chao]. It was\r\n  built, according to a Mongol chronicle, on the ruins of the town\r\n  built by Okkodaï, son of Chinghiz Khan, that is to say, on the\r\n  ancient Karákorum.” (_Inscriptions de l’Orkhon_.) So Professor\r\n  Heikel, like Professor Pozdneiev, concludes that Erdeni Tso\r\n  was built on the site of Karákorum and cannot be mistaken for\r\n  Karabalgásun. Indeed it is highly probable that one of the walls of\r\n  the actual convent belonged to the old Mongol capital. The travels\r\n  and researches by expeditions from Finland and Russia have made\r\n  these questions pretty clear. Some most interesting inscriptions\r\n  have been brought home and have been studied by a number of\r\n  Orientalists: G. Schlegel, O. Donner, G. Devéria, Vasiliev, G. von\r\n  der Gabelentz, Dr. Hirth, G. Huth, E. H. Parker, W. Bang, etc., and\r\n  especially Professor Vilh. Thomsen, of Copenhagen, who deciphered\r\n  them (_Déchiffrement des Inscriptions de l’Orkhon et de l’Iénissei_,\r\n  Copenhague, 1894, 8vo; _Inscriptions de l’Orkhon déchiffrées,\r\n  par_ V. Thomsen, Helsingfors, 1894, 8vo), and Professor W. Radloff\r\n  of St. Petersburg (_Atlas der Alterthümer der Mongolei_, 1892–6,\r\n  fol.; _Die alttürkischen Inschriften der Mongolei_, 1894–7, etc.).\r\n  There is an immense literature on these inscriptions, and for the\r\n  bibliography, I must refer the reader to _H. Cordier, Etudes\r\n  Chinoises_ (1891–1894), Leide, 1895, 8vo. _Id._ (1895–1898), Leide,\r\n  1898, 8vo. The initiator of these discoveries was N. Iarindsev,\r\n  of Irkutsk, who died at Barnaoul in 1894, and the first great\r\n  expedition was started from Finland in 1890, under the guidance\r\n  of Professor Axel Heikel. (_Inscriptions de l’Orkhon recueillies\r\n  par l’expédition finnoise, 1890, et publiées par la Société\r\n  Finno-Ougrienne_, Helsingfors, 1892, fol.) The Russian expedition\r\n  left the following year, 1891, under the direction of the\r\n  Academician W. Radloff.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  M. Chaffanjon (_Nouv. Archiv. des Missions Scient._ IX., 1899, p.\r\n  81), in 1895, does not appear to know that there is a difference\r\n  between Kará Korum and Kará Balgásun, as he writes: “Forty\r\n  kilometres south of Kara Korum _or_ Kara Balgásun, the convent of\r\n  Erdin Zoun.”\r\n\r\n  A plan of Kara Balgásun is given (plate 27) in _Radloff’s Atlas_.\r\n  See also _Henri Cordier et Gaubil, Situation de Holin en Tartarie_,\r\n  Leide, 1893.\r\n\r\n  In Rubruquis’s account of Karákorum there is one passage of great\r\n  interest: “Then master William [Guillaume L’Orfèvre] had made for\r\n  us an iron to make wafers ... he made also a silver box to put\r\n  the body of Christ in, with relics in little cavities made in the\r\n  sides of the box.” Now M. Marcel Monnier, who is one of the last,\r\n  if not the last traveller who visited the region, tells me that he\r\n  found in the large temple of Erdeni Tso an iron (the cast bore a\r\n  Latin cross; had the wafer been Nestorian, the cross should have\r\n  been Greek) and a silver box, which are very likely the objects\r\n  mentioned by Rubruquis. It is a new proof of the identity of the\r\n  sites of Erdeni Tso and Karákorum.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Entrance to the Erdeni Tso Great Temple.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—[Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, 113, note) says: “The earliest\r\n  date to which I have been able to trace back the name Tartar is\r\n  A.D. 732. We find mention made in a Turkish inscription found on\r\n  the river Orkhon and bearing that date, of the _Tokuz Tatar_, or\r\n  ‘Nine (tribes of) Tatars,’ and of the _Otuz Tatar_, or ‘Thirty\r\n  (tribes of) Tatars.’ It is probable that these tribes were then\r\n  living between the Oguz or Uigúr Turks on the west, and the Kitan\r\n  on the east. (_Thomsen, Inscriptions de l’Orkhon_, 98, 126, 140.)\r\n  Mr. Thos. Watters tells me that the Tartars are first mentioned\r\n  by the Chinese in the period extending from A.D. 860 to 874; the\r\n  earliest mention I have discovered, however, is under date of\r\n  A.D. 880. (_Wu tai shih_, Bk. 4.) We also read in the same work\r\n  (Bk. 74, 2) that ‘The Ta-ta were a branch of the Mo-ho (the name\r\n  the Nû-chēn Tartars bore during the Sui and T’ang periods: _Ma\r\n  Tuan-lin_, Bk. 327, 5). They first lived to the north of the Kitan.\r\n  Later on they were conquered by this people, when they scattered, a\r\n  part becoming tributaries of the Kitan, another to the P’o-hai (a\r\n  branch of the Mo-ho), while some bands took up their abode in the\r\n  Yin Shan in Southern Mongolia, north of the provinces of Chih-li\r\n  and Shan-si, and took the name of _Ta-ta_.’ In 981 the Chinese\r\n  ambassador to the Prince of Kao-chang (Karakhodjo, some 20 miles\r\n  south-east of Turfan) traversed the Ta-ta country. They then seem\r\n  to have occupied the northern bend of the Yellow River. He gives\r\n  the names of some nine tribes of Ta-ta living on either side of\r\n  the river. He notes that their neighbours to the east were Kitan,\r\n  and that for a long time they had been fighting them after the\r\n  occupation of Kan-chou by the Uigúrs. (_Ma Tuan-lin_, Bk. 336,\r\n  12–14.) We may gather from this that these Tartars were already\r\n  settled along the Yellow River and the Yin Shan (the valley in\r\n  which is now the important frontier mart of Kwei-hua Ch’eng) at the\r\n  beginning of the ninth century, for the Uigúrs, driven southward\r\n  by the Kirghiz, first occupied Kan-chou in north-western Kan-suh,\r\n  somewhere about A.D. 842.”]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—CHORCHA (_Ciorcia_) is the Manchu country, whose people\r\n  were at that time called by the Chinese _Yuché_ or _Niuché_, and\r\n  by the Mongols _Churché_, or as it is in Sanang Setzen, _Jurchid_.\r\n  The country in question is several times mentioned by Rashiduddin\r\n  as Churché. The founders of the _Kin_ Dynasty, which the Mongols\r\n  superseded in Northern China, were of Churché race. [It was part of\r\n  Nayan’s appanage. (See Bk. II. ch. v.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The idea that a Christian potentate of enormous wealth\r\n  and power, and bearing this title, ruled over vast tracts in the\r\n  far East, was universal in Europe from the middle of the 12th to\r\n  the end of the 13th century, after which time the Asiatic story\r\n  seems gradually to have died away, whilst the Royal Presbyter\r\n  was assigned to a locus in Abyssinia; the equivocal application\r\n  of the term _India_ to the East of Asia and the East of Africa\r\n  facilitating this transfer. Indeed I have a suspicion, contrary\r\n  to the view now generally taken, that the term may from the first\r\n  have belonged to the Abyssinian Prince, though circumstances led to\r\n  its being applied in another quarter for a time. It appears to me\r\n  almost certain that the letter of Pope Alexander III., preserved\r\n  by R. Hoveden, and written in 1177 to the _Magnificus Rex Indorum,\r\n  Sacerdotum sanctissimus_, was meant for the King of Abyssinia.\r\n\r\n  Be that as it may, the inordinate report of Prester John’s\r\n  magnificence became especially diffused from about the year 1165,\r\n  when a letter full of the most extravagant details was circulated,\r\n  which purported to have been addressed by this potentate to the\r\n  Greek Emperor Manuel, the Roman Emperor Frederick, the Pope, and\r\n  other Christian sovereigns. By the circulation of this letter,\r\n  glaring fiction as it is, the idea of this Christian Conqueror\r\n  was planted deep in the mind of Europe, and twined itself round\r\n  every rumour of revolution in further Asia. Even when the din of\r\n  the conquests of Chinghiz began to be audible in the West, he was\r\n  invested with the character of a Christian King, and more or less\r\n  confounded with the mysterious Prester John.\r\n\r\n  The first notice of a conquering Asiatic potentate so styled had\r\n  been brought to Europe by the Syrian Bishop of Gabala (_Jibal_,\r\n  south of Laodicea in Northern Syria), who came, in 1145, to lay\r\n  various grievances before Pope Eugene III. He reported that not\r\n  long before a certain John, inhabiting the extreme East, king and\r\n  Nestorian priest, and claiming descent from the Three Wise Kings,\r\n  had made war on the _Samiard_ Kings of the Medes and Persians, and\r\n  had taken Ecbatana their capital. He was then proceeding to the\r\n  deliverance of Jerusalem, but was stopped by the Tigris, which he\r\n  could not cross, and compelled by disease in his host to retire.\r\n\r\n  M. d’Avezac first showed to whom this account must apply, and the\r\n  subject has more recently been set forth with great completeness\r\n  and learning by Dr. Gustavus Oppert. The conqueror in question was\r\n  the founder of Kara Khitai, which existed as a great Empire in\r\n  Asia during the last two-thirds of the 12th century. This chief\r\n  was a prince of the Khitan dynasty of Liao, who escaped with a\r\n  body of followers from Northern China on the overthrow of that\r\n  dynasty by the _Kin_ or Niuchen about 1125. He is called by the\r\n  Chinese historians Yeliu Tashi; by Abulghazi, Nuzi Taigri Ili;\r\n  and by Rashiduddin, Nushi (or Fushi) Taifu. Being well received\r\n  by the Uighúrs and other tribes west of the Desert who had been\r\n  subject to the Khitan Empire, he gathered an army and commenced\r\n  a course of conquest which eventually extended over Eastern and\r\n  Western Turkestan, including Khwarizm, which became tributary to\r\n  him. He took the title of _Gurkhan_, said to mean Universal or\r\n  Suzerain Khan, and fixed at Bala Sagun, north of the Thian Shan,\r\n  the capital of his Empire, which became known as _Kará_ (Black)\r\n  _Khitai_.[1] [The dynasty being named by the Chinese _Si-Liao_\r\n  (Western Liao) lasted till it was destroyed in 1218.—H. C.] In 1141\r\n  he came to the aid of the King of Khwarizm against _Sanjar_ the\r\n  Seljukian sovereign of Persia (whence the _Samiard_ of the Syrian\r\n  Bishop), who had just taken Samarkand, and defeated that prince\r\n  with great slaughter. Though the Gurkhan himself is not described\r\n  to have extended his conquests into Persia, the King of Khwarizm\r\n  followed up the victory by an invasion of that country, in which he\r\n  plundered the treasury and cities of Sanjar.\r\n\r\n  Admitting this Karacathayan prince to be the first conqueror (in\r\n  Asia, at all events) to whom the name of Prester John was applied,\r\n  it still remains obscure how that name arose. Oppert supposes that\r\n  _Gurkhan_ or _Kurkhan_, softened in West Turkish pronunciation\r\n  into _Yurkan_, was confounded with _Yochanan_ or _Johannes_; but\r\n  he finds no evidence of the conqueror’s profession of Christianity\r\n  except the fact, notable certainly, that the daughter of the last\r\n  of his brief dynasty is recorded to have been a Christian. Indeed,\r\n  D’Ohsson says that the first Gurkhan was a Buddhist, though on what\r\n  authority is not clear. There seems a probability at least that\r\n  it was an error in the original ascription of Christianity to the\r\n  Karacathayan prince, which caused the confusions as to the identity\r\n  of Prester John which appear in the next century, of which we shall\r\n  presently speak. Leaving this doubtful point, it has been plausibly\r\n  suggested that the title of Presbyter Johannes was connected with\r\n  the legends of the immortality of John the Apostle (ὁ πρεσβύτερος,\r\n  as he calls himself in the 2nd and 3rd epistles), and the belief\r\n  referred to by some of the Fathers that he would be the Forerunner\r\n  of our Lord’s second coming, as John the Baptist had been of His\r\n  first.\r\n\r\n  A new theory regarding the original Prester John has been\r\n  propounded by Professor Bruun of Odessa, in a Russian work entitled\r\n  _The Migrations of Prester John_. The author has been good enough\r\n  to send me large extracts of this essay in (French) translation;\r\n  and I will endeavour to set forth the main points as well as the\r\n  small space that can be given to the matter will admit. Some\r\n  remarks and notes shall be added, but I am not in a position to do\r\n  justice to Professor Bruun’s views, from the want of access to\r\n  some of his most important authorities, such as Brosset’s _History\r\n  of Georgia_, and its appendices.\r\n\r\n  It will be well, before going further, to give the essential\r\n  parts of the passage in the History of Bishop Otto of Freisingen\r\n  (referred to in vol i. p. 229), which contains the first allusion\r\n  to a personage styled Prester John:\r\n\r\n  “We saw also there [at Rome in 1145] the afore-mentioned Bishop of\r\n  Gabala, from Syria.... We heard him bewailing with tears the peril\r\n  of the Church beyond-sea since the capture of Edessa, and uttering\r\n  his intention on that account to cross the Alps and seek aid from\r\n  the King of the Romans and the King of the Franks. He was also\r\n  telling us how, not many years before, one JOHN, KING and PRIEST,\r\n  who dwells in the extreme Orient beyond Persia and Armenia, and\r\n  is (with his people) a Christian, but a Nestorian, had waged war\r\n  against the brother Kings of the Persians and Medes who are called\r\n  the Samiards, and had captured Ecbatana, of which we have spoken\r\n  above, the seat of their dominion. The said Kings having met him\r\n  with their forces made up of Persians, Medes, and Assyrians, the\r\n  battle had been maintained for 3 days, either side preferring\r\n  death to flight. But at last PRESBYTER JOHN (for so they are wont\r\n  to style him), having routed the Persians, came forth the victor\r\n  from a most sanguinary battle. After this victory (he went on to\r\n  say) the aforesaid John was advancing to fight in aid of the Church\r\n  at Jerusalem; but when he arrived at the Tigris, and found there\r\n  no possible means of transport for his army, he turned northward,\r\n  as he had heard that the river in that quarter was frozen over in\r\n  winter-time. Halting there for some years[2] in expectation of a\r\n  frost, which never came, owing to the mildness of the season, he\r\n  lost many of his people through the unaccustomed climate, and was\r\n  obliged to return homewards. This personage is said to be of the\r\n  ancient race of those Magi who are mentioned in the Gospel, and to\r\n  rule the same nations that they did, and to have such glory and\r\n  wealth that he uses (they say) only an emerald sceptre. It was\r\n  (they say) from his being fired by the example of his fathers, who\r\n  came to adore Christ in the cradle, that he was proposing to go to\r\n  Jerusalem, when he was prevented by the cause already alleged.”\r\n\r\n  Professor Bruun will not accept Oppert’s explanation, which\r\n  identifies this King and Priest with the Gur-Khan of Karacathay,\r\n  for whose profession of Christianity there is indeed (as has been\r\n  indicated—_supra_) no real evidence; who could not be said to have\r\n  made an attack upon any pair of brother Kings of the Persians and\r\n  the Medes, nor to have captured Ecbatana (a city, whatever its\r\n  identity, of Media); who could never have had any intention of\r\n  coming to Jerusalem; and whose geographical position in no way\r\n  suggested the mention of Armenia.\r\n\r\n  Professor Bruun thinks he finds a warrior much better answering\r\n  to the indications in the Georgian prince John Orbelian, the\r\n  general-in-chief under several successive Kings of Georgia in that\r\n  age.\r\n\r\n  At the time when the Gur-Khan defeated Sanjar the real brothers\r\n  of the latter had been long dead; Sanjar had withdrawn from\r\n  interference with the affairs of Western Persia; and Hamadán (if\r\n  this is to be regarded as Ecbatana) was no residence of his. But\r\n  it was the residence of Sanjar’s nephew Mas’úd, in whose hands was\r\n  now the dominion of Western Persia; whilst Mas’úd’s nephew, Dáúd,\r\n  held Media, _i.e._ Azerbeiján, Arrán, and Armenia. It is in these two\r\n  princes that Professor Bruun sees the _Samiardi fratres_ of the\r\n  German chronicler.\r\n\r\n  Again the expression “extreme Orient” is to be interpreted by local\r\n  usage. And with the people of Little Armenia, through whom probably\r\n  such intelligence reached the Bishop of Gabala, the expression the\r\n  _East_ signified specifically Great Armenia (which was then a part\r\n  of the kingdom of Georgia and Abkhasia), as Dulaurier has stated.[3]\r\n\r\n  It is true that the Georgians were not really Nestorians, but\r\n  followers of the Greek Church. It was the fact, however, that in\r\n  general, the Armenians, whom the Greeks accused of following\r\n  the Jacobite errors, retorted upon members of the Greek Church\r\n  with the reproach of the opposite heresy of Nestorianism. And the\r\n  attribution of Nestorianism to a Georgian Prince is, like the\r\n  expression “_extreme East_,” an indication of the Armenian channel\r\n  through which the story came.\r\n\r\n  The intention to march to the aid of the Christians in Palestine is\r\n  more like the act of a Georgian General than that of a Karacathayan\r\n  Khan; and there are in the history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem\r\n  several indications of the proposal at least of Georgian assistance.\r\n\r\n  The personage in question is said to have come from the country of\r\n  the Magi, from whom he was descended. But these have frequently\r\n  been supposed to come from Great Armenia. _E.g._ Friar Jordanus says\r\n  they came from Moghán.[4]\r\n\r\n  The name _Ecbatana_ has been so variously applied that it was\r\n  likely to lead to ambiguities. But it so happens that, in a\r\n  previous passage of his History, Bishop Otto of Freisingen, in\r\n  rehearsing some Oriental information gathered apparently from\r\n  the same Bishop of Gabala, has shown what was the place that he\r\n  had been taught to identify with Ecbatana, viz. the old Armenian\r\n  city of ANI.[5] Now this city was captured from the Turks, on\r\n  behalf of the King of Georgia, David the Restorer, by his great\r\n  _sbasalar_,[6] John Orbelian, in 1123–24.\r\n\r\n  Professor Bruun also lays stress upon a passage in a German\r\n  chronicle of date some years later than Otho’s work:\r\n\r\n  “1141. Liupoldus dux Bawariorum obiit, Henrico fratre ejus\r\n  succedente in ducatu. Iohannes Presbyter Rex Armeniæ et Indiæ cum\r\n  duobus regibus fratribus Persarum et Medorum pugnavit et vicit.”[7]\r\n\r\n  He asks how the Gur-Khan of Karakhitai could be styled King of\r\n  _Armenia_ and of India? It may be asked, _per contra_, how either\r\n  the King of Georgia or his _Peshwa_ (to use the Mahratta analogy\r\n  of John Orbelian’s position) could be styled King of Armenia and\r\n  of _India_? In reply to this, Professor Bruun adduces a variety of\r\n  quotations which he considers as showing that the term _India_ was\r\n  applied to some Caucasian region.\r\n\r\n  My own conviction is that the report of Otto of Freisingen is not\r\n  merely the _first mention_ of a great Asiatic potentate called\r\n  Prester John, but that his statement is the whole and sole basis\r\n  of good faith on which the story of such a potentate rested;\r\n  and I am quite as willing to believe, on due evidence, that the\r\n  nucleus of fact to which his statement referred, and on which such\r\n  a pile of long-enduring fiction was erected, occurred in Armenia\r\n  as that it occurred in Turan. Indeed in many respects the story\r\n  would thus be more comprehensible. One cannot attach any value\r\n  to the quotation from the Annalist in Pertz, because there seems\r\n  no reason to doubt that the passage is a mere adaptation of the\r\n  report by Bishop Otto, of whose work the Annalist makes other use,\r\n  as is indeed admitted by Professor Bruun, who (be it said) is a\r\n  pattern of candour in controversy. But much else that the Professor\r\n  alleges is interesting and striking. The fact that Azerbeijan and\r\n  the adjoining regions were known as “the East” is patent to the\r\n  readers of this book in many a page, where the Khan and his Mongols\r\n  in occupation of that region are styled by Polo _Lord of the_\r\n  LEVANT, _Tartars of the_ LEVANT (_i.e._ of the East), even when the\r\n  speaker’s standpoint is in far Cathay.[8] The mention of _Aní_ as\r\n  identical with the Ecbatana of which Otto had heard is a remarkable\r\n  circumstance which I think even Oppert has overlooked. That this\r\n  Georgian hero _was_ a Christian and that his name _was_ John are\r\n  considerable facts. Oppert’s conversion of Korkhan into Yokhanan\r\n  or John is anything but satisfactory. The identification proposed\r\n  again makes it quite intelligible how the so-called Prester John\r\n  should have talked about coming to the aid of the Crusaders; a\r\n  point so difficult to explain on Oppert’s theory, that he has been\r\n  obliged to introduce a duplicate John in the person of a Greek\r\n  Emperor to solve that knot; another of the weaker links in his\r\n  argument. In fact, Professor Bruun’s thesis seems to me more than\r\n  fairly successful in _paving the way_ for the introduction of a\r\n  Caucasian Prester John; the barriers are removed, the carpets are\r\n  spread, the trumpets sound royally—but the conquering hero comes\r\n  not!\r\n\r\n  He does very nearly come. The almost royal power and splendour of\r\n  the Orbelians at this time is on record: “They held the office of\r\n  _Sbasalar_ or Generalissimo of all Georgia. All the officers of the\r\n  King’s Palace were under their authority. Besides that they had\r\n  12 standards of their own, and under each standard 1000 warriors\r\n  mustered. As the custom was for the King’s flag to be white and the\r\n  pennon over it red, it was ruled that the Orpelian flag should be\r\n  red and the pennon white.... At banquets they alone had the right\r\n  to couches whilst other princes had cushions only. Their food was\r\n  served on silver; and to them it belonged to crown the kings.”[9]\r\n  Orpel Ivané, _i.e._ John Orbelian, Grand _Sbasalar_, was for years\r\n  the pride of Georgia and the hammer of the Turks. In 1123–1124 he\r\n  wrested from them Tiflis and the whole country up to the Araxes,\r\n  including _Ani_, as we have said. His King David, the Restorer,\r\n  bestowed on him large additional domains from the new conquests;\r\n  and the like brilliant service and career of conquest was continued\r\n  under David’s sons and successors, Demetrius and George; his later\r\n  achievements, however, and some of the most brilliant, occurring\r\n  after the date of the Bishop of Gabala’s visit to Rome. But still\r\n  we hear of no actual conflict with the chief princes of the\r\n  Seljukian house, and of no event in his history so important as to\r\n  account for his being made to play the part of Presbyter Johannes\r\n  in the story of the Bishop of Gabala. Professor Bruun’s most\r\n  forcible observation in reference to this rather serious difficulty\r\n  is that the historians have transmitted to us extremely little\r\n  detail concerning the reign of Demetrius II., and do not even agree\r\n  as to its duration. Carebat vate sacro: “It was,” says Brosset,\r\n  “long and glorious, but it lacked a commemorator.” If new facts\r\n  can be alleged, the identity may still be proved. But meantime the\r\n  conquests of the Gur-Khan and his defeat of Sanjar, just at a time\r\n  which suits the story, are indubitable, and this great advantage\r\n  Oppert’s thesis retains. As regards the claim to the title of\r\n  _Presbyter_ nothing worth mentioning is alleged on either side.\r\n\r\n  When the Mongol Conquests threw Asia open to Frank travellers in\r\n  the middle of the 13th century, their minds were full of Prester\r\n  John; they sought in vain for an adequate representative, but\r\n  it was not in the nature of things but they should find _some_\r\n  representative. In fact they found _several_. Apparently no\r\n  real tradition existed among the Eastern Christians of any such\r\n  personage, but the persistent demand produced a supply, and the\r\n  honour of identification with Prester John, after hovering over\r\n  one head and another, settled finally upon that of the King of the\r\n  Keraits, whom we find to play the part in our text.\r\n\r\n  Thus in Plano Carpini’s single mention of Prester John as the King\r\n  of the Christians of India the Greater, who defeats the Tartars\r\n  by an elaborate stratagem, Oppert recognizes Sultan Jaláluddín of\r\n  Khwarizm and his temporary success over the Mongols in Afghanistan.\r\n  In the Armenian Prince Sempad’s account, on the other hand, this\r\n  Christian King of India is _aided_ by the Tartars to defeat and\r\n  harass the neighbouring Saracens, his enemies, and becomes the\r\n  Mongol’s vassal. In the statement of Rubruquis, though distinct\r\n  reference is made to the conquering Gurkhan (under the name of\r\n  Coir Cham of Caracatay), the title of _King John_ is assigned to\r\n  the Naiman Prince (_Kushluk_), who had married the daughter of the\r\n  last lineal sovereign of Karakhitai, and usurped his power, whilst,\r\n  with a strange complication of confusion, UNC, Prince of the Crit\r\n  and Merkit (Kerait and Merkit, two great tribes of Mongolia)[10]\r\n  and Lord of Karákorum, is made the brother and successor of this\r\n  Naiman Prince. His version of the story, as it proceeds, has so\r\n  much resemblance to Polo’s, that we shall quote the words. The\r\n  Crit and Merkit, he says, were Nestorian Christians. “But their\r\n  Lord had abandoned the worship of Christ to follow idols, and kept\r\n  by him those priests of the idols who are all devil-raisers and\r\n  sorcerers. Beyond his pastures, at the distance of ten or fifteen\r\n  days’ journey, were the pastures of the MOAL (Mongol), who were a\r\n  very poor people, without a leader and without any religion except\r\n  sorceries and divinations, such as all the people of those parts\r\n  put so much faith in. Next to Moal was another poor tribe called\r\n  TARTAR. King John having died without an heir, his brother Unc got\r\n  his wealth, and caused himself to be proclaimed Cham, and sent out\r\n  his flocks and herds even to the borders of Moal. At that time\r\n  there was a certain blacksmith called Chinghis among the tribe of\r\n  Moal, and he used to lift the cattle of Unc Chan as often as he had\r\n  a chance, insomuch that the herdsmen of Unc Chan made complaint to\r\n  their master. The latter assembled an army, and invaded the land\r\n  of the Moal in search of Chinghis, but he fled and hid himself\r\n  among the Tartars. So Unc, having plundered the Moal and Tartars,\r\n  returned home. And Chinghis addressed the Tartars and Moal, saying:\r\n  ‘It is because we have no leader that we are thus oppressed by our\r\n  neighbours.’ So both Tartars and Moal made Chinghis himself their\r\n  leader and captain. And having got a host quietly together, he made\r\n  a sudden onslaught upon Unc and conquered him, and compelled him\r\n  to flee into Cathay. On that occasion his daughter was taken, and\r\n  given by Chinghis to one of his sons, to whom she bore Mangu, who\r\n  now reigneth.... The land in which they (the Mongols) first were,\r\n  and where the residence of Chinghis still exists, is called _Onan\r\n  Kerule_.[11] But because Caracoran is in the country which was\r\n  their first conquest, they regard it as a royal city, and there\r\n  hold the elections of their Chan.”\r\n\r\n  Here we see plainly that the Unc Chan of Rubruquis is the Unc Can\r\n  or Unecan of Polo. In the narrative of the former, Unc is only\r\n  _connected_ with King or Prester John; in that of the latter,\r\n  rehearsing the story as heard some 20 or 25 years later, the two\r\n  are _identified_. The shadowy _rôle_ of Prester John has passed\r\n  from the Ruler of Kara Khitai to the Chief of the Keraits. This\r\n  transfer brings us to another history.\r\n\r\n  We have already spoken of the extensive diffusion of Nestorian\r\n  Christianity in Asia during the early and Middle Ages. The\r\n  Christian historian Gregory Abulfaraj relates a curious history of\r\n  the conversion, in the beginning of the 11th century, of the King\r\n  of _Kerith_ with his people, dwelling in the remote north-east\r\n  of the land of the Turks. And that the Keraits continued to\r\n  profess Christianity down to the time of Chinghiz is attested\r\n  by Rashiduddin’s direct statement, as well as by the numerous\r\n  Christian princesses from that tribe of whom we hear in Mongol\r\n  history. It is the chief of this tribe of whom Rubruquis and Polo\r\n  speak under the name of Unc Khan, and whom the latter identifies\r\n  with Prester John. His proper name is called Tuli by the Chinese,\r\n  and Togrul by the Persian historians, but the Kin sovereign of\r\n  Northern China had conferred on him the title of _Wang_ or King,\r\n  from which his people gave him the slightly corrupted cognomen of\r\n  اونک خان, which some scholars read _Awang_, and _Avenk_ Khan, but\r\n  which the spelling of Rubruquis and Polo shows probably to have\r\n  been pronounced as _Aung_ or _Ung_ Khan.[12] The circumstance\r\n  stated by Rubruquis of his having abandoned the profession of\r\n  Christianity, is not alluded to by Eastern writers; but in any\r\n  case his career is not a credit to the Faith. I cannot find any\r\n  satisfactory corroboration of the claims of supremacy over the\r\n  Mongols which Polo ascribes to Aung Khan. But that his power\r\n  and dignity were considerable, appears from the term _Pádsháh_\r\n  which Rashiduddin applies to him. He had at first obtained the\r\n  sovereignty of the Keraits by the murder of two of his brothers\r\n  and several nephews. Yesugai, the father of Chinghiz, had been\r\n  his staunch friend, and had aided him effectually to recover his\r\n  dominion from which he had been expelled. After a reign of many\r\n  years he was again ejected, and in the greatest necessity sought\r\n  the help of Temujin (afterwards called Chinghiz Khan), by whom he\r\n  was treated with the greatest consideration. This was in 1196.\r\n  For some years the two chiefs conducted their forays in alliance,\r\n  but differences sprang up between them; the son of Aung Khan\r\n  entered into a plot to kill Temujin, and in 1202–1203 they were in\r\n  open war. The result will be related in connection with the next\r\n  chapters.\r\n\r\n  We may observe that the idea which Joinville picked up in the\r\n  East about Prester John corresponds pretty closely with that set\r\n  forth by Marco. Joinville represents him as one of the princes to\r\n  whom the Tartars were tributary in the days of their oppression,\r\n  and as “their ancient enemy”; one of their first acts, on being\r\n  organized under a king of their own, was to attack him and conquer\r\n  him, slaying all that bore arms, but sparing all monks and priests.\r\n  The expression used by Joinville in speaking of the original land\r\n  of the Tartars, “_une grande_ berrie _de sablon_,” has not been\r\n  elucidated in any edition that I have seen. It is the Arabic\r\n  بريه _Băríya_, “a Desert.” No doubt Joinville learned the word\r\n  in Palestine. (See _Joinville_, p. 143 _seqq._; see also _Oppert_,\r\n  _Der Presb. Johannes in Sage und Geschichte_, and _Cathay_, etc.,\r\n  pp. 173–182.) [_Fried. Zarncke, Der Priester Johannes; Cordier,\r\n  Odoric_.—H.

Res._) has a chapter on Kara-Khitaí\r\n    (I. 208 _seqq._) and in a long note on Bala Sagun, which he calls\r\n    Belasagun, he says (p. 226) that “according to the Tarikh Djihan\r\n    Kúshai (_d’Ohsson_, i. 433), the city of Belasagun had been founded\r\n    by Buku Khan, sovereign of the Uigurs, in a well-watered plain\r\n    of Turkestan with rich pastures. The Arabian geographers first\r\n    mention Belasagun, in the ninth or tenth century, as a city beyond\r\n    the Sihun or Yaxartes, depending on _Isfidjab_ (Sairam, according\r\n    to Lerch), and situated east of Taras. They state that the people\r\n    of Turkestan considered Belasagun to represent ‘the navel of the\r\n    earth,’ on account of its being situated in the middle between\r\n    east and west, and likewise between north and south.” (_Sprenger’s\r\n    Poststr. d. Or., Mavarannahar_). Dr. Bretschneider adds (p. 227):\r\n    “It is not improbable that ancient Belasagun was situated at the\r\n    same place where, according to the T’ang history, the Khan of one\r\n    branch of the Western T’u Kuë (Turks) had his residence in the\r\n    seventh century. It is stated in the T’ang shu that _Ibi Shabolo\r\n    Shehu Khan_, who reigned in the first half of the seventh century,\r\n    placed his ordo on the northern border of the river _Sui ye_. This\r\n    river, and a city of the same name, are frequently mentioned in the\r\n    T’ang annals of the seventh and eighth centuries, in connection\r\n    with the warlike expeditions of the Chinese in Central Asia. _Sui\r\n    ye_ was situated on the way from the river _Ili_ to the city of\r\n    Ta-lo-sz’ (Talas). In 679 the Chinese had built on the Sui ye River\r\n    a fortress; but in 748 they were constrained to destroy it.” (Comp.\r\n    _Visdelou_ in _Suppl. Bibl.

For the\r\n    same (privilege) that here in the city of Rome has been made over\r\n    to our chief Pontiff by the Christian Emperor, has there been\r\n    conceded to their High Priest by the Pagan Kings of Persia, to whom\r\n    Babylonia has for a long time been subject.

Finally, the place\r\n    which is now vulgarly called Babylonia, as I have mentioned, is not\r\n    upon the Euphrates (at all) as people suppose, but on the Nile,\r\n    about 6 days’ journey from Alexandria, and is the same as Memphis,\r\n    to which Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, anciently gave the name of\r\n    Babylon.”—Ottonis Frising.

And as\r\nsoon as the news that he had been chosen King was spread abroad through\r\nthose countries, all the Tartars in the world came to him and owned him\r\nfor their Lord. And right well did he maintain the Sovereignty they had\r\ngiven him. What shall I say? The Tartars gathered to him in astonishing\r\nmultitude, and when he saw such numbers he made a great furniture of\r\nspears and arrows and such other arms as they used, and set about the\r\nconquest of all those regions till he had conquered eight provinces.\r\nWhen he conquered a province he did no harm to the people or their\r\nproperty, but merely established some of his own men in the country\r\nalong with a proportion of theirs, whilst he led the remainder to the\r\nconquest of other provinces. And when those whom he had conquered\r\nbecame aware how well and safely he protected them against all others,\r\nand how they suffered no ill at his hands, and saw what a noble prince\r\nhe was, then they joined him heart and soul and became his devoted\r\nfollowers. And when he had thus gathered such a multitude that they\r\nseemed to cover the earth, he began to think of conquering a great\r\npart of the world. Now in the year of Christ 1200 he sent an embassy\r\nto Prester John, and desired to have his daughter to wife. But when\r\nPrester John heard that Chinghis Kaan demanded his daughter in marriage\r\nhe waxed very wroth, and said to the Envoys, “What impudence is this,\r\nto ask my daughter to wife! Wist he not well that he was my liegeman\r\nand serf? Get ye back to him and tell him that I had liever set my\r\ndaughter in the fire than give her in marriage to him, and that he\r\ndeserves death at my hand, rebel and traitor that he is!” So he bade\r\nthe Envoys begone at once, and never come into his presence again. The\r\nEnvoys, on receiving this reply, departed straightway, and made haste\r\nto their master, and related all that Prester John had ordered them to\r\nsay, keeping nothing back.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Temujin was born in the year 1155, according to all the\r\n  Persian historians, who are probably to be relied on; the Chinese\r\n  put the event in 1162. 1187 does not appear to be a date of special\r\n  importance in his history. His inauguration as sovereign under\r\n  the name of Chinghiz Kaan was in 1202 according to the Persian\r\n  authorities, in 1206 according to the Chinese.\r\n\r\n  In a preceding note (p. 236) we have quoted a passage in which\r\n  Rubruquis calls Chinghiz “a certain blacksmith.” This mistaken\r\n  notion seems to have originated in the resemblance of his name\r\n  _Temújin_ to the Turki _Temúrjí_, a blacksmith; but it was common\r\n  throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, and the story is to be found\r\n  not only in Rubruquis, but in the books of Hayton, the Armenian\r\n  prince, and of Ibn Batuta, the Moor. That cranky Orientalist, Dr.\r\n  Isaac Jacob Schmidt, positively reviles William Rubruquis, one of\r\n  the most truthful and delightful of travellers, and certainly not\r\n  inferior to his critic in mother-wit, for adopting this story,\r\n  and rebukes Timkowski—not for adopting it, but for merely telling\r\n  us the very interesting fact that the story was still, in 1820,\r\n  current in Mongolia. (_Schmidt’s San. Setz._ 376, and _Timkowski_,\r\n  I. 147.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Several historians, among others Abulfaraj, represent\r\n  Chinghiz as having married a daughter of Aung Khan; and this is\r\n  current among some of the mediæval European writers, such as\r\n  Vincent of Beauvais. It is also adopted by Pétis de la Croix in his\r\n  history of Chinghiz, apparently from a comparatively late Turkish\r\n  historian; and both D’Herbelot and St. Martin state the same; but\r\n  there seems to be no foundation for it in the best authorities:\r\n  either Persian or Chinese. (See _Abulfaragius_, p. 285; _Speculum\r\n  Historiale_, Bk. XXIX. ch. lxix.; _Hist. of Genghiz Can_, p. 29;\r\n  and _Golden Horde_, pp. 61–62.) But there is a real story at the\r\n  basis of Polo’s, which seems to be this: About 1202, when Aung Khan\r\n  and Chinghiz were still acting in professed alliance, a double\r\n  union was proposed between Aung Khan’s daughter Jaur Bigi and\r\n  Chinghiz’s son Juji, and between Chinghiz’s daughter Kijin Bigi and\r\n  Togrul’s grandson Kush Buka. From certain circumstances this union\r\n  fell through, and this was one of the circumstances which opened\r\n  the breach between the two chiefs. There were, however, several\r\n  marriages between the families. (_Erdmann_, 283; others are quoted\r\n  under ch. lix., note 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n           HOW CHINGHIS MUSTERED HIS PEOPLE TO MARCH AGAINST\r\n                             PRESTER JOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Chinghis Kaan heard the brutal message that Prester John had sent\r\nhim, such rage seized him that his heart came nigh to bursting within\r\nhim, for he was a man of a very lofty spirit. At last he spoke, and\r\nthat so loud that all who were present could hear him: “Never more\r\nmight he be prince if he took not revenge for the brutal message of\r\nPrester John, and such revenge that insult never in this world was so\r\ndearly paid for. And before long Prester John should know whether he\r\nwere his serf or no!”\r\n\r\nSo then he mustered all his forces, and levied such a host as never\r\nbefore was seen or heard of, sending word to Prester John to be on\r\nhis defence. And when Prester John had sure tidings that Chinghis was\r\nreally coming against him with such a multitude, he still professed to\r\ntreat it as a jest and a trifle, for, quoth he, “these be no soldiers.”\r\nNatheless he marshalled his forces and mustered his people, and made\r\ngreat preparations, in order that if Chinghis did come, he might take\r\nhim and put him to death. In fact he marshalled such an host of many\r\ndifferent nations that it was a world’s wonder.\r\n\r\nAnd so both sides gat them ready to battle. And why should I make a\r\nlong story of it? Chinghis Kaan with all his host arrived at a vast and\r\nbeautiful plain which was called TANDUC, belonging to Prester John, and\r\nthere he pitched his camp; and so great was the multitude of his people\r\nthat it was impossible to number them. And when he got tidings that\r\nPrester John was coming, he rejoiced greatly, for the place afforded\r\na fine and ample battle-ground, so he was right glad to tarry for him\r\nthere, and greatly longed for his arrival.\r\n\r\nBut now leave we Chinghis and his host, and let us return to Prester\r\nJohn and his people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n              HOW PRESTER JOHN MARCHED TO MEET CHINGHIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the story goes that when Prester John became aware that Chinghis\r\nwith his host was marching against him, he went forth to meet him with\r\nall his forces, and advanced until he reached the same plain of Tanduc,\r\nand pitched his camp over against that of Chinghis Kaan at a distance\r\nof 20 miles. And then both armies remained at rest for two days that\r\nthey might be fresher and heartier for battle.{1}\r\n\r\nSo when the two great hosts were pitched on the plains of Tanduc as you\r\nhave heard, Chinghis Kaan one day summoned before him his astrologers,\r\nboth Christians and Saracens, and desired them to let him know which\r\nof the two hosts would gain the battle, his own or Prester John’s. The\r\nSaracens tried to ascertain, but were unable to give a true answer;\r\nthe Christians, however, did give a true answer, and showed manifestly\r\nbeforehand how the event should be. For they got a cane and split\r\nit lengthwise, and laid one half on this side and one half on that,\r\nallowing no one to touch the pieces. And one piece of cane they called\r\n_Chinghis Kaan_, and the other piece they called _Prester John_. And\r\nthen they said to Chinghis: “Now mark! and you will see the event of\r\nthe battle, and who shall have the best of it; for whose cane soever\r\nshall get above the other, to him shall victory be.” He replied that he\r\nwould fain see it, and bade them begin. Then the Christian astrologers\r\nread a Psalm out of the Psalter, and went through other incantations.\r\nAnd lo! whilst all were beholding, the cane that bore the name of\r\nChinghis Kaan, without being touched by anybody, advanced to the other\r\nthat bore the name of Prester John, and got on the top of it. When the\r\nPrince saw that he was greatly delighted, and seeing how in this matter\r\nhe found the Christians to tell the truth, he always treated them with\r\ngreat respect, and held them for men of truth for ever after.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Polo in the preceding chapter has stated that this plain\r\n  of Tanduc was in Prester John’s country. He plainly regards it as\r\n  identical with the Tanduc of which he speaks more particularly in\r\n  ch. lix. as belonging to Prester John’s descendants, and which must\r\n  be located near the Chinese Wall. He is no doubt wrong in placing\r\n  the battle there. Sanang Setzen puts the battle between the two,\r\n  the only one which he mentions, “at the outflow of the Onon near\r\n  Kulen Buira.” The same action is placed by De Mailla’s authorities\r\n  at Calantschan, by P. Hyacinth at Kharakchin Schatu, by Erdmann\r\n  after Rashid in the vicinity of Hulun Barkat and Kalanchinalt,\r\n  which latter was on the borders of the Churché or Manchus. All this\r\n  points to the vicinity of Buir Nor and Hulan or Kalon Nor (though\r\n  the Onon is far from these). But this was _not_ the final defeat\r\n  of Aung Khan or Prester John, which took place some time later\r\n  (in 1203) at a place called the Chacher Ondur (or Heights), which\r\n  Gaubil places between the Tula and the Kerulun, therefore near the\r\n  modern Urga. Aung Khan was wounded, and fled over the frontier\r\n  of the Naiman; the officers of that tribe seized and killed him.\r\n  (_Schmidt_, 87, 383; _Erdmann_, 297; _Gaubil_, p. 10.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—A Tartar divination by twigs, but different from that\r\n  here employed, is older than Herodotus, who ascribes it to the\r\n  Scythians. We hear of one something like the last among the Alans,\r\n  and (from Tacitus) among the Germans. The words of Hosea (iv. 12),\r\n  “My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth\r\n  unto them,” are thus explained by Theophylactus: “They stuck up a\r\n  couple of sticks, whilst murmuring certain charms and incantations;\r\n  the sticks then, by the operation of devils, direct or indirect,\r\n  would fall over, and the direction of their fall was noted,” etc.\r\n  The Chinese method of divination comes still nearer to that in the\r\n  text. It is conducted by tossing in the air two symmetrical pieces\r\n  of wood or bamboo of a peculiar form. It is described by Mendoza,\r\n  and more particularly, with illustrations, by Doolittle.[1]\r\n\r\n  But Rubruquis would seem to have witnessed nearly the same process\r\n  that Polo describes. He reprehends the conjuring practices of the\r\n  Nestorian priests among the Mongols, who seem to have tried to\r\n  rival the indigenous _Káms_ or Medicine-men. Visiting the Lady\r\n  Kuktai, a Christian Queen of Mangu Kaan, who was ill, he says: “The\r\n  Nestorians were repeating certain verses, I know not what (they\r\n  said it was part of a Psalm), over two twigs which were brought\r\n  into contact in the hands of two men. The monk stood by during the\r\n  operation” (p. 326).[2] Pétis de la Croix quotes from Thévenot’s\r\n  travels, a similar mode of divination as much used, before a fight,\r\n  among the Barbary corsairs. Two men sit on the deck facing one\r\n  another and each holding two arrows by the points, and hitching\r\n  the notches of each pair of arrows into the other pair. Then the\r\n  ship’s writer reads a certain Arabic formula, and it is pretended\r\n  that whilst this goes on, the two sets of arrows, _of which one\r\n  represents the Turks and the other the Christians_, struggle\r\n  together in spite of the resistance of the holders, and finally\r\n  one rises over the other. This is perhaps the divination by arrows\r\n  which is prohibited in the Koran. (_Sura_, V. v. 92.) It is related\r\n  by Abulfeda that Mahomed found in the Kaaba an image of Abraham\r\n  with such arrows in his hand.\r\n\r\n  P. della Valle describes the same process, conducted by a Mahomedan\r\n  conjuror of Aleppo: “By his incantations he made the four points\r\n  of the arrows come together without any movement of the holders,\r\n  and by the way the points spontaneously placed themselves, obtained\r\n  answers to interrogatories.”\r\n\r\n  And Mr. Jaeschke writes from Lahaul: “There are many different\r\n  ways of divination practised among the Buddhists; and that also\r\n  mentioned by Marco Polo is known to our Lama, but in a slightly\r\n  different way, making use of _two arrows_ instead of a cane split\r\n  up, wherefore this kind is called _da-mo_, ‘Arrow-divination.’”\r\n  Indeed the practice is not extinct in India, for in 1833 Mr. Vigne\r\n  witnessed its application to detect the robber of a government\r\n  chest at Lodiana.\r\n\r\n  As regards Chinghiz’s respect for the Christians there are other\r\n  stories. Abulfaragius has one about Chinghiz seeing in a dream a\r\n  religious person who promised him success. He told the dream to\r\n  his wife, Aung Khan’s daughter, who said the description answered\r\n  to that of the bishop who used to visit her father. Chinghiz then\r\n  inquired for a bishop among the Uighúr Christians in his camp, and\r\n  they indicated Mar Denha. Chinghiz thenceforward was milder towards\r\n  the Christians, and showed them many distinctions (p. 285). Vincent\r\n  of Beauvais also speaks of Rabbanta, a Nestorian monk, who lived\r\n  in the confidence of Chinghiz’s wife, daughter of “the Christian\r\n  King David or Prester John,” and who used by divination to make\r\n  many revelations to the Tartars. We have already said that there\r\n  seems no ground for assigning a daughter of Aung Khan as wife to\r\n  Chinghiz. But there was a _niece_ of the former, named Abika, among\r\n  the wives of Chinghiz. And Rashiduddin _does_ relate a dream of the\r\n  Kaan’s in relation to her. But it was to the effect that he was\r\n  divinely commanded to give her away; and this he did next morning!\r\n\r\n  (_Rawlins. Herod._ IV. 67; _Amm.

The numbers that were slain on both sides were very\r\ngreat, but in the end Chinghis Kaan obtained the victory. And in the\r\nbattle Prester John was slain. And from that time forward, day by day,\r\nhis kingdom passed into the hands of Chinghis Kaan till the whole was\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A. Housselin D._\r\n\r\n  Death of Chinghiz Khan. (From a miniature in the _Livre des\r\n  Merveilles_.)]\r\n\r\nI may tell you that Chinghis Kaan reigned six years after this battle,\r\nengaged continually in conquest, and taking many a province and city\r\nand stronghold. But at the end of those six years he went against a\r\ncertain castle that was called CAAJU, and there he was shot with an\r\narrow in the knee, so that he died of his wound. A great pity it was,\r\nfor he was a valiant man and a wise.{1}\r\n\r\nI will now tell you who reigned after Chinghis, and then about the\r\nmanners and customs of the Tartars.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Chinghiz in fact survived Aung Khan some 24 years, dying\r\n  during his fifth expedition against Tangut, 18th August 1227, aged\r\n  65 according to the Chinese accounts, 72 according to the Persian.\r\n  Sanang Setzen says that Kurbeljin Goa Khatún, the beautiful Queen\r\n  of Tangut, who had passed into the tents of the conqueror, did\r\n  him some bodily mischief (it is not said what), and then went and\r\n  drowned herself in the Karamuren (or Hwang-ho), which thenceforth\r\n  was called by the Mongols the _Khátún-gol_, or Lady’s River, a name\r\n  which it in fact still bears. Carpini relates that Chinghiz was\r\n  killed by lightning. The Persian and Chinese historians, however,\r\n  agree in speaking of his death as natural. Gaubil calls the place\r\n  of his death Lou-pan, which he says was in lat. 38°. Rashiduddin\r\n  calls it Leung-Shan, which appears to be the mountain range still\r\n  so called in the heart of Shensi.\r\n\r\n  The name of the place before which Polo represents him as mortally\r\n  wounded is very variously given. According to Gaubil, Chinghiz\r\n  was in reality dangerously wounded by an arrow-shot at the siege\r\n  of Taitongfu in 1212. And it is possible, as Oppert suggests,\r\n  that Polo’s account of his death before _Caagiu_ (as I prefer\r\n  the reading), arose out of a confusion between this circumstance\r\n  and those of the death of _Mangku Kaan_, which is said to have\r\n  occurred at the assault of HOCHAU in Sze-ch’uan, a name which Polo\r\n  would write _Caagiu_, or nearly so. Abulfaragius specifically says\r\n  that Mangku Kaan died _by an arrow_; though it is true that other\r\n  authors say he died of disease, and Haiton that he was drowned;\r\n  all which shows how excusable were Polo’s errors as to events\r\n  occurring 50 to 100 years before his time. (See _Oppert’s Presbyter\r\n  Johannes_, p. 76; _De Mailla_, IX. 275, and note; _Gaubil_, 18, 50,\r\n  52, 121; _Erdmann_, 443; _San. Setzen_, 103.)\r\n\r\n  It is only by referring back to ch. xlvii., where we are told that\r\n  Chinghiz “began to think of conquering a great part of the world,”\r\n  that we see Polo to have been really aware of the vast extent and\r\n  aim of the conquests of Chinghiz; the _aim_ being literally the\r\n  conquest of the world as he conceived it; the _extent_ of the\r\n  empire which he initiated actually covering (probably) one half of\r\n  the whole number of the human race. (See remarks in _Koeppen, Die\r\n  Relig. des Buddha_, II. 86.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n        OF THOSE WHO DID REIGN AFTER CHINGHIS KAAN, AND OF THE\r\n                        CUSTOMS OF THE TARTARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the next that reigned after Chinghis Kaan, their first Lord,{1}\r\nwas CUY KAAN, and the third Prince was BATUY KAAN, and the fourth was\r\nALACOU KAAN, the fifth MONGOU KAAN, the sixth CUBLAY KAAN, who is the\r\nsovereign now reigning, and is more potent than any of the five who\r\nwent before him; in fact, if you were to take all those five together,\r\nthey would not be so powerful as he is.{2} Nay, I will say yet more;\r\nfor if you were to put together all the Christians in the world, with\r\ntheir Emperors and their Kings, the whole of these Christians,—aye, and\r\nthrow in the Saracens to boot,—would not have such power, or be able to\r\ndo so much as this Cublay, who is the Lord of all the Tartars in the\r\nworld, those of the Levant and of the Ponent included; for these are\r\nall his liegemen and subjects. I mean to show you all about this great\r\npower of his in this book of ours.\r\n\r\nYou should be told also that all the Grand Kaans, and all the\r\ndescendants of Chinghis their first Lord, are carried to a mountain\r\nthat is called ALTAY to be interred. Wheresoever the Sovereign may die,\r\nhe is carried to his burial in that mountain with his predecessors;\r\nno matter an the place of his death were 100 days’ journey distant,\r\nthither must he be carried to his burial.{3}\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a strange thing too. When they are carrying the body\r\nof any Emperor to be buried with the others, the convoy that goes with\r\nthe body doth put to the sword all whom they fall in with on the road,\r\nsaying: “Go and wait upon your Lord in the other world!” For they do in\r\nsooth believe that all such as they slay in this manner do go to serve\r\ntheir Lord in the other world. They do the same too with horses; for\r\nwhen the Emperor dies, they kill all his best horses, in order that\r\nhe may have the use of them in the other world, as they believe. And\r\nI tell you as a certain truth, that when Mongou Kaan died, more than\r\n20,000 persons, who chanced to meet the body on its way, were slain in\r\nthe manner I have told.{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Before parting with Chinghiz let me point out what has\r\n  not to my knowledge been suggested before, that the name of\r\n  “_Cambuscan_ bold” in Chaucer’s tale is only a corruption of the\r\n  name of Chinghiz. The name of the conqueror appears in Fr. Ricold\r\n  as _Camiuscan_, from which the transition to Cambuscan presents no\r\n  difficulty. _Camius_ was, I suppose, a clerical corruption out of\r\n  _Canjus_ or _Cianjus_. In the chronicle of St. Antonino, however,\r\n  we have him called “_Chinghiscan rectius_ Tamgius _Cam_” (XIX. c.\r\n  8). If this is not merely the usual blunder of _t_ for _c_, it\r\n  presents a curious analogy to the form _Tankiz Khán_ always used\r\n  by Ibn Batuta. I do not know the origin of the latter, unless it\r\n  was suggested by _tankis_ (Ar.) “Turning upside down.” (See _Pereg.\r\n  Quat._, p. 119; _I. B._ III. 22, etc.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Polo’s history here is inadmissible. He introduces into\r\n  the list of the supreme Kaans _Batu_, who was only Khan of Kipchak\r\n  (the Golden Horde), and _Hulaku_ who was Khan of Persia, whilst he\r\n  omits _Okkodai_, the immediate successor of Chinghiz. It is also\r\n  remarkable that he uses the form _Alacou_ here instead of _Alaü_\r\n  as elsewhere; nor does he seem to mean the same person, for he\r\n  was quite well aware that _Alaü_ was Lord of the Levant, who sent\r\n  ambassadors to the Great Khan Cúbláy, and could not therefore be\r\n  one of his predecessors. The real succession ran: 1. Chinghiz; 2.\r\n  Okkodai; 3. Kuyuk; 4. Mangku; 5. Kúblái.\r\n\r\n  There are quite as great errors in the history of Haiton, who had\r\n  probably greater advantages in this respect than Marco. And I may\r\n  note that in Teixeira’s abridgment of Mirkhond, Hulaku is made to\r\n  succeed Mangku Kaan on the throne of Chinghiz. (_Relaciones_, p.\r\n  338.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The ALTAI here certainly does not mean the Great South\r\n  Siberian Range to which the name is now applied. Both _Altai_ and\r\n  _Altun-Khan_ appear sometimes to be applied by Sanang Setzen to\r\n  the Khingan of the Chinese, or range running immediately north\r\n  of the Great Wall near Kalgan. (See ch. lxi. note 1.) But in\r\n  reference to this matter of the burial of Chinghiz, he describes\r\n  the place as “the district of Yekeh Utek, between the shady side\r\n  of the Altai-Khan and the sunny side of the Kentei-Khan.” Now the\r\n  Kentei-Khan (_khan_ here meaning “mountain”) is near the sources\r\n  of the Onon, immediately to the north-east of Urga; and Altai-Khan\r\n  in this connection cannot mean the hills near the Great Wall, 500\r\n  miles distant.\r\n\r\n  According to Rashiduddin, Chinghiz was buried at a place called\r\n  _Búrkán Káldún_ (“God’s Hill”), or _Yekeh Kúrúk_ (“The Great Sacred\r\n  or Tabooed Place”); in another passage he calls the spot _Búdah\r\n  Undúr_ (which means, I fancy, the same as Búrkán Káldún), near the\r\n  River Selenga. Búrkán Káldún is often mentioned by Sanang Setzen,\r\n  and Quatremère seems to demonstrate the identity of this place\r\n  with the mountain called by Pallas (and Timkowski) _Khanoolla_.\r\n  This is a lofty mountain near Urga, covered with dense forest,\r\n  and is indeed the first woody mountain reached in travelling from\r\n  Peking. It is still held sacred by the Mongols and guarded from\r\n  access, though the tradition of Chinghiz’s grave seems to be\r\n  extinct. Now, as this Khanoolla (“Mount Royal,” for _khan_ here\r\n  means “sovereign,” and _oolla_ “mountain”) stands immediately\r\n  to the south of the _Kentei_ mentioned in the quotation from S.\r\n  Setzen, this identification agrees with his statement, on the\r\n  supposition that the Khanoolla is the Altai of the same quotation.\r\n  The Khanoolla must also be the _Han_ mountain which Mongol chiefs\r\n  claiming descent from Chinghiz named to Gaubil as the burial-place\r\n  of that conqueror. Note that the Khanoolla, which we suppose to be\r\n  the Altai of Polo, and here of Sanang Setzen, belongs to a range\r\n  known as _Khingan_, whilst we see that Setzen elsewhere applies\r\n  Altai and Altan-Khan to the other Khingan near the Great Wall.\r\n\r\n  Erdmann relates, apparently after Rashiduddin, that Chinghiz was\r\n  buried at the foot of a tree which had taken his fancy on a hunting\r\n  expedition, and which he had then pointed out as the place where he\r\n  desired to be interred. It was then conspicuous, but afterwards the\r\n  adjoining trees shot up so rapidly, that a dense wood covered the\r\n  whole locality, and it became impossible to identify the spot. (_Q.\r\n  R._ 117 _seqq._; _Timk._ I. 115 _seqq._, II. 475–476; _San. Setz._\r\n  103, 114–115, 108–109; _Gaubil_, 54; _Erd._ 444.)\r\n\r\n  [“There are no accurate indications,” says Palladius (_l.c._ pp.\r\n  11–13), “in the documents of the Mongol period on the burial-places\r\n  of Chingiz Khan and of the Khans who succeeded him. The _Yuan-shi_\r\n  or ‘History of the Mongol Dynasty in China,’ in speaking of the\r\n  burial of the Khans, mentions only that they used to be conveyed\r\n  from Peking to the north, to their common burial-ground in the\r\n  _K’i-lien_ Valley. This name cannot have anything in common with\r\n  the ancient _K’i-lien_ of the Hiung-nu, a hill situated to the west\r\n  of the Mongol desert; the _K’i-lien_ of the Mongols is to be sought\r\n  more to the east. When Khubilai marched out against Prince Nayan,\r\n  and reached the modern Talnor, news was received of the occupation\r\n  of the Khan’s burial-ground by the rebels. They held out there very\r\n  long, which exceedingly afflicted Khubilai [_Yüan shi lui pien_];\r\n  and this goes to prove that the tombs could not be situated much\r\n  to the west. Some more positive information on this subject is\r\n  found in the diary of the campaign in Mongolia in 1410, of the\r\n  Ming Emperor Yung-lo [_Pe ching lu_]. He reached the Kerulen at\r\n  the place where this river, after running south, takes an easterly\r\n  direction. The author of the diary notes, that from a place one\r\n  march and a half before reaching the Kerulen, a very large mountain\r\n  was visible to the north-east, and at its foot a solitary high\r\n  and pointed hillock, covered with stones. The author says, that\r\n  the sovereigns of the house of Yuan used to be buried near this\r\n  hill. It may therefore be plausibly supposed that the tombs of the\r\n  Mongol Khans were near the Kerulen, and that the ‘K’i-lien’ of the\r\n  _Yüan shi_ is to be applied to this locality; it seems to me even,\r\n  that K’i-lien is an abbreviation, customary to Chinese authors, of\r\n  Kerulen. The way of burying the Mongol Khans is described in the\r\n  _Yüan shi_ (ch. ‘On the national religious rites of the Mongols’),\r\n  as well as in the _Ch’ue keng lu_, ‘Memoirs of the time of the Yuan\r\n  Dynasty.’ When burying, the greatest care was taken to conceal\r\n  from outside people the knowledge of the locality of the tomb.\r\n  With this object in view, after the tomb was closed, a drove of\r\n  horses was driven over it, and by this means the ground was, for a\r\n  considerable distance, trampled down and levelled. It is added to\r\n  this (probably from hearsay) in the _Ts’ao mu tze Memoirs_ (also\r\n  of the time of the Yuan Dynasty), that a young camel used to be\r\n  killed (in the presence of its mother) on the tomb of the deceased\r\n  Khan; afterwards, when the time of the usual offerings of the tomb\r\n  approached, the mother of this immolated camel was set at liberty,\r\n  and she came crying to the place where it was killed; the locality\r\n  of the tomb was ascertained in this way.”\r\n\r\n  The Archimandrite Palladius adds in a footnote: “Our well-known\r\n  Mongolist N. Golovkin has told us, that according to a story\r\n  actually current among the Mongols, the tombs of the former Mongol\r\n  Khans are situated near Tasola Hill, equally in the vicinity of the\r\n  Kerulen. He states also that even now the Mongols are accustomed\r\n  to assemble on that hill on the seventh day of the seventh moon\r\n  (according to an ancient custom), in order to adore Chingiz Khan’s\r\n  tomb. Altan tobchi (translated into Russian by Galsan Gomboeff),\r\n  in relating the history of the Mongols after their expulsion\r\n  from China, and speaking of the Khans’ tombs, calls them _Naiman\r\n  tzagan gher_, _i.e._ ‘Eight White Tents’ (according to the number of\r\n  chambers for the souls of the chief deceased Khans in Peking), and\r\n  sometimes simply _Tzagan gher_, ‘the White Tent,’ which, according\r\n  to the translator’s explanation, denotes only Chingiz Khan’s tomb.”\r\n\r\n  “According to the Chinese Annals (_T’ung kien kang mu_), quoted\r\n  by Dr. E. Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ I. p. 157), Chinghiz died\r\n  near the _Liu p’an shan_ in 1227, after having subdued the Tangut\r\n  empire. On modern Chinese maps _Liu p’an shan_ is marked south of\r\n  the city of _Ku yüan chou_, department of _P’ing liang_, in _Kan\r\n  suh_. The _Yüan shi_ however, implies that he died in Northern\r\n  Mongolia. We read there, in the annals, _s.a._ 1227, that in the\r\n  fifth intercalary month the Emperor moved to the mountain _Liu p’an\r\n  shan_ in order to avoid the heat of the summer. In the sixth month\r\n  the empire of the _Hia_ (Tangut) submitted. Chinghiz rested on the\r\n  river _Si Kiang_ in the district of _Ts’ing shui_ (in Kansuh; it\r\n  has still the same name). In autumn, in the seventh month (August),\r\n  on the day _jen wu_, the Emperor fell ill, and eight days later\r\n  died in his palace _Ha-lao-t’u_ on the River _Sa-li_. This river\r\n  Sali is repeatedly mentioned in the _Yüan shi_, viz. in the first\r\n  chapter, in connection with the first military doings of Chinghiz.\r\n  Rashid reports (_D’Ohsson_, I. 58) that Chinghiz in 1199 retired\r\n  to his residence _Sari Kihar_. The _Yüan chao pi shi_ (Palladius’\r\n  transl., 81) writes the same name _Saari Keher_ (_Keher_ in modern\r\n  Mongol means ‘a plain’). On the ancient map of Mongolia found\r\n  in the _Yüan shi lei pien_, _Sa-li K’ie-rh_ is marked south of\r\n  the river _Wa-nan_ (the _Onon_ of our maps), and close to _Sa-li\r\n  K’ie-rh_ we read: ‘Here was the original abode of the Yüan’\r\n  (Mongols). Thus it seems the passage in the Yüan history translated\r\n  above intimates that Chinghiz died in Mongolia, and not near the\r\n  _Liu p’an shan_, as is generally believed. The _Yüan ch’ao pi shi_\r\n  (Palladius’ transl., 152) and the _’Ts’in cheng lu_ (Palladius’\r\n  transl., 195) both agree in stating that, after subduing the Tangut\r\n  empire, Chinghiz returned home, and then died. Colonel Yule, in\r\n  his _Marco Polo_ (I. 245), states ‘that Rashid calls the place of\r\n  Chinghiz’ death _Leung shan_, which appears to be the mountain\r\n  range still so-called in the heart of Shensi.’ I am not aware\r\n  from what translation of Rashid, Yule’s statement is derived,\r\n  but d’Ohsson (I. 375, note) seems to quote the same passage in\r\n  translating from Rashid: ‘_Liu-p’an-shan_ was situated on the\r\n  frontiers of the _Churche_ (empire of the _Kin_), _Nangias_ (empire\r\n  of the _Sung_) and _Tangut_;’ which statement is quite correct.”\r\n\r\n  We now come to the Mongol tradition, which places the tomb of\r\n  Chinghiz in the country of the Ordos, in the great bend of the\r\n  Yellow River.\r\n\r\n  Two Belgian missionaries, MM. de Vos and Verlinden, who visited\r\n  the tomb of Chinghiz Khan, say that before the Mahomedan invasion,\r\n  on a hill a few feet high, there were two courtyards, one in front\r\n  of the other, surrounded by palisades. In the second courtyard,\r\n  there were a building like a Chinese dwelling-house and six tents.\r\n  In a double tent are kept the remains of the _bokta_ (the Holy).\r\n  The neighbouring tents contained various precious objects, such\r\n  as a gold saddle, dishes, drinking-cups, a tripod, a kettle, and\r\n  many other utensils, all in solid silver. (_Missions Catholiques_,\r\n  No. 315, 18th June, 1875.)—This periodical gives (p. 293) a sketch\r\n  of the tomb of the Conqueror, according to the account of the two\r\n  missionaries.\r\n\r\n  Prjevalsky (_Mongolia and Tangut_) relates the story of the _Khatún\r\n  Gol_ (see _supra_, p. 245), and says that her tomb is situated at 11\r\n  versts north-east of lake of Dzaïdemin Nor, and is called by the\r\n  Mongols Tumir-Alku, and by the Chinese Djiou-Djin Fu; one of the\r\n  legends mentioned by the Russian traveller gives the Ordo country\r\n  as the burial-place of Chinghiz, 200 versts south of lake Dabasun\r\n  Nor; the remains are kept in two coffins, one of wood, the other of\r\n  silver; the Khan prophesied that after eight or ten centuries he\r\n  would come to life again and fight the Emperor of China, and being\r\n  victorious, would take the Mongols from the Ordos back to their\r\n  country of Khalka; Prjevalsky did not see the tomb, nor did Potanin.\r\n\r\n  “Their holiest place [of the Mongols of Ordos] is a collection of\r\n  felt tents called ‘Edjen-joro,’ reputed to contain the bones of\r\n  Jenghiz Khan. These sacred relics are entrusted to the care of a\r\n  caste of Darhats, numbering some fifty families. Every summer, on\r\n  the twenty-first day of the sixth moon, sacrifices are offered\r\n  up in his honour, when numbers of people congregate to join in\r\n  the celebration, such gatherings being called _táilgan_.” On the\r\n  southern border of the Ordos are the ruins of Boro-balgasun [Grey\r\n  town], said to date from Jenghiz Khan’s time. (_Potanin_, _Proc. R.\r\n  G. S._ IX. 1887, p. 233.)\r\n\r\n  The last traveller who visited the tomb of Chinghiz is M. C. E.\r\n  Bonin, in July 1896; he was then on the banks of the Yellow River\r\n  in the northern part of the Ordo country, which is exclusively\r\n  inhabited by nomadic and pastoral Mongols, forming seven tribes or\r\n  hords, Djungar, Talat, Wan, Ottok, Djassak, Wushun and Hangkin,\r\n  among which are eastward the Djungar and in the centre the Wan;\r\n  according to their own tradition, these tribes descend from the\r\n  seven armies encamped in the country at the time of Chinghiz’s\r\n  death; the King of Djungar was 67 years of age, and was the chief\r\n  of all the tribes, being considered the 37th descendant of the\r\n  conqueror in a direct line. His predecessor was the Wushun Wang. M.\r\n  Bonin gives (_Revue de Paris_, 15th February 1898) the following\r\n  description of the tomb and of the country surrounding it. Between\r\n  the _yamen_ (palace) of the King (Wang) of Djungar and the tomb\r\n  of Chinghiz-Khan, there are five or six marches made difficult by\r\n  the sands of the Gobi, but horses and camels may be used for the\r\n  journey. The road, southward through the desert, passes near the\r\n  great lama-monastery called _Barong-tsao_ or _Si-tsao_ (Monastery\r\n  of the West), and in Chinese _San-t’ang sse_ (Three Temples). This\r\n  celebrated monastery was built by the King of Djungar to hold\r\n  the tablets of his ancestors—on the ruins of an old temple, said\r\n  to have been erected by Chinghiz himself. More than a thousand\r\n  lamas are registered there, forty of them live at the expense of\r\n  the Emperor of China. Crossing afterwards the two upper branches\r\n  of the Ulan Muren (Red River) on the banks of which Chinghiz was\r\n  murdered, according to local tradition, close to the lake of\r\n  Chahan Nor (White Lake), near which are the tents of the Prince\r\n  of Wan, one arrives at last at the spot called _Yeke-Etjen-Koro_,\r\n  in Mongol: the abode of the Great Lord, where the tomb is to be\r\n  found. It is erected to the south-east of the village, comprising\r\n  some twenty tents or tent-like huts built of earth. Two large white\r\n  felt tents, placed side by side, similar to the tents of the modern\r\n  Mongols, but much larger, cover the tomb; a red curtain, when\r\n  drawn, discloses the large and low silver coffin, which contains\r\n  the ashes of the Emperor, placed on the ground of the second tent;\r\n  it is shaped like a big trunk, with great rosaces engraved upon it.\r\n  The Emperor, according to local tradition, was cremated on the bank\r\n  of the Ulan Muren, where he is supposed to have been slain. On the\r\n  twenty-first day of the third moon the anniversary fête of Mongolia\r\n  takes place; on this day of the year only are the two mortuary\r\n  tents opened, and the coffin is exhibited to be venerated by people\r\n  coming from all parts of Mongolia. Many other relics, dispersed\r\n  all over the Ordo land, are brought thither on this occasion;\r\n  these relics called in Mongol _Chinghiz Bogdo_ (Sacred remains\r\n  of Chinghiz) number ten; they are in the order adopted by the\r\n  Mongols: the saddle of Chinghiz, hidden in the Wan territory; the\r\n  bow, kept at a place named Hu-ki-ta-lao Hei, near Yeke-Etjen-Koro;\r\n  the remains of his war-horse, called Antegan-tsegun (more),\r\n  preserved at Kebere in the Djungar territory; a fire-arm kept in\r\n  the palace of the King of Djungar; a wooden and leather vase called\r\n  Pao-lao-antri, kept at the place Shien-ni-chente; a wax figure\r\n  containing the ashes of the Khan’s equerry, called Altaqua-tosu,\r\n  kept at Ottok (one of the seven tribes); the remains of the second\r\n  wife, who lay at Kiasa, on the banks of the Yellow River, at a\r\n  place called on Prjevalsky’s map in Chinese Djiou-Djin-fu, and in\r\n  Mongol Tumir-Alku; the tomb of the third wife of Chinghiz, who\r\n  killed him, and lay to-day at Bagha-Ejen-Koro, “the abode of the\r\n  little Sovereign,” at a day’s march to the south of the Djungar\r\n  King’s palace; the very tomb of Yeke-Etjen-Koro, which is supposed\r\n  to contain also the ashes of the first wife of the Khan; and last,\r\n  his great standard, a black wood spear planted in the desert, more\r\n  than 150 miles to the south of the tomb; the iron of it never gets\r\n  rusty; no one dares touch it, and therefore it is not carried to\r\n  Yeke-Etjen-Koro with the other relics for the yearly festival. (See\r\n  also _Rockhill, Diary_, p. 29.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Rashiduddin relates that the escort, in carrying Chinghiz\r\n  to his burial, slew all whom they met, and that forty noble and\r\n  beautiful girls were despatched to serve him in the other world, as\r\n  well as superb horses. As Mangku Kaan died in the heart of China,\r\n  any attempt to carry out the barbarous rule in his case would\r\n  involve great slaughter. (_Erd._ 443; _D’Ohsson_, I. 381, II. 13;\r\n  and see _Cathay_, 507–508.)\r\n\r\n  Sanang Setzen ignores these barbarities. He describes the body of\r\n  Chinghiz as removed to his native land on a two-wheeled waggon, the\r\n  whole host escorting it, and wailing as they went: “And Kiluken\r\n  Bahadur of the Sunid Tribe (one of the Khan’s old comrades) lifted\r\n  up his voice and sang—\r\n\r\n      ‘Whilom Thou didst swoop like a Falcon: A rumbling waggon now\r\n           trundles thee off:\r\n                                                 O My King!\r\n       Hast thou in truth then forsaken thy wife and thy children\r\n           and the Diet of thy People?\r\n                                                 O My King!\r\n       Circling in pride like an Eagle whilom Thou didst lead us,\r\n                                                 O My King!\r\n       But now Thou hast stumbled and fallen, like an unbroken Colt,\r\n                                                 O My King!’” (p. 108.)\r\n\r\n  [“The burying of living men with the dead was a general custom\r\n  with the tribes of Eastern Asia. Favourite servants and wives\r\n  were usually buried in this way. In China, the chief wives and\r\n  those concubines who had already borne children, were exempted\r\n  from this lot. The Tunguz and other tribes were accustomed to kill\r\n  the selected victims by strangulation. In China they used to be\r\n  buried alive; but the custom of burying living men ceased in A.D.\r\n  1464. [_Hwang ming ts’ung sin lu_.] In the time of the present\r\n  Manchu Dynasty, the burying of living men was prohibited by the\r\n  Emperor Kang-hi, at the close of the 17th century, _i.e._ the forced\r\n  burying; but voluntary sepulture remained in force [_Yu chi wen_].\r\n  Notwithstanding this prohibition, cases of forced burying occurred\r\n  again in remote parts of Manchuria; when a concubine refused to\r\n  follow her deceased master, she was forcibly strangled with a\r\n  bow-string [_Ninguta chi_]. I must observe, however, that there is\r\n  no mention made in historical documents of the existence of this\r\n  custom with the Mongols; it is only an hypothesis based on the\r\n  analogy between the religious ideas and customs of the Mongols and\r\n  those of other tribes.” (_Palladius_, p. 13.)\r\n\r\n  In his _Religious System of China_, II., Dr. J. J. M. de Groot\r\n  devotes a whole chapter (ix. 721 _seqq._), _Concerning the\r\n  Sacrifice of Human Beings at Burials, and Usages connected\r\n  therewith_. The oldest case on record in China dates as far back as\r\n  B.C. 677, when sixty-six men were killed after the ruler Wu of the\r\n  state of Ts’in died.\r\n\r\n  The Official Annals of the Tartar Dynasty of Liao, quoted by\r\n  Professor J. J. M. de Groot (_Religious System of China_, vol.\r\n  ii. 698), state that “in the tenth year of the T’ung hwo period\r\n  (A.D. 692) the killing of horses for funeral and burial rites was\r\n  interdicted, as also the putting into the tombs of coats of mail,\r\n  helmets, and articles and trinkets of gold and silver.” Professor\r\n  de Groot writes (_l.c._ 709): “But, just as the placing of victuals\r\n  in the graves was at an early date changed into sacrifices of\r\n  food outside the graves, so burying horses with the dead was also\r\n  modified under the Han Dynasty into presenting them to the dead\r\n  without interring them, and valueless counterfeits were on such\r\n  occasions substituted for the real animals.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n                CONCERNING THE CUSTOMS OF THE TARTARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have begun to speak of the Tartars, I have plenty to tell\r\nyou on that subject. The Tartar custom is to spend the winter in warm\r\nplains, where they find good pasture for their cattle, whilst in summer\r\nthey betake themselves to a cool climate among the mountains and\r\nvalleys, where water is to be found as well as woods and pastures.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are circular, and are made of wands covered with felts.{1}\r\nThese are carried along with them whithersoever they go; for the wands\r\nare so strongly bound together, and likewise so well combined, that\r\nthe frame can be made very light. Whenever they erect these huts the\r\ndoor is always to the south. They also have waggons covered with black\r\nfelt so efficaciously that no rain can get in. These are drawn by oxen\r\nand camels, and the women and children travel in them.{2} The women\r\ndo the buying and selling, and whatever is necessary to provide for\r\nthe husband and household; for the men all lead the life of gentlemen,\r\ntroubling themselves about nothing but hunting and hawking, and looking\r\nafter their goshawks and falcons, unless it be the practice of warlike\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nThey live on the milk and meat which their herds supply, and on the\r\nproduce of the chase; and they eat all kinds of flesh, including that\r\nof horses and dogs, and Pharaoh’s rats, of which last there are great\r\nnumbers in burrows on those plains.{3} Their drink is mare’s milk.\r\n\r\nThey are very careful not to meddle with each other’s wives, and will\r\nnot do so on any account, holding that to be an evil and abominable\r\nthing. The women too are very good and loyal to their husbands, and\r\nnotable housewives withal.{4} [Ten or twenty of them will dwell\r\ntogether in charming peace and unity, nor shall you ever hear an ill\r\nword among them.]\r\n\r\nThe marriage customs of Tartars are as follows. Any man may take a\r\nhundred wives an he so please, and if he be able to keep them. But the\r\nfirst wife is ever held most in honour, and as the most legitimate [and\r\nthe same applies to the sons whom she may bear]. The husband gives a\r\nmarriage payment to his wife’s mother, and the wife brings nothing to\r\nher husband. They have more children than other people, because they\r\nhave so many wives. They may marry their cousins, and if a father dies,\r\nhis son may take any of the wives, his own mother always excepted; that\r\nis to say the eldest son may do this, but no other. A man may also take\r\nthe wife of his own brother after the latter’s death. Their weddings\r\nare celebrated with great ado.{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The word here in the G. T. is “_fennes_,” which seems\r\n  usually to mean _ropes_, and in fact Pauthier’s text reads: “_Il\r\n  ont mesons de verges et les cueuvrent de cordes_.” Ramusio’s text\r\n  has _feltroni_, and both Müller and the Latin of the S. G. have\r\n  _filtro_. This is certainly the right reading. But whether _fennes_\r\n  was ever used as a form of _feltres_ (as _pennes_ means _peltry_)\r\n  I cannot discover. Perhaps some words have dropped out. A good\r\n  description of a Kirghiz hut (35 feet in diameter), and exactly\r\n  corresponding to Polo’s account, will be found in _Atkinson’s\r\n  Siberia_, and another in _Vámbéry’s Travels_. How comfortable\r\n  and civilised the aspect of such a hut may be, can be seen also\r\n  in Burnes’s account of a Turkoman dwelling of this kind. This\r\n  description of hut or tent is common to nearly all the nomade\r\n  tribes of Central Asia. The trellis-work forming the skeleton of\r\n  the tent-walls is (at least among the Turkomans) loosely pivoted,\r\n  so as to draw out and compress like “lazy-tongs.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Dressing up a tent.]\r\n\r\n  Rubruquis, Pallas, Timkowski, and others, notice the custom of\r\n  turning the door to the south; the reason is obvious. (_Atkinson_,\r\n  285; _Vámb._ 316; _Burnes_, III. 51; _Conolly_, I. 96) But\r\n  throughout the Altai, Mr. Ney Elias informs me, K’alkas, Kirghiz,\r\n  and Kalmaks all pitch their tents facing _east_. The prevailing\r\n  winter wind is there _westerly_.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 56, note) says that he has often\r\n  seen Mongol tents facing east and south-east. He adds: “It is\r\n  interesting to find it noted in the _Chou Shu_ (Bk. 50, 3) that the\r\n  Khan of the Turks, who lived always on the Tu-kin mountains, had\r\n  his tent invariably facing south, so as to show reverence to the\r\n  sun’s rising place.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Æschylus already knows the\r\n\r\n                   “wandering Scyths who dwell\r\n      In latticed huts high-poised on easy wheels.”\r\n                                           (_Prom. Vinct._ 709–710.)\r\n\r\n  And long before him Hesiod says Phineus was carried by the Harpies—\r\n\r\n      “To the Land of the Milk-fed nations, whose houses are waggons.”\r\n                                               (_Strabo_, vii. 3–9.)\r\n\r\n  Ibn Batuta describes the Tartar waggon in which he travelled to\r\n  Sarai as mounted on four great wheels, and drawn by two or more\r\n  horses:—\r\n\r\n  “On the waggon is put a sort of pavilion of wands laced together\r\n  with narrow thongs. It is very light, and is covered with felt or\r\n  cloth, and has latticed windows, so that the person inside can look\r\n  out without being seen. He can change his position at pleasure,\r\n  sleeping or eating, reading or writing, during the journey.” These\r\n  waggons were sometimes of enormous size. Rubruquis declares that\r\n  he measured between the wheel-tracks of one and found the interval\r\n  to be 20 feet. The axle was like a ship’s mast, and twenty-two\r\n  oxen were yoked to the waggon, eleven abreast. (See opposite cut.)\r\n  He describes the huts as not usually taken to pieces, but carried\r\n  all standing. The waggon just mentioned carried a hut of 30 feet\r\n  diameter, for it projected beyond the wheels at least 5 feet on\r\n  either side. In fact, Carpini says explicitly, “Some of the huts\r\n  are speedily taken to pieces and put up again; such are packed\r\n  on the beasts. Others cannot be taken to pieces, but are carried\r\n  bodily on the waggons. To carry the smaller tents on a waggon one\r\n  ox may serve; for the larger ones three oxen or four, or even more,\r\n  according to the size.” The carts that were used to transport the\r\n  Tartar valuables were covered with felt soaked in tallow or ewe’s\r\n  milk, to make them waterproof. The tilts of these were rectangular,\r\n  in the form of a large trunk. The carts used in Kashgar, as\r\n  described by Mr. Shaw, seem to resemble these latter. (_I. B._ II.\r\n  381–382; _Rub._ 221; _Carp._ 6, 16.)\r\n\r\n  The words of Herodotus, speaking generally of the Scyths, apply\r\n  perfectly to the Mongol hordes under Chinghiz: “Having neither\r\n  cities nor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wherever\r\n  they go; accustomed, moreover, one and all, to shoot from\r\n  horseback; and living not by husbandry but on their cattle, their\r\n  waggons the only houses that they possess, how can they fail of\r\n  being unconquerable?” (Bk. IV. ch. 46, p. 41, _Rawlins._) Scythian\r\n  prisoners in their waggons are represented on the Column of\r\n  Theodosius at Constantinople; but it is difficult to believe that\r\n  these waggons, at least as figured in Banduri, have any really\r\n  Scythian character.\r\n\r\n  It is a curious fact that the practice of carrying these _yurts_\r\n  or felt tents upon waggons appears to be entirely obsolete in\r\n  Mongolia. Mr. Ney Elias writes: “I frequently showed your picture\r\n  [that opposite] to Mongols, Chinese, and Russian border-traders,\r\n  but none had ever seen anything of the kind. The only cart I have\r\n  ever seen used by Mongols is a little low, light, roughly-made\r\n  bullock-dray, _certainly_ of Chinese importation.” The old system\r\n  would, however, appear to have been kept up to our own times by\r\n  the Nogai Tartars, near the Sea of Azof. (See note from Heber, in\r\n  _Clark’s Travels_, 8vo ed. I. 440, and Dr. Clark’s vignette at p.\r\n  394 in the same volume.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: J. Cooper Sc\r\n\r\n    Mediæval Tartar Huts and Waggons.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—_Pharaoh’s Rat_ was properly the Gerboa of Arabia and\r\n  North Africa, which the Arabs also regard as a dainty. There\r\n  is a kindred animal in Siberia, called _Alactaga_, and a kind of\r\n  Kangaroo-rat (probably the same) is mentioned as very abundant\r\n  on the Mongolian Steppe. There is also the _Zieselmaus_ of\r\n  Pallas, a Dormouse, I believe, which he says the Kalmaks, even of\r\n  distinction, count a delicacy, especially cooked in sour milk.\r\n  “They eat not only the flesh of all their different kinds of\r\n  cattle, including horses and camels, but also that of many wild\r\n  animals which other nations eschew, _e.g._ marmots and _zieselmice_,\r\n  beavers, badgers, otters, and lynxes, leaving none untouched except\r\n  the dog and weasel kind, and also (unless _very_ hard pressed) the\r\n  flesh of the fox and the wolf.” (_Pallas, Samml._ I. 128; also\r\n  _Rubr._ 229–230.)\r\n\r\n  [“In the Mongol biography of Chinghiz Khan (Mongol text of the\r\n  _Yuan ch’ao pi shi_), mention is made of two kinds of animals\r\n  (mice) used for food; the tarbagat (_Aritomys Bobac_) and\r\n  _kuchugur_.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 14.) Regarding the marmots\r\n  called _Sogur_ by Rubruquis, Mr. Rockhill writes (p. 69): “Probably\r\n  the _Mus citillus_, the _Suslik_ of the Russians.... M. Grenard\r\n  tells me that _Soghur_, more usually written _sour_ in Turki, is\r\n  the ordinary name of the marmot.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—“Their wives are chaste; nor does one ever hear any talk\r\n  of their immodesty,” says Carpini;—no Boccaccian and Chaucerian\r\n  stories.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—“The Mongols are not prohibited from having a plurality of\r\n  wives; the first manages the domestic concerns, and is the most\r\n  respected.” (_Timk._ II. 310.) Naturally Polygamy is not so general\r\n  among the Mongols as when Asia lay at their feet. The Buraets, who\r\n  seem to retain the old Mongol customs in great completeness, are\r\n  polygamists, and have as many wives as they choose. Polygamy is\r\n  also very prevalent among the Yakuts, whose lineage seems to be\r\n  Eastern Turk. (_Ritter_, III. 125; _Erman_, II. 346.)\r\n\r\n  Of the custom that entitled the son on succeeding to take such\r\n  as he pleased of his deceased father’s wives, we have had some\r\n  illustration (see _Prologue_, ch. xvii. note 2), and many\r\n  instances will be found in Hammer’s or other Mongol Histories.\r\n  The same custom seems to be ascribed by Herodotus to the Scyths\r\n  (IV. 78). A number of citations regarding the practice are given\r\n  by Quatremère. (_Q. R._ p. 92.) A modern Mongol writer in the\r\n  _Mélanges Asiatiques_ of the Petersburg Academy, states that the\r\n  custom of taking a deceased brother’s wives is now obsolete, but\r\n  that a proverb preserves its memory (II. 656). It is the custom of\r\n  some Mahomedan nations, notably of the Afghans, and is one of those\r\n  points that have been cited as a supposed proof of their Hebrew\r\n  lineage.\r\n\r\n  “The Kalin is a present which the Bridegroom or his parents make\r\n  to the parents of the Bride. All the Pagan nations of Siberia have\r\n  this custom; they differ only in what constitutes the present,\r\n  whether money or cattle.” (_Gmelin_, I. 29; see also _Erman_, II.\r\n  348.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n                  CONCERNING THE GOD OF THE TARTARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the fashion of their religion. [They say there is a Most High\r\nGod of Heaven, whom they worship daily with thurible and incense, but\r\nthey pray to Him only for health of mind and body. But] they have\r\n[also] a certain [other] god of theirs called NATIGAY, and they say he\r\nis the god of the Earth, who watches over their children, cattle, and\r\ncrops. They show him great worship and honour, and every man hath a\r\nfigure of him in his house, made of felt and cloth; and they also make\r\nin the same manner images of his wife and children. The wife they put\r\non the left hand, and the children in front. And when they eat, they\r\ntake the fat of the meat and grease the god’s mouth withal, as well as\r\nthe mouths of his wife and children. Then they take of the broth and\r\nsprinkle it before the door of the house; and that done, they deem that\r\ntheir god and his family have had their share of the dinner.{1}\r\n\r\nTheir drink is mare’s milk, prepared in such a way that you would\r\ntake it for white wine; and a right good drink it is, called by them\r\n_Kemiz_.{2}\r\n\r\nThe clothes of the wealthy Tartars are for the most part of gold and\r\nsilk stuffs, lined with costly furs, such as sable and ermine, vair and\r\nfox-skin, in the richest fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—There is no reference here to Buddhism, which was then of\r\n  recent introduction among the Mongols; indeed, at the end of the\r\n  chapter, Polo speaks of their new adoption of the Chinese idolatry,\r\n  _i.e._ Buddhism. We may add here that the Buddhism of the Mongols\r\n  decayed and became practically extinct after their expulsion from\r\n  China (1368–1369). The old Shamanism then apparently revived; nor\r\n  was it till 1577 that the great reconversion of Mongolia to Lamaism\r\n  began. This reconversion is the most prominent event in the Mongol\r\n  history of Sanang Setzen, whose great-grandfather Khutuktai Setzen,\r\n  Prince of the Ordos, was a chief agent in the movement.\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Good Spirit appears to have been called by the Mongols\r\n  _Tengri_ (Heaven), and _Khormuzda_, and is identified by Schmidt\r\n  with the Persian Hormuzd. In Buddhist times he became identified\r\n  with Indra.\r\n\r\n  Plano Carpini’s account of this matter is very like Marco’s: “They\r\n  believe in one God, the Maker of all things, visible and invisible,\r\n  and the Distributor of good and evil in this world; but they\r\n  worship Him not with prayers or praises or any kind of service.\r\n  Natheless, they have certain idols of felt, imitating the human\r\n  face, and having underneath the face something resembling teats;\r\n  these they place on either side of the door. These they believe to\r\n  be the guardians of the flocks, from whom they have the boons of\r\n  milk and increase. Others they fabricate of bits of silk, and these\r\n  are highly honoured; ... and whenever they begin to eat or drink,\r\n  they first offer these idols a portion of their food or drink.”\r\n\r\n  The account agrees generally with what we are told of the original\r\n  Shamanism of the Tunguses, which recognizes a Supreme Power over\r\n  all, and a small number of potent spirits called _Ongot_. These\r\n  spirits among the Buraets are called, according to one author,\r\n  _Nougait_ or _Nogat_, and according to Erman _Ongotui_. In some\r\n  form of this same word, _Nogait_, _Ongot_, _Onggod_, _Ongotui_,\r\n  we are, I imagine, to trace the _Natigay_ of Polo. The modern\r\n  representative of this Shamanist _Lar_ is still found among\r\n  the Buraets, and is thus described by Pallas under the name of\r\n  _Immegiljin_: “He is honoured as the tutelary god of the sheep and\r\n  other cattle. Properly, the divinity consists of _two_ figures,\r\n  hanging side by side, one of whom represents the god’s wife. These\r\n  two figures are merely a pair of lanky flat bolsters with the upper\r\n  part shaped into a round disk, and the body hung with a long woolly\r\n  fleece; eyes, nose, breasts, and navel, being indicated by leather\r\n  knobs stitched on. The male figure commonly has at his girdle\r\n  the foot-rope with which horses at pasture are fettered, whilst\r\n  the female, which is sometimes accompanied by smaller figures\r\n  representing her children, has all sorts of little nicknacks and\r\n  sewing implements.” Galsang Czomboyef, a recent Russo-Mongol writer\r\n  already quoted, says also: “Among the Buryats, in the middle of\r\n  the hut and place of honour, is the _Dsaiagaçhi_ or ‘Chief Creator\r\n  of Fortune.’ At the door is the _Emelgelji_, the Tutelary of the\r\n  Herds and Young Cattle, made of sheepskins. Outside the hut is the\r\n  _Chandaghatu_, a name implying that the idol was formed of a white\r\n  hare-skin, the Tutelary of the Chase and perhaps of War. All these\r\n  have been expelled by Buddhism except Dsaiagachi, who is called\r\n  _Tengri_, and introduced among the Buddhist divinities.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Tartar Idols and Kumis Churn.]\r\n\r\n  [Dorji Banzaroff, in his dissertation _On the Black Religion_,\r\n  _i.e._ Shamanism, 1846, “is disposed to see in Natigay of M. Polo,\r\n  the Ytoga of other travellers, _i.e._ the Mongol _Etugen_—‘earth,’\r\n  as the object of veneration of the Mongol Shamans. They look upon\r\n  it as a divinity, for its power as _Delegei in echen_, _i.e._ ‘the\r\n  Lord of Earth,’ and on account of its productiveness, _Altan\r\n  delegei_, _i.e._ ‘Golden Earth.’” Palladius (_l.c._ pp. 14–16) adds\r\n  one new variant to what the learned Colonel Yule has collected and\r\n  set forth with such precision, on the Shaman household gods. “The\r\n  Dahurs and Barhus have in their dwellings, according to the number\r\n  of the male members of the family, puppets made of straw, on which\r\n  eyes, eyebrows, and mouth are drawn; these puppets are dressed up\r\n  to the waist. When some one of the family dies, his puppet is taken\r\n  out of the house, and a new puppet is made for every newly-born\r\n  member of the family. On New Year’s Day offerings are made to the\r\n  puppets, and care is taken not to disturb them (by moving them,\r\n  etc.), in order to avoid bringing sickness upon the family.” (_He\r\n  lung kiang wai ki_.)\r\n\r\n  (Cf. _Rubruck_, 58–59, and Mr. Rockhill’s note, 59–60.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—KIMIZ or KUMIZ, the habitual drink of the Mongols, as it\r\n  still is of most of the nomads of Asia. It is thus made. Fresh\r\n  mare’s milk is put in a well-seasoned bottle-necked vessel of\r\n  horse-skin; a little _kurút_ (see note 5, ch. liv.) or some sour\r\n  cow’s milk is added; and when acetous fermentation is commencing\r\n  it is violently churned with a peculiar staff which constantly\r\n  stands in the vessel. This interrupts fermentation and introduces a\r\n  quantity of air into the liquid. It is customary for visitors who\r\n  may drop in to give a turn or two at the churn-stick. After three\r\n  or four days the drink is ready.\r\n\r\n  Kumiz keeps long; it is wonderfully tonic and nutritious, and it is\r\n  said that it has cured many persons threatened with consumption.\r\n  The tribes using it are said to be remarkably free from pulmonary\r\n  disease; and indeed I understand there is a regular _Galactopathic_\r\n  establishment somewhere in the province of Orenburg for treating\r\n  pulmonary patients with Kumiz diet.\r\n\r\n  It has a peculiar fore- and after-taste which, it is said,\r\n  everybody does not like. Yet I have found no confession of a\r\n  dislike to Kumiz. Rubruquis tells us it is pungent on the tongue,\r\n  like _vinum raspei_ (_vin rapé_ of the French), whilst you are\r\n  drinking it, but leaves behind a pleasant flavour like milk of\r\n  almonds. It makes a man’s inside feel very cosy, he adds, even\r\n  turning a weak head, and is strongly diuretic. To this last\r\n  statement, however, modern report is in direct contradiction. The\r\n  Greeks and other Oriental Christians considered it a sort of denial\r\n  of the faith to drink Kumiz. On the other hand, the Mahomedan\r\n  converts from the nomad tribes seem to have adhered to the use of\r\n  Kumiz even when strict in abstinence from wine; and it was indulged\r\n  in by the early Mamelukes as a public solemnity. Excess on such an\r\n  occasion killed Bibars Bundukdari, who was passionately fond of\r\n  this liquor.\r\n\r\n  The intoxicating power of Kumiz varies according to the _brew_.\r\n  The more advanced is the vinous fermentation the less acid is the\r\n  taste and the more it sparkles. The effect, however, is always\r\n  slight and transitory, and leaves no unpleasant sensation, whilst\r\n  it produces a strong tendency to refreshing sleep. If its good\r\n  qualities amount to half what are ascribed to it by Dr. W. F. Dahl,\r\n  from whom we derive some of these particulars, it must be the pearl\r\n  of all beverages. “With the nomads it is the drink of all from the\r\n  suckling upwards, it is the solace of age and illness, and the\r\n  greatest of treats to all!”\r\n\r\n  There was a special kind called _Ḳará Ḳumiz_, which is mentioned\r\n  both by Rubruquis and in the history of Wassáf. It seems to have\r\n  been strained and clarified. The modern Tartars distil a spirit\r\n  from Kumiz of which Pallas gives a detailed account. (_Dahl, Ueber\r\n  den Kumyss_ in _Baer’s Beiträge_, VII.; _Lettres sur le Caucase et\r\n  la Crimée_, Paris, 1859, p. 81; _Makrizi_, II. 147; _J. As._ XI.\r\n  160; _Levchine_, 322–323; _Rubr._ 227–228, 335; _Gold. Horde_, p.\r\n  46; _Erman_, I. 296; _Pallas, Samml._ I. 132 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  [In the _Si yu ki_, Travels to the West of Ch’ang ch’un, we find\r\n  a drink called _tung lo_. “The Chinese characters, _tung lo_,”\r\n  says Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ I. 94), “denote according to the\r\n  dictionaries preparations from mare’s or cow’s milk, as Kumis,\r\n  sour milk, etc. In the _Yüan shi_ (ch. cxxviii.) biography of the\r\n  Kipchak prince _Tú-tú-ha_, it is stated that ‘black mare’s milk’\r\n  (evidently the cara cosmos of Rubruck), very pleasant to the taste,\r\n  used to be sent from Kipchak to the Mongol court in China.” (On\r\n  the drinks of the Mongols, see Mr. Rockhill’s note, _Rubruck_,\r\n  p. 62.)—The Mongols indulge in sour milk (_tarak_) and distilled\r\n  mare’s milk (_arreki_), but Mr. Rockhill (_Land of the Lamas_,\r\n  130) says he never saw them drink _kumiz_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The mare’s-milk drink of Scythian nomads is alluded to by many\r\n  ancient authors. But the manufacture of Kumiz is particularly\r\n  spoken of by Herodotus. “The (mare’s) milk is poured into deep\r\n  wooden casks, about which the blind slaves are placed, and then\r\n  the milk is stirred round. That which rises to the top is drawn\r\n  off, and considered the best part; the under portion is of less\r\n  account.” Strabo also speaks of the nomads beyond the Cimmerian\r\n  Chersonesus, who feed on horse-flesh and other flesh, mare’s-milk\r\n  cheese, mare’s milk, and sour milk (ὀξυγάλακτα) “_which they have a\r\n  particular way of preparing_.” Perhaps Herodotus was mistaken about\r\n  the wooden tubs. At least all modern attempts to use anything but\r\n  the orthodox skins have failed. Priscus, in his narrative of the\r\n  mission of himself and Maximin to Attila, says the Huns brought\r\n  them a drink made from _barley_ which they called Κάμος. The barley\r\n  was, no doubt, a misapprehension of his. (_Herod._ Bk. iv. p. 2, in\r\n  _Rawl._; _Strabo_, VII. 4, 6; _Excerpta de Legationibus_, in _Corp.\r\n  Hist. Byzant._ I. 55.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n                 CONCERNING THE TARTAR CUSTOMS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll their harness of war is excellent and costly. Their arms are bows\r\nand arrows, sword and mace; but above all the bow, for they are capital\r\narchers, indeed the best that are known. On their backs they wear\r\narmour of cuirbouly, prepared from buffalo and other hides, which is\r\nvery strong.{1} They are excellent soldiers, and passing valiant in\r\nbattle. They are also more capable of hardships than other nations; for\r\nmany a time, if need be, they will go for a month without any supply\r\nof food, living only on the milk of their mares and on such game as\r\ntheir bows may win them. Their horses also will subsist entirely on the\r\ngrass of the plains, so that there is no need to carry store of barley\r\nor straw or oats; and they are very docile to their riders. These, in\r\ncase of need, will abide on horseback the livelong night, armed at all\r\npoints, while the horse will be continually grazing.\r\n\r\nOf all troops in the world these are they which endure the greatest\r\nhardship and fatigue, and which cost the least; and they are the best\r\nof all for making wide conquests of country. And this you will perceive\r\nfrom what you have heard and shall hear in this book; and (as a fact)\r\nthere can be no manner of doubt that now they are the masters of the\r\nbiggest half of the world. Their troops are admirably ordered in the\r\nmanner that I shall now relate.\r\n\r\nYou see, when a Tartar prince goes forth to war, he takes with him,\r\nsay, 100,000 horse. Well, he appoints an officer to every ten men, one\r\nto every hundred, one to every thousand, and one to every ten thousand,\r\nso that his own orders have to be given to ten persons only, and each\r\nof these ten persons has to pass the orders only to other ten, and so\r\non; no one having to give orders to more than ten. And every one in\r\nturn is responsible only to the officer immediately over him; and the\r\ndiscipline and order that comes of this method is marvellous, for they\r\nare a people very obedient to their chiefs. Further, they call the\r\ncorps of 100,000 men a _Tuc_; that of 10,000 they call a _Toman_; the\r\nthousand they call ...; the hundred _Guz_; the ten ....{2} And when the\r\narmy is on the march they have always 200 horsemen, very well mounted,\r\nwho are sent a distance of two marches in advance to reconnoitre, and\r\nthese always keep ahead. They have a similar party detached in the\r\nrear, and on either flank, so that there is a good look-out kept on all\r\nsides against a surprise. When they are going on a distant expedition\r\nthey take no gear with them except two leather bottles for milk; a\r\nlittle earthenware pot to cook their meat in, and a little tent to\r\nshelter them from rain.{3} And in case of great urgency they will ride\r\nten days on end without lighting a fire or taking a meal. On such an\r\noccasion they will sustain themselves on the blood of their horses,\r\nopening a vein and letting the blood jet into their mouths, drinking\r\ntill they have had enough, and then staunching it.{4}\r\n\r\nThey also have milk dried into a kind of paste to carry with them; and\r\nwhen they need food they put this in water, and beat it up till it\r\ndissolves, and then drink it. [It is prepared in this way; they boil\r\nthe milk, and when the rich part floats on the top they skim it into\r\nanother vessel, and of that they make butter; for the milk will not\r\nbecome solid till this is removed. Then they put the milk in the sun\r\nto dry. And when they go on an expedition, every man takes some ten\r\npounds of this dried milk with him. And of a morning he will take a\r\nhalf pound of it and put it in his leather bottle, with as much water\r\nas he pleases. So, as he rides along, the milk-paste and the water in\r\nthe bottle get well churned together into a kind of pap, and that makes\r\nhis dinner.{5}]\r\n\r\nWhen they come to an engagement with the enemy, they will gain the\r\nvictory in this fashion. [They never let themselves get into a regular\r\nmedley, but keep perpetually riding round and shooting into the enemy.\r\nAnd] as they do not count it any shame to run away in battle, they\r\nwill [sometimes pretend to] do so, and in running away they turn in\r\nthe saddle and shoot hard and strong at the foe, and in this way make\r\ngreat havoc. Their horses are trained so perfectly that they will\r\ndouble hither and thither, just like a dog, in a way that is quite\r\nastonishing. Thus they fight to as good purpose in running away as if\r\nthey stood and faced the enemy, because of the vast volleys of arrows\r\nthat they shoot in this way, turning round upon their pursuers, who are\r\nfancying that they have won the battle. But when the Tartars see that\r\nthey have killed and wounded a good many horses and men, they wheel\r\nround bodily, and return to the charge in perfect order and with loud\r\ncries; and in a very short time the enemy are routed. In truth they\r\nare stout and valiant soldiers, and inured to war. And you perceive\r\nthat it is just when the enemy sees them run, and imagines that he has\r\ngained the battle, that he has in reality lost it; for the Tartars\r\nwheel round in a moment when they judge the right time has come. And\r\nafter this fashion they have won many a fight.{6}\r\n\r\nAll this that I have been telling you is true of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the genuine Tartars. But I must add also that in these days\r\nthey are greatly degenerated; for those who are settled in Cathay\r\nhave taken up the practices of the Idolaters of the country, and have\r\nabandoned their own institutions; whilst those who have settled in the\r\nLevant have adopted the customs of the Saracens.{7}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The bow was the characteristic weapon of the Tartars,\r\n  insomuch that the Armenian historians often call them “The\r\n  Archers.” (_St. Martin_, II. 133.) “CUIRBOULY, leather softened\r\n  by boiling, in which it took any form or impression required, and\r\n  then hardened.” (_Wright’s Dict._) The English adventurer among\r\n  the Tartars, whose account of them is given by Archbishop Ivo of\r\n  Narbonne, in Matthew Paris (_sub._ 1243), says: “De coriis bullitis\r\n  sibi arma levia quidem, sed tamen impenetrabilia coaptarunt.” This\r\n  armour is particularly described by Plano Carpini (p. 685). See the\r\n  tail-piece to Book IV.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. E. H. Parker (_China Review_, XXIV. iv. p. 205) remarks that\r\n  “the first coats of mail were made in China in 1288: perhaps the\r\n  idea was obtained from the Malays or Arabs.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—M. Pauthier has judiciously pointed out the omissions that\r\n  have occurred here, perhaps owing to Rusticiano’s not properly\r\n  catching the foreign terms applied to the various grades. In the G.\r\n  Text the passage runs: “_Et sachiés que les cent mille est apellé\r\n  un_ Tut (read _tuc_) _et les dix mille un_ Toman, _et les por\r\n  milier et por centenier et por desme_.” In Pauthier’s (uncorrected)\r\n  text one of the missing words is supplied: “_Et appellent les\r\n  C.M. un_ Tuc; _et les X.M. un_ Toman; _et un millier_ Guz _por\r\n  centenier et por disenier_.” The blanks he supplies thus from\r\n  Abulghazi: “_Et un millier_: [un Miny]; _Guz, por centenier et_\r\n  [Un] _por disenier_.” The words supplied are Turki, but so is the\r\n  _Guz_, which appears already in Pauthier’s text, whilst _Toman_\r\n  and _Tuc_ are common to Turki and Mongol. The latter word, _Túk_\r\n  or _Túgh_, is the horse-tail or yak-tail standard which among so\r\n  many Asiatic nations has marked the supreme military command. It\r\n  occurs as _Taka_ in ancient Persian, and Cosmas Indicopleustes\r\n  speaks of it as _Tupha_. The Nine Orloks or Marshals under Chinghiz\r\n  were entitled to the _Tuk_, and theirs is probably the class of\r\n  command here indicated as of 100,000, though the figure must not be\r\n  strictly taken. Timur ordains that every Amir who should conquer a\r\n  kingdom or command in a victory should receive a title of honour,\r\n  the _Tugh_ and the _Naḳḳárá_. (_Infra_, Bk. II. ch. iv. note 3.)\r\n  Baber on several occasions speaks of conferring the _Tugh_ upon his\r\n  generals for distinguished service. One of the military titles\r\n  at Bokhara is still _Tokhsabai_, a corruption of _Túgh-Sáhibi_\r\n  (Master of the Tugh).\r\n\r\n  We find the whole gradation except the _Tuc_ in a rescript of\r\n  Janibeg, Khan of Sarai, in favour of Venetian merchants dated\r\n  February 1347. It begins in the Venetian version: “_La parola\r\n  de Zanibeck allo puovolo di Mogoli, alli_ Baroni di Thomeni,[1]\r\n  delli miera, delli centenera, delle dexiene.” (_Erdmann_, 576;\r\n  _D’Avezac_, 577–578; _Rémusat, Langues Tartares_, 303; _Pallas,\r\n  Samml._ I. 283; _Schmidt_, 379, 381; _Baber_, 260, etc.; _Vámbéry_,\r\n  374; _Timour Inst._ pp. 283 and 292–293; _Bibl. de l’Ec. des\r\n  Chartes_, tom. lv. p. 585.)\r\n\r\n  The decimal division of the army was already made by Chinghiz at an\r\n  early period of his career, and was probably much older than his\r\n  time. In fact we find the Myriarch and Chiliarch already in the\r\n  Persian armies of Darius Hystaspes. From the Tartars the system\r\n  passed into nearly all the Musulman States of Asia, and the titles\r\n  _Min-bashi_ or _Bimbashi_, _Yuzbashi_, _Onbashi_, still subsist not\r\n  only in Turkestan, but also in Turkey and Persia. The term _Tman_\r\n  or _Tma_ was, according to Herberstein, still used in Russia in his\r\n  day for 10,000. (_Ramus._ II. 159.)\r\n\r\n  [The King of An-nam, Dinh Tiên-hòang (A.D. 968) had an army of\r\n  1,000,000 men forming 10 corps of 10 legions; each legion forming\r\n  10 cohorts of 10 centuries; each century forming 10 squads of 10\r\n  men.—H.

IV. ch.\r\n  64, p. 54.)—H. C.] “When in lack of food, they bleed a horse\r\n  and suck the vein. If they need something more solid, they put\r\n  a sheep’s pudding full of blood under the saddle; this in time\r\n  gets coagulated and cooked by the heat, and then they devour it.”\r\n  (_Georg. Pachymeres_, V. 4.) The last is a well-known story, but\r\n  is strenuously denied and ridiculed by Bergmann. (_Streifereien,\r\n  etc._ I. 15.) Joinville tells the same story. Hans Schiltberger\r\n  asserts it very distinctly: “Ich hon och gesehen wann sie in reiss\r\n  ylten, das sie ein fleisch nemen, und es dunn schinden und legents\r\n  unter den sattel, und riten doruff; und essents wann sie hungert”\r\n  (ch. 35). Botero had “heard from a trustworthy source that a Tartar\r\n  of Perekop, travelling on the steppes, lived for some days on the\r\n  blood of his horse, and then, not daring to bleed it more, cut off\r\n  and ate its _ears_!” (_Relazione Univers._ p. 93.) The Turkmans\r\n  speak of such practices, but Conolly says he came to regard them as\r\n  hyperbolical talk (I. 45).\r\n\r\n  [Abul-Ghazi Khan, in his History of Mongols, describing a raid of\r\n  Russian (_Ourous_) Cossacks, who were hemmed in by the Uzbeks,\r\n  says: “The Russians had in continued fighting exhausted all their\r\n  water. They began to drink blood; the fifth day they had not even\r\n  blood remaining to drink.” (_Transl. by Baron Des Maisons_, St.\r\n  Petersburg, II. 295.)]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Rubruquis thus describes this preparation, which is called\r\n  _Kurút_: “The milk that remains after the butter has been made,\r\n  they allow to get as sour as sour can be, and then boil it. In\r\n  boiling, it curdles, and that curd they dry in the sun; and in this\r\n  way it becomes as hard as iron-slag. And so it is stored in bags\r\n  against the winter. In the winter time, when they have no milk,\r\n  they put that sour curd, which they call _Griut_, into a skin,\r\n  and pour warm water on it, and they shake it violently till the\r\n  curd dissolves in the water, to which it gives an acid flavour;\r\n  that water they drink in place of milk. But above all things they\r\n  eschew drinking plain water.” From Pallas’s account of the modern\r\n  practice, which is substantially the same, these cakes are also\r\n  made from the leavings of distillation in making milk-arrack. The\r\n  Kurút is frequently made of ewe-milk. Wood speaks of it as an\r\n  indispensable article in the food of the people of Badakhshan, and\r\n  under the same name it is a staple food of the Afghans. (_Rubr._\r\n  229; _Samml._ I. 136; _Dahl_, u.s.; _Wood_, 311.)\r\n\r\n  [It is the _ch’ura_ of the Tibetans. “In the Kokonor country and\r\n  Tibet, this _krut_ or _chura_ is put in tea to soften, and then\r\n  eaten either alone or mixed with parched barley meal (_tsamba_).”\r\n  (_Rockhill, Rubruck_, p. 68, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—Compare with Marco’s account the report of the Mongols,\r\n  which was brought by the spies of Mahomed, Sultan of Khwarizm,\r\n  when invasion was first menaced by Chinghiz: “The army of Chinghiz\r\n  is countless, as a swarm of ants or locusts. Their warriors are\r\n  matchless in lion-like valour, in obedience, and endurance.\r\n  They take no rest, and flight or retreat is unknown to them. On\r\n  their expeditions they are accompanied by oxen, sheep, camels,\r\n  and horses, and sweet or sour milk suffices them for food. Their\r\n  horses scratch the earth with their hoofs and feed on the roots\r\n  and grasses they dig up, so that they need neither straw nor oats.\r\n  They themselves reck nothing of the clean or the unclean in food,\r\n  and eat the flesh of all animals, even of dogs, swine, and bears.\r\n  They will open a horse’s vein, draw blood, and drink it.... In\r\n  victory they leave neither small nor great alive; they cut up women\r\n  great with child and cleave the fruit of the womb. If they come\r\n  to a great river, as they know nothing of boats, they sew skins\r\n  together, stitch up all their goods therein, tie the bundle to\r\n  their horses’ tails, mount with a hard grip of the mane, and so\r\n  swim over.” This passage is an absolute abridgment of many chapters\r\n  of Carpini. Still more terse was the sketch of Mongol proceedings\r\n  drawn by a fugitive from Bokhara after Chinghiz’s devastations\r\n  there. It was set forth in one unconscious hexameter:\r\n\r\n      “_Ámdand u khandand u sokhtand u kushtand u burdand u raftand!_”\r\n      “They came and they sapped, they fired and they slew, trussed up\r\n          their loot and were gone!”\r\n\r\n  Juwaini, the historian, after telling the story, adds: “The\r\n  cream and essence of whatever is written in this volume might be\r\n  represented in these few words.”\r\n\r\n  A Musulman author quoted by Hammer, Najmuddin of Rei, gives an\r\n  awful picture of the Tartar devastations, “Such as had never been\r\n  heard of, whether in the lands of unbelief or of Islam, and can\r\n  only be likened to those which the Prophet announced as signs of\r\n  the Last Day, when he said: ‘The Hour of Judgment shall not come\r\n  until ye shall have fought with the Turks, men small of eye and\r\n  ruddy of countenance, whose noses are flat, and their faces like\r\n  hide-covered shields. Those shall be Days of Horror!’ ‘And what\r\n  meanest thou by horror?’ said the Companions; and he replied,\r\n  ‘SLAUGHTER! SLAUGHTER!’ This beheld the Prophet in vision 600 years\r\n  ago. And could there well be worse slaughter than there was in Rei,\r\n  where I, wretch that I am, was born and bred, and where the whole\r\n  population of five hundred thousand souls was either butchered or\r\n  dragged into slavery?”\r\n\r\n  Marco habitually suppresses or ignores the frightful brutalities of\r\n  the Tartars, but these were somewhat less, no doubt, in Kúblái’s\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  The Hindustani poet Amir Khosru gives a picture of the Mongols more\r\n  forcible than elegant, which Elliot has translated (III. 528).\r\n\r\n  This is Hayton’s account of the Parthian tactics of the Tartars:\r\n  “They will run away, but always keeping their companies together;\r\n  and it is very dangerous to give them chase, for as they flee they\r\n  shoot back over their heads, and do great execution among their\r\n  pursuers. They keep very close rank, so that you would not guess\r\n  them for half their real strength.” Carpini speaks to the same\r\n  effect. Baber, himself of Mongol descent, but heartily hating his\r\n  kindred, gives this account of their military usage in his day:\r\n  “Such is the uniform practice of these wretches the Moghuls; if\r\n  they defeat the enemy they instantly seize the booty; if they are\r\n  defeated, they plunder and dismount their own allies, and, betide\r\n  what may, carry off the spoil.” (_Erdmann_, 364, 383, 620; _Gold.\r\n  Horde_, 77, 80; _Elliot_, II. 388; _Hayton_ in _Ram._ ch. xlviii.;\r\n  _Baber_, 93; _Carpini_, p. 694.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—“The Scythians” (_i.e._ in the absurd Byzantine pedantry,\r\n  _Tartars_), says Nicephorus Gregoras, “from converse with the\r\n  Assyrians, Persians, and Chaldæans, in time acquired their manners\r\n  and adopted their religion, casting off their ancestral atheism....\r\n  And to such a degree were they changed, that though in former days\r\n  they had been wont to cover the head with nothing better than a\r\n  loose felt cap, and for other clothing had thought themselves well\r\n  off with the skins of wild beasts or ill-dressed leather, and had\r\n  for weapons only clubs and slings, or spears, arrows, and bows\r\n  extemporised from the oaks and other trees of their mountains and\r\n  forests, now, forsooth, they will have no meaner clothing than\r\n  brocades of silk and gold! And their luxury and delicate living\r\n  came to such a pitch that they stood far as the poles asunder from\r\n  their original habits” (II. v. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] This is _Chomeni_ in the original, but I have ventured to correct\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n      CONCERNING THE ADMINISTERING OF JUSTICE AMONG THE TARTARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way they administer justice is this. When any one has committed\r\na petty theft, they give him, under the orders of authority, seven\r\nblows of a stick, or seventeen, or twenty-seven, or thirty-seven, or\r\nforty-seven, and so forth, always increasing by tens in proportion to\r\nthe injury done, and running up to one hundred and seven. Of these\r\nbeatings sometimes they die.{1} But if the offence be horse-stealing,\r\nor some other great matter, they cut the thief in two with a sword.\r\nHowbeit, if he be able to ransom himself by paying nine times the\r\nvalue of the thing stolen, he is let off. Every Lord or other person\r\nwho possesses beasts has them marked with his peculiar brand, be they\r\nhorses, mares, camels, oxen, cows, or other great cattle, and then they\r\nare sent abroad to graze over the plains without any keeper. They get\r\nall mixt together, but eventually every beast is recovered by means\r\nof its owner’s brand, which is known. For their sheep and goats they\r\nhave shepherds. All their cattle are remarkably fine, big, and in good\r\ncondition.{2}\r\n\r\nThey have another notable custom, which is this. If any man have a\r\ndaughter who dies before marriage, and another man have had a son also\r\ndie before marriage, the parents of the two arrange a grand wedding\r\nbetween the dead lad and lass. And marry them they do, making a regular\r\ncontract! And when the contract papers are made out they put them in\r\nthe fire, in order (as they will have it) that the parties in the other\r\nworld may know the fact, and so look on each other as man and wife.\r\nAnd the parents thenceforward consider themselves sib to each other,\r\njust as if their children had lived and married. Whatever may be agreed\r\non between the parties as dowry, those who have to pay it cause to be\r\npainted on pieces of paper and then put these in the fire, saying that\r\nin that way the dead person will get all the real articles in the other\r\nworld.{3}\r\n\r\nNow I have told you all about the manners and customs of the Tartars;\r\nbut you have heard nothing yet of the great state of the Grand Kaan,\r\nwho is the Lord of all the Tartars and of the Supreme Imperial Court.\r\nAll that I will tell you in this book in proper time and place, but\r\nmeanwhile I must return to my story which I left off in that great\r\nplain when we began to speak of the Tartars.{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The cudgel among the Mongols was not confined to thieves\r\n  and such like. It was the punishment also of military and state\r\n  offences, and even princes were liable to it without fatal\r\n  disgrace. “If they give any offence,” says Carpini, “or omit to\r\n  obey the slightest beck, the Tartars themselves are beaten like\r\n  donkeys.” The number of blows administered was, according to\r\n  Wassáf, always odd, 3, 5, and so forth, up to 77. (_Carp._ 712;\r\n  _Ilchan._ I. 37.)\r\n\r\n  [“They also punish with death grand larceny, but as for petty\r\n  thefts, such as that of a sheep, so long as one has not repeatedly\r\n  been taken in the act, they beat him cruelly, and if they\r\n  administer an hundred blows they must use an hundred sticks.”\r\n  (_Rockhill, Rubruck_, p. 80.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“They have no herdsmen or others to watch their cattle,\r\n  because the laws of the Turks (_i.e._ Tartars) against theft are so\r\n  severe.... A man in whose possession a stolen horse is found is\r\n  obliged to restore it to its owner, _and to give nine of the same\r\n  value_; if he cannot, his children are seized in compensation;\r\n  if he have no children, he is slaughtered like a mutton.” (_Ibn\r\n  Batuta_, II. 364.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This is a Chinese custom, though no doubt we may trust\r\n  Marco for its being a Tartar one also. “In the province of Shansi\r\n  they have a ridiculous custom, which is to marry dead folks to each\r\n  other. F. Michael Trigault, a Jesuit, who lived several years in\r\n  that province, told it us whilst we were in confinement. It falls\r\n  out that one man’s son and another man’s daughter die. Whilst the\r\n  coffins are in the house (and they used to keep them two or three\r\n  years, or longer) the parents agree to marry them; they send the\r\n  usual presents, as if the pair were alive, with much ceremony and\r\n  music. After this they put the two coffins together, hold the\r\n  wedding dinner in their presence, and, lastly, lay them together\r\n  in one tomb. The parents, from this time forth, are looked on not\r\n  merely as friends but as relatives—just as they would have been had\r\n  their children been married when in life.” (_Navarrete_, quoted\r\n  by _Marsden._) Kidd likewise, speaking of the Chinese custom of\r\n  worshipping at the tombs of progenitors, says: “So strongly does\r\n  veneration for this tribute after death prevail that parents,\r\n  in order to secure the memorial of the sepulchre for a daughter\r\n  who has died during her betrothal, give her in marriage after\r\n  her decease to her intended husband, who receives with nuptial\r\n  ceremonies at his own house a paper effigy made by her parents,\r\n  and after he has burnt it, erects a tablet to her memory—an honour\r\n  which usage forbids to be rendered to the memory of unmarried\r\n  persons. The law seeks without effect to abolish this absurd\r\n  custom.” (_China_, etc., pp. 179–180.)\r\n\r\n  [Professor J. J. M. de Groot (_Religious System of China_) gives\r\n  several instances of marriages after death; the following example\r\n  (II. 804–805) will illustrate the custom: “An interesting account\r\n  of the manner in which such _post-mortem_ marriages were concluded\r\n  at the period when the Sung Dynasty governed the Empire, is given\r\n  by a contemporary work in the following words: ‘In the northern\r\n  parts of the Realm it is customary, when an unmarried youth and\r\n  an unmarried girl breathe their last, that the two families each\r\n  charge a match-maker to demand the other party in marriage. Such\r\n  go-betweens are called match-makers for disembodied souls. They\r\n  acquaint the two families with each other’s circumstances, and\r\n  then cast lots for the marriage by order of the parents on both\r\n  sides. If they augur that the union will be a happy one, (wedding)\r\n  garments for the next world are cut out, and the match-makers\r\n  repair to the grave of the lad, there to set out wine and fruit\r\n  for the consummation of the marriage. Two seats are placed side\r\n  by side, and a small streamer is set up near each seat. If these\r\n  streamers move a little after the libation has been performed, the\r\n  souls are believed to approach each other; but if one of them does\r\n  not move, the party represented thereby is considered to disapprove\r\n  of the marriage. Each family has to reward its match-maker with a\r\n  present of woven stuffs. Such go-betweens make a regular livelihood\r\n  out of these proceedings.’”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The Ingushes of the Caucasus, according to Klaproth, have the same\r\n  custom: “If a man’s son dies, another who has lost his daughter\r\n  goes to the father and says, ‘Thy son will want a wife in the other\r\n  world; I will give him my daughter; pay me the price of the bride.’\r\n  Such a demand is never refused, even though the purchase of the\r\n  bride amount to thirty cows.” (_Travels, Eng. Trans._ 345.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—There is a little doubt about the reading of this last\r\n  paragraph. The G. T. has—“_Mès desormès volun retorner à nostre\r\n  conte en_ la grant plaingne _où nos estion quant nos comechames des\r\n  fais des Tartars_,” whilst Pauthier’s text has “_Mais desormais\r\n  vueil retourner à mon conte que Je lessai_ d’or plain _quant nous\r\n  commençames des faiz des Tatars.”_ The former reading looks very\r\n  like a misunderstanding of one similar to the latter, where _d’or\r\n  plain_ seems to be an adverbial expression, with some such meaning\r\n  as “just now,” “a while ago.” I have not, however, been able to\r\n  trace the expression elsewhere. Cotgrave has _or primes_, “but even\r\n  now,” etc.; and has also _de plain_, “presently, immediately, out\r\n  of hand.” It seems quite possible that _d’or plain_ should have had\r\n  the meaning suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n           SUNDRY PARTICULARS OF THE PLAIN BEYOND CARACORON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when you leave Caracoron and the Altay, in which they bury the\r\nbodies of the Tartar Sovereigns, as I told you, you go north for forty\r\ndays till you reach a country called the PLAIN OF BARGU.{1} The people\r\nthere are called MESCRIPT; they are a very wild race, and live by their\r\ncattle, the most of which are stags, and these stags, I assure you,\r\nthey used to ride upon. Their customs are like those of the Tartars,\r\nand they are subject to the Great Kaan. They have neither corn nor\r\nwine.[They get birds for food, for the country is full of lakes and\r\npools and marshes, which are much frequented by the birds when they are\r\nmoulting, and when they have quite cast their feathers and can’t fly,\r\nthose people catch them. They also live partly on fish.{2}]\r\n\r\nAnd when you have travelled forty days over this great plain you\r\ncome to the ocean, at the place where the mountains are in which the\r\nPeregrine falcons have their nests. And in those mountains it is so\r\ncold that you find neither man or woman, nor beast nor bird, except\r\none kind of bird called _Barguerlac_, on which the falcons feed. They\r\nare as big as partridges, and have feet like those of parrots and\r\na tail like a swallow’s, and are very strong in flight. And when\r\nthe Grand Kaan wants Peregrines from the nest, he sends thither to\r\nprocure them.{3} It is also on islands in that sea that the Gerfalcons\r\nare bred. You must know that the place is so far to the north that\r\nyou leave the North Star somewhat behind you towards the south! The\r\ngerfalcons are so abundant there that the Emperor can have as many as\r\nhe likes to send for. And you must not suppose that those gerfalcons\r\nwhich the Christians carry into the Tartar dominions go to the Great\r\nKaan; they are carried only to the Prince of the Levant.{4}\r\n\r\nNow I have told you all about the provinces northward as far as the\r\nOcean Sea, beyond which there is no more land at all; so I shall\r\nproceed to tell you of the other provinces on the way to the Great\r\nKaan. Let us, then, return to that province of which I spoke before,\r\ncalled Campichu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The readings differ as to the length of the journey. In\r\n  Pauthier’s text we seem to have first a journey of forty days from\r\n  near Karakorúm to the Plain of Bargu, and then a journey of forty\r\n  days more across the plain to the Northern Ocean. The G. T. seems\r\n  to present only _one_ journey of forty days (Ramusio, of sixty\r\n  days), but leaves the interval from Karakorúm undefined. I have\r\n  followed the former, though with some doubt.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This paragraph from Ramusio replaces the following in\r\n  Pauthier’s text: “In the summer they got abundance of game, both\r\n  beasts and birds, but in winter, there is none to be had because of\r\n  the great cold.”\r\n\r\n  Marco is here dealing, I apprehend, with hearsay geography,\r\n  and, as is common in like cases, there is great compression\r\n  of circumstances and characteristics, analogous to the like\r\n  compression of little-known regions in mediæval maps.\r\n\r\n  The name _Bargu_ appears to be the same with that often mentioned\r\n  in Mongol history as BARGUCHIN TUGRUM or BARGUTI, and which\r\n  Rashiduddin calls the northern limit of the inhabited earth. This\r\n  commenced about Lake Baikal, where the name still survives in that\r\n  of a river (_Barguzin_) falling into the Lake on the east side, and\r\n  of a town on its banks (_Barguzinsk_). Indeed, according to Rashid\r\n  himself, BARGU was the name of one of the tribes occupying the\r\n  plain; and a quotation from Father Hyacinth would seem to show that\r\n  the country is still called _Barakhu_.\r\n\r\n  [The Archimandrite Palladius (_Elucidations_, 16–17) writes:—“In\r\n  the Mongol text of Chingis Khan’s biography, this country is called\r\n  Barhu and Barhuchin; it is to be supposed, according to Colonel\r\n  Yule’s identification of this name with the modern Barguzin, that\r\n  this country was near Lake Baikal. The fact that Merkits were in\r\n  Bargu is confirmed by the following statement in Chingis Khan’s\r\n  biography: ‘When Chingis Khan defeated his enemies, the Merkits,\r\n  they fled to Barhuchin tokum.’ _Tokum_ signifies ‘a hollow, a low\r\n  place,’ according to the Chinese translation of the above-mentioned\r\n  biography, made in 1381; thus Barhuchin tokum undoubtedly\r\n  corresponds to M. Polo’s Plain of Bargu. As to M. Polo’s statement\r\n  that the inhabitants of Bargu were Merkits, it cannot be accepted\r\n  unconditionally. The Merkits were not indigenous to the country\r\n  near Baikal, but belonged originally,—according to a division\r\n  set forth in the Mongol text of the _Yuan ch’ao pi shi_,—to the\r\n  category of tribes _living in yurts_, _i.e._ nomad tribes, or tribes\r\n  of the desert. Meanwhile we find in the same biography of Chingis\r\n  Khan, mention of a people called Barhun, which belonged to the\r\n  category of tribes _living in the forests_; and we have therefore\r\n  reason to suppose that the Barhuns were the aborigines of Barhu.\r\n  After the time of Chingis Khan, this ethnographic name disappears\r\n  from Chinese history; it appears again in the middle of the 16th\r\n  century. The author of the _Yyu_ (1543–1544), in enumerating the\r\n  tribes inhabiting Mongolia and the adjacent countries, mentions\r\n  the Barhu, as a strong tribe, able to supply up to several tens of\r\n  thousands (?) of warriors, armed with steel swords; but the country\r\n  inhabited by them is not indicated. The Mongols, it is added, call\r\n  them Black Ta-tze (Khara Mongols, _i.e._ ‘Lower Mongols’).\r\n\r\n  “At the close of the 17th century, the Barhus are found inhabiting\r\n  the western slopes of the interior Hing’an, as well as between\r\n  Lake Kulon and River Khalkha, and dependent on a prince of eastern\r\n  Khalkhas, Doro beile. (Manchu title.)\r\n\r\n  “At the time of Galdan Khan’s invasion, a part of them fled to\r\n  Siberia with the eastern Khalkhas, but afterwards they returned.\r\n  [_Mung ku yew mu ki_ and _Lung sha ki lio_.] After their rebellion\r\n  in 1696, quelled by a Manchu General, they were included with\r\n  other petty tribes (regarding which few researches have been made)\r\n  in the category _butkha_, or hunters, and received a military\r\n  organisation. They are divided into Old and New Barhu, according\r\n  to the time when they were brought under Manchu rule. The Barhus\r\n  belong to the Mongolian, not to the Tungusian race; they are\r\n  sometimes considered even to have been in relationship with the\r\n  Khalkhas. (_He lung kiang wai ki_ and _Lung sha ki lio_.)\r\n\r\n  “This is all the substantial information we possess on the Barhu.\r\n  Is there an affinity to be found between the modern Barhus and the\r\n  Barhuns of Chingis Khan’s biography?—and is it to be supposed, that\r\n  in the course of time, they spread from Lake Baikal to the Hing’an\r\n  range? Or is it more correct to consider them a branch of the\r\n  Mongol race indigenous to the Hing’an Mountains, and which received\r\n  the general archaic name of Bargu, which might have pointed out the\r\n  physical character of the country they inhabited [_Kin Shi_], just\r\n  as we find in history the Urianhai of Altai and the Urianhai of\r\n  Western Manchuria? It is difficult to solve this question for want\r\n  of historical data.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  _Mescript_, or _Mecri_, as in G. T. The _Merkit_, a great tribe\r\n  to the south-east of the Baikal, were also called _Mekrit_, and\r\n  sometimes _Megrin_. The Mekrit are spoken of also by Carpini and\r\n  Rubruquis. D’Avezac thinks that the _Kerait_, and not the _Merkit_,\r\n  are intended by all three travellers. As regards Polo, I see\r\n  no reason for this view. The name he uses is _Mekrit_, and the\r\n  position which he assigns to them agrees fairly with that assigned\r\n  on good authority to the Merkit or Mekrit. Only, as in other cases,\r\n  where he is rehearsing hearsay information, it does not follow that\r\n  the identification of the name involves the correctness of all the\r\n  circumstances that he connects with that name. We saw in ch. xxx.\r\n  that under _Pashai_ he seemed to lump circumstances belonging to\r\n  various parts of the region from Badakhshan to the Indus; so here\r\n  under _Mekrit_ he embraces characteristics belonging to tribes\r\n  extending far beyond the Mekrit, and which in fact are appropriate\r\n  to the Tunguses. Rashiduddin seems to describe the latter under\r\n  the name of _Uriangkut_ of the Woods, a people dwelling beyond the\r\n  frontier of Barguchin, and in connection with whom he speaks of\r\n  their Reindeer obscurely, as well as of their tents of birch bark,\r\n  and their hunting on snow-shoes.\r\n\r\n  The mention of the Reindeer by Polo in this passage is one of the\r\n  interesting points which Pauthier’s text omits. Marsden objects\r\n  to the statement that the stags are ridden upon, and from this\r\n  motive mis-renders “_li qual’anche_ cavalcano,” as, “which\r\n  they make use of for the purpose of travelling.” Yet he might\r\n  have found in Witsen that the Reindeer are _ridden_ by various\r\n  Siberian Tribes, but especially by the Tunguses. Erman is very\r\n  full on the reindeer-riding of the latter people, having himself\r\n  travelled far in that way in going to Okhotsk, and gives a very\r\n  detailed description of the saddle, etc., employed. The reindeer\r\n  of the Tunguses are stated by the same traveller to be much larger\r\n  and finer animals than those of Lapland. They are also used for\r\n  pack-carriage and draught. Old Richard Eden says that the “olde\r\n  wryters” relate that “certayne Scythians doe ryde on Hartes.” I\r\n  have not traced to what he refers, but if the statement be in\r\n  any ancient author it is very remarkable. Some old editions of\r\n  Olaus Magnus have curious cuts of Laplanders and others riding on\r\n  reindeer, but I find nothing in the text appropriate. We hear from\r\n  travellers of the Lapland deer being occasionally mounted, but only\r\n  it would seem in sport, not as a practice. (_Erdmann_, 189, 191;\r\n  _D’Ohsson_, I. 103; _D’Avezac_, 534 _seqq._; _J. As._ sér. II.\r\n  tom. xi.; sér.

It\r\n  is evident that Marco had his information from an eye-witness,\r\n  though the whole picture is compressed. Wrangell, speaking of\r\n  Nijni Kolyma, says: “It is at the moulting season that the great\r\n  bird-hunts take place. The sportsmen surround the nests, and slip\r\n  their dogs, which drive the birds to the water, on which they are\r\n  easily knocked over with a gun or arrow, or even with a stick....\r\n  This chase is divided into several periods. They begin with the\r\n  ducks, which moult first; then come the geese; then the swans....\r\n  In each case the people take care to choose the time when the birds\r\n  have lost their feathers.” The whole calendar with the Yakuts\r\n  and Russian settlers on the Kolyma is a succession of fishing\r\n  and hunting seasons which the same author details. (I. 149, 150;\r\n  119–121.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—What little is said of the _Barguerlac_ points to some\r\n  bird of the genus _Pterocles_, or Sand Grouse (to which belong\r\n  the so-called Rock Pigeons of India), or to the allied _Tetrao\r\n  paradoxus_ of Pallas, now known as _Syrrhaptes Pallasii_. Indeed,\r\n  we find in Zenker’s Dictionary that _Boghurtláḳ_ (or _Baghírtláḳ_,\r\n  as it is in Pavet de Courteille’s) in Oriental Turkish is the\r\n  _Kata_, _i.e._ I presume, the _Pterocles alchata_ of Linnæus, or\r\n  Large Pin-tailed Sand Grouse. Mr. Gould, to whom I referred the\r\n  point, is clear that the _Syrrhaptes_ is Marco’s bird, and I\r\n  believe there can be no question of it.\r\n\r\n  [Passing through Ch’ang-k’ou, Mr. Rockhill found the people praying\r\n  for rain. “The people told me,” he says, in his _Journey_ (p. 9),\r\n  “that they knew long ago the year would be disastrous, for the\r\n  sand grouse had been more numerous of late than for years, and the\r\n  saying goes _Sha-ch’i kuo, mai lao-po_, ‘when the sand grouse fly\r\n  by, wives will be for sale.’”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The chief difficulty in identification with the Syrrhaptes or any\r\n  known bird, would be “the feet like a parrot’s.” The feet of the\r\n  Syrrhaptes are not indeed like a parrot’s, though its awkward,\r\n  slow, and waddling gait on the ground, may have suggested the\r\n  comparison; and though it has very odd and anomalous feet, a\r\n  circumstance which the Chinese indicate in another way by calling\r\n  the bird (according to Huc) _Lung Kio_, or “Dragon-foot.” [Mr.\r\n  Rockhill (_Journey_) writes in a note (p. 9): “I, for my part,\r\n  never heard any other name than _sha-ch’i_, ‘sand-fowl,’ given\r\n  them. This name is used, however, for a variety of birds, among\r\n  others the partridge.”—H. C.] The hind-toe is absent, the toes are\r\n  unseparated, recognisable only by the broad flat nails, and fitted\r\n  below with a callous couch, whilst the whole foot is covered with\r\n  short dense feathers like hair, and is more like a quadruped’s paw\r\n  than a bird’s foot.\r\n\r\n  The home of the Syrrhaptes is in the Altai, the Kirghiz Steppes,\r\n  and the country round Lake Baikal, though it also visits the North\r\n  of China in great flights. “On plains of grass and sandy deserts,”\r\n  says Gould (_Birds of Great Britain_, Part IV.), “at one season\r\n  covered with snow, and at another sun-burnt and parched by drought,\r\n  it finds a congenial home; in these inhospitable and little-known\r\n  regions it breeds, and when necessity compels it to do so, wings\r\n  its way ... over incredible distances to obtain water or food.” Huc\r\n  says, speaking of the bird on the northern frontier of China: “They\r\n  generally arrive in great flights from the north, especially when\r\n  much snow has fallen, flying with astonishing rapidity, so that the\r\n  movement of their wings produces a noise like hail.” It is said to\r\n  be very delicate eating. The bird owes its place in Gould’s _Birds\r\n  of Great Britain_ to the fact—strongly illustrative of its being\r\n  _moult volant_, as Polo says it is—that it appeared in England in\r\n  1859, and since then, at least up to 1863, continued to arrive\r\n  annually in pairs or companies in nearly all parts of our island,\r\n  from Penzance to Caithness. And Gould states that it was breeding\r\n  in the Danish islands. A full account by Mr. A. Newton of this\r\n  remarkable immigration is contained in the _Ibis_ for April, 1864,\r\n  and many details in _Stevenson’s Birds of Norfolk_, I. 376 _seqq._\r\n  There are plates of _Syrrhaptes_ in _Radde’s Reisen im Süden\r\n  von Ost-Sibirien_, Bd. II.; in vol. v. of _Temminck_, Planches\r\n  Coloriées, Pl. 95; in _Gould_, as above; in _Gray, Genera of\r\n  Birds_, vol. iii. p. 517 (life size); and in the _Ibis_ for April,\r\n  1860. From the last our cut is taken.\r\n\r\n  [See _A. David et Oustalet_, _Oiseaux de la Chine_, 389, on\r\n  _Syrrhaptes Pallasii_ or _Syrrhaptes Paradoxus_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Syrrhaptes Pallasii.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Gerfalcons (_Shonḳár_) were objects of high estimation\r\n  in the Middle Ages, and were frequent presents to and from royal\r\n  personages. Thus among the presents sent with an embassy from\r\n  King James II. of Aragon to the Sultan of Egypt, in 1314, we find\r\n  three white gerfalcons. They were sent in homage to Chinghiz and\r\n  to Kúblái, by the Kirghiz, but I cannot identify the mountains\r\n  where they or the Peregrines were found. The Peregrine falcon was\r\n  in Europe sometimes termed _Faucon Tartare_. (See _Ménage_ s.v.\r\n  _Sahin_.) The Peregrine of Northern Japan, and probably therefore\r\n  that of Siberia, is identical with that of Europe. Witsen speaks\r\n  of an island in the Sea of Tartary, from which falcons were got,\r\n  apparently referring to a Chinese map as his authority; but I know\r\n  nothing more of it. (_Capmany_, IV. 64–65; _Ibis_, 1862, p. 314;\r\n  _Witsen_, II. 656.)\r\n\r\n  [On the _Falco peregrinus_, Lin., and other Falcons, see Ed.\r\n  Blanc’s paper mentioned on p. 162. The _Falco Saker_ is to be found\r\n  all over Central Asia; it is called by the Pekingese _Hwang-yng_\r\n  (yellow falcon). (_David et Oustalet_, _Oiseaux de la Chine_,\r\n  31–32.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n           OF THE KINGDOM OF ERGUIUL, AND PROVINCE OF SINJU.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Campichu, then, you travel five days across a tract in which\r\nmany spirits are heard speaking in the night season; and at the end\r\nof those five marches, towards the east, you come to a kingdom called\r\nERGUIUL, belonging to the Great Kaan. It is one of the several kingdoms\r\nwhich make up the great Province of Tangut. The people consist of\r\nNestorian Christians, Idolaters, and worshippers of Mahommet.{1}\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of cities in this kingdom, but the capital is ERGUIUL.\r\nYou can travel in a south-easterly direction from this place into the\r\nprovince of Cathay. Should you follow that road to the south-east, you\r\ncome to a city called SINJU, belonging also to Tangut, and subject to\r\nthe Great Kaan, which has under it many towns and villages.{2} The\r\npopulation is composed of Idolaters, and worshippers of Mahommet, but\r\nthere are some Christians also. There are wild cattle in that country\r\n[almost] as big as elephants, splendid creatures, covered everywhere\r\nbut on the back with shaggy hair a good four palms long. They are\r\npartly black, partly white, and really wonderfully fine creatures [and\r\nthe hair or wool is extremely fine and white, finer and whiter than\r\nsilk. Messer Marco brought some to Venice as a great curiosity, and so\r\nit was reckoned by those who saw it]. There are also plenty of them\r\ntame, which have been caught young. [They also cross these with the\r\ncommon cow, and the cattle from this cross are wonderful beasts, and\r\nbetter for work than other animals.] These the people use commonly for\r\nburden and general work, and in the plough as well; and at the latter\r\nthey will do full twice as much work as any other cattle, being such\r\nvery strong beasts.{3}\r\n\r\nIn this country too is found the best musk in the world; and I will\r\ntell you how ’tis produced. There exists in that region a kind of wild\r\nanimal like a gazelle. It has feet and tail like the gazelle’s, and\r\nstag’s hair of a very coarse kind, but no horns. It has four tusks,\r\ntwo below and two above, about three inches long, and slender in form,\r\none pair growing upwards, and the other downwards. It is a very pretty\r\ncreature. The musk is found in this way. When the creature has been\r\ntaken, they find at the navel between the flesh and the skin something\r\nlike an impostume full of blood, which they cut out and remove with all\r\nthe skin attached to it. And the blood inside this impostume is the\r\nmusk that produces that powerful perfume. There is an immense number of\r\nthese beasts in the country we are speaking of. [The flesh is very good\r\nto eat. Messer Marco brought the dried head and feet of one of these\r\nanimals to Venice with him.{4}]\r\n\r\nThe people are traders and artizans, and also grow abundance of\r\ncorn. The province has an extent of 26 days’ journey. Pheasants are\r\nfound there twice as big as ours, indeed nearly as big as a peacock,\r\nand having tails of 7 to 10 palms in length; and besides them other\r\npheasants in aspect like our own, and birds of many other kinds, and\r\nof beautiful variegated plumage.{5} The people, who are Idolaters,\r\nare fat folks with little noses and black hair, and no beard, except\r\na few hairs on the upper lip. The women too have very smooth and\r\nwhite skins, and in every respect are pretty creatures. The men are\r\nvery sensual, and marry many wives, which is not forbidden by their\r\nreligion. No matter how base a woman’s descent may be, if she have\r\nbeauty she may find a husband among the greatest men in the land, the\r\nman paying the girl’s father and mother a great sum of money, according\r\nto the bargain that may be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—No approximation to the name of Erguiul in an appropriate\r\n  position has yet been elicited from Chinese or other Oriental\r\n  sources. We cannot go widely astray as to its position, five days\r\n  east of Kanchau. Klaproth identifies it with Liangchau-fu; Pauthier\r\n  with the neighbouring city of Yungchang, on the ground that the\r\n  latter was, in the time of Kúblái, the head of one of the _Lús_, or\r\n  Circles, of Kansuh or Tangut, which he has shown some reason for\r\n  believing to be the “kingdoms” of Marco.\r\n\r\n  It is probable, however, that the _town_ called by Polo Erguiul lay\r\n  north of both the cities named, and more in line with the position\r\n  assigned below to _Egrigaya_. (See note 1, ch. lviii.)\r\n\r\n  I may notice that the structure of the name Ergui-ul or Ergiu-ul,\r\n  has a look of analogy to that of _Tang-keu-ul_, named in the next\r\n  note.\r\n\r\n  [“Erguiul is Erichew of the Mongol text of the _Yuen ch’ao pi\r\n  shi_, Si-liang in the Chinese history, the modern _Liang chow fu_.\r\n  Klaproth, on the authority of Rashid-eddin, has already identified\r\n  this name with that of Si-liang.” (_Palladius_, p. 18.) M. Bonin\r\n  left Ning-h’ia at the end of July, 1899, and he crossed the desert\r\n  to Liangchau in fifteen days from east to west; he is the first\r\n  traveller who took this route: Prjevalsky went westward, passing by\r\n  the residence of the Prince of Alashan, and Obrutchev followed the\r\n  route south of Bonin’s.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—No doubt Marsden is right in identifying this with\r\n  SINING-CHAU, now Sining-fu, the Chinese city nearest to Tibet\r\n  and the Kokonor frontier. Grueber and Dorville, who passed it on\r\n  their way to Lhasa, in 1661, call it _urbs ingens_. Sining was\r\n  visited also by Huc and Gabet, who are unsatisfactory, as usually\r\n  on geographical matters. They also call it “an immense town,” but\r\n  thinly peopled, its commerce having been in part transferred to\r\n  Tang-keu-ul, a small town closer to the frontier.\r\n\r\n  [Sining belonged to the country called Hwang chung; in 1198,\r\n  under the Sung Dynasty, it was subjugated by the Chinese, and was\r\n  named Si-ning chau; at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty (from\r\n  1368), it was named Si-ning wei, and since 1726 Si-ning fu. (Cf.\r\n  Gueluy, _Chine_, p. 62.) From Liangchau, M. Bonin went to Sining\r\n  through the Lao kou kau pass and the Ta-Tung ho. Obrutchev and\r\n  Grum Grijmaïlo took the usual route from Kanchau to Sining. After\r\n  the murder of Dutreuil de Rhins at Tung bu _m_do, his companion,\r\n  Grenard, arrived at Sining, and left it on the 29th July, 1894.\r\n  Dr. Sven Hedin gives in his book his own drawing of a gate of\r\n  Sining-fu, where he arrived on the 25th November, 1896.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Sining is called by the Tibetans _Ziling_ or Jiling, by the Mongols\r\n  _Seling Khoto_. A shawl wool texture, apparently made in this\r\n  quarter, is imported into Kashmir and Ladak, under the name of\r\n  _S’ling_. I have supposed Sining to be also the _Zilm_ of which\r\n  Mr. Shaw heard at Yarkand, and am answerable for a note to that\r\n  effect on p. 38 of his _High Tartary_. But Mr. Shaw, on his return\r\n  to Europe, gave some rather strong reasons against this. (See\r\n  _Proc. R. G. S._ XVI. 245; _Kircher_, pp. 64, 66; _Della Penna_,\r\n  27; _Davies’s Report_, App. p. ccxxix.; _Vigne_, II. 110, 129.)\r\n  [At present Sining is called by the Tibetans Seling K’ar or Kuar,\r\n  and by the Mongols, Seling K’utun, _K’ar_ and _K’utun_ meaning\r\n  “fortified city.” (_Rockhill, Land of the Lamas_, 49, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Diary of a Journey_, 65) writes: “There must be\r\n  some Scotch blood in the Hsi-ningites, for I find they are very\r\n  fond of oatmeal and of cracked wheat. The first is called _yen-mei\r\n  ch’en_, and is eaten boiled with the water in which mutton has been\r\n  cooked, or with neat’s-foot oil (_yang-t’i yu_). The cracked wheat\r\n  (_mei-tzŭ fan_) is eaten prepared in the same way, and is a very\r\n  good dish.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The _Dong_, or Wild Yak, has till late years only been\r\n  known by vague rumour. It has always been famed in native reports\r\n  for its great fierceness. The _Haft Iḳlím_ says that “it kills with\r\n  its horns, by its kicks, by treading under foot, and by tearing\r\n  with its teeth,” whilst the Emperor Humáyún himself told Sidi ’Ali,\r\n  the Turkish admiral, that when it had knocked a man down it skinned\r\n  him from head to heels by licking him with its tongue! Dr. Campbell\r\n  states, in the _Journal of the As. Soc. of Bengal_, that it was\r\n  said to be four times the size of the domestic Yak. The horns are\r\n  alleged to be sometimes three feet long, and of immense girth; they\r\n  are handed round full of strong drink at the festivals of Tibetan\r\n  grandees, as the Urus horns were in Germany, according to Cæsar.\r\n\r\n  A note, with which I have been favoured by Dr. Campbell (long\r\n  the respected Superintendent of British Sikkim) says: “Captain\r\n  Smith, of the Bengal Army, who had travelled in Western Tibet,\r\n  told me that he had shot many wild Yaks in the neighbourhood of\r\n  the Mansarawar Lake, and that he measured a bull which was 18\r\n  hands high, _i.e._ 6 feet. All that he saw were _black_ all over. He\r\n  also spoke to the fierceness of the animal. He was once charged\r\n  by a bull that he had wounded, and narrowly escaped being killed.\r\n  Perhaps my statement (above referred to) in regard to the relative\r\n  size of the Wild and Tame Yak, may require modification if applied\r\n  to all the countries in which the Yak is found. At all events,\r\n  the finest specimen of the tame Yak I ever saw, was not in Nepal,\r\n  Sikkim, Tibet, or Bootan, but in the _Jardin des Plantes_ at\r\n  _Paris_; and that one, a male, was brought from Shanghai. The best\r\n  drawing of a Yak I know is that in Turner’s _Tibet_.”\r\n\r\n  [Lieutenant Samuel Turner gave a very good description of the Yak\r\n  of Tartary, which he calls _Soora-Goy_, or the Bushy-tailed Bull of\r\n  Tibet. (_Asiat. Researches_, No. XXIII, pp. 351–353, with a plate.)\r\n  He says with regard to the colour: “There is a great variety of\r\n  colours amongst them, but black or white are the most prevalent. It\r\n  is not uncommon to see the long hair upon the ridge of the back,\r\n  the tail, tuft upon the chest, and the legs below the knee white,\r\n  when all the rest of the animal is jet black.” A good drawing of\r\n  “an enormous” Yak is to be found on p. 183 of Captain Wellby’s\r\n  _Unknown Tibet_. (See also Captain Deasy’s work on _Tibet_, p.\r\n  363.) Prince Henri d’Orléans brought home a fine specimen, which\r\n  he shot during his journey with Bonvalot; it is now exhibited in\r\n  the galleries of the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle. Some Yaks were\r\n  brought to Paris on the 1st April, 1854, and the celebrated artist,\r\n  Mme. Rosa Bonheur, made sketches after them. (See _Jour. Soc.\r\n  Acclimatation_, June, 1900, 39–40.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Captain Prjevalsky, in his recent journey (1872–1873), shot twenty\r\n  wild Yaks south of the Koko Nor. He specifies one as 11 feet in\r\n  length exclusive of the tail, which was 3 feet more; the height\r\n  6 feet. He speaks of the Yak as less formidable than it looks,\r\n  from apathy and stupidity, but very hard to kill; one having taken\r\n  eighteen bullets before it succumbed.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, 151, note) writes: “The average load\r\n  carried by a Yak is about 250 lbs. The wild Yak bull is an enormous\r\n  animal, and the people of Turkestan and North Tibet credit him with\r\n  extraordinary strength. Mirza Haidar, in the _Tarikhi Rashidi_,\r\n  says of the wild Yak or _kutás_: ‘This is a very wild and ferocious\r\n  beast. In whatever manner it attacks one it proves fatal. Whether\r\n  it strikes with its horns, or kicks, or overthrows its victim. If\r\n  it has no opportunity of doing any of these things, it tosses\r\n  its enemy with its tongue twenty _gaz_ into the air, and he is\r\n  dead before reaching the ground. One male _kutás_ is a load for\r\n  twelve horses. One man cannot possibly raise a shoulder of the\r\n  animal.’”—Captain Deasy (_In Tibet_, 363) says: “In a few places\r\n  on lofty ground in Tibet we found Yaks in herds numbering from\r\n  ten to thirty, and sometimes more. Most of the animals are black,\r\n  brown specimens being very rare. Their roving herds move with great\r\n  agility over the steep and stony ground, apparently enjoying the\r\n  snow and frost and wind, which seldom fail.... Yaks are capable of\r\n  offering formidable resistance to the sportsman....”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The tame Yaks are never, I imagine, “caught young,” as Marco says;\r\n  it is a domesticated _breed_, though possibly, as with buffaloes in\r\n  Bengal, the breed may occasionally be refreshed by a cross of wild\r\n  blood. They are employed for riding, as beasts of burden, and in\r\n  the plough. [Lieutenant S. Turner, _l.c._, says, on the other hand:\r\n  “They are never employed in agriculture, but are extremely useful\r\n  as beasts of burthen.”—H. C.] In the higher parts of our Himalayan\r\n  provinces, and in Tibet, the Yak itself is most in use; but in the\r\n  less elevated tracts several breeds crossed with the common Indian\r\n  cattle are more used. They have a variety of names according to\r\n  their precise origin. The inferior Yaks used in the plough are ugly\r\n  enough, and “have more the appearance of large shaggy bears than\r\n  of oxen,” but the Yak used for riding, says Hoffmeister, “is an\r\n  infinitely handsomer animal. It has a stately hump, a rich silky\r\n  hanging tail nearly reaching the ground, twisted horns, a noble\r\n  bearing, and an erect head.” Cunningham, too, says that the _Dso_,\r\n  one of the mixed breeds, is “a very handsome animal, with long\r\n  shaggy hair, generally black and white.” Many of the various tame\r\n  breeds appear to have the tail and back white, and also the fringe\r\n  under the body, but black and red are the prevailing colours. Some\r\n  of the crossbred cows are excellent milkers, better than either\r\n  parent stock.\r\n\r\n  Notice in this passage the additional and interesting particulars\r\n  given by Ramusio, _e.g._ the use of the mixed breeds. “Finer than\r\n  silk,” is an exaggeration, or say an _hyberbole_, as is the\r\n  following expression, “As big as elephants,” even with Ramusio’s\r\n  apologetic _quasi_. Cæsar says the Hercynian Urus was _magnitudine\r\n  paullo infra elephantos_.\r\n\r\n  The tame Yak is used across the breadth of Mongolia. Rubruquis saw\r\n  them at Karakorum, and describes them well. Mr. Ney Elias tells\r\n  me he found Yaks common everywhere along his route in Mongolia,\r\n  between the Tui river (long. _circa_ 101°) and the upper valleys of\r\n  the Kobdo near the Siberian frontier. At Uliasut’ai they were used\r\n  occasionally by Chinese settlers for drawing carts, but he never\r\n  saw them used for loads or for riding, as in Tibet. He has also\r\n  seen Yaks in the neighbourhood of Kwei-hwa-ch’eng. (_Tenduc_, see\r\n  ch. lix. note 1.) This may be taken as the eastern limit of the\r\n  employment of the Yak; the western limit is in the highlands of\r\n  Khokand.\r\n\r\n  These animals had been noticed by Cosmas [who calls them\r\n  _agriobous_] in the 6th century, and by Ælian in the 3rd. The\r\n  latter speaks of them as black cattle with white tails, from which\r\n  fly-flappers were made for Indian kings. And the great Kalidása\r\n  thus sang of the Yak, according to a learned (if somewhat rugged)\r\n  version ascribed to Dr. Mill. The poet personifies the Himálaya:—\r\n\r\n      “For Him the large Yaks in his cold plains that bide\r\n       Whisk here and there, playful, their tails’ bushy pride,\r\n       And evermore flapping those fans of long hair\r\n       Which borrowed moonbeams have made splendid and fair,\r\n       Proclaim at each stroke (what our flapping men sing)\r\n       His title of Honour, ‘The Dread Mountain King.’”\r\n\r\n  Who can forget Père Huc’s inimitable picture of the hairy Yaks\r\n  of their caravan, after passing a river in the depth of winter,\r\n  “walking with their legs wide apart, and bearing an enormous\r\n  load of stalactites, which hung beneath their bellies quite to\r\n  the ground. The monstrous beasts _looked exactly as if they were\r\n  preserved in sugar-candy_.” Or that other, even more striking,\r\n  of a great troop of wild Yaks, caught in the upper waters of the\r\n  Kin-sha Kiang, as they swam, in the moment of congelation, and thus\r\n  preserved throughout the winter, gigantic “flies in amber.”\r\n\r\n  (_N. et E._ XIV. 478; _J.

The flesh of the animal is eaten by the\r\n  Chinese, and in Siberia by both Tartars and Russians, but that of\r\n  the males has a strong musk flavour.\r\n\r\n  The “immense number” of these animals that existed in the Himalayan\r\n  countries may be conceived from Tavernier’s statement, that on one\r\n  visit to Patna, then the great Indian mart for this article, he\r\n  purchased 7673 pods of musk. These presumably came by way of Nepal;\r\n  but musk pods of the highest class were also imported from Khotan\r\n  _viâ_ Yarkand and Leh, and the lowest price such a pod fetched at\r\n  Yarkand was 250 tankas, or upwards of 4_l._ This import has long\r\n  been extinct, and indeed the trade in the article, except towards\r\n  China, has altogether greatly declined, probably (says Mr. Hodgson)\r\n  because its repute as a medicine is becoming fast exploded. In\r\n  Sicily it is still so used, but apparently only as a sort of decent\r\n  medical _viaticum_, for when it is said “the Doctors have given him\r\n  musk,” it is as much as to say that they have given up the patient.\r\n\r\n  [“Here Marco Polo speaks of musk; musk and rhubarb (which he\r\n  mentions before, Sukchur, ch. xliii.) are the most renowned\r\n  and valuable of the products of the province of Kansu, which\r\n  comparatively produces very little; the industry in both these\r\n  articles is at present in the hands of the Tanguts of that province\r\n  [_Su chow chi_].” (_Palladius_, p. 18.)\r\n\r\n  Writing under date 15th February, 1892, from Lusar (coming from\r\n  Sining), Mr. Rockhill says: “The musk trade here is increasing,\r\n  Cantonese and Ssŭ-ch’uanese traders now come here to buy it, paying\r\n  for good musk four times its weight in silver (_ssŭ huan_, as they\r\n  say). The best test of its purity is an examination of the colour.\r\n  The Tibetans adulterate it by mixing tsamba and blood with it. The\r\n  best time to buy it is from the seventh to the ninth moon (latter\r\n  part of August to middle of November).” Mr. Rockhill adds in a\r\n  note: “Mongols call musk _owo_; Tibetans call it _latsé_. The best\r\n  musk they say is ‘white musk,’ _tsahan owo_ in Mongol, in Tibetan\r\n  _latsé karpo_. I do not know whether white refers to the colour of\r\n  the musk itself or to that of the hair on the skin covering the\r\n  musk pouch.” (_Diary of a Journey_, p. 71.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Three species of the _Moschus_ are found in the Mountains of Tibet,\r\n  and _M. Chrysogaster_, which Mr. Hodgson calls “the loveliest,” and\r\n  which chiefly supplies the highly-prized pod called _Kághazi_, or\r\n  “Thin-as-paper,” is almost exclusively confined to the Chinese\r\n  frontier. Like the Yak, the _Moschus_ is mentioned by Cosmas\r\n  (_circa_ A.D. 545), and _musk_ appears in a Greek prescription by\r\n  Aëtius of Amida, a physician practising at Constantinople about the\r\n  same date.\r\n\r\n  (_Martini_, p. 39; _Tav., Des Indes_, Bk.

Mr. Gould has identified\r\n  this bird with Marco’s in his magnificent _Birds of Asia_, and\r\n  has been kind enough to show me a specimen which, with the body,\r\n  measured 6 feet 8 inches. The tail feathers alone, however, are\r\n  said to reach to 6 and 7 feet, so that Marco’s ten palms was\r\n  scarcely an exaggeration. These tail-feathers are often seen on\r\n  the Chinese stage in the cap of the hero of the drama, and also\r\n  decorate the hats of certain civil functionaries.\r\n\r\n  _Size_ is the point in which the bird fails to meet Marco’s\r\n  description. In that respect the latter would rather apply to\r\n  the _Crossoptilon auritum_, which is nearly as big as a turkey,\r\n  or to the glorious _Múnál (Lophophorus impeyanus)_, but then that\r\n  has no length of tail. The latter seems to be the bird described\r\n  by Ælian: “Magnificent cocks which have the crest variegated\r\n  and ornate like a crown of flowers, and the tail feathers not\r\n  curved like a cock’s, but broad and carried in a train like a\r\n  peacock’s; the feathers are partly golden, and partly azure or\r\n  emerald-coloured.” (_Wood’s Birds_, 610, from which I have copied\r\n  the illustration; _Williams, M. K._ I. 261; _Æl. De Nat. An._ XVI.\r\n  2.) A species of _Crossoptilon_ has recently been found by Captain\r\n  Prjevalsky in Alashan, the Egrigaia (as I believe) of next chapter,\r\n  and one also by Abbé Armand David at the Koko Nor.\r\n\r\n  [See on the Phasianidæ family in Central and Western Asia,\r\n  _David et Oustalet, Oiseaux de la Chine_, 401–421; the _Phasianus\r\n  Reevesii_ or _veneratus_ is called by the Chinese of Tung-lin, near\r\n  Peking, _Djeu-ky_ (hen-arrow); the _Crossoptilon auritum_ is named\r\n  _Ma-ky_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n                      OF THE KINGDOM OF EGRIGAIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting again from Erguiul you ride eastward for eight days, and\r\nthen come to a province called EGRIGAIA, containing numerous cities\r\nand villages, and belonging to Tangut.{1} The capital city is called\r\nCALACHAN.{2} The people are chiefly Idolaters, but there are fine\r\nchurches belonging to the Nestorian Christians. They are all subjects\r\nof the Great Kaan. They make in this city great quantities of camlets\r\nof camel’s wool, the finest in the world; and some of the camlets that\r\nthey make are white, for they have white camels, and these are the best\r\nof all. Merchants purchase these stuffs here, and carry them over the\r\nworld for sale.{3}\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed eastward from this place and enter the territory\r\nthat was formerly Prester John’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Chinghiz invaded Tangut in all five times, viz. in 1205,\r\n  1207, 1209 (or according to Erdmann, 1210–1211), 1218, and\r\n  1226–1227, on which last expedition he died.\r\n\r\n  _A_. In the third invasion, according to D’Ohsson’s Chinese guide\r\n  (Father Hyacinth), he took the town of _Uiraca_, and the fortress\r\n  of Imen, and laid siege to the capital, then called Chung-sing or\r\n  Chung-hing, now Ning-hsia.\r\n\r\n  Rashid, in a short notice of this campaign, calls the first city\r\n  _Erica_, _Erlaca_, or, as Erdmann has it, _Artacki_. In De Mailla\r\n  it is _Ulahai_.\r\n\r\n  _B_. On the last invasion (1226), D’Ohsson’s Chinese authority says\r\n  that Chinghiz took Kanchau and Suhchau, Cholo and Khola in the\r\n  province of Liangcheu, and then proceeded to the Yellow River, and\r\n  invested Lingchau, south of Ning-hsia.\r\n\r\n  Erdmann, following his reading of Rashiduddin, says Chinghiz\r\n  took the cities of Tangut, called _Arucki_, _Kachu_, _Sichu_,\r\n  and _Kamichu_, and besieged Deresgai (D’Ohsson, _Derssekai_),\r\n  whilst Shidergu, the King of Tangut, betook himself to his capital\r\n  _Artackin_.\r\n\r\n  D’Ohsson, also professing to follow Rashid, calls this “his capital\r\n  _Irghai_, which the Mongols call _Ircaya_.” Klaproth, illustrating\r\n  Polo, reads “Eyircai, which the Mongols call _Eyircayá_.”\r\n\r\n  Pétis de la Croix, relating the same campaign and professing to\r\n  follow Fadlallah, _i.e._ Rashiduddin, says the king “retired to his\r\n  fortress of _Arbaca_.”\r\n\r\n  _C_. Sanang Setzen several times mentions a city called _Irghai_,\r\n  _apparently_ in Tangut; but all we can gather as to his position is\r\n  that it seems to have lain east of Kanchau.\r\n\r\n  We perceive that the _Arbaca_ of P. de la Croix, the _Eyircai_ of\r\n  Klaproth, the _Uiraca_ of D’Ohsson, the _Artacki_ or _Artackin_ of\r\n  Erdmann, are all various readings or forms of the same name, and\r\n  are the same with the Chinese form _Ulahai_ of De Mailla, and most\r\n  probably the place is the _Egrigaia_ of Polo.\r\n\r\n  We see also that Erdmann mentions another place _Aruki_ (ارقى?)\r\n  in connection with Kanchau and Suhchau. This is, I suspect, the\r\n  _Erguiul_ of Polo, and perhaps the Irghai of Sanang Setzen.\r\n\r\n  Rashiduddin seems wrong in calling Ircayá the capital of the king,\r\n  a circumstance which leads Klaproth to identify it with Ning-hsia.\r\n  Pauthier, identifying Ulahai with Egrigaya, shows that the former\r\n  was one of the circles of Tangut, but _not_ that of Ning-hsia. Its\r\n  position, he says, is uncertain. Klaproth, however, inserts it in\r\n  his map of Asia, in the era of Kúblái (_Tabl. Hist._ pl. 22), as\r\n  _Ulakhai_ to the north of Ning-hsia, near the great bend eastward\r\n  of the Hwang-Ho. Though it may have extended in this direction, it\r\n  is probable, from the name referred to in next note, that Egrigaia\r\n  or Ulahai is represented by the modern principality of ALASHAN,\r\n  visited by Prjevalsky in 1871 and 1872.\r\n\r\n  [New travels and researches enable me to say that there can be\r\n  no doubt that _Egrigaia = Ning-hsia_. Palladius (_l.c._ 18) says:\r\n  “_Egrigaia_ is Erigaia of the Mongol text. Klaproth was correct\r\n  in his supposition that it is modern Ning-h’ia. Even now the\r\n  Eleuths of Alashan call Ning-h’ia, _Yargai_. In M. Polo’s time\r\n  this department was famous for the cultivation of the Safflower\r\n  (_carthamus tinctorius_). [_Siu t’ung kien_, A.D. 1292.]” Mr.\r\n  Rockhill (cf. his _Diary of a Journey_) writes to me that Ning-hsia\r\n  is still called _Irge Khotun_ by Mongols at the present day. M.\r\n  Bonin (_J. As._, 1900. I. 585) mentions the same fact.\r\n\r\n  Palladius (19) adds: “_Erigaia_ is not to be confounded with\r\n  _Urahai_, often mentioned in the history of Chingis Khan’s wars\r\n  with the Tangut kingdom. Urahai was a fortress in a pass of the\r\n  same name in the Alashan Mountains. Chingis Khan spent five months\r\n  there (an. 1208), during which he invaded and plundered the country\r\n  in the neighbourhood. [_Si hia shu shi._] The Alashan Mountains\r\n  form a semicircle 500 _li_ in extent, and have over forty narrow\r\n  passes leading to the department of Ning-hia; the broadest and most\r\n  practicable of these is now called Ch’i-mu-K’ow; it is not more\r\n  than 80 feet broad. [_Ning hia fu chi._] It may be that the Urahai\r\n  fortress existed near this pass.”\r\n\r\n  “From Liang-chow fu, M. Polo follows a special route, leaving the\r\n  modern postal route on his right; the road he took has, since the\r\n  time of the Emperor K’ang-hi, been called the courier’s route.”\r\n  (_Palladius_, 18.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—_Calachan_, the chief town of Egrigaia, is mentioned,\r\n  according to Klaproth, by Rashiduddin, among the cities of Tangut,\r\n  as KALAJÁN. The name and approximate position suggest, as just\r\n  noticed, identity with Alashan, the modern capital of which, called\r\n  by Prjevalsky Dyn-yuan-yin, stands some distance west of the\r\n  Hwang-Ho, in about lat. 39°. Polo gives no data for the interval\r\n  between this and his next stage.\r\n\r\n  [The _Dyn-yuan-yin_ of Prjevalsky is the camp of _Ting-yuan-yng_\r\n  or Fu-ma-fu of M. Bonin, the residence of the Si-wang (western\r\n  prince), of Alashan, an abbreviation of Alade-shan (_shan_,\r\n  mountain in Chinese), Alade = Eleuth or Œlöt; the sister of this\r\n  prince married a son of Prince Tuan, the chief of the _Boxers_.\r\n  (_La Géographie_, 1901. I. 118.) Palladius (_l.c._ 19) says: “Under\r\n  the name of Calachan, Polo probably means the summer residence of\r\n  the Tangut kings, which was 60 _li_ from Ning-hia, at the foot\r\n  of the Alashan Mountains. It was built by the famous Tangut king\r\n  Yuen-hao, on a large scale, in the shape of a castle, in which\r\n  were high terraces and magnificent buildings. Traces of these\r\n  buildings are visible to this day. There are often found coloured\r\n  tiles and iron nails 1 foot, and even 2 feet long. The last Tangut\r\n  kings made this place their permanent residence, and led there\r\n  an indolent and sensual life. The Chinese name of this residence\r\n  was Ho-lan shan _Li-Kung_. There is sufficient reason to suppose\r\n  that this very residence is named (under the year 1226) in the\r\n  Mongol text _Alashai nuntuh_; and in the chronicles of the Tangut\r\n  Kingdom, _Halahachar_, otherwise _Halachar_, apparently in the\r\n  Tangut language. Thus M. Polo’s Calachan can be identified with the\r\n  Halachar of the _Si hia shu shi_, and can be taken to designate the\r\n  Alashan residence of the Tangut kings.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Among the Buraets and Chinese at Kiakhta snow-white camels,\r\n  without albino character, are often seen, and probably in other\r\n  parts of Mongolia. (See _Erdmann_, II. 261.) Philostratus tells us\r\n  that the King of Taxila furnished white camels to Apollonius. I\r\n  doubt if the present King of Taxila, whom Anglo-Indians call the\r\n  Commissioner of Ráwal Pindi, could do the like.\r\n\r\n  _Cammellotti_ appear to have been fine woollen textures, by no\r\n  means what are now called camlets, nor were they necessarily of\r\n  camel’s wool, for those of Angora goat’s wool were much valued.\r\n  M. Douet d’Arcq calls it “a fine stuff of wool approaching to our\r\n  Cashmere, and sometimes of silk.” Indeed, as Mr. Marsh points\r\n  out, the word is Arabic, and has nothing to do with _Camel_ in\r\n  its origin; though it evidently came to be associated therewith.\r\n  _Khamlat_ is defined in F. Johnson’s Dict.: “Camelot, silk and\r\n  camel’s hair; also all silk or velvet, especially pily and plushy,”\r\n  and _Khaml_ is “pile or plush.” _Camelin_ was a different and\r\n  inferior material. There was till recently a considerable import\r\n  of different kinds of woollen goods from this part of China into\r\n  Ladakh, Kashmir, and the northern Panjáb. [Leaving Ning-hsia, Mr.\r\n  Rockhill writes (_Diary_, 1892, 44): “We passed on the road a cart\r\n  with Jardine and Matheson’s flag, coming probably from Chung-Wei\r\n  Hsien, where camel’s wool is sold in considerable quantities to\r\n  foreigners. This trade has fallen off very much in the last three\r\n  or four years on account of the Chinese middlemen rolling the\r\n  wool in the dirt so as to add to its weight, and practising other\r\n  tricks on buyers.”—H. C.] Among the names of these were _Sling_,\r\n  _Shirum_, _Gurun_, and _Khoza_, said to be the names of the towns\r\n  in China where the goods were made. We have supposed _Sling_ to be\r\n  Sining (note 2, ch. lvii.), but I can make nothing of the others.\r\n  Cunningham also mentions “camlets of camel’s hair,” under the name\r\n  of _Suḳlát_, among imports from the same quarter. The term _Suḳlát_\r\n  is, however, applied in the _Panjáb_ trade returns to _broadcloth_.\r\n  Does not this point to the real nature of the _siclatoun_ of the\r\n  Middle Ages? It is, indeed, often spoken of as used for banners,\r\n  which implies that it was not a _heavy_ woollen:\r\n\r\n      “There was mony gonfanoun\r\n       Of gold, sendel, and siclatoun.”\r\n                        (_King Alisaundre_, in Weber, I. 85.)\r\n\r\n  But it was also a material for ladies’ robes, for quilts,\r\n  leggings, housings, pavilions. Franc. Michel does not decide what\r\n  it was, only that it was generally _red_ and wrought with gold.\r\n  Dozy renders it “silk stuff brocaded with gold”; but this seems\r\n  conjectural. Dr. Rock says it was a thin glossy silken stuff, often\r\n  with a woof of gold thread, and seems to derive it from the Arabic\r\n  ṣaḳl, “polishing” (a sword), which is improbable. Perhaps the name\r\n  is connected with _Ṣiḳiliyat_, “Sicily.”\r\n\r\n  (_Marsh on Wedgwood_, and _on Webster_ in _N. Y.

It\r\nis obtained from a kind of vein in the earth, and is of very fine\r\nquality.{3} There is also a great manufacture of fine camlets of\r\ndifferent colours from camel’s hair. The people get their living by\r\ntheir cattle and tillage, as well as by trade and handicraft.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the province is in the hands of the Christians, as I have\r\ntold you; but there are also plenty of Idolaters and worshippers of\r\nMahommet. And there is also here a class of people called _Argons_,\r\nwhich is as much as to say in French _Guasmul_, or, in other words,\r\nsprung from two different races: to wit, of the race of the Idolaters\r\nof Tenduc and of that of the worshippers of Mahommet. They are\r\nhandsomer men than the other natives of the country, and having more\r\nability, they come to have authority; and they are also capital\r\nmerchants.{4}\r\n\r\nYou must know that it was in this same capital city of Tenduc that\r\nPrester John had the seat of his government when he ruled over the\r\nTartars, and his heirs still abide there; for, as I have told you, this\r\nKing George is of his line, in fact, he is the sixth in descent from\r\nPrester John.\r\n\r\nHere also is what _we_ call the country of GOG and MAGOG; _they_,\r\nhowever, call it UNG and MUNGUL, after the names of two races of people\r\nthat existed in that Province before the migration of the Tartars.\r\n_Ung_ was the title of the people of the country, and _Mungul_ a name\r\nsometimes applied to the Tartars.{5}\r\n\r\nAnd when you have ridden seven days eastward through this province\r\nyou get near the provinces of Cathay. You find throughout those seven\r\ndays’ journey plenty of towns and villages, the inhabitants of which\r\nare Mahommetans, but with a mixture also of Idolaters and Nestorian\r\nChristians. They get their living by trade and manufactures; weaving\r\nthose fine cloths of gold which are called _Nasich_ and _Naques_,\r\nbesides silk stuffs of many other kinds. For just as we have cloths of\r\nwool in our country, manufactured in a great variety of kinds, so in\r\nthose regions they have stuffs of silk and gold in like variety.{6}\r\n\r\nAll this region is subject to the Great Kaan. There is a city you come\r\nto called SINDACHU, where they carry on a great many crafts such as\r\nprovide for the equipment of the Emperor’s troops. In a mountain of the\r\nprovince there is a very good silver mine, from which much silver is\r\ngot: the place is called YDIFU. The country is well stocked with game,\r\nboth beast and bird.{7}\r\n\r\nNow we will quit that province and go three days’ journey forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Marco’s own errors led commentators much astray about\r\n  Tanduc or Tenduc, till Klaproth put the matter in its true light.\r\n\r\n  Our traveller says that Tenduc had been the seat of Aung Khan’s\r\n  sovereignty; he has already said that it had been the scene of\r\n  his final defeat, and he tells us that it was still the residence\r\n  of his descendants in their reduced state. To the last piece of\r\n  information he can speak as a witness, and he is corroborated by\r\n  other evidence; but the second statement we have seen to be almost\r\n  certainly erroneous; about the first we cannot speak positively.\r\n\r\n  Klaproth pointed out the true position of Tenduc in the vicinity\r\n  of the great northern bend of the Hwang-Ho, quoting Chinese\r\n  authorities to show that _Thianté_ or _Thianté-Kiun_ was the name\r\n  of a district or group of towns to the north of that bend, a name\r\n  which he supposes to be the original of Polo’s _Tenduc_. The\r\n  general position entirely agrees with Marco’s indications; it lies\r\n  on his way eastward from Tangut towards Chagannor, and Shangtu (see\r\n  ch. lx., lxi.), whilst in a later passage (Bk. II. ch. lxiv.), he\r\n  speaks of the Caramoran or Hwang-Ho in its lower course, as “coming\r\n  from the lands of Prester John.”\r\n\r\n  M. Pauthier finds severe fault with Klaproth’s identification of\r\n  the _name_ Tenduc with the Thianté of the Chinese, belonging to a\r\n  city which had been destroyed 300 years before, whilst he himself\r\n  will have that name to be a corruption of _Tathung_. The latter is\r\n  still the name of a city and Fu of northern Shansi, but in Mongol\r\n  time its circle of administration extended beyond the Chinese\r\n  wall, and embraced territory on the left of the Hwang-Ho, being\r\n  in fact the first _Lu_, or circle, entered on leaving Tangut, and\r\n  therefore, Pauthier urges, the “Kingdom of Tanduc” of our text.\r\n\r\n  I find it hard to believe that Marco could get no nearer TATHUNG\r\n  than in the form of _Tanduc_ or _Tenduc_. The origin of the last\r\n  may have been some Mongol name, not recovered. But it is at least\r\n  conceivable that a name based on the old _Thianté-Kiun_ might\r\n  have been retained among the Tartars, from whom, and not from the\r\n  Chinese, Polo took his nomenclature. Thianté had been, according to\r\n  Pauthier’s own quotations, the _military post of Tathung_; Klaproth\r\n  cites a Chinese author of the Mongol era, who describes the\r\n  Hwang-Ho as passing through _the territory of the ancient Chinese\r\n  city of Thianté_; and Pauthier’s own quotation from the Modern\r\n  Imperial Geography seems to imply that a place in that territory\r\n  was recently known as Fung-chau-_Thianté-Kiun_.\r\n\r\n  In the absence of preciser indications, it is reasonable to suppose\r\n  that the Plain of Tenduc, with its numerous towns and villages, was\r\n  the extensive and well-cultivated plain which stretches from the\r\n  Hwang-Ho, past the city of Kuku-Khotan, or “Blue Town.” This tract\r\n  abounds in the remains of cities attributed to the Mongol era.\r\n  And it is not improbable that the city of Tenduc was Kuku-Khotan\r\n  itself, now called by the Chinese Kwei-hwa Ch’eng, but which was\r\n  known to them in the Middle Ages as _Tsing-chau_, and to which we\r\n  find the Kin Emperor of Northern China sending an envoy in 1210\r\n  to demand tribute from Chinghiz. The city is still an important\r\n  mart and a centre of Lamaitic Buddhism, being the residence of a\r\n  _Khutukhtu_, or personage combining the characters of cardinal and\r\n  voluntarily re-incarnate saint, as well as the site of five great\r\n  convents and fifteen smaller ones. Gerbillon notes that Kuku Khotan\r\n  had been a place of great trade and population during the Mongol\r\n  Dynasty.\r\n\r\n  [The following evidence shows, I think, that we must look for the\r\n  city of Tenduc to _Tou Ch’eng_ or _Toto Ch’eng_, called _Togto_ or\r\n  _Tokto_ by the Mongols. Mr. Rockhill (_Diary_, 18) passed through\r\n  this place, and 5 _li_ south of it, reached on the Yellow River,\r\n  Ho-k’ou (in Chinese) or Dugus or Dugei (in Mongol). Gerbillon\r\n  speaks of Toto in his sixth voyage in Tartary. (_Du Halde_,\r\n  IV. 345.) Mr. Rockhill adds that he cannot but think that Yule\r\n  overlooked the existence of Togto when he identified Kwei-hwa\r\n  Ch’eng with Tenduc. Tou Ch’eng is two days’ march west of Kwei-hwa\r\n  Ch’eng, “On the loess hill behind this place are the ruins of\r\n  a large camp, Orch’eng, in all likelihood the site of the old\r\n  town” (_l.c._ 18). M. Bonin (_J. As._ XV. 1900, 589) shares Mr.\r\n  Rockhill’s opinion. From Kwei-hwa Ch’eng, M. Bonin went by the\r\n  valley of the Hei Shui River to the Hwang Ho; at the junction of\r\n  the two rivers stands the village of Ho-k’au (Ho-k’ou) south of the\r\n  small town To Ch’eng, surmounted by the ruins of the old square\r\n  Mongol stronghold of Tokto, the walls of which are still in a good\r\n  state of preservation.—(_La Géographie_, I. 1901, p. 116.)\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, it is but fair to state that Palladius (21)\r\n  says: “The name of Tenduc obviously corresponds to T’ien-te Kiun, a\r\n  military post, the position of which Chinese geographers identify\r\n  correctly with that of the modern Kuku-hoton (_Ta tsing y t’ung\r\n  chi_, ch. on the Tumots of Kuku-hoton). The T’ien-te Kiun post\r\n  existed under this name during the K’itan (Liao) and Kin Dynasties\r\n  up to Khubilai’s time (1267); when under the name of Fung-chow it\r\n  was left only a district town in the department of Ta-t’ung fu. The\r\n  Kin kept in T’ien-te Kiun a military chief, _Chao-t’ao-shi_, whose\r\n  duty it was to keep an eye on the neighbouring tribes, and to use,\r\n  if needed, military force against them. The T’ien-te Kiun district\r\n  was hardly greater in extent than the modern aïmak of Tumot, into\r\n  which Kuku-hoton was included since the 16th century, _i.e._ 370 _li_\r\n  from north to south, and 400 _li_ from east to west; during the Kin\r\n  it had a settled population, numbering 22,600 families.”\r\n\r\n  In a footnote, Palladius refers to the geographical parts of\r\n  the _Liao shi, Kin shi_, and _Yuen shi_, and adds: “M. Polo’s\r\n  commentators are wrong in suspecting an anachronism in his\r\n  statement, or trying to find Tenduc elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n  We find in the _North-China Herald_ (29th April, 1887, p. 474)\r\n  the following note from the _Chinese Times_: “There are records\r\n  that the position of this city [Kwei-hwa Ch’eng] was known to the\r\n  builder of the Great Wall. From very remote times, it appears to\r\n  have been a settlement of nomadic tribes. During the last 1000\r\n  years it has been alternately possessed by the Mongols and Chinese.\r\n  About A.D. 1573, Emperor Wan-Li reclaimed it, enclosed a space\r\n  within walls, and called it Kwei-hwa Ch’êng.”\r\n\r\n  Potanin left Peking on the 13th May, 1884, for Kuku-khoto (or\r\n  Kwei-hwa-Ch’eng), passing over the triple chain of mountains\r\n  dividing the Plain of Peking from that on which Kuku-khoto is\r\n  situate. The southernmost of these three ridges bears the Chinese\r\n  name of Wu-tai-shan, “the mountain of five sacrificial altars,”\r\n  after the group of five peaks, the highest of which is 10,000 feet\r\n  above the sea, a height not exceeded by any mountain in Northern\r\n  China. At its southern foot lies a valley remarkable for its\r\n  Buddhist monasteries and shrines, one of which, “Shing-tung-tze,”\r\n  is entirely made of brass, whence its name.\r\n\r\n  “Kuku-Khoto is the depôt for the Mongolian trade with China. It\r\n  contains two hundred tea-shops, five theatres, fifteen temples, and\r\n  six Mongol monasteries. Among its sights are the Buddhist convent\r\n  of Utassa, with its five pinnacles and bas-reliefs, the convent of\r\n  Fing-sung-si, and a temple containing a statue erected in honour of\r\n  the Chinese general, Pai-jin-jung, who avenged an insult offered\r\n  to the Emperor of China.” (_Proc. R. G. S._ IX. 1887, p. 233.)\r\n  —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  A passage in Rashiduddin does seem to intimate that the Kerait,\r\n  the tribe of Aung Khan, _alias_ Prester John, did occupy territory\r\n  close to the borders of Cathay or Northern China; but neither from\r\n  Chinese nor from other Oriental sources has any illustration yet\r\n  been produced of the existence of Aung Khan’s descendants as rulers\r\n  in this territory under the Mongol emperors. There is, however,\r\n  very positive evidence to that effect supplied by other European\r\n  travellers, to whom the fables prevalent in the West had made the\r\n  supposed traces of Prester John a subject of strong interest.\r\n\r\n  Thus John of Monte Corvino, afterwards Archbishop of Cambaluc or\r\n  Peking, in his letter of January, 1305, from that city, speaks of\r\n  Polo’s King George in these terms: “A certain king of this part of\r\n  the world, by name George, belonging to the sect of the Nestorian\r\n  Christians, and of the illustrious lineage of that great king who\r\n  was called Prester John of India, in the first year of my arrival\r\n  here [_circa_ 1295–1296] attached himself to me, and, after he had\r\n  been converted by me to the verity of the Catholic faith, took the\r\n  Lesser Orders, and when I celebrated mass used to attend me wearing\r\n  his royal robes. Certain others of the Nestorians on this account\r\n  accused him of apostacy, but he brought over a great part of his\r\n  people with him to the true Catholic faith, and built a church of\r\n  royal magnificence in honour of our God, of the Holy Trinity, and\r\n  of our Lord, the Pope, giving it the name of _the Roman Church_.\r\n  This King George, six years ago, departed to the Lord, a true\r\n  Christian, leaving as his heir a son scarcely out of the cradle,\r\n  and who is now nine years old. And after King George’s death,\r\n  his brothers, perfidious followers of the errors of Nestorius,\r\n  perverted again all those whom he had brought over to the Church,\r\n  and carried them back to their original schismatical creed. And\r\n  being all alone, and not able to leave His Majesty the Cham, I\r\n  could not go to visit the church above-mentioned, which is twenty\r\n  days’ journey distant.... I had been in treaty with the late King\r\n  George, if he had lived, to translate the whole Latin ritual, that\r\n  it might be sung throughout the extent of his territory; and whilst\r\n  he was alive I used to celebrate mass in his church according to\r\n  the Latin rite.” The distance mentioned, twenty days’ journey from\r\n  Peking, suits quite well with the position assigned to Tenduc, and\r\n  no doubt the Roman Church was in the city to which Polo gives that\r\n  name.\r\n\r\n  Friar Odoric, travelling from Peking towards Shensi, about\r\n  1326–1327, also visits the country of Prester John, and gives to\r\n  its chief city the name of _Tozan_, in which perhaps we may trace\r\n  _Tathung_. He speaks as if the family still existed in authority.\r\n\r\n  King George appears again in Marco’s own book (Bk. IV. ch. ii.) as\r\n  one of Kúblái’s generals against Kaidu, in a battle fought near\r\n  Karakorúm. (_Journ. As._ IX. 299 _seqq._; _D’Ohsson_, I. 123;\r\n  _Huc’s Tartary_, etc. I. 55 _seqq._; _Koeppen_, II. 381; _Erdmann’s\r\n  Temudschin_; _Gerbillon_ in _Astley_, IV. 670; _Cathay_, pp. 146\r\n  and 199 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Such a compact is related to have existed reciprocally\r\n  between the family of Chinghiz and that of the chief of the\r\n  Ḳunguráts; but I have not found it alleged of the Kerait family\r\n  except by Friar Odoric. We find, however, many _princesses_ of this\r\n  family married into that of Chinghiz. Thus three nieces of Aung\r\n  Khan became wives respectively of Chinghiz himself and of his sons\r\n  Juji and Tului; she who was the wife of the latter, Serḳuḳteni\r\n  Bigi, being the mother of Mangú, Hulaku, and Kúblái. Duḳuz Khatun,\r\n  the Christian wife of Hulaku, was a grand-daughter of Aung Khan.\r\n\r\n  The name _George_, of Prester John’s representative, may have been\r\n  actually Jirjis, Yurji, or some such Oriental form of Georgius. But\r\n  it is possible that the title was really _Gurgán_, “Son-in-Law,” a\r\n  title of honour conferred on those who married into the imperial\r\n  blood, and that this title may have led to the statements of Marco\r\n  and Odoric about the nuptial privileges of the family. Gurgán in\r\n  this sense was one of the titles borne by Timur.[1]\r\n\r\n  [The following note by the Archimandrite Palladius (_Eluc._ 21–23)\r\n  throws a great light on the relations between the families of\r\n  Chinghiz Khan and of Prester John.\r\n\r\n  “T’ien-te Kiun was bounded on the north by the _Yn-shan_ Mountains,\r\n  in and beyond which was settled the Sha-t’o Tu-K’iu tribe, _i.e._\r\n  Tu-K’iu of the sandy desert. The K’itans, when they conquered\r\n  the northern borders of China, brought also under their rule the\r\n  dispersed family of these Tu-K’iu. With the accession of the Kin,\r\n  a Wang Ku [Ongot] family made its appearance as the ruling family\r\n  of those tribes; it issued from those Sha-t’o Tu-K’iu, who once\r\n  reigned in the north of China as the How T’ang Dynasty (923–936\r\n  A.D.). It split into two branches, the Wang-Ku of the Yn-shan,\r\n  and the Wang-Ku of the Lin-t’ao (west of Kan-su). The Kin removed\r\n  the latter branch to Liao-tung (in Manchuria). The Yn-shan Wang-Ku\r\n  guarded the northern borders of China belonging to the Kin, and\r\n  watched their herds. When the Kin, as a protection against the\r\n  inroads of the tribes of the desert, erected a rampart, or new\r\n  wall, from the boundary of the Tángut Kingdom down to Manchuria,\r\n  they intrusted the defence of the principal places of the Yn-shan\r\n  portion of the wall to the Wang-Ku, and transferred there also\r\n  the Liao-tung Wang-Ku. At the time Chingiz Khan became powerful,\r\n  the chief of the Wang-Ku of the Yn-shan was Alahush; and at the\r\n  head of the Liao-tung Wang-Ku stood _Pa-sao-ma-ie-li_. Alahush\r\n  proved a traitor to the Kin, and passed over to Chinghiz Khan; for\r\n  this he was murdered by the malcontents of his family, perhaps by\r\n  Pa-sao-ma-ie-li, who remained true to the Kin. Later on, Chingiz\r\n  Khan married one of his daughters to the son of Alahush, by name\r\n  Po-yao-ho, who, however, had no children by her. He had three sons\r\n  by a concubine, the eldest of whom, Kiun-pu-hwa, was married to\r\n  Kuyuk Khan’s daughter. Kiun-pu-hwa’s son, Ko-li-ki-sze, had two\r\n  wives, both of imperial blood. During a campaign against Haidu, he\r\n  was made prisoner in 1298, and murdered. His title and dignities\r\n  passed over in A.D. 1310 to his son _Chuan_. Nothing is known of\r\n  Alahush’s later descendants; they probably became entirely Chinese,\r\n  like their relatives of the Liao-tung branch.\r\n\r\n  “The Wang-Ku princes were thus _de jure_ the sons-in-law of the\r\n  Mongol Khans, and they had, moreover, the hereditary title of\r\n  Kao-t’ang princes (Kao-t’ang wang); it is very possible that they\r\n  had their residence in ancient T’ien-te Kiun (although no mention\r\n  is made of it in history), just as at present the Tumot princes\r\n  reside in Kuku-hoton.\r\n\r\n  “The consonance of the names of Wang-Khan and Wang-Ku (Ung-Khan and\r\n  Ongu) led to the confusion regarding the tribes and persons, which\r\n  at Marco Polo’s time seems to have been general among the Europeans\r\n  in China; Marco Polo and Johannes de Monte Corvino transfer the\r\n  title of Prester John from Wang-Khan, already perished at that\r\n  time, to the distinguished family of Wang-Ku. Their Georgius is\r\n  undoubtedly Ko-li-ki-sze, Alahush’s great-grandson. That his name\r\n  is a Christian one is confirmed by other testimonies; thus in the\r\n  Asu (Azes) regiment of the Khan’s guards was Ko-li-ki-sze, _alias_\r\n  Kow-r-ki (†1311), and his son Ti-mi-ti-r. There is no doubt that\r\n  one of them was Georgius, and the other Demetrius. Further, in\r\n  the description of _Chin-Kiang_ in the time of the Yuen, mention\r\n  is made of Ko-li-ki-sze Ye-li-ko-wen, _i.e._ Ko-li-ki-sze, the\r\n  Christian, and of his son Lu-ho (Luke).\r\n\r\n  “Ko-li-ki-sze of Wang-ku is much praised in history for his valour\r\n  and his love for Confucian doctrine; he had in consequence of a\r\n  special favour of the Khan two Mongol princesses for wives at the\r\n  same time (which is rather difficult to conciliate with his being\r\n  a Christian). The time of his death is correctly indicated in a\r\n  letter of Joannes de M. Corvino of the year 1305: _ante sex annos\r\n  migravit ad Dominum_. He left a young son _Chu-an_, who probably\r\n  is the Joannes of the letter of Ioannes (Giovani) de M. Corvino,\r\n  so called _propter nomen meum_, says the missionary. In another\r\n  Wang-ku branch, Si-li-ki-sze reminds one also of the Christian name\r\n  _Sergius_.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—“The _Lapis Armenus_, or Azure, ... is produced in the\r\n  district of Tayton-fu (_i.e._ _Tathung_), belonging to Shansi.” (_Du\r\n  Halde_ in _Astley_, IV. 309; see also _Martini_, p. 36.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—This is a highly interesting passage, but difficult, from\r\n  being corrupt in the G. Text, and over-curt in Pauthier’s MSS. In\r\n  the former it runs as follows: “_Hil hi a une jenerasion de jens\r\n  que sunt appellés_ Argon, _qe vaut à dire en françois_ Guasmul,\r\n  _ce est à dire qu’il sunt né del deus generasions de la lengnée\r\n  des celz_ Argon Tenduc et des celz reduc et des celz que aorent\r\n  Maomet. _Il sunt biaus homes plus que le autre dou païs et plus\r\n  sajes et plus mercaant_.” Pauthier’s text runs thus: “_Il ont\r\n  une generation de gens, ces Crestiens qui ont la Seigneurie, qui\r\n  s’appellent_ Argon, _qui vaut a dire_ Gasmul; _et sont plus beaux\r\n  hommes que les autres mescreans et plus sages. Et pour ce ont il la\r\n  seigneurie et sont bons marchans._” And Ramusio: “_Vi è anche una\r\n  sorte di gente che si chiamano_ Argon, _per che sono nati di due\r\n  generazioni_, cioè da quella di Tenduc che adorano gl’idoli, e da\r\n  quella che osservano la legge di Macometto. _E questi sono i piu\r\n  belli uomini che si trovino in quel paese e più savi, e più accorti\r\n  nella mercanzia._”\r\n\r\n  In the first quotation the definition of the _Argon_ as sprung _de\r\n  la lengnée, etc._, is not intelligible as it stands, but seems to\r\n  be a corruption of the same definition that has been rendered by\r\n  Ramusio, viz. that the Argon were half-castes between the race of\r\n  the Tenduc Buddhists and that of the Mahomedan settlers. These two\r\n  texts do not assert that the Argon were Christians. Pauthier’s text\r\n  at first sight seems to assert this, and to identify them with the\r\n  Christian rulers of the province. But I doubt if it means more\r\n  than that the Christian rulers _have under them_ a people called\r\n  Argon, etc. The passage has been read with a bias, owing to an\r\n  erroneous interpretation of the word _Argon_ in the teeth of Polo’s\r\n  explanation of it.\r\n\r\n  Klaproth, I believe, first suggested that _Argon_ represents the\r\n  term _Arkhaiún_, which is found repeatedly applied to Oriental\r\n  Christians, or their clergy, in the histories of the Mongol era.[2]\r\n  No quite satisfactory explanation has been given of the origin of\r\n  that term. It is barely possible that it may be connected with that\r\n  which Polo uses here; but he tells us as plainly as possible that\r\n  he means by the term, not a Christian, but a _half-breed_.\r\n\r\n  And in this sense the word is still extant in Tibet, probably also\r\n  in Eastern Turkestan, precisely in Marco’s form, ARGON. It is\r\n  applied in Ladak, as General Cunningham tells us, specifically to\r\n  the mixt race produced by the marriages of Kashmirian immigrants\r\n  with Bōt (Tibetan) women. And it was apparently to an analogous\r\n  cross between Caucasians and Turanians that the term was applied\r\n  in Tenduc. Moorcroft also speaks of this class in Ladak, calling\r\n  them _Argands_. Mr. Shaw styles them “a set of ruffians called\r\n  _Argoons_, half-bred between Toorkistan fathers and Ladak\r\n  mothers.... They possess all the evil qualities of both races,\r\n  without any of their virtues.” And the author of the Dabistan,\r\n  speaking of the Tibetan Lamas, says: “Their king, if his mother be\r\n  not of royal blood, is by them called _Arghún_, and not considered\r\n  their true king.” [See p. 291, my reference to _Wellby’s Tibet_.\r\n  —H. C.] Cunningham says the word is probably Turki, ارغون, _Arghún_,\r\n  “Fair,” “not _white_,” as he writes to me, “but _ruddy_ or _pink_,\r\n  and therefore ‘fair.’ _Arghún_ is both Turki and Mogholi, and is\r\n  applied to all fair children, both male and female, as _Arghun\r\n  Beg, Arghuna Khatun_,” etc.[3] We find an _Arghún_ tribe named in\r\n  Timur’s Institutes, which probably derived its descent from such\r\n  half-breeds. And though the Arghún Dynasty of Kandahar and Sind\r\n  claimed their descent and name from Arghún Khan of Persia, this may\r\n  have had no other foundation.\r\n\r\n  There are some curious analogies between these Argons of whom\r\n  Marco speaks and those Mahomedans of Northern China and Chinese\r\n  Turkestan lately revolted against Chinese authority, who are called\r\n  _Tungăni_, or as the Russians write it _Dungen_, a word signifying,\r\n  according to Professor Vámbéry, in Turki, “a convert.”[4] These\r\n  Tungani are said by one account to trace their origin to a large\r\n  body of Uighúrs, who were transferred _to the vicinity of the Great\r\n  Wall_ during the rule of the Thang Dynasty (7th to 10th century).\r\n  Another tradition derives their origin from Samarkand. And it\r\n  is remarkable that Rashiduddin speaks of a town to the west or\r\n  north-west of Peking, “most of the inhabitants of which are natives\r\n  of Samarkand, and have planted a number of gardens in the Samarkand\r\n  style.”[5] The former tradition goes on to say that marriages were\r\n  encouraged between the Western settlers and the Chinese women.\r\n  In after days these people followed the example of their kindred\r\n  in becoming Mahomedans, but they still retained the practice of\r\n  marrying Chinese wives, though bringing up their children in Islam.\r\n  The Tungani are stated to be known in Central Asia for their\r\n  commercial integrity; and they were generally selected by the\r\n  Chinese for police functionaries. They are passionate and ready to\r\n  use the knife; but are distinguished from both Manchus and Chinese\r\n  by their strength of body and intelligent countenances. Their\r\n  special feature is their predilection for mercantile speculations.\r\n\r\n  Looking to the many common features of the two accounts—the origin\r\n  as a half-breed between Mahomedans of Western extraction and\r\n  Northern Chinese, the position in the vicinity of the Great Wall,\r\n  the superior physique, intelligence, and special capacity for\r\n  trade, it seems highly probable that the Tungani of our day are the\r\n  descendants of Marco’s Argons. Otherwise we may at least point to\r\n  these analogies as a notable instance of like results produced by\r\n  like circumstances on the same scene; in fact, of history repeating\r\n  itself. (See _The Dungens_, by _Mr. H. K. Heins_, in the _Russian\r\n  Military Journal_ for August, 1866, and _Western China_, in the\r\n  _Ed. Review_ for April, 1868;[6] _Cathay_, p. 261.)\r\n\r\n  [Palladius (pp. 23–24) says that “it is impossible to admit that\r\n  Polo had meant to designate by this name the Christians, who\r\n  were called by the Mongols _Erkeun_ [_Ye li ke un_]. He was well\r\n  acquainted with the Christians in China, and of course could not\r\n  ignore the name under which they were generally known to such a\r\n  degree as to see in it a designation of a cross-race of Mahommetans\r\n  and heathens.” From the _Yuen ch’ao pi shi_ and the _Yuen shi_,\r\n  Palladius gives some examples which refer to Mahommedans.\r\n\r\n  Professor Devéria (_Notes d’Épig._ 49) says that the word Ἄρχων\r\n  was used by the Mongol Government as a designation for the members\r\n  of the Christian clergy at large; the word is used between 1252\r\n  and 1315 to speak of _Christian_ priests by the historians of\r\n  the Yuen Dynasty; it is not used before nor is it to be found in\r\n  the Si-ngan-fu inscription (_l.c._ 82). Mr. E. H. Parker (_China\r\n  Review_, xxiv. p. 157) supplies a few omissions in Devéria’s paper;\r\n  we note among others: “Ninth moon of 1329. Buddhist services\r\n  ordered to be held by the Uighúr priests, and by the Christians\r\n  [_Ye li ke un_].”\r\n\r\n  Captain Wellby writes (_Unknown Tibet_, p. 32): “We impressed into\r\n  our service six other muleteers, four of them being Argoons, who\r\n  are really half-castes, arising from the merchants of Turkestan\r\n  making short marriages with the Ladakhi women.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Our author gives the odd word _Guasmul_ as the French equivalent\r\n  of Argon. M. Pauthier has first, of Polo’s editors, given the true\r\n  explanation from Ducange. The word appears to have been in use in\r\n  the Levant among the Franks as a name for the half-breeds sprung\r\n  from their own unions with Greek women. It occurs three times in\r\n  the history of George Pachymeres. Thus he says (_Mich. Pal._ III.\r\n  9), that the Emperor Michael “depended upon the _Gasmuls_, or mixt\r\n  breeds (συμμíκτοι), which is the sense of this word of the Italian\r\n  tongue, for these were born of Greeks and Italians, and sent them\r\n  to man his ships; for the race in question inherited at once the\r\n  military wariness and quick wit of the Greeks, and the dash and\r\n  pertinacity of the Latins.” Again (IV. 26) he speaks of these\r\n  “Gasmuls, whom a Greek would call διγενεῖς, men sprung from Greek\r\n  mothers and Italian fathers.” Nicephorus Gregoras also relates how\r\n  Michael Palaeologus, to oppose the projects of Baldwin for the\r\n  recovery of his fortunes, manned 60 galleys, chiefly with the tribe\r\n  of Gasmuls (γένος τοῦ Γασμουλικοῦ), to whom he assigns the same\r\n  characteristics as Pachymeres. (IV. v. 5, also VI. iii. 3, and XIV.\r\n  x. 11.) One MS. of Nicetas Choniates also, in his annals of Manuel\r\n  Comnenus (see Paris ed. p. 425), speaks of “the light troops whom\r\n  we call _Basmuls_.” Thus it would seem that, as in the analogous\r\n  case of the _Turcopuli_, sprung from Turk fathers and Greek\r\n  mothers, their name had come to be applied technically to a class\r\n  of troops. According to Buchon, the laws of the Venetians in Candia\r\n  mention, as different races in that island, the _Vasmulo_, Latino,\r\n  Blaco, and Griego.\r\n\r\n  Ducange, in one of his notes on Joinville, says: “During the time\r\n  that the French possessed Constantinople, they gave the name of\r\n  _Gas-moules_ to those who were born of French fathers and Greek\r\n  mothers; or more probably _Gaste-moules_, by way of derision, as\r\n  if such children by those irregular marriages ... had in some sort\r\n  debased the wombs of their mothers!” I have little doubt (_pace\r\n  tanti viri_) that the word is in a Gallicized form the same with\r\n  the surviving Italian _Guazzabúglio_, a hotch-potch, or mish-mash.\r\n  In Davanzati’s _Tacitus_, the words “Colluviem _illam nationum_”\r\n  (_Annal._ II. 55) are rendered “_quello_ guazzabuglio _di\r\n  nazioni_,” in which case we come very close to the meaning assigned\r\n  to _Guasmul_. The Italians are somewhat behind in matters of\r\n  etymology, and I can get no light from them on the history of this\r\n  word. (See _Buchon_, _Chroniques Etrangères_, p. xv.; _Ducange_,\r\n  _Gloss. Graecitatis_, and his note on _Joinville_, in _Bohn’s\r\n  Chron. of the Crusades_, 466.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—It has often been cast in Marco’s teeth that he makes\r\n  no mention of the Great Wall of China, and that is true; whilst\r\n  the apologies made for the omission have always seemed to me\r\n  unsatisfactory. [I find in Sir G. Staunton’s account of Macartney’s\r\n  Embassy (II. p. 185) this most amusing explanation of the reason\r\n  why Marco Polo did not mention the wall: “A copy of Marco Polo’s\r\n  route to China, taken from the Doge’s Library at Venice, is\r\n  sufficient to decide this question. By this route it appears that,\r\n  in fact, that traveller did not pass through Tartary to Pekin, but\r\n  that after having followed the usual track of the caravans, as far\r\n  to the eastward from Europe as Samarcand and Cashgar, he bent his\r\n  course to the south-east across the River Ganges to Bengal (!),\r\n  and, keeping to the southward of the Thibet mountains, reached the\r\n  Chinese province of Shensee, and through the adjoining province\r\n  of Shansee to the capital, without interfering with the line of\r\n  the Great Wall.”—H. C.] We shall see presently that the Great Wall\r\n  is spoken of by Marco’s contemporaries Rashiduddin and Abulfeda.\r\n  Yet I think, if we read “between the lines,” we shall see reason\r\n  to believe that the Wall _was_ in Polo’s mind at this point of\r\n  the dictation, whatever may have been his motive for withholding\r\n  distincter notice of it.[7] I cannot conceive why he should say:\r\n  “Here is what we call the country of Gog and Magog,” except as\r\n  intimating “Here we are _beside the_ GREAT WALL known as the\r\n  Rampart of Gog and Magog,” and being there he tries to find a\r\n  reason why those names should have been applied to it. Why they\r\n  were really applied to it we have already seen. (_Supra_, ch. iv.\r\n  note 3.) Abulfeda says: “The Ocean turns northward along the east\r\n  of China, and then expands in the same direction till it passes\r\n  China, and comes opposite to the Rampart of Yájúj and Májúj;”\r\n  whilst the same geographer’s definition of the boundaries of China\r\n  exhibits that country as bounded on the west by the Indo-Chinese\r\n  wildernesses; on the south, by the seas; on the east, by the\r\n  Eastern Ocean; on the north, by the _land of Yájúj and Májúj_, and\r\n  other countries unknown. Ibn Batuta, with less accurate geography\r\n  in his head than Abulfeda, maugre his travels, asks about the\r\n  Rampart of Gog and Magog (_Sadd Yájúj wa Májúj_) when he is at\r\n  Sin Kalán, _i.e._ Canton, and, as might be expected, gets little\r\n  satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Rampart of Gog and Magog.]\r\n\r\n  Apart from this interesting point Marsden seems to be right in the\r\n  general bearing of his explanation of the passage, and I conceive\r\n  that the two classes of people whom Marco tries to identify with\r\n  Gog and Magog do substantially represent the two genera or species,\r\n  TURKS and MONGOLS, or, according to another nomenclature used by\r\n  Rashiduddin, the _White_ and _Black_ Tartars. To the latter class\r\n  belonged Chinghiz and his MONGOLS proper, with a number of other\r\n  tribes detailed by Rashiduddin, and these I take to be in a general\r\n  way the MUNGUL of our text. The _Ung_, on the other hand, are the\r\n  UNG-_ḳut_, the latter form being presumably only the Mongol plural\r\n  of UNG. The Ung-ḳut were a Turk tribe who were vassals of the Kin\r\n  Emperors of Cathay, and were intrusted with the defence of the Wall\r\n  of China, or an important portion of it, which was called by the\r\n  Mongols _Ungu_, a name which some connect with that of the tribe.\r\n  [See note pp. 288–9.] Erdmann indeed asserts that the wall by which\r\n  the Ung-ḳut dwelt was not the Great Wall, but some other. There are\r\n  traces of other great ramparts in the steppes north of the present\r\n  wall. But Erdmann’s arguments seem to me weak in the extreme.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 112) writes: “The earliest mention I\r\n  have found of the name _Mongol_ in Oriental works occurs in the\r\n  Chinese annals of the After T’ang period (A.D. 923–934), where it\r\n  occurs in the form _Meng-ku_. In the annals of the Liao Dynasty\r\n  (A.D. 916–1125) it is found under the form _Meng-ku-li_. The first\r\n  occurrence of the name in the _Tung chien kang mu_ is, however, in\r\n  the 6th year Shao-hsing of Kao-tsung of the Sung (A.D. 1136). It\r\n  is just possible that we may trace the word back a little earlier\r\n  than the After T’ang period, and that the _Meng-wa_ (or _ngo_, as\r\n  this character may have been pronounced at the time), a branch of\r\n  the Shih-wei, a Tungusic or Kitan people living around Lake Keule,\r\n  to the east of the Baikal, and along the Kerulun, which empties\r\n  into it, during the 7th and subsequent centuries, and referred to\r\n  in the _T’ang shu_ (Bk. 219), is the same as the later Meng-ku.\r\n  Though I have been unable to find, as stated by Howorth (_History_,\r\n  i. pt. I. 28), that the name _Meng-ku_ occurs in the T’ang shu,\r\n  his conclusion that the northern Shih-wei of that time constituted\r\n  the Mongol nation proper is very likely correct.... I. J. Schmidt\r\n  (_Sanang Setzen_, 380) derives the name _Mongol_ from _mong_,\r\n  meaning ‘brave, daring, bold,’ while Rashid-eddin says it means\r\n  ‘simple, weak’ (_d’Ohsson_, i. 22). The Chinese characters used to\r\n  transcribe the name mean ‘dull, stupid,’ and ‘old, ancient,’ but\r\n  they are used purely phonetically.... The Mongols of the present\r\n  day are commonly called by the Chinese _Ta-tzŭ_, but this name\r\n  is resented by the Mongols as opprobrious, though it is but an\r\n  abbreviated form of the name _Ta-ta-tzŭ_, in which, according to\r\n  Rubruck, they once gloried.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Vincent of Beauvais has got from some of his authorities a\r\n  conception of the distinction of the Tartars into two races, to\r\n  which, however, he assigns no names: “_Sunt autem duo genera\r\n  Tartarorum, diversa quidem habentia idiomata, sed unicam legem\r\n  ac ritum, sicut Franci et Theutonici_.” But the result of _his_\r\n  effort to find a realisation of Gog and Magog is that he makes\r\n  _Guyuk Kaan_ into Gog, and _Mangu Kaan_ into Magog. Even the\r\n  intelligent Friar Ricold says of the Tartars: “They say themselves\r\n  that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account\r\n  they are called _Mogoli_, as if from a corruption of _Magogoli_.”\r\n  (_Abulfeda_ in _Büsching_, IV. 140, 274–275; _I. B._ IV. 274;\r\n  _Golden Horde_, 34, 68; _Erdmann_, 241–242, 257–258; _Timk._ I.\r\n  259, 263, 268; _Vinc. Bellov. Spec. Hist._ XXIX. 73, XXXI. 32–34;\r\n  _Pereg. Quat._ 118; _Not. et Ext._ II. 536.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—The towns and villages were probably those immediately\r\n  north of the Great Wall, between 112° and 115° East longitude,\r\n  of which many remains exist, ascribed to the time of the Yuen or\r\n  Mongol Dynasty. This tract, between the Great Wall and the volcanic\r\n  plateau of Mongolia, is extensively colonised by Chinese, and has\r\n  resumed the flourishing aspect that Polo describes. It is known now\r\n  as the _Ku-wei_, or extramural region.\r\n\r\n  [After Kalgan, Captain Younghusband, on the 12th April, 1886,\r\n  “passed through the [outer] Great Wall ... entering what Marco Polo\r\n  calls the land of Gog and Magog. For the next two days I passed\r\n  through a hilly country inhabited by Chinese, though it really\r\n  belongs to Mongolia; but on the 14th I emerged on to the real\r\n  steppes, which are the characteristic features of Mongolia Proper.”\r\n  (_Proc. R. G. S._ X., 1888, p. 490.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Of the cloths called _nakh_ and _nasij_ we have spoken before\r\n  (_supra_ ch. vi. note 4). These stuffs, or some such as these, were,\r\n  I believe, what the mediæval writers called _Tartary cloth_, not\r\n  because they were made in Tartary, but because they were brought\r\n  from China and its borders through the Tartar dominions; as we\r\n  find that for like reason they were sometimes called stuffs of\r\n  _Russia_. Dante alludes to the supposed skill of Turks and Tartars\r\n  in weaving gorgeous stuffs, and Boccaccio, commenting thereon, says\r\n  that Tartarian cloths are so skilfully woven that no painter with\r\n  his brush could equal them. Maundevile often speaks of cloths of\r\n  Tartary (_e.g._ pp. 175, 247). So also Chaucer:\r\n\r\n      “On every trumpe hanging a broad banere\r\n       Of fine _Tartarium_.”\r\n\r\n  Again, in the French inventory of the _Garde-Meuble_ of 1353 we\r\n  find two pieces of _Tartary_, one green and the other red, priced\r\n  at 15 crowns each. (_Flower and Leaf_, 211; _Dante, Inf._ XVII.\r\n  17, and _Longfellow_, p. 159; _Douet d’Arcq_, p. 328; _Fr.-Michel,\r\n  Rech._ I. 315, II. 166 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—SINDACHU (Sindacui, Suidatui, etc., of the MSS.) is\r\n  SIUEN-HWA-FU, called under the Kin Dynasty _Siuen-te-chau_, more\r\n  than once besieged and taken by Chinghiz. It is said to have been a\r\n  summer residence of the later Mongol Emperors, and fine parks full\r\n  of grand trees remain on the western side. It is still a large town\r\n  and the capital of a _Fu_, about 25 miles south of the Gate on the\r\n  Great Wall at Chang Kia Kau, which the Mongols and Russians call\r\n  Kalgan. There is still a manufacture of felt and woollen articles\r\n  here.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill writes to me that this place is noted for the\r\n  manufacture of buckskins.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  _Ydifu_ has not been identified. But Baron Richthofen saw old mines\r\n  north-east of Kalgan, which used to yield argentiferous galena; and\r\n  Pumpelly heard of silver-mines near Yuchau, in the same department.\r\n\r\n  [In the _Yuen-shi_ it is “stated that there were gold and silver\r\n  mines in the districts of Siuen-te-chow and Yuchow, as well as\r\n  in the Kiming shan Mountains. These mines were worked by the\r\n  Government itself up to 1323, when they were transferred to private\r\n  enterprise. Marco Polo’s _Ydifu_ is probably a copyist’s error, and\r\n  stands instead of Yuchow.” (_Palladius_, 24, 25.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Mr. Ney Elias favours me with a curious but tantalising\r\n    communication on this subject: “An old man called on me at Kwei-hwa\r\n    Ch’eng (Tenduc), who said he was neither Chinaman, Mongol, nor\r\n    Mahomedan, and lived on ground a short distance to the north of\r\n    the city, especially allotted to his ancestors by the Emperor, and\r\n    where there now exist several families of the same origin. He then\r\n    mentioned the connection of his family with that of the Emperor,\r\n    but in what way I am not clear, and said that he ought to be, or\r\n    had been, a prince. Other people coming in, he was interrupted and\r\n    went away.... He was not with me more than ten minutes, and the\r\n    incident is a specimen of the difficulty in obtaining interesting\r\n    information, except by mere chance.... The idea that struck me\r\n    was, that he was perhaps a descendant of King George of Tenduc;\r\n    for I had your M. P. before me, and had been inquiring as much as\r\n    I dared about subjects it suggested.... At Kwei-hwa Ch’eng I was\r\n    very closely spied, and my servant was frequently told to warn me\r\n    against asking too many questions.”\r\n\r\n    I should mention that Oppert, in his very interesting monograph,\r\n    _Der Presbyter Johannes_, refuses to recognise the Kerait chief at\r\n    all in that character, and supposes Polo’s King George to be the\r\n    representative of a prince of the Liao (_supra_, p. 205), who, as\r\n    we learn from De Mailla’s History, after the defeat of the Kin, in\r\n    which he had assisted Chinghiz, settled in Liaotung, and received\r\n    from the conqueror the title of King of the Liao. This seems to me\r\n    geographically and otherwise quite inadmissible.\r\n\r\n[2] The term _Arkaiun_, or _Arkaun_, in this sense, occurs in the\r\n    Armenian History of Stephen Orpelian, quoted by St. Martin. The\r\n    author of the _Tárikh Jahán Kushai_, cited by D’Ohsson, says\r\n    that Christians were called by the Mongols _Arkáún_. When Hulaku\r\n    invested Baghdad we are told that he sent a letter to the Judges,\r\n    Shaikhs, Doctors and _Arkauns_, promising to spare such as should\r\n    act peaceably. And in the subsequent sack we hear that no houses\r\n    were spared except those of a few _Arkauns_ and foreigners. In\r\n    Rashiduddin’s account of the Council of State at Peking, we are\r\n    told that the four _Fanchan_, or Ministers of the Second Class,\r\n    were taken from the four nations of Tájiks, Cathayans, Uighúrs, and\r\n    _Arkaun_. Sabadin _Arkaun_ was the name of one of the Envoys sent\r\n    by Arghun Khan of Persia to the Pope in 1288. Traces of the name\r\n    appear also in Chinese documents of the Mongol era, as denoting\r\n    _some_ religious body. Some of these have been quoted by Mr. Wylie;\r\n    but I have seen no notice taken of a very curious extract given\r\n    by Visdelou. This states that Kúblái in 1289 established a Board\r\n    of nineteen chief officers to have surveillance of the affairs of\r\n    the Religion of the Cross, of the _Marha_, the _Siliepan_, and\r\n    the _Yelikhawen_. This Board was raised to a higher rank in 1315:\r\n    and at that time 72 minor courts presiding over the religion of\r\n    the _Yelikhawen_ existed under its supervision. Here we evidently\r\n    have the word _Arkhaiun_ in a Chinese form; and we may hazard\r\n    the suggestion that _Marha_, _Siliepan_ and _Yelikhawen_ meant\r\n    respectively the Armenian, Syrian, or Jacobite, and Nestorian\r\n    Churches. (_St. Martin, Mém._ II. 133, 143, 279; _D’Ohsson_, II.\r\n    264; _Ilchan_, I. 150, 152; _Cathay_, 264; _Acad._ VII. 359; Wylie\r\n    in _J. As._ V. xix. 406. Suppt. to _D’Herbelot_, 142.)\r\n\r\n[3] The word is not in Zenker or Pavet de Courteille.\r\n\r\n[4] Mr. Shaw writes _Toongânee_. The first mention of this name that\r\n    I know of is in Izzat Ullah’s Journal. (Vide _J. R. A. S._ VII.\r\n    310.) The people are there said to have got the name from having\r\n    first settled in _Tungan_. Tung-gan is in the same page the name\r\n    given to the strong city of T’ung Kwan on the Hwang-ho. (See Bk.\r\n    II. ch. xli. note 1.) A variety of etymologies have been given, but\r\n    Vámbéry’s seems the most probable.\r\n\r\n[5] Probably no man could now say what this means. But the following\r\n    note from Mr. Ney Elias is very interesting in its suggestion of\r\n    analogy: “In my report to the Geographical Society I have noticed\r\n    the peculiar Western appearance of Kwei-hwa-ch’eng, and the little\r\n    gardens of creepers and flowers in pots which are displayed round\r\n    the porches in the court-yards of the better class of houses, and\r\n    which I have seen in no other part of China. My attention was\r\n    especially drawn to these by your quotation from Rashiduddin.”\r\n\r\n[6] A translation of _Heins’_ was kindly lent me by the author of this\r\n    article, the lamented Mr. J. W. S. Wyllie.\r\n\r\n[7] I owe the suggestion of this to a remark in _Oppert’s Presbyter\r\n    Johannes_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\n              CONCERNING THE KAAN’S PALACE OF CHAGANNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of those three days you find a city called CHAGAN NOR [which\r\nis as much as to say White Pool], at which there is a great Palace\r\nof the Grand Kaan’s;{1} and he likes much to reside there on account\r\nof the Lakes and Rivers in the neighbourhood, which are the haunt of\r\nswans{2} and of a great variety of other birds. The adjoining plains\r\ntoo abound with cranes, partridges, pheasants, and other game birds, so\r\nthat the Emperor takes all the more delight in staying there, in order\r\nto go a-hawking with his gerfalcons and other falcons, a sport of which\r\nhe is very fond.{3}\r\n\r\nThere are five different kinds of cranes found in those tracts, as I\r\nshall tell you. First, there is one which is very big, and all over\r\nas black as a crow; the second kind again is all white, and is the\r\nbiggest of all; its wings are really beautiful, for they are adorned\r\nwith round eyes like those of a peacock, but of a resplendent golden\r\ncolour, whilst the head is red and black on a white ground. The third\r\nkind is the same as ours. The fourth is a small kind, having at the\r\nears beautiful long pendent feathers of red and black. The fifth kind\r\nis grey all over and of great size, with a handsome head, red and\r\nblack.{4}\r\n\r\nNear this city there is a valley in which the Emperor has had several\r\nlittle houses erected in which he keeps in mew a huge number of\r\n_cators_, which are what we call the Great Partridge. You would be\r\nastonished to see what a quantity there are, with men to take charge\r\nof them. So whenever the Kaan visits the place he is furnished with as\r\nmany as he wants.{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[According to the _Siu t’ung kien_, quoted by Palladius,\r\n  the palace in Chagannor was built in 1280.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Ou demeurent_ sesnes.” _Sesnes, Cesnes, Cecini, Cesanae_,\r\n  is a mediæval form of _cygnes, cigni_, which seems to have escaped\r\n  the dictionary-makers. It occurs in the old Italian version of\r\n  _Brunetto Latini’s Tresor_, Bk. V. ch. xxv., as _cecino_; and for\r\n  other examples, see _Cathay_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The city called by Polo CHAGAN-NOR (meaning in Mongol, as\r\n  he says, “White Lake”) is the _Chaghan Balghasun_ mentioned by\r\n  Timkowski as an old city of the Mongol era, the ruined rampart of\r\n  which he passed about 30 miles north of the Great Wall at Kalgan,\r\n  and some 55 miles from Siuen-hwa, adjoining the Imperial pastures.\r\n  It stands near a lake still called Chaghan-Nor, and is called by\r\n  the Chinese Pe-ching-tzu, or White City, a translation of Chaghan\r\n  Balghasun. Dr. Bushell says of one of the lakes (Ichi-Nor), a few\r\n  miles east of Chaghan-Nor: “We ... found the water black with\r\n  waterfowl, which rose in dense flocks, and filled the air with\r\n  discordant noises. _Swans_, geese, and ducks predominated, and\r\n  _three different species of cranes_ were distinguished.”\r\n\r\n  The town appears as _Tchahan Toloho_ in D’Anville. It is also,\r\n  I imagine, the _Arulun Tsaghan Balghasun_ which S. Setzen says\r\n  Kúblái built about the same time with Shangtu and another city “on\r\n  the shady side of the Altai,” by which here he seems to mean the\r\n  Khingan range adjoining the Great Wall. (_Timk._ II. 374, 378–379;\r\n  _J. R. G. S._ vol. xliii.; _S. Setz._ 115.) I see Ritter has made\r\n  the same identification of Chaghan-Nor (II. 141).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The following are the best results I can arrive at in the\r\n  identification of these five cranes.\r\n\r\n  1. Radde mentions as a rare crane in South Siberia _Grus monachus_,\r\n  called by the Buraits _Kará Togorü_, or “Black Crane.” Atkinson\r\n  also speaks of “a beautiful black variety of crane,” probably the\r\n  same. The _Grus monachus_ is not, however, jet black, but brownish\r\n  rather. (_Radde, Reisen_, Bd. II. p. 318; _Atkinson. Or. and W.\r\n  Sib._ 548.)\r\n\r\n  2. _Grus leucogeranus_ (?) whose chief habitat is Siberia, but\r\n  which sometimes comes as far south as the Punjab. It is the largest\r\n  of the genus, snowy white, with red face and beak; the ten largest\r\n  quills are black, but this barely shows as a narrow black line when\r\n  the wings are closed. The resplendent golden eyes on the wings\r\n  remain unaccounted for; no naturalist whom I have consulted has any\r\n  knowledge of a crane or crane-like bird with such decorations. When\r\n  ’tis discovered, let it be the _Grus Poli_!\r\n\r\n  3. _Grus cinerea_.\r\n\r\n  4. The colour of the pendants varies in the texts. Pauthier’s and\r\n  the G. Text have _red and black_; the Lat. S. G. _black_ only, the\r\n  Crusca _black and white_, Ramusio _feathers red and blue_ (not\r\n  pendants). The _red and black_ may have slipt in from the preceding\r\n  description. I incline to believe it to be the Demoiselle,\r\n  _Anthropoides Virgo_, which is frequently seen as far north as Lake\r\n  Baikal. It has a tuft of pure _white_ from the eye, and a beautiful\r\n  black pendent ruff or collar; the general plumage purplish-grey.\r\n\r\n  5. Certainly the Indian _Sáras_ (vulgo Cyrus), or _Grus antigone_,\r\n  which answers in colours and grows to 52 inches high.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—_Cator_ occurs only in the G. Text and the Crusca, in\r\n  the latter with the interpolated explanation “_cioè contornici_”\r\n  (_i.e._ quails), whilst the S. G. Latin has _coturnices_ only. I\r\n  suspect this impression has assisted to corrupt the text, and\r\n  that it was originally written or dictated _ciacor_ or _çacor_,\r\n  viz. _chakór_, a term applied in the East to more than one kind\r\n  of “Great Partridge.” Its most common application in India is\r\n  to the Himalayan red-legged partridge, much resembling on a\r\n  somewhat larger scale the bird so called in Europe. It is the\r\n  “Francolin” of Moorcroft’s Travels, and the _Caccabis Chukor_\r\n  of Gray. According to Cunningham the name is applied in Ladak to\r\n  the bird sometimes called the Snow-pheasant, Jerdan’s Snow-cock,\r\n  _Tetraogallus himalayensis_ of Gray. And it must be the latter\r\n  which Moorcroft speaks of as “the gigantic Chukor, much larger than\r\n  the common partridge, found in large coveys on the edge of the\r\n  snow; ... one plucked and drawn weighed 5 lbs.”; described by Vigne\r\n  as “a partridge as large as a hen-turkey”; the original perhaps\r\n  of that partridge “larger than a vulture” which formed one of the\r\n  presents from an Indian King to Augustus Caesar. [With reference\r\n  to the large Tibetan partridge found in the Nan-shan Mountains\r\n  in the meridian of Sha-chau by Prjevalsky, M. E. D. Morgan in a\r\n  note (_P. R. Geog. S._ ix. 1887, p. 219), writes: “_Megaloperdrix\r\n  thibetanus_. Its general name in Asia is _ullar_, a word of Kirghiz\r\n  or Turkish origin; the Mongols call it _hailik_, and the Tibetans\r\n  _kung-mo_. There are two other varieties of this bird found in the\r\n  Himalaya and Altai Mountains, but the habits of life and call-note\r\n  of all three are the same.”] From the extensive diffusion of the\r\n  term, which seems to be common to India, Tibet, and Persia (for\r\n  the latter, see _Abbott_ in _J. R. G. S._ XXV. 41), it is likely\r\n  enough to be of Mongol origin, not improbably _Tsokhor_, “dappled\r\n  or pied.” (_Kovalevsky_, No. 2196, and _Strahlenberg’s_ Vocabulary;\r\n  see also _Ladak_, 205; _Moorcr._ I. 313, 432; _Jerdan’s Birds of\r\n  India_, III. 549, 572; _Dunlop, Hunting in Himalaya_, 178; _J. A.\r\n  S. B._ VI. 774.)\r\n\r\n  The chakór is mentioned by Baber (p. 282); and also by the Hindi\r\n  poet Chand (_Rás Mála_, I. 230, and _Ind. Antiquary_, I. 273).\r\n  If the latter passage is genuine, it is adverse to my Mongol\r\n  etymology, as Chand lived before the Mongol era.\r\n\r\n  The keeping of partridges for the table is alluded to by Chaucer in\r\n  his portrait of the Franklin, _Prologue, Cant. Tales_:\r\n\r\n      “It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,\r\n       Of alle deyntees that men coud of thinke,\r\n       After the sondry sesons of the yere,\r\n       So changed he his mete and his soupere.\r\n       _Full many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe_,\r\n       And many a breme and many a luce in stewe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n          OF THE CITY OF CHANDU, AND THE KAAN’S PALACE THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when you have ridden three days from the city last mentioned,\r\nbetween north-east and north, you come to a city called CHANDU,{1}\r\nwhich was built by the Kaan now reigning. There is at this place a very\r\nfine marble Palace, the rooms of which are all gilt and painted with\r\nfigures of men and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and\r\nflowers, all executed with such exquisite art that you regard them with\r\ndelight and astonishment.{2}\r\n\r\nRound this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of 16 miles,\r\nand inside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and\r\nbeautiful meadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as\r\nare of ferocious nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed\r\nthere to supply food for his gerfalcons and hawks, which he keeps there\r\nin mew. Of these there are more than 200 gerfalcons alone, without\r\nreckoning the other hawks. The Kaan himself goes every week to see his\r\nbirds sitting in mew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a\r\nleopard behind him on his horse’s croup; and then if he sees any animal\r\nthat takes his fancy, he slips his leopard at it,{3} and the game when\r\ntaken is made over to feed the hawks in mew. This he does for diversion.\r\n\r\nMoreover [at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood] he has\r\nanother Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description.\r\nIt is gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. [It is\r\nstayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all\r\ngilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head\r\nsupports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right\r\nand left to support the architrave.] The roof, like the rest, is formed\r\nof canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount\r\nof rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and\r\nfrom 10 to 15 paces in length. [They are cut across at each knot, and\r\nthen the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and\r\nwith these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be\r\nnailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it.] In short, the whole\r\nPalace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a\r\ngreat variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace\r\nis so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great\r\ncelerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever\r\nthe Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced [against mishaps\r\nfrom the wind] by more than 200 cords of silk.{4}\r\n\r\nThe Lord abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble\r\nPalace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year,\r\nto wit, June, July, and August; preferring this residence because it\r\nis by no means hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day\r\nof [the Moon of] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane\r\nPalace is taken to pieces.{5} But I must tell you what happens when he\r\ngoes away from this Palace every year on the 28th of the August [Moon].\r\n\r\nYou must know that the Kaan keeps an immense stud of white horses and\r\nmares; in fact more than 10,000 of them, and all pure white without a\r\nspeck. The milk of these mares is drunk by himself and his family, and\r\nby none else, except by those of one great tribe that have also the\r\nprivilege of drinking it. This privilege was granted them by Chinghis\r\nKaan, on account of a certain victory that they helped him to win long\r\nago. The name of the tribe is HORIAD.{6}\r\n\r\nNow when these mares are passing across the country, and any one falls\r\nin with them, be he the greatest lord in the land, he must not presume\r\nto pass until the mares have gone by; he must either tarry where he is,\r\nor go a half-day’s journey round if need so be, so as not to come nigh\r\nthem; for they are to be treated with the greatest respect. Well, when\r\nthe Lord sets out from the Park on the 28th of August, as I told you,\r\nthe milk of all those mares is taken and sprinkled on the ground. And\r\nthis is done on the injunction of the Idolaters and Idol-priests, who\r\nsay that it is an excellent thing to sprinkle that milk on the ground\r\nevery 28th of August, so that the Earth and the Air and the False Gods\r\nshall have their share of it, and the Spirits likewise that inhabit\r\nthe Air and the Earth. And thus those beings will protect and bless\r\nthe Kaan and his children and his wives and his folk and his gear, and\r\nhis cattle and his horses, his corn and all that is his. After this is\r\ndone, the Emperor is off and away.{7}\r\n\r\nBut I must now tell you a strange thing that hitherto I have forgotten\r\nto mention. During the three months of every year that the Lord resides\r\nat that place, if it should happen to be bad weather, there are certain\r\ncrafty enchanters and astrologers in his train, who are such adepts in\r\nnecromancy and the diabolic arts, that they are able to prevent any\r\ncloud or storm from passing over the spot on which the Emperor’s Palace\r\nstands. The sorcerers who do this are called TEBET and KESIMUR, which\r\nare the names of two nations of Idolaters. Whatever they do in this way\r\nis by the help of the Devil, but they make those people believe that\r\nit is compassed by dint of their own sanctity and the help of God.{8}\r\n[They always go in a state of dirt and uncleanness, devoid of respect\r\nfor themselves, or for those who see them, unwashed, unkempt, and\r\nsordidly attired.]\r\n\r\nThese people also have a custom which I must tell you. If a man is\r\ncondemned to death and executed by the lawful authority, they take his\r\nbody and cook and eat it. But if any one die a natural death then they\r\nwill not eat the body.{9}\r\n\r\nThere is another marvel performed by those BACSI, of whom I have been\r\nspeaking as knowing so many enchantments.{10} For when the Great Kaan\r\nis at his capital and in his great Palace, seated at his table, which\r\nstands on a platform some eight cubits above the ground, his cups are\r\nset before him [on a great buffet] in the middle of the hall pavement,\r\nat a distance of some ten paces from his table, and filled with wine,\r\nor other good spiced liquor such as they use. Now when the Lord desires\r\nto drink, these enchanters by the power of their enchantments cause the\r\ncups to move from their place without being touched by anybody, and to\r\npresent themselves to the Emperor! This every one present may witness,\r\nand there are ofttimes more than 10,000 persons thus present. ’Tis a\r\ntruth and no lie! and so will tell you the sages of our own country who\r\nunderstand necromancy, for they also can perform it.{11}\r\n\r\nAnd when the Idol Festivals come round, these _Bacsi_ go to the Prince\r\nand say: “Sire, the Feast of such a god is come” (naming him). “My\r\nLord, you know,” the enchanter will say, “that this god, when he gets\r\nno offerings, always sends bad weather and spoils our seasons. So we\r\npray you to give us such and such a number of black-faced sheep,”\r\nnaming whatever number they please. “And we beg also, good my lord,\r\nthat we may have such a quantity of incense, and such a quantity of\r\nlignaloes, and”—so much of this, so much of that, and so much of\r\nt’other, according to their fancy—“that we may perform a solemn service\r\nand a great sacrifice to our Idols, and that so they may be induced to\r\nprotect us and all that is ours.”\r\n\r\nThe _Bacsi_ say these things to the Barons entrusted with the\r\nStewardship, who stand round the Great Kaan, and these repeat them to\r\nthe Kaan, and he then orders the Barons to give everything that the\r\nBacsi have asked for. And when they have got the articles they go and\r\nmake a great feast in honour of their god, and hold great ceremonies of\r\nworship with grand illuminations and quantities of incense of a variety\r\nof odours, which they make up from different aromatic spices. And then\r\nthey cook the meat, and set it before the idols, and sprinkle the\r\nbroth hither and thither, saying that in this way the idols get their\r\nbellyful. Thus it is that they keep their festivals. You must know that\r\neach of the idols has a name of his own, and a feast-day, just as our\r\nSaints have their anniversaries.{12}\r\n\r\nThey have also immense Minsters and Abbeys, some of them as big as\r\na small town, with more than two thousand monks (_i.e._ after their\r\nfashion) in a single abbey.{13} These monks dress more decently than\r\nthe rest of the people, and have the head and beard shaven. There are\r\nsome among these _Bacsi_ who are allowed by their rule to take wives,\r\nand who have plenty of children.{14}\r\n\r\nThen there is another kind of devotees called SENSIN, who are men of\r\nextraordinary abstinence after their fashion, and lead a life of such\r\nhardship as I will describe. All their life long they eat nothing but\r\nbran,{15} which they take mixt with hot water. That is their food:\r\nbran, and nothing but bran; and water for their drink. ’Tis a lifelong\r\nfast! so that I may well say their life is one of extraordinary\r\nasceticism. They have great idols, and plenty of them; but they\r\nsometimes also worship fire. The other Idolaters who are not of this\r\nsect call these people heretics—_Patarins_ as we should say{16}—because\r\nthey do not worship their idols in their own fashion. Those of whom I\r\nam speaking would not take a wife on any consideration.{17} They wear\r\ndresses of hempen stuff, black and blue,{18} and sleep upon mats; in\r\nfact their asceticism is something astonishing. Their idols are all\r\nfeminine, that is to say, they have women’s names.{19}\r\n\r\nNow let us have done with this subject, and let me tell you of the\r\ngreat state and wonderful magnificence of the Great Lord of Lords; I\r\nmean that great Prince who is the Sovereign of the Tartars, CUBLAY by\r\nname, that most noble and puissant Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[There were two roads to go from Peking to Shangtu: the\r\n  eastern road through Tu-shi-k’ow, and the western (used for the\r\n  return journey) road by Ye-hu ling. Polo took this last road, which\r\n  ran from Peking to Siuen-te chau through the same places as now;\r\n  but from the latter town it led, not to Kalgan as it does now,\r\n  but more to the west, to a place called now Shan-fang pú where\r\n  the pass across the Ye-hu ling range begins. “On both these roads\r\n  _nabo_, or temporary palaces, were built, as resting-places for\r\n  the Khans; eighteen on the eastern road, and twenty-four on the\r\n  western.” (_Palladius_, p. 25.) The same author makes (p. 26) the\r\n  following remarks: “M. Polo’s statement that he travelled three\r\n  days from Siuen-te chau to Chagannor, and three days also from the\r\n  latter place to Shang-tu, agrees with the information contained\r\n  in the ‘Researches on the Routes to Shangtu.’ The Chinese authors\r\n  have not given the precise position of Lake Chagannor; there are\r\n  several lakes in the desert on the road to Shangtu, and their names\r\n  have changed with time. The palace in Chagannor was built in 1280”\r\n  (according to the _Siu t’ung kien_).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—_Chandu_, called more correctly in Ramusio _Xandu_, _i.e._\r\n  SHANDU, and by Fr. Odorico _Sandu_, viz. SHANG-TU or “Upper Court,”\r\n  the Chinese title of Kúblái’s summer residence at Kaipingfu,\r\n  _Mongolicè_ Keibung (see ch. xiii. of Prologue) [is called also\r\n  _Loan king_, _i.e._ “the capital on the Loan River,” according to\r\n  Palladius, p. 26.—H. C.]. The ruins still exist, in about lat. 40°\r\n  22′, and a little west of the longitude of Peking. The site is 118\r\n  miles in direct line from Chaghan-nor, making Polo’s three marches\r\n  into rides of unusual length.[1] The ruins bear the Mongol name\r\n  of _Chao Naiman Sumé Khotan_, meaning “city of the 108 temples,”\r\n  and are about 26 miles to the north-west of Dolon-nor, a bustling,\r\n  dirty town of modern origin, famous for the manufactory of idols,\r\n  bells, and other ecclesiastical paraphernalia of Buddhism. The site\r\n  was visited (though not described) by Père Gerbillon in 1691, and\r\n  since then by no European traveller till 1872, when Dr. Bushell\r\n  of the British Legation at Peking, and the Hon. T. G. Grosvenor,\r\n  made a journey thither from the capital, by way of the Nan-kau Pass\r\n  (_supra_ p. 26), Kalgan, and the vicinity of Chaghan-nor, the route\r\n  that would seem to have been habitually followed, in their annual\r\n  migration, by Kúblái and his successors.\r\n\r\n  The deserted site, overgrown with rank weeds and grass, stands but\r\n  little above the marshy bed of the river, which here preserves the\r\n  name of Shang-tu, and about a mile from its north or left bank. The\r\n  walls, of earth faced with brick and unhewn stone, still stand,\r\n  forming, as in the Tartar city of Peking, a double _enceinte_, of\r\n  which the inner line no doubt represents the area of the “Marble\r\n  Palace” of which Polo speaks. This forms a square of about 2 _li_\r\n  (⅔ of a mile) to the side, and has three gates—south, east, and\r\n  west, of which the southern one still stands intact, a perfect\r\n  arch, 20 ft. high and 12 ft. wide. The outer wall forms a square of\r\n  4 _li_ (1⅓ mile) to the side, and has six gates. The foundations\r\n  of temples and palace-buildings can be traced, and both enclosures\r\n  are abundantly strewn with blocks of marble and fragments of lions,\r\n  dragons, and other sculptures, testifying to the former existence\r\n  of a flourishing city, but exhibiting now scarcely one stone upon\r\n  another. A broken memorial tablet was found, half buried in the\r\n  ground, within the north-east angle of the outer rampart, bearing\r\n  an inscription in an antique form of the Chinese character, which\r\n  proves it to have been erected by Kúblái, in honour of a Buddhist\r\n  ecclesiastic called Yun-Hien. Yun-Hien was the abbot of one of\r\n  those great minsters and abbeys of _Bacsis_, of which Marco\r\n  speaks, and the exact date (no longer visible) of the monument was\r\n  equivalent to A.D. 1288.[2]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                                Heading\r\n         In the Old Chinese Seal-Character, of an INSCRIPTION\r\n                  on a Memorial raised by KÚBLÁI-KAAN\r\n    to a Buddhist Ecclesiastic in the vicinity of his SUMMER-PALACE\r\n                       at SHANG-TU in Mongolia.\r\n Reduced from a facsimile obtained on the spot by Dr. _S. W. Bushell_,\r\n                                 1872.]\r\n\r\n  This city occupies the south-east angle of a more extensive\r\n  enclosure, bounded by what is now a grassy mound, and embracing,\r\n  on Dr. Bushell’s estimate, about 5 square miles. Further knowledge\r\n  may explain the discrepancy from Marco’s dimension, but this must\r\n  be the park of which he speaks.[3] The woods and fountains have\r\n  disappeared, like the temples and palaces; all is dreary and\r\n  desolate, though still abounding in the game which was one of\r\n  Kúblái’s attractions to the spot. A small monastery, occupied by\r\n  six or seven wretched Lamas, is the only building that remains in\r\n  the vicinity. The river Shangtu, which lower down becomes the Lan\r\n  [or Loan]-Ho, was formerly navigated from the sea up to this place\r\n  by flat grain-boats.\r\n\r\n  [Mgr. de Harlez gave in the _T’oung Pao_ (x. p. 73) an inscription\r\n  in _Chuen_ character on a _stele_ found in the ruins of Shangtu,\r\n  and built by an officer with the permission of the Emperor; it is\r\n  probably a token of imperial favour; the inscription means: _Great\r\n  Longevity_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In the wail which Sanang Setzen, the poetical historian of the\r\n  Mongols, puts, perhaps with some traditional basis, into the mouth\r\n  of Toghon Temur, the last of the Chinghizide Dynasty in China, when\r\n  driven from his throne, the changes are rung on the lost glories of\r\n  his capital _Daïtu_ (see _infra_, Book II. ch. xi.) and his summer\r\n  palace _Shangtu_; thus (I translate from Schott’s amended German\r\n  rendering of the Mongol):\r\n\r\n    “My vast and noble Capital, My Daïtu, My splendidly adorned!\r\n     And Thou my cool and delicious Summer-seat, my Shangtu-Keibung!\r\n     Ye, also, yellow plains of Shangtu, Delight of my godlike Sires!\r\n     I suffered myself to drop into dreams,—and lo! my Empire was gone!\r\n       Ah Thou my Daïtu, built of the nine precious substances!\r\n     Ah my Shangtu-Keibung, Union of all perfections!\r\n     Ah my Fame! Ah my Glory, as Khagan and Lord of the Earth!\r\n     When I used to awake betimes and look forth, how the breezes blew\r\n         loaded with fragrance!\r\n     And turn which way I would all was glorious perfection of beauty!\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n       Alas for my illustrious name as the Sovereign of the World!\r\n       Alas for my Daïtu, seat of Sanctity, Glorious work of the\r\n           Immortal KÚBLÁI!\r\n         All, all is rent from me!”\r\n\r\n  It was, in 1797, whilst reading this passage of Marco’s narrative\r\n  in old Purchas that Coleridge fell asleep, and dreamt the dream of\r\n  Kúblái’s Paradise, beginning:\r\n\r\n      “In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\r\n         A stately pleasure-dome decree:\r\n       Where Alph, the sacred River, ran\r\n       Through caverns measureless to man\r\n         Down to a sunless sea.\r\n       So twice five miles of fertile ground\r\n       With walls and towers were girdled round:\r\n       And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills\r\n         Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\r\n       And here were forests ancient as the hills,\r\n         Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”\r\n\r\n  It would be a singular coincidence in relation to this poem were\r\n  Klaproth’s reading correct of a passage in Rashiduddin which he\r\n  renders as saying that the palace at Kaiminfu was “called Langtin,\r\n  and was built after a plan that Kúblái had seen in a dream, and\r\n  had retained in his memory.” But I suspect D’Ohsson’s reading is\r\n  more accurate, which runs: “Kúblái caused a Palace to be built for\r\n  him east of Kaipingfu, called Lengten; _but he abandoned it in\r\n  consequence of a dream._” For we see from Sanang Setzen that the\r\n  Palaces of Lengten and Kaiming or Shangtu were distinct; “Between\r\n  the year of the Rat (1264), when Kúblái was fifty years old, and\r\n  the year of the Sheep (1271), in the space of eight years, he\r\n  built four great cities, viz. for Summer Residence SHANGTU KEIBUNG\r\n  Kürdu Balgasun, for Winter Residence Yeke DAÏTU Khotan, and on\r\n  the shady side of the Altai (see ch. li. note 3, _supra_) Arulun\r\n  TSAGHAN BALGASUN, and Erchügin LANGTING Balgasun.” A valuable\r\n  letter from Dr. Bushell enables me now to indicate the position\r\n  of Langtin: “The district through which the river flows eastward\r\n  from Shangtu is known to the Mongolians of the present day by the\r\n  name of _Lang-tírh_ (_Lang-ting’rh_).... The ruins of the city are\r\n  marked on a Chinese map in my possession Pai-dseng-tzu, _i.e._\r\n  ‘White City,’ implying that it was formerly an Imperial residence.\r\n  The remains of the wall are 7 or 8 _li_ in diameter, of stone, and\r\n  situated about 40 _li_ north-north-west from Dolon-nor.”\r\n\r\n  (_Gerbillon_ in _Astley_, IV. 701–716; Klaproth, in _J.

The lintels of the doors were tastefully\r\n  ornamented, and the roofs covered with shining tiles, the\r\n  splendours of which were multiplied by mutual reflection and from\r\n  moment to moment took a thousand forms.” (_Vie et Voyages_, 157.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—[Rubruck says (_Rockhill_, p. 248): “I saw also the envoy\r\n  of a certain Soldan of India, who had brought eight leopards and\r\n  ten _greyhounds_, taught to sit on horses’ backs, as leopards\r\n  sit.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Ramusio’s is here so much more lucid than the other texts,\r\n  that I have adhered mainly to his account of the building. The\r\n  roof described is of a kind in use in the Indian Archipelago,\r\n  and in some other parts of Transgangetic India, in which the\r\n  semi-cylinders of bamboo are laid just like Roman tiles.\r\n\r\n  Rashiduddin gives a curious account of the way in which the\r\n  foundations of the terrace on which this palace stood were erected\r\n  in a lake. He says, too, in accord with Polo: “Inside the city\r\n  itself a second palace was built, about a bowshot from the first:\r\n  but the Kaan generally takes up his residence in the palace outside\r\n  the town,” _i.e._, as I imagine, in Marco’s Cane Palace. (_Cathay_,\r\n  pp. 261–262.)\r\n\r\n  [“The _Palace of canes_ is probably the Palm Hall, _Tsung tien_,\r\n  alias _Tsung mao tien_, of the Chinese authors, which was situated\r\n  in the western palace garden of Shangtu. Mention is made also in\r\n  the _Altan Tobchi_ of a cane tent in Shangtu.” (_Palladius_, p.\r\n  27.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Marco might well say of the bamboo that “it serves also a great\r\n  variety of other purposes.” An intelligent native of Arakan who\r\n  accompanied me in wanderings on duty in the forests of the Burmese\r\n  frontier in the beginning of 1853, and who used to ask many\r\n  questions about Europe, seemed able to apprehend almost everything\r\n  except the possibility of existence in a country without bamboos!\r\n  “When I speak of bamboo huts, I mean to say that posts and walls,\r\n  wall-plates and rafters, floor and thatch, and the withes that bind\r\n  them, are all of bamboo. In fact, it might almost be said that\r\n  among the Indo-Chinese nations the staff of life is _a bamboo!_\r\n  Scaffolding and ladders, landing-jetties, fishing apparatus,\r\n  irrigation wheels and scoops, oars, masts, and yards [and in China,\r\n  sails, cables, and caulking, asparagus, medicine, and works of\r\n  fantastic art], spears and arrows, hats and helmets, bow, bowstring\r\n  and quiver, oil-cans, water-stoups and cooking-pots, pipe-sticks\r\n  [tinder and means of producing fire], conduits, clothes-boxes,\r\n  pawn-boxes, dinner-trays, pickles, preserves, and melodious musical\r\n  instruments, torches, footballs, cordage, bellows, mats, paper;\r\n  these are but a few of the articles that are made from the bamboo;”\r\n  and in China, to sum up the whole, as Barrow observes, it maintains\r\n  order throughout the Empire!

Arch._ I. 120 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Pavilion at Yuen-ming-Yuen.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—“The Emperor ... began this year (1264) to depart from\r\n  Yenking (Peking) in the second or third month for Shangtu, not\r\n  returning until the eighth month. Every year he made this passage,\r\n  and all the Mongol emperors who succeeded him followed his\r\n  example.” (_Gaubil_, p. 144.)\r\n\r\n  [“The Khans usually resorted to Shangtu in the 4th moon and\r\n  returned to Peking in the 9th. On the 7th day of the 7th moon there\r\n  were libations performed in honour of the ancestors; a shaman, his\r\n  face to the north, uttered in a loud voice the names of Chingiz\r\n  Khan and of other deceased Khans, and poured mare’s milk on the\r\n  ground. The propitious day for the return journey to Peking was\r\n  also appointed then.” (_Palladius_, p. 26.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—White horses were presented in homage to the Kaan on New\r\n  Year’s Day (_the White Feast_), as we shall see below. (Bk. II. ch.\r\n  xv.) Odoric also mentions this practice; and, according to Huc,\r\n  the Mongol chiefs continued it at least to the time of the Emperor\r\n  K’ang-hi. Indeed Timkowski speaks of annual tributes of white\r\n  camels and white horses from the Khans of the Kalkas and other\r\n  Mongol dignitaries, in the present century. (_Huc’s Tartary_, etc.;\r\n  _Tim._ II. 33.)\r\n\r\n  By the HORIAD are no doubt intended the UIRAD or OIRAD, a name\r\n  usually interpreted as signifying the “Closely Allied,” or\r\n  Confederates; but Vámbéry explains it as (Turki) _Oyurat_, “Grey\r\n  horse,” to which the statement in our text appears to lend colour.\r\n  They were not of the tribes properly called Mongol, but after their\r\n  submission to Chinghiz they remained closely attached to him.\r\n  In Chinghiz’s victory over Aung-Khan, as related by S. Setzen,\r\n  we find Turulji Taishi, the son of the chief of the Oirad, one\r\n  of Chinghiz’s three chief captains; perhaps that is the victory\r\n  alluded to. The seats of the Oirad appear to have been about the\r\n  head waters of the Kem, or Upper Yenisei.\r\n\r\n  In A.D. 1295 there took place a curious desertion from the service\r\n  of Gházán Khan of Persia of a vast corps of the Oirad, said\r\n  to amount to 18,000 _tents_. They made their way to Damascus,\r\n  where they were well received by the Mameluke Sultan. But their\r\n  heathenish practices gave dire offence to the Faithful. They were\r\n  settled in the _Sáhil_, or coast districts of Palestine. Many died\r\n  speedily; the rest embraced Islam, spread over the country, and\r\n  gradually became absorbed in the general population. Their sons and\r\n  daughters were greatly admired for their beauty. (_S. Setz._ p. 87;\r\n  _Erdmann_, 187; _Pallas, Samml._ I. 5 _seqq._; _Makrizi_, III. 29;\r\n  _Bretschneider, Med. Res._ II. p. 159 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  [With reference to Yule’s conjecture, I may quote Palladius (_l.c._\r\n  p. 27): “It is, however, strange that the Oirats alone enjoyed the\r\n  privilege described by Marco Polo; for the highest position at the\r\n  Mongol Khan’s court belonged to the Kunkrat tribe, out of which the\r\n  Khans used to choose their first wives, who were called Empresses\r\n  of the first _ordo_.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—Rubruquis assigns such a festival to the month of May: “On\r\n  the 9th day of the May Moon they collect all the white mares of\r\n  their herds and consecrate them. The Christian priests also must\r\n  then assemble with their thuribles. They then sprinkle new cosmos\r\n  (_kumíz_) on the ground, and make a great feast that day, for\r\n  according to their calendar, it is their time of first drinking\r\n  new cosmos, just as we reckon of our new wine at the feast of St.\r\n  Bartholomew (24th August), or that of St. Sixtus (6th August),\r\n  or of our fruit on the feast of St. James and St. Christopher”\r\n  (25th July). [With reference to this feast, Mr. Rockhill gives\r\n  (_Rubruck_, p. 241, note) extracts from _Pallas, Voyages_, IV. 579,\r\n  and _Professor Radloff, Aus Siberien_, I. 378.—H. C.] The Yakuts\r\n  also hold such a festival in June or July, when the mares foal, and\r\n  immense wooden goblets of kumíz are emptied on that occasion. They\r\n  also pour out kumíz for the Spirits to the four quarters of heaven.\r\n\r\n  The following passage occurs in the narrative of the Journey of\r\n  Chang Te-hui, a Chinese teacher, who was summoned to visit the\r\n  camp of Kúblái in Mongolia, some twelve years before that Prince\r\n  ascended the throne of the Kaans:[4]\r\n\r\n  “On the 9th day of the 9th Moon (October), the Prince, having\r\n  called his subjects before his chief tent, performed the libation\r\n  of the milk of a white mare. This was the customary sacrifice\r\n  at that time. The vessels used were made of birch-bark, not\r\n  ornamented with either silver or gold. Such here is the respect for\r\n  simplicity....\r\n\r\n  “At the last day of the year the Mongols suddenly changed their\r\n  camping-ground to another place, for the mutual congratulation\r\n  on the 1st Moon. Then there was every day feasting before the\r\n  tents for the lower ranks. Beginning with the Prince, all dressed\r\n  themselves in white fur clothing....[5]\r\n\r\n  “On the 9th day of the 4th Moon (May) the Prince again collected\r\n  his vassals before the chief tent for the libation of the milk of a\r\n  white mare. This sacrifice is performed twice a year.”\r\n\r\n  It has been seen (p. 308) that Rubruquis also names the 9th day\r\n  of the May moon as that of the consecration of the white mares.\r\n  The autumn libation is described by Polo as performed on the 28th\r\n  day of the August moon, probably because it was unsuited to the\r\n  circumstances of the Court at Cambaluc, where the Kaan was during\r\n  October, and the day named was the last of his annual stay in the\r\n  Mongolian uplands.\r\n\r\n  Baber tells that among the ceremonies of a Mongol Review the Khan\r\n  and his staff took kumíz and sprinkled it towards the standards. An\r\n  Armenian author of the Mongol era says that it was the custom of\r\n  the Tartars, before drinking, to sprinkle drink towards heaven, and\r\n  towards the four quarters. Mr. Atkinson notices the same practice\r\n  among the Kirghiz; and I found the like in old days among the\r\n  Kasias of the eastern frontier of Bengal.\r\n\r\n  The time of year assigned by Polo for the ceremony implies some\r\n  change. Perhaps it had been made to coincide with the Festival\r\n  of Water Consecration of the Lamas, with which the time named\r\n  in the text seems to correspond. On that occasion the Lamas go\r\n  in procession to the rivers and lakes and consecrate them by\r\n  benediction and by casting in offerings, attended by much popular\r\n  festivity.\r\n\r\n  Rubruquis seems to intimate that the Nestorian priests were\r\n  employed to consecrate the white mares by incensing them. In the\r\n  rear of Lord Canning’s camp in India I once came upon the party of\r\n  his _Shutr Suwárs_, or dromedary-express riders, busily engaged in\r\n  incensing with frankincense the whole of the dromedaries, which\r\n  were kneeling in a circle. I could get no light on the practice,\r\n  but it was very probably a relic of the old Mongol custom. (_Rubr._\r\n  363; _Erman_, II. 397; _Billings’ Journey_, Fr. Tr. I. 217;\r\n  _Baber_, 103; _J. As._ sér. V. tom. xi. p. 249; _Atk. Amoor_, p.\r\n  47; _J. A. S. B._ XIII. 628; _Koeppen_, II. 313.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—The practice of weather-conjuring was in great vogue among\r\n  the Mongols, and is often alluded to in their history.\r\n\r\n  The operation was performed by means of a stone of magical virtues,\r\n  called _Yadah_ or _Jadah-Tásh_, which was placed in or hung over\r\n  a basin of water with sundry ceremonies. The possession of such a\r\n  stone is ascribed by the early Arab traveller Ibn Mohalhal to the\r\n  _Ḳímák_, a great tribe of the Turks. In the war raised against\r\n  Chinghiz and Aung Khan, when still allies, by a great confederation\r\n  of the Naiman and other tribes in 1202, we are told that Sengun,\r\n  the son of Aung Khan, when sent to meet the enemy, caused them to\r\n  be enchanted, so that all their attempted movements against him\r\n  were defeated by snow and mist. The fog and darkness were indeed so\r\n  dense that many men and horses fell over precipices, and many also\r\n  perished with cold. In another account of (apparently) the same\r\n  matter, given by Mir-Khond, the conjuring is set on foot by the\r\n  _Yadachi_ of Buyruk Khan, Prince of the Naiman, but the mischief\r\n  all rebounds on the conjurer’s own side.\r\n\r\n  In Tului’s invasion of Honan in 1231–1232, Rashiduddin describes\r\n  him, when in difficulty, as using the _Jadah_ stone with success.\r\n\r\n  Timur, in his Memoirs, speaks of the Jets using incantations to\r\n  produce heavy rains which hindered his cavalry from acting against\r\n  them. A _Yadachi_ was captured, and when his head had been taken\r\n  off the storm ceased.\r\n\r\n  Baber speaks of one of his early friends, Khwaja Ka Mulai, as\r\n  excelling in falconry and acquainted with _Yadagarí_ or the\r\n  art of bringing on rain and snow by means of enchantment. When\r\n  the Russians besieged Kazan in 1552 they suffered much from\r\n  the constant heavy rains, and this annoyance was universally\r\n  ascribed to the arts of the Tartar Queen, who was celebrated as an\r\n  enchantress. Sháh Abbás believed he had learned the Tartar secret,\r\n  and put much confidence in it. (_P. Della V._ I. 869.)\r\n\r\n  [Grenard says (II. p. 256) the most powerful and most feared of\r\n  sorcerers [in Chinese Turkestan] is the _djâduger_, who, to produce\r\n  rain or fine weather, uses a jade stone, given by Noah to Japhet.\r\n  Grenard adds (II. 406–407) there are sorcerers (Ngag-pa-snags-pa)\r\n  whose specialty is to make rain fall; they are similar to the\r\n  Turkish _Yadachi_ and like them use a stone called “water cristal,”\r\n  _chu shel_; probably jade stone.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 245, note) writes: “Rashideddin states\r\n  that when the Urianghit wanted to bring a storm to an end, they\r\n  said injuries to the sky, the lightning and thunder. I have seen\r\n  this done myself by Mongol storm-dispellers. (See _Diary_, 201,\r\n  203.) ‘The other Mongol people,’ he adds, ‘do the contrary. When\r\n  the storm rumbles, they remain shut up in their huts, full of\r\n  fear.’ The subject of storm-making, and the use of stones for that\r\n  purpose, is fully discussed by Quatremère, _Histoire_, 438–440.”\r\n  (Cf. also _Rockhill_, _l.c._ p. 254.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  An edict of the Emperor Shi-tsung, of the reigning dynasty,\r\n  addressed in 1724–1725 to the Eight Banners of Mongolia, warns\r\n  them against this rain-conjuring: “If I,” indignantly observes\r\n  the Emperor, “offering prayer in sincerity have yet room to fear\r\n  that it may please Heaven to leave MY prayer unanswered, it is\r\n  truly intolerable that mere common people wishing for rain should\r\n  at their own caprice set up altars of earth, and bring together\r\n  a rabble of Hoshang (Buddhist Bonzes) and Taossé to conjure the\r\n  spirits to gratify their wishes.”\r\n\r\n  [“Lamas were of various extraction; at the time of the great\r\n  assemblies, and of the Khan’s festivities in Shangtu, they erected\r\n  an altar near the Khan’s tent and prayed for fine weather; the\r\n  whistling of shells rose up to heaven.” These are the words in\r\n  which Marco Polo’s narrative is corroborated by an eye-witness who\r\n  has celebrated the remarkable objects of Shangtu (_Loan king tsa\r\n  yung_). These Lamas, in spite of the prohibition by the Buddhist\r\n  creed of bloody sacrifices, used to sacrifice sheep’s hearts to\r\n  Mahakala. It happened, as it seems, that the heart of an executed\r\n  criminal was also considered an agreeable offering; and as the\r\n  offerings could be, after the ceremony, eaten by the sacrificing\r\n  priests, Marco Polo had some reason to accuse the Lamas of\r\n  cannibalism. (_Palladius_, 28.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The practice of weather-conjuring is not yet obsolete in Tartary,\r\n  Tibet, and the adjoining countries.[6]\r\n\r\n  Weather-conjuring stories were also rife in Europe during the\r\n  Middle Ages. One such is conspicuously introduced in connection\r\n  with a magical fountain in the romance of the _Chevalier au Lyon_:\r\n\r\n      “Et s’i pant uns bacins d’or fin\r\n       A une si longue chaainne\r\n       Qui dure jusqu’a la fontainne.\r\n       Lez la fontainne troveras\r\n       Un perron tel con tu verras\r\n          *     *     *     *\r\n       S’au bacin viaus de l’iaue prandre\r\n       Et dessor le perron espandre,\r\n       La verras une tel tanpeste\r\n       Qu’an cest bois ne remandra beste,”\r\n           etc.         etc.[7]\r\n\r\n  The effect foretold in these lines is the subject of a woodcut\r\n  illustrating a Welsh version of the same tale in the first volume\r\n  of the _Mabinogion_. And the existence of such a fountain is\r\n  alluded to by Alexander Neckam. (_De Naturis Rerum_, Bk. II. ch.\r\n  vii.)\r\n\r\n  In the _Cento Novelle Antiche_ also certain necromancers exhibit\r\n  their craft before the Emperor Frederic (Barbarossa apparently):\r\n  “The weather began to be overcast, and lo! of a sudden rain began\r\n  to fall with continued thunders and lightnings, as if the world\r\n  were come to an end, and hailstones that looked like steel-caps,”\r\n  etc. Various other European legends of like character will be found\r\n  in _Liebrecht’s Gervasius von Tilbury_, pp. 147–148.\r\n\r\n  Rain-makers there are in many parts of the world; but it is\r\n  remarkable that those also of Samoa in the Pacific operate by means\r\n  of a _rain-stone_.\r\n\r\n  Such weather conjurings as we have spoken of are ascribed by Ovid\r\n  to Circe:\r\n\r\n      “Concipit illa preces, et verba venefica dicit;\r\n       Ignotosque Deos ignoto carmine adorat,\r\n            *     *     *     *\r\n       _Tunc quoque cantato densetur carmine caelum,\r\n       Et nebulas exhalat humus_.”—_Metam._ XIV. 365.\r\n\r\n  And to Medea:—\r\n\r\n      ————“Quum volui, ripis mirantibus, amnes\r\n      In fontes rediere suos ... (another feat of the Lamas)\r\n                  ... _Nubila pello,\r\n      Nubilaque induco; ventos abigoque, vocoque_.”—_Ibid._ VII. 199.\r\n\r\n  And by Tibullus to the _Saga_ (_Eleg._ I. 2, 45); whilst\r\n  Empedocles, in verses ascribed to him by Diogenes Laertius, claims\r\n  power to communicate like secrets of potency:—\r\n\r\n                          “By my spells thou may’st\r\n      To timely sunshine turn the purple rains,\r\n      And parching droughts to fertilising floods.”\r\n\r\n  (See _Cathay_, p. clxxxvii.; _Erdm._ 282; _Oppert_, 182 _seqq._;\r\n  _Erman_, I. 153; _Pallas, Samml._ II. 348 _seqq._; _Timk._ I. 402;\r\n  _J.

R._ p. 428 _seqq._, and _Hammer’s\r\n  Golden Horde_, 207 and 435 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 9.—It is not clear whether Marco attributes this cannibalism\r\n  to the Tibetans and Kashmirians, or brings it in as a particular of\r\n  Tartar custom which he had forgotten to mention before.\r\n\r\n  The accusations of cannibalism indeed against the Tibetans in old\r\n  accounts are frequent, and I have elsewhere (see _Cathay_, p. 151)\r\n  remarked on some singular Tibetan practices which go far to account\r\n  for such charges. Della Penna, too, makes a statement which bears\r\n  curiously on the present passage. Remarking on the great use made\r\n  by certain classes of the Lamas of human skulls for magical cups,\r\n  and of human thigh bones for flutes and whistles, he says that\r\n  to supply them with these _the bodies of executed criminals were\r\n  stored up at the disposal of the Lamas_; and a Hindu account of\r\n  Tibet in the _Asiatic Researches_ asserts that when one is killed\r\n  in a fight both parties rush forward and struggle for the liver,\r\n  which they eat (vol. xv).\r\n\r\n  [Carpini says of the people of Tibet: “They are pagans; they have\r\n  a most astonishing, or rather horrible, custom, for, when any\r\n  one’s father is about to give up the ghost, all the relatives meet\r\n  together, and they eat him, as was told to me for certain.” Mr.\r\n  Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 152, note) writes: “So far as I am aware,\r\n  this charge [of cannibalism] is not made by any Oriental writer\r\n  against the Tibetans, though both Arab travellers to China in the\r\n  ninth century and Armenian historians of the thirteenth century say\r\n  the Chinese practised cannibalism. The Armenians designate China by\r\n  the name _Nankas_, which I take to be Chinese _Nan-kuo_, ‘southern\r\n  country,’ the _Manzi_ country of Marco Polo.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  But like charges of cannibalism are brought against both Chinese\r\n  and Tartars very positively. Thus, without going back to the\r\n  Anthropophagous Scythians of Ptolemy and Mela, we read in the\r\n  _Relations_ of the Arab travellers of the ninth century: “In\r\n  China it occurs sometimes that the governor of a province revolts\r\n  from his duty to the emperor. In such a case he is slaughtered\r\n  and eaten. _In fact, the Chinese eat the flesh of all men who\r\n  are executed by the sword_.” Dr. Rennie mentions a superstitious\r\n  practice, the continued existence of which in our own day he has\r\n  himself witnessed, and which might perhaps have given rise to some\r\n  such statement as that of the Arab travellers, if it be not indeed\r\n  a relic, in a mitigated form, of the very practice they assert to\r\n  have prevailed. After an execution at Peking certain large pith\r\n  balls are steeped in the blood, and under the name of _blood-bread_\r\n  are sold as a medicine for consumption. _It is only to the blood of\r\n  decapitated criminals that any such healing power is attributed_.\r\n  It has been asserted in the annals of the _Propagation de la Foi_\r\n  that the Chinese executioners of M. Chapdelaine, a missionary who\r\n  was martyred in Kwang-si in 1856 (28th February), were seen to eat\r\n  the heart of their victim; and M. Huot, a missionary in the Yun-nan\r\n  province, recounts a case of cannibalism which he witnessed. Bishop\r\n  Chauveau, at Ta Ts’ien-lu, told Mr. Cooper that he had seen men\r\n  in one of the cities of Yun-nan eating the heart and brains of a\r\n  celebrated robber who had been executed. Dr. Carstairs Douglas of\r\n  Amoy also tells me that the like practices have occurred at Amoy\r\n  and Swatau.\r\n\r\n  [With reference to cannibalism in China see _Medical Superstitions\r\n  an Incentive to Anti-Foreign Riots in China_, by _D. J. Macgowan,\r\n  North China Herald_, 8th July, 1892, pp. 60–62. Mr. E. H. Parker\r\n  (_China Review_, February–March, 1901, 136) relates that the\r\n  inhabitants of a part of Kwang-si boiled and ate a Chinese officer\r\n  who had been sent to pacify them. “The idea underlying this\r\n  horrible act [cannibalism] is, that by eating a portion of the\r\n  victim, especially the heart, one acquires the valour with which he\r\n  was endowed.” (_Dennys’ Folk-lore of China_, 67.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Hayton, the Armenian, after relating the treason of a Saracen,\r\n  called Parwana (he was an Iconian Turk), against Abaka Khan,\r\n  says: “He was taken and cut in two, and orders were issued that\r\n  in all the food eaten by Abaka there should be put a portion of\r\n  the traitor’s flesh. Of this Abaka himself ate, and caused all his\r\n  barons to partake. _And this was in accordance with the custom\r\n  of the Tartars_.” The same story is related independently and\r\n  differently by Friar Ricold, thus: “When the army of Abaga ran\r\n  away from the Saracens in Syria, a certain great Tartar baron was\r\n  arrested who had been guilty of treason. And when the Emperor Khan\r\n  was giving the order for his execution the Tartar ladies and women\r\n  interposed, and begged that he might be made over to them. Having\r\n  got hold of the prisoner they boiled him alive, and cutting his\r\n  body up into mince-meat gave it to eat to the whole army, as an\r\n  example to others.” Vincent of Beauvais makes a like statement:\r\n  “When they capture any one who is at bitter enmity with them, they\r\n  gather together and eat him in vengeance of his revolt, and like\r\n  infernal leeches suck his blood,” a custom of which a modern Mongol\r\n  writer thinks that he finds a trace in a surviving proverb. Among\r\n  more remote and ignorant Franks the cannibalism of the Tartars was\r\n  a general belief. Ivo of Narbonne, in his letter written during the\r\n  great Tartar invasion of Europe (1242), declares that the Tartar\r\n  chiefs, with their dog’s head followers and other _Lotophagi_\r\n  (!), ate the bodies of their victims like so much bread; whilst\r\n  a Venetian chronicler, speaking of the council of Lyons in 1274,\r\n  says there was a discussion about making a general move against the\r\n  Tartars, “_porce qu’il manjuent la char humaine._” These latter\r\n  writers no doubt rehearsed mere popular beliefs, but Hayton and\r\n  Ricold were both intelligent persons well acquainted with the\r\n  Tartars, and Hayton at least not prejudiced against them.\r\n\r\n  The old belief was revived in Prussia during the Seven Years’ War,\r\n  in regard to the Kalmaks of the Russian army; and Bergmann says\r\n  the old Kalmak warriors confessed to him that they had done what\r\n  they could to encourage it by cutting up the bodies of the slain\r\n  in presence of their prisoners, and roasting them! But Levchine\r\n  relates an act on the part of the Kirghiz Kazaks which was no jest.\r\n  They drank the blood of their victim if they did not eat his flesh.\r\n\r\n  There is some reason to believe that cannibalism was in the Middle\r\n  Ages generally a less strange and unwonted horror than we should at\r\n  first blush imagine, and especially that it was an idea tolerably\r\n  familiar in China. M. Bazin, in the second part of _Chine Moderne_,\r\n  p. 461, after sketching a Chinese drama of the Mongol era (“The\r\n  Devotion of Chao-li”), the plot of which turns on the acts of a\r\n  body of cannibals, quotes several other passages from Chinese\r\n  authors which indicate this. Nor is this wonderful in the age that\r\n  had experienced the horrors of the Mongol wars.\r\n\r\n  That was no doubt a fable which Carpini heard in the camp of the\r\n  Great Kaan, that in one of the Mongol sieges in Cathay, when the\r\n  army was without food, one man in ten of their own force was\r\n  sacrificed to feed the remainder.[8] But we are told in sober\r\n  history that the force of Tului in Honan, in 1231–1232, was reduced\r\n  to such straits as to eat grass and human flesh. At the siege of\r\n  the Kin capital Kaifongfu, in 1233, the besieged were reduced to\r\n  the like extremity; and the same occurred the same year at the\r\n  siege of Tsaichau; and in 1262, when the rebel general Litan was\r\n  besieged in Tsinanfu. The Taiping wars the other day revived the\r\n  same horrors in all their magnitude. And savage acts of the same\r\n  kind by the Chinese and their Turk partisans in the defence of\r\n  Kashgar were related to Mr. Shaw.\r\n\r\n  Probably, however, nothing of the kind in history equals what\r\n  Abdallatif, a sober and scientific physician, describes as having\r\n  occurred before his own eyes in the great Egyptian famine of A.H.\r\n  597 (1200). The horrid details fill a chapter of some length, and\r\n  we need not quote from them.\r\n\r\n  Nor was Christendom without the rumour of such barbarities.\r\n  The story of King Richard’s banquet in presence of Saladin’s\r\n  ambassadors on the head of a Saracen curried (for so it surely\r\n  was),—\r\n\r\n              “soden full hastily\r\n      With powder and with spysory,\r\n      And with saffron of good colour”—\r\n\r\n  fable as it is, is told with a zest that makes one shudder; but the\r\n  tale in the _Chanson d’Antioche_, of how the licentious bands of\r\n  ragamuffins, who hung on the army of the First Crusade, and were\r\n  known as the _Tafurs_,[9] ate the Turks whom they killed at the\r\n  siege, looks very like an abominable truth, corroborated as it\r\n  is by the prose chronicle of worse deeds at the ensuing siege of\r\n  Marrha:—\r\n\r\n      “A lor cotiaus qu’il ont trenchans et afilés\r\n       Escorchoient les Turs, aval parmi les près.\r\n       Voiant Paiens, les ont par pièces découpés.\r\n       En l’iave et el carbon les ont bien quisinés,\r\n       Volontiers les menjuent sans pain et dessalés.”[10]\r\n\r\n  (_Della Penna_, p. 76; _Reinaud, Rel._ I. 52; _Rennie’s Peking_,\r\n  II. 244; _Ann. de la Pr. de la F._ XXIX. 353, XXI. 298; _Hayton_\r\n  in _Ram._ ch. xvii.; _Per.

Anecd._ III. 172.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 10.—_Bakhshi_ is generally believed to be a corruption of\r\n  _Bhikshu_, the proper Sanscrit term for a religious mendicant,\r\n  and in particular for the Buddhist devotees of that character.\r\n  _Bakhshi_ was probably applied to a class only of the Lamas, but\r\n  among the Turks and Persians it became a generic name for them all.\r\n  In this sense it is habitually used by Rashiduddin, and thus also\r\n  in the Ain Akbari: “The learned among the Persians and Arabians\r\n  call the priests of this (Buddhist) religion _Bukshee_, and in\r\n  Tibbet they are styled Lamas.”\r\n\r\n  According to Pallas the word among the modern Mongols is used in\r\n  the sense of _Teacher_, and is applied to the oldest and most\r\n  learned priest of a community, who is the local ecclesiastical\r\n  chief. Among the Kirghiz Kazaks again, who profess Mahomedanism,\r\n  the word also survives, but conveys among them just the idea that\r\n  Polo seems to have associated with it, that of a mere conjuror or\r\n  “medicine-man”; whilst in Western Turkestan it has come to mean a\r\n  Bard.\r\n\r\n  The word Bakhshi has, however, wandered much further from its\r\n  original meaning. From its association with persons who could read\r\n  and write, and who therefore occasionally acted as clerks, it\r\n  came in Persia to mean a clerk or secretary. In the Petrarchian\r\n  Vocabulary, published by Klaproth, we find _scriba_ rendered\r\n  in _Comanian_, _i.e._ Turkish of the Crimea, by _Bacsi_. The\r\n  transfer of meaning is precisely parallel to that in regard to\r\n  our _Clerk_. Under the Mahomedan sovereigns of India, _Bakhshi_ was\r\n  applied to an officer performing something like the duties of a\r\n  quartermaster-general; and finally, in our Indian army, it has\r\n  come to mean a paymaster. In the latter sense, I imagine it has\r\n  got associated in the popular mind with the Persian _bakhshídan_,\r\n  to bestow, and _bakhshísh_. (See a note in _Q. R._ p. 184 _seqq._;\r\n  _Cathay_, p. 474; _Ayeen Akbery_, III. 150; _Pallas, Samml._ II.\r\n  126; _Levchine_, p. 355; _Klap. Mém._ III.; _Vámbéry, Sketches_, p.\r\n  81.)\r\n\r\n  The sketch from the life, on p. 326, of a wandering Tibetan\r\n  devotee, whom I met once at Hardwár, may give an idea of the sordid\r\n  _Bacsis_ spoken of by Polo.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 11.—This feat is related more briefly by Odoric: “And jugglers\r\n  cause cups of gold full of good wine to fly through the air, and\r\n  to offer themselves to all who list to drink.” (_Cathay_, p. 143.)\r\n  In the note on that passage I have referred to a somewhat similar\r\n  story in the _Life of Apollonius_. “Such feats,” says Mr. Jaeschke,\r\n  “are often mentioned in ancient as well as modern legends of Buddha\r\n  and other saints; and our Lamas have heard of things very similar\r\n  performed by conjuring _Bonpos_.” (See p. 323.) The moving of\r\n  cups and the like is one of the sorceries ascribed in old legends\r\n  to Simon Magus: “He made statues to walk; leapt into the fire\r\n  without being burnt; flew in the air; made bread of stones; changed\r\n  his shape; assumed two faces at once; converted himself into a\r\n  pillar; caused closed doors to fly open spontaneously; made the\r\n  vessels in a house seem to move of themselves,” etc. The Jesuit\r\n  Delrio laments that credulous princes, otherwise of pious repute,\r\n  should have allowed diabolic tricks to be played before them, “as,\r\n  for example, things of iron, and silver goblets, or other heavy\r\n  articles, to be moved by bounds from one end of a table to the\r\n  other, without the use of a magnet or of any attachment.” The pious\r\n  prince appears to have been Charles IX., and the conjuror a certain\r\n  Cesare Maltesio. Another Jesuit author describes the veritable\r\n  mango-trick, speaking of persons who “within three hours’ space did\r\n  cause a genuine shrub of a span in length to grow out of the table,\r\n  besides other trees that produced both leaves and fruit.”\r\n\r\n  In a letter dated 1st December, 1875, written by Mr. R. B. Shaw,\r\n  after his last return from Kashgar and Lahore, this distinguished\r\n  traveller says: “I have heard stories related regarding a Buddhist\r\n  high priest whose temple is said to be not far to the east of\r\n  Lanchau, which reminds me of Marco Polo and Kúblái Khan. This high\r\n  priest is said to have the magic power of attracting cups and\r\n  plates to him from a distance, so that things fly through the air\r\n  into his hands.” (_MS. Note_.—H. Y.)\r\n\r\n  The profession and practice of exorcism and magic in general is\r\n  greatly more prominent in Lamaism or Tibetan Buddhism than in any\r\n  other known form of that religion. Indeed, the old form of Lamaism\r\n  as it existed in our traveller’s day, and till the reforms of\r\n  Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), and as it is still professed by the _Red_\r\n  sect in Tibet, seems to be a kind of compromise between Indian\r\n  Buddhism and the old indigenous Shamanism. Even the reformed\r\n  doctrine of the Yellow sect recognises an orthodox kind of magic,\r\n  which is due in great measure to the combination of Sivaism with\r\n  the Buddhist doctrines, and of which the institutes are contained\r\n  in the vast collection of the _Jud_ or Tantras, recognised among\r\n  the holy books. The magic arts of this code open even a short\r\n  road to the Buddhahood itself. To attain that perfection of power\r\n  and wisdom, culminating in the cessation of sensible existence,\r\n  requires, according to the ordinary paths, a period of three\r\n  _asankhyas_ (or say Uncountable Time × 3), whereas by means of\r\n  the magic arts of the _Tantras_ it may be reached in the course\r\n  of three _rebirths_ only, nay, of one! But from the Tantras also\r\n  can be learned how to acquire miraculous powers for objects\r\n  entirely selfish and secular, and how to exercise these by means of\r\n  _Dhárani_ or mystic Indian charms.\r\n\r\n  Still the orthodox Yellow Lamas professedly repudiate and despise\r\n  the grosser exhibitions of common magic and charlatanism which\r\n  the Reds still practise, such as knife-swallowing, blowing fire,\r\n  cutting off their own heads, etc. But as the vulgar will not\r\n  dispense with these marvels, every great orthodox monastery in\r\n  Tibet _keeps a conjuror_, who is a member of the unreformed, and\r\n  does not belong to the brotherhood of the convent, but lives in\r\n  a particular part of it, bearing the name of _Choichong_, or\r\n  protector of religion, and is allowed to marry. The magic of these\r\n  Choichong is in theory and practice different from the orthodox\r\n  Tantrist magic. The practitioners possess no literature, and hand\r\n  down their mysteries only by tradition. Their fantastic equipments,\r\n  their frantic bearing, and their cries and howls, seem to identify\r\n  them with the grossest Shamanist devil dancers.\r\n\r\n  Sanang Setzen enumerates a variety of the wonderful acts which\r\n  could be performed through the _Dhárani_. Such were, sticking a peg\r\n  into solid rock; restoring the dead to life; turning a dead body\r\n  into gold; penetrating everywhere as air does; flying; catching\r\n  wild beasts with the hand; reading thoughts; making water flow\r\n  backwards; eating tiles; sitting in the air with the legs doubled\r\n  under, etc. Some of these are precisely the powers ascribed to\r\n  Medea, Empedocles, and Simon Magus, in passages already cited.\r\n  Friar Ricold says on this subject: “There are certain men whom the\r\n  Tartars honour above all in the world, viz. the _Baxitae_ (_i.e._\r\n  _Bakhshis_), who are a kind of idol-priests. These are men from\r\n  India, persons of deep wisdom, well-conducted, and of the gravest\r\n  morals. They are usually acquainted with magic arts, and depend on\r\n  the counsel and aid of demons; they exhibit many illusions, and\r\n  predict some future events. For instance, one of eminence among\r\n  them was said to fly; the truth, however, was (as it proved), that\r\n  he did not fly, but did walk close to the surface of the ground\r\n  without touching it; and _would seem to sit down without having any\r\n  substance to support him_.” This last performance was witnessed by\r\n  Ibn Batuta at Delhi, in the presence of Sultan Mahomed Tughlak;\r\n  and it was professedly exhibited by a Brahmin at Madras in the\r\n  present century, a descendant doubtless of those Brahmans whom\r\n  Apollonius saw walking two cubits from the ground. It is also\r\n  described by the worthy Francis Valentyn as a performance known and\r\n  practised in his own day in India. It is related, he says, that “a\r\n  man will first go and sit on three sticks put together so as to\r\n  form a tripod; after which, first one stick, then a second, then\r\n  the third shall be removed from under him, and the man shall not\r\n  fall but shall still remain sitting in the air! Yet I have spoken\r\n  with two friends who had seen this at one and the same time; and\r\n  one of them, I may add, mistrusting his own eyes, had taken the\r\n  trouble to feel about with a long stick if there were nothing on\r\n  which the body rested; yet, as the gentleman told me, he could\r\n  neither feel nor see any such thing. Still, I could only say that I\r\n  could not believe it, as a thing too manifestly contrary to reason.”\r\n\r\n  Akin to these performances, though exhibited by professed jugglers\r\n  without claim to religious character, is a class of feats which\r\n  might be regarded as simply inventions if told by one author\r\n  only, but which seem to deserve prominent notice from their being\r\n  recounted by a series of authors, certainly independent of one\r\n  another, and writing at long intervals of time and place. Our\r\n  first witness is Ibn Batuta, and it will be necessary to quote\r\n  him as well as the others in full, in order to show how closely\r\n  their evidence tallies. The Arab Traveller was present at a great\r\n  entertainment at the Court of the Viceroy of Khansa (_Kinsay_ of\r\n  Polo, or Hang-chau fu): “That same night a juggler, who was one of\r\n  the Kán’s slaves, made his appearance, and the Amír said to him,\r\n  ‘Come and show us some of your marvels.’ Upon this he took a wooden\r\n  ball, with several holes in it, through which long thongs were\r\n  passed, and, laying hold of one of these, slung it into the air.\r\n  It went so high that we lost sight of it altogether. (It was the\r\n  hottest season of the year, and we were outside in the middle of\r\n  the palace court.) There now remained only a little of the end of\r\n  a thong in the conjuror’s hand, and he desired one of the boys who\r\n  assisted him to lay hold of it and mount. He did so, climbing by\r\n  the thong, and we lost sight of him also! The conjuror then called\r\n  to him three times, but getting no answer, he snatched up a knife\r\n  as if in a great rage, laid hold of the thong, and disappeared\r\n  also! By and bye he threw down one of the boy’s hands, then a foot,\r\n  then the other hand, and then the other foot, then the trunk, and\r\n  last of all the head! Then he came down himself, all puffing and\r\n  panting, and with his clothes all bloody, kissed the ground before\r\n  the Amír, and said something to him in Chinese. The Amír gave some\r\n  order in reply, and our friend then took the lad’s limbs, laid them\r\n  together in their places, and gave a kick, when, presto! there\r\n  was the boy, who got up and stood before us! All this astonished\r\n  me beyond measure, and I had an attack of palpitation like that\r\n  which overcame me once before in the presence of the Sultan of\r\n  India, when he showed me something of the same kind. They gave me a\r\n  cordial, however, which cured the attack. The Kazi Afkharuddin was\r\n  next to me, and quoth he, ‘_Wallah!_ ’tis my opinion there has been\r\n  neither going up nor coming down, neither marring nor mending; ’tis\r\n  all hocus pocus!’”\r\n\r\n  Now let us compare with this, which Ibn Batuta the Moor says he\r\n  saw in China about the year 1348, the account which is given us\r\n  by Edward Melton, an Anglo-Dutch traveller, of the performances\r\n  of a Chinese gang of conjurors, which he witnessed at Batavia\r\n  about the year 1670 (I have forgotten to note the year). After\r\n  describing very vividly the _basket-murder_ trick, which is well\r\n  known in India, and now also in Europe, and some feats of bamboo\r\n  balancing similar to those which were recently shown by Japanese\r\n  performers in England, only more wonderful, he proceeds: “But now\r\n  I am going to relate a thing which surpasses all belief, and which\r\n  I should scarcely venture to insert here had it not been witnessed\r\n  by thousands before my own eyes. One of the same gang took a ball\r\n  of cord, and grasping one end of the cord in his hand slung the\r\n  other up into the air with such force that its extremity was beyond\r\n  reach of our sight. He then immediately climbed up the cord with\r\n  indescribable swiftness, and got so high that we could no longer\r\n  see him. I stood full of astonishment, not conceiving what was to\r\n  come of this; when lo! a leg came tumbling down out of the air.\r\n  One of the conjuring company instantly snatched it up and threw it\r\n  into the basket whereof I have formerly spoken. A moment later a\r\n  hand came down, and immediately on that another leg. And in short\r\n  all the members of the body came thus successively tumbling from\r\n  the air and were cast together into the basket. The last fragment\r\n  of all that we saw tumble down was the head, and no sooner had that\r\n  touched the ground than he who had snatched up all the limbs and\r\n  put them in the basket turned them all out again topsy-turvy. Then\r\n  straightway we saw with these eyes all those limbs creep together\r\n  again, and in short, form a whole man, who at once could stand\r\n  and go just as before, without showing the least damage! Never\r\n  in my life was I so astonished as when I beheld this wonderful\r\n  performance, and I doubted now no longer that these misguided\r\n  men did it by the help of the Devil. For it seems to me totally\r\n  impossible that such things should be accomplished by natural\r\n  means.” The same performance is spoken of by Valentyn, in a passage\r\n  also containing curious notices of the basket-murder trick, the\r\n  mango trick, the sitting in the air (quoted above), and others; but\r\n  he refers to Melton, and I am not sure whether he had any other\r\n  authority for it. The cut on this page is taken from Melton’s plate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Chinese Conjuring Extraordinary.]\r\n\r\n  Again we have in the Memoirs of the Emperor Jahángir a detail\r\n  of the wonderful performances of seven jugglers from Bengal who\r\n  exhibited before him. Two of their feats are thus described:\r\n  “_Ninth_. They produced a man whom they divided limb from limb,\r\n  actually severing his head from the body. They scattered these\r\n  mutilated members along the ground, and in this state they lay for\r\n  some time. They then extended a sheet or curtain over the spot, and\r\n  one of the men putting himself under the sheet, in a few minutes\r\n  came from below, followed by the individual supposed to have been\r\n  cut into joints, in perfect health and condition, and one might\r\n  have safely sworn that he had never received wound or injury\r\n  whatever ... _Twenty-third_. They produced a chain of 50 cubits in\r\n  length, and in my presence threw one end of it towards the sky,\r\n  _where it remained as if fastened to something in the air_. A dog\r\n  was then brought forward, and being placed at the lower end of the\r\n  chain, immediately ran up, and reaching the other end, _immediately\r\n  disappeared in the air_. In the same manner a hog, a panther, a\r\n  lion, and a tiger were successively sent up the chain, and all\r\n  equally disappeared at the upper end of the chain. At last they\r\n  took down the chain and put it into a bag, no one ever discovering\r\n  in what way the different animals were made to vanish into the air\r\n  in the mysterious manner above described.”\r\n\r\n  [There would appear (says the _Times of India_, quoted by the\r\n  _Weekly Dispatch_, 15th September, 1889) to be a fine field of\r\n  unworked romance in the annals of Indian jugglery. One Siddeshur\r\n  Mitter, writing to the Calcutta paper, gives a thrilling account\r\n  of a conjurer’s feat which he witnessed recently in one of the\r\n  villages of the Hooghly district. He saw the whole thing himself,\r\n  he tells us, so there need be no question about the facts. On the\r\n  particular afternoon when he visited the village the place was\r\n  occupied by a company of male and female jugglers, armed with\r\n  bags and boxes and musical instruments, and all the mysterious\r\n  paraphernalia of the peripatetic _Jadugar_. While Siddeshur was\r\n  looking on, and in the broad, clear light of the afternoon, a man\r\n  was shut up in a box, which was then carefully nailed up and bound\r\n  with cords. Weird spells and incantations of the style we are\r\n  all familiar with were followed by the breaking open of the box,\r\n  which, “to the unqualified amazement of everybody, was found to be\r\n  perfectly empty.” All this is much in the usual style; but what\r\n  followed was so much superior to the ordinary run of modern Indian\r\n  jugglery that we must give it in the simple Siddeshur’s own words.\r\n  When every one was satisfied that the man had really disappeared,\r\n  the principal performer, who did not seem to be at all astonished,\r\n  told his audience that the vanished man had gone up to the heavens\r\n  to fight Indra. “In a few moments,” says Siddeshur, “he expressed\r\n  anxiety at the man’s continued absence in the aerial regions, and\r\n  said that he would go up to see what was the matter. A boy was\r\n  called, who held upright a long bamboo, up which the man climbed\r\n  to the top, whereupon we suddenly lost sight of him, and the boy\r\n  laid the bamboo on the ground. Then there fell on the ground before\r\n  us the different members of a human body, all bloody,—first one\r\n  hand, then another, a foot, and so on, until complete. The boy then\r\n  elevated the bamboo, and the principal performer, appearing on\r\n  the top as suddenly as he had disappeared, came down, and seeming\r\n  quite disconsolate, said that Indra had killed his friend before\r\n  he could get there to save him. He then placed the mangled remains\r\n  in the same box, closed it, and tied it as before. Our wonder and\r\n  astonishment reached their climax when, a few minutes later, on the\r\n  box being again opened, the man jumped out perfectly hearty and\r\n  unhurt.” Is not this rather a severe strain on one’s credulity,\r\n  even for an Indian jugglery story?]\r\n\r\n  In Philostratus, again, we may learn the antiquity of some juggling\r\n  tricks that have come up as novelties in our own day. Thus at\r\n  Taxila a man set his son against a board, and then threw darts\r\n  tracing the outline of the boy’s figure on the board. This feat was\r\n  shown in London some fifteen or twenty years ago, and humorously\r\n  commemorated in _Punch_ by John Leech.\r\n\r\n  (_Philostratus_, Fr. Transl. Bk.

The Lamas enjoyed a preponderating\r\n  influence, and stood much higher than the priests of other creeds,\r\n  living in the palace as if in their own house. The perfumes, which\r\n  M. Polo mentions, were used by the Lamas for two purposes; they\r\n  used them for joss-sticks, and for making small turrets, known\r\n  under the name of _ts’a-ts’a_; the joss-sticks used to be burned\r\n  in the same way as they are now; the _ts’a-ts’a_ were inserted in\r\n  _suburgas_ or buried in the ground. At the time when the _suburga_\r\n  was built in the garden of the Peking palace in 1271, there were\r\n  used, according to the Empress’ wish, 1008 turrets made of the\r\n  most expensive perfumes, mixed with pounded gold, silver, pearls,\r\n  and corals, and 130,000 _ts’a-ts’a_ made of ordinary perfumes.”\r\n  (_Palladius_, 29.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 13.—There is no exaggeration in this number. Turner speaks\r\n  of 2500 monks in one Tibetan convent.

The missionary itinerary from Nepal to L’hasa given by\r\n  Giorgi, speaks of a group of convents at a place called Brephung,\r\n  which formerly contained 10,000 inmates, and at the time of the\r\n  journey (about 1700) still contained 5000, including attendants.\r\n  Dr. Campbell gives a list of twelve chief convents in L’hasa and\r\n  its vicinity (not including the Potala or Residence of the Grand\r\n  Lama), of which one is said to have 7500 members, resident and\r\n  itinerary. Major Montgomerie’s Pandit gives the same convent 7700\r\n  Lamas. In the great monastery at L’hasa called _Labrang_, they\r\n  show a copper kettle holding more than 100 buckets, which was\r\n  used to make tea for the Lamas who performed the daily temple\r\n  service. The monasteries are usually, as the text says, like small\r\n  towns, clustered round the great temples. That represented at p.\r\n  224 is at Jehol, and is an imitation of the Potala at L’hasa.\r\n  (_Huc’s Tartary_, _etc._, pp. 45, 208, etc.; _Alph. Tibetan_, 453;\r\n  _J. A. S. B._ XXIV. 219; _J. R.

Norzunov;\r\n  it is interesting to compare it with the view given by Kircher in\r\n  1670.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [“The monasteries with numbers of monks, who, as M. Polo asserts,\r\n  behaved decently, evidently belonged to Chinese Buddhists,\r\n  _ho-shang_; in Kúblái’s time they had two monasteries in Shangtu,\r\n  in the north-east and north-west parts of the town.” (_Palladius_,\r\n  29.) Rubruck (_Rockhill’s_ ed. p. 145) says: “All the priests\r\n  (of the idolaters) shave their heads, and are dressed in saffron\r\n  colour, and they observe chastity from the time they shave their\r\n  heads, and they live in congregations of one or two hundred.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 14.—There were many anomalies in the older Lamaism, and it\r\n  permitted, at least in some sects of it which still subsist, the\r\n  marriage of the clergy under certain limitations and conditions.\r\n  One of Giorgi’s missionaries speaks of a Lama of high _hereditary_\r\n  rank as a spiritual prince who marries, but separates from his\r\n  wife as soon as he has a son, who after certain trials is deemed\r\n  worthy to be his successor. [“A good number of Lamas were married,\r\n  as M. Polo correctly remarks; their wives were known amongst the\r\n  Chinese, under the name of _Fan-sao_.” (_Ch’ue keng lu_, quoted by\r\n  _Palladius_, 28.)—H. C.] One of the “_reforms_” of Tsongkhapa was\r\n  the absolute prohibition of marriage to the clergy, and in this\r\n  he followed the institutes of the oldest Buddhism. Even the _Red\r\n  Lamas_, or unreformed, cannot now marry without a dispensation.\r\n\r\n  But even the oldest orthodox Buddhism had its Lay brethren and Lay\r\n  sisters (_Upásaka_ and _Upásiká_), and these are to be found in\r\n  Tibet and Mongolia (_Voués au blanc_, as it were). They are called\r\n  by the Mongols, by a corruption of the Sanskrit, _Ubashi_ and\r\n  _Ubashanza_. Their vows extend to the strict keeping of the five\r\n  great commandments of the Buddhist Law, and they diligently ply the\r\n  rosary and the prayer-wheel, but they are not pledged to celibacy,\r\n  nor do they adopt the tonsure. As a sign of their amphibious\r\n  position, they commonly wear a red or yellow girdle. These are what\r\n  some travellers speak of as the lowest order of Lamas, permitted to\r\n  marry; and Polo may have regarded them in the same light.\r\n\r\n  (_Koeppen_, II. 82, 113, 276, 291; _Timk._ II. 354; _Erman_, II.\r\n  304; _Alph.

C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 16.—Marco’s contempt for _Patarins_ slips out in a later\r\n  passage (Bk. III. ch. xx.). The name originated in the eleventh\r\n  century in Lombardy, where it came to be applied to the “heretics,”\r\n  otherwise called “Cathari.” Muratori has much on the origin of the\r\n  name Patarini, and mentions a monument, which still exists, in\r\n  the Piazza de’ Mercanti at Milan, in honour of Oldrado Podestà of\r\n  that city in 1233, and which thus, with more pith than grammar,\r\n  celebrates his meritorious acts:—\r\n\r\n      “Qui solium struxit Catharos _ut debuit_ UXIT.”\r\n\r\n  Other cities were as piously Catholic. A Mantuan chronicler records\r\n  under 1276: “Captum fuit Sermionum seu redditum fuit Ecclesiæ, et\r\n  capti fuerunt cercha CL Patarini contra fidem, inter masculos et\r\n  feminas; qui omnes ducti fuerunt Veronam, et ibi incarcerati, _et\r\n  pro magna parte_ COMBUSTI.” (_Murat. Dissert._ III. 238; _Archiv.\r\n  Stor. Ital._ N.S. I. 49.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 17.—Marsden, followed by Pauthier, supposes these unorthodox\r\n  ascetics to be Hindu Sanyasis, and the latter editor supposes even\r\n  the name _Sensi_ or _Sensin_ to represent that denomination. Such\r\n  wanderers do occasionally find their way to Tartary; Gerbillon\r\n  mentions having encountered five of them at Kuku Khotan (_supra_,\r\n  p. 286), and I think John Bell speaks of meeting one still further\r\n  north. But what is said of the great and numerous idols of the\r\n  _Sensin_ is inconsistent with such a notion, as is indeed, it seems\r\n  to me, the whole scope of the passage. Evidently no occasional\r\n  vagabonds from a far country, but some indigenous sectaries, are\r\n  in question. Nor would bran and hot water be a Hindu regimen.\r\n  The staple diet of the Tibetans is _Chamba_, the meal of toasted\r\n  barley, mixed sometimes with warm water, but more frequently with\r\n  hot tea, and I think it is probable that these were the elements\r\n  of the ascetic diet rather than the mere _bran_ which Polo speaks\r\n  of. Semedo indeed says that some of the Buddhist devotees professed\r\n  never to take any food but tea; knowing people said they mixed\r\n  with it pellets of sun-dried beef. The determination of the sect\r\n  intended in the text is, I conceive, to be sought in the history of\r\n  Chinese or Tibetan Buddhism and their rivals.\r\n\r\n  Both Baldelli and Neumann have indicated a general opinion that\r\n  the _Taossé_ or some branch of that sect is meant, but they have\r\n  entered into no particulars except in a reference by the former to\r\n  _Shien-sien_, a title of perfection affected by that sect, as the\r\n  origin of Polo’s term _Sensin_. In the substance of this I think\r\n  they are right. But I believe that in the text this Chinese sect\r\n  are, rightly or wrongly, identified with the ancient Tibetan sect\r\n  of _Bon-po_, and that part of the characters assigned belong to\r\n  each.\r\n\r\n  First with regard to the _Taossé_. These were evidently the\r\n  _Patarini_ of the Buddhists in China at this time, and Polo was\r\n  probably aware of the persecution which the latter had stirred up\r\n  Kúblái to direct against them in 1281—persecution at least it is\r\n  called, though it was but a mild proceeding in comparison with the\r\n  thing contemporaneously practised in Christian Lombardy, for in\r\n  heathen Cathay, books, and not human creatures, were the subjects\r\n  doomed to burn, and even that doom was not carried out.\r\n\r\n  [“The Tao-sze,” says M. Polo, “were looked upon as heretics by\r\n  the other sects; that is, of course, by the Lamas and Ho-shangs;\r\n  in fact in his time a passionate struggle was going on between\r\n  Buddhists and Tao-sze, or rather a persecution of the latter by the\r\n  former; the Buddhists attributed to the doctrine of the Tao-sze a\r\n  pernicious tendency, and accused them of deceit; and in support\r\n  of these assertions they pointed to some of their sacred books.\r\n  Taking advantage of their influence at Court, they persuaded Kúblái\r\n  to decree the burning of these books, and it was carried out in\r\n  Peking.” (_Palladius_, 30.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The term which Polo writes as _Sensin_ appears to have been that\r\n  popularly applied to the Taossé sect at the Mongol Court. Thus we\r\n  are told by Rashíduddín in his History of Cathay: “In the reign\r\n  of Din-Wang, the 20th king of this (the 11th) Dynasty, TAI SHANG\r\n  LÁI KÚN, was born. This person is stated to have been accounted a\r\n  prophet by the people of Khitá; his father’s name was Hán; like\r\n  Shák-múni he is said to have been conceived by light, and it is\r\n  related that his mother bore him in her womb no less a period than\r\n  80 years. The people who embraced his doctrine were called شن شن\r\n  (_Shăn-shăn_ or _Shinshin_).” This is a correct epitome of the\r\n  Chinese story of _Laokiun_ or _Lao-tsé_, born in the reign of _Ting\r\n  Wang_ of the Cheu Dynasty. The whole title used by Rashíduddín,\r\n  _Tai Shang Lao Kiun_, “The Great Supreme Venerable Ruler,” is that\r\n  formerly applied by the Chinese to this philosopher.\r\n\r\n  Further, in a Mongol [and Chinese] inscription of the year 1314\r\n  from the department of Si-ngan fu, which has been interpreted and\r\n  published by Mr. Wylie, the Taossé priests are termed _Senshing_.\r\n  [See _Devéria, Notes d’Épigraphie_, pp. 39–43, and Prince _R.\r\n  Bonaparte’s Recueil_, Pl. xii. No. 3.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Seeing then that the very term used by Polo is that applied by both\r\n  Mongol and Persian authorities of the period to the Taossé, we can\r\n  have no doubt that the latter are indicated, whether the facts\r\n  stated about them be correct or not.\r\n\r\n  The word Senshing-ud (the Mongol plural) is represented in the\r\n  Chinese version of Mr. Wylie’s inscription by _Sín-săng_, a\r\n  conventional title applied to literary men, and this perhaps is\r\n  sufficient to determine the Chinese word which _Sensin_ represents.\r\n  I should otherwise have supposed it to be the _Shin-sian_ alluded\r\n  to by Baldelli, and mentioned in the quotations which follow;\r\n  and indeed it seems highly probable that two terms so much alike\r\n  should have been confounded by foreigners. Semedo says of the\r\n  Taossé: “They pretend that by means of certain exercises and\r\n  meditations one shall regain his youth, and others shall attain to\r\n  be _Shien-sien_, _i.e._ ‘Terrestrial Beati,’ in whose state every\r\n  desire is gratified, whilst they have the power to transport\r\n  themselves from one place to another, however distant, with speed\r\n  and facility.” Schott, on the same subject, says: “By _Sian_ or\r\n  _Shin-sian_ are understood in the old Chinese conception, and\r\n  particularly in that of the Tao-Kiao [or Taossé] sect, persons\r\n  who withdraw to the hills to lead the life of anchorites, and who\r\n  have attained, either through their ascetic observances or by the\r\n  power of charms and elixirs, to the possession of miraculous gifts\r\n  and of terrestrial immortality.” And M. Pauthier himself, in his\r\n  translation of the Journey of Khieu, an eminent doctor of this\r\n  sect, to the camp of the Great Chinghiz in Turkestan, has related\r\n  how Chinghiz bestowed upon this personage “a seal with a tiger’s\r\n  head and a diploma” (surely a lion’s head, _P’aizah_ and _Yarligh_;\r\n  see _infra_, Bk. II. ch. vii. note 2), “wherein he was styled _Shin\r\n  Sien_ or Divine Anchorite.” _Sian-jin_ again is the word used by\r\n  Hiuen Tsang as the equivalent to the name of the Indian _Rishis_,\r\n  who attain to supernatural powers.\r\n\r\n  [“_Sensin_ is a sufficiently faithful transcription of _Sien-seng_\r\n  (Sien-shing in Pekingese); the name given by the Mongols in\r\n  conversation as well as in official documents, to the Tao-sze,\r\n  in the sense of preceptors, just as Lamas were called by them\r\n  _Bacshi_, which corresponds to the Chinese _Sien-seng_. M. Polo\r\n  calls them fasters and ascetics. It was one of the sects of\r\n  Taouism. There was another one which practised cabalistic and other\r\n  mysteries. The Tao-sze had two monasteries in Shangtu, one in the\r\n  eastern, the other in the western part of the town.” (_Palladius_,\r\n  30.) —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  One class of the Tao priests or devotees does marry, but another\r\n  class never does. Many of them lead a wandering life, and\r\n  derive a precarious subsistence from the sale of charms and\r\n  medical nostrums. They shave the sides of the head, and coil the\r\n  remaining hair in a tuft on the crown, in the ancient Chinese\r\n  manner; moreover, says Williams, they “_are recognised by their\r\n  slate-coloured robes_.” On the feast of one of their divinities\r\n  whose title Williams translates as “High Emperor of the Sombre\r\n  Heavens,” they assemble before his temple, “and having made a\r\n  great fire, about 15 or 20 feet in diameter, go over it barefoot,\r\n  preceded by the priests and bearing the gods in their arms. They\r\n  firmly assert that if they possess a sincere mind they will not\r\n  be injured by the fire; but both priests and people get miserably\r\n  burnt on these occasions.” Escayrac de Lauture says that on those\r\n  days they leap, dance, and whirl round the fire, striking at the\r\n  devils with a straight Roman-like sword, and sometimes wounding\r\n  themselves as the priests of Baal and Moloch used to do.\r\n\r\n  (_Astley_, IV. 671; _Morley_ in _J.

Boudd._ II. 370, and III. 468.)\r\n\r\n  Let us now turn to the _Bon-po_. Of this form of religion and\r\n  its sectaries not much is known, for it is now confined to the\r\n  eastern and least known part of Tibet. It is, however, believed\r\n  to be a remnant of the old pre-Buddhistic worship of the powers\r\n  of nature, though much modified by the Buddhistic worship with\r\n  which it has so long been in contact. Mr. Hodgson also pronounces\r\n  a collection of drawings of Bonpo divinities, which were made for\r\n  him by a mendicant friar of the sect from the neighbourhood of\r\n  Tachindu, or Ta-t’sien-lu, to be saturated with _Sakta_ attributes,\r\n  _i.e._ with the spirit of the Tantrika worship, a worship which he\r\n  tersely defines as “a mixture of lust, ferocity, and mummery,”\r\n  and which he believes to have originated in an incorporation with\r\n  the Indian religions of the rude superstitions of the primitive\r\n  Turanians. Mr. Hodgson was told that the Bonpo sect still possessed\r\n  numerous and wealthy Vihars (or abbeys) in Tibet. But from the\r\n  information of the Catholic missionaries in Eastern Tibet, who\r\n  have come into closest contact with the sect, it appears to be now\r\n  in a state of great decadence, “oppressed by the Lamas of other\r\n  sects, the _Peunbo_ (Bonpo) think only of shaking off the yoke,\r\n  and getting deliverance from the vexations which the smallness of\r\n  their number forces them to endure.” In June, 1863, apparently\r\n  from such despairing motives, the Lamas of Tsodam, a Bonpo convent\r\n  in the vicinity of the mission settlement of Bonga in E. Tibet,\r\n  invited the Rev. Gabriel Durand to come and instruct them. “In\r\n  this temple,” he writes, “are the _monstrous idols_ of the sect\r\n  of Peunbo; horrid figures, whose features only Satan could have\r\n  inspired. They are disposed about the enclosure according to their\r\n  power and their seniority. Above the pagoda is a loft, the nooks\r\n  of which are crammed with all kinds of diabolical trumpery; little\r\n  idols of wood or copper, hideous masques of men and animals,\r\n  superstitious Lama vestments, drums, trumpets of human bones,\r\n  sacrificial vessels, in short, all the utensils with which the\r\n  devil’s servants in Tibet honour their master. And what will\r\n  become of it all? The Great River, whose waves roll to Martaban\r\n  (the Lu-kiang or Salwen), is not more than 200 or 300 paces\r\n  distant.... Besides the infernal paintings on the walls, eight\r\n  or nine monstrous idols, seated at the inner end of the pagoda,\r\n  were calculated by their size and aspect to inspire awe. In the\r\n  middle was _Tamba-Shi-Rob_, the great doctor of the sect of the\r\n  Peunbo, squatted with his right arm outside his red scarf, and\r\n  holding in his left the vase of knowledge.... On his right hand\r\n  sat _Keumta-Zon-bo_, ‘the All-Good,’ ... with ten hands and three\r\n  heads, one over the other.... At his right is _Dreuma_, the most\r\n  celebrated goddess of the sect. On the left of Tamba-Shi-Rob was\r\n  another goddess, whose name they never could tell me. On the left\r\n  again of this anonymous goddess appeared _Tam-pla-mi-ber_, ...\r\n  a monstrous dwarf environed by flames and his head garnished\r\n  with a diadem of skulls. _He trod with one foot on the head of\r\n  Shakia-tupa_ [_Shakya Thubba_, _i.e._ ‘the Mighty Shakya,’ the usual\r\n  Tibetan appellation of Sakya Buddha himself].... The idols are made\r\n  of a coarse composition of mud and stalks kneaded together, on\r\n  which they put first a coat of plaster and then various colours, or\r\n  even silver or gold.... _Four oxen would scarcely have been able to\r\n  draw one of the idols_.” Mr. Emilius Schlagintweit, in a paper on\r\n  the subject of this sect, has explained some of the names used by\r\n  the missionary. _Tamba-Shi-Rob_ is “_bs_tanpa _g_Shen-rabs,” _i.e._\r\n  the doctrine of Shen-rabs, who is regarded as the founder of the\r\n  Bon religion. [Cf. _Grenard_, II. 407.—H. C.] _Keun-tu-zon-bo_ is\r\n  “Kun-tu-_b_zang-po,” “_the All Best_.”\r\n\r\n  [_Bon-po_ seems to be (according to Grenard, II. 410) a “coarse\r\n  naturism combined with ancestral worship” resembling Taoism. It\r\n  has, however, borrowed a good deal from Buddhism. “I noticed,”\r\n  says Mr. Rockhill (_Journey_, 86), “a couple of grimy volumes\r\n  of Bönbo sacred literature. One of them I examined; it was a\r\n  funeral service, and was in the usual Bönbo jargon, three-fourths\r\n  Buddhistic in its nomenclature.” The Bon-po Lamas are above all\r\n  sorcerers and necromancers, and are very similar to the _kam_\r\n  of the Northern Turks, the _bô_ of the Mongols, and lastly to\r\n  the _Shamans_. During their operations, they wear a tall pointed\r\n  black hat, surmounted by the feather of a peacock, or of a cock,\r\n  and a human skull. Their principal divinities are the White God\r\n  of Heaven, the Black Goddess of Earth, the Red Tiger and the\r\n  Dragon; they worship an idol called _Kye’-p’ang_ formed of a mere\r\n  block of wood covered with garments. Their sacred symbol is the\r\n  _svastika_ turned from right to left 卍. The most important of\r\n  their monasteries is Zo-chen gum-pa, in the north-east of Tibet,\r\n  where they print most of their books. The Bonpos Lamas “are very\r\n  popular with the agricultural Tibetans, but not so much so with the\r\n  pastoral tribes, who nearly all belong to the Gélupa sect of the\r\n  orthodox Buddhist Church.” A. K. says, “Buddhism is the religion of\r\n  the country; there are two sects, one named Mangba and the other\r\n  Chiba or Baimbu.” _Explorations made by A—— K——_, 34. _Mangba_ means\r\n  “Esoteric,” _Chiba_ (_p’yi-ba_), “Exoteric,” and _Baimbu_ is Bönbo.\r\n  _Rockhill, Journey_, 289, _et passim.; Land of the Lamas_, 217–218;\r\n  _Grenard, Mission Scientifique_, II. 407 _seqq._—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  There is an indication in Koeppen’s references that the followers\r\n  of the _Bon_ doctrine are sometimes called in Tibet _Nag-choi_,\r\n  or “Black Sect,” as the old and the reformed Lamas are called\r\n  respectively the “Red” and the “Yellow.” If so, it is reasonable\r\n  to conclude that the first appellation, like the two last, has a\r\n  reference to the colour of clothing affected by the priesthood.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Mr. Jaeschke writes from Lahaul: “There are no Bonpos in\r\n  our part of the country, and as far as we know there cannot be many\r\n  of them in the whole of Western Tibet, _i.e._ in Ladak, Spiti, and\r\n  all the non-Chinese provinces together; we know, therefore, not\r\n  much more of them than has been made known to the European public\r\n  by different writers on Buddhism in Tibet, and lately collected\r\n  by Emil de Schlagintweit.... Whether they can be with certainty\r\n  identified with the Chinese _Taossé_ I cannot decide, as I don’t\r\n  know if anything like historical evidence about their Chinese\r\n  origin has been detected anywhere, or if it is merely a conclusion\r\n  from the similarity of their doctrines and practices.... But the\r\n  Chinese author of the _Wei-tsang-tu-Shi_, translated by Klaproth,\r\n  under the title of _Description du Tubet_ (Paris, 1831), renders\r\n  _Bonpo_ by _Taossé_. So much seems to be certain that it was the\r\n  ancient religion of Tibet, before Buddhism penetrated into the\r\n  country, and that even at later periods it several times gained the\r\n  ascendancy when the secular power was of a disposition averse to\r\n  the Lamaitic hierarchy. Another opinion is that the Bon religion\r\n  was originally a mere fetishism, and related to or identical with\r\n  Shamanism; this appears to me very probable and easy to reconcile\r\n  with the former supposition, for it may afterwards, on becoming\r\n  acquainted with the Chinese doctrine of the ‘Taossé,’ have adorned\r\n  itself with many of its tenets.... With regard to the following\r\n  particulars, I have got most of my information from our Lama, a\r\n  native of the neighbourhood of Tashi Lhunpo, whom we consulted\r\n  about all your questions. The extraordinary asceticism which\r\n  struck Marco Polo so much is of course not to be understood as\r\n  being practised by all members of the sect, but exclusively, or\r\n  more especially, by the _priests_. That these _never_ marry, and\r\n  are consequently more strictly celibatary than many sects of the\r\n  Lamaitic priesthood, was confirmed by our Lama.” (Mr. Jaeschke then\r\n  remarks upon the _bran_ to much the same effect as I have done\r\n  above.) “The Bonpos are by all Buddhists regarded as heretics.\r\n  Though they worship idols partly the same, at least in name, with\r\n  those of the Buddhists, ... their rites seem to be very different.\r\n  The most conspicuous and most generally known of their customs,\r\n  futile in itself, but in the eyes of the common people the greatest\r\n  sign of their sinful heresy, is that they perform the religious\r\n  ceremony of making a turn round a sacred object _in the opposite\r\n  direction_ to that prescribed by Buddhism. As to their dress, our\r\n  Lama said that they had no particular colour of garments, but their\r\n  priests frequently wore red clothes, as some sects of the Buddhist\r\n  priesthood do. Mr. Heyde, however, once on a journey in our\r\n  neighbouring county of Langskar, saw a man _clothed in black with\r\n  blue borders_, who the people said was a _Bonpo_.”\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Journey _, 63) saw at Kao miao-tzŭ “a _red_-gowned,\r\n  long-haired Bönbo Lama,” and at Kumbum (p. 68), “was surprised to\r\n  see quite a large number of Bönbo Lamas, recognisable by their\r\n  huge mops of hair and their _red_ gowns, and also from their being\r\n  dirtier than the ordinary run of people.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The identity of the Bonpo and Taossé seems to have been accepted by\r\n  Csoma de Körös, who identifies the Chinese founder of the latter,\r\n  Lao-tseu, with the Shen-rabs of the Tibetan Bonpos. Klaproth\r\n  also says, “Bhonbp’o, Bhanpo, and _Shen_, are the names by which\r\n  are commonly designated (in Tibetan) the Taoszu, or followers of\r\n  the Chinese philosopher Laotseu.”[11] Schlagintweit refers to\r\n  Schmidt’s Tibetan Grammar (p. 209) and to the Calcutta edition of\r\n  the _Fo-kouè-ki_ (p. 218) for the like identification, but I do\r\n  not know how far any two of these are independent testimonies.\r\n  General Cunningham, however, fully accepts the identity, and\r\n  writes to me: “Fahian (ch. xxiii.) calls the heretics who\r\n  assembled at Râmagrâma _Taossé_,[12] thus identifying them with\r\n  the Chinese Finitimists. The Taossé are, therefore, the same as\r\n  the _Swâstikas_, or worshippers of the mystic cross _Swasti_,\r\n  who are also _Tirthakaras_, or ‘Pure-doers.’ The synonymous word\r\n  _Punya_ is probably the origin of _Pon_ or _Bon_, the Tibetan\r\n  Finitimists. From the same word comes the Burmese _P’ungyi_ or\r\n  _Pungi_.” I may add that the Chinese envoy to Cambodia in 1296,\r\n  whose narrative Rémusat has translated, describes a sect which he\r\n  encountered there, apparently Brahminical, as _Taossé_. And even\r\n  if the Bonpo and the Taossé were not fundamentally identical, it\r\n  is extremely probable that the Tibetan and Mongol Buddhists should\r\n  have applied to them one name and character. Each played towards\r\n  them the same part in Tibet and in China respectively; both were\r\n  heretic sects and hated rivals; both made high pretensions to\r\n  asceticism and supernatural powers; both, I think we see reason\r\n  to believe, affected the dark clothing which Polo assigns to the\r\n  _Sensin_; both, we may add, had “great idols and plenty of them.”\r\n  We have seen in the account of the Taossé the ground that certain\r\n  of their ceremonies afford for the allegation that they “sometimes\r\n  also worship fire,” whilst the whole account of that rite and of\r\n  others mentioned by Duhalde,[13] shows what a powerful element of\r\n  the old devil-dancing Shamanism there is in their practice. The\r\n  French Jesuit, on the other hand, shows us what a prominent place\r\n  female divinities occupied in the Bon-po Pantheon,[14] though we\r\n  cannot say of either sect that “their idols are all feminine.” A\r\n  strong symptom of relation between the two religions, by the way,\r\n  occurs in M. Durand’s account of the Bon Temple. We see there that\r\n  _Shen-rabs_, the great doctor of the sect, occupies a chief and\r\n  central place among the idols. Now in the Chinese temples of the\r\n  Taossé the figure of _their_ Doctor _Lao-tseu_ is one member of\r\n  the triad called the “Three Pure Ones,” which constitute the chief\r\n  objects of worship.

Text\r\n  explains it as both _blue_ and _white_. _Raynouard’s Romance Dict._\r\n  explains _Bloi_ as “Blond.” Ramusio has _biave_, and I have no\r\n  doubt that _blue_ is the meaning. The same word (_bloie_) is used\r\n  in the G. Text, where Polo speaks of the bright colours of the\r\n  Palace tiles at Cambaluc, and where Pauthier’s text has “_vermeil\r\n  et jaune et vert_ et blou,” and again (_infra_, Bk. II. ch. xix.),\r\n  where the two corps of huntsmen are said to be clad respectively in\r\n  _vermeil_ and in _bloie_. Here, again, Pauthier’s text has _bleu_.\r\n  The Crusca in the description of the _Sensin_ omits the colours\r\n  altogether; in the two other passages referred to it has _bioda,\r\n  biodo_.\r\n\r\n  [“The Tao-sze, says Marco Polo, wear dresses of black and blue\r\n  linen; _i.e._ they wear dresses made of tatters of black and blue\r\n  linen, as can be seen also at the present day.” (_Palladius_,\r\n  30.)—H.

The Tao-sze\r\n  have, besides these, a good number of male divinities, bearing\r\n  the title of _Kiun_ in common with female divinities; both\r\n  these circumstances might have led Marco Polo to make the above\r\n  statement.” (_Palladius_, p. 30.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] This distance is taken from a tracing of the map prepared for Dr.\r\n    Bushell’s paper quoted below. But there is a serious discrepancy\r\n    between this tracing and the observed position of Dolon-nor, which\r\n    determines that of Shang-tu, as stated to me in a letter from Dr.\r\n    Bushell. [See Note 1.]\r\n\r\n[2] These particulars were obtained by Dr. Bushell through the\r\n    Archimandrite Palladius, from the MS. account of a Chinese\r\n    traveller who visited Shangtu about two hundred years ago, when\r\n    probably the whole inscription was above ground. The inscription is\r\n    also mentioned in the Imp. Geography of the present Dynasty, quoted\r\n    by Klaproth. This work gives the interior wall 5 _li_ to the side,\r\n    instead of 2 _li_, and the outer wall 10 _li_, instead of 4 _li_.\r\n    By Dr. Bushell’s kindness, I give a reduction of his sketch plan\r\n    (see _Itinerary Map_, No. IV. at end of this volume), and also a\r\n    plate of the heading of the inscription. The translation of this\r\n    is: “Monument conferred by the Emperor of the August Yuen (Dynasty)\r\n    in memory of His High Eminence Yun Hien (styled) Chang-Lao\r\n    (canonised as) Shou-Kung (Prince of Longevity).” [See _Missions de\r\n    Chine et du Congo_, No. 28, Mars, 1891, Bruxelles.]\r\n\r\n[3] Ramusio’s version runs thus: “The palace presents one side to the\r\n    centre of the city and the other to the city wall. And from either\r\n    extremity of the palace where it touches the city wall, there runs\r\n    another wall, which fetches a compass and encloses a good 16 miles\r\n    of plain, and so that no one can enter this enclosure except by\r\n    passing through the palace.”\r\n\r\n[4] This narrative, translated from Chinese into Russian by Father\r\n    Palladius, and from the Russian into English by Mr. Eugene\r\n    Schuyler, Secretary of the U.S. Legation at St. Petersburg, was\r\n    obligingly sent to me by the latter gentleman, and appeared in the\r\n    _Geographical Magazine_ for January, 1875, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[5] See Bk. II. chap. xiv. note 3.\r\n\r\n[6] In the first edition I had supposed a derivation of the Persian\r\n    words _Jádú_ and _Jádúgari_, used commonly in India for conjuring,\r\n    from the Tartar use of _Yadah_. And Pallas says the Kirghiz call\r\n    their witches _Jádugar_. (_Voy._ II. 298.) But I am assured by Sir\r\n    H. Rawlinson that this etymology is more than doubtful, and that at\r\n    any rate the Persian (_Jádú_) is probably older than the Turkish\r\n    term. I see that M. Pavet de Courteille derives _Yadah_ from a\r\n    Mongol word signifying “change of weather,” etc.\r\n\r\n[7] [See W. Foerster’s ed., _Halle_, 1887, p. 15, 386.—H.

The _Saktián_, or Tantrists, according\r\n    to the Dabistan, hold that the worship of a female divinity affords\r\n    a greater recompense.

And of a surety he hath good right to such\r\na title, for all men know for a certain truth that he is the most\r\npotent man, as regards forces and lands and treasure, that existeth in\r\nthe world, or ever hath existed from the time of our First Father Adam\r\nuntil this day. All this I will make clear to you for truth, in this\r\nbook of ours, so that every one shall be fain to acknowledge that he is\r\nthe greatest Lord that is now in the world, or ever hath been. And now\r\nye shall hear how and wherefore.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—According to Sanang Setzen, Chinghiz himself discerned\r\n  young Kúblái’s superiority. On his deathbed he said: “The words of\r\n  the lad Kúblái are well worth attention; see, all of you, that ye\r\n  heed what he says! One day he will sit in my seat and bring you\r\n  good fortune such as you have had in my day!” (p. 105).\r\n\r\n  The Persian history of Wassáf thus exalts Kúblái: “Although from\r\n  the frontiers of this country (’Irák) to the Centre of Empire,\r\n  the Focus of the Universe, the genial abode of the ever-Fortunate\r\n  Emperor and Just Kaan, is a whole year’s journey, yet the stories\r\n  that have been spread abroad, even in these parts, of his glorious\r\n  deeds, his institutes, his decisions, his justice, the largeness\r\n  and acuteness of his intellect, his correctness of judgment,\r\n  his great powers of administration, from the mouths of credible\r\n  witnesses, of well-known merchants and eminent travellers, are\r\n  so surpassing, that one beam of his glories, one fraction of his\r\n  great qualities, suffices to eclipse all that history tells of\r\n  the Cæsars of Rome, of the Chosroes of Persia, of the Khagans of\r\n  China, of the (Himyarite) Kails of Arabia, of the Tobbas of Yemen,\r\n  and the Rajas of India, of the monarchs of the houses of Sassan and\r\n  Búya, and of the Seljukian Sultans.” (_Hammer’s Wassaf_, orig. p.\r\n  37.)\r\n\r\n  Some remarks on Kúblái and his government by a Chinese author, in\r\n  a more rational and discriminative tone, will be found below under\r\n  ch. xxiii., note 2.\r\n\r\n  A curious Low-German MS. at Cologne, giving an account of the East,\r\n  says of the “Keyser von Kathagien—syn recht Name is der groisse\r\n  _Hunt!_” (Magnus Canis, the Big Bow-wow as it were. See _Orient und\r\n  Occident_, vol. i. p. 640.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n         CONCERNING THE REVOLT OF NAYAN, WHO WAS UNCLE TO THE\r\n                          GREAT KAAN CUBLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this Cublay Kaan is of the right Imperial lineage, being descended\r\nfrom Chinghis Kaan, the first sovereign of all the Tartars. And he is\r\nthe sixth Lord in that succession, as I have already told you in this\r\nbook. He came to the throne in the year of Christ, 1256, and the Empire\r\nfell to him because of his ability and valour and great worth, as was\r\nright and reason.{1} His brothers, indeed, and other kinsmen disputed\r\nhis claim, but his it remained, both because maintained by his great\r\nvalour, and because it was in law and right his, as being directly\r\nsprung of the imperial line.\r\n\r\nUp to the year of Christ now running, to wit 1298, he hath reigned\r\ntwo-and-forty years, and his age is about eighty-five, so that he must\r\nhave been about forty-three years of age when he first came to the\r\nthrone.{2} Before that time he had often been to the wars, and had\r\nshown himself a gallant soldier and an excellent captain. But after\r\ncoming to the throne he never went to the wars in person save once.{3}\r\nThis befel in the year of Christ, 1286, and I will tell you why he went.\r\n\r\nThere was a great Tartar Chief, whose name was NAYAN,{4} a young man\r\n[of thirty], Lord over many lands and many provinces; and he was Uncle\r\nto the Emperor Cublay Kaan of whom we are speaking. And when he found\r\nhimself in authority this Nayan waxed proud in the insolence of his\r\nyouth and his great power; for indeed he could bring into the field\r\n300,000 horsemen, though all the time he was liegeman to his nephew,\r\nthe Great Kaan Cublay, as was right and reason. Seeing then what great\r\npower he had, he took it into his head that he would be the Great\r\nKaan’s vassal no longer; nay more, he would fain wrest his empire from\r\nhim if he could. So this Nayan sent envoys to another Tartar Prince\r\ncalled CAIDU, also a great and potent Lord, who was a kinsman of his,\r\nand who was a nephew of the Great Kaan and his lawful liegeman also,\r\nthough he was in rebellion and at bitter enmity with his sovereign Lord\r\nand Uncle. Now the message that Nayan sent was this: That he himself\r\nwas making ready to march against the Great Kaan with all his forces\r\n(which were great), and he begged Caidu to do likewise from his side,\r\nso that by attacking Cublay on two sides at once with such great forces\r\nthey would be able to wrest his dominion from him.\r\n\r\nAnd when Caidu heard the message of Nayan, he was right glad thereat,\r\nand thought the time was come at last to gain his object. So he sent\r\nback answer that he would do as requested; and got ready his host,\r\nwhich mustered a good hundred thousand horsemen.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the Great Kaan, who had news of all this plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—There is no doubt that Kúblái was proclaimed Kaan in 1260\r\n  (4th month), his brother Mangku Kaan having perished during the\r\n  seige of Hochau in Szechwan in August of the preceding year. But\r\n  Kúblái had come into Cathay some years before as his brother’s\r\n  Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n  He was the _fifth_, not sixth, Supreme Kaan, as we have already\r\n  noticed. (Bk. I. ch. li. note 2.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Kúblái was born in the eighth month of the year\r\n  corresponding to 1216, and had he lived to 1298 would have been\r\n  eighty-two years old. [According to Dr. E. Bretschneider (_Peking_,\r\n  30), quoting the _Yuen-Shi_, Kúblái died at Khanbaligh, in the\r\n  Tze-t’an tien in February, 1294.—H. C.] But by Mahomedan reckoning\r\n  he would have been close upon eighty-five. He was the fourth son of\r\n  Tuli, who was the youngest of Chinghiz’s four sons by his favourite\r\n  wife Burté Fujin. (See _De Mailla_, IX. 255, etc.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This is not literally true; for soon after his accession\r\n  (in 1261) Kúblái led an army against his brother and rival\r\n  Arikbuga, and defeated him. And again in his old age, if we credit\r\n  the Chinese annalist, in 1289, when his grandson Kanmala (or\r\n  Kambala) was beaten on the northern frontier by Kaidu, Kúblái took\r\n  the field himself, though on his approach the rebels disappeared.\r\n\r\n  Kúblái and his brother Hulaku, young as they were, commenced their\r\n  military career on Chinghiz’s last expedition (1226–1227). His most\r\n  notable campaign was the conquest of Yunnan in 1253–1254. (_De\r\n  Mailla_, IX. 298, 441.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—NAYAN was no “uncle” of Kúblái’s, but a cousin in a junior\r\n  generation. For Kúblái was the grandson of Chinghiz, and Nayan was\r\n  the great-great-grandson of Chinghiz’s brother Uchegin, called in\r\n  the Chinese annals Pilgutai. [Belgutai was Chinghiz’s step-brother.\r\n  (_Palladius_.)—H. C.] On this brother, the great-uncle of Kúblái,\r\n  and the commander of the latter’s forces against Arikbuga in the\r\n  beginning of the reign, both Chinghiz and Kúblái had bestowed large\r\n  territories in Eastern Tartary towards the frontier of Corea, and\r\n  north of Liaotong towards the Manchu country. [“The situation\r\n  and limits of his appanage are not clearly defined in history.\r\n  According to Belgutai’s biography, it was between the Onon and\r\n  Kerulen (_Yuen shi_), and according to Shin Yao’s researches (_Lo\r\n  fung low wen kao_), at the confluence of the Argun and Shilka.\r\n  Finally, according to Harabadur’s biography, it was situated in\r\n  Abalahu, which geographically and etymologically corresponds to\r\n  modern Butkha (_Yuen shi_); Abalahu, as Kúblái himself said, was\r\n  rich in fish; indeed, after the suppression of Nayan’s rebellion,\r\n  the governor of that country used to send to the Peking Court\r\n  fishes weighing up to a thousand Chinese pounds (_kin_.). It was\r\n  evidently a country near the Amur River.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._\r\n  31.)—H. C.] Nayan had added to his inherited territory, and become\r\n  very powerful. [“History has apparently connected Nayan’s appanage\r\n  with that of Hatan (a grandson of Hachiun, brother of Chinghiz\r\n  Khan), whose _ordo_ was contiguous to Nayan’s, on the left bank of\r\n  the Amur, hypothetically east of Blagovietschensk, on the spot,\r\n  where still the traces of an ancient city can be seen. Nayan’s\r\n  possessions stretched south to Kwang-ning, which belonged to his\r\n  appanage, and it was from this town that he had the title of prince\r\n  of Kwang-ning (_Yuen shi_).” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ 31.)—H. C.] Kaidu\r\n  had gained influence over Nayan, and persuaded him to rise against\r\n  Kúblái. A number of the other Mongol princes took part with him.\r\n  Kúblái was much disquieted at the rumours, and sent his great\r\n  lieutenant BAYAN to reconnoitre. Bayan was nearly captured, but\r\n  escaped to court and reported to his master the great armament that\r\n  Nayan was preparing. Kúblái succeeded by diplomacy in detaching\r\n  some of the princes from the enterprise, and resolved to march in\r\n  person to the scene of action, whilst despatching Bayan to the\r\n  Karakorum frontier to intercept Kaidu. This was in the summer of\r\n  1287. What followed will be found in a subsequent note (ch. iv.\r\n  note 6). (For Nayan’s descent, see the Genealogical Table in the\r\n  Appendix (A).)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n               HOW THE GREAT KAAN MARCHED AGAINST NAYAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Great Kaan heard what was afoot, he made his preparations in\r\nright good heart, like one who feared not the issue of an attempt so\r\ncontrary to justice. Confident in his own conduct and prowess, he was\r\nin no degree disturbed, but vowed that he would never wear crown again\r\nif he brought not those two traitorous and disloyal Tartar chiefs to\r\nan ill end. So swiftly and secretly were his preparations made, that\r\nno one knew of them but his Privy Council, and all were completed\r\nwithin ten or twelve days. In that time he had assembled good 360,000\r\nhorsemen, and 100,000 footmen,—but a small force indeed for him, and\r\nconsisting only of those that were in the vicinity. For the rest of\r\nhis vast and innumerable forces were too far off to answer so hasty a\r\nsummons, being engaged under orders from him on distant expeditions to\r\nconquer divers countries and provinces. If he had waited to summon all\r\nhis troops, the multitude assembled would have been beyond all belief,\r\na multitude such as never was heard of or told of, past all counting.\r\nIn fact, those 360,000 horsemen that he got together consisted merely\r\nof the falconers and whippers-in that were about the court!{1}\r\n\r\nAnd when he had got ready this handful (as it were) of his troops,\r\nhe ordered his astrologers to declare whether he should gain the\r\nbattle and get the better of his enemies. After they had made their\r\nobservations, they told him to go on boldly, for he would conquer and\r\ngain a glorious victory: whereat he greatly rejoiced.\r\n\r\nSo he marched with his army, and after advancing for 20 days they\r\narrived at a great plain where Nayan lay with all his host, amounting\r\nto some 400,000 horse. Now the Great Kaan’s forces arrived so fast and\r\nso suddenly that the others knew nothing of the matter. For the Kaan\r\nhad caused such strict watch to be made in every direction for scouts\r\nthat every one that appeared was instantly captured. Thus Nayan had no\r\nwarning of his coming and was completely taken by surprise; insomuch\r\nthat when the Great Kaan’s army came up, he was asleep in the arms of a\r\nwife of his of whom he was extravagantly fond. So thus you see why it\r\nwas that the Emperor equipped his force with such speed and secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—I am afraid Marco, in his desire to impress on his\r\n  readers the great power of the Kaan, is here giving the reins to\r\n  exaggeration on a great scale.\r\n\r\n  Ramusio has here the following explanatory addition:—“You must know\r\n  that in all the Provinces of Cathay and Mangi, and throughout the\r\n  Great Kaan’s dominions, there are too many disloyal folk ready to\r\n  break into rebellion against their Lord, and hence it is needful\r\n  in every province containing large cities and much population, to\r\n  maintain garrisons. These are stationed four or five miles from\r\n  the cities, and the latter are not allowed to have walls or gates\r\n  by which they might obstruct the entrance of the troops at their\r\n  pleasure. These garrisons as well as their commanders the Great\r\n  Kaan causes to be relieved every two years; and bridled in this way\r\n  the people are kept quiet, and can make no disturbance. The troops\r\n  are maintained not only by the pay which the Kaan regularly assigns\r\n  from the revenues of each province, but also by the vast quantities\r\n  of cattle which they keep, and by the sale of milk in the cities,\r\n  which furnishes the means of buying what they require. They are\r\n  scattered among their different stations, at distances of 30, 40,\r\n  or 60 days (from the capital); and had Cublay decided to summon but\r\n  the half of them, the number would have been incredible,” etc.\r\n\r\n  [Palladius says (p. 37) that in the Mongol-Chinese documents, the\r\n  Mongol garrisons cantoned near the Chinese towns are mentioned\r\n  under the name of _Aolu_, but no explanation of the term is\r\n  given.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The system of controlling garrisons, quartered at a few miles from\r\n  the great cities, is that which the Chinese followed at Kashgar,\r\n  Yarkand, etc. It is, in fact, our own system in India, as at\r\n  Barrackpúr, Dinapúr, Sikandarábád, Mián Mír.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n         OF THE BATTLE THAT THE GREAT KAAN FOUGHT WITH NAYAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say about it? When day had well broken, there was the Kaan\r\nwith all his host upon a hill overlooking the plain where Nayan lay\r\nin his tent, in all security, without the slightest thought of any\r\none coming thither to do him hurt. In fact, this confidence of his was\r\nsuch that he kept no vedettes whether in front or in rear; for he knew\r\nnothing of the coming of the Great Kaan, owing to all the approaches\r\nhaving been completely occupied as I told you. Moreover, the place was\r\nin a remote wilderness, more than thirty marches from the Court, though\r\nthe Kaan had made the distance in twenty, so eager was he to come to\r\nbattle with Nayan.\r\n\r\nAnd what shall I tell you next? The Kaan was there on the hill, mounted\r\non a great wooden bartizan,{1} which was borne by four well-trained\r\nelephants, and over him was hoisted his standard, so high aloft that\r\nit could be seen from all sides. His troops were ordered in battles\r\nof 30,000 men apiece; and a great part of the horsemen had each a\r\nfoot-soldier armed with a lance set on the crupper behind him (for it\r\nwas thus that the footmen were disposed of);{2} and the whole plain\r\nseemed to be covered with his forces. So it was thus that the Great\r\nKaan’s army was arrayed for battle.\r\n\r\nWhen Nayan and his people saw what had happened, they were sorely\r\nconfounded, and rushed in haste to arms. Nevertheless they made them\r\nready in good style and formed their troops in an orderly manner. And\r\nwhen all were in battle array on both sides as I have told you, and\r\nnothing remained but to fall to blows, then might you have heard a\r\nsound arise of many instruments of various music, and of the voices\r\nof the whole of the two hosts loudly singing. For this is a custom of\r\nthe Tartars, that before they join battle they all unite in singing\r\nand playing on a certain two-stringed instrument of theirs, a thing\r\nright pleasant to hear. And so they continue in their array of battle,\r\nsinging and playing in this pleasing manner, until the great Naccara\r\nof the Prince is heard to sound. As soon as that begins to sound the\r\nfight also begins on both sides; and in no case before the Prince’s\r\nNaccara sounds dare any commence fighting.{3}\r\n\r\nSo then, as they were thus singing and playing, though ordered and\r\nready for battle, the great Naccara of the Great Khan began to sound.\r\nAnd that of Nayan also began to sound. And thenceforward the din of\r\nbattle began to be heard loudly from this side and from that. And they\r\nrushed to work so doughtily with their bows and their maces, with their\r\nlances and swords, and with the arblasts of the footmen, that it was\r\na wondrous sight to see. Now might you behold such flights of arrows\r\nfrom this side and from that, that the whole heaven was canopied with\r\nthem and they fell like rain. Now might you see on this side and on\r\nthat full many a cavalier and man-at-arms fall slain, insomuch that\r\nthe whole field seemed covered with them. From this side and from that\r\nsuch cries arose from the crowds of the wounded and dying that had God\r\nthundered, you would not have heard Him! For fierce and furious was the\r\nbattle, and quarter there was none given.{4}\r\n\r\nBut why should I make a long story of it? You must know that it was\r\nthe most parlous and fierce and fearful battle that ever has been\r\nfought in our day. Nor have there ever been such forces in the field\r\nin actual fight, especially of horsemen, as were then engaged—for,\r\ntaking both sides, there were not fewer than 760,000 horsemen, a mighty\r\nforce! and that without reckoning the footmen, who were also very\r\nnumerous. The battle endured with various fortune on this side and on\r\nthat from morning till noon. But at the last, by God’s pleasure and\r\nthe right that was on his side, the Great Khan had the victory, and\r\nNayan lost the battle and was utterly routed. For the army of the\r\nGreat Kaan performed such feats of arms that Nayan and his host could\r\nstand against them no longer, so they turned and fled. But this availed\r\nnothing for Nayan; for he and all the barons with him were taken\r\nprisoners, and had to surrender to the Kaan with all their arms.\r\n\r\nNow you must know that Nayan was a baptized Christian, and bore the\r\ncross on his banner; but this nought availed him, seeing how grievously\r\nhe had done amiss in rebelling against his Lord. For he was the Great\r\nKaan’s liegeman,{5} and was bound to hold his lands of him like all his\r\nancestors before him.{6}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“_Une grande_ bretesche.” _Bretesche, Bertisca_ (whence\r\n  old English _Brattice_, and _Bartizan_), was a term applied to\r\n  any boarded structure of defence or attack, but especially to\r\n  the timber parapets and roofs often placed on the top of the\r\n  flanking-towers in mediæval fortifications; and this use quite\r\n  explains the sort of structure here intended. The term and its\r\n  derivative _Bartizan_ came later to be applied to projecting\r\n  _guérites_ or watch-towers of masonry. _Brattice_ in English is\r\n  now applied to a fence round a pit or dangerous machinery.

Godefroy, Dict._)\r\n\r\n  [John Ranking (_Hist. Res. on the Wars and Sports of the Mongols\r\n  and Romans_) in a note regarding this battle writes (p. 60): “It\r\n  appears that it is an old custom in Persia, to use four elephants\r\n  a-breast.” The Senate decreed Gordian III. to represent him\r\n  triumphing after the Persian mode, with chariots drawn with four\r\n  elephants. _Augustan Hist._ vol. ii. p. 65.

He _may_ have taken it from Polo, as it is not in\r\n  Pauthier’s Chinese extracts; but Gaubil has other facts not noticed\r\n  in these.\r\n\r\n  [Elephants came from the Indo-Chinese Kingdoms, Burma, Siam,\r\n  Champa. —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The specification of the Tartar instrument of two strings\r\n  is peculiar to Pauthier’s texts. It was no doubt what Dr. Clarke\r\n  calls “the _balalaika_ or two-stringed lyre,” the most common\r\n  instrument among the Kalmaks.\r\n\r\n  The sounding of the Nakkára as the signal of action is an old\r\n  Pan-Asiatic custom, but I cannot find that this very striking\r\n  circumstance of the whole host of Tartars playing and singing in\r\n  chorus, when ordered for battle and waiting the signal from the\r\n  boom of the Big Drum, is mentioned by any other author.\r\n\r\n  The _Naḳḳárah_ or _Nagárah_ was a great kettledrum, formed\r\n  like a brazen caldron, tapering to the bottom and covered with\r\n  buffalo-hide—at least 3½ or 4 feet in diameter. Bernier, indeed,\r\n  tells of _Naḳḳáras_ in use at the Court of Delhi that were not\r\n  less than a fathom across; and Tod speaks of them in Rájpútána\r\n  as “about 8 or 10 feet in diameter.” The Tartar Naḳḳárahs were\r\n  usually, I presume, carried on a camel; but as Kúblái had begun to\r\n  use elephants, his may have been carried on an elephant, as is\r\n  sometimes the case in India. Thus, too, P. della Valle describes\r\n  those of an Indian Embassy at Ispahan: “The Indian Ambassador was\r\n  also accompanied by a variety of warlike instruments of music\r\n  of strange kinds, and particularly by certain Naccheras of such\r\n  immense size that each pair had an elephant to carry them, whilst\r\n  an Indian astride upon the elephant between the two Naccheras\r\n  played upon them with both hands, dealing strong blows on this one\r\n  and on that; what a din was made by these vast drums, and what a\r\n  spectacle it was, I leave you to imagine.”\r\n\r\n  Joinville also speaks of the Nakkara as the signal for action:\r\n  “So he was setting his host in array till noon, and then he made\r\n  those drums of theirs to sound that they call _Nacaires_, and\r\n  then they set upon us horse and foot.” The Great Nakkara of the\r\n  Tartars appears from several Oriental histories to have been called\r\n  _Ḳúrḳah_. I cannot find this word in any dictionary accessible to\r\n  me, but it is in the _Ain Akbari_ (_Kawargah_) as distinct from\r\n  the _Naḳḳárah_. Abulfazl tells us that Akbar not only had a rare\r\n  knowledge of the science of music, but was likewise an excellent\r\n  performer—especially on the _Naḳḳárah!_\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nakkaras. (From a Chinese original.)]\r\n\r\n  The privilege of employing the Nakkara in personal state was one\r\n  granted by the sovereign as a high honour and reward.\r\n\r\n  The crusades naturalised the word in some form or other in most\r\n  European languages, but in our own apparently with a transfer of\r\n  meaning. For Wright defines _Naker_ as “a cornet or horn of brass.”\r\n  And Chaucer’s use seems to countenance this:—\r\n\r\n      “Pipes, Trompes, Nakeres, and Clariounes,\r\n       That in the Bataille blowen blody sounes.”\r\n                                         —_The Knight’s Tale_.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, Nacchera, in Italian, seems always to have\r\n  retained the meaning of _kettle-drum_, with the slight exception of\r\n  a local application at Siena to a metal circle or triangle struck\r\n  with a rod. The fact seems to be that there is a double origin, for\r\n  the Arabic dictionaries not only have _Naḳḳárah_, but _Naḳír_ and\r\n  _Náḳúr_, “cornu, tuba.” The orchestra of Bibars Bunduḳdári, we are\r\n  told, consisted of 40 pairs of kettle-drums, 4 drums, 4 hautbois,\r\n  and 20 trumpets (_Naḳír_).

It is difficult to say whether the style\r\n  is borrowed from the historians of the East or the romancers of the\r\n  West. Compare the two following parallels. First from an Oriental\r\n  history:—\r\n\r\n  “The Ear of Heaven was deafened with the din of the great _Kurkahs_\r\n  and Drums, and the Earth shook at the clangour of the Trumpets and\r\n  Clarions.

The Sovereign, however, put on a bold\r\n  front, and though in great danger of being carried off, showed\r\n  no trepidation. It was night, and an urgent summons went to call\r\n  troops to the Emperor’s aid. They marched at once, the horsemen\r\n  taking the foot soldiers on the crupper behind them. Nayan all\r\n  this while was taking it quietly in his camp, and his generals did\r\n  not venture to attack the Emperor, suspecting an ambuscade. Liting\r\n  then took ten resolute men, and on approaching the General’s camp,\r\n  caused a Fire-_Pao_ to be discharged; the report caused a great\r\n  panic among Nayan’s troops, who were very ill disciplined at the\r\n  best. Meanwhile the Chinese and Tartar troops had all come up,\r\n  and Nayan was attacked on all sides: by Liting at the head of the\r\n  Chinese, by Yusitemur at the head of the Mongols, by Tutuha and\r\n  the Emperor in person at the head of his guards and the troops\r\n  of _Kincha_ (Kipchak). The presence of the Emperor rendered the\r\n  army invincible, and Nayan’s forces were completely defeated. That\r\n  prince himself was taken, and afterwards put to death. The battle\r\n  took place in the vicinity of the river Liao, and the Emperor\r\n  returned in triumph to Shangtu” (207). The Chinese record given in\r\n  detail by Pauthier is to the like effect, except as to the Kaan’s\r\n  narrow escape, of which it says nothing.\r\n\r\n  As regards the Fire-_Pao_ (the latter word seems to have been\r\n  applied to military machines formerly, and now to artillery), I\r\n  must refer to Favé and Reinaud’s very curious and interesting\r\n  treatise on the Greek fire (_du Feu Grégeois_). They do not seem\r\n  to assent to the view that the arms of this description which are\r\n  mentioned in the Mongol wars were cannon, but rather of the nature\r\n  of rockets.\r\n\r\n  [Dr. G. Schlegel (_T’oung Pao_, No. 1, 1902), in a paper entitled,\r\n  _On the Invention and Use of Fire-Arms and Gunpowder in China,\r\n  prior to the Arrival of Europeans_, says that “now, notwithstanding\r\n  all what has been alleged by different European authors against\r\n  the use of gunpowder and fire-arms in China, I maintain that not\r\n  only the Mongols in 1293 had cannon, but that they were already\r\n  acquainted with them in 1232.” Among his many examples, we quote\r\n  the following from the Books of the Ming Dynasty: “What were\r\n  anciently called _P’ao_ were all machines for hurling stones. In\r\n  the beginning of the Mongol Dynasty (A.D. 1260), _p’ao_ (catapults)\r\n  of the Western regions were procured. In the siege [in 1233] of the\r\n  city of _Ts’ai chow_ of the _Kin_ (Tatars), fire was for the first\r\n  time employed (in these _p’ao_), but the art of making them was not\r\n  handed down, and they were afterwards seldom used.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n          HOW THE GREAT KAAN CAUSED NAYAN TO BE PUT TO DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the Great Kaan learned that Nayan was taken right glad was\r\nhe, and commanded that he should be put to death straightway and in\r\nsecret, lest endeavours should be made to obtain pity and pardon for\r\nhim, because he was of the Kaan’s own flesh and blood. And this was the\r\nway in which he was put to death: he was wrapt in a carpet, and tossed\r\nto and fro so mercilessly that he died. And the Kaan caused him to be\r\nput to death in this way because he would not have the blood of his\r\nLine Imperial spilt upon the ground or exposed in the eye of Heaven and\r\nbefore the Sun.{1}\r\n\r\nAnd when the Great Kaan had gained this battle, as you have heard,\r\nall the Barons and people of Nayan’s provinces renewed their fealty\r\nto the Kaan. Now these provinces that had been under the Lordship of\r\nNayan were four in number; to wit, the first called CHORCHA; the second\r\nCAULY; the third BARSCOL; the fourth SIKINTINJU. Of all these four\r\ngreat provinces had Nayan been Lord; it was a very great dominion.{2}\r\n\r\nAnd after the Great Kaan had conquered Nayan, as you have heard, it\r\ncame to pass that the different kinds of people who were present,\r\nSaracens and Idolaters and Jews,{3} and many others that believed not\r\nin God, did gibe those that were Christians because of the cross that\r\nNayan had borne on his standard, and that so grievously that there\r\nwas no bearing it. Thus they would say to the Christians: “See now\r\nwhat precious help this God’s Cross of yours hath rendered Nayan, who\r\nwas a Christian and a worshipper thereof.” And such a din arose about\r\nthe matter that it reached the Great Kaan’s own ears. When it did so,\r\nhe sharply rebuked those who cast these gibes at the Christians; and\r\nhe also bade the Christians be of good heart, “for if the Cross had\r\nrendered no help to Nayan, in that It had done right well; nor could\r\nthat which was good, as It was, have done otherwise; for Nayan was a\r\ndisloyal and traitorous Rebel against his Lord, and well deserved that\r\nwhich had befallen him. Wherefore the Cross of your God did well in\r\nthat It gave him no help against the right.” And this he said so loud\r\nthat everybody heard him. The Christians then replied to the Great\r\nKaan: “Great King, you say the truth indeed, for our Cross can render\r\nno one help in wrong-doing; and therefore it was that It aided not\r\nNayan, who was guilty of crime and disloyalty, for It would take no\r\npart in his evil deeds.”\r\n\r\nAnd so thenceforward no more was heard of the floutings of the\r\nunbelievers against the Christians; for they heard very well what the\r\nSovereign said to the latter about the Cross on Nayan’s banner, and its\r\ngiving him no help.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Friar Ricold mentions this Tartar maxim: “One Khan will\r\n  put another to death, to get possession of the throne, but he\r\n  takes great care that the blood be not spilt. For they say that\r\n  it is highly improper that the blood of the Great Khan should be\r\n  spilt upon the ground; so they cause the victim to be smothered\r\n  somehow or other.” The like feeling prevails at the Court of Burma,\r\n  where a peculiar mode of execution without bloodshed is reserved\r\n  for Princes of the Blood. And Kaempfer, relating the conspiracy\r\n  of Faulcon at the Court of Siam, says that two of the king’s\r\n  brothers, accused of participation, were beaten to death with clubs\r\n  of sandal-wood, “for the respect entertained for the blood-royal\r\n  forbids its being shed.” See also note 6, ch. vi. Bk. I., on the\r\n  death of the Khalif Mosta’sim Billah. (_Pereg. Quat._ p. 115;\r\n  _Mission to Ava_, p. 229; _Kaempfer_, I. 19.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—CHORCHA is the Manchu country, Niuché of the Chinese.\r\n  (_Supra_, note 2, ch. xlvi. Bk. I.) [“Chorcha is Churchin.—Nayan, as\r\n  vassal of the Mongol khans, had the commission to keep in obedience\r\n  the people of Manchuria (subdued in 1233), and to care for the\r\n  security of the country (_Yuen shi_); there is no doubt that he\r\n  shared these obligations with his relative Hatan, who stood nearer\r\n  to the native tribes of Manchuria.” (_Palladius_, 32.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  KAULI is properly Corea, probably here a district on the frontier\r\n  thereof, as it is improbable that Nayan had any rule over Corea.\r\n  [“The Corean kingdom proper could not be a part of the prince’s\r\n  appanage. Marco Polo might mean the northern part of Corea, which\r\n  submitted to the Mongols in A.D. 1269, with sixty towns, and\r\n  which was subordinated entirely to the central administration\r\n  in Liao-yang. As to the southern part of Corea, it was left to\r\n  the king of Corea, who, however, was a vassal of the Mongols.”\r\n  (_Palladius_, 32.) The king of Corea (_Ko rye, Kao-li_) was in 1288\r\n  Chyoung ryel wang (1274–1298); the capital was Syong-to, now Kăi\r\n  syeng (K’ai-ch’eng).—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  BARSKUL, “Leopard-Lake,” is named in Sanang Setsen (p. 217), but\r\n  seems there to indicate some place in the west of Mongolia, perhaps\r\n  the _Barkul_ of our maps. This Barskul must have been on the Manchu\r\n  frontier. [There are in the _Yuen-shi_ the names of the department\r\n  of _P’u-yü-lu_, and of the place _Pu-lo-ho_, which, according to\r\n  the system of Chinese transcription, approach to Barscol; but it\r\n  is difficult to prove this identification, since our knowledge of\r\n  these places is very scanty; it only remains to identify Barscol\r\n  with Abalahu, which is already known; a conjecture all the more\r\n  probable as the two names of P’u-yü-lu and Pu-lo-ho have also some\r\n  resemblance to Abalahu. (_Palladius_, 32.) Mr. E. H. Parker says\r\n  (_China Review_, xviii. p. 261) that Barscol may be Pa-la ssŭ or\r\n  Bars Koto [in Tsetsen]. “This seems the more probable in that Cauly\r\n  and Chorcha are clearly proved to be Corea and Niuché or Manchuria,\r\n  so that Bars Koto would naturally fall within Nayan’s appanage.”\r\n  —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The reading of the fourth name is doubtful, _Sichuigiu_,\r\n  _Sichingiu_ (G. T.), _Sichin-tingiu_, etc. The Chinese name of\r\n  Mukden is _Shing-king_, but I know not if it be so old as our\r\n  author’s time. I think it very possible that the real reading\r\n  is _Sinchin-tingin_, and that it represents SHANGKING-TUNGKING,\r\n  expressing the two capitals of the Khitan Dynasty in this region,\r\n  the position of which will be found indicated in No. IV. map of\r\n  Polo’s itineraries. (See _Schott, Aelteste Nachrichten von Mongolen\r\n  und Tartaren_, Berlin Acad. 1845, pp. 11–12.)\r\n\r\n  [Sikintinju is Kien chau “belonging to a town which was in Nayan’s\r\n  appanage, and is mentioned in the history of his rebellion. There\r\n  were two Kien-chow, one in the time of the Kin in the modern aimak\r\n  of Khorchin; the other during the Mongol Dynasty, on the upper\r\n  part of the river Ta-ling ho, in the limits of the modern aimak\r\n  of Kharachin (_Man chow yuen lew k’ao_); the latter depended\r\n  on Kuang-ning (_Yuen-shi_). Mention is made of Kien-chow, in\r\n  connection with the following circumstance. When Nayan’s rebellion\r\n  broke out, the Court of Peking sent orders to the King of Corea,\r\n  requiring from him auxiliary troops; this circumstance is mentioned\r\n  in the Corean Annals, under the year 1288 (_Kao li shi_, ch. xxx.\r\n  f. 11) in the following words:—‘In the present year, in the fourth\r\n  month, orders were received from Peking to send five thousand men\r\n  with provisions to Kien-chow, which is 3000 _li_ distant from the\r\n  King’s residence.’ This number of _li_ cannot of course be taken\r\n  literally; judging by the distances estimated at the present\r\n  day, it was about 2000 _li_ from the Corean K’ai-ch’eng fu (then\r\n  the Corean capital) to the Mongol Kien-chow; and as much to the\r\n  Kien-chow of the Kin (through Mukden and the pass of Fa-k’u mun in\r\n  the willow palisade). It is difficult to decide to which of these\r\n  two cities of the same name the troops were ordered to go, but at\r\n  any rate, there are sufficient reasons to identify Sikintinju of\r\n  Marco Polo with Kien-chow.” (_Palladius_, 33.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We learn from Gaubil that the rebellion did not end with the\r\n  capture of Nayan. In the summer of 1288 several of the princes of\r\n  Nayan’s league, under Hatan (apparently the _Abkan_ of Erdmann’s\r\n  genealogies), the grandson of Chinghiz’s brother Kajyun [Hachiun],\r\n  threatened the provinces north-east of the wall. Kúblái sent his\r\n  grandson and designated heir, Teimur, against them, accompanied by\r\n  some of his best generals. After a two days’ fight on the banks\r\n  of the River Kweilei, the rebels were completely beaten. The\r\n  territories on the said River _Kweilei_, the _Tiro_, or _Torro_,\r\n  and the _Liao_, are mentioned both by Gaubil and De Mailla as among\r\n  those which had belonged to Nayan. As the Kweilei and Toro appear\r\n  on our maps and also the better-known Liao, we are thus enabled to\r\n  determine with tolerable precision Nayan’s country. (See _Gaubil_,\r\n  p. 209, and _De Mailla_, 431 _seqq._)\r\n\r\n  [“The rebellion of Nayan and Hatan is incompletely and\r\n  contradictorily related in Chinese history. The suppression of both\r\n  these rebellions lasted four years. In 1287 Nayan marched from his\r\n  _ordo_ with sixty thousand men through Eastern Mongolia. In the 5th\r\n  moon (_var._ 6th) of the same year Khubilai marched against him\r\n  from Shangtu. The battle was fought in South-Eastern Mongolia, and\r\n  gained by Khubilai, who returned to Shangtu in the 8th month. Nayan\r\n  fled to the south-east, across the mountain range, along which a\r\n  willow palisade now stands; but forces had been sent beforehand\r\n  from Shin-chow (modern Mukden) and Kuang-ning (probably to watch\r\n  the pass), and Nayan was made prisoner.\r\n\r\n  “Two months had not passed, when Hatan’s rebellion broke out\r\n  (so that it took place in the same year 1287). It is mentioned\r\n  under the year 1288, that Hatan was beaten, and that the whole of\r\n  Manchuria was pacified; but in 1290, it is again recorded that\r\n  Hatan disturbed Southern Manchuria, and that he was again defeated.\r\n  It is to this time that the narratives in the biographies of\r\n  Liting, Yuesi Femur, and Mangwu ought to be referred. According to\r\n  the first of these biographies, Hatan, after his defeat by Liting\r\n  on the river Kui lui (Kuilar?), fled, and perished. According to\r\n  the second biography, Hatan’s dwelling (on the Amur River) was\r\n  destroyed, and he disappeared. According to the third, Mangwu and\r\n  Naimatai pursued Hatan to the extreme north, up to the eastern\r\n  sea-coast (the mouth of the Amur). Hatan fled, but two of his\r\n  wives and his son Lao-ti were taken; the latter was executed, and\r\n  this was the concluding act of the suppression of the rebellion in\r\n  Manchuria. We find, however, an important _variante_ in the history\r\n  of Corea; it is stated there that in 1290, Hatan and his son Lao-ti\r\n  were carrying fire and slaughter to Corea, and devastated that\r\n  country; they slew the inhabitants and fed on human flesh. The\r\n  King of Corea fled to the Kiang-hwa island. The Coreans were not\r\n  able to withstand the invasion. The Mongols sent to their aid in\r\n  1291, troops under the command of two generals, Seshekan (who was\r\n  at that time governor of Liao-tung) and Namantai (evidently the\r\n  above-mentioned Naimatai). The Mongols conjointly with the Coreans\r\n  defeated the insurgents, who had penetrated into the very heart of\r\n  the country; their corpses covered a space 30 _li_ in extent; Hatan\r\n  and his son made their way through the victorious army and fled,\r\n  finding a refuge in the Niuchi (Djurdji) country, from which Laotai\r\n  made a later incursion into Corea. Such is the discrepancy between\r\n  historians in relating the same fact. The statement found in the\r\n  Corean history seems to me more reliable than the facts given by\r\n  Chinese history.” (_Palladius_, 35–37.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This passage, and the extract from Ramusio’s version\r\n  attached to the following chapter, contain the only allusions by\r\n  Marco to Jews in China. John of Monte Corvino alludes to them,\r\n  and so does Marignolli, who speaks of having held disputations\r\n  with them at Cambaluc; Ibn Batuta also speaks of them at Khansa or\r\n  Hangchau. Much has been written about the ancient settlement of\r\n  Jews at Kaifungfu, in Honan. One of the most interesting papers\r\n  on the subject is in the _Chinese Repository_, vol. xx. It gives\r\n  the translation of a Chinese-Jewish Inscription, which in some\r\n  respects forms a singular parallel to the celebrated Christian\r\n  Inscription of Si-ngan fu, though it is of far more modern date\r\n  (1511). It exhibits, as that inscription does, the effect of\r\n  Chinese temperament or language, in modifying or diluting doctrinal\r\n  statements. Here is a passage: “With respect to the Israelitish\r\n  religion, we find on inquiry that its first ancestor, Adam, came\r\n  originally from India, and that during the (period of the) Chau\r\n  State the Sacred Writings were already in existence. The Sacred\r\n  Writings, embodying Eternal Reason, consist of 53 sections. The\r\n  principles therein contained are very abstruse, and the Eternal\r\n  Reason therein revealed is very mysterious, being treated with the\r\n  same veneration as Heaven. The founder of the religion is Abraham,\r\n  who is considered the first teacher of it. Then came Moses, who\r\n  established the Law, and handed down the Sacred Writings. After his\r\n  time, during the Han Dynasty (B.C. 206 to A.D. 221), this religion\r\n  entered China. In (A.D.) 1164, a synagogue was built at P’ien. In\r\n  (A.D.) 1296, the old Temple was rebuilt, as a place in which the\r\n  Sacred Writings might be deposited with veneration.”\r\n\r\n  [According to their oral tradition, the Jews came to China from\r\n  _Si Yĭh_ (Western Regions), probably Persia, by Khorasan and\r\n  Samarkand, during the first century of our era, in the reign of\r\n  the Emperor Ming-ti (A.D. 58–75) of the Han Dynasty. They were at\r\n  times confounded with the followers of religions of India, _T’ien\r\n  Chu kiao_, and very often with the Mohammedans _Hwui-Hwui_ or\r\n  _Hwui-tzŭ_; the common name of their religion was _Tiao kin kiao_,\r\n  “Extract Sinew Religion.” However, three lapidary inscriptions,\r\n  kept at Kaï-fung, give different dates for the arrival of the Jews\r\n  in China: one dated 1489 (2nd year Hung Che, Ming Dynasty) says\r\n  that seventy Jewish families arrived at P’ien liang (Kaï-fung) at\r\n  the time of the Sung (A.D. 960–1278); one dated 1512 (7th year\r\n  Chêng Têh) says that the Jewish religion was introduced into China\r\n  under the Han Dynasty (B.C. 206–A.D. 221), and the last one dated\r\n  1663 (2nd year K’ang-hi) says that this religion was first preached\r\n  in China under the Chau Dynasty (B.C. 1122–255); this will not bear\r\n  discussion.\r\n\r\n  The synagogue, according to these inscriptions, was built in 1163,\r\n  under the Sung Emperor Hiao; under the Yuen, in 1279, the rabbi\r\n  rebuilt the ancient temple known as _Ts’ing Chen sse_, probably\r\n  on the site of a ruined mosque; the synagogue was rebuilt in 1421\r\n  during the reign of Yung-lo; it was destroyed by an inundation of\r\n  the Hwang-ho in 1642, and the Jews began to rebuild it once more in\r\n  1653.\r\n\r\n  The first knowledge Europeans had of a colony of Jews at K’aï-fung\r\n  fu, in the Ho-nan province, was obtained through the Jesuit\r\n  missionaries at Peking, at the beginning of the 17th century;\r\n  the celebrated Matteo Ricci having received the visit of a young\r\n  Jew, the Jesuits Aleni (1613), Gozani (1704), Gaubil and Domenge\r\n  who made in 1721 two plans of the synagogue, visited Kaï-fung\r\n  and brought back some documents. In 1850, a mission of enquiry\r\n  was sent to that place by the _London Society for promoting\r\n  Christianity among the Jews_; the results of this mission were\r\n  published at Shang-haï, in 1851, by Bishop G. Smith of Hongkong;\r\n  fac-similes of the Hebrew manuscripts obtained at the synagogue of\r\n  Kaï-fung were also printed at Shang-haï at the London Missionary\r\n  Society’s Press, in the same year. The Jewish merchants of London\r\n  sent in 1760 to their brethren of Kaï-fung a letter written in\r\n  Hebrew; a Jewish merchant of Vienna, J. L. Liebermann, visited the\r\n  Kaï-fung colony in 1867. At the time of the T’aï-P’ing rising,\r\n  the rebels marched against Kaï-fung in 1857, and with the rest of\r\n  the population, the Jews were dispersed. (_J. Tobar, Insc. juives\r\n  de Kaï-fong-fou_, 1900; _Henri Cordier_, _Les Juifs en Chine_,\r\n  and _Fung and Wagnall’s Jewish Encyclopedia_.) Palladius writes\r\n  (p. 38), “The Jews are mentioned for the first time in the _Yuen\r\n  shi_ (ch. xxxiii. p. 7), under the year 1329, on the occasion of\r\n  the re-establishment of the law for the collection of taxes from\r\n  dissidents. Mention of them is made again under the year 1354, ch.\r\n  xliii. fol. 10, when on account of several insurrections in China,\r\n  rich Mahommetans and Jews were invited to the capital in order to\r\n  join the army. In both cases they are named _Chu hu_ (Djuhud).”\r\n  —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The synagogue at Kaifungfu has recently been demolished for the\r\n  sake of its materials, by the survivors of the Jewish community\r\n  themselves, who were too poor to repair it. The tablet that\r\n  once adorned its entrance, bearing in gilt characters the name\r\n  ESZLOYIH (Israel), has been appropriated by a mosque. The 300 or\r\n  400 survivors seem in danger of absorption into the Mahomedan or\r\n  heathen population. The last Rabbi and possessor of the sacred\r\n  tongue died some thirty or forty years ago, the worship has ceased,\r\n  and their traditions have almost died away.\r\n\r\n  (_Cathay_, 225, 341, 497; _Ch. Rep._ XX. 436; _Dr. Martin_, in _J.\r\n  N. China Br. R. A. S._ 1866, pp. 32–33.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n         HOW THE GREAT KAAN WENT BACK TO THE CITY OF CAMBALUC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd after the Great Kaan had defeated Nayan in the way you have heard,\r\nhe went back to his capital city of Cambaluc and abode there, taking\r\nhis ease and making festivity. And the other Tartar Lord called Caydu\r\nwas greatly troubled when he heard of the defeat and death of Nayan,\r\nand held himself in readiness for war; but he stood greatly in fear of\r\nbeing handled as Nayan had been.{1}\r\n\r\nI told you that the Great Kaan never went on a campaign but once, and\r\nit was on this occasion; in all other cases of need he sent his sons\r\nor his barons into the field. But this time he would have none go in\r\ncommand but himself, for he regarded the presumptuous rebellion of\r\nNayan as far too serious and perilous an affair to be otherwise dealt\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Here Ramusio has a long and curious addition. Kúblái, it\r\n  says, remained at Cambaluc till March, “in which our Easter occurs;\r\n  and learning that this was one of our chief festivals, he summoned\r\n  all the Christians, and bade them bring with them the Book of\r\n  the Four Gospels. This he caused to be incensed many times with\r\n  great ceremony, kissing it himself most devoutly, and desiring\r\n  all the barons and lords who were present to do the same. And he\r\n  always acts in this fashion at the chief Christian festivals,\r\n  such as Easter and Christmas. And he does the like at the chief\r\n  feasts of the Saracens, Jews, and Idolaters. On being asked why,\r\n  he said: ‘There are Four Prophets worshipped and revered by all\r\n  the world. The Christians say their God is Jesus Christ; the\r\n  Saracens, Mahommet; the Jews, Moses; the Idolaters, Sogomon Borcan\r\n  [_Sakya-Muni Burkhan_ or Buddha], who was the first god among the\r\n  idols; and I worship and pay respect to all four, and pray that\r\n  he among them who is greatest in heaven in very truth may aid\r\n  me.’ But the Great Khan let it be seen well enough that he held\r\n  the Christian Faith to be the truest and best—for, as he says, it\r\n  commands nothing that is not perfectly good and holy. But he will\r\n  not allow the Christians to carry the Cross before them, because on\r\n  it was scourged and put to death a person so great and exalted as\r\n  Christ.\r\n\r\n  “Some one may say: ‘Since he holds the Christian faith to be best,\r\n  why does he not attach himself to it, and become a Christian?’\r\n  Well, this is the reason that he gave to Messer Nicolo and Messer\r\n  Maffeo, when he sent them as his envoys to the Pope, and when they\r\n  sometimes took occasion to speak to him about the faith of Christ.\r\n  He said: ‘How would you have me to become a Christian? You see that\r\n  the Christians of these parts are so ignorant that they achieve\r\n  nothing and can achieve nothing, whilst you see the Idolaters can\r\n  do anything they please, insomuch that when I sit at table the\r\n  cups from the middle of the hall come to me full of wine or other\r\n  liquor without being touched by anybody, and I drink from them.\r\n  They control storms, causing them to pass in whatever direction\r\n  they please, and do many other marvels; whilst, as you know, their\r\n  idols speak, and give them predictions on whatever subjects they\r\n  choose. But if I were to turn to the faith of Christ and become a\r\n  Christian, then my barons and others who are not converted would\r\n  say: “What has moved you to be baptised and to take up the faith of\r\n  Christ? What powers or miracles have you witnessed on His part?”\r\n  (You know the Idolaters here say that their wonders are performed\r\n  by the sanctity and power of their idols.) Well, I should not know\r\n  what answer to make; so they would only be confirmed in their\r\n  errors, and the Idolaters, who are adepts in such surprising arts,\r\n  would easily compass my death. But now you shall go to your Pope,\r\n  and pray him on my part to send hither an hundred men skilled in\r\n  your law, who shall be capable of rebuking the practices of the\r\n  Idolaters to their faces, and of telling them that they too know\r\n  how to do such things but will not, because they are done by the\r\n  help of the devil and other evil spirits, and shall so control the\r\n  Idolaters that these shall have no power to perform such things in\r\n  their presence. When we shall witness this we will denounce the\r\n  Idolaters and their religion, and then I will receive baptism; and\r\n  when I shall have been baptised, then all my barons and chiefs\r\n  shall be baptised also, and their followers shall do the like, and\r\n  thus in the end there will be more Christians here than exist in\r\n  your part of the world!’\r\n\r\n  “And if the Pope, as was said in the beginning of this book, had\r\n  sent men fit to preach our religion, the Grand Kaan would have\r\n  turned Christian; for it is an undoubted fact that he greatly\r\n  desired to do so.”\r\n\r\n  In the simultaneous patronage of different religions, Kúblái\r\n  followed the practice of his house. Thus Rubruquis writes of his\r\n  predecessor Mangku Kaan: “It is his custom, on such days as his\r\n  diviners tell him to be festivals, or any of the Nestorian priests\r\n  declare to be holydays, to hold a court. On these occasions the\r\n  Christian priests enter first with their paraphernalia, and pray\r\n  for him, and bless his cup. They retire, and then come the Saracen\r\n  priests and do likewise; the priests of the Idolaters follow. He\r\n  all the while believes in none of them, though they all follow his\r\n  court as flies follow honey. He bestows his gifts on all of them,\r\n  each party believes itself to be his favourite, and all prophesy\r\n  smooth things to him.” Abulfaragius calls Kúblái “a just prince and\r\n  a wise, who loved Christians and honoured physicians of learning,\r\n  whatsoever their nation.”\r\n\r\n  There is a good deal in Kúblái that reminds us of the greatest\r\n  prince of that other great Mongol house, Akbar. And if we trusted\r\n  the first impression of the passage just quoted from Ramusio, we\r\n  might suppose that the grandson of Chinghiz too had some of that\r\n  real wistful regard towards the Lord Jesus Christ, of which we seem\r\n  to see traces in the grandson of Baber. But with Kúblái, as with\r\n  his predecessors, religion seems to have been only a political\r\n  matter; and this aspect of the thing will easily be recognised in\r\n  a re-perusal of his conversation with Messer Nicolas and Messer\r\n  Maffeo. The Kaan must be obeyed; how man shall worship God is\r\n  indifferent; this was the constant policy of his house in the days\r\n  of its greatness. Kúblái, as Koeppen observes, the first of his\r\n  line to raise himself above the natural and systematic barbarism\r\n  of the Mongols, probably saw in the promotion of Tibetan Buddhism,\r\n  already spread to some extent among them, the readiest means of\r\n  civilising his countrymen. But he may have been quite sincere\r\n  in saying what is here ascribed to him in _this_ sense, viz.:\r\n  that if the Latin Church, with its superiority of character and\r\n  acquirement, had come to his aid as he had once requested, he would\r\n  gladly have used _its_ missionaries as his civilising instruments\r\n  instead of the Lamas and their trumpery. (_Rubr._ 313; _Assemani_,\r\n  III. pt. ii. 107; _Koeppen_, II. 89, 96.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n           HOW THE KAAN REWARDED THE VALOUR OF HIS CAPTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we will have done with this matter of Nayan, and go on with our\r\naccount of the great state of the Great Kaan.\r\n\r\nWe have already told you of his lineage and of his age; but now I must\r\ntell you what he did after his return, in regard to those barons who\r\nhad behaved well in the battle. Him who was before captain of 100 he\r\nmade captain of 1000; and him who was captain of 1000 men he made to\r\nbe captain of 10,000, advancing every man according to his deserts\r\nand to his previous rank. Besides that, he also made them presents of\r\nfine silver plate and other rich appointments; gave them Tablets of\r\nAuthority of a higher degree than they held before; and bestowed upon\r\nthem fine jewels of gold and silver, and pearls and precious stones;\r\ninsomuch that the amount that fell to each of them was something\r\nastonishing. And yet ’twas not so much as they had deserved; for never\r\nwere men seen who did such feats of arms for the love and honour of\r\ntheir Lord, as these had done on that day of the battle.{1}\r\n\r\nNow those Tablets of Authority, of which I have spoken, are ordered in\r\nthis way. The officer who is a captain of 100 hath a tablet of silver;\r\nthe captain of 1000 hath a tablet of gold or silver-gilt; the commander\r\nof 10,000 hath a tablet of gold, with a lion’s head on it. And I will\r\ntell you the weight of the different tablets, and what they denote.\r\nThe tablets of the captains of 100 and 1000 weigh each of them 120\r\n_saggi_; and the tablet with the lion’s head engraven on it, which is\r\nthat of the commander of 10,000, weighs 220 _saggi_. And on each of\r\nthe tablets is inscribed a device, which runs: “_By the strength of\r\nthe great God, and of the great grace which He hath accorded to our\r\nEmperor, may the name of the Kaan be blessed; and let all such as will\r\nnot obey him be slain and be destroyed_.” And I will tell you besides\r\nthat all who hold these tablets likewise receive warrants in writing,\r\ndeclaring all their powers and privileges.\r\n\r\nI should mention too that an officer who holds the chief command of\r\n100,000 men, or who is general-in-chief of a great host, is entitled to\r\na tablet that weighs 300 _saggi_. It has an inscription thereon to the\r\nsame purport that I have told you already, and below the inscription\r\nthere is the figure of a lion, and below the lion the sun and moon.\r\nThey have warrants also of their high rank, command, and power.{2}\r\nEvery one, moreover, who holds a tablet of this exalted degree is\r\nentitled, whenever he goes abroad, to have a little golden canopy, such\r\nas is called an umbrella, carried on a spear over his head in token of\r\nhis high command. And whenever he sits, he sits in a silver chair.{3}\r\n\r\nTo certain very great lords also there is given a tablet with\r\ngerfalcons on it; this is only to the very greatest of the Kaan’s\r\nbarons, and it confers on them his own full power and authority; so\r\nthat if one of those chiefs wishes to send a messenger any whither,\r\nhe can seize the horses of any man, be he even a king, and any other\r\nchattels at his pleasure.{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—So Sanang Setzen relates that Chinghiz, on returning from\r\n  one of his great campaigns, busied himself in reorganising his\r\n  forces and bestowing rank and title, according to the deserts of\r\n  each, on his nine _Orlok_, or marshals, and all who had done good\r\n  service. “He named commandants over hundreds, over thousands, over\r\n  ten thousands, over hundred thousands, and opened his treasury to\r\n  the multitude of the people” (p. 91).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—We have several times already had mention of these tablets.\r\n  (See Prologue, ch. viii. and xviii.) The earliest European allusion\r\n  to them is in Rubruquis: “And Mangu gave to the Moghul (whom he\r\n  was going to send to the King of France) a bull of his, that is\r\n  to say, a golden plate of a palm in breadth and half a cubit in\r\n  length, on which his orders were inscribed. Whosoever is the bearer\r\n  of that may order what he pleases, and his order shall be executed\r\n  straightway.”\r\n\r\n  These golden bulls of the Mongol Kaans appear to have been\r\n  originally tokens of high favour and honour, though afterwards they\r\n  became more frequent and conventional. They are often spoken of by\r\n  the Persian historians of the Mongols under the name of _Páïzah_,\r\n  and sometimes _Páïzah Sir-i-Sher_, or “Lion’s Head Paizah.” Thus,\r\n  in a firmán of Ghazan Khan, naming a viceroy to his conquests\r\n  in Syria, the Khan confers on the latter “the sword, the august\r\n  standard, the drum, and _the Lion’s Head Paizah_.” Most frequently\r\n  the grant of this honour is coupled with _Yarlígh_; “to such an\r\n  one were granted _Yarlígh_ and _Páïzah_,” the former word (which is\r\n  still applied in Turkey to the Sultan’s rescripts) denoting the\r\n  written patent which accompanies the grant of the tablet, just as\r\n  the sovereign’s warrant accompanies the badge of a modern Order.\r\n  Of such written patents also Marco speaks in this passage, and\r\n  as he uttered it, no doubt the familiar words _Yarlígh u Páïzah_\r\n  were in his mind. The Armenian history of the Orpelians, relating\r\n  the visit of Prince Sempad, brother of King Hayton, to the court\r\n  of Mangku Kaan, says: “They gave him also a _P’haiza_ of gold,\r\n  _i.e._ a tablet whereon the name of God is written by the Great Kaan\r\n  himself; and this constitutes the greatest honour known among the\r\n  Mongols. Farther, they drew up for him a sort of patent, which the\r\n  Mongols call _Iarlekh_,” etc. The Latin version of a grant by Uzbek\r\n  Khan of Kipchak to the Venetian Andrea Zeno, in 1333,[1] ends with\r\n  the words: “_Dedimus_ baisa _et_ privilegium _cum bullis rubeis_,”\r\n  where the latter words no doubt represent the _Yarlígh al-tamghá_,\r\n  the warrant with the red seal or stamp,[2] as it may be seen upon\r\n  the letter of Arghun Khan. (See plate at ch. xvii. of Bk. IV.)\r\n  So also Janibek, the son of Uzbek, in 1344, confers privileges on\r\n  the Venetians, “_eisdem dando_ baissinum _de auro_”; and again\r\n  Bardibeg, son, murderer, and successor of Janibeg, in 1358, writes:\r\n  “Avemo dado comandamento [_i.e._ Yarlíg] cum le bolle rosse, et lo\r\n  _paysam_.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Seljukian Coin with the Lion and Sun.]\r\n\r\n  Under the Persian branch, at least, of the house the degree of\r\n  honour was indicated by the _number_ of lions’ heads upon the\r\n  plate, which varied from 1 to 5. The Lion and Sun, a symbol which\r\n  survives, or has been revived, in the modern Persian decoration so\r\n  called, formed the emblem of the Sun in Leo, _i.e._ in highest power.\r\n  It had already been used on the coins of the Seljukian sovereigns\r\n  of Persia and Iconium; it appears on coins of the Mongol Ilkhans\r\n  Ghazan, Oljaïtu, and Abusaid, and it is also found on some of those\r\n  of Mahomed Uzbek Khan of Kipchak.\r\n\r\n  Hammer gives regulations of Ghazan Khan’s on the subject of the\r\n  Paizah, from which it is seen that the latter were of different\r\n  _kinds_ as well as degrees. Some were held by great governors\r\n  and officers of state, and these were cautioned against letting\r\n  the Paizah out of their own keeping; others were for officers\r\n  of inferior order; and, again, “for persons travelling on state\r\n  commissions with post-horses, particular paizah (which Hammer says\r\n  were of brass) are appointed, on which their names are inscribed.”\r\n  These last would seem therefore to be merely such permissions to\r\n  travel by the Government post-horses as are still required in\r\n  Russia, perhaps in lineal derivation from Mongol practice. The\r\n  terms of Ghazan’s decree and other contemporary notices show that\r\n  great abuses were practised with the Paizah, as an authority for\r\n  living at free quarters and making other arbitrary exactions.\r\n\r\n  The word _Paizah_ is said to be Chinese, _Pai-tseu_, “a tablet.”\r\n  A trace of the name and the thing still survives in Mongolia. The\r\n  horse-_Bai_ is the name applied to a certain ornament on the horse\r\n  caparison, which gives the rider a title to be furnished with\r\n  horses and provisions on a journey.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “TABLE D’OR DE COMMANDEMENT,”\r\n    THE PAÏZA OF THE MONGOLS\r\n    FROM A SPECIMEN FOUND IN\r\n    E. SIBERIA.]\r\n\r\n  Where I have used the Venetian term _saggio_, the French texts\r\n  have here and elsewhere _saics_ and _saies_, and sometimes _pois_.\r\n  _Saic_ points to _saiga_, which, according to Dupré de St. Maur, is\r\n  in the Salic laws the equivalent of a denier or the twelfth part of\r\n  a sol. _Saggio_ is possibly the same word, or rather may have been\r\n  confounded with it, but the saggio was a recognised Venetian weight\r\n  equal to ⅙ of an ounce. We shall see hereafter that Polo appears to\r\n  use it to indicate the _misḳál_, a weight which may be taken at 74\r\n  grains Troy. On that supposition the smallest tablet specified in\r\n  the text would weigh 18½ ozs. Troy.\r\n\r\n  I do not know if any gold Paizah has been discovered, but several\r\n  of silver have been found in the Russian dominions; one near the\r\n  Dnieper, and two in Eastern Siberia. The first of our plates\r\n  represents one of these, which was found in the Minusinsk circle\r\n  of the Government of Yenisei in 1846, and is now in the Asiatic\r\n  Museum of the Academy of St. Petersburg. For the sake of better\r\n  illustration of our text, I have taken the liberty to represent\r\n  the tablet as of gold, instead of silver with only the inscription\r\n  gilt. The moulded ring inserted in the orifice, to suspend the\r\n  plate by, is of iron. On the reverse side the ring bears some\r\n  Chinese characters engraved, which are interpreted as meaning\r\n  “Publication No. 42.” The inscription on the plate itself is in the\r\n  Mongol language and Baspa character (_supra_, Prologue, note 1, ch.\r\n  xv.), and its purport is a remarkable testimony to the exactness\r\n  of Marco’s account, and almost a proof of his knowledge of the\r\n  language and character in which the inscriptions were engraved.\r\n  It runs, according to Schmidt’s version: “_By the strength of the\r\n  eternal heaven! May the name of the Khagan be holy! Who pays him\r\n  not reverence is to be slain, and must die!_” The inscriptions on\r\n  the other plates discovered were essentially similar in meaning.\r\n  Our second plate shows one of them with the inscription in the\r\n  Uighúr character.\r\n\r\n  The superficial dimensions of the Yenisei tablet, as taken from\r\n  Schmidt’s full-size drawing, are 12·2 in. by 3·65 in. The weight is\r\n  not given.\r\n\r\n  In the French texts nothing is said of the size of the tablets. But\r\n  Ramusio’s copy in the Prologue, where the tables given by Kiacatu\r\n  are mentioned (_supra_, p. 35), says that they were a cubit in\r\n  length and 5 fingers in breadth, and weighed 3 to 4 marks each,\r\n  _i.e._ 24 to 32 ounces.\r\n\r\n  (_Dupré de St. Maur_, _Essai sur les Monnoies_, etc., 1746,\r\n  p. viii.; also (on _saiga_) see _Pertz_, _Script._ XVII. 357;\r\n  _Rubruq._ 312; _Golden Horde_, 219–220, 521; _Ilch._ II. 166\r\n  _seqq._, 355–356; _D’Ohsson_, III. 412–413; _Q.

When the tablet was marked ‘Urgent,’ he had the right\r\n  to take private horses, and was required to ride, night and day,\r\n  700 _li_ in twenty-four hours. On his return he had to give back\r\n  the tablet to the Emperor, who handed it to the prince who had the\r\n  custody of the state tablets and seals.” (_Dr. S. W. Bushell, Actes\r\n  XI. Cong. Int.

The Mongols had them of several kinds, which differed\r\n  by the metal, of which they were made, as well as by the number\r\n  of pearls (one, two, or three in number), which were incrusted in\r\n  the upper part of the tablet. Falcon’s tablets with the figure of\r\n  a falcon were round, and used to be given only to special couriers\r\n  and envoys of the Khan. [_Yuen shi lui pien_ and _Yuen ch’ao tien\r\n  chang_.] The use of the _Hu-fu_ was adopted by the Mongols probably\r\n  from the Kin.” (_Palladius_, _l.c._ p. 39.)\r\n\r\n  Rubruquis (Rockhill’s ed. pp. 153–154) says:—“And whenever\r\n  the principal envoy [of Longa] came to court he carried a\r\n  highly-polished tablet of ivory about a cubit long and half a palm\r\n  wide. Every time he spoke to the chan or some great personage, he\r\n  always looked at that tablet as if he found there what he had to\r\n  say, nor did he look to the right or the left, nor in the face\r\n  of him with whom he was talking. Likewise, when coming into the\r\n  presence of the Lord, and when leaving it, he never looked at\r\n  anything but his tablet.” Mr. Rockhill observes: “These tablets\r\n  are called _hu_ in Chinese, and were used in China and Korea; in\r\n  the latter country down to quite recent times. They were made of\r\n  jade, ivory, bamboo, etc., according to the rank of the owner, and\r\n  were about three feet long. The _hu_ was originally used to make\r\n  memoranda on of the business to be submitted by the bearer to the\r\n  Emperor or to write the answers to questions he had had submitted\r\n  to them. Odoric also refers to ‘the tablets of white ivory which\r\n  the Emperor’s barons held in their hands as they stood silent\r\n  before him.’”\r\n\r\n  (Cf. the golden tablets which were of various classes with a tiger\r\n  for image and pearls for ornaments, _Devéria, Epigraphie_, p. 15 et\r\n  seq.) —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—_Umbrella_. The phrase in Pauthier’s text is “_Palieque\r\n  que on dit_ ombrel.” The Latin text of the Soc. de Géographie has\r\n  “_unum pallium_ de auro,” which I have adopted as probably correct,\r\n  looking to Burma, where the old etiquettes as to umbrellas are in\r\n  full force. These etiquettes were probably in both countries of\r\n  old Hindu origin. _Pallium_, according to Muratori, was applied in\r\n  the Middle Ages to a kind of square umbrella, by which is probably\r\n  meant rather a canopy on four staves, which was sometimes assigned\r\n  by authority as an honourable privilege.\r\n\r\n  But the genuine umbrella would seem to have been used also, for\r\n  Polo’s contemporary, Martino da Canale, says that, when the Doge\r\n  goes forth of his palace, “_si vait apres lui un damoiseau qui\r\n  porte une umbrele de dras à or sur son chief_,” which umbrella had\r\n  been given by “_Monseigneur l’Apostoille_.” There is a picture by\r\n  Girolamo Gambarota, in the Sala del Gran Consiglio, at Venice,\r\n  which represents the investiture of the Doge with the umbrella by\r\n  Pope Alexander III., and Frederick Barbarossa (concerning which see\r\n  _Sanuto_ Junior, in _Muratori_, XXII. 512).\r\n\r\n  The word _Parasol_ also occurs in the Petrarchian vocabulary,\r\n  (14th century) as the equivalent of _saioual_ (Pers. _sáyában_ or\r\n  _sáiwán_, an umbrella). Carpini notices that umbrellas (_solinum\r\n  vel tentoriolum in hastâ_) were carried over the Tartar nobles\r\n  and their wives, even on horseback; and a splendid one, covered\r\n  with jewels, was one of the presents made to Kuyuk Kaan on his\r\n  enthronement.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the honorary character attaching to umbrellas in\r\n  China, I may notice that recently an English resident of Ningpo, on\r\n  his departure for Europe, was presented by the Chinese citizens,\r\n  as a token of honour, with a pair of _Wan min sàn_, umbrellas of\r\n  enormous size.\r\n\r\n  The umbrella must have gone through some curious vicissitudes;\r\n  for at one time we find it familiar, at a later date apparently\r\n  unknown, and then reintroduced as some strange novelty. Arrian\r\n  speaks of the σκιάδια, or umbrellas, as used by all Indians of\r\n  any consideration; but the thing of which he spoke was familiar\r\n  to the use of Greek and Roman ladies, and many examples of it,\r\n  borne by slaves behind their mistresses, are found on ancient\r\n  vase-paintings. Athenaeus quotes from Anacreon the description of a\r\n  “beggar on horseback” who\r\n\r\n                     “like a woman bears\r\n      An ivory parasol over his delicate head.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Second Example of a MONGOL PAÏZA, with\r\n    Superscription in the _Uighúr_ Character, found near the River\r\n    Dnieper, 1845.]\r\n\r\n  An Indian prince, in a Sanskrit inscription of the 9th century,\r\n  boasts of having wrested from the King of Márwár the two umbrellas\r\n  pleasing to Parvati, and white as the summer moonbeams. Prithi\r\n  Ráj, the last Hindu king of Delhi, is depicted by the poet Chand\r\n  as shaded by a white umbrella on a golden staff. An unmistakable\r\n  umbrella, copied from a Saxon MS. in the Harleian collection, is\r\n  engraved in _Wright’s History of Domestic Manners_, p. 75. The fact\r\n  that the gold umbrella is one of the paraphernalia of high church\r\n  dignitaries in Italy seems to presume acquaintance with the thing\r\n  from a remote period. A decorated umbrella also accompanies the\r\n  host when sent out to the sick, at least where I write, in Palermo.\r\n  Ibn Batuta says that in his time all the people of Constantinople,\r\n  civil and military, great and small, carried great umbrellas over\r\n  their heads, summer and winter. Ducange quotes, from a MS. of the\r\n  Paris Library, the Byzantine court regulations about umbrellas,\r\n  which are of the genuine Pan-Asiatic spirit;—σκιάδια χρυσοκóκκινα\r\n  extend from the Hypersebastus to the grand Stratopedarchus, and\r\n  so on; exactly as used to be the case, with different titles, in\r\n  Java. And yet it is curious that John Marignolli, Ibn Batuta’s\r\n  contemporary in the middle of the 14th century, and Barbosa in the\r\n  16th century, are alike at pains to describe the umbrella as some\r\n  strange object. And in our own country it is commonly stated that\r\n  the umbrella was first used in the last century, and that Jonas\r\n  Hanway (died 1786) was one of the first persons who made a practice\r\n  of carrying one. The word _umbrello_ is, however, in Minsheu’s\r\n  dictionary. [See _Hobson-Jobson_, s.v. _Umbrella_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  (_Murat. Dissert._ II. 229; _Archiv. Storic. Ital._ VIII. 274, 560;\r\n  _Klapr.

The same\r\n  author relates that the King of Persia, among other rich presents,\r\n  bestowed upon Entimus the Gortynian, who went up to the king in\r\n  imitation of Themistocles, _a silver chair and a gilt umbrella_.\r\n  (Bk. I. Epit. ch. 31, and II. 31.)\r\n\r\n  The silver chair has come down to our own day in India, and is much\r\n  affected by native princes.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—I have not been able to find any allusion, except in our\r\n  author, to tablets, with gerfalcons (_shonḳár_). The _shonḳár_\r\n  appears, however, according to Erdmann, on certain coins of the\r\n  Golden Horde, struck at Sarai.\r\n\r\n  There is a passage from Wassáf used by Hammer, in whose words\r\n  it runs that the Sayad Imámuddín, appointed (A.D. 683) governor\r\n  of Shiraz by Arghun Khan, “was invested with _both_ the Mongol\r\n  symbols of delegated sovereignty, the Golden Lion’s Head, and\r\n  the golden _Cat’s Head_.” It would certainly have been more\r\n  satisfactory to find “Gerfalcon’s Head” in lieu of the latter;\r\n  but it is probable that the same object is meant. The cut below\r\n  exhibits the conventional effigy of a gerfalcon as sculptured over\r\n  one of the gates of Iconium, Polo’s Conia. The head might easily\r\n  pass for a conventional representation of a cat’s head, and is\r\n  indeed strikingly like the grotesque representation that bears that\r\n  name in mediæval architecture.

He is of a good stature,\r\nneither tall nor short, but of a middle height. He has a becoming\r\namount of flesh, and is very shapely in all his limbs. His complexion\r\nis white and red, the eyes black and fine,{1} the nose well formed and\r\nwell set on. He has four wives, whom he retains permanently as his\r\nlegitimate consorts; and the eldest of his sons by those four wives\r\nought by rights to be emperor;—I mean when his father dies. Those four\r\nladies are called empresses, but each is distinguished also by her\r\nproper name. And each of them has a special court of her own, very\r\ngrand and ample; no one of them having fewer than 300 fair and charming\r\ndamsels. They have also many pages and eunuchs, and a number of other\r\nattendants of both sexes; so that each of these ladies has not less\r\nthan 10,000 persons attached to her court.{2}\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor desires the society of one of these four consorts, he\r\nwill sometimes send for the lady to his apartment and sometimes visit\r\nher at her own. He has also a great number of concubines, and I will\r\ntell you how he obtains them.\r\n\r\nYou must know that there is a tribe of Tartars called UNGRAT, who are\r\nnoted for their beauty. Now every year an hundred of the most beautiful\r\nmaidens of this tribe are sent to the Great Kaan, who commits them to\r\nthe charge of certain elderly ladies dwelling in his palace. And these\r\nold ladies make the girls sleep with them, in order to ascertain if\r\nthey have sweet breath [and do not snore], and are sound in all their\r\nlimbs. Then such of them as are of approved beauty, and are good and\r\nsound in all respects, are appointed to attend on the Emperor by turns.\r\nThus six of these damsels take their turn for three days and nights,\r\nand wait on him when he is in his chamber and when he is in his bed,\r\nto serve him in any way, and to be entirely at his orders. At the\r\nend of the three days and nights they are relieved by other six. And\r\nso throughout the year, there are reliefs of maidens by six and six,\r\nchanging every three days and nights.{3}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait of Kúblái Kaan. (From a Chinese Engraving.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—We are left in some doubt as to the colour of Kúblái’s\r\n  eyes, for some of the MSS. read _vairs_ and _voirs_, and others\r\n  _noirs_. The former is a very common epithet for eyes in the\r\n  mediæval romances. And in the ballad on the death of St. Lewis, we\r\n  are told of his son Tristram:—\r\n\r\n      “Droiz fu comme un rosel, _iex vairs comme faucon_,\r\n       Dès le tens Moysel ne nasqui sa façon.”\r\n\r\n  The word has generally been interpreted _bluish-grey_, but in\r\n  the passage just quoted, Fr.-Michel explains it by _brillans_.\r\n  However, the evidence for _noirs_ here seems strongest. Rashiduddin\r\n  says that when Kúblái was born Chinghiz expressed surprise at the\r\n  child’s being so _brown_, as its father and all his other sons were\r\n  fair. Indeed, we are told that the descendants of Yesugai (the\r\n  father of Chinghiz) were in general distinguished by blue eyes and\r\n  reddish hair. (_Michel’s Joinville_, p. 324; _D’Ohsson_, II. 475;\r\n  _Erdmann_, 252.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—According to Hammer’s authority (Rashid?) Kúblái had\r\n  _seven_ wives; Gaubil’s Chinese sources assign him _five_, with the\r\n  title of empress (_Hwang-heu_). Of these the best beloved was the\r\n  beautiful Jamúi Khátún (Lady or Empress Jamúi, illustrating what\r\n  the text says of the manner of styling these ladies), who bore him\r\n  four sons and five daughters. Rashiduddin adds that she was called\r\n  _Ḳún Ḳú_, or the great consort, evidently the term _Hwang-heu_.\r\n  (Gen. Tables in _Hammer’s Ilkhans_; _Gaubil_, 223; _Erdmann_, 200.)\r\n\r\n  [“Kúblái’s four wives, _i.e._ the empresses of the first, second,\r\n  third, and fourth _ordos_. _Ordo_ is, properly speaking, a separate\r\n  palace of the Khan, under the management of one of his wives.\r\n  Chinese authors translate therefore the word _ordo_ by ‘harem.’\r\n  The four _Ordo_ established by Chingis Khan were destined for the\r\n  empresses, who were chosen out of four different nomad tribes.\r\n  During the reign of the first four Khans, who lived in Mongolia,\r\n  the four _ordo_ were considerably distant one from another, and the\r\n  Khans visited them in different seasons of the year; they existed\r\n  nominally as long as China remained under Mongol domination. The\r\n  custom of choosing the empress out of certain tribes, was in the\r\n  course of time set aside by the Khans. The empress, wife of the\r\n  last Mongol Khan in China, was a Corean princess by birth; and\r\n  she contributed in a great measure to the downfall of the Mongol\r\n  Dynasty.” (_Palladius_, 40.)\r\n\r\n  I do not believe that Rashiduddin’s _Kún Kú_ is the term\r\n  _Hwang-keu_; it is the term _Kiūn Chu_, King or Queen, a\r\n  sovereign.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—_Ungrat_, the reading of the Crusca, seems to be that to\r\n  which the others point, and I doubt not that it represents the\r\n  great Mongol tribe of ḲUNGURAT, which gave more wives than any\r\n  other to the princes of the house of Chinghiz; a conclusion in\r\n  which I find I have been anticipated by De Mailla or his editor\r\n  (IX. 426). To this tribe (which, according to Vámbéry, took its\r\n  name from (Turki) _Kongur-At_, “Chestnut Horse”) belonged Burteh\r\n  Fujin, the favourite wife of Chinghiz himself, and mother of his\r\n  four heirs; to the same tribe belonged the two wives of Chagatai,\r\n  two of Hulaku’s seven wives, one of Mangku Kaan’s, two at least\r\n  of Kúblái’s including the beloved Jamúi Khátún, one at least of\r\n  Abaka’s, two of Ahmed Tigudar’s, two of Arghun’s, and two of\r\n  Ghazan’s.\r\n\r\n  The seat of the Ḳungurats was near the Great Wall. Their name\r\n  is still applied to one of the tribes of the Uzbeks of Western\r\n  Turkestan, whose body appears to have been made up of fractions of\r\n  many of the Turk and Mongol tribes. Kungurat is also the name of\r\n  a town of Khiva, near the Sea of Aral, perhaps borrowed from the\r\n  Uzbek clan.\r\n\r\n  The conversion of _Ḳungurat_ into _Ungrat_ is due, I suppose, to\r\n  that Mongol tendency to soften gutturals which has been before\r\n  noticed. (_Erdm._ 199–200; _Hammer, passim; Burnes_, III. 143, 225.)\r\n\r\n  The Ramusian version adds here these curious and apparently genuine\r\n  particulars:—\r\n\r\n  “The Great Kaan sends his commissioners to the Province to select\r\n  four or five hundred, or whatever number may be ordered, of the\r\n  most beautiful young women, according to the scale of beauty\r\n  enjoined upon them. And they set a value upon the comparative\r\n  beauty of the damsels in this way. The commissioners on arriving\r\n  assemble all the girls of the province, in presence of appraisers\r\n  appointed for the purpose. These carefully survey the points of\r\n  each girl in succession, as (for example) her hair, her complexion,\r\n  eyebrows, mouth, lips, and the proportion of all her limbs. They\r\n  will then set down some as estimated at 16 carats, some at 17,\r\n  18, 20, or more or less, according to the sum of the beauties or\r\n  defects of each. And whatever standard the Great Kaan may have\r\n  fixed for those that are to be brought to him, whether it be 20\r\n  carats or 21, the commissioners select the required number from\r\n  those who have attained that standard, and bring them to him. And\r\n  when they reach his presence he has them appraised anew by other\r\n  parties, and has a selection made of 30 or 40 of those, who then\r\n  get the highest valuation.”\r\n\r\n  Marsden and Murray miss the meaning of this curious statement in a\r\n  surprising manner, supposing the carat to represent some absolute\r\n  value, 4 grains of gold according to the former, whence the damsel\r\n  of 20 carats was estimated at 13_s._ 4_d._! This is sad nonsense;\r\n  but Marsden would not have made the mistake had he not been\r\n  fortunate enough to live before the introduction of Competitive\r\n  Examinations. This Kungurat business was in fact a competitive\r\n  examination in beauty; total marks attainable 24; no candidate to\r\n  pass who did not get 20 or 21. _Carat_ expresses _n_ ÷ 24, not any\r\n  absolute value.\r\n\r\n  Apart from the mode of valuation, it appears that a like system of\r\n  selection was continued by the Ming, and that some such selection\r\n  from the daughters of the Manchu nobles has been maintained till\r\n  recent times. Herodotus tells that the like custom prevailed among\r\n  the Adyrmachidae, the Libyan tribe next Egypt. Old Eden too relates\r\n  it of the “Princes of Moscovia.” (_Middle Km._ I. 318; _Herod._ IV.\r\n  168, Rawl.; _Notes on Russia_, Hak. Soc. II. 253.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                   CONCERNING THE GREAT KAAN’S SONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor hath, by those four wives of his, twenty-two male children;\r\nthe eldest of whom was called CHINKIN for the love of the good Chinghis\r\nKaan, the first Lord of the Tartars. And this Chinkin, as the Eldest\r\nSon of the Kaan, was to have reigned after his father’s death; but, as\r\nit came to pass, he died. He left a son behind him, however, whose name\r\nis TEMUR, and he is to be the Great Kaan and Emperor after the death\r\nof his Grandfather, as is but right; he being the child of the Great\r\nKaan’s eldest son. And this Temur is an able and brave man, as he hath\r\nalready proven on many occasions.{1}\r\n\r\nThe Great Kaan hath also twenty-five other sons by his concubines; and\r\nthese are good and valiant soldiers, and each of them is a great chief.\r\nI tell you moreover that of his children by his four lawful wives there\r\nare seven who are kings of vast realms or provinces, and govern them\r\nwell; being all able and gallant men, as might be expected. For the\r\nGreat Kaan their sire is, I tell you, the wisest and most accomplished\r\nman, the greatest Captain, the best to govern men and rule an Empire,\r\nas well as the most valiant, that ever has existed among all the Tribes\r\nof Tartars.{2}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Kúblái had a son older than CHIMKIN or CHINGKIM, to\r\n  whom Hammer’s Genealogical Table gives the name of _Jurji_, and\r\n  attributes a son called Ananda. The Chinese authorities of Gaubil\r\n  and Pauthier call him _Turchi_ or _Torchi_, _i.e._ _Dorjé_, “Noble\r\n  Stone,” the Tibetan name of a sacred Buddhist emblem in the form\r\n  of a dumb-bell, representing the _Vajra_ or Thunderbolt. Probably\r\n  Dorjé died early, as in the passage we shall quote from Wassáf\r\n  also Chingkim is styled the Eldest Son: Marco is probably wrong in\r\n  connecting the name of the latter with that of Chinghiz. Schmidt\r\n  says that he does not know what _Chingkim_ means.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Parker says that Chen kim was the _third_ son of Kúblái\r\n  (_China Review_, xxiv. p. 94). Teimur, son of Chen kim, wore the\r\n  temple name (_miao-hao_) of _Ch’êng Tsung_ and the title of reign\r\n  (_nien-hao_) of _Yuen Chêng_ and _Ta Téh._—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Chingkim died in the 12th moon of 1284–1285, aged 43. He had\r\n  received a Chinese education, and the Chinese Annals ascribe to him\r\n  all the virtues which so often pertain in history to heirs apparent\r\n  who have not reigned.\r\n\r\n  “When Kúblái approached his 70th year,” says Wassáf, “he desired to\r\n  raise his eldest son Chimkin to the position of his representative\r\n  and declared successor, during his own lifetime; so he took counsel\r\n  with the chiefs, in view to giving the Prince a share of his\r\n  authority and a place on the Imperial Throne. The chiefs, who are\r\n  the Pillars of Majesty and Props of the Empire, represented that\r\n  His Majesty’s proposal to invest his Son, during his own lifetime,\r\n  with Imperial authority, was not in accordance with the precedents\r\n  and Institutes (_Yasa_) of the World-conquering Padshah Chinghiz\r\n  Khan; but still they would consent to execute a solemn document,\r\n  securing the Kaanship to Chimkin, and pledging themselves to\r\n  lifelong obedience and allegiance to him. It was, however, the\r\n  Divine Fiat that the intended successor should predecease him who\r\n  bestowed the nomination.... The dignitaries of the Empire then\r\n  united their voices in favour of TEIMUR, the son of Chimkin.”\r\n\r\n  Teimur, according to the same authority, was the third son of\r\n  Chimkin; but the eldest, Kambala, _squinted_; the second, Tarmah\r\n  (properly _Tarmabala_ for _Dharmaphala_, a Buddhist Sanskrit name)\r\n  was rickety in constitution; and on the death of the old Kaan\r\n  (1294) Teimur was unanimously named to the Throne, after some\r\n  opposition from Kambala, which was put down by the decided bearing\r\n  of the great soldier Bayan. (_Schmidt_, p. 399; _De Mailla_, IX.\r\n  424; _Gaubil_, 203; _Wassáf_, 46.)\r\n\r\n  [The Rev. W. S. Ament (_Marco Polo in Cambaluc_, p. 106), makes\r\n  the following remarks regarding this young prince (Chimkin): “The\r\n  historians give good reasons for their regard for Chen Chin.\r\n  He had from early years exhibited great promise and had shown\r\n  great proficiency in the military art, in government, history,\r\n  mathematics, and the Chinese classics. He was well acquainted with\r\n  the condition and numbers of the inhabitants of Mongolia and China,\r\n  and with the topography and commerce of the Empire (Howorth).\r\n  He was much beloved by all, except by some of his father’s own\r\n  ministers, whose lives were anything but exemplary. That Kúblái had\r\n  full confidence in his son is shown by the fact that he put the\r\n  collecting of taxes in his hands. The native historians represent\r\n  him as economical in the use of money and wise in the choice of\r\n  companions. He carefully watched the officers in his charge, and\r\n  would tolerate no extortion of the people. After droughts, famines\r\n  or floods, he would enquire into the condition of the people and\r\n  liberally supply their needs, thus starting them in life again.\r\n  Polo ascribes all these virtues to the Khan himself. Doubtless he\r\n  possessed them in greater or less degree, but father and son were\r\n  one in all these benevolent enterprises.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The Chinese Annals, according to Pauthier and Gaubil,\r\n  give only _ten_ sons to Kúblái, at least by his legitimate wives;\r\n  Hammer’s Table gives _twelve_. It is very probable that xxii. was\r\n  an early clerical error in the texts of Polo for xii. _Dodeci_\r\n  indeed occurs in one MS. (No. 37 of our Appendix F), though not one\r\n  of much weight.\r\n\r\n  Of these legitimate sons Polo mentions, in different parts of his\r\n  work, five by name. The following is the list from Hammer and\r\n  D’Ohsson, with the Chinese forms from Pauthier in parentheses.\r\n  The seven whose names are in capitals had the title of _Wang_ or\r\n  “King” of particular territories, as M. Pauthier has shown from the\r\n  Chinese Annals, thus confirming Marco’s accuracy on that point.\r\n\r\n  I. Jurji or Dorjé (Torchi). II. CHIMKIN or CHINGKIM (Yu Tsung,\r\n  King of Yen, _i.e._ Old Peking). III. MANGALAI (Mankola, “King of\r\n  the Pacified West”), mentioned by Polo (_infra_, ch. xli.) as King\r\n  of Kenjanfu or Shensi. IV. NUMUGAN (Numukan, “Pacifying King of\r\n  the North”), mentioned by Polo (Bk. IV. ch. ii.) as with King\r\n  George joint leader of the Kaan’s army against Kaidu. V. Kuridai\r\n  (not in Chinese List). VI. HUKAJI (Hukochi, “King of Yunnan”),\r\n  mentioned by Polo (_infra_, ch. xlix.) as King of Carajan. VII.\r\n  AGHRUKJI or UKURUJI (Gaoluchi, “King of Siping” or Tibet). VIII.\r\n  Abaji (Gaiyachi?). IX. KUKJU or GEUKJU (Khokhochu, “King of Ning”\r\n  or Tangut). X. Kutuktemur (Hutulu Temurh). XI. TUKAN (Thohoan,\r\n  “King of Chinnan”). His command lay on the Tungking frontier,\r\n  where he came to great grief in 1288, in consequence of which he\r\n  was disgraced. (See _Cathay_, p. 272.) XII. Temkan (not in Chinese\r\n  List). Gaubil’s Chinese List omits _Hutulu Temurh_, and introduces\r\n  a prince called _Gantanpouhoa_ as 4th son.\r\n\r\n  M. Pauthier lays great stress on Polo’s intimate knowledge of\r\n  the Imperial affairs (p. 263) because he knew the name of the\r\n  Hereditary Prince to be Teimur; this being, he says, the private\r\n  name which could not be known until after the owner’s death, except\r\n  by those in the most confidential intimacy. The public only then\r\n  discovered that, like the Irishman’s dog, his real name was Turk,\r\n  though he had always been called Toby! But M. Pauthier’s learning\r\n  has misled him. At least the secret must have been very badly kept,\r\n  for it was known in Teimur’s lifetime not only to Marco, but to\r\n  Rashiduddin in Persia, and to Hayton in Armenia; to say nothing of\r\n  the circumstance that the name _Temur Khaghan_ is also used during\r\n  that Emperor’s life by Oljaitu Khan of Persia in writing to the\r\n  King of France a letter which M. Pauthier himself republished and\r\n  commented upon. (See his book, p. 780.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n               CONCERNING THE PALACE OF THE GREAT KAAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that for three months of the year, to wit December,\r\nJanuary, and February, the Great Kaan resides in the capital city of\r\nCathay, which is called CAMBALUC, [and which is at the north-eastern\r\nextremity of the country]. In that city stands his great Palace, and\r\nnow I will tell you what it is like.\r\n\r\nIt is enclosed all round by a great wall forming a square, each side of\r\nwhich is a mile in length; that is to say, the whole compass thereof\r\nis four miles. This you may depend on; it is also very thick, and a\r\ngood ten paces in height, whitewashed and loop-holed all round.{1} At\r\neach angle of the wall there is a very fine and rich palace in which\r\nthe war-harness of the Emperor is kept, such as bows and quivers,{2}\r\nsaddles and bridles, and bowstrings, and everything needful for an\r\narmy. Also midway between every two of these Corner Palaces there is\r\nanother of the like; so that taking the whole compass of the enclosure\r\nyou find eight vast Palaces stored with the Great Lord’s harness of\r\nwar.{3} And you must understand that each Palace is assigned to only\r\none kind of article; thus one is stored with bows, a second with\r\nsaddles, a third with bridles, and so on in succession right round.{4}\r\n\r\nThe great wall has five gates on its southern face, the middle one\r\nbeing the great gate which is never opened on any occasion except when\r\nthe Great Kaan himself goes forth or enters. Close on either side of\r\nthis great gate is a smaller one by which all other people pass; and\r\nthen towards each angle is another great gate, also open to people in\r\ngeneral; so that on that side there are five gates in all.{5}\r\n\r\nInside of this wall there is a second, enclosing a space that is\r\nsomewhat greater in length than in breadth. This enclosure also has\r\neight palaces corresponding to those of the outer wall, and stored like\r\nthem with the Lord’s harness of war. This wall also hath five gates on\r\nthe southern face, corresponding to those in the outer wall, and hath\r\none gate on each of the other faces, as the outer wall hath also. In\r\nthe middle of the second enclosure is the Lord’s Great Palace, and I\r\nwill tell you what it is like.{6}\r\n\r\nYou must know that it is the greatest Palace that ever was. [Towards\r\nthe north it is in contact with the outer wall, whilst towards the\r\nsouth there is a vacant space which the Barons and the soldiers are\r\nconstantly traversing.{7} The Palace itself] hath no upper story,\r\nbut is all on the ground floor, only the basement is raised some ten\r\npalms above the surrounding soil [and this elevation is retained by\r\na wall of marble raised to the level of the pavement, two paces in\r\nwidth and projecting beyond the base of the Palace so as to form a\r\nkind of terrace-walk, by which people can pass round the building,\r\nand which is exposed to view, whilst on the outer edge of the wall\r\nthere is a very fine pillared balustrade; and up to this the people\r\nare allowed to come]. The roof is very lofty, and the walls of the\r\nPalace are all covered with gold and silver. They are also adorned with\r\nrepresentations of dragons [sculptured and gilt], beasts and birds,\r\nknights and idols, and sundry other subjects. And on the ceiling too\r\nyou see nothing but gold and silver and painting. [On each of the four\r\nsides there is a great marble staircase leading to the top of the\r\nmarble wall, and forming the approach to the Palace.]{8}\r\n\r\nThe Hall of the Palace is so large that it could easily dine 6000\r\npeople; and it is quite a marvel to see how many rooms there are\r\nbesides. The building is altogether so vast, so rich, and so beautiful,\r\nthat no man on earth could design anything superior to it. The outside\r\nof the roof also is all coloured with vermilion and yellow and green\r\nand blue and other hues, which are fixed with a varnish so fine and\r\nexquisite that they shine like crystal, and lend a resplendent lustre\r\nto the Palace as seen for a great way round.{9} This roof is made too\r\nwith such strength and solidity that it is fit to last for ever.\r\n\r\n[On the interior side of the Palace are large buildings with halls and\r\nchambers, where the Emperor’s private property is placed, such as his\r\ntreasures of gold, silver, gems, pearls, and gold plate, and in which\r\nreside the ladies and concubines. There he occupies himself at his own\r\nconvenience, and no one else has access.]\r\n\r\nBetween the two walls of the enclosure which I have described, there\r\nare fine parks and beautiful trees bearing a variety of fruits. There\r\nare beasts also of sundry kinds, such as white stags and fallow deer,\r\ngazelles and roebucks, and fine squirrels of various sorts, with\r\nnumbers also of the animal that gives the musk, and all manner of other\r\nbeautiful creatures,{10} insomuch that the whole place is full of them,\r\nand no spot remains void except where there is traffic of people going\r\nand coming. [The parks are covered with abundant grass; and the roads\r\nthrough them being all paved and raised two cubits above the surface,\r\nthey never become muddy, nor does the rain lodge on them, but flows off\r\ninto the meadows, quickening the soil and producing that abundance of\r\nherbage.]\r\n\r\nFrom that corner of the enclosure which is towards the north-west there\r\nextends a fine Lake, containing foison of fish of different kinds which\r\nthe Emperor hath caused to be put in there, so that whenever he desires\r\nany he can have them at his pleasure. A river enters this lake and\r\nissues from it, but there is a grating of iron or brass put up so that\r\nthe fish cannot escape in that way.{11}\r\n\r\nMoreover on the north side of the Palace, about a bow-shot off, there\r\nis a hill which has been made by art [from the earth dug out of the\r\nlake]; it is a good hundred paces in height and a mile in compass.\r\nThis hill is entirely covered with trees that never lose their leaves,\r\nbut remain ever green. And I assure you that wherever a beautiful tree\r\nmay exist, and the Emperor gets news of it, he sends for it and has it\r\ntransported bodily with all its roots and the earth attached to them,\r\nand planted on that hill of his. No matter how big the tree may be, he\r\ngets it carried by his elephants; and in this way he has got together\r\nthe most beautiful collection of trees in all the world. And he has\r\nalso caused the whole hill to be covered with the ore of azure,{12}\r\nwhich is very green. And thus not only are the trees all green, but the\r\nhill itself is all green likewise; and there is nothing to be seen on\r\nit that is not green; and hence it is called the GREEN MOUNT; and in\r\ngood sooth ’tis named well.{13}\r\n\r\nOn the top of the hill again there is a fine big palace which is all\r\ngreen inside and out; and thus the hill, and the trees, and the palace\r\nform together a charming spectacle; and it is marvellous to see their\r\nuniformity of colour! Everybody who sees them is delighted. And the\r\nGreat Kaan had caused this beautiful prospect to be formed for the\r\ncomfort and solace and delectation of his heart.\r\n\r\nYou must know that beside the Palace (that we have been describing),\r\n_i.e._ the Great Palace, the Emperor has caused another to be built\r\njust like his own in every respect, and this he hath done for his son\r\nwhen he shall reign and be Emperor after him.{14} Hence it is made\r\njust in the same fashion and of the same size, so that everything can\r\nbe carried on in the same manner after his own death. [It stands on\r\nthe other side of the lake from the Great Kaan’s Palace, and there is\r\na bridge crossing the water from one to the other.]{15} The Prince\r\nin question holds now a Seal of Empire, but not with such complete\r\nauthority as the Great Kaan, who remains supreme as long as he lives.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to tell you of the chief city of Cathay, in which these\r\nPalaces stand; and why it was built, and how.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—[According to the _Ch’ue keng lu_, translated by\r\n  Bretschneider, 25, “the wall surrounding the palace ... is\r\n  constructed of bricks, and is 35 _ch’i_ in height. The construction\r\n  was begun in A.D. 1271, on the 17th of the 8th month, between three\r\n  and five o’clock in the afternoon, and finished next year on the\r\n  15th of the 3rd month.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—_Tarcasci_ (G. T.). This word is worthy of note as the\r\n  proper form of what has become in modern French _carquois_. The\r\n  former is a transcript of the Persian _Tărkăsh_; the latter appears\r\n  to be merely a corruption of it, arising perhaps clerically from\r\n  the constant confusion of _c_ and _t_ in MSS. (See _Defrémery_,\r\n  quoted by Pauthier, _in loco._) [Old French _tarquais_ (13th\r\n  century), Hatzfeldt and Darmesteter’s _Dict._ gives; “Coivres orent\r\n  ceinz et tarchais.” (WACE, _Rou_, III., 7698; 12th century).]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—[“It seems to me [Dr. Bretschneider] that Polo took the\r\n  towers, mentioned by the Chinese author, in the angles of the\r\n  galleries and of the Kung-ch’eng for palaces; for further on he\r\n  states, that ‘over each gate [of Cambaluc] there is a great and\r\n  handsome palace.’ I have little doubt that over the gates of\r\n  Cambaluc, stood lofty buildings similar to those over the gates of\r\n  modern Peking. These tower-like buildings are called _lou_ by the\r\n  Chinese. It may be very likely, that at the time of Marco Polo,\r\n  the war harness of the Khan was stored in these towers of the\r\n  palace wall. The author of the _Ch’ue keng lu_, who wrote more than\r\n  fifty years later, assigns to it another place.” (_Bretschneider,\r\n  Peking_, 32.) —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IDEAL PLAN of the ANCIENT PALACES of the MONGOL\r\n    EMPERORS AT KHANBALIGH according to Dʳ. Bretschneider]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The stores are now outside the walls of the “Prohibited\r\n  City,” corresponding to Polo’s Palace-Wall, but within the walls of\r\n  the “Imperial City.” (_Middle Kingdom_, I. 61.) See the cut at p.\r\n  376.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The two gates near the corners apparently do not exist in\r\n  the Palace now. “On the south side there are three gates to the\r\n  Palace, both in the inner and the outer walls. The middle one is\r\n  absolutely reserved for the entrance or exit of the Emperor; all\r\n  other people pass in and out by the gate to the right or left of\r\n  it.” (_Trigautius_, Bk. I. ch. vii.) This custom is not in China\r\n  peculiar to Royalty. In private houses it is usual to have three\r\n  doors leading from the court to the guest-rooms, and there is a\r\n  great exercise of politeness in reference to these; the guest after\r\n  much pressing is prevailed on to enter the middle door, whilst\r\n  the host enters by the side. (See _Deguignes, Voyages_, I. 262.)\r\n  [See also _H. Cordier’s Hist. des Relat. de la Chine_, III. ch. x.\r\n  _Audience Impériale_.]\r\n\r\n  [“It seems Polo took the three gateways in the middle gate\r\n  (_Ta-ming men_) for three gates, and thus speaks of five gates\r\n  instead of three in the southern wall.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_,\r\n  27, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—Ramusio’s version here diverges from the old MSS. It makes\r\n  the inner enclosure a mile square; and the second (the city of\r\n  Taidu) six miles square, as here, but adds, at a mile interval,\r\n  a third of eight miles square. Now it is remarkable that Mr. A.\r\n  Wylie, in a letter dated 4th December 1873, speaking of a recent\r\n  visit to Peking, says: “I found from various inquiries that there\r\n  are several remains of a very much larger city wall, inclosing the\r\n  present city; but time would not allow me to follow up the traces.”\r\n\r\n  Pauthier’s text (which I have corrected by the G. T.), after\r\n  describing the _outer inclosure_ to be a _mile every way_, says\r\n  that the inner inclosure lay at _an interval of a mile within it_!\r\n\r\n  [Dr. Bretschneider observes “that in the ancient Chinese works,\r\n  three concentric inclosures are mentioned in connection with\r\n  the palace. The innermost inclosed the _Ta-nei_, the middle\r\n  inclosure, called _Kung-ch’eng_ or _Huang-ch’eng_, answering to\r\n  the wall surrounding the present prohibited city, and was about 6\r\n  _li_ in circuit. Besides this there was an outer wall (a rampart\r\n  apparently) 20 _li_ in circuit, answering to the wall of the\r\n  present imperial city (which now has 18 _li_ in circuit).” The\r\n  _Huang-ch’eng_ of the Yuen was measured by imperial order, and\r\n  found to be 7 _li_ in circuit; the wall of the Mongol palace was 6\r\n  _li_ in circuit, according to the _Ch’ue keng lu_. (_Bretschneider,\r\n  Peking_, 24.)—Marco Polo’s mile could be approximately estimated\r\n  = 2·77 Chinese _li_. (_Ibid._ 24, note.) The common Chinese _li_\r\n  = 360 _pu_, or 180 _chang_, or 1800 _ch’i_ (feet); 1 _li_ = 1894\r\n  English feet or 575 mètres; at least according to the old Venice\r\n  measures quoted in _Yule’s Marco Polo_, II., one pace = 5 feet.\r\n  Besides the common _li_, the Chinese have another _li_, used for\r\n  measuring fields, which has only 240 _pu_ or 1200 _ch’i_. This is\r\n  the _li_ spoken of in the _Ch’ue keng lu_. (_Ibid._ 13, note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—[“Near the southern face of the wall are barracks for\r\n  the Life Guards.” (_Ch’ue keng lu_, translated by Bretschneider,\r\n  25.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—This description of palace (see opposite cut), an elevated\r\n  basement of masonry with a superstructure of timber (in general\r\n  carved and gilded), is still found in Burma, Siam, and Java, as\r\n  well as in China. If we had any trace of the palaces of the ancient\r\n  Asokas and Vikramadityas of India, we should probably find that\r\n  they were of the same character. It seems to be one of those things\r\n  that belonged to some ancient Panasiatic fashion, as the palaces of\r\n  Nineveh were of a somewhat similar construction. In the Audience\r\n  Halls of the Moguls at Delhi and Agra we can trace the ancient\r\n  form, though the superstructure has there become an arcade of\r\n  marble instead of a pavilion on timber columns.\r\n\r\n  [“The _Ta-ming tien_ (Hall of great brightness) is without doubt\r\n  what Marco Polo calls ‘the Lord’s Great Palace.’... He states, that\r\n  it ‘hath no upper story’; and indeed, the palace buildings which\r\n  the Chinese call _tien_ are always of one story. Polo speaks also\r\n  of a ‘very fine pillared balustrade’ (the _chu lang_, pillared\r\n  verandah, of the Chinese author). Marco Polo states that the\r\n  basement of the great palace ‘is raised some ten palms above the\r\n  surrounding soil.’ We find in the _Ku kung i lu_: ‘The basement of\r\n  the Ta-ming tien is raised about 10 _ch’i_ above the soil.’ There\r\n  can also be no doubt that the Ta-ming tien stood at about the same\r\n  place where now the _T’ai-ho tien_, the principal hall of the\r\n  palace, is situated.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_, 28, note.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _A.

They are too long to be reproduced\r\n  here.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 9.—“As all that one sees of these palaces is varnished in\r\n  those colours, when you catch a distant view of them at sunrise, as\r\n  I have done many a time, you would think them all made of, or at\r\n  least covered with, pure gold enamelled in azure and green, so that\r\n  the spectacle is at once majestic and charming.” (_Magaillans_, p.\r\n  353.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 10.—[This is the _Ling yu_ or “Divine Park,” to the east of\r\n  the _Wan-sui shan_, “in which rare birds and beasts are kept.\r\n  Before the Emperor goes to Shangtu, the officers are accustomed\r\n  to be entertained at this place.” (_Ch’ue keng lu_, quoted by\r\n  Bretschneider, 36.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 11.—“On the west side, where the space is amplest, there\r\n  is a lake very full of fish. It is in the form of a fiddle, and\r\n  is an Italian mile and a quarter in length. It is crossed at\r\n  the narrowest part, which corresponds to gates in the walls, by\r\n  a handsome bridge, the extremities of which are adorned by two\r\n  triumphal arches of three openings each.... The lake is surrounded\r\n  by palaces and pleasure houses, built partly in the water and\r\n  partly on shore, and charming boats are provided on it for the\r\n  use of the Emperor when he chooses to go a-fishing or to take an\r\n  airing.” (_Ibid._ 282–283.) The marble bridge, as it now exists,\r\n  consists of nine arches, and is 600 feet long. (_Rennie’s Peking_,\r\n  II. 57.)\r\n\r\n  Ramusio specifies another lake in the _city_, fed by the same\r\n  stream before it enters the palace, and used by the public for\r\n  watering cattle.\r\n\r\n  [“The lake which Marco Polo saw is the same as the _T’ai-yi ch’i_\r\n  of our days. It has, however, changed a little in its form. This\r\n  lake and also its name _T’ai-yi ch’i_ date from the twelfth\r\n  century, at which time an Emperor of the Kin first gave orders to\r\n  collect together the water of some springs in the hills, where now\r\n  the summer palaces stand, and to conduct it to a place north of\r\n  his capital, where pleasure gardens were laid out. The river which\r\n  enters the lake and issues from it exists still, under its ancient\r\n  name _Kin-shui_.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_, 34.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 12.—The expression here is in the Geog. Text, “_Roze_ de\r\n  _l’açur_,” and in Pauthier’s “_de rose et de l’asur_.” _Rose\r\n  Minerale_, in the terminology of the alchemists, was a red powder\r\n  produced in the sublimation of gold and mercury, but I can find no\r\n  elucidation of the term Rose of Azure. The Crusca Italian has in\r\n  the same place _Terra dello Azzurro_. Having ventured to refer the\r\n  question to the high authority of Mr. C. W. King, he expresses the\r\n  opinion that _Roze_ here stands for _Roche_, and that probably the\r\n  term _Roche de l’azur_ may have been used loosely for _blue-stone_,\r\n  _i.e._ carbonate of copper, which would assume a green colour through\r\n  moisture. He adds: “Nero, according to Pliny, actually used\r\n  _chrysocolla_, the siliceous carbonate of copper, in powder, for\r\n  strewing the circus, to give the course the colour of his favourite\r\n  faction, the _prasine_ (or green). There may be some analogy\r\n  between this device and that of Kúblái Khan.” This parallel is a\r\n  very happy one.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 13.—Friar Odoric gives a description, short, but closely\r\n  agreeing in substance with that in the Text, of the Palace, the\r\n  Park, the Lake, and the Green Mount.\r\n\r\n  A green mount, answering to the description, and about 160 feet in\r\n  height, stands immediately in rear of the palace buildings. It is\r\n  called by the Chinese _King-Shan_, “Court Mountain,” _Wan-su-Shan_,\r\n  “Ten Thousand Year Mount,” and _Mei-Shan_, “Coal Mount,” the last\r\n  from the material of which it is traditionally said to be composed\r\n  (as a provision of fuel in case of siege).[1] Whether this is\r\n  Kúblái’s Green Mount does not seem to be quite certain. Dr.\r\n  Lockhart tells me that, according to the information he collected\r\n  when living at Peking, it is not so, but was formed by the Ming\r\n  Emperors from the excavation of the existing lake on the site which\r\n  the Mongol Palace had occupied. There is another mount, he adds,\r\n  adjoining the east shore of the lake, which must be of older date\r\n  even than Kúblái, for a Dagoba standing on it is ascribed to the\r\n  _Kin_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Mei Shan.]\r\n\r\n  [The “Green Mount” was an island called _K’iung-hua_ at the time\r\n  of the Kin; in 1271 it received the name of _Wan-sui shan_; it is\r\n  about 100 feet in height, and is the only hill mentioned by Chinese\r\n  writers of the Mongol time who refer to the palace grounds. It\r\n  is not the present _King-shan_, north of the palace, called also\r\n  _Wan-sui-shan_ under the Ming, and now the _Mei-shan_, of more\r\n  recent formation. “I have no doubt,” says Bretschneider (_Peking_,\r\n  _l.c._ 35), “that Marco Polo’s handsome palace on the top of the\r\n  Green Mount is the same as the _Kuang-han tien_” of the _Ch’ue\r\n  keng lu_. It was a hall in which there was a jar of black jade,\r\n  big enough to hold more than 30 piculs of wine; this jade had\r\n  white veins, and in accordance with these veins, fish and animals\r\n  have been carved on the jar. (_Ibid._ 35.) “The _Ku kung i lu_, in\r\n  describing the _Wan-sui-shan_, praises the beautiful shady green of\r\n  the vegetation there.” (_Ibid._ 37.) —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [“Near the eastern end of the bridge (_Kin-ao yü-tung_ which\r\n  crosses the lake) the visitor sees a circular wall, which is called\r\n  _yüan ch’eng_ (round wall). It is about 350 paces in circuit.\r\n  Within it is an imperial building _Ch’eng-kuang tien_, dating from\r\n  the Mongol time. From this circular enclosure, another long and\r\n  beautifully executed marble bridge leads northwards, to a charming\r\n  hill, covered with shady trees, and capped by a magnificent white\r\n  _suburga_.” (_Bretschneider_, p. 22.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In a plate attached to next chapter, I have drawn, on a small\r\n  scale, the existing cities of Peking, as compared with the Mongol\r\n  and Chinese cities in the time of Kúblái. The plan of the latter\r\n  has been constructed (1) from existing traces, as exhibited\r\n  in the Russian Survey republished by our War Office; (2) from\r\n  information kindly afforded by Dr. Lockhart; and (3) from Polo’s\r\n  description and a few slight notices by Gaubil and others. It will\r\n  be seen, even on the small scale of these plans, that the general\r\n  arrangement of the palace, the park, the lakes (including that in\r\n  the city, which appears in Ramusio’s version), the bridge, the\r\n  mount, etc., in the existing Peking, very closely correspond with\r\n  Polo’s indications; and I think the strong probability is that the\r\n  Ming really built on the old traces, and that the lake, mount,\r\n  etc., as they now stand, are substantially those of the Great\r\n  Mongol, though Chinese policy or patriotism may have spread the\r\n  belief that the foreign traces were obliterated. Indeed, if that\r\n  belief were true, the Mongol Palace must have been very much out\r\n  of the axis of the City of Kúblái, which is in the highest degree\r\n  improbable. The _Bulletin de la Soc. de Géographie_ for September\r\n  1873, contains a paper on Peking by the physician to the French\r\n  Embassy there. Whatever may be the worth of the meteorological\r\n  and hygienic details in that paper, I am bound to say that the\r\n  historical and topographical part is so inaccurate as to be of no\r\n  value.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 14.—For son, read grandson. But the G. T. actually names the\r\n  Emperor’s son Chingkim, whose death our traveller has himself\r\n  already mentioned.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 15.—[“Marco Polo’s bridge, crossing the lake from one side to\r\n  the other, must be identified with the wooden bridge mentioned in\r\n  the _Ch’ue keng lu_. The present marble bridge spanning the lake\r\n  was only built in 1392.” “A marble bridge connects this island\r\n  (an islet with the hall _I-t’ien tien_) with the _Wan-sui shan_.\r\n  Another bridge, made of wood, 120 _ch’i_ long and 22 broad, leads\r\n  eastward to the wall of the Imperial Palace. A third bridge, a\r\n  wooden draw-bridge 470 _ch’i_ long, stretches to the west over the\r\n  lake to its western border, where the palace _Hing-sheng kung_\r\n  [built in 1308] stands.” (_Bretschneider_, _Peking_, 36.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Yüan ch’eng.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Some years ago, in Calcutta, I learned that a large store of\r\n    charcoal existed under the soil of Fort William, deposited there, I\r\n    believe, in the early days of that fortress.\r\n\r\n    [“The _Jihia_ says that the name of _Mei shan_ (Coal hill) was\r\n    given to it from the stock of coal buried at its foot, as a\r\n    provision in case of siege.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_, 38.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                   CONCERNING THE CITY OF CAMBALUC.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there was on that spot in old times a great and noble city called\r\nCAMBALUC, which is as much as to say in our tongue “The city of the\r\nEmperor.”{1} But the Great Kaan was informed by his Astrologers that\r\nthis city would prove rebellious, and raise great disorders against his\r\nimperial authority. So he caused the present city to be built close\r\nbeside the old one, with only a river between them.{2} And he caused\r\nthe people of the old city to be removed to the new town that he had\r\nfounded; and this is called TAIDU. [However, he allowed a portion of\r\nthe people which he did not suspect to remain in the old city, because\r\nthe new one could not hold the whole of them, big as it is.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the size of this (new) city you must know that it has a\r\ncompass of 24 miles, for each side of it hath a length of 6 miles, and\r\nit is four-square. And it is all walled round with walls of earth which\r\nhave a thickness of full ten paces at bottom, and a height of more\r\nthan 10 paces;{3} but they are not so thick at top, for they diminish\r\nin thickness as they rise, so that at top they are only about 3 paces\r\nthick. And they are provided throughout with loop-holed battlements,\r\nwhich are all whitewashed.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 gates, and over each gate there is a great and handsome\r\npalace, so that there are on each side of the square three gates and\r\nfive palaces; for (I ought to mention) there is at each angle also a\r\ngreat and handsome palace. In those palaces are vast halls in which are\r\nkept the arms of the city garrison.{4}\r\n\r\nThe streets are so straight and wide that you can see right along them\r\nfrom end to end and from one gate to the other. And up and down the\r\ncity there are beautiful palaces, and many great and fine hostelries,\r\nand fine houses in great numbers. [All the plots of ground on which\r\nthe houses of the city are built are four-square, and laid out with\r\nstraight lines; all the plots being occupied by great and spacious\r\npalaces, with courts and gardens of proportionate size. All these plots\r\nwere assigned to different heads of families. Each square plot is\r\nencompassed by handsome streets for traffic; and thus the whole city is\r\narranged in squares just like a chess-board, and disposed in a manner\r\nso perfect and masterly that it is impossible to give a description\r\nthat should do it justice.]{5}\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the middle of the city there is a great clock—that is to\r\nsay, a bell—which is struck at night. And after it has struck three\r\ntimes no one must go out in the city, unless it be for the needs\r\nof a woman in labour, or of the sick.{6} And those who go about on\r\nsuch errands are bound to carry lanterns with them. Moreover, the\r\nestablished guard at each gate of the city is 1000 armed men; not that\r\nyou are to imagine this guard is kept up for fear of any attack, but\r\nonly as a guard of honour for the Sovereign, who resides there, and to\r\nprevent thieves from doing mischief in the town.{7}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—✛ The history of the city on the site of Peking goes back\r\n  to very old times, for it had been [under the name of _Ki_] the\r\n  capital of the kingdom of Yen, previous to B.C. 222, when it was\r\n  captured by the Prince of the T’sin Dynasty. [Under the T’ang\r\n  dynasty (618–907) it was known under the name of Yu-chau.] It\r\n  became one of the capitals of the Khitans in A.D. 936, and of the\r\n  Kin sovereigns, who took it in 1125, in 1151 under the name of\r\n  Chung-tu. Under the name of Yenking, [given to this city in 1013]\r\n  it has a conspicuous place in the wars of Chinghiz against the\r\n  latter dynasty. He captured it in 1215. In 1264, Kúblái adopted it\r\n  as his chief residence, and founded in 1267, the new city of TATU\r\n  (“Great Court”), called by the Mongols TAIDU or DAITU since 1271\r\n  (see Bk. I. ch. lxi. note 1), at a little distance—Odoric says half\r\n  a mile—to the north-east of the old Yenking. Tatu was completed in\r\n  the summer of 1267.\r\n\r\n  Old Yenking had, when occupied by the Kin, a circuit of 27 _li_\r\n  (commonly estimated at 9 miles, but in early works the _li_ is not\r\n  more than ⅕ of a mile), afterwards increased to 30 _li_. But there\r\n  was some kind of outer wall about the city and its suburbs, the\r\n  circuit of which is called 75 _li_. [“At the time of the Yuen the\r\n  walls still existed, and the ancient city of the Kin was commonly\r\n  called Nan-ch’eng (Southern city), whilst the Mongol capital was\r\n  termed the northern city.” _Bretschneider, Peking_, 10.—H. C.]\r\n  (_Lockhart_; and see _Amyot_, II. 553, and note 6 to last chapter.)\r\n\r\n  Polo correctly explains the name _Cambaluc_, _i.e._ _Kaan-baligh_,\r\n  “The City of the Kaan.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The river that ran between the old and new city must have\r\n  been the little river _Yu_, which still runs through the modern\r\n  Tartar city, and fills the city ditches.\r\n\r\n  [Dr. Bretschneider (_Peking_, 49) thinks that there is a strong\r\n  probability that Polo speaks of the _Wen-ming ho_, a river which,\r\n  according to the ancient descriptions, ran near the southern wall\r\n  of the Mongol capital.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: South Gate of Imperial City at Peking.\r\n\r\n    “=Elle a douze portes, et sor chascune porte a une grandisme palais\r\n    et biaus.=”]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This height is from Pauthier’s Text; the G. Text has,\r\n  “_twenty_ paces,” _i.e._ 100 feet. A recent French paper states the\r\n  dimensions of the existing walls as 14 mètres (45½ feet) high,\r\n  and 14·50 (47¼ feet) thick, “the top forming a paved promenade,\r\n  unique of its kind, and recalling the legendary walls of Thebes and\r\n  Babylon.” (_Ann. d’Hygiène Publique_, 2nd s. tom. xxxii. for 1869,\r\n  p. 21.)\r\n\r\n  [According to the French astronomers (Fleuriais and Lapied) sent\r\n  to Peking for the Transit of Venus in December, 1875, the present\r\n  Tartar city is 23 kil. 55 in circuit, viz. if 1 _li_ = 575 m., 41\r\n  _li_; from the north to the south 5400 mètres; from east to west\r\n  6700 mètres; the wall is 13 mètres in height and 12 mètres in\r\n  width.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Our attempted plan of Cambaluc, as in 1290, differs\r\n  somewhat from this description, but there is no getting over\r\n  certain existing facts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PEKING As it is and As it was, about 1290]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A.D. 1290.]\r\n\r\n  The existing Tartar city of Peking (technically _Neï-ch’ing_, “The\r\n  Interior City,” or _King-ch’ing_, “City of the Court”) stands on\r\n  the site of Taidu, and represents it. After the expulsion of the\r\n  Mongols (1368) the new native Dynasty of Ming established their\r\n  capital at Nanking. But this was found so inconvenient that the\r\n  third sovereign of the Dynasty re-occupied Taidu or Cambaluc, the\r\n  repairs of which began in 1409. He reduced it in size by cutting\r\n  off nearly a third part of the city at the north end. The remains\r\n  of this abandoned portion of wall are, however, still in existence,\r\n  approaching 30 feet in height all round. This old wall is called\r\n  by the Chinese _The Wall of the Yuen_ (_i.e._ the Mongol Dynasty),\r\n  and it is laid down in the Russian Survey. [The capital of the Ming\r\n  was 40 _li_ in circuit, according to the _Ch’ang an k’o hua_.]\r\n  The existing walls were built, or restored rather (the north wall\r\n  being in any case, of course, entirely new), in 1437. There seems\r\n  to be no doubt that the present south front of the Tartar city was\r\n  the south front of Taidu. The whole outline of Taidu is therefore\r\n  still extant, and easily measurable. If the scale on the War Office\r\n  edition of the Russian Survey be correct, the long sides measure\r\n  close upon 5 miles and 500 yards; the short sides, 3 miles and 1200\r\n  yards. Hence the whole perimeter was just about 18 English miles,\r\n  or less than 16 Italian miles. If, however, a pair of compasses\r\n  be run round Taidu and Yenking (as we have laid the latter down\r\n  from such data as could be had) _together_, the circuit will be\r\n  something like 24 Italian miles, and this may have to do with\r\n  Polo’s error.\r\n\r\n  [“The _Yuen shi_ states that _Ta-tu_ was 60 _li_ in circumference.\r\n  The _Ch’ue keng lu_, a work published at the close of the Yuen\r\n  Dynasty, gives the same number of _li_ for the circuit of the\r\n  capital, but explains that _li_ of 240 _pu_ each are meant. If this\r\n  statement be correct, it would give only 40 common or geographical\r\n  _li_ for the circuit of the Mongol town.” (_Bretschneider_,\r\n  _Peking_, 13.) Dr. Bretschneider writes (p. 20): “The outlines\r\n  of Khanbaligh, partly in contradiction with the ancient Chinese\r\n  records, if my view be correct, would have measured about 50 common\r\n  _li_ in circuit (13 _li_ and more from north to south, 11·64 from\r\n  east to west.”)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Polo [and Odoric] again says that there were 12 gates—3 to every\r\n  side. Both Gaubil and Martini also say that there were 12 gates.\r\n  But I believe that both are trusting to Marco. There are 9 gates\r\n  in the present Tartar city—viz. 3 on the south side and 2 on each\r\n  of the other sides. The old Chinese accounts say there were 11\r\n  gates in Taidu. (See _Amyot_, _Mém._ II. 553.) I have in my plan,\r\n  therefore, assumed that one gate on the east and one on the west\r\n  were obliterated in the reduction of the _enceinte_ by the Ming.\r\n  But I must observe that Mr. Lockhart tells me he did not find the\r\n  traces of gates in those positions, whilst the 2 gates on the\r\n  _north_ side of the old Mongol rampart are quite distinct, with the\r\n  barbicans in front, and the old Mongol bridge over the ditch still\r\n  serving for the public thoroughfare.[1]\r\n\r\n  [“The _Yuen shi_ as well as the _Ch’ue keng lu_, and other works\r\n  of the Yuen, agree in stating that the capital had eleven gates.\r\n  They are enumerated in the following order: Southern wall—(1) The\r\n  gate direct south (mid.) was called _Li-cheng men_; (2) the gate\r\n  to the left (east), _Wen-ming men_; (3) the gate to the right\r\n  (west), _Shun-ch’eng men_. Eastern wall—(4) The gate direct east\r\n  (mid.), _Ch’ung-jen men_; (5) the gate to the south-east, _Ts’i-hua\r\n  men_; (6) the gate to the north-east, _Kuang-hi men_. Western\r\n  wall—(7) The gate direct west (mid.), _Ho-i men_; (8) the gate to\r\n  the south-west, _P’ing-tse men_; (9) the gate to the north-west,\r\n  _Su-ts’ing men_. Northern Wall—(10) The gate to the north-west,\r\n  _K’ien-te men_; (11) the gate to the north-east, _An-chen men_.”\r\n  (_Bretschneider_, _Peking_, 13–14.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  When the Ming established themselves on the old Mongol site,\r\n  population seems to have gathered close about the southern\r\n  wall, probably using material from the remains of Yenking. This\r\n  excrescence was inclosed by a new wall in 1554, and was called\r\n  the “Outer Town.” It is what is called by Europeans the _Chinese\r\n  City_. Its western wall exhibits in the base sculptured stones,\r\n  which seem to have belonged to the old palace of Yenking. Some\r\n  traces of Yenking still existed in Gaubil’s time; the only relic\r\n  of it now pointed out is a pagoda outside of the Kwang-An-Măn, or\r\n  western gate of the Outer City, marked in the War Office edition of\r\n  the Russian Map as “Tower.” (Information from _Dr. Lockhart._)\r\n\r\n  The “Great Palaces” over the gates and at the corner bastions are\r\n  no doubt well illustrated by the buildings which still occupy those\r\n  positions. There are two such lofty buildings at each of the gates\r\n  of the modern city, the outer one (shown on p. 376) forming an\r\n  elevated redoubt.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The French writer cited under note 3 says of the city as it\r\n  stands: “La ville est de la sorte coupée en échiquier à peu près\r\n  régulier dont les quadres circonscrits par des larges avenues sont\r\n  percés eux-mêmes d’une multitude de rues et ruelles ... qui toutes\r\n  à peu près sont orientées N. et S., E. et O. Une seule volonté a\r\n  évidemment présidé à ce plan, et jamais édilité n’a eu à exécuter\r\n  d’un seul coup aussi vaste entreprise.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—Martini speaks of the public clock-towers in the Chinese\r\n  cities, which in his time were furnished with water-clocks.\r\n  A watchman struck the hour on a great gong, at the same time\r\n  exhibiting the hour in large characters. The same person watched\r\n  for fires, and summoned the public with his gong to aid in\r\n  extinguishing them.\r\n\r\n  [The Rev. G. B. Farthing mentions (_North-China Herald_, 7th\r\n  September, 1884) at T’ai-yuen fu the remains of an object in\r\n  the bell-tower, which was, and is still known, as one of the\r\n  eight wonders of this city; it is a vessel of brass, a part of a\r\n  water-clock from which water formerly used to flow down upon a drum\r\n  beneath and mark off time into equal divisions.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  The tower indicated by Marco appears still to exist. It occupies\r\n  the place which I have marked as Alarm Tower in the plan of Taidu.\r\n  It was erected in 1272, but probably rebuilt on the Ming occupation\r\n  of the city. [“The _Yuen yi t’ung chi_, or ‘Geography of the\r\n  Mongol Empire’ records: ‘In the year 1272, the bell-tower and the\r\n  drum-tower were built in the _middle_ of the capital.’ A bell-tower\r\n  (_chung-lou_) and a drum-tower (_ku-lou_) exist still in Peking,\r\n  in the northern part of the Tartar City. The _ku-lou_ is the same\r\n  as that built in the thirteenth century, but the bell-tower dates\r\n  only from the last century. The bell-tower of the Yuen was a little\r\n  to the east of the drum-tower, where now the temple _Wan-ning sse_\r\n  stands. This temple is nearly in the middle of the position I\r\n  (Bretschneider) assign to Khanbaligh.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_,\r\n  20.)—H. C.] In the Court of the Old Observatory at Peking there\r\n  is preserved, with a few other ancient instruments, which date\r\n  from the Mongol era, a very elaborate water-clock, provided with\r\n  four copper basins embedded in brickwork, and rising in steps one\r\n  above the other. A cut of this courtyard, with its instruments and\r\n  aged trees, also ascribed to the Mongol time, will be found in ch.\r\n  xxxiii.

Mr. Gilmour (a missionary to the Mongols) and I rode\r\n    round it, he taking the outside and I the inside.... Neither of\r\n    us observed the arch that Dr. Lockhart speaks of.... _There_ are\r\n    _gate-openings about the middle of the east and west sides_, but no\r\n    barbicans.” (4th December 1873.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE GREAT KAAN MAINTAINS A GUARD OF TWELVE THOUSAND\r\n                   HORSE, WHICH ARE CALLED KESHICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that the Great Kaan, to maintain his state, hath a guard\r\nof twelve thousand horsemen, who are styled KESHICAN, which is as much\r\nas to say “Knights devoted to their Lord.” Not that he keeps these\r\nfor fear of any man whatever, but merely because of his own exalted\r\ndignity. These 12,000 men have four captains, each of whom is in\r\ncommand of 3000; and each body of 3000 takes a turn of three days and\r\nnights to guard the palace, where they also take their meals. After the\r\nexpiration of three days and nights they are relieved by another 3000,\r\nwho mount guard for the same space of time, and then another body takes\r\nits turn, so that there are always 3000 on guard. Thus it goes until\r\nthe whole 12,000, who are styled (as I said) Keshican, have been on\r\nduty; and then the tour begins again, and so runs on from year’s end to\r\nyear’s end.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—I have _deduced_ a reading for the word _Quescican_\r\n  (Keshican), which is not found precisely in any text. Pauthier\r\n  reads _Questiau_ and _Quesitau_; the G. Text has _Quesitam_ and\r\n  _Quecitain_; the Crusca _Questi Tan_; Ramusio, _Casitan_; the\r\n  Riccardiana, _Quescitam_. Recollecting the constant clerical\r\n  confusion between _c_ and _t_, what follows will leave no doubt I\r\n  think that the true reading to which all these variations point is\r\n  _Quescican_.[1]\r\n\r\n  In the Institutes of Ghazan Khan, we find established among other\r\n  formalities for the authentication of the royal orders, that they\r\n  should be stamped on the back, in black ink, with the seals of\r\n  the _Four Commanders_ of the _Four Kiziks_, or _Corps of the Life\r\n  Guard_.\r\n\r\n  Wassáf also, in detailing the different classes of the great\r\n  dignitaries of the Mongol monarchy, names (1) the _Noyáns_ of the\r\n  Ulus, or princes of the blood; (2) the great chiefs of the tribes;\r\n  (3) the _Amírs of the four Keshik_, or _Corps of the Body Guard_;\r\n  (4) the officers of the army, commanding ten thousands, thousands,\r\n  and so on.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, in Rashiduddin, we find the identical plural form used\r\n  by our author. He says that, after the sack of Baghdad, Hulaku,\r\n  who had escaped from the polluted atmosphere of the city, sent\r\n  “Ilká Noyán and Ḳarábúgá, with 3000 Moghul horse into Baghdad, in\r\n  order to have the buildings repaired, and to put things generally\r\n  in order. These chiefs posted sentries from the KISHÍKÁN (كشي\r\n  كان), and from their own followings in the different quarters of\r\n  the town, had the carcases of beasts removed from the streets, and\r\n  caused the bazaars to be rebuilt.”\r\n\r\n  We find _Kishik_ still used at the court of Hindustan, under the\r\n  great kings of Timur’s House, for the corps on tour of duty at the\r\n  palace; and even for the sets of matchlocks and sabres, which were\r\n  changed weekly from Akbar’s armoury for the royal use. The royal\r\n  guards in Persia, who watch the king’s person at night, are termed\r\n  _Keshikchi_, and their captain _Keshikchi Bashi_. [“On the night\r\n  of the 11th of Jemady ul Sany, A.H. 1160 (or 8th June, 1747), near\r\n  the city of Khojoon, three days’ journey from Meshed, Mohammed\r\n  Kuly Khan Ardemee, who was of the same tribe with Nadir Shah, his\r\n  relation, and Kushukchee Bashee, with seventy of the _Kukshek_ or\r\n  guard, ... bound themselves by an oath to assassinate Nadir Shah.”\r\n  (_Memoirs of Khojeh Abdulkurreem ... transl. by F. Gladwin_,\r\n  Calcutta, 1788, pp. 166–167).]\r\n\r\n  Friar Odoric speaks of the four barons who kept watch by the Great\r\n  Kaan’s side as the _Cuthé_, which probably represents the Chinese\r\n  form _Kiesie_ (as in De Mailla), or _Kuesie_ (as in Gaubil). The\r\n  latter applies the term to four devoted champions of Chinghiz,\r\n  and their descendants, who were always attached to the Kaan’s\r\n  body-guard, and he identifies them with the _Quesitan_ of Polo, or\r\n  rather with the captains of the latter; adding expressly that the\r\n  word _Kuesie_ is Mongol.\r\n\r\n  I see _Kishik_ is a proper name among the Kalmak chiefs; and\r\n  _Keshikten_ also is the name of a Mongol tribe, whose territory\r\n  lies due north of Peking, near the old site of Shangtu. (Bk. I.\r\n  ch. lxi.) [_Keshikhteng_, a tribe (_pu_; mong. _aimak_) of the\r\n  Chao Uda League (_mêng_; mong. _chogolgân_) among the twenty-four\r\n  tribes of the _Nei Mung-ku_ (Inner Mongols). (See _Mayers’ Chinese\r\n  Government_, p. 81.)—H. C.] In Kovalevsky, I find the following:—\r\n\r\n  (No. 2459) “_Keshik_, grace, favour, bounty, benefit, good fortune,\r\n  charity.”\r\n\r\n  (No. 2461) “_Keshikten_, fortunate, happy, blessed.”\r\n\r\n  (No. 2541) “_Kichyeku_, to be zealous, assiduous, devoted.”\r\n\r\n  (No. 2588) “_Kushiku_, to hinder, to bar the way to,” etc.\r\n\r\n  The third of these corresponds closely with Polo’s etymology of\r\n  “knights devoted to their lord,” but perhaps either the first or\r\n  the last may afford the real derivation.\r\n\r\n  In spite of the different initials (ق instead of ک), it can\r\n  scarcely be doubted that the _Ḳalchi_ and _Ḳalaḳchi_ of Timur’s\r\n  Institutes are mere mistranscriptions of the same word, _e.g._: “I\r\n  ordered that 12,000 _Ḳalchi_, men of the sword completely armed,\r\n  should be cantoned in the Palace; to the right and to the left,\r\n  to the front, and in the rear of the imperial diwán; thus, that\r\n  1000 of those 12,000 should be every night upon guard,” etc. The\r\n  translator’s note says of _Ḳalchi_, “A Mogul word supposed to mean\r\n  _guards_.” We see that even the traditional number of 12,000, and\r\n  its division into four brigades, are maintained. (See _Timour’s\r\n  Inst._, pp. 299 and 235, 237.)\r\n\r\n  I must add that Professor Vámbéry does not assent to the form\r\n  _Keshikán_, on the ground that this Persian plural is impossible\r\n  in an old Tartar dialect, and he supposes the true word to be\r\n  _Kechilan_ or _Kechiklen_, “the night-watchers,” from _Kiche_ or\r\n  _Kichek_ (Chag. and Uighúr), = “night.”\r\n\r\n  I believe, however, that Persian was the colloquial language of\r\n  foreigners at the Kaan’s court, who would not scruple to make a\r\n  Persian plural when wanted; whilst Rashid has exemplified the\r\n  actual use of this one.\r\n\r\n  (_D’Ohsson_, IV. 410; _Gold.

This is a general Mongol term to designate\r\n  the Khan’s lifeguard. It is derived from the word _Keshik_,\r\n  meaning a guard by turns; a corps on tour of duty. _Keshik_ is\r\n  one of the archaisms of the Mongol language, for now this word\r\n  has another meaning in Mongol. Colonel Yule has brought together\r\n  several explanations of the term. It seems to me that among his\r\n  suppositions the following is the most consistent with the ancient\r\n  meaning of the word:—\r\n\r\n  “We find _Kishik_ still used at the court of Hindustan, under the\r\n  great kings of Timur’s House, for the corps on tour of duty at the\r\n  palace.... The royal guards in Persia, who watch the King’s person\r\n  at night, are termed _Keshikchi_.”\r\n\r\n  “The Keshikten was divided into a day-watch called _Turgaut_ and\r\n  a night-watch _Kebteul_. The Kebte-ul consisted of pure Mongols,\r\n  whilst the Turgaut was composed of the sons of the vassal princes\r\n  and governors of the provinces, and of hostages. The watch of\r\n  the Khan was changed every three days, and contained 400 men. In\r\n  1330 it was reduced to 100 men.” (_Palladius_, 42–43.) Mr. E. H.\r\n  Parker writes in the _China Review_, XVIII. p. 262, that they “are\r\n  evidently the ‘body guards’ of the modern viceroys, now pronounced\r\n  Kashïha, but, evidently, originally _Kêshigha_.” —H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] One of the nearest readings is that of the Brandenburg Latin\r\n    collated by Müller, which has _Quaesicam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n       THE FASHION OF THE GREAT KAAN’S TABLE AT HIS HIGH FEASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the Great Kaan sits at table on any great court occasion, it\r\nis in this fashion. His table is elevated a good deal above the others,\r\nand he sits at the north end of the hall, looking towards the south,\r\nwith his chief wife beside him on the left. On his right sit his sons\r\nand his nephews, and other kinsmen of the Blood Imperial, but lower, so\r\nthat their heads are on a level with the Emperor’s feet. And then the\r\nother Barons sit at other tables lower still. So also with the women;\r\nfor all the wives of the Lord’s sons, and of his nephews and other\r\nkinsmen, sit at the lower table to his right; and below them again the\r\nladies of the other Barons and Knights, each in the place assigned by\r\nthe Lord’s orders. The tables are so disposed that the Emperor can see\r\nthe whole of them from end to end, many as they are.{1} [Further, you\r\nare not to suppose that everybody sits at table; on the contrary, the\r\ngreater part of the soldiers and their officers sit at their meal in\r\nthe hall on the carpets.] Outside the hall will be found more than\r\n40,000 people; for there is a great concourse of folk bringing presents\r\nto the Lord, or come from foreign countries with curiosities.\r\n\r\nIn a certain part of the hall near where the Great Kaan holds his\r\ntable, there [is set a large and very beautiful piece of workmanship\r\nin the form of a square coffer, or buffet, about three paces each way,\r\nexquisitely wrought with figures of animals, finely carved and gilt.\r\nThe middle is hollow, and in it] stands a great vessel of pure gold,\r\nholding as much as an ordinary butt; and at each corner of the great\r\nvessel is one of smaller size [of the capacity of a firkin], and from\r\nthe former the wine or beverage flavoured with fine and costly spices\r\nis drawn off into the latter. [And on the buffet aforesaid are set all\r\nthe Lord’s drinking vessels, among which are certain pitchers of the\r\nfinest gold,] which are called _verniques_,{2} and are big enough to\r\nhold drink for eight or ten persons. And one of these is put between\r\nevery two persons, besides a couple of golden cups with handles, so\r\nthat every man helps himself from the pitcher that stands between him\r\nand his neighbour. And the ladies are supplied in the same way. The\r\nvalue of these pitchers and cups is something immense; in fact, the\r\nGreat Kaan has such a quantity of this kind of plate, and of gold and\r\nsilver in other shapes, as no one ever before saw or heard tell of, or\r\ncould believe.{3}\r\n\r\n[There are certain Barons specially deputed to see that foreigners, who\r\ndo not know the customs of the Court, are provided with places suited\r\nto their rank; and these Barons are continually moving to and fro in\r\nthe hall, looking to the wants of the guests at table, and causing the\r\nservants to supply them promptly with wine, milk, meat, or whatever\r\nthey lack. At every door of the hall (or, indeed, wherever the Emperor\r\nmay be) there stand a couple of big men like giants, one on each\r\nside, armed with staves. Their business is to see that no one steps\r\nupon the threshold in entering, and if this does happen, they strip\r\nthe offender of his clothes, and he must pay a forfeit to have them\r\nback again; or in lieu of taking his clothes, they give him a certain\r\nnumber of blows. If they are foreigners ignorant of the order, then\r\nthere are Barons appointed to introduce them, and explain it to them.\r\nThey think, in fact, that it brings bad luck if any one touches the\r\nthreshold. Howbeit, they are not expected to stick at this in going\r\nforth again, for at that time some are like to be the worse for liquor,\r\nand incapable of looking to their steps.{4}]\r\n\r\nAnd you must know that those who wait upon the Great Kaan with his\r\ndishes and his drink are some of the great Barons. They have the mouth\r\nand nose muffled with fine napkins of silk and gold, so that no breath\r\nnor odour from their persons should taint the dish or the goblet\r\npresented to the Lord. And when the Emperor is going to drink, all the\r\nmusical instruments, of which he has vast store of every kind, begin\r\nto play. And when he takes the cup all the Barons and the rest of the\r\ncompany drop on their knees and make the deepest obeisance before him,\r\nand then the Emperor doth drink. But each time that he does so the\r\nwhole ceremony is repeated.{5}\r\n\r\nI will say nought about the dishes, as you may easily conceive that\r\nthere is a great plenty of every possible kind. But you should know\r\nthat in every case where a Baron or Knight dines at those tables,\r\ntheir wives also dine there with the other ladies. And when all have\r\ndined and the tables have been removed, then come in a great number\r\nof players and jugglers, adepts at all sorts of wonderful feats,{6}\r\nand perform before the Emperor and the rest of the company, creating\r\ngreat diversion and mirth, so that everybody is full of laughter and\r\nenjoyment. And when the performance is over, the company breaks up and\r\nevery one goes to his quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—We are to conceive of rows of small tables, at each of\r\n  which were set probably but two guests. This seems to be the modern\r\n  Chinese practice, and to go back to some very old accounts of the\r\n  Tartar nations. Such tables we find in use in the tenth century, at\r\n  the court of the King of Bolghar (see _Prologue_, note 2, ch. ii.),\r\n  and at the Chinese entertainments to Shah Rukh’s embassy in the\r\n  fifteenth century. Megasthenes described the guests at an Indian\r\n  banquet as having a table set before each individual. (_Athenaeus_,\r\n  IV. 39, _Yonge’s Transl._)\r\n\r\n  [Compare Rubruck’s account, Rockhill’s ed., p. 210: “The Chan sits\r\n  in a high place to the north, so that he can be seen by all....”\r\n  (See also Friar Odoric, _Cathay_, p. 141.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—This word (G. T. and Ram.) is in the Crusca Italian\r\n  transformed into an adjective, “_vaselle_ vernicate _d’oro_,” and\r\n  both Marsden and Pauthier have substantially adopted the same\r\n  interpretation, which seems to me in contradiction with the text.\r\n  In Pauthier’s text the word is _vernigal_, pl. _vernigaux_, which\r\n  he explains, I know not on what authority, as “_coupes sans anses\r\n  vernies ou laquées d’or_.” There is, indeed, a Venetian sea-term,\r\n  _Vernegal_, applied to a wooden bowl in which the food of a mess is\r\n  put, and it seems possible that this word may have been substituted\r\n  for the unknown _Vernique_. I suspect the latter was some Oriental\r\n  term, but I can find nothing nearer than the Persian _Bărni_, Ar.\r\n  _Al-Bărníya_, “vas fictile in quo quid recondunt,” whence the\r\n  Spanish word _Albornia_, “a great glazed vessel in the shape of\r\n  a bowl, with handles.” So far as regards the form, the change of\r\n  _Barniya_ into _Vernique_ would be quite analogous to that change\r\n  of _Hundwáníy_ into _Ondanique_, which we have already met with.\r\n  (See _Dozy et Engelmann, Glos. des Mots Espagnols_, etc., 2nd ed.,\r\n  1867, p. 73; and _Boerio, Diz. del. Dial. Venez._)\r\n\r\n  [_F. Godefroy, Dict., s.v. Vernigal_, writes: “Coupe sans anse,\r\n  vernie ou laquée d’or,” and quotes, besides Marco Polo, the _Regle\r\n  du Temple_, p. 214, éd. Soc. Hist. de France:\r\n\r\n      “Les _vernigaus_ et les escuelles.”\r\n\r\n  About _vernegal_, cf. _Rockhill, Rubruck_, p. 86, note. Rubruck\r\n  says (_Soc. de Géog._ p. 241): “Implevimus unum _veringal_ de\r\n  biscocto et platellum unum de pomis et aliis fructibus.” Mr.\r\n  Rockhill translates _veringal_ by _basket_.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bretschneider (_Peking_, 28) mentions “a large jar made of wood\r\n  and _varnished_, the inside lined with silver,” and he adds in a\r\n  note “perhaps this statement may serve to explain Marco Polo’s\r\n  _verniques_ or _vaselle_ vernicate _d’oro_, big enough to hold\r\n  drink for eight or ten persons.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  A few lines above we have “of the capacity of a _firkin_.” The word\r\n  is _bigoncio_, which is explained in the _Vocab. Univ. Ital._ as a\r\n  kind of tub used in the vintage, and containing 3 _mine_, each of\r\n  half a _stajo_. This seems to point to the _Tuscan_ mina, or half\r\n  stajo, which is = ⅓ of a bushel. Hence the _bigoncio_ would = a\r\n  bushel, or, in old liquid measure, about a firkin.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—A buffet, with flagons of liquor and goblets, was an\r\n  essential feature in the public halls or tents of the Mongols\r\n  and other Asiatic races of kindred manners. The ambassadors of\r\n  the Emperor Justin relate that in the middle of the pavilion\r\n  of Dizabulus, the Khan of the Turks, there were set out\r\n  drinking-vessels, and flagons and great jars, all of gold;\r\n  corresponding to the _coupes_ (or _hanas à mances_), the\r\n  _verniques_, and the _grant peitere_ and _petietes peiteres_ of\r\n  Polo’s account. Rubruquis describes in Batu Khan’s tent a buffet\r\n  near the entrance, where _Kumiz_ was set forth, with great goblets\r\n  of gold and silver, etc., and the like at the tent of the Great\r\n  Kaan. At a festival at the court of Oljaitu, we are told, “Before\r\n  the throne stood golden buffets ... set out with full flagons and\r\n  goblets.” Even in the private huts of the Mongols there was a\r\n  buffet of a humbler kind exhibiting a skin of _Kumiz_, with other\r\n  kinds of drink, and cups standing ready; and in a later age at\r\n  the banquets of Sháh Abbás we find the great buffet in a slightly\r\n  different form, and the golden flagon still set to every two\r\n  persons, though it no longer contained the liquor, which was handed\r\n  round. (_Cathay_, clxiv., cci.; _Rubr._ 224, 268, 305; _Ilch._ II.\r\n  183; _Della Valle_, I. 654 and 750–751.)\r\n\r\n  [Referring to the “large and very beautiful piece of workmanship,”\r\n  Mr. Rockhill, _Rubruck_, 208–209, writes: “Similar works of art\r\n  and mechanical contrivances were often seen in Eastern courts. The\r\n  earliest I know of is the golden plane-tree and grape vine with\r\n  bunches of grapes in precious stones, which was given to Darius by\r\n  Pythius the Lydian, and which shaded the king’s couch. (Herodotus,\r\n  IV. 24.) The most celebrated, however, and that which may have\r\n  inspired Mangu with the desire to have something like it at his\r\n  court, was the famous Throne of Solomon (Σολομώντεος Θρóνος) of the\r\n  Emperor of Constantinople, Theophilus (A.D. 829–842).... Abulfeda\r\n  states that in A.D. 917 the envoys of Constantine Porphyrogenitus\r\n  to the Caliph el Moktader saw in the palace of Bagdad a tree with\r\n  eighteen branches, some of gold, some of silver, and on them were\r\n  gold and silver birds, and the leaves of the tree were of gold\r\n  and silver. By means of machinery, the leaves were made to rustle\r\n  and the birds to sing. Mirkhond speaks also of a tree of gold and\r\n  precious stones in the city of Sultanieh, in the interior of which\r\n  were conduits through which flowed drinks of different kinds.\r\n  Clavijo describes a somewhat similar tree at the court of Timur.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bretschneider (_Peking_, 28, 29) mentions a clepsydra with a\r\n  lantern. By means of machinery put in motion by water, at fixed\r\n  times a little man comes forward exhibiting a tablet, which\r\n  announces the hours. He speaks also of a musical instrument which\r\n  is connected, by means of a tube, with two peacocks sitting on a\r\n  cross-bar, and when it plays, the mechanism causes the peacocks to\r\n  dance.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Odoric describes the great jar of liquor in the middle of the\r\n  palace hall, but in his time it was made of a great mass of jade\r\n  (p. 130).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—This etiquette is specially noticed also by Odoric, as well\r\n  as by Makrizi, by Rubruquis, and by Plano Carpini. According to the\r\n  latter the breach of it was liable to be punished with death. The\r\n  prohibition to tread on the threshold is also specially mentioned\r\n  in a Mahomedan account of an embassy to the court of Barka Khan.\r\n  And in regard to the tents, Rubruquis says he was warned not\r\n  to touch the ropes, for these were regarded as representing\r\n  the threshold. A Russo-Mongol author of our day says that the\r\n  memory of this etiquette or superstition is still preserved by\r\n  a Mongol proverb: “Step not on the threshold; it is a sin!” But\r\n  among some of the Mongols more than this survives, as is evident\r\n  from a passage in Mr. Michie’s narrative: “There is a right and\r\n  a wrong way of approaching a _yourt_ also. Outside the door there\r\n  are generally ropes lying on the ground, held down by stakes, for\r\n  the purpose of tying up the animals when they want to keep them\r\n  together. There is a way of getting over or round these ropes that\r\n  I never learned, but on one occasion the ignorant breach of the\r\n  rule on our part excluded us from the hospitality of the family.”\r\n  The feeling or superstition was in full force in Persia in the 17th\r\n  century, at least in regard to the threshold of the king’s palace.\r\n  It was held a sin to tread upon it in entering. (_Cathay_, 132;\r\n  _Rubr._ 255, 268, 319; _Plan. Carp._ 625, 741; _Makrizi_, I. 214;\r\n  _Mél. Asiat. Ac. St. Petersb._ II. 660; _The Siberian Overland\r\n  Route_, p. 97; _P. Della Valle_, II. 171.)\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill writes (_Rubruck_, p. 104): “The same custom existed\r\n  among the Fijians, I believe. I may note that it also prevailed in\r\n  ancient China. It is said of Confucius ‘when he was standing he\r\n  did not occupy the middle of the gate-way; when he passed in or\r\n  out, he did not tread on the threshold.’ (_Lun-yü_, Bk. X. ch. iv.\r\n  2.) In China, the bride’s feet must not touch the threshold of the\r\n  bridegroom’s house. (Cf. _Dennys’ Folk-lore in China_, p. 18.)\r\n\r\n  “The author of the _Ch’ue keng lu_ mentions also the athletes with\r\n  clubs standing at the door, at the time of the khan’s presence in\r\n  the hall. He adds, that next to the Khan, two other life-guards\r\n  used to stand, who held in their hands ‘natural’ axes of jade (axes\r\n  found fortuitously in the ground, probably primitive weapons).”\r\n  (_Palladius_, p. 43.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—Some of these etiquettes were probably rather Chinese than\r\n  Mongol, for the regulations of the court of Kúblái apparently\r\n  combined the two. In the visit of Shah Rukh’s ambassadors to the\r\n  court of the Emperor Ch’êng Tsu of the Ming Dynasty in 1421, we\r\n  are told that by the side of the throne, at an imperial banquet,\r\n  “there stood two eunuchs, each having a band of thick paper over\r\n  his mouth, and extending to the tips of his ears.... Every time\r\n  that a dish, or a cup of _darassun_ (rice-wine) was brought to the\r\n  emperor, all the music sounded.” (_N. et Ext._ XIV. 408, 409.) In\r\n  one of the Persepolitan sculptures, there stands behind the King an\r\n  eunuch bearing a fan, and with his mouth covered; at least so says\r\n  Heeren.

And the Great Kaan was born on the 28th day of the\r\nSeptember moon, so on that day is held the greatest feast of the year\r\nat the Kaan’s Court, always excepting that which he holds on New Year’s\r\nDay, of which I shall tell you afterwards.{1}\r\n\r\nNow, on his birthday, the Great Kaan dresses in the best of his robes,\r\nall wrought with beaten gold;{2} and full 12,000 Barons and Knights on\r\nthat day come forth dressed in robes of the same colour, and precisely\r\nlike those of the Great Kaan, except that they are not so costly; but\r\nstill they are all of the same colour as his, and are also of silk and\r\ngold. Every man so clothed has also a girdle of gold; and this as well\r\nas the dress is given him by the Sovereign. And I will aver that there\r\nare some of these suits decked with so many pearls and precious stones\r\nthat a single suit shall be worth full 10,000 golden bezants.\r\n\r\nAnd of such raiment there are several sets. For you must know that\r\nthe Great Kaan, thirteen times in the year, presents to his Barons\r\nand Knights such suits of raiment as I am speaking of.{3} And on each\r\noccasion they wear the same colour that he does, a different colour\r\nbeing assigned to each festival. Hence you may see what a huge business\r\nit is, and that there is no prince in the world but he alone who could\r\nkeep up such customs as these.\r\n\r\nOn his birthday also, all the Tartars in the world, and all the\r\ncountries and governments that owe allegiance to the Kaan, offer him\r\ngreat presents according to their several ability, and as prescription\r\nor orders have fixed the amount. And many other persons also come with\r\ngreat presents to the Kaan, in order to beg for some employment from\r\nhim. And the Great Kaan has chosen twelve Barons on whom is laid the\r\ncharge of assigning to each of these supplicants a suitable answer.\r\n\r\nOn this day likewise all the Idolaters, all the Saracens, and all\r\nthe Christians and other descriptions of people make great and solemn\r\ndevotions, with much chaunting and lighting of lamps and burning of\r\nincense, each to the God whom he doth worship, praying that He would\r\nsave the Emperor, and grant him long life and health and happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, as I have related, is celebrated the joyous feast of the\r\nKaan’s birthday.{4}\r\n\r\nNow I will tell you of another festival which the Kaan holds at the New\r\nYear, and which is called the White Feast.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The Chinese Year commences, according to Duhalde, with\r\n  the New Moon nearest to the Sun’s Passage of the middle point of\r\n  Aquarius; according to Pauthier, with the New Moon immediately\r\n  preceding the Sun’s entry into Pisces. (These would almost always\r\n  be identical, but not always.) Generally speaking, the first month\r\n  will include part of February and part of March. The eighth month\r\n  will then be September–October (_v. ante_, ch. ii. note 2).\r\n\r\n  [According to Dr. S. W. Williams (_Middle Kingdom_, II. p. 70):\r\n  “The year is lunar, but its commencement is regulated by the sun.\r\n  New Year falls on the first new moon after the sun enters Aquarius,\r\n  which makes it come not before January 21st nor after February\r\n  19th.” “The beginning of the civil year, writes Peter Hoang\r\n  (_Chinese Calendar_, p. 13), depends upon the good pleasure of the\r\n  Emperors. Under the Emperor Hwang-ti (2697 B.C.) and under the Hsia\r\n  Dynasty (2205 B.C.), it was made to commence with the 3rd month\r\n  _yin-yüeh_ [Pisces]; under the Shang Dynasty (1766 B.C.) with the\r\n  2nd month _ch’ou-yüeh_ [Aquarius], and under the Chou Dynasty (1122\r\n  B.C.) with the 1st month _tzu-yüeh_ [Capricorn].”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The expression “_à or batuz_” as here applied to robes,\r\n  is common among the mediæval poets and romance-writers, _e.g._\r\n  Chaucer:—\r\n\r\n      “Full yong he was and merry of thought,\r\n       And in samette with birdes wrought\r\n       And with gold beaten full fetously,\r\n       His bodie was clad full richely.”\r\n                           —_Rom. of the Rose_, 836–839.\r\n\r\n  M. Michel thinks that in a stuff so termed the gold wire was\r\n  _beaten out_ after the execution of the embroidery, a process which\r\n  widened the metallic surface and gave great richness of appearance.\r\n  The fact was rather, however, according to Dr. Rock, that the gold\r\n  used in weaving such tissues was _not_ wire but beaten sheets of\r\n  gold cut into narrow strips. This would seem sufficient to explain\r\n  the term “beaten gold,” though Dr. Rock in another passage refers\r\n  it to a custom which he alleges of sewing goldsmith’s work upon\r\n  robes. (_Fr. Michel_, _Recherches_, II. 389, also I. 371; _Rock’s\r\n  Catalogue_, pp. xxv. xxix. xxxviii. cvi.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The number of these festivals and distributions of dresses\r\n  is _thirteen_ in all the old texts, except the Latin of the Geog.\r\n  Soc., which has _twelve_. Thirteen would seem therefore to have\r\n  been in the original copy. And the Ramusian version expands this\r\n  by saying, “Thirteen great feasts that the Tartars keep with much\r\n  solemnity to each of the thirteen moons of the year.”[1] It is\r\n  possible, however, that this latter sentence is an interpolated\r\n  gloss; for, besides the improbability of munificence so frequent,\r\n  Pauthier has shown some good reasons why _thirteen_ should be\r\n  regarded as an error for _three_. The official History of the\r\n  Mongol Dynasty, which he quotes, gives a detail of raiment\r\n  distributed in presents on great state occasions _three_ times a\r\n  year. Such a mistake might easily have originated in the first\r\n  dictation, _treize_ substituted for _trois_, or rather for the\r\n  old form _tres_; but we must note that the number 13 is repeated\r\n  and corroborated in ch. xvi. Odoric speaks of _four_ great yearly\r\n  festivals, but there are obvious errors in what he says on this\r\n  subject. Hammer says the great Mongol Feasts were three, viz. New\r\n  Year’s Day, the Kaan’s Birthday, and the Feast of the Herds.\r\n\r\n  Something like the changes of costume here spoken of is mentioned\r\n  by Rubruquis at a great festival of four days’ duration at the\r\n  court of Mangku Kaan: “Each day of the four they appeared in\r\n  different raiment, suits of which were given them for each day of\r\n  a different colour, but everything on the same day of one colour,\r\n  from the boots to the turban.” So also Carpini says regarding\r\n  the assemblies of the Mongol nobles at the inauguration of Kuyuk\r\n  Kaan: “The first day they were all clad in white pourpre (? _albis\r\n  purpuris_, see Bk. I. ch. vi. note 4), the second day in ruby\r\n  pourpre, the third day in blue pourpre, the fourth day in the\r\n  finest baudekins.” (_Cathay_, 141; _Rubr._ 368; _Pl. Car._ 755.)\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 247, note) makes the following\r\n  remarks: “Odoric, however, says that the colours differed according\r\n  to the rank. The custom of presenting _khilats_ is still observed\r\n  in Central Asia and Persia. I cannot learn from any other authority\r\n  that the Mongols ever wore turbans. Odoric says the Mongols of the\r\n  imperial feasts wore ‘coronets’ (_in capite coronati_).”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—[“The accounts given by Marco Polo regarding the feasts of\r\n  the Khan and the festival dresses at his Court, agree perfectly\r\n  with the statements on the same subject of contemporary Chinese\r\n  writers. Banquets were called in the common Mongol language\r\n  _chama_, and festival dresses _chisun_. General festivals used to\r\n  be held at the New Year and at the Birthday of the Khan. In the\r\n  _Mongol-Chinese Code_, the ceremonies performed in the provinces on\r\n  the Khan’s Birthday are described. One month before that day the\r\n  civil and military officers repaired to a temple, where a service\r\n  was performed to the Khan’s health. On the morning of the Birthday\r\n  a sumptuously adorned table was placed in the open air, and the\r\n  representatives of all classes and all confessions were obliged\r\n  to approach the table, to prostrate themselves and exclaim three\r\n  times: _Wan-sui_ (_i.e._ ‘Ten thousand years’ life to the Khan).\r\n  After that the banquet took place. In the same code (in the article\r\n  on the _Ye li ke un_ [Christians, _Erke-un_]) it is stated, that in\r\n  the year 1304,—owing to a dispute, which had arisen in the province\r\n  of Kiang-nan between the _ho-shang_ (Buddhist priests) and the\r\n  Christian missionaries, as to precedence in the above-mentioned\r\n  ceremony,—a special edict was published, in which it was decided\r\n  that in the rite of supplication, Christians should follow the\r\n  Buddhist and Taouist priests.” (_Palladius_, pp. 44–45.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] There are thirteen months to the Chinese year in seven out of every\r\n    nineteen.\r\n\r\n    [“This interval of 10 years comprises 235 lunar months, generally\r\n    125 _long_ months of 30 days, 110 _short_ months of 29 days, (but\r\n    sometimes 124 _long_ and 111 _short_ months), and 7 _intercalary_\r\n    months. The year of twelve months is called a common year, that\r\n    of thirteen months, an _intercalary_ year.” (_P. Hoang, Chinese\r\n    Calendar_, p. 12. —H. C.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n           OF THE GREAT FESTIVAL WHICH THE KAAN HOLDS ON NEW\r\n                              YEAR’S DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of their New Year is the month of February, and on that\r\noccasion the Great Kaan and all his subjects made such a Feast as I now\r\nshall describe.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom that on this occasion the Kaan and all his subjects\r\nshould be clothed entirely in white; so, that day, everybody is in\r\nwhite, men and women, great and small. And this is done in order that\r\nthey may thrive all through the year, for they deem that white clothing\r\nis lucky.{1} On that day also all the people of all the provinces\r\nand governments and kingdoms and countries that own allegiance to\r\nthe Kaan bring him great presents of gold and silver, and pearls\r\nand gems, and rich textures of divers kinds. And this they do that\r\nthe Emperor throughout the year may have abundance of treasure and\r\nenjoyment without care. And the people also make presents to each other\r\nof white things, and embrace and kiss and make merry, and wish each\r\nother happiness and good luck for the coming year. On that day, I can\r\nassure you, among the customary presents there shall be offered to the\r\nKaan from various quarters more than 100,000 white horses, beautiful\r\nanimals, and richly caparisoned. [And you must know ’tis their custom\r\nin offering presents to the Great Kaan (at least when the province\r\nmaking the present is able to do so), to present nine times nine\r\narticles. For instance, if a province sends horses, it sends nine times\r\nnine or 81 horses; of gold, nine times nine pieces of gold, and so\r\nwith stuffs or whatever else the present may consist of.]{2}\r\n\r\nOn that day also, the whole of the Kaan’s elephants, amounting fully to\r\n5000 in number, are exhibited, all covered with rich and gay housings\r\nof inlaid cloth representing beasts and birds, whilst each of them\r\ncarries on his back two splendid coffers; all of these being filled\r\nwith the Emperor’s plate and other costly furniture required for the\r\nCourt on the occasion of the White Feast.{3} And these are followed by\r\na vast number of camels which are likewise covered with rich housings\r\nand laden with things needful for the Feast. All these are paraded\r\nbefore the Emperor, and it makes the finest sight in the world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on the morning of the Feast, before the tables are set, all\r\nthe Kings, and all the Dukes, Marquesses, Counts, Barons, Knights, and\r\nAstrologers, and Philosophers, and Leeches, and Falconers, and other\r\nofficials of sundry kinds from all the places round about, present\r\nthemselves in the Great Hall before the Emperor; whilst those who can\r\nfind no room to enter stand outside in such a position that the Emperor\r\ncan see them all well. And the whole company is marshalled in this\r\nwise. First are the Kaan’s sons, and his nephews, and the other Princes\r\nof the Blood Imperial; next to them all Kings; then Dukes, and then all\r\nothers in succession according to the degree of each. And when they are\r\nall seated, each in his proper place, then a great prelate rises and\r\nsays with a loud voice: “Bow and adore!” And as soon as he has said\r\nthis, the company bow down until their foreheads touch the earth in\r\nadoration towards the Emperor as if he were a god. And this adoration\r\nthey repeat four times, and then go to a highly decorated altar, on\r\nwhich is a vermilion tablet with the name of the Grand Kaan inscribed\r\nthereon, and a beautiful censer of gold. So they incense the tablet\r\nand the altar with great reverence, and then return each man to his\r\nseat.{4}\r\n\r\nWhen all have performed this, then the presents are offered, of which\r\nI have spoken as being so rich and costly. And after all have been\r\noffered and been seen by the Emperor, the tables are set, and all take\r\ntheir places at them with perfect order as I have already told you. And\r\nafter dinner the jugglers come in and amuse the Court as you have heard\r\nbefore; and when that is over, every man goes to his quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The first month of the year is still called by the Mongols\r\n  _Chaghan_ or _Chaghan Sara_, “the White” or the “White Month”; and\r\n  the wearing of white clothing on this festive occasion must have\r\n  been purely a Mongol custom. For when Shah Rukh’s ambassadors were\r\n  present at the New Year’s Feast at the Court of the succeeding\r\n  _Chinese_ Dynasty (2nd February, 1421) they were warned that _no\r\n  one_ must wear white, as that among the Chinese was the colour of\r\n  mourning. (_Koeppen_, I. 574, II. 309; _Cathay_, p. ccvii.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—On the mystic importance attached to the number 9 on all\r\n  such occasions among the Mongols, see _Hammer’s Golden Horde_, p.\r\n  208; _Hayton_, ch. iii. in Ramusio II.; _Not. et Ext._ XIV. Pt. I.\r\n  32; and _Strahlenberg_ (II. 210 of Amsterd. ed. 1757). Vámbéry,\r\n  speaking of the _Ḳálín_ or marriage price among the Uzbegs, says:\r\n  “The question is always how many times _nine_ sheep, cows, camels,\r\n  or horses, or how many times nine ducats (as is the custom in\r\n  a town), the father is to receive for giving up his daughter.”\r\n  (_Sketches of Cent. Asia_, p. 103.) Sheikh Ibrahim of Darband,\r\n  making offerings to Timur, presented _nines_ of everything else,\r\n  but of slaves _eight_ only. “Where is the ninth?” enquired the\r\n  court official. “Who but I myself?” said the Sheikh, and so won the\r\n  heart of Timur. (_A. Arabsiadis ... Timuri Hist._ p. 357.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The elephant stud of the Son of Heaven had dwindled till\r\n  in 1862 Dr. Rennie found but one animal; now none remain. [Dr. S.\r\n  W. Williams writes (_Middle Kingdom_, I. pp. 323–324): “Elephants\r\n  are kept at Peking for show, and are used to draw the state chariot\r\n  when the Emperor goes to worship at the Altars of Heaven and Earth,\r\n  but the sixty animals seen in the days of Kienlung, by Bell, have\r\n  since dwindled to one or two. Van Braam met six going into Peking,\r\n  sent thither from Yun-Nan.” These were no doubt carrying tribute\r\n  from Burmah.—H. C.] It is worth noticing that the housings of cut\r\n  cloth or _appliqué_ work (“_draps entaillez_”) are still in fashion\r\n  in India for the caparison of elephants.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—In 1263 Kúblái adopted the Chinese fashion of worshipping\r\n  the tablets of his own ancestors, and probably at the same time the\r\n  adoration of his own tablet by his subjects was introduced. Van\r\n  Braam ingenuously relates how he and the rest of the Dutch Legation\r\n  of 1794 performed the adoration of the Emperor’s Tablet on first\r\n  entering China, much in the way described in the text.\r\n\r\n  There is a remarkable amplification in the last paragraph of the\r\n  chapter as given by Ramusio: “When all are in their proper places,\r\n  a certain great personage, or high prelate as it were, gets up\r\n  and says with a loud voice: ‘Bow yourselves and adore!’ On this\r\n  immediately all bend and bow the forehead to the ground. Then the\r\n  prelate says again: ‘God save and keep our Lord the Emperor, with\r\n  length of years and with mirth and happiness.’ And all answer: ‘So\r\n  may it be!’ And then again the prelate says: ‘May God increase and\r\n  augment his Empire and its prosperity more and more, and keep all\r\n  his subjects in peace and goodwill, and may all things go well\r\n  throughout his Dominion!’ And all again respond: ‘So may it be!’\r\n  And this adoration is repeated four times.”\r\n\r\n  One of Pauthier’s most interesting notes is a long extract from the\r\n  official Directory of Ceremonial under the Mongol Dynasty, which\r\n  admirably illustrates the chapters we have last read. I borrow\r\n  a passage regarding this adoration: “The Musician’s Song having\r\n  ceased, the Ministers shall recite with a loud voice the following\r\n  Prayer: ‘Great Heaven, that extendest over all! Earth which art\r\n  under the guidance of Heaven! We invoke You and beseech You to heap\r\n  blessings upon the Emperor and the Empress! Grant that they may\r\n  live ten thousand, a hundred thousand years!’\r\n\r\n  “Then the first Chamberlain shall respond: ‘May it be as the prayer\r\n  hath said!’ The Ministers shall then prostrate themselves, and when\r\n  they rise return to their places, and take a cup or two of wine.”\r\n\r\n  The K’o-tow (_Khéu-théu_) which appears repeatedly in this\r\n  ceremonial and which in our text is indicated by the four\r\n  prostrations, was, Pauthier alleges, not properly a Chinese form,\r\n  but only introduced by the Mongols. Baber indeed speaks of it as\r\n  the _Ḳornish_, a Moghul ceremony, in which originally “the person\r\n  who performed it kneeled nine times and touched the earth with his\r\n  brow each time.” He describes it as performed very elaborately\r\n  (nine times _twice_) by his younger uncle in visiting the elder.\r\n  But in its essentials the ceremony must have been of old date\r\n  at the Chinese Court; for the Annals of the Thang Dynasty, in a\r\n  passage cited by M. Pauthier himself,[1] mention that ambassadors\r\n  from the famous Hárún ar Rashíd in 798 had to perform the “ceremony\r\n  of kneeling and striking the forehead against the ground.” And M.\r\n  Pauthier can scarcely be right in saying that the practice was\r\n  disused by the Ming Dynasty and only reintroduced by the Manchus;\r\n  for in the story of Shah Rukh’s embassy the performance of the\r\n  K’o-tow occurs repeatedly.\r\n\r\n  [“It is interesting to note,” writes Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p.\r\n  22), “that in A.D. 981 the Chinese Envoy, Wang Yen-tê, sent to the\r\n  Uigur Prince of Kao-chang, refused to make genuflexions (_pai_) to\r\n  him, as being contrary to the established usages as regards envoys.\r\n  The prince and his family, however, on receiving the envoy, all\r\n  faced eastward (towards Peking) and made an obeisance (_pai_) on\r\n  receiving the imperial presents (_shou-tzŭ_).” (_Ma Twan-lin_, Bk.\r\n  336, 13.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  (_Gaubil_, 142; _Van Braam_, I. 20–21; _Baber_, 106; _N. et E._\r\n  XIV. Pt. I. 405, 407, 418.)\r\n\r\n  The enumeration of _four_ prostrations in the text is, I fancy,\r\n  quite correct. There are several indications that this number was\r\n  used instead of the three times three of later days. Thus Carpini,\r\n  when introduced to the Great Kaan, “bent the left knee four times.”\r\n  And in the Chinese bridal ceremony of “Worshipping the Tablets,”\r\n  the genuflexion is made four times. At the court of Sháh Abbás an\r\n  obeisance evidently identical was repeated four times. (_Carp._\r\n  759; _Doolittle_, p. 60; _P. Della Valle_, I. 646.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] _Gaubil_, cited in _Pauthier’s Hist. des Relations Politiques de la\r\n    Chine_, etc., p. 226.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  CONCERNING THE TWELVE THOUSAND BARONS WHO RECEIVE ROBES OF CLOTH OF\r\n      GOLD FROM THE EMPEROR ON THE GREAT FESTIVALS, THIRTEEN CHANGES\r\n      A-PIECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that the Great Kaan hath set apart 12,000 of his\r\nmen who are distinguished by the name of _Keshican_, as I have told\r\nyou before; and on each of these 12,000 Barons he bestows thirteen\r\nchanges of raiment, which are all different from one another: I mean\r\nthat in one set the 12,000 are all of one colour; the next 12,000 of\r\nanother colour, and so on; so that they are of thirteen different\r\ncolours. These robes are garnished with gems and pearls and other\r\nprecious things in a very rich and costly manner.{1} And along with\r\neach of these changes of raiment, _i.e._ 13 times in the year, he\r\nbestows on each of those 12,000 Barons a fine golden girdle of great\r\nrichness and value, and likewise a pair of boots of _Camut_, that is to\r\nsay of _Borgal_, curiously wrought with silver thread; insomuch that\r\nwhen they are clothed in these dresses every man of them looks like a\r\nking!{2} And there is an established order as to which dress is to be\r\nworn at each of those thirteen feasts. The Emperor himself also has\r\nhis thirteen suits corresponding to those of his Barons; in _colour_,\r\nI mean (though his are grander, richer, and costlier), so that he is\r\nalways arrayed in the same colour as his Barons, who are, as it were,\r\nhis comrades. And you may see that all this costs an amount which it is\r\nscarcely possible to calculate.\r\n\r\nNow I have told you of the thirteen changes of raiment received from\r\nthe Prince by those 12,000 Barons, amounting in all to 156,000 suits of\r\nso great cost and value, to say nothing of the girdles and the boots\r\nwhich are also worth a great sum of money. All this the Great Lord\r\nhath ordered, that he may attach the more of grandeur and dignity to\r\nhis festivals.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must mention another thing that I had forgotten, but which\r\nyou will be astonished to learn from this Book. You must know that on\r\nthe Feast Day a great Lion is led to the Emperor’s presence, and as\r\nsoon as it sees him it lies down before him with every sign of the\r\ngreatest veneration, as if it acknowledged him for its lord; and it\r\nremains there lying before him, and entirely unchained. Truly this must\r\nseem a strange story to those who have not seen the thing!{3}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—On the _Keshican_, see note 1 to chap. xii., and on the\r\n  changes of raiment note 3 to chap. xiv., and the remarks there as\r\n  to the number of distributions. I confess that the stress laid upon\r\n  the number 13 in this chapter makes the supposition of error more\r\n  difficult. But there is something odd and unintelligible about the\r\n  whole of the chapter except the last paragraph. For the 12,000\r\n  _Keshican_ are here all elevated to _Barons_; and at the same time\r\n  the statement about their changes of raiment seems to be merely\r\n  that already made in chapter xiv. This repetition occurs only in\r\n  the French MSS., but as it is in all these we cannot reject it.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The words _Camut_ and _Borgal_ appear both to be used\r\n  here for what we call _Russia-Leather_. The latter word in one\r\n  form or another, _Bolghár, Borgháli_, or _Bulkál_, is the term\r\n  applied to that material to this day nearly all over Asia. Ibn\r\n  Batuta says that in travelling during winter from Constantinople\r\n  to the Wolga he had to put on three pairs of boots, one of wool\r\n  (which we should call stockings), a second of wadded linen, and a\r\n  third of _Borgháli_, “_i.e._ of horse-leather lined with wolf-skin.”\r\n  Horse-leather seems to be still the favourite material for boots\r\n  among all the Tartar nations. The name was undoubtedly taken from\r\n  _Bolghar_ on the Wolga, the people of which are traditionally said\r\n  to have invented the art of preparing skins in that manner. This\r\n  manufacture is still one of the staple trades of Kazan, the city\r\n  which in position and importance is the nearest representative of\r\n  Bolghar now.\r\n\r\n  _Camut_ is explained by Klaproth to be “leather made from the\r\n  back-skin of a camel.” It appears in Johnson’s Persian Dictionary\r\n  as _Kámú_, but I do not know from what language it originally\r\n  comes. The word is in the Latin column of the Petrarchian\r\n  Vocabulary with the Persian rendering _Sagri_. This shows us\r\n  what is meant, for _Saghrí_ is just our word _Shagreen_, and is\r\n  applied to a fine leather granulated in that way, which is much\r\n  used for boots and the like by the people of Central Asia. [In\r\n  Turkish _ṣāghri_ or _saghri_ is the name both for the buttocks of\r\n  a horse and the leather called _shagreen_ prepared with them. (See\r\n  _Devic, Dict. Étym._)—H. C.] In the commercial lists of our Indian\r\n  north-west frontier we find as synonymous _Saghri_ or _Kímukht_,\r\n  “Horse or Ass-hide.” No doubt this latter word is a form of _Kámú_\r\n  or _Camut_. It appears (as _Keimukht_, “a sort of leather”) in a\r\n  detail of imports to Aden given by _Ibn al Wardi_, a geographer of\r\n  the 13th century.\r\n\r\n  Instead of Camut, Ramusio has _Camoscia_, _i.e._ Chamois, and the\r\n  same seems to be in all the editions based on Fra Pipino’s version.\r\n  It may be a misrendering of _camutum_ or _camutium_; or is there\r\n  any real connexion between the Oriental _Kámú Kímukht_, and the\r\n  Italian _camoscia_? (_I. B._ II. 445; _Klapr. Mém._ vol. III.;\r\n  _Davies’s Trade Report_, App. p. ccxx.; _Vámbéry’s Travels_, 423;\r\n  _Not. et Ext._ II. 43.)\r\n\r\n  Fraehn (writing in 1832) observes that he knew no use of the word\r\n  _Bolghár_, in the sense of Russian leather, older than the 17th\r\n  century. But we see that both Marco and Ibn Batuta use it. (_F. on\r\n  the Wolga Bulghars_, pp. 8–9.)\r\n\r\n  Pauthier in a note (p. 285) gives a list of the garments issued to\r\n  certain officials on these ceremonial occasions under the Mongols,\r\n  and sure enough this list includes “pairs of boots in red leather.”\r\n  Odoric particularly mentions the broad golden girdles worn at the\r\n  Kaan’s court.\r\n\r\n  [La Curne, _Dict._, has _Bulga_, leather bag; old Gallic word from\r\n  which are derived _bouge_ et _bougete, bourse_; he adds in a note,\r\n  “Festus writes: ‘_Bulgas_ galli sacculos scorteos vocant.’”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—“Then come mummers leading lions, which they cause to\r\n  salute the Lord with reverence.” (_Odoric_, p. 143.) A lion sent by\r\n  Mirza Baisangar, one of the Princes of Timur’s House, accompanied\r\n  Shah Rukh’s embassy as a present to the Emperor; and like presents\r\n  were frequently repeated. (See _Amyot_, XIV. 37, 38.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n         HOW THE GREAT KAAN ENJOINETH HIS PEOPLE TO SUPPLY HIM\r\n                              WITH GAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three months of December, January, and February, during which the\r\nEmperor resides at his Capital City, are assigned for hunting and\r\nfowling, to the extent of some 40 days’ journey round the city; and\r\nit is ordained that the larger game taken be sent to the Court. To be\r\nmore particular: of all the larger beasts of the chase, such as boars,\r\nroebucks, bucks, stags, lions, bears, etc., the greater part of what\r\nis taken has to be sent, and feathered game likewise. The animals are\r\ngutted and despatched to the Court on carts. This is done by all the\r\npeople within 20 or 30 days’ journey, and the quantity so despatched\r\nis immense. Those at a greater distance cannot send the game, but they\r\nhave to send the skins after tanning them, and these are employed in\r\nthe making of equipments for the Emperor’s army.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—So Magaillans: “Game is so abundant, especially at the\r\n  capital, that every year during the three winter months you see\r\n  at different places, intended for despatch thither, besides great\r\n  piles of every sort of wildfowl, rows of four-footed game of a\r\n  gunshot or two in length: the animals being all frozen and standing\r\n  on their feet. Among other species you see three sundry kinds\r\n  of bears ... and great abundance of other animals, as stags and\r\n  deer of different sorts, boars, elks, hares, rabbits, squirrels,\r\n  wild-cats, rats, geese, ducks, very fine jungle-fowl, etc., and all\r\n  so cheap that I never could have believed it” (pp. 177–178). As\r\n  this writer mentions _wild-cats_, we may presume that the “lions”\r\n  of Polo also were destined to be eaten.\r\n\r\n  [“Kubilai Khan kept a whole army, 14,000 men, huntsmen, distributed\r\n  in Peking and other cities in the present province of Chili\r\n  (_Yuen-shi_). The Khan used to hunt in the Peking plain from the\r\n  beginning of spring, until his departure to Shang-tu. There are in\r\n  the Peking department many low and marshy places, stretching often\r\n  to a considerable extent and abounding in game. In the biography\r\n  of _Ai-sie_ (_Yuen shi_, chap. cxxxiv.), who was a Christian, it\r\n  is mentioned that Kubilai was hunting also in the department of\r\n  Pao-ting fu.” (_Palladius_, p. 45.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n       OF THE LIONS AND LEOPARDS AND WOLVES THAT THE KAAN KEEPS\r\n                            FOR THE CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor hath numbers of leopards{1} trained to the chase, and hath\r\nalso a great many lynxes taught in like manner to catch game, and which\r\nafford excellent sport.{2} He hath also several great Lions, bigger\r\nthan those of Babylonia, beasts whose skins are coloured in the most\r\nbeautiful way, being striped all along the sides with black, red, and\r\nwhite. These are trained to catch boars and wild cattle, bears, wild\r\nasses, stags, and other great or fierce beasts. And ’tis a rare sight,\r\nI can tell you, to see those lions giving chase to such beasts as I\r\nhave mentioned! When they are to be so employed the Lions are taken\r\nout in a covered cart, and every Lion has a little doggie with him.\r\n[They are obliged to approach the game against the wind, otherwise the\r\nanimals would scent the approach of the Lion and be off.]{3}\r\n\r\nThere are also a great number of eagles, all broken to catch wolves,\r\nfoxes, deer, and wild goats, and they do catch them in great numbers.\r\nBut those especially that are trained to wolf-catching are very large\r\nand powerful birds, and no wolf is able to get away from them.{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The Cheeta or Hunting-Leopard, still kept for the chase\r\n  by native noblemen in India, is an animal very distinct from the\r\n  true leopard. It is much more lanky and long-legged than the pure\r\n  felines, is unable to climb trees, and has claws only partially\r\n  retractile. Wood calls it a link between the feline and canine\r\n  races. One thousand Cheetas were attached to Akbar’s hunting\r\n  establishment; and the chief one, called Semend-Manik, was carried\r\n  to the field in a palankin with a kettledrum beaten before him.\r\n  Boldensel in the first half of the 14th century speaks of the\r\n  Cheeta as habitually used in Cyprus; but, indeed, a hundred years\r\n  before, these animals had been constantly employed by the Emperor\r\n  Frederic II. in Italy, and accompanied him on all his marches. They\r\n  were introduced into France in the latter part of the 15th century,\r\n  and frequently employed by Lewis XI., Charles VIII., and Lewis XII.\r\n  The leopards were kept in a ditch of the Castle of Amboise, and the\r\n  name still borne by a gate hard by, _Porte des Lions_, is supposed\r\n  to be due to that circumstance. The _Mœurs et Usages du Moyen\r\n  Age_ (Lacroix), from which I take the last facts, gives copy of a\r\n  print by John Stradanus representing a huntsman with the leopard\r\n  on his horse’s crupper, like Kúblái’s (_supra_, Bk. I. ch. lxi.);\r\n  Frederic II. used to say of his Cheetas, “they knew how to ride.”\r\n  This way of taking the Cheeta to the field had been first employed\r\n  by the Khalif Yazid, son of Moáwiyah. The Cheeta often appears in\r\n  the pattern of silk damasks of the 13th and 14th centuries, both\r\n  Asiatic and Italian. (_Ayeen Akbery_, I. 304, etc.; _Boldensel_,\r\n  in _Canisii Thesaurus_, by _Basnage_, vol. IV. p. 339; _Kington’s\r\n  Fred.

These\r\n  falconers were in front of seven horsemen, who had behind a kind\r\n  of tamed tiger at times employed by His Highness for hare-hunting,\r\n  notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary by those who are\r\n  inclined not to believe the fact. It is a thing known by everybody\r\n  here, and cannot be doubted except by those who admit that they\r\n  believe nothing of foreign customs. These tigers were each covered\r\n  with a brocade cloth—and their peaceful attitude, added to their\r\n  ferocious and savage looks, caused at the same time astonishment\r\n  and fear in the soul of those whom they looked upon. (_Journal\r\n  d’Antoine Galland_, trad. par Ch. Schefer, I. p. 135.) The Cheeta\r\n  (_Gueparda jubata_) was, according to Sir W. Jones, first employed\r\n  in hunting antelopes by Hushing, King of Persia, 865 B.C.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The word rendered Lynxes is _Leu cervers_ (G. Text), _Louz\r\n  serviers_ of Pauthier’s MS. C, though he has adopted from another\r\n  _Loups_ simply, which is certainly wrong. The _Geog. Latin_ has\r\n  “_Linceos i.e. lupos cerverios_.” There is no doubt that the\r\n  _Loup-cervier_ is the Lynx. Thus Brunetto Latini, describing the\r\n  Loup-cervier, speaks of its remarkable powers of vision, and refers\r\n  to its agency in the production of the precious stone called\r\n  _Liguire_ (_i.e._ _Ligurium_), which the ancients fancied to come\r\n  from _Lync-urium_; the tale is in Theophrastus. Yet the quaint\r\n  Bestiary of Philip de Thaun, published by Mr. Wright, identifies it\r\n  with the Greek Hyena:—\r\n\r\n      “_Hyena_ e Griu num, que nus beste apellum,\r\n       Ceo est _Lucervere_, oler fait et mult est fere.”\r\n\r\n  [The Abbé Armand David writes (_Missions Cathol._ XXI. 1889, p.\r\n  227) that there is in China, from the mountains of Manchuria to\r\n  the mountains of Tibet, a lynx called by the Chinese _T’u-pao_\r\n  (earth-coloured panther); a lynx somewhat similar to the\r\n  _loup-cervier_ is found on the western border of China, and has\r\n  been named _Lyncus Desgodinsi_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Hunting Lynxes were used at the Court of Akbar. They are also\r\n  mentioned by A. Hamilton as so used in Sind at the end of the\r\n  17th century. This author calls the animal a _Shoe-goose_! _i.e._\r\n  _Siya-gosh_ (Black-ear), the Persian name of the Lynx. It is\r\n  still occasionally used in the chase by natives of rank in India.\r\n  (_Brunetto Lat. Tresor_, p. 248; _Popular Treatises on Science\r\n  written during Mid. Ages_, 94; _Ayeen Akbery_, u.s.; _Hamilt. E.\r\n  Indies_, I. 125; _Vigne_, I. 42.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The conception of a Tiger seems almost to have dropped\r\n  out of the European mind during the Middle Ages. Thus in a\r\n  mediæval Bestiary, a chapter on the Tiger begins: “_Une Beste\r\n  est qui est apelée Tigre c’est une manière de_ Serpent.” Hence\r\n  Polo can only call the Tigers, whose portrait he draws here not\r\n  incorrectly, _Lions_. So also nearly 200 years later Barbaro gives\r\n  a like portrait, and calls the animal _Leonza_. Marsden supposes\r\n  judiciously that the confusion may have been promoted by the\r\n  ambiguity of the Persian _Sher_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Búrgút Eagle. (After Atkinson.)\r\n\r\n    “=Il a encore aiglies qe sunt afaités à prendre leus et voupes et\r\n    dain et chavriou, et en prennent assez.=”]\r\n\r\n  The Chinese pilgrim, Sung-Yun (A.D. 518), saw two young lions\r\n  at the Court of Gandhára. He remarks that the pictures of these\r\n  animals common in China, were not at all good likenesses. (_Beal_,\r\n  p. 200.)\r\n\r\n  We do not hear in modern times of Tigers trained to the chase, but\r\n  Chardin says of Persia: “In hunting the larger animals they make\r\n  use of beasts of prey trained for the purpose, _lions_, leopards,\r\n  _tigers_, panthers, ounces.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—This is perfectly correct. In Eastern Turkestan, and among\r\n  the Kirghiz to this day, eagles termed _Búrgút_ (now well known to\r\n  be the Golden Eagle) are tamed and trained to fly at wolves, foxes,\r\n  deer, wild goats, etc. A Kirghiz will give a good horse for an\r\n  eagle in which he recognises capacity for training. Mr. Atkinson\r\n  gives vivid descriptions and illustrations of this eagle (which he\r\n  calls “Bear coote”), attacking both deer and wolves. He represents\r\n  the bird as striking one claw into the neck, and the other into the\r\n  back of its large prey, and then tearing out the liver with its\r\n  beak. In justice both to Marco Polo and to Mr. Atkinson, I have\r\n  pleasure in adding a vivid account of the exploits of this bird, as\r\n  witnessed by one of my kind correspondents, the Governor-General’s\r\n  late envoy to Kashgar. And I trust Sir Douglas Forsyth will pardon\r\n  my quoting his own letter just as it stands[1]:—“Now for a story\r\n  of the _Burgoot_—Atkinson’s ‘Bearcoote.’ I think I told you it was\r\n  the Golden Eagle and supposed to attack wolves and even bears.\r\n  One day we came across a wild hog of enormous size, far bigger\r\n  than any that gave sport to the Tent Club in Bengal. The Burgoot\r\n  was immediately let loose, and went straight at the hog, which it\r\n  kicked, and flapped with its wings, and utterly _flabbergasted_,\r\n  whilst our Kashgaree companions attacked him with sticks and\r\n  brought him to the ground. As Friar Odoric would say, I, T. D.\r\n  F., have seen this with mine own eyes.”—Shaw describes the rough\r\n  treatment with which the Búrgút is tamed. Baber, when in the Bajaur\r\n  Hills, notices in his memoirs: “This day Búrgút took a deer.”\r\n  (_Timkowski_, I. 414; _Levchine_, p. 77; _Pallas_, _Voyages_,\r\n  I. 421; _J. R. A. S._ VII. 305; _Atkinson’s Siberia_, 493; and\r\n  _Amoor_, 146–147; _Shaw_, p. 157; _Baber_, p. 249.)\r\n\r\n  [The Golden Eagle (_Aquila chrysaetus_) is called at Peking _Hoy\r\n  tiao_ (black eagle).

Out of each body of 10,000 there\r\nare 2000 men who are each in charge of one or more great mastiffs, so\r\nthat the whole number of these is very large. And when the Prince goes\r\na-hunting, one of those Barons, with his 10,000 men and something like\r\n5000 dogs, goes towards the right, whilst the other goes towards the\r\nleft with his party in like manner. They move along, all abreast of\r\none another, so that the whole line extends over a full day’s journey,\r\nand no animal can escape them. Truly it is a glorious sight to see the\r\nworking of the dogs and the huntsmen on such an occasion! And as the\r\nLord rides a-fowling across the plains, you will see these big hounds\r\ncoming tearing up, one pack after a bear, another pack after a stag, or\r\nsome other beast, as it may hap, and running the game down now on this\r\nside and now on that, so that it is really a most delightful sport and\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n[The Two Brothers I have mentioned are bound by the tenure of their\r\noffice to supply the Kaan’s Court from October to the end of March with\r\n1000 head of game daily, whether of beasts or birds, and not counting\r\nquails; and also with fish to the best of their ability, allowing fish\r\nenough for three persons to reckon as equal to one head of game.]\r\n\r\nNow I have told you of the Masters of the Hounds and all about them,\r\nand next will I tell you how the Lord goes off on an expedition for the\r\nspace of three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Though this particular Bayan and Mingan are not likely to\r\n  be mentioned in history, the names are both good Mongol names;\r\n  _Bayan_ that of a great soldier under Kúblái, of whom we shall hear\r\n  afterwards; and _Mingan_ that of one of Chinghiz’s generals.\r\n\r\n  The title of “Master of the Mastiffs” belonged to a high Court\r\n  official at Constantinople in former days, _Sámsúnji Báshi_, and I\r\n  have no doubt Marco has given the exact interpretation of the title\r\n  of the two Barons: though it is difficult to trace its elements.\r\n  It is read variously _Cunici_ (_i.e._ _Kunichi_) and _Cinuci_ (_i.e._\r\n  _Chinuchi_). It is evidently a word of analogous structure to\r\n  _Kushchi_, the Master of the Falcons; _Parschi_, the Master of\r\n  the Leopards. Professor Schiefner thinks it is probably corrupted\r\n  from _Noghaichi_, which appears in Kovalevski’s Mongol Dict. as\r\n  “_chasseur qui a soins des chiens courants_.” This word occurs, he\r\n  points out, in Sanang Setzen, where Schmidt translates it _Aufseher\r\n  über Hunde_. (See _S. S._ p. 39.)\r\n\r\n  The metathesis of _Noghai_-chi into _Kuni_-chi is the only drawback\r\n  to this otherwise apt solution. We generally shall find Polo’s\r\n  Oriental words much more accurately expressed than this would\r\n  imply—as in the next chapter. I have hazarded a suggestion of\r\n  (Or. Turkish) _Chong-It-chi_, “Keeper of the Big Dogs,” which\r\n  Professor Vámbéry thinks possible. (See “_chong_, big, strong,”\r\n  in his _Tschagataische Sprachstudien_, p. 282, and note in _Lord\r\n  Strangford’s Selected Writings_, II. 169.) In East Turkestan they\r\n  call the Chinese _Chong Káfir_, “The Big Heathen.” This would\r\n  exactly correspond to the rendering of Pipino’s Latin translation,\r\n  “_hoc est canum magnorum Praefecti_.” _Chinuchi_ again would be\r\n  (in Mongol) “Wolf-keepers.” It is at least possible that the great\r\n  dogs which Polo terms mastiffs may have been known by such a name.\r\n  We apply the term Wolf-dog to several varieties, and in Macbeth’s\r\n  enumeration we have—\r\n\r\n      ————“Hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\r\n      Shoughs, water rugs, and _Demi-Wolves_.”\r\n\r\n  Lastly the root-word may be the Chinese _Kiuen_, “dog,” as Pauthier\r\n  says. The mastiffs were probably Tibetan, but may have come through\r\n  China, and brought a name with them, like _Boule-dogues_ in France.\r\n\r\n  [Palladius (p. 46) says that _Chinuchi_ or _Cunici_ “have no\r\n  resemblance with any of the names found in the _Yuen shi_, ch.\r\n  xcix., article _Ping chi_ (military organisation), and relating to\r\n  the hunting staff of the Khan, viz.: _Si pao ch’i_ (falconers), _Ho\r\n  r ch’i_ (archers), and _Ke lien ch’i_ (probably those who managed\r\n  the hounds).”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n             HOW THE EMPEROR GOES ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he has stopped at his capital city those three months that I\r\nmentioned, to wit, December, January, February, he starts off on\r\nthe 1st day of March, and travels southward towards the Ocean Sea,\r\na journey of two days.{1} He takes with him full 10,000 falconers,\r\nand some 500 gerfalcons besides peregrines, sakers, and other hawks\r\nin great numbers; and goshawks also to fly at the water-fowl.{2} But\r\ndo not suppose that he keeps all these together by him; they are\r\ndistributed about, hither and thither, one hundred together, or two\r\nhundred at the utmost, as he thinks proper. But they are always fowling\r\nas they advance, and the most part of the quarry taken is carried to\r\nthe Emperor. And let me tell you when he goes thus a-fowling with his\r\ngerfalcons and other hawks, he is attended by full 10,000 men who are\r\ndisposed in couples; and these are called _Toscaol_, which is as much\r\nas to say, “Watchers.” And the name describes their business.{3} They\r\nare posted from spot to spot, always in couples, and thus they cover a\r\ngreat deal of ground! Every man of them is provided with a whistle and\r\nhood, so as to be able to call in a hawk and hold it in hand. And when\r\nthe Emperor makes a cast, there is no need that he follow it up, for\r\nthose men I speak of keep so good a look out that they never lose sight\r\nof the birds, and if these have need of help they are ready to render\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAll the Emperor’s hawks, and those of the Barons as well, have a little\r\nlabel attached to the leg to mark them, on which is written the names\r\nof the owner and the keeper of the bird. And in this way the hawk, when\r\ncaught, is at once identified and handed over to its owner. But if not,\r\nthe bird is carried to a certain Baron, who is styled the _Bularguchi_,\r\nwhich is as much as to say “The Keeper of Lost Property.” And I tell\r\nyou that whatever may be found without a known owner, whether it be a\r\nhorse, or a sword, or a hawk, or what not, it is carried to that Baron\r\nstraightway, and he takes charge of it. And if the finder neglects\r\nto carry his trover to the Baron, the latter punishes him. Likewise\r\nthe loser of any article goes to the Baron, and if the thing be in\r\nhis hands it is immediately given up to the owner. Moreover, the said\r\nBaron always pitches on the highest spot of the camp, with his banner\r\ndisplayed, in order that those who have lost or found anything may have\r\nno difficulty in finding their way to him. Thus nothing can be lost but\r\nit shall be incontinently found and restored.{4}\r\n\r\nAnd so the Emperor follows this road that I have mentioned, leading\r\nalong in the vicinity of the Ocean Sea (which is within two days’\r\njourney of his capital city, Cambaluc), and as he goes there is many\r\na fine sight to be seen, and plenty of the very best entertainment in\r\nhawking; in fact, there is no sport in the world to equal it!\r\n\r\nThe Emperor himself is carried upon four elephants in a fine chamber\r\nmade of timber, lined inside with plates of beaten gold, and outside\r\nwith lions’ skins [for he always travels in this way on his fowling\r\nexpeditions, because he is troubled with gout]. He always keeps beside\r\nhim a dozen of his choicest gerfalcons, and is attended by several of\r\nhis Barons, who ride on horseback alongside. And sometimes, as they may\r\nbe going along, and the Emperor from his chamber is holding discourse\r\nwith the Barons, one of the latter shall exclaim: “Sire! Look out for\r\nCranes!” Then the Emperor instantly has the top of his chamber thrown\r\nopen, and having marked the cranes he casts one of his gerfalcons,\r\nwhichever he pleases; and often the quarry is struck within his view,\r\nso that he has the most exquisite sport and diversion, there as he\r\nsits in his chamber or lies on his bed; and all the Barons with him\r\nget the enjoyment of it likewise! So it is not without reason I tell\r\nyou that I do not believe there ever existed in the world or ever will\r\nexist, a man with such sport and enjoyment as he has, or with such rare\r\nopportunities.{5}\r\n\r\nAnd when he has travelled till he reaches a place called CACHAR\r\nMODUN,{6} there he finds his tents pitched, with the tents of his Sons,\r\nand his Barons, and those of his Ladies and theirs, so that there\r\nshall be full 10,000 tents in all, and all fine and rich ones. And I\r\nwill tell you how his own quarters are disposed. The tent in which he\r\nholds his courts is large enough to give cover easily to a thousand\r\nsouls. It is pitched with its door to the south, and the Barons and\r\nKnights remain in waiting in it, whilst the Lord abides in another\r\nclose to it on the west side. When he wishes to speak with any one he\r\ncauses the person to be summoned to that other tent. Immediately behind\r\nthe great tent there is a fine large chamber where the Lord sleeps;\r\nand there are also many other tents and chambers, but they are not\r\nin contact with the Great Tent as these are. The two audience-tents\r\nand the sleeping-chamber are constructed in this way. Each of the\r\naudience-tents has three poles, which are of spice-wood, and are most\r\nartfully covered with lions’ skins, striped with black and white and\r\nred, so that they do not suffer from any weather. All three apartments\r\nare also covered outside with similar skins of striped lions, a\r\nsubstance that lasts for ever.{7} And inside they are all lined with\r\nermine and sable, these two being the finest and most costly furs in\r\nexistence. For a robe of sable, large enough to line a mantle, is worth\r\n2000 bezants of gold, or 1000 at least, and this kind of skin is called\r\nby the Tartars “The King of Furs.” The beast itself is about the size\r\nof a marten.{8} These two furs of which I speak are applied and inlaid\r\nso exquisitely, that it is really something worth seeing. All the\r\ntent-ropes are of silk. And in short I may say that those tents, to wit\r\nthe two audience-halls and the sleeping-chamber, are so costly that it\r\nis not every king could pay for them.\r\n\r\nRound about these tents are others, also fine ones and beautifully\r\npitched, in which are the Emperor’s ladies, and the ladies of the\r\nother princes and officers. And then there are the tents for the hawks\r\nand their keepers, so that altogether the number of tents there on\r\nthe plain is something wonderful. To see the many people that are\r\nthronging to and fro on every side and every day there, you would take\r\nthe camp for a good big city. For you must reckon the Leeches, and the\r\nAstrologers, and the Falconers, and all the other attendants on so\r\ngreat a company; and add that everybody there has his whole family with\r\nhim, for such is their custom.\r\n\r\nThe Lord remains encamped there until the spring, and all that time he\r\ndoes nothing but go hawking round about among the canebrakes along the\r\nlakes and rivers that abound in that region, and across fine plains on\r\nwhich are plenty of cranes and swans, and all sorts of other fowl. The\r\nother gentry of the camp also are never done with hunting and hawking,\r\nand every day they bring home great store of venison and feathered game\r\nof all sorts. Indeed, without having witnessed it, you would never\r\nbelieve what quantities of game are taken, and what marvellous sport\r\nand diversion they all have whilst they are in camp there.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing I should mention; to wit, that for 20 days’\r\njourney round the spot nobody is allowed, be he who he may, to keep\r\nhawks or hounds, though anywhere else whosoever list may keep them. And\r\nfurthermore throughout all the Emperor’s territories, nobody however\r\naudacious dares to hunt any of these four animals, to wit, hare,\r\nstag, buck, and roe, from the month of March to the month of October.\r\nAnybody who should do so would rue it bitterly. But those people are\r\nso obedient to their Lord’s command, that even if a man were to find\r\none of those animals asleep by the roadside he would not touch it\r\nfor the world! And thus the game multiplies at such a rate that the\r\nwhole country swarms with it, and the Emperor gets as much as he could\r\ndesire. Beyond the term I have mentioned, however, to wit that from\r\nMarch to October, everybody may take these animals as he list.{9}\r\n\r\nAfter the Emperor has tarried in that place, enjoying his sport as I\r\nhave related, from March to the middle of May, he moves with all his\r\npeople, and returns straight to his capital city of Cambaluc (which is\r\nalso the capital of Cathay, as you have been told), but all the while\r\ncontinuing to take his diversion in hunting and hawking as he goes\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“_Vait vers midi jusques à la Mer Occeane, ou il y a\r\n  deux journées._” It is not possible in any way to reconcile this\r\n  description as it stands with truth, though I do not see much room\r\n  for doubt as to the direction of the excursion. Peking is 100\r\n  miles as the crow flies from the nearest point of the coast, at\r\n  least six or seven days’ march for such a camp, and the direction\r\n  is south-east, or nearly so. The last circumstance would not be\r\n  very material as Polo’s compass-bearings are not very accurate. We\r\n  shall find that he makes the general line of bearing from Peking\r\n  towards Kiangnan, _Sciloc_ or S. East, hence his _Midi_ ought in\r\n  consistency to represent _S. West_, an impossible direction for\r\n  the Ocean. It is remarkable that Ramusio has _Greco_ or _N. East_,\r\n  which would by the same relative correction represent _East_.\r\n  And other circumstances point to the frontier of Liao-tong as\r\n  the direction of this excursion. Leaving the _two days_ out of\r\n  question, therefore, I should suppose the “Ocean Sea” to be struck\r\n  at Shan-hai-kwan near the terminus of the Great Wall, and that the\r\n  site of the standing hunting-camp is in the country to the north\r\n  of that point. The Jesuit Verbiest accompanied the Emperor Kanghi\r\n  on a tour in this direction in 1682, and almost immediately after\r\n  passing the Wall the Emperor and his party seem to have struck\r\n  off to the left for sport. Kúblái started on the “1st of March,”\r\n  probably however the 1st of the second Chinese month. Kanghi\r\n  started from Peking on the 23rd of March, on the hunting-journey\r\n  just referred to.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—We are told that Bajazet had 7000 falconers and 6000\r\n  dog-keepers; whilst Sultan Mahomed Tughlak of India in the\r\n  generation following Polo’s, is said to have had 10,000 falconers,\r\n  and 3000 other attendants as beaters. (_Not. et Ext._ XIII. p. 185.)\r\n\r\n  The Oriental practice seems to have assigned one man to the\r\n  attendance on every hawk. This Kaempfer says was the case at the\r\n  Court of Persia at the beginning of last century. There were about\r\n  800 hawks, and each had a special keeper. The same was the case\r\n  with the Emperor Kanghi’s hawking establishment, according to\r\n  Gerbillon. (_Am. Exot._ p. 83; _Gerb._ 1st Journey, in _Duhalde_.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The French MSS. read _Toscaor_; the reading in the text\r\n  I take from Ramusio. It is Turki, _Tosḳáúl_, توسقاول, defined as\r\n  “Gardien, surveillant de la route; Wächter, Wache, Wegehüter.” (See\r\n  _Zenker_, and _Pavet de Courteille_.) The word is perhaps also\r\n  Mongol, for Rémusat has _Tosiyal_ = “Veille.” (_Mél. As._ I. 231.)\r\n  Such an example of Polo’s correctness both in the form and meaning\r\n  of a Turki word is worthy of especial note, and shows how little he\r\n  merits the wild and random treatment which has been often applied\r\n  to the solution of like phrases in his book.\r\n\r\n  [Palladius (p. 47) says that he has heard from men well acquainted\r\n  with the customs of the Mongols, that at the present day in\r\n  “battues,” the leaders of the two flanks which surround the game,\r\n  are called _toscaul_ in Mongol.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The remark in the previous note might be repeated here. The\r\n  _Bularguji_ was an officer of the Mongol camp, whose duties are\r\n  thus described by Mahomed Hindú Shah in a work on the offices of\r\n  the Perso-Mongol Court. “He is an officer appointed by the Council\r\n  of State, who, at the time when the camp is struck, goes over the\r\n  ground with his servants, and collects slaves of either sex, or\r\n  cattle, such as horses, camels, oxen, and asses, that have been\r\n  left behind, and retains them until the owners appear and prove\r\n  their claim to the property, when he makes it over to them. The\r\n  _Bularguji_ sticks up a flag by his tent or hut to enable people to\r\n  find him, and so recover their lost property.” (_Golden Horde_, p.\r\n  245.) And in the Appendix to that work (p. 476) there is a copy of\r\n  a warrant to such a Bularguji or Provost Marshal. The derivation\r\n  appears therein as from _Bularghu_, “Lost property.” Here again\r\n  it was impossible to give both form and meaning of the word more\r\n  exactly than Polo has done. Though Hammer writes these terminations\r\n  in _ji_ (_dschi_), I believe _chi_ (_tschi_) is preferable. We\r\n  have this same word _Bularghu_ in a grant of privileges to the\r\n  Venetians by the Ilkhan Abusaid, 22nd December, 1320, which has\r\n  been published by M. Mas Latrie: “_Item, se algun cavalo_ bolargo\r\n  _fosse trovado apreso de algun vostro veneciano_,” etc.—“If any\r\n  stray horse shall be found in the possession of a Venetian,” etc.\r\n  (See _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, 1870—_tirage à part_, p. 26.)\r\n\r\n  [“There are two Mongol terms, which resemble this word\r\n  _Bularguchi_, viz. _Balagachi_ and _Buluguchi_. But the first was\r\n  the name used for the door-keeper of the tent of the Khan. By\r\n  Buluguchi the Mongols understood a hunter and especially sable\r\n  hunters. No one of these terms can be made consistent with the\r\n  accounts given by M. Polo regarding the Bularguchi. In the _Kui\r\n  sin tsa shi_, written by Chow Mi, in the former part of the 14th\r\n  century, interesting particulars regarding Mongol hunting are\r\n  found.” (_Palladius_, 47.) In chapter 101, _Djan-ch’i_, of the\r\n  _Yuen-shi_, Falconers are called _Ying fang pu lie_, and a certain\r\n  class of the Falconers are termed _Bo-lan-ghi_. (_Bretschneider,\r\n  Med. Res._ I. p. 188.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—A like description is given by Odoric of the mode in which\r\n  a successor of Kúblái travelled between Cambaluc and Shangtu, with\r\n  his falcons also in the chamber beside him. What Kúblái had adopted\r\n  as an indulgence to his years and gout, his successors probably\r\n  followed as a precedent without these excuses.\r\n\r\n  [With regard to the gout of Kúblái Khan, Palladius (p. 48) writes:\r\n  “In the Corean history allusion is made twice to the Khan’s\r\n  suffering from this disease. Under the year 1267, it is there\r\n  recorded that in the 9th month, envoys of the Khan with a letter\r\n  to the King arrived in Corea. Kubilai asked for the skin of the\r\n  _Akirho munho_, a fish resembling a cow. The envoy was informed\r\n  that, as the Khan suffered from swollen feet it would be useful for\r\n  him to wear boots made of the skin of this animal, and in the 10th\r\n  month, the king of Corea forwarded to the Khan seventeen skins of\r\n  it. It is further recorded in the Corean history, that in the 8th\r\n  month of 1292, sorcerers and _Shaman_ women from Corea were sent at\r\n  the request of the Khan to cure him of a disease of the feet and\r\n  hands. At that time the king of Corea was also in Peking, and the\r\n  sorcerers and Shaman women were admitted during an audience the\r\n  King had of the Khan. They took the Khan’s hands and feet and began\r\n  to recite exorcisms, whilst Kubilai was laughing.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—Marsden and Pauthier identify Cachar Modun with _Tchakiri\r\n  Mondou_, or _Moudon_, which appears in D’Anville’s atlas as the\r\n  title of a “Levée de terre naturelle,” in the extreme east of\r\n  Manchuria, and in lat. 44°, between the Khinga Lake and the sea.\r\n  This position is out of the question. It is more than 900 miles,\r\n  _in a straight line_ from Peking, and the mere journey thither and\r\n  back would have taken Kúblái’s camp something like six months. The\r\n  name _Kachar Modun_ is probably Mongol, and as _Katzar_ is = “land,\r\n  region,” and _Modun_ = “wood” or “tree,” a fair interpretation lies\r\n  on the surface. Such a name indeed has little individuality. But\r\n  the Jesuit maps have a _Modun Khotan_ (“Wood-ville”) just about\r\n  the locality supposed, viz. in the region north of the eastern\r\n  extremity of the Great Wall.\r\n\r\n  [Captain Gill writes (_River of Golden Sand_, I. p. 111): “This\r\n  country around Urh-Chuang is admirably described [in _Marco Polo_,\r\n  pp. 403, 406], and I should almost imagine that the Kaan must have\r\n  set off south-east from Peking, and enjoyed some of his hawking not\r\n  far from here, before he travelled to Cachar Modun, wherever that\r\n  may have been.”\r\n\r\n  “With respect to Cachar Modun, Marco Polo intends perhaps by\r\n  this name Ho-si wu, which place, together with Yang-ts’un, were\r\n  comprised in the general name _Ma t’ou_ (perhaps the _Modun_\r\n  of M. Polo). Ma-t’ou is even now a general term for a jetty in\r\n  Chinese. Ho-si in the Mongol spelling was Ha-shin. D’Ohsson, in his\r\n  translation of Rashid-eddin renders _Ho-si_ by _Co-shi_ (_Hist.\r\n  des Mongols_, I. p. 95), but Rashid in that case speaks not of\r\n  Ho-si wu, but of the Tangut Empire, which in Chinese was called\r\n  Ho-si, meaning west of the (Yellow) River. (See _supra_, p. 205).\r\n  Ho-si wu, as well as Yang-ts’un, both exist even now as villages\r\n  on the Pei-ho River, and near the first ancient walls can be seen.\r\n  Ho-si wu means: ‘Custom’s barrier west of the (Pei-ho) river.’”\r\n  (_Palladius_, p. 45.) This identification cannot be accepted on\r\n  account of the position of Ho-si wu. —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—I suppose the best accessible illustration of the Kaan’s\r\n  great tent may be that in which the Emperor Kienlung received Lord\r\n  Macartney in the same region in 1793, of which one view is given in\r\n  Staunton’s plates. Another exists in the Staunton Collection in the\r\n  B. M., of which I give a reduced sketch.\r\n\r\n  Kúblái’s great tent, after all, was but a fraction of the size\r\n  of Akbar’s audience-tents, the largest of which held 10,000\r\n  people, and took 1000 _farráshes_ a week’s work to pitch it, with\r\n  machines. But perhaps the manner of _holding_ people is differently\r\n  estimated. (_Aín Akb._ 53.)\r\n\r\n  In the description of the tent-poles, Pauthier’s text has “_trois\r\n  coulombes de fust_ de pieces _moult bien encuierées_,” etc. The G.\r\n  T. has “_de leing_ d’especies _mout bien curés_,” etc. The Crusca,\r\n  “_di_ spezie _molto belle_,” and Ramusio going off at a tangent,\r\n  “_di legno intagliate con grandissimo artificio e indorate_.” I\r\n  believe the translation in the text to indicate the true reading.\r\n  It might mean camphor-wood, or the like. The tent-covering of\r\n  tiger-skins is illustrated by a passage in Sanang Setzen, which\r\n  speaks of a tent covered with panther-skins, sent to Chinghiz by\r\n  the Khan of the Solongos (p. 77).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Tents of the Emperor Kienlung.]\r\n\r\n  [Grenard (pp. 160–162) gives us his experience of Tents in Central\r\n  Asia (Khotan). “These Tents which we had purchased at Tashkent\r\n  were the ‘tentes-abris’ which are used in campaign by Russian\r\n  military workshops, only we made them larger by a third. They were\r\n  made of grey Kirghiz felt, which cannot be procured at Khotan. The\r\n  felt manufactured in this town not having enough consistency or\r\n  solidity, we took Aksu felt, which is better than this of Khotan,\r\n  though inferior to the felt of Russian Turkestan. These felt tents\r\n  are extremely heavy, and, once damp, are dried with difficulty.\r\n  These drawbacks are not compensated by any important advantage; it\r\n  would be an illusion to believe that they preserve from the cold\r\n  any better than other tents. In fact, I prefer the Manchu tent in\r\n  use in the Chinese army, which is, perhaps, of all military tents\r\n  the most practical and comfortable. It is made of a single piece of\r\n  double cloth of cotton, very strong, waterproof for a long time,\r\n  white inside, blue outside, and weighs with its three tipped sticks\r\n  and its wooden poles, 25 kilog. Set up, it forms a ridge roof 7\r\n  feet high and shelters fully ten men. It suits servants perfectly\r\n  well. For the master who wants to work, to write, to draw,\r\n  occasionally to receive officials, the ideal tent would be one of\r\n  the same material, but of larger proportions, and comprising two\r\n  parallel vertical partitions and surmounted by a ridge roof. The\r\n  round form of Kirghiz and Mongol tents is also very comfortable,\r\n  but it requires a complicated and inconvenient wooden frame-work,\r\n  owing to which it takes some considerable time to raise up the\r\n  tent.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 8.—The expressions about the sable run in the G. T., “_et\r\n  l’apellent les Tartarz les_ roi des pelaines,” etc. This has been\r\n  curiously misunderstood both in versions based on Pipino, and\r\n  in the Geog. Latin and Crusca Italian. The Geog. Latin gives us\r\n  “_vocant eas Tartari_ Lenoidae Pellonae”; the Crusca, “_chiamanle\r\n  li Tartari_ Leroide Pelame”; Ramusio in a very odd way combines\r\n  both the genuine and the blundered interpretation: “_E li Tartari\r\n  la chiamano_ Regina delle Pelli; _e gli animali si chiamano_\r\n  Rondes.” Fraehn ingeniously suggested that this _Rondes_ (which\r\n  proves to be merely a misunderstanding of the French words _Roi\r\n  des_) was a mistake for _Kunduz_, usually meaning a “beaver,” but\r\n  also a “sable.” (See _Ibn Foszlan_, p. 57.) _Condux_, no doubt with\r\n  this meaning, appears coupled with _vair_, in a Venetian Treaty\r\n  with Egypt (1344), quoted by Heyd. (II. 208.)\r\n\r\n  Ibn Batuta puts the ermine above the sable. An ermine pelisse,\r\n  he says, was worth in India 1000 dinárs of that country, whilst\r\n  a sable one was worth only 400 dinárs. As Ibn Batuta’s Indian\r\n  dinárs are _Rupees_, the estimate of price is greatly lower than\r\n  Polo’s. Some years ago I find the price of a _Sack_, as it is\r\n  technically called by the Russian traders, or robe of fine sables,\r\n  stated to be in the Siberian market about 7000 banco rubels, _i.e._\r\n  I believe about 350_l._ The same authority mentions that in 1591\r\n  the Tzar Theodore Ivanovich made a present of a pelisse valued at\r\n  the equivalent of 5000 _silver_ rubels of modern Russian money,\r\n  or upwards of 750_l._ Atkinson speaks of a _single_ sable skin of\r\n  the highest quality, for which the trapper demanded 18_l._ The\r\n  great mart for fine sables is at Olekma on the Lena. (See _I. B._\r\n  II. 401–402; _Baer’s Beiträge_, VII. 215 _seqq._; _Upper and Lower\r\n  Amoor_, 390.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 9.—Hawking is still common in North China. Pétis de la Croix\r\n  the elder, in his account of the _Yasa_, or institutes of Chinghiz,\r\n  quotes one which lays down that between March and October “no one\r\n  should take stags, deer, roebucks, hares, wild asses, nor some\r\n  certain birds,” in order that there might be ample sport in winter\r\n  for the court. This would be just the reverse of Polo’s statement,\r\n  but I suspect it is merely a careless adoption of the latter. There\r\n  are many such traps in Pétis de la Croix. (Engl. Vers. 1722, p. 82.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n          REHEARSAL OF THE WAY THE YEAR OF THE GREAT KAAN IS\r\n                             DISTRIBUTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at his capital of Cambaluc,{1} he stays in his palace\r\nthere three days and no more; during which time he has great court\r\nentertainments and rejoicings, and makes merry with his wives. He then\r\nquits his palace at Cambaluc, and proceeds to that city which he has\r\nbuilt, as I told you before, and which is called Chandu, where he has\r\nthat grand park and palace of cane, and where he keeps his gerfalcons\r\nin mew. There he spends the summer, to escape the heat, for the\r\nsituation is a very cool one. After stopping there from the beginning\r\nof May to the 28th of August, he takes his departure (that is the time\r\nwhen they sprinkle the white mares’ milk as I told you), and returns\r\nto his capital Cambaluc. There he stops, as I have told you also, the\r\nmonth of September, to keep his Birthday Feast, and also throughout\r\nOctober, November, December, January, and February, in which last month\r\nhe keeps the grand feast of the New Year, which they call the White\r\nFeast, as you have heard already with all particulars. He then sets out\r\non his march towards the Ocean Sea, hunting and hawking, and continues\r\nout from the beginning of March to the middle of May; and then comes\r\nback for three days only to the capital, during which he makes merry\r\nwith his wives, and holds a great court and grand entertainments. In\r\ntruth, ’tis something astonishing, the magnificence displayed by the\r\nEmperor in those three days; and then he starts off again as you know.\r\n\r\nThus his whole year is distributed in the following manner: six months\r\nat his chief palace in the royal city of Cambaluc, to wit, _September_,\r\n_October_, _November_, _December_, _January_, _February_;\r\n\r\nThen on the great hunting expedition towards the sea, _March_, _April_,\r\n_May_;\r\n\r\nThen back to his palace at Cambaluc for _three days_;\r\n\r\nThen off to the city of Chandu which he has built, and where the Cane\r\nPalace is, where he stays _June_, _July_, _August_;\r\n\r\nThen back again to his capital city of Cambaluc.\r\n\r\nSo thus the whole year is spent; six months at the capital, three\r\nmonths in hunting, and three months at the Cane Palace to avoid the\r\nheat. And in this way he passes his time with the greatest enjoyment;\r\nnot to mention occasional journeys in this or that direction at his own\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—This chapter, with its wearisome and whimsical\r\n  reiteration, reminding one of a game of forfeits, is peculiar to\r\n  that class of MSS. which claims to represent the copy given to\r\n  Thibault de Cepoy by Marco Polo.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bushell has kindly sent me a notice of a Chinese document (his\r\n  translation of which he had unfortunately mislaid), containing a\r\n  minute contemporary account of the annual migration of the Mongol\r\n  Court to Shangtu. Having traversed the Kiu Yung Kwan (or Nankau)\r\n  Pass, where stands the great Mongol archway represented at the\r\n  end of this volume, they left what is now the Kalgan post-road at\r\n  Tumuyi, making straight for Chaghan-nor (_supra_, p. 304), and\r\n  thence to Shangtu. The return journey in autumn followed the same\r\n  route as far as Chaghan-nor, where some days were spent in fowling\r\n  on the lakes, and thence by Siuen-hwa fu (“_Sindachu_,” _supra_, p.\r\n  295) and the present post-road to Cambaluc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n        CONCERNING THE CITY OF CAMBALUC, AND ITS GREAT TRAFFIC\r\n                            AND POPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that the city of Cambaluc hath such a multitude of\r\nhouses, and such a vast population inside the walls and outside, that\r\nit seems quite past all possibility. There is a suburb outside each\r\nof the gates, which are twelve in number;{1} and these suburbs are\r\nso great that they contain more people than the city itself [for the\r\nsuburb of one gate spreads in width till it meets the suburb of the\r\nnext, whilst they extend in length some three or four miles]. In those\r\nsuburbs lodge the foreign merchants and travellers, of whom there are\r\nalways great numbers who have come to bring presents to the Emperor, or\r\nto sell articles at Court, or because the city affords so good a mart\r\nto attract traders. [There are in each of the suburbs, to a distance\r\nof a mile from the city, numerous fine hostelries{2} for the lodgment\r\nof merchants from different parts of the world, and a special hostelry\r\nis assigned to each description of people, as if we should say there\r\nis one for the Lombards, another for the Germans, and a third for the\r\nFrenchmen.] And thus there are as many good houses outside of the\r\ncity as inside, without counting those that belong to the great lords\r\nand barons, which are very numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plain of Cambaluc; the City in the distance; from the\r\n  Hills on the north-west.]\r\n\r\nYou must know that it is forbidden to bury any dead body inside the\r\ncity. If the body be that of an Idolater it is carried out beyond the\r\ncity and suburbs to a remote place assigned for the purpose, to be\r\nburnt. And if it be of one belonging to a religion the custom of which\r\nis to bury, such as the Christian, the Saracen, or what not, it is also\r\ncarried out beyond the suburbs to a distant place assigned for the\r\npurpose. And thus the city is preserved in a better and more healthy\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no public woman resides inside the city, but all such abide\r\noutside in the suburbs. And ’tis wonderful what a vast number of these\r\nthere are for the foreigners; it is a certain fact that there are more\r\nthan 20,000 of them living by prostitution. And that so many can live\r\nin this way will show you how vast is the population.\r\n\r\n  [Guards patrol the city every night in parties of 30 or 40, looking\r\n  out for any persons who may be abroad at unseasonable hours,\r\n  _i.e._ after the great bell hath stricken thrice. If they find any\r\n  such person he is immediately taken to prison, and examined next\r\n  morning by the proper officers. If these find him guilty of any\r\n  misdemeanour they order him a proportionate beating with the stick.\r\n  Under this punishment people sometimes die; but they adopt it in\r\n  order to eschew bloodshed; for their _Bacsis_ say that it is an\r\n  evil thing to shed man’s blood.]\r\n\r\nTo this city also are brought articles of greater cost and rarity,\r\nand in greater abundance of all kinds, than to any other city in the\r\nworld. For people of every description, and from every region, bring\r\nthings (including all the costly wares of India, as well as the fine\r\nand precious goods of Cathay itself with its provinces), some for the\r\nsovereign, some for the court, some for the city which is so great,\r\nsome for the crowds of Barons and Knights, some for the great hosts of\r\nthe Emperor which are quartered round about; and thus between court and\r\ncity the quantity brought in is endless.\r\n\r\nAs a sample, I tell you, no day in the year passes that there do not\r\nenter the city 1000 cart-loads of silk alone, from which are made\r\nquantities of cloth of silk and gold, and of other goods. And this is\r\nnot to be wondered at; for in all the countries round about there is no\r\nflax, so that everything has to be made of silk. It is true, indeed,\r\nthat in some parts of the country there is cotton and hemp, but not\r\nsufficient for their wants. This, however, is not of much consequence,\r\nbecause silk is so abundant and cheap, and is a more valuable substance\r\nthan either flax or cotton.\r\n\r\nRound about this great city of Cambaluc there are some 200 other cities\r\nat various distances, from which traders come to sell their goods and\r\nbuy others for their lords; and all find means to make their sales and\r\npurchases, so that the traffic of the city is passing great.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—It would seem to have been usual to reckon _twelve_ suburbs\r\n  to Peking down to modern times. (See _Deguignes_, III. 38.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The word here used is _Fondaco_, often employed in mediæval\r\n  Italian in the sense nearly of what we call a _factory_. The word\r\n  is from the Greek πανδοκεῖον, but through the Arabic _Fandúḳ_. The\r\n  latter word is used by Ibn Batuta in speaking of the hostelries at\r\n  which the Mussulman merchants put up in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n       [CONCERNING THE OPPRESSIONS OF ACHMATH THE BAILO, AND THE\r\n               PLOT THAT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will hear further on how that there are twelve persons appointed\r\nwho have authority to dispose of lands, offices, and everything else\r\nat their discretion. Now one of these was a certain Saracen named\r\nACHMATH, a shrewd and able man, who had more power and influence\r\nwith the Grand Kaan than any of the others; and the Kaan held him in\r\nsuch regard that he could do what he pleased. The fact was, as came\r\nout after his death, that Achmath had so wrought upon the Kaan with\r\nhis sorcery, that the latter had the greatest faith and reliance on\r\neverything he said, and in this way did everything that Achmath wished\r\nhim to do.\r\n\r\nThis person disposed of all governments and offices, and passed\r\nsentence on all malefactors; and whenever he desired to have any one\r\nwhom he hated put to death, whether with justice or without it, he\r\nwould go to the Emperor and say: “Such an one deserves death, for\r\nhe hath done this or that against your imperial dignity.” Then the\r\nLord would say: “Do as you think right,” and so he would have the man\r\nforthwith executed. Thus when people saw how unbounded were his powers,\r\nand how unbounded the reliance placed by the Emperor on everything that\r\nhe said, they did not venture to oppose him in anything. No one was so\r\nhigh in rank or power as to be free from the dread of him. If any one\r\nwas accused by him to the Emperor of a capital offence, and desired to\r\ndefend himself, he was unable to bring proofs in his own exculpation,\r\nfor no one would stand by him, as no one dared to oppose Achmath. And\r\nthus the latter caused many to perish unjustly.{2}\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was no beautiful woman whom he might desire, but he\r\ngot hold of her; if she were unmarried, forcing her to be his wife, if\r\notherwise, compelling her to consent to his desires. Whenever he knew\r\nof any one who had a pretty daughter, certain ruffians of his would go\r\nto the father, and say: “What say you? Here is this pretty daughter of\r\nyours; give her in marriage to the Bailo Achmath (for they called him\r\n‘the Bailo,’ or, as we should say, ‘the Vicegerent’),{3} and we will\r\narrange for his giving you such a government or such an office for\r\nthree years.” And so the man would surrender his daughter. And Achmath\r\nwould go to the Emperor, and say: “Such a government is vacant, or will\r\nbe vacant on such a day. So-and-So is a proper man for the post.” And\r\nthe Emperor would reply: “Do as you think best;” and the father of the\r\ngirl was immediately appointed to the government. Thus either through\r\nthe ambition of the parents, or through fear of the Minister, all the\r\nbeautiful women were at his beck, either as wives or mistresses. Also\r\nhe had some five-and-twenty sons who held offices of importance, and\r\nsome of these, under the protection of their father’s name, committed\r\nscandals like his own, and many other abominable iniquities. This\r\nAchmath also had amassed great treasure, for everybody who wanted\r\noffice sent him a heavy bribe.\r\n\r\nIn such authority did this man continue for two-and-twenty years.\r\nAt last the people of the country, to wit the Cathayans, utterly\r\nwearied with the endless outrages and abominable iniquities which he\r\nperpetrated against them, whether as regarded their wives or their\r\nown persons, conspired to slay him and revolt against the government.\r\nAmongst the rest there was a certain Cathayan named Chenchu, a\r\ncommander of a thousand, whose mother, daughter, and wife had all\r\nbeen dishonoured by Achmath. Now this man, full of bitter resentment,\r\nentered into parley regarding the destruction of the Minister with\r\nanother Cathayan whose name was Vanchu, who was a commander of 10,000.\r\nThey came to the conclusion that the time to do the business would be\r\nduring the Great Kaan’s absence from Cambaluc. For after stopping there\r\nthree months he used to go to Chandu and stop there three months; and\r\nat the same time his son Chinkin used to go away to his usual haunts,\r\nand this Achmath remained in charge of the city; sending to obtain the\r\nKaan’s orders from Chandu when any emergency arose.\r\n\r\nSo Vanchu and Chenchu, having come to this conclusion, proceeded to\r\ncommunicate it to the chief people among the Cathayans, and then by\r\ncommon consent sent word to their friends in many other cities that\r\nthey had determined on such a day, at the signal given by a beacon,\r\nto massacre all the men with beards, and that the other cities should\r\nstand ready to do the like on seeing the signal fires. The reason\r\nwhy they spoke of massacring the bearded men was that the Cathayans\r\nnaturally have no beard, whilst beards are worn by the Tartars,\r\nSaracens, and Christians. And you should know that all the Cathayans\r\ndetested the Grand Kaan’s rule because he set over them governors who\r\nwere Tartars, or still more frequently Saracens, and these they could\r\nnot endure, for they were treated by them just like slaves. You see the\r\nGreat Kaan had not succeeded to the dominion of Cathay by hereditary\r\nright, but held it by conquest; and thus having no confidence in the\r\nnatives, he put all authority into the hands of Tartars, Saracens,\r\nor Christians who were attached to his household and devoted to his\r\nservice, and were foreigners in Cathay.\r\n\r\nWherefore, on the day appointed, the aforesaid Vanchu and Chenchu\r\nhaving entered the palace at night, Vanchu sat down and caused a number\r\nof lights to be kindled before him. He then sent a messenger to Achmath\r\nthe Bailo, who lived in the Old City, as if to summon him to the\r\npresence of Chinkin, the Great Kaan’s son, who (it was pretended) had\r\narrived unexpectedly. When Achmath heard this he was much surprised,\r\nbut made haste to go, for he feared the Prince greatly. When he arrived\r\nat the gate he met a Tartar called Cogatai, who was Captain of the\r\n12,000 that formed the standing garrison of the City; and the latter\r\nasked him whither he was bound so late? “To Chinkin, who is just\r\narrived.” Quoth Cogatai, “How can that be? How could he come so privily\r\nthat I know nought of it?” So he followed the Minister with a certain\r\nnumber of his soldiers. Now the notion of the Cathayans was that, if\r\nthey could make an end of Achmath, they would have nought else to be\r\nafraid of. So as soon as Achmath got inside the palace, and saw all\r\nthat illumination, he bowed down before Vanchu, supposing him to be\r\nChinkin, and Chenchu who was standing ready with a sword straightway\r\ncut his head off. As soon as Cogatai, who had halted at the entrance,\r\nbeheld this, he shouted “Treason!” and instantly discharged an arrow\r\nat Vanchu and shot him dead as he sat. At the same time he called his\r\npeople to seize Chenchu, and sent a proclamation through the city\r\nthat any one found in the streets would be instantly put to death.\r\nThe Cathayans saw that the Tartars had discovered the plot, and that\r\nthey had no longer any leader, since Vanchu was killed and Chenchu was\r\ntaken. So they kept still in their houses, and were unable to pass\r\nthe signal for the rising of the other cities as had been settled.\r\nCogatai immediately dispatched messengers to the Great Kaan giving an\r\norderly report of the whole affair, and the Kaan sent back orders for\r\nhim to make a careful investigation, and to punish the guilty as their\r\nmisdeeds deserved. In the morning Cogatai examined all the Cathayans,\r\nand put to death a number whom he found to be ringleaders in the plot.\r\nThe same thing was done in the other cities, when it was found that the\r\nplot extended to them also.\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Kaan had returned to Cambaluc he was very anxious to\r\ndiscover what had led to this affair, and he then learned all about\r\nthe endless iniquities of that accursed Achmath and his sons. It was\r\nproved that he and seven of his sons (for they were not all bad) had\r\nforced no end of women to be their wives, besides those whom they had\r\nravished. The Great Kaan then ordered all the treasure that Achmath\r\nhad accumulated in the Old City to be transferred to his own treasury\r\nin the New City, and it was found to be of enormous amount. He also\r\nordered the body of Achmath to be dug up and cast into the streets for\r\nthe dogs to tear; and commanded those of his sons that had followed the\r\nfather’s evil example to be flayed alive.{4}\r\n\r\nThese circumstances called the Kaan’s attention to the accursed\r\ndoctrines of the Sect of the Saracens, which excuse every crime,\r\nyea even murder itself, when committed on such as are not of their\r\nreligion. And seeing that this doctrine had led the accursed Achmath\r\nand his sons to act as they did without any sense of guilt, the Kaan\r\nwas led to entertain the greatest disgust and abomination for it. So\r\nhe summoned the Saracens and prohibited their doing many things which\r\ntheir religion enjoined. Thus, he ordered them to regulate their\r\nmarriages by the Tartar Law, and prohibited their cutting the throats\r\nof animals killed for food, ordering them to rip the stomach in the\r\nTartar way.\r\n\r\nNow when all this happened Messer Marco was upon the spot.]{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—This narrative is from Ramusio’s version, and constitutes\r\n  one of the most notable passages peculiar to that version.\r\n\r\n  The name of the oppressive Minister is printed in Ramusio’s\r\n  Collection _Achmach_. But the _c_ and _t_ are so constantly\r\n  interchanged in MSS. that I think there can be no question this was\r\n  a mere clerical error for _Achmath_, and so I write it. I have also\r\n  for consistency changed the spelling of _Xandu_, _Chingis_, etc.,\r\n  to that hitherto adopted in our text of _Chandu_, _Chinkin_, etc.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—The remarks of a Chinese historian on Kúblái’s\r\n  administration may be appropriately quoted here: “Hupilai Han\r\n  must certainly be regarded as one of the greatest princes that\r\n  ever existed, and as one of the most successful in all that he\r\n  undertook. This he owed to his judgment in the selection of his\r\n  officers, and to his talent for commanding them. He carried his\r\n  arms into the most remote countries, and rendered his name so\r\n  formidable that not a few nations spontaneously submitted to his\r\n  supremacy. Nor was there ever an Empire of such vast extent.\r\n  He cultivated literature, protected its professors, and even\r\n  thankfully received their advice. Yet he never placed a Chinese in\r\n  his cabinet, and he employed foreigners only as Ministers. These,\r\n  however, he chose with discernment, _always excepting the Ministers\r\n  of Finance_. He really loved his subjects; and if they were not\r\n  always happy under his government, it is because they took care\r\n  to conceal their sufferings. There were in those days no Public\r\n  Censors whose duty it is to warn the Sovereign of what is going on:\r\n  and no one dared to speak out for fear of the resentment of the\r\n  Ministers, who were the depositaries of the Imperial authority, and\r\n  the authors of the oppressions under which the people laboured.\r\n  Several Chinese, men of letters and of great ability, who lived\r\n  at Hupilai’s court, might have rendered that prince the greatest\r\n  service in the administration of his dominions, but they never\r\n  were intrusted with any but subordinate offices, and they were\r\n  not in a position to make known the malversations of those public\r\n  blood-suckers.” (_De Mailla_, IX. 459–460.)\r\n\r\n  AHMAD was a native of Fenáket (afterwards Sháh-Rúkhia), near the\r\n  Jaxartes, and obtained employment under Kúblái through the Empress\r\n  Jamui Khatun, who had known him before her marriage. To her Court\r\n  he was originally attached, but we find him already employed in\r\n  high financial office in 1264. Kúblái’s demands for money must\r\n  have been very large, and he eschewed looking too closely into\r\n  the character of his financial agents or the means by which they\r\n  raised money for him. Ahmad was very successful in this, and being\r\n  a man of great talent and address, obtained immense influence over\r\n  the Emperor, until at last nothing was done save by his direction,\r\n  though he always _appeared_ to be acting under the orders of\r\n  Kúblái. The Chinese authorities in Gaubil and De Mailla speak\r\n  strongly of his oppressions, but only in general terms, and without\r\n  affording such particulars as we derive from the text.\r\n\r\n  The Hereditary Prince Chingkim was strongly adverse to Ahmad;\r\n  and some of the high Chinese officials on various occasions made\r\n  remonstrance against the Minister’s proceedings; but Kúblái turned\r\n  a deaf ear to them, and Ahmad succeeded in ruining most of his\r\n  opponents. (_Gaubil_, 141, 143, 151; _De Mailla_, IX. 316–317;\r\n  _D’Ohsson_, II. 468–469.)\r\n\r\n  [The Rev. W. S. Ament (_Marco Polo in Cambaluc_, 105) writes: “No\r\n  name is more execrated than that of Ah-ha-ma (called Achmath by\r\n  Polo), a Persian, who was chosen to manage the finances of the\r\n  Empire. He was finally destroyed by a combination against him while\r\n  the Khan was absent with Crown Prince Chen Chin, on a visit to\r\n  Shang Tu.” Achmath has his biography under the name of _A-ho-ma_\r\n  (Ahmed) in the ch. 205 of the _Yuen-shi_, under the rubric\r\n  “Villanous Ministers.” (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. p. 272.)\r\n  —H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—This term _Bailo_ was the designation of the representative\r\n  of Venetian dignity at Constantinople, called _Podestà_ during\r\n  the period of the Latin rule there, and it has endured throughout\r\n  the Turkish Empire to our own day in the form _Balios_ as the\r\n  designation of a Frank Consul. [There was also a Venetian _bailo_\r\n  in Syria.—H. C.] But that term itself could scarcely have been in\r\n  use at Cambaluc, even among the handful of Franks, to designate the\r\n  powerful Minister, and it looks as if Marco had confounded the word\r\n  in his own mind with some Oriental term of like sound, possibly\r\n  the Arabic _Wáli_, “a Prince, Governor of a Province, ... a chief\r\n  Magistrate.” (_F. Johnson._) In the _Roteiro_ of the Voyage of\r\n  Vasco da Gama (2nd ed. Lisbon, 1861, pp. 53–54) it is said that on\r\n  the arrival of the ships at Calicut the King sent “a man who was\r\n  called the _Bale_, which is much the same as _Alquaide_.” And the\r\n  Editor gives the same explanation that I have suggested.\r\n\r\n  I observe that according to Pandit Manphul the native governor\r\n  of Kashgar, under the Chinese Amban, used to be called the _Baili\r\n  Beg_. [In this case _Baili_ stands for _beilêh_.—H. C.] (_Panjab\r\n  Trade Report_, App. p. cccxxxvii.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—The story, as related in De Mailla and Gaubil, is as\r\n  follows. It contains much less detail than the text, and it differs\r\n  as to the manner of the chief conspirator’s death, whilst agreeing\r\n  as to his name and the main facts of the episode.\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1282 (Gaubil, 1281) Kúblái and Prince Chingkim\r\n  had gone off as usual to Shangtu, leaving Ahmad in charge at the\r\n  Capital. The whole country was at heart in revolt against his\r\n  oppressions. Kúblái alone knew, or would know, nothing of them.\r\n\r\n  WANGCHU, a chief officer of the city, resolved to take the\r\n  opportunity of delivering the Empire from such a curse, and was\r\n  joined in his enterprise by a certain sorcerer called Kao Hoshang.\r\n  They sent two Lamas to the Council Board with a message that the\r\n  Crown Prince was returning to the Capital to take part in certain\r\n  Buddhist ceremonies, but no credit was given to this. Wangchu then,\r\n  pretending to have received orders from the Prince, desired an\r\n  officer called CHANG-Y (perhaps the Chenchu of Polo’s narrative)\r\n  to go in the evening with a guard of honour to receive him. Late\r\n  at night a message was sent to summon the Ministers, as the Prince\r\n  (it was pretended) had already arrived. They came in haste with\r\n  Ahmad at their head, and as he entered the Palace Wangchu struck\r\n  him heavily with a copper mace and stretched him dead. Wangchu\r\n  was arrested, or according to one account surrendered, though he\r\n  might easily have escaped, confident that the Crown Prince would\r\n  save his life. Intelligence was sent off to Kúblái, who received\r\n  it at Chaghan-Nor. (See Book I. ch. lx.) He immediately despatched\r\n  officers to arrest the guilty and bring them to justice. Wangchu,\r\n  Chang-y, and Kao Hoshang were publicly executed at the Old City;\r\n  Wangchu dying like a hero, and maintaining that he had done the\r\n  Empire an important service which would yet be acknowledged. (_De\r\n  Mailla_, IX. 412–413; _Gaubil_, 193–194; _D’Ohsson_, II. 470.) [Cf.\r\n  _G. Phillips_, in _T’oung-Pao_, I. p. 220.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—And it is a pleasant fact that Messer Marco’s presence, and\r\n  his upright conduct upon this occasion, have not been forgotten in\r\n  the Chinese Annals: “The Emperor having returned from Chaghan-Nor\r\n  to Shangtu, desired POLO, Assessor of the Privy Council, to explain\r\n  the reasons which had led Wangchu to commit this murder. Polo spoke\r\n  with boldness of the crimes and oppressions of Ahama (Ahmad), which\r\n  had rendered him an object of detestation throughout the Empire.\r\n  The Emperor’s eyes were opened, and he praised the courage of\r\n  Wangchu. He complained that those who surrounded him, in abstaining\r\n  from admonishing him of what was going on, had thought more of\r\n  their fear of displeasing the Minister than of the interests of\r\n  the State.” By Kúblái’s order, the body of Ahmad was taken up, his\r\n  head was cut off and publicly exposed, and his body cast to the\r\n  dogs. His son also was put to death with all his family, and his\r\n  immense wealth confiscated. 714 persons were punished, one way or\r\n  other, for their share in Ahmad’s malversations. (_De Mailla_, IX.\r\n  413–414.)\r\n\r\n  What is said near the end of this chapter about the Kaan’s\r\n  resentment against the Saracens has some confirmation in\r\n  circumstances related by Rashiduddin. The refusal of some Mussulman\r\n  merchants, on a certain occasion at Court, to eat of the dishes\r\n  sent them by the Emperor, gave great offence, and led to the\r\n  revival of an order of Chinghiz, which prohibited, under pain\r\n  of death, the slaughter of animals by cutting their throats.\r\n  This endured for seven years, and was then removed on the strong\r\n  representation made to Kúblái of the loss caused by the cessation\r\n  of the visits of the Mahomedan merchants. On a previous occasion\r\n  also the Mahomedans had incurred disfavour, owing to the ill-will\r\n  of certain Christians, who quoted to Kúblái a text of the Koran\r\n  enjoining the killing of polytheists. The Emperor sent for the\r\n  Mullahs, and asked them why they did not act on the Divine\r\n  injunction? All they could say was that the time was not yet come!\r\n  Kúblái ordered them for execution, and was only appeased by the\r\n  intercession of Ahmad, and the introduction of a divine with\r\n  more tact, who smoothed over obnoxious applications of the text.\r\n  (_D’Ohsson_, II. 492–493.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  HOW THE GREAT KAAN CAUSETH THE BARK OF TREES, MADE INTO SOMETHING\r\n      LIKE PAPER, TO PASS FOR MONEY OVER ALL HIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that I have told you in detail of the splendour of this City of the\r\nEmperor’s, I shall proceed to tell you of the Mint which he hath in\r\nthe same city, in the which he hath his money coined and struck, as I\r\nshall relate to you. And in doing so I shall make manifest to you how\r\nit is that the Great Lord may well be able to accomplish even much more\r\nthan I have told you, or am going to tell you, in this Book. For, tell\r\nit how I might, you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within\r\ntruth and reason!\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s Mint then is in this same City of Cambaluc, and the way\r\nit is wrought is such that you might say he hath the Secret of Alchemy\r\nin perfection, and you would be right! For he makes his money after\r\nthis fashion.\r\n\r\nHe makes them take of the bark of a certain tree, in fact of the\r\nMulberry Tree, the leaves of which are the food of the silkworms,—these\r\ntrees being so numerous that whole districts are full of them. What\r\nthey take is a certain fine white bast or skin which lies between the\r\nwood of the tree and the thick outer bark, and this they make into\r\nsomething resembling sheets of paper, but black. When these sheets\r\nhave been prepared they are cut up into pieces of different sizes. The\r\nsmallest of these sizes is worth a half tornesel; the next, a little\r\nlarger, one tornesel; one, a little larger still, is worth half a\r\nsilver groat of Venice; another a whole groat; others yet two groats,\r\nfive groats, and ten groats. There is also a kind worth one Bezant of\r\ngold, and others of three Bezants, and so up to ten. All these pieces\r\nof paper are [issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they\r\nwere of pure gold or silver; and on every piece a variety of officials,\r\nwhose duty it is, have to write their names, and to put their seals.\r\nAnd when all is prepared duly, the chief officer deputed by the Kaan\r\nsmears the Seal entrusted to him with vermilion, and impresses it on\r\nthe paper, so that the form of the Seal remains printed upon it in red;\r\nthe Money is then authentic. Any one forging it would be punished with\r\ndeath.] And the Kaan causes every year to be made such a vast quantity\r\nof this money, which costs him nothing, that it must equal in amount\r\nall the treasure in the world.\r\n\r\nWith these pieces of paper, made as I have described, he causes\r\nall payments on his own account to be made; and he makes them to\r\npass current universally over all his kingdoms and provinces and\r\nterritories, and whithersoever his power and sovereignty extends. And\r\nnobody, however important he may think himself, dares to refuse them on\r\npain of death. And indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever\r\na person may go throughout the Great Kaan’s dominions he shall find\r\nthese pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all\r\nsales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they\r\nwere coins of pure gold. And all the while they are so light that ten\r\nbezants’ worth does not weigh one golden bezant.\r\n\r\nFurthermore all merchants arriving from India or other countries, and\r\nbringing with them gold or silver or gems and pearls, are prohibited\r\nfrom selling to any one but the Emperor. He has twelve experts chosen\r\nfor this business, men of shrewdness and experience in such affairs;\r\nthese appraise the articles, and the Emperor then pays a liberal price\r\nfor them in those pieces of paper. The merchants accept his price\r\nreadily, for in the first place they would not get so good an one from\r\nanybody else, and secondly they are paid without any delay. And with\r\nthis paper-money they can buy what they like anywhere over the Empire,\r\nwhilst it is also vastly lighter to carry about on their journeys. And\r\nit is a truth that the merchants will several times in the year bring\r\nwares to the amount of 400,000 bezants, and the Grand Sire pays for\r\nall in that paper. So he buys such a quantity of those precious things\r\nevery year that his treasure is endless, whilst all the time the money\r\nhe pays away costs him nothing at all. Moreover, several times in the\r\nyear proclamation is made through the city that any one who may have\r\ngold or silver or gems or pearls, by taking them to the Mint shall get\r\na handsome price for them. And the owners are glad to do this, because\r\nthey would find no other purchaser give so large a price. Thus the\r\nquantity they bring in is marvellous, though these who do not choose to\r\ndo so may let it alone. Still, in this way, nearly all the valuables in\r\nthe country come into the Kaan’s possession.\r\n\r\nWhen any of those pieces of paper are spoilt—not that they are so very\r\nflimsy neither—the owner carries them to the Mint, and by paying three\r\nper cent. on the value he gets new pieces in exchange. And if any\r\nBaron, or any one else soever, hath need of gold or silver or gems or\r\npearls, in order to make plate, or girdles, or the like, he goes to the\r\nMint and buys as much as he list, paying in this paper-money.{1}\r\n\r\nNow you have heard the ways and means whereby the Great Kaan may have,\r\nand in fact _has_, more treasure than all the Kings in the World; and\r\nyou know all about it and the reason why. And now I will tell you of\r\nthe great Dignitaries which act in this city on behalf of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—It is surprising to find that, nearly two centuries ago,\r\n  Magaillans, a missionary who had lived many years in China, and\r\n  was presumably a Chinese scholar, should have utterly denied the\r\n  truth of Polo’s statements about the paper-currency of China. Yet\r\n  the fact even then did not rest on Polo’s statement only. The\r\n  same thing had been alleged in the printed works of Rubruquis,\r\n  Roger Bacon, Hayton, Friar Odoric, the Archbishop of Soltania, and\r\n  Josaphat Barbaro, to say nothing of other European authorities that\r\n  remained in manuscript, or of the numerous Oriental records of the\r\n  same circumstance.\r\n\r\n  The issue of paper-money in China is at least as old as the\r\n  beginning of the 9th century. In 1160 the system had gone to\r\n  such excess that government paper equivalent in nominal value to\r\n  43,600,000 ounces of silver had been issued in six years, and there\r\n  were local notes besides; so that the Empire was flooded with\r\n  rapidly depreciating paper.\r\n\r\n  The _Kin_ or “Golden” Dynasty of Northern Invaders who immediately\r\n  preceded the Mongols took to paper, in spite of their title, as\r\n  kindly as the native sovereigns. Their notes had a course of seven\r\n  years, after which new notes were issued to the holders, with a\r\n  deduction of 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n  The Mongols commenced their issues of paper-money in 1236, long\r\n  before they had transferred the seat of their government to China.\r\n  Kúblái made such an issue in the first year of his reign (1260),\r\n  and continued to issue notes copiously till the end. In 1287 he\r\n  put out a complete new currency, one note of which was to exchange\r\n  against _five_ of the previous series of equal nominal value!\r\n  In both issues the paper-money was, in official valuation, only\r\n  equivalent to half its nominal value in silver; a circumstance not\r\n  very easy to understand. The paper-money was called _Chao_.\r\n\r\n  The notes of Kúblái’s first issue (1260–1287) with which Polo may be\r\n  supposed most familiar, were divided into three classes; (1) _Notes\r\n  of Tens_, viz. of 10, 20, 30, and 50 _tsien_ or cash; (2) _Notes\r\n  of Hundreds_, viz. of 100, 200, and 500 _tsien_; and (3) _Notes of\r\n  Strings_ or _Thousands_ of cash, or in other words of _Liangs_ or\r\n  ounces of silver (otherwise _Tael_), viz. of 1000 and 2000 _tsien_.\r\n  There were also notes printed on silk for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 ounces\r\n  each, valued at par in silver, but these would not circulate. In\r\n  1275, it should be mentioned, there had been a supplementary issue\r\n  of small notes for 2, 3, and 5 cash each.\r\n\r\n  Marsden states an equation between Marco’s values of the Notes and\r\n  the actual Chinese currency, to which Biot seems to assent. I doubt\r\n  its correctness, for his assumed values of the groat or _grosso_\r\n  and tornesel are surely wrong. The grosso ran at that time 18 to\r\n  the gold ducat or sequin, and allowing for the then higher relative\r\n  value of silver, should have contained about 5_d._ of silver. The\r\n  ducat was also equivalent to 2 _lire_, and the _tornese_ (_Romanin_,\r\n  III. 343) was 4 deniers. Now the denier is always, I believe ¹⁄₂₄₀\r\n  of the _líra_. Hence the _tornese_ would be ⁹⁄₆₀ of the _grosso_.\r\n\r\n  But we are not to look for _exact_ correspondences, when we see\r\n  Polo applying round figures in European coinage to Chinese currency.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Bank-Note of the Ming Dynasty.]\r\n\r\n  His bezant notes, I agree with Marsden, here represent the\r\n  Chinese notes for one and more ounces of silver. And here the\r\n  correspondence of value is much nearer than it seems at first\r\n  sight. The Chinese _liang_ or ounce of silver is valued commonly\r\n  at 6_s._ 7_d._, say roundly 80_d._[1] But the relation of gold\r\n  and silver in civilized Asia was then (see ch. I. note 4, and\r\n  also _Cathay_, pp. ccl. and 442) as 10 to 1, not, as with us now,\r\n  more than 15 to 1. Wherefore the _liang_ in relation to gold would\r\n  be worth 120_d._ or 10_s._, a little over the Venetian ducat and\r\n  somewhat less than the bezant or dínár. We shall then find the\r\n  table of Chinese issues, as compared with Marco’s equivalents, to\r\n  stand thus:—\r\n\r\n    CHINESE ISSUES, AS RECORDED.

The lowest issue was in 1269, of\r\n  228,960 _ounces_, which at the rate of 120_d._ to the ounce (see\r\n  above) = 114,480_l._, and the highest was in 1290, viz. 50,002,500\r\n  ounces, equivalent at the same estimate to 25,001,250_l._! whilst\r\n  the total amount in the 34 years was 249,654,290 ounces or\r\n  124,827,144_l._ in nominal value. Well might Marco speak of the\r\n  vast quantity of such notes that the Great Kaan issued annually!\r\n\r\n  To complete the history of the Chinese paper-currency so far as we\r\n  can:\r\n\r\n  In 1309, a new issue took place with the same provision as in\r\n  Kúblái’s issue of 1287, _i.e._ each note of the new issue was to\r\n  exchange against 5 of the old of the same nominal value. And it was\r\n  at the same time prescribed that the notes should exchange at par\r\n  with metals, which of course it was beyond the power of Government\r\n  to enforce, and so the notes were abandoned. Issues continued from\r\n  time to time to the end of the Mongol Dynasty. The paper-currency\r\n  is spoken of by Odoric (1320–30), by Pegolotti (1330–40), and by\r\n  Ibn Batuta (1348), as still the chief, if not sole, currency of the\r\n  Empire. According to the Chinese authorities, the credit of these\r\n  issues was constantly diminishing, as it is easy to suppose. But\r\n  it is odd that all the Western Travellers speak as if the notes\r\n  were as good as gold. Pegolotti, writing for mercantile men, and\r\n  from the information (as we may suppose) of mercantile men, says\r\n  explicitly that there was no depreciation.\r\n\r\n  The Ming Dynasty for a time carried on the system of paper-money;\r\n  with the difference that while under the Mongols no other currency\r\n  had been admitted, their successors made payments in notes, but\r\n  accepted only hard cash from their people![3] In 1448 the _chao_ of\r\n  1000 cash was worth but 3. Barbaro still heard talk of the Chinese\r\n  paper-currency from travellers whom he met at Azov about this time;\r\n  but after 1455 there is said to be no more mention of it in Chinese\r\n  history.\r\n\r\n  I have never heard of the preservation of any note of the Mongols;\r\n  but some of the Ming survive, and are highly valued as curiosities\r\n  in China. The late Sir G. T. Staunton appears to have possessed\r\n  one; Dr. Lockhart formerly had two, of which he gave one to Sir\r\n  Harry Parkes, and retains the other. The paper is so dark as to\r\n  explain Marco’s description of it as black. By Dr. Lockhart’s\r\n  kindness I am enabled to give a reduced representation of this\r\n  note, as near a facsimile as we have been able to render it, but\r\n  with some _restoration_, _e.g._ of the _seals_, of which on the\r\n  original there is the barest indication remaining.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Vissering (_Chinese Currency_, Addenda, I.–III.) gives a\r\n  facsimile and a description of a Chinese banknote of the Ming\r\n  Dynasty belonging to the collection of the Asiatic Museum of the\r\n  Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg. “In the eighth year of the\r\n  period _Hung-wu_ (1375), the Emperor Tai-tsu issued an order to\r\n  his minister of finances to make the _Pao-tsao_ (precious bills)\r\n  of the _Ta-Ming_ Dynasty, and to employ as raw material for the\r\n  composition of those bills the fibres of the mulberry tree.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the disuse of Government issues of paper-money\r\n  from that time till recent years, there had long been in some of\r\n  the cities of China a large use of private and local promissory\r\n  notes as currency. In Fuchau this was especially the case; bullion\r\n  was almost entirely displaced, and the banking-houses in that city\r\n  were counted by hundreds. These were under no government control;\r\n  any individual or company having sufficient capital or credit\r\n  could establish a bank and issue their bills, which varied in\r\n  amount from 100 cash to 1000 dollars. Some fifteen years ago the\r\n  Imperial Government seems to have been induced by the exhausted\r\n  state of the Treasury, and these large examples of the local use\r\n  of paper-currency, to consider projects for resuming that system\r\n  after the disuse of four centuries. A curious report by a Committee\r\n  of the Imperial Supreme Council, on a project for such a currency,\r\n  appears among the papers published by the Russian Mission at\r\n  Peking. It is unfavourable to the particular project, but we gather\r\n  from other sources that the Government not long afterwards did\r\n  open banks in the large cities of the Empire for the issue of a\r\n  new paper-currency, but that it met with bad success. At Fuchau,\r\n  in 1858, I learn from one notice, the dollar was worth from 18,000\r\n  to 20,000 cash in Government Bills. Dr. Rennie, in 1861, speaks of\r\n  the dollar at Peking as valued at 15,000, and later at 25,000 paper\r\n  cash. Sushun, the Regent, had issued a vast number of notes through\r\n  banks of his own in various parts of Peking. These he failed to\r\n  redeem, causing the failure of all the banks, and great consequent\r\n  commotion in the city. The Regent had led the Emperor [Hien Fung]\r\n  systematically into debauched habits which ended in paralysis. On\r\n  the Emperor’s death the Empress caused the arrest and execution of\r\n  Sushun. His conduct in connection with the bank failures was so\r\n  bitterly resented that when the poor wretch was led to execution\r\n  (8th November, 1861), as I learn from an eye-witness, the defrauded\r\n  creditors lined the streets and cheered.[4]\r\n\r\n  The Japanese also had a paper-currency in the 14th century. It\r\n  is different in form from that of China. That figured by Siebold\r\n  is a strip of strong paper doubled, 6¼ in. long by 1¾ in. wide,\r\n  bearing a representation of the tutelary god of riches, with long\r\n  inscriptions in Chinese characters, seals in black and red, and an\r\n  indication of value in ancient Japanese characters. I do not learn\r\n  whether notes of considerable amount are still used in Japan; but\r\n  Sir R. Alcock speaks of banknotes for small change from 30 to 500\r\n  cash and more, as in general use in the interior.\r\n\r\n  Two notable and disastrous attempts to imitate the Chinese system\r\n  of currency took place in the Middle Ages; one of them in Persia,\r\n  apparently in Polo’s very presence, the other in India some 36\r\n  years later.\r\n\r\n  The first was initiated in 1294 by the worthless Kaikhatu\r\n  Khan, when his own and his ministers’ extravagance had emptied\r\n  the Treasury, on the suggestion of a financial officer called\r\n  ’Izzuddín Muzaffar. The notes were direct copies of Kúblái’s,\r\n  even the Chinese characters being imitated as part of the device\r\n  upon them.[5] The Chinese name _Chao_ was applied to them, and\r\n  the Mongol Resident at Tabriz, Pulad Chingsang, was consulted in\r\n  carrying out the measure. Expensive preparations were made for this\r\n  object; offices called _Cháo-Khánahs_ were erected in the principal\r\n  cities of the provinces, and a numerous staff appointed to carry\r\n  out the details. Ghazan Khan in Khorasan, however, would have none\r\n  of it, and refused to allow any of these preparations to be made\r\n  within his government. After the constrained use of the Chao for\r\n  two or three days Tabriz was in an uproar; the markets were closed;\r\n  the people rose and murdered ’Izzuddín; and the whole project had\r\n  to be abandoned. Marco was in Persia at this time, or just before,\r\n  and Sir John Malcolm not unnaturally suggests that he might have\r\n  had something to do with the scheme; a suggestion which excites a\r\n  needless commotion in the breast of M. Pauthier. We may draw from\r\n  the story the somewhat notable conclusion that _Block-printing_ was\r\n  practised, at least for this one purpose, at Tabriz in 1294.\r\n\r\n  The other like enterprise was that of Sultan Mahomed Tughlak of\r\n  Delhi, in 1330–31. This also was undertaken for like reasons,\r\n  and was in professed imitation of the Chao of Cathay. Mahomed,\r\n  however, used copper tokens instead of paper; the copper being\r\n  made apparently of equal weight to the gold or silver coin which\r\n  it represented. The system seems to have had a little more vogue\r\n  than at Tabriz, but was speedily brought to an end by the ease with\r\n  which forgeries on an enormous scale were practised. The Sultan, in\r\n  hopes of reviving the credit of his currency, ordered that every\r\n  one bringing copper tokens to the Treasury should have them cashed\r\n  in gold or silver. “The people who in despair had flung aside their\r\n  copper coins like stones and bricks in their houses, all rushed to\r\n  the Treasury and exchanged them for gold and silver. In this way\r\n  the Treasury soon became empty, but the copper coins had as little\r\n  circulation as ever, and a very grievous blow was given to the\r\n  State.”\r\n\r\n  An odd issue of currency, not of paper, but of leather, took place\r\n  in Italy a few years before Polo’s birth. The Emperor Frederic\r\n  II., at the siege of Faenza in 1241, being in great straits for\r\n  money, issued pieces of leather stamped with the mark of his mint\r\n  at the value of his Golden Augustals. This leather coinage was very\r\n  popular, especially at Florence, and it was afterwards honourably\r\n  redeemed by Frederic’s Treasury. Popular tradition in Sicily\r\n  reproaches William the Bad among his other sins with having issued\r\n  money of leather, but any stone is good enough to cast at a dog\r\n  with such a surname.\r\n\r\n  [Ma Twan-lin mentions that in the fourth year of the period Yuen\r\n  Show (B.C. 119), a currency of white metal and _deer-skin_ was\r\n  made. Mr. Vissering (_Chinese Currency_, 38) observes that the\r\n  skin-tallies “were purely tokens, and have had nothing in common\r\n  with the leather-money, which was, during a long time, current\r\n  in Russia. This Russian skin-money had a truly representative\r\n  character, as the parcels were used instead of the skins from which\r\n  they were cut; the skins themselves being too bulky and heavy to be\r\n  constantly carried backward and forward, only a little piece was\r\n  cut off, to figure as a token of possession of the whole skin. The\r\n  ownership of the skin was proved when the piece fitted in the hole.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, 201 note) says: “As early as B.C. 118,\r\n  we find the Chinese using ‘leather-money’ (_p’i pi_). These were\r\n  pieces of white deer-skin, a foot square, with a coloured border.\r\n  Each had a value of 40,000 cash. (_Ma Twan-lin_, Bk. 8, 5.)”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Charles F. Keary (_Coins and Medals_, by S. Lane Poole, 128)\r\n  mentions that “in the reign of Elizabeth there was a very extensive\r\n  issue of private tokens in lead, tin, latten, and _leather_.”—H.

Up to the present time there is in Si-ngan-fu a block kept,\r\n  which was used for printing the bank-notes of the Kin Dynasty. I\r\n  have had the opportunity of seeing a print of those bank-notes,\r\n  they were of the same size and shape as the bank-notes of the Ming.\r\n  A reproduction of the text of the Kin bank-notes is found in the\r\n  _Kin shi ts’ui pien_. This copy has the characters _pao küan_\r\n  (precious charter) and the years of reign _Chêng Yew_, 1213–1216.\r\n  The first essay of the Mongols to introduce bank-notes dates from\r\n  the time of Ogodai Khan (1229–1242), but Chinese history only\r\n  mentions the fact without giving details. At that time silk in\r\n  skeins was the only article of a determinate value in the trade\r\n  and on the project of _Ye lü ch’u ts’ai_, minister of Ogodai, the\r\n  taxes were also collected in silk delivered by weight. It can\r\n  therefore be assumed that the name _sze ch’ao_ (_i.e._ bank-notes\r\n  referring to the weight of silk) dates back to the same time.\r\n  At any rate, at a later time, as, under the reign of Kubilai,\r\n  the issuing of banknotes was decreed, silk was taken as the\r\n  standard to express the value of silver and 1000 _liang_ silk was\r\n  estimated = 50 _liang_ (or 1 _ting_) silver. Thus, in consequence\r\n  of those measures, it gradually became a rule to transfer the\r\n  taxes and rents originally paid in silk, into silver. The wealth\r\n  of the Mongol Khans in precious metals was renowned. The accounts\r\n  regarding their revenues, however, which we meet with occasionally\r\n  in Chinese history, do not surprise by their vastness. In the year\r\n  1298, for instance, the amount of the revenue is stated in the _Siu\r\n  t’ung Kien_ to have been:—\r\n\r\n    19,000 _liang_ of gold = (190,000 _liang_ of silver, according to\r\n        the exchange of that time at the rate of 1 to 10).\r\n\r\n    60,000 _liang_ of silver.\r\n\r\n    3,600,000 _ting_ of silver in bank-notes (_i.e._ 180 millions\r\n        _liang_); altogether 180,250,000 _liang_ of silver.\r\n\r\n  The number seems indeed very high for that time. But if the\r\n  exceedingly low exchange of the bank-notes be taken into\r\n  consideration, the sum will be reduced to a modest amount.”\r\n  (_Palladius_, pp. 50–51.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  [Dr. Bretschneider (_Hist. Bot. Disc._, I. p. 4) makes the\r\n  following remark:—“Polo states (I. 409) that the Great Kaan causeth\r\n  the bark of great Mulberry-trees, made into something like paper,\r\n  to pass for money.” He seems to be mistaken. Paper in China is not\r\n  made from mulberry-trees but from the _Broussonetia papyrifera_,\r\n  which latter tree belongs to the same order of Moraceae. The same\r\n  fibres are used also in some parts of China for making cloth, and\r\n  Marco Polo alludes probably to the same tree when stating (II.\r\n  108) “that in the province of Cuiju (Kwei chau) they manufacture\r\n  stuff of the bark of certain trees, which form very fine summer\r\n  clothing.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Even now there are at least eight different _taels_ (or liangs) in\r\n    extensive use over the Empire, and varying as much as from 96 to\r\n    106; and besides these are many local _taels_, with about the same\r\n    limits of variation.—(_Williamson’s Journeys_, I. 60.)\r\n\r\n[2] [The Archimandrite Palladius (_l.c._, p. 50, note) says that “the\r\n    _ting_ of the Mongol time, as well as during the reign of the Kin,\r\n    was a unit of weight equivalent to fifty _liang_, but not to ten\r\n    _liang_. Cf. _Ch’u keng lu_, and _Yuen-shi_, ch. xcv. The _Yuen\r\n    pao_, which as everybody in China knows, is equivalent to fifty\r\n    _liang_ (taels) of silver, is the same as the ancient _ting_,\r\n    and the character _Yuen_ indicates that it dates from the _Yuen_\r\n    Dynasty.”—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[3] This is also, as regards Customs payments, the system of the\r\n    Government of modern Italy.\r\n\r\n[4] The first edition of this work gave a facsimile of one of this\r\n    unlucky minister’s notes.\r\n\r\n[5] On both sides, however, was the Mahomedan formula, and beneath\r\n    that the words _Yiranjín Túrjí_, a title conferred on the kings of\r\n    Persia by the Kaan. There was also an inscription to the following\r\n    effect: that the Emperor in the year 693 (A.H.) had issued these\r\n    auspicious _chao_, that all who forged or uttered false notes\r\n    should be summarily punished, with their wives and children, and\r\n    their property confiscated; and that when these auspicious notes\r\n    were once in circulation, poverty would vanish, provisions become\r\n    cheap, and rich and poor be equal (_Cowell_). The use of the term\r\n    _chao_ at Tabriz may be compared with that of _Bănklōt_, current in\r\n    modern India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n         CONCERNING THE TWELVE BARONS WHO ARE SET OVER ALL THE\r\n                      AFFAIRS OF THE GREAT KAAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that the Great Kaan hath chosen twelve great Barons to\r\nwhom he hath committed all the necessary affairs of thirty-four great\r\nprovinces; and now I will tell you particulars about them and their\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nYou must know that these twelve Barons reside all together in a very\r\nrich and handsome palace, which is inside the city of Cambaluc, and\r\nconsists of a variety of edifices, with many suites of apartments. To\r\nevery province is assigned a judge and several clerks, and all reside\r\nin this palace, where each has his separate quarters. These judges and\r\nclerks administer all the affairs of the provinces to which they are\r\nattached, under the direction of the twelve Barons. Howbeit, when an\r\naffair is of very great importance, the twelve Barons lay in before\r\nthe Emperor, and he decides as he thinks best. But the power of those\r\ntwelve Barons is so great that they choose the governors for all those\r\nthirty-four great provinces that I have mentioned, and only after\r\nthey have chosen do they inform the Emperor of their choice. This he\r\nconfirms, and grants to the person nominated a tablet of gold such as\r\nis appropriate to the rank of his government.\r\n\r\nThose twelve Barons also have such authority that they can dispose\r\nof the movements of the forces, and send them whither, and in such\r\nstrength, as they please. This is done indeed with the Emperor’s\r\ncognizance, but still the orders are issued on their authority. They\r\nare styled SHIENG, which is as much as to say “The Supreme Court,”\r\nand the palace where they abide is also called _Shieng_. This body\r\nforms the highest authority at the Court of the Great Kaan; and indeed\r\nthey can favour and advance whom they will. I will not now name the\r\nthirty-four provinces to you, because they will be spoken of in detail\r\nin the course of this Book.{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Pauthier’s extracts from the Chinese Annals of the Dynasty,\r\n  in illustration of this subject, are interesting. These, as he\r\n  represents them, show the Council of Ministers usually to have\r\n  consisted of twelve high officials, viz.: two _Ch’ing-siang_\r\n  [丞 相] or (chief) ministers of state, one styled, “of the\r\n  Right,” and the other “of the Left”; four called _P’ing-chang\r\n  ching-ssé_, which seems to mean something like ministers in charge\r\n  of special departments; four assistant ministers; two Counsellors.\r\n\r\n  Rashiduddin, however, limits the Council to the first two\r\n  classes: “Strictly speaking, the Council of State is composed of\r\n  four Ch’ing-sang (_Ch’ing-siang_) or great officers (_Wazírs_\r\n  he afterwards terms them), and four Fanchán (_P’ing-chang_)\r\n  or associated members, taken from the nations of the Tajiks,\r\n  Cathayans, Ighurs, and Arkaun” (_i.e._ Nestorian Christians).\r\n  (Compare p. 418, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n  [A Samarkand man, Seyyd Tadj Eddin Hassan ben el Khallal, quoted in\r\n  the _Masálak al Absár_, says: “Near the Khan are two amírs who are\r\n  his ministers; they are called _Djing San_ جينكصان (Ch’ing-siang).\r\n  After them come the two _Bidjan_ بجان (P’ing Chang), then the two\r\n  _Zoudjin_ زوجين (Tso Chen), then the two _Yudjin_ يوجين (Yu Chen),\r\n  and at last the _Landjun_ لنجون (Lang Chang), head of the scribes,\r\n  and secretary of the sovereign. The Khan holds a sitting every\r\n  day in the middle of a large building called _Chen_ شن (Sheng),\r\n  which is very like our Palace of Justice.” (_C. Schefer, Cent. Ec.\r\n  Langues Or._, pp. 18–19.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In a later age we find the twelve Barons reappearing in the\r\n  pages of Mendoza: “The King hath in this city of Tabin (Peking),\r\n  where he is resident, a royal council of twelve counsellors and\r\n  a president, chosen men throughout all the kingdom, and such as\r\n  have had experience in government many years.” And also in the\r\n  early centuries of the Christian era we hear that the Khan of the\r\n  Turks had his twelve grandees, divided into those of the Right and\r\n  those of the Left, probably a copy from a Chinese order then also\r\n  existing.\r\n\r\n  But to return to Rashiduddin: “As the Kaan generally resides\r\n  at the capital, he has erected a place for the sittings of the\r\n  Great Council, called _Sing_.... The dignitaries mentioned above\r\n  are expected to attend daily at the Sing, and to make themselves\r\n  acquainted with all that passes there.”\r\n\r\n  The _Sing_ of Rashid is evidently the Shieng or Sheng (_Scieng_) of\r\n  Polo. M. Pauthier is on this point somewhat contemptuous towards\r\n  Neumann, who, he says, confounds Marco Polo’s twelve Barons or\r\n  Ministers of State with the chiefs of the twelve great provincial\r\n  governments called _Sing_, who had their residence at the chief\r\n  cities of those governments; whilst in fact Polo’s _Scieng_ (he\r\n  asserts) has nothing to do with the _Sing_, but represents the\r\n  Chinese word _Siang_ “a minister,” and “the office of a minister.”\r\n  [There was no doubt a confusion between _Siang_ 相 and _Sheng_\r\n  省.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  It is very probable that two different words, _Siang_ and _Sing_,\r\n  got confounded by the non-Chinese attachés of the Imperial Court;\r\n  but it seems to me quite certain that they applied the same word,\r\n  Sing or Sheng, to both institutions, viz. to the High Council\r\n  of State, and to the provincial governments. It also looks as\r\n  if Marco Polo himself had made that very confusion with which\r\n  Pauthier charges Neumann. For whilst here he represents the\r\n  twelve Barons as forming a Council of State at the capital, we\r\n  find further on, when speaking of the city of Yangchau, he says:\r\n  “_Et si siet en ceste cité uns des xii Barons du Grant Kaan; car\r\n  elle est esleue pour un des xii sieges_,” where the last word is\r\n  probably a mistranscription of _Sciengs_, or _Sings_, and in any\r\n  case the reference is to a distribution of the empire into twelve\r\n  governments.\r\n\r\n  To be convinced that _Sing_ was used by foreigners in the double\r\n  sense that I have said, we have only to proceed with Rashiduddin’s\r\n  account of the administration. After what we have already quoted,\r\n  he goes on: “The _Sing_ of Khanbaligh is the most eminent, and the\r\n  building is very large.... _Sings_ do not exist in all the cities,\r\n  but only in the capitals of great provinces.... In the whole empire\r\n  of the Kaan there are twelve of these Sings; but that of Khanbaligh\r\n  is the only one which has Ching-sangs amongst its members.” Wassáf\r\n  again, after describing the greatness of Khanzai (Kinsay of Polo)\r\n  says: “These circumstances characterize the capital itself, but\r\n  four hundred cities of note, and embracing ample territories,\r\n  are dependent on its jurisdiction, insomuch that the most\r\n  inconsiderable of those cities surpasses Baghdad and Shiraz. In\r\n  the number of these cities are Lankinfu and Zaitun, and Chinkalán;\r\n  for they call Khanzai a _Shing_, _i.e._ a great city in which the\r\n  high and mighty Council of Administration holds its meetings.”\r\n  Friar Odoric again says: “This empire hath been divided by the Lord\r\n  thereof into twelve parts, each one thereof is termed a Singo.”\r\n\r\n  Polo, it seems evident to me, knew nothing of Chinese. His _Shieng_\r\n  is no direct attempt to represent _any_ Chinese word, but simply\r\n  the term that he had been used to employ in talking Persian or\r\n  Turki, in the way that Rashiduddin and Wassáf employ it.\r\n\r\n  I find no light as to the thirty-four provinces into which Polo\r\n  represents the empire as divided, unless it be an enumeration of\r\n  the provinces and districts which he describes in the second and\r\n  third parts of Bk. II., of which it is not difficult to reckon\r\n  thirty-three or thirty-four, but not worth while to repeat the\r\n  calculation.\r\n\r\n  [China was then divided into twelve _Sheng_ or provinces:\r\n  Cheng-Tung, Liao-Yang, Chung-Shu, Shen-Si, Ling-Pe (Karakorum),\r\n  Kan-Suh, Sze-ch’wan, Ho-Nan Kiang-Pe, Kiang-Ché, Kiang-Si, Hu-Kwang\r\n  and Yun-Nan. Rashiduddin (_J. As._, XI. 1883, p. 447) says that of\r\n  the twelve Sing, Khanbaligh was the only one with _Chin-siang_. We\r\n  read in _Morrison’s Dict._ (Pt. II. vol. i. p. 70): “Chin-seang, a\r\n  Minister of State, was so called under the Ming Dynasty.” According\r\n  to Mr. E. H. Parker (_China Review_, xxiv. p. 101), _Ching Siang_\r\n  were abolished in 1395. I imagine that the thirty-four provinces\r\n  refer to the _Fu_ cities, which numbered however _thirty-nine_,\r\n  according to _Oxenham’s Historical Atlas_.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  (_Cathay_, 263 _seqq._ and 137; _Mendoza_, I. 96; _Erdmann_, 142;\r\n  _Hammer’s Wassáf_, p. 42, but corrected.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n        HOW THE KAAN’S POSTS AND RUNNERS ARE SPED THROUGH MANY\r\n                         LANDS AND PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that from this city of Cambaluc proceed many\r\nroads and highways leading to a variety of provinces, one to one\r\nprovince, another to another; and each road receives the name of the\r\nprovince to which it leads; and it is a very sensible plan.{1} And\r\nthe messengers of the Emperor in travelling from Cambaluc, be the\r\nroad whichsoever they will, find at every twenty-five miles of the\r\njourney a station which they call _Yamb_,{2} or, as we should say,\r\nthe “Horse-Post-House.” And at each of those stations used by the\r\nmessengers, there is a large and handsome building for them to put up\r\nat, in which they find all the rooms furnished with fine beds and all\r\nother necessary articles in rich silk, and where they are provided\r\nwith everything they can want. If even a king were to arrive at one of\r\nthese, he would find himself well lodged.\r\n\r\nAt some of these stations, moreover, there shall be posted some four\r\nhundred horses standing ready for the use of the messengers; at others\r\nthere shall be two hundred, according to the requirements, and to\r\nwhat the Emperor has established in each case. At every twenty-five\r\nmiles, as I said, or anyhow at every thirty miles, you find one of\r\nthese stations, on all the principal highways leading to the different\r\nprovincial governments; and the same is the case throughout all the\r\nchief provinces subject to the Great Kaan.{3} Even when the messengers\r\nhave to pass through a roadless tract where neither house nor hostel\r\nexists, still there the station-houses have been established just\r\nthe same, excepting that the intervals are somewhat greater, and the\r\nday’s journey is fixed at thirty-five to forty-five miles, instead\r\nof twenty-five to thirty. But they are provided with horses and all\r\nthe other necessaries just like those we have described, so that\r\nthe Emperor’s messengers, come they from what region they may, find\r\neverything ready for them.\r\n\r\nAnd in sooth this is a thing done on the greatest scale of magnificence\r\nthat ever was seen. Never had emperor, king, or lord, such wealth as\r\nthis manifests! For it is a fact that on all these posts taken together\r\nthere are more than 300,000 horses kept up, specially for the use of\r\nthe messengers. And the great buildings that I have mentioned are more\r\nthan 10,000 in number, all richly furnished, as I told you. The thing\r\nis on a scale so wonderful and costly that it is hard to bring oneself\r\nto describe it.{4}\r\n\r\nBut now I will tell you another thing that I had forgotten, but which\r\nought to be told whilst I am on this subject. You must know that by\r\nthe Great Kaan’s orders there has been established between those\r\npost-houses, at every interval of three miles, a little fort with some\r\nforty houses round about it, in which dwell the people who act as the\r\nEmperor’s foot-runners. Every one of those runners wears a great wide\r\nbelt, set all over with bells, so that as they run the three miles from\r\npost to post their bells are heard jingling a long way off. And thus\r\non reaching the post the runner finds another man similarly equipt,\r\nand all ready to take his place, who instantly takes over whatsoever\r\nhe has in charge, and with it receives a slip of paper from the clerk,\r\nwho is always at hand for the purpose; and so the new man sets off and\r\nruns his three miles. At the next station he finds his relief ready in\r\nlike manner; and so the post proceeds, with a change at every three\r\nmiles. And in this way the Emperor, who has an immense number of these\r\nrunners, receives despatches with news from places ten days’ journey\r\noff in one day and night; or, if need be, news from a hundred days\r\noff in ten days and nights; and that is no small matter! (In fact in\r\nthe fruit season many a time fruit shall be gathered one morning in\r\nCambaluc, and the evening of the next day it shall reach the Great Kaan\r\nat Chandu, a distance of ten days’ journey.{5} The clerk at each of\r\nthe posts notes the time of each courier’s arrival and departure; and\r\nthere are often other officers whose business it is to make monthly\r\nvisitations of all the posts, and to punish those runners who have\r\nbeen slack in their work.{6}) The Emperor exempts these men from all\r\ntribute, and pays them besides.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are also at those stations other men equipt similarly\r\nwith girdles hung with bells, who are employed for expresses when\r\nthere is a call for great haste in sending despatches to any governor\r\nof a province, or to give news when any Baron has revolted, or in\r\nother such emergencies; and these men travel a good two hundred or two\r\nhundred and fifty miles in the day, and as much in the night. I’ll tell\r\nyou how it stands. They take a horse from those at the station which\r\nare standing ready saddled, all fresh and in wind, and mount and go at\r\nfull speed, as hard as they can ride in fact. And when those at the\r\nnext post hear the bells they get ready another horse and a man equipt\r\nin the same way, and he takes over the letter or whatever it be, and is\r\noff full-speed to the third station, where again a fresh horse is found\r\nall ready, and so the despatch speeds along from post to post, always\r\nat full gallop, with regular change of horses. And the speed at which\r\nthey go is marvellous. (By night, however, they cannot go so fast as by\r\nday, because they have to be accompanied by footmen with torches, who\r\ncould not keep up with them at full speed.)\r\n\r\nThose men are highly prized; and they could never do it, did they not\r\nbind hard the stomach, chest and head with strong bands. And each of\r\nthem carries with him a gerfalcon tablet, in sign that he is bound on\r\nan urgent express; so that if perchance his horse break down, or he\r\nmeet with other mishap, whomsoever he may fall in with on the road, he\r\nis empowered to make him dismount and give up his horse. Nobody dares\r\nrefuse in such a case; so that the courier hath always a good fresh nag\r\nto carry him.{7}\r\n\r\nNow all these numbers of post-horses cost the Emperor nothing at all;\r\nand I will tell you the how and the why. Every city, or village, or\r\nhamlet, that stands near one of those post-stations, has a fixed demand\r\nmade on it for as many horses as it can supply, and these it must\r\nfurnish to the post. And in this way are provided all the posts of\r\nthe cities, as well as the towns and villages round about them; only\r\nin uninhabited tracts the horses are furnished at the expense of the\r\nEmperor himself.\r\n\r\n(Nor do the cities maintain the full number, say of 400 horses, always\r\nat their station, but month by month 200 shall be kept at the station,\r\nand the other 200 at grass, coming in their turn to relieve the first\r\n200. And if there chance to be some river or lake to be passed by the\r\nrunners and horse-posts, the neighbouring cities are bound to keep\r\nthree or four boats in constant readiness for the purpose.)\r\n\r\nAnd now I will tell you of the great bounty exercised by the Emperor\r\ntowards his people twice a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The G. Text has “_et ce est mout sçue chouse_”; Pauthier’s\r\n  Text, “_mais il est moult celé_.” The latter seems absurd. I have no\r\n  doubt that _sçue_ is correct, and is an Italianism, _saputo_ having\r\n  sometimes the sense of prudent or judicious. Thus P. della Valle\r\n  (II. 26), speaking of Sháh Abbás: “_Ma noti V.S. i tiri di questo\r\n  re_, saputo insieme e bizzarro,” “acute with all his eccentricity.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—Both Neumann and Pauthier seek Chinese etymologies of this\r\n  Mongol word, which the Tartars carried with them all over Asia. It\r\n  survives in Persian and Turki in the senses both of a post-house\r\n  and a post-horse, and in Russia, in the former sense, is a relic\r\n  of the Mongol dominion. The ambassadors of Shah Rukh, on arriving\r\n  at Sukchu, were lodged in the _Yám-Khána_, or post-house, by the\r\n  city gate; and they found ninety-nine such Yams between Sukchu and\r\n  Khanbaligh, at each of which they were supplied with provisions,\r\n  servants, beds, night-clothes, etc. Odoric likewise speaks of the\r\n  hostelries called _Yam_, and Rubruquis applies the same term to\r\n  quarters in the imperial camp, which were assigned for the lodgment\r\n  of ambassadors. (_Cathay_, ccii., 137; _Rubr._ 310.)\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, 101, note) says that these post-stations\r\n  were established by Okkodai in 1234 throughout the Mongol empire.\r\n  (_D’Ohsson_, ii. 63.) Dr. G. Schlegel (_T’oung Pao_, II. 1891,\r\n  265, note) observes that _iam_ is not, as Pauthier supposed,\r\n  a contraction of _yi-mà_, horse post-house (_yi-mà_ means\r\n  post-horse, and Pauthier makes a mistake), but represents the\r\n  Chinese character 站, pronounced at present _chán_, which means\r\n  in fact a road station, a post. In Annamite, this character 站\r\n  is pronounced _trạm_, and it means, according to _Bonet’s Dict.\r\n  Annamite-Français_: “Relais de poste, station de repos.” (See\r\n  _Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. p. 187 note.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—Martini and Magaillans, in the 17th century, give nearly\r\n  the same account of the government hostelries.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—Here Ramusio has this digression: “Should any one find it\r\n  difficult to understand how there should be such a population as\r\n  all this implies, and how they can subsist, the answer is that all\r\n  the Idolaters, and Saracens as well, take six, eight, or ten wives\r\n  apiece when they can afford it, and beget an infinity of children.\r\n  In fact, you shall find many men who have each more than thirty\r\n  sons who form an armed retinue to their father, and this through\r\n  the fact of his having so many wives. With us, on the other hand,\r\n  a man hath but one wife; and if she be barren, still he must abide\r\n  by her for life, and have no progeny; thus we have not such a\r\n  population as they have.\r\n\r\n  “And as regards food, they have abundance; for they generally\r\n  consume rice, panic, and millet (especially the Tartars, Cathayans,\r\n  and people of Manzi); and these three crops in those countries\r\n  render an hundred-fold. Those nations use no bread, but only boil\r\n  those kinds of grain with milk or meat for their victual. Their\r\n  wheat, indeed, does not render so much, but this they use only to\r\n  make vermicelli, and pastes of that description. No spot of arable\r\n  land is left untilled; and their cattle are infinitely prolific, so\r\n  that when they take the field every man is followed by six, eight,\r\n  or more horses for his own use. Thus you may clearly perceive how\r\n  the population of those parts is so great, and how they have such\r\n  an abundance of food.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—The Burmese kings used to have the odoriferous _Durian_\r\n  transmitted by horse-posts from Tenasserim to Ava. But the most\r\n  notable example of the rapid transmission of such dainties, and the\r\n  nearest approach I know of to their despatch by telegraph, was that\r\n  practised for the benefit of the Fatimite Khalif Aziz (latter part\r\n  of 10th century), who had a great desire for a dish of cherries of\r\n  Balbek. The Wazir Yakub ben-Kilis caused six hundred pigeons to be\r\n  despatched from Balbek to Cairo, each of which carried attached to\r\n  either leg a small silk bag containing a cherry! (_Quat. Makrizi_,\r\n  IV. 118.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—“Note is taken at every post,” says Amyot, in speaking of\r\n  the Chinese practice of last century, “of the time of the courier’s\r\n  arrival, in order that it may be known at what point delays have\r\n  occurred.” (_Mém._ VIII. 185.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 7.—The post-system is described almost exactly as in the text\r\n  by Friar Odoric and the Archbishop of Soltania, in the generation\r\n  after Polo, and very much in the same way by Magaillans in the\r\n  17th century. Posts had existed in China from an old date. They\r\n  are spoken of by Mas’udi and the _Relations_ of the 9th century.\r\n  They were also employed under the ancient Persian kings; and they\r\n  were in use in India, at least in the generation after Polo. The\r\n  Mongols, too, carried the institution wherever they went.\r\n\r\n  Polo describes the couriers as changed at short intervals, but more\r\n  usually in Asiatic posts the same man rides an enormous distance.\r\n  The express courier in Tibet, as described by “the Pandit,” rides\r\n  from Gartokh to Lhasa, a distance of 800 miles, travelling day and\r\n  night. The courier’s coat is _sealed_ upon him, so that he dares\r\n  not take off his clothes till the seal is officially broken on his\r\n  arrival at the terminus. These messengers had faces cracked, eyes\r\n  bloodshot and sunken, and bodies raw with vermin. (_J. R. G. S._\r\n  XXXVIII. p. 149.) The modern Turkish post from Constantinople to\r\n  Baghdad, a distance of 1100 miles, is done in twenty days by four\r\n  Tartars riding night and day. The changes are at Sivas, Diarbekir,\r\n  and Mosul. M. Tchihatcheff calculates that the night riding\r\n  accomplishes only one quarter of the whole. (_Asie Mineure_, 2ᵈᵉ\r\n  Ptie. 632–635.)—See I. p. 352, _paï tze_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n         HOW THE EMPEROR BESTOWS HELP ON HIS PEOPLE, WHEN THEY\r\n                 ARE AFFLICTED WITH DEARTH OR MURRAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that the Emperor sends his Messengers over all his\r\nLands and Kingdoms and Provinces, to ascertain from his officers if\r\nthe people are afflicted by any dearth through unfavourable seasons,\r\nor storms or locusts, or other like calamity; and from those who have\r\nsuffered in this way no taxes are exacted for that year; nay more, he\r\ncauses them to be supplied with corn of his own for food and seed. Now\r\nthis is undoubtedly a great bounty on his part. And when winter comes,\r\nhe causes inquiry to be made as to those who have lost their cattle,\r\nwhether by murrain or other mishap, and such persons not only go scot\r\nfree, but get presents of cattle. And thus, as I tell you, the Lord\r\nevery year helps and fosters the people subject to him.\r\n\r\n[There is another trait of the Great Kaan I should tell you; and that\r\nis, that if a chance shot from his bow strike any herd or flock,\r\nwhether belonging to one person or to many, and however big the flock\r\nmay be, he takes no tithe thereof for three years. In like manner, if\r\nthe arrow strike a boat full of goods, that boat-load pays no duty;\r\nfor it is thought unlucky that an arrow strike any one’s property; and\r\nthe Great Kaan says it would be an abomination before God, were such\r\nproperty, that has been struck by the divine wrath, to enter into his\r\nTreasury.{1}]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The Chinese author already quoted as to Kúblái’s character\r\n  (Note 2, ch. xxiii. _supra_) says: “This Prince, at the sight\r\n  of some evil prognostic, or when there was dearth, would remit\r\n  taxation, and cause grain to be distributed to those who were\r\n  in destitution. He would often complain that there never lacked\r\n  informers if balances were due, or if _corvées_ had been ordered,\r\n  but when the necessities of the people required to be reported, not\r\n  a word was said.”\r\n\r\n  Wassáf tells a long story in illustration of Kúblái’s justice and\r\n  consideration for the peasantry. One of his sons, with a handful\r\n  of followers, had got separated from the army, and halted at a\r\n  village in the territory of Bishbaligh, where the people gave them\r\n  sheep and wine. Next year two of the party came the same way and\r\n  _demanded_ a sheep and a stoup of wine. The people gave it, but\r\n  went to the Kaan and told the story, saying they feared it might\r\n  grow into a perpetual exaction. Kúblái sharply rebuked the Prince,\r\n  and gave the people compensation and an order in their favour. (_De\r\n  Mailla_, ix. 460; _Hammer’s Wassaf_, 38–39.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n         HOW THE GREAT KAAN CAUSES TREES TO BE PLANTED BY THE\r\n                               HIGHWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor moreover hath taken order that all the highways travelled\r\nby his messengers and the people generally should be planted with rows\r\nof great trees a few paces apart; and thus these trees are visible\r\na long way off, and no one can miss the way by day or night. Even\r\nthe roads through uninhabited tracts are thus planted, and it is the\r\ngreatest possible solace to travellers. And this is done on all the\r\nways, where it can be of service. [The Great Kaan plants these trees\r\nall the more readily, because his astrologers and diviners tell him\r\nthat he who plants trees lives long.{1}\r\n\r\nBut where the ground is so sandy and desert that trees will not grow,\r\nhe causes other landmarks, pillars or stones, to be set up to show the\r\nway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—In this Kúblái imitated the great King Asoka, or\r\n  Priyadarsi, who in his graven edicts (_circa_ B.C. 250) on the Delhi\r\n  Pillar, says: “Along the high roads I have caused fig-trees to be\r\n  planted, that they may be for shade to animals and men. I have\r\n  also planted mango-trees; and at every half-coss I have caused\r\n  wells to be constructed, and resting-places for the night. And how\r\n  many hostels have been erected by me at various places for the\r\n  entertainment of man and beast.” (_J. A. S. B._ IV. 604.)

It is a liquor which they brew of rice with a quantity of\r\nexcellent spice, in such fashion that it makes better drink than any\r\nother kind of wine; it is not only good, but clear and pleasing to the\r\neye.{1} And being very hot stuff, it makes one drunk sooner than any\r\nother wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—The mode of making Chinese rice-wine is described in\r\n  Amyot’s _Mémoires_, V. 468 _seqq._ A kind of yeast is employed,\r\n  with which is often mixed a flour prepared from fragrant herbs,\r\n  almonds, pine-seeds, dried fruits, etc. Rubruquis says this liquor\r\n  was not distinguishable, except by smell, from the best wine of\r\n  Auxerre; a wine so famous in the Middle Ages, that the Historian\r\n  Friar, Salimbene, went from Lyons to Auxerre on purpose to drink\r\n  it.[1] Ysbrandt Ides compares the rice-wine to Rhenish; John Bell\r\n  to Canary; a modern traveller quoted by Davis, “in colour, and\r\n  a little in taste, to Madeira.” [Friar Odoric (_Cathay_, i. p.\r\n  117) calls this wine _bigni_; Dr. Schlegel (_T’oung Pao_, ii. p.\r\n  264) says Odoric’s wine was probably made with the date _Mi-yin_,\r\n  pronounced _Bi-im_ in old days. But Marco’s wine is made of rice,\r\n  and is called _shao hsing chiu_. Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 166,\r\n  note) writes: “There is another stronger liquor distilled from\r\n  millet, and called _shao chiu_: in Anglo-Chinese, _samshu_; Mongols\r\n  call it _araka_, _arrak_, and _arreki_. Ma Twan-lin (Bk. 327) says\r\n  that the Moho (the early Nu-chên Tartars) drank rice wine (_mi\r\n  chiu_), but I fancy that they, like the Mongols, got it from the\r\n  Chinese.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. Emil Bretschneider (_Botanicon Sinicum_, ii. pp. 154–158)\r\n  gives a most interesting account of the use and fabrication of\r\n  intoxicating beverages by the Chinese. “The invention of wine or\r\n  spirits in China,” he says, “is generally ascribed to a certain I\r\n  TI, who lived in the time of the Emperor Yü. According to others,\r\n  the inventor of wine was TU K’ANG.” One may refer also to Dr.\r\n  Macgowan’s paper _On the “Mutton Wine” of the Mongols and Analogous\r\n  Preparations of the Chinese_.

If you supply the fire with them at night,\r\nand see that they are well kindled, you will find them still alight\r\nin the morning; and they make such capital fuel that no other is used\r\nthroughout the country. It is true that they have plenty of wood also,\r\nbut they do not burn it, because those stones burn better and cost\r\nless.{1}\r\n\r\n[Moreover with that vast number of people, and the number of hot baths\r\nthat they maintain—for every one has such a bath at least three times\r\na week, and in winter if possible every day, whilst every nobleman and\r\nman of wealth has a private bath for his own use—the wood would not\r\nsuffice for the purpose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—There is a great consumption of coal in Northern China,\r\n  especially in the brick stoves, which are universal, even in poor\r\n  houses. Coal seems to exist in every one of the eighteen provinces\r\n  of China, which in this respect is justly pronounced to be one\r\n  of the most favoured countries in the world. Near the capital\r\n  coal is mined at Yuen-ming-yuen, and in a variety of isolated\r\n  deposits among the hills in the direction of the Kalgan road, and\r\n  in the district round Siuen-hwa-fu. (_Sindachu_ of Polo, _ante_\r\n  ch. lix.) But the most important coal-fields in relation to the\r\n  future are those of Shan-tung Hu-nan, Ho-nan, and Shan-si. The\r\n  last is eminently _the_ coal and iron province of China, and its\r\n  coal-field, as described by Baron Richthofen, combines, in an\r\n  extraordinary manner, all the advantages that can enhance the\r\n  value of such a field except (at present) that of facile export;\r\n  whilst the quantity available is so great that from Southern\r\n  Shan-si alone he estimates the whole world could be supplied,\r\n  at the present rate of consumption, for several thousand years.\r\n  “Adits, miles in length, could be driven within the body of the\r\n  coal.... These extraordinary conditions ... will eventually give\r\n  rise to some curious features in mining ... if a railroad should\r\n  ever be built from the plain to this region ... branches of it will\r\n  be constructed within the body of one or other of these beds of\r\n  anthracite.” Baron Richthofen, in the paper which we quote from,\r\n  indicates the revolution in the deposit of the world’s wealth and\r\n  power, to which such facts, combined with other characteristics\r\n  of China, point as probable; a revolution so vast that its\r\n  contemplation seems like that of a planetary catastrophe.\r\n\r\n  In the coal-fields of Hu-nan “the mines are chiefly opened where\r\n  the rivers intersect the inclined strata of the coal-measures and\r\n  allow the coal-beds to be attacked by the miner immediately at\r\n  their out-croppings.”\r\n\r\n  At the highest point of the Great Kiang, reached by Sarel and\r\n  Blakiston, they found mines on the cliffs over the river, from\r\n  which the coal was sent down by long bamboo cables, the loaded\r\n  baskets drawing up the empty ones.\r\n\r\n  [Many coal-fields have been explored since; one of the most\r\n  important is the coal-field of the Yun-nan province; the finest\r\n  deposits are perhaps those found in the bend of the Kiang; coal\r\n  is found also at Mong-Tzŭ, Lin-ngan, etc.; this rich coal region\r\n  has been explored in 1898 by the French engineer A. Leclère. (See\r\n  _Congrès int. Géog._, Paris, 1900, pp. 178–184.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  In various parts of China, as in Che-kiang, Sze-ch’wan, and at\r\n  Peking, they form powdered coal, mixed with mud, into bricks,\r\n  somewhat like our “patent fuel.” This practice is noticed by Ibn\r\n  Batuta, as well as the use of coal in making porcelain, though\r\n  this he seems to have misunderstood. Rashiduddin also mentions the\r\n  use of coal in China. It was in use, according to citations of\r\n  Pauthier’s, before the Christian era. It is a popular belief in\r\n  China, that every provincial capital is bound to be established\r\n  over a coal-field, so as to have a provision in case of siege. It\r\n  is said that during the British siege of Canton mines were opened\r\n  to the north of the city.\r\n\r\n  (_The Distribution of Coal in China_, by Baron Richthofen, in\r\n  _Ocean Highways_, N.S., I. 311; _Macgowan_ in _Ch.

And\r\nby this providence of the Emperor’s, his people can never suffer from\r\ndearth. He does the same over his whole Empire; causing these supplies\r\nto be stored everywhere, according to calculation of the wants and\r\nnecessities of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—“_Le fait si bien_ estuier _que il dure bien trois ans ou\r\n  quatre_” (Pauthier): “_si bien_ estudier” (G. T.). The word may be\r\n  _estiver_ (It. _stivare_), to stow, but I half suspect it should\r\n  be _estuver_ in the sense of “kiln-dry,” though both the Geog.\r\n  Latin and the Crusca render it _gubernare_.[1] Lecomte says: “Rice\r\n  is always stored in the public granaries for three or four years\r\n  in advance. It keeps long if care be taken to air it and stir it\r\n  about; and although not so good to the taste or look as new rice,\r\n  it is said to be more wholesome.”\r\n\r\n  The Archbishop of Soltania (A.D. 1330) speaks of these stores. “The\r\n  said Emperor is very pitiful and compassionate ... and so when\r\n  there is a dearth in the land he openeth his garners, and giveth\r\n  forth of his wheat and his rice for half what others are selling\r\n  it at.” Kúblái Kaan’s measures of this kind are recorded in the\r\n  annals of the Dynasty, as quoted by Pauthier. The same practice is\r\n  ascribed to the sovereigns of the T’ang Dynasty by the old Arab\r\n  _Relations_. In later days a missionary gives in the _Lettres\r\n  Edifiantes_ an unfavourable account of the action of these public\r\n  granaries, and of the rascality that occurred in connection with\r\n  them. (_Lecomte_, II. 101; _Cathay_, 240; _Relat._ I. 39; _Let.\r\n  Ed._ xxiv. 76.)\r\n\r\n  [The _Yuen-shi_ in ch. 96 contains sections on dispensaries (_Hui\r\n  min yao kü_), granary regulations (_Shi ti_), and regulations for\r\n  a time of dearth (_Chen Sü_).

C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] Marsden observes incidentally (_Hist. of Sumatra_, 1st edition, p.\r\n    71) that he was told in Bengal they used to dry-kiln the rice for\r\n    exportation, “owing to which, or to some other process, it will\r\n    continue good for several years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n              OF THE CHARITY OF THE EMPEROR TO THE POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have told you how the Great Kaan provides for the distribution of\r\nnecessaries to his people in time of dearth, by making store in time\r\nof cheapness. Now I will tell you of his alms and great charity to the\r\npoor of his city of Cambaluc.\r\n\r\nYou see he causes selection to be made of a number of families in\r\nthe city which are in a state of indigence, and of such families some\r\nmay consist of six in the house, some of eight, some of ten, more or\r\nfewer in each as it may hap, but the whole number being very great.\r\nAnd each family he causes annually to be supplied with wheat and other\r\ncorn sufficient for the whole year. And this he never fails to do every\r\nyear. Moreover, all those who choose to go to the daily dole at the\r\nCourt receive a great loaf apiece, hot from the baking, and nobody is\r\ndenied; for so the Lord hath ordered. And so some 30,000 people go\r\nfor it every day from year’s end to year’s end. Now this is a great\r\ngoodness in the Emperor to take pity of his poor people thus! And they\r\nbenefit so much by it that they worship him as he were God.\r\n\r\n[He also provides the poor with clothes. For he lays a tithe upon\r\nall wool, silk, hemp, and the like, from which clothing can be made;\r\nand he has these woven and laid up in a building set apart for the\r\npurpose; and as all artizans are bound to give a day’s labour weekly,\r\nin this way the Kaan has these stuffs made into clothing for those\r\npoor families, suitable for summer or winter, according to the time of\r\nyear. He also provides the clothing for his troops, and has woollens\r\nwoven for them in every city, the material for which is furnished by\r\nthe tithe aforesaid. You should know that the Tartars, before they were\r\nconverted to the religion of the Idolaters, never practised almsgiving.\r\nIndeed, when any poor man begged of them they would tell him, “Go\r\nwith God’s curse, for if He loved you as He loves me, He would have\r\nprovided for you.” But the sages of the Idolaters, and especially the\r\n_Bacsis_ mentioned before, told the Great Kaan that it was a good work\r\nto provide for the poor, and that his idols would be greatly pleased\r\nif he did so. And since then he has taken to do for the poor so much as\r\nyou have heard.{1}]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—This is a curious testimony to an ameliorating effect of\r\n  Buddhism on rude nations. The general establishment of medical\r\n  aid for men and animals is alluded to in the edicts of Asoka;[1]\r\n  and hospitals for the diseased and destitute were found by Fahian\r\n  at Palibothra, whilst Hiuen Tsang speaks of the distribution of\r\n  food and medicine at the _Punyasálás_ or “Houses of Beneficence,”\r\n  in the Panjáb. Various examples of a charitable spirit in Chinese\r\n  Institutions will be found in a letter by Père d’Entrecolles in\r\n  the XVth Recueil of _Lettres Edifiantes_; and a similar detail in\r\n  _Nevius’s China and the Chinese_, ch. xv. (See _Prinsep’s Essays_,\r\n  II. 15; _Beal’s Fah-hian_, 107; _Pèl. Boudd._ II. 190.) The Tartar\r\n  sentiment towards the poor survives on the Arctic shores:—“The\r\n  Yakuts regard the rich as favoured by the gods; the poor as\r\n  rejected and cast out by them.” (_Billings_, Fr. Tranls. I. 233.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[1] As rendered by J. Prinsep. But I see that Professor H. H. Wilson\r\n    did not admit the passage to bear that meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n         [CONCERNING THE ASTROLOGERS IN THE CITY OF CAMBALUC.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[There are in the city of Cambaluc, what with Christians, Saracens, and\r\nCathayans, some five thousand astrologers and soothsayers, whom the\r\nGreat Kaan provides with annual maintenance and clothing, just as he\r\nprovides the poor of whom we have spoken, and they are in the constant\r\nexercise of their art in this city.\r\n\r\nThey have a kind of astrolabe on which are inscribed the planetary\r\nsigns, the hours and critical points of the whole year. And every year\r\nthese Christian, Saracen, and Cathayan astrologers, each sect apart,\r\ninvestigate by means of this astrolabe the course and character of the\r\nwhole year, according to the indications of each of its Moons, in order\r\nto discover by the natural course and disposition of the planets, and\r\nthe other circumstances of the heavens, what shall be the nature of the\r\nweather, and what peculiarities shall be produced by each Moon of the\r\nyear; as, for example, under which Moon there shall be thunderstorms\r\nand tempests, under which there shall be disease, murrain, wars,\r\ndisorders, and treasons, and so on, according to the indications of\r\neach; but always adding that it lies with God to do less or more\r\naccording to His pleasure. And they write down the results of their\r\nexamination in certain little pamphlets for the year, which are called\r\n_Tacuin_, and these are sold for a groat to all who desire to know what\r\nis coming. Those of the astrologers, of course whose predictions are\r\nfound to be most exact, are held to be the greatest adepts in their\r\nart, and get the greater fame.{1}\r\n\r\nAnd if any one having some great matter in hand, or proposing to make a\r\nlong journey for traffic or other business, desires to know what will\r\nbe the upshot, he goes to one of these astrologers and says: “Turn up\r\nyour books and see what is the present aspect of the heavens, for I\r\nam going away on such and such a business.” Then the astrologer will\r\nreply that the applicant must also tell the year, month, and hour of\r\nhis birth; and when he has got that information he will see how the\r\nhoroscope of his nativity combines with the indications of the time\r\nwhen the question is put, and then he predicts the result, good or bad,\r\naccording to the aspect of the heavens.\r\n\r\nYou must know, too, that the Tartars reckon their years by twelves;\r\nthe sign of the first year being the Lion, of the second the Ox, of\r\nthe third the Dragon, of the fourth the Dog, and so forth up to the\r\ntwelfth;{2} so that when one is asked the year of his birth he answers\r\nthat it was in the year of the Lion (let us say), on such a day or\r\nnight, at such an hour, and such a moment. And the father of a child\r\nalways takes care to write these particulars down in a book. When the\r\ntwelve yearly symbols have been gone through, then they come back to\r\nthe first, and go through with them again in the same succession.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—It is odd that Marsden should have sought a Chinese\r\n  explanation of the Arabic word _Taḳwím_ even with Tavernier before\r\n  him: “They sell in Persia an annual almanac called _Tacuim_, which\r\n  is properly an ephemeris containing the longitude and latitude\r\n  of the planets, their conjunctions and oppositions, and other\r\n  such matter. The _Tacuim_ is full of predictions regarding war,\r\n  pestilence, and famine; it indicates the favourable time for\r\n  putting on new clothes, for getting bled or purged, for making a\r\n  journey, and so forth. They put entire faith in it, and whoever can\r\n  afford one governs himself in all things by its rules.” (Bk. V. ch.\r\n  xiv.)\r\n\r\n  The use of the term by Marco may possibly be an illustration of\r\n  what I have elsewhere propounded, viz. that he was not acquainted\r\n  with Chinese, but that his intercourse and conversation lay chiefly\r\n  with the foreigners at the Kaan’s Court, and probably was carried\r\n  on in the Persian language. But not long after the date of our Book\r\n  we find the word used in Italian by Jacopo Alighieri (Dante’s son):—\r\n\r\n      “A voler giudicare\r\n       Si conviene adequare\r\n       Inprimo il _Taccuino_,\r\n       Per vedere il cammino\r\n       Come i Pianeti vanno\r\n       Per tutto quanto l’anno.”\r\n                  —_Rime Antiche Toscane_, III. 10.\r\n\r\n  Marco does not allude to the fact that almanacs were published by\r\n  the Government, as they were then and still are. Pauthier (515\r\n  _seqq._) gives some very curious details on this subject from the\r\n  Annals of the Yuen. In the accounts of the year 1328, it appears\r\n  that no less than 3,123,185 copies were printed in three different\r\n  sizes at different prices, besides a separate almanac for the\r\n  _Hwei-Hwei_ or Mahomedans. Had Polo not omitted to touch on the\r\n  issue of almanacs by Government he could scarcely have failed to\r\n  enter on the subject of printing, on which he has kept a silence so\r\n  singular and unaccountable.\r\n\r\n  The Chinese Government still “considers the publication of a\r\n  Calendar of the first importance and utility. It must do everything\r\n  in its power, not only to point out to its numerous subjects the\r\n  distribution of the seasons, ... but on account of the general\r\n  superstition it must mark in the almanac the lucky and unlucky\r\n  days, the best days for being married, for undertaking a journey,\r\n  for making their dresses, for buying or building, for presenting\r\n  petitions to the Emperor, and for many other cases of ordinary\r\n  life. By this means the Government keeps the people within the\r\n  limits of humble obedience; it is for this reason that the Emperors\r\n  of China established the Academy of Astronomy.” (_Timk._ I. 358.)\r\n  The acceptance of the Imperial Almanac by a foreign Prince is\r\n  considered an acknowledgment of vassalage to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n  It is a penal offence to issue a pirated or counterfeit edition of\r\n  the Government Almanac. No one ventures to be without one, lest\r\n  he become liable to the greatest misfortunes by undertaking the\r\n  important measures on black-balled days.\r\n\r\n  The price varies now, according to Williams, from 1½_d._ to 5_d._\r\n  a copy. The price in 1328 was 1 _tsien_ or cash for the cheapest\r\n  edition, and 1 _liang_ or tael of silver for the _édition de luxe_;\r\n  but as these prices were in paper-money it is extremely difficult\r\n  to say, in the varying depreciation of that currency, what the\r\n  price really amounted to.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Mongol “Compendium Instrument” _Keen-e_ in the\r\n    Observatory Garden.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Mongol Armillary Sphere in the Observatory Garden.]\r\n\r\n  [“The Calendars for the use of the people, published by Imperial\r\n  command, are of two kinds. The first, _Wan-nien-shu, the Calendar\r\n  of Ten Thousand Years_, is an abridgment of the Calendar,\r\n  comprising 397 years, viz. from 1624 to 2020. The second and\r\n  more complete Calendar is the _Annual Calendar_, which, under\r\n  the preceding dynasties, was named _Li-je, Order of Days_, and\r\n  is now called _Shih-hsien-shu, Book of Constant Conformity (with\r\n  the Heavens)_. This name was given by the Emperor _Shun-chih_, in\r\n  the first year of his reign (1644), on being presented by Father\r\n  John Schall (_Tang Jo-wang_) with a new Calendar, calculated on\r\n  the principles of European science. This _Annual Calendar_ gives\r\n  the following indications: (1°) The cyclical signs of the current\r\n  year, of the months, and of all the days; (2°) the _long_ and\r\n  _short_ months, as well as the _intercalary_ month, as the case\r\n  may be; (3°) the designation of each day by the 5 _elements_, the\r\n  28 constellations, and the 12 _happy presages_; (4°) the day and\r\n  hour of the new moon, of the full moon, and of the two dichotomies,\r\n  _Shang-hsien_ and _Hsia-hsien_; (5°) the day and hour for the\r\n  _positions_ of the sun in the 24 zodiacal signs, calculated for the\r\n  various capitals of China as well as for Manchuria, Mongolia, and\r\n  the tributary Kingdoms; (6°) the hour of sunrise and sunset and the\r\n  length of day and night for the principal days of the month in the\r\n  several capitals; (7°) various superstitious indications purporting\r\n  to point out what days and hours are auspicious or not for such or\r\n  such affairs in different places. Those superstitious indications\r\n  are stated to have been introduced into the Calendar under the\r\n  _Yüan_ dynasty.” (_P. Hoang, Chinese Calendar_, pp. 2–3.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  We may note that in Polo’s time one of the principal officers of\r\n  the Mathematical Board was _Gaisue_, a native of _Folin_ or the\r\n  Byzantine Empire, who was also in charge of the medical department\r\n  of the Court. Regarding the Observatory, see note at p. 378,\r\n  _supra_.\r\n\r\n  And I am indebted yet again to the generous zeal of Mr. Wylie of\r\n  Shanghai, for the principal notes and extracts which will, I trust,\r\n  satisfy others as well as myself that the instruments in the garden\r\n  of the Observatory belong to the period of Marco Polo’s residence\r\n  in China.[1]\r\n\r\n  The objections to the alleged age of these instruments were\r\n  entirely based on an inspection of photographs. The opinion was\r\n  given very strongly that no instrument of the kind, so perfect in\r\n  theory and in execution, could have been even imagined in those\r\n  days, and that nothing of such scientific quality could have been\r\n  made except by the Jesuits. In fact it was asserted or implied that\r\n  these instruments must have been made about the year 1700, and were\r\n  therefore not earlier in age than those which stand on the terraced\r\n  roof of the Observatory, and are well known to most of us from the\r\n  representation in Duhalde and in many popular works.\r\n\r\n  The only authority that I could lay hand on was Lecomte, and what\r\n  he says was not conclusive. I extract the most pertinent passages:\r\n\r\n  “It was on the terrace of the tower that the Chinese astronomers\r\n  had set their instruments, and though few in number they occupied\r\n  the whole area. But Father Verbiest, the Director of the\r\n  Observatory, considering them useless for astronomical observation,\r\n  persuaded the Emperor to let them be removed, to make way for\r\n  several instruments of his own construction. The instruments set\r\n  aside by the European astronomers are still in a hall adjoining the\r\n  tower, buried in dust and oblivion; and we saw them only through a\r\n  grated window. They appeared to us to be very large and well cast,\r\n  in form approaching our astronomical circles; that is all that we\r\n  could make out. There was, however, thrown into a back yard by\r\n  itself, a celestial globe of bronze, of about 3 feet in diameter.\r\n  Of this we were able to take a nearer view. Its form was somewhat\r\n  oval; the divisions by no means exact, and the whole work coarse\r\n  enough.\r\n\r\n  “Besides this in a lower hall they had established a gnomon....\r\n  This observatory, not worthy of much consideration for its ancient\r\n  instruments, much less for its situation, its form, or its\r\n  construction, is now enriched by several bronze instruments which\r\n  Father Verbiest has placed there. These are large, well cast,\r\n  adorned in every case with figures of dragons,” etc. He then\r\n  proceeds to describe them:\r\n\r\n  “(1). Armillary Zodiacal Sphere of 6 feet diameter. This sphere\r\n  reposes on the heads of four dragons, the bodies of which after\r\n  various convolutions come to rest upon the extremities of two\r\n  brazen beams forming a cross, and thus bear the entire weight of\r\n  the instrument. These dragons ... are represented according to the\r\n  notion the Chinese form of them, enveloped in clouds, covered above\r\n  the horns with long hair, with a tufted beard on the lower jaw,\r\n  flaming eyes, long sharp teeth, the gaping throat ever vomiting a\r\n  torrent of fire. Four lion-cubs of the same material bear the ends\r\n  of the cross beams, and the heads of these are raised or depressed\r\n  by means of attached screws, according to what is required. The\r\n  circles are divided on both exterior and interior surface into\r\n  360 degrees; each degree into 60 minutes by transverse lines, and\r\n  the minutes into sections of 10 seconds each by the sight-edge[2]\r\n  applied to them.”\r\n\r\n  Of Verbiest’s other instruments we need give only the names: (2)\r\n  Equinoxial Sphere, 6 feet diameter. (3) Azimuthal Horizon, same\r\n  diam. (4) Great Quadrant, of 6 feet radius. (5) Sextant of about 8\r\n  feet radius. (6) Celestial Globe of 6 feet diameter.\r\n\r\n  As Lecomte gives no details of the old instruments which he\r\n  saw through a grating, and as the description of this zodiacal\r\n  sphere (No. 1) corresponds in some of its main features with\r\n  that represented in the photograph, I could not but recognize\r\n  the _possibility_ that this instrument of Verbiest’s had for\r\n  some reason or other been removed from the Terrace, and that the\r\n  photograph might therefore possibly _not_ be a representation of\r\n  one of the ancient instruments displaced by him.[3]\r\n\r\n  The question having been raised it was very desirable to settle\r\n  it, and I applied to Mr. Wylie for information, as I had received\r\n  the photographs from him, and knew that he had been Mr. Thomson’s\r\n  companion and helper in the matter.\r\n\r\n  “Let me assure you,” he writes (21st August, 1874), “the Jesuits\r\n  had nothing to do with the manufacture of the so-called Mongol\r\n  instruments; and whoever made them, they were certainly on the\r\n  Peking Observatory before Loyola was born. They are not made\r\n  for the astronomical system introduced by the Jesuits, but are\r\n  altogether conformable to the system introduced by Kúblái’s\r\n  astronomer Ko Show-king.... I will mention one thing which is\r\n  quite decisive as to the Jesuits. _The circle is divided into 365¼\r\n  degrees_, each degree into 100 minutes, and each minute into 100\r\n  seconds. The Jesuits always used the sexagesimal division. Lecomte\r\n  speaks of the imperfection of the division on the Jesuit-made\r\n  instruments; but _those on the Mongol instruments are immeasurably\r\n  coarser_.\r\n\r\n  “I understand it is not the ornamentation your friend objects\r\n  to?[4] If it is, I would observe that there is no evidence of\r\n  progress in the decorative and ornamental arts during the Ming\r\n  Dynasty; and even in the Jesuit instruments that part of the\r\n  work is purely Chinese, excepting in one instrument, which I am\r\n  persuaded must have been made in Europe.\r\n\r\n  “I have a Chinese work called _Luh-King-t’oo-Kaou_, ‘Illustrations\r\n  and Investigations of the Six Classics.’ This was written in A.D.\r\n  1131–1162, and revised and printed in 1165–1174. It contains a\r\n  representation of an armillary sphere, which appears to me to be\r\n  much the same as the sphere in question. There is a solid horizon\r\n  fixed to a graduated outer circle. Inside the latter is a meridian\r\n  circle, at right angles to which is a graduated colure; then the\r\n  equator, apparently a double ring, and the ecliptic; also two\r\n  diametric bars. The cut is rudely executed, but it certainly shows\r\n  that some one imagined something more perfect. The instrument\r\n  stands on a cross frame, with 4 dragon supporters and a prop in the\r\n  centre.[5]\r\n\r\n  “It should be remembered that under the Mongol Dynasty the\r\n  Chinese had much intercourse with Central Asia; and among others\r\n  Yelewchootsae, as confidential minister and astronomer, followed\r\n  Chinghiz in his Western campaign, held intercourse with the\r\n  astronomers of Samarkand, and on his return laid some astronomical\r\n  inventions before the Emperor.\r\n\r\n  “I append a notice of the Observatory taken from a popular\r\n  description of Peking, by which it will be seen that the\r\n  construction of these instruments is attributed to Ko Show-king,\r\n  one of the most renowned astronomers of China. He was the chief\r\n  astronomer under Kúblái Kaan” [to whom he was presented in 1262; he\r\n  was born in 1231.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  “It must be remembered that there was a special vitality among the\r\n  Chinese under the Yuen with regard to the arts and sciences, and\r\n  the Emperor had the choice of artizans and men of science from\r\n  all countries. From the age of the Yuen till the arrival of the\r\n  Jesuits, we hear nothing of any new instruments having been made;\r\n  and it is well known that astronomy was never in a lower condition\r\n  than under the Ming.”[6]\r\n\r\n  Mr. Wylie then draws attention to the account given by Trigault\r\n  of the instruments that Matteo Ricci saw at Nanking, when he went\r\n  (in the year 1599) to pay a visit to some of the _literati_ of\r\n  that city. He transcribes the account from the French _Hist. de\r\n  l’Expédition Chrestienne en la Chine_, 1618. But as I have the\r\n  Latin, which is the original and is more lucid, by me, I will\r\n  translate from that.[7]\r\n\r\n  “Not only at Peking, but in this capital also (Nanking) there is a\r\n  College of Chinese Mathematicians, and this one certainly is more\r\n  distinguished by the vastness of its buildings than by the skill\r\n  of its professors. They have little talent and less learning, and\r\n  do nothing beyond the preparation of the almanacs on the rules\r\n  of calculation made by the ancients; and when it chances that\r\n  events do not agree with their calculation they assert that what\r\n  they had calculated was the regular course of things, but that\r\n  the aberrant conduct of the stars was a prognostic from heaven of\r\n  something going to happen on the earth. This something they make\r\n  out according to their fancy, and so spread a veil over their\r\n  own blunders. These gentlemen did not much trust Father Matteo,\r\n  fearing, no doubt, lest he should put them to shame; but when at\r\n  last they were freed from this apprehension they came and amicably\r\n  visited the Father in hope of learning something from him. And when\r\n  he went to return their visit he saw something that really was new\r\n  and beyond his expectation.\r\n\r\n  “There is a high hill at one side of the city, but still within the\r\n  walls. On the top of the hill there is an ample terrace, capitally\r\n  adapted for astronomical observation, and surrounded by magnificent\r\n  buildings which form the residence of the Professors.... On this\r\n  terrace are to be seen astronomical instruments of cast-metal,\r\n  well worthy of inspection whether for size or for beauty; _and we\r\n  certainly have never seen or read of anything in Europe like them_.\r\n  For nearly 250 years they have stood thus exposed to the rain, the\r\n  snow, and all other atmospheric inclemencies, and yet they have\r\n  lost absolutely nothing of their original lustre. And lest I should\r\n  be accused of raising expectations which I do not justify, I will\r\n  do my best in a digression, probably not unwelcome, to bring them\r\n  before the eyes of my readers.\r\n\r\n  “The larger of these instruments were four in number. First\r\n  we inspected a great globe [A], graduated with meridians and\r\n  parallels; we estimated that three men would hardly be able to\r\n  embrace its girth.... A second instrument was a great sphere [B],\r\n  not less in diameter than that measure of the outstretched arms\r\n  which is commonly called a geometric pace. It had a horizon and\r\n  poles; instead of circles it was provided with certain double\r\n  hoops (_armillæ_), the void space between the pair serving the\r\n  purpose of the circles of our spheres. All these were divided into\r\n  365 degrees and some odd minutes. There was no globe to represent\r\n  the earth in the centre, but there was a certain tube, bored like\r\n  a gun-barrel, which could readily be turned about and fixed to\r\n  any azimuth or any altitude so as to observe any particular star\r\n  through the tube, just as we do with our vane-sights;[8]—not at all\r\n  a despicable device! The third machine was a gnomon [C], the height\r\n  of which was twice the diameter of the former instrument, erected\r\n  on a very large and long slab of marble, on the northern side of\r\n  the terrace. The stone slab had a channel cut round the margin, to\r\n  be filled with water in order to determine whether the slab was\r\n  level or not, and the style was set vertical as in hour-dials.[9]\r\n  We may suppose this gnomon to have been erected that by its aid the\r\n  shadow at the solstices and equinoxes might be precisely noted, for\r\n  in that view both the slab and the style were graduated. The fourth\r\n  and last instrument, and the largest of all, was one consisting\r\n  as it were of three or four huge astrolabes in juxtaposition [D];\r\n  each of them having a diameter of such a geometrical pace as I\r\n  have specified. The fiducial line, or _Alhidada_, as it is called,\r\n  was not lacking, nor yet the _Dioptra_.[10] Of these astrolabes,\r\n  one having a tilted position in the direction of the south,\r\n  represented the equator; a second, which stood crosswise on the\r\n  first, in a north and south plane, the Father took for a meridian;\r\n  but it could be turned round on its axis; a third stood in the\r\n  meridian plane with its axis perpendicular, and seemed to stand\r\n  for a vertical circle; but this also could be turned round so as\r\n  to show any vertical whatever. Moreover all these were graduated,\r\n  and the degrees marked by prominent studs of iron, so that in the\r\n  night the graduation could be read by the touch without a light.\r\n  All this compound astrolabe instrument was erected on a level\r\n  marble platform with channels round it for levelling. On each\r\n  of these instruments explanations of everything were given in\r\n  Chinese characters; and there were also engraved the 24 zodiacal\r\n  constellations which answer to our 12 signs, 2 to each.[11] There\r\n  was, however, one error common to all the instruments, viz. that,\r\n  in all, the elevation of the Pole was assumed to be 36°. Now there\r\n  can be no question about the fact that the city of Nanking lies in\r\n  lat. 32¼°; whence it would seem probable that these instruments\r\n  were made for another locality, and had been erected at Nanking,\r\n  without reference to its position, by some one ill versed in\r\n  mathematical science.[12]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Observatory Terrace.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Observatory Instruments of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\n  “Some years afterwards Father Matteo saw similar instruments at\r\n  Peking, or rather the same instruments, so exactly alike were\r\n  they, insomuch that they had unquestionably been made by the\r\n  same artist. And indeed it is known that they were cast at the\r\n  period when the Tartars were dominant in China; and we may without\r\n  rashness conjecture that they were the work of some foreigner\r\n  acquainted with our studies. But it is time to have done with these\r\n  instruments.”—(_Lib._ IV. _cap._ 5.)\r\n\r\n  In this interesting description it will be seen that the Armillary\r\n  Sphere [B] agrees entirely with that represented in illustration\r\n  facing p. 450. And the second of his photographs in my possession,\r\n  but not, I believe, yet published, answers _perfectly_ to the\r\n  curious description of the 4th instrument [D]. Indeed, I should\r\n  scarcely have been able to translate that description intelligibly\r\n  but for the aid of the photograph before me. It shows the three\r\n  _astrolabes_ or graduated circles with travelling indexes arranged\r\n  exactly as described, and pivoted on a complex frame of bronze; (1)\r\n  circle in the plane of the equator for measuring right ascensions;\r\n  (2) circle with its axis vertical to the plane of the last, for\r\n  measuring declinations: (3) circle with vertical axis, for zenith\r\n  distances? The Gnomon [A] was seen by Mr. Wylie in one of the lower\r\n  rooms of the Observatory (see below). Of the Globe we do not now\r\n  hear; and that mentioned by Lecomte among the ancient instruments\r\n  was inferior to what Ricci describes at Peking.\r\n\r\n  I now transcribe Mr. Wylie’s translation of an extract from a\r\n  Popular Description of Peking:\r\n\r\n  “The observatory is on an elevated stage on the city wall, in the\r\n  south-east corner of the (Tartar) city, and was built in the year\r\n  (A.D. 1279). In the centre was the _Tze-wei_[13] Palace, inside\r\n  of which were a pair of scrolls, and a cross inscription, by\r\n  the imperial hand. Formerly it contained the _Hwan-t’ien-e_ [B]\r\n  ‘Armillary Sphere’; the _Keen-e_ [D?] ‘Transit Instrument’ (?);\r\n  the _Tung-kew_ [A] ‘Brass Globe’; and the _Leang-t’ien-ch’ih_,\r\n  ‘Sector,’ which were constructed by Ko Show-king under the Yuen\r\n  Dynasty.\r\n\r\n  “In (1673) the old instruments having stood the wear of long past\r\n  years, had become almost useless, and six new instruments were\r\n  made by imperial authority. These were the _T’ien-t’ee_ ‘Celestial\r\n  Globe’ (6); _Chih-taoue_ ‘Equinoctial Sphere’ (2); _Hwang-taoue_\r\n  ‘Zodiacal Sphere’ (1); _Te-p’ing kinge_ ‘Azimuthal Horizon’ (3);\r\n  _Te-p’ing weie_ ‘Altitude Instrument’ (4); _Ke-yene_ ‘Sextant’\r\n  (5). These were placed in the Observatory, and to the present\r\n  day are respectfully used. The old instruments were at the same\r\n  time removed, and deposited at the foot of the stage. In (1715)\r\n  the _Te-ping King-wei-e_ ‘Azimuth and Altitude Instrument’ was\r\n  made;[14] and in 1744 the _Ke-hang-foo-chin-e_ (literally ‘Sphere\r\n  and Tube instrument for sweeping the heavens’). All these were\r\n  placed on the Observatory stage.\r\n\r\n  “There is a wind-index-pole called the ‘Fair-wind-pennon,’ on which\r\n  is an iron disk marked out in 28 points, corresponding in number to\r\n  the 28 constellations.”[15]\r\n\r\n  ✛ Mr. Wylie justly observes that the evidence is all in accord,\r\n  and it leaves, I think, no reasonable room for doubt that the\r\n  instruments now in the Observatory garden at Peking are those\r\n  which were cast aside by Father Verbiest[16] in 1673 (or 1668);\r\n  which Father Ricci saw at Peking at the beginning of the century,\r\n  and of which he has described the duplicates at Nanking; and which\r\n  had come down from the time of the Mongols, or, more precisely, of\r\n  Kúblái Khan.\r\n\r\n  Ricci speaks of their age as nearly 250 years in 1599; Verbiest\r\n  as nearly 300 years in 1668. But these estimates evidently point\r\n  to the _termination_ of the Mongol Dynasty (1368), to which the\r\n  Chinese would naturally refer their oral chronology. We have seen\r\n  that Kúblái’s reign was the era of flourishing astronomy, and that\r\n  the instruments are referred to his astronomer Ko Shéu-king; nor\r\n  does there seem any ground for questioning this. In fact, it being\r\n  once established that the instruments existed when the Jesuits\r\n  entered China, all the objections fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n  We may observe that the _number_ of the ancient instruments\r\n  mentioned in the popular Chinese account agrees with the number of\r\n  important instruments described by Ricci, and the titles of three\r\n  at least out of the four seem to indicate the same instruments. The\r\n  catalogue of the new instruments of 1673 (or 1668) given in the\r\n  native work also agrees _exactly_ with that given by Lecomte.[17]\r\n  And in reference to my question as to the _possibility_ that one\r\n  of Verbiest’s instruments might have been removed from the terrace\r\n  to the garden, it is now hardly worth while to repeat Mr. Wylie’s\r\n  assurance that there is no ground whatever for such a supposition.\r\n  The instruments represented by Lecomte are all still on the\r\n  terrace, only their positions have been somewhat altered to make\r\n  room for the two added in last century.\r\n\r\n  Probably, says Mr. Wylie, more might have been added from Chinese\r\n  works, especially the biography of Ko Shéu-king. But my kind\r\n  correspondent was unable to travel beyond the books on his own\r\n  shelves. Nor was it needful.\r\n\r\n  It will have been seen that, beautiful as the art and casting of\r\n  these instruments is, it would be a mistake to suppose that they\r\n  are entitled to equally high rank in scientific accuracy. Mr.\r\n  Wylie mentioned the question that had been started to Freiherr\r\n  von Gumpach, who was for some years Professor of Astronomy in the\r\n  Peking College. Whilst entirely rejecting the doubts that had been\r\n  raised as to the age of the Mongol instruments, he said that he had\r\n  seen those of Tycho Brahe, and the former are quite unworthy to be\r\n  compared with Tycho’s in scientific accuracy.\r\n\r\n  The doubts expressed have been useful in drawing attention to these\r\n  remarkable reliques of the era of Kúblái’s reign, and of Marco\r\n  Polo’s residence in Cathay, though I fear they are answerable for\r\n  having added some pages to a work that required no enlargement!\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Wylie sent a most valuable paper on _The Mongol Astronomical\r\n  Instruments at Peking_ to the Congress of Orientalists held at St.\r\n  Petersburg, which was reprinted at Shanghai in 1897 in _Chinese\r\n  Researches_. Some of the astronomical instruments have been removed\r\n  to Potsdam by the Germans since the siege of the foreign Legations\r\n  at Peking in 1900.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  On these auguries, and on diviners and fortune-tellers, see\r\n  _Semedo_, p. 118 _seqq._; _Kidd_, p. 313 (also for preceding\r\n  references, _Mid. Kingdom_, II. 152; _Gaubil_, 136).\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—✛ The real cycle of the Mongols, which was also that of\r\n  the Chinese, runs: 1. Rat; 2. Ox; 3. Tiger; 4. Hare; 5. Dragon; 6.\r\n  Serpent; 7. Horse; 8. Sheep; 9. Ape; 10. Cock; 11. Dog; 12. Swine.\r\n  But as such a cycle [12 earthly branches, _Ti-chih_] is too short\r\n  to avoid confusion, it is combined with a co-efficient cycle of\r\n  _ten_ epithets [celestial Stems, _T’ien-kan_] in such wise as to\r\n  produce a 60-year cycle of compound names before the same shall\r\n  recur. These co-efficient epithets are found in four different\r\n  forms: (1) From the Elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water,\r\n  attaching to each a masculine and feminine attribute so as to make\r\n  ten epithets. (2) From the Colours: Blue, Red, Yellow, White,\r\n  Black, similarly treated. (3) By terms without meaning in Mongol,\r\n  directly adopted or imitated from the Chinese, _Ga_, Yi, Bing,\r\n  Ting, etc. (4) By the five Cardinal Points: East, South, Middle,\r\n  West, North. Thus 1864 was the first year of a 60-year cycle:—\r\n\r\n      1864 = (Masc.) _Wood-Rat_ Year    = (Masc.) _Blue-Rat_ Year.\r\n      1865 = (Fem.)  _Wood-Ox_ Year     = (Fem.)  _Blue-Ox_ Year.\r\n      1866 = (Masc.) _Fire-Tiger_ Year  = (Masc.) _Red-Tiger_ Year.\r\n      1867 = (Fem.)  _Fire-Hare_ Year   = (Fem.)  _Red-Hare_ Year.\r\n      1923 = (Fem.)  _Water-Swine_ Year = (Fem.)  _Black-Swine_ Year.\r\n\r\n  And then a new cycle commences just as before.\r\n\r\n  This Calendar was carried by the Mongols into all their\r\n  dominions, and it would appear to have long survived them in\r\n  Persia. Thus a document issued in favour of Sir John Chardin by\r\n  the _Shaikh-ul-Islám_ of Ispahan, bears the strange date for a\r\n  Mahomedan luminary of “The year of the Swine.” The Hindus also had\r\n  a 60-year cycle, but with them each year had an independent name.\r\n\r\n  The Mongols borrowed their system from the Chinese, who attribute\r\n  its invention to the Emperor Hwang-ti, and its initiation to the\r\n  61st year of his reign, corresponding to B.C. 2637. [“It was\r\n  Ta-nao, Minister to the Emperor Hwang-ti, who, by command of his\r\n  Sovereign, devised the sexagenary cycle. Hwang-ti began to reign\r\n  2697 B.C., and the 61st year of his reign was taken for the first\r\n  cyclical sign.” _P. Hoang_, _Chinese Calendar_, p. 11.—H. C.] The\r\n  characters representing what we have called the ten co-efficient\r\n  epithets are called by the Chinese the “Heavenly Stems”; those\r\n  equivalent to the twelve animal symbols are the “Earthly Branches,”\r\n  and they are applied in their combinations not to years only, but\r\n  to cycles of months, days, and hours, such hours being equal to\r\n  two of ours. Thus every year, month, day, and hour will have two\r\n  appropriate characters, and the four pairs belonging to the time\r\n  of any man’s birth constitute what the Chinese call the “Eight\r\n  Characters” of his age, to which constant reference is made in\r\n  some of their systems of fortune-telling, and in the selection\r\n  of propitious days for the transaction of business. To this\r\n  system the text alludes. A curious account of the principles of\r\n  prognostication on such a basis will be found in _Doolittle’s\r\n  Social Life of the Chinese_ (p. 579 _seqq._; on the Calendar, see\r\n  Schmidt’s Preface to _S. Setzen_; _Pallas, Sammlungen_, II. 228\r\n  _seqq._; _Prinsep’s Essays_, _Useful Tables_, 146).\r\n\r\n  [“Kubilai Khan established in Peking two astronomical boards\r\n  and two observatories. One of them was a Chinese Observatory\r\n  (_sze t’ien t’ai_), the other a Mohammedan Observatory (_hui\r\n  hui sze t’ien t’ai_), each with its particular astronomical and\r\n  chronological systems, its particular astrology and instruments.\r\n  The first astronomical and calendar system was compiled for the\r\n  Mongols by Ye-liu Ch’u-ts’ai, who was in Chingis Khan’s service,\r\n  not only as a high counsellor, but also as an astronomer and\r\n  astrologer. After having been convinced of the obsoleteness and\r\n  incorrectness of the astronomical calculations in the _Ta ming li_\r\n  (the name of the calendar system of the Kin Dynasty), he thought\r\n  out at the time he was at Samarcand a new system, valid not only\r\n  for China, but also for the countries conquered by the Mongols in\r\n  Western Asia, and named it in memory of Chingis Khan’s expedition\r\n  _Si ching keng wu yüan li_, _i.e._ ‘Astronomical Calendar\r\n  beginning with the year _Keng wu_, compiled during the war in the\r\n  west.’ Keng-wu was the year 1210 of our era. Ye-liu Ch’u-ts’ai\r\n  chose this year, and the moment of the winter solstice, for the\r\n  beginning of his period; because, according to his calculations,\r\n  it coincided with the beginning of a new astronomical or planetary\r\n  period. He took also into consideration, that since the year 1211\r\n  Chingis Khan’s glory had spread over the whole world. Ye-liu\r\n  Ch’u-ts’ai’s calendar was not adopted in China, but the system of\r\n  it is explained in the _Yuen-shi_, in the section on Astronomy and\r\n  the Calendar.\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1267, the Mohammedans presented to Kubilai their\r\n  astronomical calendar (_wan nien li_, _i.e._), the calendar of\r\n  ten thousand years. By taking this denomination in its literal\r\n  sense, we may conclude that the Mahommedans brought to China the\r\n  ancient Persian system, founded on the period of 10,000 years.\r\n  The compilers of the _Yuen-shi_ seem not to have had access to\r\n  documents relating to this system, for they give no details\r\n  about it. Finally by order of Kubilai the astronomers _Hui-Heng_\r\n  and _Ko Show-King_ composed a new calculation under the name\r\n  of _Shou-shi-li_, which came into use from the year 1280. It is\r\n  thoroughly explained in the _Yuen-shi_. Notwithstanding the fame\r\n  this system generally enjoyed, its blemishes came soon to light.\r\n  In the sixth month of 1302 an eclipse of the sun happened, and the\r\n  calculation of the astronomer proved to be erroneous (it seems\r\n  the calculation had anticipated the real time). The astronomers\r\n  of the Ming Dynasty explained the errors in the _Shou-shi-li_ by\r\n  the circumstance, that in that calculation the period for one\r\n  degree of precession of the equinox was taken too long (eighty-one\r\n  years). But they were themselves hardly able to overcome these\r\n  difficulties.” (_Palladius_, pp. 51–53.)—H.

Williams’s _Observations of Comets\r\n    ... extracted from the Chinese Annals_, London, 1871.\r\n\r\n[2] _Pinnula_. The French _pinnule_ is properly a sight-vane at the end\r\n    of a traversing bar. The _transverse lines_ imply that minutes were\r\n    read by the system of our _diagonal scales_; and these I understand\r\n    to have been subdivided still further by aid of a divided edge\r\n    attached to the sight-vane; qu. a Vernier?\r\n\r\n[3] Verbiest himself speaks of the displaced instruments thus ... “ut\r\n    nova instrumenta astronomica facienda mihi imponeret, quæ scilicet\r\n    more Europæo affabre facta, et in specula Astroptica Pekinensi\r\n    collocata, æternam Imperii Tartarici memoriam apud posteritatem\r\n    servarent, _prioribus instrumentis Sinicis rudioris Minervæ,\r\n    quæ jam a_ trecentis _proxime_ annis _speculam occupabant, inde\r\n    amotis_. Imperator statim annuit illorum postulatis, et totius\r\n    rei curam, publico diplomate mihi imposuit. Ego itaque intra\r\n    quadriennis spatium sex diversi generis instrumenta confeci.” This\r\n    is from an account of the Observatory written by Verbiest himself,\r\n    and printed at Peking in 1668 (_Liber Organicus Astronomiæ\r\n    Europææ apud Sinas Restitutæ_, etc.). My friend Mr. D. Hanbury\r\n    made the extract from a copy of this rare book in the London\r\n    Institution Library. An enlarged edition was published in Europe.\r\n    (Dillingen, 1687.)\r\n\r\n[4] On the contrary, he considered the photographs interesting, as\r\n    showing to how late a period the art of fine casting had endured.\r\n\r\n[5] This ancient instrument is probably the same that is engraved in\r\n    Pauthier’s _Chine Ancienne_ under the title of “The Sphere of the\r\n    Emperor Shun” (B.C. 2255!).\r\n\r\n[6] After the death of Kúblái astronomy fell into neglect, and when\r\n    Hongwu, the first Ming sovereign, took the throne (1368) the\r\n    subject was almost forgotten. Nor was there any revival till the\r\n    time of Ching. The latter was a prince who in 1573 associated\r\n    himself with the astronomer Hing-yun-lu to reform the state of\r\n    astronomy. (_Gaubil_.)\r\n\r\n    What Ricci has recorded (in Trigautius) of the dense ignorance\r\n    of the Chinese _literati_ in astronomical matters is entirely\r\n    consistent with the preceding statements.\r\n\r\n[7] I had entirely forgotten to look at Trigault till Mr. Wylie sent\r\n    me the extract. The copy I use (_De Christianâ Expeditione apud\r\n    Sinas ... Auct. Nicolao Trigautio_) is of _Lugdun_. 1616. The first\r\n    edition was published at _August. Vindelicorum_ (Augsburg) in 1615:\r\n    the French, at Lyons, in 1616.\r\n\r\n[8] “Pinnulis.”\r\n\r\n[9] “_Et stilus eo modo quo in horologiis ad perpendiculum collocatus_.”\r\n\r\n[10] The _Alidada_ is the traversing index bar which carries the\r\n    _dioptra_, _pinnules_, or sight-vanes. The word is found in some\r\n    older English Dictionaries, and in France and Italy is still\r\n    applied to the traversing index of a plane table or of a sextant.\r\n    Littré derives it from (Ar.) _’adád_, enumeration; but it is really\r\n    from a quite different word, _al-iḍádat_ عضادة “a door-post,” which\r\n    is found in this sense in an Arabic treatise on the Astrolabe. (See\r\n    _Dozy and Engelmann_, p. 140.)\r\n\r\n[11] This is an error of Ricci’s, as Mr. Wylie observes, or of his\r\n    reporter.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese divide their year into 24 portions of 15 days each.\r\n    Of these 24 divisions twelve called _Kung_ mark the twelve places\r\n    in which the sun and moon come into conjunction, and are thus in\r\n    some degree analogous to our 12 signs of the Zodiac. The names of\r\n    these _Kung_ are entirely different from those of our sign, though\r\n    since the 17th century the Western Zodiac, with paraphrased names,\r\n    has been introduced in some of their books. But besides that, they\r\n    divide the heavens into 28 stellar spaces. The correspondence of\r\n    this division to the Hindu system of the 28 Lunar Mansions, called\r\n    _Nakshatras_, has given rise to much discussion. The Chinese _sieu_\r\n    or stellar spaces are excessively unequal, varying from 24° in\r\n    equatorial extent down to 24′. (_Williams_, op. cit.) [See _P.\r\n    Hoang_, _supra_ p. 449.]\r\n\r\n[12] Mr. Wylie is inclined to distrust the accuracy of this remark, as\r\n    the only city nearly on the 36th parallel is P’ing-yang fu.\r\n\r\n    But we have noted in regard to this (Polo’s Pianfu, vol. ii. p. 17)\r\n    that a college for the education of Mongol youth was instituted\r\n    here, by the great minister Yeliu Chutsai, whose devotion to\r\n    astronomy Mr. Wylie has noticed above. In fact, two colleges were\r\n    established by him, one at Yenking, _i.e._ Peking, the other at\r\n    P’ing-yang; and astronomy is specified as one of the studies to be\r\n    pursued at these. (See _D’Ohsson_, II. 71–72, quoting _De Mailla_.)\r\n    It seems highly probable that the two sets of instruments were\r\n    originally intended for these two institutions, and that one set\r\n    was carried to Nanking, when the Ming set their capital there in\r\n    1368.\r\n\r\n[13] The 28 _sieu_ or stellar spaces, above spoken of, do not extend to\r\n    the Pole; they are indeed very unequal in extent on the meridian\r\n    as well as on the equator. And the area in the northern sky not\r\n    embraced in them is divided into three large spaces called _Yuen_\r\n    or enclosures, of which the field of circumpolar stars (or circle\r\n    of perpetual apparition) forms one which is called _Tze-Wei_.\r\n    (_Williams_.)\r\n\r\n    The southern circumpolar stars form a fourth space, beyond the 28\r\n    _sieu_. _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[14] “This was obviously made in France. There is nothing Chinese about\r\n    it, either in construction or ornament. It is very different from\r\n    all the others.” (_Note by Mr. Wylie._)\r\n\r\n[15] “There follows a minute description of the brass clepsydra, and\r\n    the brass gnomon, which it is unnecessary to translate. I have seen\r\n    both these instruments, in two of the lower rooms.”—Id.\r\n\r\n[16] [Ferdinand Verbiest, S.J., was born at Pitthens, near Courtrai; he\r\n    arrived in China in 1659 and died at Peking on the 29th January,\r\n    1688.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n[17] We have attached letters A, B, C, to indicate the correspondences\r\n    of the ancient instruments, and cyphers 1, 2, 3, to indicate the\r\n    correspondences of the modern instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n     CONCERNING THE RELIGION OF THE CATHAYANS;{1} THEIR VIEWS\r\n                  AS TO THE SOUL; AND THEIR CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, these people are Idolaters, and as regards\r\ntheir gods, each has a tablet fixed high up on the wall of his chamber,\r\non which is inscribed a name which represents the Most High and\r\nHeavenly God; and before this they pay daily worship, offering incense\r\nfrom a thurible, raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth{2}\r\nthree times, praying Him to grant them health of mind and body; but of\r\nHim they ask nought else. And below on the ground there is a figure\r\nwhich they call _Natigai_, which is the god of things terrestrial. To\r\nhim they give a wife and children, and they worship him in the same\r\nmanner, with incense, and gnashing of teeth,{2} and lifting up of\r\nhands; and of him they ask seasonable weather, and the fruits of the\r\nearth, children, and so forth.{3}\r\n\r\nTheir view of the immortality of the soul is after this fashion. They\r\nbelieve that as soon as a man dies, his soul enters into another body,\r\ngoing from a good to a better, or from a bad to a worse, according as\r\nhe hath conducted himself well or ill. That is to say, a poor man, if\r\nhe have passed through life good and sober, shall be born again of a\r\ngentlewoman, and shall be a gentleman; and on a second occasion shall\r\nbe born of a princess and shall be a prince, and so on, always rising,\r\ntill he be absorbed into the Deity. But if he have borne himself ill,\r\nhe who was the son of a gentleman shall be reborn as the son of a boor,\r\nand from a boor shall become a dog, always going down lower and lower.\r\n\r\nThe people have an ornate style of speech; they salute each other with\r\na cheerful countenance, and with great politeness; they behave like\r\ngentlemen, and eat with great propriety.{4} They show great respect to\r\ntheir parents; and should there be any son who offends his parents, or\r\nfails to minister to their necessities, there is a public office which\r\nhas no other charge but that of punishing unnatural children, who are\r\nproved to have acted with ingratitude towards their parents.{5}\r\n\r\nCriminals of sundry kinds who have been imprisoned, are released at\r\na time fixed by the Great Kaan (which occurs every three years), but\r\non leaving prison they are branded on one cheek that they may be\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe Great Kaan hath prohibited all gambling and sharping, things more\r\nprevalent there than in any other part of the world. In doing this, he\r\nsaid: “I have conquered you by force of arms, and all that you have is\r\nmine; if, therefore, you gamble away your property, it is in fact my\r\nproperty that you are gambling away.” Not that he took anything from\r\nthem however.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to tell you of the orderly way in which the Kaan’s\r\nBarons and others conduct themselves in coming to his presence. In\r\nthe first place, within a half mile of the place where he is, out of\r\nreverence for his exalted majesty, everybody preserves a mien of the\r\ngreatest meekness and quiet, so that no noise of shrill voices or loud\r\ntalk shall be heard. And every one of the chiefs and nobles carries\r\nalways with him a handsome little vessel to spit in whilst he remain\r\nin the Hall of Audience—for no one dares spit on the floor of the\r\nhall,—and when he hath spitten he covers it up and puts it aside.{6}\r\nSo also they all have certain handsome buskins of white leather, which\r\nthey carry with them, and, when summoned by the sovereign, on arriving\r\nat the entrance to the hall, they put on these white buskins, and give\r\ntheir others in charge to the servants, in order that they may not foul\r\nthe fine carpets of silk and gold and divers colours.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE 1.—Ramusio’s heading has _Tartars_, but it is manifestly of\r\n  the Cathayans or Chinese that the author speaks throughout this\r\n  chapter.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 2.—“_Sbattendo i denti_.” This is almost certainly, as Marsden\r\n  has noticed, due to some error of transcription. Probably _Battono\r\n  i fronti_, or something similar, was the true reading. [See\r\n  following note, p. 461.—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 3.—The latter part of this passage has, I doubt not, been\r\n  more or less interpolated, seeing that it introduces again as a\r\n  _Chinese_ divinity the rude object of primitive Tartar worship,\r\n  of which we have already heard in Bk. I. ch. liii. And regarding\r\n  the former part of the passage, one cannot but have some doubt\r\n  whether what was taken for the symbol of the Most High was not\r\n  the ancestral tablet, which is usually placed in one of the inner\r\n  rooms of the house, and before which worship is performed at fixed\r\n  times, and according to certain established forms. Something, too,\r\n  may have been known of the Emperor’s worship of Heaven at the\r\n  great circular temple at Peking, called _T’ien-t’ân_, or Altar of\r\n  Heaven (see p. 459), where incensed offerings are made before a\r\n  tablet, on which is inscribed the name Yuh-Hwang Shang-ti, which\r\n  some interpret as “The Supreme Ruler of the Imperial Heavens,”\r\n  and regard as the nearest approach to pure Theism of which there\r\n  is any indication in Chinese worship (See _Doolittle_, pp. 170,\r\n  625; and _Lockhart_ in _J. R. G. S._, xxxvi. 142). This worship is\r\n  mentioned by the Mahomedan narrator of Shah Rukh’s embassy (1421):\r\n  “Every year there are some days on which the Emperor eats no animal\r\n  food.... He spends his time in an apartment which contains no idol,\r\n  and says that he is worshipping the God of Heaven.”[1] (_Ind.\r\n  Antiquary_, II. 81.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Great Temple of Heaven, Peking.]\r\n\r\n  The charge of irreligion against the Chinese is an old one, and\r\n  is made by Hayton in nearly the same terms as it often is by\r\n  modern missionaries: “And though these people have the acutest\r\n  intelligence in all matters wherein material things are concerned,\r\n  yet you shall never find among them any knowledge or perception\r\n  of spiritual things.” Yet it is a mistake to suppose that this\r\n  insensibility has been so universal as it is often represented. To\r\n  say nothing of the considerable numbers who have adhered faithfully\r\n  to the Roman Catholic Church, the large number of Mahomedans\r\n  in China, of whom many must have been proselytes, indicates an\r\n  interest in religion; and that Buddhism itself was in China once\r\n  a spiritual power of no small energy will, I think, be plain to\r\n  any one who reads the very interesting extracts in Schott’s essay\r\n  on Buddhism in Upper Asia and China. (_Berlin Acad. of Sciences_,\r\n  1846.) These seem to be so little known that I will translate\r\n  two or three of them. “In the years _Yuan-yeu_ of the Sung (A.D.\r\n  1086–1093), a pious matron with her two servants lived entirely to\r\n  the Land of Enlightenment. One of the maids said one day to her\r\n  companion: ‘To-night I shall pass over to the Realm of Amita.’ The\r\n  same night a balsamic odour filled the house, and the maid died\r\n  without any preceding illness. On the following day the surviving\r\n  maid said to the lady: ‘Yesterday my deceased companion appeared\r\n  to me in a dream, and said to me: “Thanks to the persevering\r\n  exhortations of our mistress, I am become a partaker of Paradise,\r\n  and my blessedness is past all expression in words.”’ The matron\r\n  replied: ‘If she will appear to me also then I will believe what\r\n  you say.’ Next night the deceased really appeared to her, and\r\n  saluted her with respect. The lady asked: ‘May I, for once, visit\r\n  the Land of Enlightenment?’ ‘Yea,’ answered the Blessed Soul,\r\n  ‘thou hast but to follow thy handmaiden.’ The lady followed her\r\n  (in her dream), and soon perceived a lake of immeasurable expanse,\r\n  overspread with innumerable red and white lotus flowers, of\r\n  various sizes, some blooming, some fading. She asked what those\r\n  flowers might signify? The maiden replied: ‘These are all human\r\n  beings on the earth whose thoughts are turned to the Land of\r\n  Enlightenment. The very first longing after the Paradise of Amita\r\n  produces a flower in the Celestial Lake, and this becomes daily\r\n  larger and more glorious, as the self-improvement of the person\r\n  whom it represents advances; in the contrary case, it loses in\r\n  glory and fades away.’[2] The matron desired to know the name of an\r\n  enlightened one who reposed on one of the flowers, clad in a waving\r\n  and wondrously glistening raiment. Her whilom maiden answered:\r\n  ‘That is Yangkie.’ Then asked she the name of another, and was\r\n  answered: ‘That is Mahu.’ The lady then said: ‘At what place shall\r\n  I hereafter come into existence?’ Then the Blessed Soul led her a\r\n  space further, and showed her a hill that gleamed with gold and\r\n  azure. ‘Here,’ said she, ‘is your future abode. You will belong to\r\n  the first order of the blessed.’ When the matron awoke she sent\r\n  to enquire for Yangkie and Mahu. The first was already departed;\r\n  the other still alive and well. And thus the lady learned that the\r\n  soul of one who advances in holiness and never turns back, may be\r\n  already a dweller in the Land of Enlightenment, even though the\r\n  body still sojourn in this transitory world” (pp. 55–56).\r\n\r\n  What a singular counterpart the striking conclusion here forms to\r\n  Dante’s tremendous assault on a still living villain,—or enemy!\r\n\r\n        ——————“che per sua opra\r\n        In anima in Cocito già si bagna,\r\n      Ed in corpo par vivo ancor di sopra.”\r\n                             —_Infern._ xxxiii. 155.\r\n\r\n  Again: “I knew a man who during his life had killed many living\r\n  beings, and was at last struck with an apoplexy. The sorrows in\r\n  store for his sin-laden soul pained me to the heart; I visited\r\n  him, and exhorted him to call on the Amita; but he obstinately\r\n  refused, and spoke only of indifferent matters. His illness clouded\r\n  his understanding; in consequence of his misdeeds he had become\r\n  hardened. What was before such a man when once his eyes were\r\n  closed? Wherefore let men be converted while there is yet time! In\r\n  this life the night followeth the day, and the winter followeth\r\n  the summer; that, all men are aware of. But that life is followed\r\n  by death, no man will consider. Oh, what blindness and obduracy is\r\n  this!” (p. 93).\r\n\r\n  Again: “Hoang-ta-tie, of T’ancheu (Changshu-fu in Honan), who lived\r\n  under the Sung, followed the craft of a blacksmith. Whenever he\r\n  was at his work he used to call without intermission on the name\r\n  of Amita Buddha. One day he handed to his neighbours the following\r\n  verses of his own composing to be spread about:—\r\n\r\n      ‘Ding dong! The hammer-strokes fall long and fast,\r\n       Until the Iron turns to steel at last!\r\n       Now shall the long long Day of Rest begin,\r\n       The Land of Bliss Eternal calls me in.’\r\n\r\n  Thereupon he died. But his verses spread all over Honan, and many\r\n  learned to call upon Buddha” (103).\r\n\r\n  Once more: “In my own town there lived a physician by name\r\n  Chang-yan-ming. He was a man who never took payment for his\r\n  treatment from any one in poor or indifferent circumstances; nay,\r\n  he would often make presents to such persons of money or corn to\r\n  lighten their lot. If a rich man would have his advice and paid\r\n  him a fee, he never looked to see whether it were much or little.\r\n  If a patient lay so dangerously ill that Yanming despaired of his\r\n  recovery, he would still give him good medicine to comfort his\r\n  heart, but never took payment for it. I knew this man for many a\r\n  year, and I never heard the word _Money_ pass his lips! One day\r\n  a fire broke out in the town, and laid the whole of the houses\r\n  in ashes; only that of the physician was spared. His sons and\r\n  grandsons reached high dignities” (p. 110).\r\n\r\n  Of such as this physician the apostle said: “Of a truth I perceive\r\n  that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that\r\n  feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.”\r\n\r\n  [“By the ‘Most High and Heavenly God,’ worshipped by the Chinese,\r\n  as Marco Polo reports, evidently the Chinese _T’ien_, ‘Heaven’ is\r\n  meant, _Lao t’ien ye_ in the common language. Regarding ‘the God\r\n  of things terrestrial,’ whose figure the Chinese, according to M.\r\n  Polo, ‘placed below on the ground,’ there can also be no doubt that\r\n  he understands the _T’u-ti_, the local ‘Lar’ of the Chinese, to\r\n  which they present sacrifices on the floor, near the wall under the\r\n  table.\r\n\r\n  “M. Polo reports, that the Chinese worship their God offering\r\n  incense, raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth.\r\n  Of course he means that they placed the hands together, or held\r\n  kindled joss-stick bundles in their hands, according to the Chinese\r\n  custom. The statement of M. Polo _sbattendo i denti_ is very\r\n  remarkable. It seems to me, that very few of the Chinese are aware\r\n  of the fact, that this custom still exists among the Taouists.\r\n  In the rituals of the Taouists the _K’ow-ch’i_ (_K’ow_ = ‘to\r\n  knock against,’_ch’i_ = ‘teeth’) is prescribed as a comminatory\r\n  and propitiatory act. It is effected by the four upper and lower\r\n  foreteeth. The Taouists are obliged before the service begins to\r\n  perform a certain number of _K’ow-ch’i_, turning their heads\r\n  alternately to the left and to the right, in order to drive away\r\n  mundane thoughts and aggressions of bad spirits. The _K’ow-ch’i_\r\n  repeated three times is called _ming fa ku_ in Chinese, _i.e._ ‘to\r\n  beat the spiritual drum.’ The ritual says, that it is heard by the\r\n  Most High Ruler, who is moved by it to grace.\r\n\r\n  “M. Polo observed this custom among the lay heathen. Indeed, it\r\n  appears from a small treatise, written in China more than a hundred\r\n  years before M. Polo, that at the time the Chinese author wrote,\r\n  all devout men, entering a temple, used to perform the _K’ow-ch’i_,\r\n  and considered it an expression of veneration and devotion to\r\n  the idols. Thus this custom had been preserved to the time of M.\r\n  Polo, who did not fail to mention this strange peculiarity in the\r\n  exterior observances of the Chinese. As regards the present time it\r\n  seems to me, that this custom is not known among the people, and\r\n  even with respect to the Taouists it is only performed on certain\r\n  occasions, and not in all Taouist temples.” (_Palladius_, pp.\r\n  53–54.)—H. C.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE 4.—“True politeness cannot of course be taught by rules\r\n  merely, but a great degree of urbanity and kindness is everywhere\r\n  shown, whether owing to the naturally placable disposition of the\r\n  people, or to the effects of their early instruction in the forms\r\n  of politeness.” (_Mid. Kingdom_, II. 68.) As regards the “ornate\r\n  style of speech,” a well-bred Chinaman never says _I_ or _You_, but\r\n  for the former “the little person,” “the disciple,” “the inferior,”\r\n  and so on; and for the latter, “the learned man,” “the master,”\r\n  or even “the emperor.” These phrases, however, are not confined\r\n  to China, most of them having exact parallels in Hindustani\r\n  courtesy. On this subject and the courteous disposition of the\r\n  Chinese, see _Fontaney_, in _Lett. Edif._ VII. 287 _seqq._; also\r\n  XI. 287 _seqq._; _Semedo_, 36; _Lecomte_, II. 48 _seqq._ There are,\r\n  however, strong differences of opinion expressed on this subject;\r\n  there is, apparently, much more genuine courtesy in the north than\r\n  in the south.\r\n\r\n  NOTE 5.—“Filial piety is the fundamental principle of the Chinese\r\n  polity.” (_Amiot_, V. 129.) “In cases of extreme unfilial conduct,\r\n  parents sometimes accuse their children before the magistrate, and\r\n  demand his official aid in controlling or punishing them; but such\r\n  instances are comparatively rare.... If the parent require his\r\n  son to be publicly whipped by the command of the magistrate, the\r\n  latter is obliged to order the infliction of the whipping.... If\r\n  after punishment the son remain undutiful and disobedient, and his\r\n  parents demand it at the hands of the magistrate, the latter must,\r\n  with the consent of the maternal uncles of the son, cause him to\r\n  be taken out to the high wall in front of the yamun, and have him\r\n  there publicly whipped to death.” (_Doolittle_, 102–103.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE 6.—[Mr. Rockhill writes to me that pocket-spitoons are still\r\n  used in China.—H.

The actual temple dates from\r\n    1420–1430; but the _Institution_ is very ancient, and I think\r\n    there is evidence that such a structure existed under the Mongols,\r\n    probably only _restored_ by the Ming. [It was built during the 18th\r\n    year of the reign of the third Ming Emperor Yung Loh (1403–1425);\r\n    it was entirely restored during the 18th year of K’ien Lung;\r\n    it was struck by lightning and burnt down in 1889; it is being\r\n    rebuilt.—H.

A number of these extraordinary\r\n    productions (for extraordinary they were undoubtedly) professed to\r\n    represent the “Spiritual Flowers” of such and such persons; and the\r\n    explanation of this as presented in the catalogue was in substance\r\n    exactly that given in the text.
